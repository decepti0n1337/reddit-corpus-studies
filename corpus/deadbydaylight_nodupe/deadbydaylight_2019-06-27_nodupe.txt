True is not a good example because most players will never even come close to that skill or game knowledge.

---
Even then, he acknowledges that the scales are tipped heavily in the survivor's favor without it.

In my opinion they should make the Ruin effect baseline and deactivate it after first down or something. This way it wouldn't over- or undershoot, like it usually does, and also open up a perk slot for more interesting builds.

Thats my house cat. Only time I get a chance to pet them is when THEY are the ones that decide they want to get pet

Is that the chick from konosuba?
---
This patch is by far the worse one with the bugs.
---
it end july 2nd
---
it would be cool if they just made Wraith fully invisible but they can't do that
---
i think that if they removed that speed boost you get when uncloaking and in exchange made him fully invisible, i think it wouldn't be too overpowered, he's still an M1 killer who gets stopped by pallets
---
Anniversary isn't over until July 2nd.
---
seriously shes hideous
---
You act like I‚Äôve said the worse thing in the world when I‚Äôm just stating fact üòÇ he‚Äôs not a viable killer in red ranks. All I see down here are Billy‚Äôs and spirits maybe some nurses but not many as I play on ps4 and when it‚Äôs a different killer most of the time They get rekt haha I‚Äôm not an asshole for speaking the obvious so maybe you should shut the fuck up and stop being a asshole?
---
Exactly this is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen it work
---
That window vault at the begging triggers me
---
Is it bad I think it looks like an old Zubatlel
---
What sound cue is that?  The robe sound?
---
Many people value wins/strategy over points, though, regardless of courtesy.
---
One of the reasons why I try and get my killers to level 50 before even thinking about playing them lol
---
So it‚Äôs just a nerf? Because the other part of what makes Ruin so strong is that the regression along with pausing the timer. If you just have regression with no pausing, that‚Äôs a massive nerf because you‚Äôre not making the generations any harder to actually finish just artificially inflating the timer. I understand what you mean by trying to change Ruin, but this ain‚Äôt it, chief.
---
Doctor is free for Xbox...
---
You can hear "aaaaaaaaveeeeeeeeee maaaaaariiiiiiiiiIiiiiiiaaaaa" song on the background
---
Yeah I forgot that, I got the game a very long time ago, so just a lapse of memory there.
---
The problem with my cat is that they get scared when I crouch down, so I do the slow blink while towering over them, but at least it works
---
Wish this was for Xbox lol
---
Ghostface's stun sound is him already done with survivor's shit.
---
From day 1 he was already fed up.
---
Well. 2 of those perks can be completely shredded as long as you don‚Äôt rely exclusively on tunneling. Dead hard only works 50 percent of the time. And adrenaline never really bothers me when I play Killer, nor anybody I know. It‚Äôs just 2 more scoring events you can get. Same with insta heals. And regardless of this , using things the devs put in the game to win is someone immoral when a survivor does it, but you keep running your NOED, 5 blink Nurse, 1 tap hatchets etc, and saying that survivors complain too much
---
Is there anything they didn't break in this patch?
---
Damm can't believe they're scamming people like that
---
He got banned?!
---
The real worth, in my opinion, is that you get em for half the price.
---
Whoever is down voting me your moms a hoe
---
Basically how it worked was each time you hooked someone, that bar would fill a quarter. Each quarter was a point, so you can earn up to 4 points per survivor. You would earn 1 per hook, plus one when they died, so hooking was encouraged over slugging/moris. It was changed because when you throw DC's in, as well as Moris, it kind of messes with the system.
---
Agreed. The hitboxes are garbage on PS4.
---
I feel like we did a pretty good job so far.

But you find perks to make it easier, making it more boring and not skill, just perks, of there wasn‚Äôt perks it wouldn‚Äôt be boring. The deliverance makes it worse because they‚Äôll be like. ‚ÄúOh he has deliverance, he‚Äôs gonna go in the hatch‚Äù
---
Mine is wired in and I still have that happen way too often.
---
I think that ruin rn (or at least when i was playing more often) is such a garbage perk if youre going against higher skilled survivors. Whenever I see ruin come up it has no effect on me. I just keep working on the gen because its not like hitting greats is such a struggle. I think that ruin turned in from slowing down gens by altering skill checks to actually buying time by having people look for the totem.
---
r/meirl
---
Oink. (yes)
---
I will not be the bone dog Myers!
---
No
---
Someone watches Otzs
---
MAYBE THEY ARE ALL KILLERS WHO GOT TIRED WAITING TWENTY MINUTES IN QUEUE JUST TO GET LOW QUALITY SWF GAMES.
---
I didn't mean it as a nerf or change to ruin. I meant take ruin and slap it into the base kit, i made it weaker because it will no longer be a hex.
---
‚ÄúIve peaked at DBD‚Äù Fast Vaults a window straight into killer
---
She's fun to play so why not
---
I saw it too and was like what? Otz is the one of my favorite YouTubers for DbD and Dark Souls
---
Yeah I know back to three viable killers praise the entity!
---
Legitimately curious - what are you referring to here?
---
I HAVEN'T GONE AGAINST ONE GF THAT DIDN'T CAMP. THAT BEING SAID THE FIRST TIME I WAS EXPOSED AND SAW HIM COMING OUT OF NOWHERE THE FEAR OF GOD WAS STRUCK INTO ME, SO I CAN SEE IT BEING SO FUCKING FUN.
---
I've read the patch notes and it wasn't a nerf lmao.
---
Did you see his new trapper video? He DEMOLISHES the survivors.
---
*doesn't bring any perk that can stop gen progression* tHeSE gENruShER mAN
---
I choose option 4, I don‚Äôt trust people
---
Noed, ruin, bbq, thana, if they have 2 or more items swap thana for Franklin‚Äôs if you‚Äôre bad at mind games and eat pallets a lot spirit fury or enduring
---
"Kiss my grits"
---
Dedicated servers will drop and this will still happen then people will finally see the hit boxes are the issue.
---
Even with wired internet in a green ping lobby I take and dish out questionable hits.
---
It wasn't random. Check out his videos: not Otzdarva
---
Of all the perks to add to the base kit in a weaker form to help killers with early gen progression I‚Äôd rather say something like Tremors or PGTW but I like the spot PGTW is in now and TT is still too new to say so.
---
Honestly, there are numerous movies and TV shows this references.  It's kinda been done to death so now it's mostly a joke.
---
i feel you (even if i do main her)
---
Same here, in Canada gf account for the sale and mine didn‚Äôt
---
PERFECTLY BALANCED, AS ALL THINGS SHOULD BE. 
---
(I FEEL YOUR PAIN, THOUGH)
---
That's why I fucking love ghost face lmfaooo
---
I don‚Äôt have thana or Franklins or enduring /: but I‚Äôm working on it !!!
---
It's such bullshit man. They need to fix this.
---
I wish we had more people like you in the community, if everyone here learnt a little empathy the community would be so much better
---
Myers is definitely more unique then all of them as Myers can do Scratch mirror, Burgerking Myers, infinite one shots and Tombstone Myers, Vault master Myers, fast stalk Myers etc etc while his counterpart Ghostface doesn't really have any unique builds besides aura reading and fast crouching and this is coming from alot of time with Ghostface (played him to lvl 1 to p3 lvl 50)
---
Ye. Vote manipulation. His "pig=upvote" if I was to guess.
---
thanks
---
But a permanent 10-15% speed buff was a bit overkill. Especially with Furtive Chase to swap your obsessions around anyone with instadown capabilities were just not escapable.
---
So are we not gonna talk about how she‚Äôs eating that taco from the middle?
---
Nooo they fixed play with your dood
---
Laughed out loud
---
Well it worked out in the end
---
Last night I was playing Myers and I had killed everybody but this one Meg. Eventually I found her scratch marks and chased her, but she started running in really weird directions. I eventually caught her. I looked up and realized why she was running that way.
---
I caught her 5 feet from the hatch.
---
I let her go.
---
What the guy before said. If I do a gen without a problem I know its not ruin. I usually walk around the map and If I see 2 totems that light up. Its a pretty good chance its haunted. I usually play with a friend and we both find two seperate lit up totems which makes it easier.
---
Only an overeactor thinks this is a total nerf.
---
How the turn tables have revolved
---
Correct, but will be gone forever. I like to save event items
---
what the f\*\*k i would in bliss if that happen to me
---
Yeah, I'm on PS4 as well. It has been really bad tonight! 
---
I make a lot of shitty plays, I'm still pretty new to the game, so I can hold my hands up and say when it's just me playing badly. Tonight there was just a ton of facecamping and tunnelling; I'm hoping it's just because I'm low rank but I feel like I'll never level up at this rate!
---
Almost all hexes tell you when they‚Äôre active by hitting a skill check, getting hit, or cleansing a totem. If you don‚Äôt cant identify it, it‚Äôs either haunted or devour. Killers act differently with devour, watching you finish saving before moving closer and running away after a hook. If you can‚Äôt identify it, its not affecting you so just leave it
---
I don't know what was removed, but good on yah.
---
Poor killers don't need bully.
---
I‚Äôm close to giving her a prestige just gotta farm up some bloodpoints to get my perks back
---
My appreciation.
---
I play PS4, so I'm not sure we have that
---
I played an all Meg game recently and we got obliterated :(
---
Forgot to add a flair so it was taken down temporarily. Should be back up now
---
Do you play on PS4? I can't heal myself or others either. I was trying to do the "heal other survivors" daily with Claudette and the option wasn't there, even when equipping a medkit and obviously running Self-care for myself. However, others could heal me.
---
Console has players? This feels like the kinda game console players would have abandoned by know, off playing cod and what not
---
I dont like working on gens with others if ruin is in play, it breaks my concentration for some reason
---
The most satisfying thing EVER, is sneaking up on someone and just PLUCKING them off the gen.
---
Rare, but holy fuck is it delicious.
---
Damn I really wished it was going to be Hoffman lmao. Oh well, it's still great we get cosmetics for Amanda anyway
---
So did I, I DCed out of shame. :(
---
The masochist girl herself? Yes it is good sir. I see you are a fellow man of culture. Proceed
---
Username checks out :)
---
Hope you're fine with the killer DCing if they end up on Haddonfield then
---
Fisherman killer when
---
Framerates are super inconsistent.  Some games you‚Äôre smooth as butter others are at like 15.
---
HELL yeh, thanks bud.
---
409% blood points isn‚Äôt a reason?
---
I dont know why but I expected some opera music to be playing while you were in slow motion. Some heavenly song for dramatic effect.
---
That‚Äôs what I feel everytime this type of hit happens. With me wanting to uninstall just a tad
---
This seems like its a fetish thing
---
Sounds like the audio bug where only some people were affected.
---
You killed Kenny!!
---
Wow,you big brain.
---
Who is that? I googled it an couldn't find anything
---
Not to judge, but why????
---
Increases his base movement speed while cloaked from 126% to 135-140%. Nerf or rework his speed add-ons if needed.
---
That would increase his map pressure a lot and would make him better even in chases, because he could block survivors more easily, also, he would be less add-on reliant.
---
How should we feel? Spoopy? Why yes indeed I have an addiction to yoinks why do u ask
---
Had this last night with Self Care, attempting to heal a teammate and trying to drop pallets.  Also on PS4.
---
Friends mainly.
---
I take it those are killer mains on the bottom there.
---
I don't mean the detection, I mean I can't know that he's around until I actually see him most of the time.
---
I experience that on PC anyways. It‚Äôs rare but it happens. At the worst was like .5
---
He's permanently banned btw.
---
Too bad, it was a nice guy.
---
Maybe make it an add-on as clown already has one but just slapping status effects on every killer isn't the way they should fix them imo. And honestly if you know how to run tiles and mindgame using redstain most the killers are able to get 4ks at rank 1 or maybe the rank 1 survivors I go against are shite lol. but I don't disagree that some of these killers do need changes I just hope they'll be more fun to play against than just status effects, ya feel?
---
 https://www.mediafire.com/file/247r99v44592mdm/Power\_Killer.rar/file
---
This is the biggest reason I won't return to the game yet. I love it but it always tilts me off the face of the Earth to get hit like this.
---
Thanks! I really enjoy playing and hope that I play a very satisfying and most times challenging killer for survivors so they have fun with the game as much as I do.
---
Yours?
---
I‚Äôm not catching on to what you‚Äôre saying but maybe I‚Äôll understand later on
---
I relate to that. If I see a Haddonfield offering and the first guy I chase has balanced landing, then I'm done lol.
---
Both.  I like killer, but life keeps me pretty busy so waiting for a spot is sometimes longer time than I have to spare.
---
That's what you get for hitting survivors on the hook. Great play!
---
I don't see the point in DCing in either case, but it feels stupid to be fine with one example, but not the other
---
All killers are fun, but i‚Äôd recommend to stay clear from cannibal. I prefer Spirit, Hag and Myers,but all are fun
---
Congrats!
---
I realized after playing Ghostface for a while that this might not been as bad as I thought. On PS4 I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôve been getting a lot of pips with him and playing pretty well. I‚Äôm going to try to get the adept Ghostface soon.
---
I'ma be real guy, you might need to work on just writing quality. But also ... borderline pedophilea content that you gotta be REAL careful putting out there. Especially without a good grasp on attractive writing, this sounds almost like a teenagers urges kinda pushing out a little. No offenses, no hate to give you, but you gotta be REEAAAL tact with that kinda backstory.
---
NURSE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SWING AFTER A BLINK IF SHES PALLET STUNNED
---
You can escape through hatch if you're the last one
---
disney world is getting pretty dark man holy shit
---
I still want to smash
---
I love playing the Spirit but I sure do wish I could toggle on/off or quiet her moaning/groaning WAAAHs. They‚Äôre so loud!
---
Everyone brought toolbox lmao... see the full video before laught at me
---
I just enjoy the map, and I'm not trying to cheese with max TR doctor or something that has a huge advantage on a certain map. Most of the time I'm just playing Hag and just want a good game on a map I like.
---
i only farm when survivors start to dc for basically no reason + what if they didn't want to farm?
---
outplayed
---
Consol√© player of dbd for two years, ping is horrible on Xbox. Players are even more toxic because there is no game room chat; instead they will take the time to personally write you through messages being annoying. Looping is slightly harder due to latency issues on Xbox. Frame rats are inconsistent.
---
It's kinda dumb to DC as a whole unless you're literally being held hostage.
---
Especially when you hit that mori and she hacks at the survivors sides then screams at them making your ears bleed
---
Real gamer moments
---
Options 1, 2, and 4 (I don‚Äôt like trusting other random Survivors with my health).
---
Goodbye ghost face. You were almost fun for the week you were a killer.
---
Status effects that nullify the very things that make the killer garbage are literally the best way to fix them...
---
And trust me the ol moon walk only works on some loops and survivors worth their salt are not going to fall for it 90% of the time...as most maps allow survivors to see you through, around, or over the object in question....
---
But for wraith he will have stealth and attacking from stealth will offer him exhaust to slow the chase time, and mangles to slow the game down with heal time...
---
Trust me I'd love to see a rework where wraith can stack suprises attacks to gain exposed status on the next one... or anything involving true ambush gameplay... but it took 2 fucking years to finally fix freddy do you really expect that to happen for wraith within our century?
---
This game is soooo broken lol.
---
In my personal experience that's all people bring Haddonfield offering for. Just teabag at the house balconys and watch as the killer can't ever get to you thanks to BL.
---
Kind of. Roulette Spirit is running Thrill Of The Hunt, Haunted Grounds and two other Hexes (generally Ruin and Devour), then grabbing survivors off totems or killing them with Devour. Prayer Beads are used often with it, but aren‚Äôt necessary.
---
Completely agree.
---
The game needs 3 things atm.
---
Generators need to go slower
---
Survivors need a new objective
---
Survivors need a way to get survival points
---
Best thing to do would be adding gas canisters.
---
Generator would be slowed without canisters, with a canister, generators would go at their current speed. They would give Survival Points for finding one and delivering them to a gen.
---
Killers who hit a survivor carrying a canister cause them to drop it. Survivors who are like in 8m radius see their auras.
---
Blinding perks would be stronger, survivors get a new objective, gens go slower, but have the potential to go at normal speed, survivors also get more points. Killers wouldn't need to run Ruin all the time, a lot of Crappy perks can get reworked to help with the Canisters.
---
+ they were kind of a cocky swf since all they did was to farm each other off the hook with BT and WGLF, and they also starting spamming the flashlight and t-bag me to come and chase them while they went down in the first 30 secs of a chase, they should be grateful enough that i didn't mori anyone since all i wanted was to make everyone get enough points
---
Was playing as huntress earlier and people were saying the distance volume was fucked too. Like quiet up close but really loud far away or something?
---
In before some moron says "ItS bEcAuSe Of LaTeNcY".
---
It clearly isn't. Even on green ping 20ms games this still happens. Hell, spectate the killer and you see it happening for them too, somehow magically hitting survivors who are all the way at the other side of pallets, two meters past windows, etc.
---
Hitboxes are strange and seem to merge/get stuck on various objects. If you fast vault over a pallet and you're right on the other side, the killer just needs to hit the actual pallet. Doesn't matter that their weapon lands on the wood, nowhere near the survivor, because if that survivor still has a tip toe on the pallet when it's hit, their hitbox is still making love to that pallet.
---
Fuck this game.
---
Holy shit this UI was so good for knowing how many times you had hooked people why is it not a thing?
---
I have complained about this for ages :( the survivors with faces was much easier to read.
---
Are they talking about the flappy noise where it sounds like he has a rain coat on in a hurricane?
---
it will not help as much as you think it will honestly. well maybe for killer survivors will still suffer cause ppl will just die on hook for the same effect
---
I assumed as much.
---
Better than the toddler drawings I‚Äôm able to do, you can tell who it is, and any imperfections you may think are there could be interpreted as your personal art style, which technically it is. I say good job job nonetheless!
---
Its basically just worse on console. Other than that just the same stuff as every other multi platform game: the highest skilled players on pc are better than the highest skilled players on console. Console has a little less content. But they‚Äôre certainly both viable versions of the game
---
WHAT
---
I am straddling 3,000 hours and did not know this. I thought the best we had was a bunch of names with perks attached to them. 
---
I'll have to see this when I'm home tonight
---
i saw all of it, didn't know it's illegal for survivors to bring items but you did good without Ruin so why complain
---
I'm not saying that it wouldn't work. I'm just saying it's a boring lazy and unfun way to change them.

On top of this it would make perks like sloppy butcher serve 0 purpose
---
Fool me once, shame on you: You feel as if nothing can stop you. Not even the blows from an ungodly force.
---
After being hit by the killer, you gain a momentary boost of speed letting you run farther and faster for 4/5/6 seconds. 
---
FMOSOY is an exhaustion perk which will recover after 60/50/40 seconds of use. 
---
Does not stack with adrenaline, no mither, Mettle of Man hits when MoM is active, and hits when mid fall. 
---
Please leave comments on how I can better this perk. I feel as if this would be a mid tier exhaustion perk which would assist players who wish to escape from the killers sight more often.
---
Did you check if your headphones were on backwards?
---
Sure
---
Hag is a very versatile killer, and you can run a lot of different builds on her. I'll share some of the ones that I have enjoyed on her. I absolutely hate hex perks, so you won't see any of them in my builds.
---
Gen protector hag:
---
monitor and abuse will shrink down your terror radius and make it easy to sneak up on survivors, Pop goes the weasel is very decent on her with the timer now extended, surveillance will let you know what gens have been worked on, and nurses calling will allow you to find healing survivors. add ons for this aren't super important, but you can never go wrong with range.
---
Focus down on four generators, trap them up, and you surveillance and Pop goes the weasel to lock them down. Monitor and abuse makes hag a literal Ninja and easy to sneak up on survivors if they activate surveillance.
---
Anti heal hag
---
Sloppy butcher, nurses, monitor, and a fourth flex perk of your choice. Thanatophobia is bad at slowing down the game, but I find survivors tend to heal more when I use it. sloppy butcher make survivors take a long time to heal, and the combination of nurses and monitor make it super easy to find healing survivors.
---
10 MINUTES?! MORE LIKE A MILLION YEARS
---
I only teabag at a pallet when I blatantly throw it early and he just stands there in disappointment.
---
I guess i shall wait sadly as number fifteen
---
Lol that would have been awesome!
---
He still wants his points too ditz, if you guys are actually farming you'll pip even if you die so who cares
---
Hey, thanks man. My personal mission is to ignore it as much as possible and still try to be a nice guy killer. Letting good survivors go if they're the last man standing, sympathy for mass D/Cs, etc... Until I snatch that t-bagging motherfucking Meg and Mori her sorry ass into the shadow realm.
---
I don't use self care. It takes too long. I bring botany knowledge and a med kit. Quickly heal myself and others. Win-win for me
---
Agreed. I see the other end of it as the killer too. When you see your weapon clip through someone, then they teleport out.
---
Why what happened?
---
Survivor is rough. Nearly every match I want to message the killer and say "I'm not with them."
---
Hahahaha!
---
Tunneling is an easy way to win though. Get one of them out early and you only have to hunt 3 survivors. There is NOTHING toxic about tunneling, or else we can say toolboxes are toxic too. It's just a means to an end.
---
Pansexual, actually.
---
If you like feeling like having fun with killers, get ghostface and get good with him
---
The money's coming from all of the comsetic shit they push out dont pretend that if they dont release killers or survivors they wont make money. They also have garrunteed income with them being on xbox gamepass. They are not hurting for money.
---
As someone who plays all of those except plague id go for myers hes the strongest out of those imo.
---
I‚Äôm not sure.
---
No, I mean that it fucks my muscle memory. So i can never hit any surv with my chainsaw.

I've been a Huntress main since the console release, and Spirit is the first killer to make me consider a switch. I 4K with her like it's my job, and at this point I think I'm just clinging to the satisfaction of that hatchet smack.
---
I know right lol! Imagine the amount of crying the rank 20 killer mains had to do to get this perk changed haha.
---
BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM
---
As Survivor, I never give the Killers garbage.
---
They have a tough enough job already.....always teetering on that line of performance:
---
- If they get no Kills = Survivors tease them.
---
- If they 4k = Salty Survivors talk shit to them.
---
 people pissing on them with taunts and "gg EZ" - is enough to make them say "fuck it" and run Ebony Moris for the rest of their session.
---
They make the game.
---
Killers, Keep on Killin' On!!
---
üëåüèæüëåüèæ
---
Ugh, that's the worst.
---
As long as they're not as sweaty as my cancerous teammates, we're cool.  
---
Lately the killers have been quite brutal, though. Tunnelling, slugging, proxying, you name it, I've encountered them at least one a day for the past week. No idea what the hell happened to have caused this upstir in Comic Con levels of sweat.  
---
Perhaps I should just play killer, take a load off. Try to enjoy the OchiDO wannabes that are most yellow and green rank survivor mains.
---
Yes. He isn‚Äôt the pioneer of it, but maybe the OP of the comment isn‚Äôt aware of that
---
How does not having game room chat make people toxic?
---
Some people.
---
Lot of Survivor NPCs in here downvoting an innocent Killer who wasn‚Äôt obligated to do shit.
---
Uhaaaaaah
---
WHY DID THEY REMOVE THE CAMERA SHAKE WHEN YOU GET HIT?! I ACTUALLY LIKED THAT.
---
You can faintly hear chase music but that's it. It sounds so weird. It's probably a bug or something.
---
You just need to use red paint brush and jump rope more.  Also Bamboozle + Fire Up.
---
Get Spirit for her perks and a very strong killer.
---
Get Hag for her perks and a strong killer.
---
Get Cannibal for his perks and a ...

could be a friend's computer/account he's playin
---
Right, exactly. Doing gens and "gen rushing" aren't bad. The point of the post is to say that gen rushing as a possibility exists, and is therefore flawed.
---
What are you talking about?
---
Concern number 1) You hate burning it because the totem is cleansed almost Immediately
---
My thoughts on concern number 1) If it is getting popped almost immediately, then it brings little benefit. When you have only four perks, you want something that brings a lot of use. If you want to use ruin as a way to prevent gen rushing, I suggest using the perk ‚ÄúThrill of The Hunt‚Äù this perk lets you know when someone starts to cleanse the totem.  This helps you find people which is the first step to hooking people. When you have one person hooked, that is one  less person that can be working on gens and 2 people aren‚Äôt working on gens if someone is going to rescue the hooked person.
---
Concern number 2) It is the only thing that stands in the way of gen rushing.  
---
My thoughts on concern number 2)  Ruin , although a useful perk , is NOT the only thing that stands in the way of gen rushing.  Hooking and killing people is the best way to counter gen rushing because every occupied/killed survivor is -25% speed to gens. If someone is hooked, one is going for the unhook,  That cuts the speed in half. You should also be looking to kick generators and cycle around them to slow down the generator repair progress. 
---
JUST BY THE WAY, I AM BY NO MEANS AN EXPERT AD DEAD BY DAYLIGHT. THESE ARE SIMPLY MY THOUGHTS ON THE TOPIC.  CORRECTIONS AND COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT I SAID ARE ENCOURAGED AND IT IS OKAY IF YOU DISAGREE WITH WHAT I SAID.  THANKS FOR UNDERSTANDING.
---
Poor dweet
---
head looks a little weird but it looks good, well done
---
OR make *sure* it stacks with Flip Flop
---
The tier ups and theme is inaudible
---
Exactly
---
This looks familiar.  Something from a previous era.  Is this minami-ke?
---
YOU WOULD OF BEEN MAD TOO IF YOU WERE THAT GHOST FACE
---
I‚Äôm a spirit main at the moment but I was considering switching to the plague or even huntress not to sure though
---
My biggest worry is the game times. Idk the actual player count on xbox but it seems finding a game usually takes forever.
---
Yoinking is when you take a person off of a gen, it‚Äôs easier to do as spirit especially with the prayer beads bracelet add on
---
Just my surprise if console dabs is still well populated, in my experience these sorts of games are only co for a small window after release and then everyone forgets about them, idk why I got so many downvotes lol
---
Lol good one
---
You forgot the 20 minute queues.
---
I'm no PC person so you are talking absolutely no sense to me as a ps4 player. You watch his vids and he always needs to activate windows.
---
Ah yes I‚Äôve gotten a few of those also with Myers too and had people message me saying that I made them shit their pants
---
Dabs was supposed to be dbd
---
Platform? Might want to edit that in.
---
You ever vault land off one of the upper vaults land on the ground and then get hit? Those are the best, especially the one time when I got chainsawed that was cool
---
I feel "pier to pier"  better captures how absolutely borked the system is, though.
---
what a lovely exchange!
---
Yea ive got no clue about that. I have maybe 25ish hours on console and finding games wasnt that bad
---
Yeah borderline r/dbdgonewild
---
He feels better to play now. idk what you talking about lol
---
Yeah it‚Äôs desync, it looks absurd on your screen but the killer hit on his
---
Cool* not co what the fucks going on lol
---
You're meant to do at least a little bit of everything (getting chased, doing gens, being altruistic, etc.), not just a lot of one thing.
---
Was I the killer? (Trygger is my ingame name) I was playing a few plague rounds earlier and running Thana.
---
This anime is called Plastic nee-san, haven't watched it yet, this funny scene is all I know about it
---
It's hilarious when your a doctor and a survivor t bags at a pallet. It only adds to their insanity or lets me shock them.
---
He must of been closer on his screen.
---
it was on ps4 so i dont think so
---
Survivors already get more than enough distance after being hit. Iron Will, Quick &amp; Quiet, and Dance with me already exist to help with this issue. What you‚Äôve got is ‚ÄúSprint Burst, but twice as good in a chase.‚Äù
---
I mean viability is fun... nurse is fun, Billy is fun, spirit is fun.... Myers is fun... huntress is fun...
---
Thanks! Totally forgot about it.
---
:\^)
---
It's a game of chases. There's going to be tunneling. Totally legit imo. It's very annoying at times but there's nothing unfair about it cause everyone's getting points.
---
So when you start out, your skillchecks will make your progress bar go down by 25%. Every skillcheck you hit will make the progress bar have a better reward until you hit max stacks. So the 25% means the bar will go down a bit when you first hit a skillcheck
---
All killers beside gf are on sale (idk about pig I own her) and I can get 3 killers so I‚Äôll prolly get gf Myers an legion.
---
Yes
---
It's fixed if yo load the game and play it dude!!?!?!?!?
---
Agreed, latley, I've been playing Myers instead of the doctor, and to get kills (especially at the end of the round cuz I suck at Myers), I gotta bait people into helping their friends on a hook. Which, tbh, is a dick move, but a move nonetheless.
---
But that makes her more powerful right? They‚Äôre injured and throwing up constantly that means she gets free tracking and easy downs right?
---
Spending money for dlc to support the developers is not anything new
---
I mean sure, doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs super un fun to get caught by leatherface and facecamped all game
---
If only survivor would take responsibility and just point to the hook until they get hooked twice.
---
I hate the survivors that come for the unhook and heals, but won't let you hook them, like sad confused animals who do t realize you're the one feeding them. Usually a Kate
---
I feel this lol. Worse than how I always hit through/around a tree.
---
Can we upvote this and make t popular
---
even in green ranks and occasionally purple
---
They should have kept the fun factor. Being fast as fuck is fun but it's definitely not worth a perk slot sadly as it stands. I'm not sure how they can make it so that it's worth using whilst also being balanced and fun.
---
Wait, Doctor loses bloodlust when he shocks? That's kind of broken. He's slow enough in Treatment mode already. 
---
And yeah, I definitely agree. The hallucination Doctors are basically worthless except as a tracking tool for the Doctor. They never make me jump, because I know they won't do anything. They're just kind of there.
---
Agreed!!
---
Why report him though?
---
Ash is one of the better looking survivors 
---
until he moves his face in anyway
---
Make a perk so if you crouch up and down within 3 seconds, the survivor‚Äôs legs snap and they cant move forever
---
Most of the ghost face players I play against haha.
---
It's just because of latency I think
---
It's hilarious to just watch survivors get all the gens then kill most of them at the end.
---
They get enough support from game sales. Players also will always have the ability to buy them with money. Being forced to do that is unacceptable.
---
You can‚Äôt play nurse 
---
She sucks
---
One of my neighbors has an outdoor cat that‚Äôll sometimes show up at my house demanding attention.
---
My dude lookin jacked, fr good drawing tho
---
That was the point of the perk.  It‚Äôs a perk you pair with others. Also, some areas you can‚Äôt utilize Dance with me or Quick and Quiet when you get hit.
---
WMI used to stack (as in each unhook gave 100% up to 300% or whatever it was) they specifically needed WMI to not go past 100% (hence the ambiguous description saying up to 100%, because before you could stack beyond that) I'm almost certain you can go faster than just WMI since medkits technically increase speed and their addons, whilst no specifically stating percentages, does in fact increase speed by an additive percentage.
---
Only for 1 killer... it's just like how bamboozle and spirit fury serve no purpose to nurse...
---
Like how monitor and abuse serves no purpose to ghost face or wraith... 
---
Perks arent for everyonex some killers dont need them due to abilities
---
The survivor bias is real, yet I main killer 80% of the time lol. But if you can remember, they actually put a notification up for that exploit, they did no such thing for wake up. So why should they ban someone for using a perk? There are plenty of casuals in this game who don‚Äôt read Reddit or forums who may use wake up. You saying they should get banned. Come on man.......
---
The ones that you have to buy are licensed, the devs CAN'T make them available for shards.
---
They aren't being forced to do that you could farm up enough points to buy them like that and idk if you know this but I don't think the game is being bought much anymore so the best way for them to make money is to make dlc for the fan base they have
---
Did you know you can cancel her ability if you pallet stun her
---
i did know
---
The clicky clickies are more annoying than anything in the world.
---
This looks like badass concept art. Bravo!
---
She‚Äôs pretty darn good. Early pressure is good too. People just dont know how to use her. Gotten 3+ kills and dc‚Äôs sometimes.
---
Damn. You are delusional.
---
I hate how none of the licensed survivors don't look like their movie counted part other than Ash and Bill
---
Thats good, not many people i tell know
---
Bad way to advertise your shitty stream
---
Hey man I don't think your ideas are terrible. Just agree to disagree
---
tbh, a survivor shouldn't cost as much as a killer
---
The main issue with the game is that it's the survs who dictate how the match is played.  The killer doesn't have much agency in that regard if they want to pip, and even then they might only get a safety pip.
---
wait really? when shes in her corrupt purge mode?
---
I didn't when I came back, the first few were tutorial shit so I skipped them all. They should disable the perks not ban for them.
---
That's kind of ridiculous, no? Wonder why'd they'd even put them in the game.
---
lol. I‚Äôd say anyone who thinks that perk is ‚ÄòOKAY‚Äô the way it is now is ACTUALLY delusional.
---
The little grunts are a nice touch.
---
Yea it completely gets rid of her corrupt purge
---
Awesome, I‚Äôll definitely try the gen protector build since I got all those perks on my low level hag (don‚Äôt have pop goes yet so I‚Äôll just throw on ruin)
---
Still need to get butcher and thana but I‚Äôll try something like that out when I get it
---
Ah, adrenaline. The killer‚Äôs worst party-pooper.
---
Quentin Force, assemble!
---
interesting
---
Same. One is bm, which you can just ignore, the other has an actual impact on the game. You can say being bmed has a negative impact on your enjoyment of a match, but it only has as much of an impact on the quality of the game itself as you allow it to.
---
this feels a bit too personal
---
The perks might need a bit of tweaking but I like it!
---
I dont have the video but 3 joined at the same time with toolboxes... suspecios right?
---
Feel free to repost it
---
Are you taking the piss?
---
Explain how it's ridiculous that the devs are trying to get FAMOUS horror characters into the game for the fans of the series. The people who own those characters stipulate that they have to be paid for, soooo..
---
The doctor is, in my opinion, the best anti - toxic - survivor killer. If you go insane, it's your fault for pallet looping or t bagging. No I'm not tunneling you your just in insanity tier three and I can see the glows of the faux doctors. See?
---
What is the highest rank you've been at?
---
not even some plague players know
---
Arms lookin swole af
---
Ace boss.
---
What have you brought upon this cursed land
---
Lol Hoffman eventually did go to the dark side of mass murdering.
---
Yea I didn‚Äôt even know about it until 2weeks ago lol
---
Who said it was illegal?
---
It also isn't illegal to call them ***gen rushers***.
---
It might be a bit illegal though that they got rekt.
---
I very much so enjoyed this video. Good job!
---
Yeah but Amanda seems much more easy to manipulate and influence
---
What's ruin? I'm a killer and I've never heard of this perk.
---
WHEN THAT LITTLE SLIDING SHIT THAT THE KILLER DOES TO HOOK SOMEONE COMPLETELY VOIDS AN 100% WIGGLE METER
---
GODDAMNIITJTITN
---
Haha amazing bug right?
---
I play on ps4,  yes. Happens pretty often too. The option to heal, drop pallets, literally anything disappears. Can't vault, basically a completely broken game when you enter. Worse off if you manage to get to an open door, you dont technically leave the game. Youre stuck on the outside, with nowhere to go. Just sit there and die, losing 5000 points in the process.
---
Best new bug i encountered as killer is you pick up a survivor on first down, an automatic decisive strike happens. Happened multiple games, both when i was killer and survivor.
---
People cry about killers and survivors being OP, how about actually fixing game breaking bugs instead?
---
Go look at the Hag's perks or Google it.

"Hex: Ruin Dead by Daylight"

Ight. Thxs!

good meme I lost my shit

not even my stream

Stonks

your problem m8.
---
Doctor getting ready throw some damn haymakers. Fuck the club lmao.
---
I actually did this as a killer
---
I lose music when I pick up survivors. Also good lord are my footsteps heavy sounding. 
---
Don‚Äôt know what else may be messed up.
---
Please direct him to me, I will love that baby so much
---
always lucky when you get the ruin before haunted grounds
---
Nobody said it was.
---
Hahaha yes my dude. Actually the truth. Killers unite.
---
That's mental!
---
I played killer against apparent SWF and I killed the one survivor and than I got a message saying I killed his friend and I should die. Lol.
---
It‚Äôs horrible doesn‚Äôt help that I suck as survivor, I need to learn how to properly run loops.
---
Fck killers they kill people for fun.
---
Correcting spelling online is dumb. That whole interaction gave me cancer. I am now dead.
---
Lemme explain what a license is. A license is when a a company (Behavior) buys a character or concept or anything like that to put it in their own creations. When a company like Warner Bros gives a license for a character they expect to be paid. Surprisingly Behavior doesn‚Äôt want to go bankrupt so they HAVE to make licenses cost real money as shards have no real monetary value.
---
He posts in /r/patientgamers so I assume he's just a really cheap person
---
You would be as fast as a killer and faster than some
---
She‚Äôs probably have quite the trek to make to get to you
---
I mean, it's down to your playstyle. I love smoking people with hatchets, but map control combined with some mind gaming makes for a good time for me personally. If you do go with Huntress, I can definitely confirm that she's a blast once you get her throws dialed in.
---
r/doublenegative
---
Depends, sometimes we message each other before the match. But usually I take downed survivor on 'walks' til they wiggle out. Most get it by then
---
I KNEW IT!!!!
---
Because you'd think that you'd want your game to maintain its integrity? Forcing players to buy DLC characters instantly devalues the game from what it would be worth without this garbage.
---
QUENTIN IS A FUCKING GOD HOW DARE YOU OPPOSE HIM!?
---
Yeah I do the same, smack the gens or pallets. I guess the newer players don‚Äôt understand and run away. I‚Äôll down them, pick their ass up, walk them over to a gen and drop them. Than they run and hide. Lol. You get the hook after a few dozen times after that.
---
He had a better gaming chair/s
---
I literally just bought Myers, didn‚Äôt spend any bp on him and I have a offering to play Myers lol.
---
well, just because they are swf with toolboxes doesn't mean they wanted to "genrush" you, you're a red rank killer who played really good without Ruin (they 100% took advantage of that) and very aggressive also
---
+1 for Darkness
---
I see some salty survivor already down voted me, but I stand by it. This endless cycle of "I perceived you as tunneling so I'm going to teabag. Okay, now I'm gonna camp cause you teabagged me" has created a real monster and it's sucking out a lot of the fun for people who want to... Well.. Have fun.
---
I do like scaring the shit out of people but I would also like to get huntress down pat with her hatchets suppose you could scare people with that too getting a cross map hatchet throw
---
Why tf would Disney World have ‚Äúremember death‚Äù on a ride?!
---
Not much of a horror character but I would like to see Alex from clockwork orange do some goofy mori‚Äôs
---
Does anyone know what stonks are
---
Or a Karen.
---
I like meat plant way more than I like swamp or family estate
---
So that thing in the corner shows up when you don't have a license for Windows. Keys to this license cost like 90 bucks. I had this watermark in the corner for like 2 years before I found out that there are people on ebay who sell these keys for like 5 dollars.
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
Absolutely. An old trick of the trade from way back in the FPS days is to put a sticker or something in the dead center of your screen for a bit to sort of train your eyes for where the aim point is.
---
He actually has a point, there wasn‚Äôt a clutch perk involved or a sweaty plan at work. My opinion is it was only cool because there was no skill involved, it would‚Äôve been lame if you adrenaline deliverance off the hook and used a key to escape. This is just an extremely unique and entertaining way to escape, nothing skilled about it
---
‚ÄúFeeling cute. Probably gonna kill some survivors later. Idk‚Äù
---
Just internet points /shrug
---
Sloppy isn't bugged?
---
Points received for Unhook Farming a Survivor: -30 Points
---
    These points are lost by the Survivor who performed the Unhook action when the unhooked Survivor gets downed within 10 seconds.
---
Its already a thing
---
He still has that but it's the same as like Trapper's breathing or whatnot.
---
They removed the weird distortion, static sounding effect when Night Shroud was active that was directional at EIGHT METERS. In other words, it was a directional sound cue like Huntress' humming that extended to about 8 meters or so which let you pinpoint him on nearly all gens as most gens have good cover.
---
You can still hear the flapping clothes but only when he moves and I think he has to be pretty close.
---
Now I want all the killers done up as cats! üò¨üò≠
---
I mean they‚Äôre not forcing you. They give us plenty of free characters to play. You say they shouldn‚Äôt put them in the game and you don‚Äôt want to pay for them. Then just don‚Äôt pay for them. Either way if they weren‚Äôt in the game or if you won‚Äôt pay for them you still won‚Äôt get to play the characters lol. So I don‚Äôt really understand your grievances.
---
Entity‚Äôs favor: Your endurance in the Trial arouses the Entity‚Äôs interest. When you enter the second state on the hook, hit 5/4/3 tremendously hard skill checks to slow the Entity‚Äôs progress by 10/15/20%.
---
I'll be honest, I'm okay with it. Removing his stealth jet engine is a good compromise for this, and makes him more consistent. Survivors can break him out of stealth if they're paying attention, but they no longer get a siren warning them to pay attention.
---
Well I used tomahawks a lot back on the black ops series so I‚Äôve got a decent idea on where the middle of my screen is so I might actually give huntress a go
---
If we are farming, I usually offer to be sacrificed. I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm having fun. It‚Äôs not always about winning.
---
genrushing is when survivors completely ignore any other actions except gens, just because they got a gen in 30 seconds since all 4 survivors were on it while there wasn't Ruin, it doesn't mean they wanted to gen rush 
---
otherwise, OP did really well in that match and it is also shameful that red ranks survivors got outplayed by a M1 killer without Ruin
---
Not terrible! Good job 11/10
---
Really?
---
No one is making you buy them if you don‚Äôt want to lol 
---
They have licenses to pay for those copyrights, and those are ongoing expenses, not just a one time payment. Don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt buy
---
More like only mid 10's will get this.
---
Thanatophobia was causing all actions to slow down. There may be some trick to it (last survivor hit or didn't glitch every time). Or people don't notice a such a small loss.
---
I have a post that gives my thoughts on Ruin.
---
Point is - Ruin shouldn't be required to precent gen rushing.
---
Then when you inevitably hook them within the next 30s they DC and send you hate mail
---
CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR BHVR IS A FUCKING JOKE. A GLITCH IN THEIR SYSTEM CAUSED ME TO GET BOOTED FROM FIVE GAMES IN A ROW. I INQUIRED WITH SUPPORT AND THEY SAID THEY WERE WORKING TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. I ASKED ABOUT THE TEN PIPS I LOST, THEY SAID TOO BAD I WONT GET THEM. FUCKING RIDICULOUS.
---
Am I the only one who can‚Äôt stand the current orange loading screen? I miss the old gloomy/grey loading screen, it was much more ominous
---
I this what happens when BhVR puts out a new patch, then another and another and another????
---
How the turn tables

---
rule 1 of survivor: ALWAYS assume its ghostface, myers or pig until you can confirm it's not.
---
I've actually been on a classic horror movie rampage and watching all my old favorites from Night of the Living Dead up to the Saw franchise.  The number of times I've thought of DbD is well beyond counting at this point. Mostly just making personal assessments of how well the game captures the "spirit" of the killer and things like that.
---
I FUCKING HATE THAT DBD HAS 95% OF USELESS PERKS, FIX IT BHVR!
---
The game is a good for killers...  sheltered woods is just trash
---
Problem is that shit doesn register with the perks (mom/WGLF) I can get 10 protection scoring events from hits and have 0 tokens. 
---
Also earlier I was working on a gen and someone got downed half the map away, I got 2 assists and a protection scoring event for that so yeah....
---
/r/boneappletee
---
Honestly I agree on that, I wish they would bundle survivors at least so you can get a two for the price of one thing.
---
Your right about that one piggy
---
Pretty sure it works on PS4 too. It would be the same interface.
---
gotta stay thicc
---
It‚Äôs better than not having iconic licensed characters at all sheesh
---
Only differences I‚Äôve noticed are lower resolution and longer loading times before games.
---
I barely notice that the frame-rate is different.
---
Why would a kind killer give a hatch to a baby?
---
Looks like you did it digitally to me, and if that's the case, I'd love to see what you can do with a few good pencils and paper.
---
&gt; (like half the maps in the game)
---
Let's be honest, with the additions of the million trees in all the autohaven maps, like 80% of maps are shit for her.
---
Desync. On their screen, they were just at the edge of the exit gate, but saw you wandering like you were. They got stuck on your end while trying to leave the shack, and snapped back to the position they saw when the game was forced to check position due to the hit.
---
Hey boys I‚Äôm in
---
Just a tip, the shoulders should be the same width as the head on each side.
---
imo i never thought Ruin is a perk that can stop gen progression since survivors will get used to hit greats a lot better but it only helps you at the beginning to find someone and then process to put pressure
---
anyway, i'll recommend using PGTW and Corrupt Intervention, these 2 helped me more stopping survivors from doing gens that Ruin ever did
---
The game is a trash map for killers. Literally every single pallet is safe.
---
Not even my stream, you most score real low in the IQ department, don't have kids.
---
Survivor's Wet Dream: At the beginning of the trial, all 4 survivors will receive a tremendously difficult skill check. If all survivors hit the skill check, they will all be teleported into the exit gate and be allowed to escape. All survivors will walk away with 20k/25k/30k free bloodpoints and will rank up 1/2/3 ranks. The killer will lose 50k/100k/150k bloodpoints from their bloodpoint bank and they will derank 5/10/15 ranks.

"Escaping is too hard, why not make it ez! Gg ez baby killer!" ~ Every Survivor Main
---
I think it‚Äôs next to the haunted mansion ride.
---
Yeah, I believe we discussed this before on another thread.
---
Ah, I had no idea.
---
Hey, give it a try. I was also a tomahawk/throwing knife guy back in the CoD glory days (I started when Modern Warfare was new, for reference.) 
---
I'll tell you this much, the sound of that hatchet smacking someone is pure music. I hope it works out for you.
---
I'm gonna try that haha
---
Why would you reward them for running a meta perk?
---
I don‚Äôt think most killers would care. You‚Äôre just going to get face camped for longer.
---
Ah okay, never seemed to notice the static, albeit I just use scaredy cat or whatever the perk is called so ghostface can't get near me.
---
almost seems like a waste spending 300k to find one
---
Ghostface on console is the worst offender of this I've ever seen.
---
Pretty much. You NEED a killer with good map pressure and/or the ability to snowball off of mistakes in red ranks or else they'll get rushed hard. It's a shame that the game is so fundamentally flawed that the highest forms of play boil down to extremes taking place.
---
Here's the thing about the survivor hotboxes: yeah they're inconsistent as fuck but in both ways. I feel the number of questionable hits I've gotten is about the same as the number of almost certain hits I made
---
The idea is that Gen rushing while they are camping will just about end the game by the time the hooked person dies. In which case I would assume face campers would not want to play. I know they don't care about rank but if the game ended only getting 1 kill I think they would stop.
---
You mean ‚Äúgetting grabbed‚Äù right? ü§£
---
Mine is working. Might have to reinstall your game or try restarting your console.
---
But you being killer biased obviously cant accept that because you have that trash killer = good. Survivors = bad mentality. embarrassing. 
---
You really just want ez games with no capable survivors so you can feel good about yourself right? You should learn to go outside of your comfort zone and stop being a whiny bitch.
---
Um, no. Again, stop putting words in my mouth. I never said I wanted "ez games" or "so you can feel good about yourself right?" Get it through your thick skull that I have already said many times on this post that it's not the amount of kills that matter to me. It's the principle of the thing. Higher-ranked survivors should never be going against a rank 15 killer. End of story. Goodbye.
---
Lol, it is a very exhilarating experience, it is why I main spirit. For them yoinks
---
*saw those survivors *

"Must... kill.....nerds"
---
Ah damn. Thank, I‚Äôll reinstall now
---
Love the map even as survivor
---
They really need to add more indoor maps
---
Thanks man I hope it goes well
---
It's you're not your. Learn to English. Pussy didn't accept the challenge :'D
---
In sorry if I sound like an idiot because I‚Äôm kind of a noob but what does SWF mean?
---
So close!
---
‚ÄúNah‚Äù is not an English word nor is ‚Äúfanboy‚Äù so if anyone needs to learn how to spell it‚Äôs you. And I would gladly take you up on your offer if you get DBD on Xbox.
---
Love scaring baby Dwight making him run into a wall
---
I‚Äôm a little bummed that they made it so Ghostface couldn‚Äôt continue to stalk and keep a marked survivors ring red.. I thought that was working as intended and was a beautiful mechanic.  I‚Äôm guessing they mucked it to spoon feed survivors that don‚Äôt know how to literally just look behind them for the reveal during a chase.
---
I noticed he's getting quite popular alright. That mori animation is priceless. 
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
None of them are must-buys. As other people said, Leatherface has BBQ, which cuts down the BP grind significantly. Myers has a variety of gameplay styles that are accessible through add-ons. Ghostface is popular, but not on sale. Hag and Spirit are fun for bullying. Survivors are generally just a shortcut for getting their perks, unless you really like how they look.
---
But really, I'd say just get the ones that seem fun. That's what's most important.
---
That just describes all of them!
---
How would you know what it is? Does it tell you it‚Äôs thrill of the hunt?
---
Hey, screw that, give me an Ace body pillow, I'm not even gay, I just think Ace is an absolute icon
---
Mother daughter ring and prayer beads is extraordinary
---
I'm not sure how. There's no room to mindgame or do any outplays. You just run loops like a bad ai and hope they waste pallets faster than they do gens.
---
Lol yeah, not a lot of people caught on to that! Are you a big Scream fan? Anyway, I can kind of see what you mean about Kate. Just facially she doesn't look much like Sid. I posted [this](https://i.imgur.com/vwXZl5K.jpg) a year ago and I used to main Meg so I could kind of emulate the look :)
---
Yep that's darkness
---
I was playing as leatherdad, and I chainsawed a survivor going through the window, the funny part is that the chainsaw actually hit the wall and stunned me, but still downed her. I felt bad.
---
Honestly, with all due respect as both a survivor and killer I don‚Äôt want this fixed. The intensity when you only hear the ambient noises and your character plus the ability to play your own music in the background? What‚Äôs the harm? The game isn‚Äôt even that much about stealth anymore thanks to infinite‚Äôs, loops of various kinds and how easy it is to just run the obstacle course.
---
That‚Äôs not saying I don‚Äôt want stuff like Michael‚Äôs tier up sound coming back cause I noticed that is almost silent and that‚Äôs not really working for me even when playing as him.  But the music not being overly loud and obnoxious is a HUGE improvement. I get it, it was designed to kinda make it easier to escape chases, but you can still escape chase without the music via line of sight. Sure, they can pick it back up if they hear you, but you‚Äôre able to bank your progress toward the emblems as a chase that was won.
---
Injured music? Is that a thing?
---
Exactly the same for me. I had two of the remaining survivors stay and die in endgame, they were nice.
---
Is the green one Plague?
---
Why do hate him? He‚Äôs right
---
clownfuckers stand together.
---
brothers of the leatherfuckers.
---
allies of the trapperfuckers and the doctorfuckers.
---
today we fight for our pillow rights.
---
This being a perk would be really good, but if the second part is also included the other survivors would need something to know if the survivor is using the perk, maybe something like showing the perk very small close to their health status like how a broken survivor have a small icon close to their health status, I don't think the killer should see it. I also think this perk would need something else to be good, maybe something like getting out of the hook if the exit gates gets power up but I think this would be too op, maybe something else to make this perk a little more useful. Thank you for reading my idea, I hope you have a good day
---
This post and the comments in it are why this game will die.
---
That shouldn‚Äôt of hit
---
Hi Popeye
---
Actually statistics show that at high ranks (ranks 1-5) Plague is in the top tier list for kills. So why she might be shit at low ranks(noob killers) she one of the best in higher ranks (pro killers).
---
No, I seriously can't remember the injured music y'all are talking about. Maybe because I play killer most of the time
---
If you‚Äôre on PC play on low settings. You can see the killers red light way better and it glows through walls.
---
Watch and observe some really good players on YouTube and then implement it in your game play. I watched a lot of no0b3 and Demi and I caught on quite quickly how to run efficiently and read the killers.
---
Learn how to use your camera angles efficiently to always have eyes on the killer. 
---
Observe how the killer plays, if he doubles back a lot or moon walks corners. Through that you can make your moves accordingly to counter.
---
Most mind games are 50/50 chances no matter how good you are.
---
Practice practice practices.
---
nice.
---
Awww that sounds like a part of heaven honestly, I would live to be able to do that where I live!
---
Nah, you bring a med-kit with two instaheals...
---
Jesus christ lmao
---
Survive with friends, queing with a party instead of random people
---
This sub is 70% killer mains jerking eachother off so I don‚Äôt get why this post is needed.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main.
---
Simple math would say yes.
---
thx for the tips. yeh first thing i did was change some settings in the files (the unbannable ones) to make it so the killer's red stain is huge and it's easier to see around the map.
---
Ive actually seen the opposite while playing as ghostface where some hits should of clearly hit. But .most of these problems are due to not being dedicated servers.
---
Pig and Meyers look pretty similar
---
Sounds like we're in the same boat. My wife is a survivor main, and the only messages she ever got (before changing her privacy settings) were when she played killer for rituals.)
---
Anyway, what I do is be a decent killer. If someone plays fair, maybe I'll carry them to the gate/hatch if they're the last alive. I don't camp. I don't tunnel. Occasionally, usually after a few drinks, maybe a teabagger or hook diver will get some special treatment, but overall I try to just play nice. Perpetuating all this toxicity isn't helping anyone. I'd rather be "that one good killer" than one of the myriad face-camping jerks.
---
Coudl you please tag /u/frcdstcr for me? Because he seems to not accept that simple fact.
---
Dude if only there would be such icons for items too
---
ACE MAINS RISE UP!
---
You don‚Äôt need to change files and I wouldn‚Äôt advise doing so. Just go to setting and turn your graphic settings to low.
---
What is the 80‚Äôs suitcase?
---
Once upon a time, after hooking one person, two people body blocked while the third cleansed a totem. It was haunted grounds. 
---
*they dun fucked up*
---
*yes*
---
You don‚Äôt need to change files and I wouldn‚Äôt advise doing so. Just go to settings and change your graphic settings to low.
---
Uh yeah he hit you, with the wind carrying the electricity intensified with his instinct for hitting you . For reference I present Ultra Instinct Goku :
---
To lazy to post reference, but I'm sure someone could make a meme of it.
---
I was saying that 2 kills 2 escapes is seen as balanced and. The. Devs. Dont. Care. About. Your. Feelings. In. This. Case. Its. A. Fact.
---
And you cant accept that. If 2 kills 2 escapes happened that automaticly means that the match was balanced.
---
Legion boring. Nah Billy is boring. Chainsaw after chainsaw after chainsaw. At legion introduces makes you mend. Billy just one hit you.
---
I have an eidetic memory so this doesnt happen, problem is i need to take attention to be able to remember things lmao
---
Play a game as survivor and get injured, then escape the chase, you'll hear it.
---
oink
---
that is bloody amazing
---
Nah that's the new survivor power. Instant-transmission. Work in progress.
---
Isn't that a smart thing to do? Why would you injure two people when you could just make sure one dies?
---
Sorry if this behavior is perceived as toxic, I'm new to this game.
---
I also don't have Dbd, but I really like this game and I like to see some streamers here in Brazil playing it, even with all the problems, I think it have a great potential, so sometimes I come here to show some of my ideas, feel free to come here to talk about your own ideas too
---
Surviors who did nothing all game, just running out of the exit gates when their opened by the useful teammates and t-bagging. Hows that one?
---
F
---
I changed the file where your settings are located. Like graphic settings and fps cap and stuf like that. Unbannable
---
I only care for the bloodpoints. The day I stop receiving bloodpoints is the day I stop playing altogether.
---
Because he let you do gens and leave, right?
---
Which is especially weird considering how Tru3 always moans about how this game should be fun for everyone.
---
Sparing 3 killers, its not worth it to tunnel the OoO user due to the sheer amount of distance they can get when they recognize you're coming for them. Actually downing them is a whole other issue depending on who you're playing and if the user is good.
---
Well since survivors are basically just skins, here is my personal opinion regarding how useful they are perk-wise. Forgive me, I don‚Äôt honestly recall who is DLC and who is not. 
---
Nea 2/3
---
Laurie 1/3
---
Ace 1/3
---
Bill 1.5/3
---
Feng 1.5/3
---
David 2/3 
---
Quentin 1/3
---
Tapp 0/3
---
Kate 1/3
---
Adam 1.5/3
---
Jeff 2/3
---
Jane 1/3
---
Ash 1/3
---
Killers are a bit tougher since of course in addition to perks, they play differently. Again, heres my personal opinion though it really is gonna vary among people. I only say this as someone who has all DLC and has tried them out a decent amount, so don‚Äôt take it for fact just my own experience. (: 
---
Myers - Fun 3/3 - Perks 1/3
---
Hag - Fun 2/3 - Perks 2/3
---
Doctor - Fun 1/3 - Perks 2/3
---
Huntress - Fun 1/3 - Perks 1/3
---
Freddy - Fun 1/3 - Perks 2/3
---
Cannibal - Fun 1/3 - Perks 2.5/3
---
Pig - Fun 3/3 - Perks 2/3
---
Clown - Fun 2/3 - Perks 2.5/3
---
Spirit - Fun 3/3 - Perks 2.5/3
---
Legion - Fun 1/3 - Perks 1.5/3
---
Plague - Fun 1/3 - Perks 1/3
---
Ghostface - Fun 2/3 - Perks 1/3
---
Again thats just my personal opinion. I advice you watch gameplay of these guys though and read up on the perks. If I had to give you one killer option, I‚Äôd have to say Spirit... though Pig is near and dear to my heart as well.
---
Ahhh, it brings me back about 1.5 years ago.  Truly, an awful month. 
---
Side note: Please tell me he got hatch.
---
It is.
---
I think it would've more been the studio not extending likeness rights than the specific actor since it was a pretty high profile movie at the time
---
Naww, they just always pop fast nowadays.
---
This is amazing üò≠
---
Nope. He's basically an M1 killer.
---
People who say "Oh they're better now because 115%" aren't considering that they have an almost completely useless power.
---
Dude yes, I forgot how annoying that is on wraith
---
It's just a  poorly designed map!
---
Lalatina
---
You'd be surprised, So would they. 
---
Since all stealth killers are null and void while having one of your teammates running this
---
His response in the end was really fucking lame.
---
They didn't. He started playing DBD and discovered he was in the game by accident. That's what pissed me off, they didn't even try. The dude is a fan now, he probably would've given consent if they actually gave a shit
---
Tbh this is better than most fanart
---
What‚Äôs the original
---
Thank you! I looked up online all the acronyms for this game so now I kind of get the gist of it
---
My luck would have been the person on the hook kills himself right after the hatch guy escapes and I don‚Äôt even get to try to kobe.
---
Side note, fuck that Myers for hitting on the hook.
---
Good point, maybe something like if the killer is in a chase the time goes normal, but I don't know, we need to find something to punished the survivors in this case. Thank you for reading my idea, I hope you have a good day
---
Tru3 only runs no ruin on killers with good map presence/powers that can mind game pallets (Nurse, Spirit and Hag basically)
---
It's an add on for the map to mark things.
---
Sprint burst in 2019 :(
---
*claps* a mufuckinnnnn hagggggg
---
It's pretty constant.
---
In theory its nice, it's just that I find I don't really get stacks ofter because my obsession will trip my traps.
---
M&amp;A with NC is a good consistent combo.
---
When you cleanse a totem and the killer is running the perk ‚Äúhex: thrill of the hunt‚Äù it will give a notification on the left saying ‚Äúcursed: thrill of the hunt‚Äù which means it gives a notification to the killer you are on a totem, it is on any totem, even if it‚Äôs not the thrill of the hunt totem
---
Boom. Instant PSN ban for at least 2 weeks
---
At least you‚Äôre consistent.
---
Try to stop being ‚Äúunsportsmanlike‚Äù in game by the way. That‚Äôs a great way to get banned /s
---
I've blocked you because you are being rude, can't seem to get it through your thick skull that I don't care about kills (which I have told you multiple times, and are quite frankly being harassing by making multiple accounts to talk to me after I've blocked you. Fuck off and stop trying to contact me.
---
Imagine being salty killers can prevent window looping
---
Yeah clap them booty cheeks
---
Fair enough I have a headset so I can hear footsteps and injured survivors so I don‚Äôt really need to see scratch marks
---
Yes you dont care about kills. So what? I was saying the kills part because you cant accept tve fact that your match was fair. Do. U. Understand?
---
Bruh, the weapons are usually 3 feet long dildos.
---
Haha what a high effort post!
---
YOUR FUC \* \* NG amazing, will you make the other survivors? can't wait for Meg and David King
---
lol wow, nice
---
Ash getting Moried by a Babylonian high priestess.
---
I lol'd but also you have such a charming little kitchen!
---
Lets get things straight, why are you switching in the first place
---
Probably to derank
---
Cosmetics I think.
---
I swear I could read salty video game messages all day. I wonder if that has it's own sub? Either way, thanks for the laugh dude!
---
It‚Äôs not the game, it‚Äôs your console. It must be super dusty on the inside, have no more thermal paste, or just in a hot environment. I replaced my thermal paste and cleaned the entirety of my console ( all the way down to the motherboard ) and now it‚Äôs pretty quiet.
---
Wtf do you have all those ruin perks
---
If the hooked survivor took even a second earlier to die, you wouldnt have made it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Buy a lottery ticket.  Luck like this is Ace levels.
---
Thank you
---
Toolboxes, especially with Brand New Part. Leader. Spine Chill. 
---
It is perks or toolbox add-ons.
---
I don't think it's bad. I would actually think of this as a style for menacing characters like the doc, trapper, wraith
---
That is the most precious thing I've read on this thread, bless his lil baby heart
---
This is like the third post today I‚Äôve seen talking about this after the latest patch
---
Killers: This is a survivor main sub and they‚Äôre the ones that BM!
---
Survivors: This is a killer main sub and they‚Äôre the ones that camp and tunnel!
---
And the cycle continues....
---
Damn, I will never be this good
---
All those ruin perks? You mean hex perks? Yes I have access to all of them... isn‚Äôt that common? I just often run builds with haunted to troll greedy survivors
---
why are the gens super big now?? i noticed that when playing today
---
One game i was going to let the last person escape, but they didnt open the gates (I shut the hatch for BP)
---
They didnt open it, even when i hit it. They died.
---
Wow! Nice job where did you get the weapon and bell?
---
Imagine playing a video game for 12 hours
---
Yes I meant hex, and why do you run them all at once I mean
---
The David I have in DR2C has a beard, but I'm starting to think he looks better without it.
---
I might makes some alternate outfits for the other Survivors. Possibly a Bun version of Feng or a Tuxedo Ace without his hat and glasses.
---
Nobody thinks he‚Äôs unfun to play. Everyone thinks he‚Äôs a shit killer to do well with.
---
Either everyone else was always Dead, or you got to your second stage on your first hook
---
SALLY S T O P
---
Prove thyself üòçüòç
---
I LOVE CORN FIELDS ALMOST AS MUCH AS I LOVE NOT HAVING A SINGLE LEVEL 3 PERK
---
Happened always
---
u/uwutranslator
---
The other day 2 Megs thought I was farming because i didnt hit them.
---
***I moried all of them with Judith's Tombstone and Tuft of hair.***
---
I‚Äôm normally not a dick... but farmers piss me off. :/
---
Do you have bbq chili perk? If not I would go Leatherboi. If you don't have Ash, I would get Ash because well, he shits in the tall grass.
---
Hmm, then maybe i got lucky? Not sure then
---
Given that they've said most games end with 2KS, I'd disagree with this. I think what I said was clear in my TL;DR - make pipping emblems based on overall outcome, not individual events and specific quantities. Gatekeeper is the best example of this. Generator progress on a 9 minute timetable.
---
Pour one out for my homie who suffered at the hands of p2p connections.
---
Yes it does.
---
It's also for the chapters from the PS store, at least in the US
---
It's all on YouTube btw
---
Salt
---
Man, I saw your BK Myers first and thought that was a nice spin on the name for the addon loadout but this takes the cake over the other one. I fucking love this and I dont know why
---
Plague pillow
---
And then this ruins the experience for new players. P3 red and purple rank players griefing newer green rank players, which in turns makes this already problematic game even worse. I don‚Äôt know if I can blame them but fuck is it unfair.
---
Lmao is this a leak or a visual bug
---
Same for me I have 2 cats
---
Me most times I play Killer, except usually I'll just sit back and wait for them to finish the last gen so I can open the gate and make them get out.
---
I relate to this hardcore for obvious reasons.
---
The Surviving Dead: Season 1
---
Ok but the music when you're slugged is like nightmare levels of loud I hate it I wish they let you turn it down in the menu
---
Lisa has had it up to here with your pallet looping BS.
---
You could have moried on death hook instead of after the first hook. That's what i usually do when i bring a mori. Unless someone is being super toxic/annoying.
---
TELL ME WHY IT ALWAYS TAKES ME 3-4 FUCKING JIGSAW BOXES TO GET THE FUCKING PIGS RETAINER OFF MY SKULL?!?
---
I‚Äôd do the same thing, fuck you from me lol
---
why is there a rework then?
---
Sometimes I'll run up to a hook to punish the rescuer and find only the injured guy at the end of the scratch marks I'll just shake my head at him and run away from him
---
Michael be like:üòêüî™
---
These are always my favorite moments. I trapped myself infront of this Jake. He pointed and nodded, I shook no and backed away slowly. We became friends after
---
Bruh it‚Äôs still a nerf, call it ‚Äúadjustment‚Äù or whatever bs you want that‚Äôs the point he‚Äôs making lmao
---
what?
---
Its still the same, it just doesnt effect DS anymore
---
Because fun and good aren't the same thing, and once you get out of the lower ranks, he's horrible compared to other Killers. I think playing Trapper is a lot of fun, and I hate playing Nurse, but that doesn't mean he's good and she's not.
---
Shit is gay though. I don't play toxic or tunnel anyone until I see a survivor sandbag a teammate or do some toxic shit first
---
Imagine not having a job and being a kid üò±
---
Sheesh... what a maroon...
---
Welcome to the killer club bro!! It happens often but don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôve had salty comments too, but I like to turn those  moments into constructive criticism and give them feedback on why they lost, some survivors are cool if you explain why and how you beat them, some just get even madder because they realize it was their fault. Don‚Äôt let it get to you. Keep up the good work.üëç
---
It's "normal". always wait on the PS4, and spam the button to log in, the more you stays in this screen, the worst it is. If take to much to log, restart the application.
---
This happen because the title screen has no fps cap, so the PS4 just go wild trying to get the higher.
---
I took a hook saving that mans after this too ahahah

Smh entitled survivors not even getting the 6% more that is possible
---
FUCKING WHAT???
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs confirmed camping and possibly facecamping are not reasons to report, if correct they showed a list (I could be wrong) so I stick to camping as trapper with my insidious perk (aka the ‚Äú4 seconds stand still invisibility‚Äù perk) and my nifty traps on the other side of the map to hurt em good since I can‚Äôt do anything this far away. So go nuts mate!
---
If u dont like them teabagging at the exit. Spirt with nobody escapes death does wonders sometimes
---
First of all. My name is L I T E R A L L Y Claudette. IRL. I play Pig at rank reset. I play Nurse now, when I‚Äôm rank 2. With no add ons. Occasionally Spirit, and (usually) OWN survivors. What do you mean downplay? DS and Borrowed time are anti tunnel perks, which are perfectly countered simply by not playing like a bitch
---
Actor doesn't have to IIRC - their likeness as a character is owned by the production company.
---
Lord Herman has achieved Ultra Instinct.
---
Sorry typing mistake, but since its can't be used for DS anymore, i guess most walkers won't take it into the game.
---
I don't know who "The Scream" is, but Ghostface just came out.
---
It looks like he picked the musclebound option in runescape.
---
walkers?
---
If you mean M1 Killers, it still works the same with Spirit Fury, which is its main use anyways
---
Nope it's all the same from what I seen besides this weird "bug"
---
Large wp.
---
Imagine things.
---
Today I had a group of Swf tbag me. Good thing I brought a mori
---
Impressive
---
Just, awful use of the meme.
---
Blood Hound+Sloppy Butcher is great though.
---
Big oof
---
So you want to Boop the Snoot?
---
If a killer gets 4 kills every match that means he is too strong. If a killer gets no kills every match that means hes weak. Its simple maths as the othet guy said. How can this be so difficult for you? The games whole point is to get kills or not be killed. Are you sure youre playing the right game?

These are tm8s I get huh? Throw down god pallet when killer is a mile away, throws down reg pallet when killer isn‚Äôt in sight, speed vaults windows when the killer probably doesn‚Äôt know you‚Äôre there, purposefully drops from places without Balanced Landing, prolonged 360-ing, feelsbadman.

Go fuck yourself lmfao acting like I started it gtfoh

Once I had one survivor hooked and all the others ran up one after the other immediately to try and unhook her even though I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to leave, and they could clearly see the pile of bodies already there!

The first time I realize its not valid for DS, I have been stunned where I was for seemingly 1 min with an enduring  icon, bloody hell : (((((

Oh ok, I will look him up thanks! :)

Thank you. Probably one of the best escapes that I‚Äôve had, granted haven‚Äôt played this game for longer than most people
---
That‚Äôs why I say it. Also because I never remember peer to peer since that‚Äôs like at least the 3rd time I‚Äôve been corrected this month.
---
Yup, git gud against a killer who can rotate across the entire map in 10 sec. And then you even had to use add-ons too, what a shitter
---
Omg when I get the Hillbilly insta-down from across the map on the first rev within about 10 seconds of the start of the game it‚Äôs my favorite. DC 50% of the time.
---
Don't they piss  everyone off tho
---
Hey man if ya got nothing better to do and all your friends moved and live a town over might as well play a game I enjoy
---
Okey dokey
---
Yeah 2 hours ago when this was a little more fresh that wasn't the case.
---
Time passes and things change as it turns out.
---
For the better, in this case.
---
Kinda wish I could go 1 match without running into god tier players or ghost face as of recent, seeing as how I‚Äôve just started trying out another survivor. There‚Äôs really nothing I can do, it‚Äôs my first encounters with ghostface... as a survivor I never played before. I can‚Äôt get good if I‚Äôm playing out of my element against a killer out of my element if I‚Äôm more adjusted to others.
---
Sorry for this unnecessary comment on your post m8. Just kinda upset about this.
---
**I said...**
---
#GIT GUD.
---
As someone who plays on console, console players are absolute morons, usually casual players who have no wtf they‚Äôre doing
---
He started nothing though, he stated you're salty because killers can hit through windows and you jumped to "You're stupid I'm better than you cause I don't have a life outside this game." Please, check yourself before you begin to feel justified in being a prick.
---
Haha nice one Rancher Hillbilly w add-ons that thinks he‚Äôs good, you got me there
---
No 'Must buys'
---
Getting the Cannibal for his perks is a good idea, but beyond that just research them and see who looks fun to you
---
Never did I say I was better I was implying I had more experience doesn‚Äôt mean I was better don‚Äôt assume
---
Oh man, what a roller coaster of fuck ups. I wasnt sure who to root for.
---
I mean, the attatchments are there for a reason
---
**so why not fucking use them??**
---
But I can clearly see nobody on this thread plays enough survivor to see the issues with hitboxes lmao
---
Who couldn‚Äôt resist that booty? Killers can‚Äôt that‚Äôs for sure. It even turns the female killers into lesbians! As seen by them chasing her
---
\_[‚Äò-‚Äò]_/
---
Oh I'm sorry, you can't hide behind "that's not what I meant don't assume." You clearly implied your opinion is more valid than his because you have more experience than he does. Again, check yourself man. About to wreck yourself.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?

---
I'm still new to killer but Legion is my favorite. I feel Feral Frenzy is great for tracking where people are on the map with killer instinct. It's helped in swf when someone is trying to camp out a gate and the like.
---
lots.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs not the game, it‚Äôs your console
---
It is 100% the game. Your hardware might not get so hot for whatever reason (your city temperature, better thermal pasting, etc) but that screen does cause your equipment to run hotter than it normally would while gaming. 
---
While gaming in DBD, at 99% GPU usage, my graphics card temperature would go as high as 51¬∫C. Sitting in that "press button to continue" screen, it would get way hotter, about 61¬∫C. 
---
61¬∫C still is acceptable but that is not the point. The point is, that stupid screen (and also offering screen) causes overheating for some reason.
---
My friend also got the same behavior on his system.
---
maybe it‚Äôs cause you‚Äôre playing big bird? jokes aside, this hurt to watch
---
That‚Äôs pretty much exactly what games are. 1 dude on gens, 1 *or more* dudes looking for a gen/totem because they can‚Äôt work through ruin. 1 guy running after the person being chased to save with a flashlight/pallet stun, or at least trying to be chased, and 1 dude chasing.
---
Any combination of those with the occasional chest/totem/hiding in a locker person. Then when someone get hooked either, everyone rushes for the save or everyone is sneaking around trying to get in position to save.
---
Normal games are never 3 people on gens and 1 being chased until all gens are done, especially when ruin is in play and no one can hit their skill checks, that high level of play is only even in rank 1 try hards or SWF depip squads. 
---
Therefore the term gen rushing was created because survivors didn‚Äôt like it when they did that and were called try hards. Since honestly they aren‚Äôt even trying hard they are just doing what they should be doing. The game is just so poorly balanced around players that are doing the objective the way it should be done that it was then deemed try Harding, or its more we‚Äôll known term
---
Gen rushing.
---
Thank you for coming to my ted talk.
---
People do though, but they can put their salty entitlement away long enough to acknowledge the actual problem. It's lag, not anything with the hitboxes themselves.
---
It's only the base. You actually get an entire new cosmetic when you prestige, so you can't apply the bloody effect to anything else.
---
Someone need a hug?
---
Will have to give that a try thanks
---
1 IQ: Wait til the killer leaves to safely unhook 
---
10 IQ: Wait a few seconds to see the killer start to leave and rush for the save while their back is turned or dealing with a distraction
---
100 IQ: Immediately run up to unhook teammate in front of the killer
---
1,000 IQ: Body block the hook long enough to be downed before teammate has even been hooked
---
10,000 IQ: Entire team throws themselves at the hook ready to die for the Entity
---
Again, I will remind everyone, I was heavily insulted and downvoted for suggesting that the last survivor, on their first hook, should still get the chance to escape the hook. If that dude on the hook had for a couple seconds sooner, this would have never happened.
---
That's how it is already besides puking on fountains.
---
It was recently fixed why are y'all pressed ?
---
Idk... some people think BP is important.
---
I think David Tapp looks somewhat like Glover
---
This is why I said this "hottix" was a bad idea. Yes there were issues with not being able to spot him in the open, but there were _also_ issues with being spotted through walls and after you had ducked into cover. I said multiple times "If they just fix the survivor side of the issue and not the Killer's then this update will kill GF" and got brigaded but here we are.
---
Alright, sweet! Thanks. People kept talking about how they put the mother bear head or other masks on the Huntress with her bloody body cosmetic and it turned the mask bloody? I don't know what that was about but it really threw me for a loop
---
Yep, that's the only thing stopping me from making the switch to killer. Survivor games are almost instantly filled lobbies. Killer lobby takes forever to fill.
---
It‚Äôs not lag I have a 100mb ps lmao are you kidding me so you‚Äôre going to blame latency and lag on me getting sliced being 5-10ft out from the window yea fucking right
---
You are the true hero.  I never encounter killers who do this.  
---
I don't think I deserve to escape, but when shit like this happens I also don't think I deserve to be down.
---
You‚Äôll get used to it soon enough.
---
Connection. It‚Äôs not hitboxes that are an issue.
---
Yh used to hate people like you tbh lol but after playing killer I completely understand. Survivors are soooooo toxic and with the Almost infinite loops still in the game you gotta do what you gotta do
---
Take save the best with you, it is staggering effective; nevertheless, if the gate is opened, dont bet on it buddy
---
If it is actually as bad as you are claiming, then that would mean you are getting hit in the doorway of the killer shack while the killer is at the window. Unless you are lying then yes thats lag.
---
I assume you play on steam. I can tell you that on PS4 killer queues were almost automatic before Ghostface was released. Since his release killer queues have become remarkably saturated so that may be a contributing problem. Again I don‚Äôt play on Steam so idk the landscape.
---
Then I‚Äôm getting 2-5 feet hit away from the window it‚Äôs bullshit
---
I just unlocked adam for deliverance and the pebble.
---
Doing the main objective is not considered gen rushing. So if they don‚Äôt have ruin, &amp; we don‚Äôt have a fuck tard teammate chasing the killer, who is chasing another survivor, by your definition that‚Äôs gen rushing. 
---
Or after ruin is gone, assuming we don‚Äôt have said fuck tard teammate, that‚Äôs gen rushing. Every survivor doing what they are supposed to be doing, when not being chased, is not gen rushing. 
---
Yesterday I had a game against ghost face who had no ruin. One guy ran him around auto haven for 5 gens, &amp; we all got out. Nobody was chasing ghost face to try &amp; help the guy getting chased. Is that gen rushing? Because we recognized that we should probably do the main objective &amp; not be useless to our team, we were being try hard gen rushers. That‚Äôs incredible.

---
Then that is still lag, they removed the momentum loss when vaulting a window but the hurtbox can linger if the connection is poor causing hits to seem like they shouldn't hit. It's lag.
---
FYI as a killer, especially when you're new, it's really hard to see what's right in front of your feet. One time I was trying to hook and the hook prompt wouldn't appear I was seriously like "WTF" for a couple seconds until I noticed a survivor ducking in front of me.
---
Glad that you are enjoying playing again. Always nice to see positivity here. 
---
On the queue times, well, i have been waiting for about 40 minutes at the time of this post for a match. Got 2 lobbies but couldn't get a 4th survivor in either of them.
---
Should never be getting hit that far away never
---
Anybody want it go here
---
I really want up pay as Bill :(
---
Kill O Meter

If only there was a way to check without posting here first? We‚Äôll get there someday

[WTF IS UP WITH THIS WAIT TIME IN KILLER LOBBIES...IT'S 8:45, BEEN WAITING SINCE 8:30. ALL I WANT IS A FREAKING GAME!!!!!!](/intensifies)
---
I mean, that's like your opinion man.
---
I feel like this is backward
---
I despise Freddy, I find him very unfun to play against, but I don‚Äôt mind people using him. Seriously though, can‚Äôt stand the guy as I have no idea how to avoid him (I‚Äôve had at least half a month of experience in this game, cant figure out a way out against him)
---
I have found most green rank survivors are very toxic and tbh I can't blame the killers for being toxic as well. It does make the game worse for good players but until the devs do something about it or at least I start seeing less toxic survivors a toxic killer I shall be
---
I saw this beacon for the first time in hundreds of hours and I was so distracted not knowing what it was I completely threw the game for my team
---
So what is happening is this: You vault the window and keep running, but for the Killer (who has a bad connection to you or vice versa) when you vault the window you pause for just a moment. The game hasn't relayed the info that you kept running to them yet, so they swing and because you got hit on their screen when it catches up you get hit wherever you're at. It's because the Killer is host and what they see goes, regardless of what you see. It shouldn't happen, but that's a side effect of having a p2p vonnection. Servers should alleviate this problem. But for now, it's just lag.
---
I second this.
---
Hell yes! I think the only reason I haven‚Äôt prestiged is that I‚Äôm really happy with the perks She has atm and my cosmetics, Stacks of prayer beads etc. Maybe after unlocking the teachables of a few more killers I‚Äôll go for it.
---
Yeah you learn, treat him like a normal killer and miss skillchecks
---
Fact.
---
tHe KiLlEr CaN rEaCh ThRoUgH
---
Ah I see. Thanks for the explanation.
---
Not only that you get to see if you need to move if the killer comes after you so you can continue working on gens or get to running away before he gets to you. It's better than anything you said in your long list
---
Hey look its Michael Jackson
---
There‚Äôs no way to know which hex totems are which. Sometimes I‚Äôll run my hex build. Ruin, Third Seal, Thrill of the Hunt, Devour Hope. It‚Äôs a fun one to play around with. So many times they just keep cleansing totems because Ruin is on and I get like 5 hooks before they even finish a gen because all they do is look for the totem. Rarely play killer though and I‚Äôm in green ranks. Red ranks would smash that build.
---
So what you‚Äôre telling me is Chief once servers are fixed I won‚Äôt be getting ducked over by some killer that can‚Äôt afford good internet
---
That's a good block. I feel bad for the poor bastard playing Doctor on console. That's some challenge to overcome.
---
Not bad at all. Gritty and dark, it suits him well.
---
One of the most fun killers to play but just gets raped by coordinated survivors. He can‚Äôt do anything against loops and organized survivors can break each other out of the dream state and get saves quite easily.
---
SCP-106 has breached the containment
---
i imagine the spiderman pointing at himself meme when i picture this
---
Dude same. All Hag‚Äôs plus Thrill of the Hunt. Such a fun build. I laugh so hard when they get one hooked due to Third Seal lol.
---
So I've had a big in this games a couple of times on pc where when I try to unhook someone and the progress bar fills it won't unhook them,we had a guy in a hook once and the other three of us were all stood there trying to unhook him and the killer was even watching us too,maybe this bug happened to you too?
---
For the lols. I will run Hag with Haunted ground, Lullaby, Thrill of the hunt, and Devour Hope. I get the best reactions post game.
---
Learn the maps. Cut corners tight.
---
Dude looks like a fuckin denizen from Tranzit
---
no, the good killers will keep using it cause it is still very powerful with spirit fury only ones who wont use it are tunnelers
---
You would think that since LFD was a huge success on console they would allow Bill on all platforms.
---
It‚Äôs not always internet that‚Äôs the problem it could be the location of you guys. Like for example he could live in Russia and you could live in Canada despite having amazing internet the connection will be dog shit.
---
* Screenshot highlighting a salty chatlog.
---
Most Killers use it with Spirit Fury though, and Decisive Strike can easily be avoided after its change.
---
&gt;pig

&gt;bottom tier  
---
Sorry but this list is clearly propaganda made by the Freddy gang.  
---
^^^This ^^^post ^^^brought ^^^to ^^^you ^^^by ^^^the ^^^Piggy ^^^Gang.
---
yeah PC.. I figured new killer meant more people spamming him. 
---
Im still just using wraith and trying to farm bloodpoints to dump into other killers to unlock perks an stuff
---
Legions fine now survivors don‚Äôt care about him anymore
---
lol I got into a game after like 30 minutes... SWF all with flashlights.. oof
---
Apparently it‚Äôs a iffy subject if I go from +7 to -1 comment karma lol. I basically agree though, survivors teabag me when they feel cocky and whatnot, but I‚Äôll still kill them lmao. If I get tunneled i can try to do all I can and my team can rush gens, but it‚Äôs still kinda just a boring game.
---
At least on PC is reeeaaally bad
---
‚ÄúUhm.. We‚Äôve done a pretty good job so far‚Äù
---
Legion isn‚Äôt a pain in the ass anymore however a lot of people still don‚Äôt like him. I still get dcs on sight at times. Old legion put a bitter taste in some peoples mouths.
---
Seriously, as someone who has had my Huntress axes get stopped by some mystical mime wall but who has been hit by huntress axes so far from my character they wouldn't even give me a haircut, hitboxes are a mess.
---
Yea, definitely latency...
---
What's it do? Faster missed attacks? I ran it early on when i had nothing else better and still a noob, I do not miss those days.
---
exactly, and that makes the perk very unusable, hopefully they fix it next patch
---
Rank 4 is when it gets seriously competitive, yeah.  But earlier than that your team is at least working on generators.
---
Okay thanks
---

It is Thursday now in my timezone....

Eh fuck it.
---
WHY DID THAT DAMN GHOSTFACE SLUG US ALL TO DEATH? DO YOU REALLY ENJOY NOT GETTING BLOODPOINTS?! IF IT WEREN'T FOR NO MITHER THE GAME WOULD'VE ENDED QUICKLY BUT THAT MAN REFUSED TO HOOK ME!
---
Nurse + franklin‚Äôs = profit
---
Dude, I think it's done with watercolor and pencil lmao, notting digital as far as I can see
---
What a mess lmao
---
Do as I do and start a collection
---
I love to play a game with them by closing the hatch, then downing them, let them wiggle out, let them open the door, as soon as they‚Äôre done, down them and drop them so they have about enough time to crawl out.. sometime they live sometime they don‚Äôt :)
---
When I said half a month I meant I spent half a month playing and most of my killer enemies have been
---
Ghost face (as of recent)
---
Hag
---
Freddy
---
literally anyone else
---
In that order. (Most is top, least is bottom) consider ghost face as optional, as I only met him as Meg, the first survivor I‚Äôve tried out that isn‚Äôt Dwight (I don‚Äôt fuck Lockers, I use them to usually juke the killer instead)
---
yet if he loses early game hard enough there is no recovery.
---
With how toxic you have to be for a Survivior to get access to Decisive strike, you should NOT be able to increase the difficulty of the skill check by any means nor should you get to reduce the stun duration by any means. Simple as that. 
---
The new enduring is stronger for what it's designed for now and combos better with Spirit fury. 
---
Buff to EndFury. 
---
Nerf to tunnelling killers. 
---
I approve
---
oof, whelp
---
Low music volume """"issue"""' rip, they accidentally fixed sounds and they're just putting it right back to the nerfed state
---
Thank
---
Charity: The first item you found in a chest(except keys) wound be a rare item with (0/1/2) rare,uncommon,or common add-on. However you are unable to use this item.
---
Did you escape tho?
---
took away a pip with Brutal Killer multiple times already. i just don't pay attention anymore
---
Prove thyself takes away the cooperation speed penalty. It may not give a yellow progress bar, but taking away a negative is the same as adding a positive
---
"Removed the proximity Sound that the Killer generated while in Night Shroud (only his clothes emit sound while he moves)."
---
What exactly does this mean? They got rid of his unstealthy wind noise? Only his clothes emit sounds??? What does that even mean?
---
I get one of those at least every 3-4 games.. turned off my messages while playing dbd and people would start sending me hate mail through friend requests üòî
---
Sometimes I feel this way, but I am a survivor main. Toxicity is on both sides and it‚Äôs sad...I also think some of the recent mech changes have shifted a lot of attitudes on both sides and not for the best. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Fuckkkk yes
---
Eh...sometimes. it really depends how hard. Like if one chase costs 3 gens then maybe. If its like 2 gens its still recoverable
---
Yeah, i seem to be getting a lot more on killer too
---
Yeah they bullied me :(
---
No, mostly it is..
---
I'm talking about the bug where it straight up kicks you out of the game after a match, saying "Rank Update Error" and not giving you any pips.
---
I remember you, yeah he was just out of range to anyone basically.
---
Candyman or The Puppet Master
---
As a killer dedicator, I am entangled to see this, lol
---
Myers. He can stalk whenever he wants. The only thing preventing him from powering up is a solid object. You can break Ghostface out of his power and prevent him from marking you.
---
ah, that, sorry. this one had right after Legion update multiple times then it was gone in couple days.
---
Technically they did, but bc on certain maps the spawns are in clusters so close together, it isn't uncommon for the minimum number of pallets required on certain maps to not get met without forcing double pallets
---
For survivors you really don‚Äôt need any dlc. Most usefull perks are already availabe. (Balanced landing, adrenaline, dead hard, iron will, self care, borrowed time )
---
For killers though 
---
Hag for ruin and devour hope. Both are really strong perks.
---
Leatherface for bbq 
---
Clown for pop and bamboozle 
---
Spirit for spirits fury and haunted grounds.
---
Also i must mention that discordance form legion and thrilling tremors from ghostface are both really strong perks. If i needed to pick one i would go for thrilling tremors 
---
Lastly there are some perks that they are not top tier but worth mentioning anyways 
---
1)Doc - Monitor and abuse
---
2)pig- make your choice 
---
3) myers- save the best for last 
---
4)plague - infectious fright and corrupt intervention.( good gen slowing perk for prep killers)
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs peer to peer issue cause for the killer you are closer than you are on your screen.
---
your teammates are fucking potatoes
---
Even better crouched silent ghostface walking right next to you
---
We do. Klick the start/options button and it‚Äôll open a window where you can see the match details
---
You can‚Äôt blame people for thinking hot peopleüò©ü•µ are hotü•¥üëÖüí¶
---
One dude is ‚Äúfarm or back out‚Äù but yeah the killer is the one ruining everyone‚Äôs experience
---
*remember you have to die
---
Whaddya think I am? A philosopher?
---
You shouldn't be asking reddit, it's up to how much you think she's fun.
---
If you mean to ask how good she is as a killer, she's decent, with some skill she has potential to be better than decent, but there's some rng that can help or hurt you as well.
---
Unrelenting is pretty awful. You should never plan on missing your attacks. Even the odd time you get fucked over by auto-aim or by survivors baiting vaults, 20% doesn't make that much of a difference.
---
His electricity used the car as a medium to get to u and down u
---
That‚Äôs some bullshit right there
---
This is extremely important. Killers have to wait 5-15 minutes every game to get bullied by a group of toxic survivors (there is at least 1 toxic survivor every game)
---
Survivors queue really fast and they don‚Äôt always have to stay through the whole match if they lose.
---
When survivors fail it takes a few minutes, when killers lose it takes 30 sometimes, +next queue.
---
Also I‚Äôm not kidding there‚Äôs 1 or more toxic survivors every match. This is not necessarily because survivors are more toxic, but you always get a sample size of 4 at a time, so the chances are higher that at least 1 is a bully. 
---
TLDR;
---
Survivors are toxic more often because there are more of them and they have insanely more power and agency in a match, much more opportunities to bully. Additionally, the queue time disparity makes it feel so much worse as a killer. A survivor can just be in another match in a minute or 2.
---
If you spam L1 while healing the skill check will fail immediately
---
It‚Äôs truly sad man. I‚Äôve never gone against a Freddy, and I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs because no one plays him. I‚Äôve heard he‚Äôs one of if not the worst killer in the game.
---
I am really confused. What are you saying?
---
i haaaate anyone that can teleport, ex. spirit, hag, nurse, etc. but myers, ghostface and doctor are my faves
---
Look at that JACKED doctor!
---
This post hurt my soul as a Pig main. She has so many adorable and unique sounds from the Squeaking, to the lion's roar + ambush shriek to the Jigsaw Box Billy laugh.
---
I have a stigma against console play more than one against console players. Keyboard and mouse just allows for smoother tracking which free up the players movement. Some plays you simply cant make on console because you cant turn around quick enough. Also some killers become much less strong (nurse being a big one) because you cant flick. The reads and gamesense however that console players have is very real and equal to PC counterparts. Im sure that an experienced console player would be just as strong on PC and vice versa after a small adjustment period.
---
Well desync can be a result of bad connection
---
Whenever I play killer I never get these hitboxes, but when I play surv I get hit from across the damn map
---
That killer was new to the game, you did well but don't expect that to work more than 1/10 times
---
 Finally a category Freddy can excel in. Scary noises.
---
I mean it‚Äôs quite literally self explanatory but if someone has yet to ‚Äúconsider‚Äù themself a ‚ÄúKiller‚Äù main or a ‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äù man (As they enjoy both at the moment) Would they be applicable for a ‚ÄúSurvivor mains‚Äù perspective and thus able to comment their favored killer to vs?
---
Awesome
---
Asking nicely = entitlement, nice.
---
Thats the post, not including the comments.
---
Myers, pig, ghostface, bing bong boi, spirit without prayer beads
---
Moreso it matters how the killer plays, ive had fun and bad games against everyone in the cast
---
The forgiveness one was a joke
---
You can't break me: If you are the only one\\one of two survivors\\one of three survivors that has been hooked this game, the killer is unable to pick you up if the entity is already summoned for you. Aura of the furthest unhooked survivor is highlighted for the killer.
---
  
---
So the counter to this would be hook every survivor once, that counters tunneling and camping partially
---
it literally is, you need it to buy all your perks and addons
---
of course farming isn't important to killers, we already get more bp than any other survivor in a match and have bbq as a useful meta perk for an automatic x2 bp
---
Trapper, but I find that many Myers players are a bit more generous than other Killers.
---
Im pretty sure it is a new lobby screen since There are balloons in the background
---
Condolences
---
yes i know they can, but a lot of the time it's an unreasonable distance and people defend it with "the killer can reach though silly! :)" even though you're a lot further than they could reach
---
No one said every SWF squad rushes gens, I don't know why that's what you're getting out of this. I said gen rushing exists, it's possible to do it and some people do it. That's my entire point. but go ahead and put words in my mouth since that's easier than having reading comprehension.
---
Ouch it be like that sometimes
---
only 1 lvl of a perk?
---
Aww thankchu
---
What does it mean when there are those spikes o a person?
---
Also I started a match today and a survivor started with not being able to heal themselves and already injured. What causes that
---
Sorry I meant to specify it was ghost face in the edit, I‚Äôm not encountering only Freddy, I‚Äôm encountering only ghost face
---
Me. My GT is AgentNathanSSR
---
when you watch stream it's pretty rare to ever see someone using selfcare in high rank5-1. People got used to bring a med or just to repair gens until someone come to heal them.
---
When there is a self care boy in the team, you know it's gonna be an annoying game...

I would run Surveillance, PGTW, Discordance and either Corrupt Intervention or BBQ. When you don't have perks that actively prevent survivors from completing generators, the next best thing is having locational perks that will allow you to strategically apply pressure, which practically does the same thing. Surveillance, Discordance, BBQ and Corrupt all do this in one way or another. Sloppy Butcher would also work due to how much it can slow the game. Thrilling Tremors could be good, but the long cooldown makes it impractical to use over other and the fact that it activates on pick-up just limits it further. Overcharge is inconsistent due to the fact that it scales inversely with survivor skill. It's strong against weaker players, but virtually useless against stronger ones.
---
I have two posts with too similar messages on them I think involving ghost face. I got confused quick
---
A super good friend who I love to play with.
---
in 99% of situations that would only prolong the game and the killer would still get them.
---
Agreed, I actually abandoned the perk entirely because it wouldn‚Äôt proc when the host is bad. It was a smart idea to make the Killer host but it was poorly implemented as a laggy killer can ruin a full match
---
So the traps only activate after a generator is activated right, so does the trap go off when someone is on the hook?
---

I'm hearing that sound denizens make

What code?
---
Experience doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm better then anyone just means I have more knowledge you jackass sorry we don‚Äôt all do generic ass survivor movements and don‚Äôt use windows and pallets like you
---
A yes, a man of culture
---
Killer is the host. What matters is if he hit you on his screen, which in this case, he probably did.
---
They've tested this in PTB before. It resulted in Survivors continuously looping around hooked teammates in order to buy more time for the hooked Survivor and allow the other two to do gens at a leisurely pace, especially on maps with extremely safe pallets like Coldwind or Badham.
---
It never made live servers, and for good reason.
---
It's okay but it's a waste of a perk slot imo
---
Aye whoa pal don‚Äôt talk about my baby like that
---
Yeah you‚Äùre right forgot about that
---
so?
---
I started running Spine Chill a few months ago due to the youtuber PainReliever saying it‚Äôs one of the best perks, and I gotta admit he‚Äôs right. I don‚Äôt use it as effectively as him but it‚Äôs very strong and great against all killers, especially stealth killers like pig, wraith, and ghost face (though of course not tier one Myers) and it‚Äôs also great against the spirit. I don‚Äôt feel right playing without it anymore lol
---
Fucking Doctor. Hes the absolute worst. Hes just so much of a hinderance that when I hear his static I bang my head into my desk in frustration.

Alright buddy whatever you say you obviously can't handle getting called out on your bullshit so maybe don't make a reddit post about it? You're just another salty survivor idiot who thinks you're better than everyone else because your mom pays your bills so you can play all day. Please fuck off and never waste anyone else's time on this sub again, trash.
---
I wasn‚Äôt going to mori them. I was only running it to see what they‚Äôd do.
---
Pretty much, though he probably would have still escaped even if he hadn't.  Killer's hit doesnt go through until the survivor gets control of their character, meaning he could have basically fallen right in front of the hatch and crawled like 1 foot to it before killer was finished wiping the blood off their knife.
---
Lmao salty survivor main git gud lmao

Story of my life, I get ripped apart in lobbies for this all the time even though I‚Äôm just trying to get rid of ruin

There are a lot of really bad survivors in red ranks. It's not that hard to do.
---
DONT YOU TOUCH BILLY
---
The killer disconnected
---
Sorry, I forgot the /s
---
Same, they are awesome and I feel so bad for not getting the chance to play with them :(
---
I quit the game because of this. I really dont have faith in the devs if they let something as basic as hitboxes in a multiplayer game stay broken like this.
---
And for the record I made that post before end game collapse. But I would still argue it with the new system. I can‚Äôt even count how many times I‚Äôve been the last survivor, getting hooked for the first time with deliverance active, mettle active and dead hard and knew where the hatch was.
---
Yes. It's the icon for it on console
---
It looks more like she's growing a Lenny face.
---
Is the doctor not so great on console? I've been using him myself around rank 9 and he's great.
---
They're the ones trying to force their broken playstyle on other people. They deserve a mori.
---
Farming is boring. Some people are here to actually enjoy the game for what it is, not just earn as many points as possible.
---
Oh coz they don‚Äôt have bill, makes sense
---
It‚Äôs all good lol
---
You did 100 times better than the purple and red ranks I get against
---
Her crouch speed is too slow to be useful and her dash isn't that great. It's best to use it to sneak up on people when you know where they're at like after a BBQ proc. Her traps are usually worthless since they're completely rng. Her dash can be used on loops that are already unsafe anyway, but the speed and surprise might get you the hit.
---

---
Really??? Didn‚Äôt know that tbh thanks for the tip
---
On a side not made a post where I‚Äôm not getting downvoted to shit üòõ
---
The 4% though
---
The fact that you are both playing a game and trying to have fun in your own way. Killer is there to provide adversity and hear the screams, survivors are there to outsmart them and t-bag at the exit gate. The setup already has plenty of opportunity to turn the tables before it gets to the point we are discussing. It just seems like you want more chances to be an ass.
---
I still miss sometimes but not to the point unrelenting is worth it. It's basically training wheels on a perk slot. Sure it can help when you're brand new (and since you're on console it might be a bit better due to framerate and being harder to "track" survivors with your M1) but you should take them off when you feel you're not needing it anymore.
---
Random bit of trivia but back in the day Unrelenting used to affect hit cooldown, which arguably made it much better and the old version of Save The Best For Last didn't have a token system and only required the obsession being alive.
---
[If you stacked them you got this](https://youtu.be/ouFi-lI1Rbs) which was one of the most brutal builds in the game and was promptly nerfed.
---
Def worth a try, no prob
---
That's literally the definition of toxic behavior, and fuck off. This is why nobody can take people like you seriously. You pretend you know everything and yet your only argument or preferred vocabulary is "triggered snowflake sjw, haha I owned a lib because I called him a lib." Fuck off, from a conservative . Toxic playing behaviour is defined as unsportsmanlike, and has been by everyone, of both sides of the political spectrum, in all gaming communities, (which, btw [by the way] has nothing to do with this topic whatsoever, neither does coming out, lovely). Get off the internet if you don't understand simple words.
---
Nice. Had it happen once as well a very long time ago
---
I mean to be fair they are trying to get 60fps
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt even care about the increased speed, though it is a nice benefit. The perk would be just as amazing without it
---
This literally happened to me today, but I had a firecracker instead of a flashlight. It still worked and I felt like a **GOD DAWM HERO**!

Definitely The Shape before he tiers up on the randoms (Or myself), The fact that he actually sneaks around and watches you from a far is quite terrifying.
---
Poor NPC didn‚Äôt even try to escape :(
---
You‚Äôre right but that added speed is like a blowjob on your birthday
---
complaining about toxicity while making a huge blanket statement about a huge number of people and then following it up with ‚Äúyour opinion means dick unless i think it does‚Äù is kinda ironic
---
Yea they really have to do something about this.

Doesn't fix being spotted through walls. Also it seems the detection range add-ons are busted as even if I run both there is no change in how close they have to be to spot me.

Ayy lmao

Myers only has better stealth if you run Dead Rabbit and M&amp;A. Then he loses that whenever he goes EW3, plus he can't lose his red stain after leaving EW1.
---
Perkless, no add-on Ghostface can remove his terror radius and red stain frequently and is just a quiet as Myers.
---
As you should.
---
That would have been the correct play, but the survivor would have had time to put some distance between him and the killer.  Probably not enough to guarantee an escape, but enough to make it a proper chase again.
---
That‚Äôs a useful perk

I quit out strategically so that Killer get less points, before chases if they have a campy killer, Hex Ruins, if I hear heartbeat after unhook, but that's just at low rank cause of the serious smurfing problems this game have.

Honestly, switch over to surivior for a day or two. I find that way more relaxing and i cant care any less about whether i escape or not.

Maybe it's just me but I find when I try to play Doc the game drops frames and gives me trouble to see.
---
If I‚Äôm the last one alive and hadn‚Äôt been hooked yet, it means I either played well or hid the entire game. And if I had Deliverance active it means I wasn‚Äôt just hiding out the entire time. Which leave only the option that I played well. And considering I don‚Äôt get a chance to Kobe, it means I didn‚Äôt get the same opportunities. And implications for the other side? You mean the opposing side? The side that would use any means necessary to kill me? Can I cry the next time I get hit by NOED and fave camped that the killer was a sore loser who wants to win at any cost, regardless of my feelings?
---
Maybe just different areas get sales based on player population ie if I had a game and the American region was losing players I‚Äôd make a sale to put it back up. There could be loads of reasons! I‚Äôve had sales when she‚Äôs not had sales everything does it Xbox store psn store steam etc. Just marketing strategy‚Äôs

This ain't  r/dbdgonewild

So gen rushing is the act of finishing gens fast and no doing much else. Its pretyu much running leader and prove thy self with tool boxes to just pop gens and escape.

Except you can break Ghostface out of his power and prevent him from getting a mark. Looking at Myers does nothing but turn you into a sitting duck. He also doesn‚Äôt have to wait 30 seconds for his power to come back.
---
Can you combine this with Happy Clown¬¥s Colored perks?
---
Firstly I can hardly read half of those sentences, and no I never meant the latter option you listed. You can't ever lose high rank killers in a chase your rank 8 subsides your opinion.

Not a moment too soon for BW to end, great job!

You are calling every other killer a main and saying that one is just a pig... DESCRIMINATION

---
They can‚Äôt do anything. Everyone is just playing killer
---
Well i like the idea for the medusa killer but the perks are way to strong. 30 % speedbuff for failing an attack is an instand bloodlust "6" whenever you want + Nerfing survivor speed by 12 % by looking in their direction + nerfing movementspeed by 15 % with the totem. So your total speed is 145 % and the survivor has a topspeed of 73% wich makes you twice as fast as the survivor. Ouuff thats to speedy my dear
---
Wait why

Solo's been my cream and butter, but last DBD match was fun though, I was teaching a friend the ways of DBD. He thought I was ghostface and screamed and started running when he saw me approach him lol, I was jake in grey clothes xD
---
I play exclusively killer these days, but was definitely a 100% survivor player for the longest time, so if that counts ...
---
My absolute favorites are console nurses who are good enough with her to get stuff done so the game is not boring but not PC-Legacy P3-Rank 1 level frustrating to play against.
---
Followed by Billy and Huntress.
---
Then Spirit if no prayer beads.
---
Similar to you, I don‚Äôt want to play killers that people generally dislike, but for every killer you‚Äòll find someone who hates him. I just play what I personally would enjoy playing against.
---
For example, I‚Äòd tell you any day that I hate playing against Pig because they just camp and tunnel the RBT person (while running MYC of course) and then complain after the game how RBTs do nothing to counter gen rush. But if you play Pig properly she can be very fun for both sides, and that‚Äôs how I try to play her.
---
Could have been SWF. Usually thats a big give a way. Sucks we can't tell who is in a SWF group.
---
I play both as a ying-yang to surviving or killing. I don't consider myself one more than the other. I do play killer more often if friends aren't online (because randos suck since DbD went Game Pass).
---
I have been harassed and threatened since I first started playing, when I tried Hillbilly for the first time and had no idea what I was doing, made a guy rage quite before hooked and proceed to message me and threaten me and claiming I quite the game while I was still in-game killing his friends. 
---
Just this morning I had a level 10 survivor send me a voice message 'Of COURSE you're going to win when you're invisible! How are we expected to survive when he can't even see you?! How's that fair?" And drag on a few seconds longer about how killers get all the good perks and survivors suck. All that in a 14 second audio as a level 10 survivor after I got a pathetic Ruthless killing on his team (Xbox, BillZilla 00).
---
I see survivors do crazy-ass bait moves, playing chicken, using crouch as a weird low defense with the chance of the killer missing overhead... And then going for the teabag. 
---
I have had killers somehow hit me or pull me when they should have been no where near me to do. I have had so many face camping killers teabag while I'm hooked or just keep cutting me when they should know they are 2 generators away from everyone getting out. 
---
I guess what I'm saying is, I appreciate this post. And the love in the comments.
---
Not a survivor main, but do play survivor fairly often.
---
My favourite killer to play against nurse (yes I said it). I love the mindgames, and find her a lot easier to play against than spirit.
---
Yeah I agree with you on this one
---
I don‚Äôt know about what percentage a killers speed is at, but Medusa‚Äôs speed is just a bit faster than the nurse
---
Well, that escalated quickly.
---
I never trust farming killers because of that. I‚Äôm a paranoid young lady, haha.
---
I just find it dumb how you can go into an SWF group as a red rank with a yellow rank and get the latter rank instead of the former or atleast inbetween.
---
When Survivors try to repair the gens as quickly as they can and ignore everything else.
---
Do you just always run high level chase builds and nothing else?
---
poor baby feng :(
---
The DBD version of Quentin looks like a meth addict in a documentary. It sucks because the actor is cute!
---
well that only makes sense, you see 4 survivors for every killer. D'oh
---
Myers and pig. And wraith can be fun at times to go against
---
Daphne Noooo!
---
Run a shroud and don't waste your mori.
---
Regular survivor speed is 100 %
---
Normal killer like trapper is 115 %
---
Slow killer lile hag is 110 %
---
The difference doesnt sound huge, but it is as you may know from games against trapper and hag
---
Nurse is the only killer with 96,25 % speed
---
We need Carlos as a killer. Nothing would fill me more with joy than him beating me up with his clarinet.
---
Yeah so Medusa speed would be like 98%
---
It has been addressed: it is not the hitboxes that are bad, it's the combination of animation, model and connection issues.
---
I love pain reliver, I think he's prob the best dbd YouTuber
---
I've made a new list go check it out
---
Thanks I go for ghostface and huntress and I get lots of asshole messages so thank god someone out there cares
---
Yeah but It does seem unfair for survivor let me change it up a bit
---
Yeah this is big brain time
---
Someone did the math and with no prestige it would take over 2.5k bloodwebs to get every perk in the game on every killer. That's not counting ghostface and his perks, any prestige, ot any survivors. It's honestly insane that the BP economy hasn't changed at all since... when did they add legacy?
---
I also run urban and spine chill and it's super good for juking killers
---
Doctah gang actually
---
1. Ghostface is now almost entirely silent when stalking. If you know what you're doing, you can easily mark people before getting spotted.
---
2. The time between bouts of EW3 is a hell of a lot longer than 30 seconds.
---
:D
---
Once in a match, as soon as a survivor is toxic all "honor rules" go out the window. This works for me because I find I play a lot better when I'm pissed at a survivor (not tilted though). 
---
In this case, my expectations lower because my only objective is to kill that survivor, even if the other 3 escape. Somehow this ends up working out for me because I usually get a 4k, even if I dont play dirty against the non toxic survivors. 
---
So anyway, if survivors are toxic, do not abide by the rules and play just as dirty as they're playing (facecamp, focus, etc). You fight toxic with toxic, you really only need to down one and bait the rest. No fucks given.

SWF SHOULD MAKE YOU MATCH A KILLER THATS CLOSE TO THE HIGHEST RANK IN YOUR GROUP. LEVEL 4 SURVIVORS SHOULD NOT BE PLAYING WITH LEVEL 18 KILLERS.
---
Dbd streamers fault People like OchiDO and AngryPug have big influence since many ppl watch them
---
I would cuddle with lovely Hag everyday, imagining her gurgling seductively in my ear.
---
I literally cannot stop laughing at the idea of sighting a pair of ears peeking up from behind cover as killer.
---
The next event will likely have a new item. I believe old event items do not return to the BW
---
I just thought it was a bit coincidental, is all.
---
Pallet spawns are really unpredictable in general, due to the newer spawn rules, if a the spawn number isn‚Äôt met pallets will just spawn to meet that number, pretty much disregarding any other pallet spawn requirements, if you pay attention in matches this happens you will probably notice complete dead zones in a map and aside from that double jungle gym/shack the rest are pretty garbage spawns for survivor.
---
"Seriously it doesn't take a genius to think os basic buffs like this."
---
Definitely not. This is my post and I'm dumb as hell!

***TIME FOR TREATMENT***
---
The perks are balanced but im not really sure how the power works does he fly over the map because he is half bird? Or more lile the spirit?
---
Looks like we finally found the daylight in Dead By Daylight!
---
Nay be they can make it flappy instead of firm.. i think the original concept dint have firm ears
---
Usually the worse I‚Äôll do is tunnel the person who pisses me off by being toxic but I‚Äôll give it a shot lol maybe it‚Äôll be therapeutic
---
It is a fly, there is a border across the map (hopefully) so they don‚Äôt just go over the wall. You can also see where he is going by the feathers falling from when he is cloaking too and kinda has a trail behind him. Like a black mist.
---
I thinks it‚Äôs so good! Amazing work!

---
&gt; Oh yes that 4% is really gonna kill him. Especially when Stalk Leaning is now stronger but go off hunny.
---
1. it's 4% on both sides of the screen so 8% total. Quick math for you because I see you didn't bother to.
---
2. Actually stalk leaning was always twice as fast. All they did was just reiterated it here in the patch notes. So there goes your argument lol.
---
Every day is arm day

how come that before when they had less you could find games as a killer way faster, it's after they introduced this search for game as a killer thing, the queue's have been broken ever since, i literally spend 15 minutes to find a game that last the same or less....
---
Ghost face bugs 3xploits or glitches?
---
Has anyone else had this happen to them?
---
You're surviving and working on objectives, the killer finds you and, after a chase, manages to put you in the dying state. You go to recover but there is no recovery progression, no bar on screen, and certainly no progress being made as you notice you can crawl despite holding RB. 
---
Killer picks you up, you go for the wiggle bit the killer is effortlessly moving through the space to a hook, your survivor not displaying a struggle but just limply hanging off the shoulder; no on-screen progress bar. 
---
This has happened to me a few times. Maybe upwards of 4 times now, before and after the 3.0 patch. 
---
I feel like its often while against Ghost face. 
---
This Ghost Face was with I'm All Ears 3, No One Escapes Death 3, Deerstalker 2, and Iron Grasp 3 with "Philly" and Walleyes Matchbook. 
---
Nothing to suppress or hide wiggle or recovery progress or on screen prompt. I'm 99% certain there is no perk that can even do that. 
---
I didn't record anything from this particular playthrough but I have this clip from 3 days ago of my playthrough as Jake and running into the exploit/glitch again to send to my friends. 
---
Its not a long clip but hopefully enough to display what I'm talking about. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/tGBLfFG
---
Thoughts?
---
That would be cool. Btw sometimes its still possible to glitch over the mapwalls si i think i would be a thing on this killer. 2 weeks ago i somehow managed to jump over the wall again with my boi billy
---
Oh no, of course, I always envisioned the Bunny Feng skin to have floppy/flat ears, as the concept showed. Just seeing it how it is here, while it looks super great, just makes me chuckle at that idea.
---
Oh. I hope they add wall barriers that are invisible so you can‚Äôt go over it.

Alternatively, use no mither and make the injured music your entire soundtrack

Well dbd always has bugs vomming and going the latest bug is eith the perk wake up i guess. The perk says you can open gates 15 % faster. But atm its not actually work like that. Cause it also buffs your whole Actionspeed by 15 % that means healing, repair, sabo ... atm wake up is the most op perk for survivors lol
---
Oh it is :) It's especially gratifying when they realize they fucked up and then they stop being toxic in an attempt to win you over.
---
 But nah it's too late now.
---
Does Save The Best For Last give stacks on zaps? I never bothered testing it.
---
I'm sorry I made a mistake, I've made a new tier list following these events
---
I might use that perk next time yee
---
I‚Äôm not a pig main but ANYONE CAN AGREE HER STUN NOISE IS TOP TIER
---
Lol idc, I know that this is for jokes and I hope others are as well xD
---
This is probably the most hilarious thing I‚Äôve seen on this subreddit.
---
Hopefully
---
1. Just look around and put yourself somewhere where it‚Äôs hard for Ghostface to stalk you. 
---
2. Myers can use his power whenever he wants. Ghostface has to rely on the Survivors not being watchful of their surroundings. It‚Äôs also harder for  him to stalk while in a chase. If he tries, then he risks losing his power again.
---
I need an actual explanation for what the fuck this is
---
I get spotted when walking off a hill (like Coldwind or Macmillan hill) by someone on the other side. Not my fault and not something I could have avoided.  It's a busted mechanic that was just made worse by buffing survivors.
---
Thank yooouu
---
Not your fault for standing on a hill that‚Äôs visible from everywhere on the map? 
---
You gotta spend a second thought on that one.
---
You call Piggys beautiful oink ''boring''?

I've had enough hate please stop

This guy is a Pig main &amp; is very good, I think you will learn a lot from watching him - https://www.twitch.tv/scorpionz

Resist: Allows you to take a 3rd hit at the cost of only being able to recover at 70% when in the dying state, and have to mend yourself in 20/25/30 seconds.

You can‚Äôt use your power or stalk if someone is looking at you. Ghost Face is essentially a M1 killer, but you can get easy kills early game by catching gen rushers, and tunneling a bit if you have to.
---
(Im only a rank 12)
---
I've become Ghostface main because of that, he's just so relatable
---
Start your lunge before you are seen. For example: behind a wall next to where a gen is being worked on. Start your lunge just before you round the corner. They‚Äôll hear your growl but won‚Äôt know which direction you‚Äôre coming from. 
---
 
---
Strike from odd angles. Come from the outer edge of the map instead of from the center. Can‚Äôt tell you how many survivors I‚Äôve surprised by climbing in the shack window because they‚Äôre too busy watching the doors. 
---
If in a chase, just stay up so you can see where they are going and have your full speed. If you lose them crouch back down and start hunting again.
---
She takes some practice but she‚Äôs more of one of the fun killers IMO. Good luck!
---
i dont see a reason to castrate him
---
Her hiding behind the little wall, not knowing that blood warden shows you the aura made it even more sad :(
---
It‚Äôs just the stealth kit in general. It works for about the first minute in the game (not against Swf) but then it‚Äôs just trapper gameplay with no traps. 
---
What makes Myers great is the fact that his power can down anyone once he gets to T3. 
---
Stealth is awesome but it doesn‚Äôt work well in dbd.
---
Somebody explain why the hatch opened, im so lost
---
You literally can't read can you? I just said that I was spotted _as I fell off one side_ and the Killer Instinct _was on the other side._ There is no way that they could have finished the spot unless they magically can see through walls now. Which they can, as it happens practically every game.
---
Running Devour with a hex perk that is immediately visible(Ruin) is not really logical though because you don't want survivors to know you have devour until you get the exposed effect or even the mori possibly, while ruin just sends them looking for a hex perk and they usually end up finding your devour too
---
I haven't seen one MoM after the Patch
---
Yey
---
It does not

Your actually right haha.
---
EGC looks cool, I guess...
---
I think shes fine wheres shes at ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah,  but if you want to farm might as well use it.
---
You do realise killer is the person who creates the lobby so the fact everyone‚Äôs playing killer would/should not affect queue times, it should only affect queue times if there are dedicated servers , which there is not.
---
i only got to rank 8 this week with friends, and im running the most tryhard build i can get with my perks, but still depip
---
the thing i hate is this... i kobe, I GET DOWNED AND HOOKED... please respect a kobe

https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c5woy8/this_is_it_i_will_never_top_this_escape_and_ive/es4kdb1
---
I feel like if you have the add-ons that make people break faster you can completely skip chases.
---
I think she is good as long as she doesn't have to get looped if you can skip Chase's by knocking people down instantly then you will create pressure by constantly having someone on the hook. 
---
that's just my opinion though I could be a hundred percent wrong since I mostly play survivor
---
that does not really affect it even if they put him in the lobby in two seconds it would still take forever for anyone to join in. right now it is set up it puts you in a lobby right when they find ppl to join you
---
leader doesnt effect gen progress anymore.
---
I am reading the downvoted comments and I don't understand why people downvoted them. It's the same joke about pig lol
---
For me,it's because I'm a Meg main and she has the LOUDEST injured groaning noises. And I don't have Iron Will with her yet...
---
The pig squeaks when you hit her with a pallet.
---
As a Spirit main,  I will hurt you smh
---
[Year 4 Roadmap](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D77W0S2WsAEkudU.jpg:large)
---
EVERYONE DOWNVOTE HIM FOR THIS DISCRIMINATION
---
Both killer and survivor have 4 objectives, it‚Äôs their emblems that they need to get iridescent to get 2 pips etc so gen rushing would only constitute for 2 , objectives and survival so by gen rushing they probably just about get 1 pip and sometimes they don‚Äôt even so it kind of just makes the game really quick and boring
---
Toxic behavior gets punished
---
Theres nothing wrong with body blocking. Body blocking is an extremely effective survival tool, and survivors are actually awarded by two perks for doing so(even though it really doesn't work half the time).
---
Not your grammar though?
---
Your right. My b. Forgot back in jan
---
NOBODY IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT GHOSTFACE IS OBVIOUSLY SLICING HIS LEFT FINGERS WITH HIS KNIFE DURING HIS COOLDOWN ANIMATION AND HE LOOKS STUPID.
---
Then why is it listed as something you can report a player for? That doesn't make any sense...
---
"Game Security Violation"?
---
Because while you are planning an escape you're very vulnerable to failure. Also that I think perks with such an effect need a downside, you can just hide while exposed.
---
But the sale was for the celebration of the 3rd Anniversary. I understand what you meant by marketing strategy however it feels weird when they celeberate only with US players not the whole playerbase.
---
Ah, simpler times...
---
a good trapper never fails to amaze me
---
Well that doesn‚Äôt make sense either as if that was the case , why when I‚Äôm put into a lobby with 1 person more join really quick (and I‚Äôm not talking about swf) if that was the case then after 1 survivor joining my lobby I‚Äôd technically have to wait the exact same amount of time for the other survivors so if it took 5 mins to find the first survivor it would take 15 more minutes to find the other 3 if we are going by what you say
---
So you‚Äôre saying they wait to put you in a lobby when there‚Äôs 4 people to join? Yet you could have 2 people in your lobby but sometimes it takes a minute or 2 for the others join? Man have you even played killer because you aren‚Äôt understanding this, I said sometimes they join extremely fast not every single time as if that was the case you wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell who was swf.   You aren‚Äôt informed enough to be talking about this. Killer queues make no sense you are the one hosting and if it makes you wait for a person to join then lobby waiting should be 15 additional minutes as finding the first person takes about 5-10 mins, therefore it should take the same amount for every when rather it takes between 1-4 minutes to get four people in the lobby. How is waiting 4 minutes mean that the game waits until they find 4 people to make lobby.
---
Do I just copy and replace the icons into that folder?
---
Haven't watched the man, but is it possible that he's playing a KYF with some friends/viewers and is simply using perks recommended to him?
---
That, or he's playing on someone else's account.
---
*or OP is full of it, that's a possibility*
---
Never happened to me when playing killer I always get matched up with ppl the moment I get in a lobby but fair enough man
---
Idk if PS4 version has Easy Anti-Cheat (I think that's what it is) or not, but that's never happened to me.
---
That's what happens when you try to bm instead of leaving when u have the chance lol
---
If it's the part I think you're talking about with ghostface he's just meaning the tier list of killers is pretty much different on console compared to pc which is what he plays. Nurse is the best example of being amazing on pc but kinda bad on console do to having to play with controller
---
All 4 running flashlights is basically free ruin though. Down one and one will drop their gen to save. Slug against flashlights, win every time
---
 I would never combine devour hope with an other hex totem except maybe thrill of the hunt or full hex totem build. Soon as huntress lullaby, ruin or whatver shows up survivor will search for it and prob destroy devour hope instead.
---
At that rank everyone has adrenaline anyways. 32 seconds is a lot of time to be spending off of gens against a red rank killer.
---
I bring in cakes for bloodpoints as killer , if I see everyone has one, then great more bloodpoints. This does not mean we want to farm and especially now, double bloodpoints and events have been going on so long that us killers just want to play the game, never expect they want to farm anymore only if they specifically do or say something that they are gonna farm.
---
For sure
---
I tried staying around green ranks as survivor for two months and then had to try to climb back because the amount of tunneling and camping was 4 out of 5 matches a few days in a row when I tried to play the game. As you can guess I stopped trying after 5 games most of the times and left it at it for the day. Purple ranks are a bit better, but killers can't get many kills unless they also tunnel and camp. I got so frustrated as a solo survivor and decided being in red ranks, facing the same two three killers every game and occasionally getting slugged is way more fun than being tunneled, facecamped or witnessing someone get tunneled etc.  almost every single game. 
---
I feel like just killing myself at the end of the match when I see a killer playing nice, cuz they let me have my fun by not tunneling, so I just want to thank them in a way.
---
and i cant hear the chainsaw from Billy too
---
Honestly I feel like it's also really good to play both sides even if you wanna main one more than the other. Helps to how the other side plays so if you go back to killer you'll have a better understanding of what loops may be strong you didn't know of or how survivors choose to run loops
---
Run Ruin or stop chasing and patrol the gens and make the game go on longer. I play Trapper without ruin but if someone gen rushes I find it more fun. If you play killer and get 4K and 1 or 2 gens are done, then I get bored who tf wants to play easy games?
---
If the survivors are horrible and run in to your arms then what fun is it?
---
The fun in DBD is as a killer being able to outsmart your opponent just like in any game, i don‚Äôt like gen rushing but I thinks it‚Äôs the only actual chance survivors have of escaping, otherwise the game is too easy as a killer.
---
Also Noed is a huge help for gen rushing.
---
He literally let you escape tho
---
I VSED A STACK OF PURPLE SWF AS GREEN RANK PIG MAIN AND THEY ALL USED TORCHES ON THE GIDEON MEAT PLANT AND IT FUCKING SUCKED
---
ALSO KILLER LOBBY TIMES SUCK EVEN WORSE SINCE HOTFIX AND THAT'S BEFORE WAITING ANOTHER TEN MINUTES FOR SURVIVORS
---
The optimal way to play Freddy would be to put all asleep before you start chasing, so that you can utilize the -50% action speed. The main problem is the inconsistency in skill checks. Sometimes you can run no add-on and get better results than if you ran a skill check add-on.
---
spinechill trumps all stealth abi....WTF
---
Aw, that's too bad. 
---
Sad oink.
---
The problem is stealth isn't really something hard to counter in dbd though. All it takes is even someone with decent awareness and he becomes a m1 killer. Plus the fact you can also break him out of stalk without him even having Los on you doesn't help.
---
Yeah, in this case this system would be pretty bad, I think we should also punish survivors in a certain way, maybe if the killer is close to the hooked survivor and is in a chase the time goes normal, I don't know, thank you for reading my idea, I hope you have a nice day
---
What is the horse perk? (Right side)
---
Yo
---
Easier to stay on 50 if you don't care about the cosmetics from prestige
---
There's shitty people on both sides and it is often an us versus them mentality in this sub. But denying the names having validity isn't really fair, they do affect the game. Without even saying a message you can see what they want/expect, and it's not the killers responsibility to do that. And running a mori is fine whenever, you have to change your playstyle. Both sides ruin this game. The best you can do is try not to be a piece of shit.
---
I think the original films are much better than the 2010 remake. Jackie Earl Hayley isn't a bad actor actually, but the script was ass and I didn't like the way this Freddy looked. 
---
The original NoES, the third film and New Nightmare are my favourites from the bunch. Would totally recommend them.
---
Yeah, I think we should also punish survivors in a certain way, maybe something like if the killer is close to the hooked survivor but is also in a chase the time goes normal, I don't know, thank you for reading my idea, I hope you have a good day

---
Wait? Huntress Lullaby does something?
---
Just to be sure, you guys checked endgame screen for tinkerer and silent chainsaw addons right?
---
Its freakin awesome!
---
Is there an original format for this? For scientific purposes
---
haha
---
Not to mention a lot of people seem to think that killers being able to hit through windows is a bugged. It's not. Killers are meant to be able to reach through windows.
---
I feel like a specific lunge type animation when hitting through windows would clear up a lot of confusion.
---
It‚Äôs just better to stay at 50 if you‚Äôre only looking for perks.
---
I don't think the rehab is doing any good
---
Not when I stepped away from the window already and he is lunging from 3 meters away.
---
Reminds me of yesterday‚Äôs game. All gens were done and we run to the exit. I see a hex totem and go like to my mate: ‚ÄûShould I cleanse it?‚Äú, he says: ‚ÄûDo it, it‚Äôs probably NOED‚Äú.
---
I start cleansing it and in the meantime Kate gets chase, then downed by the killer and it is revealed that the killer is indeed running NOED.
---
Well... I finally cleansed the totem and activated haunted ground. 
---
It didn‚Äôt matter as NOED was active but unfortunately we couldn‚Äôt save Kate :(
---
hot
---
I can tell you. 
---
GF has been such a enjoyable killer since release, his power is annoying and the people who play him are also annoying
---
The constant Tbags and camps (Love getting tbagged for no reason just bc i play survivor) are getting on everyones nerves 
---
Before you write "sTo0peD suRvIV0R maINs aLwAYs crYinG" or somthing like that
---
Yes, i main survivor. But its tiring just getting BM'ed constantly by GF (and every killer just no one talks about it) For legit no reason other then im a "entitled toxic survivor main" so i deserve it 
---
I cant even talk about Me getting BM'ed Or camped or whatever for no reason just bc "survivors could always do it" ????? Let me tell you somthing that i know you wont like, Every killer has been able to BM just as hard as survivors, and they HAVE been since release.
---
My main issues with GF is the players that play him, He is mindless and boring just like spirit and clown
---
You can't fix lag. These kind of problems will always exist in multiplayer games.
---
That's called getting cucked by auto aim :)
---
Also medium vaults are fucked for both sides
---
Amazing art, I love it!
---
Looks like my fuvking sleep paralysis demon. No joke tho the arts amazing!! Keep up the good work brotha. Love the style
---
While not exactly what was stated above, it still shows enthusiasm to a degree.  
---
[Twitter link](https://twitter.com/kylegallner/status/923618508499382273?lang=de)
---
He makes an even better face if you mori home with the doctor. Go find an ash to mori it will be worth it.
---
you peaked by making a shitty play and getting a 4% ?   
---
lmao
---
The only other thing that got nerfed about ghostface was some of his addons got their numbers *slightly* reduced. Nothing to major. Everything else was not an intended feature to his power.
---
Hearing Michael bread behind you makes you jump out of your bed so I‚Äôd have to give him the fear factor
---
I got anxiety just watching this
---
I mean, you can uncap the fps. I have it set to a maximum of 144. Granted, it only hits 144 in a lobby and hovers above 100 fps in game.
---
That's what I do to tunnelers, urban evasion bodyblock them and drop that pallet on them get em stuck everytime.
---
That‚Äôs during the game, in the post game screen at the final tab (could be any but never tried) there is a cog, you can press it and see.
---
Hold up can you stack these 5 $ discounts ?
---
Let them struggle. Gives survival BP and I want more time as killer to go kick gens, pallets, close hatch, open an exit gate, or do some Trapper Weightlifting/Billy Chainsaw Donuts etc. for deviousness.
---
Of course, what else could he do? He was so scared he actually opened the exit gates for us and put himself on the hook. That's the power of Bill for you.
---
LMAO well, there is desync I believe what they called it between the 2 clients. hugging a wall after vaulting mainly with few second might make the person clip into the wall which is only visible to the killer. basically lag switching but it is from the game xd
---
The perks were put in the game for a reason, you expect us not to use them as intended? Playing against a killer with this build is NOT the same as having to play against 4 teabagging assholes that bully you in the chat afterwards for no reason.
---
he is good :) and we must all admit it :)
---
Dude why did this make me panic and that SB saved you so much üò≠
---
Well thank you, Glad to see someone appreciates me and my life style choices, I will continue to play Legion and almost never kill anyone! TO VICTORY COMRADES!
---
its 2:08 in the morning, and i‚Äôm wheezing at how stupid this is with all of the intense music
---
He threw in the extra hit after the hook he big mad.
---
Oh yeah, it's terrifying Haha.
---
I agree other than the part they refuse the farm I do not see that as a problem as they just wanna play the game
---
Devs say if you play with surround take it off
---
I do it purely for tbe 1000 BP! üòé
---
I think that are the weapon hitboxes that need to be fixed.
---
That‚Äôs completely fair, except when everyone burns birthday cake, I understood that as a universal farming thing.
---
i WOULD play it but the killer queue times are so long and I WANT TO PLAY SPIRIT BEFORE THE SOUNDS GET BROKEN IN THE FREDDY REWORK PATCH
---
That‚Äôs not it
---
So do killers have a list of players they fucking hate? Because I‚Äôve started mine and I‚Äôm determined to find them again and make them pay.
---
You'd have the same ones if you carried adult peoples on your shoulder  24/7.
---
I'm not trying to sound like an entitled survivor, but BHVR needs to see all the clips of bs hit and fix the hitboxes. It seems they take into consideration of killer main complaints all the time, which is fine, but give us survivor mains something, mainly fixing hitboxes.
---
gg ez babby killer
---
Well, I think it is great. Can we see you do more characters or maybe killers?
---
I was asking if you just started playing the game. Basic tip for beginners is to learn to look behind you while running. It's awkward at first, but it will quickly make you a MUCH better survivor.
---
No one respects the 4% anymore, it's a disgrace really
---
Plague maybe spirit, survivors not sure tbh depends if you like the character model or perks
---
Well it depends if he's on console spirit is probably the best
---
If by players you mean survivors then absolutely.
---
Looks like Doc finally managed to eat his own lips.
---
I love the Walking Dead's vibe it give to the drawing.
---
Great drawing :)
---
You mean beanie Nea?
---
Who you calling dummy? Huntress and Freddy sounds stay the same so you don‚Äôt know when they get closer it‚Äôs been like that for years. But naw man you really a stupid mothafucka for not knowing a damn thing and tossing shit out ya ignorant ass.
---
it really is not. ppl just wanna play even if they burn the offerings some still do not like farming it is like I would not blame a killer for killing me if that happened. some just do not wanna farm period
---
Yeah I do that all the time but I didn‚Äôt need to do it there and then you throw a little shade while you‚Äôre at it. I‚Äôm not new but I don‚Äôt need to look behind me every time I run.
---
but right now you can can benefit from lag with ded. servers not anymore right?
---
David said no thanks
---
Okay, Pig's stun sound is S tier, you ignorant...
---
The perks seem really strong but a nice idea anyways.
---
Yes, I edited
---
Jeeeeesus these pandering posts are so embarrassing, stop, please. I can‚Äôt physically cringe anymore.
---
See, I‚Äôm still working through my survivor baggage. Gotta try to learn to be one of the good guys.
---
Memes are like art, they continue to evolve even if our understanding does not. This is proof of that evolution
---
Blessing seems very overpowered, but otherwise this seems kinda cool. Nice work!
---
Interesting. I‚Äôm learning so much. I guess I just saw frequency in everyone burning cake and farming. But that could be frequency illusion.
---
I LOST 3 EBONY MORIS BECAOUSE OF THAT
---
üò¢
---
It‚Äôs 50/50 if they wanna farm then farm but if not play for keeps
---
You still can't exactly benefit from the lag currently. Keep in mind that those hits need to connect in the host's screen and with high latency you'll have survivors teleporting constantly. Playing with shitty latency sucks for everyone equally
---
Hag is one of the best killers in the game &lt;3
---
I'm pretty sure he can close it at any time.
---
But they didn‚Äôt, so they can‚Äôt really ban people. Are special or just dumb that you can‚Äôt see that?
---
Being a Trapper Main this gives me so much satisfaction
---
THEY ARE USING BBQ 
---
TRY TO USE WAGLF
---
They really need to start punishing people who DC.
---
Darkness is best girl, if you don‚Äôt agree, 1v1 me.
---
This is me. I've been mostly playing solo and due to all the recent changes, the game is almost always unwinnable for survivors unless they're in a swf. At least in my experience in my region. Everyone keeps dying easily
---
I love this
---
450‚Ç¨
---
With Huntress Lullaby. Anything to help them miss their checkpoint.
---
Trapper on Haddonfield is nightmare fuel
---
I FUCKING AGREE SO FUCKING MUCH HOLEY MOLEY
---
They need to fix pulling cable = keep item and all your earned BP.
---
NAH FAM 
---
HE HAS THIS ANTI CUTTING GLOVES
---
you can do it out of the game as well after the match. I have never once clicked the cog did not even know there was one lol
---
if only we could have this warprint
---
Yes true kate is good to
---
THIS IS ANNOYING I KNOW THEY RAN ANTI TUNNELING BUILD
---
JUST GO AFTER RECUER WHEN THEY HAVE BORROWED
---
I RECOMEND MYC
---
It's telling you that it's getting sped up.
---
It's a built in penalty, run Dwight's perk "Prove Thyself" if you want to gain 10% speed boost per survivor while working with others on a gen.
---
2 Survivors is a 10% penalty
---
3 is 20%
---
4 is 30%
---
All right for real tho htf do they keep breaking sounds and what not. This last pach had fixes for things that didn't even exist before Ghostface and I just don't understand how incompetent you have to be to fuck up sprint brust when you add a killer
---
**bun bun feng now**
---
Just add unnerving presence to help little pit
---
Freddy is OP will be the new standard after we get this meta build famous
---
Thrill of the hunt
---
Devour hope
---
Third seal
---
Haunted grounds
---
Spirit with prayer beads and mother-daughter ring = doom
---
hacks dont show behavior theyll nerd everybody
---
Yeah I got caught off guard by this too, EW1 myers doesn't set it off, says so on the wiki.
---
You just have to appreciate how bug free this game can be sometimes. :)
---
this is good, what are you talking about. the artstyle reminds me of salt&amp;sanctuary (people call it "dishwasher"? i dunno) + the way the lightning was drawn looks really cool
---
I agree with No0b. I enjoy Monto.  
---
I like people who are funny, speak well, are educated on what‚Äôs what on dbd. 
---
I like Monto for his builds. I like that he pushes new videos out all of the time. 
---
But yes, editing is huge! I want to stay hooked and not on something the whole time. 
---
Variety.
---
Hey,
---
I am playing The Shape (I play others ONLY for quests). Do you guys know any good builds for him? I tried to google some but they are a bit old.
---
For PC EU try gammalunatic awesome Player
---
What's the point of a perk to stall the end game if it takes throwing the game to get it to work. You should NEVER need to hit one player 10 times.
---
Wake up comes in clutch
---
Wtf dude I love your art style, almost kinda Tim burtony :)
---
"Please don't hurt me pig mains" lol
---
I'm not ok with neerfs to killers that are already weaker than nurse, Billy and spirit. it doesn't make any sense
---
Just look down 4head
---
no just fucking no this is supposed to be a horror game plus if he hit someone they would just be sliced in hald
---
Alright I understand this isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre asking man but I watch Fungoose on twitch. Fungoose is basically YouTube for me for how much I enjoy it.
---
Not only is he great but he‚Äôs a Dead By Daylight Educational Streamer. He‚Äôs also a funny and lovely type of person. 
---
Mr. Goose is my YouTube. He beats everyone to me personally. If you have the time out of your day watch him. He explains what he does and why he does it. 
---
He also has Killer Builds if you type !killername 
---
He does have a YouTube but I like watching his twitch man.
---
But its red :(
---
Huh, so we get punished for working as a team? I don't recall it being like that a while ago. Well thanks anyway.
---
Myers for sure, GF is garbage
---
Also if you ever are on twitch depending on Timezone Fungoose is a lovely lad that you may like. I just want the man to gain more followers and I want everyone to learn from the man. 
---
That‚Äôs why I spread the word. Hope you have a great day. Also I hope that 1 guy isn‚Äôt being creepy again.
---
I got it by accident when sticking an ebony on freddy for a round against an swf, was only going to use it if they were being toxic but gens were going quickly and I got a bit overexcited. I was actually shocked none of them DCed.
---
no it still goes faster than you by yourself I believe even if it is red
---
GF has crap mindgames, even after the update he's still loud af...
---
Hell yeah, looks amazing. Meg main big brain
---
GF is loud af, even after the update, even Michael's breathing is quiter than that crap
---
How did they mess up with Wake Up is the real question.
---
As a Trapper player, where do I get these Traps? More than 2 attempt and he still hasn't freed himself. I didn't knew this was possible.
---
Bruuh if it wasnt for Sprint burst...
---
I don't think so. Zoom in.
---
They refuse to farm? No one is obliged to farm with you.
---
As for "they bully you when you try", more likely they're just playing the game and trying to survive as intended. Looping, juking and avoiding the killer is not bullying, it's surviving.
---
I understand there's assholes who run around in the open, moonwalking, flashlight clicking and teabagging at every opportunity. But other than that no.
---
Wake Up saved them a full 3 seconds, their sprint burst wouldn't have mattered
---
or they are gonna report you if you let them live
---
This is so lucky &amp; funny xD
---
Better than me at least
---
Good
---
Ok
---
So the game just thinks that you‚Äôre cheating? Or that you didn‚Äôt agree to the terms of service?
---
Happened to a Spirit I played yesterday :(
---
It only happens when the minimum requiered pallets of 8 for a map is not reached.
---
So the survivors have only 8 pallets in the whole map instead of 12-15 and you complain about 1 double spawn?!
---
Thanks!
---
Nice
---
Yeah that makes sense. Editing and memes usually do keep people hooked inlcluding on myself , but i think having that type of personality cant be forced , for me i'm more of a competitive person and mainly focus on winning and improving so i'm not sure if uploading say 2 games in a row of high rank play is "tiring " think thats the right way to say it , i've had mixed feedback.
---
‚ÄûDownWithTheThiccness‚Äú
---
I'll check him out , sounds like hes got the good mix.
---
https://youtu.be/Vn1Znvdifx8
---
I know this is a long video, but under advanced he mentions tuning your controller sensitivity up (IDK why either, but supposedly it works even with mouse and kb for whatever reason) on Billy results in extreme turns at the start of the chainsaw sprint, and he does a few 180's from a standstill.
---
I was going to say, since when does taking a hex totem out considered greedy?
---
Farmer John on youtube has some good videos, Noob3 has some funny videos, but my favorite would have to be ohmwrecker.
---
Not really, I‚Äôve been playing for a while but I recently picked it back up. Currently I‚Äôm at Rank 13 using mostly Legion and Spirit. Plus I‚Äôve had multiple rant on the state of Gen rushing
---
Because you can‚Äôt exploit the perk for a permanent 15% that makes it unviable? What‚Äôs crazy is the perk can still do what people have been doing you just have to add in one more chase juke. You can still run people down as Sonic Bubba, still have Flash Freddy or even do Turbo Puke Plague. You just have to actually use the perk instead of breaking it but I guess working for power is what makes people upset.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs fucking garbage I guess. Better not even play him he‚Äôs dead off that 8%. Big nerf, F tier incoming.
---
Lalatina.
---
I'd really like to see that happen
---
Lovely
---
yep you're better off not caring about rank. which is nice because theres an upside to losing: better future matches
---
I've seen him play with MM7Games/Miniminter before. So he's had the game for about a year or two, but doesn't play often, and that crowd are all pretty terrible at the game.
---
Doctor is good in lower ranks, as most killers are.  Once you start hitting purple he falls off quite a bit unless you can master shocking people out of vaults and pallet drops.  Plus he's very add-on dependent to be at his most annoying.  With that said, if he's fun for you, dump your points on him and don't worry about rank.
---
&gt; Gen rushing
---
Doesn't exist, do you mean survivors doing their only objective?
---
Because that's what it is.
---
Survivors doing their only objective.
---
You need to learn to patrol gens more often and target certain gens aswell as having more map control, i'm guessing since you are getting 'gen rushed' it's because you are not being agressive, it sounds like you are a docile killer who doesn't exist to make the survivors lives harder but to just be a mild plaything who joins them in the trial.
---
Pretty easy to get rid of this problem. Just make them throw one of the pallets and break it. Looks like you already fixed the problem in this post
---
What is that?
---
Sounds like your new. (Your pretty much considered new in this game until you have 200 hours). You play two characters with sprint powers so you should be able to get around the map relatively fine. You haven‚Äôt really provided us with enough information to figure out why. Also the game not survivor sided and there‚Äôs been no end in sight to survivors nerfs.
---
Killer's say it's in favor of survivor's. Survivor's say it's in favor Killer's. I say a good compromise leaves everyone unhappy.
---
My lithe cries every time
---
That's what Unbreakable looks like on console. Console players never received Bill as a character, so when the game released, his perks were added in as regular perks and they edited his face off of Unbreakable.q
---
The Ghostface detection mechanic is inherently flawed and I don't know that there's any way to fix it without some sort of major tweak. The third person camera view for survivors means they can break Ghostface out of stealth *without the killer ever seeing them.* 
---
Think about that. You can duck behind a piece of cover (either move or crouch) and completely break line of sight from the survivor, but they can still break you out of stealth because they can just tilt their camera around to see you. In that respect, it makes survivors actually stealthier than the *stealth killer.* 
---
There needs to be some kind of line-of-sight mechanic that breaks the process of being discovered. It supposedly already exists, since the devs say they have a line of sight process for hex totems that prevents survivors from spawning in a place where they have immediate LOS on one. Such a fix would be a great quality of life upgrade and, in opinion, wouldn't break him at all. It would just make the survivors actually have to expend some effort to detect him. Because as of right now, it's a joke.
---
I don‚Äôt maybe I‚Äôm just bad, just seems like I can‚Äôt do anything when three survivors do a gen with toolboxes, I split them up, get one on a hook, and the other two have already completed another gen together. It doesn‚Äôt happen every game, just certain games I get trashed on.
---
It‚Äôs been like this for as long as I can remember. There was just never a visual indicator that it was happening
---
There s some basic nukes everyone should know. I'd look it up on YouTube because they are hard to explain, but you should at least know the easy ones like the window juke. Also this game isn't about hiding to be successful, it's about looping. Take the killer on some big loops and get hooked, do your part and if every survivor does that, the odds are in your favor to win most times. Again this is very basic but look up Juke Guides and you'll be good to go
---
This post makes no sense
---
Doctor is particularly good at low ranks because his power is basically anti-stealth and survivors at that level try to hide. At higher levels survivors don‚Äôt even bother hiding so his power loses most of its value. Try doctor out around the single digit ranks and see how well you do.
---
You don‚Äôt. Learn to loop instead
---
This.  Your individual repair time is lowered but the combined time of having extra people on the gen makes it faster.  Optimally, you would want four people working on four different gens at the same time, but realistically this can't always be done.
---
You sound new. Keep in mind that when you run you leave glowing scratch marks behind that only the killer can see. If you're injured, you'll make constant noise unless you're running a perk like Iron Will, and you'll be leaving a blood trail everywhere you go.
---
If you started working on a generator, heard the killer coming and went to hide, he will likely scour the area trying to find you. The fact the generator is moving is a clear indication of survivor presence.
---
I recommend watching some streamers on twitch who play killer, or play killer yourself. It will help you get better seeing both sides of the game, you'll get a better fundamental understanding of the mechanics.
---
Nah nah. That was a ‚Äòlove‚Äô tap
---
The trick to handling looping (beyond perks) requires a little nap knowledge. You don‚Äôt want to break a pallet as soon as it‚Äôs dropped. You need to chase the survivor over to the other side if you know theres less pallets in that direction over there or into corners. Most killers don‚Äôt bother trying to shepherd the survivor. It why pallet looping is so strong. The other trick to handling looping is learning the hit boxes around objects and sticking as close as you can without getting caught. Hopes this helps
---
Mediocre advice.
---
While looping is so much stronger to fight the killer with, hiding can often be enough to get rid of a Killer.
---
Of course if you only hide you wont learn to loop and you cant stay hidden forever. The killer will find you sooner or later
---
Both pig and wraith need some major buffs
---
was expecting a different bunny but this is very nice nontheless
---
Pretty sure the game is as balanced as it‚Äôs ever been rn
---
‚ÄúOf course if you only hide you wont learn to loop and you cant stay hidden forever. The killer will find you sooner or later‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs why I told him ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt‚Äù
---
New players are often immersed. Dropping that playstyle is the best advice I can give you
---
This is gonna haunt me forever.
---
Backwards: Survivor enters the shack 
---
Stealthy killer: oh fuck I hope I mark him in time
---
I noticed when I play killer when people try to body block I can still hook the survivor
---
Get the Alert perk, it'll let you see the Killer's aura every time they whack a pallet or generator.
---
This is so good, I'd immediatelly find motivation to play again and make Feng my main forever.
---
In my opinion, rank resets shouldn't be a thing, especially not since people receive absolutely zero rewards for reaching the high ranks.  
---
Instead, there should be rank deterioration. If a player hasn't played the game in, let's say a week or two, their rank will start to slowly go down.  
---
This way, high ranks don't get to bully newbies once a month. The only way for someone to get to be a bully would be playing with a low rank friend and abusing the SWF matchmaking (which people already do anyway) or not play for possibly an entire month so that they can derank over time, which would in a way punish them, because if that's what they want to do, they have to wait quite some time.

Take a team of 30 or so talented people, make a shit ton of money, then toss in 150 shit flinging chimps.

That's BHVR right now. They HAD a small team of talented competent developers, they switched from quality to quantity.
---
That's just ping. The same thing happens on murder mystery. When I'm innocent and murderer is chasing me he hits me from 2 meters but when I'm the murderer my knife has to touch the player or I won't kill him
---
thanks dude
---
He's been touched by the devil
---
Gen rushing is definitely a thing and I don‚Äôt know how people say it‚Äôs not. ‚ÄúTheir goal is to complete gems‚Äù 15 sec gens is bs but I get it, that‚Äôs why if the chance arises I tunnel because screw those guys. I‚Äôm gonna take that advice and dodge when I see stuff like that though, thanks.
---
I've learned it's sometimes a good idea to just lunge through pallets if they're injured cause a lot of the time I can just get the hit.  My main thought when chasing a survivor is things like "Is this guy leading me away from gens in a bid to waste my time"  or "This is wasting time I need to just patrol gens"  I feel bad if I get beat by a good loop but sometimes I feel some loops are just so good.  So I try to catch them another time by cutting them off on the way back to that loop.  
---
Thanks for the tips though I am trying to learn maps more as I like playing trapper so if I wanna play him again I need to learn the maps.
---
Seem super fishy
---
My friend has that. He's stuck at rank 18 whilst I'm on 7, never played without him
---
I personally think that would make him worse. As a Wraith main, I‚Äôve found out that I‚Äôd you are smart where you approach the survivor, the speed boost will catch up to them for a basically free hit. Especially if you use his common add on ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù and either Bone Clapper, or the red one that removes the bell sound all together. This makes it so they don‚Äôt know if you are after them or someone else, therefore you can get some easy hits off.
---
I mean, the in game report system does nothing anyways unless followed up with proof via a support ticket.

me with pretty much any game I own

Me: "I'm bored. I want to play games."
---
My husband: "Play games then."
---
Me:
---
Me: "....I don't feel like playing anything."
---
honestly, aside from the broken perks and infinite mending, which are fixed, I cant remember any bugs
---
Option four: just in case that killer finds me again
---
I like them, but I guess no one really goes above Nurse because she completely counters loopers and most of the other killers suffer from that.
---
Then again I only have basic perks on Clown and Plag, maybe there are other combos of perks to help them be better.. because other than the gen blocking other Plague perks seem meh, but Clown perks seem decent ngl.
---
This is not fair üòÇ
---
Yes lots of toxic survivors do not realize that they need US to have a game in the first place, so they keep insulting, sending death threats. It is sad.
---
wow i want to do it
---
Not only did the the door barely open in time but exhaustion BARELY reset before you went to run!
---
What did it cost?
---
That's the point, what about play with your food? A very viable perk used in higher ranks that essentially "throws" for future advantages.
---

I am missing the same DLCs-are they worth getting for a casual player who doesn't care about high level play? The discounts are quite nice.

I have it in EU on steam.

Don't do that... don't give me hope

I feel like GF is honestly just Michael but more complicated and partially handicapped.

New players have no idea how to combine them, so I‚Äôm giving them the superior one

Lmao that‚Äôs so true

Good against GF? Now I'll play omega TR doctor
---
For a moment I was confused why a DBD meme was in /r/animemes
---
Ah yes, everyone should have insane map presence.
---
That's the way hex totems work. You don't know what it is till you get one of the effects from it. You'll know it's thrill due to slower cleanse speed. You know it's ruin when you get a skill check. You know it's third seal when you get blindness, etc, etc
---
I will stay near the totem and start cleansing it when someone just got injured. Or I will just cleanse all the dull totems cus it will be so annoying if both noed and haunted ground are up.
---
If you call killers using melee weapons a shitty design then ok. All multiplayer games have lag, you just can't see it in shooters because you don't see bullet flight trails, and also you shoot much more often so the error is compensated by frequency.
---
So if that's indeed what you're saying, then they basically fixed it in Deathgarden. But, as fun as Deathgarden is, I still prefer DbD, and melee is one of the reasons I like DbD so much.
---
Just started on PC, main killer: 10 minutes to find a game, probably SWF and 9/10 Smurfs or survivor with like all the best perks.
---
Even if i do 3 kill i get no pip. Annoying as fuck
---
But then you realise, that last 3 gens a literary seconds away from each other. GG EZ
---
I see otzdarva run it pretty consistently, but he does off meta builds. It was an interesting pwyf bubba combo that was pretty damn strong given how abusable getting in "a chase" is with moonwalking and such. 
---
It's on his second YouTube channel if you're interested. (And stream)
---
Of course it's not spirit, nurse, Billy but honestly if that's the only thing considered viable then idc lol. I'm a red rank survivor and it was a nice change of pace from enduring/spirit fire/chili/ruin so I thought it was interesting. Feel free to disagree.
---
Why is Hillbilly essential for a new player?
---
What movie?
---
Desync can result in survivor stopping for a moment on killer's screen. Nothing can be done about it really.
---
Dedicated servers can move the evaluation away from the killer, but it will just result in everybody having desync. What is better for survivors of course, but the lag still will be there as much as bullshit hits.
---
I do disagree. It's not that it's hard to drop a chase, it's that you have to find ONE specific survivor to make use of it, and have to keep coming back to them to rebuild it.
---
Bubba might be a very small exception because with boosted sped and a chainsaw he can down somewhat reasonably with only one offensive action, meaning he'll keep the perk stacks longer than nearly any other killer that would make use of them.
---
I still feel that it's too reliant on being able to reliably find the obsession though, and that top meta or not, there's plenty of other better perks that are simply more consistent.
---
That was just too perfect. If even one variable was off, this would have never happened. The guy dying on the hook at just the right time, the killer hitting you, the kobe... Just perfect.
---
You would have still died without sprint burst
---
TIL the hatch reopens if you become the last survivor. Good to know :)
---
the first time a ghostface tea bagged me back, I lost my shit üòÇ messaged him after the match and said "touche, my friend."
---
Yup
---
Right, but theres also this thing called The Terror Radius
---
Anyone else weirded out by this one?
---
No luck offerings were used (at least none that affected OP) as there was no luck icon above the progress bar when he attempted escape.
---
You also forgot trying to unhook themselves, making them dead on hook next time around.
---
It begins...
---
try another hobby, but make sure it's creative
---
so writing, making music or being artistic
---
hell, even minecraft is considered a creative hobby
---
He's the easiest top tier killer to learn by far. Once youre food at Billy a lot of things you learned can carry over to other m2 killers as well
---
I enjoyed this. The perks seem fine. A pure BP gain, a decent gen regression/stall. And the movement one is nice but a bit OP. I would probably go with 2% and less max tokens or 1%. But otherwise it seems nice. I‚Äôve made probably two dozen ideas for me and my friends for killers and survivor perks.
---
My gf to me when she wants to play dbd and I don‚Äôt
---
I did a full re-install of the game. Also I don't use any customisations. But I appreciate your help.
---
Yeah im seeing an average or 2 escape with the outliers being a dominating 4 man escape or a 4 man slaughter, i dont see 3 games anymore.
---
Excuse me what. I‚Äôve learned something
---
Its hard to pinpoint exactly how dbd does this to you
---
The green guy in the picture.
---
The more people get hooked the faster the skill check shows up after the sound warning and after 5 hooked survivors there is no sound before the skill check.
---
&gt;:(
---
When you're the killer but you're still on edge üòÇ
---
Nah fam that‚Äôs squidward
---
Except that DS now makes it more likely other people are the obsession, rather than one who is confident as they run a safety net. Arguably you could trigger DS to force it, but that's tanking an unnecessary chase to get it to work.
---
No problem
---
reminds me of the end of that movie Total Recall when Arnold's Eyes are bulging out of his head when he can't breath on Mar's surface.
---
People don't wanna watch stuff designed to be shoved down their throats. Just be yourself and enjoy it. At the end of the day you gotta think about what your goal is. If it's just a hobby but going into it thinking it's gonna be a full-time streamer or YouTuber isn't the right mindset.
---
i used to play the game in 2016, but i stopped for a while and forgot my account, so iam not too experienced with looping, except to mindgame the unsafe pallets, and just go with the flow of the long pallets until i get bamboozle(like the bus in autohaven wreckers that can't get mindgamed.
---
How do you record on your phone thats what I wanna know.
---
Hey im late to the party, but why didnt you picked Iron Will as S+ tier? Tier 3 iron will is incredible powerfull
---
I see a graduation cap. Is that one of those things just found in the files and isn‚Äôt in the game?
---
Wdym
---
well shit, i think im gonna add that to my build lol
---
How can I learn this power
---
Old but gold
---
thank and yes there are unused files
---
There is a tutorial?!?
---
Yea thought so. But anyways these fr look cool so ima use them. Thanks.
---
It‚Äôs your internet connection

Certain addons can increase difficulty of escaping traps.

Doc kinda hot..but he has no lips, so he can't eat my pussy properly.

Dwight is
---
Use Hex: Ruin, that‚Äôs the only way to stop heavy gen rushing from happening. Using Ruin doesn‚Äôt mean that you can play badly and 4K every game, you still have to apply pressure to survivors otherwise you‚Äôre going to get ‚Äúgen rushed‚Äù no matter what.
---
I like the game and I want to play but...there‚Äôs no way in hell I‚Äôm touching dbd unless I have a friend to suffer with me
---
Legion is fun but not the strongest (spirit furrys are my new nightmare)
---
i miss this screen lol, i wish they had kept it alongside the emblems

wraith
---
You're not alone on this one, My only advice is to dodge killers with a ping above 150, And hold on until dedicated servers come around.
---
Money
---
Not really. It feels the same honestly
---
What would‚Äôve been the point of him looking behind him there..? It was either he was getting the hatch or nothing. He needed to optimize his route as much as possible
---
Very Metal Gear esque stylings...
---
What specific recent changes are you referring to?
---
They're just lazy.
---
Don't humor them.
---
Can't play idk why. Asked on reddit for help.
---
Post gets deleted
---
Not only sb
---
ah ok good to know! thx for the heads up does this count for ps4 aswell?
---
The moment I see Leatherface I stay as far as possible away from the basement. Then I get downed, picked up, and he has Agitation and Iron Grasp lol
---
I used it as a poor mans ruin before I got ruin üòè
---
If you pause at the right time, you see that my character is dragged back because that massive rollerskate lunge hit my hitbox, but not my character model itself.
---
When you get too lazy to make a caption.
---
No, sorry. The killer is just plagueface with a useless ultra rare add-on and I'm All Ears, one super annoying perk and budget noed, and the survivor has adrenaline on acid, windows of opportunity and another really annoying perk.
---
Even when I play the killer, there are hits that connect where I say: "well, that was bullshit, he should not have gotten that hit"
---
A Dwight a day keeps the killers away...
---
Yeah because there's ping. You have to take in account that if you have 100 ping, it takes 100ms for your info to reach the killer, then the killer swings and it takes 100ms for that to reach your end. All in all if you have 100 ping (Depending on how the netcode is programmed) a hit can hit up to 0.2 seconds later, and if you're running, in 0.2 seconds you can clear that minuscule gap between the killers' weapon and the survivor.
---
How?
---
OP isn't talking about the actual grunts made by Survivors, but the music that plays when you are in the injured state.
---
In French his name is Carlos Tentacles
---
They've tested them recently in a PTB. They're working on them and hope to roll them out this summer. They mentioned it on the anniversary stream. You can take a look on the roadmap to get a better idea when they're going to roll out.
---
The greater part of the community agrees that it's a ridiculous grind but somehow this post gets downvoted. I guess this is just how reddit is.
---
Did you just assume what wraith is?
---
changing the offerings (i've done it before) causes the game to crash.  i do not recommend changing any of the offerings. perks are fine.
---
So, if everyone ran at least tier 2, we get out instantly?
---
Oh my fucking god i hate people that claim "oh im so badd at drawing üò£" whilst being aware that it's above average just stfu you insecure swine.
---
HOOK ME DADDY
---
Myre is my Favorite of them all.
---
I found it best to take a week off every couple of weeks. Partially because I'm the type of person to quickly burn out on games if I play them too much, no matter how much I enjoy them.
---
Partially because I'm just really bad at dbd and get frustrated when I catch a long bad streak. I understand that as a doctor main who isnt that good I wont win most games and that's fine, but I had a day where three games in a row my teammates let me die on first hook without even coming close to me. In the third game I could see all three of them on the same gen across the map. 
---
I just accepted my struggle points and closed the game for a few days after that.
---
But you can still do that though. Lol So sounds like you've issue with the perk itself, not this change.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs pretty add on reliant which is annoying. Can be a bit expensive playing him if you wanna win consistently
---
I know this is a joke but fun fact, Dwight is based off one of the developers
---
are the ruler add-ons good?(the ones that decrease the time required to fill up the FF meter. or are the FF duartion ones better?
---
also i was thinking of frank's mixtape and a ruler, that a good combo?
---
I main killer but I hate killer and at the same time I hate the outrageous queue times. But if I queue as survivor I get into a game instantly.
---
Except the devs said they would ban people for using those Legion add-ons. Cut the extremely rude name-calling and just accept the fact that you're wrong.
---
I wish there was a way to keep the rankings but also fix queue times
---
I wouldn't call it griefing. I'm not going in and stomping a mudhole with ruin bbq and noed. Im using fun blood point gaining perks, and get to try weird builds. I get to relax and play comfortably, and as I said, I pretty much always let one or two people leave.   
---
Honestly, when I occasionally get a swf of four red ranks, which still happens because matchmaking is dogshit, I get my ass kicked, because Im not playing seriously, Im playing laid back and fairly
---
What are the implications of adding logging to analyze ranking?
---
No one did.
---
The absolute best way is by not playing lmao.
---
I use spine chill and urban evasion. Just crouch away from the cat.
---
Thanks for the reply, I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôve got to it. Will feel strange not getting hit through pallet stuns and vaults when they release it
---
r/murderedbywords
---
Play as Claudette and wear dark clothing. For perks use urban evasion, spine chill, and iron will
---
Bit of both maybe? I‚Äôve seen games with less budget and players yet they have dedicated servers, that‚Äôs what I can‚Äôt wrap my head around.
---
SO BECAUSE WE SPENT MONEY ON TO BUY A GAME, THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY?
---
"LOOK I KNOW YOU BOUGHT THIS GAME FROM US, BUT EVEN THOUGH YOU SUPPORTED US, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING WITHOUT CHARGING YOU UP FOR EXPENSIVE CRAP."
---
Go for nurse or billy thed both fun to play and also very strong
---
I got freddy yesterday hes fun, but I find it annoying how long it takes to put them asleep... my first match was ez 2 people DC.. 
---
Second match was fun on the game map I kill all but 2 
---
3rd match was super hard, I put the offering on get less skill checks these guys were snapping out of it as soon as I put them asleep.. so aggravating.. I lost that match miserably.
---
Fair point
---
what
---
Fence sitters of the world...UNITE
---
Honestly don‚Äôt hide from killers. I‚Äôm not saying charge right into them either but it seems like you are a somewhat new player. The more time you find yourself hiding the less time you have to improve on things like chase, 360s, looping etc. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs ok to hide in some situations just don‚Äôt let it get the best of you.
---
..................And still talking about Legion add-ons. We not talking about Legion are we? Why you keep talking about Legion add-ons, we talking about Wake up (which the devs said nothing about banning people)
---
A man of wisdom right here
---
Are you on Xbox by chance? They recently put DbD on the games pass thing an TONS of new Ayers have joined an they are real bad.
---
Thanks
---
Have you played F13? 
---
This game is a paradise comparatively.
---
Expect to see a Nurse once every 200 games.
---
Everytime you get hit with a status effect or tier up in ew3, expect lag.
---
The list goes on.
---
This guy gets it
---
The charge only puts them in deep wound and has a cool down of 7 seconds? Would be the worst killer in the game
---
You didn't list his terror radius in the main post, how big in meters?
---
Huh?
---
But he has (presumably) hitscan ranged attacks, and his shotgun can insta-down at point blank.
---
Lol I didnt thought that someone would actually didnt see that its an irony, and 24 people downvoted that comment
---
uwu
---
anyone know what the original image is from?
---
Thats awesome
---
Mom please get me im scared.
---
Thanks! The idea is that you actually have to find the objects yourself, but it has no cooldown.
---
If I play killer the queue times are so long amd if I play survivor I get in a lobby and then boom infinite loading screen
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest, I didn‚Äôt read this all the way through. This killer may be too good lol
---
Even though it worked this time, i wouldn't rely on this against freddy. Ever. Not respecting freddy by staying on gens, healing and hook rushing will get you killed. Kinda why survivors lose 1000 IQ and most brain cells.
---
Good to know about the hatch! Thanks!
---
I bought the chapter though.
---
Yeah, I'm talking about Legion add-ons. *You* are talking about Wake Up. You don't control what I talk about.
---
And now I know you didn't really read my comment. Let me repost it for you so you can read it properly this time:
---
&gt; And yet, the devs made an announcement in the game (IIRC) for the Legion thing. *They can do the exact same thing for the Wake Up! perk (before it got fixed)*. There is no excuse.
---
1000 hours on this god awful but addicting game taught me a thing or two
---
**Run All 3**
---
I've seen a lot of matches. There is this Youtuber I dig =&gt; "Play with Jason". 
---
But what I can tell from watching it is thats not the Type of game I would like. Too many stale routines and the chases are not the fast paced action I like on DBD. 
---
Also there are not that many ways to "build" your Character. You often just try to cover the weaknesses of your counselors. 
---
Also also =&gt; voice chat. Nuff said.
---
This happened to me once before when I first started playing and didn't understand gen placement. We had two gen left right next to each other and I was playing against a doctor who just kept zapping us over and over again and then destroying the gen progress. My ear drums barely survived but I definitely learned a lesson that day.
---
I got stuck in a pallet as nurse but just blinked out and proceeded to kill.
---
This is untru... just because my friend joins my party and is a rank 11 and I'm a 4 doesnt mean we are trying to abuse the system...  I give them shit for being a rank 11 we laugh and start playing..  i dont ever try and get low rank friends to make it easier for me or my team we dont care.
---
I have not been having an issue personally, just know when to crouch and activate his night shroud.
---
Started late this "season" and i am down to rank 10.
---
Ive been doing at least 3 generators every game.
---
Most people do absolutely nothing. One game a person literally just ran around the stage. I was hooked watching this persom
---
Thana is useless and good survivors will not cleanse and give you free instadown/snowball potential

Hillbilly takes time but eventually becomes easy and fun (if your type of fun is winning every game, lol).  Nurse takes time too but she's really good.  Pig can get frustrating if you try but still loose.  Myers is fun, but his power isn't as great as Billy's is.  Legion is horrible (I used to love him, now he makes me want to die).  Plague is fun, sorta like a ranged Myers.  Doctor sorta requires good timing and takes some skill (but his add-ons are bad).  Trapper's power is sorta situational, often taking more thought and time to place then you get benefit wise (not counting op add-ons).  Wraith is balanced.  Don't play leather face, he seems good but his power is situational when you get looped.  Ghostface seems like a fun killer (I don't have him).  Huntress is really fun but takes practice and patience.  The hag is ok but I don't play her much, so idk.  I don't have the clown.  Spirit is an underpowered nurse, but you need headphones to play with.  Freddy might get a buff but I'd wait to see the buff, because who knows with these devs.  And that covers it.  ( I spent 10 minutes, I have no life.)
---
Do you hear yourself ? It should be bannable for people to play with friends in different ranks.. I cant deal with you.
---
Of course it has Darkness.
---
Last night I got 4 claudettes swf on the spirits map. I was running myers tuft of hair and pink tombstone. Needless to say it was not fun for me. One offering for the map and the rest were double points.
---
ok THIS is epic. pls nerf doc ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
*cough* megumin *cough*
---
Nice!  I like it. :D   I like how you gave her patches of dirt or soot on her clothes.  Just like in the game. :)
---
David is trash
---
And yet, people would get banned for using the Legion add-ons which were "in the current build of the game." **And once again, I said the devs *COULD* make an announcement for Wake Up just like they did with the Legion add-ons.** 
---
It's like you're blatantly trying to avoid my points.
---
I FUCKING HATE SWF I JUST WANT A DAY WHERE I CAN HAVE FUN AS KILLER AND NOT GO AGAINST A SWF ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS A BLOODHUNT JUST LET ME GET MY FUCKING BP‚ÄôS YOU SWEATY FUCKS
---
Open and close a closet repeatedly. The killer will confuse you for one of them due to the noise.

i appreciate all this so much man thanks. i think im gonna save up for spirit and get ghostface.
---
Classic blunder, always, ALWAYS wait for the killer to visit their totem when you find it at the start of the round.
---
works on my machine
---
Basically, slapping someone on a hook and teabagging both contribute nothing to the game and only serve to provoke the other player. You can't force the sacrifice to go faster, and spamming crouch doesn't do anything. You can't really do anything when the killer hits you on the hook. You know you can't escape. The killer knows you can't escape. There's no reason to rub it in. Same goes for teabagging at the exit gates. You won‚Äîleave. This is also what makes OP's hatch escape more satisfying.
---
I feel like the main issue is people try to stalk like they do with Michael. You gotta utilize the peeking. He still gets seen through walls though. Thet needed to perfect the survivor spotting mechanic before touching gf imo.
---
That's been an issue for a while; when vaulting from the low side to the high side; it'll keep you on the low side for whatever reason; they were supposed to fix it a while ago but still haven't
---
Alright
---
That‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen the hallucination be actually useful outside of tracking
---
This is why I don't like cats
---
I WANNA PLAY DBD BUT I' M REFUSING CUZ OF THESE SOUND ISSUES. WHY THERE IS NO FIX FOR THIS YET? I MEAN, SOUND IS ESSENTIAL FOR THIS GAME. I FEEL LIKE A DEAF WHEN I TRY TO PLAY.
---
LMAO someone's feelings are real hurt about something.
---
An it's not the DCs I'm talking about, it's the running around willy nilly, screwing up gens, and unhooking right under killer.
---
I play killer and I don't see the low ranks, but a have a few friends complaining about them.
---
Nah PS4. Glad to see it‚Äôs not just me though.
---
Pig is very fun
---
Seriously. It's worth it to see his swooshy hair when he runs though.
---
Actions *usually* take priority of what the camera is facing
---
Okay sounds good. But when you win the chase or get downed, do you keep the 'memory' of these vaults for when you enter a new chase and how does this perk interact with illusionary pallets and blocked off windows (bamboozled)?
---
Funny but God damn the laughs are brutal on my ears.
---
The first time this happened to me as a killer I had no idea what was happening or why.
---
I then proceeded to slug two people and hook the person on my shoulder anyway.
---
It was a quick match.
---
He has a tongue still so he can try his best :/
---
I hate to tell you this but both Leatherface and Freddy should be higher up on the list.
---
Double fuck. This is me too
---
That's called ping
---
If you're trying to hide for a specific instance, do not run, as it leaves marks. Walk to a hiding spot and crouch. Also, don't hide near the border since that's the easiest place to find you. Hide in busy spots like around construction areas that you can blend into instead of around trees and walls.   
---
Hiding shouldn't be a normal thing, but it can save you from time to time. Just don't rely on it, obviously.
---
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BALANCE YOUR GAME CHANGE THE STUPID NOED PERK! STOP GIVING BAD PLAYERS SECOND CHANCES! IMPROVE SPEED, MISSED ATTACKS, ATTACK RECOVERY! THE EXPOSED STATUS EFFECT HAS TO GO! AS A SOLO PLAYER I CAN'T DO ALL TOTEMS AND IT'S LUDICROUS TO EXPECT THIS FROM 1 PERSON!
---
Freddy is a fucking pedo
---
This is actually really funny.
---
There was 2 generators left and he opened the hatch. The huntress closed it which started the EGC 2 generator early. The timer is the same though.
---
3 viable killers at red rank is a lot? a lot boring, yeah
---
sprint burst was always bad though.. not an issue
---
That's my new favorite thing to run now. Add in botany knowledge and you are basically a medic on steroids.
---
Just dont stun the killer when you know he has it
---
waah thats all i hear from you
---
The shit posts today are on FIRE UP!
---
Only complaints are his neck is long and head small
---
I'm not offended, just didnt grasp your logic of wanting to ban people for playing with their friends.. I cant help what rank my friend is maybe they suck.
---
Free tip for you, If you go against someone using those two perks, you need to be less greedy with pallets and put the pallet down before the killer can swing through it to proc the perk. There you have it, 2 perks completely wasted for the killer, Enduring only works now for pallets, so if you are smart about your looping, you pretty much waste 2 of his perks. Just don't be one of those people chucking every pallet down instantly, make sure you use each pallet efficiently and use the time the killer breaks pallets and gain ground and space pallets outs for others or if you in a team, make sure they all getting gens done
---
I guess I can see that. I think a lot of people see those behaviors as legitimate tactics to get inside the heads of other players and make them perform worse. I always just looked at it in the same light as the taunting in other sports. Like a touchdown celebration for example, it fits the description of toxic behavior that you just provided. Idk, to me it's not toxic, just part of the game. People are gonna do it so I don't let myself be bothered by it.
---
Ah I hadn't noticed but I haven't used prem for ages so that's probably why.
---
Horse stack is attached
---
I just started playing on Xbox. About 6 hours in at level 9 on Jake(?). I‚Äôve only played as survivor and im having a blast even though I die a whole lot. Out of like 20 matches I‚Äôve survived twice.
---
‚ÄúCome on then, let‚Äôs ‚Äòave it! I don‚Äôt give a crap pal.‚Äù
---
It is, but there aren't many great alternatives for killers with little map pressure, which is most of them.
---
And even a five stacked lullaby can be worked around, assuming you can even get it to last for five stacks.
---
What is that supposed to mean?
---
I'm not sure HOW it works exactly. It happens occasionally seemingly without any rhyme or reason. Like it's happened loading into the intro cinematic before, when I was messing around with a loadout in the pre-queue lobby, etc.
---
I don't know about "feelings hurt real back," but I'm definitely mocking you guys for gatekeeping DbD so hard. 
---
But I'm talking about DCs, as a trash Xbox Game Pass noob, when I play Survivor at level 14, I see a bunch of Salties DC when they get downed. As Survivor, each game it's actually a pleasant surprise when I get a game when someone *isn't* DC'ing.   
---
As a Killer, I thankfully don't get DCs, but I'm level 16 Killer, so I'm playing lower ranks and they do not DC nearly as much.
---
Most fun for me: Huntress, Myers, Nurse, Spirit, Ghost face
---
Least: Freddy, Billy, Clown, Bubba, Moris
---
How to get this discounts ?   
---
What is this missions and how to complete them?
---
Please can you help me i want to buy some DLC for DBD
---
Why post this on this subreddit of all places?
---
You have a template of this my dude? lol
---
This will top Toxic Nea. Those ears are so "Sup bitch, catch me if you can."
---
Here's the real question though.  Would Darkness be a survivor so she can get killed over and over again? Or would she be a killer and just run headfirst into pallets?
---
All your actions have a speed decrease, though, so healing someone probably also takes longer.
---
Finally someone with some respect
---
Ugh... Brand new part, decisive and old Mori ? No thanks
---
A rework.. that makes him less powerfull
---
Did you read the question he asked in the post?
---
Careful with that if you're on PC. A friend of mine played Leatherface against a group like this and killed them all at once with his chainsaw, right after he hooked the 2nd one he started getting DDoS'd, they kept his internet down for 4 hours just because he didn't farm with them.
---
I started using a VPN after hearing about that, apparently it's much more common than you'd expect.
---
Hat is matte black got the boots thats black to match
---
You could improve on the shading, but overall it's pretty good.
---
I should‚Äôve made the perk more explanatory. When an object is used in a chase or is blocked off, you no longer get it‚Äôs aura until after the chase. I may have to tweak this. How does WoO affect illusionary pallets?
---
Sure are a lot of rank 1 noobs running around.
---
If the killer has sloppy butcher 2 heals equals a gen (80secs)
---
Meg mains are Master Race.
---
What are you even talking about with this, "gatekeeping" shtick?
---
An I mean, when you use a term like "monster" to describe yourself and "audacity" to play a game you pay money for to play, you clearly are carrying a chip on your shoulder about something, no?
---
An feelings aside about anything, new players are by definition noobs, so when someone claims about an influx of bad players at lower ranks, it's not that hard to put 2 and 2 together.
---
DbD goes to games pass = more noobs in lower ranks.
---
And there maybe less DCs at rank 20, but there sure is alot more suicides on first hooks and people not going for rescues. Which is always popular with beginners.
---
I mean.. even the heavy map pressure killers like Spirit, Billy, and Nurse use it. What other perks are they gonna use? Bloodhound? üòÇ
---
That's how I've always felt about it too. 1-2 stacks is whatever, 3-4 can screw me up pretty good, 5 stacks is a relief from the 3-4.
---
zzz nice troll
---
Doesn‚Äôt really matter Why you Said it since it‚Äôs still an insult while you were criticizing him for using insults and telling him about how hipocritical he was being 
---
I don‚Äôt go around calling others brainless so i don‚Äôt See What importance My spelling has but ok
---
I agree that a typo doesn‚Äôt prove anything but it‚Äôs still pretty rich of you to call others brainless
---
It's supposed to be completely random so I dunno.  Also have to factor in that most people don't go out of their way to find lullaby, but people who struggle with ruin will jump off their gen and immediately go totem hunting.
---
Father death is the Scream in-universe name of the costume used by Billy and  Stu.
---
About being OP, no it wouldn't, smart survivors would be able to differentiate one killer from the other, and at most it would give you one Feral Frenzy hit.
---
Thank you!!! ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•
---
But the concept and idea for the Lullaby is interesting though, it becomes more and more challenging as you hook Survivors. And it's gonna become extremely strong once full stacks.
---
Thus I was thinking Hex: Ruin could be changed something relative to Corrupt Intervention or Thrilling Tremors. Not to mention Ruin having claws around gens on the perk icon so it can be nerfed / buffed something like it. Or maybe giving it stacks like Devour Hope but each stack gives additional time on the the gens being blocked by the entity or regression but with a different timer on each stack.
---
Where is end game chat lol
---
I just won't two-man a gen during ruin. It makes too many skill checks and it'll never get done
---
Hell yeah
---
900 of those hours are spent waiting for servers
---
Perks in general are for noobs
---
i guess what i mean is since the timer is the same how does it get you killed? unless it was then just you
---
Nah, Nea's usually are the most salty survivors.
---
It was a green ping match.
---
Ps4?
---
Nope, a door would only be able to be opened up to 30% before all gens are done, this is so you can't just leave as soon as the game starts.
---
Getting face camped*
---
WHY DO SURVIVORS HATE KILLLER MAINS SO MUCH! WITHOUT KILLER MAINS THERE WOULD BE NO FUCKING GAME! AND WHY THE FUCK DO SURVIVORS HAVE TO BE TOXIC ASS SHIT AND TBAG AND JUST LITERALLY GO OUT OF THERE WAY TRY AND MAKE THE KILLER FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT. LIKE WHAT. THE . ACTUAL. FUCK. 
---
IT MAKES ME NOT WANT TO PLAY KILLER OR ONLY PLAY PIG AND GF  TO TBAG THE FUCK OUT OF THEM BECAUSE IM PETTY LIKE THAT. 
---
GODDDDDD IM LIKE ACTUALLY MAD
---
True
---
I like the suggestion I read on this sub the other day:
---
Nerf gen repair speeds so that Hex: Ruin isn't basically a necessity, and then rework Hex: Ruin into something else.
---
Bloodhound on muh Nurse is the cat's pajamas. Most people think after their first hit that they can urban away or lithe and hide but you follow that tasty red trail and bang biscuit, you've got yourself an easy down. I know you were just joking but I never thought I'd use Bloodhound as much as I do. Soooo many locker pulls while running it
---
Of course they do, but they are in the small realm of killers who can play without it and still accomplish something.  
---
I understand why the devs won't do something insane like buff Huntress movement speed, but stick her on a map like Red Forest and it takes goddamn forever to walk from one end to the other.  They could have a gen popped before you even see anyone.  And there's practically no way to counteract this except Ruin, and that's a problem.
---
my tip is to not look for answers to that question and ask a different question instead. that's a valuable tip
---
Nope neither pending or friends.
---
Kinda looks a little like meg too
---
At rank 12 games will vary wildly since people at that rank are terrible at the game but others havn't climb'd to their normal rank yet. Just worry about getting better at the game rather then killer/build.
---
42
---
PWYF is definitely an awkward perk. When it‚Äôs strong it‚Äôs VERY strong but if it isn‚Äôt then it‚Äôs not a big deal. In a game about chasing, anything that increases your speed when you‚Äôre already the faster one is a bit tentative. PWYF is, like you said, strong when used properly. However it doesn‚Äôt need to be broken to be good. People just need to use it more.
---
Him leaving got us killed by the Huntress cause we had 1 less teammate to help us try to escape at the exits. It‚Äôs not about the timer.
---
I would really rather not have babyface, we have far too many killers who use a basic knife as a weapon.
---
Sorry, I laugh in a strange way, I know lol
---
If you actually do make it, I'll be quite fascinated.
---
Or be me and be garbage at both roles!
---
That actually works?
---
Not even friends. There's some good randos out there in F13
---
hey mate, im loving your designs. are you thinking about making all addons too at some point?
---
Ok fair enough. But I don‚Äôt think the weapon necessarily gives the killer all its character though, but the cool thing with baby face is the time reset concept from the film (yes Ik he doesn‚Äôt control it necessarily, but who cares?¬£
---
"Wake up doing what it was designed for" no god damn idea what that means and its starting to give me a headache.
---
I find Lullaby more fun as a killer since most players don't seem to care about it and tend to ignore it till it is too late. While ruin is better at slowing the game down at the start I think lullaby is much better at getting games to snowball in your favor as a killer.
---
Now that's what I call clutch!
---
*taps you on the shoulder* I am so proud of you
---
I know when I'm having a bad game as killer vs. When I'm having a good game.  I don't let it bother me when someone teabags really.  The first time it happened I actually laughed because I thought it was funny.  
---
I do however avoid the exit gate when I lay an absolute egg.  I don't run to the gate to watch them teabag the hell out of me.  I typically just go find a corner and cry.
---
How I feel when I pop the last gen only to get NOED but my team uses the time to escape
---
LOOK BEHIND YOU WHEN YOU'RE OPENING GATES WHAT KIND OF BIG BALL MAD MAN ARE YOU???
---
9/10 smurfs is ridiculous to say, plus you're complaining that the survivors you face are too good and you want to pip to rank up? Don't understand.
---
DUDE, i feel the same way, it is so like day ruining
---
Had an idea for a meme but really wanted to go to bed, I work with what I have üòÇ
---
Us being far superior though!
---
Like for the obsession? Except I'm not sure if perk icon itself goes for the obsession unless devs decide to change it that way. ...It can also behave like Dying Light? Which is going to make tunneling even more annoying to succeed like if obsession dies, everyone else remaining in the trial gets the ruin the way it behaves originally.
---
For the example.
---
I didn't even notice. XD
---
Perks sometimes be the reason you win games, but in most cases the way you play the killer is more important. A couple of tips are to use the map to your advantage, don't take the fastest way to a gen, go though loops so that survivors have a harder time spotting you. Lean when you stalk as you are harder to spot. Don't crouch 24/7, yes you are harder to spot but move a bit slower. You can use your power as a mean of finding survivors. Activate it and if you start hearing the reveal sound you know someone is nearby. If you start stalking someone don't just mark them 100% instantly, they will see the EXPOSED status and will run away. If you play a bit like MM and 99% stalks you can do a quick M2 in chase to guarantee a down without wasting a bunch of time. Some perks I recommend are, RUIN, BBQ, Sloppy, Nurses, Thrilling Tremors, I'm all ears, Enduring + Spirit Fury, Bamboozle, Brutal Strength, Deerstalker, Knock Out, Discordance, Infectious Fright and Monitor and Abuse
---
*Monto voice* just a lil bit
---
I want to play killer for the BP but I can‚Äôt cause 25 minute wait times?? You‚Äôre kidding. Survivors take like three seconds max, and that‚Äôs a long wait time
---
I think this power might work for either one. 
---
Power: True Connection - After hitting a survivor you build a strong connection with the victim. The last survivor hit by your base attack become marked so that if you are facing the direction of the marked survivor their aura is revealed to you. You receive a 5% movement speed increase when moving towards a marked survivor. The mark is removed if the survivor is healed to full health and aura will be hidden while they are being healed by another survivor.

Niiiice

I just saw Us this week and have come obsessed. I would love to have The Tethered as a killer! There could be a skin for every survivor.
---
Scratches mirror Michael is a thing if nightmares
---
i‚Äôm in that comment and i don‚Äôt like it
---
So obviously I feel for you but you're kinda highlighting why BHVR made the changes. You said a 4K was super easy for you. And now past a 2K is hard. Well they've said ideally an average game has 2 survivors escaping and 2 dead. So that sounds on par with your experience here.
---
I don‚Äôt know why people keep posting these clips. Yes, there‚Äôs such thing as killers with bad internet. This happens when you play against them. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a ping bar at the bottom right in the lobby. If it‚Äôs too high, either don‚Äôt play against them, or don‚Äôt complain.
---
I don't know for sure, but most people suggested that a new objective should be added into the game.
---
Right now, most killers struggle a lot in high ranks, because most of them don't have map pressure and can't end chases too fast.
---
Why do you think people play just Nurse, Billy and Spirit in red ranks ?
---
Oooh that‚Äôs a great concept. Such a good film though!
---
Depends on the settings and resolution. I am quite certain it would NOT be at 99% on LOW and capped 60fps sitting in current DBD lobby.
---
IM SO EXTREMELY FUCKING MAD ABOUT NOT KNOWING WHAT THE FUCK DOES FUCKING SANDBAGGING MEANS, CAN YOU PLEASE FUCKING EXPLAIN, THANK YOU
---
I HATE TUNNELERS THEY NEED TO GO AND GET GOOD
---
That's a very Bruce Campbell thing to do
---
You should see the Hag's range.  Whenever she lunges, it's like she has on rollerblades!
---
I like it. I‚Äôd much rather see a tethered killer, as it‚Äôs much more iconic, with both the map and weapon they would use.
---
She's trans now lol
---
I never meant to insult anyone with this? I mean, sorry if I uhh... did?
---
You should at least get some fun out of the game, regardless the current state right now what we have in DbD makes a huge competition with rankings combined and since no other gamemode is available.
---
And no offence but tell me something I don't know, we've all been there.
---
Wait, what does this have to do with the new update? This has been a part of the game for years man. 
---
Also, if someone is down underneath a pallet and you suspect one of their teammates is around, you can bait the pickup by walking over to them and pretending to pick them up, only to stop and listen for their teammates footsteps as they come rushing over. When they do, chase their teammate and leave the other one slugged.
---
After a while I started playing survior too, it's tough
---
The dcs and idiot teammates who won't Save you plus being farmed off the hook without bt isn't really "having fun"
---
I would get my Feng to p3 all perks if they released this skin
---
What kind of trash Billy runs NOED? That shit is literally for sweaty M1 killers
---
Why is he Burger King?
---
Insult? I made legit question, if ruin is bad, then how should I enjoy a game that will last 1 chase? Could you please teach us the ways? Because I don't know any killer others than nurse billy and spirit
---
Removed - Uncivil behaviour
---
And I‚Äôll kill again. Gotta get that safety pip.
---
Neat!
---
Extremely relatable. I wanna buy him even more now.
---
IM GONNA RIIIIIDE TILL I CANT NO MORE
---
Didn't need to do it there? You literally got downed for going for the hook. It was so obvious you weren't going to get it either.
---
you load into the game : *boum* *boum* *boum *boum*
---
Higher the prestige the better gear u get so for perks, stay at 50. If you want to have better addons and that prestige
---
The category is salt/rant, so it's gonna be salty.
---
What rank are you.
---
I hope I don't go through whatever that phase is.
---
I see no such thing as best girl from up here...
---
OTHER THAN CLOWM
---
It also gets boring when survivors bring 3+ toolboxes and gens go 200 mph
---
And on your right you can see someone proving my exact point.  The most "toxic" people are the ones incessantly whining about the toxicity they create for themselves on the daily.
---
2019. Year of triggered drama queens.
---
If you haven't given killer a try it's definitely a great time. I'm not going to tell you what killer to play, but when I first started I tried playing as survivor and when I switched to killer I found out I was really fucking bad at survivor lol
---
If he looked behind him he would've known Freddy was way to close to go for the unhook. I'm rank 1 survivor and killer and know my shit. I guess it's not so obvious for some of you
---
Can't say about inability to wiggle, but I couldn't recover and didn't see the healing progress bar in a match against Bubba today. And that is after they rolled out a wall of text with fixes...
---
This isn't part of the new update. This has literally been in the game since launch.  Wtf are you on about?
---
It actually isn't. Survivors are notified of Lullaby by their first Skill Check and by the time you find someone, down them and hook them, there goes 2-3 gens.
---
That menu music though.
---
Sis, why u always destroy my toys
---
Are you saying the plague is a Thai bride?
---
I don‚Äôt understand the hate for this perk. I‚Äôm a survivor main and it‚Äôs never bothered me. I guess it sucks to get 1 tapped, but so many killers have that ability... idk
---
Really?! I actually had no idea I thought if a survivor pallet stunned you instantly after you pick them up you just walked away, as through previous experimentation, I guess the animation wasn't fully complete.
---
It would be helpful to know which killers you currently play and which perks you have :)
---
It's also worth noting you get points for your achievements in certain games. One of which being DbD. (It also doesn't matter when you got the achievements, just that you have it)
---
Where?
---
They are everywhere on this sub but i never play against 1 pig when i play survivor
---
[Here](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/469/775/49e.png) I literally just googled it
---
no it gave her ONE second. She would have made it anyway. The gate was already opened by 20%
---
I can relate. Didn't happen til my mid 30s though. 
---
I have fun playing games like dbd but due to work schedule I get home fairly late in the evening and if I play before I try to go to bed I get so amped up it's hard to fall asleep.
---
First of all, I ain't a developer. I'm just a player who dedicated enough hours into this game on both sides and respectfully know few things or another. 
---
Also also, it's not always Nurse, Billy or Spirit or EVEN Wraith can go scout around the map just to give pressure.
---
Each Killers have their own powers that supposedly counters one or two things and I can definitely say if you know how to play them and you know every bit of each map then you can succeed even without perks. For me it's important to have fun, if you didn't catch all of them then it's not a big deal.
---
Thus every Killer we have right now especially new ones are being slapped with previous Killers' powers. Almost like a bootleg version but they still work I guess. I can go over a long long and I mean very long PSA and the state of this game but this is just a reply so. And not gonna derail off the topic.
---
if a survivor gets downed at a pallet you need to look around if theirs any survivors near by waiting for you to pick them up
---
Slide me a couple more stacks and then we can talk

NURSE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET OFF ANOTHER BLINK AFTER A PALLET STUN EITHER. WTF, LOVE GOING AGAINST NURSE BUT HAD WAY TOO MUCH BULLSHIT THE LAST COUPLE DAYS WITH THIS.
---
Hm, guess it's not reddit without at least one negative comment. This is my first time posting my art for strangers anywhere and I was nervous
---
Hey man, welcome to the fog!
---
Killer can be tough, and there are SO MANY things to learn in order to get better. There's literally too many to list here, but my best advice to you would be to find a killer you enjoy playing, stick to em and earn bloodpoints, and then level up leatherface to get his teachable perk BBQ and Chili. BBQ is a great tracking perk and helps you get more bloodpoints, so you can level more stuff.
---
Also, there is a great guide on YouTube by Scottjund (killer main that streams, you should check him out.)

Good luck!
---
people here just bash the game but if someone ask them if its a good game, Theyll probably highly recommend it.
---
Believe it or not my mother 900 miles away didn‚Äôt tell me to go to bed, but seeing as I stayed up late to finish watching the two towers I really needed to go to bed to get up earlier in the morning. I didn‚Äôt realize you were going to have such a emotional reaction to my meme, speaking of mother‚Äôs, did yours not hug you enough?
---
I just played 3 matches with GF and it was not easy for them to break me out of it. I just bought the DLC so idk how it was a few days zgo
---
I switch roles and get more frustrated half the time, like deadass if I go two or three games of straight bullshit, and I switch, I normally get matched against more toxic bullshit. So, if I‚Äôm not having a good time within the first like, 3-4 matches I normally quit and either stop playing things in general or switch games
---
It wasn‚Äôt deleted. To be honest it‚Äôs been easier to detect him because they doubled the detect radius
---
You didn't said how to counter gen rush tho, you are saying to me that ALL rank 1, all 8k + hours streamers, all videos about how to killer, they all are wrong saying that most killers don't have enough map pressure against good survivors, but you, a randon user is the only right? Well, then I guess we all should git gud, right?
---
As far as I saw from your profile, you are at leas level 150+, so there's 3 reasons to you say stuff like wraith have map pressure in games:
---
You never past green ranks (it's easy to make map pressure against low tier survivors)
---
You are actually brain dead
---
You are salt farming
---
In any of those cases I care enough to keep replying to you, ao you stay with your ruinless map pressure wraith and we all the others keep our minds that it's dump that 90% of all killers need to use a single perk
---
Rank?
---
‚Äú**HUH?  DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?**‚Äù- No Mither user
---
Am I the only person who plays DbD that enjoys being a solo Survivor? I'm a great team player, too.
---
You just need to start it. I had the same burnout problem, don't feel like playing anything. But the thing is, I know what I like, and know the game which is coming out soon, or was realeased years ago will be up my alley, I just kinda never wanted to press start.
---
Now I'm playing through horizon zero dawn, which was sitting in my library untouched for good 6 months, because I never wanted to started it, even tho I knew I'm gonna love it. And guess what? I'm loving it so far, being maybe 20h in. 
---
DBD is different tho. I know for a fact it's gonna piss me off, and I actually haven't played it for maybe 5 days, since ghostface realease, since it was a broken mess, and I was getting all sort off different bugs, including T possing killers, random disconnects in a middle of match, sounds being all over the place etc. Plus all ghostfaces where camping aholes. And being in red ranks doesn't help from playing with absolute potato teammates. I mean we lost a match against perkless wraith... in red ranks... And the reason is everyone was too afraid to do gens... I was hooked, all three left gens, and was just hiding... I actually got a warning after the match from PlayStation, because I had few bad words to say to my team after the match (not the smartest thing I done, but emotions took over, teammates pissed me off to no end). I will see if patch helped with the game, if not I might take a brake until Freddie is patched, tho it will probably bring mountain of new bugs. DBD at this point feels more like a job than game, you invested a lot of time in it, you don't want to just let it go.
---
I once was fixing gen with spine chill and missed Myers pulling my teammate off the gen. Scared the shit out of me.
---
11, today is the first time I played killer since rank reset.
---
Allow me to once again open the post while queueing, leave it open for many hours, and then comment without refreshing the page. Apologies for the last one my dude.
---
The satisfaction of camping, just to piss people off, it's euphoria.
---
I like using the add-on because it‚Äôs like Barbecue and Chili is always on

His power has a 1 minute and 30 second cooldown and only reverts time by a minute in that case, scaling with that he can never gain time or create a stalemate.

This version of Freddy is literally a pedophile....

Do not waste time at a pallet loop, just let them drop the pallet.

Wow, wake up saves a life
---
The game will last too long as only 30 seconds will pass at a time. Who would the time reverse apply to though?

i was going to insult you for using wake up exploit but then i realized it's an exit gate, the thing wake up was designed to work with

Watch killers on YouTube/twitch, you‚Äôll see that running survivors leave red scratch trails behind them for up to X amount of seconds
---
any chance you have the raw galaxy image?
---
Don‚Äôt worry, any killer that don‚Äôt emit a heartbeat always scared the crap out of me. I remember one time Myers was just right behind me and I didn‚Äôt realize it for the longest of times. I crapped my pants the second I turned around

so its the corn fields that are bugged and considered as wall ?? because i was being chased and was watching him the whole time and he still got his power :/

1. She's amazing! Great work! 2. Please do Rin. 3. Please do me in this Disney princess-style.

Hmmm I think survivor who wastes god pallet first thing so ppl call her a baby survivor, as well as someone running a toxic purple flashlight and teabagging the killer so she gets facecamped

Only playing as survivors have pissed me off lately. They do some real stupid things.
---
But, they've done enough stupid things that I'm currently 6-1 as Freddy. Other than my loss (had no idea how to play him) survivors live on via disconnection.
---
Apart from all the tips below, if you face toxicity, always ignore it. Do not entertain them or it will just make you more mad. Its a 4 v 1 toxicity match, you won't win. See a toxic nea tea bagging for you to chase them, don't chase them. Tunnel, camp, who cares. No one should follow other peoples made up rules.
---
Lol I didn‚Äôt post it in animemes...? did someone steal my meme ;-;
---
That's the way art is though. Once you know how good it can get, you're never going to be happy with your own. It's like the curse of Art. Also, if you don't present it in as humble a way as possible you get a bunch of troglodytes showing up in comments. In that sense, it's the lesser of two evils.
---
Idk ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I used to hate NOED  
---
Then I started playing killer and how hard they have it  
---
I'll never complain about it again lmao
---
I guess you‚Äôre right.
---
Still pisses me the feck off though
---
 I'm just gonna re-post this cause I don't want to re-type it:
---
A Buff/Nerf is an adjustment to something that is otherwise working properly but not living up to expectations.
---
Fixing a bug is not a buff or a nerf, even if it makes something stronger or weaker, because it was not supposed to be doing whatever it is doing in the first place.
---
The only thing that was an actual nerf was the adjustments to his add-ons. They made actual buffs to the character which is great. He's decently viable and fun to play as even at mid to high tier ranks. 
---
The rest was just broken things that needed fixed or make sense in game. IE: pallet stuns knocking him out of shroud. It works that way for every killer (Except nurse which is fucking dumb but that's another argument for another day) so why shouldn't it work for him too?
---
This kind of torture isn‚Äôt enjoyable at all
---
no... it means Russian roulette YOINK time
---
Yep. It used to be maybe 30 sec for me. Now its 10 minutes every time. Killer is the superior way for blood points but it sucks because the game barely lets me play it.
---
Any reason why? Do killers see their totems and check it for survivors frequently?
---
The shitty Freddy was a pedo. Best boi Freddy Robert Englund was just a simple child murderer trying to make his way in the galaxy. But to be fair, in game Freddy is pedo Freddy :(
---
Chill, you‚Äôre both right, like that one girl in the taco commercial said, ‚Äúwhy not have both‚Äù?
---
N'aw, I'm not the biggest movie guy. Too many hobbies already.
---
Aqua would legit go up to the killer to ask for directions to the hex totem, bwt she would
---
yes
---
Right, i need to get over it, even though i was the one that pointed out the flaw in a chill manner, while you couldn't have been calm and just-- whatever, the salt one reddit amazes me.

Aaaaand *spin*
---
(Oh boy, if this is how you're gonna tone with this...)
---
I never stated anything related towards what you just said. Neither I said anyone is wrong.
---
And since you're actually judging me by my profile, which is hilarious thank you very kindly for going with such absurd level with me. Thus not even checking achievements to briefly understand that I have reached Rank 1 once but otherwise you wouldn't care to think of this. Lastly, I included Wraith because of his cloaked speed. He is only good on catching up on a Survivor and thus his add-ons give him some boost, I didn't even rate him or stated Wraith's situation and you're already bombing me... ouch man.
---
But what gives I have all day too! Although definitely not gonna spend on derailing on a topic. Since you seem to be doing it already.
---
Awesome, may I have it? For perks If you got one
---
Good stuff. Now it's Doc who's going insane.  
---
On a side note, it looks like you got a medium vault on that window. I guess that's from the changes they did to window vaults recently? Guess you hit the window before vaulting there so you lost the fast vault.
---
Like I said, I‚Äôve been trolling, you were going with it for a while then made a weird mom joke in there so I trolled a little harder, thanks for the advice on the meme.
---
Came here to post the exact same thing. I've completely given up on playing killer altogether during this event. The loading times are at an all time low and only allows those who have the patience to get a killer lobby. Hopefully dedicated servers fix this because for me events ruin the game imo.
---
No, I saw a darkness meme and my brain assumed that's where it'd be coming from
---
I relate to this soo much. It‚Äôs my way of keeping things balanced
---
Can't play it seriously or you will notice you getting grouped with rank 5 when your a rank 15 for no reason.

When Sally's just trying to Mori you but she don't know youre freaky like that

isnt more of a rework :thinking:

It's just 3rd person League with shorter matches and QTE's. 
---
At least you only have 3 teammates and 1 enemy to play against, instead of 4 of the former and 5 of the latter.
---
Wat?
---
I didn‚Äôt know that the same applied to survivors without injuries. That‚Äôs good to know.
---
Ah okay. For me it seems like every other game I'm up against a SWF on comms but maybe I just have Tru3 syndrome.
---
Literally everyone and everything.
---
I think Survivors exaggerate how hard it is being a solo Survivor. All those things you listed sound like problems when you're in level 20 rank, yes (except rage DC, which the higher I rank, the more I see). I'm not a high rank (level 14), but at this level, Survivors play pretty smart and don't do the obviously dumb shit.

Im 16 and I do that a lot, sucks
---
Yes and sounds in general has been totally fucked since GF release. First time going against a huntress today and experienced exactly this. She had no direct lullaby, and the terror radius is really low (also no chase music which is good when playing killer but not survivor)
---
I‚Äôm keeping their comments but ok
---
Imo Clown is one of the better anti-loopers since you can force survivors to run through your gas if they want to continue through a window/pallet. Plague is harder to get a handle of at first but once you get her vile purge aim down, she's good at dropping survivors fast. I usually don't have too much of a problem with green rank survivors with Plague, just takes some practice. Might even be good to practice at low level for Plague so you can get a feel for how fast her vile purge breaks survivors.
---
What a waste of a cake.
---
During 2x BP I was in an all cake lobby and was so confused as to why players were running to the killer and crouching and raising...
---
I legit ran around and did all the generators and left.
---
Killer got pissed I didn‚Äôt let him get a hit on me as I ran to the exit.
---
I even got a hate message complaining that I wasn‚Äôt feeding him points
---
It looks really nice im excited to see it finished! Keep up your good work

And yet ... I just can't stop.

And then NOED kicks in
---
you love wasting pallets, don't you
---
This is because currently no one is motivated to play survivor. Killers earn much more bloodpoints so people would rather play that, not to mention a new killer just came out. Finally, with all the camping killers recently, people have given up playing survivor.
---
That‚Äôs the ultimate achieving the dream moment ever
---
Nah.... that's too vague and too weird...
---
Baby Face Perks
---
Lets Start Over:  Kicking a Generator it takes 100% longer as a normal kick but causes the generator to regress 10/20/30% faster than normal.
---
Lets Do It Again!:  A survivor who is rescued from a hook gains the broken, exhausted, and exposed statuses for 40/50/60 seconds and their aura is revealed to you when they are within 12/24/36 meters.  During this time if you hook the survivor again they do not progress to the next stage of the hooking process and their current stage resets.  This perk becomes inactive if there are no other unhooked survivors in the match.
---
The Same, But Different:  When hooking a survivor you have hooked before the sacrifice happens 5/10/15% faster if hooked to a previously unused hook.
---
Auto aim never left lol
---
Yeah but l4D 1 and 2 appeared on Xbox so it's confusing why they wouldn't allow him on Xbox. Probably because Xbox fucked up their relationship with valve by wanting to charge for the DLCs. Greedy ass corporations üòí

Yea but the survivors sadly didn‚Äôt

They need to fix hooks. Can't wiggle free anymore with there being one every ten feet on the map.
---
Yeah, NOED is almost required for killers that lack the pressure to prevent gens - trapper, biting bong boi, Freddy rn, etc

If you play vs any of those, just do all the totems

How do I delete someone else's comment?
---
I guess that may be the reason why I stopped playing this game. 90% of my games consist of either braindead teammates or a killer that only cares about himself and plays like a complete cunt. Why should I waste my time playing a game that makes me feel miserable?
---
Don't get me wrong I love this game but the fact that devs are completely oblivious to *why* disconnecting is so prevalent tells a story.
---
It's one of the reasons why I disagree with people that are like "we should punish disconnecters" instead of "we should punish consistent disconnecters". People disconnect because they're not having fun, I don't blame them. I don't blame anyone for disconnecting when facing a toxic swf or a toxic p3 nurse that slugs and camps.
---
Sorry I kinda just went on a rant.
---
Oh ok thnx, yeah leatherface is a pretty good killer.
---
I just got confused because I've never seen it and I didn find it in the wiki either.
---
Many people seem to assume that hosting a stationary lobby with 0 gameplay showing green ping equals good games. Ping will rise once the game starts. Quite a lot depending on how good the hosts internet actually is. If people truly think that the survivors hotbox is 3feet behind them there's an issue.

I hate to farm, but it‚Äôs so rare to see this, I always farm with that many cakes/bps.  Honestly, if I was to categorize match types I hate, farming is definitely the least offensive while also being so rare.  If you act like a hardo and don‚Äôt farm in this scenario, you‚Äôre a curmudgeon.

WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL OF THE FUCKING PALLETS NOW THIS GAME IS EVEN WORSE!

It lessensthen eliminates the skill check warning and gives bonus regression on failed skill checks

You know the first part is the same as ruin right? Lol . Second part holds true but lullaby is more end game and poor man's ruin
---
A lot of people get mad or want to make people mad because they find it funny. Turn of your messages and just play survivor until you get better or join a group of friends or find fandoms through a community and just play together. Sometimes you have to bite the bullet though because there will be people who will camp you, tunnel etc. just don‚Äôt be toxic towards the killer in game and maybe they‚Äôll not camp you etc y‚Äôknow. I don‚Äôt really know what to say other then don‚Äôt let it bother you too much and if you aren‚Äôt having fun just don‚Äôt play the game, but if you wanna play just keep playing until you get better. When I first started playing I was so bad but eventually you‚Äôll start doing better
---
I love when lithe activates, I'm well out of the window and then BAM I'm on the ground

Thats because the guys who own Scream dont own the rights to the mask.
---
Another company (Fun World) own the rights to the mask. 
---
And BHVR only got the rights to the mask, not the the movie.
---
No I just think people in general should scrap using Urban Immersion.  It basically just wastes time and gets your teamates killed due to the playstyle it encourages.
---
Honestly I don't care for Sprint Burst at all.  I hate the concept of always having to walk to preserve your exhaustion.  Again timewaster.  Whenever you're in a position to run, you should run to be as efficient as possible with time management.  If a killer is chasing elsewhere it is a waste of your time to walk.  Besides dead hard is so much more useful and controllable.  I'd take Balanced over Sprint Burst too.
---
Those shards. Nice.

I need some pain relievers after watching one of his videos...

It's the funniest thing ever when they try to 360 and just end up walking right into you
---
...Yes
---
Well you can actually Sprint with Sprint Burst so you don‚Äôt need to walk.
---
the first thing i would ask is what the counterbalance would be. Otherwise, this just adds more work to survivors without balancing.
---
Why do people call in tunneling if the killer chases you after you try (and fail) to loop them? Isn‚Äôt that what killers are supposed to do....chase you? Lmao.
---
yeah... you shoulda farmed ngl. and i HATE farming
---
Feng gang roll out
---
Sounds cool but makes ruin way too strong
---
The other day I tried to use Autodidact. I still think you should only start with -15% so only the first skill check is negative. I only ended up with 3 token, and then no more skill checks after that :(
---
I always do the totems no matter who I play against since NOED has become just the biggest commodity since EGC, I still think it's kind of a crutch. I only ever play it when running specific end game builds. It's about knowing when to break chases and patrol gens to get map pressure. There are just better perks to run than NOED and relying on it to get kills just doesn't make you a better killer in the long run.
---
Boil Over lmao
---
It's good practice when playing killer to go straight over to your totems at the start of the round to make sure survivors didn't spawn near it.
---
From a survivor point of view, if you find a totem when the round starts, leave it alone for a minute or so just incase the killer comes to check on it. Once they're gone then cleanse it.
---
Also, if at the start of a round you see the killer checking an area with no gen, it's safe to assume  that's where his totem is, so wait for him to leave then go over.
---
People who just wanna play the game as intended are curmudgeons. Got it.
---
I know it sucks to hear but the only way to avoid the toxics is to be kinda selfish. If survivors are toxic just don‚Äôt revive them or unhook them. If the killer is toxic try not to be seen and avoid him at all costs/wait for the hatch to get a possible pip. 
---
Usually when you enter the higher ranks the toxicity simmers down a notch and it becomes more about teamwork and objective instead of just people lallygagging and trying to piss others off. 
---
I‚Äôve learned throughout the years that no matter what you WILL get those games where it‚Äôs just a waste of time, you just can‚Äôt let it get to you. On to the next one as I say. Eventually you will get good enough to be a little toxic back and give em a taste of their own medicine! Best of luck to you
---
I‚Äôm commenting so I can come back to this later
---
That‚Äôs the issue with autodidact, the skills checks just don‚Äôt happen. My idea to balance auto is that if you self care, your autodidact stacks affect it (but you cannot gain stacks from it) so if you have 25% regression (0 stacks) and hit a self care skill check, you lose 25% progress and stay at 0 stacks. Same goes for +50% progression.
---
Yes they can see it, have you not played as a killer?
---
Oh my god I just noticed lmao üòÇ
---
&gt; use it better then you
---
I mean, with enough game time you'll know where the killer is or what they're up to without needed a perk telling you "oh hey they're looking your way X meters away". 
---
You'll hear the killer coming your way anyways. You can hear every killer a mile away (in case they don't have a TR or lullaby in Freddy's case). 
---
Spine Chill promotes a playstyle which will get your team (and probably you as well) killed.
---
Assuming Nurse and Billy are two of them, whose the third? Spirit? 
---
I only make it to purple ranks and see pretty much every killer.
---
He had you all on death hook SOOOO
---
Not to mention if that door had been opened just a little bit less prior, you would've gotten killed too.
---
Stop looking through my windows
---
What a bunch of fucking losers lul.
---
Changed it so its a slow instead of a stun
---
Killers see the aura of any hex totems they have. Typically, yeah, at the start of the match they'll mosey over to it to ensure no survivors found it straight off. The majority of killers won't keep checking their totems (Unless they are using TotH which lets them know someone's touching one). You'll often find it's bad killers who do this, as it eats up a lot of time. The exception to this is trappers and hags who can basically use their power as an alert to know if someone's near it.
---
Yeah, EGC made noed more powerful imo. 
---
Because survivors now have a limited amount of time to find the hex totem and it usually ends up with the first hooked survivor (after the noed reveal) to be left hanging because nobody wants to risk it.
---
Agitation could be switched with Whispers, which is a non-teachable perk.
---
Whispers is really good on Billy. The perk greys out if no survivors are nearby, so if no one's around, zoom somewhere else until it says someone's near. Saves a bunch of time hunting people at the start and at the end.
---
Same reason blood warden is making such a comeback
---
The game is already bent in their favor, no counterplay needed, there wouldn't be a progress bar for these secondary objectives, simply grab and go. The counterbalance would be lack of tracking, most tracking perks require you to be close anyway, or are generator orientated. Minus BBQ but you need someone to down first.
---
I do not disagree.
---
I see you extrapolated what you wanted out of that..
---
515% more bloodpoints for everyone...
---
I'm not a fan of farming either, but you made a mistake here.
---
You don't have a macro that auto connects and disconnects to avoid skill checks so you can watch anime while you play?
---
Thana is useless if there‚Äôs more than 1 person on a gen or they have a toolbox. Just use Discordance and Franklin‚Äôs and you will be fine üòÅ.
---
Yep Tier 1 myers and moonwalking/looking away counter spine chill
---
You just made this a eye spy game for me because I can't find it
---
I need to get games like that, I havent had a game in a good month where all 5 gens got completed
---
Killers who wish to play normal aren't assholes. Survivors need to realize that some people don't like farming.
---
Aggressive gen patrols with starting and ending chases efficiently while abandoning chases you know you cannot end efficiently is the key to slowing down the gens.  You need to be relentless.  With all due respect 9/10 killers who complain about genrushing do it to themselves with poor decision making and an unoptimal playstyle.  Typically over committing to chases which is the deathrattle of every killer game.
---
Another day, another post incorrectly blaming hitboxes for ping issues
---
See videos like this make me wish that Wake Up was less godawful so you could have more exciting moments like this.
---
Taking a bunch of testosterone pills it seems.
---
Flair checks out
---
I spy with my little eye, concepts that the devs were to lazy to develop.
---
(Even though they couldn‚Äôt add the teacher because of gameplay issues.)
---
Reminds me of that artwork some artist did named Label with a few killers dancing with each other in suits and dresses.
---
Wait what was the teacher suppose to b
---
potato potato
---
Hypothetical question....... What would that baby look like?
---
Did your favorite Youtuber told you that? Lol. A good Plague always brings a apple so she will have her power regardless. You guys not cleansing is just helping her get a 4K snowball.
---
I have no idea because they never said. The only clues to him were the trapple, Alan unnamed perk icon, and the graduation cap.
---
DARN
---
The reason why this is a horrible idea is because it is a buff to campers.  You can't do anything to make the matches longer by default for survivor side without playing right into the hands of these babykillers.  It would just give them more time to facecamp a survivor to death before they go out and catch a second.  Genrushing is the only counter to this crutch ass playstyle and your suggestion nerfs that.
---
Crack
---
i ran into this exact same issue yesterday. I had to work around it by going into a closet then coming back out. This allowed me to mend myself.
---
It may be a fluke, but i'd say it's worth trying as your only other alternative is to die :-\
---
Welcome to DbD community, dip a toe into the lagoon of toxic sludge and get pulled into the whirlpool.
---
I guess I have just noticed it more lately.
---
Yikes, someone‚Äôs salty..:
---
Ya well I get the huntress then!
---
&gt;I would love head on more if it was reliable. Too many times have I tried to use it, and just ended up getting grabbes
---
I just got stunned by Head On while I was standing BEHIND the wall - so sometimes its over-reliable :D
---
Thanks, I've never really used Whispers, but it sounds pretty good. Will check it out for sure!
---
i honestly find it fucking hilarious when i get hit by the killer and do a huge flip. i just can't help but laugh, especially when the killer is a little runt like Legion
---
Wow, I've never seen a rank 21 Match before
---
Get used to the long queue times since
---
1 - Ghostface just came out
---
2 - Playing as a killer is less frustrating than playing as solo survivor contrary to popular belief
---
3 - Killer gets you much more bloodpoints than survivor. Its common to get more than 20K as killer each game, while as survivor you have to sweat your balls to get to 20K
---
4 - There are bugs as survivor right now like the chase music, vaults, issues with mending and healing, etc.
---
my anus was clenched so hard, goddamn
---
Family Guy reference.
---
And we need to give you 0.64$
---
I mean hey if you think that power to you homie personally it‚Äôs gotten me out of shitty situations
---
Am I a furry for wanting a huntress body pillow or am I just weird?
---
Hey man, you implied it. I just cleared the air.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm experiencing this a lot on PS4. People instantly disconnecting. It screws up the game for everyone else.
---
And it‚Äôs helped me more times then it‚Äôs fucked me
---
i mean, it sucks getting killed, but it \*is\* the killer's only job. What's wrong with using a Mori?
---
You're you dont worry about the labels just do what you like.
---
Agreed
---
They would have to balance the base mechanics of this game first before adding new ones in.
---
that moment when they noticed it in the bug fixes but just changed what's written...  [https://gyazo.com/cfc4139d9841953c4bda284b468fbb99](https://gyazo.com/cfc4139d9841953c4bda284b468fbb99)   
---
time to cry
---
Upvoted for your username. Glad to see a fellow member on here :)
---
You didnt play optimally. You didn't cleanse totems.
---
If they added a totem counter to the HUD it would be much better and I'm a killer main. I don't use NOED though. If the gates get opened I don't mind smacking the survivors on the ass on their way out. When you just play for fun and don't care about kills the game is fun even against tbagging and all that shit. I won't even camp after the gates are open. Playing console Nurse I go around breaking all the pallets I blinked through during the game.
---
No.
---
this is actually amazing. if only doctor could control his hallucinations by spawning them with ctrl or smth.. that'd be nasty
---
That's seriously so annoying. When did this game get so buggy?
---
Dude holy fuck same he barely moved ranks and he‚Äôs better then me
---
NOPE NOPE NOPE
---
Just hit the great skill checks, I'm not exactly sure what you mean by "boring" it's not like normal gens are any more fun.
---
You're a child
---
I agree BUT he always wears glasses so he can cheat at staring contestsü§îü§îü§î
---
Most relatable thing ever
---
With that much salt you could have a salt factory going at least 40 years before it ran out.
---
It's literally just a video. Take from it what you want, but nothing was said about hitboxes or ping.
---
Trying to get a Trophy in the game is toxic, yep. Nobody really likes playing against that kinda build, sure, but it's part of the game...
---
Are you implying you want to nerf the staple of all killers?
---
Depends; Spooky Lunchboxes and Flashlights did
---
When they added ghostface
---
Stop...... Please the both of you
---
No you're looking at it wrong.  That was definitely a tunnel.  The killer gave up the entire game to solely overcommit to a single chase for one survivor.  Literally allowed multiple gens to pop and a door to open  He played it horribly.  Then again he was running noed safety net so he was basically at peace with losing the game and depipping so long as he could crutch out one down.  So to answer your question no a killer isn't supposed to just chase blindly.  The key to playing killer well is knowing when to abandon a chase.
---
That being said OP it hurt my soul to watch all them pallets you camped.  Loop them first.  You redeemed it a little at the shack but the traditional pallets were all wasted.
---
I thought this was the persona subreddit
---
Just hit the skill checks
---
‚ÄúOP‚Äù ... it takes him forever to get it and once he does it can still run out. If he has Tuft of Hair along with it then it takes even longer. Yes, these add ons are good but you can counter them.
---
At least BHVR openly admitted that there is an issue with the matchmaking..
---
When I see an entire team with medkits it's always funny to switch to plague
---
I just watched the first ~40 seconds of the video where he immediately called the killer out for tunneling after the pallet drop. I didn‚Äôt know he chased during the entire video.
---
And that my friend is why Meddle of man went from the best perk to the worst perk.
---
The people that need this information do not use search.
---
Initially I thought it was the m1 after the pallet dropped lol
---
Ok I let a few odd people pass.... But you can NOT get on this flight to sane people land infact.    SECURITY GET THIS HORRID THING OUTTA HERE
---
Honestly ild give up a perk slot to just help me punch hex:ruin down a notch. Im fine with not surviving, but i dont like generators lasting forever and the game feeling like a complete sluggish grind.
---
Dying at 4-5 gens left isnt fun, i want it to be exciting, even if i dont live
---
&gt;Insult? I made legit question, 
---
Lol
---
Oh god yes
---
You've only been to rank 1 once? No wonder.
---
I can‚Äôt get past rank 7 with piggy :(
---
If Protection worked properly, Mettle would still be top tier, and it would fit the character it came from. It would also not just be an automatic safety net like it was when it was released.
---
But, again, even as a killer, it sucks to see someone actively trying to protect their allies and not getting rewarded for it
---
I saw it
---
I think we ALL saw it
---
GlenOck owns 128 different accounts duh
---
He had permanent Tier 3.
---
A macro that gen taps?
---
Yes. As stated probably atleast a hundred times since Ghostface came out. When only a new killer comes out, of course there will be more people playing killer instead of survivor. Next time use the search bar.
---
I commented that like.... A second or two before you replied
---
SWF can be a hard counter to the stealth ability, but at the same time I‚Äôm waiting to play ghost again because I have a feeling killers have been having a hard time with him because survivors knew people are going to be playing him so they picked the perks to counter him. Once he fades out I want to see if he‚Äôll be more effective since survivors won‚Äôt be expecting him every game.
---
Ikr

Stop
---
It hurts
---
Kk üòÇ
---
Ugh. I think gens are way too fast as killer but the survivor side of me also doesn't want to sit there on gens for longer than I already have to.
---
not from a survivor
---
You just finish breaking a pallet. The meg you were chasing is long gone and you see this halfway across the map on one of those little hills. what do you do?
---
I think part of the problem is that originally with the bug you had to crouch, press shift, then release crouch. I noticed you were crouching and probably had shift pre-pressed (I do that too just as a habit when I'm crouching in case I need to run away!) and then you un crouched and ran. I guess for now until it's actually fixed, try and avoid doing that?
---
Everytime i have a good match i just stop the game and play something else because im scared that ill be bullied next match
---
You have your strats I have mine
---
Not everything‚Äôs black and white and so absolute. While, yes, everyone should be playing the game as intended, there are rare outliers. A game with 515% more bp is definitely the exception.
---
Doing gens. You?
---
You‚Äôre either a noob, a huge asshole, or both.
---
Flashlights? I sleep
---
Toolboxes? REAL SHIT
---
Kage Bunshin no jutsu!
---
Obviously :) I'm just trying to understand why someone would use the perk.
---
&gt;He had permanent Tier 3.
---
Permanent Tier 3 with Tombstone Piece is a major misplay and with Judith's Tombstone, it takes the entire game to get to EW3 unless survivors feed him. 
---
He is slower because of Judith's so, instead of allowing him to stalk you freely, you can just run around any object (doesn't even have to be a loop) and its pretty much an infinite. 
---
This build only works if multiple survivors allow him to stalk for extended periods of time.
---
I didn't even know you could do that.
---
I'M NOT YOUR PAL, FRIEND!
---
That sure is a shame.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs different on PC but on console we don‚Äôt have the brightness/gamma so seeing certain killers is aids so spine chill is pretty good
---
&gt; 88
---
and you're a Nazi
---
Im referring to those who play in a set of 3-4, bring party streamers, their most OP items and sometimes abuse object of obsession. Those people know exactly what they‚Äôre doing.
---
Tombstone plus Tuft of Hair. Do you realize how MUCH he needs to stalk to reach tier 3? That alone balances it out. Also he has a slower movement speed IIRC. It's not OP. Just don't let yourself be stalked so much. Sorry but if Myers reaches Tier 3 with all the Evil Within he needs with those add-ons then it's on you guys.
---
How does one go from a DBD game to school shooting lol. The state of some of these players.... Pathetic.
---
Pig stunned by pallet oink is literally OP and the cutest thing in the game
---
Ah console. Do you use a headset?
---
I play on PC btw.
---
I cannot master this... every attempt I make I just go straight down the hole. I'm pretty confident I've ended up in a compilation video somewhere because of it üòÇ
---
Its not friends playing with friends in different ranks, the people purposefully exploiting the ranking system. Theres a difference between people playing casually and a 4 man crew bringing instaheals, flashlights and OoO to try and bully new players. Normally there‚Äôs one low rank account and the rest are all red ranks. Sometimes you can tell the rank 14 or whatever isnt a true rank 14.
---
I was going to watch it but some people said it wasn't that good.
---
well, I main evil Claudette.
---
Pause at 0:07 to see it's face.
---
Behaviour, you are missing an oportunity here, this could be your new killer. manifesting itself in the realm prio to it's apperance. In other words, make an Ermac.
---
Bubba is actually a wholesome boi, he's too innocent for what he has to do
---
I totally agree with you üíØ
---
He was fine, people just expected him to play like Myers.
---
You could say it was a shocking suprise
---
I notice your playing on Xbox.... The superior console for dead by daylight (don't hurt me please it's just an opinion)
---
The killer is fine, it‚Äôs just of an annoying human being decided to use him where it seems as if this killer is annoying. lol ve encountered some smart ghostface users, and some very annoying ones who camp the hook and tunnel, it‚Äôs an option, but just a cheap annoying way to play a game. Point is the problem usually isn‚Äôt the killer it‚Äôs the player controlling him
---
Ghostface just came out so everyone is playing killer right now plus it‚Äôs a new event. Everything should be back to normal once the event is over.
---
I do the same
---
It feels weird when using WGLF to be running the killer around (after unhooking someone or some such), get the +100 BP protection reward, and not get a token for it.
---
Those damn huntress addons are getting stronger every day /s
---
Throw in we‚Äôre gonna make it and it‚Äôs a fun side mission playing medic
---
Sounds like you‚Äôve been playing killers who want to depip on purpose so they can smerf.
---
why is gen rushing considered a playstyle? it's literally just doing the objective and really the only way to play
---
But its too scary
---
Is it reportable then?
---
The more work makes it balanced. Gens can go way too fast now because "it's the survivors' only objective", as people like to spew here so often. There should be no "compensation".
---
The projectiles act more of like the Plague‚Äôs vomit, being a **flurry** of multiple projectiles. Of the way to counter plague is to not cleanse, the way to counter iri hook is not get hit.
---
Yes it totally is
---
To be fair, Ebony Mori's shouldn't exist. Ivories I have no problem with though.
---
Can you for how likely to be fetishised  by teenage boys?
---
Thanks my dude
---
Is there a higher rez version of this?
---
that doesn‚Äôt seem like a very valid complaint, wouldn‚Äôt all killers be M1 killers if they can‚Äôt properly time their powers?
---
I think the killer should be able to see these items. They can't guard all of them at one time, especially if said items are sprinkled across the map as they should be.
---
TRUE FACTS: I HAVE NEVER BEEN ACCUSED OF DOING NOTHING UNLESS I WAS BASICALLY THE MVP OF THE MATCH
---
IT'S MOST LIKELY SOMEONE TRYING TO DEFLECT BLAME FROM THEMSELVES BY POINTING IT ELSEWHERE BEFORE IT EVEN STARTS FLYING, BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY'RE REALLY JUST CALLING MORE ATTENTION TO THEIR OWN INCOMPETENCE
---
BRING A MAGAZINE
---
I‚Äôve found that if you retaliate the toxic people get confused and they end up just quitting
---
CHA CHA REAL SMOOTH
---
They‚Äôll still work
---
 I honestly didn't even think about that. We'll report the AFK killers from now on. Thanks.
---
Man you need to get off the internet if you‚Äôre this easily annoyed. Come down off that high horse, you‚Äôre embarrassing yourself.
---
Nice job on the art OP!
---
Bummer. Not a fan at all as it looks unfinished. No more Nea for me.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
2. It isn't. It really isn't. 
---
3. Killers need to use add-ons every match so it balances out in the end. 
---
4. Lots of killer bugs too, that isn't why people aren't playing survivor, it was for the bloodpoints.
---
A lot of Killers who can't handle high ranks will afk or even quit to derank themself. Just report them.
---
I just got that skin. It‚Äôs *soo* good.
---
I was going to see it but my ticket said to get out so I didn't get to watch it.
---
Lol. Thats just unfair.
---
This is a really helpful guide for new players. One question though: why did you put Freddy at low mid tier and some other killers below him? It's generally accepted that Freddy is the worst killer. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just curious as to what your reasoning is.
---
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THEN HIGH LEVEL PLAYERS CAN NEVER PLAY WITH THEIR NEW FRIENDS, LEST THEY GET TOSSED INTO THE SHARK TANK WITH THE EBONY NURSES AND BILLIES
---
IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN MAKING SWF POINTLESS OR MAKING IT A TOOL FOR BULLYING, AND BOTH OPTIONS ARE ASS
---
My theory is that the killer must be seeing a survivor and you at the same time before you go and take a hit. I've tried coming out of nowhere and take a hit, and it didn't count. That's why it's easier to get a stack when you unhook. I really want those stacks.
---
Nice to know, I did get off the locker, I just thought it was kinda funny. :b
---
S T R O N K
---
Double tap seems really broken
---
&gt;When will this and the pig cosmetics be available for purchase?
---
Some Wednesday between the last patch and the next patch.
---
You realise noise doesn't factor into midgames? He doesn't have a red stain, so they can't see where you're coming from at a loop.
---
FUCK HIM PROBABLY ANOTHER CAMPING, TUNNELING GHOST FACE! 
---
PLAYED 5 GAMES LAST NIGHT, 4 OF THEM WERE AGAINST GF, 3 FACED CAMPED EYEBALL TO EYEBALL, 1 PROXY CAMPED AND THE LAST GAME WAS AGAINST A HAG WHO PLAYED THE GAME  LIKE ITS MEANT TO BE AND USED HER BBQ, WE ALL DIED BUT WE HAD A REALLY FUN TIME! FUCK THE REST!
---
It sure did.
---
You used to be able to pretty much just left click while any survivor was within a 360¬∞ angle anywhere around you and like 2meters and it would always instantly snap to the target and hit it = auto aim. 
---
They heavily toned it down so you at least have to be looking the survivor eventually. Keep in mind this is about 3 years ago by now tho lol
---
Gimme a source or I call bull. No way does it take just 5 seconds of stalking *at base* to go up a tier!
---
LIKE GENNER SAID ‚ÄúTHEY OPTED OUT‚Äù
---
Mine is like, 160 or something.  Farmer as clown, BBQ, and 3 cakes. Yummy.
---
Delicious
---
Yeah, no, I totally agree. And to make it worse, games like that seem to happen in streaks, like you'll have 4 or 5 really good games and then you can get 5 or 6 of the really bad ones.
---
It seems the only way to avoid getting bodied my a toxic SWF or sweaty killer is to just get better at the game, but it's really hard to get the practice you need when you don't get any chances to practice
---
\-Fixed an issue where Ghost Face was promising and almost mid-tier
---
Small Game has a 45¬∞ cone of activation. If you play ONE match against Ghostface, you'll know that the spotting angle is less than that. 
---
WAY less.
---
Billy will shit on low rank survivors all day, but Billy's consistency goes down against red rank survivors, and that's when the true difference between him and Spirit shines. 
---
This is coming from a Billy main btw, hence my name lol
---
They toned it down, but it was always there. "aim correction" might be a more accurate term for it.
---
Billy= Obey rules of pallets 
---
Spirit= Can Mindgame Pallets.
---
The thing is, game doesn't really count most important thing for survivor, how long can he survive in chase against a killer. Nothing else really matters that much for survivor mains. Everything else is just common sense, which many high rank players also lack. Don't 3 gen yourself, leave corner gens alone until where is 1 or 2 gens left, don't bring killer to the hooked survivor if you are in a chase, don't unhook if killer is nearby, don't open the doors but 99% them in case of bloodwarden, if someone is down in endgame, don't do gens together if it's a plag or a legion, don't waste pallets like a madman, especially it's not worth it in a start of the game, while ruin is still up and no one is doing anything productive, just opening up chests, searching for ruin, find LT wall and survive where for as long as you can etc.
---
The entitty
---
Omg NERF GHOSTFACE!!!!!!
---
Do you have any plans on doing portraits? Even if the galaxy is in the background of the portraits, it'd look hella nice
---
...yes
---
Yeah i totally said he needs a nerf
---
I dont agree, as spirit can go against good survivors much better than billy. Her power is also more consistently beneficial mid chase, as it is much less dependent on what the tile is.
---
You win some, you lose some. It shouldn't feel so horrible to lose. It should just be motivation to improve. If you hate losing that much I don't know how you could play multiplayer games at all.
---
You can‚Äôt break what‚Äôs already broken. I‚Äôll just miss how unique he is right now. They implemented a bunch of new, fun mechanics for him, but made him not that strong. I guess that‚Äôs why simple killers like nurse and billy are so strong. Y use many mechanic when few mechanic do trick. Y u pull people in sleep? Fast boi with instadown. Slow girl with teleport.
---
The first game I had after the hotfix was against a hag and I couldn‚Äôt drop any pallets. Her connection was okay but dipped sometimes. Happen to anyone else or am I just unlucky?
---
If you're talking about Bamboozle, it literally says on the perk that it *doesn't* affect pallets.
---
Just watched it last night  
---
Loved it, knew I had to make a meme haha
---
I don't like to farm, but I would have farmed here. This is a ridiculous amount of bp you could have earned... Still, I hate DC even more so I would have begrudgingly finished the game with you.
---
I think what OP means, is that it should have been an easy hit for the killer (down a narrow hallway), but they somehow managed to not get hit
---
great
---
Gens go fast at that point. Try this build. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AIgnGyBvEuI
---
Not when their arms have to be like stretch Armstrong to reach the player through the window two or three feet away from the window. yes, they can hit you if you are close to the window but when you get downed and are already 2 to 3 feet from that vault there is an issue. It's almost like huntress hatchets where they can sometimes curve harder than Tokyo drift to hit a player or go through solid objects. I once watched the survivor I was body blocking for going to the gate get downed as the hatchet not only went through a wall it had to curve as well to hit them.
---
Dear god that‚Äôs ugly XD
---
Clown is my best.
---
Huntress is my favorite design.
---
Plague is the most interesting power.
---
Michael is my favorite licensed.
---
Nurse is the most boring.
---
Spirit is most fun.
---
Honorable mentions: pig has favorite weapon. Doctor made me buy the game. Hags breathing makes me the most uncomfortable. Wraith is the cutest in the innocence department. Trapper is the most iconic.
---
Again and this is very important. This is MY opinion. I really need some of ya'll to read this.
---
Wow, ok. Just wow. That‚Äôs really agonisingly strong üòÖ seems cleansing the totem is gonna be a top priority then
---
It is possible to mimick that by turning the sensitivity way up on console, I think you can deactivate the auto lock function console has as well but I'm not too sure on that, however if you have a very high sensitivity you already have a lot of power over the game as most killers (like myself) leave it at default
---
Not really the mouse sensitivity is higher then a controllers sensitivity, you can‚Äôt mimic a mouse sensitivity in the slightest.
---
Good luck man
---
In my experience I could hear the hatch just as clearly when cloaked.
---
It usually is just the map can sometimes be really good at hiding the hex totem, but sometimes it‚Äôs obvious so it‚Äôs really random
---
Can you imagine people playing Call of Duty and saying people are toxic for not going easy on them?
---
Thats what these "killer tryharding" comments feels like.
---
So what if i slug for my 4K, im not here to make sure you have fun, like playing COD, i don't let myself die just so you feel happy about getting a kill. If i could i would never die and get all the kills.
---
Dude, they hired a 16 year old to code the game, and in case you want to know who specifically - Sujan, he told me himself that they've hired him when he was 16 and he was a programmer for dead by daylight ever since
---
You should get tekken 7, its the only game that actually gets me to play games
---
Actually feels way more balanced now.  Was ridiculous where you could not spot him no matter what before..
---
standing right next to him touching him and he's not getting spotted...
---
Fair. Sometimes I roam the whole map and see only 2-4 But I heard there‚Äôs up to 5?
---
I had the him on the center of my camera for at least 5 seconds
---
That is a pretty rude ticket
---
Woah guys don't down vote 
---
Jesus he just said poor killer for not getting a 4k
---
Yeah there‚Äôs a total of five totems
---
Honestly, the best way to learn is to just be tossed to the wolves.
---
And I second what MiniKiWI said. Play killer a few rounds just to understand how things look and feel from their perspective. It honestly opens your eyes to a lot of new possibilities.
---
In the trash
---
I know what a buff/nerf is.  I know what a bug fix is.  The fact is he is now weaker as a result of the hotfix, when he was never even as good as hillbilly who is widely regarded as the most balanced killer in terms of counterplay and ability to kill high ranks and even swf.  He shouldn‚Äôt be nerfed at ALL when he isn‚Äôt at least equivalent to billy in power.
---
Oh yeah because his "theme" was really working out for him. There's a reason he needed a complete rework.
---
I HAD ALREADY GOTTEN THE SAFE RESCUE
---
Yeah bro its delicious for ruin or when you have to urinate mid game
---
Thanks for the info. Obviously I‚Äôm new lol. I hope to not suck forever at this game
---
OOF
---
Overall for me, The Doctor. His cosmetics imo are great. His passive madness and the survivors screaming is really well done as well as his ability to shock survivors and render them unable to perform actions. His lore is cool. Also his name is freakin HERMAN.
---
Oh, okay then.
---
THE BIGGEST OOF
---
Ha no problem, enjoy being new, it only gets more frustrating the more you understand üòÇ
---
Good survivors say it's survivor sided.
---
FTFY.
---
Wait, so the killers dont make sounds when getting pallet stunned????????
---
Actually now it does, they even banned Ochido a while ago.
---
I would but the mm is not letting me connect with people.
---
PS4 Europe Store
---
Will the cake still be usable after the event?
---
Oh you have favorites from all killers I like that
---
Claudettr looks baked
---
So... what do you want, a medal?
---
MAYBE IF THEY MADE BORROWED TIME BASE KIT, WE WOULDNT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THAT LEVEL OF CANCER. DONT YOU DARE TRY TO BITCH THAT ITS OP KILLER MAINS. IF YOU DONT TUNNEL BORROWED TIME DOES NOTHING.
---
This is anecdotal but I‚Äôve gotta him up to second prestige running ruin, bbq, overcharge and surveillance focusing primarily on area control and sneak attacks, it‚Äôs some of the most fun I‚Äôve ever had as a killer main.
---
*oh shit oh no, ace get the hell out of there!*
---
I think this is alittle much, I love Amanda but she just needs some minor tweaks not a huge overhauled buff
---
An Another legend
---
It was doc with 1 cake and no farm with bbq
---
Facts
---
Incase you‚Äôre actually curious it‚Äôs megs Sport Bob (something like that)
---
If you're trying to extra hard, make the thread in the button eyes into the shape of a 'Z' 
---
Great job on this btw looks awesome
---
It looks way different than the one in the game though?
---
Gens feel like they go too fast as killer because you are preoccupied doing other things.
---
Gens feel like they take forever as survivor, especially if there is ruin and you don't have prove thyself with another person, because you are just sitting there holding M1 and occasionally hitting space bar.
---
It is all about how your brain perceives your current activity and how you are engaged with it.
---
Lemme just get downvoted to oblivion. 
---
It‚Äôs fun but it‚Äôs absolutely one of the most buggy games I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôve played it since launch and I‚Äôm absolutely not a rager. I‚Äôm a very casual gamer. It‚Äôs a fun concept but it‚Äôs so soooo broken to the extent that it was better AT LAUNCH (after the servers were actually working).
---
I‚Äôm aware, consistency isn‚Äôt a vocabulary word for BHVR
---
Doctor he makes me laugh, playing as him and against him. Nothing funnier than a survivor screaming while you're healing them.
---
if you just go for it as you see someone coming to save you youll eventually get lucky enough times to get it with smaller risk of going into 2nd phase
---
Yeah, not too many good skins for my main, Huntress. I love her though, she's such a fun killer to play once you get past the learning curve.
---
I rarely do it then.
---
I use bond and will run by teammates to hopefully confuse or make the killer chase another person. Nothing wrong with that. I also don't run perks like Dead hard or adrenaline so its nice to have a diversion.
---
 Ironically I also play Feng lol. Was going to ask what the name of the Feng was because I faced a Hag earlier lol. But I don't dc so it wasn't me.
---
Ok so NOED is the reward for the killer playing well and applying pressure, and your penalty for not being able to do totems.
---
I don't understand your complaint. You weren't able to do something because the killer prevented you from doing it. You therefore didn't play optimally. And there are consequences.
---
It just happened to be the time I did it that I got the trophy, but I rarely do it then. Usually I try every time I‚Äôm hooked and rarely fail.
---
Overall for me, it will always be Spirit. She's the one I have the most fun playing and is the only killer I can play more than a couple games in a row with. I also just really like her animation when she Mori's someone and love the hatch closing animation.
---
Period.
---
Doctor: "Go babozala-, bambazal-, bam-, bom-, uh... FOOL 'EM!"
---
Billy has to deal with loops. 
---
Spirit doesn‚Äôt really know what those are.
---
I love his laugh when he gets hit with a pallet
---
Why does Meg always look like she just licked a dogs ass?
---
More balanced for sure. But not *balanced* since one side has a very clear advantage over the other. 
---
(survivors &gt; killers)
---
It‚Äôs definitely better than anything I could draw
---
Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.
---
How can 1 rank 14 pull in a rank 14 killer when everyone else is a red rank you'd pull purple or mYb green or even red..
---
Is that the model of a sacrificed survivor?
---
Imagine that everytime you blink there is an fps drop.
---
Yeah very much agreed god eww
---
How can you abuse ooo.. yall kill me..
---
What do you mean by camping? Camping a hooked survivor or camping a gen?
---
Yeah I love the paladin stance when closing, it's badass. I like her style too, always been a fan of Asian culture and she's done pretty well.
---
Completely agree. His concept is so awesome, but the execution is just...meh.
---
That would suck it's happened before but it's rare for me
---
‚ÄúYou got games on your phone?‚Äù
---
Kill rushing? Pretty sure no one has ever said that to me or to anyone about this game.
---
Besides, if a killer gets kills quickly, it means the survivors were bad since they shouldn't be getting caught all at once immediately. The game starts the two sides away from each other. So if the killer finds you, then you got unlucky because they found you first, or you ran towards them.
---
Id welcome something to change the play style (survivor main) and add another challenge as a survivor. I‚Äôve discussed in length with a friend about the idea of a power box/s that are designed for only one person to work on at a time (that randomly spawn anywhere on the map) . Only one person can do them at a time but they‚Äôre a little faster than Gens, maybe 60secs to complete, but like two boxes = one gen. They‚Äôre always placed in obvious places and are high risk re visibility and how many need to be done. You could do them in conjunction with gens, 4 gens and two boxes.  Alternatively make survivors have to find petrol cans before doing a gen...
---
I just don't like their power. Its just so boring to me. I do like how they have different genders available to pick from, their weapon is cool and I always like killers with a mask.
---
Yes.
---
Haha true. I do get the occasional comment about how since I'm half Asian, it only makes sense I like to play the Asian killer... which really has nothing to do with why I main her at all lol.
---
After thinking about it a bit more though I do also really like the Huntresses and Legions lore.
---
It was constant for me. I kinda got the hang of her at one point, but then she just got boring you know? So I don't play her anymore.
---
Hey bro lookin for some advice with Myers, strategies and perks, would you care to share? I‚Äôm a rank 9. Most matches are rage inducing
---
Omg that is so awesome
---
I do too, Susie is my legion favorite, her style is very cute and it's just funny being a cutie but a psycho
---
I am a simple person.
---
I see cool post i upvote.
---
I see Karma whoring title i downvote.
---
It's because survivors also get the party starters. Killers only get the gateau
---
You are probably right. Still though, I would like survivors to get a few more since I just want to see them being used in more matches.
---
Outbaited, outskilled LuL
---
To show what it looks like.
---
This has happened too many times to me for it to not be patched yet. If it was killers getting glitched outside the playable map as often as it happens to survivors it would have been patched already. Wake Up took one week yet we still can't mend or heal then this all in the same glitch.
---
She‚Äôs been hitting the gym, you disrespectful fuck.
---
I was talking about the name license
---
His is the most terrifying to me.
---
You wouldn't know, since it would be invisible.

This is why I run an end game build:

---
-Spine Chill
---
-Resilience
---
-Adrenaline
---
Youtube 3 gen strategy videos and add pressure. Especially works with Doc
---
Lol nice
---
No the red flashing thing is gone cause that was a silly addition that was not well received.
---
Once I also got fucked by hallucination.
---
I was healing near pallet while doc was around, I heard the hear beat, but thought he was chasing someone else, as I run bond, and see another survivor running around. Hallucination appears and it blocked my view and from behind the hallucination real doc just smacks me.
---
This is like a one in a million chance, this is incredible
---
Huntress seems pretty broken right now since I for one don't have directional humming sound anymore, and it is pretty important to balance out the low terror radius and ranged attack....
---
Huntress only 1/3 for fun? U must not land ur hits then ;)
---
The do it everytime kn the T-walls.
---
"Another one"
---
STOP GIVING ME YAMAOKA'S ESTATE WHEN I'M PLAYING KILLER NOONE LIKES PLAYING KILLER ON THAT MAP IN FACT JUST STOP GIVING ME WHAT MAP IN GENERAL BECAUSE IT GODDAMN SUCKS
---
Since dbd has been on game pass I've gotten people that have farmed me, people who get downed because they stood still, people doing a marathon around the map and when they do touch a gen its blows up.I've resorted to playing swf with my friend who's rank 8 to get competent players
---
Doing gens, you?
---
The survivors heads turn when their camera runs now. They have to be looking at him directly to get him out.
---
Catch!
---
Huntress is the only one who actually sounds pissed when stunned.
---
This scares me
---
Used to have a similar issue with Killer when I first started. It didn't really end till I found a killer I really enjoyed playing. Then I just fed the one I enjoyed with a ton of BP so I wouldn't be completely steam rolled, and the fun began. Sadly, killers are very add-on focused, so once you get started with getting good add-ons, it's a world of possibilities.
---
Why the hell did they not change Ghostface's stalking mode?
---
Right now, he can stalk a survivor aggressively out in the open as he looping/chasing you. All he has to do is to break line of sight with the survivor briefly, before such survivor can reveal him, then get back to stalking until the survivor is marked.
---
Whilst a survivor cannot reveal ghostface, because reveal timer gets reset each time ghostface is out of line of sight.
---
This is unfair, and it gives ghostface a guaranteed exposed status on a survivor.
---
DELIVERANCE SHOULD PREVENT THE ENTITY FROM MAKING YOU MASH SPACEBAR IN SECOND STAGE AND ALLOW YOU TO ATTEMPT AA KOBE IN BOTH STAGES
---
Spine chill. Also watch YouTube videos of him so you see not only how his powers work firsthand you will also see how other survivors are avoiding him or what they do to get away.
---
Nice one! It wasn't perfect but if it works, it works!
---
I used to run aftercare for the same reason until my teammates started using it against me. Brothers in arms
---
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty much how it goes, got two p3 Claud‚Äôs in a match when I was playing survivor and they both acted like potatoes
---

the fact that you run  premonition and spine chill together triggers me

First time trying Meg means I don‚Äôt got spine chill for her yet.
---
Also, if fucking everyone INSISTS on being Ghost face, I‚Äôll just run straight into them and LET them hook me so I can find a match that ISNT GHOST FACE. GOD WHY ARE THERE SO MANY GHOST FACES? I get it he‚Äôs new but holy fuck this is beyond ‚Äúhe‚Äôs new I wanna try‚Äù levels of ghost face players!

Or just run the ‚Äúevery billy‚Äù build. Spirit fury enduring ruin and bbq. Every red rank billy uses it. Cheers

I'm a terrible xbox survivor and a terrible xbox killer!  All thanks to the gamepass lol.  
---
I've never dcd though and Ive laid some serious eggs as a killer.  Tried out the nurse a couple times ... whoa boy did that not go well.  And of course I had a merciless swf crew.
---
Billy?  Top tier?  Dude I just run around the map using the chainsaw like the road runner on crack.  I had a daily for Billy to hit three people with my chainsaw.   Ha!  That's never gonna happen.
---
I thought it's not but Peanits on the forum said it is, which I thought was surprising because I thought it was fine as long as you're not using a bot or hit macro to automate making lobbies, reading up, and attacking.

I only saw David taking Dwight on doggystyle. Nothing else matters.

He has to stare at you for a few seconds so he can down you in one shot. Watch some youtube videos on him if you really wanna learn about your enemy. The Art of War is a wonderful read.
---
Pepehands.

He might as well join Harambe and Etika and Stephen Hawking and whoever else that is great in heaven(until he gets unbanned)
---
let me hide behind pallet and lose distance just to fuck my teammates over if i downed gg easybabbykiller
---
THAT SHOULD BE A DEFAULT CHANGE ANYWAY. I PROBS HAVE GOD DAMN CARPAL TUNNEL FROM MASHING MY CONTROLLER
---
That change in tone towards the end is hilarious.
---
\*looks at Mettle of Men\*
---
&gt; The difference is two people get healed in 32 seconds, not one. 
---
...And the difference is with Self-Care, in order to heal two people only two people need to be occupied, whereas without Self-Care every single survivor needs to be participating in healing to heal two people simultaneously.  So you can't say "using self-care wastes time that could be spent doing gens!!!" when without Self-Care, you're pulling someone off an objective in order to heal you in what amounts to the same overall time spent healing.  Using your teammate to heal you is wasting 16 seconds of your time being healed and 16 seconds of the time of the guy healing you, whereas with Self-Care you're wasting 32 seconds of just your time.  The same amount of potential time spent on objectives is still being lost.  
---
Sure, sometimes it might be bad to take longer with Self-Care cause the killer could find you before you're done, but sometimes it might take you too long to find another survivor or something could happen to make them to take longer to heal you, making the time you're injured end up being longer than if you had just Self-Cared.  Also if you rely on your teammates for healing, you're potentially letting the killer find two survivors together.  And relying on your teammates for healing becomes less effective as others start to die.  
---
So sometimes Self-Care can be detrimental, and sometimes relying on your team for healing instead of Self-Caring is detrimental.  But I'd say the potential pros of it far outweigh the potential cons of it, and calling it "the worst perk in the game" or even bad is just stupid.
---
You not making it that far Killers will quit
---
Yikes that was close
---
I'M REALLY SORRY MY DUDE, I REALLY ENJOY PLAYING GAMES WITH SOME FRIENDS, USUALLY ONLY 1 OR 2 BUT I ADMIT WE DO PLAY SWF ON DBD AND IT'S NOT TO BE TOXIC, JUST TO HAVE A BIT OF FUN... ALTHOUGH WE ARE RESPECTFUL AND DON'T TEABAG OR FLASHLIGHT... SO I'M REALLY SORRY IF YOU EVER CAME UP AGAINST ME AND I HOPE YOU GET SOME EASY SOLOQ GAMES
---
THIS RANKING SYSTEM IS SO FUCKING DISGUSTINGLY UNBALANCED. 
---
WHY EVEN LIE TO ME JUST TELL ME THAT IM GOING TO BE FUCKED ROYALLY AS I QUEUE FOR A GAME BECAUSE THESE SWEATY PLAYERS WANT TO JUST GET THEIR DISGUSTING FAT ROLLS ALL UP ON MY FACE.
---
Next year
---
Lol. I honestly wish you could sell teachables that you don't want or something
---
not very sharp
---
Fuck
---
No matter what the perks are, I think this is hilarious. Especially the self care baby, give em a lil smooch.
---
LMFAO OH SHIT
---
Yeah thats a good point. I just dont like the "juggle" mindset.
---
Exactly. I feel like it's an excuse for simply not being good at the game. On other game's subreddits people are able to laugh at themselves and say they suck. You'll rarely see that here; there's always an excuse and it's because the other side were meanies for having the audacity to win.
---

Mid chapter I believe. Maybe midchapter after 13
---
But he is good for begginers so 50/50
---
There is something wrong with that lol. Especially if your teammates are on a gen. Only scenario i see that being acceptable is if one of your teammates is hiding/not doing anything all game.
---
I thought it's THIS midchapter or whatever. Like in a month or so.
---
I feel so attacked rn.
---
I still haven‚Äôt unlocked No Mither.  Never gonna unless it gets a MASSIVE overhaul.
---
It‚Äôs funny you say that. 
---
I‚Äôm a no-shame Huntress fan through and through and I love her concept and design... but I am absolutely dreadful at playing her. I admit I haven‚Äôt given her as much patience as other killers and being on console as well has really intimidated me from pushing through with her. So yeah, for me at my skill level, she‚Äôs a 1/3 but I still love her and want to be at a 3/3 with her... someday. XD
---
Yea but they will most likely still opt to giving the killer the edge in the situation where the hit connects on their screen, and while dedicated servers will make the connection much more stabile, it will increase the overall latency so my guess is that these phantom hitboxes will propably stay about the same
---
He was already injured. He knew where freddy was and it didnt seem like he had many options. I dont see why people suggest to look behind yourself constantly when there isnt anything you can do about it. Atleast that's how I feel. If i dont see any pallets around then i just dont see how I'm getting away unless i get lucky.
---
Yeah, and that perk got a big rekt ...
---
are you being /s?
---
I THINK YOUR OVERREACTING. THE CAMERA SHAKE WASN'T THAT BAD.
---
Don't mention it. To be honest, I'm surprised there's not a glossary of commonly used terms in the wikis of games like this
---
Track the Predator: when this perk is equipped if the survivor holds their crouch button down for 5 seconds or longer they will go into tracking mode where they will be able to see the killers footprints highlighted in red 5/10/15 seconds after they have left them and any break actions within 10/20/30 meters from you will be shown but while in tracking mode your move speed is decreased by a further 50% from the normal crouch speed
---
Little idea I just came up with interested in what others think
---
On legion I'll have to disagree, Susie is best personality, very studious and shy, cute but psycho. Frank was a manipulative dick but that's good because he is the primary killer and influencer of the legion, so it fits.
---
That was the one were each killer was paired off with each other, right? I loved that piece! While I was drawing this I remember it and honestly Wraith and Nurse would totally waltz in their spare time! I love the dancing idea for each character haha!
---
üëÄ
---
What doesn‚Äôt make sense doc gets the most points plus bbq and anniversary cake
---
Watch us it‚Äôs incredible. And regarding the perks, how would see you soon work? How many times can she be hooked? It‚Äôs not very clear
---
Only reason I don‚Äôt see it for Susie is because she was hesitant to kill, and I guess she got over it eventually, but it‚Äôs just kinda bland for a killer to me personally‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know I guess I like asshole killers lol.
---
Thx, I was so happy.
---
FURRY IN A HURRY!!! Love that guy!
---
I‚Äôm a good 2/3 for her. I love those hatchets to hell
---
apparently his best body was cheating on him with his wife, no one know what happened to him after it is really strange.
---
Not to play against
---
oof
---
Cosmetically speaking yes legion is pretty basic, not gonna lie or defend against that. However it's a bit more realistic outfit for a killer to wear. And in real life if someone was hopping walls and jumping fences just to stab me I'd be pretty terrified. The ability in my opinion captures true bloodlust, damn near feral, hence it's name.
---
Wooo! I'd do it too.  Lets everyone know you are spending it all on dbd cosmetics so quit asking for handouts because you are already broke.
---
Also shows you are prepared for killer selfies.
---
Changed it so that there arent any tremendous challenging skillchecks
---
He‚Äôs not really that good at any of those at base, though. His stall game is horrendously terrible, as all of his perks don‚Äôt slow the game down; they speed him up or work at the very tail end of a game and that‚Äôs if you get lucky.
---
His stealth isn‚Äôt particularly great either, it feels bad to go against and feels bad to use because what if you can‚Äôt find anyone?
---
Solo survivor. I gotta admit swf opens the door to have advantages over solo survivors, but its just more fun to play with friends and not total idiots. I became pretty much a killer main just because of that reason. While Killer, the only reason you lose is because *you* made a mistake and not the mate that decided to let you die on first hook. Also with every other killer you play, there is a different playstyle and other use of power while survivors are just skins. I only do solo survivor bc if dailys and daily xp.
---
Fact. Was against a Billy today, and I was actually very decent. Managed to loop him so my mates could get some gens done. I also unhooked all 3 of them at diferent times because, well, all 3 of them never went to save anybody. I ended up getting hooked, nobody came for me. I died and the rest followed soon after. 0/10 would not save again.
---
He's not very good. He's an m1 killer that on occasion  gets a slightly better m1.
---
Lol that makes sense. Perhaps Susie never got over it and the killer feeds on her despair of causing others pain. Perhaps she did get over it and enjoys it now. Who knows lol
---
Dare I ask what software gore is.
---
I love it
---
I have all perks on all survivors besides Thickness lol. I really hate myself for it
---
He can lean on walls? Is that how he could see me when I was in that building? (I got ‚Äúexposed‚Äù before he suddenly appeared)
---
That's why I use Nancy's Masterpiece and the Green Dress (yellow dress/uncommon add-on). I never have to chase after people just to sleep them again; the range on NM is insane. Plus, the dreamworld power reticle will snap onto anyone who's in front of it, regardless if Freddy actually sees them or not.
---
The next time you are hooked you are dead. It just makes it so that you essentially ‚Äúsave yourself‚Äù from the struggle phase and spawn somewhere else on the map.
---
Explain ill take it as feedback
---
I'm rank 4-5 survivor and I LOVE hope...the problem is it's basically useless unless it's tier 3 and I don't often make it to the end of the game to use it. (Don't ask me how I managed to solo queue to 4 and stay there. It's an enigma I can't solve dude because I'm actual trash.)
---
IM PRETTY FUCKING NEW TO THIS GAME SO MAY BE WRONG. BUT I THINK ITS WHEN YOU LURE KILLER TO SOMEONE ON A GEN. MIGHT BE WRONG THO
---
Does mori cancel if you have adrenaline? Had no idea
---
It's their horrible spaghetti code. From what I've read on other posts DBD is a coding nightmare. It almost needs to be rebuilt from the ground up to fix a lot of issues like sound always breaking. This game also has horrible technical polish. Half tbe things in the game feel unfinished, underwhelming, or buggy. Which is unusual for a popular game that's been out for years.
---
Ohhh ok thats quite good then. Makes sense
---
Events seem to make the toxic players come out of the wood work. Also with a new character DLC coming out as well you are likely seeing even more returning players. I'm sorry to hear that you are not having fun with the game.
---
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone in its current state. If you play killer you're literally sitting in lobbies for like 15 minutes these days. I'd rather recommend them a game they CAN PLAY CONSISTENTLY.
---
I mean that's what he is just Myers but worse. The only way to get a stalk off is if you get unaware survivors or you're above them, you can crouch to deny getting spotted if you're near cover but besides that you can't stop someone spotting you
---
Fingers
---
Def. Ghostface. He is much more fun to play while Plague is literally M1 Simulator against good survivors. They dont cleanse so you literally have to m1 the entire game while you can actually use your power with Ghostface.
---
Yeah it's basically still in alpha because of coding problems huh?
---
It is when software messes up and makes weird says weird things its hard to explain but go to r/softwaregore and youll find out
---
OK, I DO FUCKING THANK YOU FOR A NICE FUCKING EXPLANATION DEAR FRIEND HAVE A NICE FUCKING DAY
---
Perkwise Plague only has corrupt intervention, which is decent. Ghostface's perks are all just meh. Just wait for it on the shrine and you good
---
\*Happy zappy sounds :3
---
Well the trapping on the gen to where they cant leave it until it's done might still be a little problematic.
---
I've never had so much anxiety lmao.
---
Never before have I put so many hours into a video game that I kind of hate.  I don't know how it's fun and awful at the same time.
---
My biggest regret was prestiging survivors that i never play now
---
Only thing I see that could be a issue is the climbing other wise I deeply want this
---
PI is low teir compared to adrenaline was my point
---
If a killer feels like utter shit to play without the add ons then they need a rework.
---
Nah, I just meant it in the context that the bois will escape haha
---
I'M NOT OVERREACTING, NOT EVERYONE HAS THE SAME VISION AS YOU. SOME PEOPLE GET MOTION SICK OVER IT AS WELL. ARE THEY OVER REACTING? NO. AS I SAID, A SMALL CAMERA SHAKE, FINE. WHAT THEY HAD IMPLEMENTED WAS WAY TOO MUCH AND CAUSED ISSUES FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. DON'T BE A CHUCKLEHEAD JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM.
---
Most killers are add-on dependent, though....
---
Depends entirely who‚Äôs playing her. I know an absolutely nutty Huntress that‚Äôs red ranked and *loves* Coldwind maps. To be fair the ones that are red ranked really know their stuff.
---
I‚Äôm surprised you fell for it since he didn‚Äôt have the red stain. He was probably wondering why you just stood there.
---
No it doesn't haha, I just meant in the sense that your friends will escape.  
---
Adrenaline would be even more ridiculous if it did
---
She should be able to throw the cat at the killer to stun them like in the movie.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if there were team comms to let them know what‚Äôs going on. Instead you see angrypug 3-4K quite a bit then talk shit. It‚Äôs gross AF
---
To be beasts with 4ks consistently maybe. Most killers I play I can run with zero add ons and still do relatively well. Like not dropping rank at all well.
---
Im not an expert in anti hack programs. But im pretty sure a false ban due to edited save files is pretty rare.
---
But then again, im not an expert.
---
If so, he should contact Support
---
how can you be sure he didn't do something to the file?
---
People will find any reason to complain about something. That being said his re-work is coming soon so learning counter plays to his current powers is kind of pointless. Best strategy though is get good at failing skill checks when you are asleep
---
BUDDY! ARE YOU THERE??
---
Meg is my bestgirl :(
---
popular opinion: youre trash
---
Why?
---
Not really? I‚Äôve had games recently on both sides but with his notification as to where the person is it‚Äôs still useful even if you‚Äôre broken out of it
---
It's because the role of killer is more skill based and generally more rivettinfg than survivor gameplay. First off, survivors are just skins once you unlock their teachables. Secondly, the majority of what survivng does consists of hitting a space bar on a gen. The chase is what makes ir fun for survivors, but they aren't really difficult when you recognise what tiles are where. On top of all this the killer also earns soooo many blood points. One game of killers can easily be equal to playing 2-3 games as a survivor. As a killer you also only rely on yourself, team mates are 70 percent of the battle for survivors. It sucks because I really want some intense red rank games but all I get is an hour que time.
---
Broke ass game.
---
He did. They almost instantly responded to him saying the judgement was final.
---
Yeah pretty much
---
A moment of silence for the poor slug that slowed the timer down just a lil bit.
---
Still don't see any reason why you had to post this. I've always been insecure about my art and I truly didn't think it was great. This was kind of rude.
---
The devs really need to take care of shit like this.
---
Lmao, saving this
---
I like the idea of Hex Darkness, but its basically a better Third Seal
---
Yeah thats because a false ban due to save file editing is pretty damn rare.
---
Either a virus changed something or he did.
---
Level 2 for reference
---
I love seeing ASCII art made for desktop browsers when I'm looking at mobile
---
I mean, I obviously can't be 100% sure, but he has no reason to lie to me, and I know him fairly well.
---
Yay!
---
Ive had that happen to me and all 4 called me camper..like bruh wtf
---
no, but just like everything else in the game you have to understand how it works. look up a yotube video on it
---
gg ez baby killer
---
What you just said is wrong on so many levels, first off people play survivor because it‚Äôs more relaxing than killer.  Bloodpoints have hardly anything to do with it.  Camping is a terrible strategy and easily countered by gen rushing, the only time it‚Äôs effective is when survivors are overly altruistic.  The reason lobbies are long is because of something the devs did.
---
Honestly if they released a remaster of this game with some smoother graphics, and removed horrible hitboxes and the such. Itd be an easy ten bucks from me lol. And it'd feel like an actual game
---
Gen rush isn‚Äôt just playing the game it‚Äôs getting them all to seconds before they‚Äôre finished then finishing them all at once ‚ÄúRushing‚Äù the game along compared to a normal game where if they‚Äôre all worked on at just the pace they‚Äôre found it tends to take longer
---
Yeah I just hop on for a couple rounds and then move onto something else. Also, while waiting for a Killer queue, which takes fucking ages every time, I can get through a couple youtube videos
---
That's a tall order... I definitely want to try though
---
Clown is just. I probally just fucking main him because of his design. He is fat (which no other killer is) , collects fingers, can pull off cool tricks with his blade, coughs like a pirate, his backstory is deep and he has fucking porn as an add on. Comeone, this is as good as it can get.
---
Playing as a killer is way more frustrating and stressful than survivor.
---
Hag mori is just the best tho, i like how brutal it is
---
Some streamer chick and her band of toxic buddies played survivor against me today. She was rank 4 and the rest were 10. Well I killed 3 of them and she DC's right before I hook her.
---
Isn't it possible that there was a desync between his save file and his server profile? Like I said, I'm a casual, but he has no reason to lie to me.
---
When i go vs an insidious bub it always cracks me up, like "Ok, imma rescue this mofo in the basement and run like hell *hears chainsaw*, Aaaah fuck". Then i proceed to hang on the hook and laugh as every survivor that goes to save gets destroyed, its funny.
---
Solo survivor at lower ranks
---
Yeah those perks do the exact same job, why are you running both?
---
All great reasons tbh
---
Thats kind of what i was hoping for. When i first started it was a bunch of fun then the events started happening and it became a burden to play. So hopefully it'll even out in a few weeks and it'll be more fun! I love the game but I hated getting smacked immediately as a rank 18 when i didnt even make any mistakes.
---
IT MEANS BLOCKING THE PATH OF A SURVIVOR AS THEY ARE TRYING TO ESCAPE THE KILLER.
---
LMFAO
---
That's it. You lost that stare down lol. You lose every one you don't try to beat him at.
---
i WISH haha
---
Yeah I'd probably buy it too. It'd need non player hosted servers from the start and it'd need actual ranks
---
rekt that slugging garbage
---
The heartbreak.
---
This kids is how fanfic gets made
---
He is basically a m1 killer, but he has to wait 7 seconds to actually be able to hit you
---
Damn, that sucks. Thankfully I haven't prestiged anyone, killer or survivor. I don't think I ever will until I run out of things to do (or the benefits become way better)
---
Yea you're right, I honestly didn't put too much thought into it.
---
I just imagined the Beldam, with no terror radius, climbing through the windows of the upper floor in Badham or Haddonfield or the Crotus Penn Asylum and figured it was too cool not to include haha
---
One big problem against other killers is not finding where to loop them, against freddie you have 7 seconds to find a pallet or vault
---
Also i like the idea that multiple killers are one. Thats one cool thing about Legion. Clown just seems like he has the most detail to his character and feels high quality.
---
Think it was lag that made me hit the wall and not let me vault right away.
---
I 100% agree with that move
---
Thnx
---
I feel like it would be a good counter to mori because we have no counter except not going down and that's not really a thing in most matches
---
If im be honest he must have messed with the files.
---
I was scared that blood warden was gonna activate
---
This is me with killers üò© (well all the killers that I actually have bought)
---
I've been playing solo survivor for three weeks straight now. I don't want to live. It's that horrible. Not that it matters but I haven't hit rank 1 because of it.
---
I love this idea a lot hopefully one day they‚Äôd be able to implement it.
---
OK THANK YOU
---
Template pls? :}

---
This would fit more the identity v game
---
My biggest mistake has to be spreading out my bloodpoints instead of just leveling one up then move on to the next that and getting a bunch of useless teachables
---
In the film she could never shape shift. Calling her the tethered makes more sense if u wanted this idea, instead a tethered version of your character could replace urself, as at no point was shape shifting a thing. So Instead she could be replaced with the tethered/ mirrored survived, as  the tethered is also plural ( like the legion) so it‚Äôs like she swaps out for the character. Then any other features implemented, shapeshifting was never a thing
---
This happens to me too much
---
A lot of players forget that he can see you if you are out of his terror radius. If you lose him in a chase your first priority should be to wake yourself off.
---
PLEASE READ MY NEW COMMENT THE CONCEPT NEEDS ADJUSTING! :( :)
---
Idk man I've had lots of times where I do some simple shit like literally stand still behind a wall and people walk right into me. So.
---
this going to be my trap card ill use it on whoever bully me! fight me bitch
---
Wtf is going on? I‚Äôm making a build and giving it a name based on a popular stereotype and now I‚Äôm compared to a Jew hater
---
Solo survivor if we‚Äôre talking low ranks.
---
High rank isnt that bad but low rank is insane. You can loop the killer for what should be 4-5 gens but at most only 2 will be done in that time.
---
expose me :shy:
---
She is in the entities realm. She gains new powers, one of which allowing herself to take the form of the others to be like them. I don‚Äôt want to call her ‚ÄúThe Tethered‚Äù since her goal is to untether herself.
---
And your pissing me off now. How do you not understand?
---
i love you, i really do, just yesterday was asking for amazing offerings
---
I mean at the very least you can get some BP for it if it goes into the shrine. So I guess it's kinda useful?
---
I would imagine the Mother starting in her human-form, slowly evolving into her spider-like form becoming stronger and faster. Similar to the monster in Evolve she starts out weak and grows stronger and more dangerous over time
---
Was that from the user NINOOOOOO?
---
Solo survivor is complete ass. Everyone wants to be saved and healed but the second you get hooked they won't hesitate to leave you there. Once I was using Kindered and they used the aura ability to tag team a gen instead of saving me when the killer was no where near me. I've even used insta heals on a rando and they still leave me to die on first hook. If my friends aren't on I'd rather kill than survive alone.
---
I LITERALLY GOT CALLED "OVER ALTRUISTIC BOT" BY A SALTY JANE FOR "DIVING @ HOOKS" LIKE ... SORRY FOR SAVING YOUR ASS?! THEY COMPLAIN WHEN THEY DON'T GET SAVED AND THEY COMPLAIN WHEN THEY DO ... MIND YOU, SHE DIDN'T EVEN GET FARMED EITHER. AND REFUSED TO GET HEALED. AND THEN REFUSED TO TAKE THE HATCH AT THE END WHEN THE KILLER WANTED TO GIVE IT TO HER. SHE WAS JUST LAYING THERE LIKE SALTY SALMON. FUCK THIS COMMUNITY.
---
the best is watching them with empathy when they're hit by a hatchet. take one to the shoulder, and suddenly you're doing some Tony Hawk shit from a standing position.
---
They should add a red stain to the illusions so stuff like this would be a little more possible, galaxy brain mind game
---
Same here!
---
Any swf with me in my survivors games will just farm each other off hook, heal on top of blown up gens and randomly drop pallets if the killer even comes in the same tile as them. When I play killer they have the coordination of a pro CS:GO team. Each one is on a different gen and they all loop perfectly. Half the hooks on the map are broken and 57 and 1/2 pallets spawn in the worst spot for the killer. Not to mention the insanely perfect switch out they pull as soon as you land a hit while the other 2 run up and heal the one you hit. And they all bring crutch perks with insta heals or brand new parts. It's so fun. Do I sound bitter?
---
S H I T P O S T
---
Welp that was my best guess lol
---
except lag compensation exists
---
I have no idea what happened here lol
---
Lmao
---
Right before clown released is when I got the game, if I remember there was something special about his chapter, idk if cosmetics went live with him or if something else happened. But I could just be totally off and he was just another chapter. So if he was a special chapter it would make sense why he's high quality
---
WHEN THE FUCK ARE DEDICATED SERVERS COMING OUT?
---
I'M GETTING REAL TIRED OF KILLERS WITH DIAL-UP INTERNET WHERE YOU GET TELEPORTED BACKWARDS 8FT+ EVERY 5 SECONDS.
---
I JUST HAD A DAMN GAME WHERE I WENT TO HIDE FROM THE KILLER BEHIND A BIG BLOCK AND THE KILLER JUST WENT STRAIGHT TO ME AS THOUGH HE COULD SEE ME.  APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO THE GAME I WAS ON *THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BLOCK*, IN PLAIN VIEW OF THE KILLER, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT TELEPORTED ME SHORTLY BEFORE THE KILLER HIT ME.
---
I feel you, with the new matchmaking system, I have to wait a minimum of 10 minutes before I get placed in a lobby.
---
I've just been hiding in places that I wouldn't look if I were a survivor and it tends to work really well. Try stalking in areas where you can break their line of sight so that you don't get revealed but can still expose them by peaking. Stalking while leaning also makes you expose them faster and it is a lot harder to get revealed.

---
The legion double blade was less than a month to fix, the legion itself that take longer.
---
It's very tricky to use.. stupid perk imo
---
Mom said its my turn to cleanse totem
---
Only time I DC is when my totem gets dropped before I can even get to it. Like cmon I'm totally fine with it not even activating until like 30 seconds in if that means I wont get to watch it explode while I'm still half way across the map.
---
*Shooting Stars intensifies*
---
Dude... it‚Äôs just an idea. Besides,
---
-Ghostface stalks people, but when he does they suddenly aren‚Äôt able to instantly be killed by being stabbed once.
---
-Freddy can‚Äôt instantly put anybody to sleep whenever he wants in the movie
---
-The Pig, or Amanda, doesn‚Äôt actually use the Reverse Beartrap, as far as I know of.
---
I know what you were referring to, but still, the idea remains the same; The Killer could be any of us. They are like us. They *are* us. Besides, there‚Äôs no harm in taking an idea to the next level.
---
Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
---
You're too kind! I can't even put into words how appreciative I am.
---
Of course there are things to fix. 
---
If you have 3000 survivors and 2000 killers, then the problem that needs fixing is that not enough people want to play survivor. The solution is to give BP bonuses for people that play roles there aren't enough of, or give survivors decent BP gain to begin with.
---
If 2 people are DCing the instant they see your killer, then the problem that needs fixing is that DC punishments are so unlikely that people don't mind openly doing it at the smallest inconvenience. The solution is to actually punish people for ragequitting with something more severe than losing their offering/flashlight.
---
Late response: So you can experiment with different builds.
---
I don't use reddit as much as i used to. Derp :p
---
Imo he is a much better Myers, and i used to be a Myers main. 
---
Now Ghostface is my main
---
The memes are expanding... Sooner or later there will be a revolution.
---
You gotta stop lying. Yeah, you‚Äôre mad, but if you really expect anybody to believe that you do 3 gens, safely unhook, run the killer for two gens, AND escape without pipping, then you‚Äôre a bad liar. 
---
Rank 15 isn‚Äôt even hard to pip l m a o
---
https://i.imgur.com/DBIiFOm.jpg
---
This is pretty accurate
---
He's so slow that you can't help but feel like he had too many Chicken Fries
---
Is it on Netflix?
---
I‚Äôm dead serious. I haven‚Äôt been gaining pip for shit since this last update. All 4 survivors leave, nobody wins.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen very randomly. 
---
It‚Äôs happened on the farms and on the game. I‚Äôd be mid chase and I‚Äôd suddenly have corrupt purge. I like it though.
---
In most tier lists from this year it‚Äôs been considered number 1. It‚Äôs because if you pair it with a key and you‚Äôre the last survivor and the killer feels like being toxic and carrying you to the hatch to just shut in in your face it gives you a free escape
---
You're probably wondering how I got here
---
It's finnicky for sure and will sometimes not work, but a lot of it is figuring out the timing and range of it. 
---
I *think* a big glitch is that if you hold shift from the moment you enter the locker it won't work, you have to release the button and then press it down again once the perk activates for it to work. Also you can get exhaustion from it at random, but I haven't quite figured out exactly when that happens yet - I just realise mid-chase that I have exhaustion despite never having touched a locker.
---
Maximum point 32k, + Bloodhunt, + Cake + BBQ = maximum of 128k BP
---
It really depends on who I'm playing. If I'm Hag then I can trap the infinite, if I'm Billy or Michael then I'm fucked. I guess I just don't understand why people hate The Game so much that they'd let 3 gruesome gateaus go to waste. Even if I got Haddonfield I wouldn't DC on that
---
Considering this is an instant loss, I would argue it should have been top priority. On top of this, I realize now I always get this bug with the no wiggle/dead hard/recovering bug just to add insult to injury.
---
*stalking intensifies*
---
It felt like 2 months lol! The noises are all jacked now
---
My gt is CrRagnarok
---
Well then that leaves the survivor with two options and thats why the trap has a high parts cost.
---
Added
---
I tried to save him but the killer took advantage of that to block me out of the other gate. Which is what led to this situation.
---
CrRagnarok
---
Thank you! :D
---
I‚Äôll add you when I get home
---
Exactly the reason why I started running small game. It might not be a great perk for survival, but it comes in handy when I don't feel like searching for a totem for half the damn match.
---
HOW DO YOU FUCK RECORDING UP SO MUCH?
---
How does one even record their screen vertically?
---
Can someone explain?
---
It‚Äôs less *skill* than it is game sense. As a killer, the only real skill in a chase is how good you are at moonwalking and kind gaming. The rest is just knowing where survivors are, and BBQ takes care of that. So really it‚Äôs just chasing people down. It takes the same amount of skill to play killer as it does to play survivor. 
---
It‚Äôs not about *surviving* to be good. It‚Äôs all about how good you did when you were alive. It‚Äôs also not about *sacrifices* that makes you good as a killer.
---
This is amazing lmao, top tier content OP
---
Wake up was fixed in the last patch you dingus. Learn to read patch notes.
---
Rank 3-4: I use bond. I love it. I can tell if someone is going for a save instead of myself if we're close enough or if the chase is close to me or not. 
---
Aftercare is cool as shit. I'm very Alturistic so that's a fun one to run for me. 
---
I personally used Alert a lot in the beginning. Was helpful for the killer aura as well as Dark Sense (I believe that's the one) where the killers aura is revealed to you for a couple seconds when you finish a gen. 
---
Spine Chill is awesome, I use that a lot in my stealthier builds. Very useful if you know how to use it.
---
Generally I run Borrowed Time, Bond, Botany Knowledge (is interchangeable with an exhaustion perk like lithe, balanced landing or head on if I wanna meme), and We're gonna live forever (Blood point farming perk because GRIND). 
---
Have fun and good luck in the fog!
---
Well on some loops, if you don‚Äôt vault immediately when you see the red stain killer can reach you, so if you have the time to see the red stain and see it going backwards, then you‚Äôre just lucky he tried to mindgame but you didn‚Äôt responded lol
---
dude, I have the same issue, I've actually been holding off on prestiging *just* to immortalize this silliness.
---
That's what I am in the process of doing. I have David King with every teachable except for Jake and Quintin and now I'm building up killers
---
My name is NeonStar. I fucking love this. I am following you and waiting for anything you make. I might actually bug you for commission work if your into that.
---
PRAISE THE GODROCK
---
I realize why this is one of the most toxic communities I‚Äôve been in lol. 
---
I‚Äôm not quite sure why it recorded vertically, just happened I suppose. But thanks, for actually acknowledging everything except what I wanted you to acknowledge. Good job!
---
This is great
---
is that obama
---
I'm the opposite, I got some cakes for memory's sake and am not putting any more BP into him.  His rework simply doesn't appeal to me, which makes me a sad boi.
---
The apparition reminds me of SCP-106
---
Slugging is a good way to slow the game down. People don't seem to realize that (outside of banned stuff, of course) the killer can do whatever they please during a match. Even if survivors don't like it.
---
Imagine if DBD had the same mechanic as the first release of Deathgarden. Hold "button" for X seconds and send the survivor to a hook.
---
It happens when half of the fountains are corrupted
---
Now ... the first part is excused after that
---
I agree. This dude whines about getting downvoted before, then when the tables are turned and someone he disagrees with is downvoted for no reason, he shows no empathy whatsoever. He's exactly the same kind of person as the ones that harassed him before.
---
I mean I dont feel like breaking my neck to watch something. So I dont blame him. How do you even manage to record vertically anyway.
---
No Hope :(
---
Keep in mind that Tru will be mostly posting games where he has done well. So that might skew data further.
---
Must‚Äôve been more cakes it‚Äôs been a week
---
Myers gang rise up
---
Like i said, idk, it just happened
---
I was wondering if I could have permission to use the wraiths face as my twitch avi. Like would I have to pay you? And if so, how much would you want?
---
As if Rankings ever mattered?
---
Lullaby is pointless even with 5 stacks, which takes a lot of hooks to get to. Most good survivors don't need the skill check noise to hit them, and bad survivors wouldn't have hit them in the first place.
---
His perks aren't good for stall, but Freddy's stall is the best of all the killer kits in the game, it's more potent than Madness 3 and not limited like Pig's traps.  Failed Skillcheck notifications + regression combined with the natural slow of his dream power makes him a killer that's very capable of slowing things down.
---
Also, in regards to not being able to find anyone, his power has an autolock that will reveal Survivors through walls if you pay close attention to the dream orb, so that makes stealthing vs. Freddy very difficult.
---
What isn't balanced in your opinion?
---
The sound is still not fixed. The only thing I can hear is my character breathing and very faint heartbeat when the killer is behind my back. This is one of the reasons why I decider to take a short break from the game. 
---
Unfortunately the devs still didn't say anything about this issue.
---
This gave me so much anxiety
---
Shhhhhh just ignore
---
plz no rework Doctor.  I already don't want the Freddy rework, and Doctor's the other killer people point at when they talk about addon-dependency syndrome &lt;__&lt;
---
If an entire team surrounds me and continues to circle back to a downed/hooked teammate, then they are getting slugged. It's not my fault they are dumb as shit.
---
This looks so cool.
---
Dead by daylight
---
Starring Myers, playing himself
---
Why is Prove Thyself in "E" Tier? This perk is absolutely useful in my opinion.
---
He lyig
---
Phantom inspired?
---
Wooooow  I hate survivors like them.
---
I hope you use a VPN.
---
I'm ready for action sir!!!
---
Realize I'm not the killer anymore
---

This brings a smile to my face

If you consider the meaning behind the masks they're less cringe. They use smiley pins as a sarcastic statement, masks same thing, they aren't happy people, so the have a badly drawn mask to represent the badly hidden issues they have. (Lol clearly issues if vandalism and theft is their pastime)

If you're broke wait for something called a "Free Weekend" on steam. its temporary, but you are playing DBD anyway.
---
Took like 8 seconds to do 1 360
---
This was posted a week ago, why is it back up?
---
It's not how good he does overall, it's about how helpful Ruin actually is
---
sorry for not breaking my neck. use some editing software, at least an online one and reupload it
---
What you said you did gives you easy a pip in red ranks. In yellow ranks and green for sure a double pip. 
---
So get your stuff right because you're obviously lying.
---
Lmao this is so simple yet on point, I love it
---
You need to look at him for 1.5 seconds to spot him however your body blocks some of the spotting area so you need to get him in the center without your body blocking him and have it on him for 1.5 seconds. They made it 8% easier to spot him yesterday by making each side have 4% bigger spotting range
---
You can legit use the share button..
---
YOU SEEM LIKE THE COOL KIND OF SWF AS LONG AS SWF GROUPS DON'T DO SMALL DICK ENERGY SHIT LIKE SPRINT BURSTING TO INFINITES OR RUNNING TRIPLE TO QUADRUPLE DS I'M COOL WITH THEM
---
make sure when doing scratched mirror you burn a lerys or game offering for maximum potential
---
Claudettes are always potatoes. Doesn‚Äôt matter what rank
---
So half the fountains have to be corrupted and then a gen gets popped and you gain corrupt purge?
---
That can‚Äôt be intended right?
---
Ghostface. He is super fun
---
Seriously. I feel like it has only become worse. I play both and can see when either side is being ridiculous. The wake up bug was indeed shitty, but it wasnt game breaking like other bugs and I just dodged Quentin and took boxes. 
---
For the other bugs, I actually saw people defending the play with your food bug and devour hope bug saying it should stay. Like, what??
---
The good repost
---
I have no trouble with his ability tho, just know when to crouch and activate night shroud
---
I mean you have nothing to complain about, you still won
---
They brought the rights for DBD back last year, so Starbreeze has nothing to do with it.
---
i finally bought the clown last night.  hes so fun to use.  the chuckle is fantastic
---
Whether it is me or I see another survivor, the huge flip always makes me laugh
---
Except the only directional sounds made by Killers (iirc) are footsteps, which all Killers have, and Huntress' humming.
---
So you can't hear *exactly* were a Killer is. That's why red stain mindgames work.
---
I need a source for the names trademark
---
You get your Corrupt Purge automaticaly when all pools of devotions are corrupted, if that didn't happen and you really hadn't Iridescent Seal, then it must be a bug.
---
I think it is better to have more samples, the killer variety should not be very broad either, that has to do with the time as well. I wish BHVR would have some stats like these for people to see, not just themselves.
---
Botany Knowledge is superior
---
Ok well you must be going against very unaware Survivors because if they are even decent at being aware then your ability is useless you must be getting very lucky with the survivors you get.
---
Motherfucker this is mine
---
Is the point that you‚Äôre on that rock?
---
The gen had nothing to do with it, that was a coincidence.
---
I choose to get them because it guarantees that I won't have to see them again and increases the chance that I'll get what I actually want. Also what issues with sounds have you been having? Mine is fine as far as I know
---
I see what you mean. If you read some of my other replies, I stated why i like legion's ability and look. Basically it's more realistic and their ability demonstrates a scary bloodlust had it been real life hopping walls and stuff just to stab you. I'd be terrified
---
I can guarantee without the internet I would have never discovered this thus meaning I would have less fun! Is it cartoon levels of peaking (his head suggests he‚Äôs floating in mid air behind the wall) or is it stealth game levels of peaking (they aren‚Äôt even peaking, just got their hand on the wall‚Äôs edge)?
---
Any idiot knows not to do that ESPECIALLY with a nurse lol
---
It's settled, Blood Warden is a must-have for me now
---
I've had a lot of fun with him as well, and had pretty good results somehow despite his power often not being very useful.
---
I do think people underestimate the value of night shroud aside from marking survivors, the other effects of it are very relevant to his strength as a killer and he's more than just a m1 killer that has an unreliable instadown.
---
I love the Clown and his evil cough. I mostly play as him when I am killer.
---
yes [https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/c575nc/galaxy\_background\_for\_killer\_and\_survivors/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/c575nc/galaxy_background_for_killer_and_survivors/)
---
no fountain was corrupted since everyone stayed broken
---
Crutch counters crutch lol
---
Why is this game so broken lol
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been reading the comments. I love basically everything about them. There ability to vault over obstacles is extremely fun to use I love chasing someone then they drop a pallet thinking they can slow me then just vaulting it and killing them.
---
No, I'm on PC.
---
Honestly there is no reason not to get Teachables, chances are you'll prestige the character, and some can become very useful (Surveillance)
---
looool. delete this.
---
He has some powerful addons, but I rarely play him to be honest. This was a daily on a level 15 clown hence the low level BW
---
That's where it's at! Yeah it's always satisfying
---
#daaaaamn
---
I mean corrupt intervention at least ensures that the immersed people either wander closer than they normally would to you or get nothing done.
---
I get weirded at people I meet at my college parties, those guys are actual freaks. The oriental cartoon? Not so much, honestly.
---
Clown mains are kinda rare for some reason, even though he's mid tier he should be more common in my opinion. But he's the rarest one I see. So props to you!
---
My friend always plays Bill and we joke that he‚Äôs the grandpa of the group. A few days ago I bought the cowboy hat cosmetic, so he says, ‚ÄúGrandpa Bill handed down his cowboy hat to his grandson‚Äù. And here it is
---
That is definitely annoying. But I don't think I would buy that solely for that specific situation. I would buy it because I want to use it often and for fun and/or meme builds
---
Dont love it, dude stole my post i made weeks ago
---
Lithe is a hell of a drug
---
Blood lodge is literally nicknamed pallet town because of how many loops and pallets there are. You can literally chase one survivor who does nothing but throw pallets as soon as they get to them and by the time you break them all the gens will be done.
---
Stolen for use as a wallpaper... thank you for your service :)
---
i was able to get him to lvl 5 right off teh bat with whatever little bp i had, but i got lucky and pulled bbq and chili early on.   i doubt he's gonna be one of my main killers, he'll be fun to use here and there.   there''s certain killers i just dont touch (billy, bubba, dont even own legion)   but he'll be used more than nurse at least
---
Hooks and gens means how many hooks and gens were completed by the time Ruin got destroyed.
---
it's a really good film!
---
I think OP was refering to the number of hooks and gens that got done before ruin was removed?
---
You're right. There was a game a few weeks ago where Tru was getting absolutely clowned by a survivor for the majority of the game. He got pissy and started complaining that the survivor had his brightness changed so he could always see the red stain...even though it was through a brick wall.
---
Still haven't seen that game posted on his YouTube.
---
Thank you. I clearly misunderstood.
---
Brave of you to assume I'm  a mr pony
---
You‚Äôre right. I misunderstood.
---
ah yes, wraith, legion, and freddy are viable in red rank.
---
As much as I love the bloodpoints from events, I don't like the farming killers, the insane amount of ultra rare addons, and the amount of killers who load up the game for the first time in months making queue times take 20 minutes
---
DBD is like the worst best feeling ever.
---
How is that a betrayal?
---
The cosmetic set was based on Phantom of the Opera, and is available for $10
---
*Nice*
---
Survivor swf : "dodging should be bannable, just play with what you got and stop complaining"
---
Also survivor swf: P3 Squadette, flashlights and insta heals. T-bagging every pallet and waiting to say ggez at endgame chat.
---
I think it's rare for stuff like that to happen in this game. Most players don't know how to DDoS someone anyways. Sure, they'll threaten, but most won't DDoS you.
---
Well shit I‚Äôm sorry what are we supposed to do then?
---
Repost much?
---
To be honest, with how long the killer queues take during the event, I'd rather have a game against anyone rather than waiting an extra 10 minutes to find a game with people my rank. Outside of events though, I'm totally on board
---
hatch will always spawn when there is only one person left. killer can close it
---
How was anyone able to walk? So many crutches.
---
One trapper game, all 3 gens within 5 second from each other.
---
One of them had to DC so that the other could escape. It was THAT bad.
---
If the rest of your team is dead, you are meant to be outmatched. It should be difficult to escape in those circumstances.
---
Hatch is still the same apart from always spawning when there is just one survivor, even at 5 gens.
---
I usually can only play for 2 hours on other games but I found myself playing DBD for 4 to 5 hours.
---
Unless you're new and don't have a choice, I really recommend not playing a killer until you can put at least 3 perks on him. I won't even touch some killers until they have Ruin or BBQ.
---
Not to mention it's the most suggested killer since launch. It's almost a meme by this point
---
15% faster opening speed on the gates~Quentin main
---
Billy mains like OhTofu said that Spirit is better than Billy against good survivors.
---
And OhTofu made a Billy guide about how to become a God Tier Billy, so you can assume how good he is with Billy. But even him feels Billy weaker than Spirit against good survivors ...
---
I guess we essentially average the same amount during our sessions...
---
 Never said fun, I said *unique*. HIV is a unique disease in how it kills you, never said it‚Äôs fun to have.
---
*wemmmmm* (Obsession noise)
---
To be fair, I think you're pointing to an important aspect of game design. The more simple and elegant mechanics in DBD rise to the top, while the niche or overwrought ones tend to sink. That's not true in all cases, like Wraith, but generally speaking the simpler the better. Some unique ideas are interesting on paper but when released to the public they tend to fall off the bell-curve.
---
Unfortunately, it looks like they've gone with an overwrought design for New Freddy. Teleportation, sleep intervals, traps, etc. They've piled a handful of disparate mechanics onto one Killer. To be fair, I can see the underlying design concept of his dominance in the dream world, but it feels cluttered for lack of a better word. I wish they had just taken one concept and really refined it. Teleporting to generators alone is a simple, elegant idea that, if allowed to be powerful, would make for a strong Killer without all the unnecessary bits and baubles. Does it fit the Freddy theme? Maybe not. He's a tricky Killer to design mechanics for based on the source material. I don't envy the task.
---
it's because it has replayability and is fun the matches also last long instead of 5 minutes.
---
how to get everyone to dc basically
---
Seems useless 99% of the time
---
*"Jesus Christ dude, why the hell would an old butter knife do that much damage?"*
---
I mean yea, a good killer doesn't rely on addons, a good huntress won't use add-ons, a good nurse won't use add-ons, very few exceptions
---
These are the types of people who can't stand not winning. They will find an excuse to explain why they lost, or make fun of you for not obeying their made up pretend rules. These are also the same people who will hug infinites with balances landing, run insta med kits, and tbag at the gate when they escape saying things like "ggez" in post game.
---
I decided to level all Survivors to 40 before focusing on prestiging.  Probably just gonna make it more painful at P3.
---
I agree as a guy who doesnt main survivor or killer
---
Let's be real some perks are very bad. I would be so much happier if I never got the teachable for Territorial Imperative and some other perks unlocked. I never use that perk but I now have to suffer in my bloodwebs for other killers that I want to play or when a new killer gets released. Also I (and many) don't prestige anyone but what does that have to do with teachables?? Lastly, some can become very useful when buffed, like Surveillance but what's the point of getting it now in hopes that it gets a buff? It's not like it's hard to get the teachable again if you skipped it. I can easily just go to the next bloodweb and it will most likely be there waiting for me
---
Sounds are fixed, so Spirit is again consistent. Even Spirit mains said : " if survivors don't run Iron Will, they're f\*cked". But even for Iron Will, you can still hear footsteps, you still have phase collision, you still have charge time add-ons and you still have Stridor ( some people said that it counters Iron Will, but I am not sure yet ).
---
Crutch&gt;Crutch
---
hello I thank you for this message but I do it for fun and I just want to make a pack Dead by Daylight sorry if you hoped more :/
---
As any killer never bee line to you hex totems, they'll get wiped even faster if you do. Also 10/16 of the killers are shown of which 5 only have 1 game represented
---
feng min is a F O C U S E D survivor....
---
Not even close too the point but ok.
---
THIS.
---
4 survivors should work their best to win and not the gave the killer the upper hand, So if you stayed the last one with the killer you or your team didn‚Äôt do good at all.
---
Cluttered? don't you think the relegation of an entire killers lore and mechanics to "Just press M2 for the other thing" is a bit sparse at least? But I agree certainly the balancing scale is a thin edge to walk in that respect.
---
Ruin has a bad habit of not lasting too long (only 4 games had it last longer than 1/2 way)  and he doesn't have a habit of taking it easy early in the game. Any other streamers you know that say Ruin is mandatory for test?
---
tbh, you went ahead and messaged him out of salt.
---
He even made you Rage quit.
---
You kinda got baited pretty hard
---
Did you message him first?
---
Pig for obvious reasons
---
Looks like you‚Äôre the asshole here bud
---
Probably the best concept for a shapeshifting killer, well done! The only problem, which I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôve been bombarded with, is how broken SWF is. But against solo.... very good, and a fun change in play style. And besides, if you want to play as the killer but not against a SWF, you can always dodge :)
---
dc
---
There‚Äôs more killers queuing up than survivors, rank effects this too.
---
Lol nea
---
Yeah thats OhTofus opinion, not mine...
---
TBH I've just taken to playing rimworld on my second screen while I wait. So I get to play my favourite single player game while waiting to play my favourite multiplayer game. Kills time. I wouldn't be so salty if survivors just dc the second they dont like what I'm running.
---
Finally, accurate tier list!
---
Platform: xbox one
---
Type of bug: ingame
---
Killer: ghostface

Description: 
---
Unable to lean stalk
---
Survivor disconnected while i was picking her up and for the whole game i couldnt lean anymore
---
Noed teabagger. You‚Äôre right, there is always a loser.
---
U mad squirt?
---
I've seen this idea before, and it's a very interesting idea. However, a lot of your addons and perks are stupidly good. 
---
- A reusable sprint burst for killer, that ignores stuns AND applies the Hemorrhage effect?? I'd MAYBE be okay with just the sprint burst, but even then it seems broken. Add on the other things too and you've got one hell of an annoying perk.
---
- An insta down addon with only minor downsides? Granted this one isn't as terrible, but from what I've read, it seems easy to disguise, so this would give a shit load of one hit kills. But then again, iri head is a thing, so this one I can't complain about too much.
---
- An addon that is like bamboozle on steroids? Bamboozle was already boring enough to play against, so now you just made something that allows windows to effortlessly be blocking whenever you're even remotely near them. Survivors better hope they aren't playing on Lery's.
---
- An addon that both reveals survivors AND slows them down. Similar to your Kakorrhaphiophobia perk, you have an addon that does multiple different things. And it's only a rare. If you're going to keep this, increase the rarity. Or just split the addon into two separate ones.
---
- The uncommon addon that does something similar to prayer beads from spirit? I don't mind this idea, I just have an issue with it being a yellow addon.
---
Listen, I like your idea for the killer and the ability. But I think you could readjust some of these addons to be a bit more on par with some of the other things in game.
---
Maybe, I feel your pain. I hate solo survivor rn. I still play and can do ok since I usually am decent at looping but I hate campers and I hate farming survivors. (If you farm someone directly after I hook them, I'll chase you and not them, plus I tunnel you since you don't care about playing as a team.)
---
Fairly new why?
---
I am a rank 1 Killer, it is not that hard to remain undetected at all.
---
Why would I be mad, I wasn‚Äôt there.
---
≈ì
---
MY GOD YES THATS THE PRIMARY POINT WITH THIS POST!!! Like what happened to sitting in a lobby for 10 minutes then suddenly all survivors join at once? Now I wait 30 minutes to even enter a lobby!
---
Naw I use it to play mind games mostly like I save my frenzy for when they drop a pallet or they get a sprint burst or something, basically the ‚Äúyou think you can run from *me*‚Äù killer
---
Not to sound incredulous, but how do they tell the difference between a desync and a file edit?
---
It‚Äôs *Neck Day*, fellas.
---
I can‚Äôt understand these idiots who play BP offerings and then DC. Every game these past two weeks has been like this...
---
Same. My GT is AgentNathanSSR if you fancy playing sometime.
---
How do killers have it rough? I‚Äôm sorry but the last few months things have been tipping so far in the killers favour I‚Äôm finding this game difficult to play now as a survivor. Maybe that‚Äôs just PS4 but I‚Äôm running into constant tunnelling killers and the random people I‚Äôve been teamed up with have played.....well it‚Äôs been hit or miss. But the killers have been brutal and don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôve had it bad at all. Maybe it‚Äôs this event bringing out the worst in some folks, I don‚Äôt know.
---
The problem with killers like Pinhead is that he's too powerful and what you'd end up with is Pinhead without his powers.  I guess lore wise you could say that the entity stripped him of most of his powers but then I'd have to buy that the entity is more powerful than Pinhead ... which I don't. 
---
Perhaps one of his Cenobites but not Pinhead himself.
---
Pinhead is either an equal to the entity or more powerful than the entity. 
---
I will now return to my geek hole.
---
There‚Äôs 65 Survivor perks and each one has 3 Tiers, which equals 195 Bloodwebs. So after Level 50 you will have to go through 145 more Bloobwebs..... Enjoy!
---
I‚Äôm aware. What I meant was so what is BK is faster? Autodidact is more fun.
---
You're probably the first person I've ever heard call Doc high tier, let alone high-tier without addons lol
---
ffmpeg is free and would do it : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3937387/rotating-videos-with-ffmpeg
---
You also have to think about low rank. I'm trying to get a friend into this game but he has a bastard of a time surviving since at low ranks some (not all) people just hide and ignore gens or are super hesitant to do the gen. So it's making not want to play.
---
If you increase skill checks that really will only affect low rank, adding an objective might work but it depends what it is.
---
As for makeing gens longer, doing gens isn't very compelling. 
---
Plus the game is balancing for swf and regular all randoms at the same time so that also has to be looked at.
---
Honestly to fix it they would have to do a full change of the game. I have an idea how to balance the game to make all killers viable and swf not being to strong. Of course 
---
1: I don't want to be an armchair developer.
---
2: It would probably take a ton of time to develop and might not even work.
---
3: it could ruin certain aspects of the game people enjoy (especially solo survivors)
---
In all reality I don't know if an asymmetric game could be balanced while also letting both teams have fun. Especially since the best way to ensure a win for killer is making sure survivors can't do the objective and the best way to do that is to kill someone permanently from the match.
---
So when they get unhooked and the killer is nearby hitting the person that was just unhooked is almost always the best option since the other person probably need two hits to go down and unhooked needs one plus it will put them closer to death and once they die its way easier for the killer since there is less pressure from survivors. 
---
Obviously doing this is super unfun for the person who was hooked but unless the killer has a certain perk it's usually their best option unless they want to be nice (especially if it's the obsession and the killer has dying light.)
---
Tl:Dr. Almost every change they do is going to present a problem to one part of the the community so they have to do a full rework of the game in certain aspects ( which will cause a proble to part of the community) or it will always be like this. Asymmetric games are hell to balance while also making it fun for all.
---
Good point
---
Rip No Mither :(
---
Alert is S tier for solo survivors
---
That survivor was kinda *stupid*. He should‚Äôve recovered way sooner, and he should‚Äôve wiggled out when the ghostface picked him up.
---
What rank are these survivors?
---
21?
---
Me too
---
Felt like it
---
I read the last 'git' as "I'm finished with you, go away".  There might not have been a gud.
---
Honestly I believe the survivor is in the wrong here as presented to us.
---
If the killer started this message chain then I would change my mind.
---
wait for the killer to check a gate, hope they dont have whispers, open it when they leave
---
I know, but why can't I join a lobby and just wait. Why does it take 30 minutes to even enter a lobby when it used to be instant. I'm assuming its the dedicated servers but I mean I wouldn't be as salty if survivors didn't dc the second they see a mori, a doctor, legion, or spirit. It's frustrating cause as killer I can't be picky with survivors as it takes forever to get a game so if I see a team that I'm gonna assume is gonna be pretty toxic, I take a mori to counter the toxic ones. Loop me for the equivalent of two gens and t-bag while doing it or blinding me when I break a pallet, I'm gonna mori you. I sometimes never use my mori cause none of them were particularly bad. (I'm okay with flashlight saves, bodyblocking, and running me around an infinite. That's pretty much the only counters they have. But running me around an infinite long enough to make me leave you alone multiple times and if you t-bag when you finally drop that pallet, thats when I say you're being toxic) But survivors just dc cause it doesn't take long for them to jump back into a match so they don't care about ruining a game for the rest of us. I don't camp, I don't tunnel (unless you farm your teammates) and I'd rather hook you than mori you. (more bloodpoints) I'm not particularly toxic. BTW I'm a green rank killer.
---
They absolutely do matter. The only people that say they don't matter are usually terrible and inexperienced.
---
Just because you're Rank 1 doesn't mean you're good, but you're definitely not good if you struggle to reach Rank 1, only getting there once.
---
players need to stop bitching about NOED, like if you can work around BT and DS at the endgame, survivors can work around NOED as well
---
Then why does it conviently get cut off as if you had cropped out the text from my post?
---
All of what they said, and as the killer, they can no longer grab you while you jump in. They have the ability to shut it though, which automatically powers the exit gates to be opened. You can re-open the hatch with a key though. And, they can as well start the EGC by "opening" \[hitting the switch with your weapon\] whichever gate.
---
He‚Äôs suggesting pig dash downs survivors in one hit? That would be wayy too strong. Dash hits are already pretty strong as it is on most loops and really not that hard to hit. Pigs would just get up right behind survivors and dash them down. Which would make her like billy but dash has so much more maneuverability and ease to hit
---
I understand, but I don't like the penalty. If it had no penalty I'd have no problem
---
Because he said I ‚Äúwaited for my friends to die and got hatch‚Äù
---
You can see the top of another green text bubble from the guy at the bottom of the chat window, that probably says gud
---
Nope.
---
Trapper by default is a tinkerer and knows all about mechanisms and thus I propose he would be an expert puzzle solver.
---
I'll one-up all of your shirtless Myers fantasies by proposing a g-string/banana hammock Myers instead for this.
---
yea, is that why i have it?
---
There was a gud
---
That's not a reason to dc. I can't wait until all parties are held accountable for their dcs.
---
Hag is easily S tier. She gets 10 traps, doesn't have to pick them up, can strategically place them to prevent any loop, and most of all can force survivors to have to crouch and waste huge amounts of time to get around the traps.
---
I concede.
---
He messaged me first
---
Nope
---
One time I ran a baby Wraith around for 5 minutes straight and when he finally managed to corner me, he put the rage of a thousand suns into the hit and I did a friggin backflip.
---
I didn‚Äôt rage quit, I got hatch, and he messaged me first
---
Yes. Hell yes.
---
And if you spend your bloodpoints wisely, you will only need about 8.3 million of them!
---
-3 since you start with three teachables for that character :)
---
Meh not really unless someone has object and is really good at looping. It's bad if its a four man swf because they loop and gen rush like crazy. Takes some skill and luck to get a four kill on them. But alot of times, when you hook someone, just search the area for about halfway between stages. I guarantee if you search or walk away, you'll find out someone was following you around waiting for the unhook, and will get it the second you leave the area.
---
Yea I lost countless party streamers because of this shit
---
That is not even remotely the same thing and you know it. Nice false equivalence. You losing 1 trap to a flashlight burn out of the 10 you can place at any time isn't the same as just disabling Nurse from blinking.
---
The guys timer was low though. It really didnt matter he had a small chance to get him off anyways being the last guy.
---
They think its a sick joke. Except Michael. He likes Birthdays.
---
wait til you see some 3000 IQ doctor running insidious
---
I've seen so many survivors push the envelope in endgame when they KNOW the killer has NOED active. And then they get mad because the stupid shit they pull that might otherwise work results in them getting downed. Some games fall apart entirely when 3 people who had a clear shot at escaping go back to help someone who's already struggling on the hook. 
---
As soon as you see NOED just pack up your shit and leave.
---
Yeah, some days ago
---
They only bitch about it because they don't know it's active until it's too late and they decided to stay after gates to bully the killer a little bit more and then they get hit
---
Really? That‚Äôs cool. Relatively new player, and occasionally play wraith, didn‚Äôt know he had that
---
But I'm both! :'(
---
He must have been using Fragrant Tuft of Hair too because it makes it "easier". Also probably dying light so he has a chance in chases. It takes forever to get evil within 3 with those addons so you must have fed him or you somehow took that long to do generators that you had to hide in lockers.
---
That's literally like saying "Oh man the survivors have \*Insert whatever perk you think is OP here\*, welp, might as well just sit at one of the exit gates because they are gonna have to leave this place somehow and I'll hit them then"
---
Ohhh a power that really makes a difference. Also "strategically place them" takes time, and did you ever think in start running through the traps when she picks someone?  Bait her to teleport and run back when she trap a loop, or better yet, running away if she is placing a trap on a loop.
---
WE ARE ERMAC
---
LOL No I'm Xbox One I don't like playstation I been buying xbox since 2008.
---
New killer female Ghost(face).
---
These numbers as a total suggest ruin is a very worthy hex.
---
With that said I think everyone already knew that.  We just need to look at all the posts by survivor mains who want ruin to go away.
---
No One Escapes Death, it‚Äôs a hex perk for killers. When the exit gates are powered (5 gens done or killer closes the hatch), all survivors are exposed, meaning they‚Äôre a one hit down.
---
Can be countered by the survivors a) cleansing all 5 totems during the game so the perk doesn‚Äôt activate, b) finding and cleansing the lit totem once end game starts (assuming there aren‚Äôt any other hex totems still active) or c) just fucking leaving the game once the gates are open.
---
solo survivor is rougher than a killer 100%
---
This looks so real. Howwww ;_; I want it.
---
Finally, some good fucking food.
---
That‚Äôs tough. I was an original Xbox guy but I moved to the ps3/ps4. Pc master race though
---
When I first started playing, I thought hitting on the hook ended the struggle phase early, since people gave up instantly on their second hook after I slapped them.
---
I'm super glad that I figured out that wasn't the case pretty quick.
---
Wth just happened there?
---
Risky move not leaning, great play tho
---
Ah ok that does change the perception of the conversation. 
---
What did the conversation start with?
---
I think ruin falls off in red ranks because red ranks have the ability to just power through it. It‚Äôs all well and good if you know the spawns but running around the map hitting every totem spot wastes a bunch of time and is a great way to run into the killer
---
why are you thinking that audio isnt just as important as sight in this game...?
---
The Mulan of the fog. She will defend the campfires honour
---
Yeah, but you said Spirit isn't Billy good, but even majority of Billy mains think that Spirit is as good or better than him. 
---
OhTofu is probably a God Tier Billy, so you should consider his opinions about this killer.
---
i love the doctor‚Äôs lore because i‚Äôve put so much thought and research into it
---
i think he‚Äôs the best written character in the game honestly
---
Yeah seriously, almost every killer main I‚Äôve talked to/watched has said Doc needs a rework.
---
Why are you commenting without reading his post...? 
---
He specified chase music. Next.
---
The last reply had me laughing üòÇ

Thanks this helped get a better understanding of it

I main doctor. I don't think he's high tier, like Nurse/Billy/Spirit (last one is a maybe). He's mid-tier with an easy-to-none learning curve, but effective consistency.

Thanks! They were pretty bad, so it isn‚Äôt that impressive

"No One Escapes Dwight"
---
Hag doesn't even see them.
---
Clown loves it.
---
Well. You made some solid points. I guess I would just take it as Pinhead not using his full power. Deliberately. To toy with and torment the survivors, offering them exquisite pain.
---
We see here two morons in their natural habitat.
---
Ah okay. I play on PC. Other than the change to stereo sound which doesn't work for many, I can't seem to find any fix :/ I hope they get fixed soon
---
Well again the queue times aren't the worst part. Its the survivors disconnecting when they see I took something they dislike. Doctor, Legion, or spirit games always have a dc or two for me. So I waited 40 minutes for a game that wasn't worth playing cause killing three survivors with 5 gens is waay too easy if someone dc without even getting into a chase with me.
---
I was waiting for that ending.
---
Cruel Joke killers smirk at, "What the fuck, first christmas lights, then fireworks, then margarita machines, then weird ass farting plants, now this, what the Hell"
---
You should post the beginning of the chat too.
---
Yes, I run through her traps when she picks someone up all the time. I was one of the people to figure it out first.
---
Taking time to set traps is how you play Hag, good setup = good reward. If you only placing traps at one loop and not others, you are doing Hag justice lmao
---
&gt;And yes, if you run noed you are a babydick cunt
---
Imagine getting this upset over killers running 1 strong perk.
---
Deliverance got big disrespect and Pebble wasn't even mentioned PepeHands
---
Fairly new to the community. Would anyone care to explain why Freddie gets shat on so much? Every time I play against one they either a)get everyone and are the most terrifying thing in the world or b) get no one and suck. Seems to me that he‚Äôs a killer that‚Äôs really solid IF you can play him right. Sounds fair to me
---
Fucking Reginald
---
At the very least having no terror radius let‚Äôs you sneak up on people like GhostFace, I think there‚Äôs ways to make it work.
---
For example give them extreme move speed when not near survivors (which also helps against people spotting out a survivor moving faster than normal).
---
Most of the killers in the game already get destroyed by SWF, I don‚Äôt think you have to completely scrap an idea just because it exists.
---
Forcing us to pick up teachable perks just so we can get the choice of 2 perks is a pretty terrible design system.
---
Basically forces us to have a lot of shitty perks in our web if we play multiple characters and the system needed to be revamped like 2 years ago tbh.

---
He's my fave killer, and I've been wanting to play him for so long, but I'm waiting to save my BP on him after the rework. I wanna know how he plays so I can make good choices about perks and addons, you know?
---
It's her turn to kill
---
Lol do you even know what to mither does? Permanent injure for the full match, sure you don't leave pools of blood and make half the noise, but you still make half the noise! 
---
Arguably the only redeeming quality is the ability to pick yourself off the floor, but the killer KNOWS you have no mither, so you're never gonna use it. May as well just use unbreakable, which also let's you recover 35% faster.
---
no, i even said i didn't use it
---
up-doot for the title alone.
---
As opposed to the Mint Rag / Rusty Shackle Devour Hope + Make Your Choice setup that requires so much skill.
---
Flashlights isn't even that hard of a counter unless the person with the flashlight is chasing the Hag around destroying their traps immediately, which would be easily noticed and just means you have 1 less person focusing on gens.
---
But whatever, keep telling yourself that Hag needs a buff lmao
---
Fool. That's why you triple-back. And if that doesn't work, quadruple-back. And if you really wanna confuse them, spin the fuck out if your camera for 2 seconds and pick a direction.
---
Having every teachable in the game for both sides is a fucking nightmare.
---

Omg I look like an ad you‚Äôre right

You should‚Äôve seen the Claudette in that match bucko. I wouldn‚Äôt be t bagging for no reason otherwise
---
how this mushroomhead asian can be cute?
---
And yes I consider her S tier with Billy and spirit (Nurse is on Nurse tier), reduced to C tier because a item that can find on chests, it's really a good gameplay element?
---
I'll check it out! Thanks
---
What a toxxxxic killer running  that op mori
---
I‚Äôm glad to know I‚Äôm not the only one encountering that bug. I‚Äôve been stuck at rank 17 since Ghostface was released.
---
I know right? Plus a shit ton of camping and lag switching killers too. I even run into them on the PC version.
---
Imho Mori should require you on death hook or have a difficult skill check to fight back and free yourself. The lack of counter is why most hate them and quit asap from the lobby or even match. TS is another terrible one.
---
Killer with those 15+ min queue times
---
We rescued when he was right on top of us
---
And it's not just a perception bias for me, either. If I queue as (red rank) survivor, the "teammates" I get are usually around 500 hours at most, and positively atrocious at the game. Basically to an extent of refusing to play, not even repairing generators. If I queue as (green, purple and red rank) killer, the average hours of my survivors is 1000+, regularly SWF. I can get chased for 2 minutes with only 1 gen popping in that time, 2 if I'm lucky. If I have a chase that lasts 2 minutes when playing killer, that would basically be game over.
---
There are exceptions, of course, but that is what happens a lot of the time. I think people above 1k hours in this game don't usually solo-queue anymore, knowing how awful it is, and thus SWF-queue with people they know are at least trying to actually play. This leaves a lot of bad, inexperienced, stupid survivors in solo queue, and queueing solo yourself, you are more likely to be matched with them rather than SWF.
---
I like the challenge as killer, but solo-queueing as survivor is something I only rarely do anymore. If the killer is even only somewhat competent - and let alone camps, tunnels, slugs and uses strong add-ons - there is no winning with random survivors, much of the time. They just do not repair generators with any diligence, they do not last more than at most 30 seconds in chases, they do not make reasonable decisions not only from a game standpoint, but even on a common sense basis. They are like NPCs, literal non-players.
---
I hear you man, I do.  
---
My favorite killer of all time, Mr. Voorhees seems like a good person to bring in on face value as well.  When you think about it though he too wouldn't fit in with what the entity wants.  He's simply too slow.  I suppose if you combined the sack on the head version of him with his more well known hockey mask appearance but then you just have Billy without his chainsaw or Trapper without his traps.
---
You have to think small time for killers in this game.  Serial killers, small time demons, ghosts ... nothing too powerful. 
---
Pinhead is an all time favorite of mine though.
---
Holy potatoes
---
Niceüî™üëå
---
Sometimes if you don't press ok on the error message and get a friend to invite you to a survive with friends lobby you can still progress
---
I need him.
---
I do sooo survivor it‚Äôs easy when you aren‚Äôt a bot and know what you are doing. But you‚Äôll need to sell your soul in order not to jump every 10 seconds to a mike
---
Someone has recently been dicked by Insidious Bubba
---
Okay this is funny till the spine chill. No one messes with spine chill man. AND BOND! wow im like super mad ):&lt;
---
The biggest problem is survivors aren‚Äôt intended to cleanse full totems for any reason except for Boldness BPs. If NOED had some indication that it might come up, no survivors would be mad about it. NOED would essentially be a make the game last longer if you notice the killer has it, or suffer the consequences. As it is now, it‚Äôs a gotcha perk that gives 1 hit downs and a good move speed buff.
---
Even if they had a noise notification that NOED exists on the map when all the gems were completed that‚Äôd be a small step in the right direction.
---
I thought I was the only one. Ya'll botched this audio so hard. I'm turning off "Headphones" and "Mute focus" cause they apparently both ruin the game for me now. Thanks team :)
---
That clip had my heart racing from anxiety on your behalf. That was insanely close, goddamn.
---
Im pretty sure he was using only one brown add on, didnt see which one it was tho.
---
Genuine question, are there any builds where No Mither isn‚Äôt completely asscheeks? I only ever run it as a joke
---
I would spend 15$ on that cosmetic and I'm broke as hell
---
this is why you dont stretch your neck itll get stuck
---
Baha you definitely should have included that part in the picture
---
It‚Äôs a good perk that punishes survivors for beating the killer. Rancor is similar in that regard. However, as a survivor main, I‚Äôm not really upset by a killer running NOED because it wastes a meta perk slot that could make the game worse in the early game.
---
Every build but you have to be r20
---
It was a bad joke.
---
Nice, then you get to just cycle through them. All the fun of killer with none of the crap.
---
It‚Äôs all about the mouthfeel
---
Would she enjoy it? It‚Äôs a muscle boi who doin it.
---
Shut up crybaby survivor ez wins gg no re
---
XD
---
It doesn't work for me regardless of the usb I plug it into. I'm not using wireless or bluetooth.
---
Interesting idea, I'd like to know this as well.
---
I might be wrong. But how is the game broken? The guy ran into a trap before the hatch, what was broke About that?
---
Or estrogen. She does have a lot of feminine clothing üëÄ
---
The app is definitely really cool for creating and saving builds. I never expected to be that in depth about it when I got back into dead by daylight haha
---
If it was a stealth killer, it's more than possible that the radius was zero
---
Jesus
---
TIL
---
Everything!  Every.  Fucking.  Thing.
---
I think it‚Äôs best to reserve judgement until he‚Äôs actually in the game. We‚Äôve seen a little bit of it a month ago, and heard a little bit more about it- until players have actually got their hands on him, I think we should keep an open mind about this.
---
NoM, Resilience, Dead Hard, maybe Spine Chill?
---
A lot of peoples problems "m8".
---
Only to then get gen rushed :/ she sure should evolve quickly
---
OHHH DAMN
---
I not saying she need a buff, just to remove this hard counter that only she has, and yes, mint rag / shacked is very op, but is ultra rare, annnnd guess what? Flashlight just destroy that combo.
---
Idk. He seems pretty easy to break out of stealth when I play as him and against him.
---
You can do the same thing with Ghostface and it‚Äôs the best cause they automatically run to the killer shack.
---
Okay, I didn't watch ths first nightmare on elm street movie, but is this a scene from,it?
---
It‚Äôs not facts, this guy messed up a shit ton. Adrenaline, a top tier perk (ask anyone who knows what‚Äôs up) didn‚Äôt get a hug lol
---
Spine Chill got no recognition and it‚Äôs a pretty fucking good perk
---
Sloppy butcher synergizes with nurses and also adds some game slowdown.
---
It's definitely weird. I had an ace following directly behind me out in the open for like 5 seconds and he still didn't break me out.
---
Maybe he wasn't looking directly at me? Idk, it was green ranks.
---
On the other hand I find Freddy games pretty fun for the fact that they ARE unique. Me and my mates love going against a Freddo.
---
The little acknowledgement of No mither had me dying.
---
That‚Äôs a pretty good representation of the perks.
---
Probably talking about how the trap shifted to be underfoot, but that's just how the animation looks when you step in one, silly as it is. Otherwise, it could drag the survivor back to the trap, but I think that would bother people too.
---
I had never played him at all but got a daily for him right after rank reset. I think he's incredibly fun to play and I know I usually don't do well against him so I went for it. Ended up loving it and playing a few games and getting the adept Freddy trophy. I hope his rework helps him a little but doesn't take away the fun
---
I have the bone splinter on leather face, why is this a thing
---
Hag for Hex: Ruin, Leatherface for Barbecue &amp; Chili, Clown for Bamboozle, Spirit for Spirit Fury.
---
If you can only get one or two killers, Hag should be a priority, as not only is Ruin quasi-mandatory to have your games last longer, but her two other perks are also reasonably strong and fun - and so is she as a killer character. Then Leatherface, simply because BBQ gives you lots of Bloodpoints. His other two perks aren't bad, either.

Ah yes everybody knows WGLF is the most op survivor perk in the game.
---
Anybody else getting vibes off an old kids tv show called *trapped* from this? ‚ÄòClaudette you are the sabateur, don‚Äôt let anyone know!‚Äô
---
And dead hard is easily countered by the killer simply having a little patience before swinging.
---
In my opinion, Ruin is a symptom of a bigger problem. It just shows that gens are being completed to fast... make gens take a bit longer across the board and change Ruin. Make it affect the first 2 people to touch a gen more drastically and 2 people not at all. Then it forces 2 players to hunt Ruin while 2 players can play gen jockey. It still slows the game down, but at least it has some counter play and a reason to run it with purpose.
---
Alternatively, make it obsession and totem based, the obsession does gens normally and everyone else is affected. The obsession negates the effect if working together. If the obsession dies a new obsession is chosen.
---
Why is the tier list backwards?

Please delete this I am hurt

can anyone tell me the 4th perk?

And yet Ghostface‚Äôs night shroud ability does. Thank devs

---
Same here, man. Same here. Only reason why I suffered through the later sequels.
---
They literally just need to combine WGLF and WMI into 1 perk.

With all of the recent changes, solo survivor is definitely rougher.

Playing this game will get you tunneled
---
You're not wrong.
---
I‚Äôm personally not a fan of stuff like that because it adds a little on top of the already abhorrent grind. Currently you can get by relatively fine with tier 1 perks, but if they did this you would pretty much have to go through the bloodwebs RNG until you got everything you want to tier 3
---
I remember the pre looping times. That was fun.
---
Well... it ain‚Äôt like Freddy‚Äôs an idiot. None of the three versions of Freddy are actually stupid, so it really depends on the difficulty of the picture puzzle.
---
i dont tbag often but if i do it's usually to get the killer tilted. especially if a chase has been going on for a long time, a tatical tbag after a pallet stun will make easily bothered killers keep comitting to a chase even if they should've given up on it a minute ago. and with a new killer and pseudo double bp ive seen lots of baby killers lately, so I've been running ds lately anyways
---
The smarter way of saying gen rush
---
Cuuute
---
When killer closes the hatch, go to a gate and open it just before the first red light appears (about 3 seconds), then hide and wait for the killer to come over and finish it off when they leave.....or you can just open it all in one go but that‚Äôs more risky
---
I just flat out ignore it and I will ignore the guy who wants me to chase.
---
You're just rambling nonsense at this point.
---
Its been going on for over a week lol. There‚Äôs cakes in the bloodwebs that give +103% bloodpoints to everyone.
---
more like an offering event
---
*^^peanuts ^^theme ^^starts ^^playing*
---
I fully agree. Either combine WGLF and WMI or combine WGLF and NOLB.  
---
Unfortunately, though, neither of those two things will actually happen, so an eventual rework is the best we're gonna get.
---
Not running in a straight line will earn you tunneling.

Oh mah god so impressive

I have no idea what it is, but Ghostface seems to make survivors intensely stupid. I keep having people just forgetting how to loop when I'm playing as him, and just run straight into my face. I don't even have to turn on my shroud for them to do it.
---
Honestly the difficulties don‚Äôt mean anything for the survivors, they all play the same.
---
"We're going to live forever" A David teachable which gives you a bonus to alturism. Max 4 tokens, you earn them with safe unhooks and protection hits.

because Jake's perks revolve around not being bothered as much by being injured and being injured 24/7 isnt an easy thing for new players

Why is there a picture of Freddy smoking a blunt floating around the internet?

Dead Hard and the Sprint Burst trio were great.
---
Ghostface is stalking the puzzle
---
Awh man I make dumb moves too at rank 8/9 but I‚Äôm on PC! Hope you find a good group to have fun with :D
---
I see, thanks a lot. I understand that its technially bad to work on the same generator as someone else, but sometimes its a good option (its nearly finished so you team up with someone to quickly finnish it for example). I was just confused because it used the debuff symbol
---
I‚Äôm betting Ghostface is a young twink under that mask.
---
If everyone checks the common spawns in their portion of the map then ruin will easily fall within the first minute or two
---
Cool
---
I fucking love this.
---
I try taking hits(cuz wglf ) so self care and med kit is very useful for healing multiple times if the killer doesnt tunnel me for saving everyone
---
Working at Bobs Burgers.
---
Basically synergy perks that revolve around being injured.  The idea though is to try and avoid being seen of course in the first place but that's why Dead Hard is usually used to try and at least give you a bit of room to work with chases.
---
Yeah I am currently testing it but it is still too hard because if he close the hatch The Entity timer starts and you don't have that much of time to just camp &amp; wait for him to make turns.
---
What about the Sound Problems? I am surprised to see no mention at all. 
---
Chase music is at 10-20% tops. You literally can't hear Myers Tier up, you barely hear Freddy's lullaby, you can hear Ghost's leather more than the heart beat and the chase music and you can't tell when you are in a chase. I think these have to be fixed asap. 
---
**If** it was intended to be this low for the chase music, you should revert it to how it was or reduce it to 70-80% than before because it makes the atmosphere awkward.

---
I totally agree (I‚Äôm a survivor main). I don‚Äôt see why some people feel the need to tbag
---
yeah, you saw that claud tbagging? She was so toxic pressing ctrl, good that Op killed she without bm smh
---
I think it's 80 second for solo generator and 44 for 2 but im not 100% sure
---
:( aw that‚Äôs too bad. Thanks

The first time I did this, the guy rage quit. He was flashing me the whole game and t bagging and I admit he was pretty good. I decided to ignore him because I just couldn‚Äôt catch him, so I went for the others and he followed me being a dick the whole time. So at the very end, I hooked someone and he ran for the exit t bagging me the whole way. I strike him down and t bag him, on the way to the hook he rage quits and talks shit in my messages lol
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying but it could also add reason to the grind and all the people who spent a lot of time into the game get rewarded
---
On struggle hook is ok but the fact that you can't counter it is the bad part
---
&gt; for any reason except for Boldness BPs
---
But that's wrong, cleansing totems to not get fucked by NOED is a perfectly legitimate reason, and the intentional counterplay to NOED. Just because the survivors don't know in advance if the killer is running NOED, doesn't mean it's not a valid reason anyway.
---
Personally, the only thing I think needed to balance NOED more (I think it's pretty decently balanced regardless) is for DBD to get another 2 or 3 killer perks that orient around dull totems. I'd love to see that.
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre camping hook loser‚Äù no I‚Äôm just not being baited away so he can instantly be saved when you lead me into every pallet on the map
---
Clyde was a moderator too. Not sure if they still are.
---
That‚Äôs why you keep one survivor that has all the perks üòé
---
That's what I was thinking while I was watching it. Perhaps he'd already used his Unbreakable earlier in the match? His bleed out timer was rather low. So maybe that's why he didn't recover. But he should have wiggled as soon as Ghostface picked him up, especially with him swinging.
---
Then u are a cool person. Others do.
---
This was posted already smh
---
Battleblock theater was a beautiful game
---
What do you mean on struggle hook? Isn't that the current system?
---
Something tells me the devs are going to seek out more licensed stuff. Just this year, we‚Äôve had Ash and his outfits, Ghostface and his outfits, and soon Tapp and Pig‚Äôs stuff. This has all been/will be very successful, and has also brought in a bunch of new players I‚Äôll imagine (Evil Dead and Scream fans). So something tells me they‚Äôll be even more eager for licensed deals than ever before. This is good as I want H2018 Michael, and Pinhead would be badass.

You can see on the check, his name is A.Cambell... üôÑ

I think the party blowers playing are the perfect sound for when you hook annoying an annoying survivor
---
I would love to see him in the game, i love the first 4 movies.
---
Is this dude racist? What‚Äôs the point of the this video outside of the DBD reference? Just curious. Is it just like a funny light hearted skit about how different people interact with different people or is it something more serious and this dude genuinely feels like and believes this kind of stuff? Pretty interesting video. Never seen it before.
---
But if you‚Äôre not blind as a literal bat, you can see the survivor has a key. So that‚Äôs kind of irrelevant.

It's actually a percentage bonus to all categories, not just alturism.

Killer wait times have been ok for me on PS4, only waiting like 1 min.

I thought the problem was solved?

BS on Adrenaline.  Everybody uses Adrenaline

Literally JUST had this swf game. Flashlights, baiting, the works.

Is iron will bugged right now? I used it last night after not using it for quite a while and i still heard my survivor‚Äôs grunts while injured. And it wasn‚Äôt just my screen, I asked my friend if he heard me and he said he did.

I believe difficulty ratings are based off their starting perks.

You can find videos of it online, I‚Äôm a killer main and I rarely ever notice keys because of how hard they are to see. Plus it‚Äôs even harder to notice while crawling. It happens a lot, you‚Äôre giving people too much credit. A lot of people get thirsty for trolling and don‚Äôt pay attention and try to fuck with you only to lose the kill. Plus when I‚Äôm survivor I play Ash with his puppet and trust me nobody ever sees my keys.

It‚Äôs also why you get plunderer too. That way you can surprise the killer with a key mid match and they‚Äôll never notice you have it unless you make it obvious. Trust me, this happens a lot there‚Äôs compilations on YouTube
---
They also don't think. So theres that.
---
Can you do this for the Killer's Perks next??  XD  lol

Facerig. A man of culture too I see.

Im probably gonna spund stupid here, but is he actually playing or is that photoshopped? üòÇ

I've been There, just to stand in formation for 45 minutes because you have to be 15 minutes early for your superiors, who are 15 minutes early for their superiors who are 15 minutes early for the time they were told :P

I've seen Claudettes who literally just sit crouched in tall grass while the Killer is looking straight at them and is walking up to them.
---
You should be able to at least attempt an escape while you are the last one.
---
I know about adrenaline. Personally I don‚Äôt use it much because my team rarely makes it to endgame so I can‚Äôt depend on them popping a gen üòÖ
