I mean how many more things can you do in this game? At this point every challenge is gonna be a rehash of an already existing challenge. I feel like they haven‚Äôt thought this through and every challenge will be super repetitive.

I‚Äôve been banned from half the sub Reddits on Reddit I don‚Äôt give a shit. lol. I‚Äôll just make another account.

I did the same, just takes time to figure it out but sequence the keys like that to look behind
---
FUCK BHVR FOR BREAKING WGLF
---
Wait mobile doesn‚Äôt have the bloodweb? Lol wtf
---
I mean, with what you're currently wearing, the cosplay is done
---
I switched to PC just a couple days ago after playing on console for over 2000 hours as a rank 1 survivor. Keep practicing, it'll come. I find that I'm gradually improving every minute I play.
---

---
If it doesn't work out for you though, you always have the option to connect your controller to DBD on PC. Good luck.
---
Game is balanced around solo survivors. Felt like you needed to know that.
---
I have no issue buying the DLC's, I already bought Michael, Ghost Face and Legion through their respective DLC's, it's more the fact that it adds up quickly (¬£56.99 I believe for purchase of all DLC's available, though part of that is like soundtrack), which is quite a big investment if I want eg, 6 perks that are in 6 different DLC's. 
---
That's ¬£24 (with the winter steam sale) for 6 perks (Yes, I get a survivor and a killer too, but if I'm ultimately buying it for the perks, that's an absolute insane amount to spend)
---
It has the‚Äùblood market‚Äù which sucks. But you don‚Äôt need blood points to level your characters
---
This just proved my point though in the irony of you saying to someone you wouldn‚Äôt last old Xbox days. BOY you couldn‚Äôt even last a reddit comment chain without blowing up like a child üòÇ So please don‚Äôt go acting tough like you made it though the ‚Äúold‚Äù Xbox days
---
Must be your mouse. I've never heard of anyone else having an issue like this.
---
Get the fuck outta here. You know damn well I‚Äôm talking about the Mori spamming and leave all 4 of them slugged the entire 4 minutes when he‚Äôs already won the game and could‚Äôve just hooked them. I showed like 5 seconds of the chase so obviously that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
That was fucking amazing! It even got MY heart beating faster. That was a great play.
---
Holy shit
---
I didn‚Äôt blow up. You‚Äôre such a fucking virgin.
---
Another shining example of how the game's core issues are really the result of poor map design. Scott jund was right.
---
Ok boomer
---
It's the same kind of fucker that insta DCs when he sees a Spirit
---
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP CAMPING AND TUNNELING !!!! AGHHH
---
You really want to change a feature of the game that doesn't happen every single match or really frequently at all? Just bring Franklin's if you're that scared of survivors finding keys.
---
These devs should add new things to the game without the need for a perk. E.g. Lifting the pallets back, it just should've been a feature, not a perk.
---
Adding more killers and survivors won't make the already stale game any better. Add more features and ways of playing the game, increase the skill gap between average Joe's and gods. Allow killers to spend X amount of time to tinker with a single window which would disable it for X amount of time. Allow killers to tinker with totems to make them e.g. take longer to cleanse or harder to spot. Allow survivors to lift pallets back and maybe spend an X amount of time opening up a boarded window.
---
And it should neuter stealth killers. Perks and powers are like Rock Paper Scissors: if you bring OoO you picked scissors against a stealth paper. Now surprise grabs are common and stealth mains shouldn‚Äôt ever lose.
---
all u need is to not post an opinion for people to talk about that they will ultimatly dislike
---
How much would this mori even cost? Bcuz depending it's pretty useless and toxic, this is the nerf ebony moris need, the game doesn't need more moris, and it would just fill bloodwebs with more moris, so like have fun playing against a mori pretty much every game (Also browns are worst but cost less, this is a worst version of other moris that is going to cost about the same or more, making it pretty pointless)
---
Well, men have two holes at least. Otherwise you'll need a lot of goddamn fiber.
---
damn üò®
---
think of WASD like a compass for DBD W will always go north meaning in this game north is where you are looking meaning S will always go to the south meaning behind u.
---
&amp;#x200B;

I think that is some good advice to get to learn how to use M&amp;K
---
I don't know if you got out from a cave, but Microsoft has created a platform that is similar to a steam that is only for people who bought the game pass for PC, and there you can buy and download games that are included in the game pass, and dead by daylight is one of them, UNDERSTAND NOW?
---
Not much to work with? Boy you have spine chill. That is all you will ever need.
---
Did it first try on PS4 with leatherface.. but I was very lucky and saw it was full SWF
---
At the end I sent everyone of them a "sorry"
---
just normal way of fixing PC problems plug it in and out
---
Microsoft is still PC u dingus it isn't Xbox
---
Not their fault you're bad at the game.
---
I will wait for the next pass
---
Ok, this needs to be said. If you get so angry about losing a video game that you feel the need to message someone, you should probably not be playing video games.
---
Sick of seeing shit like this. Everyone is just trying to play the game, no need to get so butthurt about it and spew so much hate. Like if they're really that mad and they think u cheated just report and move on. People really get mad when you play the game and don't follow certain rules that aren't even legitimate rules of the game. People like that need to just grow up.
---
As in I know it‚Äôs a generic-stacked build, and was expecting people to give me shit for it lol.
---
I'M REALLY FUCKING TIRED OF KILLERS SWEATING SO HARD ON THE HOLIDAYS - CHILL THE FUCK OUT AND LET US MEME IN OUR SILLY OUTFITS DUDE. I'M NOT SAYING DON'T KILL US BUT JESUS CHRIST TRY AND STRETCH THE MATCH OUT MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS
---
Sometimes people don't enjoy aspects of one side of the game and so they only play the other. They may hate the gens and hatches of survivor, so they take out their sadistic tendencies on killer.
---
I have you an upvote for truth my guy.
---
Forsure man, I still consider myself an amateur at this game so I‚Äôm always welcomed to hearing others approaches etc etc.
---
are u downloading stuff in the background?
---
And ruin is the reason people bring this often, both should be nerfed and gen speeds should be a bit slower in general
---
it is when they have plunders instinct key appears ALOT in chests
---
just because it doesnt happen alot does it make it any less fun when the game suddenly ends with no warning at all there is no counter to survivor finding a key in a chest
---
Maybe it makes me a baby survivor but what‚Äôs the process of farming a teammate?
---
Entity was done with the bullshit today
---
Oh god, that one was annoying. Good luck to you as well!

Thank you, your well wishes worked, I got it done üí™
---
dead.....
---
Good job , I remember my first dukes and 360s and I can tell you they are a lot more fun when being new / under 200 hours . Mainly because they look cool and because you can feel yourself improving :)
---
If they have Plunderers Instinct then they are sacrificing one perk slot that could otherwise be Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time, Dead Hard or Unbreakable...
---
Look on the bright side of it, they have less odds of overall survival if they bring Plunderers
---
Originally I wouldn‚Äôt even of thought of that... but now that you mention it... hmmm...
---
Well yeah,you're right
---
What‚Äôs your point?
---
How does this have anything to do with DBD?
---
That just means you have to be smart as to when you use your perks

I completely agree with everything you said, and that spirit was a real piece of shit. However there is something to be said about how the creator of this video plays. If you watch the clips from the previous two games it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs strictly doing the objective then leaving. Following the killer around and chain blinding, hook techs (not toxic but abuses a broken mechanic). So yeah that spirit was a piece of shit and mori spamming abuses a game mechanic, but it‚Äôs not like he was playing like an innocent butterfly
---
Get used to MnK for killer and stick with controller on PC. Some people I know have said that the killer experience is vastly improved on PC but they liked survivor movement on ps4 much better.
---
Gotcha. I thought you meant something like Deep Wounds was fine and Legion cane along and messed it up.
---
You have become the very thing you sought to destroy
---
I played both tutorials and noticed that as well. Killer seems to play a lot more smooth on PC but alas, I am a survivor main :,-(
---
if they nerfed ruin, but compensated by reducing gen speed and nerfing gen jockey builds, I'd be very 0leased
---
Yeah? So? If you think you made me even slightly angry you‚Äôre an absolute retard.
---
I HATE IT WHEN KILLER MAINS ACT LIKE THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES DOING ARCHIVE CHALLENGES AND THEN BRAG ABOUT IT POST GAME. DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT SURVIVORS DC BECAUSE YOU WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY TO TUNNEL AND DRAG A SURVIVOR ACROSS THE MAP TO PUT THEM IN THE BASEMENT.
---
DBD was my first game I ever got used to playing PC with. It def takes time but each time you play you‚Äôll get better. It may be frustrating at first since you know how to play the game but can‚Äôt quite get the game to do what you want it to do at every moment. Also my hands used to cramp all the time at first and I was like ???? But your hand get used to being in that position and yourself will find better ways to have your hand positioned. Also switching to a mechanical keyboard help me immensely as well if you don‚Äôt have one. However that‚Äôs an extra cost and I know that‚Äôs not always possible.
---
You know, the mouse. That one that killed Minnie and a bunch of other babysitters. That Mickey
---
Oh I see. Why so many people are that scared of BBQ then?
---
wow literally fuck that guy, who reports for this? it literally doesn't hurt anyone
---
Loser should have disconnected
---
No swf themselves aren‚Äôt toxic it depends on the people in them now if you‚Äôre just good at the game it shouldn‚Äôt be toxic but I only view it toxic if you t bag and are jerks the whole game
---
damn. wanting bp so i can play other things faster makes me sweaty? and here i thought what made me sweaty was slugging with 4 alive
---
What...is M&amp;K......
---
do any of those perks give you a chance to just skip the doing the entire objective of the game, i would much rather face the perks you listed because they are fun to play against
---
as killer I have fun chasing the survivor outplaying them and even being outplayed its a blast, what isnt fun the game just ending when i dont expect it all, 
---
your argument seems to be since it doesn't happen alot its fine that this uncounterable situation can occur? 
---
what if the killer had a small perecent chance to just instantly kill everyone in like 1 in 20 games would it be fine since it doesnt happen alot?
---
because key does that but for the killer the game just ends very very rarely do I even see one survivor before they just all jump down the hatch because im blind sided by it
---
To be fair, no perk should've been that strong in the first place. And a strong ability should have a strong downside to go with it, to make it fair.
---
IT'S FUNNY WHEN KILLER MAINS ACT HIGH AND MIGHTY AS THEY WEREN'T PLAYING TOXIC.
---
I will try that next match. I read someone say to just switch from W to S and that did NOT fair well for me
---
I do agree slug timers need to be reduced drastically. Killer shouldn't get 4 minutes of keeping someone hostage in the game for free if they don't have self recovery perks.
---
Depends if the shroud drops before or after the camera effect procs, I swear I've seen people nearer than 32m using the addon but it's been a while since I've tried it

Yay! All the kitty mommas I've come across so far have been super duper nice. I try to boop their little noses when i get the chance

Sure look like your blowing up Mr. "You wouldnt last on old 360"

I feel like this could be a good meme template
---
this is so dope that behavior should hire your brother for their merch. their designs can be pretty boring. 
---
i love the crown of thorns on the one skull. great attention to detail
---
First person killed themselves on first basement hook, second DC's after I downed them on the way to the basement and the hatch opened.
---
He didn‚Äôt do any of that this game, and regardless it‚Äôs not BM so it‚Äôs irrelevant. If the Spirit was using some mechanic to progress the game he‚Äôd still be a dickhead but that‚Äôs on BHVR to fix, not the player to avoid. If Aaron was teabagging then that would be different. He tried to use the flashlight once that game, but stopped because he said you can‚Äôt flashlight Spirits, not sure if true or not but it‚Äôs irrelevant. And this Spirit tunneled him majority of the game. But regardless of how you feel about it he didn‚Äôt do any of that this game yet this Spirit chose to play like an asshole and hold the game hostage. 
---
Chain blinding and hook techs are simply mechanics to be used, they‚Äôre not for BM. Mori spam and intentional 4 minute long slugging are
---
If any of this is ‚Äúblowing up‚Äù to you, you‚Äôre one really soft person. üòÇ
---
‚ÄúPlaying with friends bad‚Äù
---
They were both from the same game and I only got 2 kills. I assume the guy that's upset died.
---
all the time unfortunately
---
Both are shitty, just in different ways lmao. Solo is shitty because the randoms sometimes... and SWF is shitty because communication trumps all and allows for coordination you cant get in Solo. Cant balance either for the other side at all without removing SWF but that would annoy anyone wanting to play with friends NOT in KYF. It creates a hard balancing issue. The only solution I have is either make a Competitive/Casual mode and that will make shitty Q times even worse. The Devs are in a tough position.
---
Who didn‚Äôt give poor Michael a bed?
---
I'd like the ability to even play mobile without downloading questionable apps to my phone or changing region.
---
I was gonna say, yeah you're playing trapper
---
I really thought BHVR was going to be like ‚Äúsurprise everyone here are these  skins for everyone else‚Äù  on Christmas but I guess not :(
---
Says the guy blowing up over a minor slight
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c3s05o/comment/ert80ul
---
Like this guy describes
---
It makes sense to change moris to work like that since many killers hook once and then mori. Some killers will actually wait until after second unhook.
---
lol. If you say so, nerd.
---
You have to roll between WAS -SAW or WDS -SDW
---
I switched from ps4 and that‚Äôs what helped me figure it out. With the cramping I changed crouching from control to caps lock which helped me too haha cause I felt the same. Good luck it‚Äôs genuinely just time and you‚Äôll get used to it
---
Reminds me of when my friends at time and me went drivin around and they were yelling random insults at people, I really didnt want to do it but when it came my time to yell I did. 
---
Every single time it was a "useless armadillo fact", like that the three banded armadillo is the armadillo that rolls its self into a ball when threatened.
---
It‚Äôs really common for killers that get looped to shit most of the game to be toxic when they catch a survivor. And it‚Äôs not even like they caught Aaron out of skill, unfortunately Shelter Woods is a terrible survivor map and the Spirit caught him at a deadzone. And then with mechanics like bloodlust as well the game is designed for the survivor to eventually be caught if the killer is half decent and determined enough. 
---
And no he didn‚Äôt do anything except loop that game. He used his flashlight only once.
---
mouse and keyboard
---
I had a game where it never worked against the pig. I kept getting downed right when it would go off. The last gen got finished after a failed dead hard and the game wouldn't let me move for a bit. Just as the pig was going to down me again, it let me use dead hard anyways and I avoided the hit. She left me for some reason and I think I escaped that game.
---
P.S: I have video of this if anyone wants proof

Imagine you get snatched up by the entity and then you‚Äôre chilling at the campfire then *Jesus*

Amanda look so tired working on her RBT
---
He wanted your attention instead and is mad that he didnt get it from Papa Trapper.
---
Of course you're going to get it if you hack to get survivor perks on killers :P
---
I had a streamer tell my friend and I to get raped, among other things, because they played like a potato and tried to farm us so we just died on 2nd hook to get away from them and out of the match. I reported them to Twitch and Behavior, and surprise surprise, nothing happened.
---
we gotta start being harsher on our living requirements, BUUUUUT that can wait till we all have our missions done
---
because they don‚Äôt use the perk when/if they play killer, or never bothered learning how to counter it, probably
---
absolutely.
---
Ruin shouldn't be close to a requirement for killers and it shouldn't be such a bitch to deal with for survivors
---
Right now I have running as M4 and crouching as M5 and that seemed to make a pretty big difference but getting used to WASD as a whole is just overwhelming. I bumped my mouse sensitivity up to 100% but I still feel like it isn't sensitive enough
---
There have been games with people who bring Sabo items and just sabo every hook, and there was apoint with two people left, one guy on the ground with a key and the Sabo dude. I downed the first guy in a deadzone, and chased the Sabo guy hooked and killed him, shut the hatch and the second guy didnt have adrenaline. Cant pick him up and have him escape via hatch. So I had to slug this poor guy for four minutes.
---
Yes ez
---
Yes
---
I hate when the timer is running out and people just stay until literally the last second for no reason. Like them staying isn‚Äôt helping anyone and someone who might need hatch will end up dying because of it.
---
Arbitrary? I'm literally advocating you play the way that scores the most pts. If you tunnel you lose out on pts. I really dont care what bhvr says on their website. I am literally advocating you play what scores the most pts. Do I need to say it again? The goal is merciless with 32k. If you tunnel. If you facecamp or do any other "shortcut" to 4k then you are not playing the game to the standard it sets. You just want to kill. If all you want to do is kill, then the only thing you are sacrificing is your score and respect from the other PEOPLE you are playing with.  Remember those 4 other people you are playing with, are humans. Its why people who only want to 4k really need to gtfo killer and play survivor.
---
even sometimes ruin doesn't feel like enough alone. i like going on chases, so gens pop really fast unless i have like 2 or 3 slow down perks. the devs want me to chase people and manage to get 3 hooks per survivor but without an almost full slowdown build, you can't afford to chase people like that
---
I don't want to talk about that though. 
---
Nerf ebony.

---
killers need an emote. i need an easier way to express our desire to farm
---
They all load in at the same time...usually
---
I don't know why people do this. I feel pain when i see a lower ranked killer at the end of the match because it feels like shit to have the odds stacked against you like that. I usually apologize and say gg when the match was unfair for the killer (rank wise) because it's literally the shittiest feeling ever.
---
If u prestige someone u ussually play someone else why u get them some better perks ussually
---
Now that‚Äôs the SPIRIT. :)
---
Absolutely nutworthy
---
Thank you! Yes, the nurse was the most stressful part.
---
whenever I am on a situation like this, I just alt+tab and start watching YT videos until the game ends. Just don't let this behavior get in your head
---
no, I don't download anything when I play. also nothing much is running besides antivirus
---
Or you don't because you like the look of the character? Some people don't care about having  meta or even good perks and just want to have fun.
---
Yeah cause there is nothing wrong with it. If people dont do totems then that is on them.
---
Thank you! Next: Beat Saber
---
I feel obligated to reply since I did not down vote you and I don‚Äôt want you to think I did. I rarely downvote.
---
Oh ok
---
If everyone escapes through the hatch then they must have already finished 5 gens, therefore they are already able to escape.
---
If 3 people escape through the hatch then they fixed 4 gens which is almost winning but it's very rare to find the hatch at that point in the match.
---
If 2 people use it to escape then it's a tie, no one loses. Everyone wins.
---
If 1 person escapes then yeah, it sucks but hey. It's not the end of the world, you already won the game if you killed 3 of them.
---
Thats very counter productive but i guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
&gt;Why try to change the mind of someone with nothing intelligent to say?
---
I completely agree. That's why I'm not going to respond to you anymore, and just block you. (I block everyone I argue with once we finish, don't take it personally.) I stop bothering with people who only see the world in black or white.
---
Hint: Perks aren't always "the meta" or "d tier." There's a middle ground of perks for people with different playstyles.
---
:)
---
Sounds are hella bugged this patch. There's been multiple recorded instances by pretty much every killer main on Twitch of slugs making absolutely zero sound regardless of what perks they have. Add this on top of other random sounds not occuring when they should and it's been super frustrating to play killer in general.
---
Lol, make it a big ass Inception noise, like BWAAAAAAAH. It'd be funny.
---
I feel bad when I find keys tbh. And I run plunderers so i find a lot of them.
---
maybe that is it dunno thought last time I had problems with my game freezing it was bc I was downloading a game in the background
---
In the future, dead hard at an angle to avoid those hatchets clipping you at the very end of your invincibility frames
---
not a huge angle, even just 15-30 degrees would‚Äôve saved you a ton of stress right here
---
If there is someone else at the hook you don‚Äôt have to leave and that doesn‚Äôt make you a camper (or it shouldn‚Äôt and the fact that if killers want to rank up they have to leave no matter what is stupid) if they don‚Äôt lead you away then it‚Äôs their fault. Trust me I know how it feels because I play a lot of trapper and getting unhooked and stepping into a trap and getting put back on the hook is apparently considered ‚Äútunneling‚Äù
---
_Killer disconnected_
---
I'm not sure what people are on about. 
---
1: Mori cancelling is absolutely bannable. Hexy was banned for it for 24 hours. Send the video to BHVR, for everyone's sake...the killer is a POS. 
---
2: Window techs and hook techs are a form of skill because it's not easy and good killers look for it and catch it. It's not a broken mechanic, and can be used as much as you want without banning. 
---
3: Slugging to secure a 4k is super sweaty but fine, it's a tactic. That being said, there should be built in unbreakable on a 2 minute timer. If they slug to avoid DS, its 1 minute. Anything longer than that is holding someone hostage and being a douche. My opinion, after 2 minutes an unbreakable type mechanic should automatically be available and allow survivors to pick themselves up to make the game move forward.
---
Yeah, people who divide the game into two sides are the worst, something should be done about them.
---
spirit dlc. Adam is great and spirit too! Stranger things too imo
---
how do you add in the line crossing out the text?
---
It's not really counter productive. OP still has good perks, plays a character they spent money on and it's probably more enjoyable to them than playing fat Jesus with default cosmetics just because they have better perks on him. Like I already said, perks aren't everything.
---
Thank you, I was waiting on someone to make that joke!
---
TBH I feel for the killer. Closed the hatch, timer was almost done, only 2 survivors left, he was set up well. Should have been a 4k for killer IMO.
---
Why do you have dead hard and balanced landing?
---
If the ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è wasnt a giveaway i dont care too much about this convo sry
---
It is absolutely not toxic to enjoy a GAME with your friends.
---
All I'm saying is you have a good idea if it's implemented differently, but as it is its just going to make the game worst
---
Aight man but you still cared enough to comment in the first place
---
Didnt care just pointed out something i found funny/ridiculous
---
LOL I'd say water is gonna win by far
---
Ideally, buy the DLC you can't purchase with shards.
---
I dont see it
---
I am a big Xbox player but I only play DBD in PC. It will take a while to get used to keyboard and mouse but I think it‚Äôs worth it. A mechanical keyboard helped me a lot in transitioning from controller to keyboard.
---
You just illustrated my problem with this whole system. The game is too simple for challenges to evolve. They're just going to get more tedious.
---
Man CS is like dbd in a way, where if you fail to do a play that saves the whole team you'll get shit on by everyone on your team, And the other team combined
---
Survivors get too many chances as it is. Borrowed time, unbreakable, decisive, dead hard, adrenaline. Didn't need mettle of man too.
---
Legit buff solo in ways that don't effect swf, then nerf survivor. E.x kindred base kit.
---
Or "That was really stupid" or "Don't wiggle I'll give you hatch".
---
I just SNORTED
---
I play mostly killer and that really upset me when MoM got nerfed. I understand why, but it really wasnt that big of a deal.
---
Luckily I rarely play against killers offering ebony.
---
Holy shit that‚Äôs impressive!!
---
If your actually getting gens and whatnot done then no not having any interaction with the killer is not being detrimental.
---
When the last guy is waiting by the hatch and they make me wander around looking for the hatch just so they can jump in as soon as I see them.
---
Soooooo funny
---
AMEN.  I am NEVER saved when I play and I rescue everyone.  One time I played against Michael and I went to save these people.... saved all 3 of them, he hung me and they all opened the gates and left me to die. It's ridiculous.
---
Halloween one from rift pass.
---
I was playing on Xbox so that doesn't really apply here.
---
I was surprised it wasn‚Äôt taken
---
That was amazing!!
---
Did you take a clip from a Yt video to complain about something that happened to a creator you watch?  Ifso that's a whole new levle of fanboy commitment.
---
Ive seen worse, step Up your game
---
Again, your lack of reading comprehension shows. I'm talking about the perks, not the Killer. Please, please stop embarrassing yourself.
---
Was that fookin deddard
---
he does seem pretty cozy
---
SWF is not toxic. Being a toxic shit is toxic. A lot if killer mains complain about SWF because they can be difficult teams to face. Statistics prove killers get 3 kills on average per game, which would include the games they get 0 kills from good SWF teams. I've watched popular killer main streamers who are considered among the best have game after game of constant 4ks with SWF included and still complain about them and toolboxes and keys and DS. Anything is toxic when you want your kills handed to you on a silver platter. 
---
Don't be toxic and it won't be toxic, regardless of comms.
---
No, DS rewards survivors who mess up by giving them a 60 second period of being able to do whatever the hell they want and just jump in a locker to either force the killer to pull them out and eat it or sit there wasting more time. It's fine in solo queue where coordination doesn't exist and time optimization isn't a factor but should be disabled entirely if you queue in a party of any size.

LOUD NOISES

WTF MEGGGGG! WHY DID YOU STOP HEALING ME WHEN THE CLOWN WAS COMING????? HE WAS VERY FAR AWAY, DID YOU FUCKING KNOW???????????? I CAN BE VERY MORE HELPFUL AND EVEN ESCAPE THE CHASE IF YOU CONTINUING HEALING ME AT THAT MOMENT. YOU COULD HAVE HEALED ME 1000 TIMES MORE BEFORE HE CAME. AND LOOK! I DIED. I DIDN'T BRING SELF-CARE TO HELP YOUR ASS OUT OF HERE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND THAT HOW YOU TREAT ME, HUH??????
---
WTF YOU'RE IN RANK 2!!!! RANK 2!!! YOU KNOW???? WHY DO YOUR PLAYSTYLE IS SO IMMERSED LIKE RANK 20 PLAYERS???? HOW DID YOU BRING YOUR ASS TO RANK 2???? F\*CK YOU.
---
Tbf finding Keys isnt exactly a puede of cake, and you get a shit ton of mor√≠s in a bloodweb sometimes
---
wow, you guys are jerks lol!
---
No, once the timer expires the rift closes and everything with it goes, You can still get all the lore in the tomes
---
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do dooo
---
What did it used to do?
---
Oh yeah, didn't notice that. Well then it's beyond me how this happened
---
It‚Äôs come to a point where I feel the same way. I‚Äôve started to keep a count of how many hooks each of my teammates have, and if they are on death hook and in chase, I will go out of my way to take the killer‚Äôs attention from them. I‚Äôm not trying to say that I‚Äôm a hero, I just believe that it makes a difference when a teammate dies, and usually for worse. If everybody is dying one by one, it only gets harder to escape. Killers can pressure survivors, but survivors can pressure them too by keeping all four players alive. 
---
I try not to be too selfish in my DBD matches nowadays. I can‚Äôt do gens on my own, or distract and open a gate at the same time. I think it‚Äôs good to take hits and hooks for your teammate if you trust them enough during the match!
---
my brain instantly translated that into mikey tier up
---
You hate him cause.you can't blendette around his ass huh?
---
Well I'm kind of dumb, it was my mouse leaving the dbd window
---
Nea is the entity confirmed
---
No, it‚Äôs actually the ship on the swamp when the genes completed
---
Say my name
---
Maybe that is why I am thinking it was a middle. I know for sure it was at some point.
---
pffff unbelief able you all suck (DEATH SCREME}
---
How dare you insult our bunny mother
---
How about you show us the message you sent him first bud. Kinda feel like you started it and trying to blame it on him
---
I should have reacted that way the other day when I had 12 hate comments on my profile from a Russian survivor I played against + their friend
---
I don‚Äôt understand why
---
Nah I was playing with my two friends. One left with Rando to give hatch possibly and my other friend died to head trap. I failed 3/4 boxes and ran around hoping to find hat lch and that beautiful screenshot happened
---
This gave me anxietyüòÇ
---
I didn‚Äôt. When you assume things you make an ass out of u and me.
---
If I was that killer, my face would look like this üòê
---
I still don't understand... steam doesn't show current players and recently played with for dbd anymore. Are you playing on some other platform?
---
I get the same thing. However I don't know about the OP but I have an i5 4th gen and GTX 1060 3GB which can easily run RDR2 on medium. And yet I still freeze on DbD. It's usually when a gen pops, hex cleansed, killer hits me. Etc. And it will all be random. I can go some games with no freezes.
---
Literally shows a time stamp at the top from a message you sent. Stop lying you look stupid
---
I would 100% be OK with certain slowdown perks being lessened or disabled against a team of entirely solo queue players assuming I knew as a killer that it was a solo queue game. That's when you get to actually have fun instead of running meta bullshit every game.
---
As for DS being disabled, my stance won't change. You're already getting massive advantages by being able to utilize things that are useless in solo queue like Prove Thyself and Object of Obsession without having to resort to a 60 second invulnerability shield for every member of your team.
---
Have fun! Just started playing on PC myself and it's way better. =)
---
Nice setup! Enjoy the grind! I came from console and giving up until they get cross progression lol
---
Why are you using two exhaustion perks?
---
Tbh i too want Sydney in dbd.I was actually wondering why they didn't put her in the ghostface pack.I just finished watching the movie and i was actually thinking on what perks would she have if she was in the game.
---
Get fucked.
---
Funny thing is most don't even stay till you hit them. Also you don't get chases unless they sprint. Also also how about don't be a petty piece of shit? They literally had to add a mechanic to prevent Survivors just staying forever.
---
Block every 3rd hit without any downside
---
The wraith getting pallet stunned
---
YOOO
---
There‚Äôs a message stating that the direct message was made.  Give me a minute and I‚Äôll give you an Imgur link
---
I fully agree with your opinion. Personally, I strive to get the whole team out at the end of a match. Ot's nice to see there are others with similar mindsets.
---
Thank you
---
He shouldn‚Äôt have played with his food
---
I'd love to see Ellen Ripley from Alien join the survivors.
---
a 2 killer game with more survivors would be so fun lol. probably a shitshow but unlike anything they've done.
---
"Feliz navidad de parte de diosito"
---
Totally understand. Luckily I was able to fix it with some help so I‚Äôm all good now!
---
It would activate after being hit 3 times so people used to farm hits while using Med Kits to keep themselves healthy. After that they were free to loop the killer for at least 2 hits.
---
The slow is the "when you're walking" vault
---
that would be toxic
---
I‚Äôd think her perks would be something to do with running away from the killer lol
---
This is a great idea I love this one
---
Why was this downvoted? Is trying to start a discussion annoy people?
---
Maurice is a unit
---
That was tense.
---
Wait, so if the wraith was chasing you without Myers there  would it still play the Myers theme or would it default to the normal chase music?? Just curious
---
Not the healing she needed, but the healing she wanted
---
Idk where you live but on the east coast they always have a good amount of statues for DBZ, Fallout, MHA, comics, stuff like that.

I've heard of a few cases of people being bugged out and immune to hits lately. It's a shame this person abused it like that though. That's probably considered exploiting, but I doubt they'd get banned since they don't know how to actually take damage.

You should report the first person. Playstation will actually remove said msg and warn them. It's hilarious. Some kids freak out because of it.

No, because hes pretty broken. Even after the forever freddy nerfs hes still broken.

Ghostface wasn't from Scream, so that's why no Sydney.

its not about me winning its about the game ending with no warning at all it isnt fun at all
---
Are you serious or are you just joking around
---
Honestly, as a PC player, having people talk shit to me in games is the funniest shit. Had a 4 man SWF say I was hacking as huntress ‚Äúbecause of my play style.‚Äù Had a dude in CSGO call me a ‚Äúvirginlord cuckmonger.‚Äù And some of the conversations I‚Äôve had in Halo Reach Big Team Battle since it released on PC have been the best of the best.
---
Me and my buddies were just talking about this a couple days ago. Or a mode where killers fight eachother and have hp bars
---
Yess
---
hatch appears when 3 gens are repaired so no, swf does make it easier to tell others you have a key but its possible without coms just find another surv and do the follow me emote, they look at ur hands see you have a key and follow you
---
Isn't this already that?

I have to make a decision to run meta perks or to run franklins demise or something else to make sure I can mess with them.

I'm on Xbox, I literally never get messages lol. I haven't gotten a negative message in maybe a year
---
Wats you address
---
Well it was a good killer and we didn‚Äôt even know about that until when I took the screenshot
---
Funny. I get saved at least 2 times every single game and I am terrible at playing survivor.
---
Are you rift level 70 btw? Just curious
---
I really don‚Äôt know. I couldn‚Äôt find any evidence of it. It looks like the Hag (Plague?) has a middle finger perk though.
---
In a perfect world, the game would be balanced.
---
you can still get iridescent Gatekeeper without 5 gens, what matters is how long the gens stay up along with how long you kept the remaining gens up to 9 minutes.
---
I'm not a fan of people painting the the actual functional half of the emblem system as flawed when the real issue lies with the Malicious and Chaser emblems. Those 2 do not take into account each individual killers power and therefore Trapper, Hillbilly, Michael, Pig, Ghostface, Plague, and Oni are all negatively affected by it, along with several other killers when you consider add-ons.
---
Welcome to the Dead By Daylight Subreddit.
---
If the hive mind doesn‚Äôt agree with you, too bad.
---
Lol.
---
You're really comparing survivors doing rushed actions and the killer getting a notification for it to finding a key in a chest and a killer getting a similar notification?
---
Do you know how obnoxious you sound right now? With your logic, survivors should receive alerts whenever the killer kicks a generator. How about that?
---
You're comparing finding keys which barley ever happens to me at least and as stated by others in this thread to Myers tiering up and Plague getting corrupt purge.
---
When Myers tiers up, he gets a speed boost and can instadown immediately for a period of time. That is definitely enough to compensate the survivors getting a notification that he's gotten his tier 3. Also, Myers has a larger terror radius and walks with his knife up in the air at third tier so survivors will see anyways. 
---
Similar to Plague, when she gets her corrupt purge, the survivors who have cleansed to allow her to gain access to her power would already expect her to tier up from the fountains that they cleansed from so it really doesn't make a big deal. As well as the fact that she has red particles floating above her so survivors will see that as well.
---
Sounds to me like you had a bad game where you didn't split pressure properly or gets downs on survivors and then someone found a key and they escaped with it.
---
Survivors still need to do gens in order to use a key because the hatch won't spawn until 2 generators plus the number of people that are alive are done. This definitely leads me to believe that you just did a poor job of making sure generators weren't completed and the survivors punished you for it in the end.
---
I'm in no way saying that keys are fair because they are one of the most broken and unfair items in the game and I'm saying that as a survivor main but neither are mori's and noed so it evens out for now.
---
If you don't want to run into a problem like this again, do better at splitting pressure. Something you obviously lack.
---
While we‚Äôre at it how bout one for the default outfits too
---
?
---
oink~‚ô•
---
Clearly. It has lost all meaning in our speech now. It pretty much means ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like what you said or did.‚Äù
---
The default outfits that survivors come with don‚Äôt show up in the outfits tab
---
the issue with that is now that we have Surveillance, Pop Goes the Weasel, Thrilling Tremors, Corrupt Intervention, along with decent slow down abilities, and other perk + power synergies for slowdown. These all have to be taken into account when looking at gen times, it won't be as simple as upping the gen times +x amount of seconds without all these perks becoming substantially more powerful.
---
Like the base outfit when you get a character.
---
Like the Charity Case and stuff? I think its mostly because none of them really fit together
---
Man, you just get more and more pathetic. I'm over here laughing my ass off. Is it really that hard for you to admit that you were wrong? "I'm sorry that I failed to comprehend your post, and I'm sorry for lying about holding degrees just to try to win a meaningless internet argument." It's honestly just that simple.
---
I mean, you wanna know how I know you're bullshitting about owning degrees? You're posting on Reddit. No-one with that level of success spends their time on Reddit arguing because they're to narcissistic to admit they were wrong.
---
Merry Christmas. :)
---
Yep I managed to hit level 70 a couple of days ago
---
Oh yeah, they should
---
I get where you‚Äôre coming from but in this case, IMO, it actually IS toxic to resort to insults towards a stranger because of a video game.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/efp24a/more_bugs_pls/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
What do you mean its right there
---
No the default outfits the ones you don‚Äôt have to buy or earn. The one equipped to the character when you start up the game for the first time
---
Yeah I dont main either of them. Currently rank 1 survivor and rank 3 killer (xbox)
---
Holy shit lol
---
From my personal experience I didn't find it that hard to finish challenges. I took a break after the first day of the event and returned only a few days ago to the game. If you have a couple of hours to spare you could possibly get most of the challenges done with some luck
---
I don‚Äôt disagree. It‚Äôs messed up to do this. This is what it‚Äôs meant to represent not someone pressing the control key over and over.
---
Lets goooo Chief that was dope
---
I don‚Äôt. But it was on the Temple of Purgation and there was a dc earlier in the match.
---
tbh if it was consistent it would be a A tier power bc it could deny to make every loop not efficient for survivors if the doc is close enough.
---
but it is not consistent
---
I really dont take this game as seriously as some so my anecdote may not mean much, but i have gotten stomped by players using it. Ive also just continued my pursuit after the free hit and downed them like normal. Four people with it along with dead hard and adrenaline is definitely not fun though
---
Same here. Why would you want to only have one half of the game? Both are fun IMO.
---
The bleedout timer takes way too long imo. Not fun or engaging to be on the ground for 5 minutes.
---
I imagine someone going to a place and they ask
---
why should we higher u?
---
I can fix problem
---
appropriate answer would be "what kind of problem?"
---
Freddy I the better killer in terms of power from what I hear, havent touched him yet since the last Time I did, all the survivors disconnected. Pig is pretty fun to play with, albeit it the rbt require a bit of rng to work, unless you put it on them when its endgame collapse, forcing them to choose either death by rbt or by entity.
---
Exactly, great for just being aware of what‚Äôs around you
---
Especially good for staying on objectives and it has nice potential if combined with inner strength
---
Inner strength / q&amp;q / head on / detectives hunch is a fun perk combo to run, so long as you‚Äôre the only one running it
---
There's no way they'll make DCing like that bannable. What they need to do is what they were planning all along, and that's to make DCs leave a survivor "husk" that you can still sacrifice for points (and challenge progress now that the rift is a thing). They mentioned wanting to do this a long time but they're trying to do so much at once that who knows when it'll be added, if ever.
---
If they built it properly it could definitely be a viable competitive mode I think
---
it is a buggy game ive seen games where stuff has spawned for one person but not for another so probably for the Feng that rock wasn't there  idk about the hits though that just looks like DBD bullshit
---
While it offers no in game benefit, WGLF is a good perk to get a character leveled up quickly and to get perks on them.

What I'm arguing is that you shouldn't be judging people on the way they play because of your own arbitrary opinions on the game. I understand the value of ds, but I don't run it because it is imo a crutch perk that barely works, if at all, because killers rarely tunnel in my games. And if they do, they often wait it out because they are not brain dead idiots. 
---
&gt; Theres no justification you can give for prematurely killing survivors
---
Prematurely? Unless you're talking about the killer using a mori or the survivor accidentally dying on hook, there are no premature deaths. You die when you die. If you got tunneled, oh well. 
---
&gt; If your goal is to play COD go back to COD
---
Idk why you keep comparing this mindset to COD. I've never even played a military shooter, and this game is in no way at all similar to it. I guess trying to kill people efficiently makes me a generic COD player? I wouldn't know because I don't play those games, but w/e.
---
It's a sad that you're go to defense is just to assume and hope that the people that disagree with you are bad players, instead of trying to address their points.
---
ew
---
What are your thoughts on NOED? Look, this facecamping tunneler guy told me to kill myself in postgame chat because I rekt him! Which DLC should I buy next? Wow, matchmaking put me, a rank 20 killer, with a 4-man rank 1 SWF after a 120 minute queue, F in the chat plz! Look at my EPIC skill-check hitting skills after I DSed the killer who hooked me right by the exit gate. I can also press E for Dead Hard, did you know that? I reached rank 1 for the first time after 3000 hours and living below the poverty line, upvotes to the left. I know it's not much. Who else worships our great lord wholesome Otzdarva? Also, what about a killer.. who can pretend.. to be a survivor? I've been thinking about this idea for forty hours and would love to hear your guys's thoughts on it.
---
So you dont know how to counter huntress
---
It was wild. Also I love your username.
---
Perfect summary, thanks. Let's not forget easy karma recycled memes.
---
I would equip that perk
---
Pfff hell no the amount of times I've hit that tiny window to deny loops it just kicks me in the face with lag
---
I always get scarred when the killer doesn‚Äôt have ruin at rank 1. Like this guys confident enough to apply pressure without ruin??
---
Karma on both, reddit and dbd.
---
You really can‚Äôt anymore.
---
Aw, thank you! My capricorn ass is pleased.
---
Even if it had a great use that isn't easily beaten out by better items, it's still not worth it to ever pick it up.
---
Although I have brought in green keys to bait Franklin's demise, to good effect. Basically nullifies a perk.
---

---
Typical trashy killer main.
---
Good u shouldn't be able to use ds if you have time to do gens
---
Bees aren't born fully grown. They go through metamorphosis.
---
I can and will judge anyone who thinks the way this game works and the expectation is "choose your own adventure" because its so clear that it isnt that way. 
---
&gt; if you got tunneled, oh well.
---
Yes, sounds exactly like someone who shouldnt be playing this game. If you think 1 hook or mori'ing is efficient, well thats your mental holdup for thinking 10k is a higher # than 32k.
---
Your points so far
---
-i refuse to accept how the game scores me
---
-i want 2 4k cuz I dont accept how the game scores me
---
Uh? Do you think those are acceptable points? Please move on to another game if it too difficult for you to play this one correctly. 
---
In NFL the team that wins scores the most points, not the team that gets the most sacks or what ever other metric you think you are entitled to.
---
Really just need a counter on the hud, if I pop 3 dull totems and cant find a 4th and/or find a broken one I'm going to assume they are all gone and am gonna be a little unhappy if noed kicks in.
---
Fine enough otherwise.
---
For the morons in the back: you can't get banned for farming, the developers of this game have said so themselves. Don't like it? Complete the gens, leave, and go cry to your mother.
---
That's kinda the point though. Otherwise noed would never make it to when it can actually be used. Plus finding the totems isnt actually that hard
---
Getting punished when a survivor should be punished for getting hit without a reason is the biggest example of a DBD crutch just like old DS "oh what's that u got fucked it's okay just have this perk that lets u recover from most mistakes"
---
Oh man. That was beautiful.
---
It‚Äôs always had the downside. Your aura is show to the killer while 14meters away until your downed again. Since day one release it‚Äôs been that way. What changed was taking a hit for a token to taking a proc hit.
---
 I want to see what they would with some of the wipe animations, like if they put the keeper, then does he just bang his mallet on his head?
---
You'd think with old DS they learnt something but nope
---
No you're not, I have it too! Infact, in every game I play I experience 95% less bugs than my friends or people I know, half the time I feel like people are looking for themüòÖ
---
Solid bait. Should be applied almost every game tbh, so easy to do especially since you have a smallish terror radius, if they‚Äôre awake.
---
Doesn‚Äôt run dead hard l
---
I play killer but there was literally a survivor named ‚Äúight ima head out‚Äù lol
---
Assert Dominance
---
Its really crazy how they dont dc cause they dont wanna play anymore, it‚Äôs specifically to say fuck you you aren‚Äôt getting you‚Äôre challenge done. When Im playing survivor and the killer has got 3 basement hooks (as of late because of the challenge) ill just give him the 4th cause that challenge blow, I havent even attempted it yet
---
I mean, its fair to diss how i use it, but unless it explicitly states that it can't be used when grabbed, then it should function (Not to mention it still ate my DS in the end)
---
why are people like this
---
They seemingly didn‚Äôt realize they ran into a wall and were confused about how I caught them since lunge distance wouldn‚Äôt have covered the distance they would‚Äôve created with sprint burst. They also made a ‚ÄúHa ha I‚Äôm not salty but just wondering how you caught me ha ha‚Äù post on my steam profile.
---
Yeah dont worry about end game chat
---
massive brainpower, op!
---
I was having a bad day one day and a survivor got pissed at me for some reason and I literally said the word "fucking idiot" and I got banned the next day for a week. üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs so damn obvious who‚Äôs new at this game and doesn‚Äôt really play past rank 15
---
Gotta make sure those feet are clean I guess. I hate vaulting as Oni for that same reason his legs are to damn muscular.
---
Wait it‚Äôs not a middle finger? I‚Äôve been playing this game for over 2 years and I swear it‚Äôs always been a middle finger
---
Same that‚Äôs the moment that morphs most people to just do a petty report. At least that‚Äôs what happened for me
---
Leatherface
---
I don't know how to test it but I'm almost 100% sure that you have net 0 gain in distance with the shock
---
Windows might be better than pallets since they can't keep running.
---
By lag do you mean when they still vault after shock? That happens when they've started the animation before getting hit by the shock, happens to me every time I try to shock someone at a window
---
Video from rdcworld
---
Good on you for not even replying
---
I see noed as adrenaline for killers. It gives a second chances for the end game stage and let‚Äôs the survivors know that the game isn‚Äôt fully over. I find it equally frustrating as a survivor seeing noed pop as I do when i see all 4 survivors get adrenaline. It can be abused some times but I think it‚Äôs fairly balanced atm.
---
I get seriously frustrated playing Ghostface sometimes because survivors don't understand how stalk works.  I 85% their stalk before they reveal me, and then either I leave or just hang around waiting for my Shroud to cooldown.  Because I don't hit them, they get it in their head that I'm farming.  No.  I'm not farming.  I'm waiting out a timer to kill you.  Stop inviting me to kick your gen.
---
I once did an experimental build where I killed a survivor and then 99% the stalk on the other 3.  The goal was to have make-shift stalk noed for free with Bloodwarden on GF.  Survivors had no idea what I was doing and kept trying to farm with me.  Then they flamed me in the post-game chat for "betraying" them.
---
TL;DR  Ghostface isn't your friend just because he's not hitting you.  Your stalk is 99'd, so run like hell.
---
In the final screenshot, he went on to say that "he (me) didn't earn it/deserve it xD". I've given up on trying to complete the challenge, it's too much of a headache playing solely around basement + hoping survivors don't D/C.
---
Unfortunately that means I'm gonna have to play a crapton more games to finish my archive, but I'm never getting that challenge done.
---
"What emotion does this image invoke?"
---
"Lust."
---
That one is just hard to play with to me if your used to other console controller, pro controller like $60 tho.
---
I just want my 5 archive points :(
---
Its really bullshit considering survivors dont deserve a lot of the things they get, Ive seen so many people get so cucked by this challenge for hours on end, I dont blame you for giving up
---
Stretch to make it work, but the lead girl from The Craft, Sarah. The killer would be Nancy and the other two, they‚Äôd be called ‚ÄúThe Coven‚Äù, float around casting magic. And it‚Äôd be like the legion where it‚Äôs multiple teens as the same killer. 
---
Sarahs perks would be witchy without breaking the realism the game has. I‚Äôve thought about having a witch survivor for a while because the phone game called Identity V legit has casters as survivors with magic abilities. Guess I‚Äôll post my perk ideas here. Lol  
---
Character Class: The Lone Witch

Solitary Practitioner
---
While working on a gen by yourself you gain 10% repair speed. You gain a token for every great skill check up to 2/3/4 tokens. For each token your ally‚Äôs gain 4/5/6% repair speed. 
---
All tokens lost upon being hooked by the killer. 
---
Sacred Circle 
---
You start the trial with 2 tokens. 
---
While healing you lose a token instead of a heath state when hit by the killer. You passively gain a token every 100/80/60 seconds. This applies to self healing and while healing an ally. 
---
If you loose all of your tokens you enter the broken state until you gain a token. 
---
If you loose all of your tokens twice during the trials your circle is broken, and so are you until the trials end. 
---
Inner Calling 
---
You‚Äôve always been motivated in times of great need. This ability has an exhausted cooldown of 60/45/30 seconds. While running towards an injured ally‚Äôs direction within 42 meters you move at 150% movement speed diminishing over the span of 15 seconds until you return to 100% movement speed.
---
These look incredible, wouldn‚Äôt change a thing! Can‚Äôt wait for these to be made! Incredible stuff dude
---
I think he means the survived bloodpoint notification right after you exit.
---
To be fair it's on the original song in the line immediately after the one referenced.
---
She gets them hot, then shows them her WAHH.
---
Some people will bait the hell out of you just to get you banned. If I hit high ranks I just set messages to friends only after that.

This makes me so sad

BHVR HAS A REALLY GOOD THING GOING FOR THEM BUT POOR EXECUTION AND MANAGEMENT ALL THE WAY AROUND. IM REALLY HOPING THEY PULL THEIR HEADS OUT THEIR ASS AND GET THIS GAME ON TRACK AND NOT CONSTANTLY DEALING OUT BROKEN SHIT, WITH DELAYS!

TAKE 3-6 MONTHS OFF TO FIX YOUR GAME AND QUIT DUMPING OUT SHIT LEFT AND RIGHT OR HIRE ANOTHER COMPANY TO COME IN AND ASSIST ATLEAST.
---
I‚Äôve been in the receiving end of NOED far too much
---
I‚Äôve actually come to realize something now that I‚Äôve had enough survivor experience to break into purple ranks: SWF has nothing to do with it. Once you get past rank 10 and start getting grouped with purple ranks the game gets substantially easier. You survive a lot more often when everyone knows to focus gens when they‚Äôre not getting chased and they aren‚Äôt getting downed in the first thirty seconds of the match, aren‚Äôt disconnecting after their first hook, aren‚Äôt leaving people to either die or enter the struggle phase on their first hook, are letting you heal them instead of self caring ‚Äî I can go on.
---
And when you don‚Äôt show up to give them attention they bm you with the audio from lockers and vaults . Fucking brainlets man

---
I'm running a build that incorporates this alongside Breakout in an attempt to get rewarded for helping other players struggle free. I'll admit that it's not been entirely successful but, the one time it DID come together, it was absolutely brilliant.
---
I've gotten and seen iridescent gatekeeper very regularly with 2-3 gens remaining simply because the game was stalled out a significant amount of time.
---
I also see no problem with that Sacrifice category, especially since the minimum for a Gold emblem is literally just sacrificing everyone, so you could theoretically 1 hook everyone and still get a good score there. When the prerequisite of the emblem under it has clear conditions, you would expect it to hold true for the one above otherwise it would make no sense that you can in theory 3 hook 3 survivors and leave 1 survivor untouched and claim that is Iridescent quality for Sacrifice.
---
In general Iridescent emblems are in theory rewarded for performing above and beyond what the category expects of you. It technically shouldn't be the norm, which is why the bulk of the ranks don't even need an Iridescent emblem for you to rank up with the exception of red ranks which need at least 1 Iridescent.
---
The bigger problem is that the emblem system doesn't take into account killer powers. A hillbilly who instantly saws 1 person in a 1 second chase earns a LOT less Chaser and Malicious than a Legion who Frenzy stabs a survivor 5 times in a single 90 second chase and lets them get away. The emblem system ignores powers that skip health states, that's a bigger problem in my opinion.
---
Also for clarification, double pips shouldn't be easy to obtain, you should expect to have a good match against an adequately skilled opponent to earn it, which is why I'm all for the stomps of the killer/survivors barely awarding a black pip since you didn't prove anything of note there to rank up.
---
/r/dbdgonewild leaking into live game yet again.
---
(Also now hoping someone over there sees this and does some Claudette x Feng now)
---
Actually I do. As long as I pip I dont care
---
Would you rather have Michaels power cancelled completely just by being stared at or have 0 terror radius at any time after a cooldown of 20 or so seconds after hitting someone and getting free grabs unless the survivor has half a brain
---
perk "i want to speak to your manager": wastes everybody's time by demanding teammates watch and not allowing the killer to move until the entity comes down herself
---
https://imgur.com/a/5E22zYd
---
If a player DCs on hook it still counts. I honestly think they need to make a DC count as a kill even if it‚Äôs not on a hook. All stages should be counted as if the survivor was hooked and sacrificed. Also since talking about dead survivors, why don‚Äôt thanatophobia count dead survivors? It means fear of death so why‚Äôs it not counted
---
Wondering how to rip sounds for fun stuff like this. Are they just stored in uncompressed format in the folder?
---
Also as someone completely disconnected from pop culture but can still appreciate a sick beat, that's a sick beat.
---
I haven't seen many DCs lately, or basement builds in general, so I assume most people have gotten it by now, or stopped caring. Good luck to anyone still working on it.
---
That‚Äôs what I call it when the survivors just sit in the gate and don‚Äôt leave!!!
---
Why do you run sprint burst and dead hard?
---
Don't speak to your family like that.
---
Read the other comments, I‚Äôve already answered this.
---
no it is meant as a ANTI TUNNEL PERK if u sit on gens close to the killer not giving a shit then u shouldn't get to use the perk
---
Maybe it's changed again since the last time I've done it. Been a while since a survivor had tried to loop me on a harvester.

20th Century Fox would rather license another shitty standalone game than allow their IP in an actual decent ensemble one.
---
Make it so the stacks required for the perk to activate are gained through both protected hits, and safe-hook rescue or something else. Protected hits are way too janky and don‚Äôt always count so having something more consistent could help make it more viable again.
---
*cries in Robin*
---
Yeah I use that in PC
---
Yeah xbox is WAY more toxic than pc or ps4
---
*woman pointing at cat meme* which boils down to "me vs toxic survivors"
---
Thought this was banned lmao
---
This is the reason why I did. You never know what kind of map you're going to end up on, or what kind of chase you're going to be in. Having options gives you confidence to make the plays you need to, and makes you unpredictable.
---
Detective‚Äôs Hunch has become my favorite perk for this reason
---
And 4 stacks on BBQ
---
Prove Yourself will be the death of me
---
What the actual fuck is wrong with you
---
&gt; When Myers tiers up, he gets a speed boost and can instadown immediately for a period of time. That is definitely enough to compensate the survivors getting a notification that he's gotten his tier 3. Also, Myers has a larger terror radius and walks with his knife up in the air at third tier so survivors will see anyways. 
---
when survivors gets the key the game ends if you dont defend hatch thats way worse then any of the things you just listed
---
&gt; Survivors still need to do gens in order to use a key because the hatch won't spawn until 2 generators plus the number of people that are alive are done. This definitely leads me to believe that you just did a poor job of making sure generators weren't completed and the survivors punished you for it in the end. 
---
its really isnt about me winning its about the game just ending with the killer having no idea he should do something to try to stop it just isnt fun, you dont feel like you lost because you were still trying to win and stop the last few gens
---
 the killer and think theres a chance there 2 gens left he thinks he might have this its a close game 3 survivors alive and hes hooked the all at least once or twice and then BAM game ends no warning, there was  no survivor in lobby who had a key and suddenly game over score screen, there is no oh shit i gotta get to hatch before they escape no tension of trying to find survivor with key or defending the hatch because theres no warning of it at all
---
&gt; If you don't want to run into a problem like this again, do better at splitting pressure. Something you obviously lack. 
---
so basically the surprise keys are fair because the killer was bad enough to let them do 3 gens thats your logic.
---
Frank West from the Dead Rising games. I understand that Resident Evil is more likely to get a DLC, but Capcom owns both of the games, so if they made a DLC for one, they could probably do the other.

I'm surprised no one uses it more. After the buff I was too scared to run hex perks but I still barely see anyone run it. I guess it's just because there's better perks.

---
idk about "best" but i main him almost always running monitor&amp;abuse
---
survivors ***Have*** to respect his terror radius since if he can sneak up on you you're done as survivor so having that extra 8 meters to sneak up on people before they can even react is pretty huge. I run that with bloodwarden  since getting people who are trapped inside exit gates is the funniest thing to me (most people would prefer ruin but I find it too much of a gamble and I can ensure BW activates but opening a door  after i down someone when gens are done)
---
His BBQ&amp;Chili is good to run too for prestiging and to keep you moving on the hunt
---
and for slot 4 it's kinda your choice. games moving too fast? take ruin anyway, I like bamboozle or blood echo personally
---
You become the pig for a game
---
I mentioned football cause its easy to wrap your head around. Which you somehow failed at. FFS dude. This is over. Play like an asshole. Be whats wrong with the community. 
---
I dont give a fuck what your rank is. Your justification and play styles are all representative of green ranks so please fill up imgur with pictures of red rank players, you've already admitted to me you are a green rank. 
---
And obviously the game is pretty damned difficult for you if you need to play like a sociopath. I cant believe this shit, its xmas and you want to spend it trying to justify playing a game like an asshole.
---
When u use the offering. You can play as that killer which is the pig in this case. Basically you just play as the killer. With no perks or addons
---
GTA Players: ‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù
---
That's what he said
---
Camping has always been a complaint among the community. Basement hooks are guaranteed camps, and basement builds give away what the killer has in mind.
---
Survivors know what kind of game it will be and that once they go in they aren‚Äôt coming back out.
---
Now the devs in their wisdom decide to make this a challenge, not learning a single thing from the previous basement challenges.
---
So survivors get basement build after basement build, get salty and ragequit. Which means killers dont get their challenge so they create a new lobby and try again which means another basement game which means more disconnects etc
---
Now imagine if the devs simply didn‚Äôt create a challenge that almost everybody on both sides hates....
---
Let us get back to the POINT
---
I wouldn't say Wake Up is trash.
---
Keeping track of the Exits is vital.  It's also good if you just let thebkiller find the hatch, as the extra speed boost for opening the gate is very nice.
---
I mean, can you blame people playing SWF? The teammates I get queued with when I solo are farm fresh potatoes.
---
Interesting facts. Thanks for sharing.
---
I haven‚Äôt either but that‚Äôs only because I turned off messages/communication from people not on my friends list. I figured what was the point to have it open if I got way more negative messages than positive messages.
---
I play both killer and survivors just because I think boat are really fun to play and I‚Äôm on the side with that people who are really good and perfect at communicating with op perks and swf does get annoying but I do understand why people do it since solo is so trash and I always end up getting someone who goes down in 10 seconds into the chase. Someone not doing any gens and when they do they blow it up. And the other people who don‚Äôt take you off the hook even tho their teammate is getting chased. That happened to I died on first hook
---
Yea, i realized it would've been better to actually detail it a bit. But yea, mine was a Yui she said I was gonna get banned for "farming with the killer" which I said wasn't even bannable if it was a farm match anways

Save up 1 million bloodpoints and then put all of it into one character. It should get you to the 30s range, maybe even 40s if you choose the cheapest route every single level.

I wouldve love it if BHVR implemented a system where if you're left on the ground too long without being healed/picked up by the killer for at least a minute or two minutes, you can choose to accelerate the bleed out timer.
---
Well normaly  your only supposed to get splinters  on killer that you dont have. But if you recently just got a killer you still could get splinters for it for awhile.

better remove the neck so we can have a pretty good job so far moment
---
It's a harsh balance. I play low tier killers at high ranks. When I vs groups of solos at my rank I usually have a strong advantage, when I vs swf at my rank i usually don't stand a chance. But it's no one's fault in either case, we're all just playing as well as we can, and yet the outcome is mostly determined in lobby. I can't blame swfs for wanting to play together and I can't blame ranking for putting me up against them because I keep beating solos.
---
Bhvr really just needs to go all out with buffing solo play and then balancing around that. Let survivors see the auras of gens being worked on at all times, make kindred baseline for all survivors, let survivors always see the recovery progress for dying survivors, etc etc. That's the only chance of balancing solo play and swf play.
---
Still better than the pellets in the past.
---
Thank you to all.
---
Strongly agree.
---
You'll never guess how long it took me to realize I spelt Spirit wrong.

Omea wa- Omea wa- Omea wa- Omea wa- Omea wa- Omea wa- Omea wa.................

Not sure what leveled gay up means.
---
This is so good, I can't believe you drew that loading screen logo, looks identical to the existing one! (:
---
Ojal√° y te la pasaste bien! :)
---
yea no...there's a reason it's not really meta in high level play and experienced killers would never run it if they want to actually maximize their builds.
---
It's a dead perk most of the game and doesn't come into play until it's too late. There are better Gen related, aura related, tracking, and even other insta-down perks that offer far more value than NOED a lot sooner.
---
I'm sorry that you actually think a perk like NOED is that good, but it kinda says a lot about your ability if you do.
---
I imagine if they messed with the perk menu we'd see a return of killers running bugged survivor perks like empathy.
---
Why is Dora there
---
honestly it catch my nerve at first xd 
---
and the end was satisfying as much as that hatch throw miss
---
overall the whole video just catch your nerve but one of the greatest escape i saw so far barely made it by last second good job
---
I didn't say it's bad, it's just not amazing or anything. It doesn't do anything up until the very end and even then it's not even clear since good teams always cleanse dull totems. Being tied to a Hex also makes it easily counterable when it's already activated.
---
The Survivor equivalent is Adrenaline since it's almost the same thing, but for the person running it. But a full team of Adrenaline users is way more devastating towards the Killer than NOED.
---
A perk that is so much better than it is Rancor. I mean it
---
1. gives you constant information during the ENTIRE match
---
2. isn't tied to a Hex and cannot be countered
---
3. has an additional effect of literally guaranteeing one kill after the exit gates are powered. Plus you can easily go for other Survivors after your free kill.
---
Yet nobody complains about it. The bad thing isn't the perk itself, but rather its users who tend to proxy camp and capitalize on overly altruistic Survivors.
---
What rank do you play at anyways? I rarely see people running NOED and if they do it's cleansed pretty quickly even outside of SWF. When I'm running it people just get super immersed either before if they get NOED vibes from me (Bubba, Doc, Legion and low rank Trappers are always contenders) or after one gets downed and even then I'm lucky to death hook that one without camping.
---
im sorry you leveled WHAT up?
---
Bet it tastes like maple bacon, yum
---
Imagine being salty with someone calling you out. Can‚Äôt tell by the downvotes most people think your as soft as 10ply

Who knew that I needed a Michael and Ski Mask collab tape
---
Ir you could click your mouse, from what I remember that works too xD
---
The Hatch doesn‚Äôt spawn closed until at least three gens are completed.
---
HOLY HELL THIS IS LEGENDARY!
---
Im just not doing the "hook 4 survivors in basement" or the "use NOED" challenges. They really just arent worth the stress of doing legitimately or taking the hate of then them in a toxic way. You can still finish each chapter and reach the end of the rift without then so I'm just not bothering with them.
---
That would also be fine as long as its unique to that. No generic Noise notification or anything.
---
Another possibility is they've burnt an offering "to play as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ killer", when they do use these offerings they don't have any perks or add-ons
---
Yes, it keeps showing that they have no perks after the game has ended.
---
Hope you reported that guy. There‚Äôs nothing that triggers a trash talker more than being banned from speaking at all
---
it means gay's bloodweb is broken and you're screwed if the teachable hasnt appeared at all even after reaching the minimum level requirement. Trt levelling up again and see if it works.
---
Same things happened to me in a bunch of matches today too. I thought it was the servers. You're saying it's the killers that can fuck with the lag? How so? I play on console btw
---
Who gives a shit about downvotes on reddit? lol. Are you serious?
---
It says it right there. 5 gens or Hatch.
---
I would love Commander Shepard but the odds of them ever getting in seen very unlikely.
---
that is probably the worst designed quest in all of archives
---
Okay boomer, Oof so trash
---
Me too on PS4! I didn‚Äôt know either but someone told me and it makes total sense!

Packing tools in his toolbox?
---
I am doing the exact same thing. Self Care / Dead Hard / Mettle of Man / Breakout. And a good Med Kit.
---
In 20 matches I got my Mettle around 6-9 times (didn't count) and got also tons of breakout saves.
---
I think Mettle is back in the game
---
Yeah, but it shows the killer you WOULD of played if not having the offering. So, for instance, I played Trapper and I put the offering for Freddy out, it would show me playing Trapper and the perks and add-ons I had for him just with the pink offering of Freddy, at the end to the other survivors.
---
I don‚Äôt get why people talk about ‚Äúgen rushing‚Äù on this game. It‚Äôs literally the only objective required to get out and win. WTF am I supposed to do? Ignore the single objective to give the killer free points?
---
If you dc fuck you. If you camp fuck you.  We all know how to play the game right so there is no excuse.  You have to be a real piece of shit to ruin someone‚Äôs rift challenge.
---
Maybe packing a lunch in his toolbox
---
Same thing happened to me when I levelled lesbian up.
---
Considering it shows how an overall group of people agree with you or disagree in this case obviously it‚Äôs a bunch of people thinking your soft or disagreeing with your post.
---
I see the packing tape on his left leg
---
And I‚Äôm supposed to give a shit what some dorks online think? lol. Ooookay.
---
It doesn't show your perks normally equipped, it does have the rather erroneous power of the original killer though.
---
I've been playing multiple Pig games to get her achievement (without buying her). So it shows up as "The Pig" with a chainsaw special power.
---
Wow wtffffffffff!!!! That's bullshit. They should get banned. And asked no sense for the killers to host the match.
---
False alarm, it‚Äôs just a gun
---
Yeah the controls are really rough and this is coming from someone who has 1300 hours in PC. That said I did manage to actually get 2 kills on Trapper on my first game but that was more down to trap placements than skill.
---
It jus me or does hitting on hook make the killer more punchable?
---
the ok boomer response makes no sense
---
Far more, this was my first hook too and I wasn‚Äôt even toxic in the earlier chases, sometimes killers just like to be toxic.
---
I just tried it and the controls will probably take some getting used to but I actually managed to score 2 kills on Trapper on my first game (on Yamaoka no less).
---
And then have the audacity to call you bad in endgame, when their MacDonald‚Äôs wifi carried them the whole game
---
I forgot to mention this Myers brought tombstone and face camped the Claudette when he missed his grab. I‚Äôm at rank 6 btw.
---
Was a perk where after taking 3 hits it would activate. 
---
Then if you got hit again while in the injured state you would not go into the dying state (on the ground) but be granted a 1 time extra hit, where you would glow white and then could run off and escape a killer depending when you used it. 
---
Then if you healed yourself 100% the killer could see your aura beyond 16meters, but there was a catch where people would only heal themselves 99% so it wouldn‚Äôt show that and if the killer was coming for you, you would just tap to full health. 
---
It was a extremely OP perk and saved many many countless survivors, especially with being able to take extra hits for rescuing someone when the gates were open and you had that camping killer or just trying to make it out the gates. 
---
So BhVR was going to rework it and they did where during the PTB (Player test build) you would need 3 safety unhooks or 3 protection tokens to get the perk activated. It was in my opinion a good ideal because everyone Including the devs knew protection hits were fucked and would not count allot of the time but with safe unhooks they did. 
---
2 weeks later At the last minute before the patch dropped after the PTB was done, BhVR then reworks it again, where it‚Äôs 3 protection hits only and made the perk total ass and worthless along with Ash‚Äôs other 2 perks. 
---
What they should have done was made it 4 safe unhooks or 2 protection hits to get it activated since trying to get 3 your just throwing the game and then also making sure it would count a protection hit. BhVR  even recently came out claiming they fixed protection hits and the scoring event for it because they knew along it was garbage and not working. They also added that you would be able to use the perk 2 times, which was a big slap to the communitys face.

There is some pretty heavy aim assist to be fair.

SCREW SURVIVORS WHO DONT BOOP MY SNOOT AND SCREW PIGS THAT DONT LET ME BOOP THE SNOOT.
---
As a survivor, its almost never a t-bag or BM at all. I'm not 12 and this isn't Halo. If it's inside the exit gate its probably offering up a courtesy hit. 300bp per survivor adds up.
---
Yeah, we should get rid of all the people that want to divide the playerbase! The game will be so much better off without them! Then the rest of us will be free to- 
---
Hey, wait a sec...
---
Dream state alarm clock?
---
Survivor: Oh better run, he‚Äôs teleporting to this hen
---
The Freddy: MY GOALS ARE BEYOND YOUR UNDERSTANDING
---
That's what I always thought a good change was
---
What about it is better? Just curious as a PS4 player.
---
I can't wait for the disconnect penalty. I'll at least get my 4 stacks of BBQ instead of 2-3 because they DC when getting caught immediately. And if they DC without caring about the ban, oh well, sure, less players in the game. But at the same time there will be less whiney entitled bitches playing this game.
---
So basically, because it isn't a perfect solution BHVR should just throw their hands up in the air and say "Guess we can't do anything!"
---
Here's  the bottom line, even if people end up suiciding on hook instead of just hitting the leave game button, that means in a worst case scenario, the same number of games are going to be ruined. 
---
&gt;There is no way to force somebody to stay in a match they don't want to be in
---
People shouldn't be joining games in the first place if they don't want to play. This mentality right here needs to die in a fire. Either accept that the lobby is going to have random elements you may or may not find favorable, or don't boot up the game in the first place.
---
&gt;It shouldn't risk Banning me if I've had a bunch of bad games in a row and I'm not having fun.
---
By your own logic you can just suicide on the hook instead of d/cing so it shouldn't be a problem. 
---
&gt;If I am stuck against a tree because they still haven't fixed that glitch
---
Glitches/Technical issues are the only things I have sympathy towards. Apparently this first round of testing was to help suss out how to deal with those. That being said, there is a reason the first 2 levels of the d/c penalty are fairly tame. Everybody gets 2 freebies before being locked out for a lengthy period of time. 
---
&gt; If I'm being trolled or griefed. If I'm being bullied or someone is being sniped.
---
All nebulous concepts, none that excuse d/c'ing and making the match worse for everyone else. 
---
&gt;Or if a teammate disconnects... You shouldn't be punished for staying in a lopsided match you know you're going to lose.
---
Again, if it really is so impossible then just throw yourself at the killer and suicide on the hook since that's the loophole you said everyone will take. Or maybe keep playing it out and see how it goes, rack up as much BP as you can and then make your exit.  
---
&gt;Mostly from streamers or content creators
---
Yea, most of these people I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them on this issue. Most of them want to be able to d/c freely to get into more entertaining games for their content creation. They have no concern for the actual health of the game of DBD, just how convenient it is to milk some money from showing off content to their fans.  So certain individuals will fight for the death to keep the ability to ruin games on demand by d/cing, because then they get to instantly move onto more content, and screw the other 4 people in the game they left. 
---
The 2 days we had the penalties active were absolutely golden. Only a handful of people actually d/c'd from my games. And while there were some first hook suicides, it was no where on the level of what I'm seeing before and after where people will leave the game just because it's a killer they don't like or they were the first ones down. There were actual motivations to play a game out even if you faced a strong possibility of losing.
---
In the end, no one is being forced to play DBD. But if they do voluntarily launch it, join a lobby and let that count down timer hit 0, and load into a match, then they're committed to playing it out till the end. It's been far too long where this entitled attitude of "If random strangers on the internet play characters/perks/items/add-ons I don't personally approve of then I'm leaving. Ditto if I just don't like the map or the offerings" has been the default for many people.
---
Just take out haddonfield as a map. It's terrible for killers. No one wants to play that map
---
*borrows dwights notepad and pen*
---
Fps, sensitivity, lags, connection, matchmaking time...
---
Rancor info is pretty weak. And it's 1-hit-mori can be used once, and only if the obsession lasts that long and doesn't just immediately leave. And yeah, a team of adrenaline is more powerful... But that's 4 perks, not 1. Plus, if the gens get finished, the killer loses anyway. Even a 12-hook 4-k won't stop the black pip. NOED is powerful because it's a bunch of downs just given to people, no questions asked, and never really gets countered (seriously, it's so rare that the totem ever pops, though I don't run it any more so I'm basing my assumptions off of solo-que survivor). It's like the 'give-up-button' of perks, anyone running it has accepted they aren't good enough to stand a chance and they just want an easy kill that banks off arrogant survivors. No good player runs it because it's a wasted perk slot that could have helped them against all but the sweatiest teams.
---
As for rank, I haven't played much this season so I'm not sure (haven't memorised the new system) but I usually hover around purple killer/low red survivor (probably gonna reach higher with the new rank bs, seriously I'm not that good I shouldn't be able to, why must behaviour muddy the stats). In Oceana as well, we get lots of sweaty 4-man swfs here. Used to be super hard to climb out of green ranks as killer because of the smurf teams, purple was actually easier till they fucked around with the rank system. 
---
Also I play a lot of legion, I have no idea why anyone would run NOED on them. I'll take your word for it, people do run stupid builds, but what the fuck? That's so pointless. It's like running NOED on huntress or plague. Nemesis/pwyf is so much better, even though it's two slots. (Legions hitbox is stupid large, pallets stun from a mile away.)
---
Controls feel better. Killers like the Nurse and Huntress feel way better, too. I'm not too familiar with PS4, but I was an Xbox dbd player for a while, and between the two the frame rate is way smoother on PC than Xbox. Aside from that also getting access to the PTB isn't bad either.
---
FUCK HUNTRESS PLEASE DONT THINK UR GOOD BECAUSE UR HITBOXES ARE ABSOLUTE FUCKING GARBAGE I KNOW THAT U KNOW THEYRE FUCKING TRASH FUCK OFF
---
I usually hit survivors when I hook them cause their screaming is really fucking loud and annoying. Hitting them shuts them up.
---
bhvr giving us a teaser of the new mode?
---
I‚Äôve been trying this too, but sometimes I take a hook hit and no MoM stack. It hurts my insides.
---
And 4 stacks of WGLF
---
When I was playing Demogorgon the other day (green ranks) I came across an apparent 3 stack of 2 semi-experienced survivors trying to teach their friend the game. Their fourth teammate tries to teabag me after pallet stunning me really early in the game and promptly slow-vaulted a window to get downed and then suicides on their first hook. Obviously with a teammate already dead and a baby Dwight that keeps running behind a wall and crouching every time he gets chased, they had no chance.
---
After I had them all slugged, I decided to be sporting and let the Dwight wiggle out and pick up his teammates. He seemed confused at first but seemed to get that I was friendly. I let them finish all the gens while I walked around the map, trying to get any bloodpoints from breaking pallets or whatever. The funniest thing is that every time I would patrol near the Dwight, he would get off the gen and stare at me as if he was caught with a hand in the cookie jar. I just nodded until he realized that it was fine and he kept working. Always warms my heart to see new players who are still so excited and terrified instead of all the brutally efficient 500 hour SWF stacks I usually get.
---
Combine it with nemesis and you will get a more broken NOED.
---
M1 killers? It was great for going against any killer. Injured and Billy chainsaw barreling at you? No worries take the hit.
---
Sam and Dean Winchester from Supernatural
---
Pretty neat
---
this isn't necessarily true. yes, in this specific situation they'd need to do 3 gens, but in general you need to do one more gen then the number of people alive. if you're the last person in the trial it always spawns.
---
the point is that hatch should not have spawned because there's two players left and no gens done.
---
Swf would destroy him
---
in case you wanted a real answer, one of the player's icons didn't update properly. one of them dc'ed (probably kicked because this game is great) but it doesn't display that. had something similar happen to me in a huntress game.
---
unless you know they were both still there bc then idk
---
And this is why more people need to run unbreakable
---
Yeah it's annoying - and it happens to me all the time.  Someone told me when you - for example - jump through a window and then suddenly you're back through like you hadn't jumped through it that's an example of them doing this!
---
Can‚Äôt we just play games and be happy?? Come on
---
Fucking props. I'm proud. If I can ask for tips, how the fuck did you do the achievement where you need to finish the gens and open the gates while you're the last survivor?
---
What does the Paranoid status effect do?

---
&gt; In the end, no one is being forced to play DBD. But if they do voluntarily launch it, join a lobby and let that count down timer hit 0, and load into a match, then they're committed to playing it out till the end.
---
DBD is a party game, this isn't like competitive CS, people don't want to play against bullshit, so they won't.
---
Underrated dad joke comment.
---
It's actually worse as survivor believe it or not.
---
lol nice
---
Use it or lose it
---
Can we please stop the NOED = adrenaline comparisons? You get a heal and sprint burst when you do the work for five gens. Doesn‚Äôt make a difference when you get one shot anyway. 96% of the time adrenaline doesn‚Äôt do anything tangible. 100% of the time NOED does massive tangible effects when it‚Äôs allowed to get procced.
---
serious question: why is jason not on dbd yet
---
I have :3
---
I know this is a super old comment but do you ha EA any recommendations for compatible controllers with this game?
---
It‚Äôs not in completion order, it‚Äôs just the way the trophies are listed.
---
True
---
survivor perk: when all your teammates are dead u teleport to the hatch, if the hatch is closed it will open.
---
Damnit I regret buying Gf. His power gets canceled so easily, How the do you even counter a 360 camera? During my gameplay as survivor, I was even able to ACCIDENTALLY cancel his power. Any advice on how to use bootleg Myers?
---
Imagine saying ‚Äúkys‚Äù to another human. Hope you reported them because that‚Äôs so not okay for another human being to say that to another human being.
---
She cool but Brenda takes my vote, she'd basically be a female David King mixed with some Dwight
---
I completely disagree. They are both end game perks and both dramatically change the game. Sure noed can counter adrenaline if the unlucky survivor being chased isn‚Äôt careful enough. Ultimately the game play mechanic of both perks is designed for 2nd chances. Not ever player has to use them but they help incredibly well.
---
Don‚Äôt say adrenaline doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs one of the top perks used in red ranks. Having 4 survivors go from injured to fully healed is a major kick to the gut and can pretty much can cost you the game. I‚Äôve had plenty of times playing both killer and survivor where noed is cleansed almost instantly and many times isn‚Äôt even activated. They are very much on equal level
---
Well, for one practice killer a lot, the killer adept achievements are rather difficult especially the low tier killer, wraith, doctor, trapper, hag, and the hardest to learn nurse. Mostly do the low,tier killers and nurse at low ranks, and let survivors go, try to get in as many hooks as you can 9 is the about for iridescent so go for other people and leave the hooks patrol gena, etc. Now also to get merciless you don't need to get all iridescent just 3 and a gold, chaser is the hardest to get so just hi as many survivors as you can. Now for survivors just don't go looking to be toxic do gens and heal, help and most importantly don't puss the killer off if you do that 1st lower ranks, your getting camped, just be careful, run spinechill, keys etc. Have a nice Christmas.
---
borrowed time
---
My teammates were running into the killer while she was carrying a survivor and getting downed and they worked on no gens, a rank 4 can only do so much lols

Adelaide Wilson from Us. The killer could also be Adelaide Wilson...

Good lord I hope not, its both terrifying and infuriating
---
As someone who isn't American, I'm not sure I understand this. Care to elaborate?
---
This is some next level shit.
---
Heather from Silent Hill, honestly.
---
The game can be more stressful and frustrating for Survivors at times and some just take it out on the Killer. Yeah, Survivors are more powerful than Killers, but when you‚Äòre solo queueing and the Killer won‚Äòt let you do your thing (which is what he‚Äòs supposed to do) it can get pretty unfulfilling quickly. If you get out just barely with all of your mates dying without any chance of saving them some feel like taking that frustration out on the Killer. It‚Äòs natural and occurs in many other games like fighting games or Dark Souls PVP where it‚Äòs very prevalent to be BMed after close/hard matches.
---
Oh yeah. No contest. But that's two perks.
---
depends how far you got/will get. If you got to the items you want from it, go for it
---
expletives can be a good way to communicate for some people, it just varies. I'm cool with it. and I feel you on that. that's shitty

wait to see when you dont like to play as killer yet you have to do a 4 sacrifice basement in 1 match
---
I love how Claudette is in the photo too
---
Oni is far better than legion but personally I find legion more fun.
---
Oni then Legion. I am a Legion main but Oni's perks are just a bit better imo
---
What an original idea, a killer who can disguise himself as a survivor!
---
ESP HACKING LOL
---
Awww, considering these are all the licenses killers, I would‚Äôve loved to see demo curled up at the foot of the bed.
---
imposible, the conditions for the hatcth to pop before endgame is have 1 repaired gen more than survivors alive left, so 2 survivors on that game, 3 gens repaired needed so the hatch spawn in the map, so the game just bugged

BT is necessary for saving people, every single time you've been immediately downed on unhook should remind you how fragile unhooked survivors are. I consider BT indispensable because of the plays that are possible with it for saving people.

Bill is probably NOT worth investing into as his teachables are kind ok at best except BT.

i got a better idea for us all: shutting the fuck up. nobody cares lol

Yeah... I am trying to ignore any "Kill people" challenges that don't give any lore or path ways to lore. These archives are way too grindy, because you are competing against people to get them done, so no way a good percentage of people could actually finish it all.

---
It‚Äôs still a free streamers for you nonetheless so it‚Äôs good even if you only rack 10k , it‚Äôll be 20k
---
I'm guessing that the huntress no longer had any hooks within the vicinity so he just dropped him ? But even so huntress was so sure of his victory that he let his guard down which cost him dearly .
---
Conversely if you die super early then itd worthless, i prefer getting them spread out rather than that one huge hit for that reason
---
It can be a breath of fresh air if you‚Äôve had terrible games all night and then you get a nice Killer who just wants to dick around. It‚Äôs even better if everyone can finish a challenge, too.

being gray rank is tough but youll get better bud

Worst part is that this guy at the end thinks he is being funny, when in reality he is just being an infuriating cunt

DC ‚Äòpunishment‚Äô will still not prevent them from DCing if they know that the killer needs 4 basement hooks :) how bout stop making challenges that require 4 basement hooks...with the same mentality the people who DC could run on the other side of the map far from basement and tbag....ive seen this happening...

Well yeah, you want to survive as long as possible to get the most points out of it. Though, some matches you‚Äôll likely have can be bad but it happens. The very few extra blood points is better than just the base at least
---
Honesty man, more people just need to learn how to loose. Taking your frustration out on someone is never good and isn't any kind of excuse.

"Killer won‚Äòt let you do your thing (which is what he‚Äòs supposed to do)"

I've been doing it as a killer for so long also, my point was *survivors* don't do it the same way killers can.
---
Gotta get those brown Medkits
---
oh my god

Rule 8 man

Just be nice to people or don‚Äôt reply back

Oh hey kayla

We wouldn‚Äôt have to if these toxic killers would quit hook rushing am I rite

He doesnt know either

You meant "your"

Serious legal issues over the ownership of Jason vorhees I think

AURIC CELLS CAN SUCK MY BATTLEPA$$ 
---
MONETIZATION IN THIS GAME IS ROTTEN DICKS
---
Pretty much what most others are saying. Leatherface SHOULD be the first killer you ever go for. BBQ&amp;C is the best perk to help reduce the grind, along with being able to track and see survivor auras from a distance is good.
---
Meg be looking like she about to ask me if I got it memorized
---
...yeah ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù fuel
---
There are plenty of survivors that know how to play against Spirits but that doesn't mean they enjoy matches against one. 
---
As boring as looping can be, it doesn't beat having to guess where the killer is most of the time during a chase.
---
He‚Äôs pretty bad man. Not very fun to play either. Feels way too clunky even on PC.
---
ive wanted something like this foreverrr. how am i supposed to buy an outfit if i cant even be sure itll look good first!!
---
I love to hit them all with a fat ‚ÄúK‚Äù until they stop
---
if the person you have unhooked doesn't take damage within a certain amount of time after unhook (i think it is around 10 seconds or something) you will get a safe unhook
---
NO, NO, NO! 
---
THE N WORD
---
NOOOOOO

Borrowed time, bond, spine chill, deja vu

Not even gray rank. Happens at purple and red too bud.

Lmao it actually kinda does, first time seeing it like that and now I love it
---
How do you play gen jockey or do you like taking all the aggro because i can recommend an ok solo queue build deliverance borrowed spine chill dead hard or adrenaline but as for gen jockey prove thyself spine chill detectives hunch just incase ruin or you could power through ruin its a good thing you can learn
---
Also what rank are you at?
---
Specs?
---
No that's just a little Dweet hiding in a locker
---
I once killed everyone as Freddy after two of their teammates DCed near the end of the game because they were acting like dickheads the whole game and I sat around in post game chat for two entire minutes watching them scream at me and tell me to kill myself repeatedly
---
*looks at Nurse*
---
No, we probably can't.
---
I don‚Äôt enjoy playing killer, that‚Äôs why I main survivor. I find killer really boring.
---
Agreed, because imagine if devour hope wasn't a hex perk.....
---
I always thought Mike weighed a ton and would probably break the bed.
---
yes,sorry, I'm on ps4
---
Thing you gotta realize as a killer is ‚ÄúThe entitled survivor rule book for killers‚Äù does exist and you can choose to obey it or not based off your own morals and how good or bad survivors play.
---
Personally I wouldn‚Äôt give a shit how the game is going, if I got a daily or challenge I‚Äôm trying to do, ima kill everyone.
---
The Killer‚Äôs job is to kill the survivors. There are no real rules against this 1 primary objective. If the survivors play like shit then it‚Äôs their own fault, of the same survivor continues to run into you after they‚Äôve been rescued then that‚Äôs their own fuck up (Known as tunneling)
---
If you hook a survivor knowing you were being fallowed by another survivor and you spend more than 10seconds around the hook looking for said survivors (This is called camping) right? Because not letting a survivor get rescued immediately after being hooked means your trash.
---
Play the game how you want to play and don‚Äôt let self righteous salty shit birds tell you how to play either side of the game. At the very least try to make the game fun for everyone without altering your style of play.
---
I mean there is a difference between bringing commodious + brand new part and doing gens with out it right?
---
ive never played him but since his changes 360'ing his 1-shot thing is way too easy, it feels like he never hits anybody with it
---
Bring balance to the console community not leave it in darkness!
---
I‚Äôm enjoying him well enough. I find myself attacking less with the dash, which was fun, but he feels alright now. It was pretty amusing to hit survivors around loops while it lasted.
---
A setting so you can turn off the exposed status effect? Are you thinking straight my guy? XD
---
Judas sandbagged him at the pallet.
---
He‚Äôs just a really bad version of billy now.
---
Oh, no, he definitely knows he's being an infuriating cunt. He's definitely one of those people
---
As long as the archives have bullshit, damn near impossible challenges like ‚Äúhit the Killer with 4 pallets in one game‚Äù or ‚Äúcatch a survivor 6 times in a bear trap in a single match‚Äù, then yes, people are going to farm.
---
Demo just like:O
---
And the killer's objective is to kill you, that doesn't mean survivors don't have 50,000 rules for how killers are supposed to do that
---
I've mostly noticed farming at the top ranks
---
so sick
---
I wish the basement would look different for each map
---
Oni‚Äôs perks are in the meta right now. But Oni was nerfed to the ground.
---
His ok, but he used to be like A tier, now I would put him in A tier cause he's kind of a shittier Billy. The only thing that made him really good was his flick, they essentially got rid of that so he's just very frustrating to play as tbh.
---
I apparently did not link to how I did this. Sorry.

Idk why you‚Äôre getting downvoted lol the saltiest kids are always the ones that get banned for being toxic in the first place

I had the same problem but did the challenge after 5 games like this. 
---
Is it possible that bodies of disconnected survivors can be used by killers? This would fix many issues such as challenges\\bbq stacks\\PGTW charge\\Dying light token etc.
---
You‚Äôre using a popular spongebob meme as an insult too. That make you a trendy fork that follows whatever everyone else does and says right?
---
Nice job
---
They‚Äôre playing a dangerous game, they‚Äôre breeding the next of many toxic killers. I‚Äôve stopped being nice and I tunnel if I get any sort of bm, I‚Äôm that petty now. üòÇ
---
Sometimes people want a fun easy game without bullshit. I dont mind a farming game sometimes. I'd prefer farming to the 3 games in a row where the killers facecamped, followed by 2 games of basement camping Billy which was a new one. Tonight was just killer after killer trying to make it the least fun least point scoring games in history.
---
OwO' WHY AM I EXPOSED ONI-CHAN?
---
I haven‚Äôt been playing long enough to know what the old DStrike was like. I joined a couple rank resets before Stranger things, so I can‚Äôt really judge that view. But I agreed that both have saved me many times. I like to think of them as rewards; although you might have ‚Äúfucked up‚Äù you did go all trial on 3 perks so you get a bonus.
---
Why do people never crop out the ‚Äúmade with memeatic‚Äù part? Just wondering
---
Some guy had his PsN bio thing as ‚ÄúPhone me when you get on my level‚Äù and he dced at the end cuz everyone was about to escape and I was like an inch away from getting out so I messaged him and asked why he dced cuz I was leaving and then said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay tho, message me when you get on my level‚Äù I felt pretty good about that one.
---
He‚Äôs the one that got away..
---
yeah there's a weird special effect when you get exposed and i know its there to give you a heart attack but it just makes the game freeze for me, im also on console.
---
People don't understand that by preventing killers from getting the challenge done, they are just forcing killers to continue playing like that.  They're fucking both the killer and themselves
---
why is this guy even being downvoted keys are broken lmfao (and i play both sides so are moris)
---
I usually play how I want given how I'm feeling as the match starts. If a "rule book" that was created by a PLAYER of the game, rather than actual rules put into the game by devs exists, you know for a fact I'm not going to pay attention to it. Sometimes I play nice and don't intentionally tunnel, I don't bother with camping cuz it only makes me loose points but other than that, I don't really give 2 craps about morals. We constantly see people on the survival side talk about how they like to get immersed into their games, and so do some killers and I know for a fact that none of the killers know anything about the concept of mercy.
---
Well unless you play the game 50% killer and 50% survivor, you‚Äôll always be a bit more of an ‚Äúx‚Äù main, since you‚Äôve mainly played more of that specific role
---
I didn‚Äôt know I needed this. But I did.
---
Ohhh that makes sense thanks lol
---
Played demo for first time and got spammed reported and banned, I know how you feel.
---
I mean, in farming games, survivors can get 32k points and die while killers can't get 32k without a 4k, and while it can be reduced to a 2k with only getting EGC hooks, getting 8 hooks in less than 3 or so minutes due to the timer's constant change in pace is nearly impossible without NOED or unless all survivors stay injured.
---
"Gen rushing" is absolutely a rediculous term. Survivors aren't doing anything wrong by trying to do their objective quickly. Truth be told, even as a killer main, I think survivors have every right to bring to a match what enables them to complete their sole objective efficiently. Those claiming it's somehow unsportsmanlike to use what's given to them are just being entitled.
---
That being said, the current balance where survivors feel they should bring everything to win and killers often feeling they need ruin to keep up isn't healthy for the game. Ideally either could be used without the other and not feel oppressive. But that's an issue with the game balance. Not the survivors it the killer.
---
Yeah, yeah, yea, we all heard the stories... My solution was to fire 33% of the cosmetics team and actually hire programmers, but there is no money in that right... Babies need them skins to pretend like they can play!
---
But in all actuality keep dressing flashy it's just makes me find you easier, you're paying them money so the killer has an easier time what's not to like!
---

It's boring to be mending/healing all game.
---
Why you sound fucking mad? Tf
---
Ok now this is epic
---
I‚Äôd rather get that kind of toxicity then survivors bragging and calling me trash cause their SWF group bullied me the whole time. You try to be to be a nice, fair killer and try and make it fun for everyone but play long enough with these assholes and you eventually stop caring about the other side.
---
Popped him out like a pimple
---
It's a personal preference, but if 80% of your gaming time is spent on DBD it's worth it IMO just for the improved performance, bigger playerbase, etc.
---
The question is what is a killer win... I consider it a win when I end with at least 1/3rd more BP then the best Survivor... or reach 32k.
---
Probably for the ok Boomer stuff.  I cringe so hard my asshole puckers up when I see one of you guys toss that around.  Honestly this thread in general got quite cringey really fast with all the weird "history of bm bragging" that this somehow turned into.  This thread really got away from me lol.  Hijacked by salty sea dogs bragging about the "glory days" when men knew how to talk shit properly in vidja games.
---
It‚Äôs hard to argue that a 4k is anything less than a win
---
I was really big on using premonition when I first started. I loved that damn perk. I would swivel my camera and hide any time it activated. Didn't make a lot of progress on gens but always hid from the killers. The first time a tier 1 Myers came up behind me without triggering premonition confused and terrified me.
---
She isn't bad, but she need at least a few quality perks inho. I wouldn't like her as much as I did if she didn't have Dying Light and Thanataphobia. You don't need Ruin running that.

---
For some reason on console any time you get a status effect on screen it freezes the game for like about a second. Within that second it will not register as you spamming the struggle option and kill you immediately if you're on second hook.
---
because no one fucking cares. Stop making everything about this game‚Äôs issues when we just want to chill and look at some memes.

I feel like you're just having trouble personally with him. Moving slightly left or right causes him to miss. Pre-release, yes he could curve like that, but now he just feels... jumbly.
---
All of these stupid challenges definitely increased my frustration and burnout level for the game simultaneously. Some of the harder ones I got lucky with but it was still hardly an enjoyable gameplay experience. Either indirectly sandbagging randoms to get a challenge done or begging my SWF to help, which they were nice enough to.
---
I'll probably avoid the next one unless the challenges are dramatically improved, it wasn't worth the headache for a couple of cosmetics.
---
What song?
---
For me its 2 types of killers: Those who say GG 
---
And: WTF GIVE ME EASY WIN TOXIC SWF THIS IS WHY MORI EXIST FUCK YOU ALL REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
The same way killers like to waste the survivors time. Force them out and stop bitching, how do you do anything IRL?
---
I get messages on xbox from salty braindead survivor mains everyday lol
---
Dont camp its lame, also if you camp just accept it and say fine i camped dont go on a rant about how its not bannable
---
I mean...watch Scottjund or ZubatLEL and you'll see 4k games for 8+ hours in a row live almost every stream.
---
Fungoose also streams those matches. Saying its cherry picking for youtube isn't true at all there are killers streaming 100+ 4ks in a row like Scott/Fun.
---
No, you're a pretty big cunt if you purposely go out of your way to deny someone from playing the game. But nah I bet it's so fun to stand still and watch someone on a hook
---
And most SWF have some worse than solo players, but coms and actual fun and laughter makes up for it. Solo feels like cancer, I'd rather have fun in discord with 3 brown ranks against red rank killers.
---
The game needs a nice overhaul in the emote, marking, and communication department...
---
I'd play solo a bunch if they showed it any love.
---
"Lol afk killer"
---
Yeah they should, but making a DC penalty when a survivor can just let go on the hook, it doesn't solve anything at all.
---
Survivor doesn't need a nerf. Solo needs to be evened out and made more communicative and fun. It would help A LOT with toxicity if everyone wasn't a fucking POS bot.
---
Sounds great, I like it
---
Dangit, so I might get it again?
---
Just leave the match. If i get tunnelled/camped 9 matches in a row on survivor and want to farm on killer, i'm gonna do it. Your disconnect won't make me upset. please, see yourself out.
---
Wait 'til you get one inside the exit gate. It's even better.

Game has a ranking system so you won't face experienced players
---
When did I say skins increased balance, the truth is the time before weekly skins, patches were far less frequent.
---
The cause of adding skins may not have had the had the effect of better balance. But it had the indirect effect of increase revenue to spend on other things
---
And BHVRs hirings have proved this ever since dead by daylight monetization restructured a year or two ago, they have hired several new programmers and other jobs like a lead writer (working on archives) more voice actors who aren't in house or freelancers and my personal favourite a lead animator.
---
So tell me that the game was better without it's ignorable weekly cosmetic drops, but know your doing it unjust and that firing all the people making cosmetics isn't realistic decision making in the slightest.
---
Honestly, mostly just about how many games you play. If you're good it will sleed it up, but ranking up to 1 is all about just playing as many games as you can before a reset.

I do love him referencing that book in this case, it shows me how little he understands the story... but yeah, it's all fun.

It would be dope to see how they would do it for, have it set up so he nearly dies of hypothermia but wakes in somewhere like the camp, plus his perks could be based around how he was in the film, set up to assist and warn fellow teammates about killers, hindering stealth base killers like t1 myers, ghostface, pig etc, kinda like how he tried to find out who was the thing in the film till the end.
---
Doctor Loomis could be based around the ending of Halloween 2 and what was supposed to happen, or just have it where the madman went in search of the entity to put himself in this madness. His perks could be based around trying to stop the killer, much like how he was in the movies, trying to stop the bloody plight of the boogeyman. I also just wanna get a gun so I can shout "I SOT HIM SIX TIMES!!.

*"Godamm cry baby, accept the fact that* ***when the game wasn't releasing weekly cosmetics*** *it wasn't any more balanced or bug free,* ***in fact it was much more buggier and much less balanced.****"*
---
Comprehensive reading and writing, can you do that? It's even your own text...
---
You do realise that the cosmetics are on the timed release right, they don't update the game every time, it's just a new release unlocked every week... it usually get uploaded with the main- and mid-season patches. If they would actually be updating the game even slightly every week we wouldn't be here talking because then it would at least be tweaked here and there!
---
Crutching with SWF, using OP survivor perks while bitching about OP killer perks, DCing to give a teammate insta hatch and deny the killer the points he deserves is also extremely cunty. Y'all aren't in a position to talk.
---
Was trying to learn huntress not too long ago, immediately after hooking a survivor another survivor unhooks him and I downed both. After that, the one who unhooked became upsetti spaghetti and dc‚Äôd which is when I got these messages while I finished the game. I was able to ‚Äúpib‚Äù despite his harrowing words.
---
Image context: This is the point where Ash remembers he got high with one of his one night stands and read out of the Necronomicon with her thus causing Evil to return
---
You sure about that? XD
---
She's effective, but boring. Survivors who don't cleanse against her turn themselves into No Mither gamers, but it also turns her into a powerless M1 killer.
---
Gotta get ready like a scout. Without the stupid patches. What I get is much better.
---
That's not one of the perks, but shut up or you'll be proud to feel my knife sliding through your ribcage.
---
There has to be a way to tell a true DC from an intentional one. Other online games have figured it out, and DBD needs it badly. I‚Äôm tired of people DCing because they‚Äôre angry or just want to be a dick.

Yeah I am aware , I'm not saying that cosmetic drops are updates you are so far past the point.
---
Let me put it in plain english
---
Cosmetics=Cash
---
Cash=More updates, better balance team, higher quality updates 
---
If your uncomfortable with paying for cosmetics, don't it really is ignorable and the game was like that before.
---
If you uncomfortable with BHVR receiving money, that's a whole other can of worms.
---
&gt;If they would actually be updating the game even slightly every week we wouldn't be here talking because then it would at least be tweaked here and there!
---
I don't think you dumb enough that releasing weekly balance updates is a good idea (because most of those decisions i'm sure would be knee jerk).
---
also tell me again how i'm down on my knees and ready to swallow BHVRs load... it gets me off.
---
Ah, so that's why I've never experienced this. My ass is firmly parked in the greens and there people always go for the save. Theymight let me hang until they finish a gen but they'll come for me. Sometimes they even go for a save from a face camper.

WHY THE FUCK ARE THERE VAULTS IF THEY DON‚ÄôT WORK LIKE I RAN AT IT AND HIT FAST VAULT AND I DIDNT EVEN GO THEOUGH TGE WINDOW I JUST PLAYED THE ANIMATION THEN GOT SMACKED BY A FUCKING HAG.

Legion has fun perks.
---
Lol i laughed so hard at his last classic response
---
 Play whatever you want. It's never easy to start a new game but you will get better eventually.
---
My pick for killers that are easy to start with are: Wraith, Canibal and Clown. Their powers are easy to use, but non of them is very strong killer. 
---
Try avoiding nurse because she is highest skill cap killer in  a game and takes enormous amount of time to learn her. 
---

I spent my entire day as a killer messaging everyone in my lobbies seeing if they needed help. The rift closes soon and the challenges will be gone.. For some people it seems hopeless to make it. Some people either play solo or just aren't that experienced (I'm talking about my ranks because its not very high) so they just can't do it. I personally would like to help those who need it because I know how hard it can be. If people don't need help I simply play normally. 
---
I understand how frustrating it can be to wanna play normally but some people do really need and appreciate the help. And why not? Normally the survivors make it out with more points in the end.
---
Really? Being exploited has it's grounds rooted in entitlement.
---
I'm worried about the fact that dumb idiots keep throwing money against a poorly balanced, badly produced game that isn't doing anything to actually earn said money or further clean up and develop it's software. Thereby giving the devs the idea that they are to big to fail and can just about do what they want... until it all blows up in their face and then the excuse will be why didn't the community warn us? But in order for the community to do something about it, the members of said community need to be banding together and it's sad to say the BDB community is nothing but whiny idiots that are so divided by their own squabbles that they can't see that they are put over a barrel on a regular basis and dry humped by the devs. Because every even remotely interesting topic is drowned in a see of Meme's and pretentious: "Look at how good I am" and "What I like" and such topics!
---
Then again, if the reference doesn't hold up it must be used "absurdly" or I think the word you where actually looking for was "ironically".
---
Things like that is why I wish there was a text chat or something to communicate when you can escape via hatch.
---
When there's a really bad situation with 2 survivors left and I know that this is a hatch game, and the other player gets hooked, I prefer to still go for the unhook than camp the hatch. I know that it's a bad idea but I feel like it's still better to at least try even though it feels like it's a smarter move to just camp the hatch. Dishonorable escape doesn't feel like a win, especially when the killer doesn't slug and nothing stops you from getting that unhook.
---
Rust. Haha I‚Äôve played all these games extensively. Rust is the worst.
---
It's not that I'm uncomfortable with paying for skins, it's the fact that more resources and time go into developing them then balancing the game and fixing issues that after more then a year are still into some of the platforms' live releases.
---
If they would actually fix issues that have been causing problems for a long time then I couldn't care 2 bits of a moldy shit what additional DLC and skins they poop out every week. It's the fact that they systematically hide behind skin releases to divert from the fact that they are doing piss poor job of fixing issues they created or never even fixed at all.
---
If you can't understand that, then that's a you problem together with the other... what 87% of the other idiots pooping out shitposts 24/7 on this sub.
---
I knew that I probably shouldn't have used the meme this way, but I didn't really care (/._.)/
---
U shall not pass !!
---
the dead hard timing oof!
---
Little bit off topic but that sweater is absolutely terrible. Probably the worst sweater of all.
---
I know. LOL  
---
  
---
That's my opinion on players who aim for the match to end with them escaping through hatch.
---
Myers lookin‚Äô fashionable
---
And what juke is that
---
Freddy is my main and for extra salt, use MYC and hook ppl next to a gen so you can teleport back and smash with the MYC once they get unhooked
---
The battle pass is so shit for this reason. I regret buying it and won't buy the next ones. Its such a waste of time and reduces overall fun in the game. Even if you ignore the challenges you'll run into other people who ensure the match isnt going to be fun so they can get challenges done.
---
Ah yes if I were the devs i'd simply cease all monetization and fix bugs because it's always that easy and what's best not only for the business and not the delusions of someone who just wants their needs to be catered too rather than any sort of reality.
---
And as a fan I should see it to organize and start the first player lead strike against a developer which has made plenty of ""controversial"" decisions such as not having the most optimized/balanced game ever made. 
---
Oh and let's rehability the community by getting rid of our dicksucker memes and  shitty balance suggestions. 
---
Will getting rid of those things fix anything? Are those things even possible? I say no, there will be no player strike.
---
Don't pretend like "there's a storm brewing" or that "if bhvr keeps up this behavior that'll be it for them" because it's not true. If Dead by Daylight continues in the state it is now we'll all be fine.
---
Good I'm glad you got "sick." It was a thread that I created about my experience, not yours. But for some reason, you think what I write must align with your way of thinking. Not Sorry snowflake. You're melting on my threads. Be sick all day, I know I'm feeling great :)
---
Isolation was great but Sega is, like, mentally deficient and expected a survival horror game based on the Alien IP to make Call of Duty money. I thought for a moment that OP meant the shitty sequel to Isolation that was a phone game.
---
? Baiting short lunge? 360? Wiggling left and right to activate short lunge autoaim?
---
There is plenty.
---
to be fair my friends and i (when we first started) chose claudette but now that ive been playing the game for over a year, i say meg or bill are great survivor choices (so is claudette)! they have wonderful perks :) 
---
for killer i‚Äôd say the easiest (for me) to start off with was the trapper! hes the fastest boi out of everyone and its fun to place traps around the map and think ‚Äúoh these are so obvious‚Äù but survivors tend to walk right in them! 
---
have fun! welcome to the fog gamer :)
---
How is it on laptop I'm more of a pc kinda guy and havent tried them.
---
None of those things work against a killer with half a braincell lol
---
Gens should take longer and ruin should ve nerfed...lets be honest here
---
I enjoyed it
---
Sometimes these meetings result in key openings!
---
Ok but I wasnt around to get any other of the items but got all of them expect for Hound and Pro Pain
---
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjTsQINzwl8)
---
The biggest mistake the devs made in all of this is making challenges that are entirely reliant on the cooperation of other players. Everyone has their own goals that are trying to be accomplished at varying times. This whole thing has become so frustrating.
---
They needed to implement this forever ago, also think they should just deduct bloodpoints from what you have every time they DC.

Once again let me say that the resources being put into cosmetics, are worth the resources BHVR receives from them. If the cosmetics actively made the game harder to develop they wouldn't make them at the rate they do. 
---
You can't really play the greed card either, i'm not gonna act like being a publicly visual and independently owned company absolves you of the possibility of corruption but every report on the count of BHVR has been squeaky clean since they left starbreeze back in 2017(?). 
---
and a cosmetic patch has never got in the way of a bug fix, in fact the opposite is true, remember halloween 2019? 
---
I get the reason for the systematic release of skins it generates a certain amount of hype for the cosmetics before release and creates the illusion of frequent new content ,how this practise disguises poor patching alludes me.
---
Your argument as I see it consists of "Bhvr deserved to be held accountable for there balancing and patching" but the evidence you provide to support your argument is timed skin releases and I do not see the correlation, you could take away all the skin stuff in the game and the patches would come out the same rate. 
---
Throw on "&gt;to fire 33% of the cosmetics team and actually hire programmers" which I just find to be stupid because you're losing a large source of revenue due to not making cosmetics and paying out Quebec pension plan, you'd be at a net loss in money that you'd have to recoup , that's not even mentioning the moral hit you just had from firing a third of your art team. Generally in Quebec any man you have is a man that's not at ubisoft it's a competitive scene out there.  
---
Bhvr aren't beyond criticism but there's very little hear that is worth criticizing.
---
Not as painful as the Massive Rez achievement on Overwatch. Lol
---
You‚Äôre right that it‚Äôs not against rules, but think of it like this:
---
Survivors waiting 10 mins + for a queue, have to wait more because someone dodged the lobby. They queue up again, 5 minutes in a ‚Äúconnection error‚Äù occurs, wait another 10 minutes. They get into a game, excited to try out their build, and boom, game ruined after they get caught because you want to camp. Any perk that isn‚Äôt DS, BT or exhaustion is now useless, and they have 0 enjoyment out of the ludicrous amount of time spent even finding a lobby, just for it to be ruined by someone with your caliber of playstyle.
---
It‚Äôs a problem because no other games you‚Äôve likely played are assymetrical. Your argument makes sense in a standard online game where everyone has access to the same resources and rules, but DbD is very different. You can just slug everyone and make the game a complete slog to play, and get survivors telling you how unfun it is, or a very tense and frighting match with jump scares, with very happy survivors telling you GG, all depends on how the killer plays.
---
Then they'll die waiting 2 minutes on the fucking floor
---
Had this happen to me last night, the person's name had the word 'salt' in it so knew it was coming lol
---
holy shit that was intense
---
You surprised him with your Christmas gift :D
---
Just imagine. One second of disbelief, and you wouldn't have made it. Damn, that's ass-clenching, good job! You don't really see actual scary content here :)
---
I really wish that I could record some things like that. I've had some situations like this that were so insane, still, they're lost, not ever shown to the public. Kind of sad if you ask me :)
---
Thanks !!!!
---
I had an escape yesterday against a Myers. Everyone else got killed and he closed the hatch. He stood and watched me as i opened the exit gate as a way of showing dominance. Right as the  gate opened i dead harded and he missed his swing. He downed me right before I was out but his tier 3 had him stuck in a longer animation and I managed to crawl out. That was super intense but not as cool as this post.
---
YEAH FUCK YOU FOR TRYING TO BE HELPFUL IN THIS COMMUNITY!
---
devs: *nerf ds*
---
also devs: hey look there's this new perk called Mettle of Man
---
For this reason alone I think hatch end game should be completly reworked. The best survivor should be the one who gets the 2nd chance, not the bigfest pussy.
---
Fucking wallhack, dude
---
I thought he mained bubba. He‚Äôs seriously the best survivor/killer player I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
I don't get it why are you being downvoted lmao, who tf is scared about the killer seeing your aura when you're probably have still 3 perks left that can save your ass
---
You know what, that's actually something I would pay for. Tell him he did a great job, because it's true. That's INSANE!
---
This exact thing happened to me against a myers. Fucked up my dead hard but still got out because of his increased cooldown in tier 3.
---
Looks great, you have fashionable taste!
---
Why‚Äôd they drop her?  Serves them right
---
The devs constantly have ridiculously hard BS for killers but not survivors. Like the hardest rift challenge for survivors is probably the 4 gen dark sense one, but if you do a 4 man SWF you can just organise so that you finish 4 gens. Nobody is going to help the killer sacrifice everyone in the basement and there's such a high percentage of pathetically immature people who play this game that you're almost guaranteed at least 1 person will DC is they think you're trying this, just like the will incarnate achievement with Myers. 
---
Look at the difference in difficulty between adept achievements for killer/survivor. I'm still trying to get adept Demogorgon, because his perks are garbage and even after rank reset the rank 10 survivors aren't so bad that they can't storm through a game without Ruin or PGTW
---
I play both killer and survivor.  I hate Legion. I hate playing against him.  I hate playing as him.  He's so boring and tedious to play against.  And I think he generates a lot of frustration I'm survivors.  His power is boring and not fun to play against at all.  The only killer i think was a waste of a killer slot.
---
triggered trash üòÇüòÇ
---
*killer has no hooks*
---
"my greatest escape" ... w.e the last second end game dead hard was pretty nice
---
You will always need money to keep your game optimized and it's never as simple as throwing money at a problem or doing it for free.
---
And the fanbase isn't minor were top 100 in steam probably the best selling horror game of all time , you act like bhvr making skins is them selling out and guess what it is and it's working!
---
I know the business plan is fine, consider this against all the big giants of asymmetrical horror DBD is the only one left standing...
---
Bad. He was so good and everything, but he‚Äôs a shitty billy that needs to wait for his power, which is worse at that. Stick tricks were the best thing about him, but we can‚Äôt even have that. Onto more Spirt gameplay I guess.
---
Fair enough I suppose, everyone has their preference. For me that killer is clown. He seems to suck the fun out of every game I play, and I gain no enjoyment from throwing bottled
---
God i wished man. I fucking wished. Not seeing this kinda freddy gameplay more often is what makes me go "right. This game is a sure lose" everytime its a freddy.
---
After seeing the scooby doo Supernatural episode..  I kinda think this could be possible. üëç
---
Don‚Äôt hit after blink if you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre going to successfully hit the survivor.
---
A laptop is a computer.
---
The space bar doesn't (or didn't) even work. I always had to use the mouth
---
What does tru3 have to do with this?
---
Just a lot of practice, took me awhile to get somewhat good, just by trying to blink exactly to gens you'll pick it up quite well, can't really give much tips, you'll get frustrated when all 4 escape 17 times in a row but you'll catch on sooner or later
---
The only improvement I see is that Freddy isn't here /s

Xbox queue times are definitely 10+ minutes, you‚Äôre a low rank survivor if yours is quick. But you don‚Äôt actually camp, what you‚Äôre saying is you proxy and deny cocky survivors of the unhook tech, which is very smart.

Wholesome, I had someone in my lobby with a boop the snoot gamer picture, so I switched to pig and let them boop their way to hatch. üéÉ

Yeah there are better perks. But it revolves around my playstyle perfectly so I almost never play without it
---
Nooo i don‚Äôt facecamp ü•∫ü•∫I use them as bait, I also play wraith, so no insidious, I did say that I don‚Äôt facecamp
---
It happens in every rank. Its really frustrating.
---
So in this movie (without any spoilers) the sex trafficking cartel goes to his ranch and he has this huge underground tunnels. And of course Rambo has these cool traps waiting for them. I thought it would be cool if we had the ranch with the underground tunnels as a map and Rambo as a survivor. It would be cool to see him as a Killer since the movie is very gory.
---
I've had the same experience so far. This challenge sucks.
---
For me I was somewhat intimidated by playing survivor so I went with trapper as was easiest in the skill sense according to the menu, survivor side I would either say try to be a camo Claudette, hides and can't be found sometimes due to her clothes and her perk self care can let you heal yourself, Dwight as everyone loves him, has a strong perk called bond, helps you locate teammates so it's easier for doing generators plus killer can go after anyone if it's two or more so you might not get chased
---
As a killer main: Please just leave so I can get into a new match. I don't care about 300-1200 BP, I just want to get into a new lobby.
---
I‚Äôm traveling right now and can‚Äôt play dead by daylight... &gt;:( wish I could‚Äôve stayed home
---
Lol, maybe next time don‚Äôt open with ‚ÄúCamping is NOT against the rules‚Äù. Proxy and bait hook techniques are very solid, and no good killer will just watch someone unhook, it‚Äôs always a good idea to keep pressure and mind gaming them. Good to see you‚Äôre making use of it, despite all the slander you‚Äôre getting.

---
They look so cute! I love pairing the school uniform top with the black skirt for claud.
---
I started with Nea because of urban evasion. For me starting out it felt better sometimes to be able to crouch walk around fast and feel more stealthy, but now i don't feel like i need it anymore. Just do what feels comfy to you and check out all the survivor's starting perks.
---
For Killer, I have a lot of fun with the Hag but she is not base game, so i think you might have a good time on wraith if you don't have any dlc.
---
Do you think he did this completely by hand or stenciled somehow? I only ask cause now I wanna do this but my drawing is shit üò≠
---
That's why I'm nice     sometimes.
---
The goal of the game is to kill the survivors and its not my job to make the games less toxic. I'm always nice in the end screen and I try not to camp or slug etc.. It's not on me to be super nice so the game is less toxic. I'm just a decent human beeing treating others normal. No flame no super Mr mc nice.
---
Haven't checked r/stabbygang yet ?
---
Solo survivor is boring and incredibly fucking frustrating. If people want to play with friends then theres nothing wrong with that, as long as they arent toxic assholes.
---
&gt;Your argument as I see it consists of "Bhvr deserved to be held accountable for there balancing and patching" but the evidence you provide to support your argument is timed skin releases and I do not see the correlation, you could take away all the skin stuff in the game and the patches would come out the same rate.
---
Maybe it would, but sadly we'll never know. alternatively if people weren't distracted every week by more skins they would notice how severely lacking the gameplay and optomalization is and would actually confront the devs about it. But since the appearance is upheld that every week they put effort into this game instead of once ever 6-8 weeks tops, most people not in the loop think that it's an ongoing patch fest as it should be, witch it isn't!
---
You're not going to make me believe that with the optimalisation being as shitty as it is now there aren't deliberate steps being made to not fix those? If BHVR actually had any respect for it's gamers some issues that have been going on since early this year would actually have been fixed already, but BHVR said they are on it and when asked when the fixes are coming the standard answer is always "We didn't give an exact date!" and then "Here are some more skin while you wait!" and 87% of the players now throwing a shitfit about it are the types of people that fall for it!
---
So in the end it's only logic that you're angry and pissy about it, because ultimately you make it about you not about the game, because you recognize yourself as the problem and not the solution to the whole issue!
---
thanks i will try that out
---
No, Wake Up is definitely trash. It's one of the hottest garbage in the game, beaten by only a few worse perks. This is coming from a Quentin main since his DLC released years ago.
---
You spend an entire perk slot just to be able to see the icon of the gates... when the game itself reveals the location of the gates for you for free. If you were a totally new baby player, then it could be good - but it's a perk locked behind a licenced survivor, so it's hard for new players to even get it before they become somewhat sentient in how to play the game. 
---
Keeping track of the exit gates is just using your eyes. Look for the bubbles, then run to the bubbles.
---
And on top of that... it's secondary effect only saves you 3 seconds... for a 20-second action. Fuuuck how can you say that is worth a perk slot? You spend an entire game with dead weight, just for a CHANCE to be first at an exit gate that you might never reach to... just to open it 3 seconds faster. Like holy shit, this perk is bad.
---
Wow he s a fax machine !
---
The hatch can spawn closed after a number of different circumstances, not just 3 gens and a kill. The moment the number of generators completed is ONE higher than the number of survivors still alive then the hatch spawns. Either by kill or gen completion. It will spawn closed when all 5 are done and all 4 still alive
---
I mostly agree but for what reason is legion above billy I imagine billy would be far stronger then a teenage boy
---
Maybe because he already hit you with Frenzy.
---
Most legions hit a survivor with Frenzy then leave.
---
Here's my upvote sir
---
ok the person on the left is just downright a subhuman.
---
Evan, are you gonna be caring just like your father ?
---
That I need in my life
---
I think the emblem system for survivors should prioritise more on the chase. From that point the end game should be a battle between the killer and thr survivor who comes out on top. I need to day dream a bit longer to figure out how that would look like.
---
No, Doctor is garbage at higher ranks, he lacks map pressure and his power is inconsistent during chases
---
Guess I was lucky to complete 4th chapter as killer within first 3 hours. No luck for survivor side though - stuck on dark sense challenge for a week now
---
Been a lot of trash games today. Do t take it personally.
---
I will say the learning curve as survivor is hard. You can feel like you're being funneled and killed quickly but that's probably because you just don't know how to hide yourself effectively and move stealthily.
---
You'll get there you just have to stick with it. Early games can be frustrating... üëç
---
Be unpredictable and try guess where the survivor is going to be, instead of where they are
---
I enjoy playing against Legion ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Everyone is talking about how you should buy an external mouse and keyboard - don‚Äôt. The mousepad is fine for this game and just code a macro for wiggle and struggle!
---
You'd get destroyed with no ruin
---
I ususally find the hatch myself, or they find it and I get downed with NOED and mori'd. Not once have I had a Killer take me to hatch.Yet as a Killer I help them find hatch
---
Why report her though? What else was she supposed to do
---
Meg is my least played lady so I don't really have anything for her besides one or the shorter hair and the white skirt lol.
---
Thank you to all the survivors that disconnected, the killers that shat all over me immediately at the beginning of a game, and all the other reasons it took so dang long to finish Tome 1. Merry Christmas and May all your undone challenges be finished quickly.
---
Yeah I had some guy in my party who player killer and survivor the other day. We were swf and he was disconnecting as a tactic using the NAT to get around any issues. In all the matches I played with him, he disconnected and of course it's because everyone else was at fault.
---
No one wants to risk themselves for a toxic douche whose only addition to the team is to whine and look our for themselves.

There‚Äôs also r/dbdgonegay if that‚Äôs your thing lmao
---
How is clicking a flashlight to get the killers attention (because you're at rank 4 and you know your rank 12, 13, and 20 teammates will die immediately), being toxic?? I think you're just an asshole camper.
---
Typically Claudette.. sure she is the one fully hidden
---
Killers can also make survivors depip by camping and tunneling any of the survivors. Yesterday my friend ran an Oni for 4 gens, the Oni didn‚Äôt see me the whole game, I escaped and depipped. My point is the ranking system sucks
---
When I click the bug report link it just shoots me to the reddit search bar on mobile
---
The killer dropped them and let them escape....did we watch the same video?
---
David and Ricardo can pick me up any day with their strong arms any day üò©üëå
---
It's tragic that the hardest part of these challenges isn't doing them, it's finding opponents who won't actively saboutage them even at the expense of their own game.
---
Thank you guys!
---
When will people understand camping and tunneling is not against the rules?
---
If you give a gun to a man and he uses it for a robbery, did the robbery happened for your fault or for that man's fault?
---
The real reason Killers run Sloppy Butcher
---
:( Good luck, man! I hope you get the challenge done. If I were high enough rank I'd throw for you to get it but I'm only rank 18 ü•î
---
This exactly. Challenges are counter productive in this type of game. The challenges need a complete overhaul
---
I nominate scrappy doo as the next killer then
---
How was he stuck on that for so long, I found it really easy
---
Nurse is still the strongest killer, people will probably argue but they're just keeping up appearances in the tyrade to get her returned to ridiculously broken status.
---
Spirit is still a very strong killer, she just got a moderate nerf but not to any of the stuff that really makes her frustrating to go against. Chuck Stridor on her and that's a free win.
---
Billy and Freddy are both consistently strong killers with high mobility, but play more normally than the other two.
---
After one or two pallet stuns the killers would absolutely respect pallets and wouldn't try to swing through them
---
I got lucky with this one. It‚Äôs the fucking survivor challenges I‚Äôm having trouble with. Lol
---
You can actually do it yourself, try looking for on youtube
---
You can also try the Spasmodic Breath add on which removes your power for 60 seconds on a successful blink strike, but raises your speed to normal killer speed.
---
It isn't *strong,* but it can decrease your reliance on blink attacks while you're still learning and give you an opportunity to perform a bit better while you practice.
---
Thanks for crediting me

---
Who was the killer?
---
The way some killers just looked so shocked when they trigger endurance out of nowhere kills me. They come into post game chat like ‚ÄúYou absolute madlad‚Äù
---
What that was dead easy. I did it first try after the rework had just been released
---
"C'mere, Dwight, I'll take you to ha- Stop wiggling. S- Stop wigg- Oh, okay, I guess you can fi- Oh, you're teabagging as you jump into the hatch... Man..."
---
LoL thx.
---
Thought that was KSI for a second lol.
---
&gt; being hit first out of all four survivors (which is truly unfair don't you think so?)
---
If every single Survivor had that mentality, the first person you find as a Killer DCs every match. Oh joy.
---
200% accurate
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
No he didn't :/
---
Merry Oinkmas and a Piggy new year
---
Okay
---
Honestly no. If NOED hasn't yet revealed I don't take free slaps outside of the exit threshhold. If it has, there's nothing to worry about, but i'll still wait by the threshhold. It's just easier to get yourself in position that way.
---
thanks
---
Once upon a time, this was the strongest, most broken perk in the game
---
From my experience Playstation ALWAYS reacts to reports. It's very strange to see these kind of messages on PSN. You don't want to ban yourself from an account where you have all your games and progress.
---
What is this list based off? I‚Äôm Physical strength or powers or??
---
Yeah, it's a side effect of them fixing stepping in your own traps that you just placed, which was a "new" bug with dedicated servers. No idea how they managed to bug in an infinite loop, but hopefully they know about it and will fix it soon.
---
Same bro. Just letting them run to the hatch while chasing them to get some points extra. But in the end letting them escape gives a nice feeling.
---
Claudette looks super cute too!
---
I just downloaded it through an app called Tap. It's actually not half bad but the controls are strange of you've only played K&amp;M like me, and skillchecks are really tough especially with Ruin. That being said once you get the controls down you'll be looping like normal as survivor and mindgaming with killer with few issues.
---
Not a fan of having to play the killers/survivors to get their perks though. Having to play 30 games of Nurse for NC is going to be hella rough. That being said I'm just playing it because I'm away from home for a few days and for what it is it's about as close as you can get to the real deal. Maps are nearly identical too down to the bullshit Matt Walker windows on Rancid Abbatoir.
---
Nope. That being said they give you a truckload of Iri shards to start out and a few hours of play nets you enough to buy a killer or survivor free. I don't see myself dropping the money I've dropped on PC all over again for this though. Might pick up Feng and Spirit and just play those when I'm away from home or whatever.
---
i find this to be true when i tried it on the switch
---
Fortunately not everyone is a spineless selfish creature
---
I disagree.
---
For one, you say challenges shouldn't make you go out of your way for them. Well then how are they challenges? I like a little bit of difficulty, and it's far superior to the 75% of challenges that are just tedious "do a lot of gens," "get a lot of bloodpoints," "hit survivors." They just feel like filler when they couldn't think of anything.
---
However, I don't like that challenges like 6 feet under are so easily saboutaged by the other team. Dark Senses and Chilling Escape both depend on your performance, especially if you give your team the heads up in the pregame.
---
You also then say you liked Decisive Light, which to me is something I have to go out of the way for. I have to follow the killer around with a torch, wasting the teams time on something that is almost certainly not going to be a save. Worse is when I'm playing survivor and I have to deal with multiple teammates doing that. At least for Dark Senses they actually contribute to the team.
---
Personally I'm far more inclined to enjoy challenges that involve taking different perk builds and playing wit ha goal in mind over the masses of boring grind they had this time.
---
Insult to injury mobile also gets all that shit too.
---
As I said there are many lovely survivors which are very friendly and nice in the post game chat. Was just the first thing I thought about since many survivors are really grateful if you let them go in a shitty game while some get really toxic afterwards if you decide to not let them off the hook easy.
---
I find legion incredibly boring to play against and most time won‚Äôt try really try to play
---
Just like this dude said it‚Äôs probably the ok boomer remark plus being petty reddit ain‚Äôt to keen on it.
---
My Xbox died at the beginning of the month. I got a new one for Christmas, played three games today and each one of them had at least one survivor being a dick
---
Unarmed David King v all legion members at the same time with knives and i‚Äôm picking David everytime.
---
The downside is you can't modify your loadout in a lobby whatsoever. Even as killer. Killer doesn't even get to see survivor perks, just how many they are running.
---
The mutated scrappy
---
But it‚Äôs not Christmas anymore
---
Cool, give me a free sac after healing too, it's sacrifice points
---
I'm a survivor main just because I enjoy the thrill of being chased, and I've never been really good at killer no matter how much time I put into it. However, I still put in the time because you learn invaluable things when you play both sides equally.
---
Playing against increasingly harder opponents is how you learn the game. And it isn't the end of the world if you depip and have to go back a level. It just means you have a little more to learn until you can steadily reach that next rank
---
It takes literal seconds for me to get a survivor game in mobile. That being said, no reason to dodge unless someone is running something truly troll like No Mither.
---
Killer is a little longer but not much. About 2 or 3 minutes tops.
---
Shhhhh
---
That would‚Äôve been crazy if you had Clown‚Äôs Santa Claus outfit. Just a fun memey match :D
---
Tbf if you are coninually hiding and putting pressure on one player that sucks too
---
I feel the same. The charms are worthless and barely noticeable. The cosmetics have been ok, though often for survivors/killers I have little interest in.
---
However none of it has been worth the hassle of the challenges. I just want to play to escape as survivor. I don‚Äôt want to mess about flashlight blinding the killer all the time  or because that‚Äôs not how I play. As killer I found myself just farming the challenges with survivors because it was a guaranteed way to get say X survivors in traps rather than trying to sweat it out.
---
I just want to play to escape and kill and the challenges are too distracting. I‚Äôll be skipping the next battle pass for sure.
---
Now if they made ALL challenges obtainable from the get-go without having to select a specific one that might have helped. Because then you would unlock half the challenges while playing rather than going into the game to force it.
---
Tutorial gives BP and shards but not XP. Each survivor and killer has personal XP you get by playing them. It's about 1 level per match unless you hard carry and then it's like 2.
---
People forget that, even though the game is killer vs. survivor, the community doesn't have to be. It's gotten to the point where you can't make a legitimate complaint about a mechanic for either side without someone having to butt in like 'okay, that mechanic's bad for us but somehow it's okay when survivors/killers use it?'. I just want to enjoy some DBD memes and threads talking about game mechanics without it devolving into a mud-slinging competition.
---
The game is already not scary, let's focus on gameplay mechanics rather than atmosphere because the devs already said they want things as they are.
---
Didn't even realize I guess so lol.
---
I don;t think Michael should be put in the same category as Oni, Huntress or LF. Same with Demo. Both should be higher.
---
Wasn't Michael like pure evil?
---
Now I want Lady Gaga's hair cosmetic for Spirit.
---
Whenever the gates are open, survivors aren't leaving and I am not at the gate, I just go AFK make tea, take a shit or get a snack or whatever.
---
I couldn't care less about them teabagging me at the gate and being sooo generous "giving me a hit" when I already usually max that category in the game anyway. If they want to waste time,be my guest.
---
I‚Äôd say your list is pretty close.
---
Killers on the 2nd and 3rd rows could be mixed around.
---
You have to play one trial as Dwight or Meg to unlock Claudette. Same with Trapper to unlock Hillbilly.
---
Thats just something his doctor described him as, there isnt really a clear definition/ description of michael. Regardless, pure evil or not he isnt much stronger then the others and fits in that category in my opinion.
---
Eh not useless, they're just for add-ons and offerings. Depending on what killer you play they can feel useless for sure. Pig isn't add-on dependant so for you, ya probably.
---
Even with NOED they just position themselves in a way that they fall through the exit when you hit them. 
---
I would actually really love it if they changed this, so that you cannot crawl through the exit games automatically as soon as you get downed. Set a delay so that the killer has a chance to pick you up when he downs you, honestly wouldn't affect normal gameplay 90% of the time,just punish those cocky time wasters that teabag 1cm away from the exit.
---
5head ass nea
---
I had a team in solo queue actually 99% the last gen then come find me to get it done
---
it was incredible
---
I‚Äôve actually found that there‚Äôs a lot of people willing to help out with the tome challenges if you just ask in lobby
---
Instead of builds, learn how to use the ambush on loops. It‚Äôs nasty and has some mind games to it as well. 
---
As for a build, using M&amp;A with Whispers makes it so your terror radius is smaller than the Whispers  activation range, so when approaching a gen you can crouch as soon as Whispers triggers. This will effective make you able to approach gens without survivors hearing the TR at all, but you HAVE to crouch as soon as Whispers goes off.
---
I would make it a Offering and what it does is randomly lag killers back so they don‚Äôt get hit when they swing plus when survivors go to vault windows they can get stuck like they are lagging at a random chance plus it takes off all the survivors hair and randomly makes them fly and get speed boosts
---
Oh this sounds so good I love monitor! Thank you for addons is the one where they dont see boxes until the trap is activated any good?
---
Do the bonus blood points actually stack ot not?
---
This literally happened to me yesterday.
---
Purple ranks generally are more or less where the game is balanced really well. You feel like you can get good games with killers, not 4K all the way but fair games where survivors actually know what to do but sometimes make a mistake or you manage to outsmart them. And for survivors, everything you said. 
---
Anything below is survivor hell where you get 4K'd because dumbasses DC or get caught in a single pallet, killer camps and 2 survivors crouch at the hook waiting for him to leave. Anything above is killer hell where red rank SWFs with 2000 hours on this game do 3 gens in 2 minutes, know every single god loop on the map and then teabag you as they leave.
---
That would soooo cool. We should start a poll
---
Oh alright makes sense it does sound very immersive I love it! Exactly what I was looking for! The looping mindgames I can try learn but I dont reckon I have time:( thank you though I appreciate all tips
---
I had a guy literally avoid every single pallet stun on purpose when I was doing that one because I put it in my steam name
---
I got him again the next game and he was doing it again so I just pointed at a hook so I could move into a lobby without him but he took pity on me and let me have it lol
---
Doctor is one of the worst killers, my dude. He's only good at countering stealth, he has no chase options or pressure
---
It's fucking annoying.
---
Feng being put on the hook is literal ear rape
---
Clean af grab
---
Assuming Michael and Jedidiah are from their respective movies, both of them got big buffs from the entity. Nick Castle is 6‚Äô1 and Gunnar Hansen is 6‚Äô4, both killers tower way over that ingame. Also Michael is a tricky one since in the previous timeline he was supernatural and powerful from the start, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case anymore. Legion is tricky too, are we factoring in the other 3, or only Frank? Iirc I don‚Äôt think GF wasn‚Äôt given any powers or anything, just his regular self. Doctor managed to kill or incapacitate all prisoners and patients in L√©ry‚Äôs, that takes a good amount of strength to accomplish. Unless he was helped by the entity like the nurse and hag.
---
Can Scooby Doo be survivor.... Ruh oh rets roo renerators . Roh reh riller rrroming....
---
I feel called out.
---
Ricardo perks.
---
You Got That: 
---
- Press the¬†Active Ability¬†button while standing still to begin dancing.
---
- During the dance, you avoid damage.
---
- Causes the¬†Exhausted status Effect for 60/50/40 seconds.
---
- You Got That cannot be used while¬†Exhausted.
---
- You do not recover from¬†Exhaustion¬†while running.
---
I don‚Äôt get why you single susie out as being the weak one? The point of ‚ÄòDarkness among us‚Äô is that anyone can be a strong merciless serial killer
---
I think I was in that one game when the other guy disconnected. I felt so sorry
---
I havent played pig myself but I feel like Sloppy and thanat would slow the game down big time especially when you consider people will waste time getting the reverse bear trap off and atill have to heal after
---
This would be amazing if there was some kind of a token power up. For example lose the killer in a chase - you get one token. Then you get the dance that makes you untouchable for 10 seconds (which you can interrupt at any moment to get the Borrowed Time effect for another 10 seconds) if you have say 3 tokens.
---
Same, this feels a bit too colorful and not as fitting for the game.
---
Exactly, and give deviousness points for that
---
I don‚Äòt think the trapper got stenghtened (or whatever)
---
Username checks out lol. And yeah I mean she is the smallest in the group and in the lore, all 3 were willing to kill the man, Susie refused to and Frank needed to hold the knife over her hands and pushed them down in order for her to join in. Shes the smallest and least aggressive one in the group
---
Yet here you are.
---
*sandbaging intensifies *
---
Watch trapper's cinematic and how much smaller he is. Hes got spikes sticking out of his back ingame and doesnt affect him at all, hes easily been strengthened
---
Challenge should be "Sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement; OR sacrifice 3 survivors by DC"
---
I counted it as just frank, I assumed billy would have been strengthened greatly by the entity, seeing how he'd be tiny considering he was locked up in a small room with not much food for a long time.
---
Yeah, thanks.
---
To get more points? I literally gave you the reason. Cleanse totems, sabotage traps/hooks, search through chests, be altruistic, all of these give you MORE POINTS. That is the game. Rushing gens without anything else gives you less points for the game than doing all of the above.
---
So then you are getting carried at your current rank, right?
---
Its hard to know just how strong he is but he can lift people with one arm and break down doors and shit. Not very different from what he already does in the game
---
Thought killer could see my aura when exposed
---
He's done much more notable stuff in the sequels, survive an explosion, multiple bullet wounds, shot twice in the face, impaled a guy with a shotgun etc.
---
Lol I‚Äôm not mad, he‚Äôs one of my friends and we were playing together when I wrote that
---
Oh, yeah. Definitely not a balanced idea, it should never make it into the game. Just fits best with the memey idea of breaking then fixing something
---
Like I said.. when someone is hooked, sure. Unhook, heal, etc. But until that happens why would you do anything but gens? And you can‚Äôt force the killer to chase you. Once you loop some killers and they realize they‚Äôre not going to hit you they‚Äôll ignore you completely.
---
I can tell you theres not much of a difference in rank 10 survs and rank 18s, but yes matchmaking is just broken im rank 1 killer and sometimes get yellow rank lobbies.
---
Personally think trapper because catching someone makes you feel like big brain
---
Or doctor because samination makes me think of doctor hibert every time he giggles
---
Just make it require more stacks
---
I always figured the entity was drawn to the cannibal shack/Lisa's suffering, and as she died drawing the symbol the entity grabbed her and made her into the Hag, which then tore through the entire shack.
---
Fine isn't good enough
---
I hope they get soft bans, some persons are just.. . . .  .
---
I see that yeah pig does lack lethality. With the classic nurses too might nasty

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/efvcd8/when_the_google_store_page_for_the_game_is_just/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Not really. All killers can counter looping if you mindgame successfully. Facecamping needs specific perks to counter
---
If you feel like you need ruin at rank 13 youre doing something wrong, i went from rank 20 to rank 1 in 2 weeks with ghostface with the perks sloppy butcher and his 3 own perks. You have to pressure people off gens and not chase them if they go to a good loop (not always though, you just know it when you shouldnt chase)
---
Ah yes my random teammates
---
did all of the Dark Sense challenges first try, can‚Äôt relate
---
I'm not sure forcing everyone to get into chases just for the sake of chases for their emblems is a good idea, I've had someone in my 2-man throw matches over pallet Archives for just that purpose.
---
On the other hand, reworking the emblems in general for both sides might be nice? If you want to double-pip in red ranks you need 3 iris and 1 gold (15 score points, which is 1 for bronze, up to 4 for iri); but if you loop the killer long enough to get Iri evader (and then get a gold unbroken if you escape), you're not going to have enough time to Iri benevolence and Iri objective because most of the gens will be done and the killer won't have time for more hooks.
---
Even just single pipping is 12 points (4 golds), there is a lot of shit that can ruin this; someone else loops the killer instead of you? The hooks happen across the map and someone reaches them first? You have to play hyper-aggressive and neglect generators/go totem hunting/purposefully aggro the killer for absolutely no reason if you don't get found naturally (and sometimes even then so you aggro them near a better loop) and abandon everything to sprint across the map for at least unhook and a few heals.
---
It's pretty ridiculous to play like that, it's getting to the point that even being hooked doesn't bother me unless I instantly went down (or I'm left to sit on the hook for a million years, admittedly, since that's wasted time I need to be using on something for emblems).
---
I use bond, it helped
---
WrAitH
---
Nah because I spend 90% of my games *not* needing to camp anyone because most people know how to act like decent human beings. And clicking the flashlight when you're next to or behind a killer who doesn't know you're there to make them chase you is one thing. Doing it literally every time you jump over a window or pallet is not to get their attention, *that's* what makes someone a toxic asshole. I think you get camped a lot for being a dick to killers and want to justify because it's ok if you're toxic right? Fuck the killers who get mad at you being toxic and give you a taste of your own medicine right? You're the only one allowed to be a dick and have fun right? Lmao get that trash outta here
---
It sucks, I‚Äôve started playing hag and realized very quickly that she really benefits from a toxic campy style of play. It‚Äôs crappy.
---
But if they're sitting there concentrating on you, why counter it? It's like flawless looping with no buttons being pressed. 
---
Looping leads to distracting killers. 
---
Facecamping leads to distracted killers.
---
Dude you are the guy! Thank you so much for those killer portraits!
---
The game is scary as fuck when a blendette drops a pallet on your face outa nowhere
---
Idk about consoles, but you can do it in PC/Steam by just checking their profiles if they are connected somehow. It just takes time
---
With some coordination between 2 people you can stop facecamping unless ita bubba. 1 person runs in takes a hit and then runs away and while killer is recovering from the hit the 2nd person gets the save
---
I only watched 3 episodes of it lol.
---
You sure its not.. John Cena?
---
Hella cute
---
Correction, for the purposes of pipping, the meter is divided into 16 point slots.
---
Bronzes are worth 1 point.
---
Silvers are worth 2 points.
---
Golds are worth 3 points.
---
Iridescents are worth 4 points.
---
At (red) rank 3 (where I am now):
---
Safety pipping is 9 points (3 golds, 1 empty).
---
Pipping once is 12 points (4 golds).
---
It's only double pipping with 15 points that needs Iri emblems.
---
I love how this has been in the game for so long now. If it was a survivor releasing themselves, then getting stuck again, it would be fixed immediately.
---
Makes sense ... In the movie fate smiled upon her soooo many times.She could've been killed right at the start but she was pretty smart.i would like to see her in game.I was thinking something like having a 50% chance to get out of a hook or maybe counter the killers mori in some way.
---
Confused tbh.
---
I love the jingle sounds when you pick them up and carry them to hooks :3
---
I agree swf is inherently broken surely for the fact of the perks it frees up you get at least 3 global informational perks just for being in a group.  But most games that I‚Äôve played that have a ranked system allow groups.  Honestly if they just added like a 1.5 bp modifier for playing against swf I‚Äôd be content.
---
I got a warning for sending a "fuck you" to a bunch of teamkillers in R6. Not a slur, hate speech, nothing. Just a regular old "fuck you".
---
If hes winning It shouldnt be a Big problem imo
---
WrAiTh iS tOp 3 BeCauSe I FaCe poTaToEs.
---
It's like nobody in this sub can laugh.
---
When you consider that most of those require downs/hooks or only trigger under certain conditions/for certain generators, and that if you so much as injure a survivor they get about 30 (closer to 28) seconds of distance on a 115% M1 killer.
---
And that this M1 killer, on top of having to find this first survivor, chase them into hitting range, hit them and then chase them long enough for even a simple toolbox (without repair perks) to repair a generator halfway just to hope to get another hit then; and then however much was repaired before they found a survivor and managed to hit them.
---
And then add in any time wasted on loops, pallets, buildings, flashlights while breaking, and any time gained if the survivors actually bring a repair perk.
---
You're usually looking at 3 generators popping because you finish your first chase, before Surveillance pops (because they're single-manning the generators), before you get a Pop or Thrilling Tremors proc, and even finding someone as they move towards the unblocked generators via Corrupt isn't going to stop the other 3 survivors.
---
Particularly since you can immerse and wait out Corrupt.
---
Ruin is literally the only thing even marginally useful at slowing the first 3 generators, and even then if you have a toolbox, even missing the greats (which most people learn to hit in time) isn't going to change the result, powering through without a toolbox and getting 3 pops by the first hook happens all the time.
---
Fuck is "in before"?
---
SCREW THAT SPIRIT WHO DIDN‚ÄôT LET ME AND MY FRIENDS SCREW AROUND AS 4 SCOOPS AHOY STEVES. SHE KILLED US ALL AND WE HAD NO FUN!
---
Not really, I‚Äôm usually not the best on the team but I still contribute enough to not be completely useless and pip. It‚Äôs a lot more easy to escape at rank one when you don‚Äôt have baby killers camping hook.
---
I swear for every toxic killer there and ten toxic survivors.
---
For meme games I used to throw on Distressing and Unnerving Presence, and Whispers, then use the add-ons that cause the boxes to take longer to search and the one that increases skill checks.  Then don't use stealth once someone has a trap on their head.
---
I was trapper earlier and it turned into a farming game as I was confused on wth Nea wanted and everyone else joined in, I got caught in the infinite glitch but a Nancy from a past game disarmed a trap
---
Didn‚Äôt wraith pick a dude up and throw him in a car crusher?
---
You know closing chests make a notification for killers right? If they didn't know you were there before, they sure do now.
---
I mean this came from the game. So I think at some point it was fitting for it.
---
I have footage of it if you want that uploaded
---
Yes i know but they could've added her when they added the original Ghostface outfit
---
Well I mean I think you're underestimating how strong he is beforehand. I know people just like to say hes just a teen but hes 19 years old and is pretty tough, easily beats a kid who was locked in a single room with no exercize and little food for life
---
I love these portraits so much I forgot what the original portraits look like
---
Wazzzuuuuupp
---
Yes you will earn up to x7 BP (base xp + 5xbase for party streamers + .25(4)base for wglf or bbq)
---
clownnnnn bro i just turn potato every time lolol
---
Give it to me
---
Doc
---
Yes!! WE WANT WYNONA!!!
---
Makes me want a dbd prop hunt.
---
I am surprised they don't work like the Daily's. Instead of focusing on one challenge to complete. Its the single focus goal that's creating the problem. A person trying to repair 4 gens in a single match isn't going to care to save people, heal people, or escape the killer. They are gonna go a stealth build and if they ever get caught - dc just to get into the next game quicker.
---
Why did you even compare these?
---
An even more satisfying key then!
---
Huntress because she is ranged and they always find some spot to hit me through.
---
The hooks in his back make no sense now imo.
---
This shit is good
---
Plague is arguably a murderer. A Priestess would usually let someone sick die just to appease their god.
---
Didn't DC penalty only occur when DCing early in the match?
---
Let's not forget they can deadlift any survivor with their scrawny body.
---
No it has been stated that its canon for mikey to be more than human, he always was. He is the incarnation of pure evil. Literally nothing can hurt him
---
That's still not the Ghostface from Scream, though.
---
‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Get ready for disappointment. Its so lack luster.
---
Wait the survival category isn't a middle finger?
---
Have i been blind?
---
I wish they are just all active, all the time.  Make them grindier to compensate if need be.
---
This won't help you if they just dc
---
He got stabbed in the eye with a clothes hanger too.
---
GF is meta, but yeah he‚Äôs probably the killer that most ruins the game for me. The reveal mechanic is completely broken, he can stalk you but you can‚Äôt reveal him and pretty much every GF resorts to the tactic of using his stealth to camp hooks. This is what happens when devs pander to all that killer main crying.
---
I only really hate GF, Billy and Legion. All 3 are fairly popular.
---
All the other killers I don‚Äôt have much of an issue with. So I guess least liked non-meta killer would be Hag. Most players tend to just put all their traps around the hook and camp like mad.
---
Well, unless you're from east- **[The following joke has been removed by the Twitter cancel culture.]**
---
My friend always plays Tapp and screams that his color advantage is non existent, I love it. I have a 15 dollar gift card, so I could get all three of them
---
Freddy with PGTW, and BBQ, Ruin, Than. (Even if you get out it takes like 15mins)
---
Demo with MYC (Basically nothing you can do if you save someone from the basement)
---
Doc... Being dead on hook and having the game tell me him where you are is obnoxious.
---
I would just have the hex move to a dull totem when destroyed which weakens its effect but keeps it up until there are no applicable totems
---
&lt;3 !!
---
Not really. Not when the other survivors just sit in a bush nearby rather than using the time to do gens.
---
Ah, I had a Dwight while growing up. They don't taste as good as a Feng.
---
I know hes more then human, but to say hes an embodiment of pure evil or anything is just speculation, and is just something Dr Loomis often describes him as. And yeah while he's never been killed, its very often implied he's killable, for example if they decapitate him, it is just very very difficult to.
---
It's like dark devotion, but applied to the three survivors you didn't hit.
---
Sorry for that. I did his power on the progress. What gave me the idea was thinking about who could have those perks. I did the killer based in his perks.
---
Happens in the swamp a lot. Only when the exit is on a certain tile too. Imagine if the tree was at the other end of the tile, could potentially block the switch.
---
Thanks.
---
Considering Freddy is META I hate playing against fucking clown. So boring
---
:D Thank you!! ^w^
---
Any time you see the word 'entity's replace it with devs and then it makes more sense.
---
Probably lag
---
I can easily pip without that, so I see zero reason to waste time on it.
---
I don't see how that could be a nerf to Haunted Grounds since the whole team is still one shot away.
---
Hmmm. Last time I checked. Hag ate her captors.
---
Oh yeah having a hag/trapper mine the shit out of a basement all but directly telling survivors they are gonna have a shit game. 
---
Or a Killer "respecting" the shit out of pallets to deny a survivor the fight back challenge. (Stun a Killer 4 times in one trial)
---
Everyone is suffering from this. I hate it when someone dc's and it's a toxic but I can understand WHY they sometimes do it. And yes killers probably have it harder.
---
Never mind bugs and hitboxes. If the devs cleaned up the game before handing out punishments only the most toxic killers/survivors would care the other 97% of the playerbase would not.
---
ATTENTION EVERYONE,THERE IS A CRAZY MAN WITH A GUN IN THAT ROOM.
---
[yakety sax playing in the background]
---
Congrats. The killer is slightly more terrible than you.
---
The devs honestly owe us either make the challenges easier, or more time, because we have 12 days left and I am still stuck in the beginning of Archives 3.
---
* Tier lists of any kind. This includes meme tier lists and personal perk/killer rankings.
---
Make multiple challenges completable within the same match. It's bullshit. I want to complete the challenges while playing the game instead of focusing on them at the detriment of basic play.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ecjoeb/so_true_and_sad/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Yes you did. Read the Survivor handbook. 
---
Rule #80,768: If in a not so rare occurrence survivors 3 gen themselves, the killer must walk across the opposite side of the map (Especially if one survivor has been hooked in the middle of the 3 gen)
---
Not at all, your goal as killer  should be to force the 3 gen to have the alte game in your favour
---
Because they'd have to do some legal work, they already have 2 of them, there'd be no killer to introduce, and it would be oversaturated.
---
What I thought, I was playing ghostface as well.... and tbh I was running devour so I let them get free unhooks lol
---
Ah rats. What other rules should I be aware of?
---
No you should not feel bad!
---
Why should the killer not use scenarios like this?
---
The survivors play without considering the fun of the killer!
---
So why should you put yourself at a disadvantage if they fuck up!?
---
Oh you are an evil person haha. My devour always gets popped so fast sadly
---
This is what I thought, as I said above I was running devour as well, and let them get free unhooks
---
Aha fair enough, I dont like the letters because it reduces the traps and I want a trap oriented playstyle. And I want them to feel the pressure of traps rather than me interrupting. Definately though then ill check out the timer addon and the extra trap/box
---
Imagine getting moried by scrappy soo lmfao
---
Literally the only challenge i have left in this rift is to open 12 chests and its gonna a take me ages because I always bring an item and rarely loot lol
---
I do wish we had more than 2 emotes lol
---
I use ghostface too but I just want the fun of the traps, big saw fan ahah
---
My normal strat is to patrol the 3 gens closest to my totem lol... force a ez 3 gen then get devour stacks and do what must be done ;)
---
Ohh I see ultimate regression and skillcheck build interesting! I am screenshotting this for later aha
---
Theres no reason to camp with hag. Her traps activate damn near halfway across the map and devour hope gets tokens for leaving hooks alone. Only bad hags camp, like any other killer.
---
I dont see anything wrong here tbh
---
People forget the spirit leaves a husk behind and think you have a nurse port or wall hack sometimes. I get ps4 hatemail when I play as her but for some reason weird ggs when I play as legion without addons. So bizarre
---
Why is that so true
---
I'm only half way through it...an important one is Rule #70,146 which states "if a survivor follows killer and dying state survivor to the hook, killer must allow survivor to make a safe unhook and pretend it didn't happen. Killer must continue searching for other survivors (if no other survivors are alive, killer must allow one gen to be completed,if no gens are left to complete, killer must forfeit match and allow them to escape)
---
Besides the 1:45 pallet is wonderful xd ... It doesn't have much merit considering that killer looks like a rank 21 x,d
---
He misses I stun him but then I get knocked down. You can‚Äôt see it but I went down (injured to downed) after I stunned him.
---
:o I‚Äôm so sorry I didn‚Äôt know... what if a survivor is being toxic and tea bagging and doing clicky clicks?
---
Wow.
---
I always had a sneaking suspicion, but wrote it off as paranoid. 
---
Now, I'm just all fucked up
---
Damn the finesses tho
---
Yes, I‚Äôm 40 and love playing Dead by Daylight. 
---
Yes, I asked for a Cricut for Christmas. 
---
Yes, the first thing I made was this. 
---
Found this on Google Image (Pinterest). Shout out to Suthkorn Khaoseeda. It says that person made it but I can‚Äôt find no info. I redrew it in Figma and made a cuttable SVG file.
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
Secretly Jeff is Jesus in disguise, he‚Äôs just waiting to strike when the entity isn‚Äôt ready....
---
Box of Gears and Reduced timer is fun. Rule set 2 is always a good choice, and if you want to be fucky then use Annotated Plan and Jigsaw's Sketch.
---
Maybe like I‚Äôm gives you one extra hook like so if you get hooked aslong as you don‚Äôt try and unhook yourself and you get hooked again it puts you back into that state instead of struggle
---
If I fail a skill check, I keep working on a generator and see how long I can push my luck.
---
Is the killer called the hooker ? üôÇ
---
Maybe im just way to used to lag and crazy lunges but it did look like he hit you to me, when you throw down a pallet it resets your character to the front of the pallet and moves you to the otherside, I should say thats what your hitbox does, just like when you fast vault a window you get invincibility frames, it was to make swinging through pallets more consistent for killers but visually looks like BS
---
Or imagine if the devs simply allowed DCs to count towards the challenge.
---
That‚Äôs ma cool
---
Marie?
---
I had a blendette call me hacker(wall hacking) yesterday because I kept finding her. I have special eyes.
---
I found Dark Senses and Chilling Escape both reasonable, as so long as you can hide/gen rush well, you're good to go.
---
However, Six Feet Under is just wayyyy too easily screwed over by some other player. The other two could be screwed by another gen rusher or the killer finding you first, but that's more skill based than some survivor clicking the leave match button.
---
No it's not me when they are 4k'ing. He isnt OP like he used to be don't get me wrong. He is solid though. His maneuverability is better than Billy by a long shot but he's easier to juke right before the hit comes. He also needs to charge up with blood so he cant always have dash on demand but the Oni I see use it in a way that after every hit and hang they have it charged back up already most of the time. Hes not as good as Billy overall but he isnt bad, still A tier IMO.
---
That wasn't worth the pallets.
---
Yeah I think I will buy piggy next I do hate the traps when i Have one on so i imagine it eill be fun the other way lol. Got 8800 shards just now so not far üòä
---
He just pesters the survivor until their eardrums pop and they lose the will to keep going
---
Yeah that‚Äôs where it helps.
---
I'm not even mad with rank 20 players because they just started with the game, but if I'm usually from rank 8 up, why am I always, or at least lately, matching with ranks from 16 to literally 20? I'm always deranking because they don't do gens and I don't want to be banned for smurfing since BHVR bans for even less. They should fix this shit at least if they can't fix bugs.
---
If I was survivor and I had 3 dc, I would understand if they hooked me. The game was ruined for them too, they missed out on potentially 9 hooks and 3 kills. Hopefully they‚Äôd farm a little first though.
---
A 3rd, unique emote per survivor would be really cool.
---
Finger guns for ace, david can flex, jeff can headbang, nea gives you the finger, no one knows what claudette does because no one ever sees her.
---
Wouldn't help. Survs just go sit in a corner on the otherside of the map where the killer can do nothing.
---
Hell i had a surv who just hid away in endgame collapse so i wouldn't find her and finish my challenge.
---
People will always come up with something that makes that challenge in particular impossible.
---
Its a horribly done challenge since most killers don't like to rely on basement and generally survivors doesn't like those types of killers aswell
---
Fucking legion. I always lose to him.
---
Ohh my bad sorry that does sound sick aswell the secret. There is so much I need to experiment I have written so much notes from this thread to use. I thought the pig was bland and boring but I was wrong!
---
Ohh I think Pig might only be bought with auric cells though :( , because its a licensed killer :(
---
How do you say "gg ez" in spanish? I need to know this.
---
It should be a list. Similar to call of duty.
---
Make it in Alphabetical order.
---
I had to google the names :D, I will definately keep that in mind and experiment!
---
I don't mind the concept of the challenges but I had 2 grievances in particular; 
---
The first was as you pointed out some of them make people play a certain way that isn't beneficial to the game, search 12 chests or blind the killer challenges. Often as these ones are more grindy people would try to do as many as possible in one match and waste a lot of time doing nothing for the team, at least with the chest one I tried to give people the items. I also saw it on killer challenges when you had kill x amount of obsessions or the basement 4 kills, these challenges often inspired what most perceive to be toxic play like camping and tunneling. 
---
My biggest issue however was that I don't like lore being tied to a particularly difficult challenge. Take Six Feet Under, this challenge was hard and took some time to do, I also know people who didn't want to do it as they felt it would mean them playing toxically and they didn't want to do that to others. I love the idea that lore is being added but I wish they wouldn't lock it behind some of the more challenging challenges that way it gives people who only do the rift for lore the option to just ignore them. 
---
Overall its a nice addition, gives cosmetics, extra BP, lore for the game and adds something else to do. I feel its a good starting point and I love the fact it will make people use perks they may never take, like dark sense.
---
Could be a glitch then. Keep  that item and dont prestige  your freddy  or you'll  lose it. Glitched splinters are kinda rare
---
In chat we still use gg ez, but I can translate it for you:
---
Good = Buen
---
Game = Juego
---
Easy = F√°cil 
---
It's a literal translation, but you can say "Buen juego, fue sencillo!"
---
Even you understood, what he mean. So, what's the problem?
---
I just don't understand why that challenge wasn't get 4 kills with trapper in a single match.
---
The survivors side has escape with claud..
---
All depends on direction, where they're pointing, and sometimes on a place, where they're. Dude just needs a better book.
---
Holy shit the original comment literally made that same mistake and people played along with it on higher rated comments, I guess it's a dump down here.
---
For a long time I thought that having a survivor that can be any 4 members of the gang would be cool, like a survivor version of Legion being any of 4, and the killer the Creeper or something. And it would be funny if Scooby would just follow the character around until you enter chase, and then he just peaces out. Of course that's a lot to implement, but it's fun to imagine.
---
Sounds good to me. I‚Äôm not familiar with call of duty o.0 haven‚Äôt played since modern warfare 2 on ps3
---
That's not a problem. That's the way the game works, based on frames he connected before your animation ended thus it was a hit. If the stun happened and you didn't get hit then the killer would be justified in complaining, whereas you're complaining about a legitimate hit.
---
The perks are in text form. Not the icon only.
---
lmao so true, i was about to say i hate hags that places all 10 traps near the hooked but clown is really annoying too
---
You‚Äôre not letting your team down. Heart racing during chases is the best part! It‚Äôs you having fun in an intense chase. Sometimes you win the chase, other times you lose. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. If you want to get better at survivor, I‚Äôd advise watching streamers such as ZubatLEL, ScottJund, ohTofu, Brother Cope etc. on twitch. The way they run tiles and make use of the set-up can give you a different perspective during chase and may help you get better.
---
We need ricardo as a survivor
---
He's a garbage Billy but I still play him. Any survivors that get 4k'd by Oni have shitty awareness and even shittier positioning. Even unsafe loops render his power useless.
---
Skillchecks should be randomized by default. They are literally just checks at this point.
---
Kept Doctor from ending the chase, so...
---
Ghostface. Hes not only strong if you can capitalise on the stealth like first hits and such, but hes also alotta fun. You can do a lot of sneaky plays with him, from yoinks to assassins creed stuff etc etc. And you can also tbag.
---
Oookay that makes more sense
---
Wow xbox graphic sucks
---
It also do be like that
---
mid game yesterday I saw a Dwight levitating you like he was being raptured or something then he got teeter back down to earth and landed next to me. I said fuck this and stopped playing for the night lol
---
LOL that‚Äôs terrifying.
---
Good thing that's not taking the game hostage. If it really bothers you that much alt-tab out or go take a bathroom break or something and come back in 3 minutes. I swear people take slugging way too personally. 
---
It's not as big of a problem as you make it out to be, and certainly not one that would mean we'd need to delay d/c punishments for.
---
But with Feng your hungry again in an hour.
---
To be fair the "come over here" motion is used for most "come over here" requests. (Hit me, come here) Most people point at the hook when they want themselves to be hooked.
---
Survivors tend to crouch in front of you and look up at you to express compassion. Running away is a sign of anger. Or fear.
---
Freddy mains smh
---
This is the best idea ever.
---
I literally had the challenge in my name, the killer had mercy and helped me do it. When I came out the game I realized It wasn‚Äôt selected...
---
Another time... same thing, killer helped me, but my teammate ‚Äúend game hook rescue‚Äù decided to run out the exit gates lmao. The killer and I just watched and he said ‚ÄúI tried...‚Äù XD
---
Yeah i agree entirely. Especially challenges like the ones to get 2 endgame kill's with noed as a perk. It's essentially forcing you to play badly/let survivors finish all the gens in order to complete the challenge. 
---
No challenge should literally encourage you to let the opposing side to be on the brink of victory to complete it in my opinion.
---
Went up against a surprising number of facecampers yesterday. Tons of people who got salty that someone looped them for a semi-decent amount of time or found their Ruin.
---
Then again most of my matches were against Rank 10s when I'm at Rank 3.
---
6 rank difference max btw. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
The Us vs. Them mindset is very prevalent and very fierce in this game. 
---
There are some users on /dbdg/ and /assg/ who would swear by not using Bloody Party Streamers and Gruesome Gateaus because it would give the other party bonus points. It's pathetic, really.
---
You do lose some points for the "OK boomer" though.
---
On a serious note idk why people play a game they clearly aren't having fun on.
---
It just might if the window for the scaling punishments is long enough. If it resets every day, then you might have a point. But if it's on a weekly/monthly basis I guarantee you someone will have to weigh whether being a spiteful little baby is worth being timed our for 30 minutes / an hour /6 hours etc. 
---
Suddenly it's not as much as a simple choice.
---
That‚Äôs nice of your brother to include enough money to buy 2 cosmetics.
---
Dead Hard ghost procs happened before Dedicated Servers too though
---
The demodoggo one made me LOL
---
What was probably happening was the game would open, but without focus. Clicking on the program would grant it focus but also click through the menu.
---
&gt; Good thing that's not taking the game hostage.
---
oh its not? guess we should get rid of end game collapse then, because killers should just be forced to waste time and search for the survivors - after all, its not taking the game hostage because theres nothing stopping the killer from just finding and forcing people out, right?
---
Trapper because he makes me paranoid.
---
Rough Translation of their bio
---
of killer humiliating ranks 20 and people who start playing
---
Memento mori = DC
---
You tunnel me = DC
---
Ruin = DC
---
Yellow Ping = DC
---
Spirit, Cannibal, billy? = DC
---
I fear no man. But that thing... it scares me
---
How do you look up on console when you're crouched? Or is that PC only?
---
Hahahaha yeah dude, the same exact thing happened to me. It's when you start getting matched with red rank swfs who just spank you. I feel you man.
---
https://twitter.com/TigerKirby215/status/1210224302995451907
---
But also me, BRING IN THE MORI
---
Hahahahahaaha! What a baby
---
Yeet! That is true. Tho sometimes when I mercy the player and they happen to want to do a challenge. I can‚Äôt tell the difference between ‚Äúyo I need an end game hook‚Äù or ‚Äúput down a trap‚Äù. Actually just today we had a farmer trapper and I needed 10 heals. So I kept pointing at my friend asking the killer to hit him. But he didn‚Äôt understand and thought we want traps so he kept putting padded traps down XD

Same dude
---
You should be able to move your camera (and Survivor's head) on console?
---
We need  more emots like military commands
---
Orrrrrrrr 
---
You complete an impossible tome challenge and as you‚Äôre running out of the exit gates, your game kicks you out of the match and sends you back to the games start screen. 
---
(The impossible tome challenge was surviving the match without getting hooked while using Spine Chill. We were up against a Ghostface. 
---
We didn‚Äôt stand a chance, he slaughtered all my fellow survivors. Next thing you know, I‚Äôm the lone survivor and I hadn‚Äôt yet been hooked.
---
He closes the hatch and runs to the other door. I‚Äôm at killer shack, opening up the door closest to me and I manage to open it before he springs forth and attacks me. 
---
I‚Äôm injured! But it doesn‚Äôt matter!! The door is wide open and my escape is nigh!  
---
I‚Äôm running through the exit gates and then.... 
---
I‚Äôm booted all the way to the main screen because of an unexplained error. 
---
 Effffffffff. I haven‚Äôt been able to replicate my success since that fateful match.)
---
I mean it had a range, people who wanted to be noticed are the same who ran Mettle of Man, it would've been the current OoO, but you couldn't see the killer
---
Oooh ok I didn't know moving the camera moved their head. Guess I never really noticed when I play pig
---
Crouching survivors that look up are the cutest fricken thing in the game &lt;3 They always win my heart ;w;
---
Can't finish them if the gates are powered up.
---
I try to make it easy for ya, what can I say? :)
---
I love how 3 of them have puns or Christmas stuff as their username and then there is just perishttv
---
Gen speeds need to be fixed.
---
&gt;Oh yeah having a hag/trapper mine the shit out of a basement all but directly telling survivors they are gonna have a shit game. 
---
"The killer is using one of the most advantageous hook locations in the game. Why are they making thing so shitty for me?"
---
&gt;Or a Killer "respecting" the shit out of pallets to deny a survivor the fight back challenge.
---
"Why isn't this killer eating every stun like a predictable bot? Especially since if they do bait the pallet throw  successfully they can break it faster?
---
&gt;but I can understand WHY they sometimes do it.
---
I can't. Unless it's one of the rare times where people get stuck in terrain then there is NEVER an acceptable reason to d/c. And shit like the recent basement bug usually ends up getting patched fairly fast. People have have free reign to d/c for nearly the entirety of this game's life. It's obvious by now just expecting people not to abuse it isn't a feasible hope. So now it's time to smack some hands with a ruler and hope people stop being shitheads. Or if they don't, then enjoy their temp ban so they can't ruin more games with their selfishness.
---
I flat out refuse to buy the next battle pass, or any other battle pass until they make these challenges less of a fucking joke.
---
I'm still going to do the challenges (of course it's free Bloodpoints) but I'm not going to try for anything other than getting through the Rift for the shitty eye charms. Fuck the stupid lore I can find it on the Wiki or on YouTube anyways. I'm not going to farm flashlight saves, I'm not going to play basement Bubba with Monstrous Shrine, I'm not going to deal with all the salty assholes who DC because of NOED, and I sure as shit am not going to try to get 4 fucking basement sacrifices.

About fucking right, amount I've seen of survivors do that. It annoys the fuck out of me.
---
i've seen this post so many times i'm bouta lose my cranium
---
If only all my progress could transfer over to Pc with me :( gonna be a bb dweet for a while
---
It isnt to "hard" Its just amazingly irritating. Its hard to judge just how good you are when your team does nothing. And in the very rare case where you get a really good team, you cant really think "i outskilled that killer" most of the time bc you are just left with "did i get carried"
---
It‚Äôs not wasting pallets when every gen is able to get done
---
Ye the matchmaking is fucked don't expect them to fix that. They don't seem to give much of a fuck when it comes to that it's all about getting those new cosmetics out.
---
double pip in red ranks needs 16 points for killers, which is 4 Iri emblems. Basically a perfect game. 1 pip requires 13 pips, which at the very least requires 3 gold and 1 Iri.
---
At lower ranks the bar is set a point or 2 lower to where the minimum requirement is all Golds or even less. There is no correction
---
Not when you save some for later. When I eat Dwight I feel wrong. Like eating a baby otter.
---
I sometimes wonder, WTF the killer can cancel a gen break and Memento, but can't cancel a pallet break or survivor pickup, when they're ACTUALLY vulnerable.
---
You were talking about keys being balanced, not toxicity. Also you don‚Äôt deny that you aren‚Äôt parroting whatever he says. Grow a spine.
---
First DC ban is 30 seconds. Second one is 4 minutes. Speaking as someone who rarely ragequits 30 seconds or 4 minutes really isn't much of a ban.
---
League of Legends bans you for 6 minutes on your first DC and 15 minutes on your second one. It's sad when League of Legends is better than your game.
---
Gen Rush is a desing problem not a problem of the players

---
We need DC husks so even if a cunt leaves we can still hook their DC'd corpse. I'd rather have "damage mitigation" in case of a DC than penalties. I'd be happy to have both though.
---
I got 4 sacrifices in the basement yesterday but I haven‚Äôt even made it to that challenge yet :(
---
Wasn‚Äôt even trying to get it but it just happened.
---
yea no, almost none of that comes into play to start snowballing with any of these perks, unless you are a hyper-focused tunneling killer who ignores everything when they find 1 survivor waiting at a strong loop.
---
Those are all great perks that can stall out a game for long periods of time if you know what you're doing, albeit yes you have to not suck ass as a killer and actually hurt survivors.
---
The Archives were one of the worst additions to the game and the stats show it. The playerbase has been on a steady decline ever since they were added, with a noticeable drop when Tome 3 was released.
---
I somehow did that in one try but something like, ‚Äúkill the obsession by any means‚Äù manages to take me half the goddamn day ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Just fix it with any means necessary
---
Yes I love that snowboarding one as well, I spent my recent shards on the yui head piece so gotta save for that nea.
---
It occurred to me the other day that maybe this game was inspired by Scooby-Doo? Four people against one bad guy (Fred, Velma, Daphne, and Shaggy+Scoob, only one real human here in that duo so it makes sense in my head), spooky themes, and mostly because seeing characters hunched over while they run reminds me of the way they ran in the original cartoon all hunched forward, arms and legs moving similarly. Just a small theory, but would be really cute to have someone from the gang as a playable character.
---
You don't have to finish the whole gen. You just have to be on the gen when it finishes.
---
Freddy is fun just for messing with people and can be great for mindgames
---
Where do you find Nurses nowadays? Are you from the past?
---
Sprint burst , self heal , spine chill and decisive on pretty much all my characters . Iv wanted to try other builds tho I should for fun .
---
I put others before me as Claudette so players can see she is not always out for herself. I go above and beyond. Why? I have the game platinum and rift complete. Playing to just play feels like freedom and I am having a blast even if nobody helps me in return. 
---
I use bond so I can interrupt the killer mid chase and take the heat off someone that has already been hooked or to just give that player a stress break. And killer if survivors are ass clowns I will give you a kill so the match wasn't a waste of your time. 
---
I don't need the bloodpoints anymore. I play for the Tom and Jerry feel, as long as I get that I am getting what I want out of the game.
---
I mean some killer perks require DLC or lucky shrine that are almost 100% needed I couldn't play killer if someone took my STBFL away
---
Yea, it's why the most important part of the whole system is what kind of timing BHVR uses for degradation/ resetting the punishment scale for a player.
---
If it's too generous then people will just view it as "2 free D/C's a day, sweet". If it's too long then that has its own problems as well.
---
I'm super curious to see what they'll announce when they all come back in January.
---
Yes. These are not all the trophies. I think trophies on PC and PS4 are the same (from the games I have on both, they do have the same trophies)
---
seriously ikr
---
Claudette makes E Z with her fingers
---
get that bread GLHF
---
I actually had my SWF let a Tombstone myers Mori everyone since I know how painful of a challenge it is, especially when the last survivor hides in a locker or DC's.
---
it's more a information perk, but the point still remains that we have tons of perks related to gens now that will just become stronger if gen times were increased. There are a handful of killers who can take advantage of Thrilling, much like Surveillance or Discordance to keep map pressure constant
---
lmao
---
Yeah I‚Äôm trying to do an achievement run atm. Finally got the hemophobia one. Definitely gonna be some tough ones tho
---
Why am I a leech? What is happening
---
Yeah it's such bullshit I dont even look for hatch until the last person is hook, and I check and see the killer camping. Then I'm like alright hatch time. Until then do gens
---
Nop the opposite now in red ranks the solo players take ten minutes in get a lobby, the matchmaking for survivors  in red ranks is in his lower point ever
---
That challenge is pretty easy if you run certain builds I ran [Sprint burst, Dark sence(obviously), prove thyself, better together]
---
Run bond and try to do gens with your teammates. Try and ask them to not pop gens unless you‚Äôre there. They should help.
---
The big issue is how grindy some of these challenges are. Things like "repair 10 generators", "heal 5 people", "escape 5 trials" is perfectly doable. But when they ask you to repair 4 gens in one trial, or heal 5 people in one trial, or open 3 chests in one trial? Yeah fuck off.
---
I think they need to do away with the Master challenges entirely. Some of them were fun but most of them were way too monotonous.
---
They also need to work on the Auris Web (challenge paths) for both sides. Maybe *don't* make "unhook 25 Survivors" or "open 12 chests" one of the **first** challenges people need to do, so **everyone** isn't doing **the same challenge?**
---
I have seen people get that and then DC after a single hook.. makes no sense..
---
It really depends on your rank and the survivors you get. It‚Äôs doable, sure, but it could take you several matches to get. 
---
I really didn‚Äôt want to spend a night playing a bunch of Trapper games just to get one challenge, so I farmed that one.
---
You already lose all the Bloodpoints you gained in the match when you DC. Judging by the number of people I've had DC from games with multiple Bloody Party Streamers I don't think ragequitters care about BP.
---
Oh shit. Will do. Never have played survivors but those look good.
---
I give it 2 weeks and counter-clockwise skill checks are gonna be easy for average players to hit
---
Good Job!
---
There is one trophy were you have to escape without ever bleeding on the Asylum map. For it, I didn‚Äôt take action to unhook players, they kept hooking unhooking each other and I worked on 3 gens.
---
I mean... there is still a chance!
---
That would be a really cool idea and yeah they should have done that.
---
she is gonna be booping your snoot if you get what I mean ;)
---
"Woke up in a car that was Tokyo Drifting *everywhere...*"
---
"Moronic idea" to save items that are extremely helpful in chases and in this case most were used when the killer wasn't even within hitting distance of you.
---
Wtf?
---
Because Behaviour is blatantly Survivor-sided. They try to hide it but they just can't.
---
Even on the first Rift your final challenge for Survivor was just to escape a few times. Your final challenge for Killer? Get a 4k. Getting a 4k isn't hard granted (just equip an Ebony Mori lol) but it's far easier to escape than it is to get a 4k.
---
He used the logo as reference but he did it all by hand
---
As the killer if there's two survivors left and I want to both give them hatch, I play locker roulette. Have them go on the lockers in the shack without you looking. Whoever is in the locker you open you hook. Repeat this until only one is left.
---
This way, you aren't choosing a favourite; who ever escapes is based off chance
---
1st DC was 30 seconds, actually. Wonder why it didn't stop DCers.
---
When I play Bill, I feel obligated to be the distraction
---
Sacrifice 6 survivors in the basement in 1 game
---
Still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs not a waste when every gen is able to be done
---
There is a handful of killers on console that are utterly unplayable unless the survivors are totally brain dead. And hit registry is broken right now so it‚Äôs even worse
---
My job is done once everyone else gets out, I feel terrible when someone doesn't
---
And people complain moris are bad
---
I mean if Emblems are anything to go by the devs have no fucking idea what their playerbase is like. Time and time again I've always said that my favorite part about Emblems is how it judges you if everyone *other* than you does poorly. Survivors all suicide on hook? Why didn't you hook them enough; depip! Survivors never heal so you only need to hit them once? Hit them more idiot; depip! The Survivors all hid in lockers and let you grab them? Why didn't you hit them more; depip!
---
Wow that dark sense clutch at the end. Gg
---
Lol i had my name changed for literally 10 games and somehow not one of the killers knew what "EGC" could have possibly meant for "EGC unhook plz"
---
Like the challenges in Payday 2
---
Pretty sure the only way to get this challenge is to derank to Rank 15 and hope to god the newbies are naive enough to not be petulant cunts.
---
Except it is a waste because they could be saved for later instead of in this bland ass chase. The chase wasn't a waste because gens got done, but only 1 pallet was useful and necessary.
---
Old DS was just as bad. At least I could completely avoid old MoM.
---
You're apart of the problem.
---
It's cool we all have bad days.  Hopefully things get better in your games.
---
If I come across a survivor working on a gen and see a totem right next to the gen. The totem must be left untouched  until after helping the other survivor with the gen. And the other survivor gets dibs if they want it
---
Is this why I am literally getting 4-man red rank teams every match at rank 7/8? I am genuinely considering de-ranking because I can't learn the sodding killer against teams like this, the toxicity is unreal when they are winning against someone potentially 7 ranks below them and it it really putting me off the Oni.
---
you don't get points for chests and hooks. Only sabotaging a hook while the killer is carrying someone nearby gives you Benevolent points, and totems are rather limited for giving points in the Lightbringer category.
---
The big problem is that for the Benevolence and Evader category, it relies entirely on the killer taking action and making those opportunities for you to get points in those 2 emblems, if the killer is shit and never hits or hooks anyone, then all that leaves is for 3 people to do gens and 1 person to get overbloated on Evader points.
---
Despite what you think, it is on the killer to give the survivors the chance to even pip or go for points in the first place. These "Gen Rush" games aren't fun for the survivor either but when the killer is ass it's all a survivor can do unless they purposefully go down and trade hooks, at which point id more of a farming match, or even worse the salty killer can face camp after being led on such a long chase, encouraging the other survivors to "gen rush" even more.
---
In the spirit of Muscle Man from Regular Show:
---
You know who gets voluntarily face camped? MY MOM
---
I personally found old DS to be worse. Literally get punished every time you do your job. It wasted so much more of my time too
---
When someone DCs they should leave a survivor husk behind instead of vanishing.
---
How can access to dead hard be better than full health?
---
or select a master and normal challenge at the same time. The amount of times I escaped without being hooked while using spine chill doing other challenges now it's impossible for me to get that
---
And his D back in Me.
---
Wait
---
You're lucky to have found a key, but more often than not a situation like that hands the killer a 4k for no reason. Doors spawning so close that there's no point in even trying in egc
---
They even buffed DS to an arguably even stronger state than it was before too, so they haven‚Äôt learned shit lmao
---
Or better yet an entire Tome at once, or do it like most other battlepasses and have all available challenges active at once.
---
LMAO.. Funniest one I ever got was a guy claiming I was "holding the game hostage" by "proximity camping".. Also had a guy say I was "holding the game hostage" because I was patrolling the last three generators and not chasing them...
---
My friend and I were playing against the Oni and the killer decided to bring him to the hatch and looked for me. I needed a healing challenge done so I went and found my friend then healed him. He ran off and the oni saw me near the hatch then proceeded to let us both leave. Felt pretty lucky for that one.

---
Sorry that's just Killer main salt. Honestly a really lucky find and good play. &lt;3
---
Yellow ping isn't bad. However, if your connection makes the game Look like a damn PowerPoint presentation, I'm DCing
---
Take that step back, then :) Put the game down, it's a game for fun and entertainment, there's no good reason it should be making you feel bad, so if it is, do something that makes you feel good instead.
---
Because since the cleanser gets injured, and if he was healthy and one shot, it gives the cleanser an advantage over healthy one shot survivors since they can't dead hard.
---
&gt; Unfortunately if they did I expect a lot of people to just play Iri Head Huntress to complete it.
---
That's sort of how I got the Unnerving Presence prevent the doors from being opened one. I ran the classic hostage doc build with a Jigsaw Piece and everyone DC'd and I got the challenge done.
---
Thank you! :) I hope your holidays have been great as well
---
Eating baby otters are fun I do it all the time.
---
I bet we have to wait a year until the next east Asian content .. but I have hope (the worse adrenaline)
---
That‚Äôs only fair really, bad connection only ever works in the killers favour
---
I agree with you. Also him dropping God pallet in such a wasteful way made me cringe
---
If you don't wiggle, insta hatch unless toxic. 
---
If you offer to be hooked by me out of pity for me, you are slugged.
---
Tunnel the toxic player. 
---
Stand in front of the afk player till they come back to scare them, if not, I hook them so they don't keep the game hostage. 
---
If someone dcs it a farm game. If im doing a daily i afk for a bit.
---
Boo the face camping killers in chat lobby.
---
Yes. I play survivor at red ranks and I have literally only played against two red rank killers in *months* and maybe 1 purple rank
---
The other day I forgot I had DS on, and got chased right after the unhook. The killer got me right before I reached the exit, and picked me up. I heard the skill check, caught it just in time, and escaped. Luckiest moment in the game
---
Original
---
You could make that argument about any team based MP game with a rank system. Killers have to ask themselves that exact same question because plenty of survivors ARE boosted. The only way you can know in games like this one is to see how long you stayed around a specific rank for the longest period. Like if you spent 2 months playing and 2/3 of the time were purple rank, likely you're meant to be at that rank.
---
This isn't exclusive to survivors or this game. Killers have the same issue because they have to wonder if they're playing against highly boosted survivors, survivors of varying ranks, and if they're going against sweaty SWF or casual SWF.
---
Legion, fast as fuck mending sim game.
---
When I first heard about the Stranger Things DLC I assumed we'd get those 2 as the survivors. Wish we had them, though I guess it wouldn't feel quite right running away as hopper instead of kicking ass lol.
---
The first 3 panels it seemed like he was gonna clown the killer. However in the end it was actually himself that was the clown.
---
Took me 3 matches with bond. The 4th one was finished when the killer closed the hatch while I was working on it. I died but I got it.
---
Never claimed for it to be
---
I'm all ears for that spicy dash around loops. God tier on her!
---
I did that challenge while playing with friends. I managed it while running the ghost face and technically wasted pallets to do it. Ran a loop and used a pallet properly and then took a hit to get a stun at the next loop, even when it meant going down. The other's all lived but I got the challenge done so I was satisfied.
---
Any day.
---
I love all the killers. Some more than others. I will never DC though even if I hate the killer,
---
On a side note I also have the Susie sweater and idk why but I‚Äôve felt like playing very friendly with it on
---
Individually.  Each scene has its own theming.  Together they clash.  On their own they look fine because they do not have twelve different focal points.
---
Had a survivor do that and the DC the moment they missed it.
---
I just pray for a black french character someday lmao
---
Not sure how big a deal it is, but I'm playing as killer on k+m and as survivor with a PS4 controller. Doing gens, running, vaults and struggling seems so better for me on the controller.
---
then why post it üíÄ
---
Yeah
---
It‚Äôs pretty fun! It‚Äôs a nice laptop so it runs really well, and I have an external mouse I use
---
Unique fred perk: Coolsville Sucks
---
You have a knack for getting misheard.
---
Once every 60/50/40 seconds upon landing a great skill check, The killer will recieve a fake explosion alert at any generator that is currently unoccupied by a survivor.
---
https://youtu.be/h-a7arGYU4E
---
So cute I could almost sacrifice them
---
Ah, yeah. I see what you‚Äôre saying. I think what I like the most is how each character has a different pose. Maybe if they all had a similar color scheme it would be super fitting
---
Yeah I thought we'd get them aswell, but it would be weird running from someone as Hopper.
---
Just look up at the killer or whatever it is you‚Äôre looking at and if you look high enough the head moves. Kind of like when you‚Äôre working gens your characters head turns in whatever direction they‚Äôre looking
---
If she has her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt cleanse‚Äù build it‚Äôs definitely a better option to cleanse, otherwise your just giving her easy kills.
---
Someone turn this into a meme template.
---
To be faaaiiirrr
---
It sounds like some edgy 4chan shit like "lel"
---
This literally means: 
---
Playing any game = DC
---
U say Hooper, im in
---
Funny story. I did give a survivor this yesterday, and I felt like he kinda deserved it after 3 DC‚Äôs. However, he went AFK and so I left him by hatch, eventually made him stand up instead of being in the dying state, and he still was AFK. 10 minutes later, I gave up. I couldn‚Äôt wait any longer. I still got a merciless killer üòÇ
---
If you can set the colors to be a wave at a key press. I have a logitech keyboard that stays res but whenever i press any key a wave shoots out across the keyboard from that key and they all change color.  It is disorienting but it‚Äôs so fucking cool

Because I saw it for the first time, and I laughed. Was hoping to make someone else laugh, but then I got jumped by the popo

Hug walls and corners tighter. Way too much time not doing it costs a down.
---
one time i kobe‚Äôd off a hook and i thought it was just something you could do all the time üò≠üòÇ
---
Lol this is literally what I am doing. I am about to p3 him and I am now starting to hate him purely because how noncompetitive and frustrating the games are. Out of 11 games only 1 was competitive and its because I had an ebony so I don't really count it. 
---
It just sucks because if I play Freddy I have fun competitive games, I may not always get a 4k but I kill a hell of a lot. With the Oni I am lucky if I have killed 2 by the last gen pop and sometimes I have just killed my first person. He is just so easy to counter and even playing survivor I find him dull whereas watching PTB he genuinely seemed scary and a challenge to go against.
---
If I get picked up by Trapper I don't wiggle because I love looking at his butt. üòî
---
As killer I'm compelled to play by the Survivor rules so if I find someone I just hooked I slug them and leave them alone.
---
How can you know who is the host? Is it always the killer?
---
[deleted]
---
wow that‚Äôs a Christmas miracle that you‚Äôve never seen any post like this before
---
Right this is the groog (idk his name I never saw the movie with those yellow things) format on a clown template üßê
---
So then why not just keep scrolling past until you find something you like? There's always gonna be reposts going around, but if there wasnt, the newer members wouldn't see it at all
---
That gesture means "I want to boop the snoot" if the killer is a Pig
---
Yeah probably only got it because stbfl and im all ears carried him the whole time too /s
---
Or you could just play the game as it's intended and be a blood thirsty killer with no mercy?
---
Yep, I hate just about everything related to their emblem and ranking system. This game is entirely about learning through play time. I like the idea of there being no more rank, no more emblem. Make it entirely about devotion numbers rather than the emblems. Ranking should be based on total play time determined by devotion score. Have everyone devotion 0-2 or 3 play together, everyone at 3 and above devotion play together.
---
Gotcha, so DON'T turn off messages from strangers
---
(Jk thanks tho)
---
Anybody I've seen with that profile disconnects as soon as you hit them once.
---
#"NOW GO TO THE FORUMS AND CRY LIKE THE LITTLE BITCH THAT YOU ARE!"
---
Nothing wrong with this, he hit you before you dropped the pallet
---
Billy for chasing and Doc for just being a asshole
---
Lol genetic?
---
I want the whole gang to be survivors.
---
I love thisüëç but if I were to change one thing I'd say make it 6 survivors otherwise I dont think it would be fair to them
---
Only for PC and Switch they work by banning a person who has dcd a good amount of times by a set time that increases per dc or something like that
---
Then why was me going down delayed until I dropped the pallet? If I got hit wouldn‚Äôt I get downed straight away even though I was in the injured state when I dropped the pallet?
---
I watch entire live streams or listen to albums of music, sometimes, I play other games entirely.
---
doesn't take me 10 min or even 5 min usually 1 min
---
speaking of doc being an asshole, pig and long shock doc. thoughts?
---
Wow, Pop, Sloppy, and a fakeout teleport. I definitely never see *any* Freddys like that!!! 1!1!1!1!
---
Because the pallet dropping animation has to finish for the ‚Äúgoing down‚Äù animation to begin. In case you didn‚Äôt know, you can get hit while dropping a pallet
---
&gt;The killer is using one of the most advantageous hook locations in the game. Why are they making things so shitty for me?
---
Maybe because even if a survivor ends up in tbe basement regardless of how toxic or wholesome they played are just plain sick and tired of it? 
---
&gt; Why isn't this killer eating every stun like a predictable bot? Especially since if they do bait the pallet throw successfully they can break it faster
---
Eating a pallet is not the end of World for a killer relax. There are a few perks that literally soft/hard counters it. Enduring, Spirit Fury, and Brutal Strength. Heck nemesis actually makes it so you want to get stunned!
---
&gt; I can't.
---
And here is the bane of DbD! I was not excusing the DC's just explaining WHY they do it. It seems to me you unable to think or care about the other side.  I even admitted eariler killers have a harder time then survivors but playing survivor is not much better.
---
**EVERYONE HATES THE COMPLETE IN A SINGLE TRIAL CHALLENGES**
---
P.S before you try the whole "iT's NoT mY rEsPoNsIbiLiTy TO mAkE sURe tHeY hAvE FUn!" Just remember they whenever you are playing survivor or killer you are playing against another human being they want to be able to enjoy the game too.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt I have the ‚ÄúDowned‚Äù icon when I‚Äôm dropping the pallet then?
---
FUCK THE DISCONNECTING SURVIVORS WHO RUIN MY BASEMENT SACRIFICE CHALLENGE. YOU HECKIN HECKERS!
---
You didn‚Äôt show it in the video so I can‚Äôt tell if you did or didn‚Äôt have the icon
---
literally all u need is a doc shocking all the gens 24/7 and a good chaser to kill survivors it would be so unbalanced it doesn't matter how many survivors there are
---
You don't play Ricardo; Ricardo plays you.
---
Killers host the games on console I think
---
No, once the totem is broken you don't have hex benefits like insta down and mori
---
If someone gets farmed in front of me i hit them to deny the safe unhook and then tunnel their rescuer for two hooks
---
Learn manners people!
---
Nurse and Doctor. Doctor makes the survivors scream thus tracking them and is good for keeping gens under control. Nurse for searching out the survivors the doctor tracks, while the doctor goes after another one.
---
I‚Äôll look at it again and I‚Äôll see if I‚Äôm right about this or not.
---
This needs to be said to the devs more often because I‚Äôm sure everyone would find this feature helpful
---
Yeah, I play console
---
I mean from the green mori, after the totem is gone, can I still use the green mori offering
---
why is the survivor wiggling when I try to carry them across the entire map to the basement wtf!?
---
Majority of these challenges promote shitty play from both sides and can be countered as such and negatively affects everyone in some way. Like is that survivor just stupid in the chase or are they doing the challenge to throw a bunch of pallets in a chase?
---
Most of these challenges require even some cooperation from the opposition to be doable, pallet stuns, basement hooks, flashlight blinds, etc. and that in itself is already an issue since ALL of these things have direct counters to them so if someone wants they can make it so they are never blinded, never hooked in the basement, never stunned, never allow chests to be opened i.e. cut coin.
---
And that's just bad design for the challenges honestly. Especially since a good chunk of them need to be done in 1 match
---
THE DAY OF CAKE HAS ARRIVED MY SON, ENJOY IT!
---
Not a killer main but I make these if people want to use them for memes, wallpapers, profile pics etc.

End game chat on PC is so much better and easier to not take seriously, because once you leave it‚Äôs over and doesn‚Äôt follow you. On console you can get messages for over an hour that pop up on your screen of spammed hate that you have to go out of your way to block instead of just ignoring the person.
---
Ruin/Bamboozle/PGTW/NOED with exhaustion addon and a mori. It's really fun, especially for survivors you gonna play against
---
How's your mental state?
---
Gates spawning at opposite ends of the map greatly favors survivors. There‚Äôs 0 reason for the last survivor to have a higher to get out of a game when killer has already killed 3.
---
Sucks that the killer was using a mori, but I‚Äôm always baffled that people act like gates spawning close is so horrible. In most cases where the gates are far from each other the killer has to flip a coin and has a 50/50 chance of picking the right door. And if they pick the wrong one survivors are almost guaranteed the escape.
---
Well it takes time and it is a great app I could crop it out but wouldn't that be disrespectful a bit also again a lot of effect (not really I'm lazy) would be invested when you post memes daily
---
MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T KEEP GETTING THE GAME IF YOU HADN'T BOUGHT THE GAME
---
I dont get it
---
??? whats so special?
---
Back before I got in-the-know, and watched a ton of DBD gameplay, I used to think "Oh, as killer you have 110%+ movement speed, abilities, etc... killers have it made." Recently I've watched a lot of 4 SWF and even red rank random groups and it makes me feel bad for killer. If every survivor knows how to decently loop, they can finish all 5 gens in less than 3-5 minutes. Especially when every survivor has BT, Adrenaline, DS, and Dead Hard/Sprint Burst 99'ers. Makes me believe that when you take a top ranked killer v top ranked survivors, you have to really know what you're doing as killer if you want to win.
---
No end game colapse
---
Bring it back. DCs skyrocketed after the test ended.
---
And... Why should the killer be guaranteed the last kill? The last survivor should be given a chance. When the hatch is closed and the doors are next to eachother the killer is handed a 4k for no reason
---
No endgame colapse
---
What did I just read
---
oh, mad busted
---
DC penalty‚Äôs have also not been enabled since the 17th
---
Again, never saw the original post...
---
You mean when you morried one guy with Devour Hope if it uses your offering or the perk?
---
I dont know tbh, but you should be still able to use your Mori afterwards when you had 5 stacks when you killed one guy.
---
I would be down to test it in KYF.
---
Preach
---
For people that don't get it.Endgame collapse didn't start
---
Then let's test
---
It'd be visible only to survivors, because he has the sense to hide like a cartoon behind the hooks
---
On Xbox I get killer in a minute, survivor in about 10
---
https://i.imgur.com/7lWjDiH_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium
---
Can‚Äôt blame them when it‚Äôs not uncommon for killers to pretend to be friendly just to hook the survivor a minute later. They know what you‚Äôre doing, they just don‚Äôt trust you.
---
I see, probably coz all the survivors were either dead or on hook already?
---
Dwelfs*
---
No when i openned 2nd door it started
---
Lol whats the point of playing at all if you're gonna DC? I'd rather run to the killer and teabag the hell out of them so it kills me fast to find a different match, and that only if the rest lf my teammates already gave up trying. DC should really have a serious penalty, the hard thing I guess is making it work only against DC on purpose, or it wouldn't be nice for people with an internet conection error. At least it should give the killer and survivors a way bigger quitter bonus or something like that.
---
I came to deliver edible flip phones
---
Why do you call them gems
---
I don't get how prayer beads makes someone a bitch.
---
You should not be able to open the second door!
---
So the first door was bugged somehow.
---
Wasn‚Äôt aware there was a ‚Äúwrong‚Äù place to ask people to play lol. The forum wouldn‚Äôt let me make a post on it, so I did what was available to me.
---
Cause when they‚Äôre lit they shine like gemstones
---
Its funny because you can find posts on the steam forums talking about shit matchmaking, infinite load screens etc back from 2016.
---
They‚Äôve fixed fuck all in 3 years
---
Don‚Äôt use a shroud of separation it helps survivors more than you
---
Friendly killer?
---
For what purpose?
---
I hope you enjoy the game, Its really good game even if it has its flaws and the community is weird.
---
A tip i would give, dont buy the dlc just yet, lvl up the default survivors or killers so you can stack up some BP, wich are needed to level, so it wont take you long to level up the dlc if you ever get them.
---
I see
---
Wait a sec can we back up a second here.
---
Your teamates repair gens?
---
Why not try and find it? It's the least you could do if you are going to repost
---
Better to get those few extra points then die anyways then. If you run you forsure die, and if you don't you might not.
---
Lmaooooo
---
I don't get how using something that makes phases mapwide makes someone a bitch
---
It's getting old and boring after certain amount of time. But because you grew addicted to the game, you try to find more ways to entertain yourself and others... while still murdering people in between messing around.
---
Now you see that sounds like a mission. Idk why you guys are taking this so seriously lol. If I made a post and someone posted it months later I would laugh and be amused/happy that it found it's way back to being posted.
---
Still sexy
---
That's a new one
---
They what? I've never heard of this "repair gens"
---
I really like your art style! I knew I recognized previous comics you've done after I saw this.
---
Keep it up!
---
Console doesn‚Äôt have dedicated servers. The killer is host that was definitely on him. Feelsbadman.
---
I had a Jason walk directly by me, twice, as I was stuck crouching in a corner of a room in Lerys. I assume he simply didn‚Äôt look down and I was right outside of his vision radius. Almost shit my pants
---
I fucking hate this community.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPOST! HIT HIM WITH HAMMERS!
---
Funny post, OP. I dont give a shit about reposts.
---
Says something about the state of the game in those respects though doesn't it
---
Seriously, it's like I committed high treason or something
---
His black jacket cosmetic with his hat and dark pants is his best stealth outfit.
---
For some reason they decided to have his p3 outfit be a beacon to everyone.
---
Not sure why you were downvoted, it's true. Efficient SWF's would objectively agree that the time it'll take to find ruin, you could have already had half a Gen done. Most good and efficient SWF groups also hit their great skill checks often. I've seen games where the ruin totem was alive the whole game, and the game lasted maybe an extra minute or two..?
---
Ghostface main and I pretty much always let the last person go, and I care more about performing good jumpscares and spook timing than efficiency/winning
---
And you got to love the people who dont read the post either, just immediately, "YoU sToLe ThIs! UnOrIgInAL SLUT!"
---
Doc and literally anyone.
---
I don't know I think it might be a weird dialect thing or something where they're from.  They probably meant Self-Caring.
---
My switch lobbies are insanely fast. It's probably because of my location though.
---
Well I mean, I could have been better but unless I die by egc the killer is directly responsible for my death
---
That's the best part though! 
---
HOW DARE YOU STEAL THIS *AND* CLAIM IT AS YOUR OWN ORIGINAL POST!

"Stop trapping the fucking Claudette 50 times before you leave the hook"
---
The second they get that fifth generator you should unplug your console/PC

FUCK THESE TOMES FUCK EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM GODDAMMIT

Plague and Oni. If you dont cleanse, you are going to be screwed by the oni. If you cleanse, you are going to be screwed by the plague.
---
Doctor, and Meyers. Throw on the heartbeat add-on for doc when tier 2-3 and Meyers, you'll never know when your ass is going to be grass
---
Sabo, streetwise, boil over, and flip flop. With an Alex's toolkit and shroud of binding 
---
Pisses everyone off. Get the hook you 99% and break it with your sabo for it to last longer. The streetwise helps your toolkit last longer as well so more breaks! Flip flop let's you convert your recovery time into wiggle time and combined with boil over can be amazing.
---
Same. When I finally got it selected i ended up having to play so scummy. I gen jockeyed and had to leave the guy who ran the killer for 3 gens. I tried but got hit and wasn‚Äôt going to risk it
---
Said it to you last time - I absolutely *love* your style. Both Meg and Trapper looking cute. Merry Christmas!
---
I asked some fandoms to bring a coin and they all did
---
Got 10 chests that game lol
---
I got Tapp, Nancy, and Laurie
---
They could always do that.
---
Damn that sounds interesting. Gonna have to unlock boil over and flip flop though. God it's so satisfying when you drop the hook just before the killer gets to hook someone.
---
Same
---
I tested the penalties and they scale up to [six hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ec05r0/disconnection_penalty_lengths_tested/?st=k4n1270f&amp;sh=ee27542d) before I stopped and someone claimed 24 hours.
---
Two maps. The chances are still in the killers favor for the rest of the maps. The point I am making is that it's too easy for one side to get a favorable outcome. It just seems killers sometimes just want survivors to have no chance at all for escape
---
Try feeding him some pizza. He might evolve...
---
I highly recommend it! If nothing else you should try to get a custom game setup so you can see what it's like c:
---
Finally thought I got the dark sense challenge after 2 days of trying and was super excited until my brother told me, "Don't you need dark sense? You put spine chill." And that's when my soul left my body. Still haven't gotten it.
---
Dude you sound like you could make a documentary on survivor behavior
---
I'm also on ps4, and I practically get into a lobby as soon as I ready up
---
I think people dc as a protest...
---
Doctor matches take fuckign forever
---
i would lose my shit if i popped into tier 3 myers and someone just started doing orange justice in front of me for 10 seconds
---
Just dont get the reference to tru3 is all. I don't read his stream comments so dont know what you're talking about.
---
Jake has the worst sweater. It's not even like a traditional Christmas sweater, just has a graphic of bears and a tree
---
Imagine complaining about 40% of the objective when moris ignore 66% of their objective.

Like. Not defending keys, but imagine thinking keys are worse than moris.
---
wait
---
Phantom DC glitch. Rare but not unheard of. I have pics of it happening to me but not right now. Four healthy survivor but hatch is visible at one gen remaining. Basically the survivor times out but the game fails to update the HUD
---
I shudder at the thought of a leather face and trapper basement build
---
We don't know. After the credits in the last episode of season 3 there is a scene that makes many believe that he is alive. You should watch it.
---
‚ù§
---
I've been maining Legion since release and I'd say it left them about in the same spot. Downing someone still took the same amount of time, you'd just do it in a way that didn't seem so inevitable. Cancelling their power early to down with a regular hour was also an option since it didn't stun for four seconds and the CD reduction actually did something AND they could keep a portion of their power meter too. 
---
Legion has never had any issues getting first hits in with their power. It didn't need to be made more reliable. The issue is what comes after that. The reason I responded to your post is to try and put why people hate the most recent work too Legion. It's not that release Legion was OP, it's that the newest iteration was lazy and nothing but nerfs effectively.
---
Yeah cause the entity is busy looking at them too
---
Oh yeah. Totally forgot about that scene!
---
I had the best luck running Deerstalker with Trapper and just trapped the fuck out the basement while running Agitation and Iron Grasp.  Once you get 2 in the basement, find the 3rd and just down him.  Then find the 4th and hook them in the basement; and find the 3rd guy crawling on the ground and BLAM.  This took me a couple of tries for the same reason you have, but it's very efficient and can work easily on Macmillan or any of the cornfield maps.
---
Oh yeah! I totally forgot about that scene!
---
BL will always be bloodlust.
---
Sir, there is a clear difference between a survivor looping the killer to survive a chase and a survivor that tries to ‚Äútilt‚Äù the killer with bad mannerisms and cockiness. 
---
My comment isn‚Äôt about survivors who loop to escape; it‚Äôs about those one who come back to fuck with you even after you break the chase and walk away. 
---
I play both survivor and killer to red ranks equally. I know the difference and I‚Äôm not just picking on survivors.
---
Um... are you new around here? Jason isn‚Äôt in the game. You were probably up against a dude call the Trapper. He‚Äôs got traps n stuff
---
He didn't have much of a choice. Nearby hooks were used up or sabotaged. His mistake was not standing on them.
---
Why he did better then half the game
---
luck increases your chance to pull yourself off the hook, or get out of trappers traps
---
The game is survivor sided. Spirit just counters that part better then others
---
I just don't do it lol.
---
NGL it looks like you're going for a underground dirty sorta thing that lives up to your name. I expect every one of these girls to be looking around for the Grave Robber for their next Zydrate fix.
---
Velma =)
---
I know right. Ever since I put that sweater on I've felt so wholesome I dont even know why
---
I do enjoy how this mediocre phone game was shilled out by so many people through their videos to the point that it's become a joke to even mention.
---
Well that‚Äôs pretty fucked. üòê
---
We will have to wildly agree to disagree.  I feel I put bulletproof logic as to why old Legion was such ineffective dogshit to get kills with.  His rework made him a killer you had to show respect to.  You couldn't just stay injured entire games anymore knowing he'd be forced to down you with his ability hits despite that fact due to him being an over loopable tortoise.  Post rework they had to start making decisions on whether to heal or not.  Original Legion you were flat out among the dumbest players in game if you ever wasted so much as a second having against him.  There was no point.  The speed allows you to counter loops and his speed and extended duration make it easy to tag multiple people.  His ability is purely getting a free first hit, spreading damage for pressure and choosing to commit strategically based on who is an easy down where they're located at that particular second.
---
Let's give this ad some props for supporting our content creators in the toughest of times when Pepsi and doritos bailed on us gamers.
---
Is it by a set amount? Does it affect what you find in boxes?
---
Its because on xbox and ps4, the updates have to be aproved before they can be released which usually takes 2 weeks to 2 months
---
I HATE Trapper
---
Completely outsmarted üò≠
---
my fav part is when they have TTv in there name but dont have a link to there stream anywhere on there profile
---
That's pretty funny
---
Just like "That's how Mafia works‚Äù
---

---
This.
---
it does not affect chests, and it is a set amount, but they dont give us actual numbers, but it is not very much even with the purple offering
---

Yeah but not as op as speed limiter leatherface.
---
Just because it's a computer doesn't mean it's a pc. PC refers to the desktop variety of personal computers.

As a survivor this is very accurate

See thats what i thought. Almost not worth using then?

Spirit isn‚Äôt a counter? She is UNCOUNTERABLE. 0 outplay. Free hits.

But have you also had ones that let you live?

nope really not worth it

It was just a comment bro.

Gen rushing isnt real but camping in that situation is fair.

It's called Alien: Blackout. I know nothing about it other than it's a mobile game.

Because we already have two, four is just overkill

No shit sherlock.
---
yes, for example the hook escape chance is on a 4% base, but there are different perks that for example can add you 3 chances of tries to escape off the hook and make the escape chance from a trap with x% (i dont remember the perk very good), for chests there are specific perks as "ace in the hole" that makes your item have addons when you get it, or "pharmacy" that makes the chance of getting a medkit very big and it makes that you can get a green or violet medkit very easy. In general, perks for luck are the Ace's Teachables, and as other things.... there are offerings as salt /chalk pouches, black salt statouettes, vigos jar of salty lips.
---
Is there any plans to buff them? Seems kind of pointless atm. Maybe add set amount of % per colour
---
I‚Äôm guessing the top row is Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, and Nurse. The bottom row is Meg, Dwight, Jake, Claudette, and Nea
---
Not 100% sure but that‚Äôs what I think.
---
your cool, i like you &lt;3
---
Thats what i meant. The luck offerings seem vague and pointless?
---
I meant Myers, not Jason. I don‚Äôt watch horror movies so I get the names mixed up.
---
They all what to know who Ghostface is, but what they should ask is who's next.
---
Beware the hooks, Spongebob me boyo.
---
I had to ask the help of my friends. It's the only challenge I couldn't do solo
---
actually, theyre kinda trash... but i would use the perks that i mentioned tho... they are *acceptable*
---
usually when I use haunted grounds i go after the person who cleansed it since i know where they are at. But they'd be injured anyway right?
---
Looking like a snack tho, tbh.
---
I love otz‚Äôs chat
---
They need to just accept that third party comms are being used and WILL be used by anyone grouping so long as there are no other ways to effectively communicate within the game itself. 
---
What they should do is implement a proximity-based communication system (Day of Infamy and Barotrauma both use something akin to this), where you hear people (or see chats) that are nearby within the game, but not if they get too far away. That way you could huddle and communicate with people nearby, and formulate plans (at the risk of being heard/detected by the killer), but then once separated be on your own once more. It could also be used as a distraction, or alerting people to the killer. How cool would it be to hear the faint cry of your friend ^^^"he's chasing meeeeee" in the distance while you hurry to try and finish a generator?
---
Unless they utilize something like this and balance around it, then SWF will continue to be problematic, but also I just think it would make the game even more fun.
---
What was his perks?
---
I do that lmao. Especially if they gen locked themselves and they're trying to take me across the map i just break chase
---
Yeah, the Ghostface was laggy from the beginning. I saw him sort of clipping around and jerking about. I just really resent this turn  of events
---
You could just upload it to YouTube, and then link the video
---
I'd like to see in upcoming Tomes Challenges that do not require you to do 50 gens, 40 kicks or heal 20 ppl. It is not a "challenge", it is just boring and time wasting grind.
---
I'd rather see all Challenges to be done in single match. There are a lot of perks in game, so you can make different challenges for all of them. I do aware that a lot of perks locked behind payment wall, but devs could add feature that whenever specific Challenge is chosen Survivor or Killer, if he do not own that perk, gets that specific perk T1 in their loadout locked in slot.
---
There could be Challenges that require pair of perks to be done, etc.
---
Also as here was stated already Challenges should be designed in a way so opposite team cant deny you from doing them by DCing.
---
It could be actually opposite way - Killer and Survivor challenges could be corresponding to each other.
---
For examples:
---
Killer need to trap 6 ppl in trial, while Survivor need to free 6 ppl from bear traps.
---
Survivor need to stun Killer 4 times, while Killer need to hit Survivor 3 times after Spirit Fury perk destroys the pallet. And so on.
---
Devs are too focused on making new cosmetics instead of putting some brainwork into challenges.
---
Legion(Stabbing multiple survivors across the map is effective and fun)
---
Spirit (Jumpscaring survivors is hella fun)
---
Pig(Same reason as spirit plus satisfying RBT kills)
---
Oof. I mean. It‚Äôs very selective when you can get it. Now it‚Äôs even harder as the add on allows you a third blink but restricts to only where you can see. Minor but annoying lmao
---
Did he have play with your food? A popular perk for various myers builds (like unlimited T3) that makes him quite the fast boy.
---
Although he shoild still be quite slow while stalking. He probably had his stalk at 99% and just stalked for a split second to tier up during chase.
---
When you hold all he power in the match you can do whatever you want. I can kill all three survivors and let DWELF get hatch while I T-bag him as Ghostface because he knows that his escape is by my will alone and he was fully powerless to change my mind. 
---
If anything the fact that I can allow mercy at whim means I‚Äôm more devious than any other killer who mindlessly obeys the rules of some unknown entity.
---
Pointing after a stun means *fuck off* and *let me live*
---
PUPPY POWER!!!
---
Running in a semi-zigzag motion while looking at the sky typically means "I don't even care at this point please just kill me my team is 3 Urban Evasion + Self Care users" for me.
---
Thank
---
My golden rule with that is pick up survivor and stand there for 2 seconds. Drop them if they wiggle and shaken off. If they cannot understand after that, it‚Äôs hooking time.
---
That makes Lord Gribblo happy

I didn‚Äôt even tunnel, hook camp, or do anything like that. It was just a normal game.
---
On xbox my queue times are flipped killer takes less then a minute survivor takes 5 plus minutes on average.
---
ooh you‚Äôre right! thanks so much üòÅ
---
You're playing on console right? If so his internet is pretty shitty and you also have to remember the fact that he could be from across the world. This is why I always checked the ping bar before servers came out. He's not lagging at all, you're just seeing him lag because of the high ping. When I've had survivors with really high ping and they complained that I was laggy, I didn't experience any lag at all.
---
**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; Giveaways must be pre-approved by the mod team.
---
I mean, the pointing at the killer can be a "fuck you, follow me so I can loop you and my friends get to survive" but usually they spam it then, to taunt you
---
I've had a couple Ace mains do that...
---
Forreal, I had to camp pallets like a fucking moron for that challenge, I felt idiotic.
---
I am on console. And that would explain it. Still, really ruined the game
---
Santa‚Äôs little helpers have been overworked this Christmas and now they‚Äôre PISSED.
---
To be fair when you're a slow killer on a big map and they're smart and split up it's hard to put pressure on all 7 gens.
---
Why do you think spirit is one of the best killers? She lacks everything the other top ones do. She can‚Äôt teleport. She doesn‚Äôt have an insta down. That leaves her with her base power. Not a surprise. You wanna match broken with broken?
---
Or that, but i like to think not everyone's out there to get you, ya know? :P
---
110% movespeed, shitty match travel and chases even if they are consistent always last at least 30 seconds.... 30 seconds X 12, 3 chases per survivor.
---
360 seconds which is more then enough time to do gens... this doesnt even include time people can spend on hook.
---
Hahaha good idea I‚Äôll try that
---
Thank you for not joining the lets record it with my phone instead of using the perfectly serviceable recording on whatever device I'm on.
---
Oh I like this. Sometimes I just run up and cancel the come here animation so it looks like I'm patting them or giving them a hug.
---
It's bad when I don't speak or read whatever language that is, but I know what it says.
---
Its opinion though. For me she‚Äôs not so bad and its Ghostface that is the issue.
---
Just tap m2 to remove terror radius and then stand in front of the hook. Yay so much fun!
---
Not to mention the reveal mechanic is completey bugged. You stare at him and nothing happens. He stares at you and you‚Äôre exposed. Its been known for a long time but bithing gets done because killer mains cry their eyes out about ‚Äúmuh buffs‚Äù
---
Oooooo he salty
---
Exactly. There was a comic on the dbd subreddit, I think it‚Äôs still there, of a nea teabagging, flashlight clicking, and just being toxic, but the second the nea gets hooked she screamed ‚Äútunneled‚Äù facecamped‚Äù it‚Äôs the sad reality
---
Change username to if u DC u big gay. Life hacks.
---
They might as well. 95% of killers dont leave hooks. Best strategy is to just rush gens.
---
most of the slow killers can teleport (such as nurse n spirit ya know?) i mean you're right. but yeah.
---
I have wondered the same thing
---
He 99% his t2 then used it mid chase.
---
High rank killer is fast, high rank Survivor is slow.

Low rank killer is slow, low rank Survivor is fast.
---
I didn‚Äôt even camp or tunnel
---
Yesterday I had a guy put in a haddonfield map offering, when I was ghost face. He played like ass and DC'ed when I downed him. His profile said: Of all flavors you chose salt. Spirit= No skill :)
---
Some seriously antagonistic morons who play this game.
---
As killer I try not to tunnel. If I do go towards someone unhooking another I‚Äôll usually go after the unhooker and not the one on hook, but if 4 gens are done and I haven‚Äôt sacrificed anyone then I‚Äôll go for the unhooked person
---

---
Matchmaking largely depends on your:
---
- location
---
- Rank
---
- Time of play
---
If killer queues are long it probably means a lot more people are playing killer rather than survivor.
---
This was my problem in the red ranks as well. All of a sudden every killer respected and even faked going into pallets. I‚Äôve never experienced a more annoying challenge. 
---
No, the sacrifice four survivors in the basement is not even comparable. I literally just kept going into the basement with Agitation and Iron Grasp on Haddonfield with Billy and finished it in that first game. 
---
Yes, the two unhooks during endgame was comparable... until it got changed to one unhook during endgame. 
---
So seriously, f*** pallet stun challenges.
---
Fred Cosmetics for The Trapper
---
You will get 1 cosmetic item, p1 gives a torso item, p2 legs, p3 head. Same for killers, but it's weapon, torso, head.
---
That's pretty much anything, your character gets reset to level1 and everthing gets deleted (perks and items).
---
It is said you get a small increase in rare things on the bloodweb, but that bonus, if it really exists, is so small you will not notice it.
---
Why? This game isn't a Stranger Things game... We got 3 stranger things characters already, it's enough.
---
Once they die he pees on them and says ‚Äúpuppy power!‚Äù
---
Play with your food maybe?
---
For killers it's Weapon, torso, head and if they have pants it's weapon pants head.
---
For Survivors it's torso pants head.
---
You get a .5% chance per prestige rank for "bEtTeR dRoPs In ThE bLoOdWeB"
---
It‚Äôs because of the ratio of killers to survivor, many more people are trying to play killer so it‚Äôs hard for the game to fill out a whole lobby of survivors with similar ranks
---
Nah he was literally walking and stalking
---
Bad matchmaking despite his performance and honestly is less than 10k for a game where everyone dies really a good score?
---
Bug
---
How do you know?
---
Because he would come out of t3 and be up your arse then all of sudden hit t3 again
---
they way i do is it upload it to Twitter and use a site to download the video
---
Not no reason. They took out three players before gens were finished and found the hatch before the survivor did.
---
Completely and utterly moronic.
---
Big brain
---
The link isn't working, can you put another link? Thanks.
---
It looks like some sort of Christmas dwelves cult
---
Wait 15 seconds at the start of the match before doing any gen.
---
Imagin DH lasting for more than 17 seconds
---
u/seriousbop
---
God I'd let oni expand his song all over me, I mean have you looked at his muscles
---
SO THE GATES ARE OPENED AND I SEE YOU GOING FOR THE SAVE AND I SMACK YOU AROUND AND IM A "TOXIC CAMPER"?  
---
WTF WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? GO STAND IN A CORNER?
---
&gt; s you know you can get free blood points
---
Didn't know that. Wow, how so?
---
I'd do the survivors with meta perks first. David, meg, Louie, or bill.
---
When a game is designed to upset you, most of the time its true:)
---
I'm lime rank 5 and have never used ruin once? It's about learning how to play better, not the perks (although that doesn't mean that perks don't help)
---
Is it worth then?
---
Green rank killer on PC I get matches almost instantly.
---
I got so lucky last night completing this one. I basically had to hide as much as possible and use Bond to go to gens being repaired by other survivors. I did get hooked once and one gen was about to be completed right I got saved. Thank god the killer didn‚Äôt tunnel me, I was able to run straight to the last gen and finish it.
---
My evil twin brother!! (Can't belief I spelled my own reddit name wrongüòÇüòÇü§£)
---
I like you cause you got that
---
Sp it's not worth yes?
---
If the game is survivor sided, can you point me to 3 streamers who can escape back to back to back at will?
---
If you like the bloody cosmetics and will use them yes, otherwise not really. It's just better to stay level 50 and get 4 perks each bloodweb.
---
It'd be a lot better if DCs left a body you could interact with.
---
TBH it seemed like a mistake to test the DC penalties. Just implement them and keep them. Before the penalties I'd rarely see DCs, during the penalties I saw maybe one or two, after the penalties it feels like there is at least one every match, frequently two.
---
Meh half the time they will be memeing.
---
*But that uncertain coin flip is up to you if you decide to risk it...*
---
I stay crouched and roar so they know it's ok to boop
---
I do enjoy booping the snoot
---
So max level is 50 but you can have more bloodwebs?
---
&gt; If it's not SWF hours 
---
What time is that?
---
~~testing this strikethrough thing out~~
---
Bro. You posted cringe bro. You are going to lose subscriber.
---
I wish more people did. If I crouch over to you and roar over while ur doing a gen without attacking... take the hit. If no one boops I'm killing all of u
---
I'll remember that if I ever come accross you
---
It made me smile. :) People will always complain about re-posts, but I've also never seen it.
---
I don't think he'd really fit. He's a killer, but with "good reason," not a murderer. The other killers (excluding Spirit and kind of Bubba) have done bad things with mostly bad intentions. This excludes Payday Jacket. Because, uh... yeah.
---
I've had games as bad as the one in this noob3 video https://youtu.be/B8_QOxw-fHg
---
I had a game against a killer who lived in the middle of nowhere and (luckily he was a nice killer) and the guy kept going on top of pallets when I stunned him and pallets took so long to drop too. 
---
I've also had a lag switching Myers because he was I was looping him around the shittiest loop in the game. https://www.twitch.tv/shmockette/clip/VictoriousObliviousKumquat4Head
---
The servers are good IMO unless you yourself have bad internet.
---
i did XD
---
I just forgot about them!
---
Ahhh thats awesome!
---
Nice adren is life.
---
Distance and direction 
---
Nose boops and slow walking before are friendly
---
Pointing during a chase or pallet are aggressive
---
Generally around 7 pm local time.
---
for me it is. dunno what other players do but i have like one freeze/game breaking bug in 25 games or maybe even 30. and ive played for about 200hours in total.
---
If someone DC's it should almost count for the challenge depending on the challenge ofc
---
English
---
I see. Good to know.
---
yea
---
I‚Äôd agree if he was face camping. The thing is he was always on a survivor while the other 2 did gens
---
when i needed the endgame unhook, i kept pointing at gate, friend and hook and farming oni wasn‚Äôt getting it until i spam crouched at hook and pointed at friend as the timer was ticking. ended up getting it and leaving with a smidge of the timer left LOL
---
I love that map for this reason right here
---
You get bloody cosmetics. Prestiging is only worth it if you actually want the cosmetic. The increased chance for high rarity items are so low that it‚Äôs basically nonexistent.
---
I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôve gotten into DbD!  Your animations are great.  Any chance you‚Äôd make a DbD video?
---
That slight chance definitely made a difference .
---
Well, the game certainly has such elements (and intentionally as well, there's a reason why unfun tactics are not directly addressed by the devs) if the player(s) wish to torment the other side or their teammates.
---
Personally i don't care about BM so... ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
But judging by the downvotes i'm getting a lot of people have trouble with emotional control and take this game way too personally.
---
I'd say it's worth it for survivors, but less on killers. 
---
Because survivors all have the same abilities, it's not hard to have a backup character that's also a high level.
---
I was playing on my second account as a rank 20 and got matched against a rank 10
---
Payday Jacket is just "fuck shit up and then fuck it up some more"
---
He probably thought you had dance with me? Still funny tho.
---
The louder the music, the better it is.
---
Jane starts twerking
---
Cells are only one account and if you've gameshared the game for example:
---
If you're in EU and gameshared a US version of they game you can't buy cells even if you use the console store because the game and cells currency has to match.
---
DLC gets shared though.
---
Mmmm not sure about that one
---
imo Saboteur isn‚Äôt that great, just bring a really good sabo toolbox and you should be fine. Yui‚Äôs new perk Breakout is really good, gives you Haste when near the killer and your ally will wiggle 20% faster. Look up AaronPlays on YT, one of his recent videos is a sabo build.
---
Right, they're equally good imo
---
Remember: if shit's fucked up but you can still fuck it up some more, it's not fucked up yet.
---
So u want a penalty for a bugged game? Where do many lag switchers exist? Well I‚Äôm not first improved  dedicated serves then penalty
---
One major difference is I DC'd twice yesterday 
---
It wasn't my choosing to DC though, the first one the game crashed on loading and the seccond one was infinite loading screen
---
For a DC system to work the game needs to also work, if the game was relatively bug free then I'd be all for a dc system. But it isn't and people who are gonna dc are just gonna die on hook, while people who crash get the dc penalty
---
A mode where the killer &amp; survivors are in a maze and doing gens open short cuts. But some of the gens that open shortcuts would be optional.
---
Justice for Barb
---
Didn't the Payday devs say that all of their characters, licensed or not, were canon? If that's the case, then Payday Jacket and HM Jacket are (somehow) the same person. But about that "He's a killer, but with "good reason," not a murderer" part. Jacket still killed +300 people just because some jingoistic terrorists told him to do it. Even if it was with "good reason" as you say, Jacket's still a cold-blooded killer in the eyes of the police, mafia, and outside world.
---
It must be different for you, as when I choose to play killer I find a lobby pretty damn near instantly.
---
However survivor, I have enough time to take a small nap, make a sandwich and take a shit before I find a game, and even then 75% of the time it errors out and I have to start all over again.
---
The Hook, when prestiged, will unlock a charm slot for each prestige level
---
Why is this upvoted so much? He's wrong. 
---
It blocked a *single* hit and then never works again.
---
So ghostface
---
wraith with noed
---
Thats just swell
---
Only if you want the bloody cosmetics. 
---
I only p3'ed claudette as i don't like any of her skins. My ace remains without prestige since i like his suit
---
just follow the blood with 93% move speed around walls when they just go a lot of distance from hitting them and nurse being fatigued LOOOL
---
You know what would really teach those Dirty killers a lesson? Stop playing.
---
Also. If a survivor is just hanging on a hook leave them if they are flailing there arms pull them off.
---
Also let them hang. Focus on generators. Always try to pull them off just before next phase in sacrific.. that's is the only time you can unhook in front of killer is if its before the 2nd phase or death. Might as well try at that point.
---
Love it when they fake you out, like take you to the hatch and then go to a hook instead. Ok? Cool dude super legit power move
---
I've had a lagswitcher like that Myers but instead the guy lagged himself out. It was pretty funny and if I could find that I would.
---
Yh
---
It's pretty fun most of the time. Very frustrating the other time. But since we still play it it is safe to assume that we find it more fun than not.
---
I say this as a solo player, with friends it's probably more fun though.
---
Thank you!
---
I really enjoy this game. It can be competitive and casual at the same time. It's a ton of fun with friends who you can mess around with. The game is still somewhat alive and lobby times aren't great but people definitely still play.
---
I know Jacket got nuked, but I do think he could work. Remember: The Entity is an emotional vampire. Now take that with some of the lines for Jacket in the [Prison Nightmare](https://payday.fandom.com/wiki/Prison_Nightmare) heist in Payday 2. He says things like *"Your name is not Jacket."* and *"You are responsible."* The clearly indicates that Jacket does feel guilty for something he did. Maybe when Girlfriend was shot and killed in front of him. Maybe he does feel guilty for his killing spree. The Entity can feed off that guilt and make a deal with Jacket just before the nuke reached his cell. But that's just speculation. And honestly, I do think he can be up there with Myers and Krueger. He may not be a Slasher in the traditional sense of the word, but he does remind me of how terrifying The Terminator was in the original film. Just with a Rooster Mask and lots of Synthwave in the background.
---
It's a very fun game, but you should have very strong nerves too. Some players can be extremely toxic
---
This isn't the best place to post but didn't really want to create a new post. I've seen that in chapter 14 they gave a bunch of exclusives for free. I bought the game 2 days ago and didn't get them all, is there something I need to do? Thanks in advance
---
The final survivor who played best deserves to get killed as well. I don't think we will see eye to eye here
---
You know it's actually quite interesting how this game does have a little bit of language psychology into it even if it's completely unintentional people have with so little variety truly discovered a way to communicate without words it's not perfect it's not always clear but most of the time you can sort of figure it out.
---
Thank you! This is exactly what I wanted to know.
---
You forgot "Boop the snoot"
---
I am missing the winter themes this year. Where's my theme tune bells? Snowy Xmas lights on hooks? Not even hard to do as they've done it most years. BHVR need to be more creative I think. Halloween event was rubbish. Just carry on getting vials through the rift....
---
okay yeah i was looking at that. do you think he is a top tier player? will hex ruin and b&amp;c work on him? thanks
---
honestly,the dbd community is more toxic than the league community at times  
---
and i played league for the better part of 6 years.that is fucking mindboggling
---
is ghostface a top tier killer? also what exactly does his power do?
---
Yeah true haha. I was kinda dumb ^^`
---
It wouldn‚Äôt really be disrespectful and it takes less than a minute if you go to photos, press edit, and crop the made with mematic part out. If you have an iPhone then that‚Äôs what you do.
---
If played right he's really quite good imo, his power let's him lose his tr and you can stalk people to make them one shottable for I believe 45 seconds or a minute
---
I feel like his face needs to be moved down a couple inches.
---
Haha, serves him right
---
If I think the last survivor wasnt an ass or useless to their team I give em hatch.
---
If someone unhooks close to me Ill ignore whoever was on the hook, and go for the person that couldnt wait a few seconds for things to be safe before potentially ruining their team mates time.
---
I set my name to ‚ÄúKiller Pls Read Bio‚Äù then just said I was willing to help them with their challenges if they let me do 4 gens in my steam bio lol
---
If a survivor does that to me I literally CANNOT kill them :(((( in general I usually get people to death hook and feel bad and let them all escape but if they crouch and look up it‚Äôs game over for me
---
okay thanks. it‚Äôs just i was using a couple killer (for example) the wraith and was doing good without any perks yet. but as i started to get up to single digit ranks i was struggling against good players and teams. disregarding what i said about my prefrencing what killer do you think are the best for a high rank and is ghostface one of them?
---
If you ever have questions as to how someone formats their comments, use the "source" button right under the comment.
---
Exactly this ^^ after a while though you just grow numb to the toxicity, then it's just fun.
---
And there will be 3 toolboxes, with every survivor EXCEPT the run you found having gen build whilst also somehow having dead hard, ds, by, and adrenaline. Also, the map will have only safe pallet spawns.
---
Speaking of lag a few posts below  yours, there's a Nea that had the same thing that happened to you. When did they say they're adding servers to console?
---
I play survivors mainly, but when I kill, I won't hook for the first 2 minutes. I never camp hooks, and never  chase the same person twice (although 2 survivors same skin... mistakes will be made).
---
What rank are you and what do you play on? I experience this every once in a while and when I do it sucks horribly, but it's one 1 in every 7 killers or so. Other matches are really fun with killers trying to maximize points by changing targets and intentionally not tunneling. Try not to rope a whole group of people together just because of some personal bad experiences. Hope your games get better though my dude
---
Balance favors survivors, especially if they‚Äôre playing SWFs. The game is designed around casual solo play without communication, so when players use it the balance swings in their favor. On top of that a lot of maps favor survivors over a majority of the killers. While you can play any killer to rank 1 and stay there that‚Äôs more on the person playing the killer and not the viability of said killer. 
---
You take the sweatiest rank 1 killer (not using something like iri head and ebony mori) and put them against a sweaty rank 1 decked out survivor SWF 4 stack, the survivors are most likely going to win, unless the killer is vastly better or playing something like Spirit.
---
In the end though, the biggest issue with the game is honestly map design. There are a lot of maps with very survivor friendly loops that can cost a killer 1-3 generators before they can catch said survivor. Elementary school, haddon, ironworks with the god window to name 3 off the top of my head.
---
I‚Äôm a killer main that has been putting in quite a bit of time on survivor lately and god damn if playing survivor isn‚Äôt already vastly easier. I‚Äôve had plenty of games where 1 of my teammates ran the killer for like 3 gens and the killer never even chased me once. Or games where the killer just wants to farm and I don‚Äôt have to actually play well. And I‚Äôm a fucking potato that‚Äôs clearly boosted to rank 10 in like a day of playing survivor. I‚Äôve now put in like 50 hours on survivor and all I can say is survivor is boring as shit 50% of the time cause killers don‚Äôt try. But naw, it‚Äôs killers that want ez kills.
---
No clue. Hope it's soon
---
Brenda from Scary Movie
---
Why
---
Not just that, but survivors have others means of escape besides the doors. Killers have to worry about hatch, keys, etc. we are talking 1 situation where the killer is favored, and even then a key can negate that advantage with potentially 0 counterplay, as this video shows.
---
Spirit, hillbilly and freddy are probably the best across the board but I'd say ghostface is probably the 5th best killer if played well
---
*demogorgon
---
I can agree with that. But I must say that a specific ranked mode where it‚Äôs only solo would be very beneficial. Plus having public (or player) mode would allow people to play with new characters without punishment. The bp modifier would only influence more toxicity to gain more bp.
---
Knowing the devs, it will turn into a soon‚Ñ¢
---
Welp, then mission accomplished. I'm glad I didn't take it down now
---
Story time
---
Last night, Christmas night, I ran into this exact type of lobby. And I assumed they were just dressed for the Christmas occasion. 
---
But after downing one and half chasing another, I come back to the killer shack and there they are.
---
4 little Dwelves all crowded around about 5 items that they brought and also collected like little presents for me the killer.
---
Of course we farmed and I let them escape. We all sent merry Christmas messages and it was wholesome
---
Devotion literally says nothing about your skill. What if you got devotion 10 playing only killer and then play survivor for the first time? You will be the looping god? I think not.
---
If they got a lot of distance that means they were running which means you can see scratch marks... lol
---
Nurse has 96.25% movement speed.
---
Or the final survivor that did jack shit deserves to get killed as well. We won‚Äôt see eye to eye cause you don‚Äôt want to see that a survivor shouldn‚Äôt have an unfair advantage.
---
I mean I don't expect it, but it's nice when it happens. Unless I'm doing a mission or something, I usually let one live at the end
---
You're welcome!
---
I think a better option would have them come out with a specifically CO-OP killer.  Where they go only 100% (4m/s) movement speed so they have to work together to get a kill.  That way you dont need to make a whole new game mode, you could just load into a 2v4 lobby. And the survivors wouldn't know before hand.  You could combo this with maybe shapeshifter power because they can already only go as fast as the survivors, so they could be disguised as the other survivors.  But they would still have the slow vault and be pallet stunable.
---
January 2nd for 2 days is not the Xmas holidays.
---
What are they trying to be different for? Everyone else is at Xmas and ends after new year or 10th...
---
Just confuses me as there's no downsides and alot of new players will be on too
---
Yeah I had a killer message me once that I was selfish for escaping. That killers rule book should be just as big.
---
got it, thank you for your time and answers! just trying to get better and learn more about the game. what‚Äôs the 5th killer out of the top 5 you left out?
---
Lmao what? "WTF, why are you winning?"
---
It's a fucking meme. Why people get so offended is insane. Yeah is it biased? Yes. Is it true? Not really. But it's a meme. You can't say anything about survivor mains without them getting mad. It's like a religion.
---
Let your upvotes speak for themselves. :)
---
Ah shit Free Speech strikes again

then you will swear a lot while playing this game. The community is the most fucked up I‚Äòve ever seen
---
Only if he's piloting a Mr.Bean robot
---
~~What do you mean "too much Tool"~~
---
Pretty sure it's because inner strength is unaffected by killer slowdown perks and nurse's calling. Also because you should be cleansing dull totems as soon as you see them anyways in the event of NOED, not just because you have inner strength. Personally, I don't run any self heal perks and just run iron will and spine chill, so I have a chance against stealth killers, and get to walk around the map not having to worry about my loud ass moaning.

---
Or splinters. It's like, I just wanted to play Freddy before I buy him.
---
I‚Äôm someone who refuses to farm. I‚Äôll dc if it‚Äôs not going to be a normal game and the killer refuses to engage in normal gameplay.
---
I really don‚Äôt get mad at the killer for anything. I usually get mad at my teammates if they play like asswipes. 
---
Sandbagging someone gets me mad or when someone is looping the killer around a person on a hook are the only things that get me mad
---
It‚Äôs even more disrespectful when they butt dance in your face to assert dominance and leave u behindüòî
---
You know, I never got that. As a killer, I can't see the fun in standing still in front of someone for half the game. That's just me I spose, cause I hate doing that in any game, but still. It takes away just about every aspect of the game.
---
Or do that pretend to unhook sht to make u spam the noise and run off, like i healed you what is this anime betrayal
---
Everyone here talking about how cute the pig and huntress noises are but can I get some love for the clown?
---
Drop a heavy ass pallet on his head and all hes gonna do is laugh it off and keep moving
---
It's a lesson we all need.
---
Not saying for farming, but at the end of the game. Like if the survivor played well, or just cause I feel bad or something
---
you can never win with some people. you kill them you get hate mail, you let them live you get hate mail
---
Tbh I would‚Äôve just dodged the lobby when I got that message. Don‚Äôt like doing it, but when I get matched with SWF the killer sweats so hard and I just get punished for being matched with them They honestly just sound very entitled. Idk how they‚Äôre gonna expect you to take all of the killers attention, and then not save you. Sounds like they were the ones not playing right.
---
I will run as far away from basement as possible but I won't do that. that's so toxic.
---
Would it be possible to change the sound of the killers heart beat in the game files to whatever audio we want?
---
MY FUCKING SHIT INTERNET THATS BEEN SO SLOW I HAVEN‚ÄôT BEEN ABLE TO PLAY IN DAYS
---
queue spongebob throwing the book into the fire
---
Why are you so worried about ‚Äúis he a  top tier killer‚Äù in every comment. Just play the game and have fun lmao
---
When you turn a corner as far as the nurse knows the scratch marks no longer exists. She doesnt want to chase around the corner to see where the scratch marks lead. She wants to blink through the wall right away. Also when the nurse is fatigued she cant see where the survivors going from looking down at the ground. She uses sound to determine where to look for her next blink. So take that away from her and she loses a lot of tracking ability
---
I‚Äôm dumb and tired completely misread all this. my bad bro.
---
Nah, you're good man lol
---
It‚Äôs a fun game, but first starting out is very difficult. Your characters have hardly any perks and a lot of the strategies are easier said than done and take practice.
---
because i want to know the best killers, just trying to pick one so i can master it. i‚Äôm the type of guy who if i‚Äôm not winning in a video game i‚Äôm not having funüòÇüòÇ
---
ah okay i see, thank you!! going to try ghost face now with no perksüòÇ
---
Not sure. Going to try and pick one up today or tomorrow and test it. If so that would be ideal.
---
r/pyrocynical
---
If you have friends who play you should get it. Preferably when it‚Äôs on sale but the game can be very frustrating when youre by yourself.
---
That has got to be one stupid fucking nurse. At that point the survivor would be to far away to hear anyway. You can catch up easily anyway with a long blink. You want to have LOS on the survivor to not waste a blink and time. Using sound is good and using iron will will fuck with a good nurse at first ,but after that you just follow blood if the player didn‚Äôt run or just follow scratch marks and confirm LOS.
---
If you put in the time and effort and the struggles to master nurse you‚Äôll seldom lose, especially around green ranks :) she has none of the things youre looking for but is the easiest killer to kill people with once youve mastered her.
---
Turning a corner won‚Äôt lose you too much distance.
---

I'd say it's still the killers fault because they successfully prevented you from escaping.
---
yeah i‚Äôve heard she‚Äôs godly. haven‚Äôt got matched up against her yet only tier 10 as a surviors just got the game a couple weeks ago but really into it. maybe one day i will try her, do you use her?
---
Vommy Mommy is one big (tall, not fat) cutie.

If I see 4 toolboxes in the lobby and I don't feel like being an asshole with a Mori I'll use a Shroud to make sure they don't just Quad BNP and tap the first gen in 20 seconds.

Its horrible.

Which is why you should get the Soulja Boy Console version instead.

Doesn‚Äôt make a difference to the overall gen pressure they create though and means that you only find one of them at a gen
---
You found the key to victory
---
I agree!!!! Lmaooo

New Survivor: Mr. Krabs
---
Why would you do this to the Best Girl. :(
---
Idk man it gets pretty annoying when you bring BPS with a killer you are leveling and/or learning and then get straight bullied by toxic survivors. 
---
Same goes for the other side but I dont use Bps on survivor unless I'm in a 4man and then at least all my friends got the bonus
---
If this is the first time you‚Äôve reached purple ranks, then unfortunately many of the players there probably have many more hours than you do. ie I hit purple for the first time &lt;50 hours but many players had 500-1000+. 
---
So I think there could definitely be an experience, skill, and perk gap between you and them such that it feels impossible. 
---
I would just keep at it. Over time you‚Äôll learn how to more efficiently approach abd mindgame all the different loops and tiles.
---
That‚Äôs the way it is sadly, some killers just can‚Äôt compete as certain ranks, they just don‚Äôt have the map pressure to do so, most of the top tiers have teleports to deal with gens, I like clown as well but as soon as I hit red ranks I don‚Äôt touch him.
---
My friend started pasting that into the chat in For Honor as a joke
---
I've been considering doing it in endgame chat
---
Sometimes they don't even have to DC, as soon as they've clicked to what you are doing they will just run to the opposite side of the map and stay there, meaning you can't bring them back no matter how much you try. Kinda lame really, they'll throw the game away just so you can't get a challenge.
---
Basically this.
---
Now I‚Äôm really sad, all the top killers I don‚Äôt like at all, I hope they find a way to change it
---
Haha of course!
---
working in that I don't want to ever play the game?
---
;)
---
Did they DC as well?
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong all killers can be good but compare oni to Hillbilly for example they do the same thing but Hillbilly is far far better them Oni, and clown is just a weaker snare Freddy.
---
you're talking about it
---
people who previously hadn't heard of it have now heard of it
---
they may or may not play it, and may or may not spread the knowledge of this game's existence to other people who had not heard of it before
---
Working in the sense that you know them, and that was their goal. Everyone remembers them now. Not that I disagree that its a shitty game though.
---
Imagine not being able to dodge a killer by being able to walk faster. This post was made by Fixated gang.
---
Okay let me break it down, at higher ranks the survivors are over powered, you run into more swfs, and in general stronger killers must be played to win. 
---
The game is balanced so that solo survivors (which make up more than just the majority of the player base) have fun. If it‚Äôs almost impossible for a solo survivor to escape, then the majority of the players wouldn‚Äôt have fun and they‚Äôd quit. So, the devs have to buff up survivors for solo players. 
---
However, I‚Äôve heard from big DBD streamers (however reliable they may or may not be) that the devs are trying to give survivors more communication so that solo survivors act more like swfs. Once this has been implemented, they can either nerf survivors or boost killers so that it‚Äôs more balanced.
---
Lifting the pallets?! What a good idea!
---
I guess that's true, but who values it more?
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve had about 50 hours of playing the game too hehe~ but yes I‚Äôll try to practice! And hopefully get better perks, however I don‚Äôt want to feel forced to use perks just to win, like a lot of people use Hex Ruin and whenever I play survivor occasionally and I go against it I just get annoyed hehe~ I don‚Äôt want to make the survivors I go up against be annoyed (plus it means I‚Äôd have to play hag to get it but I don‚Äôt like hag)
---
These challenges man... It made me lose all my sanity then regain it immediately in the next match only to make me lose it again many many many times.
---
You know those dirty survivors don't deserve mercy. They all grow up to immerse or use Adrenaline, DS, Dead Hard, and Unbreakable.
---
I also play Oni too... I‚Äôm kinda annoyed all my favourite killers are the weakest
---
Billy?
---
Keys brought into a lobby are fine. Keys out of chests are bullshit.
---
Imagine if a killer could just pull a Mori out of a chest. Or another Ruin totem could just pop up after you cleansed it, all based on RNG.
---
It is, but NOED can cease to exist if you cleanse all the totems beforehand.
---
I'll just excuse myselfüò≥
---
I was so hyped for Demogorgon, I try my best but struggle, then I pick Freddy and steam role.
---
I got really lucky on this challenge cause the first person got downed dc in the first 10 seconds so Bubba decided to be nice and let us all escape. Without him, I would have never gotten this challenge done.
---
If this game had a casual mode, sure, but locking someone out of the entire game for the duration of 1-2 good matches due to something that might not of have been their fault is ludicrous.
---
That's just how dead by daylight is. The game is balanced in a way but not for everyone. You'll notice that some people say killer is OP and some will say survivors are OP, but really, it's that killers are OP in lower ranks and transition to survivors being more OP in higher ranks. You'll have to find out ways to cut down on time. Mind games when looping is very important at higher ranks. And of course, tunneling will cut down major time, but it is overwhelmingly hated by the DbD community. But if you want to be time efficient, having one less person on the field is debatably essential at higher ranks.
---
What if you mori someone who has never been hooked with devour? Then will you still have the green mori cause it only works on prehooked survivors? Or maybe that guy you got down second had never been hooked so he wasn't mori-able?
---
Maybe they should start doing a bloodpoint penalty for  intentional DCing. One that gets progressively more costly.
---
YES
---
I‚Äôll keep this in mind and use them all for memeing
---
Dance with me isnt even that good either. It only works after a fast vault.
---
Nah it is a file change though. You can find it on r/PerkbyDaylight
---
Crouch repeatedly in the killer's view to convey that you are new and wish for an easier time
---
Yeah I knew with how fast spirit can move and how close the gates spawned I didn't have a chance at opening a gate, was a lucky find!
---
How do you determine the game is survivor sided, when literally no official stats back that up &amp; when you can't provide me with even one example of someone who can escape at will?
---
\*MY BRAND!\*
---
Alright, thanks
---
When he shock you, you cant drop pallets or use windows
---
yea survivors could've just ragequit but they had the audacity to stay in the match. How dare they...
---
I second this, as stated by lore, whenever someone new is drawn into the fog, they‚Äôre surrounded by a thick fog after which they awaken next to the campfire without any recollection of how they got there. 
---
I assume this is also how they are pulled into the trials.
---
I used empathy and a broken key with gold token and prayer beads. Finished the challenge in one game ezpz.
---
The pig for a snoot boop its awesome trust me
---
Stolen content?
---
Me, with all 3 of my crappy charms from the basically empty free track:  "Gee, what a tough decision."
---
I‚Äôll make a few bold assurances that not everyone here might agree with.
---
Firstly, all killers are viable at red ranks. I‚Äôve went rank 10-1 multiple times using only a single killer including Hag, Myers, Pig, and Plague. You might not win every game (as you shouldn‚Äôt) but you can succeed most games if you play better than the survivors. 
---
Secondly, Ruin isn‚Äôt necessary but it does directly help your lightbringer emblem without having to personally put pressure on the survivors. Other perks like Corrupt Intervention and Pop work just as well or better depending on the killer or map.
---
Yeah, and that's not even that uncommon. Great matchmaking system amirite
---
Can you give any tips for plague? At the moment she‚Äôs my favourite, I actually only got her yesterday huhu~ I don‚Äôt know what to really do with her however, the only times I even win are usually when I have to 3 gen
---
If survivors are team dependent and most teams fail, one survivor being exceptional at looping isn't proof of anything except that one person is good at surviving.  How do you determine that the game is survivor sided if no official data backs that up &amp; when there are virtually no examples of people who can escape at will?
---
Apology accepted lol
---
*screams in wraith elephant noise*
---
You can alt F4 before the match loads and nobody gets a penalty.
---
A creepy 'come here' emote for killers. Just think about coaxing the new and naive to their death.
---
What I like to do, although I‚Äôm playing with/against red ranks almost always, if a survivor unhooks without BT really close, I‚Äôll hit the unhooked survivor (bc I think they have BT) and if they don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll slug em until they get picked up. And not wiggeling and not bring a total asshole, hatch
---
All good. They're pretty cute. No Feng though. :(
---
They should have made it get x amount of basement hook sacrifices in any trial. Or just make it 2 sacrifices in a single. At least with the dark sense challenge you can somewhat convince/rely on your teammates, and not the opponent you are literally trying to win against...
---
Ran into several randoms doing the challenge and been 99ing gens. Only successful once but dam was he/she happy lmao
---
They lived a happy life after a bit of farming because of the DCs
---
i.e. you can just ragequit the match instantly without getting punished, even better.
---
As of now no, but they have mentioned they are looking into, and even asked about it in their last survey
---
Had 3 games in a row today with DCs, so annoying
---
I get it, keys take away the fun from killer and moris do the same to survivors, it was just some lucky rng as to why I escaped, I didn't think the odds of me finding a skeleton key in the first chest I searched were very high so thought it was worth a share :)
---
good job my dude!! glad you‚Äôre enjoying it!
---
Aha, a main survivor... like, looping skill depends on character
---
Okay thank you üëç
---
gg piece of shit
---
Thanks for the advice. I'll get like 2 or 3 stuns then the killers just respect every pallet after that.
---
You should see clown's lol
---
Do you mostly play killer, or do you play survivor as well?
---
I feel u I wanna buy it on the pc and I have all the dlc on the xbox so I'm waiting I guess
---
If they DC during the loading screen then it‚Äôs fine since no one else gets punished. At that point It‚Äôs the same thing as killers who lobby dodge.
---
Oh, I only killer for the challenges or if a friend wants to watch... so I will face camp a teabagger and laugh.  Because holy shit I don't care enough about 1 game's pip.  Especially of they teabag late, i typically end up just not losing the pip
---
r/jesuschristreddit
---
Yeah I may try and add on some of the others. I‚Äôd like a shape, spirit, legion, and a huntress. 
---
And a feng, kate, and ace.
---
Bruh moment
---
Sabotaged **hooks** will **respawn** after three minutes have elapsed.
---
Holy exaggeration batman
---
&gt; on console we have zero options to communicate with each other, we have no option for voice- or text-chat
---
We are the same on PC?
---
Yeah maybe you could get the option to put legions hood down
---
Then you would probably get some hate mail hehe~ but yeah it‚Äôs certainly nice to kill a tea bagger, they are just provoking you for no reason! They are probably wanting me to go after them on purpose but by God am I going after them... until they die hehe~
---
Every time, and then he tries to give hatch anyway
---
Realistically, though not everybody will be able to activate MoM.
---
I don‚Äôt play killer much but I was playing wraith on thompson house. Jake sabo‚Äôd my hook at the top of the house and I couldn‚Äôt get him anywhere. So I said fuck it, I left him there and went and found someone else. She disconnected as soon as she was hooked. I then got THREE VOICE MESSAGES from this woman who sounded at least 45 years old telling me that I was playing like a douchebag, that I ruin the game for everyone else that wants to play, and that ‚ÄúOH I CAN STILL SEE YOU, DOESNT THAT BUG SUCK?‚Äù (I‚Äôm wraith dumbass you‚Äôre supposed to see a shimmer) that I have a problem with losing, I shouldn‚Äôt play this game if I couldn‚Äôt take losing. All because I left the jake slugged because all he was doing was running back to the top of the house because there was nowhere to hook him at.
---
I just want to know how to let survivors know I'm farming, because I can slap the gen however many times I want but they still flee from me. I have to chase one down first and then slap the gen while they're doing it, and that usually only gets one of them to follow the program.
---
I guess that‚Äôs true
---
????? What do I say??? Thx I guess??
---
Ummm... I think we can end this discussion now
---
I've had way worse than this lagging on PS4. Literally impossable to get anywhere when it keeps lagging back every 2-4 secends and the killer has audacity to complain when I dc.
---
It would help if everyone didn't hide the instant I hook someone. If I go to 3 generators with no one there and then see the unhook and go back then the unhooker is nowhere to be seen, well the only person to go after is the one that I can hear is injured.
---
Read it....?
---
Yep!
---
I mean, if you're hiding so much that the other survivor keeps getting chased and no Gens are getting done because you're too scared to come out, then yeah he's going to point at you.
---
What did you think when you made this thread? Something like "Let's ask the Dead by Daylight subreddit if Dead by Daylight is a fun game"? What kind of answers did you expect?
---
yeah, while my p3 pencil is not allowed.
---
Played a game where the spirit was trying to farm, hooked me and my teammate crouched in a corner til I died 8)
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs a big problem sometimes because Killers might bait you with a farm invitation in order to get a cheeky hit in because they‚Äôre underperforming, so many times the survivor will not trust a farming gesture or not know what it is. What I like to do is slap the air several times while standing still, making them come closer and then stopping to attack.
---
If that doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôll down one, carry them to a gen, slap it, let them go, profit. Once other survivors see you running around with your new found buddy, they‚Äôll catch on quickly enough!
---
I don‚Äôt know about emotes but if I could spam roar at survivors as I‚Äôm chasing them I‚Äôd be down
---
Ghostface is, on ps4 at least, the most common killer. You'll be fine. Ruin and B&amp;C works on literally every single killer.
---
Literally all you need is a 4man it's not that hard. They don't all have to be amazing or anything just 99 the gens and let whoever needs the challenge pop em
---
Oni is top tier for me. He's basically chainsaw billy and myers mixed together but better.
---
Your not getting out if I get 3 dcs and catch you. Sorry I have already lost to many points. Now if I get 3 kills because of horrible teamates farming without Bt and such.  I will let last person go. Also if I slug and find other person at hatch. Sometimes I will kill hatch camper and let other one go. Just depends how much I feel they helped there team. And I show no mecry to immersive players or people that walk everywhere. I have lost way to many games on the other side from teamates just urbaning around the map. To use there Sprint burst to make there chase last 10 more secounds.
---
Add ons make a huge difference on her. The ones that increase the vile purge effectiveness are particularly strong because they can put survivors in the broken state pretty fast. Free corrupted pools can be pretty useful. The pink add on that provides aura reading is ridiculous depending on the map and survivor playstyle. If you fins yourself running out of add ons but you want to keep ranking up, you can always switch to survivor to get extra BPs.
---
I like playing her with the BB build (BBQC, ruin, enduring, spirit fury) because red rank survivors often don‚Äôt cleanse. It does rely heavily on efficient pathing and mindgames during windowed/long wall loops.
---
Overall, I think she has a high skill ceiling similar to Huntress depending on add ons and perks so I find her rewarding to play.
---
&gt;It seems like DBD is one of the few online multiplayer games that don‚Äôt have a strong DC penalty. It‚Äôs weird considering that DCs hurt the match flow in this game more than most others.
---
I don't know of any other online game that has DC penalties on their casual modes.
---
You scared the crap out of me I didn't saw it was you and I was wondering why my house was on there subdienei
---
I was on hook, my friend was near by waiting for ghostface to leave when he accidentally found someone else
---
it gets worse and worse. Need to turn off receiving messages from strangers. Makes it a bit more enjoyable
---
&gt;there's already a time penalty and it doesn't do shit because now they just suicide on hook which means survivors are just not given compensation anymore AND the killer gets any hook based bonuses like BBQ plus all their hook points
---
There isn't... Does no one read what devs post or at least the in-game news pop up? 
---
It was just a test and it ended on 19th.
---
Eat a Snickers  Freddy. You're not you when you're hungry.
---
For context I was playing Ghostface. I was trying to relearn his abilities the entire game and stalking people. For reference, I did get one hook kill. This guy in particular with one of hos buddies kept blinding me with flashlights and teabagging me/blocking hooks, etc. His other friend sent me hate mail about tunneling. Like ????
---
This is the most likely reason this game will die. Because the game‚Äôs so toxic it puts off new players from touching it again.
---
Sometimes I get annoyed when they cleanse because it also heals them, but luckily I get super buffed, however by the time they cleanse it‚Äôs probably about only 2 gens left
---
That‚Äôs one major issue with the ranking system, you reach a rank with a wall, because players are a higher skill, killers don‚Äôt know what to do exactly. Scott has a video on the tiles and how to deal with them. Not sure who else but mostly experience to know mind games at them and such.
---
&gt; Xbox Beta PC app
---
What is this exactly?
---
The tripaloski gang
---
They probably disabled the pvp modes because nobody even has Xbox One lmao
---
instead of one insta gen. its 4. you played yourself
---
tbh yeah fair
---
If your game is still downloading, you‚Äôre going to have to wait for the download to complete, unfortunately.
---
 [https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/pc-games](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/pc-games)
---
killer emotes, yes please.
---
Whoever fits your playstyle the best.
---
counterstrike and league of lengends to name two
---
of course!! the ps4 takes wonderful videos so why would i want to use my phone and make it a shitty quality üòÇ
---
Oh ok phew
---
&gt;counterstrike and league of legends to name two
---
On their CASUAL modes? First time I heard of this.
---
Stop playing shit killers like Legion, Plague and Clown and start playing good killers like Spirit and Freddy.
---
Shrine of secrets
---
yes. casual mode for cs shares the same cd as their comp mode and in league if you dc too much, you will be banned. but like i said i fail to see why the casual mode thing matters as dbd doesn't have a casual mode
---
This could be nice screensaver ü§îü§î
---
big oof moment
---
League of legends and Overwatch have DC penalties for their casual modes. And I wouldn't consider DBD's main mode only mode to be a "casual mode", since it's the main mode of the game and it's literally ranked.
---
And that‚Äôs why I think they need to do something about the game because I don‚Äôt like how I‚Äôm basically forced to play certain killers to win
---
If you are on PC, you can remove this entirely. It even allows your game to launch faster.
---
Cleansing is only good for you if you can use the corrupt purge effectively. Practice wildly moving your head left and right to cover an entire area with your vomit rather than a narrow stream. Trajectory also takes practice. Once again though, learning efficient pathing will probably help you more than anything for deciding when and where to start charging it.
---
One of Oni's perks is good for this. Don't remember the name at the moment... some "enemy" thing.
---
Nemesis I think
---
I know right, the best ones are when someone takes a picture of something in editing software with their phone.
---
It's a casual game, and sometimes life is difficult.
---
Message the killer and see if they‚Äôll let you complete the challenge. Worked for me
---
Do you have any strategies for gen rushing with Plague, sometimes it feels like once I get someone down with her everyone else is just doing gens
---
and league takes it another step forward and outs you on an immediate cd that ramps up really quick for just dodging a lobby no matter the gamemode that is shared across gamemodes
---
Yep. That's the one.
---
You could just try to git gud. Good players like Otzdarva can still steamroll the game with shit tier killers. For now just stick to the good killers.
---
I just explained how they aren't but ok
---
It has nothing to do with difficulty it's just people ruining other's experience because they can.
---
I‚Äôm not good at the good killers...
---
You don't need obsession perks, chances are in most games at least one of the survivor will run a perk that creates an obsession, like DS.
---
Otherwise buy a killer with shards, or the perk directly if it's on the shrine. Nemesis is good in particular for that challenge.
---
I have a bunch of saves and dont have that unhook challenge on. I swear it gets me angry cause the exact opposite happens where im about to save and someone else comes in
---
#WE CALL THIS A DIFFICULTY TWEAK
---
YOU DON'T GET TO GET SALTY AND SEND WHINY MESSAGES ABOUT MY PLAY AFTER YOU RELENTLESSLY TAUNT, TEABAG AND GET FUCKING CAUGHT.
---
DON'T WANT ME TO FACECAMP?? DON'T MAKE ME REMEMBER YOU!
---
You sound like a child.
---
If you're weren't a toxic shit, I will give any last survivor hatch if they don't wiggle
---
If you can, spend the time practicing with diff killers/survivors to see whom you like best. And while playing, turn off messages from strangers. If you play Killer you will get a lot of hate mail.
---
There were Splinters for every DLC killer *until* 2.0.0, which gave everyone the option to buy non-licenced killers with Iridescent Shards. Now however, there are only shards for paid killers. All the shards people had previously for original killers before 2.0.0 had them converted into Ebony Moris.
---
set messages to friends only
---
When you need one more save and a random survivor unhooks in front of you
---
See, i just wait on a different window until it launches so as soon as it starts it‚Äôs already too late
---
You have to finished downloading the game/patch.
---
Literally went into my next game as a swf because im tired of trying and this cannibals name was ARCHIVEORDERSSUCK and it brightened my day a little bit asked him if he got it done and he said "don't bother" they just quit. What are the odds lol.
---
The config file you are looking for is called "GameUserSettings.ini". The "DeadByDaylight" game folder that contains config files is usually found under AppData\Local. For the Windows Store version, it might be elsewhere. You could just use the search function on your entire drive and look for the file that way. The properties on that file will then obviously also tell you the file path.
---
There are performance tweak, but base performance depends on your resolution and the graphics quality level. Have you tried reducing graphics quality to low, changing the resolution scale, or your desktop resolution? If that does not make things better, the problem is not performance-related.
---
The thing about the dark sense one is that most games your team tries to gen rush and if they even complete 2 gens without you then you don‚Äôt complete the challenge. It took me two days to get the dark sense challenge. 
---
The pallet one just requires you to get a farming killer, which took me only a few games to do.
---
Go into your setting and turn your messages to ‚Äúfriends only‚Äù useful for avoiding this, turn it back on during events as people like to farm.
---
THE GLITCH THAT ALLOWS SURVIVORS TO HIDE UNDER HOOKED SURVIVORS SO THE KILLERS CANT HIT THEM, BUT HIT THE HOOKED SURVIVOR INSTEAD NEEDS TO BE FIXED. ITS NOT FAIR THAT YOU CAN SIT RIGHT IN MY FACE AND WAIT FOR MY FAILED ATTEMPT AT HITTING YOU JUST TO GET OUT AND IMMEDIATELY USE YOUR BORROWED TIME TO LET THEM ESCAPE
---
Have you changed any of your perk icons ?
---
I knew what I was doing, I had to drop that or I was going down no matter what. I‚Äôm a rank 3 currently but I knew I had to drop that SUUUUPER early because when the killer is laggy you have to predrop because of how long it takes for the pallets to drop, that was also the only pallet I used that entire game because they spawn in very strange places on meat plant and my team used so many of the other pallets, not really a waste IMO but idk
---
Fuck the rank system
---
Personally it‚Äôs better then urban for me other then Hag.
---
I always think it‚Äôs funny when a shitty player tries to use BP as a way of saying they‚Äôre better than me. If that‚Äôs all they can say, I know I won the argument XD. And also the whole juggling survivors on hook pisses me off so much. If they just waited for the killer to be more than 5 feet away from the hook, then they wouldn‚Äôt need everybody to assist. Yet it happens every match for me. I‚Äôm the only one doing gens, and everyone else is being juggled on hook and they don‚Äôt get away til all of them are death hook. This game needs a better ranking system and a better tutorial for new players. I shouldn‚Äôt be matched with players 10 ranks lower than me.
---
Sorry meme police
---
Oooooh I use urban evasion and selfish care. What‚Äôs the negative opinion on it? 
---
I‚Äôm genuinely curious because I use urban to play the killer when they look around a gen or a rock and I use selfish care because it‚Äôs a back up just in case of the situation.
---
That is what it used to be, but right now everyone is waving for no reason so it can not be trusted.
---
I use it for safe rescue
---
Note that I didn‚Äôt sit there at the pallet, I dropped it the second I was able to drop it on the opposite side, your character sits still for a second or two when you have a laggy killer
---
Shit sucks. Any idea why the killer queues are so long? Just too many killers or not enough survivors to go round?
---
Well that's why I was getting the word out
---
That‚Äôs the only source of entertainment I have when I‚Äôm hooked though, besides watching Dwights panic
---
"to be fair" lmao. Im surprised this didnt provoke OP. Good on you, OP.
---
Mandatory "why are you running?" Meme
---
Well not everyone knows that. Right now at least from my perspective its not a universally known thing
---
Thank god I got this challenge out of the way before this whole meme started.
---
Imagine seeing a hook charging at you
---
No, he just incredibly unaware.
---
yea i finally decided to start putting some hours into her.  
---
shes def fun.  just need that bbq chili so i can start chucking hatchets across the map.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve played with people who say it‚Äôs for not safe and people who say it‚Äôs for safe so just play swf lol
---
You could look at reddit while you wait lol
---
THEN I'LL JUST WHINE ABOUT HOW NOED JUST A BABY KILLER TOOL AND TOTALLY OP AND IMBALANCED EVEN THOUGH IT MOSTLY IMPACTS AGGRO SURVIVORS!!
---
First of all thanks for the response! I've tried low settings and still have the issue. Also I opened up task manager and Dead by Daylight is using really low percentage of my GPU, anywhere from 0-20%. I don't have issues like this with any other games.
---
I would recommend it, more players = less wait time.
---
oof. That was... an interesting movie to say the least.
---
I swear been playing for this  game  for the first time for 3 days and i hate claudettes  you  can barely see them  on a dark fucking map and thats one  of my down falls of being  a new player
---
WHAT'S MORE ANNOYING? THE CAMPING KILLER OR ALL OF YOUR ALLIES TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO BAIT THE KILLER INSTEAD OF WORKING ON GENS?!?!
---
Got that one in 2 games rip just keep trying
---
This. Hexes are supposed to be fragile, but not *that* fragile. There's a difference between high risk, high reward, and high risk, meh reward.

Might work on PC but not on console and I'm not spending my free psn name change ticket for 1 challenge. üòí

Damn :D does that work a lot or is it a 1 in a 1000000?

Not if you just stand there

"If you misunderstand any of these, you will be immediately considered a bad killer, and you will be told to uninstall in the end game chat".

My friend refuses to play killer. Says he‚Äôs too much of hippy and feels bad killing people.

Since you dont like ruin try currupt intervention. And do you play nurse on pc or console?
---
Freddy pretty good.  I'm also a fan of ghost face.
---
This is my first time trying it out and I waited until I found a gen that broke los long enough for insidious to kick in before they could see me, but god was it satisfying lol
---
I would settle for getting Scooby Doo cosmetics for already existing survivors. Kate and Daphne would be an instant cop for me.
---
What ones do u not have? If you mean the lunar new year ones they didnt give those ones out.
---
Even though you may have a point the problems we have without disconnect penalties far outweighs than problems with the penalty.
---
Who is that cute Dwighty Boy?
---
That's good. Glad you found something to brighten your day. I gave up on the archives a while ago cuz I knew they'd be ridiculously difficult due to the fact that survivors just won't let you complete then sometimes.
---
Honestly, I hadn't played in a year or so. Last release for me was the grudge one. Idk her name, she just reminds me of the grudge.
---
Anyway, I started playing again. In my first three games, I got atleast 1 message a game. One kid hook blocking and teabagging, or more than one. 
---
With the messages, I feel like that means (if you're not being toxic) you're doing well. I even got a few messages saying gg, and tips on how to do things better as a killer in later games.
---
In essence, this community is like any other. You have your salty sweatys, and your nice sweatys. I think everyone plays pretty sweaty most of the time. Just depends on how you act after.
---
Yeah not even gonna poke at that one.
---
It's not "fun" to be down I'll just dc, its not "fun" to get hooked ill dc.
---
The game has been rewarding survivors for this behavior for so long.
---
Applying pressure is what slows gens, survivors have nothing else to do but gens until someones on a hook. Once someone is hooked this applies pressure and the survivors have to leave gens or they die.
---
As nurse she ignores everything chase wise so once youve found someone, downing one should be easy. If gens are still going fast once you are downing people feel free to slug for bonus pressure if possible.
---
As a Wraith I've had the most success by doing hit and run like tru3 instead of committing to a single chase
---
Hot ü•µ
---
The 28th RuinPop Freddy coming to chase me while spamming M2 at every loop.
---

---
Mikey is tons of fun, and pretty simple too. Fun to play, fun to play against, good perks.
---
There should be like a 4 percent like on the hook for being downed
---
I still maintain that a hex should be moved to the next available dull totem until none are left , that way hexs can last longer and gives survivors more reasons to cleanse adding another objective (kind of )
---
Really now endgame collapse is a thing they should just get sacrificed immediatly that way when a DC occurs. Killer should have some equivelant also
---
I would recommend licensed characters that you can‚Äôt buy with shards. So that would be characters like The Shape, The Nightmare, The Pig, and Ghost Face etc. My personal choice would be The Shape because he has useful perks as well as a fun killer in general!

Honestly id stop caring about some of the harder challenges and just casually play, itl happen eventually and the rewards arent even that good
---
This would not solve all issues. You would still not be able to complete "sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement" challenge for example if DCs just got sacrificed instantly. Neither would you be able to get unhook points as a survivor (yeah DCs fuck over survivors too!).
---
Didney Worl!
---
I'm just getting back into the game, took a long break for awhile cuz life got crazy. When I played last the meta used to be "flailing=not safe" has the meta changed since? I just wanna be up to date haha üòÖ
---
Sounds like the low GPU load is the problem. I haven't heard of that issue with DbD yet, but the Windows Store version could obviously be different. Is your CPU at 100%? Could be a CPU bottleneck too. Not that your processor shouldn't be able to provide relatively good framerates, but maybe there's an issue there.
---
First of all you could try going into the 3D settings for DbD in your NVIDIA control panel, and setting the power management to maximum performance.
---
If that doesn't get the GPU to work, you should try and find the config files. There we can disable V-Sync and increase/uncap the framerate, which might make the GPU respond to the game ("bUseVSync=False" and "FrameRateLimit=0.000000").
---
If the problem persists, try more general tips for low GPU load issues, such as outlined here: https://graphicscardhub.com/low-gpu-usage
---
Freddy is god tier. He is both fun to play and A-Tier.
---
MoM would be fine if it actually always counted protection hits, as it is sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt count them.
---
im on red/purple ranks PC and havent understood the long killer queue times for quite a while now, its the survivor times that are atronomical for me
---
They should get grabbed by the entity and put on a hook. Grants all remaining players 2x bp for rest of the trial. The person who quit loses 50k bp and 2 full ranks. Dc is a plague.
---
God people are obsessed with that challenge, anyway I think an auto quick sacrifice with full points is more than enough, leaving a husk in game just wastes time and is very likely to cause all kinds of bugs
---
Depends on the challenge selected

Yep, I just gen rush and hide. If I play a game it's to play it legit likes it meant. Farming is just cheating for leveling up and boring. Removes the purpose of winning in the game

Have you seen the scene after the credits?
---
The other day I was being healed by, "being healed by being healed by windows being healed by windows being healed by"

That‚Äôs something you‚Äôd never expect. I love it :D
---
notOtzdarva has some great ‚Äúwhich killer/survivor should I level first‚Äù videos, so you might want to consider checking him out on youtube. 
---
If you don‚Äôt have time for vids, though, I‚Äôll give some quick advice (most of which I did myself after watching those vids). If you‚Äôre on console, Feng Min is a great survivor to start with and Hag is a fantastic killer to focus on leveling first. 
---
If you‚Äôre on PC, Bond is an awesome perk for any player, especially beginners, so Dwight would be a great choice. Wraith is very good at farming bloodpoints and relatively easy to learn.
---
This is so accurate. That's how it really be trying to communicate everything under the sun
---
They looking for they little glass vial lol.
---
I feel like not enough players know this but join the discord! There‚Äôs always tons of people trying to setup lobbies and it‚Äôs a good way to make new friends if you‚Äôre looking to have a bit more fun.

---
Fair, but I'm pretty sure the "amarican" is dr. Brenner, because it was confirmed he was still alive
---
I've been using aftercare and prove thy self more and I've started to survive more than wasting a slot on adrenaline
---
Sorry, when I hear fanfic I think smut. I thought you were wanting to write smut with jacket and a dbd character. I thought it was weird but Idk. Sorry, mate.
---
Maybe spirit's ribbons got caught
---
try discordance in your build instead of surveillance, many times what makes gens go so fast is 2 or 3 survivors doing a gen togheter, discordance will prevent that, plus finding 2+ people as nurse is great
---
It's alright. Sometimes I think that too when I find stuff on Wattpad or [Fanfic.net](https://Fanfic.net). Sorry if I sounded harsh too, my guy.
---
shitty ui pack gang

Ruin. You dont have a perk that finds survivors right away like discordance or wispers. So ruin

Yup. I've had that too. One guy in particular is what prompted me to write out my rant cause honestly this challenge is infuriating to complete. I had 20 offerings for haddonfield. Awesome! The map has 1 basement in the exact same location every single time it loads. It's dead ass in the middle of the map. I should be guaranteed this challenge right? I got 2 people killed in the basement. So far so good, 2 left to go! This one jackass that I finally downed after letting him waste every single pallet on the map and let him pallet stun me for points kept escaping from me at the bottom of the staircase. I almost fully regretted not running enduring because he kept running to the same place I downed him at repeatedly. Got to the bottom of the staircase, in sight of the hooks.... escapes. Here we go again 7 times in a row. He ended up dc'ing because "waaaaah you're tunneling so I'm not going to give you a free achievement." Bitch it's your first fucking hook and I haven't been able to even get you on it. Shut the fuck up with that shit. The last dude was fully immersed and didn't do a single gen in the time I was trying to get my challenge done. I quit the match the second he did because what's the fucking point if 1 DC literally voids the entire challenge?
---
The shit happened 15 times prior to that match. It's just infuriating all around. I ended up down 2¬Ω full ranks because of these shit ass entitled, cry baby survivors. 
---
I did end up getting it right after I posted this on the game map. If someone DC's while they're on the basement hook, I found out it counts as a death. If they DC before they're in the basement hook, it won't count.
---
Both man, but recently Im starting to like more the killers
---
Otzdarva has some great killer guides. As for survivors there are some videos by ScottJund that do a pretty good job of explaining looping and that sort of thing. Cheers!
---
Nah he's more of a screech
---
It's not like those perks are actually "bad" (although there are better ones, like Inner Strength and Fixated), they can honestly make you quite flexible, it's just that those perks teach bad habits: 
---
* Self Care encourages you to take unnecessary hits, bEcAuSe I cAn HeAl AnYwAy, which makes you waste time while the killer can apply pressure to the rest of your team
---
* Urban Evasion users usually use it the whole game instead of running, even when the killer is nowhere to be seen, which makes them painfully slow.
---
You cant you had to buy the game before the new update came out
---
I had 4 games in a row today where I had 3 people in the basement already and the last one realized what I was going for and threw the match just run to the opposite of the map and stay there. No gain for them, just to screw me over.
---
I asked them why every time and the only response I ever got was ":)".
---
I hate people.
---
AND I had the psvita and i used it for about a year /2years bc they stopped releasing many games for it :/
---
The book forgot 'Boop the Snoot'
---
Really? I saw a post where they listed it as being given away
---
I just got that one about an hour ago. Don't  give up!
---
Really? I did get some of them, are you sure?
---
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS MATCHMAKING IS JUST BROKEN AF AND NOT GETTING FIXED
---
I‚Äôve already completed the rift I‚Äôve lost motivation haha
---
Had a game today vs a nurse on haddonfield. Finds me first, chases me for a couple mins, has some of the most god awful blinks I've ever seen. I keep her occupied for 2 gens before losing her, alright so far so good.
---
Then someone somehow gets caught and hooked. Then the other two waste so much time trying to unhook that person *in front of the nurse*. They didn't even fucking let her start charging her blink before they ran out and started unhooking. She grabs one from the unhooking process, smacks the other then fucks off to hook her newest catch. So now the whole team is injured. They run her around and do the cat and mouse chase of unhooking each other in front of her, she chases another, hooks them, they unhook in front of her etc. etc. At some point they grow brains and realise, maybe we shouldn't unhook before the killer is even gone and they start living a little longer.
---
 In this time I've done 2 gens. I get up, and go save the one that's currently hooked and heal her, since another teammate is healing and the other is getting chased. Figuring, for whatever reason, I've been matched with baby megs and neas, I ran at the Nurse hoping to distract - she nopes the fuck past me, wants nothing to do with me. I try to take a hit and it works, and for a few brief seconds, she gets greedy and starts following me, then nopes out again. So now I'm injured, and this meg's getting chased aaaaand she's down again and hooked for the 3rd time. The other meg gets caught soon after because she didn't realise our teammate was on death hook and was waiting by for the unhook save. Nice. 
---
I find Nea and heal her ass, with her stupid flashlight that she hasn't used for some reason. She doesn't heal me and just fucking runs off. Double nice. Nurse ends up finding me because Meg moans like a rolling thunderclap. Run her around for so long that I'm dead certain our final chase lasted for half the total game time, no exaggeration. Nea gets the final gen done. Eventually I get caught because at this point she's just tunnelling me. Get hooked for first time, just in time to see Nea open the door and just yeet out of it, not a single spare thought for maybe trying to come back, using her flashlight to blind this nurse and maybe get a save off. 
---
Cut to end game scoreboard, they're all rank 7-8 and this nurse is rank 16. I'm 100% certain they played like boosted apes for some of the unhooking challenges. Delete the fucking rift from the game please.
---
To the killer's credit, she didn't tunnel me until she basically had nothing else left to do, she didn't tunnel the others when they got unhooked, and she self-admitted that her blinks were terrible. So wp to that killer, at least.
---
Right but if you really wanted to couldn't you easily go on the party up thread or the discord or any number of other places and find some people to party up with? Then you could coordinate and complete several challenges quickly.
---
Look at this guy insinuating that I have 3 friends.
---
They changed their minds cuz people had to work for those ones and the ones they gave away were convention exclusives
---
No low rank survivors and no high rank killers- it's too easy to pip as survivor IMO
---
UrBaN EvAsIoN BaD
---
Tbf It's a team game. If you have a terrible team you can't rely on there's literally no way to escape no matter how good you are.
---
ty &lt;3
---
I had a Billy do this. He ended letting 3 of us live (first hooked person sac‚Äôd themself). In end game chat he said ‚Äúhaha tricked you cuties, it wasn‚Äôt a mori‚Äù I just thought it was a really wholesome match. :‚Äô)
---
There is a reason that people dc, because they (in general) don't want to play against unfun things, like basement bubbas, irihead huntress ect.
---
Black Ops 3 did. It banned you for a while if you quit often. I know because I had a bad router at the time and would DC somewhat often lol. Blazblue did but the penalty is incredibly small, some other people have listed a couple.
---
Also, This is essentially the only mode outside of kyf, so it‚Äôs basically a combination of traditional ranked and casual modes. For the game being competitive or not, there are multiple arguments to be made as to why it‚Äôs not competitive. However; the balance state is probably one of the weakest considering that there are game arguably as unbalanced as DBD that were/are still competitive. MvC2 being one of the most obvious examples. In fact, it could be argued that a large chunk of games with competitive scenes are/have been unbalanced but the ones that are relatively balanced get more coverage and or are more popular. Like CSGO, LoL, OW, Siege, etc.
---
Thanks
---
Ok, I agree. You convinced me. =)
---
Go for either of the licensed DLCs you can get Oni with shards
---
Pretty good...
---
And who said everyone here absolutely loves the game? You are the only person who commented sarcastically. "WHaT kInD oF anSWeRs dID YOu eXpECt?"
---
If a survivor isn't being carried they get the EGC collapse animation. If they're being carried they don't disappear until they're hooked or dropped. How about that?
---
I‚Äôve always been scared to try her because of 1 game I got stomped in when I was first starting out. Got a daily for her today and said why not, turned out she‚Äôs really fun! She also has amazing cosmetics
---
Change that image to 5 gruesome cakes and I'm in.
---
Nah, you're good dude
---
That's the joke. It's bait-and-switch humor. The audience expectation for the last frame to be about the killer going full clown is what makes it funny.
---
The thing is,  I think BHVR is slowly losing their understanding of what "fun" is. These challenges are most definitely not fun. They're the complete opposite; sweaty and hard and miserable (in b4 that's what she said joke). I say this with the highest disrespect: whoever came up with them is a dumbass and should never, ever, *ever* have control of what goes into the game ever again.
---
It's an extremely short  period,  and he self slows too much. Good survivors aren't going to let him close enough to do that.
---
And then there's those dicks that DC to ruin your basement challenge, or cause they got downed first or something. It's a really annoying thing to balance.
---
the nice thing with monitor and piggy is that if whispers procs on and you crouch, monitor has reduced your terror radius enough to where it will have faded completely by the time you reach the survivors, catching them totally off guard.
---
I think so atleast that what my friend told me and she really likes the game
---
Usually if I run from a friendly killer it's cuz they already murdered my SWF group and I'm not playing their little games. Murder us all like a man or farm bloodpoints, but being nice to ONE of us is not cool, those are my homies and they were hunted mercilessly! I'm not befriending the killer at that point xD
---
"How to be a friendly killer" I may need this book, I have so many hate comments on my steam profile from that time I got rank 1 on hag. People didn't like me D: its like c'mon guys I just want to kill you a little!

They were hoping the timer would kill them since there probably weren‚Äôt any hooks nearby
---
If you run you 'for sure' die? What?
---
Had this before but with a Freddy, literally hit me when I was 10 feet away from the pallet lol
---
Very fun. Hate when I get farm messages. I just lobby dodge cos farming is boring, and the killers just try hard if you don‚Äôt farm.
---
I wasn't referring to start-of-game DC's, I was talking about mid-game DC's. If you read my earlier post, it was all about "looking into your internet stability".
---
Besides, why should casual mode punish more than ranked mode? If anything, ranked mode should punish more.
---
yeah, as a console player, this doesn't happen much but it gets frustrating when it does. killer never understands how mm works so they say it's your fault. can't wait for dedicated servers
---
I would also recommend Fungoose, has some nice games with explanations and analysis for both sides of the game. Painreliever, OhTofu and Ussylis are good too. Also gonna plug Spacecoconut because I'm a hag player and he's probably the one streamer to really help me play hag properly.
---
Ghost face
---
I'm a rank 1 killer and I can find lobbies in literally 5-10 seconds.
---
Fucking galaxy brain.
---
Looks like he used the force to hit me
---
Talking about when a killer has downed the last survivor and is trying to let them open the exit gates, or similar situation. If I'm carrying you to the exit gate, and you keep trying to run away (from me and the gate) after I let you wiggle free, eventually I'm gonna stop trying to let you get the gate
---
You do realize if you used Kindred your problem wouldn't exist? Just like any other issue in this game (besides DC)  you have to sacrifice a perk slot to counter it.
---
Yeah, this is big brain time
---
Happy Cake Day btw :D
---
Yeah but if we all agreed on this you would never have to use kindered
---
OwO thank you!
---
Finally the buff killers needed!
---
I just find it so weird how you leave out things from that game like the tunneling or the hovering around the basement and don't even get me started about the end game chat where you said "see you on front page." Like I get it things like that challenge are hard and survivors DCing definitely doesn't make it any easier but when u go and say  
---
The game has been rewarding survivors for this behavior for so long. 
---
WHEN THAT WASN'T even the problem. The problem I had personally is that you hit 3 other people then chased the one person who was hooked in basement when you just injured 3 other people.
---
THEN YOU GO AND SAY THINGS LIKE  " im getting ready to just name and shaming twitch channels. " Shame for what exactly? me dying? or head ons? or was it the body blocking to try and save my teammate?   
---
TLDR: Please if you're going to rant about something and say you're going to shame them at least be willing to be honest and genuine about what happened.
---
the plague looks so pretty
---
I‚Äôm gonna buy it with the free 1k cells from this rift because I like the free cosmetics
---
Well, I'm both rank 1 on killer and survivor. Killer lobies are instant for me, survivor queue room is the real problem for me.
---
I'm at tier 69 right now, and will get to max level later tonight. Even though I have made back my investment, I probably won't buy the next Rift pass unless they reduce the grind needed.
---
This comment is adorable. You are very proud of yourself.
---
I'm at level 55 now. All the killer challenges have long since been done and I'm left with the grindy/bullshit survivor challenges. With just pure game time I'm looking at another ~30 hours of gameplay to finish the rift... and I've been burnt out since like 15 levels ago. Basically the same as you. Instead of giving the game new life, it just made it more irritating. Survivor side, you're dealing with at least 50% trappers, and with chapter 4 add in basement builds every other game that are just super fun to go against. Killer side, you're dealing with challenges that make you play like an ass and use useless or dumb perks for no real reason. Not getting your challenge done just adds another layer of frustration over losing or having a bad experience. I've let all the survivors live in several games and it's not that rare to have one of them moan about not getting their challenge done. Pile that on with getting back to back shitty yamaoka maps or mount ormond or variants of maps with the god window open... ugh.
---
And yet with all of that I still want to get those last 15 levels. I feel like I have to since I've already invested the $10 and all the game time. And I'll probably do it to myself all over again with the next rift. I can only hope they're watching people's overall progress and listening to what people say and then make adjustments to the time it takes to complete the rifts for the future.
---
I'm on Xbox
---
The DBD port is not as bad as people make it out to be. There are times that there are frame rate drops but it‚Äôs kind of rare and doesn‚Äôt happen often. It‚Äôs almost the same exact experience you would find on PC and PS4/XBOX. The only big difference is that Freddy and Quentin are not on the switch yet due to licensing issues and the graphics, which aren‚Äôt that bad  I‚Äôm not really sure if it‚Äôs smoother on the Switch lite or not since I own the switch that came out two years ago. Also sometimes updates do take a little longer to come out on the switch because BHVR isn‚Äôt familiar with the console or nintendo. Updates will either come out on release day like other consoles or it will come out a week later due to them stumbling upon problems (this happened when they added the archives into the game). I definitely recommend getting DBD for the switch and a switch for other games, you won‚Äôt regret it!!
---
Hec
---
Exactly its not good on its own
---
That's part of why facecamping is foolish. Especially in the higher ranks, you'll just have 3 gens popped off while you're standing still.
---
oh i always let survivors boop when im piggy, if they actually take advantage of it i won't hurt them because it makes me feel guilty
---
i almost always try to have the toolbox with me, i like doing the gens a lot and am used to the skill checks, but if i don't have the box with me i always try to play distraction in order to help other survivors :c
---
unless you're toxic
---
you can choke
---
I can play the game for hours, booking people as much as I want, and this scene still makes me cringe imagining the pain. The difference between the hook going all the way through your shoulder instead of just piercing up through the flesh makes it all.
---
Meh, this is fair, it‚Äôs the equivalent of survivors spawning on hex totems,
---
Play stealthy against campers and make the most of your teammates hook time. That's my view on campers.
---
I think it‚Äôs for the best of your interest you got away from that group of people anyways. That kind of behaviour rubs off.
---
My internet is screwed up or i would, ive been wanting to get a few people together to play simi regularly
---
A H H

---
That was a good escape! Some good luck, timing, and especially your perks really helped you there!
---
I used the offering that makes you a Freddy and everybody dced
---
You're suggestion that game devs should consistently be better than those working on the most popular game in the world?
---
Pig is my absolute favorite killer because of the crouching, the no TRadius while crouching and the ambush, also RBTrapping someone and then putting them on a hook is insane pressure to put on the map.
---
She's so cute
---
I still have a muddy splinter, so they can't all have been converted.
---
[easily one of tyler1‚Äôs best reactions ](https://youtu.be/9ePLZyI2jZY)
---
Lmao
---
This is awesome!
---
Key's condition for a 4 man escape : 5 gens done so 100% of the objective (4 gens done for 3 players) and for one survivor, you need all of your teammates dead, still a long time - Can easily get countered by a M1 Franklin's. Hatch is still closable so one teamate can screw the whole team over by activating EGC that way. There is an add-on that makes it so your key doesn't drop off on death, hence not available for the remaining survivors.
---
Mori's condition for a 4K : Hook each survivor once. Not counterable by any survivors perks in the game, not even Decisive Strike, a supposed anti-tunneling perks. Ignore 8 hook stages on a total of 12 hook stages, making it a big loss in bp for survivors.
---
Moris save more time for killers, and basically ignore two thirds of hook stages, whereas keys requires gen repairs/death of teammates.
---
i sound like a child for playing a game for fun and not to whine about it? that makes no sense.
---
spinning on ground means "officially" that you found the hatch
---
ooo thank you sm!!! i‚Äôve been considering getting the switch for a while now and dbd being released on there is making me want to buy it even more haha! i already play on xbox and a lil bit on pc but i get withdrawals when i‚Äôm on holiday and stuff so i think the switch will be perfect!! and you said it‚Äôs basically the same as playing on xbox so that‚Äôs really good bc dbd on xbox has gotten sooo much better since i started playing!!
---
What does the text on the spine of Rin's book say?
---
I normally just chase normally and very obviously avoid actually hitting them. Easiest to do as wraith and just bing bong instead of hitting. I only farm on holidays so I spent my christmas running after people ringing the wailing bell, especially since I just prestiged Wraith

* Do not publicly shame other players.
---
I think the devs said they're going to make the body of a survivor remain hook-able and mori-able (if they DC) at some point.
---
Nope, it's not a basic attack.
---
I can definitely agree with that. Someone that played maybe one hundred hours of the game and made it to rank 1 doesn't mean quite the same as someone with 1,000 hours at rank one.
---
I someone is working on a gen with me and they fail a non-hex skill check I will get off the gen, crouch down and stare at them for like 5-10 seconds the let really let them know I'm disappointed.
---
So how did this end, anyway?
---
Meh, it's rng 100% you got lucky.
---
lol I look like that but only because of horrible social anxiety. f
---
I'm uncomfortable but it's fucking hilarious.
---
Then your friends who play OW must not quit too often, I had bad internet back in the day that I played it, so I did have the penalty, but it's not a time penalty, it makes it so you are matched with people who also have the penalty, making matchmaking awfully long and get less exp
---
That‚Äôs only assuming you were using their power to get downs. Like I said, the self stun didn‚Äôt used to be so severe and with Cold Dirt you could spread deep wounds and cancel Frenzy right on a survivor‚Äôs ass and reasonably catch them.
---
How do I get Splinters to play as other killers I do not currently have?
---
It do, still nice work!
---
I can play with you for a little bit. want me to add you?
---
Sure.im in a match rn as killer tho-
---
Is it supposed to be a good thing that no one is doing a gen? It's kinda hard to win if no one does gens you know
---
Who the fuck actually dodges matches or DC . I‚Äôve never DC just take your L and move the fuck on . And I didn‚Äôt even know dodging lobbies was a thing just cause killer has mori who the fuck cares u can still win
---
Weird. They were supposed to be.
---
THE HITBOXES ON CONSOLE ARE FUCKING GARBAGE AND A PAIN IN THE ASS TO DEAL WITH.
---
I‚Äôm proud of my new icon and I have managed to keep it for four games. Lol My skill definitely does not match my rank. I‚Äôll be the first to admit I have a lot to learn still. I have only been playing since the week of Halloween. Shout out to all the awesome people in the community. You make it easier to drown out the toxic ones. Thanks for gg‚Äôs, snoot boops, and mori‚Äôing me when there are three or more Nea‚Äôs in my group. &lt;3
---
okay after that then :)
---
I don't ever bother with camping mainly because it doesn't give any points and it's just a really unnessicary thing to do. I've been accused of tunneling many times but it's usually the case of that one guy who keeps running into me at the wrong times, y'know. I don't really let people's attitude bother me but sometimes it just makes me think, why is this person doing this? What's their goal for trying to patronize me over something I'm not even bothered by. Like they really gotta make their problem yours.
---
do you have a mic?
---
Yeah.
---
I was also stuck on it, its not as easy as people think
---
read the title of the post
---
I know I got lucky, that's why I'm happy.
---
two short answers... the third one is regardless of challenges
---
Resemblance on next rift challenges = NO 
---
new and/or different and/or improved challenges = YES
---
cool cosmetics = YES
---
I'm still not sure how I got Devoted Gatekeeping so early one
---
okay, I'll send you a party invite then join through the party since I'm appearing offline
---
No
---
K. How old are you btw?
---
Could add you tomorrow when I'm home, need some survivor challenges done anywho
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzhxP-pdos
---
Alrighty
---
no.
---
It's the fact that you're trying to vouch for disrespectful behavior. Entitled players are never happy, if the killer looses (which is in their favor) they call him shit and when a killer wins, they also call him shit. It's just plain stupid. People in this community continue to brush bullshit behavior under the rug rather than trying to build this community to be better.
---
Do you get the after game chats saying you are trash and that they dc cause you didn‚Äôt deserve it for playing like this blah blah
---
Honestly it‚Äôs not that hard to switch between killers, unless you‚Äôre going from someone like the hag/trapper to someone like hillbilly. This is bc killers can be grouped accordingly to their mobility, map presence, early-lategame power transitions etc. 
---
I cant offer any input about getting the new survivors though, i mainly watch streams of killer gameplay bc im not a fan of surv and killer queuetimes are a nightmare where i am.
---
Had one guy apologize to me later and told me he was just having a bad day. I think that's the case with most toxic survivors. Bad days and bad circumstances.
---
Oh silly me. I should have read it before hahah
---
That‚Äôs my main problem- I wanna be able to run it on it‚Äôs own or mix it up but everybody always says that same ‚Äúdude qnq lithe build!!‚Äù
---
Most maps have very weak los breaks so 3s is nothing. I think it lasting 5 seconds would make it better on it‚Äôs own and really good with lithe, which, is that so bad? 
---
Also it should have had that red overlay that shows you the active timer of the perk like 9 years ago.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt want to play the game to farm fuckin bloodpoints. I want to actually have a fun time
---
21. you?
---
F in the chat. But same I feel you.
---
21
---
I tried so hard at this challenge using the trapper, dc after dc, thought I finally had it and the last guy I hooked hadn't been hooked previously, I let my concentration slip and he used deliverance to get off the hook and used borrowed time on the guy beside him, this was during the end game collapse and the bill he saved made it out. I almost cried.
---
Okay. Which of them would be more likely to read a manga tho.
---
omg i looove it!!
---
Depends on how stealthy you are. If you just use stealth to sneak up and get a cheeky hit and then chase, it might not be too bad. But if you are a ‚Äúlean and stalk‚Äù Ghostface and like to be stealthy. Oni and Demo are not stealthy at all. Lol Oni is anti stealth. You can use Demo‚Äôs portals as an ambush-style. But both have movement abilities that will take some learning since Ghostface doesnt have any. If you have played Billy, then Oni might feel familiar.
---
I play alittle of everyone and for most part there I just a few I don‚Äôt like cause powers are tricky to me but for most part just play a bit and they‚Äôre all easy to learn u might get some of those bad toxic games where you‚Äôre told to uninstall but at same time it‚Äôs always fun winning as new killer first game and seeing them be salty makes you feel like u did well
---
More missed swings than actual hits. And you still chose the map with a bad character. Your a joke
---
When you don't know what to say just reply ok Boomer like damn you got the whole squad laughing
---
I play on ps4. Would you rather me take a picture of my tv with my phone? Lol You get the idea without it being in 4k. üëå
---
Idk about console but yeah he seems super op. I‚Äôve seen alot of streamers get 4k‚Äôs first try with no/low tier add-ons, and even seen posts on this sub along a similar line of thought. 
---
Aside from that he seems like hella fun to play bc you can drift around the map like a madman.
---
Wow, no need to be rude /s
---
Honestly love my perks, so useful!
---
Big brain plays üëè
---
To be completely fair, I agree that the game's lost its fun - both Killer and Survivor. Grinding the Rift challenges takes the fun out of playing (miserable imo is the fact that unless you're in a party, nobody is on the same page and that makes completing the challenges harder as well). I also agree about the charms, they're little collectibles and they're cute.
---
:'(
---
I bet the killer wouldn't have respected the 4% had he caught you.
---
idk what your comment says for some reason it shows up [like this](https://imgur.com/zMDEq1l.png)
---
Freddy strong af
---
4 gens, 2 DCs, 1 injured, 1 on death hook
---
Wtf happened? DCs on first scream or something?
---
Do the rift challenges for more lore
---
Dude you can protect totems you cannot hide from a killer that literally spawns next to you. Especially if they do a full 360 spin to see where their totem they are trying to protect is.
---
So when you win and they call you shit you get pissed? Why lol that also makes no sense. Im not vouching for disrespectful play im saying just Dont take it personally.
---
Ok thanks idk if Freddy is bad but I got a 3k with last escaping hatcb
---
I bet you‚Äôre a blast at parties.
---
I don‚Äôt really know how to do accents and special letters
---
Yeah,I thought so
---
Jump in and out of lockers at the start to draw the killer's attention and try to convince the killer to let you stun them a few times.
---
Which killer sry
---
WHY DO THEY ONLY USE ONE PERK?
---
&gt;wispers.
---
Lol he was toxic. I think in this case he means bad like broken/OP. You must've done something, he seems salty
---
Question
---
You should be proud!
---
Count yourself lucky
---
Ohhh, definitely not.
---
1, so fake hits 
---
2. you chooce a map for a OP killer
---
3. you are a joke
---
Thank you!!
---
This is the big brain way to use insidious
---
Yo, where can i follow you to see more shit like this?
---
He said your hits were fake af + you chose a bad map (I‚Äôm assuming) with a broken character. You‚Äôre a joke
---
you're supposed to dc during the loading screen.
---
also wanna know the actual solution to this? like the one that acts at the very root of the problem?
---
remove mori from the game
---
Ya lots of toxic dbd players out there. And yes what that guy did was toxic because it literally didnt benefit then at all other than piss you off and make your life more miserable.
---
thats spanish im from mexico yeah, roto = broken but more as in OP. not as useless stuff
---
All of your comments are getting downvoted. For no reason. Wtf?
---
Man what an asshole survivor too, could have rescued you there especially with the other one helping. Dropping the pallet kind of fucked it but she didn't even try again she just left you.
---
Ghostface is so fun to play, he is viable in red ranks as well.
---
Devs should update illusions so doctor can mindgame like this, just like Spirit
---
Oh.
---
I was talking about survivor, the numbers I gave were for the survivor role at red ranks.
---
I've never been a red rank killer, I'm not sure how I'd even hit it, I already go against red ranks all the time (I'm still a rank 10\~ killer), at least 2 red ranks per lobby except for when I get matched with new players (or purposeful derankers) that are either curb stomps or identical in skill to all the red ranks (derankers/smurfs) that still stomp me with their 4-man.
---
I was last man left and 99% the 4th gen when the killer closed the hatch. I almost bit my controller in half.
---
Cat please eyes
---
This is the best thing I've ever seen
---
That's he part you don't understand. None of this gets me riled up. It just confused me on why someone would go out of their way to make their problems someone else's. If you don't understand that I can't help you. Brushing this kind of shit under the rug is exactly why no one respects this community or the game. Don't get it? I can't help you.
---
do you guys ever play solo? got this at the first try, basically soloing 4 gens on my own.
---
granted it was haddonfield, legion with sloppy butcher and 3 olympic level self caring individuals
---
I haven't been able to play for the past couple of weeks, and i didn't realize it was only until the 19th
---
still the point remains that suicide on hook will become the way to circumvent any DC penalty
---
That's what usually happens when I play against a doctor.  One player dc's the first time he hears someone else scream, other one dc's the first time they scream themselves.  Leaving me and a claudette that enjoys the company of crows in a locker to finish the match.
---
Boop one's own snoot?
---
Or is that too masturbatory?
---
Left Behind is like my top 3 favorite perks right now. It‚Äôs helped me so much.
---
Not everyone in solo queue will be able to activate MoM, but balancing for solo queue has shot this game in the foot a thousand times before.
