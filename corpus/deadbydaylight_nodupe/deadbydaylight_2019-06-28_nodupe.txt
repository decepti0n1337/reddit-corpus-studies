That's what I was thinking while I was watching it. Perhaps he'd already used his Unbreakable earlier in the match? His bleed out timer was rather low. So maybe that's why he didn't recover. But he should have wiggled as soon as Ghostface picked him up, especially with him swinging.

---
Then u are a cool person. Others do.
---
This was posted already smh
---
Battleblock theater was a beautiful game
---
What do you mean on struggle hook? Isn't that the current system?
---
Something tells me the devs are going to seek out more licensed stuff. Just this year, we’ve had Ash and his outfits, Ghostface and his outfits, and soon Tapp and Pig’s stuff. This has all been/will be very successful, and has also brought in a bunch of new players I’ll imagine (Evil Dead and Scream fans). So something tells me they’ll be even more eager for licensed deals than ever before. This is good as I want H2018 Michael, and Pinhead would be badass.
---
Tenacity, Mither, Object of Obsession, Unbreakable. Ultimate troll build.
---
It is funny :)
---
What a dick. Got what he deserved.
---
I’m sorry, people already told me. I didn’t know
---
You can see on the check, his name is A.Cambell... 🙄
---
I think the party blowers playing are the perfect sound for when you hook annoying an annoying survivor
---
I would love to see him in the game, i love the first 4 movies.
---
Is this dude racist? What’s the point of the this video outside of the DBD reference? Just curious. Is it just like a funny light hearted skit about how different people interact with different people or is it something more serious and this dude genuinely feels like and believes this kind of stuff? Pretty interesting video. Never seen it before.
---
But if you’re not blind as a literal bat, you can see the survivor has a key. So that’s kind of irrelevant.
---
:( aw that’s too bad. Thanks
---
It's actually a percentage bonus to all categories, not just alturism.
---
you cant just turn the tv off? prolly screwed yourself out of at least 40k bp

&gt;Hitting me is toxic you baby killer.

Killer wait times have been ok for me on PS4, only waiting like 1 min. 
---
I thought the problem was solved?
---
i
---
BS on Adrenaline.  Everybody uses Adrenaline
---
Literally JUST had this swf game. Flashlights, baiting, the works.
---
Is iron will bugged right now? I used it last night after not using it for quite a while and i still heard my survivor’s grunts while injured. And it wasn’t just my screen, I asked my friend if he heard me and he said he did.
---
I believe difficulty ratings are based off their starting perks.
---
You can find videos of it online, I’m a killer main and I rarely ever notice keys because of how hard they are to see. Plus it’s even harder to notice while crawling. It happens a lot, you’re giving people too much credit. A lot of people get thirsty for trolling and don’t pay attention and try to fuck with you only to lose the kill. Plus when I’m survivor I play Ash with his puppet and trust me nobody ever sees my keys. 
---
It’s also why you get plunderer too. That way you can surprise the killer with a key mid match and they’ll never notice you have it unless you make it obvious. Trust me, this happens a lot there’s compilations on YouTube
---
They also don't think. So theres that.
---
Can you do this for the Killer's Perks next??  XD  lol
---
Facerig. A man of culture too I see.
---
Im probably gonna spund stupid here, but is he actually playing or is that photoshopped? 😂
---
I've been There, just to stand in formation for 45 minutes because you have to be 15 minutes early for your superiors, who are 15 minutes early for their superiors who are 15 minutes early for the time they were told :P
---
I've seen Claudettes who literally just sit crouched in tall grass while the Killer is looking straight at them and is walking up to them.
---
You should be able to at least attempt an escape while you are the last one.
---
I know about adrenaline. Personally I don’t use it much because my team rarely makes it to endgame so I can’t depend on them popping a gen 😅
---
I absolutely agree. I'm really just speaking to my personal taste and assumptions so far, as a disclaimer. It just seems to be a pattern where the simpler the power, the stronger the Killer, but there's a good chance he'll be the exception.
---
Metle of Man is now useless btw.
---
That's what I meant I am ok with being killed after being hooked once
---
He's not bit ching you bitch. He's saying if you complain about a crutch like noed, then don't live in a glass house.
---
Some guy tried justifying the teabag by saying he did it to get my attention. If you’re trying to run me around the map why in gods name would i let you live
---
Bro why you so mad over this bullshit LMAO
---
*Killer runs one strong crutch perk*
---
Babydick
---
No. 
---
The only thing that slows down the Jigsaw boxes are the pig's add-ons.
---
Every match will now have 70% of blood points taken away due to an entity tax
---
Fucking love you.
---
Yeah, that was me. So what's your stance on the subject? Pinhead in DbD - would you like it or nah?
---
I don't know, but even if it does, it's not worth it on her.
---
The worst is that it is now mandatory to buy 2 teachables per characters if you want to have regular perks to appear again after level 35. Otherwise the game offers you the 2 teachables (lvl 30 and 35) every level.
---
A year ago maybe, it was still possible to not unlock the first teachable at level 30 and then you had this choice and another perk at every level. I did that for huntress, prestige1 without any teachable. Then they patched something and now at level 46 I have to buy the teachables... never progressed this killer ever again, her perks are just the worst.
---
I’ll take your word for it but that hasn’t been my experience.
---
Legion got changed and yet people still dc. What do people want?
---
Key and Peele are a comedy skit group. The guy playing the president is Peele.
---
Lullaby is pretty good in conjunction with ruin
---
You can try No Mither, Resilience, This Is Not Happening And Dead Hard and try to be a gen jockey.
---
Few issues with it.
---
Killer is likely to tunnel you hard, and probs will wait for you to Dead Hard since most people run it with No Mither. You could trade it for a stealth perk if you feel lucky. If killer does get on you, you’re basically running -1 perks otherwise.
---
No Mither would be much nicer if it gave you a full Iron Will effect and didn’t tell the killer you had it. Think how uncommon unbreakable triggers anyway (imo slugging is kinda rare), you’d hardly get No Mither off twice even if it didn’t tell them, because they wouldn’t slug you again.
---
Im blown away that you're getting downvoted
---
You can definitely hit red ranks as a solo. It's definitely tougher to get there than SWF though. Don't even needs skill with that really, just communication.
---
I havent done much of them either, i dont use flashlight because i know how annoying and frustrating it can be
---
Spine Chill underrated
---
Like...ultra?
---
I play both and i have to go with solo survivor... random teamates makes me wanna jump out of a window
---
Oof on that second worst title, I think the ability to sprint and vault pallets in a chase is extremely effective.
---
I suppose BHVR could start selling Mori animations similar to cosmetics. 
---
Would be a very fun idea to make prestiging more incentivised. Perhaps add a unique Mori animation for getting to prestige 3 with the extra cosmetic. 
---
Could also have mori animations purchasable via shards which would give players more of a reason to play more.
---
no
---
Lol. That's Claudette for me
---
This
---
You're assuming you need to survive to pip. You don't. A chase like that, working on a gen, and some unhooks and you will definitely pip up at those ranks, despite your team sucking.
---
The concept of being loved isn’t further lost on anyone more than it is on odd bulb flashlight users
---
It could be decent on her because alot of the time people just run to the boxes without healing.
---
so dont get him then?
---
Killer main all the way. It's a 4v1 bruh in a survivor sided game.
---
Yeah ikr Noed sucks
---
Clown is actually very smart according to his backstory
---
It also provides a speed boost.
---
It could be but it's not worth the perk slot for me. Not to mention it's a hex perk which can be completely destroyed
---
Does it let you pick yourself up multiple times? cause if not it’s literally just shorty unbreakable with no positives
---
On a map with the huge house and corn field. Usually a nightmare since if I'm chasing someone and they enter the corn I lose them but bloodhound helps a bunch.
---
Thats also a good offset.
---
Thanatophobia doesn't work at all, let alone Jigsaw boxes.
---
welcome to the joke, population: not you obviously.
---
Uh huh so instead of I don't know not being toxic like a normal person you do it back again .... like a child would..... yeah .....okay.....
---
Why not no mither will iron will no blood and completely silent?
---
Now that's a real horror movie ending there.
---
That’s Dr. Bing Bong to you.
---
But only on those who make over 10 million bps in a match
---
because it was a poor joke.
---
Not me, it deprives the Survivor of too many opportunities to be unhooked and for Chase. Something that powerful and compelling needs a counter or it needs a higher prerequisite to trigger.

I got my P3 Jake all ready to get all tha perks. :D Just got two more survivors to get to 40 (well minus David cause screw No Mither) and then it's a grind for all the perks. Other than that, I need to seriously work on killers. I've only got one to level 30+ and that's Cannibal for BBQ lol.
---
You are probably the same type of person who thinks tunneling is when a killer hits survivors when a survivor runs up and unhooks in front of them. I bet you expect them to let them go when the survivor is being that brazen. I mean are u not a survivor main lol. I'm not other killers u dumbass. All I said is if u tbag, prepare to be tunneled. That's it.
---
Bet dude
---
be less sweaty
---
Lms_falcons add that shit my toxic megs neas Ashley J Williams Dwight’s aces janes Laurie’s and Claudette’s
---
Lms_falcons
---
why does it bug you lmao
---
Why would you not uses them before you prestige. Seems like leaving BP on the table.
---
No I couldn’t unfortunetly
---
Bubbles_manz
---
Yes exactly. Marine corps lol
---
It does let u pick up multiple times, but you'll never have that opportunity
---
unlocked the teachable of someone i ended up
---
leveling :’(
---
because the BP cap is only 1mill  so I would get up to 1mill every prestige and then insta get him to 37-40
---
EXACTLY!
---
Thanks! Buttons for Eyes if actually my favorite perk I've come up with.
---
I made it because it fits with the Beldam, but honestly, part of it is that I've just got to rank 1 Killer for the first time and the amount of times that SWF swarm the hook and all sprint burst away as I can only get a hit in is insane... So the fact that this perk could let me hit one of them and then watch all the others flail around aimlessly just sounds like a dream come true.
---
(Actually Eternal Love is also somewhat anti-SWF as it counters insta-heals... Don't hate me Survivors, I'm one of you, a survivor main! Killer life is just **ROUGH** these days haha)
---
I’m probably biased because I’m a Jake main but tbh I’d die for him
---
Yea it looks like it:(
---
Cleansing dull totems gives points in lightbringer emblem now.
---
So yeah, you do them for the points now an the added bonus is they stop NOED.
---
It worked fine for me when I used it in my matches earlier... I’m also on Xbox btw.
---
well, there was also an option to ignore it on purpose...
---
The exhaustion gang
---
New killer: he had the face of stannis Baratheon
---
Is it just emblem for someone in a chase
---
*Context* 
---
Ran round for a gen got hooked then saved he then proceeded to chase me for 4 more gens rather than pressure gens facecamps until I die on hook then messaged me ‘ggez’
---
Damn, I have never gotten  close to the cap. I spend my BP too fast I guess
---
I like how he walks away as the generator pops from a failed skill check. His expression is everything I feel when my teammate fails the skill check when there isn’t even a ruin and I am on high ranks. Why, Meg, why?
---
Could you explain to me why you think he fits into the lore perfectly? Personally thats the only downside to him, due to him being a godly figure and the entity also being a godly figure so it might be difficult to take him into his realm.
---
What? Chasing falls under the chaser emblem, maybe I don't understand the question
---
You mean hitting the gen hehehehehe
---
  \[WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT\](/intensifies) PLAYING NURSE AS A NEWBIE IS AS MUCH FUN AS STABBING A NEEDLE THROUGH YOUR OWN EYELIDS
---
The only penalty that i know of is the person who DCd not getting any blood points
---
Done! ^_^
---
OMG! I can't speak! 🤣😂😅😭
---
What third season? &lt;/3
---
I N E E D this. Coraline is one of my favorite movies and they would be so cool to see in the game
---
\*Dan in a hurry....!!!
---
BREKFEST
---
sonimusprime: an altruistic Claudette/Kate/Dwight that don't give a fuck and will get you off that hook.
---
Second worst? Lmfao have you played Wraith before?
---
Sounds like a typical day on PS4 tbh
---
Spirit is a literal japanese school grill. She'd kawaii that shit so fast.
---
she looks like Tina from Bobs Burgers
---
Atleast bill wont ever get cosmetics, I prestiged tapp and thought I was safe but then they came out with tapp cosmetics
---
Is this /s or l.
---
Cause honestly the main issue is I see is that you don't know whether the killer is running NOED and only know when you get hit
---
oh god that’s happened to me a few times now and has scared the shit out of me each time
---
*THIS BLOODPOINT ECONOMY IS RIDICULOUS*
---
Good meme but it should be bill not Jake imo.
---
Right, I'll add the stipulation "but not in a chase" since sometimes one or two foreheads are crouching near the hook doing nothing but waiting for an opening to save. Thanks.
---
I spy with my little eye two not toxic things
---
Suffering from reveal.
---
Pre DS rework hell. Lol
---
How can you leave out our boi trapper, he with the lowest win rate in the game?
---
In his original incarnation, Pinhead was not really a being so closely associated with heaven or hell. He and his cenobite followers were merely “explorers in the further regions of experience”. 
---
They were a cult of sadomasochistic beings who had achieved great power through the things they experienced, and used that power to inflict and share those experiences with others who solved the box. “Demons to some, angels to others”
---
In later incarnations and films they went overboard and kind of trashed the story and changed up his motivations and backstory to be more closely associated with hell and the devil.
---
Idk,i guess when u have a ton of hours in the game u just do stupid things lmao
---
I CAN'T HEAR SHIT BECAUSE  THE FUCKING SOUND IS FUCKED AND SO NOW IM A NEW KILLER MAIN BECAUSE PLAYING AS SURVIVOR IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE AND I LOVE GETTING SNUCK ON BY A FUCKING GHOST FACE
---
T bagging isn’t toxic you fucking baby.
---
That’s the hallucination every doctor wants.
---
Yo I think I was this doc was this ps4 last night
---
General reposti
---
Looks like tiny Keanu wtf
---
i just think they look pretty cool.
---
Lots of self determination. It gets super frustrating but there are those few games in between that arnt like that. I main killer u just got to suck it up and rev that chainsaw
---
Console dbd is a fucking shitshow
---
I just got stuck in an infinite loading screen and lost my gruesome gateau! And why are they popping up so infrequently!? I'm still drowning in BBQ Invitations!!! The gruesome gateau should be the only thing people are burning rn!!!!
---
It really is, most fun I’ve had with Myers. I remembered back when he first came out I was pretty good with him, and I finally decided to get back into maxing him out and playing him (because I came from another console) and I’ve been getting assfucked left and right so I finally took a guys advice and fuckin used scratched and I don’t think I’ve ever had that much fun playing killer
---
Everyone tbags its been a thing for a while grow some skin.
---
Survivors? Yes.
---
P3 Myers? My pride and joy
---
Feng main need this
---
happy cake day
---
When people are tbagging and flashlight clicking and being a toxic group i will just camp then when i put them on a hook and be just as toxic back.
---
They can’t really be banned because what they’ve said isn’t offensive towards anyone. I get it all the time as killer.
---
Just ignore them they’re the ones being salty and butthurt 👍🏻
---
this happened to me earlier and i just played the game normally but dragged it out and let the last guy escape
---
not gonna sit around for 25 minutes watching these people do gens and get more benefit out of it than i do
---
i probably would’ve just sat there and submitted anyways but i had shit to do afterwards
---
If Spine Chill lighted up it would increase the panic level by 100x (also would help you tbh).
---
Not true, killers spend a lot of bloodpoints to fuck over the 80%.
---
Still messaging this guy he’s claiming I could of escaped easily but I was looping even thought there were still gens remaining
---
Damaniac2
---
Punishments for having bad internet? No, if that’s what you mean?
---
Also there’s a Facebook dbd group solely for ps4 users
---
No shit its been a thing for a while its been going since FPS had MP, it doesn't make it any less toxic. Maybe educate yourself and grow up rather then assuming someone has thing skin and doesn't understand the act.
---
O hey I forgot about that. Cheers lads
---
The real stalking man. Not the leaning boi.
---
Honestly I just push through there really isnt anything u can do about it but the feeling of finally getting them feels really good when u do it
---
I was about to make a similar thread.
---
Two things
---
What do I do to counter the survivors that dodge you by spinning in place and do people DC against the Spirit more often?
---
Surprisingly my sounds have returned to normal, only 1 game has been wonka
---
Clown.
---
The little Kate that could.
---
I read that as Dwayne Johnson for some reason
---
Freddy isn't bad per se. His power sounds awful since survivors are invincible until you sleep them. Sleeping them takes 7 seconds without addons. If you leave his terror radius, he can see your aura unless you wake up. Obviously if you are awake, he is invisible.
---
Waking up requires you to either fail a skill check, which shows up randomly, or have a teammate WHO IS AWAKE, wake you up. Most people either don't know that you have to be awake and often sandbag me when I don't wake them up.
---
The thing is though, when you are asleep, you take twice as long to heal, repair gens, or sabotage hooks. The *correct* way to play Freddy is to put everyone to sleep and then chase one. This slows the game down considerably since no one can wake anyone else up. If they are unlucky, they won't get any skill checks to fail. There are also addons for Freddy that can reduce chances of survivors getting skill checks.
---
If you sleep everyone, with double skill check addons to basically remove skill checks from the game, it becomes impossible to wake up. Then, everyone has half the repair speed and healing speed. Paired with Sloppy Butcher, a non-teachable killer perk will make healing take *FOUR* times as long in the dream world, and you have a bunch of injured survivors running around unable to gen rush or heal.
---
So Freddy is hardly bad. 
---
Addons: Blue Dress and Green Dress addons to reduce the amount of skill checks.
---
Perks: Only these 2 are really necessary. 
---
Sloppy Butcher to completely remove the idea of healing.
---
Ruin so that you have enough time to put everyone to sleep.
---
Once everyone is asleep, it's pretty much up to RNG to keep them from getting any skill checks to fail and wake up. When you hook people, they instantly wake up, so if they are rescued, sleep them immediately to make sure they don't wake anyone up. If you're able to keep these things in mind, he's a pretty disgusting killer as long as skill checks never come up. 
---
Of course, none of this *really* matters, since Freddy's about to get a rework sometime in the near future. The date isn't really known yet, so don't ask.
---
I get messages like this all the time. My internet is fine. Its only a problem when I catch someone.
---
Clown is decent Pop is worth it. 
---
Spirit is second best killer. 
---
Legion no.
---
Plague I haven’t played much of her so I can’t tell you anything.
---
Hey asshole I don’t need a history lesson on T bagging I know what the fuck it is. But if someone crouching in your game actually tilts you and you’re old enough to remember shit like that then you’re an actual pussy. IRL you probably shake at minor inconveniences. Who the fuck do you actually think you are talking to me like that?
---
i would get spirit but i already have her good teachable
---
Imagine winning millions of dollars then the next thing you know you get snatched by the entity and can't do fuck all with all that money you just won.
---
For the first hit.
---
Fine I'll take the goddamn picture of the screen shot, just stop fucking down voting me, I did nothing wrong
---
Gens Completed &gt; Survivors Remaining
---
Spirit and Pig can get away with not having it too, if your mindgames are on point and your traps aren't instantly removed at the first box.
---
It's a little frustrating, but meh, nobody likes to lose.
---
It's pretty easy to get over it when you realize it's just a game. Hey, the survivors probably had a lot of fun, so that's worth something.
---
When you begin chasing a survivor at 5 gens left and you finally hit then with 1 gen left and it pops and they have adrenaline
---
With the number of people here saying solo survivor is bad, I have to ask...
---
How is it that there are so many people I face with the same names playing *extremely* altruistically??
---
To clarify, same names being stuff like:
---
"I'm With Bob" and "Hi, I'm Bob"
---
"I'm Bob" and "And I'm Also Bob"
---
"Rescuer" and "Rescuee"
---
"XYZ Bob" and "XYZ Steve"
---
I face so many SWFs as killer that it takes all the challenge out of the game. OoO, Prove Thyself, We'll Make It, to make it super hard to apply pressure as any non-mobile killer. Like come on man, I'm trying to have a casual Doctor game and grind some BP, let's not have this super toxic round of players who want to keep me from ever getting a single hook. It's not impossible to get hooks vs them, it just becomes an epic chore to do so.
---
civ v
---
Same man same...
---
reports legit do nothin there no point
---
Salty Loops? No wonder the killer was angry, you were giving him *salty loops*.
---
Try giving the killer some yummy delicious froot loops instead. I guarantee you will get 0 hatemail for sharing a delicous treat.
---
People who are good in Rank 1 are typically solo survivors too - speaking form experience. There's so many matches where we were all solo and the Killer BMs us in endgame chat for being SWF yet we all laugh in solo survivor.
---
You have a good point. I've had matches just like the one you mentioned so I understand how frustrating it is. I'd still recommend Whispers though as it can help you can a stronger start to matches and help later on too.
---
As for something to stop stalling.. I'm not so sure. Kinda difficult to say when survivors are intentionally stalling or not at times but maybe the inactivity crows should spawn quicker the less survivors there are? Just an idea that came to mind suddenly.
---
This was a farming match so I'm not sure how much it counts in terms of validity, but I happened to have MoM on when 4 streamers were burnt and the Spirit was nice with us and we happily farmed 100k+ BP happy ending.
---
But I noticed after tanking like 5 hits, or at least I was given the "protection" scoring event 5 separate times, I had a whole 1 stack of MoM. After that I never equipped the perk again.
---
Wait, so you’re using thrill ruin noed prayer beads, but you’re saying you were the victim of bullying?? That’s kinda sad
---
Survivors abused this mechanic the last time they tested it. They would just camp the hook and keep the killer from ever getting sacrifices by forcing him to be within range. They tested the chase idea too, and the survivors would just stay hidden or outside of chase range, but make it clear they were still there.
---
This idea isn't workable due to survivors abusing mechanics.
---
He’s purposely abusing it
---
Holy crap they fixed the audio!
---
I can finally tell if i'm about to get stabbed in butthole!
---
[removed]
---
I remember when my first few killers all got BBQ right away since Bubba was the first killer I leveled up. Now I'm looking at 50+ webs before I can even get BBQ 1, man I miss getting BBQ 3 by like level 8.
---
It was on PS4 yesterday arvo. I'm pretty sure killer was in Japan (I'm here too and it was green ping).
---
The whole lobby quit in 20 seconds because nobody could run without rubber banding. He literally admitted that he was abusing his internet to farm quit points
---
Do you know that he’s lag switching though? He may just have bad internet and he can’t help that. I get it sometimes when playing survivor it’s just what you gotta get used to in a game with no dedicated servers.
---
Attempted bullying. Funny thing is none of my perks or add-ons came into play except thrill. What's sad is people like you who bring nothing but negativity to the game.
---
waaah waaaah waaaaaah
---
nice tunnel
---
PSA: to escape you need to return to the exit and leave again.
---
To the trapper who kept trying to pick me up as I crawled back to get the exit: "good day sir."

It was a baby huntress :D Whenever I would move left to right she yeeted the hatchet about 60°  away xD

*Survivor Mains™*
---
sometimes teasing is worth a life. the hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
Practice, you will get better at tracking them and hitting them, sometimes it's better to hold the attack and lunge while spinning, sometimes a quick hit while moving your camera will hit them, it's just practice. They don't, not necessarily, survivors and even killers will DC over just about anything but it's less frequent as you rank up :)
---
*mom i'm scared please come pick me up*
---
nea looks like one of the fish people of innsmouth
---
yeah thatd be a uhh, pretty big buff
---
I play both solo survivor and killer at about the same rank (green-purple) and I would say at lower ranks, solo survivor is way harder and more frustrating, but at right around rank 10 it kind of switches and killer gets harder while survivor gets easier. Once you’re at the rank where people actually know how to play optimally you tend to have an easier time of it as a survivor in general, though less so than if you were swf. Meanwhile killer gets tougher because people have learned how to counter, juke, gen rush, etc at that rank. At least that’s what I’ve noticed.
---
Could also be that terrible bug that just kicks people out. I’ve had it too that it just dc’s me but my friends keep on playing.
---
Ok.  So salt met vinegar and turned into some tasty potato chips.
---
Me too
---
To play Spirit you have to be really good at the base game. If you can't mind game with your red glow, you probably won't be able to mind game with Spirit. You need to get used to the loops and different tiles so that using her ability becomes second hand to you. That being said, prayer beads on her makes it so you can snatch people clean off totems and gens, and some argue that prayer beads spirit is better than nurse. It also requires little spirit skill to pull off, so you could always try that here and there for fun. Other than that just practice and get used to the maps and how survivors act around pallets and loops
---
I agree. I am a survivor main and I fucking hate noed, I don’t usually run builds like these and I never dc. But noed would be much less crutch if there was a warning or a totem counter
---
top tier maymay
---
They wouldn’t do anything in high ranks.
---
I see where your coming at, and I’ll try my best to attest to some of these.
---
-Kakorrhaphobia is supposed to be an extended lunge, and that’s it. I personally thought that it was quite bad.
---
-I’ll try to make the downsides a little worse, but the perk actually should have been something from the start. Originally, Deception would give nearby survivors the Exposed stratus effect (OP, I know) so I removed that. Only then afterwards did I realize how OP surprise attacks with that add-on are. My idea is to either make the penalties worse and include a much larger whistling that trumps handcuffs, OR change it to its original with worsened penalties to having it.
---
-Some of these were honestly me just putting down whatever seemed good and unique enough. I didn’t think about downsides, so I take the blame here.
---
-I feel like this add-on, Jacobs Mask, could go one of two ways: It’s is OP because of the slowness/aura reading, OR it’s actually underwhelming since using Deception you are supposed to be near survivors and therefore will likely get a hit in anyway, but really I’m not sure.
---
-This is just prayer beads. The idea is you only hear whistling while 4-6 meters away, maybe even closer. 
---
I understand some of these flaws, and I appreciate feedback. Sometimes people don’t tell you how your ideas are too strong or weak, so I appreciate it. I would also appreciate if you could maybe stay updated with my future posts so I could maybe get feedback there as well. All in all, thank you ☺️
---
Spirit is also one of the top 3 killers, and clown has pop and that got buffed recently and is actually really good
---
But... none of those are crutch perks? I play killer from time to time and even I won’t pack NOED. If I failed to get anyone before the gens are done, that’s on me for my lack of skill.
---
I shouldn’t be rewarded for being bad
---
I just got the pig and have been running lullaby because I thought it did affect them...
---
LF and hag have good perks, spirit is really good, clown is meh with some good perks, ghostface and myers are both fun and have eh perks.
---
I feel like this is typical BHVR lmao
---
Add more shit to the game and make it more unstable instead of fixing the currently existing issues
---
IM NOT STAYING NEAR THE HOOK BECAUSE IM CAMPING, IM STILL HERE BECAUSE I CAN SEE YOUR DUMB ASS BEELINING FOR THE HOOK! DO YOU REALLT EXPECT ME TO JUST LEAVE AND SIMPLY ALLOW YOU TO GET THE UNHOOK?!?
---
AND TO THE SURVIVOR WHO FLAMED ME POSTGAME FOR """"CAMPING"""", I WAS IN THE BASEMENT BECAUSE YOUR SCRATCH MARKS LED THERE, AND YOUR TEAMMATES RAN TO THE SHACK TO SAVE YOU BEFORE I HAD EVEN LEFT THE BASEMENT. ITS NOT MY FAULT YOUR FIRST INSTINCT WAS TO RUN TOWARDS THE MOST DANGEROUS LOCATION ON THE MAP!
---
Didn't realize rocket raccoon played this game.
---
Cutting a Survivor off and making them do an entire fucking backflip is the most satisfying shit ever.
---
Would this give the killer an alert or...? Like what kind of sounds? Injured breathing?
---
&gt;gets tilted about t-bagging
---
&gt;tells me to grow up
---
Nice try taking the high road you absolute coward.
---
Did you ever find a fix for this? I'm having the same problem and can't seem to find any solutions that are working for me :(
---
Sir Mister Doctor Bing Bong
---
How am I being salty at all? In the video, he doesn't shake hands with Left Behind and No Mither. I laughed my ass off, and I posted that comment. What are you guys getting mad about?
---
You get the emblem if people are cleansing totems while you are being chased.
---
Shit, you really are dropping in intelligence at an exceptional rate. Sandbagging, camping, lag switching, hacking, dcing, those are toxic, and those are MASSIVE problems in the entire community, but you'd rather assume that it's to do with bad baby pwayers who can't pway da game wight. Fuck off, man, stop trying to delegitimize valid fucking issues that people have all over. These aren't problems people create for themselves, these are issues that kill off the community, from an overwhelming amount of entitlement and ignorance. But it's very clear you'd rather ignore logic and be a big tuff Republican true gamer gg noscope "I'm better than you" bafoon. It's not rude to call out valid problems that are far more troublesome than the issues you pretend are more important. Quit being so overly ignorant, do everyone a favor, and uninstall the game, because you invalidate real issues just as much as the crybabies you think are the only things to exist. You are the antithesis of helpful or constructive in every way. I swear to god, it's already difficult enough dealing with this shit community, but I don't think I've ever seen something so incorrect, biased, and just plain stupid in my life, and I've been doxxed twice. Toxicity is pretty fucking prevalent, and it's not whiney players. It's genuine rule breaking that kills all fun for everyone. There is no improving or overcoming toxicity, just killing it. But hey, you're really good at making overly blind assumptions based solely on muh political party and muh manliness. So I guess you can remain in your pretty crystal little bubble of impeccable genius. Stop pretending you're above everything and open your damn eyes.
---
Probably a swf
---
It looks like you put so much time and effort into this and it’s sad it barely has any upvotes
---
You're not wrong
---
for maximum immersion. only when you become Myers can you be Myers.
---
Um too much
---
Or just do gen... there a thought... basic ass claudette
---
devotion 500? Or devotion 5?
---
I did. But it's okay some people have seen it so that makes me happy! Im glad you like it!!
---
YES! YES! YES! YES!
---
**YES!**
---
of course it doesn't work- its fan content. I didn't claim it would. I mainly just post these things to see where the flaws in my logic are and where I can improve- which, if you have any such insights, feel free to let me know! \^-\^
---
dont need to downvote my comments ;'(
---
Couple of things. 
---
The third trap could be put onto a gen, and the killer could use Insidious (a perk that turns off terror radius) to camp the gen because no one can leave the gen once they activate the trap. Easy gen grab.
---
The second trap is also broken. Permanently slowing down gen progress by 20% is too much. 
---
The first trap is weak as hell. Most killers at green ranks or higher don't even kick gens unless they have a gen-kicking perk. Kicking gens take off 3% for the kick and then an additional 1% every 4 seconds. The first trap is only *slightly* better than actually kicking the gen. Depending on how long it takes to set a trap, it might actually less useful to use the trap than it would be to kick the gen. No one would ever pick this trap to use over the 2nd or 3rd trap. 
---
Stop making hex perks. Just stop. They don't work. No one will ever take the risk on them. If they are found, you lose the perk. The only exception is Ruin, since people  wasting time looking for it is a good thing. Even if it takes 5 seconds to find, you had 4 survivors wasting time to search for it. But hex perks have to be disgustingly broken to compete with something like the ever-popular BBQ, EnduringFury, Nurse's Calling, or Ruin. And if your hex perk *were* broken, then people would just complain until it were removed. (Look at NOED, which doesn't even activate until the endgame) The payoff of a hex perk just isn't worth the risk of instantly losing it and running -1 perk. 
---
This killer would ultimately fail since it's a 110 speed killer without any power in a chase. The killers with speeds slower than 115% usually have some kind of power that helps them damage survivors in a chase. 
---
Nurse blinks through pallets and windows. 
---
Huntress has ranged attacks. 
---
Hag can set traps in loops and teleport to them. 
---
Spirit can channel for intense speed to catch up to survivors. 
---
So this killer has a very unbalanced power since 2 out of 3 traps are too strong while the 1st one is too weak. Two of their perks are hex-based, making this killer vulnerable to losing half their perks immediately. And they're too slow without any chase-focused powers to compensate.
---
Please dont give any hate, I am very proud of myself!
---
"Let's see, I'm ~~Francis~~ Jake, and that's Grandpa Bill, and THERE'S ~~ZOMBIES~~ A KILLER OUT HERE, OPEN THE GOD DAMN DOOR."
---
First off, rank means nothing in this game. No rewards and no benefits in fact all it does is make your games harder by facing more skilled players. Second off, it depends what killer you're playing. Certain killers excel with the emblem system, others suffer. Once you get to high ranks if you're not running ruin and if you're not playing a lethal enough killer you just wont be able to pip anymore unless you really know red glow mind games and how to make the best of M1 killers. Gens are too quick otherwise and that entire category for delaying them is almost impossible. for some reason they decided to FORCE a "win state" by adding the emblem system. it used to be 1 kill 2 kills 3 kills 4 kills and that's it. IMO just deciding for yourself what is a win and what isn't is the best choice. For me, I aim for 4ks up until purple - red ranks, then depending on what killer i'm playing i'll be happy to kill 2 or even hook 1 (freddy omegalul). I honestly just play for bp and would be totally fine with an unranked mode.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Long story short: stop caring about it and you'll enjoy the game a lot more. The current system is inconsistent and requires stupid things like purposefully engaging with the killer and forcing killers to run gen stopping perks just to have a chance.
---
No and yes. No mither is 1. Hard mode and 2. I don't want to find the killer to activate an injured build
---
AnxiousPotato0o0 has added you
---
It’s pretty balanced as it is, it just lacks true “counterplay” for new and low rank survivors. A high rank survivor or experienced player can count all the killers perks just by seeing how they play, however NOED can fly under the radar and only shows itself when it’s too late. The easiest fix and balance would be when the last gen is powered and NOED activates, it exposes everyone immediately. That’s all I really ask for, but if there was a slight mechanic that NOED gave even if it was a buff/nerf (the red stain is always bigger in chases or totems take longer to break) before all the gens pop then it’d be a pretty good compromise for killers and survivors
---
I’m an offended main and I feel Claudette
---
Oh yeah I know lol
---
You’re totally sleeping on Pop Goes the Weasel! After it’s buff, I’d argue it’s a pretty strong gen prevention perk, especially paired with something like surveillance and maybe in some situations tinkerer (still deciding on that though). Pop goes the weasel + BBQ or PGTW + Overcharge is strong, too. The fact that you can cross the map and still get to use pop, and throw in an overcharge skillcheck? You can stop gens pretty well, especially if you’re applying strong hook pressure.
---
An alert would be too similar to diversion which requires you be in the killer's terror radius for 45 seconds to use. Injured breathing and possibly moving noises. It's not entirely fleshed out.
---
Don't you keep all add-ons and offerings when you prestige?
---
I know rank means nothing in this game and honestly it never did but it can be improved made to actually mean something, but your advice is solid, thanks.
---
Corrupt intervention reduces the amount of gens you have to check at the start of the game while also pushing survivors away from those gens (sometimes making it so they risk being seen, but also forcing them to go to gens you KNOW they will be at). It also has a pretty long active time, which can slow down gens well. Plus, survivors can’t remove it like they can to ruin.
---
C'mon, we all know it takes that long to find a game on PS4:) No one cares about how you got it. If i took a guess, i would say you farmed blood cakes with survivors or the killer.
---
I play on Xbox and the times to find a lobby as survivor are like 5 seconds usually. It’s very populated mostly
---
Oh yeah should have mentioned, there was no farming ;)
---
then the fucker drops you and closes it
---
Once you've learned to embrace the salt and toxicity that's when you know you've reached the next level. At high ranks I expect it and even on occasion can predict exactly what they'll bitch about this time. Nothing better than outplaying the idiots with their clicking and bagging. Makes it feel that much better tbh. 
---
Usually their goal is to get you mad or to just mess around / boredom. If they're getting you mad you're letting them win. You play worse when you're on tilt.
---
Must be nice, as killer on pc takes a good 10 mins most of the time
---
There’s a perk to counter toolboxes!
---
Fair enough. Seems like it'd be fun to use.
---
Yeah I know I used To main DBD on PC but moved to Xbox because times are way better &amp; most of my progress now is on Xbox. Plus my PC isn’t too good so with Xbox don’t have to run low ass settings yknow
---
plot twist the Beldam is the entity
---
Just saw your whole argument with the other fella, yeah U MAD
---
Yes, it frequently happens to people who buy Killers directly with auric cells.
---
The game is most likely coded to give you those offerings if you own the DLC.
---
And you technically don't because you bought Myers separately from his DLC on Steam; so this causes the game to think, "They don't own Myers and might want to try him out; I'll give them a Black Splinter!"
---
Would you kindly like to tell us sir because I'm everyone hates grinding for like 12 hours to get 1 Million.
---
I think they're all farming, you really had no choice or control of what was happening here.
---
Maybe
---
why are the scary things in this game glitches or spacific builds?
---
I’ll only take pharmacy if I’m leveling a character without self care and i’m solo

Ok noted

---
how long have you been spelling cherry without a Y
---
Nice!! They are so cute and romantic, I love them soooo much 😭👍👍
---
It’s not a faze mom it’s who I am
---
The ranking was actually pretty on-par here. I don’t see the problem. The ranks do tip out towards the survivors a bit more in this case, but honestly two 12’s which are only 1 rank lower than you, a rank 17, and a rank 7 balance pretty well.
---
Turning off my firewall before I play helps my chances usually
---
It’s not a faze mom, it’s who I am

Surviver:*dies*
---
Myers:
---
DS twice was great
---
Or after they DC have him do this
---
This subreddit is very toxic, learned that a while ago lol.
---
He'd probably get a heart attack from the first time he hears the heartbeat, thinking its his own.
---
I do dull totem while you chased. Me no do gens. 🙃
---
lmao wtf
---
I’m like 99% sure that is physically impossible, unless you all farmed with gruesomes. Unless you somehow got “Perfect Games” each time, there’s literally no way you got that much.
---
I don’t understand the people who unhook as soon as you start to walk away. Like of course you’re going to just turn around and get them.
---
Whatever douche
---
Wait what? Can you even get that high?
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
haha why is this the most accurate killer list?
---
I have a recording of one match that I can show you, but I cant upload it today, or tomorrow, maybe next week
---
It’s natural selection if you’re dumb enough to stay at the gate to taunt the killer knowing they can down you from afar.
---
I mean you acted like your evidence was fact but now you want to say its all speculation??? Okay then? And I did not say or imply that noticing clues each time makes one smarter. It may not be a clue but its definitely a callback to the original scene in the movie. It isn't just some meaningless gesture.
---
Survivor perks are hard. Try to encourage different play styles without being too situational.
---
Probably, however one of them has kindred. A minute detail but if your in a SWF it’s almost useless.
---
Definitely a SWF
---
I think you mean devotion 5. As of now literally no one has gotten to even devotion 50 legitimately
---
Is he actually gonna start streaming or is this a goof?
---
That’s what I mean
---
the right hand is terrifying
---
you must be acidic because your ph level is below zero
---
Kate : am *I* a joke to you
---
Also wtf is that picture
---
I'm a killer main, but i feel you. Whenever I meet a killer like this one as a survivor, I politely ask him to point out an alternative way to escape from a chase except looping. They usually shut up or resort to insulting you after that.
---
Once you prove it ill believe you did it. Its possible but VERY hard to do
---
Nice either A: Lies or B: Hacking.
---
I will gladly prove it (: I’ll upload it sometime around 7:00 pm PST or earlier
---
Can we change mettle back to unhooks count for stacks? The protection hits are bugged or really hard to get. I havent gotten it since the chapter dropped and my build revolves around getting saves and taking the hits for people
---
Clown for Pop Goes and Bamboozle
---
Spirit because she is the last actually good killer you can get, all 3 of her perks are useful in their own ways.
---
Doctor if you want M&amp;A, unfortunately he is pretty Garbo.
---
Plague is alright, pretty fun I suppose. Perks are a mix of fun to use but also not that good.
---
Legion- No.
---
Cursed image
---
Got it, thanks so much for clarifying
---
You can just wait it out. That's what they do 90% of the time. They stay immersed with UE. Then they get on gens. It's rarely actually useful as killer and as survivor I have never once thought "this killer has CI, we're fucked!"
---
How do you get up there? .....asking for a friend
---
I have playing for two years on dbd and I haven't used a flashlight in a public match. Good job man!
---
Then you still know where they are? Also, if survivors are waiting THAT LONG for it to end and you still haven’t found them.... rip lmao
---
Is that rank 20 Laurie that doesn't know how to even use a flashlight properly is what reddit killers call "bullying" oh my
---
I’ve noticed this happening a lot as well.
---
Ever since I started playing the doctor has been my boy. Some games I struggle to kill the survivors but there’s something so enjoyable about getting everyone into tier 3. Then for kills I play Myers, I know he ain’t top tier but when I play him the survivors play like potatoes.
---
I MISSED A FEW RESETS AND AM BACK IN 13-9 RANGE. EVERY OTHER GAME SURVIVORS ARE STRAIGHT TRASH.
---
One time a toxic legion carried me near the hatch, and since I knew what tf he was gonna do, I crawled away from it. Then, to assert dominance, he carried me back to it, and closed it. Haha funni killer close hatch
---
I’d say it’s not enough by 40.
---
&gt;Doesnt say anything to no mither or left behind 
---
Yep this is accurate
---
How so?
---
Basically, what I get from this is:
---
 "Toxic is a liberal buzzword."
---
 "Toxic is purposely shitty and unsportsmanlike conduct."
---
 "That's false, lemme call you a bunch of buzzwords but it's okay because they're Republican and also you're bad at the game which has nothing to do with politics whatsoever."
---
 "Politics have absolutely nothing to do with purposefully shitty and unsportsmanlike conduct."
---
 "Haha, liberal, you're bad at the game."
---
 "That's not purposefully shitty and unsportsmanlike conduct."
---
 "Entitled whiney bad player liberal, starting off being shitty is just like you."
---
 You really do make conservatives look bad, injecting it into every conversation where you can put yourself above someone without relying on real facts, just as bad as the other side. Who exactly was the one who decided to comment a shitty, flamey comment, filled with whiney buzzwords and utter bias? The unnecessary hypocrisy. You sound like my grandparents, completely blind to anything else but what is coming out of their own mouths. But at least they're old, they have an excuse. And for the record, I don't claim to be good at the game. I'm semi decent at best. But I'm fucking aware of it. I'm fully aware of how a game is played and why it's fun, you're using things that are toxic behavior without knowing the reality, just blaming a generation like every other idiot above the age of 40. But sure, I'll be a whiney millennial liberal baby so you can get that win and own me, I can act. How about take politics out of here completely, it's unnecessary. Then see what you have left, and work from there.
---
MISSED A FEW RESETS AND AM BACK IN THE 13-9 RANGE. EVERY OTHER GAME THE SURVIVORS ARE STRAIGHT TRASH.
---
Oh ok yea but docs are hard to come across
---
That perk doesn't actually give me any indication of where any survivors are though. It literally only blocks 3 generators for a short period of time. You're severely overhyping this perk dude.
---
Already rank 15. Cant derank further.
---
I feel like buttons for eyes should not go TOTALLY black... but maybe with four/eight holes in the middle of the screen like where the thread goes through buttons.
---
Basically a plug for your yt?
---
the...post isnt even about lowering their USD/cell price. but the in-game currency and you're REALLY mad that people arent as privileged as you. you keep screaming about how im "justifying" anything when i literally just pointed out that dbd WAS a psplus game and someone poor could own it b/c of that. 
---
you seem like you have a lot of mental issues you should work out before posting on social media if the concept of people have less money than you makes you this angry bro.
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
You're the one who made a reddit thread of yourself "wrecking" rank 20 survivors who have no idea how to even play this game and justified it by saying they were bullying you even though clearly none of them have over 10 hours.
---
Yeah! Personally, I don’t think getting a lot of kills is necessarily a win. After all, there are four categories that earn you bloodpoints, and kills are just PART of one category; I try to maximize the amount of hooks I get. You get sooo many points from a 8 hook game, even if you don’t kill anyone. If you can get a 12 hook, that’s even better and the kills come with it, but the hooks themselves earn quite a bit of points, as opposed to the actual sacrifice. Doctor is so good for milking points, and Myers can be very fun too. I used to play him a bit, but since ghostface came out, I’ve been loving him. Like a smaller, sneakier Myers who can constantly Mark. It’s so fun.
---
Fuck off SJW there was absolutely no racism in this clip. Stop making issues out of nothing you fucking jew bag
---
I JUST PLAYED AGAINST THE MOST TOXIC KILLER I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED. NOT ONLY DID HE HAVE HEX: RUIN, BUT HE CAMPED THE FIRST HOOKED PERSON. THE GAME WAS OVER WITHIN 2 MINUTES... BUT WAIT. I WAS THE LAST ALIVE, THE LAST DOWN. HE HAD ME CRAWL ALL THE WAY TO THE HATCH JUST SHY OF BLEEDING OUT, AND CLOSED IT IN MY FACE. THEN PICKED ME UP AND LET ME RUN TO AN EXIT DOOR... DOWNED ME AGAIN. AND PROCEEDED TO STAND NEXT TO ME AS I BLED TO DEATH.
---
JUST KILL ME. DON'T WASTE MY FUCKING TIME, YOU MEGA DOUCHE. CR@Y OR KR@Y, YOU TOOL.
---
Based on gen progress?

i was going to say "the struggle of a huntress main" and then i read the title, it hurts when i see them in the web

See, I don’t mind if they wake up with a skill check, because it will only help them for a second. They tell me where they are, and many times they’re injured anyway, and as freddy most of the time, you’re guaranteed that first hit. I love the addon that removes the flashes of you they get to see. Makes it fun and easy to get the first hit.

Got my first while doing no mither david lol, pretty much go for them constantly now. Nothing's more satisfying in the game to me right now.
---
Too bad his second movie wasn’t as good.  I’m looking at you “Us”.
---
Well they must be good survivors to get to rank 7 in less than 10 hours. Think they played bad? They did because they were trying to bully me. Such a negative Nancy.
---
I also love the swinging chains, and the black box.
---
Slow the game down even more.
---
Immediate dying light.
---
I play Doctor with Disstressing and BBQ and I often get 4Ks on PS4 and it takes me more than an hour to get 1mil. Sir were you farming?
---
I’d argue there’s a difference between idle grinding, and grinding to an active goal.
---
No, I have stated this already, I’m clean
---
No this is a common problem for solo survivors.
---
 Solo queue is beyond frustrating because you literally play to lose because the killer slaughters your potato team in minutes. Then when the killer puts a ton of pressure on you, you then have a mental breakdown and get pissed off then everything just spirals out of control. Its actually worse on high ranks because the killers are fucking really good and seem to always hit you while your team is just slightly above average. Fuck. That. Bullshit.
---
You and your kind give me nightmares.
---
At this point, I’m sure the survivors just think, “eh, why the fuck not?”
---
Object of obsession, Insta heal med kit, flashlight clicking, body blocking a hex totem. It wasn't a bully. They attempted it and failed which is why they look so stupid. I'm just glad I picked spirit when I saw them load in together.
---
I get what you’re saying but unfortunately not every perk is gonna be good or meta. When there is a perk that is actually good it just gets nerfed into the fucking garbage where all the other perks like open handed fit. I just feel like there is never going to be a new meta perk, they are all gonna be just mediocre perks that no one really uses
---
Infinte range Bond ftw.
---
Shes been telling mom that its her turn on the xbox
---
I heard that if the game makes the death sound, they actively Disconnected, no sound means their system crapped out.
---
Rank 8 killer, survivors were rank like 7, 7, 3 and 12. I didn't get bullied. If I had been playing a weak killer however it might have gone differently. If you don't like it you don't like it. You don't have to come here talking shit to make you feel good about yourself or whatever it is that you are doing. I found this funny so I posted it.
---
You're not supposed to wiggle free, that exists so you don't go to the basement every hook. And hook spawns haven't changed for alot of updates at this point
---
Oh that would be cool!
---
@s don't work on Reddit

I’m far from an SJW. And you just never no anymore these days. No secret that Peele is a left leaning liberal so I wouldn’t surprised. Like I said I was simply just asking weather this was intended as joke light hearted or something perhaps a bit deeper and more serious and or meaningful. Nothing wrong with that and no need to insult me for it. I’m not making issues out of nothing. I asked questions. And I’d argue that there was racism in this clip. But if it was intended as a joke and a funny skit then no harm done. At least that’s how I feel. Ike’s are supposed to sting a bit. The point of this clip is that “the president” is calm cool and collected and professional with the whites but with the blacks he transforms into just another normal cool dude. It’s comical. I’m just aware Peele’s political positions so I simply asked weather this was a comical skit of perhaps something more intended to be serious and directed at something. Not far fetched. Look at Taylor Swift’s new song. It’s directed at “old days people” and “white trash” that have a problem with the gay community. It’s not unheard of for an actor or celebrity to make statements within their skits or content or whatever it is that they are creating.

I respect your opinions and ideas whatever they be. You didn’t need to jump down my throat and call me a Jew bag and whatever else but I can see how my comment looks and how it could come off as looking or reaching for an issue and trying to fabricate an issue out of nothing. Truly it was not my intent though and I do not believe that that’s what I did. Anyways, good night to you and my apologies if I offended you or triggered you. Neither were my intentions.
---
I know I always appreciate the chuckle when I join up and two of my teammates are running no mither!  It’s always really funny!  Great joke! Too bad I can’t laugh longer about it though cuz the trials are usually really short!hahaha!
---
Every killer would camp if they knew survivors could get off the hook when they were the last one still alive.
---
Oh man I did this earlier to a guy, Spent the whole game T-bagging every single time he got an option to,  I hooked the 2nd last guy and I hear the hatch  like just behind the hook, Last survivor is the T-bagger.   
---
He runs up while Im hooking other guy, T-bags and runs towards hatch, stands there T-bagging, So I chainsaw rushed over and he backs up and I hit the edge of a wall, he T-bags again, I just turned around and slammed the hatch shut on him.  
---
He instantly DC'd, It felt reeeaaaal good
---
Are you 60?
---
Just to be clear: I didn’t get all my unhooks by just waiting to attempt until someone was coming to unhook me. This time, I happened to, but that rarely occurred before.
---
Why are you coming into this post that's 2 hours old and donvoting it? Survivor main I'm guessing. Well this is what it looks like when a bully team go against a good killer. It makes them look stupid.
---
You right my bad
---
Exactly. Its fun to throw an Idea out and see how people react. even if it's not going to be used in the game, the ideas and concepts can be recycled for other games, or even books and stuff.
---
DBD Birthday Theme Year 3. Try looking that up? If not wait for someone to rip the files off the game and make a YouTube video.
---
Will the cakes be useable after the event
---
What does that have to do with burned out
---
Daddy Myers got prestige for that bloody knife
---
I mean yeah it’s worth getting into as long as you are willing to go thru hell getting started. As long as you watch videos and keep up with the basic meta it shouldn’t be that big of a deal.
---
You say small time like Freddy Krueger isn’t in this game. Forget the lore and focus on the Pinhead part.
---
Just keep practicing killer. Eventually you'll get the hang of it.
---
They mean it should be an even number
---
Which is why you do totems every game. Which slows down the game. Which is healthy for the game.
---
when can we download the test build, my code ain't workin.
---
Fun fact: if you hide inside of a locker long enough crows will start to gather on top of it and eventually constant noise notifications will go off.
---
Prestige means fuck all
---
*Night shroud cancelling sound*
---
Honestly i love facing legions
---
Another man of culture I see…
---
I absolutely love this movie, having it in this game would be nothing short of a dream come true, an insta-buy. However they could never add Coraline as a survivor due to the fact that she’s like 11 ;/ 
---
It’s funny that you posted this because I recently beat the Coraline game which was cool
---
true true. But for solo which I almost always play it's pretty good.
---
Not everyone, im not atleast.
---
Instant generator repair Brand New Parts, Sprint Burst activating multiple times mid-chase, and pallet vacuums were *totally* healthy for the game, god **damn** Killer mains.
---
YTA imo.
---
Huge overreaction
---
Do the last gen and leave. You cant save them.
---
Good shit 👌
---
It was just an exercise for me to pass the time. I was bored.
---
Ghostface currently because he is very unique in the way he can do things and Survivors suck at spotting him but if you got a good squad you need to really play good to get a 4k and when I first played him I knew he was for me however Clown
---
Because? I played dbd since june 2016 and then it was trash because it didnt literally work. Have escaped so many killers cuz of it. You can use it the whole game basically if youre injured
---
Answer me now
---
Also, for extra creep factor, the Beldam should still be claymated.
---
I mean the game will never be balanced. Some swf won’t even give you a chance and you’ll just get fucked. Other times if you face a killer like ZubatsLEL’s Huntress or Artethas Nurse you will literally stand no chance. There is a very rare occasion of balance in this game.
---
This helped me immensely: https://youtu.be/7AG8v-5sszA
---
I just play to win. I get why it sucks for some but if im playing killer im trying to get kills.
---
BHVR has a dead by daylight discord server and I’ve seen people forming groups in general.
---
HOLY CRAP! They keep their stalk meter at whatever level you have it at if they are Grabbed!!! I must use this new information for better setups in the long run!
---
I don’t know what LFGnis I’d love to answer you but I am not able to I’ll tell you now if you decide to be rude too less people will answer you
---
I've been on there everything was telling me "you don't have permission to join" bullshit but there's not one for Xbox One
---
Well basically it means you are a douchebag with no life. Happy I could help you.
---
No they ignored my last thread when I wasn't being rude so I deleted it  because I got no answers who the fuck do you people think they are ignoring me?
---
Personally, I run NoM, Tenacity, Resilience/We'll Make It, and Breakdown/Saboteur.
---
If you're good at looping the killer it's useful to distract the killer from other survivors doing gens since they will probably tunnel you. It's also a surprisingly good altruism build since the killer will usually chase you before unhooked survivors.
---
I'm rank 7 and I've had more success than failure so far in my matches. It's hard to get a killer to slug unless there is another survivor nearby, but usually if they go for the slug, I can lose them and get back up pretty easily thanks to Tenacity.
---
Well I don’t care but as a below average skilled gamer I understand how it feels when you get stomped by a killer who is way better at you
---
do you play on pc? join the official DBD discord server
---
Thinking that I could get back into the game again, but getting hit with a mori and accusations of working with the killer really furthered the burnout
---
For survivor it’s a lot less tedious than playing multiple killers.
---
Ahhh, yeah I don’t know then. I’m pc 😕 gl
---
Dat Hitbox on the trap.
---
Aah Scream 3, worst of the series but still ok.
---
He was probably attempting to hide his identity, sure you know his last name but this way no one can see him on the street and try to get his money
---
Your attitude really REALLY sucks. I wouldn't want you here either tbh.
---
I guess that depends on what your definition of a killer being effective is. Are you purely trying to get a 4K as quickly as possible, regardless of what else you do, or are you trying to accrue as many points as possible? Some killers have abilities that are counterintuitive to getting kills as quickly as possible (legions feral frenzy, for example, encourages spreading hits to multiple people/chaining chases, rather than going after one person, and you are rewarded more pointwise for spreading hits and chaining chases than you are for applying a deep wound and then just following that same survivor- yes, spreading hits can be situational, but so can everything in this game). I hold firmly to the belief that gaining the highest amount of points you can is more of a win (though usually if you do this you’re going to get a few kills anyway- what I mean is that in my opinion a 4k game where you only got about 18k BP is much less impressive than a 2k game where you got 27k BP) but the point gain varies from killer to killer (some killers have abilities that are more necessary for gameplay and are therefore rewarded for ability use more than other things- ex. Freddy right now literally can’t do anything without using his ability, hillbilly could go a whole game without revving his chainsaw and still do very well).  Finding builds that compensate is what makes the game. Of course not everyone is going to be a Hillbilly god or the worlds greatest Plague- not everyone can accommodate to the playstyle those characters demand, and not everyone enjoys playing them. That doesn’t mean they’re bad, they have strengths in different ways for different people. The whole point of perks is to adjust the killers kit to suit the way you want to play and to fulfill the things you want to do (pain train bubba works on people who want to get kills, but a doctor with hypermegasuper madness and overcharge is someone who wants to prolong the game and milk some points). My point is the game is designed so that not all killers will be the same. That’s why abilities are so different, that’s why the abilities demand you adjust the way you play to use them well. You absolutely cannot play ghostface the same way you would play nurse; they’re completely different, but that doesn’t necessarily mean one is better than the other. With a combination of perks and a player who understands the kit, a ghostface can be way more efficient and deadly than a nurse, if you’re going purely for kills, since he can get a kill much quicker than nurse (doesn’t have to stalk for long, instadown), but in many ways a nurse can be more rewarding point wise because her playstyle prolongs the game. It just depends on what you want to get out of a match: points or kills.
---
So I'm forced to play with randoms? then how do people play with others on PS4? does everyone fucking play solo?
---
either a bug or the other survivor was sleeping too
---
Thats fine I'll just wait for you to jump off and down you again.
---
Never say never.
---
See, i play both survivor and killer, and I play every killer except doc and hag, and I also p3'd detective tapp, got all perks on him, and then decided i wanted to be Feng min because of the new year event I got for her. So the recent bloodpoints events have REEEEALLY helped me.
---
I main Lord Bing Bong at red ranks... its... FuUuN.
---
Please tell me you're not the killer
---
Well, I mean ... I can't argue that last point.  When you put it that way I don't know how I can't agree.
---
Chains ... chains with hooks ... make it happen.
---
I can never not run bond and do as good as I normally do.
---
Just learn on your own. Look up some quick tips videos ask politely for any tips. Skills will grow over time.
---
Spirit, Billy. And nurse are the only killers with an ability that is extremely lethal, good to use in a chase to cut them short, and good for using for just plain map navigation. If a killer doesn't have all 3, then they're stomped on regularly at high ranks.
---
Sorry
---
No mither didn't get any love lol.
---
this community is shit and full of a bunch of dickheads then because most reddits check the new section
---
There's a queue time to make a lobby, that's incredibly stupid because the killers are the hosts so having more lobbies could never be a bad thing.
---
What makes the spirit  a really good killer
---
I main doctor and I've never had a hallucination work like that in my favor lol
---
i can never spot ghost face, before its to late.
---
Hmm....dont know who didnt like that but okay. Sorry you didnt like it.
---
When playing as Spirit(add-on-less), you need to pick between chasing ability and map control; I usually pick the prior.  
---
Billy's pretty weak overall(when compared to other good killers); he only gets good results because most of the community has a hard time countering him. Billy's got great map control, but pretty poor chasing ability.
---
Two of them had decisive strike, but they all kept getting stuck on that staircase leading down to the basement. They accidentally kept body blocking each other and he kept getting them all, which is why I said BT didn’t help. I managed to unhook one person and got hurt in the process when we all were down there.
---
Yea you right but they all were meg potatoes who all died
---
Remember that there is a killer than can go through walls that ends chases in secconds... Fully invisible and a speed boost isn't that overpowered.
---
shut up boomer
---
This blows. I wish that wasn’t a thing.
---
She has amazing chasing capabilities and almost no counterplay, making her the second best killer in the game.  
---
If you were to ask for my killer tier list(against good survivors), Billy would be rather low - behind Hag and Huntress.
---
Apparently he started a twitch account but it’s probably not for gaming.
---
1. You are not helping the toxicity
---
2. Like how I didn’t know what LFG was at first many others might’ve not known either and decided to pass it
---
Pretty sure Kindred has a built-in maximum range on the killer aura, for some reason. 24m, I think.
---
Idk what’s worse your gameplay or thinking it was cool to upload this lol
---
:(
---
Im not even being rude. It sucks I had a leatherface do the same thing and he got one extra person. Dont reward them with more kills do the gens and leave.
---
I love iron will so much, I’m glad its portrayed how it is
---
No, I agree. As a killer main who has ended up putting near equal hours into Survivor I’ve realized that playing like that when the Squad has offered up 3 or 4 cakes will only dwarf the game score-wise for not only them but yourself. Unless a killer is faced with some Gen rushing group that doesn’t seem to care about netting any extra BP and is trying to rush the match themselves. I’m not saying a killer should feel any pressure to farm at all, I just don’t see a reason to not at least make it a fun match for all parties so everyone walks away with decent BP or a pip etc.
---
Disgusting. Don’t they know you’re supposed to know put at 99% and make sure everyone is fine?!?
---
Well I didn’t know...
---
Is this really a Scream movie? It looks so bad lmao. I thought this was a Scary Movie scene at first 😂
---
exactly, dbd sucks lol
---
So then the killer just hits you as you jump off?!??! There's no point in it. It just gives malicious survivors more tools to ruin the game for killers
---
Ok but GF is supposed to be a pure stealth killer and Myers is better at stealth then the pure stealth killer. You see what I’m saying?
---
One of the scariest moments is hiding in a locker near a gen, knowing ghostface/myers is going to check it any second, but tossing up whether to jump out/back in to refresh the crow timer.
---
So, I agree you play how you want, but being so toxic because he genuinely wanted too tell you this is bad. There really was no reason too go off the deep end like that.
---
Jack the ripper, some kind of Knight with a sword and a vampire killer.
---
*cue Squid Warden
---
There will be lots of people claiming it does that, but then when you look at the people already playing survivor with the new self-care, it will turn out neither of things actually happen.
---
You’re not wrong
---
I mean if the hook is right mext to the gate... maybe I have deadhard, metal, or ds? Maybe u opened the gate for me lol? Easy escape ;)
---
The only way you cant stop that senario is just bum rushing the basement, having borrowed and mettle and the killer being bad at aiming. The best survivors cant pull that off so dont feel bad about it.
---
\[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/7nmgPok.png](https://i.imgur.com/7nmgPok.png)) Also this is really annoying
---
Strongly disagree. If I am uninjured, I get lots of great information. I know when chases are going on. If I am the only one injured, I can find someone to heal me.
---
Yea u mad xD
---
I'm just saying I don't want to wait an extra minute every game because somebody is salty they didn't get hatch.
---
Well if i knew that was a thing id take you too a farther hook.
---
Yeah in the film, they're making a *Stab* movie. *Stab* is what producers in that universe decide to make based on the events of what happened in Scream 1. Apologies if that was confusing btw😂. Every character has their *Stab* version. It was a bit shit but I still love it👍
---
Why would I be mad if I wasn’t in the game?
---
They always go wander off to find the hatch... not like many people run deliverance.
---
Finishes something else too.... xD
---
Funny thing is i wasn't being "toxic" &amp; i didn't "go off" any "deep end". gosh, u sound like this guuy. but ur entitled to ur opinion, i just do not view it that way. This is my point. Everyone will see everything in their own way. &amp; you &amp; others may not like it/agree but others will. So sorry you happen to be the part that doesn't. :/ happy gaming.
---
It’s my least watched of the 4 so I wanted to see again why that was
---
I was giving him "genuine advice"
---
This one isn't too unbalanced honestly but you can generally avoid this by checking if it's a SWF in the lobby before the match...
---
What level was it?
---
I totally agree. I mean, cakes or not, the way I play as Doctor sort of drags matches out anyways (*Distressing, lots of shocking / snap outs, straight M1 Unrelenting killer*), but I'm a bit of a farmer as well, and run BBQ. 
---
If I get gen rushed to hell, all 4 escape and everything, I still walk away with 40k-50k worth of BPs (*with no cakes*) and am generally happy.
---
But to cut my legs off by rushing through and tunneling, well that makes no sense to me.
---
Then frenzy ends and you down them? Yeah like 90% of all the powers just help you get the first hit.
---
I considered that too actually but I mean have you seen Halloween? Myers is a sneaky bitch lol.
---
With the game being Free for Xbox via Game Pass and there was a free Weekend for people on Steam where they could get and keep the game. I'm assuming the game is flooded with inexperienced potatoes
---
No mither can work in a trolly sabotage build, it's what I used to get the wiggle free from killers grasp achievement. It's not as effective in terms of survival as just doing the gens, but it's necessary to be able to get up more than once when you know you'll be slugged a lot like that.  Still a more useful perk than Left Behind or something.
---
Yo first of all: Thank you for asking! Alot of people nowadays don't ask artists if they can use their work T\_T
---
Second: You totally can use it as long as you credit me in your bio (Or if someone asks about the pfp)! What's your twitch? I love supporting streamers :)
---
I wish I got killers like this. Instead I get 360 tomahawked from across the map by a huntress lmao.
---
Solo survivor mate
---
If I were to say I was the killer can you tell me why it’s so bad to complain?
---
To each their own. I have been having a lot of fun lately with her. When no one cleanses, it just makes them easy targets to down. Not to mention, you can hear them a lot easier with them throwing up everywhere. I don't need to use Corrupt Purge to have fun.
---
Are you Commie, comrade?
---
I want one I can't have - Jason. No way that'll ever happen, but it'd be sick if it could!
---
Yup. Has happened to me half a dozen times now. Even opening the other gate didnt work. I have been able to get the hatch most times when this happens...
---
A locker
---
Yup! I want those cosmetics so badly! I've been a fan of Phantom of the Opera since I was little and almost died when I saw that there were POTO cosmetics being released! Go look at them on the store, they're gorgeous!
---
Also: Welcome to Dead By Daylight! Thank you for commenting!!!
---
Ok I’m done here. If you want too “view” things differently then the rest of the community you can, but I guarantee that most people would agree you need too chill. I’m not entitled because I see you calling someone salty for literally saying “tunneling is not a good strat” and think hey, he’s pretty toxic tbh. All I said was chill, and you flip your lid. You gotta take a breather my dude because red ranks are getting too you xD.
---
And now you know. Best scene imo is when one of them runs into a costume room and it's full of Ghostface outfits.
---
Everyone who shits on a mimic killer because of SWF doesnt understand that we can find something to negate it. I mean tbh even without a fix this killer is gonna do okay. Having to ask your friend is gonna add time and it gives the killer time to get closer. The super try hard survivors are gonna be complete shit but tbh what killer isnt going to be shit on by a group like that. What they could do is have her look further away than she actually is. Like have a fake survivor walk behind you 10 meters while you're invisible. Survivor one asks if so and so is near them as soon as they see the "survivor" but the killer is already within lunge range. It isnt perfect by any means but it would be interesting.
---
To be fair, I'm at rank 17 (haven't played in a while). But those hindered hatchets are just dreadful :(
---
Lmao, sounds like you're the one who needs to chill. That's like a novel response. The thing is, i wasn't even "tunneling" him. But i'm not here to prove anything. I'm high so i'm already chill. Goodnight.  Xoxo
---
I actually preferred Us. Sure, the first half was kinda silly, which the second half helps to put it into context. But I enjoyed how much more interpretative it was compared to Get Out, which was just very easy to understand every bit of commentary it was making.
---
But I know that Us definitely had some problems as far as being too ambitious and is definitely not for everyone, leading to maybe too much interpretation in what it is overall message is.
---
Real mad lmao
---
Purple keys and pink/red keys will open the hatch along with the aura thing with add ons but if you just want to use the aura thing use the broken keys
---
I lost it at Pharmacy.
---
Confirmed you’re 16
---
I'm a little confused. Are we mad at the killer for fucking around before giving hatch or are we assuming he fucked up and bill got out without being given it?
---
I absolutely love you work, thank you so much!
---
Who is him?
---
Hey when I was a young dwight I helped as much as possible, dont disrespect my past
---
Easy targets to down make for boring, short chases to me.  
---
To each their own, though; if you have fun with Plague, keep playing as her.
---
NEED KILLER VERSION
---
Survivors most of the time for sure
---
...that doesnt seem bad.
---
After using them both for years, bond is way more versatile
---
Yup. I make it my goal to try not to kill unless everyone's been hooked once, and I avoid hooking people twice in a row. The rules start to fall away the closer the game is to being over, but I will never hook someone 3 times in a row when there's like 4 gens up.
---
Double the myers
---
I can’t use flashlights I don’t even play survivor but I know that was epic
---
The Doctor is great for exactly that type of play! I go a similar route as Spirit and usually feel fine with the 30k - 50k she averages. It’s painful as a Survivor to get face-camped and tunneled in a match with offerings like that walking away with sometimes absurdly little BP and possible a de-pip.
---
Thank you for the advice. I appreciate the perk help aswell!
---
We're not though since it's not Cannon
---
At first i took it as flattery getting facecamped cause i gave the killer the business, but now its 3 years later and its finally annoying lol
---
Same!
---
The rarity thing was tested and proven to be insignificant, so P your survivors but not your killers.
---
And that garbage h20 remake is? I don’t think so
---
Thanks, man. I'm trying to avoid turning chat off (I like to give the GGs at the end) but it just sucks, man. Sucks that the only way to handle to the salt is to completely disable the only real communication function.
---
Stellar work! How long did it take you?
---
This is true for me
---
"Loop this you casual" -Ghostface probably
---
It was also free on ps plus a month or 2 ago
---
I guess it's something I should get used to if I'm gonna stick to this for the long haul. Thanks for the kind words.
---
It is according to DBD
---
I look at in the way of a couple things. 
---
1: can the killer be effective without the survivor  making a mistake. Like how the spirit can down a survivor messing up (although a survivor can definitely slow down how quick they can be downed.) as long as the spirit plays as well or even better. 
---
But with bubba (unless you have a specific build or are on a specific map) 90% the survivor has to make a mistake to get downed by the chainsaw.
---
2: can the killer stop organized survivors. If survivors are fully focused on gens and are communicating can the killer reasonably fight that. Hillbilly can rush to a gen forcing the survivors off and can then chase survivors while still being able to apply pressure since at a moment's notice he can down someone hook them and then rush to a gen being to worked on.
---
Ghostface can't. If he is on someone all the gens he's not nearby are free realistate. He is great at downing people but if they spread out and communicate he has problems. He has to take perks to slow down the game otherwise those gens will be done even if he's playing perfectly.
---
For a killer to be good In my opinion if they do everything perfectly they should be able to get a 3-4K but since time is not on their side they have to be able to do things as quick as possible. If they  can't both down quickly and traverse the map quickly usually the survivors can make it so the killer doesn't have time to get to the gen before it gets set off.
---
BUT I love playing killers like clown and Myers since I find their playstyle fun, I just don't like feeling powerless as the power role since I can't get to them in time. So I have to use perks that slow the game down that don't require me being near the gen like ruin, but I also hate using ruin since it's super unreliable and unfun to play against as survivor.
---
So TL:DR. For the live of God let me play Myers without 3 gens going off in far side of the map while I'm running to them after getting a hook.
---
Anytime. Happy hunting my dude
---
It only gives you the bloody clothes. Someone did an experiment on whether prestige gave you a better chance at higher rarity items and it proved that you didn’t. I think the P0 bloodwebs yielded more high rarity items than the P3 ones.
---
Ash was the survivor, and pinhead is the killer if voiced well
---
Every time you prestige a character you lose all perks, items, addons, and offerings (besides each characters respective teachables on them). You gain a piece of their Bloody cosmetic set and a slight increase in rarer nodes on their bloodwebs each time you prestige though.
---
Bond is my favorite perk by far. When you play solo, information is so key to making smart decisions, hell even playing SWF it has it’s place. Knowing where your fellow teammates are can be a game changer when you need heals, doubling up on generators, avoiding them when being chased, and loads of other things. Just no weaknesses aside from it’s relatively short range in my opinion.
---
I was saying this too! Too bad for Friday the 13th game. Guess if you want to play Jason you can just buy it lol. But I get you
---
It's only how I play her, though. With Spirit, Hag, and Legion \[though they will at times mend and not heal when I play them\], it is typically a different playstyle.
---
Wasn't useless a week ago lol
---
man i install your perks, character portraits, and status icons before i go to work. And when i get back home you have items ready. Great work.
---
It's a behind the scenes photo of Robert Englund from one of the original movies I think, between scenes in full makeup
---
Dude the last too killed me XD
---
Exactly! There have been times where a previously hooked survivor just ends up right in front of me (_Wrong place, wrong time_) As a Killer where I’ve just instinctively downed them and then hooked them again as I’m not big on slugging, but generally I try to do the same and just dole out even punishment throughout the match hooking everyone once each for  BBQ at the very least and then I just keep pressure on the map bouncing between Gens and see how things shake out.
---
Nah, I think its a behind the scenes photo of Robert Englund smoking a joint between scenes or shots still in full makeup and costume
---
Fucking destroyed
---
It depends tbh
---
got 2 toxic profile comments for not going for a NOED facecamp solo save
---
So these are actors acting in a movie acting that they’re acting in a movie in a movie? 😆
---
They should be.
---
You mean empathy ? Unlimited range.
---
1. Playing in matches outside of SWF.
---
2. Being able to coordinate with your SWF without having to worry about locations.
---
3. Not accidently leading the killer to your buddy.
---
4. Seeing your buddy leading the killer your way before its too late.
---
 
---
Just a few off the top of my head . . .
---
Nah, the Friday the 13th franchise has all kinds of legal issues going on right now with the original writer, so even the F13 game is stuck and not able to do anything new with content.
---
If it weren't for that, I'm sure DBD could try and maybe get the rights for the mask of something, maybe even the music, who knows.
---
Fuck off with your crying
---
Serious question, is adrenaline really that good, especially when all 4 survivors have it? I mean I know it's a decent perk, better than left behind or streetwise, but I've personally been thinking about why it's so highly rated. 
---
Here's how I look at it: let's imagine all 4 survivors have Adrenaline. One of them is being chased, the rest on the final gen together. The person in chase might get an advantage with the sprint burst and maybe a heal if they take a hit, but this could also be countered with noed. But the other 3 get seemingly no use out of it, maybe a free heal and a speed boost to the door, but that's nothing they couldn't have done without the perk, so it feels like a wasted perk slot on those 3 survivors. 
---
And I know that Adrenaline can make for some clutch plays. I've once hit ds (new ds) only to be immediately healed by adrenaline. I've seen like 2 or 3 slugged people all picked up by Adrenaline. But with how infrequent these types of scenarios happen, I feel like banking on the perk for moments like these is also a bit of a waste.
---
Again, I dont think adrenaline is useless. I definitely recognize it as a good perk, and it definitely has its uses and moments, but I've been trying to wrap my head around as to why its rated so high. Perhaps somebody could explain?
---
Yea. I don’t really k ow what’s going on with that. I just heard lawsuit that’s it lol
---
The one who says "we'll be safer if we stick together" is an actor within the films universe so I get she's meant to be exaggerated and dramatic about everything. The other two are genuine chatacters in *Scream*.
---
Clauds, not Claud's.
---
I haven't played dbd in months,  what's the infinity gauntlet perk
---
Same, they hate dbd
---
I feel like Pinhead is likely soon
---
Um source?
---
yea didnt want the video to be that long but he used his unbreakable before the beginning of this video amd didnt have it. he was actually a pretty smart player if you had the chance to watch the match lol
---
That is actually something every killer can do in that exact loop (at least those with 115% movement speed)
---
Funnily enough, that's the one time I feel okay about slugging. If I slug the unhooked person, their game does not have to end way to early AND it gets someone else off a gen to pick them up. I like to go for the furthest I see on BBQ too, generally to ensure there's someone to unhook the hooked person (and catch the sickness), but also to spread the sickness around as a plague main.
---
didnt his detection radius just "fixed" like 4% on each side? I thought that was pretty reasonable but i dont really mind, hes still awesome and so much fun to play and play against
---
Yeah, I know, survivors used to be able to on some rocks as well, but uh, thought they fixed most of it
---
That would be horrible because you can't account for every situation. What about ehen vamping is necessary? You just get a big fuck you? Camping is fine the way it is, the Killer sacrifices points as is to camp. The Killer just trades all the points and potential kills for one confirmed kill when they camp. Sucks for that one guy but it's bad game design to try to cater to everyone individually.
---
Don’t you also get increased chances for better offerings,addons, and weapons? Even then it’s probably not worth it but it’s just a little extra.
---
That one, and I enjoy when they show Randy’s tape explaining the new rules.
---
Fucking chains with hooks! The game already has the hooks, we just need the chains!
---
Close the chat bubble, disable comments on your profile, never accept random friend requests. These are the rules I follow now, after a long and disgusting day of death threats and racial slurs. The game is fun, but the handful of toxic scum can easily make you take a month long break.
---
Literally the only thing that could be done. Is just don't go down near that basement. Legit haha sucks I know.
---
inactivity crows won't help versus active players that are just hiding however. They are just to notify the killer of an afk.
---
As I said I wish it was similar to the emblems. In that if another survivor is with a 16m radius the killer wouldnt lose anything. But when camping for sheer toxicity that would be when they lose.
---
im not mad at the killer even though he teabagged since the beginning of the match lol. he definitely didnt plan on giving hatch this match with how toxic he was this match(someone else bleed out while he teabagged earlier). he even put “LOL” in chat after haha.
---
It's my birthday today xD
---
Bill or David tho
---
Again it's a bad design because it can be played around. 16m is not that big and an experienced survivor can hang out just outside that radius and the killer gets punished. It's like when you are chasing someone but you never actually enter a chase, you follow them and know where they are but the game doesn't acknowledge it. They can't code for every possibility and unless they do it it's just a big fuck you to the killer.
---
Created before the MoM rework?
---
oh no...you farmed me and now you got downed with noed...whatever shall we do?? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Swing through pallets of the survivor could get hit. They’ll throw it down if you swing close, removing the pallet. Beyond that, try to predict their moves.
---
New leaks? Any links?
---
I'm getting one ebony every bloodweb, this shit is so easy to get
---
Happy birthday then!!
---
More like Kate. She sings and she channels the power of man on the mountain yelling when she gets hooked.
---
Like nationwide threat
---
i wanna see all survivors - not just those that are hurt.
---
I have 3 splinters for the pig on my pig
---
Yeah you're right lol I fixed it
---
Only reason that ain't the case is because they're in the entity's world. It's why killers get special abilities and as I'm assuming, increased strength and stamina. If they weren't in the entity's realm, then for sure David would literally flip any member of The Legion upside down.
---
I feel pretty bad when I get 3 kills and the last one hook was on their first hook, and the last person leaves them to die. Feels pretty bad, and sucks for them. It's not like you can unhook someone, otherwise I might sometimes.
---
is there portraits too? link please?
---
Sometimes I just... fuck up... no reason why... I just do... fuck...
---
It's beacose when you play killer they are all swf :(
---
I bought the entire saw chapter dlc from the steam store when it came out. I have never had or used Auric Cells. And it still has given me 3 splinters for the pig on my pig.
---
I have a better idea make it so it's optional but hitting the hook survivor causing them to go to the basement and have 2/3 tokens to make it balanced or only make it  from a certain distance. Just though I'd put my idea in as well also pretty good rework idea you got.
---
Well this may come to be a shocker to everyone but I do have an inside source that works on that and they told me a few things so first and for most it will come out on August 27 the year I will not disclose just yet because him and I are under an NDA and the details more details will be released as we come closer to release. Have a wonderful day gents

---
THIS IS REALLY CUTE AWE
---
Yeah you must not have gotten the memo. All killers are required to go to a corner of the map (chosen by survivors, this is why they have a pointing emote) and count to ten after doing any action. Hitting a survivor increases this time by 10 seconds per hit. Hooking a survivor means you have to wait until they are unhooked and then you start counting. Also if you see them healing you are supposed to leave and let them finish and get onto a gen before you even think of chasing them. You have to accept the teabagging, flashlight spamming and genrushing but are not allowed to camp, tunnel or bring a mori. Oh and certain perks are banned as killer as well but survivors are allowed to bring whatever they want. Also if by some miscalculation on the survivors part they end up all dying except one you are obligated to down them and bring them to the hatch. This is a service tended to any and all survivors by all killers. Not doing all of these things makes you a shit killer. Speaking of being a shit killer you are required to accept any and all insults hurled at you and get impotently angry so they can post it on reddit or the forums and jerk each other off over it. 
---
/S for anyone who doesnt understand sarcasm.
---
I disagree.    I am a claudette main and I do preety good at rank 1
---
Yeah that's good, shouldn't have killed Randy imo.
---
If they have the infinite get that pallet dropped asap ( on you if need be) and break it. Loop gone keep going.
---
Mind games are your friend, if you think they cant see you as you go around a wall do a quick 180 and see if one down a turn into you.
---
Its trial and error for the most part and what works for me might not be your thing. If pallets continue to give you grief try Legion (vaulting them in fury), Nurse (blink past them), Clown (hit it with a bottle), Trapper ( put a trap on it), Hag (same as Trapper), Spirit (Haunting) Doctor (shock them so they can't drop pallet), Huntress (toss a axe - requires aim and timing) or you could try perks that help you break pallets easier.
---
Best advice is if a chase is going on too long break away for someone else, you don't want 3x survivors doing gens while your chasing the fourth any longer then needed. Chances are that guy will go for a save and you'll get another chance.
---
Claudete + P3 = toxic
---
Ninja Wraith or Agro Wraith are fuckin' scary as hell.
---
And here we see a survivor main doing what they do best. Which is be a cunt for no reason. Watch as he comments back about how he plays killer and survivor and is rank 1 with both.
---
By swing he means lunge, gets better reach/speed.
---
that would really shorten the list of people he greeted
---
This is normal for winners in countries like China. google that shit. Some great disguises.
---
My bad, forgot to use specific terms.
---
I find it’s more effective, especially in chase, to use her phase walk power in short bursts. When I first started playing her I would use phase walk until the power bar ran out and I wasn’t having much luck.
---
That being said, I’m still a mediocre at best Spirit so I’ll lurk for more tips.
---
Happened to me twice today
---
Solid point, I’m a console player myself but I watch a lot of pc DBD players on YouTube so I’m just used to hearing spirit referred to as second best
---
I'd like more mythological killers. Someone mentioned that behavior dont want to go down this route but some more monstrous killers would be super super cool imo. My friend would like a killer whose all about grappling and just being a hulking brute. For survivor? I dont really care because they are just skins and the only characters I like dont make sense cus they get stripped down to a bare bones level. Like even ash doesnt make sense cus he wouldnt just play the game like a loser he would kill the killer then go find the entity and shoot it in the head.
---
The only canon is the new Danny McBride one ! I loved it
---
Good stuff thanks for the ideas, having it limited in range is definitely a good idea.
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
Nah bud it ain't 0%. Get your immersion on and keep an eye and ear out for the killer. Swap between the gates if he just camps once he sees the lights start up. Against stealth killers it can be much harder but clown is ez pz levels.
---
Springtrap from fnaf as a killer.
---
Some people made some ideas for what he would be like.
---
Would be interesting and he would fit with the themes of each killer as Springtrap would fit the robot style slasher villain similar to how other killers like doctor for different slasher styles
---
Playing killer against a swf group feels the same. U catch a survivor and your totem pops. U hook him and three gens pop. And after all gens are done, all 4 survivors are alive, u catch that toxic Jeff with the flashlight and you try to secure your kill, so you kinda proxi the hook, then in the post game chat they give u so much shit 4 camping their boy when all you were trying to do is secure ur kill. Makes u want to die :(
---
Yep if you ever decide to come back to the Monstrous shrine idea then use mine if you want as I definitely don't mind it.
---
Not necessarily bugged, probably people just expect it to do something different. As I understand it, P3 can’t give you any better bloodwebs than P0, it just increases the chances that higher rarity nodes spawn.
---
So the chance for „rare“ nodes keeps going up between P1 and P3. IIRC, your typical lvl 50 bloodweb should have either 5 or 6 „rare“ nodes, independent of prestige level. So it only increases the chance of the 6th node spawning which might happen in P0-50 bloodwebs often enough anyway so that no difference is perceived.
---
I do P3 just to have a maxed out character. If you want good stuff from bloodwebs, then pouring the bloodpoints it would take you to reach P3-50 by re-leveling your character through lower levels where no or few nodes of higher rarity appear into P0-50 webs instead is probably going to get you far more good stuff.
---
I currently only want it for the achievements related to it
---
As a Spirit main I feel like I can give some tips.  
---
You really need to pay attention to noise in the game especially while playing Spirit, In most cases I go for a first hit then use my power to catch up to survivors. Surveillance is a pretty good perk for her as is Whispers they both give good info if survivors are in the area, and once you get used to the range of whispers you can tell if someone is on a gen based on when it lights up. While learning her predator/stridor would be useful perks because they will allow you to utilize your ability better, I would take them off eventually because there are much more valuable perks that could use their slots.   
---
For builds I run: Ruin, BBQ&amp;Chili, Surveillance, Enduring.   
---
Ruin is super valuable on all killers especially at lower ranks when survivors can't hit skill checks as well.   
---
BBQ is great for applying pressure on key areas, with your power you can get to where they were a lot faster than most killers.  
---
Surveillance is key if you want to apply pressure when they split up you can kick a gen and get a notification when someone starts working on it. You can also replace this with spirit fury to get some nasty hits in after you get it to proc.   
---
As for enduring it allows you to swing through pallets without being punished too harshly.  Works well with Spirit fury too.  
---
Spirit moves pretty fast while coming out of her power so you can use this to your advantage and hit people who are healing at pallets, working on gens without respecting the fact you are around. etc.  
---
For her addons Prayer beads is really strong, it allows you to mind game effectively and pretend using your power by not moving players will often try to double back if you do something like this, the most effective time personally is when someone throws down a pallet some times the survivor will slow vault back over to where you really are and you can grab them. Other addons are pretty much personal preference though  
---
If you have any more questions feel free to ask.
---
They sound like maroons.
---
I support feng in their transition
---
Since others have said Spirit, potential killers for 4th and 5th place are huntress and hag, both are kinda map dependent, huntress due to hitboxes and hag due to distance from traps (unless you run mint rag). Definitely two killers worth getting good at
---
and god damn pips...
---
Oh trust me I know how it is as killer especially when your playing a weaker killer like wraith or doctor.
---
Which killer were you playing?
---
Did they wait till you hit struggle then get pulled off the hook and slugged? Sadly that’s how my game ended.
---
I would say it should be more like an inactivity thing. If the survivor hasnt done a certain amount of gen progress or being near the killer in a certain period of time they start getting the crows or even a wound meter.
---
You mean when you work a gen to 25%, no ruin, and then someone comes over and manages to pop it off in like 0.02 seconds and then sprint away?
---
Yeah i can but honestly so much people whine about the survivor edition with the perks etc, i made it because its supposed to be a joke. I havent played killer in light years so no idea what the meta is or other good perks. If you tell me ill try
---
That crutch WGLF is just way too op.
---
EGC timer is 2 minutes. Gates open in 20 seconds. You have time.
---
[Harder, way harder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ria6tCiQufQ)
---
New player, what do you mean by this? I’m working on Meg because I like sprint burst a lot and want to have it for all my characters. I’m grabbing the other teachables on my way, but when I do bloodweb I’m grabbing everything until it forces me to the next level. Is this the correct way to do it? What should I do after I get Adrenaline and Sprint Burst? Or am I doing it wrong?
---
Tombstone + tuft of hair myers when level 3 is achieved
---
Spine chill is the most underrated perk in the game don’t @ me
---
You messed up the link, I think. Here:
---
[https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Wake_Up!](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Wake_Up!)
---
Hello there!
---
They could at least run BT if they’re gonna do that.
---
*Mate*
---
Running a specific perk means you can’t complain about something that has been pretty messed up? Noed truly isn’t a huge deal, with how fast survivors can get gens done, even when the killer is doing well, there should be time to get the totems cleansed, and I say that as someone who a majority of the time plays survivor
---
They also nerfed some of his most useful addons so like gngnhhngghn
---
This is the only change to WGLF I could ever be on board with.
---
Party hat head cosmetics for everyone.
---
*everyone*
---
Pinhead is the one I want in the game the most. 
---
It’d be interesting to see what they’d come up with for his power. I always picture something ranged.
---
havent seen 270 k screenshots yet?
---
What’s up lil homie!
---
r/SpongeByDaylight
---
People will still complain about NOED unfortunately
---
Actually kay and peele are both mixed with black and white
---
Thunder sounds*
---
Also it's the single worst hex perk in the game by itself. I could hit a no sound skillcheck after only &lt;10 hours of survivor gameplay on my first match against huntress.
---
That perk could be a non-hex and it would still barely see play
---
Ruin tip: searching for ruin can waste more time then just working through ruin. 
---
If you hit a normal ruin skill check it will regress the gen 5% AND stop your progress for a second or two. After you hit a good ruin skill check, get off the gen for a second so you can’t get a skill check while the progress is stopped.
---

I once heard the community is small in terms of nice people and big in terms of toxicity. I suggest you ignore them and move on, or if you feel annoyed because of their constant insults in chat, report em. It’s a viable report option if correct, alongside disconnecting.
---
HAVING CHAT TURNED ON DOES NOT SPARK JOY!
---
Well truthfully it doesn't sound like you're doing anything wrong; Teachables unlock in a certain order, so if you're shooting for a perk that unlocks at like, level 40, you should probably just go ahead and grab the others along the way, right? But if you don't want them you can also ignore them and continue on with cheaper nodes to save bloodpoints until you get to the one you want if you'd rather do that.
---
Hilariously enough, a disappointing reality.
---
they wait till right after you hit struggle phase to unhook
---
How cool would that be, though?
---
At that point you should focus on protecting gens. The survivor will gladly die
---
It’s a comedy show. It’s not that deep.
---
Honestly it's way better than that, I mean just check Painreliever's stuff. But from my experience it autocounters all stealth killers except tier 1 Myers, it helps you sneak, it counters mindgames, it basically gives you an absurd amount of info, you just have to know how to use it.
---
It happens when a survivor is facing directly at the killer
---
I had a claud run to me and leave. Thank god for deliverance
---
Sabo squads rendering the game unwinnable without slugging, BNP squads completing four gens at once, MoM squads rendering M1 killers impotent... yeah. Sure.
---
I prefer rob zombie’s Halloween and the first half of Halloween II
---
Honestly it’s cool if they have the penalty until the exit gates are opened.
---
No you lost. It just wastes everyones time
---
God forbid they take a hook for anyone or make a smart play.
---
I bring cakes and get flashed and teabagged. I wish i had the luck of finding farming survivors
---
Wait, broken? Is it bugged currently?
---
You kidding? Those are some motherfucking precious wglf STACKS you're talking about
---
No, it’s just extremely good being able to tell if the killer is in a chase or damaging gens away from you
---
Combined with DS, you might be able to make it to an open gate or hatch. Depending on scenario ofc.
---
Hella pull ups
---
It’s hard for me to decide if I want to farm them or leave them on the hook when they get caught.
---
He still didn't wiggle.
---
That’s good to hear, I am glad to know that I shouldn’t worry about taking her to 50. Thanks man.
---
I usually lurk here, but this reminded me of how I thought when I first picked up DBD. I was in the same boat as you. Heres some advice that I wish someone told me when I started playing. You are NOT responsible for the fun of anyone else in the lobby. Fun is subjective and every individual player is responsible for their own fun. If you feel like camping, tunneling, or slugging, do it (as long as you arent cheating). There is one question I ask when Im thinking of how I want to play. Effectiveness, Scummy-ness, and Viability arent important. **Will it be fun for me?** If yes: Do it. If no: Don't. It's that easy. Disregard anyone elses opinion. Its a game to be played for your own enjoyment.
---
First of all there's no such thing as infinites anymore.
---
And just don't respect pallets and you'll be fine.
---
Daddy Michael
---
When I do No Mither plays I pair it with: Iron Will (I - III), Dead Hard, and Deliverance.
---
I tried playing with Resilience and it's... Okay? Personally I think it's a bit useless as you're only saving about 2 seconds on a generator, so about 78 seconds for finishing a gen. I've been wanting to use Tenacity but don't have it on my Adam T\_T And I might try TINH but it seems a bit useless as well since I hit skillchecks (Even ruin SC) pretty well.
---
Hell yeah. Get that national single payer self care!
---
I downloaded this and it has no audio
---
I go hard on everyone equally if you brought cakes I’m gonna make you work for those cakes if you didn’t bring cakes well I’m still gonna stomp your face in
---
DUDE USUALLY WHEN SURVIVORS TBAG AFTER YOU LET THEM GO ITS TO SAY THANKYOU. I MEAN IF I COULD SAY I LOVE YOU AS SURVIVOR I TOTALLY WOULD, BUT ALL I CAN DO IS POINT AND TBAG :(
---
Should've been a rancor mori
---
Go get 'em, tiger. smh
---
No not really she’s good but Billy is still better his gen pressure is the best in the game Spirit is a close third behind Nurse and Spirit
---
I mean, shit, if i was to be hooked, i'd probably screm even louder and way longer.
---
If you want to play a viable strong killer go with Spirit she’s the third best killer but if you want a fun killer try Clown he’s pretty good and I think he’s really fun
---
In both endings, this scene happens. What happens right after is different tho
---
Billy has good chasing he can close gaps pretty easily also if you say the community is having a hard time countering him that means he’s good and hard to counter there’s a reason he’s number 2 and has the best map pressure
---
Actually we're going to get free blood points at the end of the match by making the blood point millionaire's pay for it.
---
Most fun killer is Ghost Face strongest is Nurse 
---
And to answer your question it would be nice if more killers had map pressure of any kind and gen stopping power because the point of the killer is to stop gens being done and that’s kinda hard when 3 gens get popped in the first minute of the game before you even have the chance to get to a gen
---
I prestiged Claudette for the cloaking tech. Can recommend you are literally invisible in many situations with the bloodied clothes.
---
Except it does jackshit against chainsaw, if you are healed.
---
Lol I got them all. Any one of them could be buffed in the future I wanna be prepared!
---
Jason Vorhees from (begrudgingly) the remake, since I presume the rights to the originals will still be under lock and legality forever.
---
An for a survivor I want whoever Jared Pedaleki played as lol
---
Doc learned Spirit's ability
---
All the more reason for me to run Decisive if they ever implemented that.
---
I think hopes actually useful honestly the speed can save you're ass if you get spotted
---
You aren’t the greatest then no offense but Spirit not only gets obliterated by certain perk you can again juke the fuck out of her if you know what your doing Billy may not have the greatest time in pallet loops but he still has the best map pressure and a one shot he makes the best use of BBQ and Chili he can fucking guard his totem like a god he can find survivors so easily and again he can use his chain saw to trick a survivor in to going around a loop more and even fucking start revving a chain saw before he gets to pallet to destroy it
---
Its because you aren’t letting his afk ass live
---
Just use wake up
---
Haddonfield is a garbage fire. Its the only map that makes me want to disconnect. Some maps are killer sided, and others are survivor sided. Haddonfield is just. Ugh. I've always hated it. Its just entirely too safe for survivors and is anti-fun for all of my killers except Nurse (obviously).
---
Remember when you started playing and you were a potato?
---
Yeah, let them learn, nobody gits gud in a day.
---
This does not sound personal at all.
---
Also yes you can do that to the Spirit just get this LOOP AND OUT SMART HER it’s not that hard predict where she is and hop through a window run fucking Dance With Me and watch her get fucked seriously you are seriously over estimating a killer because of how hard she is to go against personally for you
---
Ir he could just get better? No-one should lose their job, unless they've broken some rule or law.
---
Can we just get a general ban on any posts referring to toxicity except for discussions? I didn't think this game was even toxic until I came to the subreddit
---
"Anyone who disagrees with me is salty and bad at the game."
---
If only more killers other than Freddy could do this :(
---
Ya but here’s the problem. Myers is only suppose to be stealthy in tier one and unless you are running scratched mirror, you want to enter tier 2 with him then he can use tier 3 and instadown multiple survivors. All I’m say is that why is a semi stealth killer better at sneaking the the pure stealth killer.
---
In my experience it's pretty mixed. It's either a p3 claudette who sits on the edge of the map doing nothing or a really good claudette who can loop for 5 gens, constantly trying to get the killers attention
---
Also forgot one thing 110% movement speed if you nuke her power even once that chase is gonna go on forever even if she hits you you can again loop her for a really long time
---
Oh look, another person who's jumped to the wrong conclusion.
---
Ghostface is legit stronger now than he was before.
---
And if you want to make this even more confusing; up until after production ended, Scream was originally called Scary Movie
---
You're a good person. This community is severely lacking in empathy.
---
The counter to Billy feathering his chainsaw is to play pallets safely.  
---
You are entitled to your own opinion; if you think Billy's better than Spirit, go ahead, but that tells me you haven't seen a good Spirit; any good Spirit will be able to track down survivors and kill them much more efficiently - if you're going up against a coordinated team, Billy is worthless, while Spirit still has a chance.  
---
I play Billy way too much, and I can assure you it's easy to counter him if you know what you're doing.
---
She looks more baked than a Digiorno pizza
---
OH MY FKN GOD
---
A good Spirit will use her power in short bursts, making sure her power is almost always up.
---
The only good bit is the whooshing sound is gone. They nerfed most of his most useful addons.
---
BILLY USELESS YOU FUCKING GOOBER I’m sorry but you are obviously not getting something Billy can ducking destroy if he knows what he’s doing he can close the distance in seconds he’s 115% movement speed he can ONE SHOT he still has the best map pressure no in the history of this game has ever called Billy bad or anything but top tier for that matter so I’m obligated to believe my hours and hours on him and against him and the rest of the community
---
If you think it's that easy to just out-smart a killer that can feel for where you are, you're wrong.  
---
The whole point is that you can't out-smart her.
---
CANT OUT SMART you here that guys you can’t out smart another person on one of the hardest killers in the game this is some great fucking news guess she’s better then Nurse now
---
I will say Billy is top tier, but he's much worse than Spirit, Hag, and Huntress(on a good map for her) against any team of competent survivors.
---
The thing is that he's had the same job since the game first came out.
---
If you think about every dlc map is always terrible for killers (ormond, red forest) so he's not really getting better, is he?
---
They nerfed one set of add-ons to prevent instant stalking when leaning. That was about a uncounterable as old Frank's Mixtape.
---
Having actual stealth is a fair trade, I feel.
---
I assume it’s killer mains down voting because it’s beneficial to them 😂 so cute.
---
It's only "personal" because I play killer and I have to endure awful maps like haddonfield because the guy whose job is to make playable and balanced maps isn't doing his job.
---
Never have I said she was better than Nurse. Why do you feel the need to claim I said stuff I clearly haven't?
---
They claim they try buffing the least used perks continually, which does seem to happen.
---
HUNTRESS HAG 
---
HOLY SHIT IM GONNA HAVE A FUCKING SEIZURE first off juking hatchets his easy and rocks and cars basically fuck her over also 110% movement speed 
---
And Hag seriously come on man
---
New jungle gyms are better than the old ones. Plus, 2 of the last 4 maps have been quite good for Killers; Temple of Purgation and Father Campbell's Chapel.
---
Uhmayze3ng qualtitty 🤡
---
You saying you can’t put smart a killer 
---
That is a very very VERY stupid thing to say
---
Cleansing every dull totem wastes too much time in the long run and you never no if it's worth it because you can never tell if they have noed. You're better off just doing gens in the long run
---
And honestly, dull totems as a mechanic needs reworking, there's too much RNG involved in where they spawn.
---
It would've taken nothing at all to post that... and yet, you did anyway...
---
I disagree about the chapel. The center building can be hell depending on which windows spawn open. And if a survivor has balanced landing you can forget about catching them on it.
---
Spine chill is great because it starts telling you their coming even before the terror radius
---
And killers need to check beside the gates more often it works too much
---
hindered if they are already injured. and healing stops that. balanced landing should also stop that from happening
---
all of our lives
---
Honestly thats true, they are already indipendent and try their best, Jake mains are also chill
---
what caught my eye was the P. Elliot Lunacy ticket. now that's a relic
---
*kills everyone in the room with the check*
---
IM SO SICK OF GHOSTFACE. ACTUALLY JUST TIRED OF PLAYING THE SWEATIEST SWEATLORD GHOSTFACE WITH NOED AND A MORI LITERALLY EVERY GAME.
---
Avoiding noed IS the incentive.
---
If you give everyone a heads up whether it's coming or not, it ruins part of the effect which is, whether you bring it or not, survivors have to consider not rushing the fuck out of gens because it's a threat.
---
Spritburst works given you also have urban evasion, something to help you move faster than walking at best, as for a perk I honestly dislike, is bond. Yes you can see teammates from a short distance through walls, but it just doesn't really have a purpose, other than to strategize, but when you're playing solo, it's useless to use

Bond top tier? Eh whatever
---
She's not in the "chosen 3" but if you get your aim on point a good Huntress is a nightmare to play against.
---
Of course if you botch to many hatchet throws your still just a M1 killer with a 110 speed.
---
Other then that Spirit is good and Clown is fun for shutting down loopers.
---
Try everyone an make your own fun. Any killer can be played at red ranks, Ive taken Trapper to red ranks plenty of times an had a blast.
---
Just do you :)
---
The general rule is if you teabag someone you should expect to be teabagged back you idiot fucking Christ he teabagged it ain’t the end of the world survivors have been doing it for this games whole existence you fucking moron
---
The reason survivors get less cakes per bloodweb is because of the fireworks. Tell BHVR you don't want the stupid fireworks if you want more cakes.
---
The guy is ruining your fun,by being an asshole,but if you hit em back, theres the problem, grand logic mate
---
Little tippo from a player with 1000 hours, don't go for self care, sprint burst, or urban evasion. They're all perks that seem good on the surface to new players but in all reality are extremely bad. If you'd like an explanation of why they are just let me know.
---
Yo borrowed time is my shit though, I staple it into my all my builds
---
I'll even run a med kit to self heal than take it out
---
I actually like the concept before Dead hard, Horrible name but due to laggy killers the perk rarely activates in time
---
I've actually gotten 34 firecrackers and only 12 cakes all event. Its wild.
---
It is tho, it gives you so much information
---
New killer confirmed
---
Key and Peele, the two comedians that made this sketch, are both half white and half black so it's not racism. But specifically, this skit is about code switching and refers to how Obama would often code switch based on his audiences, but obviously exaggerated for comedic effect.
---
In short, most people code switch in some way. It's a linguistics term that simply refers to switching the words/phrases, even tone of voice and accent, and even actions depending on where you are and who you're talking to. For example, you wouldn't go into a business meeting or job interview using slang or saying "'sup, my guys" as a greeting, but you might use those things when talking with friends or family. Or another example, someone raised in a household that only speaks Spanish, but grows up going to American schools where they would then learn English, they might only use Spanish when speaking with their family but then only speak English when they're outside of their home (at school, work, etc) - of course you wouldn't speak in Spanish to someone that doesn't understand it so you'd have to switch to English. Those are just a few quick examples I could think of, it can go deeper and beyond that, but there's plenty of good videos on YouTube or other forms of information online if you just search up "code switching".
---
You should get a chance even without Deliverance, I can't even count how many games I could've escaped if I kobe'd as the last survivor. Not because the killer walked away but because of the perks I had and the distance from the gate I would have definitely had a chance..
---
Me as Ghost Face “don’t mind if I do”
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
I just go for the most toxic first, had a flashlight Claud blind me every pallet break (I’m Myers btw). Kept following, breaking, get blind. Stalked others, then found and hooked her before I popped tier 3, hooked her 3 times before I even downed anyone else
---
Where is my Spirit body pillow BHVR
---
I'm uncomfortable
---
I would love a Baby Face killer if we got Tree as a survivor I’d probably main her she’s one of my favorite horror movie protagonist 
---
And The bitch from us would be weird because her whole thing is she’s hunting down her self what would her ability be not sure I liked the movie but I’m not sure how’d she work (also it be kind weird to have a killer and survivor look identical
---
You’d think they’d know that survivors would prefer items that double their points in a game over a one use poor mans flashlight that the killer has to be a complete potato to get blinded by...
---
oh ok
---
Yeah, I would say killer is tense but survivor is really tilting if you fuck up.
---
It should but does not
---
Adreniline should be more loved tho
---
The fucking trailer had me hyped as shit i just randomly got it as an ad and I’m like okay some new family movie and THEN BOOM the people appear and the kid says “it’s Us” and I’m like HOLY SHIT it had me so hyped for the movie from then on
---
But... Adrenaline rewards having done your objective.... doing generators. Dead Hard can easily be countered with literal patience. Sure you can miss the first time cause you didn’t know, but after that it’s useless. It’s not gonna help you win like NOED does, not the same thing
---
It’s 128 meters not unlimited
---
This is clearly on PC my man, but your not wrong about the Xbox scene.
---
Pallets do need, and are getting, a change.
---
Devs are making it so there are more pallets, but most of them are unsafe.
---
Fucking survivors and their toxicity. Using an OP farming perk! with a healing perk that takes 32+ seconds to heal!!! And don't get me started on DH it's so OP there is literally no counter to it! The game automatically press M1 when I'm close to them and they just dead hard away, god i wish the game would stop pressing M1 for me when survivors are injured so i can bait it or if there is an exhaustion add on for us kIlLeRs MaiNS
---
Yes I will as I need all the points I could get
---
Rah! Semper Gumby
---
Wait you can play as a person that you dont have in the bloodweb
---
Thank God! Now if the gens would be harder, I'd be happy as a clam. Thank you for telling me this!
---
DS. IMO perks for survivors affect your chances of winning a lot more than killers, and wasting a slot on something I get once doesn’t seem right.
---
Isn’t Gamepass available on PC for most via beta?
---
Velociraptor and Dr. Malcolm/Dr. Alan
---
If its Dr. Malcolm I want Jeff Goldblum's laugh when he enters the lobby
---
And if its Dr. Alan, I want Raptor to say 'Alan!' every time he enters in the chase with him/mori him
---
Ghostface came out causing everyone to play him but queues are way better then last week and pipping is just stupid currently
---
Hmm, I'm not sure, I've been interested in finding out if the games played though the MS app still play with the Steam players as well.
---
Hard to imagine MS would allow crossplay with steam with how greedy they've been about it in the past.
---
But I may be wrong, hopefully someone comes in here with more information for us.
---
Hi carl
---
The Meg went into the locker when I was stabbing her and then she got stuck on top of it and I couldn't get her... it took me too long to realise she was up there...
---
Thanks
---
It happend to me too, but with Freddy. Probably a bug with the dlc
---
I wish we could just revamp the bloodweb while we're at it. So many useless perks show up early on and do nothing but become bp traps for new players.
---
I agree,
---
When I play the survivor I get the worst teamates (half of the time)
---
But when I play killer I get good survivor 75%of the time
---
Thank you!!
---
I’m at 120. Everytime I use one, I gain 2-3 more.
---
I mean, neither is NOED sooo
---
Lucky! Ill have to take a look at the bundles soon
---
This was all I was about to say I beat re2 like 5 times
---
- 5-10 seconds of not leaving hook AND not starting a chase (this is important): hook progression slows by 50%.
---
- 15-20 seconds: hook progression (and jazz music) stops.
---
- 30 seconds: survivor frees himself and is applied borrowed time.
---
This is how you solve camping.
---
Tru3 Talent fan?
---
yet though, waiting at the exit gate for someone getting chased to escape is the whole point of waiting but waiting at the exit gate like that is stupid. specially aginst spirit bet they are at the green ranks
---
Getting gens, you?
---
Alright, how have they been nerfed?
---

WHY DID YOU BLAME ME FOR LOSING WHEN YOU LITERALLY RAN INTO ME MULTIPLE TIMES IN ONE MATCH??? ITS NOT MY FAULT YOU’RE A TERRIBLE PLAYER DON’T BLAME ME FOR THAT YOU ASSHAT. I EVEN LET YOU WIGGLE OUT OF MY GRASP TWICE CAUSE I FELT BAD THAT YOU KEPT RUNNING INTO ME BUT THEN YOU AND YOUR FRIEND WHO HID IN A LOCKER THE ENTIRE MATCH DECIDED TO FLIP OUT ON ME IN POST GAME CHAT??? MAYBE NEXT TIME DON’T  VAULT DIRECTLY INTO THE KILLER AND YOU’LL MANAGE TO ESCAPE. ALSO HIDING IN A LOCKER DIRECTLY IN MY LINE OF SIGHT AFTER LOOKING BACK AND SEEING ME CHASE YOU WAS A DUMB MOVE THAT CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR DEMISE. THANK YOU TO THE NEA AND MEG WHO STUCK UP FOR ME AND CALLED THOSE TWO PLAYERS OUT ON THEIR BULLSHIT. I HOPE BOTH OF YOU(NEA AND MEG) MANAGE TO ESCAPE AND SURVIVE ANOTHER DAY!! ALSO I WAS AIMING FOR THE ACE AND NOT YOU NEA SORRY.
---
Yeah, that only works if the killer actually hits you. If hes smart, he'll just stand still. Even then, that just gives the killer a free hook for the person unhooking. Its bullshit, really.
---
Your clones are very impressive, you must be very proud
---
No, this is Gale and the actress who plays her in the final act. Scream 3 is a special kind of bad considering how good the other 3 are.
---
When was this?
---
I love it when I get someone last minute, and there friends try to help them. Hey, I'm sorry im camping, but I just want to secure one kill.
---
I find more killers hard patrolling, camping, and tunneling in red ranks than I do in low ranks. It's ridiculous. Like, this is how you got here, by playing like that? What fun is that?
---
I love this so much
---
Few hours ago lol
---
PLEASE hit us up with killer perks but i request NOED to be the guy that tries to hug and he pushes him off
---
Infinites: don't follow them, if they keep hugging those buildings just keep leaving them and if you catch them you're justified to facecamp :^)
---
Pallet looping: don't respect pallets, learn which pallets are safe and which aren't, break every safe pallet, only swing through it you can actually hit them, strafe the corners instead of just holding W.
---
He isn’t hard to play as it against it’s really easy to get stalks off on even good survivors and gain a lot of pressure at the start. And it’s not that hard to kick him out of his power unless he stacks the add ons that make it harder in which case it is complete bs. I think if they are going to do any kind of nerf (which they shouldn’t) it should only be to add ons and leave his base kit as it is
---
I’ve wanted to try out wraith for so long but I don’t have any perks for him at all he’s still level 1 for me
---
And I pipped anyway so it’s his loss 😎
---
When he reaches Tier 3
---
“I hate the Bedham map the education cost is too damn high and our survivors deserve a generation where they can have a decent school and blood points without losing their minds. I say we tax the killers and have them pay for our blood webs”
---
This still wouldn’t counter a face camping bubba
---
Pallets,exhaustion nerfs, pallet vacuums, more where that came from, and at the same time,most killers got buffed,nurse,billy didnt even get touched
---
Spirit is maybe the choice with most potential but it depends on your playstyle. Survivors are only skins so I would prefer to buy a killer
---
Well you did have a target on your back
---
Wraith doesn't need perks, though they help. Just stay cloaked, stay either far away, or really close, and attack from behind. Chase them in cloak if they are in a very open area, otherwise, stay in physical form. And finally, they know your watching them when you get close, but they never know where you are. Also, strike the hell once, it terrifys the survivors.
---
Tunnelling will earn you tbags
---
5-10 seconds is a bit short. There are quite many times where there is a gen to kick and a pallet to break close to a hook. This takes more than 10 seconds, but isn't camping.
---
There are also times where you know other survivors are swarming around the hook and you want to search them. Sure, you could call this camping, but it's stupid not to.
---
This system mostly fixes camping, but could also punish the killer when they don't deserve it. Just my two cents
---
Hmm ok thanks for your help
---
I dunno, I thought that was what you meant which is why I was confused haha. 
---
I get you now, makes sense. Good point.
---
Fair enough I’ll give him a go
---
Careful though, flashlights or anything that stuns (idk about pallets), will force you out of form, exposing you. Good luck.
---
It counters nurses calling but it purpose is to be used with object of obsession.
---
And what level was this, might I ask? 
---
Not saying it is really excusable at any level, but just curious.
---
If survivors are toxic, I'll camp no matter what. Only time I camp other than that is if I got no kills and the gates are open.
---
I didn't know calling someone brilliant and expressing gratitude implied sexual interest.
---
yea I do happily
---
I wish I had ghostface. He seems like Myers, but so much better.
---
Fair point. I edited the timing.
---
Yea, but it feel like red rank killers exclusively play against p3 Claudette flashlight groups, when in reality they fucking slaughter people with none or 1 gen being done, and when they get swf group who tbagged them, so they come to complain here on reddit how imbalanced game is and everyone is toxic.
---
Burnout means you’ve played too much. Not because of what you mentioned.
---
Not ma baby Dwight !

They had us in the first half, ngl
---
If you are only planing on playing one role, than no.
---
This was tested and failed a while ago
---
Rank 14-13
---
That's why I can't play doc or Myers as much as I want. I get out in with high ranking sweats 9/10
---
This is big brain time!
---
Lol I was referring to the fact that people that run it often walk damn near everywhere so they can save their cooldown for when the killer is about to chase them.  It's a very common behavior for those that run the perk.
---
You must have trapped them after the EGC
---
Looks like none of the commenters have ever played killer. If I hook two of you the beginning of the game, you bet your ass I'll be slithering around those hooks instead of YOLOing it to hunt generators.
---
I God damn hate having maroon teammates.
---
I fucking camp them. It pisses them off, gets easy kills. Yeah. Be toxic, idfc, don't be made when I'm just as toxic. Though, I am guilt of last minute camping, when I have no kills, but just hooked a guy.
---
Love when they do this haha but to be fair I have been caught out like that a few times haha
---
Wow ...playing with prey seems...toxic? I do go for healthy rescuers too (cuz longer game that way) but when none of them were full health after initial start what do? Especially if you got mobility like nurse and Billy?
---
SelfCare takes way too long to heal you with, you're better off finding a teammate or just playing with a brown medkit.
---
Sprint burst would be good if you could use it on command, but the fact that the instant you sprint it goes away makes most of it useless, also the fact that you have to walk around everywhere to save them. 
---
Urban Evasion is the best of these perks yet it's too situational and generally playing aggressive over playing stealthily will win you more games.
---
*[MORE INTENSE HEAVY BREATHING]*
---
I can't play him. It feels like the bottles don't do enough. Though it's been awhile since I've played him, so I may try it again.
---
HI CARL!
---
Dude, Feng screams like a banshee. I have to hit her again to stop her screaming.
---
If the killer is far off, or you can quickly cleanse it
---
Really? not even make an attempt to look for NOED or the possible save? SMH.... selfish play like that triggers me more than anything a killer does.
---
civ iv
---
Take a hit, use Borrowed Time
---
Ghostface is so easy to kick out of stealth now its fucking attrocious
---
No One Escapes Death. It’s a perk that activates once the hatch is closed or the exit gates are opened. Every survivor becomes Exposed (1 hit down) until they destroy the glowing totem
---
Yeah and you'll just get slugged
---
You my good sir are very helpful. I was scared I was gonna get called a noob or whatever but not anymore
---
Then you choke on bad wifi
---
I forbid you from posting that image ever again
---
Seems like your having the same problem with me
---
Or have the generators take more to start. Maybe different skillchecks, failing too much disables the generator, etc.
---
But you promise that you won't publish this on internet, right?
---
It would take 4, maybe 5 Pop variants to even come close to the things you can do with a single nendoroid of the same character and you can't even pose them.
---
It's fine even once the gates are open. It would discourage toxic taunting
---
This is the shit Myers does at tier 1 while he stalks me peacefully working on a gen
---
Yeah. I play both killer and survivor, and got about 150h in the game. I'm rank 10 killer atm, and I always check for swf before the game. If they've got each other on their friends list and above 500h each I dodge, but only in a 4 stack sfw scenario
---
Huntress is the only killer I have whos not leveled up because trash perks.
---
So a perk should be strong enough that not even running it has an massive impact on the game? I've never really gotten this argument, if the goal of NOED is just to have the games longer then make the actual mechanics longer.
---
Tree could easily have some interesting perks with that. Yeah they could find something for the tethered I’m sure
---
THE PLAG DUDE. But I'd recommend looking into montos no cleanse build. Plague basically turns into an M1 killer I people don't cleanse.
---
I love when stuff like this happens feels so good
---
The angriest I have been at survivors is when they have left me to die on the first hook. 
---
Stop teabaging on the hatch you piece of shit, there's still other survivor doing gens.
---
I just realized that this is Squidward with Meg hair and I'm fucking choking
---
Was it freddy or clown?
---
I was thinking that the entity would use its arms to block the basement unless there is a survivor down there, pair that with a cut coin and you're at least protecting a game from chests.
---
I've been looking forward to this.
---

save shards, buy good perks in the shrine when they appear
---
Just to do annoying cocky taunts. That death was very satisfying not gonna lie.
---
Hahah. A friend of mine found this on TikTok
---
No I mean you can sprint without triggering Sprint Burst.
---
And no Ed is countered by doing totems.
---
Not much is more satisfying
---
Goood goooooood. Execute order 66
---
I looked into that for a little bit, I don’t think so because she only had one hook. The exposed stat triggered with a loud boom sound effect when my buddy cleansed a totem and it never went away.
---
Definitely I had killed everyone and a guy was teabaging at the exit and I just rushed them and knocked them felt so good
---
Ladies and gentleman, justice has been served
---
:c
---
i think its more of a "insurance thing" like a clutch you know, when theres only 1 gen left and the killer is NOT hugging the remaining ones he will most likely chase someone while the other survivors do the gen - in that case the adrenalin is used by 1 survivor to its full effect.
---
cant really describe it all that good but its like a....
---
...trapcard?
---
You can't loop a spirit and she can track you by something as subtle as basic breathing noise.
---
Could it have been Rancor? Maybe you were the obsession?
---
That what she gets 4 BMing
---
Looks like a mixture of Jane and Laurie.
---

---
Thank you being serious scrolling through that ahh was trippy and made like diamonds pretty cool
---
*Meg breathing
---
Such a great movie
---
Hags mori be like
---
‘This survivor empty’
---
YEET
---
True, but the screams could be the result of panic and fear instead of pain. If I knew whats about to happen(killer carrying me to the hook) i'd probably scream **before** i'd actually get hooked.
---
Its like falling from really high building. You dont really feel any pain yet(and probably will not even after you reach the ground), but you'll be screaming on top of your lungs all the way down.
---
With the most sweaty build out there lol. Feels bad
---
it's actually just like the avenger movies - first it was to OP and defeated half of all killers. After that one Devenger decided to split things up (from regular hits to protection hits/safe unhooks which are bugged) and voilà: it's useless.
---
Funny seeing self care being carried for once
---
Usually it's the other way round
---
if a team mate has decisive(or any obsession perk idk) it gives the obsession to a random person
---
Wraith was my first character i unlocked all the unteachibles for... at least i can track really REALLY well... not like i wanted bbq or ruin or anything ;_;
---
Lol. Grow up. Tough up it’s god damn game. If the game is truly making you feel like shit, move on.
---
Yes I know with a medkit you don't need self care. But sometimes you don't want to bring a medkit or you don't have one.
---
Now I want to know why it is
---
No you can't, it eats your exhaustion
---
If you say camping is just "tolerated" by the devs so it's not legitimate, then you should say the same for the entire survivor meta right now. Looping and voice chat were never intended parts of the game from the beginning, the devs just tolerate them.
---
If the emblem system can't reward survivors who played well through no fault of their own, maybe the emblem system is what needs reworking.

*(Psst, Nea's actually the entity)*
---
That’s just his lore, he’s able to travel between realms, he doesn’t actually do it in game.
---
I've seen so much stuff like this, and the pucker is still always strong
---
Yeah you can, if you crouch and then sprint from crouching it doesn’t eat your exhaust.
---
That's an exploit.  Only scumbags cheat.  I figured that was what you were talking about lol.
---
Well, yeah, but our chances were greater before. There are definitely more hooks than before. I just started playing again after about a 3-4 month break.
---
I'm a killer main and the only time I play leatherface is for daily challenges but When it comes to letherface, he is the king of Basements. He can easily down a whole team of altruistic survivors if all clumped up together. 
---
  
---
Majority of the time tho When i play leatherface I'll soft camp Survivors to guard the gens near me as well as my kill.
---
So what you did was right but your teammates should've probably of left the hooked survivor.
---
TIP- If you know its leatherface and don't hear him anywhere near the hooked survivor be careful going into the basement they might be running insidious to hide their terror raduis.
---
TIP2- if you know his chainsaw trantum is going, run in a locker or jump a window before he hits you; or attempt to make him hit a wall as if he hits something that not a survivor he will get stuck and a swinging animation for abit similar to a stun but you will still take damage if you get hit by his stun Swing
---
Yep, I keep getting this exact combo.
---
Yeah, It wouldn't show a prompt saying hex devour hope when someone was down so I had no clue that a killer was running it until I got a big fat mori after an insta down
---
Well alright then, no need to get rude.
---
I like the way she’s stroking that axe handle.....
---
We didn’t have a gen complete when the exposed effect was given to us though. She had ruin so I was working on one because I can hit the great checks, my buddy was looking for ruin and triggered the mystery perk.
---
A lot of perks can be used as a camping build. Insidious as you mentioned, agitation and iron grasp to get them to the basement, light born to deal with flashlight saves, NOED if the gens are completed while camping, etc. Wraith and meyers excel at camping because of their low/no terror radius builds. Bubba with his chainsaw and monitor and abuse. You can stay about 10-15 meters away from the hook or basement and camp it. Thankfully, not a lot of people play those characters as camping killers but their powers were essentially made for camping. Yeah, black pipping sucks, but it sounds like it's the point system that needs to be reworked, not strategies or characters.
---
I thought it'd go unnoticed tbh.
---
That's a feature. It helps in putting that trap quickly at the same place where it was disarmed.
---
Your welcome! Glad I can be your inspiration.
---
Just want to be nice and gave u 800 BP and u spat at her face nice
---
Depends who your playing as I suppose.
---
Thanks for all the answers guys and gals. Appreciate it.  &lt;3
---
I will try him out some more, try to stalk from further away. He is definetely fun to play, but being unable to use your power when a survivor sees you makes him also feel very, very weak and powerless.
---
understandable but it's really annoying. 
---
but i also play survivor. more than killer these days cause can't be arsed to wait for so long every time. and i don't recall discussions occurring that frequent rather than survivors just not pressing ready.
---
literally now i waited exactly 6 minutes to only load in a lobby. and literally right now i'm looking at 4 men 3 of which are not ready. i could tell the matches last 6-8 minutes for me, this waiting is just a huge waste of time.
---
I must thank you for it
---
Yeah I like this idea
---

---
Guaranteed easy first hit, slows the game down, makes survivors not want to heal, better then doctor at destroying stealth because not even lockers hide you from killer instinct, 
---
I know people hate him for he’s far from seconds worse.
---
Just yesterday I forgot I was in queue because I followed a dog i thought was lost down the road
---
I thank you for your thanks
---
Beat me to it
---
DO THE DAMN OBJECTIVES! HEY YOU HAVENT SEEN THE KILLER IN A MINUTE? GET THE DAMN GENS! OH LOOK THE KILLER IS CHASING SOMEONE! DO THE DAMN GENS! OH YEAH THE KILLER PICKED SOMEONE UP AND WE HAVE 2 GENS LEFT DONT GET COCKY AND RUN BEHIND HIM TO UNHOOK! HES GONNA HOOK AND THEN HIT YOU OR THEM AND THEN REHOOK...YOU COULD HAVE BEEN GETTING US THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!!!
---
May i remind you of MoM.
---
Lmao last time I played killer I was doing a Trapper daily (rank 20 killer, I'm a survivor main) and got called a dumbass for using a padded jaws add-on but not setting traps 
---
Also got called a pussy for tunneling, which even while playing survivor I don't care cause it's strategy 
---
I think this guy was like rank 15 but like really 
---
Not even I bash rank 20-18s when they're camping or something
---
Head On 🙄 not only that you need to stay 3 seconds in a locker and the killer needs to be within range but they need to also be in the right angle 'cause otherwise they can't get stunned even if they're right in front of the locker and you get grabbed instead, like how dumb that can be?
---
The ultimate powermove : Stalking ghostface
---
I thank you for your thanks of my thanks and also agree with your point
---
Well that clears that up lol. Must be new
---
I always play against them as killer. I like to be challenged.
---
My psn is lacajalb
---
What was he supposed to do? Farm?
---
I like how even lower-tier perks that very few people run, like Spies from the Shadows or Territorial Imperative, impact the game and make survivors change their behavior.
---
But those behaviors are "try not to scare crows" or "be careful when entering the basement". The behavior they encourage should *not* be "run around the map for five minutes like a complete ninny, looking for things to vandalize".
---
We need Bernie Sanders as a survivor.
---
what macro? can you give me a link? isnt it bannable?
---
It just feels awful when you know killer is keeping an eye on the slug where my choices are basically try to do gens that killer is guranteed patrolling, try to res slug who will go down immediately and in doing so reveal that I was near, or hide like a bitch for 4 minutes and hope that you guess the right exit gate to rush because killer will certainly find and camp hatch in that time.
---
You lose BP for staying too close to survivors, but its barely anything so it doesn’t do anything.
---
It's so hard to run from glowing red object to glowing red object until you find a survivor and then run them down because you're faster. Pallets/Loops have been nerfed several times already, Learn to mind game.
---
Hag = Hillary flashbacks for Bernie?
---
I want the Zodiac killer if I'm being honest and even though it's unlikely I feel it could happen at some point as he would be legitimately terrifying to see a dude in a executioner style clothing butchering your teammates. Feel his abiliy could be carving the Zodiac sign into peoples backs and making it so they do stuff slower until they get it removed by a teammate. That or Harry Warden as he is pretty badass looking
---
It's ok, champ. You already had that power in you all along!
---
WTF did I just see
---
Hillary is a Killer(hag) it would only be fair if Bernie was a survivor paragraph
---
I call out if I am dying light by messaging others if I am able cause I play solo on ps4. That way they know why I may be tunneled if in chase and hooked.
---
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
---
I hope I can make you scream like in this post one day ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Honestly I get much more use out of empathy. You can very clearly see if your teammates is being chased from an incredible distance away and also maneuver properly if they are heading towards you on top of being able to scout people to heal.
---
Do gens and leave.
---
Just. F*cking. Leave...
---
Every match as killer I go against survive with friends. Most of which are a higher rank with a low rank friend to abuse the system. Although sometimes it's just very skilled survivors who know what they're doing and can often be a lot of fun to play against but stressful.
---
Whenever I'm Survivor. It puts me with rank 20 noobs who are playing their first game ever against a killer of my rank. Or it puts me on a team of incompetent overly altruistic idiots who will spend the whole Max looking for ruin or waiting for me to die on the hatch and complaining if I leave them instead
---
Where did you find the original image i wanna make a meme of it
---
I mean it's a valid strategy if the killer wants to throw the match away. Any competent group of survivors sees that the Killer is camping and does all of the gens so only one person dies. Camping and tunneling are valid strategies just like body blocking or pallet looping. There wouldn't be perks for it and perks to counter if they weren't intended features. (Insidious, Ds, Kindered, MoM etc.)
---
People can play the game how they want or however they find effective. Getting Camp is no fun but going against survive with friends is no fun. You win some you lose some. It's all part of the game
---
I use alert in my set. This video was too funny!!
---
this makes me remember of a fool teabagging me at the exit gates,he totally forgot I had noed,needless to say that he got hooked because being good is one thing and being cocky because your temmates carried you is another thing
---
( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)
---
Slugging is kind of counter-intuitive (assuming OP is telling the truth right now. You get less BP and you have a lower chance of pipping (*especially* in red ranks). It would have made more sense on a fun (BP) sense and a competitive (higher pip chance) to not slug and play normally.
---
Of course OP and his team could have just played like idiots and intentionally made it easy or even necessary to slug. (Bodyblocking, taking hits, etc.)
---
I don’t run small game because i’ll eventually get chased and end up having to hear the notification for 10 straight minutes while i loop pallets. Plus i always die before NOED gets popped due to camping cause of said looping.
---
It's not fair, but it's the only crutch perk killers have, but survivors have so many second chances and crutch perks that NOeD seems fair
---
Adrenaline is huge. Getting to end game, having one on hook, one on a gen, and one injured currently in chase means that first the guy on the gen knows he doesn't have to heal because as soon as he pops the gen he's good. Pops the gen, gets healed, goes and saves the guy off of the hook who is also instantly healed once his feet hit the ground. All the while the guy that you were 3 seconds away from downing and killing just got not only healed but got a 5 second sprint burst making it to another loop/shack/jungle gym. Adrenaline is a massive game changer.
---
xXRenXx1234
---
Hex: Ruin. Everytime I run it the totem spawns in the most obvious place (aside from one game where it spawned in the hidey hole). No Mither because if you run it you’ll never get slugged
---
When was the last time you played dbd? e-e
---
My take on No Mither is that you should start off healthy but once you get injured you can never go back to healthy. Once injured all action speeds get increased SLIGHTLY.
---
I found out what it was, but yesterday
---
Happy cake day Baby Jake
---
Do people really believe this?
---
Well when you literally throw the whole game to get 1 kill on a survivor that made you salty, they basically accomplished what they set out to do.
---
I think that's a bug. If not, it's very rare, as I have yet to encounter it.
---
I'm spending blood points,  don't tell me how to live my life.
---
It activates once the exit gates are powered, so when generators are done or hatch closed. The gates do not have to be open!
---
And imagine DS and borrowed time punishing killers for doing their objective. Tuneling=gen rushing
---
Look at Monto on youtube. He uses some funny/troll killer builds.
---
Okay. I love it but FUCK no. Please don't take offense to any of this. She's always freaked me out from a young age. If this were to happen, I'd never play DBD again. Again, no offense, just a childhood fear.
---
Would probably not be any different since they're both hex perks
---
lol I find this to be one of the most entitled things I have read on here. Asking for someone to be fired, which could ruin their whole livelihood, because some maps aren't how you would want them.
---
Like others have pointed out you don't know the circumstances and its highly unlikely he is the sole person to design a map from the ground up. Out of interest do you design games yourself? If not how can you know how easy or difficult his job is? 
---
At least they are making changes to the maps and editing them with the aim to improve and frankly how do we not know it could be a lack of skill on your part as others seem ok with maps you have disliked.
---
I'll gladly sack bps for survivors not getting punished for winning too well and a killer getting an undeserved win because of one perk.
---
I'll gladly sack bps for survivors not getting punished for winning too well and a killer getting an undeserved win because of one perk
---
They only appear while running and last 7 seconds, but since the only requirement is running, all it takes is a short little walk or crouch and the trail can stop and confuse a killer. Don't take the scratches as a guarentee.
---
Fact
---
i asked politely, not told you what to do with your life. 
---
just don't be surprised i'll camp and tunnel you after cause i'm so tired of waiting
---
Depends on which killer it is and what killer level they are. Low level nurses and hags have it hard
---
Tiers\*
---
Michael\*
---
Which\*
---
How the fuck fo you believe he didn't mean to give gatch...
---
If spending one extra minute in a lobby is enough to trigger you, I have a feeling you camp and tunnel anyway tbh.
---
this is so sexy
---
I mean, you’re saying exactly what I was talking abut. It sounds like you consider merely kills your criteria for a win and a killers ability to obtain kills the way to decide whether they are good or not, when a section of my post discussed the ways in which some killers were designed to do different things.  You also mentioned how some killers can only do things with the right builds, which is also something I stated. The point of perks is to adjust the kit to fit your playstyle to help you do what you want to do. All killers are not designed equally. All killers will not do the exact thing you want to do equally, without some work. Some killers demand you to think about how you play and how to strategize, and some don’t. 
---
By rating a killers skill and a “win” as only the amount of kills you get, you’re not only judging several characters poorly, but you’re also ignoring many other aspects of killer gameplay that, if you’re playing optimally, reward you far more than a mere kill. For instance, I see many killers who refuse to allow unhooks- in a way, you shoot yourself in the foot when you do this. You are stopping yourself from gaining more points. If you hook someone 1 time you get points for that 1 hook, 1 stage of entity sacrifice, and 1 sacrifice. However, if you hook someone 3 times, you get points for 3 hooks, 1 stage of entity sacrifice, and 1 sacrifice, and thusly, you get far more points (and that’s not factoring in how many points you’d get for a chase/hit/using your ability). Additionally, as I have mentioned before, a kill only counts for points as a part of 1 category (hooks making up a large part of that category), and then you still have three other categories to fulfill. If you get a 4K with 4 hooks but didn’t stop any gens because you spent your time at the hook preventing a kill, does that mean you did well? In my opinion, no. Is a killer that can do that better than a killer that can gain lots of points, extend the life of a game, and get 2 kills? No, absolutely not. In my opinion, the killer that can extend the game and accrue more points is more impressive. Do I think a killer sucks and “lost” if they got no kills at all yet received 27k BP? Fuck no, they still beat the hell out of us and got more bloodpoints than we did. 
---
My point is that when you’re judging every killer the same way, despite their abilities being vastly different and intended to do different things, you’re severely misrepresenting them. The killers were designed to play differently, to fit people’s play styles. Clown was designed to dominate chases, and he does so very effectively. If played correctly, the Clown’s ability to pressure survivors, end chases, and apply a lot of hook pressure compensated for his lack of mobility. The Legion was designed to spread attacks and chain chases, and while it is situational, there are ways in which this ability is useful for prolonging the game. Again, perks are necessary to adjust the kit, but an effective legion applying deep wounds left and right slows down the game a massive amount, since people have to get off gens to mend (and many survivors prefer to heal and be at full health, further wasting time not on gens). Many people consider freddy to be bad to play, since he requires more planning, thinking, and demand to play; he cannot be played the same way the other killers can be played, just like survivors cannot play against him the same way. Freddy is great for slowing down the game, and an effective freddy sleeping everyone and keeping them asleep will cause the game to snowball; survivors will be slowed or try to wake themselves up, but if all survivors are asleep, they are forced to miss a skillcheck (if on a gen, this further reduces progress) but this also shows you where they are (If they weren’t in your radius). Furthermore, I see many people play freddy like your traditional M1 killer, where they sleep and chase, and this causes them to absolutely be at a disadvantage. Freddy is almost always guaranteed a first hit after someone is put asleep, but many times the boost from a hit will give the survivor enough leeway to get to a safe area; freddy isn’t forced to continue that chase. He has already won it. Once outside his terror radius, he can see the survivors; additionally, they’ll most likely try to fail a skillcheck immediately, but either way, you can go and sleep/hit someone else while that other person stays off gens, and this snowballs to multiple survivors. 
---
Using the argument that a certain killer is more difficult to play against well-coordinated survivors is kind of a non argument, too, since most killers suffer similarly against SWF. Survivors having strong communication always gives them advantage, regardless who the killer is. Just because they know the killer is playing a stealth killer doesn’t mean they can completely eviscerate your ability, nor does it mean they always know exactly where you’re at. It is absolutely possible to play a stealth killer well against a team with communication, it just requires a bit more work.
---
Nature of the game. Its 4 vs 1 so survivors have a kind of pack mentality and it can cause them to get salty or toxic. Killers can become bitter as they are alone and it can feel like the worlds against you when your taking on an organised team so it can cause satly or toxic behaviour.   
---
Best thing is to ignore them either the people saying stuff are childish, overly emotional at that point or just dicks and not worth your time. 
---
Welcome to the fog btw.
---
The survivors head fucking explodes
---
I use both personally.
---
Temple of Purgation is huge and has tons of safe loops and a large central building, I definitely wouldn’t call it good for most killers.
---
Those survivor ranks average out at 16.75. I'd say getting a rank 15 killer is pretty good matchmaking.
---
Its normal if you don’t think its great. Thing is every artist starts their post of with “I know its bad” or “I know its not that good” or some other form of the sentence. It gets annoying, like I said. 
---
Whether its rude or not, I don’t care. Dont be so sensitive. Your art is good. It was the title I had a problem with
---
Sir mister dr bing bong Reginald Oppenheimer the third
---
Actually the hook progression slow and stop (after too many seconds) would be probably THE BEST solution, but not the third one.
---
Have to agree to disagree at this point cause I'm thinking of all the big ass maps right now thinking 32 meters ain't shit.
---
Jep , never understood why it is never nerfed. Just remove the speed buff and add totem counter.
---
Stiil breaks the rules
---
&gt;oddly specific scenario that has nothing to do with anything to justify camping
---
yup, keep it coming. this subreddit never ceases to amaze me with the stupid shit people say.
---
He won’t hit you tho, he’s body blocking so nobody can get through
---
Im gon take a wild guess and say thats because you're preventing them from playing the game when you do that
---
She can be strong but it's really fucking boring. All she does is M1 after 10 seconds of a match.
---
I've never had this problem
---
Plot twist: The video is cut short because she had ds
---
Wait, really? Damn, how long does it take you to load in?
---
It's only because the game is bugged as shit so the perk will effectively never proc.
---
EVERY TIME I PLAY ACE DOES MY TEAM EXPECT ME TO JUMP OUT OF THE HOOK? SERIOUSLY YALL LOOK LIKE MYSTERY INC SNEAKING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP AFTER I JUST GET HOOK. IF YOU KNOW ALL THREE OF YOU ARE TOGETHER SPLIT UP AND SAVE ME.
---
ALSO KEEP TRACK OF WHO GOT HOOKED BECAUSE IF I WAS IN STRUGGLE STATE RUNNING FROM THE KILLER THAT MEANS NEXT TIME I DIE. DO ME A FAVOR AND TAKE A HIT.
---
What a surprise, its a ghostface.
---
They have a lot of other things that they should he working on, instead of just creating more bugs.
---
Can someone explain what exactly is going to change? How will camping reduce Bloodpoints? Was it said in a developer stream?
---
you’d be a fun person to play with. Whatever dude
---
Hopefully not at the same time.
---
OINK
---
They seem cool, but are they color-coded ? I mean, are rarities consistently colored ? The pack looks slick, but I don't really want to use random colors :P
---
This image is hilarious
---
Nobody cares about your stream
---
Sometimes the ready button goes grey and they can't ready up. I have it happen pretty frequently.
---
It's a luck thing now I guess, sometimes it takes awhile to find the hatch. At least the killer will be searching for it, and ignoring gens
---
Easier communication. dont need to say whos going for the save. You can just see
---
Michel Tires. New survivor confirmed.
---
They can't currently, because as soon as the killer disconnects, the game disbanded because the killer is the host, or the server the survivors are playing on. They could do this once they have dedicated servers but it seems like a waste of time, especially with all the new stuff they are working on like their story driven progression system kinda like a battle pass thing :p
---
He has to be *kidding* right?
---
Without a doubt, self care is one of the perks I hate my teammates using the most if I'm playing solo surv
---
I'm not sure that I've ever actually gotten Devour Hope to work properly. Unless you get really lucky with the totem placement, the most you're probably ever going to get is the slight speed boost from hooking survivors. Ruin is inconsistent, but it's also designed to be strong early game. Devour Hope is a late game focused perk that will hardly ever get to late game.
---
All killers sweet dream.
---
Was she tbagging?
---
When killer gets entity displeased there should be an animation of the entity killing them lol will be funny seeing campers die
---
Use Franklin's boiii. Believe it or not it slows the game down almost as much as ruin. Survivors looove their items so they usually go back to look for them, some even have the balls to try and pick it back up mid chase. If I see 3 items or more, I'll swap sloppy butcher for Franklin's for a similar effect. I usually run bbq, nurses, sloppy and ruin on Ghost Face. It's quite an underrated perk that counters all items :)
---
But, you don’t get many points for this thou?
---
WGLF? I could understand MOM or balanced but WGLF? That's toxic? oh shit
---
Same I'm a P3 Claudette and everyone I play with is like 'uhh a Claudette main" when during my games I do everything I can to save them and they still die and blame me when I saved them alot with a flashlight, took TONS of hits, saved them from hook at the safest time, and took the killer off them at least 10 times, I also bring borrowed time, empathy, self care, and urban evasion and I barely ever die but they die every game with 4 perks to save themself and as I mentioned before I do litterally everything possible to save them. Sorry for going on such a long rant just really mad
---
This is true
---
No, I just had to mori her for the daily ritual. I only had the offering where you can mori the last survivor. She was a pretty cool survivor and very understanding at the end. No toxicity.
---
I'm not feeling this, this meme is for sarcastic or pretend happiness, in your scenario the nurse would be feeling actual Joy :)
---
God damn those DC’rs
---
Yep, in fact the girl in the meme is giggling🤔
---
Haha this happens a lot
---
There are times when I physically can't ready up. It's greyed out and I can't do anything about it.
---
Sorry for the late answer.
---
Personally i haven't found Frank's Mixtape that useful, i find it to be faster to just tag as many as possible with frenzy then just regular M1 attacks to down.
---
I mean can the Ruler Mixtape combo work out nicely? In theory yes, just not how i like playing my Legion.
---
I mean, you *can* get 4ks on any map while playing a no-blink nurse. That doesn't mean it's fun to do or that the maps are balanced. Map balance is definitely something that needs to be looked at, but firing one dude isn't going to do anything.
---
Happened to me. Can confirm I was triggered. I just ended up leaving the party without uttering a word.
---
I like to use Franklin's too :D
---
I heard that if you use that splinter while chosing Myers then there's 2% chance that you spawn as 2018 "weathered Myers" from the new film. :)
---
(please put that skin in the game BHVR...)
---
I like to imagine this meme as instead the one where the guy follows someone and then he gets stopped, with the guy stopping him being insidious leatherface

All perks after 50lvl should be 3lvl
---
Thx.     Looking forward to playing with you someday :)
---
I do not kmow what you are talking about... it never happens to me...
---
If they add taunts to the game, they need to add this.
---
Despite what reddit tells you, Freddy is god awful. Without a doubt the worst killer. He shits on new players because they don’t know how to counter him. He has no map pressure, no chase potential, can’t interact with survivors until he pulls them into the dream world, which takes around 7 seconds depending on the addons, way too easy to leave the dream world. All this makes him the worst killer at high ranks. People on here like to defend him and say that he’s actually godly and that nobody knows how to play him, which fair enough, but even at his best he’s lower D tier. 
---
That’s not to say he has *nothing* going for him. He has somewhat decent stall if the survivors decide to stay in the dream world, but they never will. He has decent tracking if the survivors are in the dream world, being able to see every survivors auras outside his TR, but again that’s only in the dream world. He has godly stealth. However, these strengths don’t help at rank one. No map pressure means he can’t stop gens from being done without the help of perks, which at that point why not play someone like the Nurse? You can technically play all killers at rank 1, but the bottom 3 are the most difficult to play at rank 1.
---
There is. Most survivor just suicide so they can move on to the other match. If you stay on the hook, you're effecrively keeping the killer occupied, you staying while being camped has the same effect as keeping the killer in a 2 minute chase
---
I used to play as Hag with Franklin's. Placed a trap on their items and more often then not they'd run back to their item and trigger the trap. Often giving me a free down because they chose the item over healing.
---
If you can play any m1 killer well, you can play freddy well. Freddy is literally the simplest killer there is so stop acting like every killer in the game has this insane ammount of depth to them. You obviously dont think when you play killer or idk
---
Wierd, usually im stuck in the little spinning phase at the start of the game where it says the map name for like 15-20 seconds longer than other players
---
Assuming ur not running the tragic perk, left behind, this achievement is hard as balls to get now, 
---
You're gonna have to set it up in a way that, the killer obviously has killed the other 3 members, you only have 1 gen left and its on like 80% and the doors have spawned far apart
---
I haven't been able to download it either :(
---
I am thinking that maybe the code they sent was for example only and they will be sending the 'real' one before the test starts. But that's just a guess. Could be it's messed up again.
---
Don’t this is too real
---
Didn't Mettle got nerfed?
---
Not really hard you need find hatch and watch you friends die and escape through he hatch .
---
DCing should give you like 1500 points a pop and not just 825. Or maybe 825 for the first one but obvious chain DCing gives you even more points since this kind of just ruins it to be honest
---
"Survivors scream when hooked.  More at 11."
---
Loooooool
---
Bro "wins" aren't anything if you didn't get enough Bp to pip
---
But I gotta BM!
---
This post is underrated
---
THANK YOU AND AT LEAST YOU ARENT SCUMMY SWF JUST DONT BE TOXIC LOSERS I RESPECT YOU FOR NOT FALLING DOWN TO THE TOXIC LEVEL AND BEING NICE
---
Finally a survivor dlc I can commit to getting prestige 3 on
---
Really wish they'd implement a timer if you dc. It would instantly make the game better. Probably won't happen until they have dedicated servers, though.
---
Funny enough, you probably lost Rank Progress from that game -.-
---
The game should notice if things arent correct and wont let you start the game, instead you should get an error message, a warning message or something similar.
---
At the same time the system can notice things that have been changed deliberatly
---
Idk if you play console, but I have this happen a *lot* on ps4
---
you know I had to do it to em
---
9/10 matches I played yesterday it wouldn’t let me ready up so there’s that 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Ohh, is it the same for perks ? If yes than im definetly grabbing this pack ^_^
---
Dad jokes are relegated to r/DadBydaylight
---
In general, I think they should actually drop the penalty the killer gets and instead give the survivor a reward when they get camped. They are keeping the killer busy after all. The reason I think this is a better solution is because these reasons:
---
-killers who camp usually already don't care about the rewards they get from the match, they just care about their kill count. So penalising them won't change their behaviour.
---
-camping is, simply put, your best option in certain circumstances.
---
-killers who camp purely to punish a survivor might actually think twice about camping, knowinfg that the survivor will get rewarded.
---
-it might reduce the biggest problem that currently comes with camping: survivors suiciding. Many survivors just don't want to bother waiting around when they get camped, so they just suicide to move on to their next match. This in turn rewards the killer for camping encouraging to camp more. When survivors get rewarded for being camped, they might stick around, allow their teammates to pop some gens and giving camping killers a loss.
---
Because all of red rank killers are playing like assholes right now, as evidenced by the game I just shared with you. Literally fighting tooth and nail for all survivor points.
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Well, The Clown has self-taught knowledge in anesthetic's, and some chemistry. (Look at his addons and backstory.) So The Clown does have a decent level of intelligence, but most likely nowhere near The Doctor.
---
Hell its better than anything I could draw
---
They weren’t good, the game snowballed because my teammates were idiots.
---
I get this all the Time as Trapper. When a Survivor runs into a trap and I down them or pick them up directly this shadow often remains there.

But but what about incidious buba
---
If the trap is active they still have to remove it. If not then the survivors are fine.
---
-hide chat and leave game as soon as it ends.
---
-tunnel/camp tea baggers 
---
-dc teabagging/flashlight clicking swf groups or go into a corner (so they cant get chase/blind points tab out and watch youtube.
---
Or die trying!
---
Thanks man :)
---
I'll play swf with her.
---
Ppl really by like that.. if you setup traps instead of leaving immediately it makes you a camper xD
---
This would have nothing to do with terror radius. Only actual distance from the hook.
---
Imagine voting for a noed nerf or pre-nerf MoM. I bet they'd take MoM cuz they cant live without their precious noed
---
How so? I'm right. When escape is powered you should just fuckin leave, no need to stay behind and grind anymore, anyone up on hook during endgame collapse should be left behind anyway, why give the killer more chances to get the 4k? And if he does you bully him in chat. Fuck off with that rank 15 cope, its the truth.
---
I'll do it for free.
---
Have you not played since the winter event? lmao im quite sure that's what that is
---
Ok but what happens if you use it ? Meyersception xD
---
Can you link that pls?
---
Why is Hag so low? ;\_: She's the most strategic killers of all!
---
They already do lmao 
---
Reduces points in chaser, stay near hooks a lil bit with a friend and check your medals, you get a -%
---
Whenever I get teamed up with a Laurie they always seem to be the most skilled/altruistic teammate.
---
No ma‘m
---
Yep. I personally just use his ability to sneak up and stab survivors instead of stalking but I do stalk survivors if they are just completely unaware.
---

It works only on Iceland rn.

---
i absolutely love this, but will you do a killer power one too?
---
YES
---
You could just say “actors playing actors”.
---
Hi lil cutie!!
---
I have a better request. If your ping is shit, leave a lobby and search for better one. Waiting 10+ minutes for a lobby just to get a DC mid-loading isn't fun at all.
---
*breathes in....* Boi
---
Bring a key and you can get the achievement relatively easily so long as the killer doesn't tunnel you.
---
Your perks ain't shitty
---
I'm straight, but 600 points are 600 points...
---
yuuup. Same q.q
---
Well dang it. There goes my theory lol.
---
I can't believe you've done this
---
I usually stay to let the killer get 1-2 swings off before the game ends, But not in a manner like this.
---
More of a torture technician than a doctor, really.
---
Understanding neuroscience and psychology doesn't automatically make you better at puzzle solving. Considering Amanda helped Jigsaw create multiple puzzles, it's probable that she at least has decent insight into how they work
---
Clearly it is they’re fault for being too altruistic and they can’t say you’re a camper cause they didn’t even give you a chance to leave
---
Actually it moved recently a little bit :D Don;t know if anyone of you noticed but recently the circus layout changed. Now the car is closer to the Chapel than it used to be before or they just made those tiles more RNG-dependant
---
Lower mid tier, against solo survivors he dominates, you can abuse line of site, just stalk whilst bobbing up and down, against coordinated teams, he gets destroyed one loops one breaks his shroud, you’ll rarely even get to activate his power,
---
just keep on waitin.
---
I can’t draw for shit, but to critique I would say he has a long ass neck, other then that amazing job.
---
I keep taking Autohaven, I hate this theme so much now...
---
Ok, so 8% isn't that big a deal? Then reduce the CD on his ability by 5-10 secs. It's not that big of a deal and that would be less punishing for GF getting broken out of stealth by people he can't even see him, especially when they can do it behind a rock while their face is attached to said rock.
---
is small game ever a good perk? i feel like map knowledge and having eyes kinda achieves the same thing
---
The loops around the dropped pillars near the building are ridiculously safe since they’re fairly long and the killer is clearly visible at all times, and there are some good jungle gyms that spawn on that map. While there are some laughably unsafe pallets within the building, there are conversely some good safe ones that spawn in the doorways. The building has multiple windows/vaults and high drops inside, which is perfect for Lithe and BL users. If the survivors do the gen inside the building first (which they should if they know what they’re doing), they can run the killer in/around it for a long time while everyone else does gens on the outskirts of the map. 
---
There’s also the fact that out of the 26 other maps in the game, only three are bigger than Temple. Big maps are bad for everyone who isn’t Nurse, Billy or Spirit.
---
I did this last week and the guy had the audacity in the end game chat to say 'I tried to be nice and let you have a free hit and you hooked me'. He was so mad hahaha
---
I would love them to do new mori, the Wraith and the trap and the same thing, they need unique ones.
---
Agree, i do
---
You cared enough to downvote and reply LOL
---
Probably one of the worst killers in the game.
---
I was half expecting the killer to pick her up when she was super close.
---
Honestly that description is not telling of a "sweaty" killer. This is just really dumb play by your teammates.
---
Now that you mention it I do kinda see the neck issue, it’s just that’s why I made the shoulders bigger. But yeah I do see what you mean
---
Wtf? Do you have any intelligence whatsoever or anything to back up your claim? You can't just blatantly deny me and not provide anything to back yourself up.
---
Sure, I've done more for less.
---
It depends on category, Nea appears like a good chaser for some reason.
---
Ha, I'm subscribed to r/hearthstone so I saw both your posts together and was quite confused for a second.

Ugh, YES. Fuck that Claudette
---
r/unexpecteddarkestdungeon
---
Yeah basically
---
This, I was gone joke and say that this was fake because she didn’t DC... then everyone else did.
---
Was he crouching at times when looping a pallet? If so, then he’s recharging it, therefore can activate it after.
---
never heard of crouch running, but did she get Sprint Burst after being Hit?
---
Happens every Time.
---
ye
---
Everyone can hold m1.
---
yuh
---
That's a graphic bug, the bloodweb looks like that during the winter events, some bug must have caused it to show up in your bloodweb
---
Mall
---
While the thought is appreciated, it's typically better to just leave - the measly points don't make up for the extra time it takes when you could both be getting fresh matches
---
Insidious nurse?? Lol
---
Just don't be tunelled loooool 4HEad
---
Sadly there’s nothing that can be done, it’s taking so long because many, many people are playing killer at the moment because a new killer was recently released.
---
No.
---
This game is already too RNG reliable
---
 Yes, tomorrow :3
---
So they made leatherface ULTIMATE CAMPER and now they nerf it for no reason i think its Time to rework bubba then
---
Nea : \*Instantly uses DC\*
---
Nea : \*teabags\*
---
Me :  \*wants to kill myself\*
---
Usually thats how my games end
---
What would we do without the leader? Thanks for showing us, Dwight
---
r/suicidebywords
---
no he was running then when i would get close he would have a sprint burst
---
I hate these Claudette’s. I was p3 Claudette but changed to nea because they ruined it for the good ones.
---
Small game should be reverse. 8 - 10- 12 meters since level 1 you can find stuff way easier than level 3
---
He watches it as it scares him
---
no everytime i got close he would get a sprint effect
---
For me bill is the least skilled bc he doesnt exist on my platform, ive seen some prettt boss ace's though
---
That's why I let the survivors unhook each other. I would have just picked the second guy up and gave them the free unhook. Especially if I'm using good add ons or a bloodpoint offering.
---
1. if you need to heal more than once a game you're probably doing something wrong.
---
2. the time spent healing yourself with self care could be used towards fixing generators and getting adrenaline anyways.
---
3. if you find a teammate on a gen it's best to let them heal you for double the speed and still be able to complete the gen.
---
Everything
---
Really says something about how the ranking system is designed that an absolute stomp game like this will lose you a rank but a close game where you only just eek out a victory will get you 2 pips.
---
I was thinking the inside of a mansion like RE, but that'd probably not be open enough to work.
---
&lt;3
---
Make sure you play both the tutorials. You get a ton of bloodpoints (experience) for doing them.

Or a teammate does and you get hit because of it. If you're not SWFing then this is very common.

&gt; if you find a teammate on a gen it's best to let them heal you for double the speed and still be able to complete the gen

Hence why I'm not going to advocate self care when you're standing next to a teammate. Doesn't always happen though.

Yep. They are in the help section at the top. Give 30k bloodpoints each
---
1, Nurse, she completely breaks the game and ignores the rules of engagement that every other killer has to deal with, 
---
2,Sprit, for people with good ears she’s nigh uncounterable, insane map pressure and destroys looping
---
3,Hillbilly, extremely easy to play as, but hard to play against, very good map pressure but suffers from looping,
---
4, Hag, her power slows the game down even when she isn’t around, people have to crouch to unhook then crouch after the unhook other wise she’s there with you, completely shuts down any and every loop, continue to run the same loop and you’ll hit the trap it took her a second to draw mid chase, would be better then Billy but she’s very slow and isn’t super easy to play as.
---
New map, the pallet factory
---
Wow ppl still do this? That was so last year.
---
Surprised you’re the only one that’s said this lol Laurie is deafening
---
This would be a great idea
---
Aces on ps4 are super good.But I hardly play killer on ps4 because of framerates.
---
Or is it merely a trick of the light?
---
Good luck. Start with meg get adrenaline and sprint burst perks. Watch youtube or twitch to get an idea of the game.
---
Master PC race
---
F13 isn't bad, but the devs have ceased all future content drops for the game, so it's gonna get stale really fast.
---
I was a rank 16 killer yesterday it was taking at least 5 minutes or more to find lobbies. Now survivor it takes like 30 seconds.
---
You sure they didnt have deadhard instead of sprint burst?
---
kieran and hayley myers tease

Way more focus than usual.

I am sorry that people are whining about it.  My comment on Adrenaline was meant for a joke.  
---
I play a good amount of Killer.  for the Perks to be Black people, I saw 9.  If I could edit like you could, I would put in Ruin, BBQ &amp; Chili, Devour Hope, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Save the Best for Last, Corrupt Intervention, Make your Choice, then NOED for the last one where DS was in.
---
no was sprint burst I couldnt even injure him till he threw a pallet and tried to vault it
---
Plenty of times where camping is a valid action, I hope this isn't a slippery slope towards punishing killers for playing effectively yet again
---
If they are going to punish valid plays then I hope we see BP losses for looping aswell
---
*GIVE ME THE BEANS*
---
I just woke up but I'm gonna have trouble sleeping tonight after looking at that image
---
he said he did it by crouch walking the run and it holds the charge for you
---
no it punished killers for playing how they should
---
Awesome catch, but wow I forgot how bad that Mori is.
---
Yep, this is a very clear survivor thread
---
They sure love Enduring and Calm Spirit.
---
Run
---
That sounds a lot like dead hard, you can injure through sprintburst.
---
He may have been messing with you.
---
Pretty balanced.
---
Sleeping on Pharmacy?!
---
LOL, this was hilarious. I loved the little boop for Botany.
---
There is a "trick" with Sprint burst where you let the cooldown run down to the very last meter and save it until you wanna use it. Idk if that was the case, but
---
"bUt ThE hEaRtBeAt iS aT 19 dEcIbElS"
---
He didn't do anything but chainsaw 4 people... no chasing no gen smacking, pallet destroying. Theres more to the game than just killing if you wanna pip. You gotta put in work. They handed him that match. He should've just hooked the dwight let them save then gone right back after them. You gotta make the game last longer than a minute..
---
it's okay to lose a lot at the beggining, be prepared to die quickly or not get any kills as killer
---
Just try to learn something from every match
---
good luck
---
Code worked for me. Had to restart steam to get the PTB to show up in the drop down.
---
Suck a smol dick
---
Exactly! If you wanna get the most out of the match you gotta put in work.  I always let them save more points for me. When I down them again..
---
what's this a reference to?
---
I've had that happen before, worst part is you can get hit by the killer on the parts sticking out of the locker.
---
mind game this you fucking casual
---
&gt; camping [...] viable
---
Nope. Not vs a competent team. Even tunneling vs good survivors is a bad idea, you're only pressuring one survivor/hook.
---
All of these sound like cool maps. So yes, please.
---
Ok ok I WAS a little nit picky about this but I’ve never really seen how bad the ranking can be so cut me some slack
---
This is why I never go out of my way to save a Claudette
---
I want Pyramid Head as a Killer, Heather as a Survivor and that creepy theme parc from Silent Hill 3.
---
In hindsight, I probably should have done that.
---
But my game before was a bit harder, so I guess I was still in try hard mode. Lol.
---
Okay. This is actually the most survivor sided comment I've ever seen. It wasn't about being daring, it was about getting hit and since you got hit 3 times you get a free hit for free. How is that daring? I'd say it's more daring now even though it's trash now. At least now you're doing something to get the free hit. Your explanation is hilarious.
---
Every killer is viable to get rank 1 so...
---
That happens to me too sometimes where i hear billys chainsaw and im still in that camera spinning phase
---
Of course, all of them can get rank 1
---
Agreed. It's that high risk-high reward kinda playstyle that you get from using his perks I think.
---
Nah, was PC like 2 years ago :P It was just such an asshole move that it's stuck with me lmao.
---
Very true
---
Well he does wear a mechanics outfit so I imagine he's pretty good with getting tires back on
---
Oof
---
im in too!
---
Billy is the second hardest killer to  master after huntress. How can you say he is "extremely easy to play"? Are you saying against rank 20s, then sure,  he is easy. But against actual decent survivors,  then no.
---
Also survivors complain 10 times more. I have yet to have a killer bitch at me. Even if killers complained more, there are 4 to 1 survivors to killers so it wouldn't matter.
---
Can confirm. Sorry OP, looks to be fatal.
---
They are very hard to come by as Survivor which explains why survivors don't use them but for Killers they may want to collect them in their inventory and have them as a collectable(like me) or they just dont have any
---
THAT SEEMS LIKE A REALLY GOOD OPTION TBH.
---
Yeah, this was 2 fucking years ago and it's stuck with me lmao. I'm not really still mad, but I still wonder why the hell they'd do that, it was a brown toolbox ffs :P
---
as a killer main,  i dont give a shit what people think of what perks i use.  survivors have a shitton of perks that aid them in every way possible.  why cant i run one of the best perks on my killer?  granted i literally have it on 1 killer at the moment, but i hate the notion that i shouldnt use something cause the other side is telling me not to. 
---
dont get me wrong, i dont advocate "toxic" killer gameplay, i dont camp, i dont tunnel.  but i'll be damned if someone tells me i cant use a perk i unlocked
---
Pretty sure full metal jacket
---
Buy cosmetics with them!!
---
The I feel sorry for you, he’s beyond easy to play as, catch a survivor out of position, at all and it’s an easy down, honestly feels like legal cheating sometimes, at least nurse has to aim.
---
have no idea how ill get 15 killer matches done in the allotted time
---
I’m not complaining that they are not using cakes.
---
I’m complaining that they are not using any offerings at all ....
---
A well deserved kill lmao I get so triggered when it’s one survivor left and they pull all that shit and message me ‘noob’ post-game. Clearly I wasn’t a noob you just gen jockeyed all game and then boosted.
---
GIVE ME FREDDY.
---
I MISS THE DAYS DUDES WOULD GO "HUH A QUENTIN? IN MY LOBBY? BETTER MURDER HIM WITH SHARP HANDS JOE"
---
I'M TIRED OF GHOSTFACE I WANT MR SANDMAN BACK.
---
I don't know how she works I tried her and she felt useless because you can't see anything in spirit form
---
Yeah it normall isnt too bad unless i spawn on a hill or right next to the killer
---
well my worst fear is the dentist office so that might be interesting to play in
---
one i would like to see is like an abandoned amusement park or a gross waterpark.... the crotus penn asylum carnival thing doesnt do it for me.
---
All the rank 8-1 I found always camp :S
---
Poor Lisa.
---
Give me a challenge!
---
- ME, right before my streak is broken by a talented group of survivors
---
It was a running killer, but that went horribly.  Maybe a demon or a killer that is legitimately scary, something to haunt my nightmares.  Maybe skinwalkers or wendigos.  Maybe even scps.
---
Dead Hard, Deliverence, Decisive Strike and Self-care. One of my favourite builds~ Spine Chill is S rank perk too btw.
---
wait, there's a 4? I only ever heard of 1,2,3
---
A setting from scream, to go with ghost face.
---
You need Jesus
---
The Hag still does this to me after all these years, it’s like hmmm who’s the killer then AHHHHH as she just pops up.
---
Big brain
---
Ye he punishes bad play like being out of position.  But good survivors usually will never go out to a dead zone vs a billy.  I'd love to see you play billy vs decent ppl and get then inside the loops w/o m1.
---
All he has to do is slap on enduring fury and he’s fine, which is why 90% of Billy’s run it, like most people when there where only three killers I played Billy exclusively,
---
Ace, Ps4 Ace is usually always good
---
It's because nobody likes you. People see your name and go "oh, it's that asshole, let's remove our offerings, he's gonna cry about it on reddit, it's gonna be funny". It works, can't blame them.
---
I would like to see a few maps:
---
- A graveyard (like common classic for every horrorgame)
---
- catacombs (how about a really dark inside map prob simiular to the game)
---
-A big church ( another inside map or prob as a big main building on a graveyard map.)
---
- a abandoned village. (Just a map with a few lost buildings)
---
- a grotto ( another inside map. A dark cave with stalagmites and stuff instead of trees and grass only rocks to hide behind. No wodden walls or anything a more natural looking map. And wats really missing in my opinion is water. I would love to see some waterplaces in that cave. Of course not to dive. But prob a bit higher then tall grass. So when you crouch with a small charakter like meg in "deep" water only your head can be seen. When you move in water there should be some waves . So you have to stay still to hide in water.
---
Yeah, I've been experiencing that for a while, don't have a clue why it's happening tho
---
We are still in the release window of Ghost Face.
---
So everyone is getting in que as killer to play as him.

Making que times insane for killer and quickish got survivor
---
Your suggestion will sound dumb to most people who haven't thought much about it. But you're right. Rewarding the player for not suiciding would be an objective improvement to gameplay. Less suicides = better balanced matches.
---
Because the ability, just spam right clic to increase your points.
---
Lmfao still mad
---
Your adrenalin rating is a simple handshake and barely enknowledged???? Come on bro
---
Howdy Carl
---
What level are you?
---
How many perks do you have in total?
---
Had a game against what I suspected were rank 20's (matchmaking was nuts at the time). I injured a baby dwight and jake and just watched them from a distance... they both ran to the basement on The Game map where dwight got into a locker and jake crouched next to it!! I lost a pip that game but didn't have the heart to kill them. It was funny and sad at the same time, I had to shoe them out of the basement too!!!
---
There are not much else to use on him, his  only weakness is pallets and loops, why not use perks to make those areas less painful to deal with? Duh 
---
Also saying you have played billy exclusively and saying he is so easy, back  it up with some proof perhaps?
---
His m2 power shock therapy.
---
You get 600 (or 300 I forgot) in the deviousness category.
---
900 hours so almost all perks and p3 lvl 20 rn on my pig which is who I'm noticing it on cause the rest of my chars have perks
---
Pretty sure the servers are down cause I’m getting the same thing
---
As survivor, start with Claudette if you'd like to be able to heal yourself and not have to find someone else to be able to to heal. 
---
As a killer, I'd honestly have to say buy The Cannibal so you can get BBQ and chili it doubles your points just for doing your job
---
Because the two bloodpoint farming perks work very well with him, Distressing which increases deviousness by 100% he gains very easily from his static, and BBQ for another extra 100%,
---
That was the streak?
---
I already do. I play so extremely nice it's honestly bad how I play. Most of the time I'll even leave a Survivor I find Self Caring in a corner alone. You get those 200 survival points you funky little Claud.
---
The weird hit and hook is definitely a latency issue between yourself and the killer. (Bad ping.) Not being able to work on one specific side of a generator has been a problem for ages now. There have been a few things that cause it.
---
Oh yeah I totally forgot about that perk since I never use it on Doctor (my current main)
---
(not sure how both traps were set off too)
---
I love using Bond, plus Up the Ante and Prove Thyself, great for meeting up with other survivors and doing gens quickly.  I've been running it with Spine Chill but it might be useful to swap for Empathy and know where everyone is all the time.
---
Bruh
---
*cries in hag*
---
It’s still a luxury perk that is less impactful than many other disruption based perks. It requires other perks to get the same level of power that other perk combos have without the drawback of being a Hex totem.
---
Looks like feng just took her dentures out
---
It sucks but not everybody wants to farm. Personally I would have hooked you all once and screwed around (360 hatchet shots or moonwalk) but that's just me, I never care about the kills. I prefer to try and outplay survivors, mindgames etc.. I've over 2000 hours and prefer to just have fun!
---
For Myers? I typically stick to BBQ, Ruin, M&amp;A, and Enduring.
---
Yep.. always wiggle it out no matter what
---
Why not?
---
It only benefits you and others?
---
And you paid for them to level the blood web...
---
Why store them?
---
Okay, a bit ashamed that i didnt think abou that. I dont know anyone who plays this game, but i guess i can ask some person after a match
---
Sloppy is one of the biggest reasons I run botany. It's much more efficient.
---
OH MY GOD that would be perfect :DD
---
^^^ This exactly. Probably get called a camper and a tunneler.
---
These idiots are right up his ass trying to unhook in front of him like a bunch of idiots.
---
I was Myers and this claudette had been pallet looping me and bming pretty much the whole game, then I stalked her at the gate and she didn't realize she was still too far from the exit and got caught. Used up Morri as she was the final survivor left. Felt good ngl.
---
Thanks, personally I don't because it never gets stacks, but when it does.... ;)
---
&gt;10-15 seconds of not leaving hook AND not starting a chase (this is important): hook progression slows by 50%.
---
Sounds like a decent idea
---
&gt;15-20 seconds: hook progression (and jazz music) stops.
---
Sounds like an absolute horrible idea
---
&gt;30 seconds: survivor frees himself and is applied borrowed time.
---
If this made it into the game, I'd uninstall
---
Yeah its pretty broke, I can activate it 100% of the time by holding crouch and sprint at the same time then letting go of crouch.
---
More like..disco or dance
---
That is seriously one of the most frustrating parts of the game to you? If you don't run deliverance you have less then a 5% chance of unhooking yourself, do you really think that is a game defining feature? 
---
If killers knew survivors could unhook themselves on the last hook they would just face camp every time. By eliminating the last survivor it potentially saves the killer having to wait several minutes doing nothing but stand there.
---
No penalty for heal speed.
---
Well if you're a normie and take that as an insult, sure
---
Not like they're threatening to come to your house if you don't farm
---
Tutorial
---
I am punishing them, by removing one of there teammates from the game.
---
Reword with PSA to Survivors, don't unhook your teammates unless it is safe to do so or you have Borrowed Time
---
I don't think the progress stopping is a good idea, but I have no objections to the progress slowing down
---
I live for the salt from these people. They teabag and unhook their teammate right in front of me and then get angry in the postgame chat because I tunneled them for the rest of the game.
---
You dug your own grave, my friend.
---
Monitor and Abuse for sure. In EW2, he only has an 16m terror radius by default. Monitor and Abuse will bring that down to 8m whenever you're not in a chase. As long as they don't see you coming, that leaves them with almost no time to react.
---
As an added bonus, that'll take him down to no terror radius in EW1, making it possible to get some nice grabs at the start of the game.
---
Nah that’s bill
---
Yeah, i hope they change his mori animation.
---
Why should they open a message from a stranger that is 99% going to be full of salt and toxicity?    I personally don't understand why you would waste time sending a message to a stranger anyway.  Is it something the 12 year olds do nowadays?
---
If I see someone going for the farm I'll always down the person unhooking. It's an incredibly easy down for no risk whereas waiting to hit the person being unhooked runs the risk of BT.
---
Do the tutorials for both the killer and survivor rolls. My recommendations for starting is Feng on the survivor side and the Doctor on the killer side. 
---
Feng has some of the best starting survivor perks. Technician is great for learning the timing of skill checks and makes it more forgiving as you learn. Alert is great for not only keeping track of where the killer is but knowing who you are facing early. Lithe is my favorite exhaustion perk it is useful on every map and you can control when it triggers and it is very unlikely you will accidentally trigger it like sprint burst and balanced landing. 
---
I recommend Doctor as a starting killer not because he is the easiest to use, experienced survivors know how run him around with out much trouble, it is because he helps you learn what survivors do. His ability will make them scream and reveal their locations. In doing this you start to notice what hiding places survivors frequent when hiding from you. In turn it also helps you id those locations when you are playing as a survivor. 
---
As others have said don't be afraid to lose at the start. Press through and keep playing, take every game as a learning opportunity.
---
How does that work?  You would rarely to never get to use both in a single chase, so it seems like a waste of perk slot.
---
I am a Claudette and I run borrowed time and we'll make it please don't loop us all together
---
Insidious on Ghost Face who already has no terror radius when he's in Night Shroud? I'm sorry, whenever I see Insidious on, it's because the killer is camping. Maybe that explains the matchmaking, game knows your playing like a rank 20 so it matches you up against them.
---
I agree, just wanted to mention that its not on the same level as MS since there is no possible scenario where you ever should use MS... even old Dark Murmur has more use than MS. I also guess MS is high on the list of perk reworks coming next.
---
It seems to be improving some at least on console. I was finding games in under a couple of minutes last night.
---
Definitely Ash or Laurie
---
What if they have borrowed time? Survivors wouldn’t need to use it if killers didn’t tunnel/camp hook.
---
Nonetheless, you should always for the unhooked. But calling an unhook “farm”...
---
Yeah, for anyone wondering, here are my reasons for suggesting this:
---
-killers who camp purely to punish a survivor might actually think twice about camping, knowing that the survivor will get rewarded.
---
Queue times are a *premium* these days.
---
Except they probably don't give a shit that you killed their teammate since they were fine farming them in front of you to begin with.
---
you guys should think of a new word for people, chud is getting boring
---
Was about to comment the same. Ruin and Lullaby compliment each other, Brutal Strength is never a bad choice and BBQ is well, BBQ :P
---
Hooks 1 of 2 survivors. Killer stands near him. Progression stops. Other survivor stands in hatch. Won't open because toxic  survivor on hook won't die. Congrats, we've invented a new way to hold the game hostage.
---
That's me and my friends (I'm the Mario) and I feel like I must add that we have a music bot on discord and we hade mario games ost playing in the background while we played.
---
I did try it on my computer and it didn't work
---
r/iamveryrandom
---
I dunno why you would ever run Hope over Adrenaline though.  You still get a speed boost plus it can bring you out of a dying or injured state.Hope just feels like the half-assed version of Adrenaline.
---
It's crazy sometimes, might depend on time of day or region but I was rank10 solo survivor against a rank8 killer and 3 rank20 survivors... needless to say the rank20's didn't make it..
---
Like. Don't get me wrong, this was hilarious. But the fact you can even do this is kinda stupid.
---
I actually do this and even look around where the first survivor was found, 60% of times it paid off.
---
Without a radius this means nothing. Apply a radius and this idea can be toxic af or useless
---
A Harbor / Dock or abbandoned Amusementpark would be cool.
---
I didn't think you could run DH whole exhausted.  Or does BL not exhaust you?
---
Stop, you are giving him flashbacks
---
Why and how would they even do that. You're keyboard just locks up and only allows you to leave the survivor?
---
Huntress gang 💪
---
When I spawn near hex I wait 10-15 secs If no one comes it's safe. Pretty dangerous to do hex right away.
---
Not very common you have teammates around?
---
Yah, you can. Do the gens and leave. Are you seriously trying to tell me that because he's camping someone you are all frozen and can't move?
---
So the one with the candle under it, is just setting the mood then???
---
Legends :DDD
---
Literally the reason I bought the game
---
They haven't done shit. You think killers give a shit about emblems? Fuck no, hit them in their Bloodpoints where it fucking hurts.
---
Haha nice
---
Me too lol Almost a porn for main billies hahahaha
---
How's the killer wait time on pc is it ok bcs on xbox it can be rough sometimes but either way I'm pretty sure I'm going to get it bcs it's on sale!
---
I'll probably still let him crawl out. Dunno why but I always let the last survivor escape even after catching them.
---
Why should this be Hex perk that anybody would take? I mean we have doctor for this and it doesn't work most of the time.
---
Spirit, huntress and hag. Spirit is amazing and has little counterplay (iron will) and can completely destroy in a chase, even good players. She can also use her ability for map control. Huntress is fantastic because she has endless potential. She, with practice can be insane. Long range hatchets can massively help and her hatchets force survivors to play differently than other killers. Hag is a complete monster. She can counter loops, disrupt them and end chases really quickly. She is also really good at basements, 3 gen strats or protecting totems/gens. Knowing where to place your traps and predicting survivors movements and pathways can go a really long way
---

Iridescent Head was developed by Nazi scientists on Hitler's personal request.
---
Not sure if Yoda or if studying bones is your hobby
---
Sometimes you might have to wait 5-10 minutes, but its never really bad unless theres a new killer, an event, or double BP going on.
---
I did this with Freddy last night and they all seemed shocked when blood warden activated! They all tried to keep running back and forth and trying to get out the gates lol, 3k baby! I was waiting for the disconnects to start popping!
---
Well, if you're using both together you're probably going to be aware of which perk you're going to want to proc first. The only downside to the combo is if you're put in a situation where you have to BL first and then DH becomes an empty perk for that chase.
---

---
Yesterday a Myers with infinite EW3 with siamese gates and hatch closed.
---
0% chance of escape.
---
yes I made the colors according to their levels 30 = blue 35 = purple 40 = red and the benefits that no character in green
---
Ok sweet kinda the same on xbox
---
If you tunnel a survivor that is any decent at running long enough for MoM to go off or in general, odds are you're going to end up throwing the game for it and perform poorly in every killer category. Is that how you're supposed to play?
---
Why are you like this

If only there was some sort of tutorial you could play for both sides on the menu...

---
3 survs alive before hatch was closed. Explain difference between difficult and impossible.
---
Which map is this
---
This happened to me with a Bill. I wasn't going to tunnel him at first but he just stood there on the 2nd floor of the pantry watching as I hooked a Feng and kept pointing and teabagging at me. And then he just ran me around the pantry instead of leaving the area to let Feng get saved. Later he farmed a Meg in front of me and pointed at me again. Call me stubborn, I just can't leave him. And I believe he deserved it for being a bad teammate. Others got out, whatever, what really matters is I three hooked that Bill. Worth it. He also accused me for looping around the hook afterwards lol
---
Dont you only play as trapper in the tutorial?
---
I love it when Michael tires up
---
I saw this in a killer perspective and one of the survivors told me after and I will never forget about this as well
---
In the lobby, there was a Meg, Dwight, Kate, and a Jake. Me and Meg were messing around while readying up to show that the Dwight needed to ready up. We got in and it was blood lodge (Auto Haven) And I see Dwight super toxic. Pallet looping, Tbagging at broken pallets, with Dead Hard and Sprint burst, I finally got him and I was ghostface and Tbagged him. Put him on the hook and saw a Jake crouching at the corner of the map, a Meg just walking around the map casually, and the Kate was trying to do unhook the Dwight.
---
Kate reached her destination and reached for the Dwight as I'm standing there watching her right next to Dwight, she thought I gave up and went for the Meg while I baited her while she was unhooking the Dwight..The Kate was now on the hook as well, saw the Jake going around the edges of the map crouching and the still saw the Meg walking around, I decided to go for the Jake and wasn't hard at all.
---
Hooked Jake and was now just the Meg just crouching on the hill waiting for me. Came up there to join her and she wanted me to kill her. As I did I begged for her not to wiggle sense I let non wigglers the hatch and she wiggled. As disappointed I was, I had to put her on the hook but he/she DM right after the match I got ghostface as Danny Devito. And it all stopped
---
Thank you for whoever reads this, I'm glad you took your time to read the little story of mine :)

They let you play any killer now? Didn't know

I mean, you're injured (*till the last second there*), hanging out under a hook, and not running away.

Why would he go after Bill?

half is probably excessive, sometimes you don't have much of a choice.
---
FRICK
---
so you down the survivor hook them, they escape, they heal and now you have to let them leave because they otherwise you are tunneling
---
I personally watched a few youtube video's just to understand the basics. I started with Trapper as his power is simple, but ye Kill Your Friends helps too.
---
You on PC or PS4 or Xbox?
---
*Halloween theme plays on accordion"*
---
Playing with randoms, its not a guarantee. Especially mid game
---
"Someone would to" lmao
---
Was Freddy changed yet
---
While a killer is under no obligation to go for the unhooker, and while the killer was in a pretty bad spot with one gen left by the time you died, that was a pretty dick move. As a general rule as killer I do try to go for the unhooker if I can find them but if I can’t, I’m going to go after whoever I can find
---
i see 2 addons
---
Na just trapper
---
Totally. Like WTF guys are you serious? Like why the fck he should DESERVE to win when he is: camping &amp; tunneling?
---
Probably a swf groups
---
I used a splinter the addons are for Doc
---
Even if you got BT, at least wait until the killer moves more than 6 inches away before you go for the unhook.
---
That nurse had great internet lmao
---
Thats The Doctor, not Freddy. And it shows add-ons were used. 
---
Did you upload the wrong image?
---
i love just pulling the survivor away from a gate or hatch
---
I always read SWF as Safe for Work
---
Thanks you
---
No it’s a splinter I do not own Freddy
---
Fun fact: if you watermark your memes they are made 35% funnier and everyone will think you're the coolest kid on the block.
---
They always wait until the killer is back in raid to unhook you without burrowed time
---
And that’s why you should use DS instead of Self Care.
---
I'm not sure if it's still a thing after the hotfix, but in the previous patch all you needed to do after setting it up was let go of sprint and start sprinting again to proc SB.
---
u got A D D O N'd
---
Lol we know not to enter the sleeping dragons dungeon... 
---
If I haven’t seen or heard the killer in 2mins after the game starts or see someone getting injured on my HUD, either they are AFK or in the basement! 
---
Rule #32 don’t poke the bear!
---
There is a smoking splinter which gives a free trial of whichever killer it's for,
---
No perks and no add-ons, basic Freddy is all they got to play
---
the hag is kind of stupid. the hook is at the pick up  so she had enough time to down both of them, but she was either afraid to swing or literally didn't see them cause she didn't bother looking around
---
Or learn to enjoy the salt.
---
I can't tell if these comments are serious or not lol. Splinter transforms you into a different killer and makes you play as them with no perks or addons. The addons he used were for doctor, but because he transformed into Freddy they weren't used and were instead burned ( atleast I'm pretty sure they're burned)
---
He’s rather annoying, but quite beatable lol
---
Enraged stamina is pretty neat. Actually. But I would nerf it so that It only gives 1% move speed per token. Remember that killers, on average, are already 5-10% faster than a survivor. The rest is pretty fun, though the leap seems like its asking to glitch out, lol.
---
Youtube is a decent place to learn, no doubt about it, but once you control a Killer yourself its a whole different thing haha.
---
Ohhh gotcha. I’ve never dabbled in that so I didn’t know. Well shit, good job then. I rarely get a 4k using Freddy with all my perks + add ons. Then again it usually matches me closer to rank 1 - 5, the survivors in this screenshot don’t have very good ranks.
---
Sorta sounds like a furry, lol? Anyways, good perks.  Make his power be the ability to run at legion speed and on all fours with a very large lunge, practically pouncing (not as big as pigs). However when he's out of power he should be slightly slower than the average killer and on 2 legs, practically stumbling like Billy.  His power should have a timer like legions, where he has to physically push himself up when his timer is up (cooldown).  His lunge when on all fours should be really gory as he rips a piece of the survivors arm, resulting in a massive cooldown where he gnaws on it and ends his power.  Blood should be highlighted and scratch marks should be narrowed and last longer in general.  The survivor bit would be affected by the mangled status effect as well as the one that slows down generator progression untill healed.  He sounds op but because he'll be so low to the ground when he's on all fours it'll still be balanced.  His vision should be near sighted like Freddy's.  Another benefit could be the ability to see smells of survivors, especially when they're in groups.  The tracking abilities would apply to him both in and out of his power.  The fog loss is good, the sound benefits are also fair.  Anyways that's my take on your idea, I think it sounds a little too much like legion, lol.
---
P3 detective tapps are people I know I can trust
---
# EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
One of the first things I learned as survivor was totems=600 points. I didn't survive much so took all the points I could get!
---
Agreed, make it a 12 meter radius but if another survivor is within that zone then don’t penalize the killer, teammates should be at a distance and doing a gen when you have a face camper! You sitting there waiting for a impossible hook save with no BT isn’t going far and most killers will snatch the rescuer off the hooked guy.
---
The rank 20 is probs in swf with the rank 12, and the mm got confused and threw in two 17s.
---
Also, I think this is how the mm should be making the lobbies, getting a killer with a rank that is closest to the highest ranking survivor.
---
Imagine thinking that getting hit 3 times in the same match especially if being heavily focused by the killer is no big deal.
---
Sure i guess, the basics are the same, but i'll still run into every single wall with Billys sprint, which is why i wanted a mode to practice other killers abilities
---
I mean, yeah, but it feels so GOOD to get them.
---
Almost is key here. 
---
Got something else today, was not happy.
---
Absolutely! Everyone on youtube can make it look easy! Seeing people land hatchets with Huntress from accross the map made me want to play her... but dam she hard on ps4!
---
Ha, this is perfect. Seems like you'll never catch up
---
Run BBQ and hook everyone once, then you get 100% in all catagories, then run Distressing and get another 100% in Deviousness.
---
Even if everyone escapes, you'll get 50k+ bloodpoints.
---
It also slows down the match getting everyone into tier 3 Madness, where they cannot do anything till they snap out of it.
---
If you're on a smaller map like The Game, or Haddonfield or Springwood, it's quite difficult for survivors to find the Ruin totem too, and the terror radius is like everywhere, thus the reason people call that build "***Doctor Worldwide***".
---
I mean they were clearly a crappy team. Brown ranks and even though you’ve covered it up you can see two of them didn’t get more than 10K points either.
---
Myers default dance
---
Or (now hear me out on this) I could down you, throw you back on the hook, and *then* chase your friend. The scratch marks will still be there by the time Im done hooking you. You go to the next hook phase, and I maybe get a hook on your friend too.
---
Me: you aint carrying anything i should know about right?
---

Also 4k as 1 perk Billy not bad.

Sure this isn’t Claudette mains?
---
from the front***
---
Ignore the toxicity and enjoy the game, as you seem to be a horror fan im sure you will love this game. :)
---
Honestly what could the do for realisticly for Micheal? A dirtier mask? It's not like his style changes in the movies.
---
It's not BP it's emblem score, which is even more meaningless.
---
I swear I've seen this post before. Few months ago
---
Yeah no shit. Im just saying that mechanically its dumb that he can stand BEHIND her and block a hook.
---
"Did I tell you how I met your grandma when I was over in 'Nam?"
---
"The game" have you like
---
As far as I know, yes. Infectious Fright *should* override the fake terror radius.
---
It’s just Illusionary, it doesn’t count as a real terror radius
---
I guess so
---
Is there a new one or do you mean the loss of emblem points?
---
The penalty is literally non-existent too. Facecamping through the whole hook phase at worse just makes you lose the value of the hook.
---
All this change really does is punish Killers for patrolling after hooking and setting up (with traps and things as Trapper / Hag) by making them just barely miss out on their emblem.
---
Or maybe it’s just so you know it’s turned on xD
---
Ha ha the joke everyone makes about playing Freddy. Almost as funny as "Hex: Eat Ass" and Nea's a Killer.
---
Sorry but Rob can put on a hell of a concert, but when it comes to directing he has no talent in that!
---
I wouldnt imagine so, I was playing a kill youre friends and was doing the impossible skill check build, which has calm and unnerving presence. UP didnt have an affect when the fake TR played, so i dont believe it would work with fright.
---
Well that's my point...I'm asking do they think its gonna be hate, the only toxicity here is you calling me a 12 year old for being nice to people, something this community needs that clearly you don't deliver, cant even ask a normal question without some sado like you attacking people, isn't that something 12 year olds do nowadays? :))))
---
Payday 2 was fun. Some of those achievements were just... bizarre. I'm looking at you Goat Sim.
---
This really isn't that special. The survivors weren't even good.
---
Find horny single totems in your area!
---
Tunneling is the issue but not for the reason you are trying to make it. The more time you spend in a chase, the more time you're not defending gens. If you've spent enough time chasing a survivor that they get MoM off then you haven't accomplished much else.
---
Lmao

---
Does a top tier killer really need more buffs?
---
No of course, it’s in the game. Just as camping is, one downs, nurse, etc. It is unfun though, just as nurse is and camping is. But you gotta use this kinda stuff in higher ranks to even have a decent match (not camping though, just an example)
---
Does anybody else want Michael to drive a little car around now and burn rubber as he's stalking?
---
Probably unpopular but I don't think he's top tier. He's below nurse and spirit to me.
---
Dude i get those all the time. Running the most obnoxius survivor perks but calling me out for noed

If the Devs decide to give Billy a Update/Rework, I'm 100% certain they would give him the appropriate amount of add-ons *(4 Common, 5 Uncommon, 5 Rare, 4 Very Rare, 2 Ultra Rare)*.
---
Of course it's Leatherface.
---
Not really a buff but something to make him enjoyable. While I can see these being buffs, there  can always be alternatives to the ultra rares instead of the ones I mentioned.
---
Yeah matchmaking. Is very broken especially on ps4 can't go a single game without this
---
Were both rank 8 and we get a rank 17 and a rank 20 one game agaist a rank 2 killer
---
I have 600 achivements from before (which counted, so I started out with 9,1k and 3,8k from DBD. Currently sitting at 13,3k at the moment. I love to play as the Pig, but I kinda need BBQ. So idk what to get. Probably Bubba
---
I just think having the ultra rares to spice it up y'know?
---
Right? If the moths are circling, I should keep up the flame.
---
Micheal Meyers confirmed Decepticon.
---
Billy is definitely top tier.
---
The BK Myers build is, Judith’s Tombstone, Vanity Mirror add ons and your not allowed to stalk and must stay Tier 1
---
I can’t beat Freddy regardless. I’ve faced him enough to know his gimmick but not avoid him.
---
I love the reaction! Good shit.
---
I don’t get it :l
---
What? When I play killer, every person takes 5 hits. You can be hooked 3 times and be full health before being hit again. Have you played this game?
---
**Tire 3:** He runs you over for an insta-down.
---
Makes sense to me.
---
I'm on PS4 so sadly I cant get these. I always wanted Playstation to put a reason to get trophies as I'm sitting on 5 platinums and thousands of other trophies. I would get bubba since I can see him being a fun killer.
---
I don't own any dlcs so I cant really comment on what to get.
---
Does OoO still let you reveal Ghostface from across the map and through walls?
---
I don't love this movie, but Parker Posey is life and I enjoyed her so much in this.  She's probably the only thing I did like.
---
And you thought Peach couldn't get any hotter.
---
I can see Spirit being above Nurse if put into the right hands.
---
Leaving 3 downed bodies to chase the last injured player, literally 3 minutes into the game, is the definition of sweaty. Sure my team was dumb but that doesn’t change the fact.
---
Omg you stream? No way! What is it calle...nah don't care.
---
It's not okay if they're on my team, stay away OP
---
Something tells me that had they not cc'd you still would have depipped.
---
Removed - Shaming other players, oversaturated content
---
The sad thing is as a survivor you bring object to troll yes but also because your bored of holding M1 on a gen. So if the killer decides to go on your your of every pallet on the map it's a victory really.
---
I didn’t say it was me, just trying to help some redditors not feel so god damn picky all the time with the wording of a comment lmao. I’m perfectly enjoying my life thank you :D
---
The cooler trapper he's like regular trapper but his beartraps have sunglasses
---
Oh, you're aproaching me? Instead of running away you come to me?
---
This is what I was looking for!
---
They just say it's polite so they have an excuse to do it
---
Dead Hard &amp; Decisive Strike got MAAD Props from ya boy.
---
OP, you aren't right upstairs bro!
---
I loved this!!
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Also for the remaining survivor, I hate that DCs don't give points to remaining survivors since they lose points, too.
---
If you're hooked 3 times, you're dead.
---
Minor bug where legion has male sounds when starting a game as a female legion skin, but then eating a pallet stun gives the female sounds back. Anyone else experience that?
---
Streak of confidence.
---
these are the kind of survivors i save my moris for
---
Good luck, they look like they can’t use their flashlights though
---
Lmfao
---
Yeah, GG to OP, the Freddy rework preview they showed on their stream looks like he'll be a high tier killer
---
I know right is frustrating
---
when you know you already piped you just don't care
---
Yeah, would be cool if he like stabbed the person while invisible, then the sword just becomes visible with blood on it while it's through them. Something brutal like that.
---
Are you per chance a Ginger cat that is find of Italian cuisine?
---
There should be a system of points gained from DCs based on your expenses add-ons/offerings and how long they were in
---
I agree with you that Billy is below Nurse and Spirit, but he's definitely high tier.
---
This is entirely their fault
---
Nevermind there are a good many toxic players who do something like this solely to taint the killer, so most killers would probably have a similar reaction to this
---
What is this from?
---
Understandable
---
I think I'll use this as a perk tier list as I have 5 hours in the game :)
---
The Christine Chapter
---
Franklin's Demise and call it a day.....
---
But they waited to the struggle phase to unhook you so now you get killed
---
Rank 20
---
PS4 - POST UPDATE 3.0.1
---
THE LEGION:
---
• When getting suffering ANY stun while in Feral Frenzy, the Feral Frenzy VFX doesn't go away until Feral Frenzy is activated again.
---
• Sometimes Susie *(Potentially Julie too)* will sound like Frank and her clothing makes a leathery sound *(Franks base outfit)* for most or for an entire trial, maybe even multiple trials. 
---
• On rare occasions, Freak Frenzy will have no Freak Frenzy animation. I am unsure how to recreate this.
---
THE SPIRIT:
---
• The Spirts katana tends to disappear from her hand on occasion. This could be caused by spamming the attack interaction or being stunned by a pallet mid swing. Otherwise I am unsure how to recreate this.
---
THE WRAITH:
---
• The Wailing Bell disappears sooner than I tended during the bell stowing animation. It's very noticeable when spamming the cloak interaction.
---
I only let people go if they are right on the line facing away and teabagging, it's kinda the universal sign of 1 last free hit as the momentum of the hit makes them leave. Or at least that was in my games.
---
I hate when my teammates t-baging close to gate, i mean if think you’re good player t-bag in the middle of the game not at the end like a pig😣
---
You can get some sick plays, once I got downed on the hatch and when adrenaline popped, I opened it with the key I took from a friend.
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
On PS4 there is this audio bug, I haven't tried it with Julie skins of legion but with Susie, she starts every trial with the male breathing, vaulting, and attacking sounds. When I got stunned either by DS or by a pallet, I got the female sounds that Susie should have started with back. It's minor and workable, just a bit unimersive.
---
Stay humble
---
I hope it’s random
---
The saddest part is I played with a glass splinter for pig and got bullied
---
I get that. You don’t wanna farm them or lose points in the emblem. In future references try to make a judgment call on the spot, if the killer is coming back or doing a light proxy and you don’t feel confident making that save go to a gen and hope someone else gets them or you can try What Ian Malcom did in Jurassic Park and take Agro ensuring someone else gets the save while you’re leading Rexy away.
---
Xbox user and I’m still dealing with these issues sometimes too.
---
To me it feels better to 4k and show that even with their BM I was able to keep my cool and wipe the whole team.
---
But you do you...
---
Dude...I swear. I've had like three games like this in the past day or so. It's like some of the survivor players drank tainted water that make them ridiculously prone to laughably unsafe rescue attempts. I don't understand.
---
Oh yeah I definitely see that, adrenaline can definitely make a late game chase for somebody. It's just when 4 people are running it, it kind of feels like a wasted perk slot on all of the other survivors. Especially given that you wont be able to use other exhaustion perks for 40 seconds.
---
Its obvious with 5 gens remaining that it isnt camping and he isnt tunneling. 
---
How about stop shoulder checking the killers? If the killer sees a swarm of survivors around the hook, you are the neanderthals here. Offense.
---
oh lmao i never used it
---
Also it being a tier 3 perk meaning he either had the worst luck in perks in a bloodweb or purposefully picked it over other perks.
---
You’re fine! I’m talking about the others who crouch there hiding, wait till you hit struggle, latch on to you and get pulled off by the killer. 
---
You’re the type of teammate I want because I would come back to save you if you did that for me.
---
Backstory: Played a game as Legion, one of them DCed; I assume it's cause I was a legion - the person messaging me was a Claudette with the obvious toxic build + flashlight, he got mad I assume because I downed him easily cause he couldn't sprint burst or juke me properly which was an easy hook, and he failed every flashlight save - I tried to not go over-aggressive or play "tOxiC lEgIoN" since it was a 3v1, all 3 survivors escaped but I didn't really care since I got decent BP, Claudette tea-bags at the exit gate and sends this message
---
tl;dr toxic claudette failed to "mindgame" me and calls it tunnelling despite a killer trying to be nice for it being 3v1
---
That happened to me yesterday- Went up to a gen that a Meg had started and moved away from at the beginning of the match thinking "Lol why is she leaving?"
---
Cue Michael Tier II
---
No, he was running no add ons.
---
me personally i don't do anything different. i just play the game as normal. sometimes i kill everyone, sometimes i don't. it is what it is.
---
PC. Player pips error. Rank update error. Please, fix this, impossible to play
---
Its a spine...
---
Dude this looks so good.
---
And then in the most chad voice ever. SHOULDN’TA GOT CAUGHT DEWD
---
Boring. I guess
---
Fuck me that is disturbing to look at. Imagine a monster like this with razor-sharp teeth.
---
PC (probably consoles too)
---
\- Myers Stalk range is sooo short
---
\- vomiting at the sky with corrupt purge sometimes crash the game
---
\- sometimes imposible to stalk crouched as Ghostface
---
I think you mean Laurie.
---
It means someone thought the match was a sleeper/boring match
---
Is the rework out?
---
Ma Boi PainReliever, oh yea
---
Keeping in mind you watched the entire game - At which point was I meant to smack gens or break pallets?
---
Overwhelming Presence, Distressing, and Franklin's Demise. RIP items.
---
Alice Hardy or Chris Higgins
---
Camp. no one wants to see their buddy die.
---
Pain Reliever has taught me everything I know on DBD
---
I still suck ass but he made me suck way less ass.
---
I've been on Xbox Live for almost 15 years, and for the first time ever I had to set my messages to private just because of this game. I was getting a toxic message after almost every match as killer, even when I played extremely fair. It's the best decision I ever made, and I'm never going back to public messages unless I'm on a different game.   
---
Survivors will always be salty man, buts seriously, consider setting your messages to private. It makes the game a lot more enjoyable, trust me.
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse is great for her. Since no one cleanse you're an m1 killer with insta downs so small TR really helps you. I run Ruin, M&amp;A, Brutal Stregth and... Play with your food. It's hilarious. You're instadowning rocket with small TR.
---
To be quite honest if your internet is SO bad that people think it's a lagswitch, you shouldn't be playing. Either get better internet or don't play killer, because you shouldn't be okay with ruining other people's experiences. It's perfectly fair for you to be banned.
---
I'm guessing the latter. Tier 1 Furtive Chase and Thrilling Tremors are better than Insidious. That is unless you're camping... I experimented with Furtive Chase and got my full stacks. It was absolutely amazing and hilarious sneaking up on survivors and them having no idea what hit them.
---
I check if they are swf before every game.
---
If its a 4man I dodge, if its a 3man I sometimes play it out, sometimes dodge.
---
I dont mind duos though.
---
The reason is simple, I dont like losing 3 gens because of a 1 minute chase.
---
Probably the Bee
---
Even cooler
---
Lmfao. If I didnt, then I'd be called out for tunneling. Wtf. Do you have so many rules that you think killers should follow that you can't keep them straight holy shit.
---
And here we have another toxic surv which never expired a bad Internet Connection, congratulations.
---
I didn't say one was more useful than the other, I'm saying that because survivors have more options, they get less if both
---
Noooo😂
---
Omg so true
---
WOW, damn
---
She had iron grasp tier 100 bahaha
---
The woman in the picture isn't giggling. It's a screenshot from a show, and during this moment she's giving a fake smile while she tries to convince someone else of something they don't want. It's not actual happiness or joy. Sorry to be "that guy," but I think that's what /u/MilkmanForever was getting at.
---
I've been on Xbox Live since late 2012 and went through the era of "prime" Modern-Warfare Xbox 360 days where toxicity reeked yet I still survived that, but boy-oh-boy once DbD came, the toxicity and ignorance hit harder than a Modern Warfare 3 lobby on the Xbox 360.
---
It's surprising to see DbD's community surpass CoD's lol
---
I would but I'll miss out on the good killer messages, I've been titled a player's favourite Freddy cause of how I played, a good legion, giving survivors the hatch, ect; and I don't want to miss out on that.
---
That’s what I thought. Probably just salty and said it because they lost. Had they not farmed each other so hard and used adrenaline they would’ve done much better
---
Imagine playing myers on myers.
---
may i ask why you lobby dodge? it doesn't make sense to me, especially with queue times being as long as they are. I'd rather get trashed than sit and stare at an empty lobby waiting for people to join.
---
"Just get better. What's that, if you get camped and tunneled right away you don't actually get a chance to get better?"
---
You probably depiped 🤣
---
Chinese or not, you didn't really try hard enough.
---
Safe Wor Fork
---
It’s because Ghostface stalks the survivors from around corners
---
We found a 4Head boys
---
Yea Claudette is the real killer as she hides and let's your entire team get assfucked
---
It honestly depends on the situation. If that person is on first hook I will atleast look around the map for the totem.  Once they go into phase 2 and I see the killer is camping that person I will then leave.
---
At level 25 you get 2 guaranteed perks before that you only have a chance to get 2. No bug or glitch everything works as expected.
---
I don't care if it's a SWF group or not when I'm playing killer. A lot of players are just out to have fun and I'm not going to change up my playstyle because people are together.
---
To be fair, we were 10 minutes into the match. We didn’t gen rush. I know he was chasing someone for a good 2 minutes. I shook him off twice too. His playstyle was very peculiar and he never damaged gens either. He had 4 perks, so it certainly wasn’t his first time playing as Ghostface. 
---
Plus, Hex Ruin, which was destroyed within 10 seconds as I spawned next to it.
---
Yeah I guess, but toggle repair would be nice.
---
It only penalizes you if there are no other survivors within 16 meters of the hook. So what you're talking about doesnt matter
---
Send me a source
---
Yikes
---
Sorry for this unrelated comment but I felt the need to ask this
---
*ever barely get out of the killer’s vision as they pass the corner and end up right next to them but they never notice while also dealing with internet problems that zip you a full survivor length away from your spot just from adjusting your survivor’s position to stay hidden?*
---
I always enjoy seeing responses from people who assume that the survivors are all crowding the hook, and then seem incapable of just....going after the next person. "But then they'll get the unhook." And? You've just put someone else on the hook and now get to turn around and do it again. There is no downside unless you just don't like playing the game in the first place...
---
Dead Hard makes chases last 1 second longer than it would've against a decent killer. Patrolling gens instead of tunneling counters adrenaline. There's no counter to NOED, it give you more speed and is combined with bloodlust and instadown with no warning. Maybe if NOED activated when gates open.
---
I’m kinda in the same boat, my wifi is really screwy and, some days it’s solid and smooth, others it’s a dumpster fire. Problem is I need to play a match to figure out whether or not it can handle hosting that day. 
---
Most days I’ll ask the survivors in post how the connection was, and if it was sketchy I’ll do something else 
---
Though, there’s also days where they’ll also act like complete dickheads, I’ll try to explain the situation some understand, others don’t. 
---
At the end of the day, as long as your intent isn’t to load up a game knowing it’ll be unfair to them I’d say you’re fine 
---
(Also if you bought the game on steam and meet the requirements you might be able to get a refund)
---
Lucky
---
4Head?
---
If you're on PC I'd be glad to help you after I get home from work.
---
Have you played him as of recently?  I thought it wasn't too bad until I played him.  Honestly games with him are torture   it takes so long to down people.  The ability to jump pallets is only efficient once.  Once you jump it once and cooldown they're already on the other side.  Some of his add-ons also seem glitched, the cooldown add-on barely does anything for me, if anything at all.
---
not for defending him, but if u really hate him like me, just ignore his channel and move on
---
Ah man, the glory days of CoD. Those were some amazing times. 
---
But yeah man I get that, there definitely was some positivity that I got from time to time. People would message and say stuff like "I was the best huntress they've seen on console", "nice mind games",  or even "wp" lol. That felt really good not gunna lie, but idk, the over abundance of "kys" and crying when they got killed even when I played the absolute fairest I could became too much. To be honest though the saltiness did make me laugh a lot lol
---
Is this the survivor equivalent of giving the last alive the hatch?
---
Can we stop complaining about how Survivors hate killers for using NOED and then use those perks, and vise-versa, the community is killers vs. Survivors and it's really pissing me off. For a game made for mature audiences, nobody in the community is mature at all, we all act like 5 year olds because we see that survivors are running these certain perks that we hate or killers are running these certain perks that we hate and everyone exaggerates so much it's ridiculous! NOED sucks to go against and saying "Just do totems" isn't a valid reason to use it. Adrenaline, Dead Hard, and Self care all suck and there aren't that many good counters to these perks other than Dead Hard unless the survivor is using it as a boost in their chase and not to avoid the swing. We all know they suck to run. Yet we all have tk run these things because one side will not stop running their meta perks. I personally never run NOED and limit myself to Self-care and Dead Hard being my on meta perks on survivor. If everyone did this then it would make our community so much better because we're all too immature to realize that this game gave us these things to use. I'm sure this post of referring to the fact that they DC'd while having the bloodpoint offering but the perks are apart of it too, I can almost promise you that.
---
When you cleanse the ‘death totem’, (Haunted Grounds), it makes your entire team exposed. The one to the right is just Hex: Ruin.
---
Looks like the killers always need to let the survivors escape or else they are going to be mad, sad and they'll trashtalk
---
I dont have a source, believe it or not up to you...
---
Dedicated servers are coming soon, then your internet will only be a problem for you instead of everyone else as killer. If that's what you want lol.
---
In that case the other survivor has the rest of the map to finish gens and open the fate. Simple.
---
Even better idea.
---
He bing bongs multiple times near their head until they die from the bing bongs.
---
If u dont mind, i'll share ur video and give u the credits on a Brazilian DbD forum lol I think that some ppl may like it.
---
Sorry I misspoke. Definitely not the most frustrating, but I think it’s a last chance effort that they removed from the game even though the chance is slim anyway. But yeah I do agree, them sitting there watching the last survivor is definitely a waste of time.
---
Yeah I only have a couple of games on him though I found I love furtive chase. I want to try pairing it with Make your choice and it will be an easy identifier of who is exposed.
---
I’d love a mall, maybe an old abandoned penitentiary as well? An amusement park would be awesome too. I’d also love a Silent Hill-esque dilapidated town.
---
I'm not one to complain, but every update they break things i cannot understand how they break it,
---
Add a new killer
---
**Wake up breaks**
---
**Collisions bug out.**
---
I'm no developer but is anyone able to explain this, when they add something new something silly somehow breaks?
---
like remember when plague came out and people were getting stuck in trees?
---
Avoid that grass! Top Spirit players will listen for breathing and grass moving. Hilarious clip!
---
Oh man that poor Meg- Her team didn't even wait to try to see if they could get off the hook themselves either. I wish people would just take the failure lol
---
Fairly new to DBD and it’s community. Is this guy toxic or something? What’s the back story?
---
OP, sorry to hear that. Did you get banned from PS4 &amp; PC or just PC?
---
As someone who plays both survivor and killer I do this and will continue to do this. I like getting the extra points most of the time when I'm killer so I will always do it as survivor. If killer mains want to be angry let them, theres no way to change that lol
---
Michelin Tires Up
---
it's an ad
---
Thanks.
---
Agreed, as a Laurie main I may not be *the* best player but I try hard to at least keep the killer occupied and I love being altruistic because it fits the character and we all gotta survive, ya know?
---
It's just common sense. People told you your connection was THAT bad and yet it didn't stop you. You can only blame yourself.
---
I mean, it says in your screenshot "Version of the game: 2.3.0 PS4" which means he recorded it some time last year.
---
He's evaded mutiple bans and continues to play the game,
---
First ban was griefing &amp; exploiting
---
second ban was abusing a prestige exploit
---
and his most recent was Griefing &amp; Gameplay abuse "*Slighty similar to exploiting if not the same*"
---
Because thats the ability. They can't see you, you can't see them. You can hear them though.
---
Healthy breathing is hearable, running too and scrarch marks are visible.
---
If you injure a survivor there is like no chance for them to get away. They moan so loud you can track them down very easily in phase walking.
---
Spirit needs a little bit of practice, once you get good with her, you can consistently 3-4k every game.
---
Well, the thing is, if I play killer I typically get at least a 2-3k. If I have to sacrifice that for one game, I'm fine with that.
---
It would be great to see some ultra-rare, entity-related addons that change his gameplay
---
That's very old footage.
---
I honestly don't even know if ochido plays this game anymore. Not often atleast.
---
I bought Michael because I thought the Shirtless skin was real :(
---
Copyright striking is a disgusting practice to silence people you don't like.
---
Don't get me wrong, i think Ochido is a shit person aswell however using the copyright system as a weapon is disgusting and should not be encouraged. 
---
As a content creator there is literally nothing worse than having to deal with false strikes, especially when it's just to silence a negative opinon.
---
No problem. I can understand being frustrated by it but it seemed like you were over blowing its significance. I'm glad you are do reasonable!
---
How else do they punish hook camping without harming killers when survivors swarm the hook.
---
Tf are they supposed to do, go check a gen they know you aren't on?
---
&gt; This cunt is fucking back to uploading dbd devs
---
*Looks at description*
---
"Version of the game in the video - 2.3.0 PS4"
---
I hate the guy too, but also, reading is fundamentals
---
I would love to see the bell curve of the survivor and killer ranks. You mentioned that he’s difficult to play at rank 1... but how many people does that actually effect? You can’t focus balance from the top down, it just doesn’t work in most cases.
---
Good example is Overwatch. They’ve buffed a load of characters to try and deal with the “goats” meta (really tank heavy) that’s been plaguing the highest levels of play (like the OWL for example). However, for pretty much everyone that wasn’t a professional overwatch player, “goats” wasn’t so much of a problem;
---
Now all the hero’s that got buffed are and to make matters worse, they didn’t change the meta at the top. It’s pretty much the same as it was.
---
Dwight is a great example of why you shouldn't be so close to the hook when your going for a save. Also I bet this is console
---
He can sneak up on people though. And teabag. The mightiest skill of them all.
---
*wiggle*
---
Glory days of CoD held an incredible amount of toxicity and even DbD surpasses that. 
---
The only reason my messages aren't private is cause of those nice messages and incase I actually get a message I need to respond to.
---
I pulled one of these off a while ago. Had no sacrifices and this guy was moonwalking and tbagging the exit. He was raging in the chat, everyone else was laughing.
---
&gt; another toxic surv
---
What? How do you know /u/KickAss93 is a "toxic survivor" ? that's a bit of a stretch, mate.
---
I normally just sit there screaming at my monitor for them to run and unhook me, but it never happens
---
High tier yes, he's still a tier below spirit and nurse to me though, so he's not *top* tier.
---
Prepare for survivor DC in 3 . . . 2 . . . .
---
Yeah I'd say spirit has a higher skill ceiling, much more mind game potential.
---
I personally relate to this, I’d have had five tokens but they either unhooked right next to me, deliverance’d away, or just didn’t go for the person 
---
Granted this is a rare occurrence, most of the time my hex gets curbstomped instantly after the game decides to spawn it in a field, next to a generator, surrounded by the four survivors
---
I had 2 p3 claudettes chase me while i was being chased by the killer for a full 5 minutes. When i eventually went down he picked me up in the open and they didnt even attempt to get the flashlight save. How can people consider it fun to chase a teammate while hes being chased by the killer
---
I bet you get a lot of hate
---
No, the worst is when you get hooked after just saving them from the hook and they stand by and wait or run away happily to heal themselves and then don't come back.
---
Mildly triggered.
---
Because of the made up rules that survivors invented that they expect a killer to follow.
---
I camped one guy with the EGC half way through, fight me.
---
Someone tried to rescue him and neither made it to the exit gate
---
Don’t ruin other people’s game with your shit connection.
---
But then you have those swf groups that all have flashlights and teabagging and point at you when they drop a pallet in front of you does that not want you to chuck on even a mori ?
---
Found the survivor main
---
Now this is why you need Franklin’s Demise
---
Nah I think this sub overrates him a little 
---
He has mobility like nurse does, but nurse can instantly negate pallets. Billy is still an M1 killer at most loops, assuming they're good survivors. Way less mind game potential than spirit.
---
He's very good, but he's a tier below spirit and nurse, so he's not top tier.
---
Ok I’m not in legal stuff but this guy is making videos on this game and he is in the videos showing glitches etc which would hurt the brand of dbd which is legally suitable isn’t it ?
---
This is why I always run decisive strike
---
Agreed, I always love getting teamed up with Laurie!
---
You can rant about tbagging, swf, anything really, and those make some sense, but ranting about someone not pressing ready (probably because they are finishing their loadout, or getting a drink irl etc.) is the stupidest thing ever. He makes you wait 60 seconds holy shit. What an asshole!
---
No when I play killer I like getting those points. The few seconds taken don't really waste any time or change anything lol
---
First of all he doesn’t play dead by dead light anymore. He put up a pole to his subscribes asking if they wanted to see all the dbd content that he never uploaded and they said yes. He doesn’t even play DBD anymore so stop crying like a bitch.
---
I used one the other day. A survivor DCed when I downed them. One killed themself on the first hook to prevent me from using it. And I killed the remaining two. All spammed me calling me toxic.
---
Yeah 4 man swf groups I’ll dodge simply because they like to annoy the shit of you and gen rush you while the other one distracts you, I’ve even had a group where there were two survivors on one gen and two on the other and I couldn’t keep up
---
My psn is same as on here, send me a friend request and if you have a Mic I've got some free time - I'm a killer main.

More like Laurie

Only time this Mori is good. And even then lol

Next time pay attention to the red light.
---
The fake ones don't have it.
---
There are a lot of factors when it comes to which killers are the best at rank 1. If the survivors are shit, then Freddy will be really good. If the person playing killer is shit, then Freddy will be the worst. There’s way too many factors, but compared to the rest he is the worst. Although I main Freddy and do well with him, it’s a lot harder to win as Freddy than Nurse or Billy. 
---
Freddy is one of those characters that’s annoying to fight but not good. Pre-update legion was like this. People tend to think that Legion was OP, when in reality they weren’t. You’ll see a lot of people say they were, but Legion was never OP, just super fucking annoying.
---
60% of the time people don't ready up they leave in like 30-40 seconds. from there the lobby gets cursed and no one else joins. then few more minutes and i get kicked with SESSION CLOSED after already waiting for over 7-8 minutes.

i'm sorry that the fact i am frustrated with literally wasted time offends you

That's what I planned on instead of the same ol' stuff on Billy. Make him more enjoyable.

In Michaels head: "dear gosh is that Dr Loomis! I HE'S STALKING ME FROM THAT TREE!
---
i honestly don’t know all the perks off the top of my head. i only play claudette as a survivor though, i don’t think that’s one of hers.
---
I don't remember how, but I was hooked as the last survivor and unhooked myself without deliverance. I ran towards the opened exit gate and was downed by the killer. He picked me up and I used ds and escaped.
---
Michelin Mike
---
I say top tier because he's way way easier to use that Spirit and Nurse so you're gonna see him be even more successful than those 2.
---
&gt; 4 man swf groups I’ll dodge 
---
i'll never understand this mentality. Wouldn't you rather play the game then load up another lobby? 
---
I'm also curious as to what your general expectations for a match are?
---
It only takes lore from the first film and nothing else, it never mentions any form of relationship between the two only that Michael escaped a mental institution and that Laurie was attacked while babysitting
---
I did! :(
---
If you want your devour hope to last longer, dont run it with ruin lol. If there is a ruin they will find that devour hope in the beginning.
---
Good luck with the shrine. Buy him on sale. Save you a few years.
---
SWF are more altruistic, use it to your advantage.
---
This piping system makes literally 0 sense
---
Like I wanna enjoy the game not bleed from my ears stfu Laurie.
---
Buuuuut you see, this is what we call a "dickweed move" as you just hooked someone who was unhook right in front of you, in which they had no power over, then gave them 0 chance to get away. Playing as killer does NOT mean that you have to be mean and ruin the good time of someone who is playing survivor.
---
Emote spammers getting just absolutely dunked on will never not be cathartic.
---
Someone was outside the gates like in the video and was being cocky.  I just sat there and watched them get sacrificed from the endgame collapse
---
This. i bought Bubba and leveled him up until i got the Chili. never used him.
---
This shit is no better than the wake up bug. People who use abuse this shit needs to get banned
---
Bizarre. Maybe you are blessed by the entity?
---
I played as killer and there was legit this laurie with object of obsession who was HIDING behind barrels waiting for the 2 other survivors to die. I decided to leave the other 2 alone mid-chase and go for the laurie. She was right by the hatch and somehow forgot/didnt know object lets me see her too. She was an easy down as well.
---
My expectations are to find a match where I don’t get flashed lighted every time I go to break a pallet or pick up a survivor and the constant teabagging that everyone does
---
Not sure if this is actually a bug or if something in the audio was changed but during almost all of my survivor games last night, the killer heartbeat notification was "doubled up". The heartbeat would start and then start again over itself, doubling up and effectively blasting out my eardrums every time the killer was near.
---
Ok, maybe the sparks are made using photoshop, but the rest of the drawing seems like it's done on paper, using brushes, pencils and watercolors
---
Yeah, I am acquainted with the game’s culture
---
True alright thank you
---
Also part of the Hearthstone sub and loving this format :D
---
they aren’t people
---
IF I COULD I WOULD, BUDDY
---
Can confirm when i ever pick laurie my goal is to save everyone or loop the killer
---
I said,, killers that camp and tunnel WITH 5 GENS REMAINING" If u camp at the end its justified, u just try to ensure ur kill nothing wrong with that. Survivors don't seem to notice the difference. I am a killer main myself and happen to camp while trying to ensure my kill :)
---
I agree.
---
*Blood Warden activates*
---
Nope because flashlights have counterplay whether it's avoiding saves or just opening your ears at pallet blinds. Taunting doesn't bother me either, but I'll dish it back in good fun. Mori's aren't fun for either side and I'd rather beat a team through my own skill than rely on one.
---
All it is is emblem point reduction. That doesn’t deter me from making sure my prey doesn’t leave the book for our lord and savior Nea.
---
Use shrouds it’ll hide the offering and they’ll think your bringing a ebony mori
---
it doesn't take long to lvl somone up when you consistently use bbq&amp;c; so I recommend deranking to yellow rank and play Bubba and lvl him up using bbr&amp;c then when you unlock the teachable grind out blood points using Bubba with bbq&amp;c. Then spend those on your main.
---
I know what you said. It was just funny that they called me a "camping shithead" and a "toxic faggot" at the endgame screen.
---
Depends on the context. It can mean boring but the wider use of it is laughing in Korean. On the Korean keyboard it's  ㅋㅋㅋ  but on ENG keyboards its replaced by the Z key, thus zzz. I play on Asia so I get a lot of z's and w's (laughing in Japanese).
---
not relevant at all except for ghost face, i just played against them for the first time. they don’t cause the heartbeat survivors hear?? they got me so quick lmao
---
Survivors be like "wow ur such a hook camper"
---
whose the dumbass bringing cake in red ranks... wait for the next rank reset... they arent going to disappear on us
---
I'm a killer main myself but I hate the fact that toxic killers ruin our reputation.
---
Ever heard of the endgame collapse?
---
Yeah MOM sure rewarded daring survivors...like the ones who got hit twice, hooked, unhooked, downed again, hooked and unhooked. Perk is activated, such a daring survivor
---
Feel free to use it!

[Enjoy!](https://imgur.com/gallery/IZKhAbn)

How did you know? ;)
---
I can only imagine her frustration as the team just fell apart around her. D:
---
Maybe that’s just the old jaded killers. I’m a new killer player and I just keep my head down and do my job
---
I’m at work right now but I will get it to you when I get off
---
Well it is a horror theme based game.  Which is all about suffering
---
Higher rank killer 4k’s lower rank survivors.
---
News at 11.
---
I need whatever innate power of luck you have lmao
---
I’m the one one who didn’t use one so... not me. And.. what? Rank reset for red ranks puts everyone at like 9-12, and we will still be playing the same exact people unless we don’t play for two weeks. You can’t dodge your rank with rank reset, which is one of the many reasons the reset system is completely pointless.
---
I usually start doing ridiculous stuff, a lot of times they'll just mess around with you and do dumb things themselves, I love meme games
---
You are really stupid it’s fucking teabagging grow a pair you pussy
---
That's a good idea!
---
Yeah but even though he's easier, his potential isn't as great as spirit or nurse. They have much higher skill ceilings.
---
It's Laurie's perk. It allows you to do a skillcheck and escape the killer's grasp for 60 seconds after being unhooked
---
I would love to see a map full of corn
---
Now imagine all this punishment when you as a killer knows there’s an urban evading Claudette ready for the unhook but you just can’t find her.  No, these changes are terrible.
---
There's nothing wrong with them. Self Care is great for solo survivors, Urban Evasion can be amazing if you don't let it trick you into crouching and hiding when you should be running it doing something, and Sprint Burst is the most consistently reliable exhaustion perk (if not exactly the best one.)
---
oo nice, i need that pretty much every game it seems like lol. can other survivors share perks though?
---
I wanna see the tethered from the film Us as a killer, with the dad ( winston dukes character) as a survivor, and the carnival/ underground area as a map. Would be dopppe
---
That's actually pretty smart. I'll do that
---
Look how they massacred my boy!
---
Fair enough what killler do you main ?
---
Unless you're in voice chat or running Bond, by the time you find another survivor to heal you, you could already be fully healed and working on a generator with Self Care.
---
Well it’s not like I can pick the ranks I want to go against
---
I was expecting 3 gens to pop after you downed meg or smth, but this is better.
---
Doesn't sound like a big issue to me. You can't find the Claudette, you leave. Claudette unhooks, you go back to get both. 
---
I should have mentioned that of course there would be a limit of, dunno, 20m to get the penalty? The killer doesn't need to go to the other side of the map to stop the timer,  just to give the surv a fair chance of not going down immediately.
---
Dude. Being top tier doens't mean he has to be the highest of the list. Spirit is also top tier but she isn't on the same tier as Nurse.
---
Thats entirely a reason to DC for me. I'll sit through a 4 man blendette SWF with flashlights, toolboxes and insta heals but the only thing keeping the game at a decent pace is that totem so when thats gone in 5 seconds so am i.
---
Perfect troll build, except it tells the killer your plan so you'll never get slugged to use any of the perks.
---
Then you send em a message and they call you trash. It's the circle of DBD
---
Yea exactly, it surprising when you hear about it, but as soon as you use it, it works great! I'm gonna try that with hag :)
---
Oh wow, how suddenly civil. That came out of literally nowhere. Lib owned 😎
---
If you want a good build then have monitor and abuse, Tinkerer, and then 2 of your choosing ,I use nurses calling and Im all ears.
---
Okay. It didn’t occur to me that Self Care isn’t usually necessary if you play with a friend. I try to be conscious of my team and be a team player, so my current load out (only level 34) is Sprint Burst, Kindred (next up to be replaced), Unbroken, Borrowed Time. 
---
Sprint burst for the obvious, Kindred for my team to see harder to see enemies if they camp me or are placing traps. Unbroken is kinda in flux for me, but I generally get a good use out of it once ever 5-8 games. Borrowed Time is good for anyone really but I hope I’m not sandbagging people when I use it. 
---
Is the above a decent set up for team play? Like I said Kindred is the only one I’m actively looking at replacing.
---
He does. The whole time.
---
I hate being that one guy that used all his cakes and is trying to get more.
---
Wow
---
Ah for sure, my first main was Bubbha so  I know how you feel, I didn't even see your username when I commented XD
---
Im in the middle of trying different builds but that has given me 4k's everygame at rank 10
---
For me? Catching up isn't the problem, catching up will eventually happen. The problem is how outright hostile people are to others trying to learn the game or whoever does something the other side doesn't like. It feels like veterans don't WANT new players.
---
I didnt say the game isnt more but you shouldn't de rank for doing good. Could you imagine in any other game doing really well and being punished for it? It's on survivors to not let this happen. Just like survivors shouldn't de rank if they rush gens and nobody dies because killer is potato.
---
No definitely Kate.
---
I enjoy his power recharge time and survivor marked time add-ons. The more he can use his power, the better, so any add-on that increases the recharge rate is pretty nice. 
---
One of the downsides of Ghost Face is that he only has a limited time to get the instadowns once the survivor is exposed, and he is very susceptible to looping. So some anti-loop perks like Enduring, Spirit Fury, and maybe Bamboozle or Brutal Strength will help get his one shot off more often by powering through loops. 
---
Although, I've been insanely enjoying I'm All Ears on him. Someone vaults in a Chase, and depending on the loop, you can either use your power to erase your red stain and see exactly which direction they go, no mindgaming required. Or if you don't have his power up it helps you mindgame more efficiently.
---
It’s strange. Before the ghost-face update I had instant queues. Now I have instant survivor queues which honestly I’m not too pissed about because I’m a survivor main.
---
Fair enough aha
---
I think BBQ has only ever been in the shrine once since it came out so for quickness sake I would say just level up Bubba
---
Top tier means they're in the highest tier, right? Spirit can't be both top tier and also a tier below nurse.
---
Aight fine I’ll use my collection of ebony Moris if you want us to to use our offerings more
---
Dwights with cosmetics other than his basic ones and maybe bloody ones

Why can’t it be both?

---
I have multi switches just like that for the same overhead light in my house.   It's all about giving me the ability to turn the light on or off based on which doorway I'm coming through.
---
Typically seen in a hallway or staircase.
---
Anybody else notice the inhaler? Or is that just me it has a blue background and it’s middle area
---
I really don't care about waiting in a lobby. I like to browse reddit in the meantime and do other stuff. I'd rather browse reddit than get tilted to oblivion in 5 minutes by a 4man.
---
I think the devs said around the time they removed the Hillbilly flick, (which was when you could move left and right at the end of your charge and the hitbox would be active for a half second or so) it might come back as an addon or something.
---
I'd love for it to come back. I wasn't around for it but I heard it was hella fun and made 360'ing survivors easier to hit, and you could do absolutely insane shit like notice a survivor hiding behind a tree in front of you, chainsaw past him, and right before you sprint past him, stop and turn to hit him, hit people around corners, etc.
---
Turret: hello. Are you still there
---
I can't grab the damn rare chess without me coming closer.
---
Depends on the survivor. Some wanna taunt you, some just wanna give you free hits. Especially during events when killers have long ass queue times people often offer free hits. Only takes a small amount of time and there are usually BP multipliers in play.
---
not sure why people are so scared of SWF anymore. 
---
Its not as strong as it used 2 be and its good practice most of the time. People like to paint High rank 4 man swf like its constant call outs and sweat the entire game
---
But me and my friends are red and purple ranks and we just tell jokes and play the game
---
You are completely right, the fact that you are getting downvoted is mind boggling
---
Everytime I got a 4man, they usually genrush and BM every single time they have the chance to do so.
---
Drop a pallet -&gt; Tbag
---
Vault a window -&gt; Tbag

Not to mention when they open the exit gates and wait as long as they can just so they can keep pressing their almighty control buttons.

this might be unpopular but I’m personally tired of farming every time I see a lot of cakes being used; if killer queues weren’t long as hell right now I wouldn’t care, but sometimes I just want to play a normal game - I still get to play something and I get extra points
---
Good soldiers follow orders!
---
Once a teachable is unlocked via the character’s bloodweb or the shrine of secrets, it stays unlocked even if the character it came from prestiges
---
Because Kate is louder.
---
Hi Carl!
---
Yes but there are swf that use parties to their advantage say one of them find your hex ruin one finds it everyone knows where it is and therefore you’re not going to be able to keep everyone off it also they tell each other where your traps are as trapper or even tell them your location so they know if you’re coming or not
---
You kind of just proved his point though, adrenaline needs a perfect situation to work. All you did was offer one of those situations.
---
I had an infinite Myers one game that I'm pretty sure I fed all my soul cause I was afk came back trying to figure out who the killer thinking it was ghostface ran toward him to pull out of stalk and then halloween jingle pops up
---
I thought she was the entity
---
Ohthen come as close as you like
---
Wait how is this DBD related.
---
Well don't tell anyone OK?
---
The big marshmallow man?
---
I know this joke is used so much to the point where it’s pretty much dead but....
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
&gt; with bond u can see people in lockers injured or not. 
---
nope you cant. Lockers block all aura reading. and the second applys for empathy too, since you dont waste time on a gen when the killer is near.
---
Wow! Top tier fan content! Extremely well made, full of humor!
---
You are using no homo wrong, and probably too much at that.
---
Can't even buy a map.
---
I mean there is not much they can do about it, you can't Nerf swf into the ground bc then the playerbase will die.  The main reason you only see SWF now is bc how bad solo survivor is currently. They wanted to nerf SWF but nerfed the entirety of survivor inested
---
stick n stones
---
i get that it can be frustrating, but they're just mindgaming you. They're trying to make you mad so that you make a mistake. don't fall for it!

GF?

This is actually pretty common. You'll usually see this on staircases, where on switch is at the top and one is at the bottom. They allow you to turn on that one specific light no matter which side you're in. It's a little unnecessary with a room that small, but it's not uncommon for them to be placed next to each doorway when there's more than one entrance.
---
This is your electrician fact of the day.
---
This isnt support try contacting them directly...
---
What perks do you run on her to help find survivors?
---
What’s good Carl
---
No the best map pressure comes when you slug or hook people, because other survivors have to get off gens to come help.  If you know the rescuing survivor is already there and find them, then another survivor has to get off the gens to unhook.
---
Scenario 1: hooked survivor, chased survivor, rescuing survivor.  1 on gens.
---
Scenario 2: 1 injured survivor, 1 chased survivor, 2 on gens.
---
Get it?
---
How so? I didn't see anything particularly notable except not throwing himself at the hook if it's unsafe
---
I once brought a cypress and got a message after the game saying “lmao you got me sweaty for a cypress, gg”
---
what is this shit
---
a broken key with beads add-on
---
thank you so much!
---
Bill for me is always very trivial for chase. when i play killer It's mostly the P3 Claudette that i think will be good.
---
Give me Steve Harrington and the Demogorgon, you cowards. In all seriousness, Ash was ideal survivor and Freddy was my ideal killer. Having Steve would be amazing though!
---
If his luck is anything like mine, bbq will show on the shrine the rotation after buying the dlc, lmao
---
Is this bug caused by something? From my understanding it's not the survivors fault, and they cant do anything, so why not go and help someone off the hook if you're still counted as in the game?
---
if you use it you gotta play meyers^(2)
---
It astonishes me how much they can break the game with their updates. I havent even played the Ghostface chapter yet cause of all the problems, it ain't worth it right now lol
---
Yeah o was confused at first aswell
---
And then, there is me, the injured Dwight who tries to save you but gets himself hooked and killed with you because I forgot to run burrowed time.
---
That would be awesone
---
On the flip side, ruin is fun to run with haunted ground.... i’m sure you can see where that is going, roulette time!
---
Billy is perfect the way he is atm, but some addons should appear more than others, I keep getting shitty addons.
---
I'm not prestige 1 and I dont think like to get it, the rate is too low to waste all the perks of the game, plus I use many cosmetics on him...
---
Hillbilly is def a high top tier, just like Nurse and Spirit.
---
Her fucking screams are the WORST and literally one of the main reasons I don't play her often. It's like someone took her damn voice and chipmunked it or something.
---
someone downv oted me because i got scared?? 😂 anyways, yeah, i haven’t played since he was released and was like shoot, played myself not looking him up beforehand!
---
Yea hes trash. Imo Freddy is better and really not even that bad with the right build! Tru3 plays a ton of legion, he uses his ability to see where survivors are once and awhile but he mostly just m1s and mind games people. Might as well just play doc, same thing but instead of a bleed out timer that never works you get to fuck with the survivors a little :)
---
Maybe I dont play her enough to understand but isnt it bad to add more blinks cause you stay fatigued longer?
---
one to the left is ruin, right is haunted grounds
---
I'm a noob what's noed
---
Funny joke!
---
You do have some valid points there I also might add that I do like what they did with plague with the whole risk reward thing it’s something different and definitely a step in the right direction
---
I already know this is about to happen to me. This is actually all I've been thinking about
---
And/ or they could add the gas station from the Texas chainsaw massacre as a possible area in the autowrecker map.
---
I hooked someone in basement then waited haha
---
Michel tires up is actually such a fantastic fucking pun
---
Incredible meme 😂👌
---
You'd be correct, 5 blinks is a relic of a time when we didnt know the true meta. Range addons is what you really want, but that doesnt stop us from making multiblink memes.
---
Oh I get it perfectly. What I don't get is why, if you re really incapable of finding someone who you know is there in more than 20 secs, why won't you just walk to the edge of the penalty zone and reset the timer. At this point, one of two things happen.
---
1 - Claudette saves, you chase. Good chance of downing.
---
2 - Claudette doesn't save, she s wasting even more time and you re free to pressure someone else.
---
I shall stop here, I don't think I have more elaboration to give to my point, I'm just interested in having you guys read it and spreading the message.
---
Well to be fair playing against an ebony is just an awful experience and I rather take the L quickly and move on to the next game.
---
*^I'm ^doing ^my ^part!*
---
It’s happened to me before as well, freaked me out.
---
But honestly, even with my rank 13 on killer I just realised that it’s easier just to not respect palets and to just smash them
---
Imagine a legion with nurse’s calling and monitor &amp; abuse sneaking up on survivors while they’re mending. The survivors leave a blood trail that legion can easily track without sloppybutcher or bloodhound. It would be an unfun tunneling mess for survivors as it was before.
---
He is deeply flawed but this isn’t the solution.
---
I have all dlc, but I started leveling Laurie chode specifically for ds, but after I started doing that, it showed on the shrine and I was like “oh, cool, I guess i’ll level meg than”
---
I remember how one time during a game survivors started appearing and the players list was so long the end of it was no longer on the screen.
---
I normally wait near the hooked survivor so that the killer leaves but then they dc because they think I’m not saving them or something, but people who just sit there and don’t save at all deserve to have one less team mate
---
Ruin, BBQ, Haunted ground and a 4th flexible perk. Rancor/noed or something.
---
I doN't have struggle finding survivors at all with her.
---
Monitor&amp;Abuse is good on her too, but sadly I don't have that one.
---
She didn't know I had noed. She was the sole survivor to get a gen and open an exit gate so props to her. But she didn't guess the noed. She said "im stupid" at the end of the match.
---
I had a stroke reading that, but i fugured out wjat ya meant
---
It's not tunneling if he used his frenzy, it's tracking. The survivor has to be unhooked to be tunneled. OPs suggestion helps tracking after first hit but I agree it's not the right solution
---
Dont see how devour hope is toxic. You have plenty of warning and many chances to get rid of it.
---
legion is fine, his ability to injured everyone is good, now if u dont heal against a legion with Monitor and abuse, ur gonna have a bad time, Try him with: STBFL, Spirit Fury, Enduring and BBQ
---
Sprint Burst is a good starting exhaustion perk because of its reliability. As you gain experience and grow your situational awareness, you will want to swap it for something like Balanced Landing or Lithe so that you can run whenever you want.
---
Kindred is only useful you're playing alone and it relies on your random teammates being both aware and altruistic. I've found that it doesn't really help the "somebody else can get them" mentality of many randoms have. It does counter camping, but it counters camping in a way that kills the person running the perk.
---
Unbreakable can be a game changer if you get slugged and nobody is around to pick you up. That doesn't happen to me very often, but it might for you.
---
Borrowed Time is a top tier perk that guarantees safe unhook points. I never leave home without it. You do still need to be careful to not screw over other survivors, but it gives them a much better chance at getting away safely than if you didn't have it.
---
It's okay to be close to the hook for a quick save *once the killer leaves* but running and leaving tracks for the killer to see when he hasn't even hooked the person?! That's just... wow, that's not even trying. Lmao.
---
When did I ever say you can't tunnel?  What are you talking about?
---
I have pretty good luck as him. He slows down the game, and can put a lot of pressure in small areas.
---
Tried, I don’t like him nearly as much.
---
I know hes great but it would be good to change him up besides the way we play him now.
---
Heyyy Carl I love you alot
---
I love when survivors run from pallet to pallet dropping them when there's still 5 gens and ruin. I've recently made it to rank 8 and rank 5 survivors still do it :P
---
This may be my least favorite image I've ever seen
---
Only play immersed if you are dead on hook. Otherwise you are going to get your teammates killed.
---
tell that to the killers i go against who completely ignore the farmer :)
---
Punishing campers would ruin the game
---
How can someone label a perk toxic? What the fuck does toxic even mean anymore?
---
Gotta be the ace mains
---
Unfortunately for you killers being an "unfun tunneling mess" is a core component of a good half of the roster. Billy, Huntress, Myers, GF, Bubba ect.
---
I was once caught at an exit gate right before the escape wall, but because I was being chased out and not being toxic. That day went really bad just from that one game. If I had one more second of speed boost from getting lunges at I would’ve escaped, and this brought back bad memories of that. This one is funnier though
---
"Fuck you I got mine!"
---
Fucking plunders and post nerf mom ARE YOU OKAY
---
Legit had someone call it a “crutch perk” in a previous game. Some people will label anything that gets them killed as toxic
---
Ace flair checks out.
---
No One Escapes Death, it’s the one where if all gens are done then a dull totem gets activated and you can down people in one hit... and you get a slight speed boost
---
I’m imagining a village of Bubbas
---
We are just missing one...
---
I mean I've done is forever whenever there is bloodpoints bonuses
---
BM = bowel movement. He shit on him.
---
Great! I try so often yet always fail...
---
Idk about survivors, but I take 5 to 10 mins to create a lobby as killer, It pissed me off.
---
Anyone calling any perk where you need to get 5 tokens, especially how devour gathers tokens, a “crutch perk”, is just special
---
Happens to me every time honestly
---
Okay, sounds about how I’ve felt. Kindred is the one I’m looking to swap. I just haven’t found what I want yet. I was thinking Spine Chill because of how often I’ve been fucked by ghost face recently. Thanks for the help. Great community considering the game is about murdering each other and deciding whether or not it’s worth it to save people lmao.
---
Wut, ever hear of Spirit Fury? Pop goes the weasel? Bamboozle, Rancor? We got a ton of perks for both sides, and a couple builds have been improved from it also
---
I've gotten 4K's against purple and red ranks with black splinters.

Survivors: I lost a chase, therefore the killer is toxic.
---
Flipside
---
This one actually happened: I was using a flashlight, terribly, and this killer got me down and just continued to nod until I bled out. His reason was that flashlights are toxic but him looking at me and nodding wasnt.
---
You are oh you don't like the word homo? Jesus what wrong with you and you dislike compliments.... Weird...
---
I have 14 on Ghost Face, idk why but almost every web gives me one, I now only get them if they are in the way to my other perks I want. I also have about 30 cakes and have been using 1 every game!
---
just like the simulation
---
XD

The point of legion's power is to hit multiple survivors and waste time with the deep wound timer. If all survivors are mending then they are not doing gens. Mending does not heal a health state so I wouldn't consider it healing. I don't think it counts for nurses calling for that reason.You have to think about borrowed time too, since it uses the same bleed out timer and it wouldn't be fair for it to show on nurses because the point of BT is to deal with tunneling/camping. Legion isn't supposed to just continually hit one survivor over and over. Franks mixtape and cold dirt were really frustrating to play against and contradicts legions power of hitting multiple survivors. I think thats why they made those changes to help push players into hitting multiple survivors.  I see where you're coming from because its much easier to secure a down by trailing one survivor and if you want to play that way I suggest using cool down add ons so you can catch up easily after the stun timer.  At the end of the day legion's power was meant to be spread around to buy time and thats why its feels clunky/weird to focus on one survivor.
---
PC - doesn't show the exit gates fading off into the distance as you escape and run away into the night anymore. Fades to black after you leave then fades back. That was cool - now it's gone. Game atmosphere suffers more and it reminds you you're in a game with all these unnatural fades. Changed for performance issues?
---
I bet they accused you of camping too
---
Well... the lore we’re given only references the original. No mention of the events of H2, H20, H2018, etc. So the only movie canon to DBD is the original.
---
I hope this shitpost was worth it, spend an hour and a half on it.
---
When you hook someone the killer takes a step back
---
Nice, now your broken key can be broken for 15 seconds longer! Bruh moment
---
Nah, my sweet dream is to have a game where a 4k doesn't De-rank you because everyone got downed in 1minute 40 secs. They really shouldn't penalize killers for being too good. Imagine if the survivors somehow got a game done in 3 mins, they get shit tons of points.
---
 This community has an unhealthy amount of these people and i hate it
---
PC- the perk Infectious Fright works weirdly when you’re on a generator. Your character will scream, but they won’t do the screaming animation until you let go of the generator, at which point they’ll do the animation without the scream.
---
I played a couple games as killer this morning, took no longer then a couple minutes, NA  East PS4
---
Yeah, it's what they become after the entity stabs them.
---
That's something entirely different. Chasing people out the gate whilst others are not in the clear is still part of the game and a tactical effort on both sides.
---
But if you're the last survivor, or in the group of last survivors all standing in front of the exit (and not grabbin the last healing points either), that's just annoying.
---
As in her being stupid right? Cause that was great on you
---
This happens to me once awhile ago. I also got stuck in a wall once. I think I’m just good at accidentally breaking the game
---
Eastenders (British Soap)
---
Doe this make Claudette a goomba?
---
Not quite, old legion went above and beyond those when it came to tunneling. That’s why changes were made.
---
I think they should reverse the one hit in frenzy thing. It would give more ways to play. You could hit one guy then go for another or like I'd do, I'd stab the first guy multiple times until my meter ran out. It wouldn't hurt them anymore but it would be funny as hell to keep stabbing the same person. It is called frenzy but seems more like a Sprint burst as it is.
---
Wait til that killer gets to rank 9ish (he probs won't:p) I spend about half the game blinded and rely on my ears on a big screen TV :p I have games where I get blinded at every pallet and window I break or vault. Franklin's Demise &lt;3
---
That’s your best friend anyways! As a killer I love the immersed, self caring solo players. They never help their team. It’s the Dwight in PJs that can loop like a madman.
---
F
---
Not for another month, at least.
---
If you're using gmail, check your promotions folder. It went there instead of my inbox.
---
A survivor
---
I want Jason in this game so freak’n badly!! With all of his skins too, and the survivors could get camp counselor outfits!
---
Maybe. It's a tough sell to ask your opponent, whose success is already based on taking advantage of your team's mistakes, to handicap themselves by not taking advantage of your team's mistakes.
---
probably want to see if it makes it to a forum post...idk
---
Just report them and move on
---
Not using gmail. Is it only for america or is the pre-register worldwide?
---
Because they suck and can't handle the truth, so they have to find someone else to blame.
---
seems like all the kids are out of school.
---
It could be used by aggressive survivors or a counter to tunneling that the survivor is in control of as opposed to hoping someone has Borrowed Time.  Either way, it still doesn't make all gens one shot and increase your movement speed, there's no comparison when it comes to NOED vs old MoM (nerfed btw).
---
Well at the same time, there are situations where I will jump behind cover and the reveal will happen right as i get behind the object so it kinda goes both ways i guess
---
Don't record like this killer
---
It's a bugged lobby lol if you really waited 2 hours you're crazy and i feel bad for you lol if you see this happen, leave immediately the lobby will never fill the lobby thinks it's full but it's not
---
"Gotcha bitch!"
---
I guess it does, oh well. It is what is
---
r/instantkarma
---
the spirit then proceeds to facecamp the claudette as in endgame
---
Yeah i'd say it's balanced enough. From my experience either side can get cucked in a ghostface game lol
---
Leveled, not unlocked, I have all dlc I just level survivors more
---
Massive brain fart while typing
---
Wait id the chest in the basement considered better?
---
That's when you invite the killer to discord and get the blendette killed
---
Because killers stomp solo squads. One mistake from a survivor can throw the match for their entire team. Then killers rank up and get matched against experianced SWF teams that are making fewer, if any, mistakes. Suddenly the game is a challenge and its "whaaaaa survivor OP."
---
Reading posts on this sub is like Schrödinger's Killer: Somehow survivors are crazy OP and yet simultaneously all killers still get 3 and 4ks every game.
---
i believe there isn't a survivor 'perfect' for starting, but i truly think the difficulty each character has in their description is the best way to base your opinion on if you're switching mains. for example, i would suggest you switch to either claudette, meg, or dwight. their perks are pretty easy to understand and useful for starting to learn how the game works.
---
sure, nea has some good perks most survivor mains have or try to get, but you might want to get at least a good set of teachables before trying to switch to nea (or really just any survivor you want to main). i hope that makes sense!
---
He has a side job doing auto repair when he's not murdering everything
---
Everyone does.
---
which mea you shouldn't keep your trap for endgame 'cause using them after all gens are done is useless.
---
Wait, you're telling me that if you cleanse all the dull totems, NOED *won't* activate?? Let's spread the word, I don't think this is common knowledge tbh.
---
Surprised she didn't dc
---
*Because then I can’t get my 4K by walking away, entering a building, trapping every entrance, and letting their ego take care of the rest*
---
Yeah those are some really chump ass players. Like someone has a real vendetta if they choose to hook camp at the very start.
---
Nah that would break his power. Take solace in the fact that you keep your healing progress when you're wounded.
---
Ffs I KNOW. Its just stupid.
---
Yeah I did, maybe I was just unlucky enough to get the bug 3 times in a row but y’know
---
You're hired
---
It should be, noed requires a dull totem to be on the map to light up and activate, naturally if it doesn’t have one, it won’t
---
Unless you’re being sarcastic in which case consider me bamboozled
---
I mean you may have a higher chance of receiving a good item.
---
Bro these are my favorite messages to get. I just say let me know how your vacation is. 80% of the time they say what. Then I send a question mark and they can’t reply cuz I reported the message on psn lol
---
Im not asking for a reversion to old legion, im asking for changes to legions deep wounds because they don't actually help or have a purpose.
---
the absolute counter to Barbecue &amp; Chilli
---
I'd say now is the best time to use them as it's more likely other people will also offer them since it's still the event.
---
No its not? You have to position it right?
---
Oh shit they've picked up a new recruit
---
This. Specially if there is a streamer in their team they will do everything to save him/her.
---
And then you will get 4k and they will blame you for camping, tunneling, etc.

---
None of those perks counter NOED.
---
Mettle of Man is a cheeky perk and was poor design. The update to it makes it pretty niche and weak. It never countered NOED, it countered everything before.
---
Sprint Burst is funny. That doesn’t counter anything except maybe Wraith and Pig.
---
Decisive doesn’t counter NOED because you have to be taken off a hook for it to activate. And that’s where NOED shines... killing people trying to save from the hook.
---
I don’t think NOED is overpowered or unbalanced, it’s just poorly designed as is. It rewards killers for losing and punishes survivors for winning. It’s backwards game psychology. A novel idea could be combine NOED and Ruin. NOED could slow gen progression (very slightly!) for every dull totem, then if a dull is left on the map it lights up and gives the 1 hit down effect OR the speed effect.
---
Even at rank 1 the one killer I never know if I should just use everything within my reach is a Leatherface. They either camp or they’re actually respectable boos, but most of them... oh god.
---
But yeah, watching people not skipping pallets and creating deadzones kills me. Literally.
---
Probably the same dumbass that spells it Tires!
---
I think that Spirit may have been me... wasn’t expecting to see me here.
---
I like the idea but I think it might be too op? I would love it but survivors would complain about it too much.
---
If it is, you shit me up good hahah
---
It usually happens when someone in the lobby leaves and the lobby thinks they never left, but to get it 3 times in a row is crazy
---
Well shit, might as well go point to a hook and accept my fate
---
I ain't 'fraid of no ghost (*face™)
---
Its literally a bloody stab wound that causes mass internal bleeding. Thats what deep wounds is. It makes no sense that you can mend it without a medkit or without nurses triggering. Right now the idea for how to play legion based off of frenzy is you run the survivors in a carousel: hit one survivor, locate the next with KI and hit them. But in the time it takes to locate the other survivor and hit them, the wounded survivor can mend deep wounds and get back to doing a gen. After they're hit ONCE they can't even be hit again because it causes a stun for legion and also causes the irrelevant DW timer to shrink down. Needing a medkit would actually make DW a threat.
---
Yeah, I may try a different character. It’s just I felt that deliverance is a very good perk
---
Just saw the name, definitely me. Sorry about that, let me know if you need new underwear or something.
---
Ok cool but when did I specifically say that in the discussion we're having right now?
---
Alexa play U Got That
---
Xbox:sometimes while your in a round you cannot use certain perks or actions. Ex:healing (selfheal and Medkits) (works on teammates but cannot be done on yourself) Dead Hard notification not popping up at the bottom and possibly some other perks (from what has happened to me though was just problems with those two actions/perks)
---
"Camp and Tunnel Bad :\^l "
---
Leatherface too
---
The actual solution is to change ruin and just make generators take longer by like 8 seconds for each colored rank bracket.
---
To a skilled survivor ruin is meaningless, especially against swf groups that can say where they checked for totems. Versus unskilled players its devastating, and gives a mid rank killer a free win because mid to r20 rank survivors are not able to handle ruin and the killer gets all the time in the world unless a surv stumbles upon ruin.
---
Furthermore, ruin is inconsistent with lag and other issues. Not only does it revert progress,  but with a shitty host it can add several seconds to start making progress again, whereas on a stable connection progress begins again almost immediately. Maybe dedicated servers will resolve this issue, but ruin still needs to be changed.
---
In my opinion, ruin should be like third seal, where it only starts working after you hit a survivor, and persist until they perform 1/2/3 hex skill checks. This nerfs grab spirit (imo spirit is fine its just spirit beads that are strong) and insta billy who dominate red ranks (but obviously doesnt do anything against nurse because nurse is inherently broken and genuinely needs to be looked at by the devs) and is an indirect buff to M1 killers. Furthermore it devalues 'gen tapping' because a surivor can actually remove the hex effect without going totem hunting. Hex Perks like huntress' lullaby, ruin, third seal, etc should then also not even exist on the map until their effect actually begins, letting killers get a breath of fresh air not worrying about losing their perks in 10 seconds at the start of the game and also making smashing dull totems more valuable as a survivor, giving killers running no totems more time inderectly, and making it less obvious what hexes you are up against until the midgame as survivor.
---
Every high level surivor hates ruin every game, but understands it as needed because of the speed of the game. Every killer hates ruin because its a mandatory perk and ruins fun and build diversity
---
More like a week ago
---
"So, what do you wanna do?"
---
"I dunno, totem stuff?"
---
;)
---
Looks like a SWF, so it does make sense, because it takes the average rank and tries to match the group to a killer with a similar rank to that average. Matchmaking worked as intended here.
---
Reminder that if you're not tunneling you're gettig no closer to eliminating a survivor from the game and therefore playing wrong
---
I use ruin,BBQ, monitor,and nurses calling.
---
One of the greatest shitposts I've ever seen. Well done.

Description: With The Plague, while playing against or using. Her vile purge when vomited on window frames stays there infinitely. Never goes away and will also have the same effect on pallets and generators. Using no add ons and  matter what the map is or window vault location. Seen it stay on gens and pallets a hand full of times infinitely.
---
Are you high? Have you played the game? Scavengers can easier outmaneuver and avoid hunters if they know what they’re doing.
---
*Once the exits gates are opened
---
They would definitely complain about it just as much as people complain about a certain color of head huntress has, lmao
---
Its better than the people who loop the killer right next to you
---
Damn, slugged the whole team
---
Don’t you just hate it when Michel tires up SMH.
---
It’s just the community sadly
---
I totally forgot about iridescent heads but the devs wouldn’t implement it because they’re scared of making killers viable.
---
*David  screams on other side of map*
---
To be honest though, I kinda would accept amanda getting an iridescent head equivalent for her dash attack after her endgame pressure got absolutely fucked
---
I try not to unlock ebony moris, I always feel bad for using the mori not sure why I just feel dirty. And then when I want to prestige it feels like a waste when I have them but don't use them :(
---
An underground sewer complexion like the Amnesia levels.
---
I would too she needs some sort of compensation and plus like you said her addons are worthless I’m pretty sure 65% of them are useless.
---
Meg: This is fine.
---
The glitch can't be reproduces, it's completely random and often works to the benefit of the killer because they die to egc
---
Got this from my Twitter I posted all the way back in June of 2016
---
Personally, I play the way I want to
---
Yea not a fan of the stupid rules people try to impose on other people regarding whatever they want to call toxic. It's like when you're playing a fighting game and your 10 year old nephew doesn't want you to use a move cause it's "cheap" lmao
---
I hope that the Killer was named Bowser
---
Yep, more traps are useless cause no activate during endgame, anything dash speed or whatever is slightly helpful, but dash is shit for chases, jigsaw box addons are decent-ish, but I’ve rarely even see people die to RBT unless they are extremely unlucky, especially since the timer stops when amanda is chasing you. Piggy changes would be so amazing, even something as simple as the timers not stopping when she is chasing you would make her traps *so* much more viable
---
Hit decisive strike skillcheck, but it's already hooking animation so DS doesn't work :/
---
I understand that is an injury I'm just saying in game it functions as a timer and not as healing.Requiring a med kit would be too much. I think skill checks like OP mentioned or an external factor like needing to find an interactive object like plagues fountain or pigs jigaw boxes would be more appropriate than requiring a med kit. I think it would be more interesting than stand still and push guts back in lol
---
Don't get upset over someone that has nothing better to do then say terrible things over a game. They  are a bunch of morons that are pathetic, and you sir are a lot better than them. :)
---
I don't mind this build at all, until overcharge gets replaced with ruin then it's just mean.
---
sometimes they genuinenly know there's people around though. i've accidentally camped hooks because i saw scratch marks nearby but couldnt find the survivor until after a while
---
I saw your comment yesterday and I wanted to come back and thank you. I gave Alert a try and I’m loving it.
---
An interactable would be too easy for Legion to just play around, but skill checks make more sense i feel.
---
not to be rude... but do u really think this post is funny?
---
That was the case with hatch standoffs too
---
Fuck the ranks. Fuck the made up rules this idiotic community creates. I join a match to massacre everyone with any means necessary. Because that's fun. :)
---
Question, why do you care? their not functional. You should complain about that first, if anything.
---
Start with Meg and Claudette, both have 3 useful teachables you'll want in your bloodwebs. The rest of the free starting characters all have at least 1 useful teachable as well.

The thing is, DbD needs you to learn a lot of things and spend time just to stop being a burden for your team. Inability to communicate with teammates during matches doesn't help. So this shit is kind of expected.

Replace Overwhelming presence with Sloppy Butcher or pop goes the weasel if you have it, or NOED if you want to get them as triggered as possible.
---
OWP doesn't do a whole lot for you, the rest of the build is pretty solid though.
---
You should be using the add on to make invisible pallets and up the madness gained from your shock aura though if you're trying to run impossible skill check doctor.
---
why did this make me laugh so hard
---
wheres my shirtless mookel ?
---
What does swf mean
---
Nah fuck people suggesting exploits.  The rudeness was warranted.
---
I was thinking of replacing overwhelming with sloppy, or maybe coulrophobia if I ever get it
---
All these comments are fairly decent but the absolute best way to prepare and not be a burden on your team is to watch streamers. Some streamers are dedicated towards educated novice players on the game
---
Imagine that with monitor and abuse
---
My ps4 name is rugged_noose just send me a friend request bud
---
The definition of every rank reset
---
I mean, it still does.  You don't know always know if someone's there or not, and sometimes you have no choice but to try to secure your kill on the hook.
---
Radius is fairly good but you want to make the aura do a lot more.  Drop the one that shows the aura's for the one that makes your aura give madness faster, trust me.  You already get a fairly good idea of where they are unless they're running Calm Spirit with the big call out circle when their madness goes up already.
---
Doctor shocks block survivors from performing actions. It blocks these actions for 3 seconds:
---
Vaulting
---
Using Dead Hard
---
Dropping Pallets
---
Unhooking people
---
Getting into lockers
---
Shocks also *interrupt* these actions:
---
Repairing generators
---
Healing
---
Snapping out of madness
---
Cleansing totems
---
Its the greatest mystery in all the cosmos...
---
His ability exists to give you a free instant hit into injured state on whoever you're chasing.  If others are close you can tag multiple people and really slow their games down mending and healing.  Even if noone else is around you get to chase an injured survivor with 115 speed instead of a healthy survivor.  His ability isn't nearly as bad as you claim.  I've had some really strong games with him post rework.
---
Dang I’m sorry for that, I have no clue then 🤷‍♂️
---
Replace distressing with franklins. Destroy those items.
---
we are talking about pre-nerf MoM right?
---
At rank 1 that’s a de-rank. Enjoy!
---
That's the same perk build I run, but I replaced Overwhelming with BBQ. The overwhelming presence (faster item consumption) is pretty underwhelming. 
---
I run BBQ there but if I'm feeling especially toxic I'll replace it with Franklin's, Ruin, Dying Light, Rancor, NOED, etc. depending on my mood. 
---
Also you should try running purple and yellow calm addons with a jigsaw piece for the ultimate "Fuck survivors" experience.
---
Ok
---
I see this response a lot. Just know that accepting this argument here means that it's valid everywhere, whether it's 4 man SWF switching to purple flashlights and T-bagging at every pallet, a brand new parts gen rushing squad, or someone killing themselves on the hook as soon as they are caught. If there is no problem with you playing the way you want, then there is no problem with anyone else doing the same.
---
Survive with friends
---
Oh, I normally see this from the other perspective. :(
---
Hahaha
---
Doc's levels of madness don't really do anything until madness tier 3.
---
Survivors in Tier 3 madness can't work on generators.
---
Whenever they see a doctor hallucination, you see the aura of the hallucination.
---
Hallucinations in all tiers will appear and face the survivor, so you know which direction they're going.
---
You are faster in attack mode, not shock mode. So when you start the game, maybe stay in attack mode to move places since survivors won't start nearby for you to shock.
---
What qualifies as a "break" action for alert?
---
Actually pretty well made.
---
Fucking unplayable
---
-Dead hard doesn't even work half the time, and is countered by multiple perks and killers
---
-Self Care has been nerfed several times, and is countered by multiple perks
---
-Adrenaline Heals you once, and it happens at random if it even happens, and its also countered by noed.
---
-WGLF is dogshit. It's essentially an empty perk slot, and has probably killed more survivors then freddy has.
---
A stealthy killer who is actually not stealthy because hie clothes are noisy. Sounds kinda dumb to me
---
I had one person do something like that to me once. I was hooked in the basement, killer nowhere in sight, and they were waiting for hatch. I unhooked myself(this was well before deliverance so I was SHOCKED) and when the killer came back, I led him to the other person. They went down, ended up in the basement, and I sat there and teabagged the hatch. I guess killer saw it when he found the other person, so he found me and killed me, then called me all kinds of names for “leaving my teammate to die.” He disconnected before I could explain. 
---
I only stopped playing for two weeks lol
---
CAMPER!!!!
---
get out of here you camper
---
:P
---
oh it was
---
*Laughs in Small Game*
---
I hope people know this reference because it’s quality.
---
Yeah.. so I got this game 2 days ago because it was on sale. 
---
Last night, while trying to learn how to play a killer (and sucking at it), the survivors managed to open the exit gate before I so much as hooked one of them one time.  
---
One of them actually sent me a message, calling me a piece of shit and telling me how much I suck...
---
It's kind of amazing how shitty people can be.
---
FYI (as a player who played DbD in 2016), the bug occurred when a player has left the killer's match (after they have been sacrificed/killed) which left a spot free. Then people, who joined matchmaking, were occasionally transitioned towards the killer's host, which leads to this picture. Survivors, who joined into the killer's match, couldn't move or interact anything and were frozen. The bug continued until the game has crashed.
---
^MEMES
---
Well they made the game more about having fun and it lasting longer.. those type of matches are pointless to even load into, wait all that time just for it to end in 30 seconds...  boring...
---
Yea his looks really cool too!
---
Nice
---
Ohhh, I thought that might be it but wasn't sure. Thank you
---
Yeah well I'll not sit on gens when everyone else isn't frakking swarming the hook, especially before it's safe so everyone but the unhooker loses their altruism emblem.
---
The fact that now loopers get lightbringer but the inverse isn't true irks me. Whilst I don't want to see loopers stay at low ranks because they refuse to do the objective, I dislike how I'm not rewarded for doing the objective no-one else is. *I* can't even get lightbringer by looping because no-one else does the fucking gens.
---
It is because it is enabling bad systems with the internal logic of the statement. They are right of course, but people dislike that the 'right' way to play killer is to let bad players keep going even though you already should have 'won' by the standard most players consider winning.
---
Its killermains thinking the game should just be about killing as fast as you can without doing anything else.. why should you pip if you only hooked each person once and the game is over ? Nothing got done!
---
I had a game like this the other day, didn't realize it in the end ofc, It felt like I was the only serious person in a scary movie. Killer couldn't get me(mind game for days), Unhooked everyone, scoffed when someone went down after ages of not healing.
---
I know its a shitpost. But houses back in the 70's-80's did this ALOT.

You had to do it right? You just had to f'n ruin Ghostface right BHVR? I'm a 90% only survivor player and even I think Ghostface was perfect before. He was scary, he was unique and he was a f'n threat but he was still beatable just for the fact alone that many Ghostfaces can spend too much time with finding players and stalking them, so you can get a good heads-up with the gens. It was f'n fun to play against him now he's like everyone else. Boring.
---
Maybe he was trying to give you the hit?
---
Kicking a gen or damaging a pallet. This also includes chainsaw breaks.
---
And even if dead hard works, no killer will fall for it twice outside of rank 20.
---
Or, you get shocked, knocked down by an LMG, and executed in 2 minutes with NO recourse. Even in DBD, Killers need to get books first before mori’s. This game gives you a big middle finger if the hunter doesn’t want to stress about early game scavenger pressure. Sure there’s an EXP incentive to not do that, but players will do what they want.
---
What about hammerhead sharks? They are predators that sense miles around them in a 360 view, have a wide field of view like sheep, and never stop hunting and killing. It's like a nurse with Shadowborn ;)
---
Yeah, even though I have been doing my killer dailies, I have been trying to focus on getting the rest of the teachables for my survivors already so I can play perk roulette in the future.
---
Hey man. I’m sorry, I had thought you were calling me toxic and I got upset. I shouldn’t have reacted the way I did. Have a good day
---
*Laughs in Irridescent Button*
---
*Ends up on Lery's or Cornfield*
---
I played some games with and against him and every time i faced him he only got 1 kill and when i played him i also only got 1 kill most of the time (but that is probably because i am a complete shitter at the game). It just takes too long to fully expose a survivor. And one thing that bugs me is that downed survivors and hooked survivors can also break you out of your power.
---
FYI because it came up a few times. I indeed was wiggling all the time! As you can see on the ground but it completely bugged out and I could not wiggle after being grabbed
---
"I guide others to a treasure I cannot possess."
---
The game was fun when nobody knew how to play. Even a basic understanding of how the game works ruins it. To know how it works is to know how poorly designed it is. I miss when people thought wraith was OP and the game was somewhat scary.
---
I never tire of these kinds of videos.
---
The mori could be when he literally splits that person in half in Solent Hill 1(sorry, but I forgot the person's name, i haven't watched the movie in a while)
---
oh because last time I watched gameplay they could see people in lockers. No need to downvote :)
---
Literally what I'm wondering everyday
---
I'm with you, I wouldn't mind a free 400 points per hit
---
Yeah hes so good with a insta down chainsaw.. smh
---
yeah i agree, but old MoM took much less than the entire match to activate
---
More bloodpoints better emblem etc...that being said op played like a potato camping that pallet and deserved the down.
---
I feel this....
---
and he got the free points for hooking and sacrifice too! so generous :)
---
Just got back into the game and had a match this week as wraith since he is the only killer I have leveled. Went against a swf running 4 toolboxes. They gen rushed so hard but I hooked one as last gen finished. 2 of them run up and I got them with noed. Hook one more and the last guy runs up trying to pick up the downed claudette and I get him too. Felt so good especially cuz I just picked up noed on the blood web right before the match.
---
Do you boo boo... stay in rank 15 where you belong
---
You're gonna get alot of hate on this sub reddit for promoting. Just letting you know.
---
?
---
I decent nerf to noed would be to make it unequipable on the best killers. Nobody needs noed on nurse billy or spirit. If you have an IQ above room temperature you don't need it period.
---
Ya think so?
---
I could, but that’s not as fun.
---
What I like about franklin's demise is that usually ppl use flashlights and instaheals to be toxic, then u give them exactly the toxicity that they deserve.
---
But you’re twice as likely to get death
---
So right
---
Absolutely
---
God was like "Fuck it, just put his eyes wherever".
---
Free deliverance with borrowed time would be great for shithead campers
---
🤷🏻‍♀️ it’s gameplay
---
And there's sometimes that the item is so good, that they come back for it, free hook.
---
you could already be healed by a medkit, or just working on the generator to use adrenaline instead. Self care never ends good. Moral of the story is a medkit WILL ALWAYS be better
---
it's funny asf to watch low ranks play lmao, they just run and throw down every single pallet even when the killer isn't chasing them
---
Good job on the website!  
---
One suggestion - create a search function for the perks so you can see survivor / killer specific, or just look for one specifically.   
---
I love how you have all the specific changes on the website per character.
---
This picture of a cake sure is real
---
This is me. Got tired of my teammates getting tunneled, so I named myself "Get Small Gamed" and so many killers focused me after I'd cleansed all 5 totems. It was worth it.
---
Not bad. I'll put it next to "If the killer hooks the survivor once, he fucking dies". This would also fix the camping problem.
---
I was thinking like a desert with some junk for the longer pallet loops and some termite mounds for the very unsafe pallets. Structures can be made from something like sandstone or whatnot. A few savanna trees here and there. Hooks can be made from savanna tree wood. The map would be rather large, and the main structure would be a very large pyramid with moderate windows and pallets.
---
I play both Killer and Survivor and complaining about camping annoys me most of the time. This is probably the only time it camping bothers me. Unless you have someone in the basement and are playing Insidious Tum Tums or something like that
---
Yes, as long as you get 5 gens done. It helps any situation you are in after the gens are done.
---
But he didnt do anything but chainsaw 4 people once... those survivors handed him the game... you dont deserve to rankup by doing just minimum, those days are gone and I'm happy about it.
---
One of the best memes on this sub. Congrats. 🎉

The dumbass Claudette
---
My main argument against all this is that he assumes we would still just be limited to human ability. I think he forgets that survivors also have perks and items that are meant to level the playing field (albeit poorly)
---
I either have really sweaty games where I get 1 kill as him or a complete face roll 4K. Playing against him is the same way. I agree with the downed and hooked survivor thing to some extent, but I think that's to prevent camping.
---
Nurse is a "Crutch killer" for the SWF I put down last night.
---
It's the truth. You're doing nothing but rambling nonsense that makes bad players feel better about themselves. That in and of itself wouldn't be a problem, but those same bad players are taking to the forums and calling for balance changes based on their (and your) lack of skill.
---
Yeah, that shit is why I'm glad I'm on the PC. Close the chat bubble for post game match and NEVER have to worry about interacting with people again as long as I can stifle my curiosity. It sucks because it's a stupidly fun game; but people just can't be welcoming to new players and their bullshit creates more hostile players. 
---
I'd be willing to bet a LOT of incoming players facecamp or tunnel for the first time because of players teabagging and bodyblocking with the remaining three members of their group. I know that's the case for me and the the first time I facecamped was because I had caught up to some guy who was just teabag spamming behind every pallet.
---
That's the thing I get Franklins use totally when it comes to a full swf lobby of "items" just not when it is all flashlights.  If I saw what looks to be a full swf group with like 2 medkits a key and a flashlight then sure I'm going Franklin's all day.  But if all you're concerned about is flashlights Lightborn outperforms Franklins handily.  You're essentially immune to their bullshit.  Turns their flashlights into hand cosmetics for the match.
---

The real question is why haven't we attacked BHVR for making us wait this long? Our thirst must be quenched.
---
Really nice
---
Not everyone plays Doctor. But this hex perk is already overshadowed by Hex: The Third Seal, anyway.
---
God his mori is crap XD
---
Amazing idea, maybe the dash have more penalty time if you fail it, and maybe delete the fucking useless irisdecent note.
---
Some killers are just really really bad at the game and use farming toxic survivors as a sort of teamate to secure their kills.  It's sad but fairly common.
---
Adrenaline also started becoming more popular once the power shift happened. Who needed adrenaline when you had infinites, exhaustion cooldown while running, and how the old pallets were [vacuum and more pallets on map]?
---
I didn’t even see that Claudette by the book, wth 😂
---
Obvious solution: If the killer is chasing one or more survivor out through the gates or is nearby, then stand for a hit.
---
If you have no idea where they are, then leave.
---
Mostly just skins but perhaps it's just people use the skin that fits their playstyle?
---
Maybe it's coincidence?
---
Sounds great!
---
Being a bit sarcastic, but at rank 1/2/3 it’s very hard to pip. Probably not a pip depending on points.
---
BBQ and Streamers, ez bloopoints
---
Template is on my profile now.
---
I turned off messaging on PS4 after some salty survivors started spamming me during games, I’m talking over a dozen nasty messages per minute for the duration of the game. After a couple times of this happening I decided it wasn’t worth the trouble.
---
It’s based on “if you only used their perks, this is what their difficulty would be”.
---
Make the switch! I built my own pc so I can play two games. This is one of them lol
---
"Tell you what? You can start running and I'll *stab you in the back*."
---
and infinite loading screen
---
That's fine. Unfortunately that phrase is often used by people who want to justify their own actions, but don't believe others should be free to do the same. Most people who use it don't understand the weight of those words.
---
Difficulty of their Perks and the playstyle oriented around them.
---
Except for Claudette, thats EZ mode because of obvious reasons.
---
She just wanted to give you hit points maybe, but she didn't knew how to do it
---
True I play killer most of the time and was called a camper because I hooked one person in the basement and all three were immediately near the killer shack so one after another I downed them and started hooking them all 4 in the basement and get a message saying camper. And I’m like you all went towards the shack how tf am I camping when you’re all potato

*loughs in rankreset nurse*
---
Honestly the only killer who would really need NOED is Freddy because honestly Freddy players deserve that insta down so they can get one or two kills to at least safety pip
---
*Queue the reeeees over NOED*
---
But yeah, altruism has the highest kill count in this game.
---
That is a bad result for everyone involved though. Killers that are clearly too good for the rank they are in continue to stomp players below their skill level because they aren't being advanced by the games they easily win.
---
Yes. It counters him so hard that it feels like an exploit. I'm all for counters but Object of Depression removes his power.

THIS BULLSHIT... https://clips.twitch.tv/InventiveInterestingNoodleKappaClaus ARE HITBOXES THE SIZE OF THE GODDAMN MAP?
---
Why the assumption that there is a hook swarm.  I have faced garbage ass killers who manage to down someone immediately and proceed to facecamp them unprovoked.  The amount if gens left doesn't make something camping or not lol.  A killer staring at them does.
---
You won't get a 4k with OoO active if you're Ghostface. Like, it doesn't happen.
---
I love the Inhaler and gum being in the pic lol
---
You haven’t heard shit if you don’t remember Kate on the PTB
---
If they told you to KYS, report them. Bhvr doesn't tolerate that crap, and neither does X-box or Playstation. This game doesn't need asshats like that spouting potentially harmful statements, slurs, or harassment. No one deserves verbal abuse even if its in message/text form, and the Devs, X-box, PSN, all know that and are usually pretty quick to punish instances of it. 
---
From your video it looks like they were pretty coordinated (SWF?), stupid (hook rushing right in front of the killer?), and over-entitled due to the petty DC's. Topping that off with insults and KYS messages like you've stated just shows that they aren't grown up enough to be playing this game. A ban warning or soft ban will either teach em to grow up a little, or they won't get the message and repeat it until they get perma-banned for being toxic to the community and its reputation (\*Cough\* Ochido \*Cough\*). 
---
Don't listen to these toxic-over-entitled-brats, and don't take anything they say seriously. You played the game how you wanted to play it, they were obviously being idiots, and you did nothing wrong. Report away, take a break if you must, and when you return to playing... have fun.
---
most Davids I play with are quite skilled and almost always take hits for were gonna live forever
---
I feel this in my bones
---
This is why I always bring an Ivory these days if I'm Ghostface. I can choke slam them.oit of the trial and go back to playing normally.
---
Which is dumb as promotion is allowed, as long as it's a reasonable amount and you are active in the subreddit.
---
That's such bull shit. You should get more points and a BBQ stacks for DCers.

she was obviously giving him one or two free hits before escaping
---
Weak killer logic.  Those of us with a bot more seasoning play aggressively to initiate new chases with different survivors and keep getting hooks on different people.  You get way more bloodpoints, a far easier pip and a more enjoyable game for both sides.  You don't have to just tunnel one survivor down at a time.  This is a beginner strat that good killers outgrow.
---
Have you heared Laurie?
---
yep I added it :3
---
I don’t think Coulrophobia is as good as it sounds.
---
If a survivor is in your terror radius they probably aren’t going to try healing anyway.
---
Like I’d rather have 400 extra points over an entire additional game
---
Just said he was salty 
---
Never said he was bad
---
Good talk, must not have much of a life though
---
I understand why some people would be upset about noed or ebony moris but rancor, ruin and devour hope? Really?
---
This is amazing.
---
Clearly the solution is to allow the killers to throw survivors across the map onto a hook
---
I would do both
---
you couldve downed both the clauds safer, if shes injured and right the fuck in front of you by basement, just stab her

---
Wtf
---
I think I know what this is referring to
---
It’s a necessary evil without it perks like clouraphobia sloppy butcher and franklins would be OP
---
Ps4
---
1. When crouching  next to trees as a survivor, you can actually get stuck.  Only way to move is have the killer down you. 
---
2. Some games all action that require the meter on the bottom do not work. You can not heal, throw down pallets, vault anything....literally nothing
---
3. When 2 occurs and you are by the open gate, you can not exit the stage. You fall off the edge and return back to the middle of the map.
---
4. Happened as survivor and as a killer. On a first down of a survivor, even without decisive strike, when you pick up the survivor a d strike occurs anyway and automatically. Has happened to me in at least 5 games already.
---
because they can still escape through hatch or the other door, having an area to heal, then teleport in, and go for the save, is ridiculous
---
I’m new to dbd, so survivors are looked at badly if they unhook a survivor?
---
One is not like the others... hmm.
---
And he never mentioned the op power of tbags 😔
---
she can still escape through the other door or hatch, its been tested and it only effects one escape route per time the bug procs. Meaning for both doors to be locked, it would be the same chance of the bug happening, twice in one game
---
You got downvoted cause you said it wasn't revelant when it actually is cause there's more than just ghostface.
---
I think it looks wonderful! As for any advice, mess around with deformation. You can avoid art looking flat by deforming the face to match the direction it would be facing. It can also apply to many other things. Keep it up!
---
I dont see your point

Inside every survivor is a skull, trying to get out.
---

---
See again I don’t have any issue with “niche” killers. It’s never going to be the case where all killers are equally viable. You’re going to have ones that are just “better”. The easier they are to get value from, the better (as a general rule). 
---
Going back to Overwatch again, Reaper is an absolute nightmare to deal with a lot of times because it’s really easy to get a lot of value from his kit. Where as someone like Widowmaker, can make just a big an impact, but it’s much more difficult to do, which is why you don’t see her as often.

---
NOED is inevitable
---
But killers dont pip from getting just 3 kills.
---
Besides, you can say the same thing about a skeleton key. It allows you to completely avoid the end game and the killer, who is likely patrolling gates. You can also find one during a game.
---
Lol oops my bad, u threw me off with the “...”

I thought you were trying to sprinkle some salt.

Nvm. You can’t support your own statement.

I’m all for someone disagreeing with my statement, but it has to be facts, not insults or opinions.
---
Gotem
---
It used to be infinite but it was changed to this number for a specific reason, trust me 128 is more than enough
---
Putting an ebony mori and a skeleton key on the same level is special. Gotta love false equivalences.
---
Only half toxic really..as I truly don't understand the point of sending strangers I played the game with a message for any reason.  What makes you think anyone give a shit about what you have to say online?   I assume it is a generational thing, for those who are more integrated with technology, and haven't had time to realize that no one outside of their friends/family cares about what they have to say.
---
I mean it does suck but its not the killers fault he's trying to """Kill""" you. If it looks like you're getting face camped just suicide on the hook and move on. With the exception of LF your team should always be able to get you off the hook as well. Sounds more like you want your self imposed survivor rules placed in the game where the killer has to run to the opposite side of the map after hooking you.
---
Well, most killer rules have been just put into a game so survivors are punished for them. No more looping the same window for years, no more pallet camping (because of vacuum), no more combining exhaustion perks, no more waiting at the hatch just to annoy the killer. All of these are now impossible.
---
And yet all they have ever done to deal with killer’s toxic mechanics, such as camping, tunneling or slugging, were adding survivor perks to help you deal with some of them.
---
Killers’ got perks that help them with looping, pallets and a lot more, but they also got mechanics that help them deal with these things even perkless. Survivors do not have such an ability.
---
I hear what you're saying. My outlook was molded by the state of the game when I started playing. Old DS was so overwhelmingly powerful that it totally broke the game. Going up against a 4 man DS squad as killer gave me enough perspective on the matter to decided against using it as a survivor. The devs had allowed the game balance to get so far out of control that I felt the need to take matters into my own hands. I felt the need to nerf myself to make the game fair. That should never happen, but it was the situation I found myself in. The game is in a much better state now, but old habits die hard.  
---
That being said, I don't think complaining on the sub is a bad thing. The changes we get in game are a result of the game devs understanding of community feedback. The DS change was a good one.
---
I have been saying this for so long... I have finally found my people ;.;
---
This picture reminds me so much of Attack on Titan lol
---
Probably the first. The game likely registers how many totems need to become a Hex totem, and then it assigns a random value to each one, with each value corresponding to the order the hex perks are equipped.
---
Only rank 13 just started to play killer
---
Day 37: They still don't know I'm not one of them
---
Not really.
---
You cant find a mori during a match
---
Both allow you to ignore the main objective by allowing you easy kills for less BP, or an easy escape for less bp.
---
Both are ultra rare things you have to pull off the web
---
The key has add ons that can make it even better
---
Communication can make escaping with it insanely easy
---
A mori can make killing bad survivors insanely easy 
---
They arent nearly as different as you're trying to make them out to be. Both are stupid.
---
this is really good !

 *Platform:*  PS4
---
*Type of Bug:*  Audio
---
*Description:* No music when playing as Killer (Legion and Myers so far)
---
*Steps to reproduce:* Usually happens after a BGM change (chase, killer-specific music, etc)
---
*Expected result:* Once the music reverts, all music will cease entirely.
---
*Actual result:* It worked lol
---
*Reproduction rate:* 100%
---
this is awesome
---
Great stuff, always brings a smile to my face
---
Spirit &gt; Legion || Pig
---
This bug is very rare and has been here for a while, it has nothing to do with 3.0.0.
---
It does not seem it even actually requires you to enter the locker. You just glitch into the objects and cannot get out because of collision.
---
The spot is bugged out which gave space to any player joining. Spaghetti-code.
---
A perk being objectively bad doesn’t mean it has 0 use. It’s just not as good as it could be.
---
Yeah but in general 3.0 broke more than it even came close to fixing
---
Not exactly. It's frowned upon to rush the hook and save when the killer is nearby, due to the fact that you are risking the life of your teammate for 1000 bloodpoints.
---
literally the cutest mfing huntress ive ever seen in my entire life. ilysm cam &lt;333 im gonna be honest and say that after just a few hours of watching you, you became one of my favorite streamers to watch. and now i can say 100% you are literally my favorite person on twitch. everyday that you stream seriously just makes me so fucking happy. zubSAD ilysmostest
---
LMAO get outplayed noob
---
ikr. i wanna wear it and roleplay as a magical girl
---
I was talking about being toxic not getting a pip lmao
---
Pig is fun but I stopped maining her because of her useless addons. Legion is fun after the rework but his power is a little bit useless after the first minutes.
---
I definitely couldnt survive the piggy or the russian thiccness.
---
True lol
---
Why am I cryin rn
---
I love u so much
---
What in the hell? I would love to hear an explanation to this.
---
As for addons, the combo with the best rarity/power ratio is Telephoto Lens and the Address book. Fast recovery and fast stalking while not leaning. The only downside is that the exposed status effect lasts a bit less, but if you're capable of chasing you'll have no problems.
---
As for perks I usually run with Ruin, BBQ&amp;Chilli, Thrilling Tremors and Pop Goes the Weasel. Tremors and Pop are a really good combo because you can know which gens are being done with tremors and instantly regress it with Pop.
---
Oooh okay my bad maybe they downvoted you cause they thought the same as me 🤣 tf
---
Both can be uses in toxic ways as well.
---
Simply killing isnt toxic.
---
Just escaping isnt toxic.
---
Reminds me of getting yelled at after getting a 4K on ghostface and then in postgame chat I was yelled at for not using my power because I was constantly in a chase
---
One game there was a survivor in the exit gate waiting me to come, but I was far from it and the killer was chasing me. The hatch was near me and if survivor escaped I could get it. But he waited till I got hooked and died.
---
-13. Just wow.
---
i was so confused 😂 you’re right, it does read as if i’m saying this entire post isn’t relevant haha my bad y’all!
---
Or the skin grab in that same movie, the girl near the church. That was some brutal death.
---
It absolutely helps you in chases. When they kick a pallet, you get x ray vision which way they are going giving you a head start on your loop, even if they moonwalk. It tells you where pallets are being used, hints if it's safe to unhook, and if the killer is coming in your direction after kicking a gen etc. It's a very informative perk of you think about the information right. Only time it sucks is on t1 Myers or Freddy. 
---
Windows of opportunity tells you what you can already see and is really hindered by its inexplicable cool down. Alert isn't really like that at all...
---
What an accomplishment
---
yeah using 2 very specific perks in order to killer out of many killers isn't exactly the right way to go
---
I’d rather not be saved unless multiple players are trying to bait the killer to save me. Otherwise we both get downed. I’ve had the game for years but just a started playing during the anniversary event. I’m hooked on it
---
Thank you everyone for your input. I got some good ideas now of how I want to build him and I’ll try each build and add ok you guys recommended and see which one I gravitate towards.
---
teabagging the guy with a lag switch cable or getting out asap in end game
---
Source: my old post https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b1djr6/when_nea_teabags_the_guy_who_has_a_lagswitch_cable/
---
Spoken like a true survivor main. If you get knocked in the gate because you're a cocky little shit, you're going on the hook.
---
Pig. Better killer with better perks.
---
Preach on brotha
---
If I stay it's because:
---
1. To wait and make sure the other survivors safely get out
---
2. See if the killer wants a free hit or points
---
Xbox has a visual bug with doctor where the status bar for all actions is like ten percent ahead of where it should be. I should clarify and say the bug is for survivors and it might actually be because of sloppy butcher. Not really sure what caused it but man was it annoying
---
I started playing post nerf and he is my main, so yeah. It takes a bit but I honestly think chases are more fun with legion.
---
Well then don't be surprised where that us vs them mentality comes from.
---
Laughs in Ark
---
Yikes you pissed some edgy people off
---
Yeah but no. Please be serious, an ebony mori systematically turns the game it's played in. A key... more often useless than not.
---
If all 4 survivors escape with key, it's because all gens are done (because they wouldn't be able to see the hatch otherwise). And when you're playing 1v4 with all gens done, you already lost the game, maybe the key is stealing you one kill (for the cost of at least an epic add on, not great).
---
No, the most likely situation is that a lone survivor manages to use his key to re-unlock the hatch after you locked it and flee, or very rarely the two last survivors who did at least 3 gens manages to yeet away.
---
Anyway, the numbers are against you on this one. Keys are balanced in the sense that they only rarely change the fate of a game, but when they do, it's impressive (the rare 3 survivors - 1 gen remaining escape is infuriating, but very rare). Ebony moris are a permanent game changer and not fun to play against at all.
---
Lagswitch.
---
Oof hard bm on rob zombie. Do people think his movies are that bad? I loved house of wax and house of a thousand corpses
---
You see the killer aura for a few seconds after the action which is where it really shines. This tells you where they are going (great for chases), where pallets have been used by teammates, where generators are being worked on, and of course where the killer is. It has no CD and it's map wide. Bond is fine too though
---
Either a really unfortunate lag spike, or the Huntress could've lag switched.
---
I choose death.
---
You definitely don’t play survivor because if you played you would know that’s a damn lie without borrowed time they would just wait even then they would just tunnel you on-top of that not everyone is a SWF.but killers expect the survivors not to 360 and Tea bag them there is a double standard your expecting and don’t forget the job of the survivor is to Survive and it’s impossible to survive if they can camp correctly and last it’s not self imposed if most of the community besides the dumbasses and the people who claim that they are survivors agree with so as I said miss me with the “I play survivor” bullshit
---
Hahaha God damn, that's good shit right there
---
80% of games I play that get to the exit gate, the killer and survivors enjoy some boosting and everyone seems happy about it in post game chat.
---
It’s not objectively bad just situational
---
Nani!?

atleast op was honest about his dishonesty

that would have been fun if he wasn’t silent like he is now lol
---
Would have been better if you had both speed add ons lol
---
You have to remember, the end game is absolutely a part of the game, and kills are not everything, just as escaping isnt.
---
3 survivors escaping with a key is dumb. Especially if they found it in a chest. 
---
And you have to actually down survivors twice for a mori to work. It's not just "when you start the game, all 4 survivors die"
---
The fact the you cannot find the game changing mori in a game, but can find a game changing key (plus they if you brought one, you can make it better, a mori is always the same)
---
The numbers arent really "against me" we are actually arguing about opinions. This conversation doesnt even matter, as we likely wont be able to change the others opinion.
---
They're edgy, angsty teens. nuff said.
---
Pig is so much fun to play!!! I don't always get a 4k with her but I usually have a good time giving survivors a big spook lol
---
Do you have the VoD up? I'm interested as well.
---
Idk man. Why would they ban you, if you didnt do something to warrant it. You guys all come here and say I got banned for no reason I have rarely seen a unreasonable ban.
---
To be honest I believe the devs have not fixed it because they have either forgotten about the add-on or just have had a lack of driving force to bother fixing the add-on. 
---
Since there have not been many requests to fix the add-on because Leatherface is a relatively unpopular killer and how acceleration is a poorly understood parameter, the devs have had no pushing force to fix the add-on. 
---
There is a similar case with Freddys add-on, swing chains. Swing chains is currently glitched in that it does not work as intended making it a much weaker add-on. Since no one has really noticed nor asked the Devs to fix the add-on, the add-on has remained broken since Freddys release.
---
lol yesterday i was playing Basement LF and it s so funnny, i mean you dont see the killer the entire match but you have to go to the basement to check anyways... so much salt and laughs
---
Oh fuck, when did Micheal get a car !
---
All he had to do was pick up dwight and keep the match going.
---
I’m not saying it’s OP, i’m just saying I have shit luck

🧂
---
Rank 1 on both most every season. Its ok though, I can tell you're entrenched in your SJW Survivor main mindset. Its not worth debating it with you. You're also most likely the person who reports people in after game chat when they hurt your feelings. Ill make sure to face camp some people tonight in your honor.

Michel Myers aus Lönneberga

&gt;!TIL his original name is Emil!&lt;
---
Right?

I know which post this is referring to
---
I knew Nea had a penis
---
No
---
Thats the subreddit doing it not the OP, its to prevent band wagons
---
His ability was broken and couldn’t be canceled by looking at him or at all and it could be activated through walls. Every single one that I played against abused the hell out of it. I probably would have too though if I had a severely broken character.
---
Show me proof
---
Can someone explain what tunneling is? I barely started playing two days ago..
---
oof that sounds rough. and definitely! especially since everyone knows it’ll only be broken a little while, might as well have fun with it.
---
hillbilly has the worst mori imo
---
Because this is a circlejerk
---
I want to comment on the plague part, spirit is another beast entirely. For the plague when ahe chases you if you are at a loop and she tries to puke on you i find sometimes crouching can help. The biggest thing ive found with dealing with plague is looping her at high walls and not giving her a chance to puke on you. Just like all killers, she will eventially get you but you can extend the chase by a long time doing this. Another thing is when she goes to a fountain for corrupt purge, it doesnt last that long so hiding out isnt a bad idea until it wears off, otherwise again, if she chases you, go to high walls and dont give her an opportunity to puke on you
---
kate is my favorite survivor, but her default outfit sticks out like a sore thumb
---
Get a killer for sure. You'll enjoy your investment more
---
In your situation I would have let one wiggle free and taken another one to a hook while they unhooked the Meg and healed the remaining downed survivor, but they DC'd like pussies.
---
Why self promo here you know its not liked?
---
1. If they say they have proof then there is a 99% chance its more than just the anti-cheat system.
---
2. They dont need to tell you when you are hacking
---
3. They dont need to respond to you right away, they could even be looking into it further things outside of the internet dont happen immediately.
---
4. They did give you a reason for the ban, its called hacking.
---
5. Anyone can hack just cus you bought all the DLC doesnt meen you cant hack.
---
You should replace Overwhelming Presence for Hex:Ruin or Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
And your add-ons are underwhelming, on Doctor, you should use his range add-ons, his range is trash at base. Or you can go full purple/red add-ons, Doctor isn't too good without them in my opinion.
---
Usually aces or dwights are really good looping. Especially aces
---
Also isnt it against the rules?
---
Maybe it already had a down side of having more than enough time to complete all the gens and people just dont take advantage of it?
---
That's happened to me too many times
---
I remember hearing someone saying they were saving them up for later events, and also the next chapter releases so that they could level any new characters they liked quickly.
---
Thank you Lasagna_lover_69, very cool.
---
Im pretty sure.
---
One does not simply bumrush a leather face...
---
Now a good 70% of them just camp and teabag aggressively
---
Matchmaking is whack, I am rank 8 and only play solo and I loaded into a rank 19 killers game with rank 17 - 20 survivors as my team mates, it is frustrating for both sides. I died on my first hook after no one came to save and ran the killer for ages and one gen popped during this. 😭🤣
---
As a leather face and freddy main: *D a r n*
---
i like the tea bagging tbh! a lot of survivors do it to taunt so it’s funny that it happens back haha
---
I think so
---
Okay that makes a lot of sense. Thank you for explaining that to me.
---
Easy lag switch. Didn’t even bother breaking the pallet
---
It’s an interesting concept, but there are a few things that stand out to me.
---
1. He is ridiculously fast. He has a base movement speed of 120%, the fastest in the game, and his entire power just revolves around him getting faster and faster.
---
2. Aftermath is just Bitter Murmur but way worse.
---
3. Resist Death states that it only works after the survivors second hook. Meaning it would be useless if they just aren’t saved until they reach second phase. 
---
4. Smooth Silk doesn’t seem that practical. The time it lasts is way too short and even if it were longer I don’t see why you would suddenly ignore the person you are chasing to go after the other person, unless you wanted to do a surprise attack or something.
---
All in all it’s an interesting idea, there’s just a few things that I don’t see working. Sorry for the negative feedback.
---
Emphasis on the okay, but definitely better than my shitty ass drawing. I can make a stick figure look like a bundle of sticks.
---
It doesn't particularly matter, it's mostly just curiosity on my part. It could potentially matter if it's the second option though. That could have an impact when Haunted Grounds is being used. If the devs haven't doubled the likelihood of the cleansed hex being haunted grounds it would explain why it seems that when you use HG + Ruin, Ruin seems to get cleansed first 50% of the time when it should be 33% of the time. This is anecdotal of course, I don't have any data for the percentage of games where ruin is cleansed first.
---
DCs before you get out the gate like a true rank 15
---
Oh for sure. She is on a completely different level. I play her without add-ons and try not to tunnel. But after playing my favorite, Freddy, and getting looped by decent players, sometimes I just want to destroy some people.
---
Spirit Fury on Spirit oof
---
You won't beat survivors in a game of toxicity
---
I was the *other* 50% running sloppy and nurses

Plot twist: it’s Devour Hope and HG.

That’s the exact same build I run on my wraith! Either you get an easy 4K or hardcore lose with 1k and gen rush in 4 mins
---
It was worth it
---
This is an opinion. Were arguing whether or not one is worse than the other, which I really dont think they are. "Free win" items are stupid.
---
It's not that rare for a key to make a difference.
---
Not taking the gates can make the difference between a 1k and a 4k. Its unexpected. A mori you have a lot of warning.
---
If the killer relies only on mori and wouldn't do good without it, then they shouldnt do good with it. Remember, you still have to down a survivor twice.
---
I dont think the argument is stupid as they both serve the same purpose of making winning much easier.
---
This is gold
---
I understand the depip part, but this wouldn’t make sense in game and lore wise. Also, I know your trying to let the survivor get off easy all, but I’m pretty sure the devs don’t want you to give the last survivor a free win just because their teammates DC’d.

I was camped. As the title says. In the title. Not sure if you read that 👀
---
at least this is finite. hatch standoffs could theoretically last until the servers crash or reboot.
---
Only use it before prestige so it's not wasted
---
I agree with the RNG part, sometimes totem spots are shitty. But I feel like this would make running hex perks just turn you into trapper or something, you have to waste a ton of time just going around and placing your hexes. You could argue that maybe while you have a hex perk on you you see full totem auras, but I still feel like you would benefit more from certain perks if they were present at the start of the game, like ruin.
---
#Savage
---
Now this is some prime meme
---
Good point, I actually agree a lot with the pre mettle example. Personally I don't really have a big problem with rancor since as a survivor, I enjoy the fear factor it implies (sparks a shit ton of anxiety though),and as a killer I usually just end up not even finding the obsession and they escape(i also rarely ever see it as survivor, only when going up against spirits)
---
If they farm and get their teammates killed there’s no more “honor” enjoy getting tunneled while I let the people you’ve farmed enjoy their time
---
BHVR has already indicated they're working on the framerate of console editions.
---
Spirit cannot fly through windows. Get through open gens as fast as you can.
---
Damn this is high quality
---
Its a thing, if you hold crouch and run at same time. Then leave crouch, you run without using sprint burst
---
Love it! Just wish it was more mobile friendly
---
The Spirit waahs got me good
---
What’s SFW
---
Sure but imagine a sudden ruin with like 2 gens left and stuff, and sure if you picked 4 hex perks you waste a bunch of time but that would be a drawback to it
---
You have to take the time to place the hex but you place it where you want.
---
You could just have it take 1 second to activate it wouldnt use up much time
---
It's my dream to be a rank 1 Legion :(
---
BHVR pls buff.
---
the other two are the nuts
---
As a survivor I get this a lot as well, and while I can’t vouch for your situation, I’m usually put up against them because I play SWF because i enjoy playing with my friends. I hate the anti-SWF that goes on, even though it’s mostly warranted, because me and my friends just wanna mess around with perk randomizer or stupid builds
---
Except all the things you listed for survivors are a GOOD thing you could've done, they netted in more bloodpoints for the survivor. Camping as a killer does the opposite, you're completely losing any nap pressure you have and letting gens get done for free. The killer sacrifices overall bloodpoints just to be toxic. That's the trade off right there.
---
And regardless, until the game decides to make camping impossible somehow or disincentivize it even more than they do now, then there's no basis on what should and shouldn't be allowed
---
Pssst, OP: Play Claudette
---
I can give you a long list of counter tunneling, camping and slugging perks
---
If you think that the old infinities and vacuum pallets were okay then you either didn’t play killer at all or weren’t there
---
Did you try stabbing someone once, then while they where bleeding out, you tried healing them by rubbing their back?
---
Tip: don't look at me while you are hiding, I can feel your bitchy eye on me
---
Also, if there’s more than one DC in a game, it should guarantee that the remaining players don’t depip. Wholesome players shouldn’t be punished for others’ toxic behavior.
---
Not me I got noob survivors as a noob killer
---
i love him. the variety his addons give him is incredible. 
---
also, he’s probably the only killer in the game who’s OP addons (scratched mirror, lerys, m&amp;a) are actually fucking fun as hell to play against (unlike iridescent heads, for example). scratched mirror on lerys with m&amp;a is my favorite to play against, yeah you are basically guaranteed to lose but it’s just so fun with all the jump scares.
---
I'm not really mad at anything, just surprised that some people think that the previously mentioned perks are OP(I was assuming that in the post, the survivors in question are claiming that it's op which wasn't good to presume on my part, my apologies). However, if some think that the perks are annoying or unfun to against, that's completely understandable
---
As for the political example, I don't really know or follow up with politics so I hope you'll excuse me on that one
---
Spirit, you will not regret it.
---
As much as I love mommy huntress, I gotta day I hate that damn add-on, both playing with and against. Makes things too easy
---
As long as it’s the same car that he drive around in one of the movies.

One word. Yeth

Haven't tried her yet but I will now lol
---
that mori timing was perfect it looked like a cinematic.
---
yes, all 10 of them
---
I can agree with the fear factor. It does get my heart pumping when I am able to escape while still being chased by the killer. It is just annoying when you are being chased with 1-2 gens left and you know either you are going to be tunneled and moried once all gens are done. You will have to either break the chase or get downed on purpose to give you another chance to hide. Feels like I am being punished for distracting and running the killer, which is something I enjoy doing.

this. i do this all the time and my SWF is happy but when one of them needs to sacrifice they’re like “bRo SaVe Me BrO!!” when it’s a ghost face w/ noes
---
Wow what a coincidence lol
---
Lol "hero". Based on how survs are in this game, thats a pretty accurate name for them
---
I think the only reason they haven’t done this is cause of consoles now doing that automatically if you want replays on pc I’d just find a free recording software and run it once the game starts to load
---
All I'm saying in general it's wise to take hearsay lightly and not form an opinion or have emotions over he said / she said
---
I do! I'll PM it to you.
---
Sorry in advance. I'm rank 12 so...That should give you an idea on my skill level. But dang it, I have fun.
---
Thanks, and do you know if certain addons, ie freddy addons stack with other addons/ perks like sloppy butcher?
---
I feel like i'm the one getting one hooked outside of basement wondering what the hell my teammates are doing...
---
Leatherface literally can't lose this if you are good. Stop the chainsaw and grab them either out of the locker or as they are coming out. Even a sprint locker exit is not fast enough to avoid a grab in this scenario.
---
Still has that unique camera perspective for the survivor. Trapper just shows you getting slashed on the floor while Wraith just shows him wailing away and you're off-screen.
---
That would require work from the devs.
---
What kind of absurd, inverse incentive structure is that setting up though? You are supposed to hook people and then ignore the other 3 people hiding near the hook for no other reason than the point system arbitrarily says so. I am not saying the status quo isn't like that, just that it shouldn't be.
---
***Your choice has been recorded***
---
Haunted ground is so good on Ghost Face I run it as soon as I got it. No TR instant down doesn't even need to stalk mmmmm so good.
---
Same here. I try to switch up my perks based on my objective (Playing for pips,bp, fun, or a 4k). I never use obsession perks because frankly, they are useless/not worth it on hag and kind of boring to me on Myers.
---
For real. If it’s a Wraith or Freddy I know immediately I need to cleanse totems
---
Wait you’re telling me the game strictly balanced around the time it takes to do five generators gets slanted even more towards the killer if you take the time to hunt all the totems which now thanks to the incessant whining of this subreddit are even more hidden? Crazy
---
Her injured noises are funny too lol she’s just coughing loudly the whole time
---
Type of Bug: Gamebreaking
---
Description: Puking on a downed survivor as the Plague will crash the game.
---
Reproduction rate: Only had the opportunity to do it once so far, might happen again if you puke on healthy downed survivors.
---
Movie theater sounds so cool 😭
---
This Peach is so much cuter than the Meg Peach.
---
This was me in R6 Siege for the longest time
---
does she murder you if you choose wrong?
---
3-4 survivors going down the hatch is about as rare as a 4k with a mori. And it absolutely has the same impact. The game ends, and very little if anything could be done about it.
---
A key opening a hatch is rare, but its equally effective. Rarity does not effect impact.
---
In elder scrolls online, only one person can have volemdrug at a time. It's rare to see. It still wins games.
---
If an ebony mori leads to 4 kills, the survivors were really really bad. Period. Remember, you have to down them twice. I see people talk about keys a lot in other communities. This community likes to pretend they dont exist.
---
Hey, I've got a question regarding this steam event. Does I need getting achievements in the time of the event or completed achievements counts also to the discount pool?
---
Asking because I've don't almost all achievements in PD2, so you know...
---
i mean honestly even the cosmetics for non licensed characters that you buy with shards are just recolors so even if they did sell licensed cosmetics for shards(which i doubt) itd be trash anyways
---
Never going to happen. They need actual $ to pay for the licensing &amp; im pretty sure whoever owns the license gets a chunk of every purchase.
---
All of my suggestions are usually Haunted Grounds in that situation.
---
How is this not common knowledge? Did you read the description?
---
Hello
---
Idk why there's ppl downvoting the post and the comments, I suck on huntress, but I have all respect for her, such a good killer if you master her.
---
Freddy's Action Speed-affecting add-ons do stack, and they will also stack with things like Sloppy Butcher, yes.
---
One thing of note as a by the way is that debuffs stack successively, rather than cumulatively. So a survivor in the dream world will suffer a 50% debuff to healing speed (16 / 0.5 = 32), and then an additional 20% due to Sloppy Butcher (32 / 0.8 = 40), as opposed to suffering a 70% debuff (16 / 0.3 = 53).
---
I love this combo with Trapper ... 1/3 chance of them not destroying my hex right away is pretty sweet.
---
hahahahaha yeah pretty much, lightborn is very good indeed.
---
just buy and level up leatherface. with bbq it’s not hard to get points so the grind to level 35 won’t take too long
---
&gt; strictly balanced
---
OMEGALUL
---
Leatherface for BBQ
---
Laurie for DS
---
Not a bad view if you’re gonna die
---

---
i’d replace overwhelming with bbq or ruin.

prepare for some serious disconnects
---
So lemme get this straight they can pay for the right to use happy birthday but not for a father death cloak?
---
Do you also find peace, solace and friendship in junk mail?  You are comparing solicited to unsolicited interactions.  It is clear that talking to strangers fulfills some hidden purpose in your life. Good for you. You could use a few tips on generating a coherent argument though, so you may consider looking that up.
---
We're not playing the same game then. 4K with a mori is the norm. It's a false equivalence, I can only repeat it so much. 
---
You're missing the point with the impact, rarity doesn't effect impact on a sole game indeed, but it's the most important thing affecting impact on the game's health in its globality. Because something very impactful that doesn't happen often isn't really that impactful at the end of the day.
---
We're not discussing the fact that keys can make you feel bad once in a blue moon when moris make games feel boring a few times a week for everybody, that's not relevant.
---
I don't really see the point in continuing this thread, you're completely removed from the objective reality. With this frame of mind you can make everything equal. You're pissed because once a year the rainbow map allows the last survivor to find the hatch before you do ? Doesn't make it an issue equivalent to the mori one.
---
I realize I thought it would be funny if I compared it to a hatch standoff.
---
You know PS4 has messaging, right?
---
yeah that one is unfortunate. I'm usually in SWF so we can call that out. I have stayed back quite a few games to take a hit for others or unhook them
---
It'd make it less dependent on skill and pretty bs. Imagine failing a dead hard but still succeeding. That's pretty unfair for the killer
---
This would make it super OP
---
Why ash...I heard mettle of man is absolutely dog shit now
---
Definitely am
---
Its not junk mail, oh this is an argument? I thought we were just discussing, I can give you some tips on what an argument is if you want but clearly you know everything so please educate me on that :)
---
hahahahahaha damn dude.... its all those redbulls LuL
---
Mostly for cosmetics, adam is good too. Difference is great
---
The sound which female survivor make when doing this makes it even better
---
4k with a mori is not a norm. If they got a 4k, you guys all went down twice, you deserved the loss.
---
Alright. Let's put in an addon that let's survivors stab the killer instantly and win the game, but let's make it rare. Now its balanced.
---
I dont either, since you keep repeatedly using ad hominem in lou of an actual argument, and we have already established that our opinions wont change.
---
Yea it shouldn't be too hard. I just bought him like an hour ago but ima finish the nurse until I get nurse's calling then work on LF
---
Idk if Rancor is toxic perk
---
Wait what about cosmetics..arent I supposed to buy it
---
It’s already a popular perk, this would make it a must pick.
---
That’s someone leaving a marker with a map
---
Imo ash is the best looking survivor
---
That's a add-on on the Map where you can highlight a Spot with the Map
---
can we get rid of this dumb fucking perk, doing 5 totems isn't realistic to do every game...
---
Buddy I think your wrong about the rank thing
---
wait, it works with gens too? I didn't know that, thanks for the info.
---
That's the response I'm looking for. I'm not new to the game, but I'm always trying to learn, and I have been using Dead Hard for a long time now as I love playing David, but am trying to figure out the best way to use the perk as-is. I'm not vouching for that change to be added to the game by a long shot. But what is the best way to use Dead Hard, from your point of view?
---
Headless horseman killer and I want Randy from scream and scream 2
---
Lets buff one of the most meta perks in the game !!
---
Killer was wario clown
---
Lol. This game has twenty times the players as Friday. You know there's a thing called steamcharts right?
---
So much this. Not even just for younger family/friends. People online get pissy when you beat them with one move because I was like.. "wow you actually dont know how to not handle pressure.... oh look im literally just using 1 button and it's working...."
---
Searchbar.
---
Bifrost
---
...it's a copypasta...
---
We don't need to buff an already meta perk.
---
Chill... no, I didn’t know that, because I barely browse steam and i just switched to PC recently?
---
What did it cost?
---
Big brain Quentin main
---
Nah that was clutch
---
The devs don't need you to report it; they can see who quits and how much without getting reports about them. I know a couple of people who got (temp) banned for DCing, so the devs are punishing people for it, just not harshly enough in my opinion.
---
Yes it's the norm (along with 3Ks if you please). Repeating otherwise won't change the facts.
---
The game is balanced around all survivors going down on average three times to die, of course reducing that to two is game-changing. It's removing a third of a survivor's life. It's huge. Imagine playing a game where your team only has 66% of the usual HP.
---
A lot of times, you go down twice and still get out alive, because that's how the game is balanced. There's no such thing as "if you go down twice you deserve to lose". It's "if you go down thrice you deserve to lose", litterally how the game works. Survivors are supposed to trade health states for time so the other survivors can finish the objectives while they run and eventually go down. Removing on average 8 health states from the game is a pretty big fucking deal, for an average survivor can easily make more than 30 seconds of chase out of each health-state. Way bigger than eventually cutting the 30 seconds gate-opening time to take a hatch.
---
Anyway, last words for real this time. Enjoy life my dude !
---
Yea, try using it like that a few times. It was a hard time to get the timings right but it is really useful. Gives your teammates more time by wasting the killer's time ;)
---
You use Dead Hard to get to a pallet or window you wouldn't got it otherwise. 
---
Using Dead Hard in the open is useless, the killer can bait you very easily.
---
I wish I was selected for the event just so I could play Perkless Freddy. I'm very curious how Perkless Freddy vs Perkless Survivors (So no Self-Care or Adrenaline wake-ups) would have played out.
---
Using the basic M1 build(BBQ, Ruin, SF, Enduring) is better, but M&amp;A + Whispers can work on her pretty well.
---
Darn

I normally try to give new killers tips on how to get better and some recommendations on videos to learn how to get better. PainReliever and Scott Jund's video on how to run tiles as killers are always my go to recommendations.

They haven't actually said the results or what data they are collecting, this is just was me and my friends that play killer concluded from our experiences. But saying that would ruin the joke so... uhh... they haven't said the results yet because they know it is true.
---
Hahahahaha perfect
---
Okay lol
---
Tatum looks like Kate so no lol
---
Shut up bucko you best be getting on out of here before I open a can of noed on your ass
---
if there’s a dick there’s a way
---
I played a perkless Freddy on Wreckers Yard, it did not go well for him haha. 3 escapes and the kill was because the survivor had just about no looping skill whatsoever
---
You missed my point. Perks to counter slugging, camping and tunneling exist as well as perks to counter looping and abusing windows. It’s just that these things have been made harder even without any perks.
---
Survivor side alternatives for the changes done in order to make killers’ life easier would be:
---
* Make survivor get up by themselves, but make it a few times slower, so you can get up only if left alone for more than a minute.
---
* Make each hook phase last 90 seconds instead of 60, so genrush while camping is more of a counterplay.
---
* MAKE IT SO YOU DO NOT RECEIVE DAMAGE UNLESS YOU CAN MOVE I AM TIRED OF GETTING FUCKING DOWNED AGAIN BEFORE I CAN EVEN USE MY DH.
---
Brush it off. People that get that worked up over a game are unstable and not worth a second thought. Boo NOED though 😤
---
Meanwhile killers - 4k, brutal killer
---
I’m assuming you can read right? My comment wasn’t that hard to follow.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank
---
stop spreading misinformation. do some fucking research before you tell me im wrong.
---
Loop extending - if you're using the perk to avoid hits, you aren't using it well; a properly used Dead Hard can extend a chase by minutes, but using it to avoid a hit isn't as rewarding.
---
haha I found your reddit account now... post history time
---
If the game isn’t (poorly) balanced around the time it takes to do five gens should give an average killer time to kill two survivors then what is it balanced on?
---
Since you took your time to read it through, I'm coming to you to ask some questions. My limit is 13,720 points. But it doesn't say that my limit is reached on any of the other categories other than the achivement games. And, it also says, return tomorrow and put in your coins or something like that. I'm gonna try with TF2 and see if I can earn additional points, but if my limit is reached? Hmm...
---
Tatum is a cool character, for sure. One of my top three blondies in the "classic" horror films. I just don't know if she'd be the choice, considering with how many more people like Sidney more. I think it'd only really make sense too, even though we won't get her. Why not get the 'final girl', and main character of the film, against her slasher? \[Even though Scream as well isn't Billy or Stu.. ;(\]
---
That survivor was probably trying to give a free hit, I do it all the time, not as a sign of disrespect, but just as a way to give them something extra for a good game.
---
btw that's why GF sucks
---
F R I C K
---
oh wait I never post anything lmao
---
There's no reason to switch Spine Chill for anything, as it's not a good perk.  
---
Self Care is pretty bad, so I recommend switching it for another good perk(like DS, Hope, Unbreakable, etc.).  
---
If you really want to use Spine Chill, try using it with Resilience for a 15% increase in vault speed(it's fun).
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l18axrtw_kg
---
I will run both then to up my chances. I thank you kind one, I had not thought of it.
---
I don't really see why, it's a huge difference between pig leaving your terror radius and her stealthing. Any time I hear an abrupt quietness on TR I go high alert. Like the other guy said, if you're very adept at whispers this might be good combined with M&amp;A since you'd get a more accurate picture of a survivors location but M&amp;A by itself offers few benefits imo
---
Honestly, you're doing god's working tunneling sinners like this
---
😭 no plz i dint say nword
---
Your joking right?
---
That’s not true. The bug happened to me yesterday. I ran all the way around to the other door and still couldn’t escape and died. You sound dumb as hell
---
Well that particular ghost face t bagged us so I thought it was only fair to do it in return.
---
I always play as legion and people have a real hard time dealing with me, i dont undestand why people say its a bad killer.
---
I thought a better idea that don't waste so much time. Every totem spawn normally and the killer can change it places when he find a better dull totem, the killer can do it once per perk and only if any survivor has tryed to cleanse it (even tho if they only tapped) in that way the perk pressure will keep since the beggining of the match and the killer (if fell so) can change it's place
---
Whats a iron works building?
---
The chicken mask and background makes me wish they could add Jacket from Hotline Miami as a killer
---
Or a better Idea cleanse totems.
---
It’s entitled to leave that comment with the mindset that I said anybody’s fun didn’t matter which would be clear to you if you even read my comment.
---
All I said was that it’s weird that going sweaty is what they consider fun when it’s obviously not fun for the survivors when killers use sweaty perks
---
Same
---
This is the problem, they need to visually communicate it on screen. Either  
---
a) Some people don't know about it, and  
---
b) a visual indicator is a great way to "shame" campers. Bringing it to their attention makes them less likely to do it in the future.
---
No?  
---
If you're talking about the Self Care part, I'm not joking at all - it's a bad perk.
---
I really doubt this is the only time you tbag tho.
---
There's dozens of us.
---
Dozens.
---
I once had 3 survivors DC because I used a Shroud of Separation and they thought it was a Mori because Secret offering. I was a new player back then so I didn't understand what was going on until after the match.
---
No, that’s a good weave lol
---
In what way?
---
Who is this guy in the picture? I know that hes from an ad for some car repair company but cant remember which one
---
Well if the survivors keep flinging themselves towards me I’m alright with that
---
Noice build tho
---
Better idea, make a perk that doesn't reward the killer for being shit at the game.
---
I get that that is the best counter but still it can be very frustrating even if you do cleanse but because you missed one totem the killer has a big advantage over your team and by the point of the egc, well god help you trying to find it then lol
---
*Space*
---
ROfl obviously a bug, but wouldn't that be cool if their was something triggered by ominously standing still like that?
---
I think I've almost got to a hundred times with leveling him since I haven't prestiged
---
 Still no ruin
---
Or better idea how about you stop feeling entitled to win.
---
Lol the language difference really took me there too. Get jagd teabagger
---
If NOED is ever nerfed, then literally no one will ever do anything about dull totems.
---
We need more valuable dull totem perks.
---
Lmao did you forget you started the passive aggressiveness trying to sound smart making a stupid comment defending NOED?
---
I currently run Nurse's on him and it's especially strong now that they've removed the wooshing sound in stealth. Again, it depends on if you have your power ready, which is aided by add-ons.
---
Not really. It only puts her terror radius down to 24m.
---
I just cleanse totems or if i forget I just deal with it. Its a perk that has counters.
---
Pretty sure she just wanted to reveal you and get some extra 500 bp. What taunting are you talking about??
---
how about it's active at the beginning of the game until all totems are cleansed? That way it punishes killers for not protecting totems, but not "rewarding" poor play.  
---
Of course we'd remove the speed buff to make it fair.
---
It wastes your time; you could be doing gens or saving teammates instead of self-caring for 32/40 seconds.  
---
If you want to heal yourself, you're better off just using a medkit(and Botany Knowledge if you want it to be faster).  
---
Self Care is one of the perks that I actively harm survivors in my opinion.
---
True. But I only  do it when it’s a ghost face or pig that t bags or if they are a hardcore camper/ tunneler that despite there gameplay we still managed to save said person getting camped and tunneled.
---
Love spine chill! Really good perk, especially atm since a lot of ghostfaces out there
---
Yup.
---
Got caught at a jungle gym because of this.
---
Imma quickly clear up my position on Legion. I know he's not technically bad, but I was there for his debut, and I refuse to let go of that grudge. I think hes emblematic of every problem with DBD's balance. Other than that Id put him in like C tier
---
I like to bring rancor for mori dailies.  Pretty consistent, and decent tracking
---
I've had people claim Stake Out is a crutch perk.  I mean shit, never having to worry about ruin, and guaranteed bonus speed on gens after it's gone?  Yes please.
---
What exactly did you want to keep talking about? Gen speeds? NOED? Semantics? The perk doesn't need my defense.
---
They had been purposefully messing up skill checks on the Megs heals while I was across the map breaking pallets and stayed until the very end of the timer tea bagging lol I didn't just chase them there
---
spine chill is a top tier perk tf u talking about lmao

Thank you for under standing I would never do it to a killer that the match is obviously not going in there favor. because I’m a survivor main I play killer every once in a while and I know when I’m getting gen rushed or ran around I’m already a little embarrassed. And I purposely play fair as killer I never linger to long and I never tunnel because as a Survivor main that takes all the fun out of the game. I even get compliments from the survivors sometimes after I play thanking me for playing fair. Also it makes you seem so much better at the game of you get a 4K game and did fairly.
---
Lets just agree to disagree I am I still see many rank ones doing using it to this day and destroying
---
NC = Nurse's Calling?  
---
The perk is a waste of a slot to me because of how slow it is to heal, and there are much better ways of healing instead. Overall, there's no reason to heal unless you're against a Nurse, Spirit, or Huntress.
---
happened today to me. Looped a spirit for 3 gens then she downs me and facecamps me in the endgame. Still got the most points from my team even though i was the only one that died.
---
Legion is so ambivalent I see
---
lol you can tell yourself that but man your own posts here prove other wise.
---
I bet you even had to google troglodyte xD
---
HER CHASE SCENE IS THE BEST SCENE IN THE MOVIE! No one can change my mind!!! Not gonna lie.. It still chokes me up when she's ***right there,*** but she took just a second too long. ;;;((( Sasha too, ugh. Too iconic to be killed, all three of 'em.
---
Can they do something where we could get like... two/three-packs of killers/survivors? Cause ma'am, if they made that, Tatum, Helen, and Sasha would have to make it. I will literally throw money at BHVR for it.
---
Neither Casey nor Tatum would fit the role of being survivors though. They were both slaughtered pretty quickly by Ghostface as soon as he targetted them.
---
Honestly, I'd still play both of them though, their styles were cool
---
The killer isn't entitled, the killer gamble's a game gimping themselves with 3 perks an then HOPEFULLY NOED gets to come into play as a back up plan if they fail at their job of killing the survivors.
---
If you do the totems, you've gimped them the entirety of the match.
---
Plus you get emblem points for doing the totems and anyone getting chased gets points for you doing them as well.
---
Don't be lazy, don't be immersed, do the totems, and you don't have to worry about it.
---
Or don't an take your own gamble that the killer doesn't have it.
---
and thats why i ignore them. had a game with one where they kept trying to bait my attention, id chase them just long enough to make them run to the safe spot and go away, they waste huge amounts of time and i completely rofl stomp their team.
---
I mean, to each their own - if you think Self Care is a good perk, that's you.  
---
I see many players with countless hours in the game saying how Self Care isn't a perk worth running, and I think that way myself.
---
Which is toxic... Not hard to understand. How many others are just as moronic as you guys xD
---
Can't tell if this is bait or just the bottom 50% of DbD intelligence. Comments included. In the 14 million realities that Dr. Strange saw there was never one where Legion is as powerful as Nurse and where Trapper is less powerful than Freddy.
---
If I'm gonna be honest, I accidentally put billy as S tier lol, I meant to put him at SS whoops
---
Would also work for obsession perks that stop gaining tokens when the obsession is killed
---
Yeah, not my best work. I would've also added some fan-made perks, but it's almost midnight and my brain is out of idea juice.
---
I mean even nurse, who came out just after the original 3, her mori is just miles ahead of all 3, and it fits thematically too, idk how much some weak whipping animation fits to Trapper's theme
---
Agree. You'd literally spend your entire game in a locker and nothing would happen.
---
Exactly, I always try to say GG in a fair match not gonna lie tho if I play a game that’s completely rage inducing I ussually snap and put on an ebony Mori or something of the type just to help my bruised ego. People in this game suck, I’d put money on it the toxic ones got severely bullied in highschool and need a power trip to cope with how worthless they feel in real life. It’s all a power trip lol
---
Myers...only A tier?
---
Because I’m bad and don’t know the map and have made it this far because the killers I’ve faced have been as bad as me
---
This is... interesting, I guess...
---
Black Christmas, both iterations, are something I really enjoy. I never thought of this, but it'd be amazing!
---
She used a tbh though so it must be true /s
---
Nurse is a tier of her own, she can't be matched by any killer you've listed in the same tier as her.
---
Huntress gets cucked by most of the maps because hitboxes are broken, and she can be looped easily on these maps.
---
Plague's power gets nullified if survivors decide not to cleanse, she basically has them all exposed but she's an M1 killer, and those killers tend not to be that reliable.
---
this is why i run Borrowed Time. Makes for great late-game saves
---
God, what a throwback.
---
[For the uninitiated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHslEZdVDtA)
---
What are the inhaler and gum from?
---
I can't play the game. I followed the instructions people said in youtube or steam discussion and I contacted the DBD support. Nothing is helping
---
Yeah 99% of leveled up ghostfaces i see are enduring, spirit fury, ruin, haunted.
---
This guy must be trolling.
---
I would spend money on them. Ugh they should release them in a pack together, and they each get one unique perk. Basically the same thing as buying a regular pack, just get three characters (which are basically skins)
---
True but Casey’s death is so iconic, and Tatum kicked his ass before she died
---
As much as I prefer the original, the remake is decent in a few areas. I just hope the third one holds up.

As Far as I know, the 12,500 already has 25% more auric cells, on the 500 auric cells proportions.
---
example: here on Brazil 500 auric cells cost 15,50 BRL on PS4, 1100 auric cells cost 31,00
---
So that means I got 100 more auric cells, cause it gives 10% more auric cells on the 31,00 pack.
---
That's no problem man, it looks pretty professional overall
---
I think you f\*cked up your tier, I don't think someone can put Legion, Huntress or Spirit in SS tier together with Nurse ( or Spirit can be, but just with certain add-ons ).
---
git gud llamao
---
I like your nick
---
Thank you
---
Someone understands.
---
Thank you, kind sir.
---
Legion tho
---
Yeah, that's the one I meant!
---
Bhvr could easily just remove the body when it gets split in half, and to make it seem less, they could splatter blood everywhere to cover the fact that they just basically deleted the body!
---
When is the last time you restarted your computer?
---
Honestly, as much as I love Sidney, any Scream character would be a welcomed addition, and I'd be far from unhappy if we got Casey or Tatum
---
You should trash talk him back, tell him he died at 5 gens and he don't have to worry about NOED anyway. Or tell him about your personal problems and give him a chance to apologize if not report him.
---
Remove the speed increase and change the tiers to survivors being exposed for the next 2/3/4 survivors you hit.
---
But, BIG termite mounds. The termite mound thing was like how there are unsafe pallets just between 2 rocks in Macmillan, but instead of rocks, its, you guessed it; termite mounds. For extra decoration, you could have a few termites crawling in and out of the mounds
---
Same! That is actually a super good idea! Gosh, I'll need to think of some perks... Got me all excited for this lol
---
There should definitely be a 2 killer 8 survivor game mode of some sort
---
Trapper is the weakest killer imo, only because his only power is bear traps, which most of the time are useless unless it is a decent/good trapper. Most trappers I've seen put traps in the same spot (shack pallet/window for example) and it makes it easier to read any traps placed by a trapper, making his power weak.
---
I didn't even know they were making a third one! I'll have to look that up. Either way, I think it'd be a welcomed addition to DbD.
---
Doctor should be A atleast...
---
Literally about to do the same lmaoooo
---
You could switch Self Care for Spine Chill. Or you could switch Self Care for Decisive Strike or Borrowed Time.
---
Self Care isn't as good as it was. You could just use a Medkit and then just rush gens while injured to get Adrenaline.
---
What? No. You need learn how to read players, what are they gonna do, you need to learn how to blink, if you cant do that you will get you ass handed to you. Pick up any other killer for a few games. See how you do. Do the same with nurse and compaire.
---
U only noticed that now? hahaha
---
If you’re gonna unhook at point blank range from the killer at least use Borrowed Time or take the hit even if it means you get downed.
---
I feel like Deadhard and MoM should be switched since MoM got nerfed and he says,”Never forget about that, because that’s all we got lol”
---
You know that Legion was reworked right ? He isn't anymore a killer without counter play.
---
Yea I was debating if I put Legion at SS or S, but Huntress definitely deserves SS tier because her power is unique and nothing else is like it. She's the only killer than can hit you from a mile away, and potentially insta-down you with a certain add-on. This tier list was just my opinion though, based on the 1.4k hours in-game I have. I may change around my tier list in the future but I think this is where I'll stand on my tier list for now, just based on my experience.
---
Only if you're running whispers. Otherwise hard pass
---
My wait time was about 10 minutes on average for killer. Luckily I was able to play either killer or survivor so I switched it up for my last few games and it was instant-queues once I went survivor.
---
Serveral times already
---
Ghost Face, Clown, Doctor, Cannibal and Trapper are too high.
---
I didn't either until he pointed it out lol
---
Swap Hag and Clown
---
Honestly I think its just a phase of some people on reddit hating on self care, in a few months people will love it again, Im doing just fine with it now
---
How did you get up?
---
What kind of survivors are you playing against that can beat a Spirit with ruin? Jesus.
---
Personally, I run insidious with my Spirit; when your terror radius disappears suddenly, most survivors are tricked into thinking you've already teleported. And of course, sometimes I do run just a late teleport. The added dimension insidious brings to the table I've noticed messes with just about everybody except red ranks.
---
We will always rise they'll catch us on the Flip Flop
---
open a command prompt and run the following
---
ipconfig /dnsflush
---
close and reload steam, then launch Dead by Daylight. let me know
---
That is the point of the perk. Dodging a hit with it is very inconsistent and can easily be countered. Using it to get to safety is probably the best way ATM to use it.
---
are you me?
---
That's the correct way to use it. But 80% of survivors just use it to dodge hits.
---
Hi!
---
I’m not looking for tips I just enjoy shitting on people that think NOED is in any way balanced.
---
Oof, I've never gotten downed RIGHT by the hook before
---
Plenty
---
With my luck
---
Death &lt;-- --&gt; Death
---
Still the same thing pops up
---
Platform: Pc
---
Type of bug:Audio
---
For the past couple weeks or so the audio on survivor, killer, and in game lobby does not work correctly at all. The dead by daylight music is way too quite in lobby, all chase music is gone do not hear anything other then the heart beat, so I don’t hear any music at all just heart beat no huntress humming, no spirit noises nothing. Please check out immediately!
---
fatty!
---
Wraith's could be: Inspired by foot, the wraith will use the little blade things on the spine and dig it into their leg to drag them over, wraith then walks over to the survivor's head and starts to slowly crush it with his foot. Either that or he slams their face against a bell and he starts to flicker like an old lightbulb.
---
Trapper's: The trapper sets a beartrap down infront of the survivor and grabs them by the back of their collar and slams their face into the beartrap, The survivor will scream in pain until the trapper uses his hands to close the trap even further.
---
Burrowed Time: When you unhook somebody in the killer's Terror Radius, you and that person are underground for 30 seconds
---
(one of) My main counterplays to deadhard is hitting people while vaulting.  I love watching a freshly hit David run to a window.  I just bide my time and get the down.  
---
I think DH is perfectly balanced as is.  You have to be intentionally with your usage, but it can easily save you
---
Stake Out? Of all the survivor perks to complain about...Stake Out? I am at a loss for words at the sheer salt and stupidity of the person complaining about that.
---
they take like 15 seconds to do and if u all just stumble across 1 each and someone finds 2 then wow
---
Sorry, i told you wrong. i haven't worked with windows network in six months.
---
it should be
---
ipconfig /flushdns
---
let me know what the output is when you run that command, it should say something about successfully flushed something
---
Nobody will be able to understand because the people who say legion is a bad killer don’t actually know anything about legion.
---
I feel like Tatum's would be something offensive toward the killer, since she put up quite a fight against Ghostface. The escape plan was the only issue lol. For Helen, maybe something with being chased. Not sure about Sasha though.
---
It was on Xbox
---
Stridor on spirit? Damn no wonder she needs noed
---
Successfully flushed the DNS Resolver Cache but still says my status is offline
---
This "ass backwards logic" has been upvoted before when I saw it in a comment somewhere else on this sub.
---
Diversion is fun to play with but really niche and experienced killers tend to not fall for diversion plays.
---
Deliverance is a good perk but some matches will be useless if you are found first or play stupidly and don’t get the safe unhook. 
---
DS is great for tunnelling killers as really punishes them and puts you back into the game, on PS I find myself getting to use DS a lot but is a dead perk slot on a lot of occasions also. 
---
I would probably recommend Adam as you are interested in two of the perks &amp; hope DS shows up in shrine if not interested in Laurie as a skin, DS tends to show up every other month on the shrine it feels like lol.
---
That's not what this is about, try rereading it.
---
Is this GF only?
---
Laurie has DS and Object which are useful perks.
---
Pebble is trash, Deliverance is good but DS is better, so i'd go with laurie.
---
And you know how it goes, if you run deliverance you'll always be the first to get hooked.
---
Leatherface lower than Freddy? Legion in S tier?
---
ok, run the following command, then reboot computer (even though it's been done several times already)
---
netsh winsock reset
---
let me know what the output of the command is.
---
OMG please kill the Doctor ear rape bug with fire.
---
Explain why plague is so low? I’m mid lvl like 10-12 and she is a nightmare
---
What's DS exactly?
---
I almost disagree with everything lol
---
I've only been playing since April this year so it helps a lot. Plus it's free blood points and a counter to Noed.
---
You really decided to comment on a 3 day old discussion to essentially tell me, "PEOPLE GAVE A COMMENT INTERNET POINTS SO I'M RIGHT"
---
Ain't seeing many upvotes on your comment though, bud.
---
Successfully reset the Winsock Catalog and tells me to restart my computer
---
Myers weaker than Legion...
---
You're both gay, now kiss uwu
---
Why would you look for dull totems against devour hope?
---
Devs would need to nerf Adrenaline and Medkits to the ground for people to love Self Care again.
---
People just got bored of self caring in corners with Sloppy Butcher on them while their teammates die on hook. 
---
Exhaustion perks, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike and Borrowed Time are the meta right now. At least these are the perks I see the most in red ranks.
---
I wonder if these threads will ever end.
---
good start. let's reboot and try DbD again
---
We are all each other on this blessed day
---
Never
---
I play both sides, and very rarely run noed on my killers cause I find that perk stupid.
---
Either of these would be nice changes imo:
---
\-If you cleansed a totem this game, you are immune to noed
---
OR
---
\-Noed only activates if you sacrificed/killed 1 survivor already.
---
I like the second one better, so at least you have to do something in the game before you can casually 4k with noed after doing nothing the entire game.
---
Cool
---
Fun fact: Just like Bill, Jake's eye (iris) colours are light blue not brown like some people think it is.  So him being Bill's grandson isn't that far fetch (if they are actually related).
---
DISTRESSING
---
And this is why Freddy is best killer
---
Yeah I love getting SWF all with 1k+ hours it's really enjoyable as someone who is learning killer :)
---
unfortunately, the problem is still there :(
---
Can't you just... Close the hatch?
---
I'm gonna do a Pig build with Devour Hope, Haunted Ground, Make Your Choice, and NOED
---
That’s why I’m learning billy, he’s the most balanced killer with actual power and takes skill.
---
Start with Meg and Claudette. They both have 3 useful teachables to add to your perk pool.
---
quick question, are you able to play any other steam games that require online functionality?
---
Hi Carl
---
Let me just spam the fuck out of that control button to show how superior i am for hitting a skillcheck 8)
---
I know that many already noticed it, but i posted it for those who didnt.
---
More like every time I put on borrowed time I go against a freddy making the perk worthless
---
Tatum’s Perk
---
Doggie Door
---
Any chance to escape is a chance worth taking. Vault windows and pallets (10%/15%/20%) faster, and while vaulting, you are immune to taking damage. Immunity to damage has a cool down of (100/80/60) seconds
---
Sasha’s Perk
---
Broadcast
---
Your cries for help alert your allies. While in a chase, the auras of you and the killer are revealed to all survivors within (20/30/40) meters. Whenever you are hit, auras of generators, chests, survivors, and exit gates within (20/30/40) meters of a survivor are revealed, but only to the survivors in range of them.
---
Helen’s Perk
---
Current Reigning
---
You have a reputation to protect. While you are the obsession, good skill checks have a (10%/15%/20%) chance of becoming great skill checks, and failed skill checks have a (20%/40%/60%) chance of becoming good skill checks. When you are unhooked, your rescuer becomes the obsession. You perform altruistic actions (15%/30%/45%) faster on the obsession
---
These numbers are probably fucked, but I did this very quickly lol
---
Unlock a useless teachable or keep having it show up in your bloodweb while you try to level up.
---
This is the real "Make Your Choice."
---
Leatherface is easily the worst killer, and a good Legion deserves S tier
---
sorry, i had worded that poorly. they could have lasted until the servers crashed.
---
Well, this tier list was just my opinion
---
I actually haven't tried that let me install some games and get back to you later .
---
should we continue talking in dms?
---
You can’t reproduce this bug it’s completely random, how can you abuse it?
---
Sounds dope! Dude, BHVR, make this stuff happen! lol I'm sure the numbers could be fixed or are fine, I can't tell. I love it either way!!
---
Just my opinion, I think Myers is a tier below because Legion in Frenzy is more powerful than Myers in Tier 3 (against any good survivor).
---
This bug is fucking hilarious lmao I crack up every time I see it
---
Ah, nice you have friends. I'm a lone wolf, but at least I can manage to do well with fandoms too.
---
I was selected for killer only, but at least I got to catch up on shows between matches.
---
Plag is way too high
---
I think the path is missing something, should look like this:
---
 Program File (x86)&gt;steam&gt;steamapps&gt;common&gt;Dead by Daylight&gt;DeadByDaylight &gt; Content &gt; UI &gt; Icons &gt; Perks
---
Adiris is half pizza half vommy mommy &lt;3
---
Laurie is probably the best survivor option though. DS and OoO are both good perks, and you can get the rest (Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Self-Care, Adrenaline) for free since you only have to grind those characters till the teachables and doN't have to buy them
---
i actually prefer to keep it public, that way if we fix it and some other poor bastard has the same issue, maybe they'll see a potential fix in this thread.
---
Could I get this picture without the captions by chance?
---
It's probably because there's (IIRC) literally only two secret offerings for killer. Shroud of Separation is rarely used, and on top of that, the survivors can tell that SoS isn't used as soon as the match begins if any of them spawn next to each other. So a mori is extremely obvious, when it's supposed to be secret.
---
Yesterday I got hooked right outside the Blood Lodge and I saw a Nea making her way to me. Once she reached the lodge, she *started working on the generator and completely ignored me* (we had no gens done)
---
I only got off because Adam ran over and did Nea's job for her.
---
At the end i made it to the exit, but died because the killer had NOED.
---
Id say spirit's tier should be above the "hidden face" tier.
---
Yes but not the place. Check out r/dbdLFG
---
Probably a bad time to ask but if you're on PS4 do you want another player to play with or practice killer with?
---
No true infinites but definitely loops that can't even gain bloodlust. So it comes down to survivors royally fucking them up, so sure. *Technically*, no infinites anymore.
---
I love black Christmas and love how you made this... honestly made my day and I thank you &lt;3
---
It’s bad when the killer is camping the hook and teabagging the whole time. I actually had a ghostface do that to me last night, managed to get off the hook and he caught up to me, I juked him and escaped and then he quit the match.
---
Big girl got angry
---
I see you picked her up by the buttthole.
---
A man of culture
---
So you think getting and easy first hit and putting someone on a useless timer is stronger than having the ability to instadown the entire team? Good survivors will have an easier time against Legion than they would Myers
---
Well from the banners they were numbered so 1 was wraith and feng second was Dwight and huntress 3rd was black outfit pig and tapp and the last one was urban pig with cop tapp
---
I can join servers in another multiplayer game
---
How was this oops? You straight up got that survivor killed
---
a power that makes you a bit faster, cant ever down, and has a guranteed stun.at the end is stronger than one that gives like 5 different buffs including 1 shot down and insane lunge? tf
---
I don't like the range add-ons. They mess with my muscle memory. I'm perfectly happy playing Nurse without add-ons, but if I'm gonna run them, Campbell's Last Breath is quite nice when combined with the add-on that slightly increases your range (negating the difference in range).
---
The problem with not requiring video evidence is that people could make false reports. 
---
BHVR would have to implement game replays where each game is recorded and they can watch the game to ensure it is not a false report
---
I agree with most of it. I would personally have clown on his own tier in the pits of hell...but that's me being dramatic.
---
No, Legion in Frenzy can vault pallets and windows which counters survivors majorly. Myers in tier 3 is very strong yes, however, if a good survivor can run him long enough he won't be able to use his power to his full advantage
---
outplayed by a noob with noed lmao
---
let's check to see if Steam is offline :
---
In Steam, choose the menu Steam -&gt; Go to online mode.
---
let me know if steam is in offline mode. also, what game did you join a multiplayer game? if they don't use steam's infrastructure, then the test is null
---
I wanna start running blood warden just for these people
---
The only time I accept a DC is when the killer is a nurse.
---
I just can't blame people for DCing against a killer that ignores every single mechanic in the game.
---
Tbh I barely see Rancor as toxic, and I don’t see Ruin or DH as toxic, also seeing the Morris is kinda fun lol. However I get a little bit annoyed when I see notes but not really looool.
---
I can DCing is wrong. If you dont want to play nurse play another game. Thats like a killer dcing after seeing a SWF.
---
My steam is online
---
can you give me some examples of games that use steam's infrastrusture (I join a lobby in HumanFallFlat)
---
I'd argue Freddy is better than Leatherface.
---
Leatherface has a chainsaw that is a bitch to land because the "frenzy" LOVES to end half an inch from connecting meaning it was all for nothing and I wasted my time when I should have M1'd, even if I do the charge almost point blank. Sure it insta-downs but I'm lucky if I can land it more than once or twice a match. He really *does* feel only good for camping.
---
Freddy has: Built in stealth via invisibility, the lullaby being harder to discern distance compared to heartbeat, and a smaller actual terror radius in the dream world. Built in slow-down on slept survivors and being able to read their auras outside of the terror radius.
---
He can also get a first hit pretty easily as survivors have no idea where you are until you begin sleeping them so you can "herd" survivors towards dead zones by standing on certain sides before sleeping them so they run *away* from you and towards a dead zone. 
---
If survivors disrespect the transition and keep working on stuff, and you use transition shorteners or pill bottle to hide freddy glimpses, free gen-grabs. Red Paint Brush and Z-block with Monitor and Abuse gives you 0 terror radius in dream world (and perfect aura reading outside of a chase) and a 3 second dream transition which is pants-pissing for survivors and like Mirror Myers on crack. 
---
In terms of "They'll just wake eachother up!" you can deny the self-care wakeup by not hitting them until you're ready to try to down them (I see another target during a chase I'm sleeping him and either continuing my original chase or disengaging to either find more targets, or chase the new target) and if you see the aura crouching, someone's waking them so you now have 2 more survivors to go sleep. (Guy being woken up and the guy doing the waking) 
---
Same with unhooks, return to the hook to at least sleep the hooked guy again, and the unhooked. 
---
Freddy's better than expected with the right playstyle but playing him like any other killer (Sleeping and tunneling one guy to death) will get you a bad time. He has NO advantage in a chase (Besides that easy first hit once you begin the sleep transition and they're at a gen) can't defend for jack shit, (I don't even know if the sleep transition has an action speed penalty, even then a guy on your totem = it being destroyed so only hex I use is haunted grounds or NOED) and his only way to deal with pallets is let them be dropped on his face but he has good built in stall, tracking, and can choose when and where to engage based on that. He's also unbodyblockable from awake survivors (Besides that FUCKING AUTOAIM) and very hard to flashlight stun from awake survivors. 
---
I think Freddy is better than people assume, but he's the thinking man's killer and there's a ton of strategizing when playing him. I think he's actually stronger the more gens are done because less gens = less places to wake up, and if you never hit them until you're ready to try and down them they can't self-care themselves awake.
---
This is the content I sort by new for
---
Getting hit by a pallet fixed it but whenever I try to get a survivor to drop one they think I’m farming and dc when they find out otherwise.
---
hmm. let's go ahead and attempt to verify the game's cache files 
---
https://inxile.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004662908-Verify-game-cache-files-Steam-
---
Nothing’s worse than using your best add-on’s and the survivors are so bad you don’t even get to use them before they’re all dead.
---
I use it frequently and also nO oNe’s EvEr uSeD hYpErBoLe oN rEddIt. 
---
Inb4: u googled hYpErBoLe grow up looser
---
In the end, every survivor is essentially the same, since you unlock all the perks for each of them.  
---
However, rn, just play whoever's perks/design you like the best.  
---
If you really want suggestions, though, I'd recommend:  
---
Nea - This is my #1 recommendation. Very balanced base kit.  Balanced Landing helps in chases, while Urban Evasion let's you crouch at walking speed, so is very good for stealth.  Her 3rd perk is Streetwise, which reduces your and teammates' item consumption rates, aiding with healing or doing gens.  All of these perks are good and useful to have.  
---
Meg - My personal favorite.  An escape artist, of sorts.  Someone else mentioned her earlier, so I won't go into depth.  
---
Finally, Feng has decent perks, for now.  Lithe, I especially love, and makes escaping a lot easier.  You can use this perk for the life of the game.  Her generator perk helps if you mess up skill checks too, though I'd switch this out once you get good with skill checks.  Her last perk isn't too great as you rank up either.  Spine chill basically nullifies any need for it, honestly.
---
Too bad, I've already tried that *crying emoji*
---
Sure.
---
It was good for the game.
---
I played mostly killer and a few games as survivor, and every one of my games from both sides resulted in either a 3k or a 4k, aside from one match I played as survivor and we all escaped versus Legion. Another match was an exception when I played Leatherface, I'll add details below. Literally every single other game was determined by if the last survivor or the killer found the hatch first.
---
I played as Billy, Myers, Doctor and Leatherface.
---
Leatherface's chainsaw ability is so much more worse without add-ons, holy crap that charge is slow. You basically have to have someone completely cornered in order to have the time to charge it up and down them. I played only one game as him, and ended up getting 1 chainsaw down early on, but the rest of the game they ran me around like crazy. I ended up stopping a chase versus one survivor who was really decent at looping, and downed another one with a couple of m1 hits as they were trying to open a gate. Once I hooked them, another survivor opened the gate, and for some reason the 2 that could have left decided to go for the hook save and I ended up chainsawing them all and got a 4k from it. Overall it was totally avoidable and this is the only game where really post-game chat was toxic. They were giving me shit for camping, but it was a survivor on a hook close to an open gate, what am I supposed to do??
---
Anyway, I played Myers on Coldwind and got looped like crazy, but my tier 3 insta-down completely saved me. I only went into t3 twice, but downed 3 survivors total with it. Even though they could see me from a mile away and lose me in the corn, they were constantly injured. To your point, it made a huge difference in how the flow of the game felt when they felt vulnerable like that. After the first 2 gens popped, I just kept hooking over and over and they completely lost their momentum.
---
The Doctor games I played were the only games I had somewhat reliable tracking, and boy was it needed. The lack of any tracking on any of the other killers made it rough to find them in general. Without any Doctor add-ons, I didn't really have the range to shock them all that much to counter window vaults or looping, so I essentially stopped shocking and went into punishment mode and was an m1 killer once they were in madness 3. I also had the perfect 3 gen location strategy in two of my games, and the hatch spawned in between all of the gens in one of those games. 3 survivors were left with 1 gen to go both times, and they were unable to complete it. It felt pretty cheap to be honest, but it turned into a game of patience with me having the advantage. In one of those 3 gen strategy games, one survivor just came up to me and gave up, letting me get the kill, and in the other game 2 survivors gave up after they were making zero progress on getting gens done.
---
The Billy games were by far the easiest. It helped I had all open outdoor maps, but map control won the day for me on the Billy games, just like in a normal DbD game.
---
All in all I ended up with 6.5 average hooks per game on Myers, 3k and 4k.
---
With Billy I had 7 average hooks per game, 4 games with a 4k and one game with a 3k (hatch).
---
With the Doctor I had 7.5 average hooks per game, one 3k (hatch) and two 4ks.
---
With Leatherface I had 7 average hooks per game, and got a 4k.
---
This is what I got in terms of maps:
---
Autohaven x7
---
Coldwind x3
---
Macmillan x1
---
Haddonfield x1
---
Springwood x1
---
Crotus Prenn x1
---
Swamp x1
---
One difference between our experiences is that I saw almost no hook trading. I actually felt like it was worth it to just run away from the hooks to try to get people off of another gen, so I knew at least 3 people were not doing gens, at least for a limited period of time, when someone was on the hook. It really felt like much more of a snowball effect as a killer because of this.
---
I'm really curious if they share the results of this, I'd be curious to hear their conclusions. It'd be great if they could share the numbers and describe more exactly what they were trying to get from this overall. I haven't heard anything else about the reward, hopefully it's something cool! One thing that sucked is that the killer queues were about 10 minutes long. I had to switch to survivor to finish out my games otherwise I would have ran out of time.
---
Yeah I get that.
---
The survivor's strategy before EGC was: B-line towards the hatch and wait for the killer to hit you, free escape or standoff.
---
Have you tried to make sure your steam is on Online mode? Think it's top left of the steam client click on Steam see if it's online or offline
---
i missed the last part of your question, off the top of my head i can't, as i'm at work.
---
Well, that explains my name lmao
---
fuck. ok, i'm leaving work, let me head home, and i'll see if i can come up with anything from there.
---
Myers is stronger than legion.
---
tried switching it on-off
---
Careful- the mods don’t like it when show every day encounters on DBD.
---
People like to say this is because everyone is playing Ghostface, but that is untrue. Not only is Ghostface already not that popular anymore, but killer queues have been taking upwards of 5 minutes for quite a while now, long before Ghostface was released. There are simply not enough survivors queueing, and then BHVR is also messing with the matchmaking system, which apart from finally getting rid of bugged 3-survivor-lobbies, has not really been beneficial as far as I can tell.
---
It's ok just help me when you're free since you're actually doing more than DBD support already
---
You’re only gonna be using FF if you haven’t gotten the first hit on them, after that you’re better just taking yourself out of FF because you’re completely unlethal while in the power. FF is only really useful for first hits, past that you’re a basic M1 killer, and why play a basic M1 killer that puts people on a useless timer when you can play a basic M1 killer who can instadown? The mobility of FF isn’t anywhere near as important as it once was, you have to stun yourself after using the power to be lethal and that gives the survivors a ton of time to create distance between the 2 of you.
---
My favorite was actually as killer. There was this toxic dickbag Feng Min who would try to reveal teammates who hide in lockers fully on purpose(figured it out pretty fast because he would stand in front of the locker pointing at it)
---
I downed him and let the guy in the locker run away, and he dc'ed on hook. Got him in the next game, he did the same thing. Both times if I didn't end up killing the guy he revealed by the end of the game, I gave them the hatch.
---
He bitched in end chat with "Shitty hiding teammates need to learn somehow"
---
It was satisfying making him DC both times.
---
No, I thank YOU, you kind so-and-so. &lt;3
---
This seems like promo...im a little unsure?
---
Ah I didn’t know that but with it being over a toolbox I think it might be okay. Hopefully
---
If only you could get it on console...
---
Yea you have a point
---
Random
---
There's also Splinters. I was so sad when my last Freddy splinter was lost due to an infinite loading screen after I bought Freddy. Was a hilarious way to fake having a Mori since survivors don't spawn separated.
---
I've also had times where we still spawned in pairs or all 4 in the killer shack and it was a shroud of separation the entire time.
---
wholesome
---
To have replays is a useless feature with 2/3 of the market doing that automatically I’m just giving an option on pc to have replays if you wanna use them to get better thats all
---
Some people act like there isn't another person you're facing off against... Like, you're playing with other people here, they ain't here to be a punching bag, they're here to do the exact same thing.
---
To play a video game. Maybe even play it to get away from something. Being greeted with death threats and other forms of toxicity isn't exactly "encouraging" in a good way. The best I can say it just report it and try to move on. What some random person says on the internet doesn't matter because you know who you are, you know what you're worth. Don't let them define who you are.
---
Also, lets look at this logically. Why would they care about NOED when they didn't even get one gen done?
---
I actually hate that Open Handes is on a survivor *without* aura reading. I also toyed with the idea that Open Handed would make perks into a 2 way feed. Bond and Empathy would show you to your team and not just show them to you. That might make Open Handed somewhat useful.
---
My idea for it:
---
Open Handed connects aura reading between survivors. Survivors share in your aura reading at 50/75/100% range.
---
Example: If you run bond, not only do you see survivors at 36 meters, they'd see you at 18/27/36 meters. It would take up 2 slots so it might feel strong due to the ability to share such free info, but you'd lose out on a potential second chance perk like DS or Adrenaline.
---
Also not allowed to shame others. All usernames should be censored
---
....wat
---
Kindred. It shows the killer at a close range. With an infinite range buff, your team would ALWAYS know where the killer is at. The game would be insanely easy for survivors since getting hooked with this combo would destroy stealth killers.
---
Either Ghostface Plague or Spirit
---
Sorry for the screen glare
---
Damn, Republic Commando?
---
Probably SWF, or the game just really messed up
---
You’re either a troll
---
Trash 
---
Or 
---
You’ve never actually played the game
---
My Killer rank is 11 and I had a Rank 3 survivor. Balanced matchmaking is fun!
---
I realized that after I posted. Not trying to promote just wanted to let people know about this. It's just something cool we're putting on and would love community involvement. I put the name to it so people know this isn't just some half baked idea. We want to put the work in and do something fun for the community
---
Thank you.
---
Keep rereading the post until you understand. It'll happen soon.
---
Or I've been playing since 2017 and the game is just doo doo in its current iteration
---
i would
---
This is so cool
---
And as I said they won’t the new perspective is cool but the only way you’ll get it is through asking the other players since they have more important things to work on
---
my suggestion for totems, for new players and totem hunters alike:
---
leave obvious line-of-sight totems up. 
---
time dedicated to popping all 5 totems is detrimental to your team in most every case. you make noise, you arent pressuring gens or keeping the killer busy. so many cases, even with small game, you wont be able to take all 5. and even then, so often the killer wont even have NOED. do your best to destroy only very cleverly hidden totems, narrowing down the oppression of NOED, sometimes allow you to disarm it within moments.  (the recent patches have improved ruin spawns to a noticeable extent). keep a mental note of where all obvious totems are, and in the case of NOED, seek to break them ASAP. 
---
There is always a balance and nuance to what decisions to make, but looking to pop all 5 totems every game is not the answer.
---
Oh the irony.
---
I love when a survivor wastes time at blinding me at a pallet. When i first joined the game over a year ago i used to run lightborn because audio was iffy and i just in general wasnt used to the sounds so i could still get them if they tried blinding at a pallet. Now i just follow the audio with the grass or them grunting if they’re injured and when i become unblind i see them right in front of me. One of the best feelings in the game seeing the survivor 3 feet in front after you follow the audio from a pallet blind
---
Matchmaking is just ass. My friend and I are in red ranks and we get queued with greens regularly.
---
Lose Overwhelming for Huntresses lullaby
---
Hag doesn't really need hex perks, Panda plays her without hexes, and Hag main, Space Coconut does it as well. Probably not so great Hag or she fcked up. Or got Rotten fields, bleh
---
They just need to remove or fix Ranks.
---
Well are you going to start shitting on me or not? I haven't seen an insult or a cogent point from you yet.
---
This happened it me as well! Great, more game-breaking bugs
---
&gt;current year
---
&gt;still using xD 
---
GrOw uP lOoSeR
---
Don’t you mean deja vu. It’s the new secret ability.
---
Your lack of intelligence to understand my first comment that shit all over NOED doesn’t mean it didn’t happen, it just means you’re dumber than I thought.
---
Yeah, mostly because rank does nothing
---
Lol what's the original image again.
---
Man this is the lamest roast ever. BOOOOOO
---
Mah boi fuze slamming the hostage
---
He sucks now and easy to counter lol
---
Did not expect to see thomas here
---
I don't know why, I want to know this too. They don't even suck to play against in my opinion, they're just a killer with extreme pressure capabilities. When I play legion I hardly have a hard finding anyone. And that makes them fun to play against in my opinion. They are just always THERE.
---
Clown still looks tasty af
---
Thank you for the recommendations, I'll give Nea a try.
---
Now this I can get behind
---
For an april fools, they should get rid of the heavy metal music and replace it with 'fifi the flower pot' theme. 
---
Please, let it happen.
---
Not sure, but i think its just any attack.
---
I think they may have done that because some people crawled through the gate but didn't actually eacape. There was a bug that you'd just lay there and die until the entity gets you.
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
*Insidious Bubba silently protecting the basement chest*
---
ROFL, there's actually a comment in this thread *crying* about nerfs to MoM, pallets, and DS??? 
---
Like does that person not understand that MoM was unbeatable without tunneling? 
---
Do they not realize that catching someone with old DS meant they got away unless you juggled them? 
---
Does that person ALSO not know that no map should have over 20 safe pallets or double pallets or infinite loops with pallets or pallet vacuums? That shit was all broken. 
---
Meanwhile, NOED is to help people *catch up* because they played a killer without map pressure versus the onslaught of instant repair generators.
---
NOED doesn't reward failure, it's a means of countering gen rushing. The survivors either stop repairs to cleanse totems, or they die because they blasted through gens. If they choose the latter option, it still has counterplay through looping well or cleansing the *single* NOED totem. But NOED is really for people who acknowledge that they don't have any early pressure on their killers and want to make up for that with endgame pressure.
---
Sure, you're entitled to your opinion. I just wish you wouldn't downvote me so this will be seen and can actually be discussed.
---
It's sad but you'd be surprised how many people do I have this type of logical thinking.
---
They're aware how to prevent certain situations but if they ever experienced it or lose to it instead of blaming themselves they'll tend to blame everything else around them. Despite the fact they clearly know their own mistake
---
Head on. Apply directly to the forehead.
---
Would Hillbilly's count as no toppings?
---
Run back through the gate and it makes you escape. Happened to me a few days ago so I just charged at the killer and it ended up just making me do the escape sequence
---
I’ll get em dead, show em what I got
---
I think they're okay to use if they're going to die on the hook anyway. I just get annoyed when killers tunnel someone their first time off the hook so they can guarantee a mori. It ruins the experience of that trial.
---
Pkay thanks. Try that next time
---
oof no idea buddy, good luck solving it tho
---
Excuse me *wat the fuk*
---
Pyramidhead won't make it because of Kojima
---
Thx
---
Michael who? All I see are Ghostfaces out there
---
It's God. New killer leak.
---
The worst part was I wasn't even basement camping.  I would hook and chase across map, they just kept leading me back to their friends.  The best part was getting the last kill by pulling dwight out of a locker.
---
It was I can send you it if u want
---
I mean both legion and Amanda and even I don't think they're that high.
---
Legion's power can be best described as annoying other than that it's pretty lackluster.
---
Honestly the only thing that Legion's power gives them is the fact that they are the killer that can utilise thanatophobia the best.
---
1) The 4 seconds stun
---
2) The reduced movement speed
---
3) Timed based power
---
4) The recharge requirement
---
All of this together makes an ability that doesn't offer any lethal qualities very lackluster. As I said you're more likely to just annoy the survivors than you are to be an actual threat.
---
Amanda isn't weak she just needs tweaks that's pretty much it but she's definitely not as strong as some of the other Killers.
---
“With every bug we fix, two more shall take its place”
---
Yeah I’ve had stuff booted off before for “showing salty chat” lol
---
I think its the rng thing
---
you need to hook a different for the first time. hooking the same survivor won't get you another stack
---
*gets hit with franklin's demise*
---
Now this one, this one got them all right where they belong.
---
OMG UR A CAMPUR STOP CAMPING /s
---
Oh my dude that’s nothing. I was playing huntress on the chapel when I found someone within 30 seconds and downed them. They DC’d then their friend added me. Their friend demanded proof I wasn’t lag switching by me recording my gameplay and sending it to them. They then later reported me for lag switching.
---
he gon snack Scooby later
---
Same thing happened to me. It only happened once but I had DS and a claudette flashlight saved me but I also hit DS at the same time, so I thought I wasted it, but when the killer picked me back up after downing me later on in the game, it did that.
---
The bigger the mound the more termites to eat the pallets. I like it.
---
;{
---
Dont say sorry. Its necessary.
---
I found a survivor when I was on the chapel playing as huntress. I downed him in 30 seconds using the old hatchet and hit tactic. He instantly DC’ed. His friend then added me, demanding that I record my gameplay and send it to him or he would report me for “lag switching”. Funniest shit
