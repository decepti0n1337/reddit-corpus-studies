Nurse is good Bc she counters Pallets and windows. Its not bc she has few counters (she does have few counters) its bc she counters what the meta is based off of. Spirit cant break pallets and cant vault while and spirit mode. Yes she is a good killer, But you can mind game her if you are good
---
---
---
Spirit's drawback is her phase sound, basically nullifies her power supossing the survivors are not deaf.
---

---
THAT SAID, Prayer Beads with Discordance, Surveillance and Nurses Calling makes her the best killer in the game with basically no counter to it.
---
BUT that means she's dependant on a purple add on, which Nurse isn't, so that's why I'm ok with Nurse being S Tier and Spirit being A Tier. She's better than Billy though.
---
Urban Evasion + Iron Will
---
Spirit makes the game a big brain competition 
---
Yes
---
Welcome! to dead by daylight brother 
---
Yikes - a five-way disconnect.
---
I can change that
---
No, you have a bad connection. That's called lag. Game runs great for me as long as that bar is green in the lobby.
---
Don't hurt my susie 
---
This is just a shitty cropped Ver of someones art they posted on this sub
---
heavy panting ensues
---
yeah you could probably safety pip or even pip in a 1v1. do like half a gen before a killer finds you, then get chased for 8k boldness aslong as it’s not an op killer. don’t have to be good, just need to know what you’re doing.
---
HAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAH, you underestimate me, how do you know she is not already hurt?
---
Because susie is cute and she didn't want to go alone 
---
They can’t without dedicated servers 
---
What have you done to her!
---
"Well...this is my life now"
---
Her and nea brother, oh and the huntress. I have lots of stuff that no one else has seen before, my personal collection 
---
Survivor: *dead hards into a wall*
---
Eat all the pallets.. nom nom!! Just bluntly chase a survivor the boring way until you catch them 
---
What did you do to susie! She's top cute and innocent!
---
She is a q t though
---
Top cute is nea mate, But Yes i commission lots of things 
---
The devs said that for chapter 11 it’s gonna be the oldest killer yet and many people speculated a mummy
---
There is a counter: When you are in a chase with her, look at her. If she stops it probably means she is phasing to reach at you faster. However, she can only see your scratch marks. Don't run, walk in another direction and she will probably lose time trying to find you again. 
---
And if you have a bucket full of black jelly beans and add two white jelly beans, that doesn't mean your bucket is diverse. It's more diverse than before, but not diverse. 
---
I never said I owned it. I just forgot I had it saved on my phone 
---
Spirit is definitely a PvE killer, and her add-ons are overtuned, but when compared to Nurse I don't think she needs nerfs to her power itself, but her add-ons (especially Prayer Beads, Wakazashi/Tsuba and Yakyoke need changes)
---
Nea and susie have the same animation when selecting the character we'll call it a draw..
---
But what did you draw?
---
oFFerings in general shouldn't be used until the game starts at the very least.
---
But could you really hurt Susie? Really?
---
Legion mains need to make dolls to keep them company since no survivor wants to play with them D: ^^/s
---
But is it relevant? Nurse is still inarguably the most overpowered killer in the game, regardless of how it is on console. Especially considering the only reason why she isn't strong on console is because of the garbage FPS which makes it borderline unplayable, Nurse is still stronger than Spirit objectively speaking, there is no argument to be had, using garbage-optimization as a way to argue is asinine, because it will EVENTUALLY™ get fixed, and then Nurse will also be the most powerful killer on console in practice. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also you never specified console so I don't see your point anyways. There is no Spirit build that is on the same level as omegablink, which is also lower rarity than Spirit's OP shit.
---
You can work it out easily from here: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Player_Level
---
Super cute and thick
---
Lol fav moment with my meg I was playing with this streamer and saw the killer approaching and casualy "soooo do you have sprintburst?" He said no. Killer came uncloaked and I zipped away"gooood luck with that"
---
An all time classic.
---
LMAO, this is me as Meg with any killer suddenly running behind me.
---
There’s no way that little of her clothes are left 
---
Oh fuck me I laughed hard at this one. Made my chest hurt.
---
Those were the days lmao. I look back on old videos of the game and it looks/feels/plays so different it’s crazy.
---
Dedicated servers need to come now
---
Look at the description of them.. "what's left of what she wore that night"
---
Nice [Orson Welles](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VFevH5vP32s)  reference at the end there.
---
run iron maiden and profit.
---
Did they nerf bloodhound on the new map? I ran it three tierd on my wraith and even cloaked barely saw blood even right under survivors
---
I literally said this today 😭😂
---
The true grind for bp 
---
Wait. What are the clear, direct counters for Nurse??? She literally blinks through walls and shit. And the fatigue is not even an issue when playing Nurse. Find surv, get a hit in 2 seconds, fatigue, then 3 seconds later down a survivor.
---
Played against a Huntress today (PS4). All she did it was proximity camping. Ended with a 4k because when we unhook someone, she just tunneling. Horrible game and can't even report (and curse the little cunt)
---
I mean that may be the description, but there’s literally now way that’s what’s left unless he chucked her into a meat grinder
---
It's literally not a non-issue. If I'm playing Killer and get 3 kills before the 3rd generator is over, why am I essentially obligated to reward a Survivor for getting outplayed? The hatch stand-off is weighted _very_ heavily in the Survivor's favor, because they dictate when it's over. At full health, a swing guarantees them hatch. When injured, they just need to be close enough (which is what the standoff is) and it's guaranteed again. The _only_ way Killer reliably wins is if the Survivor jumps in before either of these two conditions. That coupled with the fact how much DS is run means that it's highly likely that even if you get the hatch grab, they stab you and get hatch anyway. I can't wait for the end-game rework enough because it's absolutely absurd for the Killer to be powerless in a 1v1 situation versus a Survivor.
---
Shirtless. 
---
People who complain about legend=people who dc once they know its legion
---
infinite duress? isn’t that warwicks ult from league lol.
---
She’s my favorite! I used her online clothes guidelines for Susie’s Hoodie. &lt;3
---
The killer isn’t powerless, you can find them before they get to the hatch. If you don’t like hatch standoffs don’t do them 
---
Yes because it’s 100% always possible to get chased for an 8k in boldness and knowing what you are doing doesn’t matter since the killers are always faster then you are
---
I didn't make the game... hell I barely play her.. I don't have a killer main I just like the look of susie.. I find trapper fun to play
---
its possible if the killer isn’t op. there’s enough pallets on the map.
---
Self care? Flashlight with add-on? Swf being the massive crutch it is by itself?
---
not true. nurse is harder to use on console but if you put the effort she is just as overpowered in the console versions
---
the reason you dont see her used on console is because its even harder to master her when she was already the killer with the steepest learning curve
---
and yes ik the killer is faster lmao that’s what looping pallets and windows are for
---
It does. The Obsession is still technically dead in that scenario. 
---
Only those who use that word are worthy of the title imo, ever heard of self projection?
---
Shhhh you’re bad
---
It took my game 1.5 hours to fully install when I got it a couple years ago. Then another 45 minutes for all the DLCs to download. It’s rough. But so worth it. 
---
I’ve heard people say this before and I agree. Although I never really play killer because of the hate mail. 
---
The chances are higher for the killer, and with the killer being able to hit you over and through pallets it’s almost always a GG unless they are trash at chasing
---
I had this happen on PC and checked the killer and survivor steam profiles and they were a couple.  This type of shit shouldn't happen but it does. I'm sure it's not hard to group up like this on the same network. 
---
There was no need to t-bag... Kind of took away the amazement. 
---
Use Windstorm and Swift Hunt and you'll have a really fun time.
---
Oh crap, I was replying to a reply to my comment, Reddit posted it as a comment, sorry
---
You’re welcome. Unless I’m dead on hook then I apologize you’re going to have to take one for the team. 
---
If I play survivor, I like going against Trappers and Michaels, because Trappers are usually nice and they actually force you to pay attention to your surroundings, same as Myers, who is fun to play against because of them jumpscares and the panic when you hear evil within tier up sound (Only thing I hate are tombstones, but what can you do)
---
Playing killer, Myers, again is my favourite, because there is so much diversity in playstyles. I like wraith too for his lore and for the sound of hitting someone (I don't know why, but it's quite satisfying) plus he is quite quick and if you can properly hide your shimmer when you are cloaked, it makes really good jumpscares too.
---
I love playing Myers.
---
 I live for those early game jumpscares with Evil Within 1 and those multi downs at Evil Within 3: Speed Stabbing Edition.
---
You better touch my armpits once I'm hooked, though.
---
An all time classic
---
Wraith because he can body block and has small terror radius. Also has nice map pressure ability with cloaked speed and can find survivors easy as he sneaks up on them 
---
It gives you a sound and visual notification that's very easy to notice now.  It gets annoying on maps with multiple crows in a row though cause it's like a line of generators blowing up in a row as the survivor runs by them all.
---
Try to gain madness on all survivors max at least once, that way, you will still gain some benefits if they snap out of it.
---
Explosive Escape
---
You know how to make a flashy exit.
---
When healthy, upon getting hit, release small explosion of light, blinding the killer for 1.5/2.0/2.5 seconds. When this perk activates, you create no scratch marks for 3 seconds. This perk has a 90 second cooldown. 
---
(If the killer is carrying a survivor when this perk stuns them, they will not drop the survivor.)
---
Unless you have a perk with stopping power, that'll happen. But if you have a perk or power that can instadown or slow, like Billy/Clown, this is death for your team. This is why I like deja vu so much. It identifies problematic gens so I can break them up early and keep the team alive.
---
Doctor since he is my main but actually playing for fun has to be a trapper since I really have to think over my set of options usually with me checking for possible loops and setting traps there
---
the survivor perk with boil over and maybe a sabo-squad would be so annoying but seems balanced. 
---
this is quite possibly the dumbest comment i could possibly fathom a real human making
---
"This should be fun, playing with more new players :D"
---
2 hours later
---
"They all deserve to die :D"
---
Puppers keeps saying August but i haven't seen anything official. 
---
&gt;in high ranks that shit works
---
Not really, skilled players will know to put pressure by doing gens while the killer wastes time for a save catch opportunity that never comes. This DOES work against many SWF parties though.
---
Not wrong though is it?
---
What I’m saying is. After all gens are completed if you have yet to get a kill. Face camp and usually someone will try to rescue them. Especially if you a bitch with noed you could kill at least 2 survivors at that rate. Better than none. Shit happens. I once got a three k that way because I got clapped by rank 1 swf meg group and then face camped for the other 2 kills.
---
She's adorable! You should take commissions!
---
Oh my God. Yes
---
r/dbdgonewild 
---
[removed]
---
I only play killer
---
Why?
---
Went into Deliverance territory real fast.
---
If she isn't deaf she'll just hear you? and if you do this more than once she can fake phasing for a second to see where you are going.
---
Bubba's Basement. 
---
Yes lol
---
This is a the chad no offerings or add-ons killer only area 
---
Yeah, after we figured out that she was not going to murder us, I tried to get her to damage some gens I was working on but with no communication but gestures she either didn’t get it or didn’t want to do it.
---
Your art. I like it.
---
Nothin personnel kid
---
Werewolf killer for sure. Not sure if killer perks affecting hooked survivors is a good idea though... I'd like it if they made a werewolf/beast killer that utilized some type of smell mechanic that you could see as a trail of scented fog or something 
---
This is underappreciated.
---
Apparently nothing we have to sit there and let killers hook us 
---
Nurse reaction😂😂
---
It looks like your neck broke lol 
---
Why is the first one cute and the second one creepy af?
---
Hag for me. Before the buff is when I started to main her and I just loved that every game was a mind game and you really had to get into the mind of the survivors.
---
There is M/K support coming to some games, but the list now of games that can use it is very short (Fortnite being on that list).
---
no im saying in a decent ping game with a non op killer. also, if i solo queue i get plenty of games from 50 to 100 ping.
---
Spirit isn't that OP. But my god is she very easy to play. She's about a tier below nurse (meaning you can get very consistent results with her) but skill wise, she's almost braindead. Yea you can "get good" with spirit, but you don't really need too. You just hit them, then follow the noise and scratches with your power. Or just fake your power and let them run into you.
---
this post got the trifecta of awards 
---
I mean, unbreakable will most of the time be a useless perk. It’s a counter to slugging which is just a boring strat tbh. 
---
Mah boi Dwight doesn't teabag! Well, at least when I'm playing.
---
I agree with you but apparently anything we use is toxic or overpowered even if it’s not useful 98% of the time 
---
Pc?
---
Oh, but the fabulously dressed ones will. 
---
It’s mostly only used end game with 2 survivors left. Usually when I run it I’m always hooked and never get slugged
---
what? im talking about ping, ping has nothing to do with the pc
---
I already do, but I can’t be the most toxic player I can without a 100% sensitivity mouse.
---
Yes it does? The people that play on console have horrible connections 
---
The killer was super laggy. I couldnt stop laughing when i was sacraficed to her god.
---
I dont get it
---
Exactly. When games crash constantly for even a few days, theres usually a hotfix within days. Week at most. Its just annoying because I want this game to be successful.
---
I have only played a handful of games under 100 ping and I play on PS4 and Xbox 
---
Unbreakable isnt OP, if anything far from it. Its only used once in a game and thats if yoi get slugged. You chose to slug and happened to slug the wrong person and he got up and revived everyone else. You couldve hooked them and chose not to.
---
Ikr, just being good at looping (which you need to do to survive) is toxic. Doing gens (only objective) is toxic etc. Using perks like Dead Hard are toxic (uhm okay) etc. 
---
No perks... YOU ALL SHALL DIE
---
well i sometimes get 90-100 ping when playing with an american friend, and i live in uk.
---
Was it a legion?
---
Fair enough
---
1.Is fixing the generator with a toolbox
---
2.Picks up wrench a stares at it
---
“Wait a minute..” 
---
Really nice artwork👍🏽
---
Don’t forget self care, tool boxes or flashlights 
---
Didn’t answer my question do you play on pc?
---
I reported a few people for doing this the other day, all 3 of my teammates were working with the killer. I uploaded the video and sent it to BHVR. rook them a week to say they were investigating but marked my case as closed. I doubt they'll actually do anything. they dont give a shit about console reports.
---
😂😂😂😂
---
oh yes ofc, why would i play on console if it’s superior in almost every way? i thought you were asking for my pc specs.
---
You mean P3 Claudette?
---
What’s wrong with it you troll
---
Yeah if using a key but I didn't know either, and I don't think my team or the killer did, so it was surprising for all of us, killer must've been happy with that sweet revenge.
---
The worst is when you get farmed by the killer. Less people means less points and killers dont like that, so they will keep you in that game until they are ready to kill you. I dont wanna be your bloodpoint bitch and i dont want, nor expect the killer to just let me get my points either. I just wanna die and move on to the next game.  I dont like survivors that DC, but if you hold me hostage, i dont have a choice.
---
As someone who plays Killer a LOT, this has to be one of the dumbest things I've ever read.
---
Every killer is good at defending the basement because 90% of the time it’s just a free camp. 
---
So why do people DC against the Legion? Is it because of Frenzy?
---
tell me how it’s biased if i’ve played an equal amount of both. please lmao.
---
Yeah, the trash talking is HORRIBLE on DbD. I understand a playful “Heh, GG EZ” but like, I’d get full on *”lmao wasn’t even trying, kill yourself, lmao”*
---
Shouldn’t have slugged him in the first place that’s your fault 
---
The Lunar event for year of the dog.....enough said lmao. But yeah, the hotfixes are waaaay too far in between, I agree.
---
Your comment wasn’t necessary is how it’s biased you are showing from your personal experience and opinion ergo biased 
---
Oohh... whoosh, my bad
---
biased
---
adjective US   /ˈbɑɪ·əst/  
---
showing an unreasonable preference or dislike based on personal opinion:
---
The newspapers gave a biased report of the meeting.
---
OP is new to the game i bet
---
Should have picked them up.
---
Sorry but it's that simple.
---
That's just the perk slippery meat
---
Yeah let's make the most killer sided map more killer sided.
---
I don't think anyone could be 100% anything.
---
The most masculine men have the most feminine behaviour when not in public. 
---
There’s a bug where the totem that’s chosen to be lit is almost always the same on a map
---
That's what he said 
---
Why??? That is so stupid- now if you stack 4 streamers with your friends then the killer would have no idea to farm. Literally the killer never DCs when I bring streamers. Wouldn't the better idea be to not waste your offering if you don't load in?
---
Did you really just repost your own crappy comment because you got like 3 downvotes on your last attempt at this shitty joke?
---
The devs have to give Microsoft the green light for m/k support. You'll have to wait and see if they allow it.
---
that definition says nothing about opinions being biased.
---
You just said you played both, and prefer one over the other which is being biased

Okay, why do people dc from Legion? I have no issues with the killer.
---
not really, it’s an opinion.
---
It a biased opinion, by you saying something is superior over the other with no factual evidence dictates that it’s an opinion. Which in that way you used your opinion was biased against consoles but in favor of PC, am I wrong?
---
No, I already know how to play with a controller 
---
the factual evidence is my own fucking experience of playing both for years lmao, are you ignoring half of everything i say or something?
---
PC
---
 I was playing with my friend and she kept spacing trough the floor on her screen causing her to be unable to throw down pallets or head trough the exit gate, it won't register it as a escape and she'll be able to walk trough the gate. The hatch didn't work either while in the glitched state. This has happened a few times including smaller bugs like not being able to throw down pallets and having to rebind keys in order to use them (even though it worked fine the game before). 
---
Yes!
---
And this is why I always have my camera pointed at the back of me.
---
Lol so relateable
---
What you're saying is that you slugged everyone, and a rare, one-time use perk JUST to counter people who slug countered you?
---
Sounds like you got outplayed, mate.

Thank you. Someone understands that DC’s hurt the legion as much as it hurts the survivors. Perhaps a remix of those old Soviet Union x Maoist China posters, only its 3 survivors plus legion choking out DC’ers? Just an idea
---
It’s not factual, it isn’t physically possible to be factual your experience is different then mine or anyone else’s experiences just because you had something happen doesn’t make it a fact that it will happen everytime.
---
fact
---
/fakt/Submit
---
noun
---
a thing that is known or proved to be true.
---
Lol is this a regular occurrence. It seems like the Hail Mary of survivor perks. I’ve seen it work wonders but only in extremely specific situations. 
---
LOL EVEN BASE NURSE IS BETTER THAN ANY KILLER WITH ANY ADFONS
---
it’s evidence.
---
I did this a long time ago when overlays and stuff werent a thing. Some game I cant even remember had no crosshair and I stuck tape in the middle an drew my own. Good times.
---
It can’t be proven true, because it will not happen twice 
---
from my experience, pc is better than console in almost every single way
---
my experience from thousands of hours on both.
---
Biased Opinion, not a fact. 
---
I usually have good luck with it but usually never in this close of a call. As long as the killer isn't in a chase or have sight of someone a close explosion seems to always get their attention.
---
not biased.
---
Try being more immersed, perhaps hide in a locker because at rank 1 no one uses lockers so the killer won't expect it. Also, I feel ya man. Being the first one to get chased sucks. 
---
DAVIDDD UwU
---
Haha I’m sure he has a new account, that guy was way too angry about survivors to not shitpost all day
---
Yes it is, your opinion says pc is better which no facts can prove that. Which since you’ve played both you prefer one over the other is biased towards one 
---
I’m not surprised. When Adam first dropped we’d be suspicious of every random explosion if there was no apparent reason for it but since then it’s definitely fallen out of vogue
---
the fact that i’ve played loads of both proves it.
---
Reminds me of puzzle pirates
---
Loop and make use of your exhaustion perks. That's all you can do tbh.
---
Who says it's not me saying "GG"?¿
---
No it doesn’t? So anything you say is factual? It’s an opinion biased towards pc you’re just a stubborn jackass who can’t stand being proved wrong with facts 
---
why would i lie about my opinion lmao
---
Well they claimed they wanted to support this game at least for next five years, so if there's anything they should focus on, it's fixing the code, they clearly have no other plans except choppy ports and more dlc, and fixing the code already cancels out one of those.
---
Thanks, yeah I saw that exact website roughly 2 weeks ago and for the life of me I couldn’t find it again. That chart is incredibly helpful. 
---
Ok thanks
---
Lol 2 friends at rank 15 are "toxic swf" lmao
---
Oh no it’s ok, I was joking around. It’s hard to know emotions through a text.

Thank you!
---
I'm perfectly fine playing without it tho it would be nice to have it once in a while when i go in for a save in end game or such since i like to be highly altruistic, tho i get your point.
---
Also kate has some really good perks! (Like dance whit me). You should get her or give her a try!
---
I don't find it toxic but I wish they'd change the graphic or whatever. It legitimately hurts my eyes the way it is now, so when someone blinds me multiple times it's hard not to get angry because they're causing me physical pain irl.
---
Another thing to note is a new survivor is on the way in a few weeks (assuming all is going as planned) so may wanna wait. Unless it turns out to be licensed.
---
Favorite is nurse because of her cosmetics. That's all
---

Yea i really like that one and boil over can be good in some situations too i guess. Thanks!

I don’t need a flashlight to outplay lmao

Kate ! Better perks hands down 
---
Billy
---
Nurse, billy, spirit, huntress, myers. In that order because I want to start an argument, you all know its true, fight me!
---
All of the above are toxic and crutches that if you can’t succeed without you’re garbage. Very simple. 
---
\-Deafult Dwight 2019
---
Yeah. There are some cheesy mechanics going on, but I just want play the game out and have some fun with a full team.
---
The perks have had a makeover as well... What's the survivor perk and killer perk metals? 
---
Leatherface for BBQ and Spirit for Spirit fury, both are fun but Spirit is definitely the better killer, but bubba is just good ol' fashion fun!
---
Dude, fuck off. He wasn’t being a douche he was telling the truth that this isn’t 100% his artwork.

i have a bit of an error having fairly constantly as killer. The floor doesn't spawn leaving me and the survivors usually stuck in one spot as any movement leaves em constantly falling to oblivion. any one know how to stop this happening?
---
I don't. It's not like Steam where I have a frame counter. I know that the game runs at 30fps and when playing it runs smoothly on the X and the Pro. There are occasional hiccups here and there … you can see it … but it runs well. 
---
Sounds like that one C-Virus mutation from RE6

“Someone took a niche perk, I did exactly what that perk is meant to counter, and they used it to counter me. OP pls nerf I need my free 4K”

I haven't tried to play as killer on PC, and even if I did, I am a high rank and would not have a problem finding matches. Lower ranks do effect match time. I'm a 13 survivor on PC and am not having any issues finding matches, while I'm rank 5 on Xbox and it takes forever to just load into a lobby. 
---
Nice work once again, loved the look of the last one and I like this one too.
---
Stealthing around the map isn't holding the game hostage, again it's annoying yes but the killer can find the survivor and kill them.
---
Are all of these traced over?
---
I'm doing a challenge where I play all Killers until I prestige them using only their teachable perks and a perk that isn't  another teachable perk from another Killer. The Legion is by far the worst and most Killer I have ever played. I hate when people DC too because I'm not that good as The Legion so

Frank be lookin like a crackhead

Oh no, I didn't catch this comment until today and it's saying the invite is invalid again. I'm seriously so sorry. If you could, please give me the link one more time? I'm going to make sure to check Reddit each day the next week.
---
This cheered me up. I not only got spammed with toxic messages, but they reported my profile picture and i have a temporary ban, it was a ghost busters picture 
---
F'real, I never played RE6. I will confess that I was inspired by ["The Assassin" from Matrix Online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWPey1fU9Ok) who was made entirely out of flies.

oh good one 😂 then don’t comment on my shit lmao

Thank you. I needed a good chuckle.
---
Never ever ever ever ever trust the "ready to launch" garbage. 
---
Ah. My noob is showing ☺️ thanks
---
yes. it’s being overly nit picky on fucking REDDIT. you’re a joke of a human being 
---
Hag is top 3.
---
BHVR has to cater to the killers otherwise wait times are atrocious since survivors don’t want to step up to the plate and help each other out with wait times.
---
I’m actually curious what the actual active player count is weekly, they’ll release escape rates but not player activity? Lol  bias at its finest 
---
Lay it on me, I aint scared.
---
Whoever's throwing around gold wanna slap me?
---
Do you only post about DS? And yes OP get DS it’s a very good perk to use . 
---
Should be Insidious, not MS.
---
If I manage to drop a 4k against a four man SWF that's teabagging and acting tough, you know I'm droppin that GG EZ
---
Because no one likes the truth. Everyone wants to be coddled and made to feel good because in their make believe world feelings are greater than facts and they feel that because they paid for legion that they should be allowed to cheat with him. This one simple change to how legions ability works would make the killer tunneling you tolerable. It's not like I don't already get tunneled for an entire match anyways because cry baby killers see I'm the obsession. I'm used to it. There's no way to counter someone using an exploit by walking backwards and still actively chasing you as your screen gets darker and darker and you either fall or they stab you as you mend. There is absolutely no counter play to that at all. 
---
Most of the people I've seen talk about legion just assume or try to make you believe that they use the ability the way it's supposed to be used. They never do. None of these cheating people play him how he was designed. They all use Frank's mix tape or cold dirt, stab you then turn around chasing you backwards. In his current state, fuck the legion and anyone that plays them. Fuck them over hard with a DC. If everyone DC'd on sight he would only get 5k for the match making it impossible to obtain his add-ons and those that use other killers for the points for the add-ons still waste their points and add-one since they're effectively negated when everyone DC's. 
---
Tldr: I'm not going to reward a cheater or anyone abusing game mechanics to ruin the experience for someone or those that feel the need to take advantage of an exploit to gain the advantage. They deserve 0 points. The same way people DC against killers that specifically tunnel them or face camp them. Those people DC because they're not gonna reward a shitty person with points and they would rather re-queue into another match instead of being facecamped. I don't do that but I do understand why others do. It's the exact same reason I will DC against every legion I see until the exploit is fixed.
---
*Hughughuhgh*
---
Nah man most of the time you won't even get to use your unbreakable. Of course sometimes it's going to be clutch but most of the time you won't even get to use it 
---
Ok.
---
Few days late to try and start a senseless console conflict? you do you boo. If PS4 is your preference than great, hope you enjoy it and the mutual game we both obviously enjoy.
---
♿ NOED coming through ♿
---
SWF teams would need their own lobbies if they wanted different rules to be applied and those would take hours to fill up. I agree it’s annoying not being able to see the perks when you get sacrificed but this is probably as close as the devs will get to making everyone happy. In any case half the time you can usually figure out what the killer has just by how they react. 
---
This is an issue that should've been fixed 2 years ago, but if you think they are gonna try anything to help the actual issues with this game you are naive, friend.
---
Look at how they implemented microtransactions, skins, holiday events, and now a goddamn switch port while the optimization is still shit, THERE ARE NO ADVANCED GRAPHICAL SETTINGS, the rank system is a joke, people can just DC with little penalty, people can get booted from the game before it even starts, balance is still all over the place, many killers need serious QoL updates (Leatherface), but whats the big glitch they fix? The one where you can get some shittly looking bloody cosmetics without the huge fucking grind they refuse to address.
---
Fuck BHVR, they are coasting on the fact they have a good idea for a game and have implemented it better then anyone yet, but you bet your ass as soon as there is a game like this that does it better I'm jumping ship and you should too.
---
Before and after stabbing the janitor 
---
because they’re a bunch of punk bitches
---
The first iteration was met with mixed responses but the second was pretty alright it seems.
---
My current build:
---
Spine Chill to know when the killer is coming your way
---
Urban Evasion to sneak around
---
Dance with Me and Quick and Quiet to vault and escape when you're in a chase (either could be substituted with Lithe, depends on your preference)
---
A disconnect is technically a death... 
---
Just DC with us. We want to play Dead By Daylight, and Legion straight up isn't that. They turn this game into something way more boring.
---
I'm personally already towing a line between dropping this game all together due to a myriad of reasons, but Legion really makes me wish I would.
---
That is not how an opinion works, but alright.
---
that's a joke, right?
---
Block people not on your friends list, or embrace the salt and bask in it.

---
Justice. 
---
You rang?
---
If they sit in an out of reach spot then yes. Say for example, they glitch into a position where you can't hit them if they don't move. That is hostaging, because they can never be killed, and you can't leave without DCing, thus nothing you can do. 
---
How is that at all bias? People care more for escape rates and ask for it on a MUCH larger scale so obviously they would release them over player activity... 
---
Jesus man, seems like you’re just complaining to complain.
---
We T-Pose to assert Dominance
---
I had ms, territorail imperative and Insidious on three contiguous bloodwebs, well...
---
They'd try to brandish their knife, their wrist shaking as they can't get a steady focus before the sight of the four muscled men.  As Legin's knife grip goes limp, something else stirs within 'em as they get stabbed with something that finally makes them feel complete.

the amount of gens needed to spawn the hatch is (number of survivors alive) +1. the hatch won’t spawn and definitely won’t open after the second generator unless the game is a carnage.
---
to me, that formula is balanced enough. remember games with useless teammates who will kill themselves as soon as they get to the hook and games where the killer will facecamp or tunnel everyone exist

---
You can always boost the sensitivity on the XIM more and more. I actually dont know the limit to it.
---
Maybe BHVR should work with Microsoft, Sony, and Steam to incorporate a more severe punishment for volatile choices of words with their in-game and system based communications? Like, if someone messages you (console) and you report it for harassment, the system will check which games you recently played together (within a x day time period), and then generate a report to BHVR to issue a warning/temp ban for using negative language against another player who didn't warrant such treatment.
---
Sources for what? Unless you’re wanting sources for players preferring to see kill rates I can’t help. And if that is the case, visit the reddit, forums, ask in lobbies, literally anywhere to do with the game and it will become utterly clear. Now if you have any sources to prove that what you claimed to be bias is, in fact bias, I’d love to see them. 
---
Tone it down a notch? Wym fam.
---
Ikr. I feel like Myers gets all the attention. :( 
---
Are....are you playing freddy with 0 perks? If so you are a legend
---
No, but at least make him work for it!
---
Spirit is inarguably stronger than hag at the highest levels of play. Her power has more utility, and Billy’s are borderline unstoppable at top levels of play while hag still has counterplay aside from pallet looping. So she is arguably the third best killer but you would need to bend some facts around to truly argue it. 
---
This would be the only acceptable way to do this, but there's still a chance that the person who leaves the game before everyone else can see the loadout, and send a message to the other people playing.
---
This is one of the reasons I’ve been running bond as my fourth perk. 
---
While you guys are talking bouquets, can we just acknowledge the fact that petrified oaks just to be green??
---
Troll, you’re the one pulling stuff out of your ass, bias was my OPINION, Which is different from what you did.
---
You’re blocked because you’re obviously trolling 
---
Don't get me wrong, I know where you're coming from, but I just want to play a full game with a full crew of survivers. It's a bonding experience to go through awful situations together. Lol
---
Do you have a source on this? I need to see this hilarity myself. And possibly link it to friends.
---
In terms of overall effectiveness then it would be Hillbilly, who has high mobility and chase strength and ease of use. Nurse will be best competitively, where all players involved in the match are expected to be seasoned on how to play their respective sides.
---
Can confirm, I'm a horse... guy? and have been picked up/tackled/etc. by horse girls a foot shorter than I.
---
They're terrifying, honestly.
---
Too much energy went into making this lol
---
Yes it is. If you can't find the Survivor and kill them and the Survivor isn't attempting to progress the game then the Survivor is actively making the match last potentially indefinitely (due to how shitty the anti-AFK crows are) until the Killer DCs.
---
I'm fairly certain that Behavior has also stated that stealthing around the map and refusing to do gens is game hostage taking, though I don't have a quote to cite on that.
---
I agree, I personally always check out the killers perks and add ons but I play solo. So it sucks that I have to wait the entire game assuming I die first. I agree that they should block it for swf and show it for solo, but I don't think they're going to do it 
---
Tenacity got a buff.
---
I love the bleedout timer not going down if he’s within a certain range. That needs to be a thing ASAP.
---
Hatchet hitboxes are still fucking garbage though. Half the time I'll be staring straight at a Survivor's head and I'll throw the hatchet into the pallet or waist high box prop.
---
Lolli fans be like 😗
---
What, how could you see through such a clever ruse!?
---
'So, what would you have done if I didnt get hooked??' 
---
Huntress is obviously meant to have very little social knowledge but be very adept at, well, hunting. While she wouldn't be able to get a job at a post office she can damn well live in the woods off nothing but rain water and elk meet. I'd like to see you survive in the woods without bottled water and granola bars, ya piece of shit.
---
Thank. That's my signal to mine the fuck outta those gens if I nyoom.
---
Did why are you being so fake about what happened lol? You've made a few things up that make you sound really good and smart and him (my bf) dumb?
---
Yeah sorry that's not how that works. It was a good save but you ruined it by being toxic.
---
Is this real or is this just a joke? Honestly can't tell with this guy.
---
depending on what your friends are like, you should really give it a try in KYF.
---
No. All must die. The entity demands it! 
---
Ebony mori is bs... but some groups deserve it. Lol
---
It’s an interesting and well thought concept, but unless BHVR buys the rights to Jason, it won’t happen 
---
You not liking a woman because she can't count (and also assuming that she can't count even though inventory management would be extremely important when living in the wilderness to determine when one needed to go hunting / foraging since these things take time to prepare) shows how petty your standards are.
---
Though I will admit I'm not about to go on a date with someone who doesn't realize that killing other humans is wrong. ~~This also goes to the people who want to fuck Michael Myers.~~
---
Completely agree, that shit pisses me tf off. ESPECIALLY when they do it to someone who is obviously new to the game. Like, GG EZ huh? You must feel real good, stomping a noob. 
---
umm I disagree. Just turn your sensitivity up to 10 and she's just as good as on PC. And she also takes so much time to learn that people just immediately dismiss her as bad. 
---
Well once again I never encounter problems when versing him. 
---
THAT case is forgiveable, and perfectly understandable!
---
HAHAHA THIS IS RELATABLE SOMETIMES WHEN HUNTRESS ISNT ENOUGH TO GET THE JOB DONE
---
Nice. Reminds me of a propaganda poster lol
---
Idk man. I still feel as though there isn't alot of counterplay. 
---
wtf you talking about? I get MOSTLY players that aren't dicks when I play. 
---
Well they also know where the gates are so maybe they were just checking the gate? But yeah I’ve gotten that bug before
---
\*heavy wheezing\*
---
I only run it up against a 4 man SWF, makes dealing with a fully coordinated group less frustrating. 
---
Joey looks somewhat adorable while Frank looks like the creepy uncle that can't come over anymore
---
99999999999 IQ play right there
---
it's black so can say the n-word
---
Myers 0 : Meowers 1
---
There’s not supposed to be. Giving it a nerf would make them borderline useless. Only way a nerf would work is if they reduced it to 2-3 kills. Not 4. 
---
Even then, you’re still screwed. 
---
*starts hyperventilating in fear*
---
Disagree with the Jake but yeah
---
Ahh good times.
---
No u
---
Yeah, but a good team who can tell you are camping, with all gens popped and exit open? They are incredibly fucking stupid if they go after that one guy. GOOD surv teams won't, they will let him hang because at the end of the day, 3 escaping is a win for the survivors and a loss for the killer. 
---
Dude if they are teabagging then im gonna face camp at least one of them.
---
If the added mods to slows the movement speed of bleeding victims I think that would be legit.
---
Or someone who was recently bleeding suffers gen repair speed for a certain amount of time.
---
If you look at legions mods none of them are actually debuffs or anything special. They are all based around Frenzy.
---
Don't play survivor super often but when I do I enjoy going up against a good Myers. Still manages to scare the hell out of me sometimes.
---
As for playing? I absolutely love getting a good game as Spirit. Super satisfying to sneak up on someone and grab them off a gen or mindgame them into walking into you. She's the only killer I actually had someone message me to say I scared them with. Feels good being able to make the game entertaining for other people. She's not my main but she's my go to if I want to change things up a little.
---
I mean, if the survs suspect NOED, they can always cleanse totems, ESPECIALLY if they suspect NOED (which you really should). It's not hard to pop a gen, hit a totem on the way to the next one, pop the other gen. Especially if you got someone on your team that is skilled at looping the killer all over the place. Most killers don't know when to give up a chase, so one guy can cost precious minutes of the killers time, allowing gens to get done quickly, which could free someone up to go after totems.
---
Survivors are questionable at all ranks, and we all make stupid mistakes sometimes. But if you play relatively well, you will rank up even if you die in the match.
---
Yes, but actually no. 
---
Your nsfw one is one called “this perfect face”
---
That is really nice of you. At the end of the day, 3 survs killed is an overall loss for the survs and win for killer. One guy escaping isn't really hurting you at all.  
---
Hell, I rarely 4k, even if I get the chance. I'll drop the poor sap at the trapdoor if I know where it is.
---
*Cue Dexter Theme Song*
---
If Enduring is the easy fix for DS then Small Game is the easy fix for NOED
---
If you're looking for good perks, pick Adam or Jeff. Adam has deliverance and Jeff has distortion. Kate's perks are meh but it's down to your preference ultimately
---
I only care about 4ks if the survivors were snots. 
---
Well you can't see killers loadout so joke's on you buddy. Unless you mean that you go for totems on all runs, in which case good for you--other surv teams need to learn to have someone keeping an eye out for them
---
I just feels as though it needs to be fair. This is a multiplayer game, after all. Its not like the killers are playing a single player murdering simulator. There are survivors who just want a fair game, and that doesn't seem to be the case with the current state the Ebony Moris is now. 
---
Maybe they could reduce its spawn amount in the bloodweb, I just want some change to it so it makes the game more enjoyable for all. What's the point of ranking up and playing if all I'm gonna be  screwed because I get killers who just wreck my stuff up and I can't help myself to survive.
---
The only way Unbreakable is "OP" (really, it just needs to be nerfed) is that in addition to being a free get up, it's a free wake up as well. It also nerfs anti-hatch Freddy, who slugs the third person to deny the fourth the hatch. Getting rid of the free wake up ability would help that as well. 
---
Well if NOED pops, exit doors are open so, the killer likely will only get the one kill, so of course he is face camping. That is the one situation I think face camping is okay to do.  
---
If the survs decide to be overly altruistic and go for the one guy left hanging, with the killer OBVIOUSLY camping him, then they deserve to die. 
---
Exactly why I use NOED
---
I mean yea the power is similar, but the hag would need 2 add-on slots just to be like the scientist, and the scientist has a bigger terror radius and faster movement speed.
---
Second, no one in higher ranks heals against the legion me included.
---
It will not ruin pop goes the weasel because it only regresses 10% which can be recovered in like 15 seconds depends how many people work on a generator.
---
Also, it’s not overpowered because it would take you 75 seconds of not finding anyone just to get 3 tokens, the idea is to counter those pesky survivors taking the game hostage when they’re the only survivor left.
---
Also, I’ll make it so if you’re 16 meters away from a hooked survivor, the perk will not stack tokens.
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
I can totally understand that. Those 4-3 man sfw ds flashlight Claudette groups are a pain. 
---
But in those 3 man groups, there's always the fourth survivor. The one not part of the group, the one who gets chased and gets no help, the one who gets farmed off the hook, and, with the Ebony Mori, the one who ends up dead for all the trouble they go through. It just sucks.
---
This is the trifecta of games that are in a shitty state on console but the devs are porting to a weaker one
---
he didn't want people to know his name but forgot about that oof
---
owo
---
Ughhhhh I haven't had that sort of luck. Survivors keep running back and forth across my gen (20 metres that way, turn around, loop back 20 meters that way, repeat) trying to get the killer to focus on my instead while I keep having to change my position on it while I work
---
You saw it? The girl with cum on her face?
---
OWO
---
dead by daylight is the first game i encountered that just doesn't work at times, no other game has failed to work as much as this game.
---
i'm gonna make a weird comparison and say that Payday 2 doesn't fail as much as this game does and that game is running on a RACING engine while this game runs on Unreal Engine 4 so it has little to no excuses to be running this badly or not running at all.
---
I've done solo-queues frequently at rank 1 and the survivors I pair with, we manage. I also usually use After-Care so the struggle against Legion isn't exactly impossible. I think people should stop bitching, play the game and develop a strategy against Legion as we survivors have done against other killers like Doctor.
---
ur not missing much, his mic quality and attitude made it pretty boring and annoying
---
Alright got it. 
---
I don't clame to be good at all. Hence "hone my skills." just know it would be more fun to cooperate with people all on the same page, I only solo, I have tons of fun, but people are knobs sometimes and I'd also like being in a party. I Try and find people to play with and get roasted haha Jesus christ 
---
I love it when a survivor I killed tells me I'm bad. You, just died to me, lol, you are worse.
---
Yeah thought so
---
Cant wait for ark to run at 10fps than the usual 40
---
That’s terrifying. Someone call the people making the Child’s Play remake and tell them you have an idea for his new bride. 
---
They're pretty rare tbh. I find the nicer players who do stuff like this (both survivors and killers [less likely to tunnel/camp]) are playing online early in the day like morning/afternoon. Evening and night playtime is usually a big Yikes 
---
I think making Back For Revenge operate on a delay would be cool, and more movie accurate. Pull someone down, run off to help heal or go back to your gen, then suddenly your aura is revealed for 5 seconds.
---
Shouldn't this flare be "Rant"?
---
This exactly why I always run Bond when I solo.
---
Thank you this was very informative
---
EVERYONE. It happens 3 put of 4 times for me. It's infuriating. 
---
I go for all totems.
---
This isn’t marked as a shitpost.
---
Yo what’s going on...?
---
idc about karma like these neets
---
I find solo play far more enjoyable. No communications. Very immersive game play. Makes it stupid chaotic at times. 
---
Just do a gen or 2, unhook and heal someone, then learn how to loop. You’ll gain rank as long as you aren’t farmed / camped. 
---
Oh lord! She's near the basement too, talk about bad luck. lol
---
I reached devotion 2 and I forgot to take a screenshot of that. Feels bad :l
---
Maybe just make it so you can only kill people after the second hook that way it stops the tunneling just a smidge?
---
OP
---
This. So much this. 
---
Same thing happened to me as well. When you pick them up as they use unbreakable and sprint burst i think.
---
Laughed my ass off the first time. Wasnt even mad he escaped.
---
So kinda like The Pain from MGS3?
---
I'll take your word for it man, aaaall good. ;)
---
YES
---
Please make it happen! Kappa
---
Actually would be a lot of fun, but you got to die and become a billy.
---
He was about to ascend to heaven.
---
I can believe it. 
---
Well shit 
---
Does 4k stand for 4 survivors killed?
---
Don't get me wrong, I love the game, I love solo, was really just looking for some people to play with, all my friends are Lifted truck country music douchebags, and I mean so am I, but if it's not call of duty they haven't heard it and I'd like to play with some other people basically 
---
It's especially annoying on console with the addition of controller aiming. Trying to get long distance hatchets sucks.
---
Every pvp game is like this.  Best part about playing killer is you can close your lobby immediately after the game if you wish.
---
He took the "wait that's illegal" to a next level.
---
I honestly think they should just make it incredibly rare. Only see it on the Bloodweb every 20-30 levels.
---
&gt;You just can’t “win” against an organised SWF of good players.
---
That's any killer besides Nurse, Billy, and maybe Spirit. It's not just Freddy.
---
Hol up this legit?
---
Motherfucker, I envy you for having that.
---
I did this just as another survivor was hooked a few nights ago. After, in chat, the killer chastised us for leaving one behind. 
---
Well, this list of demands confirms something I've known since hearing of him.
---
Ochido is dumb, banned, and dumb and banned.
---
There is, but what you described is lag.
---
I play the game on Xbox ever day, I only get what you described once every 15 matches or so. It's called lag.
---
yea! theres a perk to counter a perk, usually. Idk how to feel about all tiers being exposed tho, as a surv its annoying but as a killer its less of a grind
---
Most "nonsense" DC's are made for a point
---
People will throw in BPS and DC before you hook out of spite if they don't like how you go about things. I DC all the time on matches the killer tries to farm in, or slugs me in a 3 man lobby cause they're scared of DS but wanna get that 3k.

Nope. It's not your fault they're shit at hiding and do the most predictable things ever.

Wouldn't this be very similar to clown?

Can you make me a Joe?? 
---
David looks great with that lighting 👀
---
Eh, I suppose, minus the having the throw and reload. I'm thinking clown mixed with doctor but having excellent camo abilities lol
---
...
---
As a Survivor main, I fucking hate when people do this. 1 minute in, first hook of the game, no gens done and now there's 3 people on the ground.

Can’t deny getting out of rank 15 after rank reset is always a hassle. I have to run deliverance just as a precaution for garbage team mates

If this is true what’s is oral argument gonna be in court? He violated the EULA, was banned from PC, banned from PS4, it’s a private business, nuff said. Let him waste his money and time, the Judge will rule in favor of BHVR interactive because of the EULA. He violated it many times with recorded, and documented evidence. Case closed, plus he brings attention to himself in the courts eyes for the claims made against him on being a pedophile.

Happy cake day

David should have a sandy blonde hair cosmetic. In some lighting his hair like that is amazing.

---
No the next one (chapter 11 coming out next month) is oldest killer. They’ve said nothing on 12 or 13
---
Golly G, its almost like some people live in a different country and or live in a place where internet providers don't give good speeds. If I connect to a killer that has garbo ping sure as shit I'm not playing in that lobby.  
---
I have a friend that lives in the middle of nowhere and the only internet solution is Satellite or cell tethering. Shits so garbage.

OP $ paid one of those sites that records lines for you.

OP is a chump.

I like Cancel the Dance and Back for Revenge, but Hex: Delusions seems kinda useless to me except against SWF. I always imagined Harry's power to be something about blinding survivors with his helmet light, to be honest.

Buff Legion.
---
this is awful, thank you
---
Have you not done what it says in the video and googled the name Erik Estavillo? How clueless are you LOL
---
Oh yes. Tbag baiting the killer. How skillful and fun.
---
I honestly think it’s ok when you „protect“ it, so patrol in a small area around it. Facecamping is still shitty but not taking the risk of letting them both escape is just normal
---
What do you do when its a 3 man sfw and a fourth who isn't a part of them? 
---
Seriously fuck you and get fuckin good
---
Or you have a shirtless David King with a shit connection. You're never sure when he's dead-harding and when he's just teleporting.
---
This is the fakest thing I ever seen. This person just bought this off one of those sites you can get these from and stuffed it with a bunch of buzzwords. If this is truly real, give us even a single link, OP

It's rare that a headline makes you laugh out loud
---
Guess Ochido really wants to ruin himself
---
Hilarious, even if thats true (its not I know), none of these changes would be good for the game, exept arguably the freddy buff
---
This post is aimed more at killers lobby dodging when 2+ more people joined at once. Should have specified 
---
"nsfw language"
---
Have you not done what it says in the video and googled the name Erik Estavillo? Or for that matter googled Ochido? He was recently perma banned and it’s even on his Twitter right now. How clueless are you LOL. 
---
A simple google search...🙄
---
[sees title]
---
“Oh, so he’s pissed off that his shitty behavior got himself banned and cut off a source of revenue.”
---
[reads list of demands]
---
“The … actual … fuck? He’s suing over questionable design decisions? And he didn’t think to ask for a timer?”
---
Yeah, but I'm not a person who feels any perks are OP. I have no qualms with DS either, I don't even dribble because it just wastes time, if they slot DS and get the skill check, good for them, they deserved it.
---
Should have titled the post to “Killers that lobby dodge” 
---
If it’s a connection issue that’s fine obviously. 
---
Even though he could be dumb enough to do this, it is a joke
---
Not securing it is basically being dumb. Chances are people will always be trying to save the guy, so you may end with two kills rather than one or even zero.
---
I feel shitty when I'm ruining the someone else's experience. That's not the case at all.
---
Either way, you shouldnt go "You suck at this game." Some people hate playing against SWF. I know I do. 
---
Or again, they got a friend that wanted to play, connection issues or just straight up had to leave. 
---
Technically a survivor can block another survivor for as long as they please, unless the killer shows up.  I had a griefer on my team once upon a time that followed me around from gen to gen, never working on one with me, spamming the "point" emote.  When the killer was roaming the area I hid behind a rock next to the exterior wall.  The griefer decided to hide right next to me, pinning me against the wall and stone, whilst teabagging me.  This went on for several minutes.
---
Ohhhh so this can stay up but my cat video about Michael Myers cats was taken down. K. Lol.
---
That sounds like an issue with survivor attitudes across the board.
---
this guy gets it
---
you deadass just said Remember Me and fucking Blood Warden were crutches
---
Toss on a coxcombed clapper and ghost add-on, avoid their comms as best I can by sneaking up on em 
---
Wouldn't provide them that much of an opening up escape, usually I'll just keep hitting them until they leave to save myself the time 
---
David mains RISE UP
---
That’s pretty true. But in my case me and my girlfriend want to play games after work. 
---
You're trash then.
---
Don't worry, I hold out against them!
---
Unless they're doing that moonwalk bullshit. If they're not gonna play than neither am I.
---
You’re not ruining the experience for the survivor on the hook. They had the entire length of 5 generators to play the game. They had a chance to get points and have fun. Leaving the hook is literally just giving them a free escape. Sitting on a hook and being sacrificed is their punishment for getting caught. The only reason I’m against camping is because you get less points for camping throughout the game. When all the gens are completed and gates are open, the best way to get points is to secure your kill. 
---
Yeah you’re a problem
---
Okay buddy
---
That’s 100% fair
---
The mentality is wrong because a team can have people who deserve to escape who are brought low by their team. You saying 'inb4' doesn't negate the correctness of the argument. Your mentality presumes that partial rewards should not exist for partial completion. That mentality is not applied in the game in other ways so why apply it in this specific one?
---
You think that giving a chance for one survivor to escape for partial completion isn't giving a chance to a good survivor because you somehow imagine it should be perfect and that the worst survivors cannot take it. If that was your true concern then you'd want survivors who have a certain amount of points or something to only be able to use it. A bad player doesn't fuck over their team by using it, fucking over their team by playing safe helps them get it, but using it is not fucking someone over.
---
The hatch does not make survivors lass salty about losing. They lost and thus died so the hatch wouldn't make them happier.
---
I think the hatch is a good idea because in the boring late game it allows there to be some decent objective to pursue rather than a boring game of "I'll just sneak around far from anything important until the killer AFKs or disconnects". 
---
Killer main that doesn’t dodge unless bad connection. 
---
That's so cool
---
Very fun and enjoyable. Sometimes the rise in inflection at the end of some sentences became distracting. Top notch stuff tho. 
---
I used to dodge potential swf groups or people with high trophies as well but I realized I won’t get better at the game unless I play with more experienced players it’s payed off well
---
He says, ignoring all the tweaks in favor of survivors.
---
THANK YOU. Google is there, Fucking use it!
---
Camping isn't necessarily a bad thing, if there's good reason to do it.
---
That would be awesome for sure, but who knows what kind of bugs or technical difficulties this could lead to amirite
---
Camping is acceptable if all gens are done but this guy was camping everyone for no reason
---
Well she’s not going to get better by me avoiding her and knocking out all the gens. She’s only going to get better by chasing someone. I feel like I’m doing her a favor if anything. And if they’re that miserable as nurse then they should just switch to a killer they’re good at. 
---
To be fair, I sometimes lose track of people I hit
---
Why would you dc when playing against that?
---
No.
---
Simply make jumping through the hatch take longer than it does for the Killer to wipe their weapon.
---
Done.
---
Time to orangutango.
---
So you can do a gen without getting pulled off from a bullshit addon. The counter to it is to not do gens. How about ill just DC instead 
---
What counterplay against legion do you do? I can never win with him but I’m trying
---
When they buffed it to include instadown for all tiers, they should have made some other changes. Like maybe the hex totem is active all game, or becomes active after 4 gens. Some sort of a heads up to survivors would even it out I think. Just a thought. 
---
Did he have whispers, and were people waiting around for the save?
---
If its an obvious 3 man sfw (like, 3 claudettes wearing the same stuff or whatever) and they bully the 4th (like sandbagging or pointing them out), I usually kill them and give the 4th a win. I know how it feels to play solo, and I wouldn't wish that pain on anyone else.
---
If they are toxic though I just kill em. 
---
No
---
I like your optimism that the thumbs down report does anything. It's probably not even connected to a server. Just there to placate you crybabies.

---
Isn't this one of those kinds of videos where you pay speakers to read a script? I assumed it was.
---
Dw !
---
Its the best place to take the last survivor out. The feeling is almost indescribable. They have all this joy and excitement built up. They think they are home free and will escape...then BOOM! Lol, pure ecstasy. 
---
sure. Survivor is fully healed, last alive, and hatch is open.  Killer stands on hatch.  Killer cant hit the survivor cause then theyll jump in hatch during swing cooldown.  Survivor cant jump in hatch because killer will grab them out of the animation. Its a no win scenario. The survivor cant leave hatch because then killer will chase them.  This ends with both people just standing on hatch waiting for other to give up
---
No it has to be real because it has a real lawyers name on it and ochido was banned, how much sense do you have? /s 
---
Or remember not to report them, as we've been told not to since the system tracks DCs already. We've already seen waves of DC bans so it's not like nothing happens.
---
We’ve been specifically told not to report people for DC’s.
---
It's another case of survivors are salty because they didn't escape
---
(What platform do you play on?)
---
And don't care what the survivors think. Your a killer. The entity chose you for a reason
---
Don’t you guys have phones...with Google on it?
---
What?
---
Shitty people find doing shitty things fun. Good thing you can’t understand it. :)
---
Ruin, BBQ, spirit fury and enduring.
---
Don’t listen to anyone else :)
---
You got slugged, because all of you were in immediate vicinity. I wasn’t premeditated before the game started. That’s what I’m trying to say.
---
PS4
---
True I mean the killers job is to kill not be nice to survivors.
---
Then again your basically the slasher villain in your own horror movie if survivors don’t like you then you are basically doing your job as a slasher villain aren’t you
---
“Hey we are a 3 man wanna join our discord?”
---
Hex: ruin
---
Personally I don't use it, but it being up for just thirty seconds would be worth more then overcharge considering the skill check isn't overly hard to hit
---
 That's really cool of you. I have seen many 3 man sfw who will instantly go for the save if its their friend but leave the 4th to die on hook, as a killer and as the 4th survivor. Its pathetic. I've seen a few cases were they sandbag, but they usually get stuck and fuck themselves over as the person they sandbagged ran away. Karma I'd say. Anytime someone tries to ruin it for their teammates they usually get screwed over when I fuck them up instead of the person they tried to lead me to fuck up. But I can't really stop it when I'm a survivor. Good to see others don't stand for the toxicity of sfw either.
---

Who wrote that? This is some serious internet-level "I can sue for whatever I like and nobody can use logic."
---
Thats a kickass poster, love it
---
Ruin + noed is the killer equivalent of DS + adrenaline. Change my mind
---
You can't even wait a day to repost 😂😂😂😂
---
I watched a bazillion of his videos and didn't see that happen once. if it did, it would be 1-2 times out of 50
---
True but dang I’ve seen so many games with the Hex getting cleansed within the first minute or so but Lately I’ve had discordance with overcharge and surveillance on my trapper and it’s been getting me 3-4 kills almost every game
---
I must've missed that memo, regardless it just seems to keep on happening today. 
---
who are these killers ? are they streamers ?
---
Recharging the blink at the dispenser...
---
Yeah they buffed that perk in the legion update I believe
---
Why
---
It would lead to "technical difficulties" for survivors who think they can juke killers all of a sudden dealing with killers who can actually see them in a non-slideshow format.
---
It's a fake. The only news source you can rely on is Pew-News.
---
No, it has 20 charges. U need 16 in order to heal one health state.
---
P = Prestige :)
---
So the Myers I was against had the bloody mask, bloody jumpsuit and a bloody knife ^^
---
Awq he even has the dead eye stare
---
We talked about it 
---
This is bait.
---
With the hag, you can smell the scent of rotten flesh in the air, With the doctor it is burned skin, but with the legion? It smells like teen spirit.
---
Overcharge is useless on it's own
---
If anything it just means that players will do dumb things for extra points 
---
I dream that other studios with actual talent pick up on the genre and make a good game out of it like with how battle-royale games have been more polished with every iteration from a different company.
---
I'd say it's balanced. Yeah you can get baited and waste it, but sometimes it's just what you need to save your life while running to the exit 
---
To be fair, I could go to fiverr right now and pay someone to do a video about you and me having this conversation or to do a video about Donald Trump. Anyone could do a video for any reason about anything that might be happening or not happening. How does it make it this story untrue though? Simple, it doesn’t.
---
It has 16+6, -25%. So you could get 1 heal out of it, but then you'd need to be bloody quick at hitting the instaheal.
---
Console lol. You would have gotten hit every time on PC by any rank 10+ killer. Sorry for those poor chaps who are abused by the system
---
Lmao...or Pleb-News.

---
Will someone please google and contact Ochido or Erik to verify! I’d hate for this not to be real because I like the changes especially the battle royale mode even though it seems unlikely, considering how much effort the devs would have to put into it.

Mine aren't all that great either.

---
The kyleesadist one is the creator of the template,  who put the blank template on reddit. Or is there another I didn't see?
---
ah rip
---
The guy in the photo is the original Michael Myers, he made a cat pun. More relevant to the sub and follows the rules of the sub.  All your video needed was the stalking music from dbd and you’d be golden . Or just meme out with smol billy.
---
It is so much harder to get a 4k before 2 gens are completed than it is to get all 5 gens done as a survivor.
---
I do agree there, I wish the timer was lower but then I guess it could be too OP if they can toss it every few seconds.
---
Congrats. It’s hard. You figured it out. You can’t apply pressure to keep survivors from doing enough gens to deserve a chance at one escape. 
---
Whats wrong with her belly on the top right corner? 
---
Ruin is just weak
---
Overcharge is complete utter fucking trash.
---
:)
---
Where did the whole nea is killer thing come from?
---
Yes it does? Why does it even matter tho? What's wrong with slugging?
---
I got it because I didn’t want to run around as the default Legion and I accidentally bought the version that you could earn for free instead of the pay only so fml.

Quick! Someone play Moon!
---
This is the only answer
---
No, first of all, it -25% from 16, which is 4. Bandages adds 8 charges, so it's 20. If u use scyptic agent second (because positioning matters) it would be 24 - 25% which is 18. Regardless, it is one full health state.
---
Not a clue, I just know I found a way to equip killer's powers on survivors and thought the meme (chainsaw is the only one that actual renders, cannot actually play with them as it won't let me ready up, photo is from my friend's screen)
---
Might as well get Ruin. Every killer is running BBQ and Ruin these days. It’s like the self care or adrenaline for killers lol 
---
Thanks for verifying gf 
---
better spend those bloodpoints
---
Are you coming on to me?
---
Ok man, whatever makes you happy. 
---
I agree with you
---
I volunteer as tribute.
---
Yeah, but that's the point of the map, to be confusing, like a maze. 
---
Darn 
---
I'm not going to use a perk that works as long as the framerate wants it to
---
Only for the survivor. 
---
Did you notice survivor getting unhooked as the Hillbilly was half way to the hook?
---
I usually like being immersed because I'm not the best looper and I can't even lose killers. But I'm not immersed in a selfish way since I believe team work is necessary.
---
Jason was already licensed to the F13 game, and we already have Trapper, who is a Jason clone. Unfortunately, it's highly unlikely we'll see Jason joining the ranks.
---
Other than being a relatively cheap tactic, nothing. People just get real salty over it.  
---
I slug sometimes, if I think one of the remaining survivors knows where the hatch is.
---
When you dead hard in the middle of nowhere, thinking the killer will swing. Nah son, you're playing David, I ain't falling for that obvious dead hard.
---
Perhaps burn a white ward, if it's worth it
---
Oh yeah? You didn’t get to do a cool dash animation, did you trapper? Exactly. We’re out here with perks that make you do gens faster when the killer’s looking at you and not running the cool-animation-but-usually-unsuccessful masterpiece that is Dead Hard. Heathens. 
---
Kate just screams at the legion so hard their mixtape breaks which finally show them what the reality of the trials is which causes them to dissolve into nothingness
---
Devs have yet to give us bunny feng, before we gonna get kitty myers it's gonna take a decade or two
---
How do white wards work? Do they only work for an item that comes into the match with the ward or you keep whatever you died with if you burned one?
---
Top killers go Nurse, Spirit, a big gap, then Billy, then just below there you've got a Hag, Myers, and Huntress, in no particular order.
---
We'll get em when we get dedicated servers
---
Adorable!
---
Okay but who is he and why does he think he’s important enough to demand anything?
---
You did very well. They deserve that since is unsportsmanlike, when I play killer and I find one survivor, I put it in dying state and leave it on the ground exactly for that purpose - to see if the last survivor is willing to help its teammate or just waits for him/her to die (usually somewhere close by the hatch or even hiding in closets). 
---
Needless to say I always pick up the dying survivor and let it wiggle free and let it guide me to that asshole to kill him/her. I give the hatch to the unlucky survivor.
---
Dedicated servers have already been announced
---
This sounds like an amazing idea, though, the only problem with it is the button mapping for it. which button would it be mapped to? would it replace the normal hooking button or nah?
---
Ok i fucking lied, i killed him at the end, he is actually not a bad survivor, but i catch him on a locker so i made a experiment lmao, i actually add him on steam and discord, and this post is not for make fun of anyone... it just fucking made my day this guy.
---
I don't see the problem in an immersed survivors actually doing gens, the problem is survivors that just crouch around and hide in the corners of the map
---
I guess it's because his ears are so... weirdly shaped, they remind me of a scary old grandpa. You know how old men sometimes have these kinda flat, broad ears? :D
---
*NARNIA*
---
I did not know this. Thank you!
---
Oh yeah, kind of
---
will even have games with the god tier where you just get 3 gens done before you find the first sv because you checked the wrong 4 gens  first on coincidence

yes but paydays updated to this day. that being said it runs like dogshit on low still on my pc which can run witcher 3 60fps 1920x1080 on ultra settings. paydays op is even shittier on console.   
---
that being said there is potential for dbd? it can run skyrim special edition (which contrary to popular belief it is the special edition, just with lower render distance on foliage.) at 30 (and even 60fps if you hack your switch and the game to run uncapped) so there is potential if dbd is well optimsed

I run BBQ (for the grind), Ruin (for those x2 Prove Thyself Voicevom SWF) and the M&amp;A+Nurse's Calling combo.

But my dream build is M&amp;A+Nurse's Calling, Endurong and Spirit Fury. NOEM. No One Escapes Myers.

I have 900 hours in the game and I stream it, do you want proof?
---
Tbh I don't blame you. It feels really unfair even if it isn't.
---
Hex:Delusions sounds very cool
---
You can’t use them anymore though. Discovered my meg had one last week. 
---
he is on console
---
He’s capable of insta-downing.
---
Only Nurses and Billys can have decent map pressure, the rest of the cast of killers is seriously hindered
---
Against competent survivors, you'll have 3 gens popped by the time you get first hook
---
Yea it isn't mandatory, like using wraiths power isn't mandatory to win. Just makes it hella lot easier if the survivors aren't potatoes
---
To be fair if you were there from payday 2 beta til now
---
It's was a fucking mess, They just cleaned up better

New Killer: The Cigarette
---
I just want people to try to give Legion a run for his money instead of a non fun DC fest. I don't mind getting stabbed on the face.
---
Yes. I know he forces some non team oriented play styles, but he can be beaten. It would be great if he was reworked, but in the meantime, just accept the challenge, and try to have a GG.
---
So they're porting to the Switch before the other ports are even fixed? Sounds legit. 
---
Thanks! That was the idea!
---
Trust me, with no lag you're skipping around. Using Sprint Burst,  Adrenaline,  or getting hit from the killer? Yeah you're skipping around. Playing killer and someone decides to 360? Bye bye frames.  Bloodlust will do it as well.  The game got better recently for me but it still runs like a garbage pile compared to anything else I play. 
---
Yes, but only in open Areas without Windows or Pallets. His Power doesnt really gelp with loops.
---
When guy with ds gives you shit for dribbling.
---
Does it count as a staring contest if you don't have eyes?
---
KILLERS HATE HIM! This **ONE** simple trick to BLOW YOUR RANK UP and KILL HIS MORI!
---
this is war. survival is their responsibility not yours.
---
Unfortunately any kind of change that would give more bloodpoints is ignored by devs because they found and excuse for it already.
---
Just the normal mori button.
---
I'm confused.
---
I really hate all these looping stuff. I am almost never succesful in running away from a killer, even though i know most maps.
---
I just want a game where you really have a sense of fear and have to hide. 
---
Dun. Dun Dun. 
---
DUN DUN DUN DUN DUNUN DUN DUN DUN 
---
It used to not require a hook at all, you know.

A step in the right direction, that :)

Except it does because in the long run you waste more time.
---
I am now reporting you to the Behaviour HQ and getting ur ass banned in this very second.  Expect a police visit next week
---
I always do this, even if it means I get downed. I just turn away from others as soon as I see them with Bond. 99% of people don't even notice it though.
---
And in return, I either die on the hook because nobody tries to rescue me, or I get sandbagged like hell.
---
NOED is the punishment of generators being done too fast. The burden of NOED falls on the survivors since they control the gen completion pacing. If they just go gen to gen while the survivor is in one chase and it goes off it’s cause no one was checking. I don’t believe in any perk being called a crutch. Everything in this game is either a check or counter to something else except endgame perks. For me, NOED is just a block in the Endgame build setup. Just like Remember Me and Blood Warden, they pretty much have forced synergy and make builds wonky if they aren’t together. 
---
Is NOED op? Not at all. If you’re concerned about a perk on a killer, there are methods to getting around it. We have two perks and two items that can find totems. The only killer perk with 0 counterplay is Whispers.

---
This made my day. 😂
---
Ark was already released on the Switch some time ago my friend.
---
It actually runs worse than shit. Look it up in YouTube. Words can't describe how badly the game looks and runs on the Switch. 
---
Not really? Youre using a perk in game. I didnt say i liked the perk but its in the game for a reason. No matter how stupid of a perk it may be. 
---
Redeyez95   add me if you want 
---
Yeah I guess.
---
Yeah cant say i wanna wait 4 months for the anniversary event 
---
I did this to a leather face in the killershack earlier and moved around the gen as he moved around the room and kicked the gen. 
---
Fun Fact: Monitor and Abuse actually gives you +8 terror radius at all times and when you aren’t in a chase you get -16 terror radius. This keeps the game from having to adjust your TR multiple times when entering and exiting chases. T1 Myers has a 6m terror radius at base so Monitor gives you a 14m TR in a chase and a negative terror radius out of one. 
---
Hiding in a locker is always just bad
---
It would be sweet if it also charged in a chase. Imagine you manage to break LOS after many attempts, pebble is ready, you aim and throw it (preferably at a window or locker so it makes sense for there to be a noise notification) and boom! You now have enough time to crouch away. This would also make the stupid high amount of time it takes to charge make more sense and the perk would not be dogshit against stealth killers.
---
Well then again he can't spin any faster since controller limitations
---
I just wish I could see who burned which offering without having to wait until the end.
---
That way i can kill the bastard who burned to Lery's.
---
Because 4 minutes of doing actually nothing is boring? So putting that on someone is kind of a dick move?
---
Reposr
---
Template ain't mine. Also, any killer can use any perk once it's taught
---
Wait, repost? Can you show an earlier post that did this thing?
---
"cheap tactic" my ass, slugging is basically the only way to consistently apply pressure, there's a reason why every good killer who tries to win will slug. 
---
I'm not gonna say it's always fun, it isn't, but it's by far the strongest playstyle and the survs can counter it by now stacking up. I dont go out of my way to slug but if I see multiple survs then Im not gonna pick them up until they're down. 
---
But it's really fun to bleed out the corner-hugging Claudette when you have knockout :) 
---
Captain America - "I understood that reference".
---
Cathartic
---
More points overall if you just leave earlier to end the game faster andhop into another one. Better than 300 BP.
---
Lmao. Now I wanna see switch run like the last of us or something along the lines of that.
---
Vs a god tier Nurse you can't do anything either
---
But those are because of someone work into her, not a mindless design set
---
Nea's first mori
---
Saw this when my team was playing against Freddy they literally unhooked each other right after Freddy hooked them 
---
He posted the template so anyone can use it for shitposting
---
Key-word here is "relatively." It isn't so black and white. It all depends on how the killer does it.
---
TIL how it works thanks!
---
Even on the new map my totems tend to last 2-5 minutes tops. The Game and Lery's are pretty much the only maps that have decent spawns and even on those maps i've seen the totem show up in some dumb spots. 
---
For people outside America it may even make lags worse.
---
Some gens are on the only available loop or jungle gym, so there's not much choice in certain scenarios. For the most part, if I spot someone on a generator, I turn away, because otherwise I'm preventing gen repair which helps nobody
---
It's also the best way to turn the game to a crawl. You go off to heal, another person is being chased and now two people are basically doing fuckall and nothing. Part of the game is to get generators done. Impairing that helps the killer
---
If they are all 1/5 of screen that should not be that hard. But if everyone knows about everyone’s location and plans, it ruins the game for both killer and survivor.
---
I'm glad to not be the only one finding love for the movies due to DbD! The original 78 is an absolute classic, even more so when you know how little of a budget they had. 
---
Rather 10 seconds of dribbling than 30 seconds of chasing and then ANOTHER 10 seconds of carrying to hook
---
The old "Ethernet asphyxiation" 
---
Yha, I get it
---
That's not good game design.
---
That is also true. Small benefits I suppose but with how dark the map is you often can't even see a Survivor that's 3 feet in front of you.
---
It's not good or bad, is another type of map. It's like Lérys but less mazy.
---
*jUsT cLeAnSe ThE tOtEmS*
---
This is so much to ask for,  getting pinhead is legal work and coding IF they do get him, making new modes is a lot of coding and money, demanding a killer be buffed by Summer and a killer nerfed is just down right dumb, and really, a battle Royale? This dude is asking way too much of behavior
---
To clarify some things in the post, I am newer to the game, and thus I only have the crap lasts person Moris. The last guy literally dcd as I was killing him, and I didn’t get it. Seriously why are the survivors in this community so damn toxic? (Survivor main btw)
---
Imagine comparing being taken out of the match slightly faster due to your own mistakes for the player's benefit to intentionally stalling the game for no reason other than BM.
---
Moris aren't fun, yes, but they do serve a purpose. Stalling the game just to BM doesn't.
---
I like this
---
It gets better as you rank up, kinda. It’s best to just shrug it off. There’s nothing we can do, people are gonna DC on you no matter what. I love this game to death, but the player base is the most petty I’ve ever seen when it comes to being killed.
---
Mars
---
I frikken love farm games. For me it’s not necessarily super fun, but also no “unfun”.It lets me unlock more perks faster which allows me to have more fun /options to have fun in regular games. 
---
I may also be addicted to BP gains, heh. I often run bbq even on spooky Myers.
---
I mean why would you not camp you are securing that last kill at the end it’s fair game.
---
Hey OP I feel like this meme is poorly made can I remake it for you? 
---
He would be much better if he had just one mode where M1 attacks and M2 shocks.
---
Only dumb survives think that trust me. I play both sides very often and like to think the same way you do. I think it’s good for killers and survivors to think of both sides
---
Yeah, but to be fair every weak killer gets exponentially better with addons. 
---
[concern](/intensfies)
---
Not going to disagree with you that it is easily baited and countered, but i will say that along with Adrenaline, Dead Hard is like the only perk that can make a difference when you are being tunneled off hook or trying to escape the basement. This is literally the only reason I opt for DH over other exhaustion perks. 
---
Had that happen to me a few days ago. Best advice was to re-roll those mori dailies :(

Its hardly a set up. Just a hefty dell laptop which I thought would run it fine,obviously I was wrong. I am looking into getting a proper gaming laptop however because my desk is too small for a big PC set up. Do you have any suggestions?
---
Ahhh,  the "git gud" response.  I have a constant 20 ping that jumps no higher then 30. ISP is not my issue.  This is a constant issue with frames and bad optimization on console.  This is no secret to the community and it needs to be fixed. People like you that are okay with a game running at way below what should be considered standard is why this is STILL an issue years after release.  I love this game and have been playing it for years,  but this needs to be fixed. The fact that they are making another port before the fixing the first two is a slap in the face to the people who have been playing console and sticking up for BHVR during this whole "optimization pass" load of shit. 
---
I kept a Trapper busy for 2 gens in Sprigwood. He put the trap in one of the entrances of the school, I sabotaged it and instantly got into the locker. He comes back, looks around, resets the trap. Rinse and repeat for 2 full gens.
---
Funny thing is he never checked the locker, last time he just picked the trap and left. 
---
I depiped, but it was worth it.
---
I thought the same thing friend
---
This is a great idea.   I love the hex perk.
---
This happens to me at least twice a day
---
That explains it 
---
I had BBQ invitations on my huntress a few weeks back, F.
---
Misses a skillcheck and then sprintbursts away
---
Played with a huntress who had the bubba offering. She was so much fun. My mates and I had a great time at the exit gate while he was cutting trees, hiding behind the walls, doing pirouettes till we said goodbye.
---
Joke
---
I usually get more points securing my kill because survivors feed them selves to me. Even going from a 1k to 2k because I pulled one off and just dropped him there till the sacrifice finished.
---
Evading and juking are to different things. For juking just practice, for evading Spine Chill and don't panic.
---
oh okay. well, Canada is still an English speaking country. the translations dont matter though. in order to communicate with your teammates in the chats, you'll have to speak english. sure, you can translate the game itself, but it doesnt change the fact that you need to speak English to communicate
---
well then wouldnt everyone just speak their native language then lol
---
Ok! Just curious, thought it'd be something else as you could give them the suspense of either killing them with the hook or by your own hand. (For me the Mori kill button is RT? I don't remember, been a while since my last mori lol)
---
canada is english/french but ok. and i do speak french
---
I took inspiration from other perks when i made a few of these. The idea for separate the school came from Prove Thyself. It's like, the opposite, but better. I made it stronger to signify it being a hex perk. 
---
Surf and turf is kinda the opposite of Bbq and chilli. 
---
I haven't played killer in a long time but I wanted to grind some BP with BBQ+C
---
Due to rank resets I was rank 15 and playing with players that were still learning the game
---
Due to poor planning on their part (everyone was in the basement shack, or close by) I was able to hook all four of them (at different points, wasn't camping so they had chances to get off/get away) within a few minutes, hooking 2 of them twice. No gens were done and I felt bad, and I got my BBQ stack so I just let them escape the basement and chilled down there the rest of the game 
---
They came back when the gates were powered and I came up with them and we farmed a little bit, then they left all 4 of their items at the exit gate for me as thanks. I thought that was so nice!!
---

Very interesting. I imagine the entity appearing to him while deep down in the ocean. His level could be an old misty boat yard.

No, I just said this is a repost. If you want to rant get out of my comment, I read enough whiny pussies just sorting by new, I don't need more.
---
And even then it will drop fps after the first patch, which they will ignore. They fooled me on ps4. Wont get fooled again.
---
Is it even worth saving up cakes, streamers, and puddings exclusively for 2x bp events?
---
I dont recall what it's called.  But this hex would work great with the legion perk that turns the gen aura yellow when 2 or more survivors are on it.
---
Surprisingly few people gift any consumables for some strange reason. It's a great gift and will definitely be appreciated
---
Freddy is different seeing how you have an 8 second timer before he can do anything rushing him is an effective strategy
---
I like his little pause to survey the landscape before rushing off. I bet he thought he was being clever, the whole time not realising there was someone right beside him lul
---
Nothing to hear you out here. People dodge in 0.1 seconds when the ping hasn’t settled yet.
---
Looking back is a very important but it takes some getting used to
---
If you have trouble pulling it off,  try running away normally and turning only from time to time.
---
Ideally you want keep track of the killer at all times and occasionaly in front of you to find the most optimal path
---
banned because the devs are racists LUL

Seems cool, kinda funny how whenever I see one for these posts, one or a couple of the perks revolves around seeing people's aura lol. Would be nice to see some perks with different qualities

Is marked as shitpost so I'm pretty sure it's a meme. In addition Googling "Erik Estavillo video games" shows that Erik has stated that he "won't be sueing any more companies" after sueing Playstation, Microsoft, Nintendo, and Blizzard Entertainment.

It's a meme about a living meme tied to this community's living meme.

That’s true. I don’t like going against The Legion mainly because it’s boring imo and I also find them boring to play as. The Legion sounds great on paper but so many things weren’t thought of they were added to the game
---
Im just going to throw this out there: if I know youre a streamer and you came in with friends Im 10/10 dodging you. I have better things to do than have streamers and their fanboys be toxic to me for 20 mins straight. 
---
The optimization will be funny. It will run like on a Gameboy Advance or something. Whoever mains Nurse on Switch will have my Respect.
---
Great write-up, but I'm a little confused. Are the rankings based on physical strength or overall athletics? It seems like you say the first one in the header, but then you put weak but fast characters like Feng over ones like Jake (an adult male who is a woodsman/survivalist).
---
this is tied to that "unbreakable" bug. It's not neccesarily unbreakable that does it, but it's what i've taken to calling it.  
---
If you get up as SOOON as the killer tried to pick you up (whether it's wiggling out of a trap when trapper presses space, or unbreakable when they press space, or no mither, etc.) Then whenever the killer swings, you do this weird floating thing. We've all probably seen the bug, it's funky, we laugh, it's awesome. can be really wonky but hilarious and rare.  
---
Now during that bug, when the killer swings, you do the carry animation, And if you jump in a locker when the killer swings, you get bugged such as this. lmao. That's the only way i've been able to recreate this bug consistently, it takes a lot of doing.  
---
Awesome screenshot though, sorry about your loss of that beautiful loot. 
---
Four words that ruin this...
---
“Killer wiggle meter macro”
---
I already know people that have a struggle macro so they don’t get strained as much on hook. If the killer has perfect inputs on his wiggle meter he gets easy ranged one shots . 
---
It’s a cool idea but it requires tweaking. 
---
Especially when the other people on your team run straight towards you while you're doing a gen... You know some shit's up and then--BAM! You're hooked.
---
Because you can loop the trapper? Lol
---
Selling bloodpoints 100gp ea
---
Again this list is meant to list the Survivor's capabilities to fight off a Killer. Weaker (physically) Killers like Legion and Pig (who are essentially just young adults with knives) could be fought off by some of the higher tier Survivors, with someone like David King probably being able to wrestle with a Killer like The Clown or The Hag.
---
If I was to judge them on Survivability I'd basically just be judging their perks in a real-life setting.
---

I like edgy teenagers and I’m bad at mind gaming in chases lmao (don’t downvote pls)

Fookin' ded 'ard, man! *clicls toubge and sighs deep*
---
Sometimes you don’t lose them. I honestly think it’s by the games mercy. It’s fucking stupid. Sometimes I lose them, and sometimes I keep them when I get back to the main menu. It’s really frustrating.
---
This. Is. So. GOOD!
---
They were already incredibly nerfed, remember that you didn't need to even hook anyone back then. One time I was incredibly unlucky, like, the unluckiest of the unlucks, and died in like 30 seconds into a game because of that . . .
---
I could consider them OP against people when they're still around rank 20 but the better rank you have the less OP they are.
---
I loaded into a game last night and specifically tried to avoid getting caught first. Spawned with a Claudette and she goes to the nearest generator and I’m all like “lmao R.I.Pepperoni gurl I ain’t dying today” and I go and hide behind a brick wall. Billy revs his chainsaw from across the map, completely ignores the gen-in-progress, and chainsaws me a new asshole. Truly h8 this game 😪😓😪
---
Truly 20/20 vision.

Don’t drop pallets? Traps are easy to dodge. And if you get caught by one, trapper skill.

Exactly! I'd recommend the original Freddy movie too. Even though it's not as good and "serious" as Halloween, it's still a good movie.
---
Sooooo Perkless Freddy &gt; any Freddy confirmed 
---
I’m talking about the news report part. Not the Ochido banner thing. I already knew about that!
---
Welcome to **Loading screen crash simulator 2017**
---
Try not to hide as much if you can help it as it makes it harder for the other survivors and yourself to try and win. If your not already I would practice looking behind you during chases to keep an eye on killer. Someone already mentioned good perks to try to get so I won't bring those up. 
---
This shit is why I have anxiety.
---
Just some dumb idiot, I'll tell you that much.  
---
That’s.... amazing
---
You put Quentin below the likes of Dwight despite Quentin having actively fended off Freddy and is an athlete? What?
---
No, because they’re additive, not multiplicative.
---
r/dbdgonewild They never think its real, untill they click it and instantly regret everything
---
Report him. That's a ban.
---
Not sure why you get downvoted. Thats basically what happened - dude getting bored and paid for fake news reading. 
---
Oh, I misunderstood the post
---
No cannibal &gt;: 
---
Pick up fun addons that will make you have a blast regardless of if you won or not
---
Cancel the dance is just bitter murmurs
---
The Entity empowers the killers, making them bigger and stronger than the survivors. Mike can lift a grown man with one arm, FFS. 
---
Except Freddy for some reason, Entity seems pleased with how he's at survivor-height.
---
Should I ask her to draw the cannibal for you? 😂
---
As a cannibal main, pl0x 
---
Wait I didn’t see the exposed 🤗 
---
As he proceeds to dedard into a wall 
---
&gt;I’m confused how the spear gun would interact with survivors. If the survivor is injured and the killer doesn’t wiggle, does the survivor stay standing as if they wiggled out of a grab?
---
&gt;
---
I imagined the spear impaling them in the leg. Then the survivor tries to pull it out while the killer pulls on the Rope. Then if they pull it out, they get an animation like when you're freed from a bear trap
---
Oh nice doctor is fun but i don't really get the hang of him might give him another shot when I can.
---
Not really since they do not stack up. 
---
This is one thing that bothers me about them too. Like the trapper killed a bunch of ppl by luring them into a mine and blowing it up; he also tortured his own father. Wraith crushed a dude in a car crusher and took his skull to use a fucking weapon. The legion kids were just edgy vandals that one day took it too far and the second they did the entity was like "I NEED YOU"
---
Well, if its a killer you constantly level up, then just use those good addons occasionally as you will get more back. Also, 99% of the killers have very good green addons that will easily get the job done and they really aren’t that rare. Hope this helps :) 
---
I have lots of fun with Freddy and Wraith, and Freddy was my main until I wanted to get into the higher ranks, so I learned Spirit and I was able to reach rank 4 before the new season. 
---
He wasn't t-bagging douche.
---
I thought surf and turf at least was decent. The idea behind my survivor was altruism
---
I did not know that was sub was real... 
---
damn, that looks Brand new 
---
why?
---
I don't understand why some people get pissy watching this. Are you suppose to just sit there and take the hit? Hell no.
---
HEEEEELLLLL NO!
---
Pulled off a 4k with Legion and got told I was a good Legion... Then Inc friend requests... Lawl
---
And instead of a light coming out it's the red stain
---
ooOOooOOo I like this!
---
I am a Freddy main, of course #SupportFreddyDBD. I NEED TO PROVE PEOPLE WRONG ABOUT HIM BEING THE "WORST" KILLER IN DBD
---
I leave and scout. Grants me the final 2 kills.
---
All the time.
---
I've never heard of this before. But ya it's something I wouldn't care about if someone bragged about it. 
---
Not healing only works if the Legion doesn’t take advantage of that and stops using Frenzy when you’re injured. Otherwise 100% agree with what you said.
---
Are u PS4 or pc?
---
*tips TruCap*
---
Ps4
---
You don't, but I think you still get some sort of emblem points (forgot what it was)
---
And in the DBD find players community 
---
Well I think it’s relevant because he’s the original Myers, and yknow we use Myers in DBD ? I didn’t think this would be a problem. 
---
Reading that in a proper manc accent is so satisfying 
---
You could at least fucking download the image
---
I’m really bad at this 
---
Rin. Her story, her power, her weapon. Everything. Rin is a great killer. From innocence to madness. 
---
Her addons' stories are beautiful as well, Mother-Daughter Ring is depressing.
---
We all forgot one important thing here:
---
**HAPPY BIRTHDAY MAN!** Have a wonderful party with your friends!
---
^((Also thanks for the Silver award which I probably don't deserve but I appreciate it. :D))
---
EXIT THE MAP, STOP FUCKING AROUND
---
I still have brown map offerings too. Why did they get rid of those does anyone know??
---
I don't think they can because she's licensed 😞
---
Is that a lag spike or is that just straight up hecks? 
---
Feels like a fiver skit. 
---
But it's not?
---
Facts
---
Why exactly?
---
I have hundreds of Ebony's and I refuse to use them. It's unfair to the survivors, I won't have them play half the match just to get some lol's. 
---
I have mori'ed plenty of people though, with Devour Hope.
---
Want to Mori people? Earn it, a hook and a hit isn't fair.
---
Moris should be rare, they should be those "WTF" moments, not a common one.
---
Lol this was my friend for like first 40 playthroughs with Deadhard
---
It happens 1 time (per person using it) and you can do things to lessen the effects. Position yourself better if possible when you pick them up, they don’t get to decide where they come off at. use enduring. Think ahead and play better. Or cheat and dribble them like a no skill loser, the devs say that’s ok. 
---
When I play survivor I don’t use DS because it’s garbage. There are so many more useful and fun perks to use. 
---
Did you get out after?
---
Eh whoa slow down there fella, you don't come over here stealing my memes
---
Upvoted. I like this idea.
---
When swf/solo are balanced out do killers can be made competitive vs communication and efficiency. 
---
Wrong :)
---
Sprint Burst is a Legion’s worst nightmare. When you see a Legion frenzying at you, sprint directly away and they won’t get you. That will break their frenzy chain and force them into a normal chase until their meter builds up again.
---
If you’re in a group when the Legion finds you, try to be the first one to get hit with frenzy. Usually the Legion will go chase someone else. I know it’s selfish, but I’m usually willing to sacrifice teammates because I know I will stay focused on gens and try to maximize my efficiency with the gen rush.
---
Generally I recommend staying away from teammates when you know you’re playing Legion. Legion will almost always run Discordance, so there’s no point in doing gens together unless they’re already occupied. Staying together only means more frenzy chains. The only exception to this is:
---
If the Legion is focusing on someone, gen rush the crap out of them. Unless the chasee screws up and gets downed immediately (i.e., not downed via frenzy), you should have at least 30-60 seconds of uninterrupted gen time. That’s enough time to finish a gen with someone else, or possibly even finish the gen solo if he doesn’t come right for you. The bonus here is that Discordance might force the Legion off your teammate who’s being chased to chase you off the gen, which means the Legion 100% wasted that chase time.
---
I think the last point is where most people falter against Legion - they’re not efficient with their time. You need to maximize your time on the gens, which is generally true against all killers but especially true against Legion.
---
I love me the Billy Boi.
---
His downright brutality is personally what I find absolutely terrifying about him. Let's face it, it's not his goofy looking face that's any scary. The dude hangs out on a cornfield running mach-one at any living thing and cuts it up. He doesn't even give a fuck. No remorse, but doesn't seem to enjoy it either. He just does it. Shits pretty metal.
---
Mechanically speaking, there's so many neat little things you can do with him as well. He was easy enough for me to pick up when I was new (console player) but is more than good enough to handle some of the toughest survivor builds as I started facing better players more frequently.
---
Doing things like surprising people who are hiding behind a pallet in a jungle gym, by curving that saw right into their face right after you rev it up just feels so nice.
---
Tldr; Billy is my dad and I love him
---
Thanks ! :)
---
Probably heard you! I play Spirit and I know I wear Spirit and I wear a headset with my sound pumped way up, and a lot of Spirit mains do the same thing.
---
I recently did the same thing, too. I downed a Nea, but there was a Kate trying to flashlight me and I heard her Kate-noises so I didn't pick up Nea and I downed Kate (both while Hallowed Grounds were active), and then I had too many bodies to know what to do with.
---
The Doctor. First killer I played as (had to do a Bloodpoint challenge) and I really enjoyed it. I don't play as him a lot but when I do, it's always fun.
---
Cosplay mini prop
---
Ok, makes sense
---
Maybe if you have to think about eating then you shouldn't eat
---
The video is marked as a shitpost, I think...
---
I heard that the video is a joke, and the OP of this thread night be taking it seriously.
---
Happy birthday! Your friend seems awesome 
---
It was marked news when it first went up
---
LOLLLLLLL
---
The shittiest people are at lowest and highest ranks.
---
Nurse.
---
Billy.
---
Spirit.
---
Yeah, it's meant to be comboed with Bitter Murmurs. You finish your gen, and then you are suddenly revealed and exposed, and Harry Warden is now on a killing spree, kind of like the film.
---
It's literally in the title... So the other teammates know whether the Killer has NOED or not. 
---
I did the killer was nice enough to drop me at the gate, she had seen me leave prior. 
---
But the icons will remain small, right?
---
Double bloodpoints + BPS/EC/SP = Triple bloodpoints, not 4x. Unless you're explicitly farming bloodpoints during double BP events it doesn't make a difference.
---
When the game finally gets its stuff together
---
But they’re 60k.... it’s such an expensive gamble. If I buy spirit, and perk up with rancor, does that count for those?
---
This is cute but it has absolutely nothing to do with Dead By Daylight. I couldn't post a clip from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre without it being removed, but somehow this is fine?
---
Pig because of the anti-bacon society, ambushing survivors and saving my traps till all gens are powered
---
The Spirit because everything 
---
Lmao this one is great
---
'Separate the School' works against you. You want survivors to be clumped up on the same gen.
---
Thanks. This all sounds good. I feel like my biggest issue with Legion is it seems like he’s everywhere. I don’t know if I keep getting him on small maps or what. But I feel like I can’t do anything because he always pops up next to me and the other survivors constantly even if we’re at four different gens. 
---
I'm super interested in how the map for a chapter like this would look. Some misty coastal town type of thing, or going full Soma with a creepy underwater facility. 
---
It all starts with game mechanics.
---
If you report a player, he'll report another, the more people you ban the less people will play this game.
---
There are HUNDREDS of games that are coming out, many people switched to Far Cry, Apex when they came out, I'm waiting for Ghost of Tsushima, Death Stranding, Cyberpunk 2099, and Outerworlds to come out. After that, DBD will be dead to me.
---
Degenerates like you belong on a hook.
---
Nope, this same picture was posted this week
---
Next time leave and look at his perks. Though he cheated, you almost asked for it lol. The cheating part sucks ass, but you not leaving and dying was a good laugh. I feel bad for you. 
---
Jason.
---
That's all.
---
:D
---
Read the title. "Was trying to figure out if the killer had NOED while leaving". The other survivors were also opening the other door. 
---
Yeah, I feel bad for them
---
The other 3 survivors were opening the other exit. In the title I was trying to figure out if the killer had NOED so the other survivors are aware.
---
But then they'll be called racists by the Regressives for cultural appropriation". ;(
---
i tried to let the last guy get some point in but he refused, he just wanted to be hooked. 
---
there needs to be a bigger punishment for dc'ing so it doesn't ruin the game for other survivors. 
---
I prefer Dinnerbone 
---
Might be biased but Scottish gamers are the best lol
---
Ehhh it’s a hard one to make mechanically. It works in games like Last Year because you’re always together, but DBD is a bit harder. I like the reeling in though. 
---
Maybe make it reloadable, with skillchecks that get harder for both sides as it goes on until one misses. 
---
Nealeh
---
Hex: Ruin has come to our Family....
---
I played a trapper last night who let us finish the gens and didn’t really pay any attention to us. He just did his own thing by setting traps around the outside of the shack and stepping into them. Watching him circle the shack and hearing “URGH” over and over was a very amusing treat. 
---
I like to main legion mainly because I hate looping and being able to stab people multiple times is fun and grabbing people form lockers when their aura is shown during frenzy
---
I agree with Rhiever on most points, especially Sprint Burst. Try to go lone wolf, if you are with teammates when he shows up, scatter like cockroaches. In terms of the chase, I find doubling back (especially in corn and swamp maps), particularly during his Frenzy stun, is effective as well since Legion can easily lose people.
---
I also recommend Bond. It’s good enough to play against any killer so doesn’t feel wasted or too specific but especially useful against Legion. You can see if someone is getting chased and get away from them so Legion doesn’t get alerted to your presence. Also if you are in the chase, it can help you stay away from your teammates and prevent him from chaining so they can stay on their gens, which ultimately is what keeps the game from getting drawn out. 
---
I’d also say pay close attention to the HUD. If someone is attacked by Legion, watch that bleed out timer. As long as it is not going down, you know he’s focused on that person and you can do gens... sometimes even together with someone despite Discordance. Might seem basic but it really is important to be as aware as possible. 
---
The real question here is how the fuck did he fuck it up while nurse is slower than him
---
Rin honestly ticks all the boxes of what a good killer should be. Looks aesthetically amazing, with a balanced, interesting power, well written lore and 3 good perks. They honestly knocked it out of the park with the shattered bloodline dlc and I have mailed spirit ever since she came out for all of those reasons.
---
If you had been keeping up with the game, I believe it is reasonable they simply used it as a scapegoat. Every patch broke the game a little worse and their reputation among their community was dropping fast,  including the size of the community. 
---
Then they were slacking on their kickstarter rewards. Think about the latest Fallout game, but a smaller scale. 
---
Why’d they leave?
---
I.. You...
---
Runescape!!!!!!!!!
---
Not OP, but it does seem to be used by a lot of lazy killers that don't seem to be able to function without it, which saddens me a little. I *do* get pissy when someone's using a one-shot killer and still needs NOED to get anywhere, comes across as though the person doesn't play killer, they just play NOED.
---
Only the finest RuneScapes 
---
Well there's a chance it could happen AFAIK.
---
Back before the new Halloween movie they said they were working on get cosmetics for a licensed character(s). They haven't said anything further, so it's possible, although extremely unlikely, you could see a new Laurie outfit.
---
I wouldn't hold my breath though. They never confirmed the cosmetics were even Halloween related, and even if they were it's been over 3 months since they said anything.
---
I really want to see the look on their face when that happens because it’s so satisfying to basically say screw you to attempted flash saves
---
Yeah but huntress gets looped bad and half the time as hag even at high ranks I'll put down like 4 traps entire game even on large maps like coldwind and still get a 4k
---
I had a game where lf spawned next to me and then tunneled me for like half the game :(
---
It sounds like you go into a game thinking it’s going to suck. (I do that a lot and it’s no fun). 
---
I mean my suggestion is more of a psychological one, but maybe just fuck around for a bit. ChNge up your build, try different killers. If that doesn’t work, play survivor or a different game. Video games are for fun OP, don’t get too stressed 
---
I meant deactivate
---
Whenever i play with 2 of my friends, one of them ALWAYS gets insta hooked farmed by our 4th survivor teammate we dont know. Its probably the reason he doesnt play much.
---
i want like, you can play with other people that are next to you and everyone has their own unique screen. Like with Mario Kart DS' download play, or local play with Smash Ultimate.
---
I really like the idea of the hatch being like the exit gate, where you have to open it...
---
Disarm!  Yes this makes sense.
---
I took the pic before the game started because I had a feeling they wouldn't play nice. After the gens were done and the gates were open, the Dwight wouldn't leave. I went to the basement, which was directly underneath the hatch, and checked the lockers, because I've seen vids and complaints of people doing that to hold games hostage. Got lucky and he was in the first locker I checked in the basement, so they called me a cheater.
---
Thanks to all you survivors that keep the games fun by not stalling intentionally unless you're saving someone or waiting for your last fellow to get through the gate.
---
It's one of the best designed perks in the game imo. Fun to use, requires a bit of skill, and changes the dynamic of the game slightly. 
---
I like that idea. But it feels like it would be boring once the killer shoots you. Just back and forth skill checks until someone screws up?
---
Never thought about watching the timer! Thanks! I’m going to start leveling Dwight to get bond. 
---
Yeah, didn't remember how to say it in English
---
Pfft, childish survtard.
---
I continue to fail to understand why killers are so salty they didn't get a 4k.  3k is already imba...4k is a perfect game.  4k and 0k should be 1 in 20 games.
---
Every time I play Survivor.
---
Yeah the legions I play with typically hit someone once and then get someone else and continue like that. 
---
Do you know how his aura reading works? To my understanding, he can see your aura if you are not injured and he’s in frenzy?
---
press window+r and paste this %LocalAppData%\\DeadByDaylight\\Saved\\Config\\WindowsNoEditor
---
Time to farm!
---
... hopefully
---
I'm not forced to play with an unfun, broken killer. Don't be an entitled little bitch.
---
The idea is that the hook the survivor is on stays yellow an additional 4 seconds and the icon on the bottom right stays hooked. The only way i could see the killer knowing the survivor was rescued is if they are camping or they notice the survivors sacrifice bar stop moving for 4 seconds
---
Gotta love the obvious "not killer bias" on this reddit when there are people still somehow blaming the survivor for something like this over the killer.
---
100% sure you're a baby killer who lobby dodges swf teams. Oh the irony.
---
Absolutely blyatiful
---
The only gate that was open was the one I was at. When I was placed on the hook the other gate was just opening all other 3 survivors were at the other gate there was no way for me to know that with the perk build I had.
---
 I worry about NOED until everyone is out. It's nice warning for my teammates so they don't stay and goof around and get themselves killed. In this case he did have NOED and a lag switch ):
---
Yeah people will ready up with like 600 ping then accuse me of lag switching it's the worst from both perspectives lol
---
I baited swings from a LF who was taking another survivor to the basement until he dropped them at the bottom of the stairs.  The other person ran out while I stood there awkwardly and he revved his saw.  Jumped into a locker, then jumped out and he M1 me (I was already injured).  Team left me on the hook to die while they escaped.  I DIDN'T MIND AT ALL, until the post game chat when nobody thanked me.
---
Plus you make the killer waste some time.
---
Thank you man ❤
---
Why does David have tiny Trapper arms?
---
I know, and I feel you, but sometimes people play Legion.
---
When you’re farming but the killer has noed 💀
---
You also realize that you can't see killer perks without exploiting anymore until the match is over, right? Oh wait, you don't...
---
I get so salty when I use deadhard and it for some reason vacuums me into the wall or the killers. Lately been having issues when it seems like the killer deadhards with me too. ._.
---
I was gonna comment this, so take my upvote.
---
Wouldn't you see the "Exposed" status effect if NOED was activated?
---
Or does it not give an indication?
---
I play on console. You shouldn't be good at nurse on console. But I've had nurses destroy me and my team because nobody plays nurse, so we have no idea what to do.
---
Huntress is good at stopping chases which is a big deal these days.
---
You can't see the killer's perks anymore, at least not until everyone else is dead or has escaped
---
Its your fault for being toxic teabaging the killer. You probably knew if he had DC, but you are a toxic baby on a hook
---
you simply don't try to chainsaw at a T-loop, you know very well you're not going to hit it if the survivor you're chasing has any braincells
---
Oh okay. I completely misunderstood. By indicator, do you mean like those little sound orbs? Or do they look different?
---
I was also told this doesn’t work if you’re in a locker. Is that true? Thanks for all your help. It’s hard to keep up with all the strategies. 
---
I mean what you're doing is a viable strat to waste the killers time as much as possible to secure other's escaping or getting to the other gate as well as what you said, finding out about NOED. Forcing the killer to waste as much time as possible on forcing you out the match seems viable to me.
---
Im sorry but what the fuck really? I am of Hispanic heritage and I honestly don't care of the race of the survivor or killer all I know is the game is good fun why ruin it with some really a idiotic thing like this....
---
Why didn’t you just post a link to the vid? Jw
---
Would still have to pay for him in this case.
---
Yeah but she gets looped a lot
---
Genetic anomaly where the average height in the town was six inches taller than the regular average, and Frank is just big.
---
Also Frank was 19 when the gang formed, and the others were younger but still at least high school kids. There's a few more potential years of growth, but like, that's about when people get as tall as they're going to be.
---
OP= overpowered, opposition or operator
---
‘Who the fock can do that?!’
---
Yeah but that's the meme here. He's been trying to chainsaw and it isn't working so he's getting his mallet to m1.

No it's the fact that peer to peer will always cause more latency issues than a decent dedicated server would.

---
The indicator looks similar to the explosion indicator that a killer would see when someone fails a skill check, minus the sound of course. 
---
They would see you in a locker. Don’t go in a locker to escape Legion in frenzy - you will 100% get grabbed.
---
Huntress gets rarely looped half as bad as hag and huntress can down all survivors faster than  any killer on paper (apart from leatheterface but lol). That's why she is so good. Hag is more consistent but not half as strong in an ideal situation.
---
It’s that or an unbalanced wiggle bar. Back to back fast skill checks that get smaller and smaller is at least interesting.
---
That’s just a big daddy 
---
There is difference between just waiting near the exit gates and behaving like an asshole by taunting the killer.
---
Didn’t know you were sWf lol that’s the only time you can’t see killer perks. To prevent call outs for your team. 
---
That explains a lot lol
---
That's pretty much the chat in addition to accusations of hacking, the Dwight had a ban on his profile when i peeked it before the game too, so I knew what to expect. 
---
Shit I did but its not showing, fantastic
---
I don't see the problem, you got your answer 
---
Then someone had a similar idea cause I literally made this myself
---
Yellow when not in a chase, turns red when in a chase
---
Huntress is very map dependent and there are not many huntresses that are very good. I would go against you as a huntress but i have been on a months break from dbd so i doubt i would be on my best

Get yourself Insidious on lvl 3 and you got yourself the Basement Bubba starter pack
---
Or Legion sucks ass so bad they left. I don't support this in any way mind you, but what you said is so random and comes out of nowhere, so you can vent about survivor rules.
---
I’m mistaken then sorry. Still, tea bagging at the gate is never smart. 
---
It was rampant on console when it came out but I haven’t seen it there in maybe a year. Is it only on PC still? 
---
I can’t read the messages
---
You absolutely cannot see the killers perks in solo or swf untill everyone is out of the match
---
All I want is Ultimate Alliance 3 and I'm not buying a Switch just for it. I used to love Nintendo. Learned my lesson with their consoles after I got a Wii.
---
Lol I just wanna play the game because I paid for it. 
---
You’re too scared to play when matches. Oof
---
So kill them for doing nothing and move on? 
---
It’s not that hard. 
---
Yeah no one got down so this was a shock

I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted, but I have to admit that I also downvoted you just cause everyone else did. It's funny to see how many nonsensical downvotes a comment can rack up.
---
Read it slowly 
---
&gt; but what you said is so random and comes out of nowhere,
---
lmfao you know that's not true. Look in this goddamn comment section there are multiple saying it's okay for survivors to DC against Legion
---
&gt; Or Legion sucks ass so bad they left
---
Survivors have this double standard where things that suck ass for killer don't justify a DC
---
Well a tier 3 camp with it would be scary as fuck lol
---
Not sure if you ever played the game before but... 
---
If you look at 0:13 I'm standing there, at 0:14 I'm being carried. When a killer hits you, you hit the downed state and the killer cleans his weapon. He does not automatically have you in his arms and teleport 20 feet away. This is called a [lag switch](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-lag-switch-817481). 
---
It's all good/ This subreddit is trial by fire lol 
---
The ironic thing is that I was being serious. I just started to play killer after playing only survivor for three years. 
---
This was sarcasm. This was a joke. I clearly see the issue here, I do not condone or support lag switching. I shouldve included a damn /s
---
“Is this real” not a single word in that sentence makes me think it’s about the lawsuit. But no Ochido is not fucking suing the devs.
---
I know about the old days, I bought this game at release, and I didn't say more pallets, I said more consistent, so things like Pallet Town and maps with less than 5 pallets don't happen at all.
---
&gt;judith tombstone and fragrant tuft of hair
---
More like why not? 
---
I use pig because not only can she sneak up on you and cancel loops with her dash but she is also the strongest end game killer. If the match is going bad for you all you need to do is to down them in the end and place a trap on them. Its so funny seeing 3 survivors running around like chickens to escape from the trap.
---
It's not obvious on the killer side that you tried to bait the NOED, it just looked like you were BMing him, also you play Claudette. At this point in the game, everyone is safe, even with NOED, you just wait around the door until he leaves. Doesn't excuse his lagswitch though.
---
Yeah, Legion has made survivors that don't care about other people's games show up more frequently now and yeah it sucks bad.
---
&gt;Survivors have this double standard where things that suck ass for killer don't justify a DC
---
Well those people are damn delusional imo but i does go both ways, survivors just don't get the same amount of shit for a dc as killers do.
---
People not to be assholes, but yeah, it's really hard to find them in this community.
---
The match is going to be horrible for them anyways so if I DC maybe they will do it as well which will save them from having to play against it 
---
i was about to finish the last gen while i could see someone was being chased by a tier 3 myers so i left it at 99% until they got knocked down hoping they’d have adrenaline to get back up and they did so we all escaped :) they didn’t thank me because they probably just thought it was lucky that the gen popped at that moment but it still feels good
---
Me as Quentin who loaded into a r2 game (survivors and killer) being r7 and getting hooked three times within 30 seconds.
---
Cmon now, own it. You’re teabagging - ofc that doesn’t mean you deserve the lag switch but it’s definitely not being helpful, you were bm’ing him hahaha 
---
Well if your on this sub you know why people dc vs legion and you know people will dc 
---
ya
---
Who says I didn’t
---
Lol, in the ending he was clearly going after you, so yeah...  
---
T O B E C O N T I N U E D
---
Nah he's not Scottish, I'm not actually sure where he's from. He's northern but not that northern.
---
Could grab the hook off the post, stick the survivor on it, then yeet it back on
---
False. A Killer can absolutely tell when there's lag, and it can absolutely screw them up.
---
You are so precious and innocent.
---
Have you ever heard of r/dbdgonewild by any chance?
---
That's also what happens when Myers moris him.
---
Or when he gets stuck in a bear trap.
---
^(Trust me, I've seen pictures.)
---
Didn't even let the last guy do 2 gens for sticking around, damn son.
---
No im saying if the host is lagging and not u as a player how can u do anything as a survivor 
---
He always blames a certain perk on why he failed the smallest action, or is just blind.  He’s playing Wraith with NOED this one time, and walks right past a Claudette who wasn’t even crouching.  The fact he always says “Deddard” is a meme at this point
---
Damn so close!
---
I play more killer than survivor, but I do this 100% of the time in order to see if the killer has NOED.  Especially against a killer like Trapper or Wraith. It's a smart play and dumb if the killer wants to show his hand.  At the very least, it wastes time for the killer, allowing your teammates more of a chance to escape. 
---
People are so narrow minded about the imaginary rules this community has placed on this game.  
---
Oh that’s  what you meant I didn’t notice what you meant
---
This meme format has been done so much, I wouldn't know if this is a repost or not.
---
When you get that "180s Coop Action" Ritual
---
r/nicewraiths
---
I love nurse's design and power so much. Same with spirit. They're both so cool and so freaky to play as and against. It's always fun to recognize the skill involved in playing both of them.
---
The killer can look at survivor profiles in the lobby, but it doesn't do much just than confirm whether people are friends. If I see in going against a tactical swf group I just throw together a build for more BP since my loss is assured
---
I’m in shambles. 
---
You don't and if you haven't hooked them then you don't get your BBQ stack. There should be more of a punishment for DC.
---
I feel like that’s too similar to spirit :/
---
So your saying to make him a shitty Spirit?
---
Thats pretty much spirit tho if you take away deep wound.
---
And jut on pm o8i80  o8i k
---
She was seeing if he had noed I'm a killer main but do this as survivor if the others ain't at the gate, better to have a warning safely than finding out he had noed the hard way.
---
No way to tell if they are going to be toxic, but if you did somehow know the people and they are purposefully abusing or prolonging the game that makes sense 
---
I honestly don't mind playing against Legion... can anyone fill me in why people think he's broken?
---
No it isn't, he can still down people on the way to the gates, what a ridiculous thing to say. Noed is a worry until you actually leave.
---
You're actually a massive idiot.
---
When you typed this out, at any point did you think to yourself, "A good power would be one where you have to hit survivors that you can't see."?  Or did you get so far in the post, you were like *fuck it, that's a lot of writing to be scrapped.*
---
If the wait times on your platform are fast then no issue. But if you’re making people wait 20+ minutes for a game that’s shite. 
---
An offering to screw your own team and the killer? Now that’s toxic
---
Isn’t that unrelated? 
---
With quick and quiet dont you have to be running? If not, then probably once. Until it came back around
---
*space, the final frontier...*
---
That's what this game has been missing: the typical hated water level 
---
I’ve mained killer since this game came out - I’m god awful survivor. Like god awful. I picked it up against recently and am like 20 games into survivor and Meyers actually ducking jumpscares me so much It’s made me love playing survivor... now minus my toxic teammates and this would be great!
---
Connection problems is a okay. Dodging lobbies because you don’t like a play style = you’re a scrub 
---
if a survivor plays a chase perfectly, they still go down and die to mori. if the killer plays game perfectly, the crouching on hatch doesnt happen. 
---
So you suggest to turn the newest killer into a worse version of  the previous one? This is basically the Spirit, but the survivors can see you.
---
Well apparently half the people here can't read a title. So much hate against op trying to warn the others about noed. Wtf is wrong with you all?
---
Don't forget that the moment you point out it was a joke you'll be slammed with blue down arrows anyway because people think you're backpedalling.
---
Christ I really thought I made it obvious enough. 
---
That's just reposting with extra steps
---
I thought...😭
---
Or just don’t be trash and slug people?
---
I'm not even the guy in the video...

---
I personally only dodge connections. But for example, if I know that the survivor called "xxbuttslapperxx" (random name don't get offended if that is your name) is just sandbagging or bringing the killer to us then yes dodging is understandable 
---
I laughed so hard I woke my wife up!!!
---
seeing the tears of swf when I get at least 2k is one of the best feelings tbh
---
Console or PC?
---
I don't see him do that. On the contrary I see him often say "oh nice" to something the opponent did. As in accepting that he was outplayed.   
---
also, you say he missed a claudette, what's your point ? so what if he missed a claudette ?   
---
I don't care if he is as you say or if he is not. I don't care if he makes mistakes. But I don't see him complaining.
---
Survivors are a weird breed...
---
Im sorry lul
---
I agree. Gen rushing is annoying to me as a killer, but probably in the same way that getting hooked is annoying to a survivor. It's sort of the point of the game, my job to try to break em up and make em scream. 
---
nice job brother 
---
Say that to the people that DC as soon as I blink on them. I don't approve of disconnects because the disconnectors will always have a different excuse. If it isn't Legion, it's Nurse. If not nurse, Doctor. Or Mori. Or pre nerf Freddy. Or they don't like the level. Or they want to make a sandwich.
---
I get that Legion lacks legit counterplay, but anyone who disconnects is just as shitty as Smooth Criminal Legion. 
---
idk about you guys but i just get the game constantly and i hate my life
---
you're right, after testing it, having the syringe first left me with a little bit of medkit left, no great skillchecks. and the having it second deplteted the medkit entirely
---
If 2 people dc, I’ll let you farm. Yeah, even in my cruel Legion build
---
It's nice to see something that isn't mindless Legion hate. This is creative. I like it.
---
CONSOLE PLAYER LMAOOO

I escaped  :)
---
As a fan of the original film, this is a great modelling
---
oh yeah, sometimes there’s this one guy when i’m playing killer who’s laggy enough to look like he’s playing nurse so you can’t even hit him

it’s 100% an issue on both sides

Dead hard is great but lately it has been feeling really shit I run it like 99% of the time. Lately it's been vacuuming me into walls and the killer. Also seems like the killer dead hards with me lately he swings I DH then he jumps with me activating early and late still do nothing :/
---
Oh, that's good!
---
Oh wow are your feelings hurt from a little tbagging?  grow a pair 
---

legion 
---
You know what's not cool? Letting a video game character trigger you cause of some tbagging, get off your high horse and live a little 
---
Yeah
---
It is literally completely random until someone puts an offering in.
---
Hey man, what song do you use at 4:34?
---
You sound like someone who DC cause the killer hit you through a window, fuck outta here 
---
As a Killer Main, I think the best thing I can suggest is to learn to play smart.
---
Too often I see survivors doing ridiculous things like sprinting through the middle of the map, or stopping to teabag or pick up dropped item mid-chase. If you think through on the fly and don’t try to get fancy just for the sake of making a cool looking play, you’re far more likely to succeed.
---
2 other things I could suggest would be getting other survivors to level 40 so you can get the stronger perks like Dead Hard, Self Heal, and Balanced Landing into everyone’s webs. They’re not 100% required perks, but for newer player, I would recommend them. 
---
Also, try out playing as different killers or watching some higher rank killer footage so you can understand their tactics and find ways to outplay them. You wouldn’t play the same way against Legion or Wraith as you would Hag or Billy.
---
I know it’s been said before in this thread, but good luck, and welcome to The Fog.

ahh a man of culture i see

I feel like this is a joke you guys.

You mean noed right? Because I know there are thousands of talentless killers with noed as an insurance policy  
---
nice
---
On my first night, second match I played against a cheating Myers who was running around the  map and got to evil within 3 in 5 seconds as soon as the match started. This happened 2 days ago. 
---
Hope you reported him and got his steamID - because without his steamID they don't do anything.  Also completely preventable if you just left.. Could have also gotten closer to the line so he couldnt knock you back into the map
---
Blame people for playing the game?
---
New killer confirmed 
---
most of the google results are from 2017. and half the time people spread false info, so yea
---
They need to do something about quitting: PC survivors are the worst of all platforms. I’ve got over 15oo hours on Xbox One X alone have had more people disconnect on PC over the past 3 days then the entire time I’ve played on consoles. 
---
Imagine thinking that repairing together is better than spreading out, oink.
---
After the shrine, I see Ruin way more. But noed is also meta ffs.
---
That was weird. Like, there were screenshots of the Twitter comment explicitly saying an optimisation patch would arrive in Dec, then they try making out we just misread it or something.

Oh. I'm considering the perks as real abilities they use . Nea is probably used to being stealthy, so Urban Evasion is probably something she actually is good at, likewise with Meg, as she can boost herself forward. 
---
But I'm right about David, right?
---
I've been getting the same few maps as the killer every time I play. I got the autohaven 4 times in a row once.
---
Chaotic good

---
Reasons I don't run Deliverance.
---
I regret nothing!! I found a new fav subreddit 
---
Ace is Italian-Argentinian so I think he counts as a Spanish survivor. Can’t say the same for any killers though.
---
The 'separate the school' perk would work in the survivors' favour though; it's much more advantageous for survivors to be spread out on different gens.
---
It is op. Sometimes the totem spawns are pretty bad and it makes it viable to try to do all of them but they keep hiding them more and more. Some of them are impossible to find. The whole purpose of noed being a hex perk is because it's op and it needs a down side. Nowadays the isn't one. I've used it a couple of games and got kills handed to me despite playing like absolute shit. If you get completely out-skilled and still get kills just because of noed I would say YES, IT IS VERY OP.  
---
So you never play survivor I take it.
---
I think he's meant to count as the Itallian Survivor. He's certainly more Caucasian than Hispanic. :p
---
A lot of the stuff people post on here is straight junk, but this is actually really nice. 
---
Wait the entity is a girl
---
That's very unfortunate.
---
Remember everyone! If a killer is toxic it will always be the fault of the survivors.

They should not address dc as long as the following are not adressed to some extend first:
---
* 3 man or lower games
---
*An absurd amount of hackers, they seem to come in waves every other week or so. This cannot be fixed completely but sometimes it just sucks to play at all
---
*Random glitches that fuck you up, including getting stuck in the locker and having control taken away from you
---
*Killers trapping you in an area waiting for you to dc
---
Idk why they're complaining about NOED. I would just be upset about Iri heads, but that's the way she goes sometimes. As a Huntress main, I understand then fun that Iri heads bring to the game for killer. 
---
One Bill &gt; Four Davids.
---
Non-obsession DS possibly
---
Lol I thought at first too because his face portrait in the game gives a Hispanic vibe. He's still my main dude tho 
---
Wanna know what's also funny this guy tried to save someone in the basement knowing that i was around and that i had an Iri head. And my main instinct as a huntress main is to hatchet first if i'm defending at the basement.
---
I just get Autohaven variations and Swamp. Rarely get McMillan or Crotus Penn.
---
Killer players are something else 
---
Wow. Dedicated servers when?
---
I use a super smash bros melee opening remix which is actually linked in the description of the video :)
---
Honestly new to the whole thing myself but the one printer i have is an ANYCUBIC i3 Mega 3D Printer. It's small but it does the job though you can shop around for cheaper options. As for software Cura is the one I use and it's a good job and free to download. Cura is how you change your file to gcode file which is what the printer needs. The best site to get files off is thingiverse or myminifactory. That's all I can reccomened. Hope it helps :D
---
This is what happens to me and then since I’m at rank 15 because of this problem, the killers like to camp and then I see my teammates running across the map, one crouching behind a rock doing nothing while one is being chased.
---
The Chad Dwight.
---
You kinda have to be up their ass before you start revving your Chainsaw.
---
From there, it's about following them by making wide enough conners, but sharp ones.
---
They'll try to juke you, just keep following them. It's okay it you dont get them the first time, just make sure you're avoiding collisions so you don't tantrum.
---
Awww... 
---
I popped the offering that spawns me as far away from the killer as possible and *still* ended up being first found and caught
---
How do you know? Or are you just messing with me
---
My dumbass read this as LAHNEEWOL at first
---
I love salty posts that are about people getting salty and how they should stop.
---
Well the solution is simple. We get bhvr to ban all the meat eaters if they don't turn vegan.
---
uhh... happy cake day?
---
I believe it's a glitch caused by a Boil Over user that also successfully uses Decisive Strike. Although the symbol stays on my screen, I do not suffer it's effects.
---
I think map rotation is pretty random but I’ve noticed I’ll sometimes get the same map 2x in a row before I get a new map. 
---
As a side note I do believe the devs mentioned being able to set preference for certain maps at certain times in one of the more recent patch notes. They then used it to make ormond a more frequent map during the first week or so after legions release. So maybe they set preference for certain maps at specific times? 
---
Other than that I don’t know.
---
I was hoping the killer would have some kindness in his/her heart to let me free considering I just got off the hook. I wasnt trying to be toxic, I did it to SURVIVE.
---
why the nod exactly? :/
---
Gg though 
---
Killer literally cheating by lagswitching? I schleep
---
Survivor crouches repeatedly? TOXIC FUGGIN POS
---
what if i use an endgame build, even tho i play a semi decent anti looper killer like the pig? i stay rank 1, and i run NOED, Blood Warden, Remember me and Sloppy Butcher. NOED dies on me after one or 2 downs, but it does its snowball job. Does that make me bad?
---
Lol I still can't joke for crap.
---
Probably won't surprise everybody that I only have 300 hours of game time for dbd😂
---
Stop hiding behind “its just my opinion”. No one gives a shit if its your opinion, no fucking shit its your opinion. It doesnt mean it isnt free from criticism 
---
there are 2 perks and an item to help find those totems, though. if u really struggle with NOED bcoz of the totems u can run them
---
Bro clearly you’re a killer main and I’m on sticks so it’s obviously gonna be slower I have my sensitivity maxed and that’s as fast as one can 360 on console so please stop your crying :)
---
Lol
---
"Yeah I'm coming for YOUR booty" is what I was intending 
---
Its not about the screen, for each person playing the console needs create a version of the game and run it right along with the others, they dont just all pop into one map, ALL the input and ALL the output needs to be registered for each screen.
---
Its demanding and usually to make split screen games they need to take a lot of assets out of gameplay to make it work so theres less to process. (sorry i realise they may have not meant split screen but LAN)

Can't hide if you're leaking neon signs.
---
Honesty you should learn how to 360 whenever you can cause we have big ass hit boxes and it can be your last resort in terms of surviving but killer mains get pissed when ever that shit happens and they call it toxic at least from my experience with killers I’ve played against.
---
I don’t think they are gonna ban anyone who camps. Camping is easily countered by gen rushing. One person might die but most will escape as long as team mates are brain dead it’s not that big a deal.
---
Playing against the Legion &amp; DC ❤️ 
---
That'll never happen the devs are pro-camping. They defend it when its brought up and even listed it as something you should never report.
---
That’s facts like I’m not giving the killer free blood points nor am I going to make his time playing killer against me easy.
---
They just need to put soft bans on people who DC in general. Like a timer before you can queue again. I mean people DC for dumb reasons. For example getting their purple flashlight knocked out of their hands by franklin's, Being hooked early, or any other thing that makes justifies to them why they should screw over their team.
---
Right now there is enough people on this bandwagon to say "OMG Legion DC" and people to agree with it.
---
I mean maybe they should just have an 100% movespeed M1 killer with an M2 thats just an alternate swing thats basically an M1. I mean as a survivor I want to style on the killer so I can feel like I'm special. Especially endgame chat brag to my friends and GG ez the killer.
---
There are some people who actually believe hiding as a survivor is a shit thing to do. Has anyone ever thought that the killer is supposed to be able to kill. You are not the hero of the story. You are Tree #2 when the game ends you are not in the credits. You are not getting a reward.
---
The Legion.
---
Its oh so fun seeing the -rep on my profile after I burn a Jigsaw piece and use Frank's mixtape.
---
I'm a killer main, and I love it when in endgame chat someone types GG EZ and other survs start defending me, saying it wasn't easy. Always makes my heart melt. 
---
Top 10 unsolved mysteries 
---
Yeah don’t understand how people still think camping will ever be a bannable offense. I just feel sorry for how dumb people are that make these posts and flair them salt/rant. 
---
How'd you get this picture of me?
---
On steam you have to add friends before you can send a message and even if you send them  a message they'd have to open up their steam menu twice which obscures the game. If you're already down 1-2 players, this isn't the best time to be looking away even if you think it'll gain you a slight advantage. You're already playing cautiously at this point.
---
noed &amp; bbq?
---
That's fair and another redditor suggested something better. Just give post game results for the last few games and make it accessible even if you leave the lobby.
---
I kinda wish it was at the Thompson house but this is pretty dang good. 
---
I use a pc... Which also brings up, is it easier to juke on console than pc?
---
Love the aesthetic.
---
The power is unique and cool, but it would be buggy. Something that pulls the survivor towards the killer has the potential to do all kinds of shenanigans, especially when you take into consideration things like shooting over small obstacles or from/to different elevations.
---
I would like to see him have a power that counters looping. Maybe everywhere he walks he leaves a trail of water that slows down survivors who walk through it, but speeds him up.
---
Also, missed opportunity to call him the ocean man.
---
This sounds like fun
---
I'd like to challenge survivors to wiggle contests

Yeah I feel that 
---
Agreed.
---
Ok 
---
Damn, nicely done ideas and all! Usually I hate these sorts of posts since there rarely appears to be too much thought put into them but every idea you have here I love. The interaction between killer and survivor for the wiggle-off sounds very cool, but it would be tricky to balance so that the interaction is in the killer's favor but not lopsidedly so. The riptide perk also sounds like it could have borderline if not outright OP synergy w other builds (think Doc/unsuppressed Wraith).
---
Beyond those two very minor thoughts, love it. Rarely post but just had to for this.
---
How are those 2 similar? 
---
She's *Preeeety*.
---
Nothing wrong with staying to make sure others get out, maybe a body block if someone is injured. Shit I'm a killer main but I like to make sure everyone who is still alive gets out when I play survivor. The amount of kills I've lost out on because one guy stayed behind and got a sneaky unhook and a body block is unreal.
---
What do you expect? It's one of the best killer perks in the game atm. 
---
&gt;Reply
---
TF2 taunting is understood and respectable. Anyone can taunt at any time, and there's no one party deprived of the ability to. 
---
T-bagging in DBD is the scummiest thing imaginable, and every survivor who does it deserves to be anally demolished by the Hag wearing a venomous strap-on. 
---
^(Just kidding.) 
---
In all seriousness, it's just annoying and tired. And Killers don't have any taunts of their own (with the exception of Pig's ability to t-bag), so they can't dish it back to survs after a hook. Unless you count whacking a hooked surv, but honestly that's not as insulting. 
---
Can't we all agree that instead of punishing campers we should be rewarding camped Survivors?
---
That way people are incentivized to struggle and take as long as possible to die on the hook instead of DC'ing; which in turn makes things better for the other Survivors in the game and makes it less likely Killers will camp (since most do it solely to get a rise out of the people playing Survivor).
---
what part of this screenshot did they fake lol
---
Go into Kill Your Friends and in the match settings you can see the maps list. Considering there are 3 realms with 5 maps each it makes sense to get these more often. But then again it does always feels like you are in the same one, I doubt it's actually random. I'd like to know this
---
Eustace's chin cannot be contained. 
---
im new to the game... but if you hide in a locker too long, doesnt the game start to signal where the survivor is?
---
Clown is my main boy because of his ability to control the pace of a game 
---
These perks actually seem pretty balanced good job op
---
Oh yeah, I’ve learned to be more flexible but when I first started I was always go to the gen furthest away from me because you know they aren’t going to spawn anyone within five seconds of you. 
---
My computer is the exact opposite, it has an aneurism on witcher on ultra but payday is a amazing 100fps
---
Then that's on the other survivors for being stupid and making that strategy strong, not the actual strategy itself. Not saying camping is ok, but it's not bannable. 
---
God 
---
I don't understand can you please explain?
---
What’s worse the community being triggered by vide game or you being triggered by the community of a video game?
---
Earlier today, I had a Nea loop the killer around me. While i was on hook. They ran away seconds before i died.

Hey, MW here! I tried to draw a serious Dead by Daylight comic about The Doctor. I don't know why, but The Entity is an old man in a suit in my head. Hmmmm I'm not sure I can make more of this comic. It's kinda hard to draw a serious comic...but I'll try. Well, Thank you for seeing my art! Hopefully you would like it. Also if you are interested in Art commission, please visit my art page and send me a mail. [https://www.patreon.com/posts/23120428](https://www.patreon.com/posts/23120428) Thanks again! Have a wonderful Sunday, guys.

What If they put Laurie's outfit from the 2007 remake?
---
You can’t get banned for camping. When I get camped I swing my arms letting everyone know and most of the time they finish the gens so killer still loses. It’s shitty to camp but it doesn’t bother me. I think it’s what makes the game fun not knowing how the killer wants the game to go. Many times I run the killer all game and when he finally catches me with noad and camps I accept it. 
---
stop upvoting this shit jesus christ

Someone doesn't know how to deal with ds...

Played a typical piggy game and got a 4k only to be messaged by a nea who dced before her third hook. She called me a cheater and a douchebag. I was quite confused, and asked how I cheated. She then said, “camping, tunneling, baiting, leaving survivors on the ground.” Now, we all know that none of those things are cheating, but the only one I did was slugging. I told her that those aren’t cheating, and she said yes they are. I then sent a screenshot of the official forum page of the things you shouldn’t report in our messages, and she was completely silent.
---
What’s the original? Can you link it?
---
If the hatch was directly above the basement shouldn’t you open the lockers from front to back so he doesn’t get free time to run upstairs?
---
Yesterday I played several matches and some went like this:
---
Freddy game, instantly in his lullaby radius, chased, hooked, unhooked and he was on my ass immediately. Then I get chased and hooked again while another survivor is in a chase, I get unhooked and the Freddy just stops and dedicates to find me, which he does and I die. Hello 1 BP, goodbye mental health.
---
Next game I tell myself that I'm not hopping on a gen in the first seconds, because that's apparently what gets you found first. Still, after 4 seconds I get chainsawed by Billy and I wanted to die, because going down in the first seconds is really awkward and stupid.
---
I fucking suck and I have no idea how to improve, but by the time I will, hopefully, improve, my sanity will be completely gone. 
---
If I hook someone and at least 2 survivors are circling me as I carry them to the hook I know they’re not going to be far away so why should I get shit on for camping?
---
Think so, but they just jump between lockers when you're not nearby 
---
Spirit with less wah
---
I agree soft bans on the dc then permban after 3 strikes. I really wish they had a bad behavior lobby so all the chronic dc players can play together and see how fun it is to 3v1 with 5 gens. Especially when I bring an escape cake and great items. The classic ones are the obsession players who miss their d strike. They dc right away like little babies. 
---
[Well...](https://i.imgur.com/PMg9VVJ.png)
---
Well thanks, the comments on this posts turned out interesting.
---
Maybe, hopefully.
---
It's a big ban though if the person is reported.
---
So what?!?!? Too bad shit happens!!! Play the game and pay fukin attention spirit cant phase walk for ever, most of the time you can see her body, or when she is in a chase you can do gens without worrying. I had games where 2 and even 3 people escape against praying beads spirit and im playing solo, guess what a strong killer makes the game interesting but you probably dont care and only want brain afk gens to get easy wins. Please uninstall the game and make everyone a favor so we wont be matched with someone who insta leaves if the killer is a good player. Im gonna say it again GIT FUKIN GUD
---
You never know, lol. I've seen people complain about a bug where their used up/Franklin'd item wasn't saved by their ward.
---
Not today satan... Not today.
---
Is this original cause that looks nothing like the actual outfit she got lol, she looks like an actual woman here
---
Is it just me, or are these also the type of people who will tell you
---
"It's your connection. I run download and upload speed of 900 mb/s."
---
Wraith because he’s known to be a friendly killer. I always let the last one get the hatch as long as I get all my bbq stacks. Once I get my nurse to p3 I think I’ll practice and be a nurse main since I’m sick of the damn pallets lol. 
---
The thing is that there is no actual counter play, and not getting found is not one because when he frenzy hits someone else he gets a mini bbq, and what about moonwalking and franks, you literally can’t win chases against a good legion, how is that fun to play against.
---
It took me four games to get the "accumulate sabotage equal to 2 full hooks" daily... Found in the first 7 seconds three games in a row, nowhere near gens, just trying to walk over to a hook
---
Very insightful.
---
my basic chat is usually like this:
---
Damn these are getting overused already, this is the third shits Ive seen on the first page lmao
---
Why do you think wired internet can only connect to one thing at a time?
---
Run breakdown, so when your team farms you he at least has to walk to a new hook lol
---
Doesn't the entity take the form of a spider half the time? But props to you it's a good read so far
---
I pulled a survivor off a generator once while using that, i think he flew off his chair because he didn't struggle at all, haha.
---
x : struggle
---
Well when I’m killer wait time is like 20sec or less to find a match haha but if I see SWF 4Claudette I back out haha
---
Find a pallet with a decent length of shit attached, and run them around it until you can't do another lap without getting clapped. Then pause at the pallet, and if they stop to respect it, run another lap on them, if not, drop it on them. Then run to another one and keep doing that. Once you get better at it, start heading for the T-walls with windows to vault and drag them around those, making sure to look for another nearby pallet while you run laps
---
I don’t get it. I read so many complaints about lag and the game. But I only rarely have problems. Overall I have a good experience and have no complaints.
---
Wanted to riff on WW2 prop. posters.
---
Maybe uninstall the game if you can’t learn to adapt to different killers and perks. It’s not all about doing gens and escaping it’s all about trying to mind game the killer. When I play against silent spirit I jump on different gens especially when one is completed bc of rancor and other tracking perks. Also when someone gets hooked and you’re still sitting on your gen in same position you’re just asking to get grabbed. 
---
To counter I just keep working on gen for 4 seconds then walk away. 9/10 spirit will come and waste time looking for you. Also when she’s chasing you with phase run and then start walking left or right so she doesn’t bump into you. Also the next time she’s chasing you with phase run forward then run back retracing your steps so it looks like u again stopped running and walked. 
---
Would be really cool to maybe see the Doctor try to attack him in a fit of rage, and actually kill him, only to discover that it was completely meaningless, as the Entity manifested around him in the spider-like form we see in the game. Remember, the killers are the Entity's victims too!
---
Overall love your comics' aesthetic quality, keep em coming!
---
I don't care if I don't kill a single survivor in a game, I don't even care if I don't get a hook; I don't get triggered by the game. However, if your objective is to make the game not fun for other players I'm going to make it not fun for you. Did you really never hear "treat people how you want to be treated"? I don't even get mad, I just DC and move on, after all "it's not like I CANT get into another lobby"
---
nope
---
Urban evasion, dance with me, lithe, quick&amp;quiet
---
Yeah well I'll just leave instead of play against an unfun build 
---
Get past 12?  I purposely derank.  How can you not get past 12?
---
I did, but only because the person deserved it. They sandbagged and wouldn't help anyone, just crouch walked around the whole game. I messaged the killer on the location of them, and was satisfied when they got hooked right near the hatch.
---
wow you're so alpha bru
---
I've only had random luck.  You can hear them sometimes i think, and if they stay long enough crows will start circling. If you have someone that bounces, iron maiden can help a bit, but it feels shitty to require a perk for trolling players. 
---
Hey man it's ok! Keep playing and you'll keep improving I promise! I've been playing since the Saw chapter came out and I still can't seem to get any higher than level 11 and still feel like I'm not that good but I just keep practicing lol! Watching streams help too so you can see how to loop and ways to get better 
---
It's just a person. Lol
---
That would be [The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (nsfw)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I31nPdxjM7g)
---
If you decide to watch the whole thing, 2 notes:
---
1. Watch the original 1974 version.
---
2. They say the story is based on true events, this is somewhat misleading as the only real connection to anything in the story is from Ed Gein, a serial killer and body snatcher who would decorate his house and make clothes with the tanned leather from dead bodies, some of which can be seen [here (NSFL: VERY graphic)](https://onedio.co/content/24-utterly-disturbing-items-made-out-of-human-flesh-by-a-serial-killer-15616)
---
I liked it. I kind of like the idea of the Entity being a man. As I've got it in my head that the Entity can take any form it chooses, so why wouldn't it choose to take a form it could talk to the killers with.
---
It was also kind of strange to see the Doc not wearing his headgear. It maybe short but it is really good
---
Even if  ghostface is just a person so is legion, trapper and the huntress.
---
There's people cheating with well over a thousand hours in this game. I've reported many, they don't even hide their profiles or cheating (be it cosmetics, speed hacks, whatever) but since EAC is awesome these guys can continue until they get in a game with someone who's recording &amp; reports them.
---
**YEET** her.
---
Such cancer.
---
After some time trapped in The Fog, Benedict Baker realized there was a special place for him in this ever changing Hell: The Throne.
---
Looks mad good for something that happened randomly.

I haven't intentionally but one time I spawned in with a Kate and the killer (Pig) in the barn. We all run out and I crouch behind some hay bales with a palette. I can see Amanda's head ever so slightly over the bale and get ready to slam the palette as I can see her red stain (she's searching from my POV, so I assume she's looking for me)... only... it wasn't Amanda, it was a Kate and ol Piggy was RIGHT BEHIND HER. 
---
I obviously didn't see the Kate turn around the hay but I slammed the palette trapping the Kate behind the palette and between the Pig. Kate got knocked, and the three of us kinda just... looked at each other for what seemed a really long time.  The Kate DC'd as I was trying to unhook them and Amanda was near by, which eventually lead to me being hooked so I guess I got what I deserved 
---
Honestly still queue dodge that Kate if I see them in the lobby, out of sheer embarrassment &gt;.&gt;
---
It's BBQ and Ruin in almost every game, with chase oriented killers it will be enduring and spirit fury, maybe bamboozle. 
---
Spirit main here is offended
---
Smells like sorcery. Also can they make firecrackers items you can find normally and give them some addons.
---
I think people are talking about the fact that it's just stressful the whole time and not fun to be destroyed by a good swf 
---
LOVELY!!
---
More upvotes than any of your posts
---
I love the idea of the killers coming back home after a match and just talking to eachother lol
---
And as always phenomenal art! Look forward to the entity’s speech or whatever it’ll be 
---
A camping post but yet insidious is exactly a camping perk.  Hmmmm
---
Lead the killer to a Nea that was camping the hatch while i was trying to find a gen to work on.
---
And clown, cannibal, hillbilly, pig
---
Aww, I would've not ran if I had known. You shanked me tho.
---
Going with this theory the survivor could be a queen/princess or king/prince
---
Dude, same. I still manage to enjoy it, but yeah, I can get looped like a dog. I just don't bother anymore. It's a waste of time. I'll find someone else and hit them.
---
teabagging and slashing people on the hooks is honestly just a dick thing to do so when they go down people view it as karma 
---
By sucking as badly as I do.
---
Have you tried playing a more simple game that doesn't require you to adapt your playstyle?  Maybe something like creative mode minecraft where you can just do what you want with no consequence?
---
Thank you! Probably even the killers need a rest after a match. Specially after met EVIL and TOXIC survivors. 
---
Keep in mind they could mean oldest killer in terms of when they got into the realm and with time being, as they have said themselves, convoluted it could seriously just be a killer from the future or something. Really digging the lore killer idea though. Also medieval looking killer would not fit too well into the game aesthetically.
---
Remember when they were actually worthwhile, Pepperidge Farm remembers.
