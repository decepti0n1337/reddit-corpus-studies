Entitlement is strong in this community, no ones able to play how they want :,)
---
---
---
Empathy is a total waste. If you have to go across the map to try and heal someone that probably has self care you're wasting the whole game away. Aftercare is decent. Bond is S tier
---
No, stop! They'll remove it for inner strength if you keep bringing it up!
---
Same, went from 2-3 Min on survivor to like 9-10 on killer on ps4, not a problem except it meant i only got one game in before having to go to do school work
---
It's easy to spot the single role players
---
Man I love trapper. Got coal tower with my darkened traps. Managed a 4 kill with 1 gen done. Had 6 traps total. 101k points with BBQ. Just a great map. Everything lined up. 
---

---
Yes, at red ranks.
---
I have no clue, that might just be where it ends.
---
r/vidsthatendtoosoon
---
Yes she does. I run iron will and escape her all the time. It's her use of hearing when invis. I heard it all before. I don't want to use a perk to counter 1 killer. IW helps in every game especially against a invis Spirt. I do not fear Spirts at all. I run IW. SC. Empty and WAGLF. I escape 80% of games in solo. I die way more from survivors DCing and screwing over team them I do any just 1 killer.
---
Doctor main, had an ash and meg DC in 5 mins
---
I was okay with the nurses basekit, I just wanted to see more than 2 blinks and range addons to be nerfed. But she is still in top 3 I would even say she is on the second place after spirit.
---
The perk dark sense doesn't require you to be the one to repair it to trigger. Maybe it just means repair 4 gens as a team?
---
They lose all items and bloodpoints
---
That would be nice
---
If you genuinely think he's been on a two day witchhunting rant because he isn't mad then just what the fuck is the point of even talking to me.
---
I'm calling it now. PLZ NERF BILLY. Next after they do finally give in to Spirt complaints.
---
I've done it a handful of times in all my hours in this game
---
I actually appreciate the end game collapse since i’ve dealt with way too many games that lasted over half an hour with one survivor left who’s nowhere in sight.
---
Killer is host.
---
sHe HaS lOtS oF cOuNtErPlAy
---
Meanwhile she doesn't give the survivor any concrete info in chase.
---
Ya'll are over here discussing better bandaid fixes (all related to getting more bp upon having someone else DC) and I'm sitting here wanting an actual solution to the DC epidemic this game has. 
---
You could give me a mil bp per dc match and I wouldn't care, I want people to stop being little DC bitches, period.
---
Nice try, VitalAura.
---
And stridor counters Iron Will, which many spirits use because hearing is essential.
---
What do you mean? I know a brand new part used to fix a complete generator back in the days and that wasnt good for the game and thats why a nerf was needed. We can talk about if the nerf to only 25% was to drastic I would have liked to see something around 50%.
---
But what has your comment to do with mine? I dont get it. :D
---
I've seen enough SFM to confirm this is true.
---
Everyone else knew what I meant, it‘s not my problem you had to get your panties in a twist over a simple comment like this
---
i was camping a hook at end game, for the archives, with devour hope active. someone came for the save, so I mori'd them as a warning. someone else came for the save. and thats how a 1k became a 3k
---
I've recently started using an aura reading build with aftercare, spine chill, alert and inner strength (for the healing), it gives me so much info and so far the only thing that can stop my build is if the killer has some sort of blindness addon or hex the third seal
---
Stop trying to make it look like survivors can easily avoid getting mori’d, because they can’t. Having to hook a survivor once to be able to remove him completely from the game is BS and is a free win for the killer unless they really suck. « just loop » doesn’t work if the killer tunnels or camps.
---
Idk I don’t get anyone that talks trash in post game chat. Even when I’m first down and I get face camped and tunneled. I shrug, gg, move onto next game.
---
The reason that trash got nerfed is because they shouldn't have been in the game to fucking begin with. They are all low skilled garbage that made playing survivor too damn easy. Same with the stupid infinities, a few of which are still in the game.
---
I wouldnt consider bodyblocking to protect your teammate as toxic...
---
You can get the blind by aiming for the face, but it isn't consistent. The best way to tell if it is working or not is if the beam tightens. If it starts to become smaller, it is starting to blind the killer and you are in the sweet spot.
---
Difference between actually trying and being good at the game and thinking kills alone mean you won. If you don't know how to play the game and have to play like that to get kills then go right ahead. Just means you're probably terrible at the game and compensating for lack of skill.
---
We dont wanna run it either but id rather not have 3 gens pop before i can even walk across the map
---
I am CompassionReigns on Twitch. My name is Ian. Don't be so cynical.
---
Why not make a sticky post for all of them, as well as all the dumb memes?
---
Lmfao what. As i just went through six games today without even going down.
---
well you just said it right there, playing 4-5 games is a lot of time, when you can realistically get the totem challenge done in 2 games, and the chest challenges done in 1 game each if you bring coins. The problem comes from other survivors cleansing/opening things if you're too slow. To me personally it is not worth wasting almost 2 hours of matches (when you add in the wait time between each) to complete 1 of these challenges.
---
Running builds centered around it is a lot more efficient and sure fire way, hell it even helped in destroying several killers NOEDs and escaping matches with found keys simply because I made builds around them.
---
Not better, Clown blocks off entire paths at once.. But Freddy has a teleport which anyond would take anyday.
---
you're*
---
feng's scream has been known to shatter concrete
---
I mean an adult can live with their parents and if thats their only home/they dont have a stable job, theyd be forced to move with them if they moved. Not saying youre wrong but something to consider if thats your evidence
---
Here is my *personal opinion* on how they should change moris
---
Cypress mori- is fine how it is
---
Ivory- a survivor needs to be chased for 1 minute + hook
---
Ebony-  each survivor needs to be hooked once, and each chased for 1 and a half minutes before they can be morid
---
only 117,000??? Jesus that sucks man
---
that’s his name couldn’t remember but ya he was my favorite too
---
Unfortunately survivor main mentality is if they can’t prolong a chase the killer is OP and spirit will get nerfed because of all the crying, you think the crying is bad on Reddit?
---
Official forums every day 2-4 posts about spirit complaints whether it’s her power or PB addon
---
your game is glitched, delete the game and redownload it
---
But you don't get Archive challenge completion. I'm trying to do the 'Kill all survivors in a match' challenge. I killed 3 and the fourth disconnected and that doesn't count. Thanks BHVR.
---
True. But some do. And anything that can get me a salt message is good
---
i agree lol
---
I just tried to do 4k challenge with my only red mori. And those two truckers hopped in the hatch right in front of me.
---
oof it very well could make it to the billion mark then, well maby
---
They do need to be changed.
---
Quit aiming for the boobs. Eyes up here
---
I would be absolutely terrified if I saw a hook sliding around the map and just taking survivors
---
What do you mean with should let you run?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You know when someone is healing you, you can cancel that with pressing the sprint key?
---
Don't care
---
I agree. Some people have legitimate reasons for disconnecting, but they probably don't care since they disconnect so infrequently. Only in emergencies. The chronic DCers, it'll hurt them. Also give them a time out, so they lose BP and can't play for a while. Fuck DCers.
---
In a public match, the Killer is always host as the game is Peer to Peer.
---
In Custom games, whoever makes the lobby is the host.
---
On PC and Switch atm, they are using dedicated servers instead of the killer being the host.
---
They have to be harsh so that it deters people from DCing.
---
Having the first DC punishment on the low side is okay, shit happens sometimes, but if you DC a lot during a small time period you probably shouldn't be playing an online multiplayer game.
---
Wasn’t one of the killer challenges “*Sacrifice three survivors during the endgame collapse while using NOED*”? Like seriously?! So now my progress in the Archives will depend on me SUCKING during the match and getting gen-rushed and then HOPEFULLY be able to sacrifice the team during the end game? 
---
Also a survivor one: “*Save three survivors from the hook during the end game collapse*”. What if the killers I play against aren’t that skillful and can’t hook three of us, or what if two are already dead by time the collapse starts? Why does my progression in the Archives have to depend on the skill (or lack thereof) of the other team? They need to edit some of these challenges.
---
Agreed.
---
If you didn’t care, why’d you spend your time reading and replying to this post? Seems counterproductive to your reasoning,doesn’t it?
---
It was a joke because he said the same thing about Spine Chill in his recent video about Spirit. The truth is that Spine Chill helps against a lot of killers, not just 1/17.
---
Getting sick of these shitty pointless posts. Mods are asleep 24/7
---
He can also see surrvivors through walls
---
The guy just sounds salty. I rarely bring keys cause when I do I find I either don’t need them or die before I can. Key=congrats if you actually end up using it.
---
In my experience as a killer, you can't blind them while they're doing pallets because they look down in the animation. I could be wrong but i've never once been blinded whilst destroying a pallet
---
After billy will probably be freddy
---
Do you find him to be OP when you play as him?
---
Insta-Heals and Brand New Part were OP and they just buffed Med-Kits so...
---
&gt;Iron Will 3 Claudette
---
As killer, I wouldn’t even be convinced you’re on the map anymore

Definitely the Prayer Beads, though I do think it's a necessary evil. Basically I'm on the boat of making it an Ultra Rare, and then making the faster speed add-on a little less fast and a Very Rare. Maybe also take scratch marks off Prayer Beads like with that visible blood add-on. Sorry, I only memorize the names of perks.
---
==&gt; TO BE CONTINUED
---
Just do it
---
I dont quite get why. Someone said they did so I gave it a shot. They didnt. But all it would do would be cure the deep Wounds effect. Not worth an iridescent add on, and would just be funny on a meme build.
---
Same thing can be said about mori’s. They can change keys if they change mori’s
---
F, I know the pain
---
Wait we have 70 days I've been pulling all nighters trying to get to lvl 70 before 10th Nov
---
Lemme guess... Spirit?
---
Ruin is there because the devs are too stupid, lazy, or uncreative enough to do secondary objectives for survivors.
---
They literally stopped as soon as I posted this smh
---
[deleted]
---
How did they buff medkits? All I've seen is the syringes and stypics basically sucking.
---
Both good and bad lmao
---
I was actually surprised by how quiet I was. I main Doctor so i don't have problems finding anyone, but before I had iron will I would try to do those bullshit claudette hide around a corner things and it would never work so I thought people were exaggerating how hard she is to spot. Then I used iron will and had killers walking right on past me last night...it was strange.
---
Advice?? Just block em or wait for them to tire themselves out. They’re wasting their time
---
Anyone who cries ruin is broken cant hit a great skill check git gud
---
That's pretty impressive, you're more than likely above average.
---
No I don't because she's stupidly hard to learn on console but from what I've seen from streamers who have been playing her after the patch she still seems really strong. There's always the recovery add ons to make it almost the same as no add on nurse before the nerf
---
That’s what I’m saying. I almost never bring keys, and find them in chests on occasion, so using them is seldom a possibility. Most of the time, the killer finds hatch before you do, and either camps it or closes it to start egc.
---
So, what pray tell, would you add in their place because I'm not seeing anything worth spending the points on?
---
I didn’t reply to you though did I?
---
when your custom character is in a cutscene:
---
Yeah
---
LE ANGERY SURVIVOR MAIN RUNNING META PERKS VS LE ME RUNNING NOT META PERKS (PLEASE VALIDATE ME)
---
They will have to focus on the killer stuff or there won't be enough survivors left playing to kill.
---
Same with Doctor's bat. Many weapons could use altered sound effects.
---
&gt;Second Wind automatically **heals you** from Injured  to the Healthy State
---
Straight from the description of Second Wind
---
That's not bad I just wonder how the killer would know it's been 1 minute
---
Great Office reference.
---
Which in my experience reduces each page to 5 submissions, if that.
---
Don't forget Max Jr. who was treated like trash by his parents, or Frank who was basically not wanted by his i.e. a foster kid. Then you have Feng who had the stereotypical "games are bad for you" parents.
---
Then of course Rin with the whole you know, getting murdered by her daddy.
---
Spine chill is super annoying when you are trying to be sneaky, but you don't see it as often as dead hard or adrenaline. I think it's been more common recently due to the release of two killers back to back that have stealth elements, and the fact that a stealth killer patch just hit.
---
Ohhh true I forgot about that
---
i was meaning in general, a red mori can do that 2
---
Never claimed it was a mandatory perk, just mentioning that it's a top tier perk that works against everyone. Please dont put words in my mouth.
---
_throws down the shack pallet for “distraction”_
---
i’ll fuckin do it again
---
Could have a thing around the survivors name like freddy and plague
---
I love this lmao
---
There's a difference between being op and being broken. We all witnessed this from prenerf Legion.
---
I usually say if im not the one getting chased we lose lmao. But i am by no means good, i can't loop tall walls for the life of me.
---
In rank 1 as killer ive run into like 2 survivors i genuinely could not outplay or catch. Those guys, with like 4000 hours are good.
---
Both of them were bloody quentins haha.
---
From who to who?
---
To be continued...
---
Still would be better than it is now, maybe to compensate, it could become a very rare instead of an ultra rare
---
Wow that's such a dumb system, no wonder there's so many issues
---
Damn, shame they don't have that on console
---
This is so true. I've only ever had a match against the clown maybe once or twice
---
Ik. But you shouldn't be required to run a perk
---
This is how spirits should play.
---
Then you'd still be wasting 6k to be worse.
---
I was so excited for the stranger things update all I thought was they were gonna add some characters and that’s it but they changed everything and that night I scheduled a time for me and my friends to play it but for some reason when we joined a game it only put two of us in so we ended up just playing kill your friends
---
Dildo
---
[removed]
---
holy fu
---
there are coin offerings to increase the number of chests to make the chest search missions less of a test of how much you can trust randoms but it's still basically a "i'm throwing the game to get this done" mission
---
the difference is the entity gives you the bloodpoints while giving you a gentle shoulder rub from the locker, whispering sweet nothings into your ear, ignoring any concerned or worried looks on your character’s face
---
That certainly wasn't obvious to me! Wow. Thanks for making this, I always assumed they were all pulled into the Fog around the same time, but you're right, the Legion was taken soon after they murdered the cleaner, and Jeff was taken probably a decade later when he returned to Ormond, after his father's unrelated death.
---
It’s about F U N. That’s why killers use moris in the first place, they go into the game knowing they’ll depip but it’s fun anyway
---
Sad I’ve gotten a bunch of killers who camp and thirsty for bps so I can’t even beat the first challenge
---
Check your tier rewards if you haven't yet. I hear that it can fix it.
---
All they need to do is remove the single trial stipulation. That would make it so much better for casual player.
---
Actually Megan I can’t sit anywhere, I have hemorrhagic syringes
---
Ruin slows the game down so little in red ranks. Assuming the survivors are competent they'll usually just power through it without issue. Not to mention, the totem is almost always found in less than 2 minutes. Ruin only slows the game down a meaningful amount in rare cases or in lower ranks. It's probably better to swap it for a different slowdown perk like PGTW or Sloppy Butcher.
---
Yeah you aren't wrong
---
And then afterwards, they message you something about how your trash
---
I purposely tbag when someone brings a mori like it’s what they deserve
---
That happened to me, I just thought it was a glitch lol. Eventually, I started making noise so I could be found and just have the game over with. I was stuck in the house and couldn't see to get out.
---
Everytime I used a coin offering I ended up getting one chest lol. People seem to forget that chests exist until and offering appears that reminds em
---
It is currently in developement, it is not entirely stable so it is only on PC cause its a better platform for PTBs. It is on Switch cause the switch can't handle hosting the game and playing a client at the same time.
---
my jaw unhinged as i screamed in excitement
---
I play on console. I use her recovery add ons but I find they don’t help quite as much as I’d hope. I’m still limited in my blinks in that I have to hesitate when traversing long distances, waiting for the second blink to recharge. It is only about a second’s hesitation, but this adds up when trying to cross big maps; it’s not uncommon for me to have to do four rounds of blinks to cross a map like Thompson’s House. This gives the survivors four, five, six, seven extra seconds to get gone before I arrive. I then have to try to find them all over again.
---
I laughed way too hard at this.  😂
---
Yeah, we have all 70 days to collect plus 2 weeks after to spend them.
---
My lower ranked friends don't wanna play with me anymore. Lol
---
Thank you . Your scream brings me joy
---
Hey, thanks for your reply. Geez... Do the devs think this is acceptable? It’s so ridiculous. People make memes about it but should be much more angrier...
---
You also get points for vaulting during a chase and dropping a pallet during a chase
---
Same! High five :)
---
It should be coming to console as well as far as I understand.
---
Note that dedicated servers could possibly make things worse in some situations, depending on each person's ping to the server. Instead of you sending a signal directly to the killer (and vice versa), you have to send the signal to the server, and then the server sends it to the killer.
---
Could you imagine a *CRACK* then a cheering crowd 😂
---
That’s why I never go to the gates after they’re powered. I just spam trap setting, puddle placing, phasing, etc. I will say I’m really grateful for the end game collapse and I can’t imagine what this game was like before it. Like, just get out of my game and let’s all move on haha
---
Only thing is it should be doubling the blught points as they said it would during Q&amp;A livestream.
---
Not going to give an argument to someone who thinks insta downs with Myers and Ghostface are unhealthy for a game, a game that has taken 3 years for the supposed power role to actually become more powerful and less of someone that you can bully for &lt;15 minutes, put a "ggez" on their profile, and move on to the next person.    
---
    
---
But in regards to the second to last statement you made, wouldn't that mean Legion should be nerfed because you get punished for your teammates being close by? Wouldn't that mean Plague should be nerfed because you get punished for your teammates cleansing? What about Dying Light, Thanatophobia, STBFL, or Freddy's gen teleport just to name a few examples? They all punish you for your teammates mistakes, whether it be slower action speed, or a shorter cooldown on hits/teleports, should the items I have listed get nerfed because they punish you or someone else for their teammate's mistakes?    
---
If you want to be able to 1v1 a killer, play Friday the 13th as Chad with a baseball bat along with 2 pocket knives and a healing spray.
---
# GOD DAMN IT YOU TOOK THE ONE AND ONLY BEST JOKE! WELL PLAYED AND FUCK YOU
---
Recently it's been pretty alright from what I've seen
---
Long time ago when I just started i was playing killer and I was R19 and got matched with a 4 man SFW with purple flashlights and they were all rank 5-2 it was brutal
---
So it can definitely happen tho
---
That was rude and unnecessary.
---
An entire section in the patch notes...
---
Well, he’s right. They don’t take skill. But he shouldn’t have messaged you about it, it just shows he’s salty.
---
Yeah, I get to wait 15 mins for a match, then get killed in the first 5 by a tunnelling killer. Super.
---
Empathy gives you insane map knowledge
---
They should change them all, I don't care which comes first.
---
huh, well now I feel dumb I never knew that
---
No I did this today.  I popped a mori for the hell of it and forgot.
---
I don't think anyone gets banned, ever. At least, not based on the DC rate.
---
I almost never played against top tier nurses (I’m a console player) so I can’t say whether or not the best base kit nurses always won the matches they played. I do, however, feel that with the nerfs to her basekit  people playing as the nurse even at very high levels are prevented from winning based on map selection alone, which is especially frustrating considering the nurse takes such a large time investment to become competent with relevant to any other type of play in Dead By Daylight.
---
I did that and it still says it
---
I have no problem with the final chapter having super hard challenges, but they shouldn't be main track. That locks lore out for some people. I'm prolly gonna get all the challenges, but, let's get real here fam.
---
I can confirm. It is so fucking boring patrolling generators that aren't even being doing and hoping one of the urban evasion claudettes makes her way out long enough for me to hit her
---
You're right. If you search this sub for "spirit nerf" you'll see that any and every thread suggesting a Spirit nerf was downvoted into oblivion. Suddenly she's a problem, interestingly. I guess it's just the new thing to whine about.
---
And what about her makes her so bad now? Good nurses are only slightly affected
---
I would personally say yes, no skill. But that also goes for the equivalent for killers which are Moris. Both which ruin the game making them shorter
---
I still remember the first time I hooked Ace.... I stopped to see if my headset got unplugged.
---
Inb4 Devour Hope
---
Yeah Head On seems like an interesting choice for a stealth build. Spine Chill is 100% needed to outstealth Myers, Wraith, and GF
---
God you are a pathetic weasel if you think my comment is "hate". Get a life you fucking loser piece of shit.
---
Spine Chill is literally the only perk I must always have, it always helps me so much (except when I am panicking and don't pay attention to it). Best perk! :D
---
FR tho, the optimization of this game is comically bad. Around the time when Legion came out BHVR released a patch they named "the optimization update", which overhauled the lighting of the game and actually made it run worse - and then they released a statement saying that they were now going to make optimization an ongoing process.
---
I understand from my own experience how much of a bitch it is to optimize code (even more so a game) but nearly every update has made the optimization worse somehow, with the rift now causing my game to crash frequently and it's kind of ridiculous.
---
First of it allows an early escape for a team that is getting shat on late game. As killer it’s frustrating when you’re all over them and have momentum for them just to escape through hatch, number 2 in a hatch stand off all the survivor has to do is follow the killer to hatch and get a free escape. It’s not balanced or fair as a 2 pip game for killer can end with entity displeased or black pip. It’s just like a mori, do you think it’s fair getting killed after 1 hook plus no chance at DS, exactly.
---
Overrated*
---
Wait, I thought they didn't want to do tiny Killers. Why are we talking about Edward Elric?
---
BREAKDOWN BREAKDOWN
---
Dcing = losing hope
---
Which means void time for you.
---
Survivors started whining about legion back when he was released and to protest his broken status, they DC'd every time they matched against him.  
---
That attitude kinda snowballed and now every asshole DCs at any minor inconvenience.  
---
It'll stay that way until the devs introduce harsher DC punishments, they can do that because of the dedicated servers, so, it'll be a while.
---
Okay
---
exactly, your a fucking survivor main honestly Michael does take skill but you wouldn’t know that, you just go against someone who’s good with him and think “oh this Michael is wiping his ass using me as the toilet paper so in conclusion he must be a no skill killer” spirit on the other hand doesn’t really need skill just good headphones and attention. survivors like you i honestly hate so much yous have little experience with killers but straight away claim they’re op or broken once you get out against s good player.
---
If they DC at the very start of the match it could be possible it’s an internet connection issue, but it could also mean they know who the killer is and are lobby dodging so it is hard to tell on some occasions
---
I mean. It does so much good. Even its negative has a chance to just help you.
---
Bond for sure, sometimes I pair it with open handed and you basically know where your whole team is at all times.
---
Screw that broken keys need it first.
---
Yes they have. Look it up. They got leaked
---
I love playing Legion when it comes to head on players. Hit one of their allies, see the instinct and have it lead me to a locker that I just stare at. You move towards that thing even a tiny bit and theyre outta there and you get a free hit lol
---
Stupid af. I think most of them are funny and half the posts on this sub are dumb shitposts anyway, makes a lot of sense to ban just the shitpost tier lists tho, right?
---
You are right sir. I'm sorry for calling Michael a skilless killer because I'm salty. I shouldn't have said anything.
---
At least steve doesn’t look like a crack addict.
---
Worth mentioning IMO, is that Jake's older brother DID do what his father wanted. 
---
So there was also a "Why can't you be perfect like your brother is?" and "Your not my real son." kinda thing going on.
---
Have you seen the recent post about how the shards shine when she is phasing? She is still strong, but its not totally random as people may think
---
Prayer beads is OP. Without the OP addons, spirit is very strong, but not OP in my opinion.
---
if you watch to the end of the video the demo says in end game chat that he "bugged literally against the air" which I can only interpret as the game stuttering and pulling him back slightly as he walks.
---
It legit exitsts to keep meg heads from sprintbursting away after failing a skill check
---
I detailed above in so many words how I feel the nurse’s base kit cool-down prevents her from traversing large maps effectively.
---
Yes shards would also be great. And there will allways be people tryharding no matter what :D
---
Pretty sure they said that a level of the rift is equal to an hour's play, which is also bullshit, but still.
---
I regret everything now
---
But with dedicated servers things should be better but it's a lie :D
---
Don't bring self care and put all your eggs into the healing basket, insta down killers, plague, sloppy, thanataphobia, dying light, nurses, etc.
---
that’s the idea
---
Nope, not a lie, just means you have shit wifi :D
---
 I think it's more that your strat uses a finite resource to theoretically gain someone 6 seconds later. Like, idiot proofing that way creates way worse deadzones, and removes the chance someone can Dead Hard over it to gain more ground. That's also assuming it either resets or the Trapper takes the time to reset a known trap.
---
Usually, they'll just eventually move it unless it singlehandedly counters a pseudo infinite.
---
Would you mind if I could try drawing something like this, just with all the characters w family issues?
---
Just tested in custom game, you can still blind killers by aiming at their chest. It actually feels a lot easier/faster than trying to hit the face.
---
I had a DC earlier today due to some file issues and having to verify, but that was like 10 seconds in. Only other time I've DCd is when my wife's needed me. Fear your significant other more than the entity, that's what I always say. 
---
Personally, it sucks when someone DCs and outs the whole team at a disadvantage, so even when we are having our asses handed to us, I try and stick it out.
---
Feng min sounds like an airhorn
---
Lmao I didn’t lose, he facecamped a Nancy with NOED
---
They need to add more dang points and/or make a good penalty for it cuz it don’t stop you from deranking and cleansing a totem gives you almost twice the points.
---
Not to me, but he couldn’t handle the fact he got beat and facecamped a Nancy right by the door with NOED on
---
I think that’d be a fair trade in honesty
---
I give my utmost thanks to you ms yamaoka, for this choccy milk is extraordinarily delicious
---
The whole point of Babysitter is to let the Killer see you so the unhooked teammate can get away while they come after your aura.
---
Welcome to dbd
---
oh right. i just generally dont get the meme format but i actually get it thanks to your explanation.
---
I know it always was a thing, and it does change how you play against her, since you have a way to know if she is faking the phasing or not. The original commenter was referring to a coin flip, as if it was completely up to chance.
---
No, not quite. Overly altruistic SWF gives you no choice. I just had a match with 4 pretty solid survivors. I hooked one and they all try to flashlight and body block. That's fine. But when I hook, they don't scatter. They all stay there. What kind of move can you make? You suggest you just walk away from your own objective?
---
This is PC you Pepega
---
you're a bit late bud
---
Insta heals got nerfed, nurse got nerfed. Happy?
---
Lmao, I did this earlier today as spirit. Were you David King by chance?
---
Four slowdowns wow what a gamer
---
I need to know what this is from lmao
---
I mainly play on pc but recently got it for Xbox too and it’s much better on pc it really surprised me how many bugs and glitches there were on Xbox it seems so much worse for some reason
---
Yeah? Why wouldn't he?
---
I just checked the Archives when the game brought me straight to the upcoming fourth level. Made a video covering every challenge and the rewards.
---
No way! Haven’t seen any post about this
---
That's the thing though, I have game pass on PC and play on PC. Unless the game pass for PC is matching me with only console players and not steam players :(
---
NOED is a weak perk, it’s not in need of a nerf. Good survivors literally shut it down before it has a chance to activate, that’s why no ones dumb enough to run it at high ranks
---
Real chads solo queue with no mither, object, and a broken key.
---
I am going to kill the next person who posts this
---
You're a pathetic weasel if you think commenting negative shit on people's posts will make you feel better about your micropenis. I've got a life, plenty great of one too. You're the type of person people purposely avoid. Ya nasty, bitch. Go be a toxic shit elsewhere, you're just mad you got called out :)
---
Right? My reponse to him when he got into my dms (as they do) was "why would i just walk away and let you win when i see people trying to get you." Its entitlement at its finest imo.
---
Spine chill also increases vault speed, really fucks with killers when they swing at an easy hit and wonder why you got away. It’s also a great build because the 15% vault speed makes a lot of unsafe loops safe.
---
It also doesn’t make sense how a meat hook can go through your entire torso and you don’t immediately die
---
Yeah.. I can imagine that very easily
---
So what? Also killer do. That's not a punishment, that's a choice you made
---
Ive noticed this. Ive only been playing a week but quickly realized *massive* amounts of time is lost because one person gets hooked and then the other three survivors camp the area for 5 minutes and absolutely nothing gets done.
---
Dude, spiders are cute &amp; dope. I love them sm
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
I thought I just explained it to you, getting a 4K is NOT a win. The developers intended the emblems to decide if you win or lose. It does NOT matter if you or any player thinks differently, the only official way to win is to pip. 
---
Please understand what I mean about what is and isn’t a win. I believe emblems decide a win and you believe kills do. That’s the real discussion.
---
When you’re in purgatory but you still gotta look fabulous
---
Spot the main character game
---
Some people are very unaware of themselves. Like the guy who downvoted me for suggesting that not letting other players win is reasonable.
---
It literally still is, you're acting like her phasing at you with all the advantage is the worse alternative to her standing still.
---
Still better than what usually happens to me: game freeze on loading screen. Have to manually quit the game and then I lose the BPS
---
Oh so like if it's a swf and they all leave through the hatch on one key? Yeah I think they should do something about multiple people on one key, maybe make it a red add-on to allow multiple people through, and only 1 other person, and it is like the styptic and syringe where it instantly destroys the key.
---
And the endgame one is fine to me. Cause if you dont have a key as survivor you pretty much auto lose unless you find hatch first. The doors are way too easy to patrol imo. Like that would be the actual use of the key I'd say. It doesn't seem op to me cause you went a whole game without an item, hoping for this very specific scenario.
---
Oh I missed the pc part, well believe it or not it’s somehow worse on Xbox that’s all I can say. I’ve been playing this game since first release and love it but queue times are killing me
---
https://redd.it/ddj6nv
---
It's called poor NetCode. Please people, stop saying "hitbox" when you have no idea what it is
---
You failed to do gens and you failed to find hatch now it’s go for the gate
---
Ahahaha, I should've know that glitches aren't uncommon in DbD.
---
Ruin is bad at its job. It stomps pubs it wouldn't be necessary against, anyway, and it's found and destroyed at the speed of sound against the players it's intended to counter.
---
I support
---
They also need to have you safety pip.
---
Yep I've noticed it happening a lot lately.
---
Yes. Is getting wild
---
The funny thing? Now also killer sometimes DC and now survivors are crying to punish them after months of wild DC..
---
Fine with Moris getting nerfed if keys do aswell
---
1) Small Game, Detectives Hunch
---
2) Hit Great Skillchecks
---
3) Learn Totem Spawns
---
4) Power through it (stop when the gen is throwing sparks to avoid skillchecks when it is staggered) or tap the gen instead of holding M1 (this is slower though)
---
Lets be real No Mither should give +100% bonus Survival points post-trial.

I'm declaring it as the killer is camping. Don't come get me.
---
Here's comes the "muh but game not balanced" squad trying to justify their dc
---
It means you’re being camped or the Killer is proxy camping. You wave your arms to get me to rescue you then you’ll stay there, especially against a stealth Killer or Bubba.
---
She's not fun to go against I can juke her but it's not fun at all to play against her
---
It’s very important to learn how to hit great skill checks consistently as a survivor, think of Ruin as incentive to learn quickly. Once you get good at hitting greats, Ruin won’t even be a factor anymore
---
I went against plague last night and only got sick as i ran to the open exit gate, every time a sick person wanted to spitroast a gen i would just run off to another.
---
Thank you glad I’m not the only one to experience this lol
---
BONES
---
Wait doing that means the killer is nearby? I just do it because it's the only "fun" thing I can do while on a hook
---
You should try coming up with a better argument. Hope and adrenaline are only active in the end of the game when noed also activates. Even with the health state from adrenaline which only benefits you if you’re injured hope is still better, especially against 110 killers like spirit.
---
I dont think they are on the same level, eboni mori is an insta win, idk that a key is. I dont think that multiple people should be able to leave on one key without an add-on that allows 1 other person and instantly uses the key.
---
*Laughs in Inner Strength*
---
Extremely unlucky.
---
Bad rng :(
---
Sadly they won’t dare touch moris due to baby killers.
---
Have everyone restart the game completely. It should fix the issue.
---
Fair. I think it also just depends on the survivors you're playing with. Some are... Really really dumb.
---
Okay. If you're on wifi switch to cable. If you can't, look it up on Google how to open your NAT for your specific modem
---
If it doesn't work either, there's another option, which I use. Take a laptop or a PC in general, and make it as an hotspot with cable. Link the console with the PC/laptop with the cable. After that go to network preference or something like that, you'll see your console (Ethernet) and your normal connection. Click both of them holding Ctrl and right click one of them, press "bridge connection" and wait. When the connection is established, delete the new connection and right click on your main one. Go to proprieties and check "share connection"
---
With this the problem should be fixed, in case you have problems when rebooting the console or PC, do the process once again to make the connection through hotspot stable
---
We literally reinstalled the game and still didn’t work
---
it means im feeling bored and/or playful
---
I’d say it’s map reliant. 
---
Maps like Lerys restrict Billy’s map pressure to hard to use pop to the full extent so on those maps I would definitely favor wraith. 
---
But open maps like Coldwind are just Billy playground no matter what perks.
---
Billy since he can get downs with ease, like instasaw
---
Damn, alright. Guess I'll farm the level 50 or just get back to lvl1 now.
---
Yikes. I have no idea then.
---
do you die on the hook a lot? 😂
---
No mither and unbreakable are active at the start, as well as legions ability. While it’s not a perfect analogy, it still is better than most
---
Fuck this I’m teaming with the killer
---
Maybe someone has strict/moderate NAT type?
---
To me is fun see her looking for me when I'm nowhere near
---
Maybe it's just me as I said, is more interesting than loop around like any other killer
---
Thanks
---
I've been playing for a year now and I got to rank 1 today. I feel the teammates get worse the more higher you go up in the ranks.
---
its incredible how unlucky u can get with this, even after the change that makes it more likely. ive chased a single perk down many a level 50 bloodweb. at one point i was almost convinced it was a bug while waiting for a perk to show up for my max level trapper
---
So iri head huntress but you don't need an ultra rare add on and you can blind them?
---
Recently had two survivors do this once to me so I just waited...it was Haunted Ground.
---
H I T B O X E S
---
You're.
---
Nice
---
Survivors use a lot of words but they don't actually know what they mean.
---
Probably because of rank unfortunately. On ps4 I usually get killer lobbies on about two minutes if that and survivor in about 3-5 minutes.
---
Just unlucky
---
That changed ages ago
---
What map was it on?
---
Toxic players are just dumb
---
Who do you have leveled up? Do you main killer or survivor? How do you generally play killer/survivor?
---
Did you watch the same video that I did?
---
I will neither confirm or deny that question
---
Whenever shit like that happens I can't help but say "I disagree with that hitbox" or something along the lines of that
---
And on the other side, if I down someone with a swing that clearly shouldn't have hit, I sometimes just stare at them and the window they jumped through for a bit
---
The new one called first cut or whatever.
---
She can go off your breathing, footsteps, scratch marks, pain grunts, grass movement and collision and not to mention if she is faking, then she can clearly see you and tell what you're doing when she actually does phase. There is no way you can consistently confuse her with all of that in mind outside of just pure luck, i.e. a coin flip. Also good luck getting to that next loop safely and consistently while she's coming at you at 176% movement speed.
---
I think what happened is that billy was blocking you on his screen but you thought you moved past him on yours
---
This was in Jund’s new video about why people complain about Spirit.
---
Reasons why I didn’t care for arguing include:
---
- He was Rude
---
- He was Repetitive 
---
- He was Stubborn
---
- I stand strong to my opinion on Spirit 
---
- I was tired
---
But obviously when someone shuts down an argument it 100% of the time just means they’re out of arguments. 
---
For anyone who was curious he called me pathetic and cringe, he said Jund’s video would never change anything and he only started arguing because I jokingly said Spirit can do “Standstill Mind games”
---
This post isn’t to take hits towards Spirit mains or people who defend Spirit, rather just showing how closed minded a lot of people in this community are.
---
“-_____-“
---
I main survivor and I have all the teachable for Dwight, Steve and claud.
---
This is beyond madness now. People who post this should be banned from the sub.

---
Pretty good job so far
---
Is floating not normal at this point
---
I had 4 claudettes at once. Most using different clothes but i didnt pay enough attention and just killed whoever i saw
---
Spine Chill is my favorite perk!
---
Good work
---
Either get your dream build on your main survivor, or get the rest of the teachables you need.
---
I mostly like playing stealth killers, especially Myers, but I'm starting to like Huntress a lot, so I might play her more
---
Cool I play doctor
---
It looks great mean! I just reccomend the eyes to  be a little smaller but besides that good work!
---
Sometimes I'm loading in and I see an offering not flip, and I think fuckin he'll, I hope it's not an ebony mori
---
And then I remember I'm the killer, and I burnt a brown offering
---
why banned if the game unlock this?
---
when i claim the last reward it oppenned it
---
Have you noticed that certain game’s servers give advantages to the person with worse ping? Other games seem to be the opposite. If your ping is slow you get fucked but if your ping is bad in this game it seems like an advantage somehow. Wish I understood game servers more but I honestly know nothing. This is just what I’ve observed from certain games.
---
Any recommendations on what survivor perks are good?
---
That and I'd say have the objectives available to complete without having to select them.
---
Reminds me when I played L4D on my old ass laptop back in the day, some things never change
---
Have one exhaustion perk like dead hard, or Balanced. Or Bills teachables
---
I actually got put up there mid game. &amp; could see the entire map.
---
Ok thank you!
---
no :P  
---
/s
---
I’d say go for David to get we’re going to live forever for future blood point farms and also dead hard is really good. After David it’s just whatever play style you prefer. For instance I like running altruistic builds so I generally run empathy, borrowed time , we’ll make it and we’re going to live forever. Of course you can also focus on getting staple perks like decisive strike, iron will, adrenaline. Borrowed time, balanced landing and then figure out which builds you like the best.
---
How’d did u do it?
---
Now, of spirits runs stridor?  Try again.
---
Yeah the Legion Members were vandalising a building and the janitor grabbed Julie (Franks Girlfriend) and then Frank stabbed him then forced the rest of them to help kill him then bury him so the janitor was basically the reason the legion got brought to the entity’s realm
---
Ironyyyyyy
---
Yep, better chance to hit greats too :D
---
Ok sorry everybody I will accept being clowned on about the time frame but this did happen
---
Meg, Nancy, David, Bill, Laurie, depends what DLC you have and what your struggling with. 
---
Like if you are struggling in a chase get some of meg skills, if you want to to be better about moving without being noticed go for Nancy's fixated or inner strength if you want the ability to heal without help. It all depends.
---
I  was working on a gen &amp; next thing I know I'm up there.
---
I think wraith works well with the pink seeing all with the gen intensity helping with what gen to go towards. Billy does work but you risk the chance of going to the wrong gen.
---
I keep seeing that it can counter Michael and Ghostface, but It can also counter Billy, Nurse, and Spirit! Since they have to look where they’re going to teleport/run to, it gives you a few extra seconds to get out of the way!
---
Don't at least your post wasn't "Idk if its been reported but I'm not getting cells from the rift".
---
Disregard that, that’s my friend.
---
I thought it was a bug too, hence my post here. Glad to see I'm not the only one in this situation
---
They need to take out the "Need to be completed in a match" BS. It just leads to toxic gameplay and unnecessary time wasting.
---
Also, it'd be nice if you can fulfil several challenges in a match. Ask Pokémon Go devs on how to track these multiple challenges without needing to activate only one challenge.
---
Forgot the tower
---
Is there a separate ranked queue? Maybe I'm queueing the wrong game mode.
---
Jesus man. I'm surprised u caught all of this
---
Because people has been posting it every day since the update released like nobody hasn't seen it. (everyone practically has)
---
Banned is excessive but it really should be considered Oversaturated Content because 5-10 posts about it every day isn't contributing anything new.
---
We just need a single pinned post about it for any discussion and remove any other posts about it.
---
Oh really? Is that what the new update was? I’m assuming. I haven’t played in a little bit.
---
Doors aren’t auto loss, it’s dependant on killer and exit gate positions, how far they are from each other and from hatch. Keys and moris have always been broken and a cheap way out
---
Potentially? If the killer is half decent the game is lost if 4-5 gens still need to be done. Regardless of whichever tier killer, it’s a massive advantage. You down 1 guy and slug for another, that’s 3 people in chase, and no gens getting done. Anything under 5k would be insulting imo
---
I feel like that if a survivor runs into a wall/tree while using an exhaustion perk, they should have an animation that shows them hitting the wall/tree.
---
Billy uses za hando
---
What..... there’s a difference between end game collapse and a key escape. EGC is 50/50 and is stupid because there could be 5 gens and a survivor just gets lucky.
---
Queue times are complete garbage in this game. I'd say like 10-15% of the time I get in a game in less than a minute as survivor no matter the time or rank. As killer I've waited less than 10 minutes for a match maybe like 3 times out of 30.
---
5k wouldn’t be worth the time. And if your mates would spend 15 minutes for you to get 15k BP, that’s fucking pathetic. You’re already a SwF you should be doing well enough to get that in first place
---
Its just one of the perks killers aren't allowed to use to compete with the DH, Adrenaline, BT, Decisive, etcetcetc using survivors, there are rules and laws to abide by.
---
You shouldn’t get to pick and choose who you face. I agree killers should be able to know who is SWF and who isn’t, but opting to avoid them entirely should not be a decision.
---
I almost forgot until someone DC'd and I just caught  the smallest look at it
---
When you take a perk or take a bunch of othrr stuff first, the entity spawns in. It will take a perk and work its way inward, along the same path you could've taken to get it. Once it gets to the middle, or blocked by something you purchased it starts from the outside again. 
---
If you imagine your Bloodweb like a tree getting the entity to eat more is just not buying the item closest to you from the direction its coming. If the upper has 12 items on its branch and ends with a perk, buying into the other branches to get the other perk drives the entity to go after the upper one. In a 2 perk Bloodweb as long as you don't buy any of the upper its possible the entity will consume all of it. Since it has to follow the path if it eats a item with a branch of its own any items after that one will be consumed as well because you have no way to get to them. 
---
Hope that helps some.
---
Why we have to wait? This is unfair
---
Hex: Mission impossible
---
He is one of the weaker killers in the game, why in gods name would they nerf him
---
Just take it and it wont appear again.
---
Try to hang back and lean around corners at gens to stalk people
---
no it doesn't. if you wiggle your arms on the hook and the killer isn't around you're going to die on the hook and likely get your teammates killed...
---
I havent got much for him yet but make your choice works on killers like him.
---
Go stealth and the survivor wont see you coming. Plus then you’re not tunneling the guy fresh off the hook, you’re chasing someone new.
---
My group has the theory that Steve screams like that because he has a torture fetish
---
I love Survelliance, Brutal Strength, Ruin, and Third Seal. It's a decent combo in general for gen control.
---
As for stalking, dont stalk from close if you can avoid it. I love stalking through windows and cracks/holes in the walls. However, only stalk them til it's at 99, and then run up and finish it when near them. Quick insta downs
---
This patch sure is interesting
---
r/iamverysmart
---
I mean I’m gay too but that never crossed my mind XD
---
Now THIS is the content I’m here for
---
I havent seen too much of that but its probably because people have had experience in the past where any people with .ttv in their name are extremely toxic. Many are ochido wannabes, just wanting to be toxic and show off to their 2 viewers.
---
So im guessing many people have a bias against them
---
Beautiful right?
---
I agree
---
I dont know why everyone hates him so much. Hes fun to play against. Low tier killer and is different to many others.
---
sometimes I feel them, seeing killers dc hurts because I feel his pain
---
Jake looks bald lmao
---
Platform: PC
---
Bug: In-Game
---
Description: Whenever I load into a game, the game immediately kicks me out and DC's both me and the killer. This has happened every single game, for 12+ game attempts, without fail. I am constantly getting deranked, I do not get to play the game or enjoy the event or enjoy the bloodhunt, which has a time limit, and I am very incredibly upset. 
---
The game was fine before the update.
---
I have tried every conceivable method in trying to make it work. And I do mean that. I have tried everything.
---
i think the wanderer is super cool and inventive!
---
Same same same
---
One of the most satisfying things in the game is downing a survivor with a hatchet as they’re running through the exit gates :) Huntress is definitely one of the most fun killers
---
This is what im saying. Low rank spirits especially are really bad and easy to juke for most of the game. They dont have the confidence to use her ability in a chase so they mostly chase at 110% speed, and many are no good at predicting survivor movements.
---
This is why I dont get the “spirit takes no skill, any noob can pick her up and dominate” because if the game matches me against a noob killer, they all do far better with trapper or hillbilly than they do spirit.
---
You can still attempt previous Tomes for the rewards but they won't give the Rift Fragments as each tome is tied to a certain rift.
---
Its better to be level 50 because it gives you 3/4 perks per bloodweb, only go for prestige if care about the cosmetic you will get, i usually only p1 for the weapon because p3 is annoying to get for the mask on most people and the clothes dont mean shit.
---
I’m not going to argue with you when you have no clue what are even arguing about sorry
---
Because it’s a cheap win and rewards killers even if they don’t play well.
---
If you want a loadout different from the meta for some reason quick and quiet and head on works really well for me
---
&gt; that are worth doing? 
---
Because he wrote this.
---
I agree with this as well, but to play devil's advocate here. Maybe they kept the slash sound because Myers isn't actually hitting you with the pipe, he is just using the sharp edge of it and as a direct result, the pipe cuts/slashes you.
---
Oh ok. Thanks!
---
Everything is still good, it's just no longer the ridiculously broken level of stuff people are used to
---
Y'all keep adding. We gonna make a whole Joke Book.
---
Lmao I play on PC and I keep having to close the game by task manager cuz after game I get and infinite loading screen I didn't want to leave the game now because of the bloodhunt but is so lame have to leave after every single match
---
That's so weird, If I see they have a flashlight I'll intentionally start the pallet break to avoid it and it works every time
---
As soon as I saw this post I knew it was questionedturkey
---
LMFAOOOOOOO
---
Bringing a perk to counter ruin is worth doing. People even mentioned small game which isn’t bad but stake out also helps with healing checks. Also paired up with diversion it could help out a lot.
---
Wow lol
---
Lol when you see the toxic Dwight bring a purple flashlight and white ward, making them lose the flashlight is more fun than winning the game. Its even better when they rage and cry post game about franklins...as if its an OP perk.
---
Better still when they die because they try to run back and pick it up mid chase.
---
Who the hell gets that attached to their items?
---
nani
---
Ok, Thank you very much.
---
Ok could use those, what's the meta?
---
Whoopsie!
---
Its skill finding the hatch first before the survivor because they both have the ability to interact with it. If the killer finds the closed hatch at 1 gen left he can't take a fat shit and smear it over it to help it blend into the ground, its just a "oh hope they dont have a key"
---
..alright then
---
Key doesn't work on doors only on hatch. Takes up a whole item slot. All you have to do is get hit once and you drop it. Idk how much playtime I got. Enough to know there is more counter to keys than there is to an eboni mori.
---
I also know if I go into a game as killer with an eboni mori, I'm gonna destroy. If I go in with a key, I get tunneled or have a chance to maybe find the hatch and get to use the key I've been carrying for a whole match. Making me a target and taking the place of a medkit, toolbox, map or flashlight that could have helped.
---
As long as those arent iri heads, i approve 😂
---
I agree. The new power is called crazy and after the cutscene at the end of the 1st tome The Alchemist looks like he goes crazy when he sticks the serum in himself. Probably will have the old plants on the map that he can get his power refilled from them go crazy whatever that does.
---
It's a good perk, but it hurts your chase points with all the sneaking. ☹️
---
Oi Josuke!
---
Cool
---
&gt;paired up with diversion
---
Your joking right?
---
Im not saying be a meta slave but there are so many better perks you could be using then this. The counter requires you to be in a terror radius without being chased which if you are in the radius your probably either being chased, about to be chased, or are sandbagging your teammates for stacks on stake out instead of doin the gen. Not to mention no killer beyond green ranks falls for diversion
---
Small game helps because you know if its triggered in 5 locations you have found ruin and its gone completely, stake out is not good.
---
Yeah you have to be the last alive

No
---
Wow, bout the 20 time I’ve seen it today!
---
When you get in higher ranks, killers will never respect pallets and will swing through them and you’ll get punished hard for that.
---
Ghost Bob
---
That's very difficult/impossible to implement in a game where it's possible to hold the game hostage. Yes the end game has improved it, but you can still find people taking the game hostage.  
---
They can't just punish a person for being screwed over by some asshole.  
---
Just 3 weeks ago i got trapped in a corner by a Pig, i had ran her for 3 gens, i then lose her and she downs 2 people with noed and all my 3 teammates chose to DC for whatever reason. So while i was looking for the hatch i hear the heartbeat, so my reaction was to hide in the corner of a loop. She sees me, gets in front of me and blocks me. Leaving me standing there for almost 15 minutes before i DCd too.  
---
Why should i get a 10 minute timeout on top of that?  
---
I'm not saying it's common for these types of asshole to roam in DBD, but they can take the game hostage forcing you to DC. That's reason enough why timeouts wouldn't work, unfortunately.
---
Thank you very much! I'll be sure to enjoy it with my cake!
---
pretty sure you do not need to be injured just have it on
---
Ok you're a troll. Gotcha
---
Or you can just not get blinded while carrying the survivor. It's super easy to avoid the light beam when you are not in animation. Why would anyone need lightborn for this?
---
Thx
---
as a killer main, i suggest DS
---
People complained about the Legion but imo Plague is the most unfun shit to play against. You have to stay injured the whole game, constantly making sound or if you or someone else cleanses your whole team sufferers for it.
---
I don't see how it's fun for the killer as well, you just just run around as a M1 killers and survivors can't even fight back because they're just perma injured. It's fun that you can mess with survivors by throwing up on everything, and she is the most interactive killer but jesus do I hate playing against her.
---
Why so salty for a correction?.. shit happens, be corrected is good. Unless you're a troglodyte, you do you
---
That’s true about them not having a perfect game but most people dc very early game and tbh any good killer can handle 3 survivors with 4 gens left no problem. You can literally hook 1 person and slug one person and they would be fucked. As long as you don’t dedicate to much time to one chase because of one loop god among a group of 4 that lost a survivor early game, you should destroy them
---
When a killer dc the survivors can’t even play
---
Wow.. how many spirit you've seen with stridor? Since her launch I've seen 1 spirit with stridor in over a year
---
Try again
---
Anything that isn't locked behind DLC?
---
What are you going on about now. Proving my point that moris and keys are fucked
---
You can get the serums to get it for free up until the rift ends (so in about 64 days). However, after the rift ends you can still buy it w/ auric cells at any time
---
So if the killer closes it the aura goes away? If not, keys would be a pretty sick combo, basically guaranteed escape
---
You only have to mori 1 Survivor for that challenge.
---
you stop earning when rift ends and you can keep it for 2 weeks
---
I am a trapper main, and I saved up Bloodpoints and recently bought the spirit. I leveled her to 22 using what bloodpoints I had, and ran a game. As soon as I found the first 2 survivors on a gen, they both just quit when they saw it was the spirit. Then the others let themselves die on hook.
---
People really hate this killer, its insane.
---
Not to be blunt, but that means they just suck at it. The killer is most vulnerable to blinds during all their locked animations. There's also the case of timing, I know you'd want to wait just a beat before blinding them if they're picking up a survivor, or the blind will overlap with the pickup action.
---
But also keep in mind flashlight blinds are known to be notoriously unreliable by comparison due to bugs or connection issues.
---
But they could have brought an ebony because they didn’t have an ivory
---
Looks amazing brodie !!
---
They are both bullshit with them giving early wins for either side
---
Oh, you’re approaching me?
---
Event Skins will always be available for purchase in the store with Auric Cells.
---
Completing tiers in the current Rift will give you a special currency to buy them for free. (or the previous years Halloween skins if you weren't around for them)
---
As long as the current Rift is open you may obtain the skins for free. (You may have a few days after the rift to use any Serum leftover to buy the skins before they expire)
---
The game isn't broken but the emblem system certainly can be.  Since it's possible to rank up through immersion and hook saves you end up getting teamates that are thoroughly outmatched by the killers up there because they never learned how to run a killer.
---
Super appreciated :)
---
Doesn't mean you have to mori every Survivor if one DC's
---
My vote is for the pan sound like in PUBG
---
No mither plus this is not happening
---
id rather a strong one, the game is 1v4, the killer should be stronger than any single survivor, its a oversight in the design, like decisive strike not being used for anti-tunneling, simply just fucking over the killer's momentum.
---
borrowed time gets a bit annoying, probably that. but thats all i can think of. oh.. and flashlights
---
Iron will, borrowed time, adrenaline, and dead hard/balanced landing is a good build.
---
If you are going to bring an ebony might as well make the most of it
---
So you'd rather have old legion back?
---
You can say that, but it just worked. I tested it before I posted the comment. You aim at the chest and it still blinds.
---
Awesome!!
---
 strange question because i use ruin? Ok then why should any survivor who uses dh or ds be in red ranks
---
Nah we shouldn't pamper people who rage DC, Smite recently implemented a system for this and it's working great
---
Jake for Iron Will, Bill for borrowed time, Meg for Adrenaline, and David for Dead Hard
---
God better be squaring up real quick
---
It depends on the killer since they have varying heights. I just default aim at the neck height and adjust from there.
---
Thank you! :)
---
Isn't there something saying that they paid Jeff in beer as well? I don't know what the Alcohol laws are in Canada but in America you have to be 21 or over to be able to purchase it and buying it just to give it to minors is illegal.
---
I can't wait for more Legion lore in the Archives.
---
It's lag... not hitboxes
---
Learn to hit greats it's not impossible
---
Hatch is Killer sided , i think you mean the keys
---
I usually don't purposely let people escape unless they're baby survivors. ( I will still kill baby survivors if they fight back)
---
Chapter 13: The Hooker
---
The dropping a pallet in a chase bit I’m worried is gonna lead to lots of wasted pallets.
---
*Ambulance noises* Incoming
---
You answered your own question
---
Those situations are rare, in all my games I've never ran into that. Rage DCs are much more common, every 4th match has a survivor load in, see pig traps, Freddy meter, or plague sink and DC
---
I've had it with your lies, steve
---
people didnt complain about legion for the same reasons why people complain about plague, plague is annoying but no where near the most. being injured is not that hard.
---
Dwight Hairfield, Leg Thomas, Jake Mark, Claudette Corral
---
deep down i'm going to miss knowing what the killers ate at 3am after hitting a blunt
---
Ur reading WAY too into this. All s/he is saying is that it is satisfying to see how someone reacts to their own toxic shitty actions bearing them the fruit they deserve.
---
Dont let survivors rule the chase. Push them where you want them to go. Say if you go one way they get to killer shack and if you push the other way they are out in the open. You push them the way where they cant do shit.
---
Hey, that's a decent amount of info to be fair
---
It happened for everyone. Same boat here for Thana though it sucks.
---
Happened to everyone
---
While I agree somewhat. She's actually rather rare now which makes those games more of a novelty for me. I'm actually excited when I see her tall frame bobbingy about in the distance... at least its not another Spirit. ;) If she became popular again, then sprint burst is very good at negating her reach. They could turn down the amount the vomit animation plays however.. also a rework of her special is clearly needed. I've not been in a single game where she's been able to use her corruption in weeks.
---
I'm more talking about how the hatchets are like playing roulette on occasion. Say for instance on window vaults and occasional pallet drops the hatchet will phase through the survivor and disappear like my mother. Then there's times when you'll have the accuracy of a drunken stormtrooper and somehow rip the spinal column of the Kate you're chasing.
---
Hook gymnastics, a.k.a killer is camping the hook, keep rushing gens.

Scoops shirt with jeans looks cursed

Not really. We still need to see how many challenges we will get on level II and III. Level IV could still be changed.

---
Me, doing the last Killer Tome
---
Depends on location, favorite is US, favourite is uk
---
You're that guy. Let people play the way they want to. Not every killer wants to sweat a 4k every match.
---
You were getting downvoted for being unnecessarily toxic. There was no reason to start this "lol you shitty survivor mains" crap.
---
Plot twist: you're a streamer.
---
You must be joking
---
idk i just think 4 flashlights is a big red light for me you know
---
Everything perfect, the cosplay, the gg pumpkin, the name, just needed the halloween theme.
---
Most red rank killer I come across slug the 2nd to last survivor and hunt the last one so the perk Bill has that lets you get yourself up can really piss a killer off.
---
Another example of typo Hex:ruin a meme
---
Yes it's reasonable. Including if you get the premium track you get your money back unlike the other 929,366,329 games with it
---
You are the one that responded with extreme toxicity based solely on my username without even knowing the reference. I'm very happily married, today was my 7th year anniversary, and our first baby is due on Nov 12. You are literally talking shit to someone who is 100% happy with their life. I just think this particular video is cringey as fuck, and it is unless you like cartoon porn which I'd bet you do since you are obviously an incel.
---
That's fair, but I have too many war flashbacks from the age of 20 minute mend legion @.@
---
But it's the truth...
---
Keep in mind survivors look for the red stain in chases so if you are at a wall loop it is a great mix up to walk back wards so they can’t see the red light. It doesn’t always work but you will be surprised how often it does
---
Oh my bad, great explanation! Thanks
---
ZA HANDO!
---
Got unhooked by Jeff after a good thirty seconds. Surprisingly enough that Jeff had Aftercare and was actually cool the rest of the game, just really devoted to his gen I guess.
---
Lmao that sounds like Jeff mains
---
Yeah, I don't know, dedi servers have been making gameplay really hard sometimes. Freddy feels like his hands have 8 foot whips attached to them and some games killers just seem to insta-bloodlust.
---
2 pallets were camped btw Lul
---
the rule 34 sub leads me to believe its Huntress
---
Terminatahhh Aeeughh
---
In that case, they should be able to tell by your ping or something to that effect that the connection was bad and let it slide. Then again, that may not be an option. I used to have Cricket internet so I know how that goes sometimes.
---
Oh, i'm pretty new to the game, guess i'm lucky i didnt suffer that.
---
Serum stays with the rift pass those go when the rift closes in 65 days.
---
The skins are forever and after the event will be for sale.
---
Assuming the 4 tomes average 85 fragments each (which would be more than currently shown), there would be 350 fragments still needed.  That equates to ~700 games over the next ~65 days.  So they probably should bump it up a little bit.
---
You're not just wrong, you're stupid!
---
I only have a problem with eboni mori and multiple survivors escaping on one key use. The rest is fair to me.
---
[It was hell.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT9X-oTj7es)
---
 Omg this happened to me today and I got so happy. I got a 3k and a dc (the lasts survivor was about to be Moro but they rather quit)
---
Y O U   C A N ' T   P R O V E  T H A T ? ? 
---
You do realize everything you say isnt truth right?
---
I would have used real hooks on my eyes and mouth but looks great.
---
Then what’s the point of playing. No sense of accomplishment. You’re that participation trophies guy.
---
Here comes the crapper. [crapper?](https://youtu.be/MucoWsqtPhc)
---
When they admit that they are it kinda defeats your purpose of trying to start a fight...so get bent, byeeee
---
You know, probably it's because I suck at the game, but I have never been able to get instadowns with her vomit, am I doing something wrong?
---
PGTW is god tier on every killer, but it synergizes more with Billy than it does with Wraith. Anyone with high mobility like Billy or Freddy can have a nasty combo with BBQ or Thrilling Tremors + PGTW.
---
Where’s the guy who lists every other post like this?
---
Yeah but rift points
---
Right!? If they bought it or it was a “rare” item I get it but...
---
Ayyyy My Unity Render ;P
---
Back in 2017 when the game was having a lot more problems, my progress in the game was completely lost. Twice. All perks and bloodpoints just disappeared. Contacted support and they gave me 6.5 million bloodpoints to get all my progress back
---
I was literally making a joke lmfao,,, I'm not sure you've ever had someone joke with you in your life because it was clearly one and it went right over your head.

I came in here making a joke and you got bootytickled, of course I'm gonna talk back. I don't know what else to tell you.
---
What would his ability even be lol
---
Her vomit isn’t an insta down, this guy is mistaken, corrupt purge only does one health state of damage
---
understandable
---
rawr x3.
---
I'd rather get hit and remove the palette than be afraid of it and add extra loops.
---
Can't even enjoy the new update nor the Blood hunt because every match ends with an infinite loading screen
---
I mean I fully expected to have longer wait times as a killer. Same issue was in evolve before that shit the bed. But like holy fuck I can't even play as a killer :(
---
Corrupt purge isn’t an insta down, it only does one health state of damage per projectile
---
I think you should delete this and repost it with the artist's name somewhere in the title. I mean, if you're going to repost anyway ...
---
No, there will never be a complete fix that they will agree to, the best solution is to implement what I said and then try out solutions after. The major thing this sub gets upset at the devs for is their lack of action to problems we face; there are solutions but people get too worked up over the 1% chance of something happening. I'd rather have the solution to a common problem tomorrow rather than wait for months for a possibility at a solution for a rare problem later.

---
Your win/loss should be determined by your own skillset, not by devs and their built-in crutches. Base Nurse had counterplay and didn't need to be touched. If by unfair you mean that a good Nurse would defeat any survivor then that's the way it's suppose to be. No survivor should be able to 1v1 any killer if the person behind the killer is skilled enough.
---
As a straight female...at least twice a day
---
Ah okay. Really unfortunate because I dont plan on ever putting bp in Nurse but its whatever
---
Why in the name of all things holy would give them the idea of making a challenge that is physically impossible
---
Also?? Nah who needs porn when you've got a healthy sex life? I think hentai is dumb but yeah okay, you're a bit hypocritical lecturing me for assuming things then doing the same
---
You can’t stop the pallet break animation so I’m guessing you mean you intentionally break the pallet. If that is the case then it’s the easiest way to blind.
---
Just so you know: it's clear you don't know what you're talking about.
---
I kind of like the idea they had with new nurse add-ons. I feel like addons should be for fun or to change the palystyle of the killer. Like get rid of the iridescent heads and prayer beads and add some fun shit but also make the killers base kits be viable.
---
What is mori?
---
when was the last time you saw a serious debate here other than "tunnel bad, ds op" etc?
---
He's full of it. The Nurse takes skill on pc or console. There is no such thing as a pre-good Nurse. Either you're skilled enough to be good with her, or you're not. She has the highest skill cap in the game. She takes more skill than anything any survivor could ever do in this game. That's part of why they resent her - because they know that if that player is skilled enough that they have little chance against her. They want the skill cap of all killers lowered to satisfy their own low skill level.
---
I was afraid of this.  Not even going to bother now with the game.  The Rift was the only thing that brought me back, but seeing this level of difficulty IF it is hiding a story piece behind it ruins it for me.
---
I think there's nothing worse in the game than mending. I'd rather be camped. Because at least the Killer is doing nothing and my team is getting the objective done.
---
Legion has never been fun to play against. And has been the most problematic thing added to the game according to a majority of the community. Remember the disconnect protests? Not to mention most Legion players are some of the scummiest Killers I have ever encountered. The Killer is fine I guess when they are played the way they were meant to be. But a legion can still tunnel you down with nothing you can do about it. I'll get chased the entire match by one. But I'll usually Escape since most Legion players are not the best.
---
Their power was brain-dead easy and most of the Legion mains seem to be upset they don't get an easy win anymore. This killer was just leftover files from deathgarden. They were just created to sell cosmetics and rework borrowed time.
---
No amount of buff/nerf will make Legion fun to most of the community. I mean look what happened to Freddy. He went from the worst killer in game to a very fun to play as killer. Arguably top 5 with the right add-ons or perks. Same thing should happen with Legion. Most great streamers like Scott jund or Usyliss will tell you they have an inherently flawed design. Their current power should be completely trashed and they should be reworked from the ground up like Freddy. Other Killers like trapper or Bubba just need a buff. But Legion in their current state will never be fun for most people
---
I actually love killers who bring variety to the standard chase. Michael, Ghostface, and Huntress are all fun in that regards of keeping out of LoS as much as possible and handling pallets differently with Huntress. With several other killers spicing it up in some way such as Demogorgon, Trapper, Hag, Plague, Legion, Clown, etc. albeit all with differing degrees of effectiveness.
---
What Spirit does isn't a chase though, it's literally hope you don't get hit every 10 seconds she phases.
---
They should be able to remove the collision because old freddy wouldnt collide with survivors that were awake.
---
Pitchfork.
---
Yeah, the spirit's dad murdered her

I’m super intrigued on how you would go about if you ever do the doctor in his scrubs with his spine out. Really cool

That’s why standard procedure is “don’t cleanse, but if 1 cleanses, all cleanse” it’s best to not cleanse, but if one of your jack off teammates decides to do it, your whole team is better off doing it and trying to wait out the timer. Don’t want to be the idiot stuck with the broken status effect while the minigun-wielding Huntress is running around
---
I’d love the game right now if not the queue times and if ranks meant anything
---
Even now it’s such a hit or miss. Sometimes you get potatos in one match, then some pro group and then potatos again back to back like ffs stop giving me the extremes

That's what I mean yeah, maybe purple ranks just don't have any survivors who know how to blind

I wasn’t « roasting » you, or anything of the sorts. Its just that i showed you reasons why spirit isn’t luck based as much as people think, and you just answered with biased opinions, disregarding the points i make and disregarding the facts. There is no point arguing with people of your sort, so I ended the conversation telling you to get better. That way, you will truely see how powerful spirit actually is.

Make your choice is dependent on the killer you're playing. Very mobile killers that can take of advantage of the shorter cool down will prefer it at level 1/2. Nurse, Spirit, and Wraith with speed addons come to mind. On less mobile killers, level 3 is a convenient Decisive Strike timer.
---
This isn’t normal?
---
...you can't make killers independent of addons without removing addons entirely. They are there to enhance and modify the killer power. Maybe some killers should be buffed to make them less addon dependent, and others nerfed, but addons make killer much more fun.
---
You watched A streamer do something like what ur describing so apparently it’s true 100% of the time? 
---
Most people would agree Billy needs addons to be consistently viable in red ranks. The only killer this rule isn’t true for right now is Spirit and BHVR has confirmed Spirit is getting a nerf. 
---
But you aren’t listening to anything I’m saying. Killers SHOULD. NOT. BE. ADDON. RELIANT. They should not exist. Addons are meant to be Augmentations of power, not their source of strength.
---
You ever watch Thor Ragnarok? Remember what Odin said to Thor when he said without Mjolnir he can’t defeat Hela? “Are you Thor, god of hammers? That Hammer was meant for you to focus your power, to control it. it was never your source of strength”. That’s what adddons should be. Killers should not be defined in viability by their addons.
---
We don't do that here.
---
Jeez BHVR just add the Spy, there will be a disguise killer like everyone wants, and a butterfly knife
---
What a helpful response.
---
Yes they do, but killers should not be shoehorned into running addons to be viable at all. That isn’t at all fair.
---
Like calling other incels for no reason, right?
---
Welp, I guess a Chad like you won't understand the difference between a couch and a chair at this point

Hey, could've told you to kill yourself. But I didn't, did I?

Yeah that one is a catch 22, still I will sacrifice that for not have to go through 100+ bloodwebs for making my character playable
---
Or you could be like me and Massacare the intire Family :)
---
Same, it's just fun watching the cool animations for each killer
---
I don't see anything wrong with popping the gen and then getting the unhook. Especially if it's over 60% done.
---
Yup, it works the same way w/ iridescent shards
---
Got, stay proud to be ignorant then
---
Enjoy the circle jerk then
---
Monitor and abuse to lower terror radius, discordance so you know what generator to phase too. Make your choice is good because you can quickly get back to the hook, and PGTW/ruin for slow down
---
Bc survivor isnt hard? survivor is hard 100% when you are not with a super sweaty swf.
---
just bc i main survivor does not mean i dont know what it takes to be a good nurse. Its fucking hard, one of the hardest things in the game. 
---
Why do you just assume just bc i main survivor i have no idea what im talking about when it comes to killer? Survivor takes skill. I will admit survivor is easy when you have a really good swf, but tell me how many god swfs do you run into every day? Im guessing its around 1/10 games. 
---
I (and most other survivors) play with our low rank friends that cant loop or do much of anything other then gens (at most).
---
the hook 5 survivor on basement kinda bother me lol it makes me wondering if new game mode gonna come out since level 4 gonna release  around december
---
what opinions? It isn't an opinion that Spirit can track you via like 5 different methods while in phase. If you want to bring up the argument of perks like Iron Will, then you can bring up the perk Stridor which makes Iron Will useless (along with making people who don't have Iron Will even easier to hear).
---
It isn't an opinion that she moves super fast that you can't outrun her phase, it isn't an opinion that if she's just standing there she can't just start using her power when you start walking away.
---
Oooh I could totally make that mask. But I wouldn't force anyone to deal with seeing my back rolls hahaha
---
He's drunk prob, don't mind it
---
Our matchmaking sucks but we get games fast, so there’s that :)
---
My cheap win fulfills me when I get that message after the game by a salty survivor who was also "rewarded for bad play" by adrenaline. Ah call it a crutch perk I'm having too much fun listening to the cries to hear it.

Everything else: 11/10
---
DC should be punished
---
"Why do killers facecamp me?"
---
Yeah but didnt they say they would do that soon with bans and timeouts for DCing?
---
I agree. I also hate her nerf but im just saying the idea of add-ons being for fun and to change the playstyle of the killer rather than overpowered combos or instadowns. Cuz i also hate whenever you say something like “oh the should reduce the charge time for pigs lunge” and people just say “oh well theres add-ons for that” like i agree that you shouldnt have to use add-ons just to make the killer playable that shit should be base.

Also, in Alberta (where Ormond is) the drinking age is 18, so Frank could have legally bought it. The store has no way of knowing if he'd give it to a minor.
---
What if i dont even have pp
---
True
---
Sure. When y’all stop tunneling
---
That’s the thing, I hear the constant “Pigs dash attack is so bad bc of the windup for it” “oh just use an addon and then it’s viable” yeah uh...that’s the issue, I should not *NEED* an addon to make an aspect of a killers kit viable. I should *WANT* to use an addon bc it’s fun, not bc it’s necessary.
---
I still got the notification form the comment you deleted where you tried correcting me on you karma score and saying I had no brain only to realize I posted that hours ago when you still had 62 karma. Thanks

Yup, the difference is tofu is dishonest making dumb clips acting as a potato survivor while Scott actually have good ideas
---
Pitchfork and eating humans
---
I never said killers should be addon reliant. Good billys can get at least a 2k against a really good swf without addons, he doesnt need them if you know what you are doing.
---
i would say Billy, huntress, spirit, nurse, freddy, and maybe hag depending on the map dont need addons to do good at high ranks. 
---
The best billy players only use addons for fun, but dont need them to do well. 
---
Trust me i want addons to be a 2nd thought, i wish addons where not as strong as they where and i wish the base kit of some of the weaker killers where better so they didnt need them. But what im saying is, if you are good enough, you dont need addons most of the time.
---
Also down voting every response you get from someone you are talking 2 is a real good way to get that person to stop talking to you.

No, just pitchfork.

Thats why you say spirit is fine, you dont play survivor at all. At rank 1, 70% of spirits euns stridor. T R Y A G A I N
---
I, uh... I just do it because there's nothing else to do.
---
Ahahahaha so relatable. Let me wright a novel about the last bad game I had with the spirit.
---
Thanks a ton for this!  If some of these don't get changed, I'm done for good with the game.  I would buy the pass if I knew I could complete it within reason, and from what i'm seeing others feel the same way.  Hopefully these aren't going to be final, although from all appearances it seems they are.
---
Tea-mate as in drinking tea together or did you mean teammate?
---
Stripper Clown when?
---
Yeah havent heard of it but wouldnt surprise me. And tbh if anything survivors should get a 5% bonus gen speed when someone dcs and killers should get their bbq proc and stack but idk if they'd do that
---
I never realized just how many characters in this game have shitty dads. They should change the name to Dead By Daddy Issues
---
I’m a new player... how does Spirit work???
---
The sole purpose I'm getting ds is because of these tunneling pieces of shits I'm going against
---
Complete them with it equipped
---
slightly? I mean I think its a well deserved nerf and ebony moris should probably be nerfed too but 16second heal compared to instant 2 health states? I think it was nuked from orbit, no way it's worth 7000bp now. It could be a green add on and it'll be fine.
---
Grammar Errors.
---
and Teammate.
---
It be like that sometimes
---
Yes
---
Heal your teammates up.  From the wording, self healing should count as well.
---
It's been posted coutless times, but it changes nothing. It's nothing wrong with the game, it's the density of players. Only 5 people can be in a game at once.
---
If you flap I do not come. It's for as long as I can remember means killer is camping.
---
Incredible cosplay😲!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
---
The lack of oxygen in her body caused the blood to turn blue.
---
Watch out! She's got a butter knife!
---
It’s kind of annoying that they charged $40 for this game on switch and then fuck us over by not giving us the same content at the same time
---
You flap you hang... because to me if killer is camping I'm staying on my gen.
---
Yes just look at the shape’s obsession
---
I dont think so. It works for ms
---
Yeah, it's a bummer. I guess they just chose a tricky time to release the switch version.
---
lmao gr8 vid
---
It 100% wont. There would be 0 reason to purchase the pass if completing stuff for free gave you the 1000 cells back instantly.
---
Would love to find a way to force this for footage recording
---
I'm a woman. Not a Chad.
---
I'm just gonna get downvoted to hell, people don't really wanna hear anything bad about the paragon of balance that the Hillbilly aparently is.
---
Key is definitely no skill, biggest survivor crutch left in game at this point.  That being said killer was definitely a clown for messaging you salt about it.  He should have just taken the L and moved on.
---
For starters, you specifically were the first comment on this thread saying “yeah it suck but it is how it is” which is at the very least complacency if not support, but it is NOT opposition. So your ability to claim you don’t like the system as it is, is pretty flimsy. Complacency is indifference and indifference doesn’t make changes. If you really wanted killers to be less addon reliant you wouldn’t shrug your shoulders and brush this problem aside as a symptom of the game being how it is. 
---
You say good Billy’s fed 2Ks. A 2K is regarded as a tie. Good killers, and I mean killers that are clearly superior to the survivors, should be getting 3ks at the least. It’s supposed to be on the survivors to outplay the killers not the other way around. 
---
Your comment on Billy players not needing addons and only using them for fun is also false. Many players have said Billy is viable at red ranks with instasaw and is just an M1 killer with good map pressure past that. 
---
And really bringing votes into the discussion? Very mature. Here’s a little heads up buddy, you automatically upvote your own comments and posts so if I’m downvoting them and ur hitting -1, that means someone else also downvoted you.
---
Way out of wack, but it is limited to 5, so it can pass
---
You can be both! I'm a gender abolishionist, anyone can be a Chad, women included
---
Well I'm still rank 1 after like 5 games, lol. I'm just playing Killer now mostly to get my Myers to P1. I'm honestly just waiting for the new set of challenges to come out.
---
Nah, DH and DS are meta perks right now... Streetwise is B tier maximum. Windows I can put on C though.
---
So is it time to form "the league of killers who just wants to help farm" for these rift objectives?
---
My man really just told the dbd community not to be toxic. That’s like someone telling me not to be autistic.
---
Ten more days! :)

Too bad wasn't a clip. Was curious to see that instead of a screenshot /:

Fellow fog traveler you’re about 420,069 posts too late so if you’re able to turn back the hands of time or you have a time stone then the damage is done

oh my god it’s billward
---
I guess you guys aren't true r/shitpostcrusaders if that joke whooshed right over your heads.
---
That wasnt even English.  GG!
---
Make a mod that changes Pigs stun sound to the Minecraft pig death noise
---
Spirit is fine only thing that could use a nerf is prayer beads could fix it by just haveing the noise delayed like following slowly behind u instead of being completely  silent
---
Yeah, was pretty funny. They both were being potatoes and the title itself was a joke if you watched the game
---
It's trippy. I have gotten infinite sprint burst before. Once all 5 gens were done, i kept running at a fast pace till i left the map.
---
SCOTLAND FOREVER
---
Thats pretty much the joke
---
The most helpful it can be is if they are already exhausted and so they never stop being exhausted

Well, then continue to power through a 90% gen, killers love when you keep regressing the gen trying to finish it before the killer hits you
---
Wait, sanity? Did they introduce Cthulhu?
---
No I did watch the game, but it was a rank 20 spirit.

Ah sorry, I perceived it as one stealing content from the other haha

---
In that case, that possibility to take the game hostage must be patched out. Give survivors the ability to climb obstacles or give free phasing and endurance after 5 mins of being in the same spot if the killer is near you and also in the same spot.
---
Also, most games with a punishment system for DC have a grace period for it. You can DC 2 times without a punishment, when you DC for the third time you will get 5 min timeout, 4th time it will be 15, until it reaches days and even weeks for more successive DCs.
---
Why even engage in conversation with them? Refuse the in game chat and I’m sure your console allows it too? If you got what you want just move on. Not worth the time.
---
hahah
---
That’s damn good stuff op. Always satisfying to watch.
---
DH and DS are kinda bad though. Only reason I left them high is because the meta.  For DH you just wait 2 seconds to swing and for DS you just slug for 60 seconds. Both are nullified so easily, where as Balanced, for example, generally can't be nullified just by playing smart, and still has benefit after use.  
---
  
---
Streetwise is just a personal favorite though, B is probably accurate.
---
Ive been accused of speed hacking with legion multiple times and yes ofcoz wall hack when i was jus using my power.
---
Leaked you say?
---
Aw, sorry to hear you cant have kiddos (assuming you want one). I have a black lab/German shepherd and he is the sweetest thing. Honestly I thought you were dicking with me and I did it back. Nothing personal intended.
---
I’m fast as fuck boi!  That’s pretty crazy.
---
it was in the moment lmao, wouldn't let me vault across and when I ran back from the other side to see if it would let vault it was already broken ;/
---
I compared two perks and added that one is easily countered by a common killer perk. You’re comparing two perks that do separate things with both not being countered by the legions ability. You might as well stop trying to justify your argument because every time you make it look worse.
---
If you're referring to the tier 4 one it 4 sacrifices in the basement in one game. They  definitely need to make it easier. Even getting 2 is a challenge.
---
How do you even do these challenges. 3 end game collapse kills? Like if there are 3 people i must’ve gotten stomped on. No way I’m getting 3 people
---
I’ve been using the double bp and trying to get Dwight up there. I’ve got him t2+16 and tomorrow it ends. I may be able to get him back to 50 after the 3rd but no way am I gonna get good perks with it
---
I'm a fan of DH not for the fact that you can dash an attack but because it allows me to reach a window or a pallet and give me that extra loop.
---
As for DS, I understand your point and it's a valid one but even if the killer slugs for 60 seconds, he's wasting so much time and you can always go on a locker for example.
---
Why? Bond and empathy are worthless unless solo queueing Deliverance has the ability to not be used once. DH is unreliable especially with Dedicates Servers. DWM is well... DWM. Unbreakable can win games that are already over.
---
I would like to note, she has not responded after that last message.
---
Thought of a hint of Pennywise lol. I know it's not but it's funny that this popped up in DBD Reddit.
---
Do not run Monitor please. You cant tell if she's phasing inside terror radius.  Id rather have Distressing to make people paranoid.
---
The lights really add to it! What a cool build/mask/makeup job. It looks so epically creepy in motion!
---
We live in a society
---
i agree. hope they make some changes on those mission
---
Zimbabwe Rin
---
When you ask your small game teammate why they haven't upgraded to detective's hunch yet
---
For me its fine,I play on xbox btw,I saw some people saying it takes some time on ps4 but im not sure.I live in Brazil,the location could be a thing too
---
Why the fuck does Sandy have a fish shaped head lol old SpongeBob was somethin else

I’m sorry he was mad I accidentally sand bagged (being chased and dropped down to a new area to run the killer, he was there on a gen I didn’t hear) killer realized he wasted too much time on me so instantly chainsaws him. And now we’re here
---
a lobby has 5 slots. 4 slots can go to survivors. only 1 can go to killer.  You do the math.
---
You took another video that wasn't related.. you're pretty dishonest.. I took into consideration the videos talking about spirit seriously, not cherry pick another video totally unrelated
---
As some of you know already, theres a bug where when you have completed the first level of The Archives, when closing and opening The Archives again, it lets you see the last 4th level of The Archives. Imo these challenges are really tough, some might have to get nerfed a bit, e.g. completing 4 generators while running the Dark Sense perk in a single trial, or the two flashlight saves in a single trial.
---
indeed
---
mixer
---
OMEGALUL
---
Haha, racism is so funny!!
---
I jus hate it when the survivor came down with second wind broken status coz i always bring we will make it. Deliverance in my face is spitting in my face.
---
Ok? I'm not deleting it, anyone who hasnt completed it can see it here.
---
Very funny, asshole.

---
that was hands down one of the best responses to "everytime u seen me u chased me" like how dare you chase a survivor you found?
---
Like I said,  very funny.
---
See I like the constant buff but We’ll make it is definitely an amazing perk!

Did you see the OhTofu video pictured? He doesn't try to play like a potato.
---
Spirit is great, they just need to get rid of those mfin beads.
---
Yeah, just try to make your shitty joke not as bad by pretending I am offended.
---
Spirit players are hella bad
---
Learn how to moonwalk (walking backwards so they can't see your red stain). At rank 6 this still gets people.   
---
Also learn how to mindgame pallets and when to mindgame versus just breaking the pallet. I recommend watching some YouTube videos to see how high rank killers mindgame.   
---
And one of the best ways to get a survivor away from a loop is to walk up to the pallet and act like you're going to break it and then chase them down after they start running.   
---
But a big part is learning how to use a killers power to end chases. Some killers are easier than others but most powers can help end chases in some way.
---
Why this sounds like a porn title
---
ooo ya, wmi is totally circumstantial which is its downfall, where as bn is consistently useful! :)
---
farming your teammates is another form of sandbagging
---
Playing Survivor is too hard I keep messing up the little generator circle and the killers are too spooky and I don't know how to stop them from chasing me BHVR why have you forsaken me
---
Yeah, is it a known thing? If so I feel dumb
---
Yeah the entire dbd population on PC play on 1k+ PC setups
---
Oh please Hexy doesn't give a shit about other people's experiences in the game he just used it as a scapegoat to bitch about not being let in. You're seriously claiming the dude banned for mori spamming is now the champion of the people for people that disconnect? Dude randomly disconnects on Billys all the time get the fuck outta here. I don't like the DCing problem either, it does ruin games. But its almost impossible to fix, so I stopped caring. Ban DC = suicide on hook. People will not play games they don't want to, ever.
---
Urban is trash tier since urban players are trash.
---
It's a pretty good pumpkin
---
It says by any means, so long as they don’t escape or dc you should get it
---
Yea it's a known issue that has been well reported. They're currently working on a fix. Don't worry though, there have been many posts addressing the same thing as yours despite BHVR already letting people know they're working on it.
---
why you bully me
---
Sometimes you need to give up chase, there are some survivors you will really struggle to catch. If you tunnel vision and spend forever trying to get him, you're probably going to find the gens will pop fast.
---
I mean, they might be people who play survivor more than they play killer.  Like I said, mediocre killers.  They certainly have fully leveled up killers and are green or purple ranks, typically.  I'm a mediocre killer who plays survivor most of the time because it's more fun for me, but I still completed the entire archive without using a mori or any perks that I find cheesy or unfun (NOED, Devour Hope, etc.).  All I had to do was play 3-4 matches with the 4k challenge selected before I got it, no need to resort to anything special.  
---
But since you can only do one challenge at the time, I think this encourages this kind of behavior.  Whereas I think it would be interesting to see killers use different kinds of perks and playstyles instead.
---
Instead of making a point you call me stupid, that might not help you help me get whatever your point is.
---
“if there is haunted grounds” oh give me a minute let me just check what hex perk the killer has on
---
I do the same thing and it works, beats wraith, spirit, and pig every time!
---
They aren't fun to play against and they're quite overloaded in the speed department.
---
DC &gt; unfun killers
---
Relatable
---
I have to call bs. Most killers with noed dont have thrill of the hunt, so how would they know when youve broken their totems?
---
Half of the Rift quests are for Killers.
---
Killers can only be 20% of every match.
---
You right though
---
Gen tapping is significantly slower than just powering through the ruin.
---
It's everyone, but you can advance Rift stages with only one path.
---
We get access to two.
---
Do your research.
---
Carver would be a better killer if you ask me
---
Danny got destroyed by Lee in the game anyways
---
Love the new map!
---
Well, we like Otz.
---
I wouldn't mind a revamp, i just don't find his ability fun or effective to use tbh
---
Yes... I obvs mean the Double BP Bloodhunt Event... Lol. I actually didn't know when the Withering Blight was supposed to end so that's what's up. Thx
---
Why the fuck do you have a different style perk icon on every perk
---
This made me laugh a little bit harder than I should have.
---
Yeah np haha, Jund commented "WTF" on Tofu's vod lol
---
Removed salty after game chat
---
You could always get a little sweaty and level Meg for Adrenaline + Sprint Burst.
---
memes can be funny or at least smirk. Tier lists are worthless garbage that aren't even fun. The only funny part from all of the lists were that ghostface was in none of them.
---
God, I just got tombstoned by a Myers 20 minutes ago for the first time in months.
---
Plain and simple rage quit since you don't get penalized anyway. I'd say the accidental ones are the vast minority. Sucks for both the killer and the survivors.
---
Being camped/Killer near.
---
But there’s dedicated servers now. Doesn’t that mean the killer isn’t the host?
---
I couldnt remember who was who,havent played in a long time
---
The one he supposedly killed Judith with. It's the only knife in the store.
---
Claudette
---
I thought the perk on the right was blood warden lmao
---
Add voice lines
---
Or add actions you can do around the campfire, like Kate can play her guitar and ace can select someone to play cards with, Claudette can make a flower crown for everyone and Feng can chuck her phone at the away/at the killer because there was no reception so she couldn't play league of legends, Jeff could draw a picture and show everyone, who sign a thumbs up.
---
Cause Detective has the criteria for a gen to pop and you except that to happen in dbd KEKW
---
I called you dishonest not stupid..
---
Now I'm starting to think you really are tho
---
Finding the totem is ideal, but Prove Thyself is an unconventional option. In any case, stop holding M1 when you get a normal check, since you can't progress for 2 seconds.
---
I think it just meant Jeff was a bum and lived with his parents.
---
What’s this little eye dude?
---
Your loudout could include beast of prey, mad grit, iron maiden, noed, and they still bitch.
---
I'm not sure actually, since I'm still getting varying ping indicators in the lobby. 
---
That shouldn't happen with dedicated servers.
---
No problem.
---
It would still be annoying and tilting as hell, but I suppose it would be fair. Still very strong though.
---
Everyone says that, but does anyone really look for totems? It's a waste of time to go around the map checking every map tile when you need to do gens. And that is if you don't run into the killer while traveling the whole map. If you ran Small Game then maybe you could do that, but since that perk doesn't really increase survivablity against most killers nobody uses it. I've even tried to prevent possible noeds before with that perk but it can really screw you or your team up if the whole team has one member  running around not working on the objectives when they should. I feel like the problem is really just how NOED works. It's very different from every ability that works similarly to it. All of the others require skill or work, except maybe Rancor, but that one could be excused as risk and reward, but NOED just feels off, less like a useful skill buff for working hard and more like a get out of jail free card.
---
BUT LET'S DISCUSS THE CONTRADICTION!
---
Final gen pops. NOED doesn't proc. They know their totems are gone then. Pretty sure that's what they meant.
---
Very nice. She wasn't even at full health which is a big mistake. Even then, I've fucked up as a survivor standing near the exit gate because of NOED. 
---
I've done this as the Pig with NOED, and just let the survivor go since he/she did not teabag. It's a good lesson to learn.
---
"Will take 100 reply just to get you in the same page" 
---
What else is that implying?
---
Well, I just fail NNN
---
Why stop holding?
---
I've been running ruin-discordance-Thrill-BBQ with prayer beads and mother daughter ring for a few days now. Can say it's been working wonders
---
The Entity takes a lot of inspiration from the Lovecraft mythos so it's safe to assume that it doesn't really exist within the laws of known time and is able to access places and time in history without much effort.
---
Please...no
---
If you have a headset? Try out stridor, it takes some time to get used to it be it's quite effective.
---
Surveillance or Discordance is pretty good as well as it helps with gen pressure and knowledge.
---
As for your other perks slots? Snobby butcher to make healing take longer and Monitor and abuse. Smaller terror radius and high fov.
---
Ash says yes
---
Only if the Killer's very good or very lucky, and it'd soft-meta Iron Maiden consuming one of their perk slots.
---
With people like you, yes
---
During the period you can't progress, you can still trigger additional skill checks, so you'd risk chain regression if you held.
---
Both seems to force survivors to cleanse in my experience. And even when they still refuse to cleanse, they still lose.
---
Sure buddy.. sure..
---
And NOED is countered by doing something other than gens when you walk by
---
You really like to cherry pick and ignore everything else. Ok you're **that** kind of person, I won't reply to you ever again, hf
---
yuM
---
You don't need to be a Feng Min main to point that out.
---
(If we're keeping the single power)
---
Clown's bottles now give a special status effect to Survivors who are effected by the gas. (Let's go with Intoxication for now)
---
Survivors who get Intoxication get an Indicator on their status HUD (Similar to plague) that fills the longer they stay within any gas cloud or being directly hit by a bottle.
---
The more filled the indicator is the stronger the effects of The Afterpiece Tonic are. (extra slow and even more impaired vision.)
---
Survivors who don't come in contact with a bottle or gas cloud for a while will have their Intoxication indicator very slowly drain.
---
Sticky Soda Bottle, Robin Feather, and Smelly Inner Soles become base.
---
For every bottle Clown still has when reloading the speed of reloading is increased by 15%
---
(Sounds like Doctor &amp; Plague's baby but what can you do with a power like this without changing it?)
---
I totally agree with this bro. Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
Yes it is preddy ridiculous, now add to the long que the fact that matchmaking sometimes puts you in the wrong ranks...I'm a rank 14 killer and god matchmade with a team consisting of rank 8-5s,was pretty hard not gonna lie.
---
You're sure... that my opinion is in fact the one that I reported?  Seems a solid inference, I guess.
---
I know you said you wouldn't reply but can you provide an example/proof of how that was cherry picking?
---
They should have few Killer challenges vs. Survivor challenges, anyway. As it is, most Killers can't get games. Which makes them even sweatier about their objectives because who knows when the next opportunity will arise?
---
You should get gud you need more strats I usually play around rank 1-3 and I don’t have much trouble
---
I have never killed another Ash.  
---
I save em for last, down them a few times, then carry them to exit or hatch.  
---
And all I will say in chat when people complain is *GROOVY*.
---
But they were toxic Korean randoms, which I'm sure gives him an excuse /s
---
what if you cleanse 3 dull, so haunted has 2 lit when the gens finish. If someone cleanses haunted ground, the other totem becomes dull, so would that now become noed or does it have to start when the gens finish?
---
Never have this issue in my two man lobby, ps4
---
What perks do you usually run?
---
"Mom said it was my turn on the xbox"
---
Exaggerative. I live in NZ and queue times are 3-9 minutes (rank 14 as killer)
---
As a survivor main:  
---
Never explain yourself as a killer. My peers will just throw you in the Survivors Rule Book for Killers loophole.  
---
Makes sense you'd maximize your BP if you got an E-Mori, feelings be damned.
---
*notices his bulge* survivors: **OWO** Wraith-kun what's this?
---
In a game that is based solely on a race against time it’s all about who can snowball which side first at the start of the game.
---
People getting slugged/hit/hooked before 2 gens are done? It’s going to be a hatch game and at least 1 potato is for sure going to die before survivors can ‘turn’ the tides.
---
Perks/items/addons help push the snowball effect, and ultra rares/purples/ ebonies DEFINITELY push that snowball right into the survivors faces.
---
BREAKING NEWS
---
 This just in!Killer kills everyone! Upsets the masses!Quoted one Dwight Main: "How dare the killer kill everyone with an ebony mori? What kind of killer would do such a thing like.... KILLING?"
---
r/LeaksByDaylight
---
I feel like it's just artificial longevity so they did this on purpose, but yeah. If nothing LOST progress, it'd be fine. If you could get what you earn without specific missions, it'd be great.
---
Nope it'll eventually expire but they make sure you know and give a reasonable amount of time before it does.
---
Birds is the best quest and honestly I'm not sure why we have others.
---
He asked for good perks. Not fair or fun perks to play against.
---
Thats the only thing that makes sense, but it seems odd how he wrote it.
---
&gt;Text-based discussion submissions about personal perk/killer/map/... tier lists are not affected by this change
---
ASMR &lt;3
---
Bruh you have fun in the basement?
---
You know, old Legion could stab you and then just moonwalk behind you until you stop to mend or bleed out. Why can't we have a good killer? Legion was just good then, it's a KILLER, it's supposed to be a challenge.
---
In fact, Legion is a perfect example of why Spirit is a problem. Where's the interaction between survivor and killer in this situation? Spirit phases at a loop, either guess she's faking it, call her bluff and start running off. At which point she phases to hit you, vault over the pallet where she faked phasing directly into her arms.
---
Just like how old Legion basically meant you might as well be standing still once they got the initial stab (which was all but guaranteed), Spirit is just a coin flip based on blind guesswork on countering making her uninteractive. Not to mention that if they get close enough, they can just follow your footsteps and breathing.
---
There's a difference between a challenging killer and an unfun killer.
---
I’m waiting to do that too
---
That's what Im saying. Monitor is bad on her because it shrinks her terror radius...
---
 Jake because Iron Will is very useful, and it’s only his first perk.
---
Add extra nerf to it please
---
Aw man, if it was sooner, you could've uploaded to that contest
---
People can use flashlights and not know eachother
---
I included them in the title :)
---
That’s just how it is at lower ranks. You have to try and slow the game down as much as possible. At that level the difference between losing and winning gets down to seconds. You have to capitalize on every mistake made.
---
I played the game since beta/release and a while ago they reset all of my stats (except achievements but I lost legacy stuff) and I sent in a ticket so they gave me 19,000,000 bloodpoints lol
---
It is very generous of you to give me the most delicious and exotic chocolate milk it was very humble of you my lady.
---
Why not? I enjoy having my own custom mix and match.
---
Yeah honestly dedicated servers suck. I’d rather know the ping is shit than the game tell me its green and then this happens. 
---
Sure, adjust and play around it, but it still feels dirty af when I’m the killer and it happens. 
---
Maybe they should code it, that if you get the stun, you can’t get hit there. Its absurd that both the hit and the stun can happen there
---
Hey look at it on the bright side, at least you have a nice view of Jules
---
I don't think they were expecting a legitimate answer
---
If you DC too often you will
---
Clown customization is S-tier at least
---
Not me, i make sure to facecamp every game and call out toxic for doing gens
---
Shhh it's okay if they do it on second hook. /s
---
Small Game and Plunderer’s Instinct should be moved up in my opinion.
---
The game ended upon arrival for me because of a DC, and I still got credit.
---
As yes, fellow doctor main, how do you do?
---
r/subredditsashashtags
---
Well i was a bit defense because of the downsides so sorry if i was a dick. I dont have monitor but I see tons of spirits run it, just so they have less warning. If they just hear phasing they might think she's moving across the map. But if they hear the terror radius then a phasing sound they are gauranteed to get off the generator.
---
Lol
---
Because for every 4 survivors a killer is needed. If too many people are trying to play killer, then killer queue times will be long
---
Is this a troll post?  I don't think it makes sense to have a challenge where you get 4k without using your power, if that's what you're asking.  I listed a series of challenges that I think are interesting.
---
thank god, i was about to have an aneurysm trying to figure out what was happening here
---
Mini-missions over each character?
---
"For a bonus fragment this match: Unhook 1 Survivor."
---
"Bonus: Disturb 10 crows."
---
Legion is stupidly good for points and emblem because they can slow the game down.
---
Also who needs blight when you have Shirtless Frank :)
---
^Don't ^Judge ^Me
---
Let him set bottles on windows and gens. If the window is vaulted or the gen is popped, the bottle falls and breaks. They can be removed with time like disarming a Trapper trap, though.
---
Spirit is by far the best killer to get with Shards, or Clown due to his perks (if you care about teachables). 
---
Legion is fun and gets tuns of points, but he’s definitely one of the easiest killers to bully due to the reasons you mentioned. The appeal of him is that his power directly stops survivors from doing gens, since they need to mend. Add that with Sloppy Butcher and Thanatophobia, he can be annoying to play against. Survivors either waste a lot of team healing, or just stay one hit and have a pretty decent penalty to gens anyway (which can be added to with Dying Light as well).
---
Legion is fun/easy to play in that their power is straightforward, awful to play against (easily bullyable but it’s very annoying to spend so much time just mending). Up to you, but if  you’re going for just the best killer overall, it’s Spirit by far.
---
These *are* the dedicated servers. We've had them up for a while now.
---
Overrated is a Adrenaline, Underrated is Unbreakable
---
In case haunted is gone before 5 gens are completed then of course the spare totem which became dull will lit again as NOED
---
If you take down haunted *after* 5 gens a re completed, it shouldn't activate back again as NOED is meant to activate immediately with 5th gen completion or closing of the hatch. However, with EGC there are multiple events to trigger that perk now, so i am not sure.
---
The guy who took you and your group hostage in that warehouse in S2
---
Silence the clap of his ass cheeks
---
I'm a rank 18 killer, that's probably a reason it takes so long.
---
I’m on PC and it happens to me a lot. I’m pretty sure it happens when you exit a match at the same time as somebody else.
---
I don’t have too much evidence, only that it doesn’t happen when I die early, and it happens more if I survive to the end of am killer.
---
That’s a neat idea.
---
The person on their own, to the right, is always the obsession right?
---
I always find you crying about Spirit.. you really won't learn how to play, just play at the same way using the same build for every killer in the game.
---
God damn, you should play more online games if you think that's a problem. Iron will works on every killer when playing tiles, so it's just a flaw of yours not being able to change your playstyle
---
Like survivors in 2016 said: adapt
---
Not many options if you don't want to rock what amounts to a crop top on a lad so thicc.
---
best doctor cosplay ive ever seen man! awesome!
---
Who do you play
---
You got a 3K so what they’re saying doesn’t even make sense lmao
---
Neat! That would be cool.

Yeah that’s not a good excuse to dc mate...

You let go when it pops for 2 seconds.
---
Naw they just full on brain dead mate, don’t worry about them.

Yup talents are mandatory picks until they are gone or I was lucky enough to max rank the good ones leaving only trash in the late tiers.

Probably had the glitch where he had no UI at all and couldn't see skillchecks.
---
ps4 have less idiots survivors than pc
---
if u see truetalents games the survivors he matchup with more of the times are like rank 15 on ps4
---
the game its up to survivors,if they are decent the game will over quick no matter how good the killer is
---
Plot twist: BHVR is sick of being called Survivor-biased and this is a leak of the next update.
---
Did you claim the challenge afterwards?
---
Goddamn, fuck this game.
---
Getting prepped for the fusion dance.
---
I dont even use my moris.  
---
It's cool to bust out a kill every so often.  
---
But every game?  
---
That's no fun, to me at least.
---
If you think spirit is fine you are dumb. Some of the most popular killers agree that she is broken.
---
If feng min would look like that I won't go anywhere near her as the killer.
---
I feel torn with Kindred. I've been using it hoping that people would be smart, but instead I get 2 people trying to save me. It could be so much better if 2 people worked on gens and one tried to save the person in the hook.
---
Yeah, the beads just need a fat downside and she'd be fine.
---
And true. That's pretty painful, but I guess Legion is STILL better than Doctor, since he damages when he uses his slow, but even Madness 3 for prolonged periods doesn't deal damage.
---
Spirit does sound more flexible. She also does better in close quarters with the way her woosh works, but in open areas she can trade stealth for easier tailing.
---
This bug happens for everyone on the planet. Don't stress it, it's nothing special at all.
---
I've been playing for 100 hours and have blown the gen up while gen tapping twice
---
PainReliever
---
You'd be put with our servers in 'straya. Don't worry dude, there's always a lot queue for killer's, just some days it's drastically worse
---
I had to do that playing SWF. :( 
---
You’re totally right, tho. Solo doing it must be a nightmare. It’s literally all dependent on strangers. That’s not even a case of fair or not, that’s just bullshit.
---
spine chill WAS mad underrated. Sprint burst is way overrated.
---
Okay but do Survivors earn their escape with DS or Adrenaline?
---
I can agree that NOED gets players something they don't deserve, but Killers don't have that option exclusively.
---
Help, this wasn't intended as a bug report but I suppose could also function as such.
---
It's also not an exploit as I have no idea how this can be replicated (I recorded midmatch because I had no idea it would happen prior)
---
What does it doooo???
---
I know lol
---
new ruin buff
---
He didddddd lol this endgame chat is one of the more ridiculous ones I've seen
---
When I was just levelling, NOED was one of my only good perks. Ended up using it on a baby. He disapproved when I explained how I instadowned him.
---
Aw shucks. *hides gun*
---
Y’all have fun with the same meta perks over and over and over every game? Nothing wrong with switching it up.
---
can't run into a trial without it
---
Man it's kinda laughable how stupid they sound. I mean that was a win for you. As a team they lost so idk what they're going on for
---
thats why u dont talk to them
---
when the game ends go just move on
---
not even a gg and shit like that
---
stuns the killer when you get out of a locker
---
I mean when you're 90%, a skill skill check comes when the killer is about to hit you and you fail it/hit the white zone, when you could've tapped it to finish it instead of trying to keep your proud...
---
You killed 3 of them and they used a BPS for you. 
---
This is a big W
---
It won't let me zoom in on it but im assuming there's another one in the green circle?
---
Ok then gonna play Forever Freddy for the rest of my life

The challenges may need some rethinking but it's not my place to complain. Just commented to show you that this wasn't a one off bug.
---
Well, leather jackets are always cool, but if I got Legion, I'd want to be Susie, and that's a LOT of shards...
---
I have heard they're good BP farmers. Is that still true of Doctor, though? That's kind of a tossup.
---
Ik, thats the normal stupid "argument" people do even do they dont see you playing
---
Rules of survival

---
Leaver queue with long ass waiting times, filled with other toxic little shits.
---
When the gates open
---
Yeah there is
---
We have dev streams in which they play the game rather often, this is just the only meme footage we have.
---
The vhs memetic thing is the best
---
you have to delete it and not redownload it for an hour, that’s what i did
---
It's happening to literally everyone. I doubt they'll ban their entire player base.
---
Thats me oh no
---
Bring monstrous shrine, it'll be 10 seconds shorter of a wait. You probably put him in the basement anyway
---
I feel the greatest irony when im stalking someone mid gen tap
---
I’ve been accused of tunneling because some guy threw himself at me and then was surprised when I hooked him and killed him. he literally ran to me, and then was surprised when he died first, and thought I was at fault
---
It really makes no sense to me. With how much money they bring it, they could toss a million bucks to develop the best matchmaker ever seen, and it wouldn't even dent their bottom line, and more importantly, would significantly increase player retention and new-player experience. Driving even more revenue. It's the most obvious business choice imaginable. Why they don't do that is beyond me.
---
i know, i just noticed the memes about it lol, well i might delete this later then
---
Ahhhh I forgot about that. Thanks. I remembered the alias, not his original name.
---
 Seek and destroy!
---
Alrighty. See you in the fog next time.
---
I cleansed two hex totems twice yesterday, but they weren’t that close to one another.
---
True, but you see how you're mostly just suggesting perk builds? And for those, they'd have to use low-tier perks because BHVR REALLY hates new players and actually sets the Bloodweb up to give deliberately inferior perks to lower-level players. I'm not sure I want to open the gate or escape with Hope, or escape chases with Lightweight.
---
Killers are harder to even assign goals for. Find Survivors with Spies from the Shadows? Basement hook with Shrine? There is no surprise attack to connect to Insidious or special opportunity Distressing creates, except maybe gathering BP.
---
IIRC the final serum is on Tier 47 so you don't have to do the entire pass and you can get a good portion of the way there by competing the challenges.
---
I want a strawberry one
---
I like how, after downing the first person, you started a chase and crouched, coming back to the pallet. :) good strat against potatoes
---
Happy for the tf2 reference but sad for the no bass cannon reference
---
Ah, I was spirit and I had moried the other three but hooked the last person (Feng)
---
demoknight dbd
---
But doesn’t the lore also heavily imply Jeff stumbles upon the legion disposing of the body, meaning they were taken at the same time. I feel like this is just a plot hole.
---
Never ran those before, ill give it a try
---
they run real quick and go stabby
---
Removed for spam
---
All you need to do is make it so no silence perks Trump his gas
---
Good luck!
---
If they just reduced or removed the movement speed reduction that Clown suffers when throwing his bottles, that would be a nice little boost that wouldn't immediately catapult him into top tier.  Right now unless you've got an addon that expands the gas cloud, increases the slow effect, or increases the slow duration, it can often feel completely pointless to even use you power because it slows you down just as much as you it will slow them down, not actually shortening the chase any.
---
Also, a LOT of his add-ons are just fucking boring.  Not, bad, just not interesting to use (though some are bad).  He could do with having a few add-ons that really change up his gameplay style.  Maybe 1 that reduces the gas cloud's base hindering to 0% (meaning that it doesn't actually slow down survivors unless you have other add-ons that increase your hindering effect), BUT if you hit an intoxicated survivor they don't get the speed boost that an injured survivor normally would.  That way you the bottles would be more useful chasing down survivors in open terrain or in combination with perks like StBfL, PwYF, etc.  Or maybe an add-on that makes it so that if The Clown is inside a gas cloud when he starts a lunge, the range and speed of his lunge is dramatically increased (and by "dramatically" I mean "he basically gets a Pig charge) BUT the gas cloud's area of effect is reduced.  Or maybe an add-on that every time a survivor becomes intoxicated, they get a stacking increase to their hindered effect (so the first time they are intoxicated is normal, the second time they are 1.5% more hindered than base, the third time they are 3% more hindered, fourth time 4.5% more hindered, etc etc) BUT it reduces the total number of bottles you can carry by 2.
---
Ah, I get it now.
---
I ran her with no perks and got a 4k, she's op
---
for a serious answer i really enjoy his ability to track survivors and chaining multiple hits, i dont really have to think too much with his power which i enjoy even though they arent the best killer.
---
Yes.
---
Random. It's random the quality and quantity of what the entity will scoff down in one mouthful.
---
playing legion against a team full of self care is hilarious
---
Yeah I'm not buying a battle pass until the game works.
---
Not to be offensive but what is this?
---
It's stated that Vigo can be a woman and in the Cutscene this shadow indeed has a female voice
---
But you could just kill yourself on hook... I do agree it does need to be harsh and coming up with exact numbers is hard, the point is that the first DC should not have a penalty or should have a low penalty, then it should quickly start rising. Something like 5/15/60/240 could work, or maybe even 1/10/60/240.
---
Except... you can actually tell when she's phasing cuz the crystals light up
---
Your flair is literally "Inner Strength" which needs you to destroy a totem to work smh
---
This question isn't really all that necessary as you'll notice that every perk, offering, addon and item is random as you wouldn't noticed.
---
And that's exactly why they should never tie bonus BP to No Mither. Everyone running No Mither for the grind = solo survivor QoL goes down the toilet
---
I do on mobile cuz they dont show you like on pc
---
Well now you have a small one!
---
I don’t see how it’s my fault that he would continue to self care as I’m being hooked against bbq.
---
it means "I'm home alone" and 89% of survivors will sprint burst over to the hook.
---
I changed my phone so I don't have any copy pasta ready for you, brb.
---
Here's quick one: Sorry 🙁 Sir But I'm Going to Have to 🚫 Stop 🚫 You 👈 Right There 😱 You have 😡 violated 😡 code 1337 of the MI5; The Removal 🔨🔫 of Dank 😎 Memes because of 😨 Emojis 😨 You are under ⛓ arrest ⛓ by ⭐️🌙 Intergalactic Law 📜 of the Meme 💯👌💯 Dynasty 😎
---
With sloppy and thanataphobia it is beauty.
---
It is glitched the devs now about it. They are trying to fixed it. I’m on Xbox
---
You seen the new Halloween cosmetic? It's pretty sick looking.
---
No because Daily challenges and the Archives/rift are 2 different things, I imagine the archives as a massive pool of daily challenges.
---
The difference in power level between solo players and SWF at red ranks is too great. A SWF lobby is basically unwinnable for killers if they aren't playing the top tier killers/builds, so everyone usually plays Nurse/Spirit. Killers that are strong enough to face off against red rank SWF make the game unwinnable for solo queue players. I mostly play solo queue survivor at red ranks these days, and it is absolute turbo aids. It's just Spirit every other game, and everyone dies or DCs in the first minute.  
---
SWF is the justification for Spirit being as powerful as she is. With over 50% of the population of survivors playing solo queue at a given time, and only 5% playing 4-man SWF, this is not a healthy way to balance the game.
---
He still wasted time, it would’ve been better to just do generators or in his case take off self care and put on iron will.
---
His blaming you is dumb. That is wrong yeah. But the reasoning that you’re both giving isn’t wrong. (I’m just working with what was provided)
---
Wouldn’t Jane and Jeff be there too?
---
For that trial I put on an Ebony mori, only for a survivor to dc at the offering screen. I go back to menu and the challenge was completed :)
---
But no it doesn't have to be a mori. Sacrifices count too
---
We out here trying to smash that 4k quest.
---
The only thing i really would like to change is the rarity between father's glasses and prayer beeds.
---
Prayer beeds is fucking busted as shit and should be ultra rare.
---
Father's glasses is a nieche addon, which i never see it played in high ranks.
---
Deleted post huh? I wonder why 🤣
---
Go to the Swamp boat and annoy 10 or so birds at once.
---
Don't cleanse. The end.
---
Well, I don't mind an excuse to use a perk I don't usually, but that they're so crummy you need to be baited into it is kind of annoying. Like, Hope should also be No One Left Behind.
---
They can use teachables for all free chars, though, so that's some wiggle room.
---
I’m new. How exactly?
---
I’ll never kill Jeff’s, if you’re a Jeff main you’ll always get a free escape from me
---
Hold on, let me just whip out
---
S t r i d o r
---
The person that got tunnel write me
---
And this is y ur going to Heaven
---
Yeah but it just got upgraded so you don't need to pop the gen yourself and it feels incredible.
---
That is a fun gimmick. Although it really rubs in how much I wish there were co-op Killers. I've been saying since Year 1, before we even had Legion, that Ghostface should be two people instead of having a power.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEgasfRRma8 I need this to be real.
---
She kinda looks like a pissed off mom trying to get her son to take his daily calcium
---
I used the grasp to destroy the grasp!
---
Maybe, but it only gives BP up to the cap, and is something of a liability should you want to get close to Survivors. Doctor slows the game more, though, so I can see how he'd farm better.
---
honestly you shouldn't focus on the challenge at all,just pick the challenge that you consider easier and play your games normally,if you can't complete them who cares at least you got some nice bloodpoints,actually please increase the amount of bloodpoints!these challenges are like dailies 2.0 to me,the battle pass is useless
---
Nice Attention to detail very cool
---

---
This has also happened to me, but as survivor.

Thats was when I was rank 14

Good, very early doctor main so I don't have all the perks

I am not the OP.

---

---
Same but niw look how this perk is being showed down our throats
---
Thank you dude, genuinely expected some back-handed replies like "git gud nerd" But yeah when I play I stuck on one survivor often and I guess that's not her type of play style.
---
Nice catch!
---
The best streamer I’ve seen. The only one I enjoy and keep going back to. His shrine watch series is awesome also.
---
How do you guys know all the backstories? Ain’t no body got time for that
---
Spirit fury :)
---
I don't think that's the same guy as they called him with a different name 
---
(Also I'm being downvoted for saying Vigo is a girl, when literally on steam as well many consider her to be a girl for different things plus the Cutscene voice)
---
Alright, when I play her again I'll try BBQ first, and then the others. Thanks dude!
---
Hah, you activated my trap card
---
**DC**
---
I love that Feng Min video
---
you need to do more than trade hooks as killer, ultimately your goal is to stop survivors from doing gens, then after that your goal is to kill the survivors.
---
i like panda but that was not really funny
---
I screenshotted my characters levels all the time, it's 8 MIL PER p3 50
---
Jeff with the occasional bond since I prefer bond over empathy
---
cbt
---
Totem. I must *break* you.
---
That's fucking cool as shit
---
But when i unhook someone and take a hit right after, it wont give me a stack? Safe hook stack was given later tho.
---
The serums will stay until after the Rift closes (over 60 days). After the Rift closes, you’ll be given enough time to spend your Serums. Then they’ll disappear. At least that’s how I’m understanding it. Someone might correct me, though.
---
Sure thing i did!
---
Yeah plagues goal is to get everyone sick. With Thanat you benefit from them being broken(even though I still think the perks a bit weak). Also Corrupt Intervention can help you get people sick before someone touches a generator. 
---
If they cleanse they give you a big chance of a win. Usually they’ll try to cleanse across the map from you so it’s like do I sacrifice a gen or do I keep pressure on them. 
---
Most the time they’ll cleanse in the late game. 
---
But you want to try your hardest to not let it get to the endgame which isn’t easy.
---
Is it still the double bps event? If si every double bp event people turn into potatoes idk why..
---

---
Dunno if anyone has said this, but god, I’d love a bunch of new skins with the main survivors in space or deep sea outfits, lmfao.
---
But I mean it's purple ranks surely one of them just one would have done gen but no
---
Imagine the madlads that would do it back in the first year, oof, before weekly/daily challenges and even when  they WERE released it was shit like "as the wraith aupriaeattavk 32 survivors" for like 8k lol, dark times.
---
dont underestimate up the ante in an unhook build. if you combine it with a vigos and slippery meat you get 6 35% chances of unhooking yourself
---
Is that more mori's than sacrifices? Yikes if so
---
As a Scoops Steve, I am flattered and petrified at the same time
---
I had exactly this with red ranks just crouching in bushes i had no clue what was going on that match i did 3 gens max chase and died and spectsted them just seeing them crouch everywhere and sometimes tap a gen, it must be the event, im waiting for it to end before playing again because its so stupid xd
---
Ironically, I would have completed this challenge tonight. I was the only one doing gens. There was usually at least 2 being chased most of the game. 
---
I dont wanna think about the other one.
---
The main problem with all of them is completing them in one trial. That makes some of these damn near impossible. Ngl though, as difficult as they are they didn't lie about them being challenging.
---
I have just closed the chat window and pretend I’m on console. It’s sooo nice.
---
Indeed i always play dbd with the gf so atleast someone who still knows what she is doing xd, when i was new i spammed gens aswell and never hid now all you see is new people hide everywhere (understandable) but not for the red ranks xd
---
Isn't up the ante the one with chest add-ons
---
You to mate.
---
Oh no! My one bbq stack!
---
So i got tunneld camped and had a bad game. I should be punished for dc or should they change something so tunneling or camping aint posible(if the killer stay to close the the hook you wont die or if the killer only goes sfter 1 person that person is a bit faster in chases [slower then the killer but a little faster])
---
I think that you may have missed the point of the post here.

---
Dude i’m so sorry bro
---
Hide the pain, Bill.
---
*Sips* I’m not feeling so good...
---
You’re missing the point, Ebony mori is bull shit agreed, but so is an Ivory mori. Being able to kill 1 person after 1 hook can turn the whole game around. Plus it’s BS for that 1 survivor, just like when 1 survivor escape through hatch or multiple early which gives you a fat entity displeased at red ranks. What’s your rank and playtime?
---
There is no point in talking about this, if you think her base kit is fine you obi have not put much thought into it, or even considered changing your objectively wrong opinion.
---
Vomit at regular loops but just M1 at T &amp;Ls. Thanatophobia punishes people for not cleansing even more so I reccomend that.
---
List guy we need you
---
We’ve seen them since day of release, just prepare for the one legend to send the post of all the links to the same image. But I appreciate that you ask before adding to spam, take my upvote
---
In a chase spirit has no counterplay, you just guess what shes doing, spirit somewhat guesses too but she has information to work on not just pure guessing like the survivor.
---
I feel as if i seen this before
---
I wonder what the Nurse would give me after her nerfs...
---
Have we set up SWFs to cheat these yet?  There is more than a couple that just *won't happen* unless you do.
---
So like someone already revealed what they all are correct?
---
I didn't know there are rules, I thought I could down who I want?!
---
The only thing going in a week or two is the event in terms of offerings and event gens. You have roughly 70+ days to collect the serums. Plus the event skins are here to stay
---
I hate doing 4 totems and then getting hit one time in a game and dying to NOED. Shit feels like garbage even if the perk itself is pretty easy to beat.
---
200 iq xd
---
Yeah, we’ve seen all the tome 4 challenges.
---
make an excuse what you want, but in reality, you dont need an excuse to do so. you play whatever you want, even your intention is tunneling near hook which is knowing she is the one just got hook. but yeah, you dont really an excuse to tunneling. its look pathetic when u tunnel but making an excuse about it like dont know who is it ( which is can be seen at player name ) or whatever.
---
:/ he has a bit of hair xd
---
Do a doctor laugh!
---
Gate opened OR hatch closed. Last gen doesn't count as EGC.
---
I mean why tho? Im just doing it for fun so
---
Can I have the points?
---
its not connected but okay. make an excuse what you want even you dont really need an excuse to tunneling. i mean, you play whatever you want even DCs
---
I never get messaging anyone else, they will not listen to you. period. 
---
Only time maybe is during rank reset and people are genuially new and dont know things.
---
Basically you run from the killer and jump and crouch over a serie of obstacles :)
---
I’m telling you low red to grey ranks are all rank 20’s. Like I even see people that are rank 1,2,3 and they hardly have any hours and aren’t alt accounts, but they waste time crouching around the map and being useless. The pip system is broken and is way too easy, it’s too hard to lose a pip (imo)
---
yeah, survivor using perk is toxic survivor

It’s just like banter, it’s like when you’re playing a game with mates and you say you suck when you lose. It’s not toxic. People are just snowflakes
---
I got it first time - if two people use a shiny coin, there are 4 extra chests. Run Plunderer’s too. It really isn’t that difficult.
---
The survivor challenges are as such:
---
- get 6 great skill checks using the Perc this is not happening
---
- blind the Killer while carrying a survivor twice
---
- completely repair for generators using dark sense
---
- search for chests using plunderers Instinct
---
- drop a pallets to stun the Killer 4 times
---
- unhook 3 survivors during endgame collapse safely
---
- be the last Survivor to escape
---
All must be completed within a single trial.
---
The killer challenges are as such:
---
- book 5 survivors in the basement using agitation
---
- damaged generators all destroy dropped pallets 8 times using brutal strength
---
- Chase survivors for 180 seconds using distressing
---
- damage the same generator 4 times
---
- sacrifice 3 survivors during endgame collapse using no one escapes death
---
- catch the Survivor in a bear trap 5 times
---
- sacrifice for survivors in the basement
---
- catch for different survivors in bare traps as the trapper
---
All must be completed during a single trial.
---
Check comments.

Thanks, I'll definitely use this! HAha
---
Choccy milk, I haven’t heard that cursed phrase since my days of scrolling IFunny...
---
well, yeah, i dont really care about post chat, messaging or etc in this game because its not important. if other player got bad mood because crouching or pallet stun or whatever it is. its not my problem, its them
---
my friends and i will deliberately do this tot ry and confuse killers with "shadow clones" granted isnt really effective when only 1 person is injured
---
This is not true lol. Good killers always respect pallets, unless they have spirit fury/enduring
---
Why does everybody in this sub run around that omg
---
I don’t know about that though. I’ve been keeping track of announcements from there Twitter account and Thayer aren’t even acknowledging it any more. There’s a day of the dead outfit update and there post states “Available on all systems”. Shocker shocker it’s not on switch, which is concerning to say the least. I would be fine if the team say coming to switch later, there ignoring it.
---
Because she is the blueberry bitch
---
Not just that. It’s actually easy to stun good killers because good killers don’t respect pallets. You should always assume a killer doesn’t respect pallets at first and drop them early to avoid the hit. (Unless it’s a very safe pallet and it’s early in the game. In that case then take the hit)
---
This is a joke right?
---
Your name must be Karen
---
Hey I do this too, they are always the most cancerous aspect to any community.

Or in other words you have no points to make that can counter argue what I just said. Gg

Is this a kidding?
---
What in the fuck is wrong with you, and how fucking bitchy can you be lol.
---
There are plent of other valid arguments against Alien/Predator than that guys c'mon. Even if the second one was debunked by Demogorgon being added.
---
Yup!
---
Trying to do it again before dbp ends
---
I didn't know nurses calling applied when someone is picking up a survivor. Also, 5 gens lol
---
I know right? I made a tier list a few weeks ago and it felt like I put a decent amount of effort into it
---
Predator makes no sense though, they don’t kill innocent civilians! 
---
Xenomorph sure but predator hell no.
---
Preach
---
I had the same bug RN. Used the add-on with the green eggshell add-on and it didn't work. Before the patch it worked. It's actually a fun add-on.
---
He didnt actully have to break the pallet, he could just bloodlust 3
---
They could just say it's a Rogue Predator. Those are established to be a thing.
---
Same
---
I love it playing wraith with those addons that increases pallet break speed while cloacked with SF and enduring so I can confuse people into believing that I respect early but give them no chances later.
---
Nothing is wrong with me, I just do not like being recorded.
---
Had me goin' for a second there, then you hit us with that :P
---
No good fellow it is no meme.
---
This is so accurate! since the totem is always in plain sight and never hidden 10/10
---
Yeah but still it doesn’t make sense to even a rogue predators lore.
---
so, you find fun in that 2 min and half games with slug? just asking btw
---
I've been using Dying Light &amp; Thanataphobia to some success on Plague. I switch between Corrupt Intervention and Ruin depending on what mood I'm in. And usually take BBQ because information and bonus bloodpoints.
---
Seeing as people don't really cleanse against her, I try and take addons that increase the effectiveness of her Vile Purge. Or the addon that reveals the aura of anyone vomiting. I also try and keep a mental note of what gens I've vomited on. So if someone gets infected without me touching them, I'll have a general idea where they are. Failing that, Surveillance or Discordance are always helpful if I'm having a bad day with keeping mental notes.
---
If they do decide to cleanse, I won't go out of my way to get Corrupt Purge, if it's nearby then I'll go for it. If it's on the other side of the map then I'll wait until I'm close to it.
---
I essentially try and play Plague by only using her Vile Purge. Try and make them go for cleansing if possible and then punish them for doing so. But I will say she can be a fun killer but there are times when it just wont go your way. All I can say is shrug off your losses and have fun
---
And that's not a reliable way of telling when she's phasing becuase 9/10 when someone says that they fail we can jump into a swf if you want and test it and even if that's becomes a reliable way what about the cosmetics that cover some of these crystals and they're harder to see
---
If you dont hold the game hostage no, I have no idea why you care though. If your a teamate and you troll them then maybe.
---
Also dude your in public they can record you all they like.
---
P r e a c h
---
it's a meme lmao
---
No, dead serious and hard.  Streamer hate boner from me.
---
Jokes on you, I ordered a coffee the clerk forgot it and I left with my chicken tendies like a good boy.
---
They wouldn’t put children in the game
---
I could slightly agree there just make the survivor be able to react to something other than nothing
---
Are you 100% certain of this my good man
---
Yes but on top of that you have to be a douche. It’s also not that bad it’s not like you are really getting recorded and everyone knows who you are or what you look like. 
---
It’s just a damn game model and a name. 
---
But you get your panties so twisted that you have to be a douche lol. 
---
Simply if you know it’s a streamer as well then dodge the lobby lol.
---
No kids allowed remember.
---
Edit: now billy would of been awesome.
---
Plus it's not totally unlike BHVR to ignore integral personality traits of liscensed characters, Like Ash and Bill only being able to run and hide instead of fighting back
---
No your.
---
But I thought they were all hookers?
---
I do not want streamers in my game, unlike you I do not want my failures publicized.
---
U N I N S T A L L
---
What's fun about that?
---
I feel like you post that "legal" message on Facebook as your status too.
---
You mean No Mither right? It makes every instant down perk useless.
---
but DC is not toxic
---
Well it makes sense for Ash he would do both lol. 
---
But even then I just feel that’s completely different then the predator lore. 
---
Now hold on I just though of something, a predalien!
---
Prayer Beads?
---
Yeah but I would like to think if I ask a question, someone will take the time too. Nothing is solved by "get gud trash"  
---
You're welcome. I hope it helps. I only just started playing as her too a few months ago. Mostly to figure out how to survive her too. I joined the game between her, Ash, and Ghostface being released. 
---
She seemed fun and also taboo due to her power. She's fun and powerful but only if you can figure out how to adjust your playstyle.
---
You must just have really bad luck :/
---
We are in a world, controlled by an ancient entity, Where we get tortured and killed for its entertainment by killers with otherwordly abilities. Are we seriously going to question how a survivor goes down the hatch?
---
PredAlien as a cosmetic for a Xeno would be dope as fuck
---
No we don't, that's so annoying
---
I fucking love this
---
Simple solution: hide in a locker (but don’t really do it) 
---
Best solution get godly at looping so they waste time and let you win or eventually give up and let you go.
---
Okay, just gotta run by, grab my key and leave. Where the hell did this brown toolbox come from!? Least how I imagine Charity working.
---
It’s literally 1 game and you wonder how your team made it to purple ranks???  
---
You can’t judge someone off of 1 game. Sometimes you’ll have a bad game and this was one of theirs.
---
We were promised thisncosmetic before the store was even a thing and it hasn't been delivered
---
That's so oddly specific to only happen to legion. I wonder how that happens.
---
God, I just remembered I was thinking about making a meme like this months ago and then forgot. Have a slightly salty upvote.
---
She's got an offering to start with a corrupted pool. Thurs is Ang excellent add-on. I like to use this one and hold the pool until I have the match swinging in my favor
---
Lettuce pray for decisive strike
---
So dont play then, literally anyone can record you in game.
---
You can buy stuff at 10 serum.
---
I got spirits weapon and plagues body for 10 each.
---
Also there was an ingame tooltip that serum will expire two weeks after the event ended.
---
I do not have a facebook.
---
True but usually I spawn no where near pallets.
---
Or just a predalien in general. A switch between two powers. 
---
Can decide in menu if you want to attack with the predator arm blade or the mouth.
---
Watching toxic survivors getting punished always puts a smile on my face.
---
lol, maybe you got bullied by head on and want say something about it, and wrap it hidden in meme and clearly say it in title post ( why? lol ). well whatever kek, everyone have their right to post XD. but its just pathetic when u cowardly complain about it haha
---
&gt;dident
---
Hes speaking the language of the entity
---
No, I am the Rosa Parkes of Dead by Daylight.
---
Yeah I only dc when the spirit has prayer beads
---
That isn't toxic
---
Even more odd that the patch notes themselves say that current issue is that feral frenzy has a chance to cause game crashing? Yeah, I'm not even surprised.
---
Legion is so bad that they literally break the game by existing...
---
Eleven would be more powerful than the killer tho lol
---
She is sorta fun, I'll keep trying to play her. I'd also like to adapt somewhat of a Vile Purge plays tile on her. thanks dude!
---
This isn't true at all
---
¿Quieres?
---
True but my friend has messenger turned off so when we play on his ps4 it’s not an issue. (Except for salt encrusted friend requests which are just hiiiilaaarious)
---
Simple solution I learned from Fungoose. When you get to a generator look for your key points of getting out. That way you know where to go when the killer shows up. 
---
If you are in the middle of nowhere like in a cornfield that’s a definite injured position. 
---
But if you’re good enough you can run him for a long time even as a injured person and get him to quit. 
---
Get godly at looping and you are pretty much a powerhouse lol.
---
k
---
I don't see anything wrong with trolling streamers because they are always out for themselves when they play. They let other people die on the hook all the time and they are generally unpleasant to play with.
---
I actually want to see more leaks, so that hopefully BHVR realizes that they're too hard and they change them before they're officially released.
---
I don’t think it even has a sharp edge
---
*cough* Totem *cough*
---
*cough* Offering *cough*
---
Understand that what you mean is something nobody cares about
---
bannable ofc. stupid question. specially body blocking on purpose or intentionaly lose, etc. face camp teabag is not included.
---
Ah gotcha
---
Thanks!
---
I very much do.
---
Oh I've been playing this game for a while but took a super long break and just got back in to it during early September. My goal is to play every killer (except nurse and wraith cause I cba) And yeah, it seems like it'll help but it's getting late so I'mma have to sleep.
---
Maybe i dont know i just came up with it when i saw scoring event
---
Spine chill SS
---
Sadly some Killers started out randomly and they still roll like this... yet I only admire concept these days but figures.
---
It is indeed gracious to a notable degree how you have bestowed upon me this most sweet and succulent lactic product, derived from an animal of the bovine variety and flavored with the extract of the cacao plant, which melds to create a libation of the utmost quality and tastiness.
---
Probably know it but a fully charged vomit can break someone in 1 go if it all connects, or you can vomit again to speed up the broken status. Otherwise a tap and leave em, let the corruption do its thing. Better if they actually do cleanse, most games they just try to power through it broken all game.
---
this is one of the most enigmatic videos i have ever seen what the fuck is this from
---
Recently? There is that 4k challenge, which even I thought meant you just had to mori them all
---
Yesssss been waiting for this kind of meme to show up hahaha
---
Me: *hooks Laurie twice*
---
Me: *is chasing another survivor*
---
Laurie: *runs in front of me, teabags and tries to block me*
---
Me: *kills Laurie*
---
Laurie: T U N N E L
---
Other than a few exceptions, the game is pretty fucking balanced all things considered. They remove/rework those few exceptions and the game is going to be in a very good spot. The insta heal rework was a very good step in that direction.
---
Looks at tag, oh it's no shitpost. What the fuck is this guy serious?
---
Some killers think so. And anything that warrants stupid salt messages is good
---
I just noticed the bones, to see that bone marrow.
---
what is this game about? magical rpg game? this is horror game ( should be ), perk is not a magic that can be transport item or copying from an air
---
idk maybe straight up lying to other people? seems like a douchey thing to do my man
---
i mean....most people would bring an ebony here and mori them all off hook. i know i would. 
---
it's part of the mission.
---
Que?¿
---
Super duper serious.
---
You could try using corrupt intervention
---
They would remove the DC bonus for friends of the person who DC's (or should, in the case of this)
---
you know how you csn hear the spirit phase sound if its far away? beads removes that and basically gives you free gen grabs
---
I didn't know it was a crime to fight for my rights to not be harassed by some neckbeard having beanie wearing incel.
---
ok good boi
---
Aight you do you i guess. Everyone can record you though so if I were you I wouldn't take the chance and facecamp everyone, just in case.
---
I hate when that happens, it happens a lot when I often want to play Killer
---
Knitters!
---
Facecamping is not bannable, camping is discouraged but it is not bannable.  The devs stated as such.
---
Try waiting 30 seconds in a corner of the map at the start, or wait until someone gets hit then start working on a gen.
---
Yeah but I rather unlock the full outfit, it would feel odd to have one piece of different sets
---
The best build is bbq ruin enduring spirit fury. For add-ons, if you notice that at your rank people cleanse a lot, take vile emetic and devotee's amulet. If you notice they don't cleanse, use black incense and ashen apple.
---
Is that an SCP cosplay I see?
---
It was  more of a rhetorical question, it wasn't really the main point.
---
u/Ps4_and_Ipad_Lover
---
I never said that it's bannable. I said that technically everyone can record you. If you're so afraid of it maybe you shouldn't play video games...
---
Because comiting to finish a gen in 90% to not loose all the progress?
---
I thought i'm the only one facing this problem , like whaaaaat why do i need to close the game and open it 20 times to play and even worse than that the time it needs to find a match and the loading screen , and this feeling that you can't play however you want as a hunter , its all adding up to my anger
---
Sorry, I have no idea what you mean. You don't replace unwanted things lol.
---
Maybe you can use spine chill. It worked for me.
---
1. While one person is looking for/cleansing Ruin, that's 1 less person on gens.
---
2. It doesn't matter if the 4 unblocked gens are close to you, you won't be pressuring them while chasing a Survivor.
---
3. The vast majority of players, even at red ranks, cannot reliably hit great skillchecks. This slows gens significantly and more or less prevents people from ganging up on a single gen.
---
I love doing that. I was just today doing my daily’s and playing a few games and I went up to about 500,000 before I noticed my stack.
---
doesnt matter. he / she is laughing while doing that, either killed or escaped, except ranking hunter
---
clip the stream and then use a download tool to get a copy. upload a private video to YouTube or similar, submit with report online in addition to referencing your in game report. unlikely they'll do anything, but who knows.
---
Let me clarify few things for both sides.
---
You telling.
---
-Huntress having Iridescent head hatchets
---
-Not to heal when she has one as there's no point to
---
Him responding:
---
-That she has BBQ and being injured would reveal your location
---
-Begins calling names
---
I mean, gee. You can still go into locker to avoid the aura reading (even if it's not the perfect reason to avoid in such use) and then heal. Can also juke and sneak away from chases if you know what you're doing if fully healed. Otherwise most Huntresses tend to miss their shots and only attack you with hatchets or basic attacks.
---
 cool theory but bhvr always uses countries as codenames for killers. Usually there's no extra thought behind it.
---
Very meh bait just like everything else you have writen in here.
---
Rstle and I can’t figure this shit out lol.
---
Oh god the friend requests and party invites are just hilarious. I’m xbox myself and I have turned my messages off before but it’s a real pain for me as I regularly play another game that requires me to have them on, additionally when you turn them off on xbox it also affects the party so I have to turn it back on for that game. It’s easier just to leave it on for me.
---
Quick games are so satisfying to have as a killer.
---
Wasn't Chapter 13 Stranger Things?
---
Just wait that’s what I do but I am on console so maybe it’s a difference
---
Sadly he has pants :(
---

---
&gt; I'm still getting varying ping indicators in the lobby.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; That shouldn't happen with dedicated servers.
---
I'm not sure you understand how servers work.
---
Except I feel like bloodpoints cap should be 10 mil. limit. And seeing how many characters we have, obtaining normal currency shouldn't be a mass issue. Although it is Jocelyn to reach 1 mil bp, you'll still end up half way progressing character.
---
Self care can easily be replaced by just bringing a health pack or coordinating with your fellow survivors for heals. Or just not healing and doing a gen instead since that will finish the game faster.
---
Small game can be replaced by simply getting better at watching your surroundings, learning totem spawn locations, and using some basic intuition on trap locations.
---
But spine chill provides a benefit that can't just be replicated by playing better. No matter how good I get at the game, I will never be able to see through walls to know the stealth killer is coming my way. So that perk stays in my build all the time. Its not really needed on more open maps where you can just keep an eye out for the killer, but even on those maps its useful against prayer beads spirit, which you run into more and more the higher your rank gets.
---
Urban evasion has its uses, so I sometimes use it.
---
Quitters.
---
E
---
How is the mori with the pipe rather than a knife?
---
Maybe it is Devour Hope instead? 😁
---
Holy cow
---
I had a P3 lvl50 meg that I leveled up about 150 times and my quick and quiet was still tier 1
---
Looks like an anime huntress
---
It was Haunted Grounds?
---
Ahhh when will u ppl learn ffs..
---
Rank is an utter joke, nothing more, even the dumbest ones can rank up if they play consistently.
---
Good idea
---
The devs alr said they don't want hag eating little childrens.
---
Use toxic perks, like sprint burst, adreline rush, decusve strike, bond.
---
Exactly
---
Well, if there's no other reason then I don't see why not other than the fact that you would need to start from level 0 in all your characters.
---
But keep in mind, Ps4 has some optimization issues at times.
---
The need to put the real Freddy in the game and not the garbage 2010 Freddy!!
---
Yo I opened this in front of my parents. PUT THE NSFW TAG. Think of the children!
---
Full Euphoria levels.
---
I suggest you learn to speak English.
---
It’s not even a good perk it’s just fucking annoying to play against. I’d 100% rather have whispers, nurses calling, BBQ and chili, hex ruin, PGTW, make your choice, STBFL, discordance, haunted ground, enduring, brutal strength, there’s just so many other fucking perks to run that are just better and not annoying as fuck to counterplay (find all 5 totems on the map) and it just rewards the killer for playing badly. So Many fucking games where the killer doesn’t kill anyone until all 5 gens are done, they get a lucky hit or some shit with NOED, and then they facecamp or not even facecamp just proxy and then they get the kill and probably depip or safety as well but they got that one fucking kill with NOED so.
---
Dude, chill! She's a Batman fan.
---
killer and entity is different, this is their realm. but survivor mostly it is skill thing. crouching move faster, balance landing, self care, etc. but yours is whole different. teleport? jeez, even freddy need channeling doing teleport
---
Forgot Freddy’s reach
---
I came to play the game and have fun, some asshole wants to record people without their consent why should I not grief?
---
Most likely man.
---
Who is that?
---
I have a special place in my heart for Davids, specifically No Mither Davids. Will always give them hatch.
---
Just happened to me brother. Big F
---
They're worse. Lobby dodging is pretty lame but at least it's not ruining the game for 4 other people. 
---
People who disconnect are cowards, nothing more.
---
No, let me clarify. I'm still getting highly varied pings. 50~300+ ranges, and I don't mean for that single lobby either. This was essentially what I was originally getting on average before the whole dedicated server rollout. 
---
I have good enough internet that shouldn't be the case unless it's connecting me to an unstable host, or the indicator is somehow faulty.
---
r/egg_irl
---
balance**d**
---
You consented to play this game. This game consented to being recorded. It's not your real face, I hope it's not your real name. I don't know why you're making such a big deal of this
---
OOT but ok. i dont want hurt your feeling. just telling the truth buddy. if you getting scared or getting worse mental health by playing games. you should quit and looking another hobbies.
---
Reading.
---
Hatch aura is visible now?
---
Jane has mommy issues. Jeff had daddy issues.
---
I find Survivor lobby in less than a minute, but I can play Killer mostly only after waiting at least 10 minutes
---
so anyone then

he is not ready being lose in competitive game. if its not fit, just quit
---
You sound like a 5 year old, it's a game. Streamers are human as well. It's not an instant win for them if you play the game regularly
---
A survivor doesn't see through a wall with bond. A survivor uses Bond to convince the Entity to show them what is behind the wall.
---
This is no different.
---
The survivors aren't teleporting shit. They're convincing the Entity to deliver items.
---
Hell, we've already established that the Entity has no problem giving things to survivors, since that's exactly what it does in the bloodweb.
---
Someone made a comparison and gen tapping Is the same as hitting 4.2 ruin skill checks
---
Happened to me on the game too.
---
Yes, but he wouldn't be able to get it anyway because the first guy disconnected. So no reason to try.
---
It's more about entertainment. It would be hilarious to see a survivor roll into a hatch or nose dive into it.
---
Legion is good for r/dbdgonegay only
---
They probably dced because they thought you're gonna be using OP perks and they couldn't be bothered going against it so they dced.
---
Nothing about toxicity, just too much effort and a bit of unfairness.
---
What if it is Julie?
---
okay then if you dont accept critic. get well soon. god bless you mah boi.
---
Thank you!!! I hate it sometimes!
---
Might as well just hit the greats, it isn't that hard...
---
How does he have maxed sacrifice after only hooking one survivor
---
No way no one has ever seen this
---
Still good.
---
Feng Min next to you ready to dip anytime
---
It took me way too long to realize you didnt need to mori all 4 to complete that tome. I wasted like 5 ebonys before I saw a comment on here saying sacrifices counted. I would like to apologize to those 5 games yall really didnt deserve that.
---
Not only that but the production quality and acting is suspiciously similar.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Spirit and prayer beads
---
Nea and Flashlight
---
Wraith and NOED
---
Scoops ahoy Steve and his spooky flashlight
---
Or just NOED and a mori instead
---
ive had insta queue during the whole event solo survivor and killer, no idea if im just lucky or what. console red ranks
---
Edit: I reported the bug in the Dbd forum
---
Well done!
---
How does one get iridescent perks?
---
Gen grabs are probably the worst as a killer, now.
---
I played a few games as Gen Grabber Wraith, the other day. Every time I surprised someone on a gen, one second I was grabbing them, the next they were running. Always had green ping.
---
Leaving the match is something you can be reported for, just because you are a mindless idiot who can't do anything against spirit doesn't mean your team deserves to be 1 person down.
---
He wasn't a douche for killing everyone. That isn't the point. 
---
This dude was using a full meta build at low ranks with T3 perks against a team with DC, and still felt the need to slug us (even before the first hook so no Decisive Strike) and then Mori us. He played like a douche, and I say this as a killer main. 
---
Not to mention straight out lying about why he did it.
---
Did you know that if a survivor is crouched you can literally headshot them and the hatch will go right through without doing any damage?
---
Streamers take the time to record themselves gaming, I am sorry for not wanting to suck koolaid out of their assholes like everyone else.  If I want to play a game without some fat beanie wearing cunt typing its ya boi then why should I be chastised.
---
That is some genuinely good advice. Thanks ill use that
---
Then GET IT
---
I agree, 1 million is kind of a terrible cap, specially when it only got me about 25 levels.
---
I love this style
---
It's definitely good but it isn't pretty
---
Nice list and taste in music you got there :) 
---
I personally would change the plague to " pray for plagues- bring me the horizon "
---
Wait, you guys are having games that last five minutes?
---
Doesn’t look like the last 2 pistons are going yet so it’s probably not even 50% at that point lmao
---
me every time i have to kill any survivor :(
---
The servers move your hitbox back for some reason, i got so many bullshit shots with huntress after they released.
---
Nice screw driver. I prefer the lead pipe looks beter when you peform the mori on nea's
---
Ye but I wouldn't waste an Ebony Mori, would you?
---
Not a bmth fan one bit the first album isn’t bad but I give you props mate because that makes more sense I’ll change it thank you!
---
Ran BPS like 3 times tonight on killer and shit like this is why I got a nice, healthy stockpile of the things.  Even though I get tons of BP it just isn't worth the garbage *every, fucking, game* because I don't play for keeps.  Try to keep a match moving at least somewhat so that way EVERYONE benefits from it but I get BM'd to hell and back each fucking time.
---
Anyways this is from my last match with BPS and I think now I'll just hard level Billy, Nurse and Spirit just so that way I don't have to hear dick ever fucking again about this shit.  It's so cancerous.
---
**The real question is when will BHVR just allow you to hide chat entirely cause nothing good comes out of that GARBAGE.**
---
Crap, I’m a sole survivor, I will just die a lot I guess
---
You can just sacrifice them though
---
You consented to playing this game. Being on a stream is a risk that comes with that. If you don't like that you should play offline games. I still find you immature regardless.
---
oh , you should. or you will be sociopath that failure too IRL.
---
how do you do that on console?
---
i dont think they will make another free perk. new perk will come along with new survivor
---
pink claudette's healing interaction point got disjointed
---
always makes me laugh
---
At times.... every damn update is broken!
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
You're right, but I can't keep myself from having an argument with him. I just want to know what's going on in his head lmao
---
LED boi
---
I mean, there are a few circumstances where I don't blame people for dc'ing.
---
But in general, I think it's stupid af.
---
Why not? They've done it before, and doing so adds new content to the game without requiring a new character to be developed.
---
Vibe check.
---
trust me, im curious too. i think he have bad day. but his character was so bad that make me want slap him and wake him up lmao
---
You don't actually need NOED active.  Just to have the perk equipped and trigger this situation.   Honestly, this challenge is more called "Have NOED and Bloodwarden equipped, and trick them with a very late bloodwarden proc"
---
Why not both
---
Youd have to first of all deliberately let them almost win the game. Then down someone, open the gate, throw on hook , bloodwarden and try to get 2 of  them within 60 seconds lol.   Best for this would probably be with  demogorgan . 
---
Or have remember me , then down 3 people then open gate and use deerhunter to quickly hook survivors while gate is open.
---
This isn't the case. I completed the 'kill all 4 survivors challenge' with a disconnect.
---
What afford are you using? You know, for research purposes....
---
it’ll be the same button to close the hatch and such, you can only do it if they are already powered
---
Because you're epic
---
It's like Borrowed Time gives you a free pass to not get chased after you Body Block for your unhooking buddy.
---
As somebody who only plays on PS4, I’d agree to move to PC definitely if you can. The community there is way better than the one PS4 has

If you do it to where you just get down on a knee but before you "Pull the lever" or whatever with your left hand you should never get a skill check.  12 points and under per time as rhythmically and fast as you can and you'll get there.

How is the would be victim of a flashlight stun (the killer) considered toxic for trying to prevent not getting a hook an

---
Yeah you’re a douche you don’t have to explain to me I figured it out in a quick second you’re just a douche.
---
Anyone has the whole vid?
---
1 week playing the game and i dont quite understand how the perk work. so basically if the killer looks in your direction it lit up?
---
i managed to max the perk because whenever i level, this perk always shows up in the bloodweb
---
How is it considered toxic for the killer to try to defend themselves from flashlight stuns?
---
very delicious , thank you steve
---
Mods that changes colors of perks
---
This is photo-editing gold.
---
Make sure to check their level too
---
Terror radius matters, some killers what you said is true and with others it is not as you can get selfish vs bigger terror radius killers while you don't wanna fuck with the smaller ones.
---
Context is key I guess is what I'm saying.
---
Ah yes, my english bad
---
Up until you fail it 3 times on higher tier ruins \[Above Green I believe if I remember right\] therefore if you don't hit 3 great skillchecks you might as well just gentap.  Also guaranteed progress vs regression guaranteed progress will win out in a lot of player's minds.
---
Not related but I just realize his middle name is Audrey lmao
---
Killer shack stairs lol
---
Chances are if you play against Claudette, you just hit her by accident because you can't even see her. The little brown pile next to the corn plant could just be a rock as well. :P
---
I am a douche with a reason for being a douche.

It's people reading and parroting it to feel good about themselves, they wouldn't give a shit otherwise.

Its quitters, its misleading

Same same same same

“I am a douche with a bad reason for being a douche but I feel it’s completely justifiable”

as soon as you find one you can find the rest injuring them as you go then using your knowledge of where they were to find them after they're done mending to knock them down
---
\- Brought to you by that one employee that does not get paid properly and is pissed all of the time.
---
yeah thats it. rare typical people. they dont like other people happy or success. highly jealously type. if you fail, im happy, if you success, im mad. usually they dont have their own target
---
but it gives distance to get to a jungle gym tile or a rock/tree loop /s
---
Yeah no. Killer lobbies are always longer because killers make up for 20% of a lobby but way more in terms of active players.

You are filled with DEEP WOUNDS.

Survivor mains literally just want you to stand in the middle and not play the game
---
wait he only THOUGHT  that he went past him? ehh buddy...
---
Everyone would start dcing because of teammates throwing the game for 2x bp
---
Trapper already has his own them song ! ;) ;)
---
Rift Fragments you get without these challenges are pitiful. I don't see how you can get up to level 70? In 70 days like this.
---
One match should at the minimum give you 2 fragments for just playing.
---
They are? How exactly?
---
Or u get destruction points as survivor
---

---
I play off hours for my region so I wonder if it is taking time to match me on a close server.
---
Julie and Susie/survivor action? Tell me where to sign
---
Yep, nice idea. Friday the 13th had a similar system called the salt mines. Problem with it was that they were too forgiving. It was too easy to get out of. This toxic community needs harsh punishment but BHVR probably doesn't have the balls to do it.
---
Oh so that was you? - P3 Huntress on Xbox
---
Obviously i know some are just playing for fun, but I'd say the majority are doing it for the communication and information, which make the game a lot easier for them. The penalty I proposed is incredibly small, so I doubt people would care all that much. Plus of someone is playing just for fun then they shouldn't care about the penalty
---
Never had any problem with survivor’s queue until recently, where I now have to wait between 10 and 20 minutes every time.
---
Yea, it's easily one of the worst achievements out there. It requires the other side to play nice, and fair. Took me 9 games to get it. In one game I got completely outplayed, and only killed one player. In 2 the last person escaped through the hatch. And in 5 games someone disconnected or refused to leave the locker. Even me taking them out of the locker, carrying them as far as I could still resulted in them just running back to the locker.
---
Well considering the survivor queues are 15-20 minutes on average, I sincerely doubt anyone is getting that much XP in an hour.
---
Obviously I'm going to argue with people I disagree with. Where did I say that people's opinions are invalid because they aren't a red rank killer??
---
You already missed 2 jokes, let's go for 3
---
This is what I don't get..., why DC late in match or during endgame collapse?!? Even if you lost at least you get your bloodpoints for time invested...
---
Best laugh I get as a killer is survivors DC like an ass late in game then wait for post match "noob killer taunts" like he played me somehow..., bitch you just wasted 20 minutes of your life for nothing?!? I still get my points DC or without DC..., if you lose just suck it up and que next match be better...
---
I don't Dodge when I see 4 keys that's fine for me becuase you actually have to do gens to get the hatch to spawn but spirits prayer beads you need to spend like 50k bps
---
same
---
I've seen like 3 or 4 people who agree with me lol. The majority hate the idea unfortunately :(
---
I dunno how a 9yo can watch it. I'm almost 30 I watch streamers and occasionally play but get scared haha. With playing I can only play a few games until my nerves are shot and I have to play Untitled Goose Game to soothe me.
---
It sucks, but the reality is swf probably make the devs the most money, so they likely pander to them.
---
Ya but they weren't removed were they now? NOED should definitely be nerfed IMO but all three Insta-heals that I can think of definitely still exist, just weaker and less exploitable
---
Killers can pull some cheap shit, but DC'ing is always pathetic.
---
"situational awareness of a tellytubby" ah yes, when I was new and rank 20.
---
Honestly when I stopped using it I feel like after having a few rough games I got way way better at it
---
Well I'm not running anything else that I'm not normally running if you get what I mean. The ping fluctuation is differing from lobbies to lobbies, but are pretty stable when I'm actually inside any particular one. That's why it seems to be a host issue from my side.
---
Setting sail on an ocean of flavours right  now
---
I’ve always called it decisive strike
---
cause it specifices that it has to be sacrifices and not dcs or any means neccesary
---
Just run it alongside Dead Hard so you can Dead Hard if you don't get a chance to BL
---
The killer will also think you don't have DH if they see you use BL in previous chase
---
Fuck, this is so good! But the neck tho, I hope you put something on your neck to complete the look
---
Punished how? Just play another match. You would have to play another match anyway to complete the challenge
---
**IN THE NAME OF THE QUEEN, DROP THAT KNIFE!**
---
Face camping can also lead to winning easily but it's still very much a dick move, tunneling not so much but it's still pretty unfun
---
Only if you have multiple of them.
---
I know! Thank you for the compliment :)
---
So people who like playing killer are forced to play survivor to rank up?
---
everytime
---
This is literally the opposite of true.
---
Idk why you are getting down voted, 2010 freddy looks like a burnt fish
---
Seriously! Lol. I play solo, there's no way most of these will get coordinated naturally lol
---
Well as a killer main I love the idea of nerfing swf!
---
God i hope so. Most of these are going to need to be manipulated to win lol. SWF gonna be 3-man sacrificing themselves real good.
---
If you complete the first page you can see all challenges on the 4th page and only on the 4th page. It is a bug.
---
He should get his sunglasses and then become immune to flashlights
---
It's the complete other way around. Survicors take 1-2 minutes and killers take 10-15
---
Yeah I quit mostly because of toxicity. I rather just play another game and have fun. 
---
I still love the game but due to wait times toxicity and harassment it gets old fast.
---
i was helping wiht this animation
---
Do you know why swf was introduced after the Game was already on the market?
---
I think it's definitely some sort of Stephen King property. But if one of them gets in, that opens the door for the rest
---
Well? Why?
---
If I can't get back my 10 bucks playing an hour a day like they promised I have a lot of people to find and say I told you so to.
---
well it is supposed to mean the killer is camping but that has died out cause now i see people do it when im being chased by the killer crossmap. it is now more like come get me or he just wants to do something while hanging there
---
Damn, Myers gave Steve the pipe huh? Well! Better put this thought to good use! \*Unzips pants\*
---
Because lack of feedback in her animations.
---
So can we make vids why it's pure cancer to fight 4 man swf with meta perks and how to fix it? Cuz you know I always insta regret not picking a strong killer in these games :)
---
Everyone who finished the entirety of tome 1 sees it. You're one of many
---
Who can say, really?
---
New tier should unlock every 2 weeks, so you will have enough time to finish the Rift.
---
He could probably just beat up the killers instead of doing gens
---
So the loss in bloodpoints? In rank progress? In challenge progress? Ok yeah no down side to a dc at all
---
It's enough to make a grown man cry
---
Here is some logic for you (because you need some):
---
5 people playing dbd and there are 10 missions for survivor and 10 missions for killer.
---
Those 5 are friends and want to farm the achievments together so they start and after 10 matches the 4 survivor are finished and the 1 killer is finished, now they need to switch  around the killer wants the survivor missions and the survivors the killer missions. but 3 of the 4 survivor will need to continue playing this game without any reward because they are done with survivor. If it was 40 survivor missions and 10 killer missions they would rotate trough all together after 50 matches.
---
So you need to start thinking and I am a killer main, a killer main that wants to play the game instead of waiting for lobby because 50% people playing killer.
---
This means 1. You didnt think at all what you're talking about or 2. Your hate for survivors is so big that you would wait 20min for a game instead of giving them more missions or play survivor yourself
---
check mate
---
Oh, then I fear to know the results of Killer either camping them or so.
---
Noed is a teachable perk, wouldn’t quite call it common
---
hex ruin is a pain in the ass for new players and simply the best way to counter it is to power through it, run stake out so you can get great skillchecks on good skillchecks or run small game to easily find totems.
---
Tunnelling?? Oh please .... you’re all a clone of one another!
---
This logic is broken
---
I last played the first day of double bloodpoints event
---
It gets posted at least 50 times a day. Don’t worry, we know.
---
If the 3 sec cooldown matters so little then ds is a terrible perk.
---
True, but so many people still adamantly refuse to use it for “just one killer”, which is why I advocate so much for it. 
---
BK is one I’ve never actually used, but should probably consider—like you said, time is valuable.
---
Who is next in line to show us this “leak”?!
---
Hitting greats is easy actually, i stared hitting them after my first 200, i don't hit them all the time, but still...
---
Beats watching a 12 min video lol. Thx
---
Me : hook Laurie
---
Me : is chasing an other survivor and hooking them
---
Laurie : run to me and get down 
---
Me : get DS
---
Laurie : TUNNELER
---
sure there is a loss in bp, sure there is a loss in rank progress but rank doesnt really matter, and sure challenge progress can get halted for a bit but a dc makes the game into a 3vs1 which means you have a higher chance of actually winning and getting your bp.
---
Adrenaline 100%; Unbreakable, to me, is one that never works when I have it, but when I don’t, I get slugged lol
---
It's one of the easiest challenges. Just hop into another game rather than whining on reddit.
---
SB has dropped severely in the “exhaustion tiers” since the Exhaustion mechanic was instilled.
---
I’m just pointing out that your whole argument is a fallacy
---
It's redundant plus if you even get, oh I don't know... 200k from a match with a successful streak of using offerings and perks you might as well have no problem keeping currency but alas the cap is really outdated, the blood points should be updated to the point where you get perfectly enough from rituals and from the game as well. And when I even saw once we got small buff from rituals giving you more blood points than usual I was actually happy until they nerfed it back to its original state.
---
I'm rank 5 survivor I've been rank 1 just gotta suss what kind of person your against I still get huntressess looping me with raised axes and stuff haha
---
Man i wouldnt take billy seriously anymore if all you hear is someone running in flip flopa
---
all toolboxes are still the best items in the game if you know what addons to use on them. so there is still a point but there is a lot of junk on the bloodweb
---
It's not optimized well is basically the answer, a lot of games these days aren't so it's not like this is just a dbd issue. I've had to lower my settings to high because I got sick of the random fps drops, they still happen on occasion but it's not as bad.
---
saving that post for once I get to watch it with sound
---
Yea random fps drops I can handle. My entire PC resetting itself after having waited 5 minutes for a game becomes a bit bothersome after 3 tries.
---
More like a dick rip
---
Call IT what you want it's still a buff
---
How did ya done that ?
---
Thank you. No can play Freddy but Robert Englund and that is a fact. Plus, the whole 2010 movie was just terrible all together.
---
Although I'm not sold on some changes, I really like how you approached some underused and overused perks.
---
The only change that I find really unelegant is the Unrelenting one. Every perk can be used with eachother, so why would it be advisable to introduce perks that can't be used with eachother? I would go for either:
---
- Perks don't stack and it's up to the players knowledge to know which perks are useless if used together
---
- Perks stack additively, so the values are tuned so they are not busted if used together
---
-Perks stack multiplicatively, so the values tune "themselves" and returns are diminished if used together, but are strong if used separately.
---
Also, Monstrous Shrine can be wonky, as it is random. Why not gain stacks on every hook and you get better and better boosts each time? Either permanent or timed, but I like the fantasy behind the Entity rewarding the killer for really being in the "I sacrifice to feed you" wagon
---
I feel personally attacked. I main spirit and during the bloodhunt, i kill two survivors and let the other ones farm :’)
---
I had such a mad crush on Jesse as a teen.
---
This is hella amazing, will you be making more of these to sell ? Or making other killers to show us :D ? I’m truly interested, if you were selling I’d buy on Etsy for customization 💕
---
Spirit bad
---
I'm dying to see Legion cosplays added to this list. Some of the Susie cosplays have been pretty good, but I'm honestly sick of seeing dollar store Frank.
---
I still find the 2010 Nightmare to be terrible. The story, fine, just the rest was bad. Plus, the guy who played freddy was really bad. Only Robert Englund can play Freddy. I could care less if people don't agree.
---
I know, lol. That's why it benefits to play both sides
---
*150... It's getting to the point where I open the app and a fresh new post about it

Let me paint your face, or shove your head in fire..... lol

It sounds like you need to learn how to loop, and make friends with DS. Today a guy tunneled me, and you know what happened? He ended up camping me while my teammates were t-bagging at the exit gates (he deranked, and I saftey piped). This of course doesn't work against good Nurses or Spirits, because you can't loop 'em. Tunneling is horrible for killers because that means three survivors are rushing through gens, and now you have to deal with DS. You could've just downed another survivor in the amount of time it would've took you to deal with DS. Tunneling only works on survivors who aren't good at the game. The problem is you can't balance around low rank players or high rank players, which makes this game impossible to balance universally. If you camp and tunnel at rank 20, you'll probably 3-4k. Do that against good rank 1 survivors and you'll end with 1k. Once you learn how to play survivor, you'll understand that the problem doesn't lie with camping/tunneling killers, but with stupid teammates who haven't done one gen while you've been looping the killer for 3 minutes. I've played so many trials where my teammates died after they watched the killer camp me instead of doing the last two gens and escaping. That and sandbagging teammates are the only thing that pisses me off when playing as survivor. I think most of the problems with playing as survivor would go away if we had a ranking system that actually worked.

Black Ops Chapter
---
You can talk about people without sounding like a cunt and I dont even play jeff
---
I was using Prayer Beads and  Yakuyoke Amulet (trying to get the gen grabber achievement) but I don't think the addons caused this, I think it was dedicated servers or my own lag? maybe.
---
Repost
---
That's not what the source said. At worst it's still 10 seconds faster to just muscle through the gen, no tapping required. 
---
Tapping is literally doing the killer a favor. Extending the game even longer; handicapping one's self.
---
😂 I hate that I did a evil laugh after reading this. Maybe I deserve 0 karma. But uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. As much as I love balanced landing because it's such a crutch perk. I think the 10 second cooldown on the passive ability would make it balanced lol
---
Nah
---
No I reposted because there was a link showing and not the meme like I wanted. But i deleted to old post so no spam.
---
Getting hate? yes i did! because hater gone hate and hater are stupid AF. If people would rather wait 20minutes for a match instead of rewarding people who are filling their killer lobbies then the logic is lost on this community! Hell! This would just prevent survivor mains switching over to killer to quickly! but noone unstands it!!!!!!
---
Thanks! I hate it
---
Its called Smurfing. It happens on a lot of games. Xbox can't disable it because game sharing is a helpful thing for the platform.
---
Jesus some of these suck so much like the unnecessary nerfs to both survivor and killer perks such as infectious fright and BBQ. I like the idea of merging some useless perks though, like merging No one left behind with we’ll make it
---
We should get a Robert Englund Freddy head as well
---
Not sure how I sound like a cunt, but you sure do
---
Playing as killer can be stressful, because if you’re anything like me (new account), grinding necessary perks is just basically let anyone bully you when you start to get to higher ranks. I wait for lobby at least 10 minutes. Survivor is a lot faster and can be fun, especially with friends, but since I don’t have friends, and it’s either I’m grinding 180 hours (only for one survivor or a killer, mind you) legit perks or dropping the game.
---
I love your mask.
---
Seriously it’s terrifying.
---
Where did you get it???
---
I was thinking of approaching unrelenting that way because I really didn't want "Machine gun" to resurface if you remember what that was like.
---
As for monstrous shrine. I tried to be really light handed on this because I feel like those small additions to Killers can be really big depending on the Killer. 
---
For example the 5% MS? That'd a Huntress' wet dream if that was permanent. Hence why it has a limited time. This 1 minute is still really huge because Dead by Daylight matches are usually not very long.
---
I would be cool with a really small bonus for actually killing at least 1 survivor in the basement and making that permanent for the rest of the match. 
---
Like a permanent 2-3% extra movement speed or slightly/moderately faster charge speed.
---
Again, don't want to go into big values here as these small changes can possibly negatively affect Killer gameplay.
---
It’s not. I watched 5 videos yesterday that explained it. Not trying to sound rude haha. But it’s not random :o
---
I think that the BL stagger reduction should only apply when the exhaustion effect procs, an internal timing isn't necessary IMO. 
---
NOED change would remove the counterplay from it, cleasning all 5 totems is an optional objective which both allows survs to avoid the perk and gives the killer more time to play the game, actually fun!
---
Disagree with Franklin's change, point of Franklin's is to prevent survs from blinding you at pallets or to negate instaheals during chase, reducing charges wouldnt stop it and would make the perk worthless. 
---
Whispers change seems unnecessary. 
---
Infectious Fright change seems unnecessary, however the perk is disgusting on Nurse so not too hard against this.
---
Huntress Lullaby change seems pretty awful, I think that it should just not have a notif. 
---
 I dont think No Mither needs an in-game buff (or moreso shouldnt have, ruins the point of the perk) and should just gbive 100% BP post-game., 
---
Boil Over 3 would be aids af. 
---
BBQ change seems completely unnecessary, the auras have counterplay AND promote fun gameplay. 
---
Indifferent to Ruin change. 
---
Everything else seems fine to me.
---
Can you even see what you're typing dumbass
---
So buff Survivors and throw a bone to killers, got it
---
I made a joke you prick.
---
Yes, as surprising as it might bw for you,some people would rather play 1 match of killer and wait for some time than play more matches of survivor. And that is FINE. You are nobody to tell anyone what they should like or play, some poeple don't enjoy playing survivor at all, it has nothing to do with your backwards logic. So maybe try to understand that not everyone is a "low IQ hater stupid AF" and people just want to play what they like. 
---
And a little tip for next time: insulting people who don't agree with your POV is not the best way to make an argument.
---
I've been running balanced landing so much and I think a 10-second window is perfectly countering buildings such as the Haddonfield houses. Maybe make it 15 just to be safe.

* Images of characters, locations, gameplay elements and the like from other franchises that would make an interesting addition to the game (e.g. Silent Hill, The Evil Within, Child's Play/Chucky, IT, ...). These posts must be submitted as a fan-made concept, including at least two of the following things: character background story, teachable perks, killer power/ability, new unique gameplay mechanic (similar to Jigsaw Boxes, Bear Traps, ...), map concept art/layout/aesthetics.

---
Swore I've seen Shrek with how much I'm in the Swamp.
---
Buddy, you're a fucking idiot. This is hilarious.
---
Fair enough for the first 3, I don't agree but get your point.
---
No Mither's entire purpose is to make the game harder for yourself, which is why I think thematically it shouldnt have an in-game positive to it. 
---
Why do you think BBQ and Chili is too good? It grants bloodpoints and promotes fun gameplay; leaving the hook, not tunneling, not slugging and discourages survivivors from Urban Evading on the opposite side of the map. Do you think it's too good because it's so popular? Coulnd't the same argument be made for Enduring, Adrenaline or Dead Hard? It improves the game experience massively, but it is not oppressive nor overpowered IMO.
---
People will calm down about doing challenges in one go once they realize they have plenty of time to get the rift done before the next tier opens.
---
The only thing I would suggest atm is that for the unhook one, if you do an unsafe hook it should actually subtract progress instead of not counting.
---
No, they’re just strangely more rare than ebony

I dont get why would clown add a vhs tape into his tonic lmao

That’s weird,thanks for sorting by new.
---
I really want to bring Moris but Ebony Moris make the game incredibly boring,especially when you get them almost every 2 Bloodwebs.
---
At least she tried
---
Wright
---
I prefer legion but you have a point
---
The game gives you more points if you dont tunnel?
---
I think it's too good because it gives you so much information altogether. It shows you where everyone that is not saving is and borderline lets you know that someone is in your radius trying to go for the save or is just hiding in a locker.
---
Now the thing with this "Promoting fun gameplay" is that people don't actually do it. A lot of people don't even use all that information and still slug/tunnel/camp.
---
Except Mori quests do exist. I got one the other day to kill with the Demogorgon by my own hand.
---
It's just because I see that people often put NSFW in the Hag's Mori.
---
Me too. I've literally had 5 games in a row on badham yesterday.
---
Small game is really good for the challenge, i got it in 2 games
---
I think it appears when only 2 people are left.
---
Don’t know why it spawned there so late.
---
Omg same everygame since rift has been badham
---
It’s random, you got lucky.
---
My favorite part of this meme is that the burj Khalifa is the first building, not the eiffel towrr
---
The famous killer rule book by killers as opposed to the killer rule book by survivors.
---
It is also noted in that same chapter of the book that the presence of one or more scoops Ahoy steve automatically give the killer the right to use the most toxic build possible for whoever his main is.
---
Can confirm. Am a Doctor main myself.
---
Apparently that's to differentiate "the equivalent of 4 generators" (work 400% worth of gen progress), and it actually means "complete a generator". You can TECHNICALLY complete that one by tapping the ends of 4 different gens + nothing else, ALLEGEDLY.
---
That makes it a lot more reasonable, especially if your team are willing to 99 generators for you.
---
Pig- Pig Destroyer song
---
Thanks for the insight.
---
&gt; Haha, get it guys? Survivors are BAD! All they do is complain! Complain complain complain, all day, always complaining about how bad killers are! All killers can do these days is stand still in a corner otherwise survivors will complain about them! Survivor rulebook, am I right guys? Haha!
---
&gt; but don’t use DS or play in a SWF or I’ll get upset and post about it on Reddit
---
thanks mom
---
You'll always get some asshole survivors. But you'll definitely get more survivors who just GG at end game or chat with you about the game.
---
I find his ability fun to use. Yeeeet
---
BBQ helps the killer not proxy camp the hook as it gives them a new target to find, it’s actually a healthy perk, unless if you wanna get camped as a survivor?
---
To be fair bhvr worked on monsters inc
---
Thats why it shows up there
---
He wouldn't. That's because this meme is stupid.
---
BUT why? I am a killer main! I think its a great idea! Binding survivors longer to playing survivor instead of playing MY favourite role: killer! As a killer I am not losing anything because there is still the killer path that I can play without touching survivor ever!!! Its just keeping survivor longer in their role! Please tell me where I am wrong?!
---
I still dont understand the hate for scoope steve, this is why your bitch ass isnt swimming in an ocean of flavour with steve "the hair" harrington
---
Not necessarily, nurse isn’t gutted.
---
&gt; The Hatch will spawn in a randomly selected location on the Map at the very start of the trial and remain invisible and non-interact-able to both the Survivors and the Killer.
---
&gt;
---
&gt; The Hatch will become visible ("spawn") whenever the number of fully repaired Generators IconHelpLoading generators.png exceeds the number of living Survivors by 1
---
Source: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hatch
---
Jokes arent supposed to be funny you clown
---
You can do that without BBQ &amp; Chilli though. Do you really feel the need to proxy camp when you do not use that perk?
---
I personally believe that's just an excuse altogether. It's harder to find people when you do not see their aura.
---
Didnt say Nurse was gutted.
---
They give bloodpoints based on hours played I think
---
Not true. Every time a killer respects a pallet, they run the risk of allowing the survivor to get another loop before they throw down the pallet. The only time this is correct is on really unsafe loops like on Lab or Badham, as you can likely hit them even if they do drop.
---
I have two so not that I’m aware of I barley get ebony ones I think it’s probably lower on the bloodweb I got mine from 24-27.
---
It's location is set during map generation (I think) but it only appears when a combination of gens are finished and survivors killed
---
Infectious fright is mainly used to tell you where crouched people are so you know if people are gonna come for a flashlight save/bodyblock. 
---
People only really use BBQ for the bp anyway and it’s easily countered by climbing into a locker or running towards where the survivor was to be out of BBQ range.
---
Want me to make the opposite version if that meme ?
---
I sometimes have Small Game on as I'm already looking for Ruin every game anyway. Might as well cleanse every other totem too.
---
But you haven’t seen MY level 4 archives.
---
I know but nurse was at the top and they nerfed her fine. They could do the same with spirit.
---
Makes it funnier anyway he has achieved comedy
---
 infectious fright is one of the best perks on Plague.
---
Infectious fright and BBQ are necessary to killers nowadays.
---
I don’t think that nerfing those perks is necessary,because BBQ is a pretty balanced good perk.
---
Ruin on the other hand is OP at lower ranks when people don’t know how to loop,and with the current matchmaking its hell.
---
I’m sure you’re fun at parties. 
---
Who am I kidding? You don’t get invites.
---
Or waiting in a queue for 20 minutes and then a lobby for another 10 because people like you lobby dodge only to have someone dc while loading and half an hour of your life is wasted and you wonder why you have the game installed
---
But me and you both know that BHVR is just going to do something that will gut her power. It isnt as simple as removing a blink charge you know
---
Yes actually I do feel the need to proxy camp when I don’t have bbq on, as it may waste my time to go try and go on the other side of the map to check on a gen and find out that no one is there. If I don’t have a new target to find, what’s the point in leaving? So no it’s not an excuse, maybe play a game wo BBQ on Ormond or any large map and you’ll find out what I mean.
---
I know it was comic xD
---
 but still shud help a fella when u can right?
---
Ok, fine grandma, maybe just a little bit, but only tier 1, ok?
---
&gt; survivor mains will not need to switch to killer to quickly
---
And killers need to switch to survivor a lot more. Pros for some people, cons for others.
---
&gt;more missions in a tome means more bp and those new shards
---
The split has nothing to do with how many missions we have, you can make a 70-30 split with the same amount of missions, or you can also add more missions for both killers and survivors. WTF is even this point.
---
&gt;there IS still the killer path so a killer main would not need to play survivor to reach the end of it
---
Then killers will be disadvantaged because they will get a lot less Bloodpoints from the Archives. You also need all challenges to get lore.
---
&gt;if the queue times are still to high for a killer he can switch to survivor just to play the game and STILL get rewards
---
You can do the same now, and again, some people don´t care for higher queue times, they just want to play what they like. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
---
&gt;this could help killer mains to try out survivor if they WANT because killer is the most favourite role and killers queues are by fare more then 20% as it should be if everyone want a match instantly
---
Many people have already tried the survivor role and don´t like it, or vice-versa. Killer is not the most favorite role, it´s just skewed because of the 1v4 game. 
---
&gt;NOONE IS FORCED TO DO ANYTHING but it give opportunities!
---
Yes, you are forced to play each role if you want the lore as well as Rift Fragments, which means Killers would have a much harder time getting Bloodpoints, Rift Levels, as well as Lore.
---
You simply don´t get it, just give up. The way it is now is fair and forcing people to play more of one role is not good.
---
This
---
No, it’s fine. There’s just a lot of memes that basically boil down to “survivor r bad,” on this subreddit, despite the fact that both sides have their faults and “Killer Rulebook,” is just as applicable most of the time.
---
And did it say you need to kill more than one survivor with Mori? 
---
Spoiler Alert: It did not.
---
Both of those perks give you an incredible amount of information, especially when playing a Killer with a regular if not bigger terror radius.
---
Infectious fright especially promotes an incredibly boring and dry playstyle because saving each other because redundant to survivors, which is not good.
---
On top of that, the perk has no counterplay other than lockers. And being in a locker again means that you cannot help your fellow survivors.
---
I am perhaps biased because I've been using BBQ ever since it came out but I think it is too good. The powerspike of having vs not having it is incredible.
---
Related tip since you likely don't know it due to not knowing the drop button already: As killer, it's a really good idea to just drop the survivor you're getting swarmed while carrying someone to a nearby hook. Dropping gives them wiggle progression, but you can often easily drop someone, get hits to clear out the survivors, then return and pick-up and still make it to hook.
---
SPIRIIIITTT! REMOVE THAT CANCER!!
---
Any killer can "tunnel" you. You lost me when you made that argument.
---
You say that but last time I encountered a Nurse that used infectious fright she ended the game within a minute because there was nothing the team could've done against it.
---
Yes I know it’s not as simple as that. 
---
Taking off prayer beads is all they really need to do. 
---
But if they where keen on doing more. 
---
Then 1. Make it obvious when she’s phasing (but let’s be honest that would suck) or 2. (Make it to where she can’t bump into players as in she’s an actual spirit). 
---
Even those 2 changes combined could mean more counterplay to keep people happy.
---
For me this doesn't happen anymore since dedicated servers got added
---
It has his cum on it, stronger effect
---
One bob = bow, two bobs = thank you / hello / I need healing, 3+ = teabag.
---
I only use it for the BP to be honest it’s not really that useful otherwise.Infectious Fright is probably my favourite perk out there and can be countered by just being behind the killer while he is busy.I think it is probably the most balanced perk out there.
---
Claudette#3:You took everything from me
---
Me who circled the map: I dont even know who you are
---
Let's be real here. How often does anything original pop up on this echo chamber of a sub? Pretty much everything here is a repost/generic cosplay if it isn't original art.
---
Tunneling is not fun, true and most of us will agree. But you do not have to try keeping the game fair. It is not your fault that the developers made the game as it is and you are able to use everything in the repertoire. Sure, using red addons, camping, tunneling make the game pain in our backs and most of the times dont show the true skill of the player but it is in the game and we kinda have to respect it. You can bitch about it in the chat but dont force this survivor rule book onto the others.
---
Edgy, makes people bleed, run fast, many models to choose from
---
Cool design, weak power
---
power has its uses tho. mostly spreading the damage and getting STBFL stacks
---
It’s the thought that counts
---
That's why I prefer Skyrim
---
they want the bonus points for you dying on the hook
---
Why didn't this one get removed lol, ? Rule8 rule8
---
Probably the one where you have to heal 2 (or more) healthstates on any Survivor using Emphapy(?). This can also be done healing yourself, but that would require you to get hit twice, escape, then either have Selfcare or a Medkit, so healing others is much easier.
---
Unless they DC like in OPs case, ofc
---
Might sound like it, but I main killer at the moment. I always feel like a dick when I sacrifice all four survivors while there are 2+ gens still to complete. And I get many +reps for fairplay while still 4k-ing very often.
---
When I play survivor however I often encounter killers who tunnel after Teammates are farming someone of the hook. And I don't bring DS because even after the rework I hate it whenever I play killer. 
---
(around rank 5 on both roles btw and I think the ranking system is fine. It's the matchmaking that sucks)
---
***Haha, oink!! Boops the snoot!!***
---
Sad to be a Pig main because of these people.
---
And that is what we call a crutch perk. However, maybe it is also on the developers for a number of reasons. Sound occlusion being one of them. It's been a while since I've genuinely found someone by their breathing sound effect.
---
I go more by checking generators and reading the flow of the game when I do not use BBQ.
---
I see you managed to modify my pack as you wanted
---
Glad it's working fine
---
I wouldn't have noticed it's you Nymphia if not the blue icon
---
I dont like the idea of removing pray beads especially when another purples are just as strong. Im okay Collison removal. I say they should make prayer beads red and change father's sunglasses to purple.
---
fuck
---
honestly this is gonna turn into a farm fest. Killers will be dming their survs trying to organize challenges and whatnot every other game
---
Is that Kaid from rainbow 6?
---
Tea please.
---
What the fuck
---
And knowing Robert, he’d be 100% down to do it too
---
fair point, but if natalia *seems* to be a bit concerned about the pic (according to some other posts) why would it be so hard to just take down the pic?
---
They could simply not all be around the killer when she chasing...spread out more.
---
Infectious Fright is a counter to all those bold altruistic survivor groups that want to hug the killer all the time. Spread out, do gens, come for the hook later, and you can counter Infectious Fright.
---
An interaction I had:
---
Me: gg
---
Survivor 1: yo why couldn’t you let me go at the end?
---
Me: wdym
---
Survivor1: Yeah you used that stupid hex and knocked us all down.
---
Survivor 2: Which hex?
---
Survivor 1: Idk the one with the exposed effect.
---
Me: ye and I killed you all, so?
---
Survivor 1:YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO LET US GO!
---
Me: y
---
Survivor 1: BECAUSE IT WAS THE END!
---
Me: Why do you expect the killer to be nice?
---
Survivor 1: Why wouldn’t they let us go!?!
---
Me: Hint, it’s in the name.
---
Silence
---
Ah yes. That one person who screams on rant page. I even said that i may be wrong. So if you would stop be incredulous, that would nice. I dont think she has full control over the survivors. They can still do actions and they can easily out smart her. As for the audio stuff, Im quite aware it is a big part of the game but this is you assuming everyone is good at listening. I didn't defend lrayer beads i offer a way to counter it. So mister, you are probably gonna respond in an asinine way but i welcome you too. You are probaly a higher level survivor who thinks you know how everyone plays the game. I cant change that but i can offer what ive experienced.
---

Please ask before reposting! It is just common decency!

What let you do that to him? (I don't have demogorgon, so thanks to whoever lets me know)
---
You hate him because you made a bad move...
---
Since DBD is a pretty unbalanced game, it depends on your POV of the game IMO.
---
If you're playing the game to win and maximizing your chances of that, do what you want, but don't be surprised if all 4 survivors hate you for it. Applies to survivors as well if you're doing shit like SWF + Haddonfield + Unbalanced Landing.
---
If you're playing the game to have fun (and so survivors don't have a miserable time), then you leave hooks, don't tunnel, and don't use OP shit that makes the game unfun. If you play both sides, it's not that hard to figure out where the line is.
---
The truth, IMO, is that DBD is not that competitive of a game. In something like Dota, League, CS, etc., the game is balanced around playing as hard as you can and player mentality is analogous to playing professional sports. In DBD, the game is NOT balanced around competition, and is analogous to playing a sport in high school/junior high. If you're playing in a way where you're the only person in the game having fun, you're an asshole. IMO.
---
Wheres the second picture?
---
the "start trial healthy" is such a stupid one. In the combos where No Mither actually contributes, you WANT to start injured, ie. getting to use dead hard vs killers with 1-hit downs, having resilience without having to go out of your way to get injured etc. 
---
Otherwise debatable, but I definitely disagree with that idea 100%
---
C h o c c
---
That's not what I mean. You're missing the point.
---
The point being that I want infectious fright to have counter gameplay. Because as it is right now it's just a "Hey I dont want to deal with anything group related in my Killer games even though theres already a million ways to avoid pallet saves and flashlight saves"
---
Ghost Face is the more sneaky one, but limited to one person at a time. he can also get taken out of his power
---
Myers is more terrifying and once he gets rolling, everyone's in trouble
---
lack of oxygen
---
It depends, if you only tap then chances are you will be able to regain the distance quite easily.
---
An actual captain is always welcome tho
---
First of all you think that sprit is well designed wchich is so wrong. You cant say that something is well balanced cuz its"guessing game"(which is entirely wrong btw). See games are designed to be fun for both sides. And people tend to get better at games but since the spirit came out (which was over year ago) i have never seen a survivor nor did i hear about one who can play well against spirit. "Guessing game" shouldnt be base of the game cuz its simply no fun. Lol. People dont like things that cannot be countered cuz they feel simply helpless. I mean shes the killer who runs faster than sprint burst and is invisable but simultaneously can determine your exact position by simply hearing things or bumbing into you (which is fun btw) and say just walk forehead or use iron will. Talking about iron will none killer power should be counterable by using perk. And walking yes walking yes i could walk but right when she looses track she comes out of phase and can catch up to me cuz i lost so much distance by walking. Oh and dont forget about cool "mindgames" it is really not a mindgame when you just stand still see mindgame is when you perform some action in order to make opponent think you would do something. But standing still and not being able to determine where you are at a time makes you unpredictable ( and its not really your work more like poor thought game mechanics) and its just not fun and there is no outplay in it. Only skill you acquire is determining where survivor is based on the sound so no there is no thinking based event.
---
Btw nurse is well balanced now the obly thing that was changed in her base kit lets survivor get a little bit breath during a chase and i mean time to react and dont even try talking add ons old ones cuz only loosers who dont wont to develop and play betterr used it. What is with people who just want to win instantly its  not like you play for 400 hrs you re good. It takes Time and rank one isnt grandmaster
---
This was YOUR fault lol
---
I mean our killer was spirit lol. But even if it was a wraith you'd easily see an outlining of the killer.
---
idk if this is made up, looks cringy, and like over reacting for comedy's sake, but survivors are capable of saying this shit on the post game chat, so ill never know.
---
Would a wraith show his outline a bit if he was there though? Like hes not completely visible when moving.
---
The Spirit is ok, but sprayer Bread no
---
Yeah I guess it is dumb for starting healthy, but I still feel like there needs to be an actual reward for hindering yourself that isn’t three worthless bonuses
---
You guys always says to not cleanse, but when you don't cleanse when your entire team is broken, Plague always find them, and there is always 1 person on hook, you might want to get sacrificed, because at this moment of the match she will find you and hear you puking.
---
Honestly I feel like they need to tighten up the hitboxes on killer swings, and find a way to get rid of one hit downs.
---
Hillbilly: he can run across most maps, he can have his one hit down after a certain amount of distance traveled, if he uses it in a small confined area he suffers a longer recovery penalty if missed and 25% more than his standard swing on hit (in confined area). If he one hit downs them he suffers no additional penalty unless missed.
---
Cannibal: his chainsaw charge time is the same but it gives him faster attack speed, his standard m1 is 25% slower than other killers.
---
Michael Myers is fine as is, but should start from level 1 Everytime, with the chargetime decreasing with every gen completed. 
---
One hit downs should only be on extremely rare add-ons.
---
Spirit will get a nerf some day. Behaviour will rework every killer when they got the time for it. Its about balancing a game they cant balance at all. Behaviour is trying to fix little things overtime to make it fell fair. I just cant be. This is how it is. When they will rework spirit, they cant buff her for sure. Spirit is great at this point but she requeres a lot of skill to be used right. I think they will prob change some addons when they rework spirit. Spirit fot many good addons. More good addons then the most killers. They prob will increase the ability reuse timer in the future also.
---
No, because no red light and no terror radius are scary :(
---
I can be "an asshole" by playing the way survivor wants me to, that's the point of my statement. Intentionally playing so that survivors have more chances will net you a shitload of BM, playing to maximize my chances of winning by playing scummy will net you a shitload of BM.
---
Doesn't matter how you play cause you're not playing the "right" way anyway.
---
It does have a counter, don’t be in the killers terror radius or run calm spirit
---
I was trying to be slick
---
It's not required but having evidence is never a bad thing may aswell submit that too, gonna make a ban more actionable for customer service 👍
---
Forgot to add there Freddy's Lunge at a window.
---
How do you explain this to your teacher and what's happening? I like it as it's a neat little stop motion, but I fail to see how this would function as a school project
---
When I see this I'm just glad I dont have to worry about getting snuck up on for a few seconds while working on a generator. Yeah I'll get you but let me get some stress free time on the genny
---
Samination you know what you have to do now!
---
Because the Legion rework was just a band aid while the Nurse rework actually had a lot of thought put behind it.
---
On large maps cleansing is really good tbh. 
---
The spawns of the pools are 90% on the edges of the map and if you manage to complete a generator in the same area, the plague now has to run to a dead part of the map to get corrupt purge and loose approximately half of it until she gets into another chase.
---
yeah I think it should give you 100% bonus BP post-game. But I don't agree on giving it a bonus that affect the match itself because that goes against the point of the perk.
---
&gt; The way it is now is fair and forcing people to play more of one role is not good. 
---
playing more of one role? SO the game is 1v1? no its 4v1! If there are 40000 people playing overall but because of tome they are divided in 20000 killer lobbies and 20000 survivor means at the end that 15000killer will wait in a empty lobby
---
&gt; Then killers will be disadvantaged because they will get a lot less Bloodpoints from the Archives. You also need all challenges to get lore.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; much harder time getting Bloodpoints, Rift Levels, as well as Lore. 
---
Killer will be disadvantaged? its not a competition lul. If a killer main was doing only his path in the first place he it will have no effect but if you tell me that YOU will do both paths then you need to google the missions for tome 4 because if you are not in an 4men SWF its impossible to complete those challanges. So your plan about 100% everything will fail at the end anyway.
---
Or lets make a compromise: make the survivor missions 4 times as long: instead of unhocking 5 people it will be 20. DO you like this more?
---
Let me ask you one question: What would you do if everyone who is playing dbd would be exactly like YOU? Everyone would queue only for killer! What would you do?
---
Also watching that video over and over again he most likely heard the locker open mate. 
---
The guy has got some good headphones.
---
Probably blood warden, noed, and a fuck ton of luck.
---
If we open our Official Survivor Rulebooks on page 261, rule 1238, we'll see that that's exactly the case.
---
Yikes. That's the same kind of thinking as "Uh, just run iron will against Spirit."
---
BREAK IT ALL DOWN!
---
This is why I give scoops Steve hatch, I want to be swimming in an ocean of flavor with Steve.
---
So essentially, you are saying she not fun to play againsg because she has to many bonuses. Got it. Second, the nurse is balanced? We are talking about the same killer we can end a chase in like 20 to 30 seconds right? Even after the nerfs? Keep in mind Spirit can probaly use her power once in a chase. Prayer beads should be made inti an untimate offering. I find it funny thiugh how once the op nurse finally got touched, people move on to spirit. And when spirit get touched then everyone will bitch about billy. Nothing is ever going to be enough.
---
I love the right pumpkin.
---
And thats a pretty awesome costume too!
---
All offerings won't affect the caps during a trial.
---
Example :  You gain 10k  BP during a trial.  
---
This 10k is your base, from where the bonuses will apply.
---
If you have 4 stacks of BBQ, it adds 100%   so   10k more.
---
If someone else used a BPS, it adds another 100%  so another 10k.
---
If you used an offering of +50% brutality, and you did 5k in brutality, it will add another 2,5k
---
Hope that help.
---
Because some people want to complete the archives entirely. And being forced to play survivor for more than half of that is tiring amd would just annoy people. Especially for those who want to finish it for the lore or rift fragments. With a 50/50 you can finish half playing your preferred role and then just another half of a role you might hate playing, instead of playing 1/4 of your preferred role and 3/4 of you hated role.
---
Also it won't necessarily increase queue times. Since most killer mains trying to finish archives might be rank 20 as survivor. So killers of higher ranks would still have long queue times.
---
Hope this all makes sense. I'm not the best at explaining things ^^'
---
Had a david killing himself on hook the second he got hooked. He ran no mither
---
No. Mejor no.
---
You keep them.
---
Father will decide your fate.
---
stop playing at rank 20
---
1. What do u play 
---
2. What rank 
---
Personally I always play trapper even in red ranks and it's not very easy
---
Well that’s too bad, it’s time to say goodbye. 🔫
---
This is that Tower in Dubai (not gonna tell the name cus I would spell it wrong) not the eiffel tower boyyyy
---
Yikes.
---
Once you get past rank 16 it takes skill from there
---
holy shit with some makeup i would be convinced that it was just a scene from the movies!
---
Add lightweight too
---
I play both and I still believe having 4 stuns each being 5 seconds long available is a bit much.
---
That starts about in the green ranks
---
Thomas the tank engine wants to ask what bullshit this is
---
OH NO!
---
Trapper is like poker. You place everything right holding all the right cards in your hand but someone just played a royal flush and u lost big time.
---
Trapper usually wins in 1 moment where either u big brain or they smol brain
---
I didn’t know Jane had a comma in her name
---
Dude rank 20 is the lowest rank!
---
As a survivor main I ask why? We just want to play the game ;-;
---
Nice job keep up the great work
---
This has to be fake right
---
I would main Quentin just for that
---
You play prayer beads spirit. You cannot say anything.
---
I prestiged spirit twice and while playing as her I realised how unfun and bullshit playing against her is and it just made the game boring because there was no challenge as the competition just disconnects as soon as they hear the sound of glass and bone cracking.
---
Every Nancy
---
I mostly play survivor, as I pretty much exclusively play with friends, and, man. Killers really shouldn't bother with what survivors think or say post-match.
---
Every survivor uses a combination of Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, Dead Hard, Self-Heal, Proove thyself, Decisive, etc. but if a killer uses NOED (and I HATE this perk with all my passion) he gets flamed to shit.
---
that's my main issue: I already have more than I could use unless I spend all day playing DBD across multiple characters
---
If you think spirit (base kit) is a free, EZ win every time then you're not worth talking to honestly. These people just want every killer to be mouse 1. (I'd respect them a lot more if they'd just say that TBH)
---
Prayer beads are OP though
---
What rank are you, what killer are you playing and how many hours do you have on this game? 
---
Killers are easy as fuck in the lower ranks and become much harder when the survivors actually know what to do and work as a team. Playing Killer in red/purple ranks is quite hard.
---
There was no rework for nurse the "nerf" did fuck all to me the only nerf that has hurt me is dedicated servers messing with my blinks. The legion rework was bc he was utterly trash
---
My guy, get out of rank 20
---
Just search chests
---
I especially love the trapper!
---
Had a friend prestige Nea twice before getting Balanced 3. The most tragic sight I've seen.
---
At least u aren't playing the swamp for the 10th time in a row
---
Plague cleansing bad
---
LOL fucking invisible :D
---
But i didnt ask for PoV. The post is a rant. Your the one giving your opinion. I dont remember asking for one. And it is in your right to dc. Just know youre an a$$ for doing it. Regardless. Its in YOUR opinion spine chill is  to useful which is incredibly incorrect. You are basically saying, Having a sensor on when the killer is looking in your direction that you cna use to tell if they are coming to you or not, is not useful enough. You telling me that knowing the killer is coming bepfre the terror radius hits is not useful enough? Sure the speeding up part is useless but it has confirmed man gens ans totems for me. Spine chill is an integral part of my consistent escapes. Maybe you should try gen tapping against Spirit? If you do dkr ruin you can do it for killer, yeah i know you can remove ruin but that still does discount the strategy and like i said, you really only lose 10-15% efficiency cause no skill checks. And it is not that I cant accept criticism, the fact is if im checked i will check back.
---
Use no mither + object of obsession the ultimate combi
---
i definitely agree with WGLF changes as there is no secondary feature, just BPs
---
Rip
---
They look amazing in the loadout screen! Especially when you play with all 4 colours it's fantastic :) thanks again for making the templates!
---
And I wouldn't worry about replicating the bug, i'm 99% sure it's from a desync in the dedicated servers or some of my aussie lag. Luckily it went away after I phased again so it was probably a one off.
---
Yeah thats what i meant.
---
It's always fun to down a T-bagging survivors, especially at the gate.
---
Yes fake
---
Trapper is in a good place, and can even be relatively OP with his pink addons.  
---
He's maybe the only killer that can turn a shitty game into a really deadly one, just because with one good trap, things can go from 0 to 100 reallyyyy quickly.
---
Yeah i’m the same. I have over 40 on my P3 Nancy, over 30 on Myers and another 30 on Ghostface because i’ve played a lot over the past 5 days.
---
It is a bit much but that shouldn't cause the perks effectiveness to be a complete RNG roll.
---
Having a secondary negative effect such as broken, reduced action speed, etc would likely be a better fix as it still allows consistency.
---
Same here. Red rank survivor and purple rank killer. 10 minutes for survivor, 30 seconds for killer. The tables have turned haha
---
DCs just make 4k's easier :*
---
The best way to counter it is to practice landing greats.
---
remember about the input lag and focus. You'll learn it rather quickly
---
Also criticism and patronizing are two different things. You just want to be mad to be mad.
---
Seen this bug some many times on this sub. Jesus
---
Epic gameplay: Hold M2, walk forward, yoink!
---
In case any of you were wondering, this is from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/drdmkh/just_a_recent_photo/) in r/rainbow6. I saw it and could only see Bill.
---
Thats your experience, that doesnt happen much for me. Because you feel someway doesnt me we all.
---
That explains why killers go after me...crap
---
Just gen tap
---
You should watch the video 'Why people hate the spirit in dead by daylight' by OhTofu. He explains it very well and also says why spirit is less fun to go against than a nurse.
---
In the lore, the explanation is that you are meant to entertain the entity. Entity is not entertained by efficiency, quite the opposite. You are meant to drag the match out, make it last long, give survivors multiple chances. This will be reflected in the points you gain. Efficiency is not just discouraged, but punished.  
---
I know it sounds silly, and it kind of is. The devs try to cover their design flaw and people who play both sides and know how annoying being tunneled is often go along with it as Killer and purposely play less efficient than they should.
---
Which why they should be red not purple
---
Slugging's more controversial because there are circumstances where slugging is fine and other circumstances where it's annoying/unnecessary, imo. It also has a lot to do with whether your mentality is playing to win, no matter what, or if you're playing to have an enjoyable game for yourself and others.
---
If a a killer is mid-game and down someone and immediately switches to a nearby survivor (as in your example), that's fine imo. It's just good pressure. Though it's notable that if this is happening when playing Nurse/Spirit or because you downed the unhook and didn't want to risk a DS.....don't be surprised if the survivors hate playing you when you make the game un-fun.
---
If a killer is end-game with two survivors and downs someone, then starts hunting the last survivor to deny the hatch and any possibility of the last man escaping....that's trying prettty damn hard and is annoying because it delays ending an already won game. The last survivor has very little chance of winning in most slugging circumstances, and you should fully expect both of them to be annoyed with you for dragging the game out. I actually used to do it when I was hyper-competitive about the game, and still do when I want to punish a Blendette / Immersed survivor who sandbagged their team. Or a toxic survivor. Otherwise, I just hook and give the last man a chance.
---
If a killer is running a slug build....I just don't want to play vs that. It doesn't matter whether the build is strong or not, it's just an not enjoyable to play against.
---
Well yeah, that's why I tried to advocate towards a wiggle increase on demand for the non-obsessions.
---
Nice try SWF Claudette no real killer would post this!
---
Yikes a perk has a counter to another perk wow so crazy right. It’s like saying discordance doesn’t counter nurses because it’s token based
---
Get good with those killers then, either that or you're boosted by spirit and actually deserve to be at a lower rank.
---
Look, I paid money for that cat sweat and baggy pants
---
By mind game do you mean stand still and force the survivor to guess a 50/50?
---
🙃
---
Get out of grey ranks and then come back to us with your feedback.
---
You mean the same guy we copied his vid from another youtuber and got more views? Yeah i watched it. And i debunked his reasonings. Also i would cite someone who plagiarized their content from smaller youtubers.

That single statement you just said completely disregards your entire post/comments because “you feel someway doesn’t mean we all”
---
The 2010 nightmare was awful, Freddy has like no personality other than pedophile. I miss the Freddy that would make shitty puns off what he did or make stupid jokes to respond with
---
A wiggle increase is completely useless when the perk is used as intended as you will likely be near a hook when you get downed anyway.
---
Well yeah but if the survivor is fucking dumb they will just keep running
---
Youd know if it was wraith fucking with them this just seems to a be a bug
---
Those exist?
---
Because probably behaviour trying to encourage more people to actually play both sides and experience the game 100%? Like geez play both sides everyone
---
I don’t think they’d do that for lore reasons she has something from her mother and something from her father in her red tier because one is what angers her most and one is what saddens her most both fueling her overall fury
---
in a multiplayer game, what the server/host says is what happened.
---
What the client thinks happened isn't always the case.
---
So just slug survivors until it’s their time to be hooked
---
Buf it doesnt tho. This whole post is based around this idea. Are you just gonna keep talking circles?
---
Every time I play against spirit, it's not one single mind game, it's just guessing. Let's say I get chased and I see spirit phasing right behind me and there is a pallet right in front on me. I have 2 choices: I drop the pallet from the side she is coming or I drop it from the opposite side. It's literally a coinflip. Continue play spirit, she looks cool and all that but accept that she has no counterplay. And no perks are not counters to any killer, you can't choose perk during the game, and choosing a perk just to have a little chance to survive it's bullshit. It's like I'd say I hate playing against plague and people recommend me playing with no mither.
---
This is so stupid. Obviously I’ll leave you alone after I’ve already hooked you but if I go after someone else and I see you again, I’m hooking you.
---
yes people can see if you are charging it. its fast but its possible to dodge it.
---
Are you joking? Direction audio would gut her. It has already been lrove that directional audio is horrendous.
---
Rank 4 you mean, I went from rank 10 on reset to rank 4 with a lvl 1 clown with PGTW.
---
&gt; while blinding themselves for points
---
Just play Nurse and you can equip add ons to nerf yourself and get points for it :)
---
I dunno something feels wrong with this, i feel like you do this a lot.
---
feels like a unpopular opinion, I see it as a grey zone. Its not the right thing, nor the wrong thing to do once the gens are done.
---
If you don’t want people to comment on your ranting, then you need to write on a diary, not a subreddit. Also, where did I state that I dc’ed against Spirit? 
---
Spine Chill is not a “go to” perk at all. A 6% boost when the killer is looking at you? Not worth it when you can have so much more useful perks. It doesn’t help you against the killer or even help the survivors in any way. It’s just saying “oh, killer’s coming, time to hide!” and then do nothing. Good for you if it saved you on multiple occasions, but people usually run Spine Chill when they’re stealthy, and although it is good for you, it sucks for other survivors. 
---
Gen tapping is terrible, just learn how to hit great skill checks with Ruin. It makes the game much much slower, and the slower the game is, the more powerful the Killer becomes because this means survivors being hooked, broken pallets, so less chance of survival.
---
So I'm new to the game. I've been playing both roles. Not even rank 15 yet on either role and I have about 13 hours of real play time; that's how new I am. So far, it seems like you are much better at earning points as killer if you don't camp hooks and look to just apply maximum pressure, no matter where that might be. That being said, I know you are coming for the hooked guy, so I'm looking for the idiot with a hero complex as I run off to trying and find fresh meat. And I might even double back, especially if I know you guys have a habit of just yoloing right in there.  So if I see you, I'm coming for you. If you take the hooked guy down right in front of me, I'm gonna tunnel him. Who's fault is that?  
---
That's your fault:  
---
1. You fucked up and got seen or were entirely predictable in the first place.  
---
2. After you fucked up in #1 you bee-lined the hook anyway.  
---
3. What's better? Having 2 survivors 1-hooked, or 1 survivor 2-hooked? It's obviously better to have 1 survivor 2-hooked because having a survivor 1 hook from being out of the game is way better than having two survivors two hooks from being out of the game entirely.  
---
4. Now that they are 2-hooked I AM going to tunnel them because I want to succeed as killer, and the fewer survivors the better. Should I play to lose?  
---
TLDR: Your stupid decisions as a survivor can guarantee your teammate will get tunneled. Maybe I just went full Dunning Kruger there with my 13 hours of play time, but I'm happy to listen to anyone with an argument that doesn't involve "You should play worse because survivors don't like it when you punish mistakes."  
---
Also, I've noticed a fair amount of this:  Introducing...the Scrub: [https://archive.ph/keM1Q](https://archive.ph/keM1Q)
---
I assume this is because of the fact that the next level can't be unlocked yet? Haven't tried, thst why I wanted to make sure.
---
Exactly my point. The Bloodweb economy is set up in a way that you always pick up more items than you can use in a game, and you always pick up an Offering worth more than those Common ones guaranteed in every Bloodweb. It really just gives you more stuff than you can use, and while sometimes I am happy to have even Common add-ons and Offerings when I haven´t been levelling that character for some time, I would just happily sell a lot of them that I know I will never use.
---
You're correct that it is overused, but that isn't because of the active effect, it's because of the bloodpoints. In a game as grindy as DbD it's really hard to say no to a perk that will usually give you 2x bp every game, aswell as having a good effect. 
---
The effect by itself is good, but not overpowered. It has the counterplay of moving into range, getting into a locker, or standing behind a gen. It also encourages the killer to play active. In my opinion its a perfect perk. Has counterplay, promotes healthy behave, and has good quality of life.
---
When you charge it, your face opens, and your arms move outwards. It's fast, but you need to aim it correctly, as there is a brief fatigue period while you recover from a missed shred, or if you hit a pallet. It's excellent at killer shack, because if they go for a vault, you can get a hit most of the time
---
Yeah exactly, but I think you will be able to go back and do them
---
“It just works.”-BHVR, probably
---
Yes you can, but after this rift closes, any challenges you haven’t done yet in this tome will not reward you with fragments, you can still do them though
---
Maybe dont give him lad next time all right champ?
---
Joking?
---
Perfectly balanced...
---
Call it kill rushing
---
Fact. My friends and I were just talking about this last night.  Having mained survivor from the beginning, it's given me a better "no fucking mercy" outlook when playing killer. I've been shit on so much as a survivor that I don't give a crap. Bloodpoints is bloodpoints.
---
why does this resonate with me so well?
---
Trapper has a very high skill cap. Not as much mechanical skill as the nurse but more decision making based skill. Once that skill cap is met you become devastating especially with good add ons
---
please help im scared
---
You know. It almost like you are a weak human ina horror  facing  a god that want you to be killed. Wow it almost like it supposed to be hard. Also you have 3 options. Option 2 is to double back(way more effective when not injured) options three. Stop and walk in another directipn, stop dead in your tracks or run to a vault. You example on happens in certain situations.
---
I only get salty because you fucks are so sweaty.
---
I was the last one left and had a Freddy that took me out then picked my Ash up and tossed me into the escape hatch.
---
Everyone seems to have a different definition of what camping/tunneling is. Some survivors will call it tunneling if they die first, even if you hooked 3 other people before then. That's why it's like a rulebook
---
Credit the artist. its not that hard
---
Really? I just like to wear fancy clothes.
---
Not terribly original
---
God, I'm going to feel so fucking bad slugging like an asshole for this.
---
600 lmao, not even the points of a totem
---
Here's hoping, these challenges all just promote mostly toxic gameplay such as deranking. Some of these you need a SWF for, like get all 4 gens done eith Dark Sense, or search 4 chests with Plunderer's

I'd imagine it's something to do with the date they released the switch version. They most likely had the events planned out for pc and consoles but jumped to the switch last minute.
---
I don't understand this community. Why would it be the killer's fault for doing their job? Why does it matter if they focus survivors down one at a time if it works?
---
I had to enlarge the picture to find him lol

---
It's bc but from what I can tell they can't do for you what they do for others, so you get pushed aside after you buy it bc PS4 players prob buy enough cosmetic bag alone to compensate. 
---
I'm a huge fan of switch but this coming there seems like nothing but capitalization on name brand.
---
I can barely see the other legion
---
Honestly, that would fix a LOT of things. I was bitching elsewhere about how it literally wipes out brown survivors who were about to get out in one piece. If it had a notification, after the first time running into it, the brown ranks would know how bad it is and be on the lookout for the notification.
---
Bond's range is more than enough and it helps you with everything else as well (you can see where someone is looping even when they are healthy, at least when they are close and doesn't tell you about something you would waste ages chasing)
---
Aftercare is also cool, but it resets when you get hooked, making it not so great
---
I don't like empathy. most of the time it gives you info you don't need (why would you want to know that the killer is chasing someone on the other side of the map, when with Bond you'd know that the killer isn't chasing anyone close, which is enough?) and only works after someone got hit. Also, running toward someone on the other side of the map to heal them is a waste of time
---
How does the save 3 during EGC mission encourage non meta perks?
---
You want to nerf already weak killers like Leatherface? Also the hitboxes are fine considering pallet hitboxes can be insane too.
---
Oh you all sound the same so i get comments mixed up . I did say i didnt want comments. Replying to you is assuming. Furthermore, I think you need to take a step back and try to enjoy the game for once. Otherwise, sure your pponts are valid and such and such. Not everyone has hand eye coordination to hit greats even if they practice.
---
It's no different than being a nice person IRL. It doesn't mean you're never going to encounter ridiculous people who will demonize you unreasonably. Those people are never going to not exist and you will always have *some* encounters with them. But you will also run into people who like you because you take other people's desires into account along with your own. But ultimately, you're not doing it to be rewarded for it, you're doing it because you think it's the right thing to do.
---
In the context of my example, if you really **never** (or very rarely) encounter someone who is nice back to you.... well. *" If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole."* 
---
In my experience, neither DBD or IRL is an exception to that.
---
RIGHT IN THE SCOOPS
---
Wraith? Wat? 
---
And which exposed do you mean? There are many ways to achieve this and a lot of them can be countered.
---
Ok good I usually patrol the area depending if no one pops up after BBQ and chili or if I catch a glimpse of someone. I get yelled at a lot for doing this, usually being called face camper. Good to know im not being a jerk lol
---
I was in this exact situation, leatherface chased me and i was steve, claudette body blocked at the exit gates. This was gideon meat plant, so she couldnt really do it. I got out.
---
Its meta for me
---
Really should be like 80 for purple.  I cannot stand no mither and now I see it again for the new setup in green ranks and even I hear Meg's dumbass 30 feet from the gen.
---
I dont agree with the its fun to play against part, im Rank 6, and if you Are injured, you Are dead. Its almost like a instadown because the time you get your first hit the second one is impossible to dodge(talking about high rank spirits playing with stridor)
---
IIRC the devs said you can go back to the previous tiers and do them so if someone as late to the party they still had a chance.
---
God forbid the killer with the best chase potential in the game have slightly less map presence (but still more than most of the roster with an effective average of 4.8m/s and unlimited pathing).
---
i still think it will be fun, but ALL need to be active if this is the last page. If you have to do them one at a time, its going to take a day for each, but if you can be like "oh this game is headed in this direction, i can do that one" then it would be more reasonable
---
To be a big meanie =[
---
because a very good amount of survivor mains are entitled. I’m not saying that no killer mains are entitled, but there are a good amount of survivor mains who will complain about you using one Meta perk like NOED or BBQ, while they used Adrenaline, Decisive, Iron Will, and an exhaustion perk. I encounter those people all too often. it’s kinda annoying, kinda pathetic too
---
you do realise that you have to be literally right next to her to see that detail. besides even if she is phasing she can still stand still.
---
Sadly this add-on is useless :(
---
And you downvoted me for stating why they won't make one, nice... Don't know why, but nice. I'm just stating the facts here, don't shoot the messenger
---
Bubba nor any Basement master is getting me. I will become the most invisible/stealthy survivor there is!
---
As a 9 playing now in red, you're my fav to face.  I get time to do gens totems and more before suddenly everyone finds a trap with 2 gens left and it goes to shit.
---
I just need self care idiot's gone tbh.
---
On the one hand, you do sacrifice a perk slot for NOED, so if you kill everyone before the end, or you get down to one person (you have to admit if you manage to close the hatch, NOED is useless anyway), you've wasted that slot. But you do have a point, because DS and Adrenaline are meant to specifically counter certain problems (Adrenaline does almost nothing if everyone is at full health, just a speed boost, but correct me if I'm wrong), while NOED is just "aww fuck I'm gonna lose, ONE-HIT-DOWN TIME."
---

---
 “*It's* not *Show Friends*, *it's Show Business*”
---
My feed was perfect hurray
---
If they get sacraficed , killed by Mori, or DC it all counts torwards the challenge
---
Only thing they need to change is make it so you start of healthy and then it doesn’t show the killer. Like then knowledge comes in, they won’t leave blood pools so you know to not slug them.
---
and make claudette white just like she was in the beta version
---
This is why I do dull totems while looking for Ruin. Chances are someone else will find the Ruin anyway, but I help prevent NOED while I'm already looking for totems.
---
Crap...
---
yup
---
They are and stop avoiding my question; what rank are you and how much playtime?
---
Now just some gasolin or good burning alcohol and ur good 2 go!
---
No idea
---
If you gave the killer the effect, then fair game. Not gonna lie, rancor is annoying though.
---
Silver for Tom and Jerry meme, good job Fog-Dweller.
---
Wait... you WANT to see the toxic BS after a match? Nurse call a doctor. This man is clearly not feeling well.
---
So you became one of them instead of just moving on with your day.
---
*An All Time Classic*
---
You move faster, lunge farther, can move silently, and most times I see you with crutch asshole add-ons.  Are we done?  This isn't a ds or noes argument, spirit perked up(you always are) with decent headphones is a nightmare.
---
Which killer did you play as first that made you so sweaty?
---
I picked up using it from Usyllis
---
I got bitched at for "survalience camping" last night when it was down to the the last 3 gens..
---
 Like am I suppose to ignore the big yellow gen?
---
I've been calling them dailies because it's easier, but the kill 4 survivors in 1 trial in the archive
---
Nice bait :) can’t wait for the spirit nerf :)
---
This bait is not of a good quality
---
Also if you have "ttv" in your name you've somehow slighted the killer and totally deserve the tunnel/camp/mori you're about to receive.
---
Wright brothers
---
It’s chapter 13 now you mean chapter 14
---
My personal favorite is when a player unhooks someone unsafely and you go after them, but they run directly behind the unhooked survivor to body block and you never even look at the unhooked one like you're going to hit them and leave the unhooked one when the unhooker moves away from them - but they still call you a tunneler. Was a cool thing to watch on a VOD.
---
Haha you dumb bitch
---
“Hey man, when you mori 1 survivor and slug the rest of us and let us all bleed out, thats some toxic bullshit right there. Dont be like that. You won, end it so I can find a new game.”
---
The one and only message Ive ever sent to a toxic ghost face.
---
yes u lose few sec but u gain 1 less hook
---
the old ds was better for the killers
---
one survivor use it once and its over
---
now 4 surviors have it and use it 2 times
---
Wait till you get to rank 5 and below... they’re toxic but also good so it’s just a  t-bag after every pallet loop and then gg ez after every game &lt;/3
---
Spirit is going to get the legion treatment. And i get your point to extent which why collison needs to be removed from her while phasing.
---
Like don't get me wrong her stun noise is adorable and my favorite part of farming but.. just.. yikes..
---
I remember my first game as killer too.
---
Exactly. In the end, what happens, either you win and get more bp, or some random player you’ll probably never meet again thinks you’re a bad person for 2 seconds. Fuck them, what are they gonna do?
---
But .... Daddy
---
I the knife should be redrawn at the bottom so if looks like it’s being held, looking great my friend!
---
Epic
---
I was accused of tunneling when the same guy repeatedly stepped on my traps
---
Trapper.  I think people really forget about survivors not being able to see killer ahead of time.  I can't set up a couple perks just for the few times I see you. 
---
If you want that setup he needs to be slowed, bc I'm already fucked in 50% of maps if you start with that setup.  You might give up a gen or few but trapper atm is pretty solid imo.  Might even beg for his nerf after spirit
---
Breakdown is pretty useless unless youre getting camped (proxi or face) other than that its not that great since it only leaves the hook gone for so long
---
Danke
---
Stop being a POS teammate claud
---
Sorry for the ignorance, but how can you get more than 1 million bloodpoints? The game doesn't allow you to have more.
---
If you are lucky and the shack spawns by a tree that bottlenecks a corner even better.
---
If I see an injured survivor run straight in front of me, I'm taking my free hit
---
Okay, rude, disrespectful. And actually i played wraith and still play him to this day. Also, are you seriously us ethe crutch excuse as a survivor. Thats rich. My favorite add ons is the haircomb and the saya. Go back to your balance landing bullshit. Glad instant heal got nerfed away.
---
Yeah that one
---
Dude... you just made my day... nice joke lol!!
---
Oh no, I play The Ghost Face a lot recently and I feel like lightening the mood after scaring the hell out of them by typing "WHAAZAAAAAAAAAAA".
---
Whenever someone unhooks a dude right in front of me, I hunt down that injured unhooked survivor, slug them, pick them up and whisper to them "you should find better friends" as I take them back to the hook.
---
Shhh...they might nerf Plague again.
---
Exactly ;)
---
Groovy!
---
maybe I can blind the survivors now.
---
Freddy’s lunge is ridiculous.
---
Every single web after this has had one in it. I now have 3 for pig and 1 for cannibal. After NEVER getting them. 👍

Whoa calm down fool, the spirit isn’t a real person no need to white knight her

So I used to hate the Yamaoka Estate map until I realized that it’s an almost guaranteed 3-4 gen strat by the main house every time. With trapper you can dominate that area and let them come to you especially with the stitched bag and tar bottle.
---
I play both and there both pretty fair tbh
---
İt'll be after the nerf
---
The same can be said for first time red/purple ranks and Hex: Ruin
---
I am glad it was too, I'm trying to be fair on it.  With that setup you asked for if I run 30 feet from a building or basement I'm fucked.  I have 3 ppl to account for besides me.  I was teasing at you not going for throat ffs.
---
Uh huh. I see you have no more arguments to say. Sad really, I was hoping to converser more.
---
It's just way more efficient to run around the map than to have walk everywhere, that's the same reason people consider sprint burst bad, because it makes you don't want to run around
---
500 Auric Cells pls
---
I had the point thing last night on xbox, as did members of my party after I pointed out mine, after a game it would say total 70k but I would have 56k, sometimes the blood points seemed to turn up later, other times they seemed to just vanish.
---
Thanks! So...lol...asl...u think deodorant sucks to? Or...
---
I don’t know how or why,but Im rank 7 playing only Tapp and Bill both lvl 40 and. No dead hard no ds no sprint.. and man... fuck ghost face.
---
Meanwhile Otzdarva streaming ghost face and complaining about him being BAD in dedicated servers lmao
---
If my teammates want to tap or urban evasion the whole map for the totem, I would rather they tap and help me finish the damn thing. 
---
Do the gen &gt; tap it &gt; find ruin quietly &gt; self care blendette
---
I should add this was like 2/3 months ago xD
---
wtf does that even mean?  There are 3 gens left, especially in close proximity, you can be goddamned sure I'm making a loop around those. Wtf else are you supposed to do, go stand in the corner with you back turned to the map?
---
How did you know
---
he became what he swore to destroy.
---
like green to purple, i was purple at the time, he mighta been red when i think about it. And it was against a pig
---
Oh really? I find that hard to believe. Here take a borrowed time and fuck right off.
---
*slowly clicks on agitation and iron grasp*
---
I haven't played in like 2 months so i came back with my usual skill and i feel horrible for bullying killers
---
this in reverse too
---
And the pinging round the map, I would be running and then get zapped back and end up stuck in a wall and caught even though I barely even went near where I would be stuck, also full game lagging for everyone whenever the killer is in chase.
---
I'm trying ;-;
---
Getting in lockers can help get more use out of DS. The killer must grab you out of the locker which will let you use DS. if the killer wants to avoid your DS they can't slug you because your in a locker.
---
They hated Jesus because he spoke the truth
---
I got kicked from matches 9x when i was trying to get the Claudette mission done, with no internet issues and even when i had asked the other guys, they had said they were kicked too
---
Im really not though, i play any killer really, bit mainly freddy because i have bbq on him.
---
You know what makes Spirit and Prayer Beads even more balanced? If you throw on Discordance, Thrill of the Hunt, Ruin, Noed, and an Ebony Mori. PrEtTy BaLaNcEd Am I rIgHt?
---
Yeah. There's a few stupid thing survivors do, like looping the killer near two hooked survivors. Until they both die. The survivors loose the game and call you camper afterwards.
---
DS can still only be used once.
---
asl?? are you trying to hit me or troll me.. dude.. how lonely are you?
---
Poohead (only use that insult if your looking to emotionally destroy someone)
---
after having played with some truly asshole killers (like a nurse one time who watched me crawl to the hatch and waited until i got there to close it, rude,) the stuff people will go absolutely apeshit about is astounding to me.
---
Borrowed time should be automatic.  You know how many shit teammates farm or patrolling I get at green/purple?  I'm sorry I pooped you for 3 gens gentlesir.
---
...
---
\&gt;sweaty  
---
\&gt;better than me
---
I know this feel.
---
So whats the point of playing a game and not having fun? A lot of spirits dont Know how to actually play the game and they are in high ranks because of the killer design. I think a vault animation and a power nerf like legion ( When you use your power you loose half of it) would be enough to balance her because miniblinks are really broken, she can spam them all the time to create 50% 50% situations until she wins
---
Ruin stops being good on high green ranks.
---
People are really downvoting you for pointing real shit out... Smh confirmation bias circle jerk thread
---
Fuckkk ima mori you then
---
"You are not a clown, You are Father Campbell's Chapel."
---
You didn't get my joke but k.  I'm cool with losing, but maybe give the 1-2 who don't DC per match a min to at least not depip before you go nuts.
---
Tbh, because I'm still learning and can only get max one kill so I need all three help I can get.
---
or none
---
the same as the old ds
---
so whats your point?
---
As a nurse main, gotta love salty spirit mains
---
Even has risen in popularity since the undetectable buff. Really feel the difference as a Ghostface when someone runs it.
---
I play on xbox and see this all the time. The solution? There is none other than looking up tips on how to better your play style. Playing both survivors and killer helps you understand what is going to be their next move.
---
Thanks for all the downvotes; my point exactly.
---
Killer queue times are WAY longer
---
Wish i could say im salty. Just sad people are just dumb
---
And Myers hates you
---
David's and Jane's outfits have glowy bits too :)
---
You look a lot like you slap the bASS in your free time
---
GET GOOD, ds is strong as fuck now.
---
Whats the difference between chasing a survivor and tunneling?
---
I bet you would.  Then, 30 seconds later my 2 blendettes will leave lockers while the Feng who watched you kill me runs across the map in the open diagonally.  My life in this game as the altruistic teammate tbh.  Thank God for wglf
---
Oh my B, i saw the joke it just wasn't haha.   
---
I agree with that man the dcing is ass i thought they were meant to be fixing that with a decent report system?
---
I feel like this is something Dwight would make... "How I kobe'ed and solo escaped the huntress."
---
Send a report from the game each time you see him. BHVR should take notice if the same guy is being reported a multitude of times
---
Seems fair to me
---
Not playing the game against 2 people doesnt make you more likeable. Farming is boring and takes too long. Just kill everyone with your easy mode killer so they can actually get into an enjoyable game.
---
Hey, OP! Do you know the link to your icon pack?
---
Then they are gonna find a jey and happen to find hatch after i hook feng. "GG BABY SPIRIT EZZZZ" whilst i try to apologize for mori'ing you especialy with that team.

You are trash for DC’ing. The killer didn’t do anything wrong
---
Top 10 anime betrays.
---
The problem is they don't have enough "dedicated servers" to actually meet need. So it used to be a 1 minute wait on survivor and 15 minute wait on killer because of the survivor to killer ratio was so off. Now it's 15 minutes on survivor 30-45 on killer because they now have an off ratio AND there are not enough servers to host everyone's needs.

You're saying killers don't use their ears and because of that spirit is ok? Excuse me wat the fuck. That is some bassakwards logic.
---
confirmation bias toward true randomness, any combination of maps is just as likely as any other, so you focus on a map that you don't like ans think the rotation is screwed but it's just random

I play both and the only thing I really hate is face camping. Anything else I don't really care about.
---
What if, if a survivor DC, one generator becomes none operational and survivors need one less generator to go,,? Thoughts?
---
They aren't imo, it seems like an option to make the wronged player important til it happens again next game.  But don't xbl message me a joke with anything midly profane, or else.
---
I'm just saying spirit should be fun and doesn't need to be nerfed, trapper could use a little more but will need a counter.
---
Flashlights, no dedicated on console window hitbox bloodlust movement is tough enough...but legit this game empowers others to be toxic to each other on both sides imo.  It's why imma swf from now on.
---
You Mori me, but I DC then my friends hatch.  Fair trade, considering you still get 3 kills.  You so thirsty.
---
Yes but actually no. Both are technically dlcs but they're free. The last breath is built in to the base game now and a lullaby for the dark should also be base game not a separate download.
---
Yea pretty much. You’re supposed to let them escape so they can have fun.
---
They said the game was broken. Something to do with bugs. Tho Nintendo's patch system seems to take longer than other consoles. Since patch 3.2.2. was released 3 days after it was released on PS4 and Xbox. They were expecting the update to release on Tuesday but lol Nintendo. Anyways, this time around they said they are trying to fix some major bugs. Which as a Switch and PS4 player, I can see some major bugs which makes survivor harder to play so I hope they are fixing that. Also, on PS4 the tomes crashes for no reason when listening to the backstory.
---
You literally said the majority of spirits use scratch marks and we all know that people are bad at hearing.......
---
Bloodcap needs removed. Change my mind.
---
Trapper looks like the brownies had alittle something else in em
---
iron will can counter more then spirit such a weak argument
---
Maybe he will put an end to it.
---
There's a video!? Link please
---
The scream tho lol
---
Survivors hate camping, sure, especially say while on a hook in an open area where the killer can easily see rescuers coming. 
---
But the reason I mentioned the Deviousness perk in particular was to point out that there may be a chance devs encourage it as a tactic.
---
Or I just bring rancor and I get the other 3 survivors to take one photo all together at the gate then they leave
---
That face got me in the giggle fits
---
Why'd they remove it?
---
He could be referring to the new rift challenges. Some of those involve Mori'ing multiple people. I've called them dailies a couple times now on accident. Lol
---
Yeah honestly people should just play dc ing is fucking a dick move
---
For me it feels like the game wants me to know what will be the 4th rift, as when I always access the Archive, it starts on it.
---
Just stay on the hook and do struggle phase IF you're teammates are doing gens and flail your arms.  It's the only real way to punish the killer.
---
I wish you could talk with the killer before the match so that you could help eachother with the challenges. Pretty sure most people would be happy to cooperate on this hard ones.
---
To be honest, I play both sides a lot and I groan in disappointment as to what perks either sides I’m against as. “Welp. He has dead hard and addy.” “Oops, I tunneled.” or “Well shit, it’s a ruin pop spirit” “Fuck, he’s got noed, fun perk”.
---
Overall, I use perks that will help me but doesn’t make the killer feel cheesed in chases
---
I would say spirit is hard to.play too but someones gonna crucify me for saying that.

Has anyone experienced this?
---
Literally just experienced a super weird DBD glitch that meant the game couldn't end until either the Killer (doc) or me (Nea) disconnected from the lobby. Not sure if this is an existing bug, if it is then my bad.
---
Playing as Nea versus a Doctor on Macmillan Estate on the 23rd Oct 2019. I get downed and then when the killer hooks me, the camera switches and I am now able to follow the killer as he continues the game...
---
All other survivors get killed, but I am still unable to struggle or attempt to free myself from the hook and my character is just glitched on the hook. The killer closes the hatch prompting the countdown and then when it ends, nothing happens. We are both locked in a dead lobby until one of us quits.
---
The killer must have had enough and the game ended, but the scoreboard just showed that I lived and the killer got no points due to quitting (which was not fair at all as he outplayed us.)
---
Seeing the words "someone disconnected from the match while loading at the end of a long queue is soul crushing, stay strong
---
But thats truth tho. How many have you done something loud and gotfen away with it. It happend alot.
---
Phoenix Wright
---
Im pretty darn sure you’re being sarcastic and if so ..... noice.
---
That makes   
---
Sense I    
---
Want to see it added
---
Just had a match where I hooked every survivor and the last one was the Jamaican Detective, so I knew the chances of Deliverance were high. I had nothing else to do, just wait for the hooked ones to die so I just stood there looking at him waiting for him to release himself from the hoom. As soon as he did I downed him and put him back. Oh boy that kid was but hurt  about "face camping"
---
That usually means the killer is occupied with something else.
---
Agreed, esp the ppl who feel superior because they try to Kobe then skip the struggle.  I'm unable to get shit done in under 10 seconds, tbh.  It only empowers the blendette in that other corner with self care, urban evasion, inner strength, and Sprint Burst. 
---
Both need to find a middle ground.
---
I usually do hit the unhooker before I decide whether I can go after the 1 hooked guy. A lot of the time it's purely situational because he's just in front of the guy literally unhooking him as I arrive. I'm sure this might change as I get out of the noobland ranks and learn to play better. I have yet to even meet a survivor with DS. xD Thanks for the advice.
---
Just die on hook if you dont want to play, really though you should hold on for full duration to give your team time
---
That feeling when you keep finding the same person with BBQ and no one else’s aura pops up
---
WELCOME TO PRIME TIME BITCH
---
Accurate.
---
PS: I love this Tom meme.
---
Liked the fucking blendette butt dancing in the corner with fucking Object.
---
This would also make it stronger in some ways cause it allows killer to apply pressure on good survivors without doing that at the expense of one guys fun
---
This is the same goddamn meme over and over again, yet I still upvote it.
---
Nvm he can fuck off
---
"Killers and survivors" really shouldn't bother with what "the other side" think or say post-match.
---
FTFY
---
That is the only issue here. doesn't matter what perks people use - just stop taking it so personally and raging because the game didn't go how you wanted.
---
Unfortunately you made your biases pretty clear.
---
First time I saw it I thought it was a neon nea and got so confused when they stabbed me
---
My golden rule is once the gates are powered/open, all pleasantries are out the window. 
---
5 gens left: I’m hooking and booking. 
---
4 gens left: Yeet on and Yee-Haw. 
---
3 gens left: Hang Out for me right there, I’ll be back in 20-30. 
---
2 gens left: Don’t miss me too hard I’m going for a light jog. 
---
1 gen left: I dropped something by these last remaining gens, imma just grab it and brb. 
---
Gates open?: We can just play 20 questions till your teammates try to altruism themselves to death.
---
Honestly though, from what I’ve experienced and read, it seems to be mostly survivors complaining about anything. 🤷‍♂️
---
I am pretty sure his name is just Joe and it's the devil-may-care I wouldn't rly see a point to use high vis here :p
---
stop playing to much mk11
---
I love single player games because they are so chill, even a more hardcore game. You can pause whenever, and you don’t have the stress of facing other players and feeling like you have to do good or your team will be mad.
---
Make one with an ice cream instead? Scooooopppsss ahooooyyy
---
tunneling is when you focus down one survivor at a time and make sure they die. I’ll admit, it’s certainly no fun to be tunneled, but the definition has become so skewed over time that some survivors will call you a “camping tunneling crutch abusing no skill killer bap bap bap” just for killing them. if someone accuses you of tunneling, just know there’s a 90% chance you didn’t, they’re just butthurt
---
When I keep getting hit when he’s 6 ft behind me as Im turning a corner, Im gonna think his lunge is ridiculous. Doesnt happen with any other killer
---
It's fucking raw!  He screams performing his Mori.
---
😂
---
I’m not doing it to be liked. I’m doing it to make the most out of dp for everyone, including myself. If they don’t wanna farm they have a choice. They can run away and i will kill them. They’re obviously cool with it because they play along. I think it’s wholesome and harmless. Idk why this community thinks every spirit player is a toxic pos for using her.
---
please clean up meme content like the cat meme/ lisa simpson fact templates/etc
---
I got accused of hacking the other day because 2 people stepped in my traps going for the same rescue at the exact same time
---
Well you have to think of the reasons why someone would DC first
---
I bought Frank’s and Jane’s, I couldn’t resist!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvPDBDV2QYc
---
Nemesis confirmed?
---
I mean playing killer can be pretty stressful in general. But spirits power is easy to use. At least compared to others.
---
Ok NOW I'm out ^^
---
Thanks for letting me know. I never thought it was exiting the match at the same times as someone else, I thought it was something wrong with my Xbox. Hopefully it’s something that devs look into if it’s a problem on their end. Very frustrating having to restart that game a lot.
---
It happens to me more as survivor too. Never happens when I’m killer though.
---
I once got into a lobby with 4 rank 4s and I was a rank 12 killer that game was rough
---
One of them is so pathetic, that he types ez against rank 20 wraith, omfg
---
They probably deranked because they wanna ruin other people’s fun, and they couldn’t loop for more than 10 seconds in their true rank. Don’t let them get to you though, this game is much more than that!
---
It actually had part of the argument. You state that noed deserves to be nerfed because of the fact that a killer does nothing to earn it. Same goes for the other perks I mentioned so I want to know if they should also get nerfed in your eyes. If you can't give me a good reason why DS and dead hard shouldnt also get a nerf along side noed then your argument to nerf noed is invalid.
---
NO PAIN, NO GAIN!
---
They are rank 19
---
Lmao
---
I love your rules!
---
This sub is so catty and bitchy haha I love it lol
---
Let him enjoy playing as Billy Boy.
---
Try a different killer like Myers or Nurse then get back to us.
---
As someone that plays both sides that sounds really dumb imo, sorry.
---
What is the one to the right? Im new
---
100% intentional derankers. Don’t let it deter you.
---
Id like the hatch and a Mori system to still kill w a little more work.  Plague did a Mori on me yesterday I thought looked cool as hell.  Get rid of tombstone Myers and the honest cheap shit and you can have keys and already got instaheals and Ds/balanced landing.  It's pretty fair for you all atm.how about we fix window hitboxes and in place you get infinite loops fixed.
---
I use Small Game so you don't have to
---
IKR? How hard can it be?
---
Don’t forget Freddie lol
---
Just remove the speed boost of NoEd. That’s all. If they take moris then take keys. Change hatch to something else that gives a survivor a chance but only if they’re good enough.
---
They have better perks
---
And that is why you deserve to be banned, nothing but a self centered survivor who has to cry because a mean old spirit is the killer. Do me a favor and dc fron reddit
---
That's why as a Nea main I dress like trash! Also, I can't flashlight or loop so technically I don't even know why I play Nea. I bring shame to all Nea mains..
---
Fuuuck no.
---
Hey! Did you know that when you where headphones you can typically hear even the smallest sounds of you pay close enough attention? Also if he suspects that area he’d probably check the locker if he doesn’t see you right away.
---
What about Michael? He didn’t just have daddy issues. He had humanity issues. Literally everyone on Earth who knew him feared and hated him.
---
Perks don’t make a player good. The player makes the perks good.
---
Nice bait
---
Noed isn't the counterpart to Keys. That's adrenaline. Both of them are fine, but keys and Mori's need looking into.
---
I try to not tunnel and camp (because it sucks when it happens to me) yet I still get a few comments on my profile calling me a camper and a tunneler. I also get games as survivor where i dont do anything remotely toxic yet I still go on the killer's "black list". People are weird.
---
For some reason survivors will always accuse me of tunneling when I play thanatophobia sloppy.  I guess not letting people self care in front of me is tunneling
---
yes, I would even sell good addons and offerings, I always get my killer to 50 wanting to prestige but wait to use all my Bluepoint boosters, mori's, good addons etc
---
*The only Freddy
---
Tunneling is frustrating at times, but atleast im able to improve my evasions alot better. Sometimes im always the one getting chased first  but if im good enough to waste the killer's time id rather have it be me than any other.
---
I'm half tempted to make one just to have the ball rolling
---
This is why rank 20’s shouldn’t try do balance
---
Buenos Dias, Fuckboy.
---
I dont main Nea at all actually. I'm more of a Kate or Jake main.
---
You made ds worse and powered up almost all killer perks.  Would you play survivor ever like this?  You want an hour wait instead of 20 mins?
---
Holy shit.
---
We didn’t get sans undertale as a killer smh
---
This isn’t a rant post, just a joke title don’t take it too serious mane
---
From my experience, survivors are more vocal about it. Killers just tends to be an ass and either just leave or only type gg
---
You sir are a fucking genius, idk why I never thought of this like honestly that would be the smartest/greatest thing. However these devs are so on the edge about giving double bloodpoints, I guess to keep the game “alive” but I don’t think they truly understand the grind it is for people who played a year casual and for the new people trying to play now.
---
He loves playing Freddy. He'd definitely be down.
---
Who cares about blending in, you gotta wear the flashiest outfit you got.
---
This is either a survivor who doesn't play killers
---
or 
---
a low rank killer.
---
Every game I get is 4 swf gen rushing, 1 ultra flashlight and a hatch key just incase at rank 1-2 &gt;.&gt;
---
My opinion on this: BHVR should start balancing the main game a lot better in regards to perks.
---
Survivors being salty if they have a game with ruin that is hidden so well nobody can ever find it are right to be pissed. But so are killers that lose ruin after 5 seconds because it spawned in a survivor (or didn't bring it) and then get genrushed in 2 minutes.
---
The problem with OP perks on both sides isn't that they are necessarily op but that the alternatives are so bad they seem that way. Why would I take a perk which needs me to get multiple protection hits until I can tank one hit when I can have sprint burst? And that's just one of the hundred examples of one perk being better in close to every situation.
---
And then there's the issue of the game being designed to more or less force perks. If you don't play at least ruin, preferably multiple gen slowing perks as killer the game will be over in less than 4 minutes if the survivors aren't very bad because you can't chase multiple people at once and each chase should easily take a minute if the survivors know what they do.
---
I'd say they should reduce the perks by around half and instead of flooding useless ones out every patch focus on a few that are good. And then design the base game in a way that you are free to play whatever way you want and at least have a chance to be viable.
---
We don’t want him
---
I would never say noed Is stronger than all those perks combined. Especially when noed can never activate when it’s condition is met because of totem cleansing.
---
Same meme...
---
It’s still unfair they already have more experience then him
---
That’s why it was a question, I never said It was going to happen lol
---
Wait, that’s a real challenge?
---
I don't play mk11 and I haven't played deathgarden in a long while
---
Cleansing isn't always bad. 
---
On a large map it's actually good to cleanse in a dead are with no gen far from everything. If the killer goes for it he can easily lose the game because of it.
---
The problem is that you have idiots who see people cleanse far away then decide to cleanse in the middle of all the gens you're doing.
---
I remember a game where we 1 gen'd ourselves vs a plague. I just went to the opposite corner and cleansed, hoping to draw the killer away. It worked, but instead of stacking on a gen together, my team decided to all go cleanse nearby and lose the game when it was an easy win because the killer had 3 pools next to the 3 gens.
---
Tldr: cleanse sometimes, but be smart about it.
---
You’re all such potatoes. There is no killer because killer isn’t host. You can’t leave whilst you are all ready. Unready then leave.
---
you inspired me, now ill go pick Scratched Mirror myers with offering for this map.
---
and camp above the hole to jump down on survivors.
---
BPS wasted on 4 minute game with those toolboxes.
---
The movie was okay, but Freddy was underwhelming as hell in it. Englund is the only one who can play him.
---
:( I mostly want it for Sarah connor tbh
---
Her phasing had directional audio when she was released, and she was fine.
---
Oof
---
I don’t have patience for that
---
Not really the same

Lmao 4man smurf squad, 4 adr, 4ds, 4 big tboxes with efficiency add-ons and 3 prove thyself + Thompson's vs actual r20 wraith with weak perks and no gen rush counters whatsoever: "ez" lol these frustrated kids have no shame or dignity, pure cancer.

That GF is a chad.
---
I was at those ranks with good perks. I think it might be due to just not playing a lot cause I’ve been playing a lot recently and I’m up to green ranks when I would usually be in grey ranks
---
It okay, ive been in your situation before and i just changed my strategy.
---
Spirit bad, NOED Bad, Decisive Strike good.
---
You LITERALLY could derank to this rank as there was a bug which only got fixed in a recent patch. Do you read the patch notes?
---
NOED is a killer perk.  Hex: No One Escapes Death.
---
If there are still totems on the map when the last generator is completed, one of them becomes a Hex totem and all survivors are afflicted with the “Exposed” status (meaning they are put into the dying state in 1 hit instead of two).
---
It’s a decisive perk because there are a lot of survivor players who think it is completely unbalanced/unfair, and others think it’s fine.  Any discussion of balance around NOED invariably turns toxic.
---
Said the same thing yesterday and got downvoted for it. Seems the realization finally starts to set in that they indeed might just come up short of getting those last 100 auric cells.
---
People never realize how long it takes to clean all the totems. It’s arguably up to a gens worth of extra time to get them all, and it’s never certain if they have the perk or not, so all that time could be wasted for no reason. Besides, if one killer perk is arguably better or just as good as 2 of the best survivor perks, it’s an issue.
---
Just make freddy say “BITCH” everytime He downs a survivor
---
Yes plz for the love of god fuck mori's fuck keys and fuck the hatch. No more hatch camping. But they won't remove it, so they should just heavily change how it works, like, if the survivors been in a chase for 2 minutes it spawns, because they chased the killer and outplayed them to the point that they deserve the ability to escape.
---
Dedicated servers
---
Incase you ever decide to release all your hard work. With these characters in your game you are opening yourself up to being ordered to take your game off of whatever hosting platform you’d use, and you couldn’t make a profit on it without the possibility of being sued for copyright infringement. The characters just really complicate things for you.
---
Are you dumb ?
---
Poor Steve's eyes got punctured too.
---
He sure says bitch a lot.
---
Oh btw, next time you see this kind of shit popping up in your lobby just leave, it's not worth to deal with that, especially for a new player.
---
Stridor make you 50% louder so no mither counter stridor
---
Yeah i had a random moment yesterday it's like my M1 locked onto the survivor but he ran around a corner and it sent me flying into a nearby tree, i feel like something super fishy is going on with hits atm, I've had M1s that definitely not hit the survivor and ones that should of have completely missed.
---
I appreciate the criticism, didn't know how people would veiw these.
---
Its always been like this honestly now its just worse. Either you grab or you dont if you go in the Animation you should get it no matter what idk whats so hard about that
---
I'd just like older Freddy Skins, like Freddy in the leather trench coat from "New Nightmare" or Freddy with the syringe fingers, etc...
---
No one escapes death.
---
Honestly, JEH is a fantastic actor and not a bad replacement for Englund, it's just that Englund us so synonymous with the role that if I'm thinking if Freddy in any context but the remake, I'm thinking Englund.
---
“I get it but you sound silly.”
---
Youre silly
---
Both killer and survivor lobby times for me. I can alt tab, watch a couple videos on youtube and just be joining a lobby.

The only time you can excuse tunneling is if that player played unfair before. I’ve done many tunnels because one surv kept teabagging me or (and I find this just to be a time waster honestly) bodyblocked me while I try to get a dude to the hook. But only if they do it consistently should you tunnel.
---
Haha when you try to be funny, but end up showing everyone you're dumb as shit
---
I literally try and cleanse dulls every match I play survivor I do know how long it takes. And even when it triggers I don’t really have an issue with noed. My biggest issue as Survivor is glitches and Spirit. I’ve had hag traps activate while I’m crouching. And the spirit is a pain in the ass to try to juke.
---
Yeah it’s all because of latency.

I guess we can hide.

Sorry that the only reason you play survivors role is that you want to feel powerful
---
Okay but then you’re still fucked
---
/r/perfectlycutscreams  material right there
---
would stop people from all DCing instead of being sacrificed at the end so that one guy with them gets their points boosted.
---
You used R6 meme to create a meme for DbD.
---
Nice work.
---
The helmet thing makes it look like someone strapped into an electric chair about to be executed, I like it.
---
I'd really rather go up against spirits all day than a single legion game, I won't ever DC, but god I want to every single time lol
---
You clearly dont have an answer so... invalid I guess
---
Wraith is amazing if you play him right. Say goodbye to the toxic survivors
---
I think its fine, they waste a good amount lf time looking for it. In that time they couldve probally got a gen done
---
I saw it and immediately thought about getting tunneled to the ground by the spirit...
---
I told you I dont know how much playing time. Rank depends on how much time i have to play the game. I've been rank 2 but I've also been rank 6 i work a full time job. Rank doesn't mean anything in this game in the sense it does other games. 
---
As a killer if you just absolutely destroy a 4 man and they dont rescue you dont get pips, if you get hooked and no one comes and saves you, you dont get pips. This isnt a competitive game in the sense that it's not even teams and who ever scores more at the end wins. This game is built around the fun factor. I play to have fun. Facing an eboni mori isnt fun. 4 people leaving the hatch isnt fun. We both agree on that. 1 person leaving the hatch is perfectly fine, from my point of view, that this game is built on fun.
---
What the fuck are these challenges lmao
---
This sub is like 30% reposts and 40% people circle jerking about the Spirit. By the way, Spirit OP and look at my fanart of the Wraith:
---
Your friend is a man of culture
---
Well then the devs need to actually put effort into coming up with perks because waiting 20 minutes to get into one match and then having to sit on a hook all game because of a insidious bubba is annoying and isn’t fun
---
:)
---
Nah that’s hag gordon.
---
Thought i was gonna see a charger carrying Bill away from an objective...
---
Thanks for the tip! I'll definitely put this tech to good use in the future.
---
Huntress basement is amazing
---
I play both sides, and god it's annoying hearing everyone yell. and no matter what side or how I play, I have people mad at me. I did 2 gens in a match today and then got yelled at for doing nothing
---
It was a Freddy one haha
---
It isn't though...
---
The killer earns noed if survivors don't take time to do totems. Simple as. Punishes survivors for not taking 2 minutes to cleanse 5 totems when they already know that noed is a common perk. When I play survivor I always bring small game and cleanse most if not all totems by the end of a game. Guess what noed cant spawn now and nothing to complain about. Do bones
---
OMG CLAUDDETTE HAD BIRTHDAYS
---
Use Boil over, flip flop, tenacity, unbreakable
---
I have too many of those lol
---
It's a good add on for sure. Only problem I've had with it is that you kinda have to respect pallets when you're using it, and that backfires on me a lot.
---
Just keep trying
---
Hilla will occasionally spawn on that map too. Usually near the barn.
---
mentally ill people, thats the only explanation
---
I pallet stunned a nurse mid-blink yesterday. I'm pretty sure that makes me a god.
---
Its fun and all till you cant use a cosmetic you paid for because of a salty cunt behind a screen
---
That sucks because it's like, the Mori is already equipped.
---
No I'm getting a LOAD of Badhams on PS4
---
I always get piggy ones, but I feel like even though I probably wouldn’t play Freddy lot I still want to see what it’s like to play him just to get denied ahah
---
Yeah in the multiplayer
---
What nerf?
---
Calm soirit? Explain. (Not hating doe just curious)
---
Hahaha exactly.
---
That would be SO cool
---
Are you okay?
---
Well hey if you do pop us that link. I have many stolen memes to share
---
David wears sweatpants so he can scratch his balls easier
---
I play both Survivor and Killer, at high green ranks where i am most of the time as a Survivor, i can hit Ruin skill checks Easily, And purple ranks as killer, im betting Its the same.
---
The [Source Filmmaker](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1884865015)  workshop has DbD’s Myers’ model, you’d just have to figure out how to take it from SFM to whatever you plan on doing to it. If you want a [Shirtless Myers](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1763989047)  that exist too.
---
That was exactly what I was going for. Something like... conductive  I guess. I didn't want a bald cap initially and it ended up looking better.
---
don’t forget that it also increases the Killer’s movement by a whole 4%
---
Loopable=\=balanced. People view new Nurse as balanced except you still can’t loop her bc of how her power functions. 
---
You began this whole thing with “well it is what it is” which is complacency, which isn’t opposition to the system we have. I’ve said it before the only reason you see really strong killers like Spirit and Old Nurse all the time in red rank is bc there’s too much reliance on addons for pretty much every other killer.
---
You still see items on the ground.
---
Where's  the "road to 60fps" on consoles? The fps got worse since the currently update. It's Impossible to play with the demogorgon (PS4), because, for some reason, the fps is even worse playing with It.
---
In the past you said that the fps will get improved on the updates, but it's getting worse.
---
You can get a free hit always with good aim and patience at the shack.
---
As soon as you go thru the door you charge shred and just wait. As soon as they have fully committed to the window (like they're actually vaulting thru it) you can shred and hit them through the window because it's so fast. If they fake the window and go for the pallet, you just turn right a bit and bam. Shred them before they make the pallet.
---
Never shack loop a demo lol
---
It's an event hook. Gives extra BP during event
---
I’m talking itemless survivors vs addon reliant killers. If those survivors don’t need to worry about items or addons against Trapper, Trapper shouldn’t need a purple addon to be able to take them down.
---
NO! I hate plague! She is so dumb and annoying!!
---
Extra points for hooking or killing a survivor on it
---
Why do you play killer again?
---
One out of 17 killers? So bc 1/17 of the killer roster isn’t dependent on addons, the situation is fine? 
---
Can’t agree with that.
---
whats wrong with typing gg? wtf
---
Few days ago, while playing as killer, someone said I was a "tunneling of hell", but I don't know what that means. Someone can explain?
---
Pipping = winning
---
True Tenacity
---
If they don't cleanse they are always exposed and easy to track both via visuals and audio.
---
That's power enough for me. In fact i find it more difficult to play plague if the survivors all keep cleansing, it robs you of your strongest addon and allows them to play stealthy again.
---
Good Arguement
---
Trapper doesnt need addons, i think his base kit needs buffing but thats besides the point
---
I fail to see how moving this conversation to bloodpoints is relevant. 
---
If you don’t need a toolbox to burn down generators like an old barn house, I shouldn’t need to load up Trapper bag to match you.
---
Yh but that’s because you’re a carrot
---
Is it still tunneling if I just coincidentally find the same survivor over and over?
---
This is difficult because I pretty much sculpted it to match my face. But if I could find an easy way to replicate it I would definitely do so.. I do know some people who's family helped craft the teeth piece I modified so it's not totally impossible.  Thank thank you.  I appreciate it so so much
---
_why would you so something so controversial yet something so brave?
---
it takes a while sometime the best thing to do is go into network settings and test your nat type until it says open and it should make it faster
---
I know that feeling
---
The fact that his base kit needs buffing kinda showcases my issue. Base kits should be viable, but his base kit isn’t viable and as such *hes reliant on addons*
---
I honestly love when all players have head on. First off, 9/10 times I just laugh at the fact that just worked rather than getting mad, and second, it means you have the absolute worst exhaustion perk and I dont have to worry about DH, BL etc.
---
Ok
---
Okay thanks
---
I have NAT 2 but this error still occurs
---
I have a stockpile of greens on legion, I use them to take out the frontman on swf groups... or just to kill someone who did something that particularly pissed me off
---
That is True, but she can only do that for a small amount of Time. You can try to make use of walls, hide, not work together. You can work around it with a bit of effort, she only has 60 secs of corrupt i believe. Plus if everyone heals up, she gets it automatically and all her fountains are gone. So you see there is still a lot of counterplay to her if you adept to it. Now compare that to a Spirit that has 0 of that and is still considered "fine". But thats a discussion for another day.
---
Red tank trappers on console sounds about right since I’d imagine trapper is pretty good on console.

Oh I missed that. There's also a side note regarding rule 103 "You are not allowed to wait out Decisive Strike and slug."
---
Huh? Where are these vocal survs shouting op at everything? All I see on forums and steam are killers complaining for the 1000th nerf. I never see this large, aggressive group of survivors complaining about all the nerfs they have received. As far as I see it has always been the killers. And still is.
---
I wish I had your luck.
---
I have a stockpile of ONLY Ebony Moris and in 200 hours I have never seen a Green Mori.
---
I tried faking they were Green and only using them once but people DC so I gave up.
---
Yeah, I worked this weekend and had family stuff, didn't get much time to play this event.
---
Before the rework you would dc
---
That's the face when you see someone vault a window you trapped
---
Lol no wtf
---
The game is fun, but it’s becoming unplayable to me. I get that 1 on 1 killers beat survivors 9/10 times but it’s stuff like this that you literally can’t counter. What are you supposed to even do? Makes it no fun. This along with 500 other bugs make it impossible to play.
---
Killers are way more in control of the game, that's why survivors tend to slap rules on them. It's why I prefer to play killer these days. If I wanna win, I can just play spirit or hag. Solos are incredibly easy to outsmart and the matchmaking/ranks screws good survivors with bad team mates. But that pesky lobby time....
---
Creative.
---
At least you got to play against a pantsless Myers.
---
For the first time you hook a survivor on it. After that it will turn red again
---
Did you mean: Long Arm Joe?
---
Thanks buddy
---
We have that leaf thing smh. Thats obviously its purpose /s
---
I love it! Makes me want to play a pixel art mobile spinoff.
---
Draw Myers UwU
---
Or gauntlets
---
The effect it gives make me think that he doesn't put it in the tonic but he watches a porn to excite him and so giving him more adrenaline and speed in movement
---
"It's not about the bloodpoints. It's about sending a message."
---
No, we’re supposed to stand in the same spot and not move. If you hit someone once, you’re a toxic asshole.
---
Killer*
---
Not very fun to go against at all.
---
Only topped by Nea, of course
---
I get hit through windows all the time now
---
Thx man. Do you perhaps know if i can export that model?
---
I use nurse's calling and monitor and abuse on hag, and I down so many people trying to hide and self care.
---
You can literally deny an entire perk slot and get 5k extra bp from cleansing dull totems. It's balanced.
---
I like playing against the demogorgan because the chase/terror radius sounds really good and terrifying
---
Perk: Activia
---
Sprint burst but you ruin your pants
---
“Turbo aids” lmao that’s a new one, I’m gonna start using that. But yeah thanks for sharing all that and opening up my perspective a bit
---
Wtf
---
Ah yes, the magnets that are the chainsaws
---
https://i.imgur.com/NErFV6F.gif
---
LMAO that's so ridiculously true
---
Yeah, I agree. Dedicated server literally makes the  de-sync issue even worse when the two players’ distance from the server is different. Problems like dead hard doesn’t work, auto-aim throws off your hit, fake grab from hook, hit lands miles away, weird kick gen animation etc.
---
Until you face a whole squad of TTV streamers or get wronged for the sake of "content" as a survivor
---
.
---
They aren’t easy ones like tome 1 where they take a game or two. It will take a few tries
---
The solution is simple. An Ultra Rare survivor offering that lets the survivor Mori the killer if they successfully boop the killer.
---
I believe there is a website that lets you download Steam workshop things.
---
When you play against pig you can *boop the snoot*
---
More mods waving the epeen around because the sub doesn't fit their view of sucking the devs cock at every turn.
---
Should it not be when you only go for one person? then tunnel the next? and so on?
---
I've read your replies in this thread and you don't want to hear anything from people that disagree with you. You don't care about what people might find frustrating about her. You're already convinced that you're in the right.    
---
Your comments are extremely condescending. You're not open to proper discussion. You're just namecalling which doesn't spark any interesting dialogue. Offending or patronizing the other isn't going to do anything to have a proper discussion about her.
---
Waited 45 minutes for killer the other day and survivors as much as 10 is the game just dead now?
---
Wrong game good intentions
---
I was half-expecting this to just be a clip of you doing something only for Myers to pop up behind you.
---
But it’s slower to gen tap than it is to just push through the ruin
---
Yes, that's the point.
---
Is NOED even meta? Whenever I’ve started climbing I’ve noticed the NOED users seem to drastically drop, and as a killer I’d much rather have 4 other perks given the game hardly ever gets to gates powered. I feel like it’s really only run at lower ranks when you can’t afford better perks and you want a sort of “insurance.”
---
Even worse when I have a full swf and we are waiting 10 minutes for a lobby we just need one killer!
---
Thanatophobia, nurses calling, Ruin, BBQ
---
&gt;	gauntlets
---
The most useless combat items in the game. 
---
Or maybe that's just me. 
---
Any time I tried to do brawler stuff with any of the characters they always got their ass handed to them.
---
I love it! You should do survivors to
---
I also mentioned the lack of them. I'm talking about a specific random spawn of this map
---
All these people taking the title too seriously lol
---
Uncle Bernie always looking out for our best interests.
---
You weren’t using a 4th perk were you?
---
during rank reset is the best time, but not right as it starts. Wait a day or two so that people have time to rank up and you'll go against easier targets. I did this with Freddy back before his rework and it went surprisingly well
---
Make sure your are using ONLY the 3 unique perks, can’t have a 4th perk. I also believe they have to be in the first 3 perk slots but I’m not sure. 
---
A “merciless” is a double pip. Not a 4K. Keep that in mind.
---
Just because you main killer, doesn’t mean you speak for all of us. Yes, we need more people to play survivor, but that doesn’t mean we give survivors more than killers. It’s unfair. And we shouldn’t want to *force* people to play survivor, because they won’t care to actually play the game; they will literally just do their objective even if their team has to die. And again, you don’t speak for everyone when you say you won’t lose anything, because we prefer to have some extra challenges while we do what we think is fun, and earn extra BPs while doing it. What you’re doing wrong is failing to put yourself in the shoes of everyone else and see the results of such a thing. Frankly, if you have a problem with it, maybe you should do your part and play Survivor yourself instead of being so entitled that you expect people to play just so you don’t have to wait a few minutes to get a match.
---
What did you expect from reddit? Originality? Lul
---
I’m the same. I try not to use meta perks, and I’ll use ones that I find fun. Sure, I don’t survive/get 4ks as much as I used to while using the top tier perks... but I’m having a great time playing now. 
---
I think the issue with a lot of games is that people become too focused on getting that sweet W every single time and lose the true objective of any game: having a good time.
---
Thanatophobia, sloppy butcher, BBQ, and Ruin/Dying Light depending on which works better for you
---
I didn't get that meaning at all. I guess the thing Frank hears in the woods could have been meant to be Jeff, but it could also have been the Entity in some form or a hallucination created by it or something like that.
---
It makes more sense that Jeff was taken because he happened to go to the place where the Legion had buried the body twenty years earlier and been taken by the Entity. Possibly the Entity has some connection to the real world equivalents of the areas its created within itself (like Mount Ormond Ski Resort).
---
Plague better tighten that part of that map up then.
---
Wouldn't want to lose because of a loose situation.
---
I would replace Thanatophobia with Sloppy Butcher. Offers more potential slowdowns. STBFL is also a good perk on him because he can get stacks of it so fast.
---
Also breaks Pallets. I mostly use it like a Huntress with her hatchets. Just make the Survivor panic and wiggle from side to side so they lose distance. Also they always fake Windows while you are charging your pounce.
---
i've never seen this happen but I sure would like to see it
---
But his lore mentions him graduating from high school *after* moving to Manitoba.
---
I haven't had any issues with killers dodging lobbies in red/purple ranks
---
Yeah, you surely brought a mori offering alongside a splinter..
---
Rulers are his best addons.  
---
As for builds: I always use BBQ and chili, Discordance(level 1 if possible)  and nurse’s calling
---
BBQ is just a great tracking perk and gives double bloodpoints.  
---
Discordance is one of the best perks for Legion as you can get 2 survivors with deep wound.  
---
Nurse’s calling is just such a good perk, if I had in on every killer I’d probably use it on every killer except the plague. 
---
Save the best for last is a good perk on Legion, you can get stacks really fast as you can 2 hit a survivor without downing them. Note that the perk doesn’t work for your power.  
---
Sloppy butcher applies to your power and pairs well with nurse’s calling.  
---
you could swap out STBFL/Sloppy butcher for Ruin/Pop goes the weasel as you’ll need quite a bit of gen regression. Legion isn’t the strongest killer atm.
---
You started off alright, and then went straight into nonsense.
---
I would prefer not
---
My main issue on survivor side at the moment are bs hits. Getting hit through pallet stuns, going down after I’m already sprinting on the other side of the window, being hit when I know I’m out of lunge range/behind the killer etc. If I’m playing killer and notice any of them I’ll just leave them down.
---
Again just downvoting. The funniest thing is you are just set on this one point on about how adrenaline is earned blah blah but you just stay quiet when any other points are made and refuse to answer them as you have no answer. How about the simple fact that there is no counter play to adrenaline when there is for noed huh?
---
I play in a certain way that, unless theres a ruin i just dont go for greats. Its not Worth the risk of missing for me. But whenever there is a ruin, i for some Reason just manage to hit all the skill checks. 
---
I Guess Its becuase of that i dont feel it has that much of an impact.
---
I get more mad at survivors who dc five seconds into the game, that shit pisses me off to no end. Only get mad when it’s face camping insidious clown who just throws bottles at the feet of the hooked survivor, but then again it’s our fault for not doing gens and going for save.
---
The Entity seems to be able to move through time like we do space. For it, chronologically, Trapper could have been the first to be taken, but other characters from different times could have been taken later.
---
I use STBFL, Thanat, Bamboozle and Sloppy
---
Me did dat
---
Traper is the puppet from fnaf. Anyway love the art
---
Definitely wait until you get to purple and red ranks, survivors there are much more merciless. It is quite hard to get a 4K there.
---
They are not unstoppable, laurie and ash have come close to dying several times and laurie has never killed anyone
---
Myers: That wasn't very cash money of you \*Comes out from hiding to kill me\*
---
*now you can taste SUNLIGHT*
---
I'd have it take longer to reach the broken state but have it also apply speed debuffs when fully sick. Some addons could be reworked to give sickness other negative effects.
---
Love going against Pigs and Plagues
---
Idk what’s up but I’ve never experienced that when I play Killer. I’ve seen my weapons directly hit people when I lunge at someone but as survivor I’ll do the same thing and it looks BS.  
---
It might just be a discrepancy from both sides, or it could just be I rngd out as Killer and never got those hits.
---
I would swap nurses for STBFL and I would swap BBQ for sloppy in that build or even swap ruin for sloppy
---
Usually I get called sweaty or try hard if I actually try to win. Hmmmm.
---
For me, Granted gray rank killer and survivor but takes usually instant survivor and killer up to 10 min. Only one or 2 more good games and I’ll be green rank killer though :D
---
In the pre game lobby they shouldn't be able to see survivors so they cant lobby dodge
---
I fucking hate gen tappers like imagine actually going out of your way to exploit the game so you don’t have to do skill checks
---
Don't listen to this guy. There's no respect in being a shitty DCing quitter. Go at them, and hard, and LEARN. Next time, you'll be just a bit better, so on and so forth, till you're a legit killer.
---
This is Bob.
---
Bob DC's when things are too hard.
---
Dont be Bob.
---
My actually added up correctly tho. But it happens some times
---
if you are tapping and hold down the repair button until you hear one repair noise and then let go, you will never get skill checks
---
You get the extra BP, the problem is, while bloodhunt was active, it was turning those 3k into 6k but bloodhunt only doubles your base points. Now that bloodhunt is over, this problem shouldn't happen anymore.
---
But what if I'm being chased while my teammates do gens? What if we're on a huge map? Is the only counter wasting huge amounts of time just to stop a perk that will punish you for doing your only objective?
---
Spirit cant find you with blood addon and stridor
---
Focusing too hard on one particular survivor.
---
New Freddy is hot garbage to me.
---
While this guy is doing what he likes, cosplaying as a cool killer you sit in your room in the dark mocking this guy for doing something he likes.
---
An updated version of the sketch set I uploaded here: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dh0l70/decided_to_draw_some_survivors_while_testing_out/
---
Oh yes, because survivors can definitely be nerfed. Lmao just choose another crutch perk when one gets nerfed.
---
Sometimes I hate it that I can read
---
Oh boy more survivors missions to fuck over killer mains who just want to grind out killer that’s totally a great idea
---
Honestly they could just make it so that after 6 seconds of pushing against another player, you'll phase through them. It'd be such an easy fix, I don't get why they haven't done it
---
funny! now you speak for all killers. I am speaking here for a lot of players who dont enjoy waiting long queue times, just visit any forum (official or steam) and there are for sure more then one hot topic about it on the first page. Giving people more so they do something they prefer better not to do is a commun concept in the world: people who need to work the night shift get paid more. And thats one of A LOT examples from the real world. In overwatch they are also giving people rewards who play Tank or Support because overwatch is trash with 6dps v 6dps. 
---
And those challanges would not be forbidden to play for you, if you do your part and play the less favourited roll across all player you get some rewards in return. Like I said you DONT LOSE anything you can only WIN something in return.
---
Also I use Claudette
---
O wow killers that lobby dodge hate this post 🤣
---
Otzdarva is a pretty good dbd youtuber and has a discord, http://otzcheats.com or https://discordapp.com/invite/Otzdarva
---
Yeah, new Freddy is hot garbage to me.
---
you forgot Freddie's lunge
---
English is weird sometimes, but thanks for correcting.
---
Then coordinate with your team and avoid chases, waste time putting the killer on goose hunts with distraction loud noise events near far away gens. And this might be a matter of opinion, but Gens aren't your only objective really. Totem hunting, preservation of other survivors, etc. can all be objectives.
---
Small map offering with bubba and iron grasp/agitation
---
But... but its NNN

Np
---
Me playing the Switch version where no one can message me.
---
Ok thx again. Have a great day.
---
What if by disarming the bottle you get to USE the bottle against him? Like it becomes an item.
---
I can tell when a killer is trying to use the janky hitboxes to their advantage sometimes, but I think Morf said something about Mcote admitting that it’s a frame issue and they’re working on a fix. Hopefully it’ll be sorted out soon and it’ll seem a little more consistent!
---
**Thanatophobia** and **Sloppy Butcher** for the obvious healing/repairing slowdowns as Legion can potentially get everyone injured within 30 seconds. **Discordance** for the third slot, that way you can know if two survivors are at the same gen and hit two birds with one stone. I know Ruin is a must for low ranks but it has the potential to get cleansed within seconds, so I'd recommend getting **Pop Goes the Weasel** instead. For me, this has been the most effective Legion build even against good SWF's.
---
bravo! now the killers &gt;:D
---
If you don’t mind me asking, what do you need the model for?
---
Aye I confirm what the other guy is saying, at higher ranks Borrowed Time and DS become plentiful so going for the unhooker tends to be the right call, as both need to be hit twice to down, but the unhooked has a high chance of simply restarting the chase.
---
Vulture sounds broken imagine going in with a swf bring in a red key and one of you has vulture and then picking up the copy of the red key and your friend picks up the dead guys red key BAM double your item and imagine every survivor running it BOOM triple your item
---
Oh yeah that's completely true! It scares survivors, and doesn't sacrifice one survivor to the "oh shit I'm fucked" moment when NOED is revealed.
---
Russia
---
Eiffel tower looks a little... different
---
Spirit will hear normal 100% sounds from survivor. This has already been tested
---
True, if they are all going basement they’ll likely DC
---
&gt;Just wait for the rank reset, they‘re all 19 or above, so I guess they went down to 16 and then waited for rank reset
---
If you derank to 16 and wait for rank reset, it will only reset you to 18 with 3 pips. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/C7LHXQP.jpg
---
Pro gamer move: After getting unhooked, run into locker with decisive, wait for killer to grab you then DS,jump back into locker, then head on.
---
There’s no way they’re actually rank 19 with loadouts like that. They deranked on purpose to bully new killers
---
After a survivor heals, the will get the exposed status effect for 20/25/30 seconds.
---
It is a fact people use moris, what causes so much discussion about them (here, forums, youtube, twitch) so im not speaking on behalf of the community, I am saying something that HAPPENS with the game
---
Bruh even 1 survivor dying to the bear trap is *stonks* it's rare but satisfying. You get to look down and go "what? why are you dead?*
---
I do want to try this build some time just for the memes.
---
No, we don’t all play constantly every single day for 365 days. People take breaks.
---
I have 3$ whos the best killer in your opinion i should buy?
---
Damn I wish I could use this but I'm on console :(
---
Or when your friend is in a chase, but you think it is the Ruin totem.
---
UwU I'm so sowwy daddy entity. I did not mean to dispwease you. How can I make it up to you? *notices entitys bulge* OWO
---
Lol Russians are the most hardcore. You see a killer that hard camps and tunnels with no shame, then postgame their username is a bunch of Russian letters. Every time man....everytime
---
I love this post
---
Have a nice day.
---
Quick and Quiet for sure. It lets you hop into lockers immediately with no alert to the killer, so it can save you in a pinch. I would pair it with Lithe or Dance with me, depending on if you want speed in your escapes or no scratch marks respectively.
---
The whole point of plague is that it’s a damned if you do damned if you don’t situation. If you don’t cleanse then you’re playing with no mither all game, and the threat of her being a better huntress is enough to stop people cleansing a lot of the time. She’s strong against broken survivors all the time and strong against all survivors when powered up
---
Sure no prob. Drop me a message
---
Everyone who intentionally d/c's is a chump end of story. Do you also flip over the monopoly board whenever a game isn't going 100% your way.
---
I understand you man whenever there is a tryhard killer its always a Russian
---
No, it's been posted 500 times.
---
People never realize how little impact noed actually has. It's arguably a wasted perk slot for 95% of the match, it's never certain if it even gets to be used since totems can be cleansed so it could be a complete waste for no reason.
---
Developers give some

Hmm ok so I’ll run with

For those 2
---
Tbh In game its more terrifying to get chased by a teenager drenched in glowstick fluid than killers that are actually scary
---
Few people actually consider spirit fine. And with plague 60 seconds sounds like a small amount of time but that’s enough time to down all the survivors or at least a few of you have the right perks. Run infectious fright and you’ll steamroll everyone nearby whether you have your corrupt purge or not
---
Ebony mori and green mori are the same
---
Yeah I just noticed that you can still derank from 16 to 17 by depiping on 16 while having no pip, and then rank reset= rank 19
---
That pocket dimension? 30 mins qeue time.
---
So when are we going to start the argument how decisive strike and dead hard should be nerfed as they are not earned by the survivors?
---
I've been running corrupt intervention and whispers instead of ruin and it's been working pretty well. Even at higher ranks I can still usually get at least one hook before a gen is popped which puts me in a good position.
---
NO WAYYYYY, THIS IS FIRST TIME EVER AND ISNT A BUG THAT EVERYONE HAS SEEN AND HS BEENT POSTED ABOUT CONSTANTLY SINCE RELEASE
---
Urban for my 3rd perk
---
How dare you use your perk, you toxic af.
---
Is really easy if you got enought luck and all 4 surv just cooperate (almost impossible) or be doomed to hell looking for that claudette hiding across the map and bringing her to basement.
---
Im playing like a month and on low ranks, and never seen in any game ppl stupid enough just to go to the basement as 4 like cows for the massacre.
---
If in low ranks people are not so stupid, imagine at higer ranks. 
---
Sooo as long as people cooperate surv/killer they con complete it. Also thats against TOS but why the hell bhvr making people breaking rules with that kind of fates? 
---
Now all the 5k hrs players gonna come to say that they can make it ezpz, well be sure for the rest of people (i guess 80%) gonna be a coop fest when tome 4 open up.
---
No ebony are the ones that make you able to mori everyone Ivory Moris let you mori one person and that’s okay not op at all red moris though yeah those are a little to powerful
---
If they hard camp and tunnel, they shouldn’t get more than 2K, 1K if the map is survivor side. Unless survivors decided to farm their teammates anyway.
---
Targeting Russians, bit rude
---
*pulls out bubba*
---
Why should I bring a counter to a perk the killer might not even have, effectively wasting a slot?
---
&gt;Evan: We're learning now his father is the real bad guy, aren't we?

Maybe *you're* now just learning this, but any type of oil/coal/mining tycoon is always evil.

Tunnelling = When a killer plays too well
---
I've only been on Reddit for around three months, following deadbydaylight, gaming and CallMeCarson subreddits, and there hasn't been a single that has gone by where I don't see this meme format used for nearly the exact same joke.
---
I'm a new player myself, but I assume it means to target one player.
---
Dude... I literally waited half an hour for a killer lobby just to get booted from the game, *twice*. Wasted an hour of my day.
---
I see that you are just a toxic player in general, I have seen your gameplay and personally was disgusted at a gameclip of you playing hillbilly face camping a laurie and proxy camping everyone else after that. I honestly think no one would even care about your opinion anymore. Clearly you are so set in your (wrong) opinion I'm not even going to bother to change your mind. You can't cure stupidity. See ya
---
Spirit hear 0 with iron will
---
No one knows what tunneling is anymore
---
yeah i just chase them for 15 seconds then down them
---
Exactly. Sometimes I find myself dropping a survivor I have on my shoulder to teleport if I know no one is around because:
---
A: One survivor is on the floor
---
B: Someone just triggered my trap
---
C: Someone has to go pick up the dude thats on the floor.
---
Thats 3 Survivors not working on gens, a few of which are now Mangled and suffering from permanent Blindness.
---
Most of the time I don't even run ruin because once the survivors have 2-3 gens left, most of my traps are where I want them and its only a matter of time before they get set off. Every time I teleport thats one person not working on gens. If I teleport in a chase, thats two people I know for sure arent working on gens at that moment. 
---
The Hag is the definition of map pressure as long as you place down traps regularly.
---
A lot more people were playing this weekend, it reached 50k players from the normal 20k. Yet survivor queues were 10 minutes+ as everyone was trying to play killer. Killer queues were fine though but I like to mix up roles
---
My sympathies to you. (If it's any consolation, with the archives being released, quite a few matches were less than stellar. Should have calmed down now)
---
Notice that all of those things require you to *do something* in order to get the points. D-strike you have to hit a skill check, headon you're stunning the killer, etc. Breakdown doesn't require you to do anything except run the perk. I think that might be why, same thing with second wind. You aren't actively doing anything when your health state changes, so no points are awarded.
---
My noob ass wishes there was a bot in this sub that recognizes perk icons and mentions in the thread then posts what they do.
---
I know I'm missing some hot memes because I don't know what the hell some squiggly lines in a yellow diamond mean.
---
No, stridor completely hard counters iron will. This has all been tested. Iron will is useless against stridor. Please do your research or tests rather than try do basic maths
---
You’re doing god’s work friend

I lived through the throat slash, he died to something else. Still a badass.

Pig, Legion or Demogorgon
---
If you wanted to just sit in an echo chamber and be told you're right just go and make a post asking for it, all your responses to any form of criticism is basically, "dab on dem haters they dont get me!" If you can't take criticism then you really shouldn't have posted anything in the first place.
---
I never claimed to be speaking for all killers. I was just making an accurate statement regarding what would happen. And just because there are posts on the forums that agree with you, it doesn’t mean you speak for everyone. It just means people have the same opinion as you. For example, I think Legion is terrible. Many people say Legion is terrible. Doesn’t mean everyone thinks Legion is terrible. And we’re not talking about giving people benefits for doing something extra - this is forcing people to play Survivor just to finish the level. It’s the equivalent of working 2 hours overtime at an office job and only getting paid for 1 extra hour. And don’t tell me to do my part, because I have.
---
I know it’s a crazy concept, but people don’t want to be forced to do something. If people want to play Killer, let them play Killer. Likewise for Survivors. Giving more challenges for Survivors would force people to play Survivor. You win, sure, but not as much as if the challenges were equally distributed, as they are now. Simple as that.
---
&gt;I don't get hating dead hard. After they use it I wait and slap them after they use it...
---
Well yes. If you are playing against inexperienced survivors who dead hard in the middle of an open field, you can just wait 2 seconds and hit them and the perk doesn't seem very strong. But perk strengths need to be analyzed in the context of how they can be utilized by very skilled players.
---
Survivors with 1000+ hours in this game understand how to move optimally between loops so that they are only in danger of being hit by a standard m1 killer for a short 1-2 second window of time every minute or so. An experienced killer can chase an injured survivor through two safe loops, break the pallets, and after 60+ seconds of chasing that survivor they are finally at risk of being hit while moving to the next loop. But nope, the survivor presses E to dead hard for extra distance, hits the next vault, and is now theyre in a new safe area where the killer has to chase for 45+ seconds before the survivor will be vulnerable to being hit.
---
For certain killers it is even worse. Imagine huntress starting a chase with a survivor while she has 3 hatchets. She hits one, misses the other due to a legitimate outplay from the survivor juking it, and now has lined up a shot she is guaranteed to hit. Oops, big brain survivor pressed E for a free extra health state during your very telegraphed hatchet throw! Now you have wasted a minute of chase time to not get a down, and you have to go refill hatchets while 2 gens pop.
---
Dead hard is situational, sometimes it would have been way stronger to have a sprint burst to just get you out of dodge, but for survivors who are very experienced it is the most powerful exhaustion perk by a mile. These players constantly position themselves so they dont NEED a sprint burst to get them out of a dead zone, they already know to stay close to safe zone at all times. Dead hard serves to give already strong survivors three health states instead of two.
---
16-bit DBD confirmed.
---
Yes thx. I am trying to get bbq and chili unlocked for ghost face since he is my favorite.
---
Nea would be a terrible therapist
---
I was saying potentially to be kind, yeah a DCing survivor has a great affect on the survival of the remaining 3, but I have escaped a few times after a DC, only reason I said “potentially.”
---
Try Spirit at rank 1 before talking good sir

some people don't always have the sauce calm down he/she probably got it from somewhere else

If you think that’s minor, bless your heart

I am calm. Just never post without credit as it harms artists

Can confirm this is happening right now on PS4 as the game’s probably trying to find me other survivors before the Bloodhunt ends. I’m rank 6 and am just matching up with 16-20s. I’ve always not cared for ranks as I just want to play and if sometimes the most I can do is get ruin away for my fellow survivors before I’m just focused, it’s a win in my book.
---
from the few hours a night i was able to play i played both sides and had no issues with times. that was ps4 though. this morning however in killer queue it took me almost 40 minutes to finally get a match and by time that was over so was the bloodhunt. i think thats the longest ive ever waited for a lobby on either side
---
a
---
Lmao XD
---
You’re right that it’s probably from a break but that doesn’t change the fact that they were being assholes. If you’re playing at a much lower rank than normal use it as an opportunity to try some less meta perks, or hunt items, or even go for some adept’s. Anyone that’s playing way below their rank and still running super strong perks is an asshole that’s ruining the game for someone. I’m not saying they need to throw the match or anything, if they’re more skilled then they’re more skilled. I’m just saying that they could still win with perks that wouldn’t ruin the match for new players. And I doubt that they weren’t intentionally being dicks, I tried to get my girlfriend to play killer because she only played survivor and was starting to become the “all killers need to be nerfed” type. Literally every match she played for a week straight was nothing but 4 man blendettes with flashlights and the most meta perks doing their best to make her uninstall the game or 4 man squads with toolboxes and perks to finish the game in 4 minutes. Whether or not they intentionally derank/have alt accounts that they let get to low ranks or came back after a break they’re still assholes for running builds like that against legitimate rank 20’s
---
“US only”
---
:(
---
IKR someone had to finally say it, SWF has been thriving for far to long despite how horribly unbalanced it makes the game game for killers, about time BHVR does something about it.
---
What if in not playing swf though. Have you even played survivor? Most of the time the ransoms I get go afk next to gens or hide in lockers when they aren't even in the terror radius
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
The point of Plague is that she forces the survivors to make a choice. They’re not “denying your primary power” because your primary power is the Vile Purge. It’s after you’ve used your primary power that the survivors decide what kind of game they want to play, a game against a Perma-T3 Myers with Mini-Stridor built in, or a Huntress with a minigun. Plague is in a fine spot right now, and does not need a change
---
So no real hate for either? Both are quite fine?
---
3 things to remember as killer.
---
1. You bought the game like everyone else. Play it how you want. Survivors have to adjust to your play style.
---
2.Leave end game chats right away. You never have to listen to any salt or sour patch survivors ever again.
---
3. Have fun. If you get frustrated ots going to make you play worse. You will feel it when you are playing good.
---
3 things to remember as survivors.
---
1. Focus on Generator's... period. And try to not leave your last gens next to one another..
---
2. Never unhook right away. Let then hang work on gens try to unhook before 2nd phase or death.
---
3. Work together. You will get things done faster if you work together. Even if killers camp it will be their down fall. Since 3 survivors can pop a gen in like 30's...
---
r/seventhworldproblems
---
4 weeks later and after searching extensively and asking in multiple twitch chats, I still don't know the answer.
---
I think the trapper is the most fun by far. It's really rewarding to think like a survivor and catch them in the traps.
---
Inb4 a spirit curbstomps 4 randoms every game
---
I played 10 matches last night.
---
Nine of them had ruin involved.
---
Guess how many survivors other than me were running small game?
---
No wtf I can confirm me and ALL my mates EU on ps4 have near instant killer queues at all times
---
Survivor varies from 1minute to 5minutes
---
No problem, I'm always willing to throw in my two cents. I'm trying to get more people to realize how big of an impact this problems has on our perception of the game's balance while playing either side.  
---
A while back they made a change where SWF lobbies could only match-make against killers using the highest rank in the lobby. They weren't winning too much because they had one red rank player, but because of the innate advantage they gained by being in a SWF lobby. I think this change hurt the game as a whole, and that the changes they make will likely keep hurting the game unless they resolve the problem at its source. We need BHVR to bridge the gap between solo queue and SWF somehow. Either by bringing SWF down, or by bringing solo queue up, and then re-tuning the game around that.
---
Can't get any matches. Queued +15 minutes. Just found a match. It's alway when I'm typ

Every movie exept the original and the 2018 Halloween are not cannon, according to the makers (John Carpenter)

Wait am I not the only one just randomly being disconnected form matches as both survivor and killer? I know I have good internet and laptop so i wasn’t sure where the issue was stemming from.
---
Detective Tapp, I tried to base his, Laurie's, and Quentin's appearances off of their original actors as opposed to their in-game models.
---
I mean if you're in rank 20... Anything can work there.
---
Why can't we just get along?
---
Same here. Am rank 3.
---
1. Bad idea, too strong. 
---
2. So Hex: the third seal except not a hex? Not a good idea
---
3. No no no, don’t fuck with speeds and never tie it to chase mechanics. It’s so easy to avoid triggering a chase while still chasing someone, you just need to look slightly down or to one side. Terrible idea
---
4. This one feels like the inbred cousins of furtive chase. Pretty pointless perk unless it silences chase music for whoever’s being chased, which is too strong then.
---
5. Being able to see how regressed something is is a cool idea but adding on regression speed is a little much. I don’t think there should be a perk that increases regression without prerequisites. 
---
5. Don’t encourage slugging for bleedout. That will ruin so many games. And don’t shorten bleed time. Nothing should shorten bleed time or encourage slugging for bleed out
---
I always love to hear new perk ideas, but these need some work
---
The queue was so long earlier I actually went and cooked myself some food. When I came back I was still in the queue. It’s crazy stupid the waiting times.
---
This displeased me greatly
---
So, so true.
---
Nice try dolt, how about the ability to communicate with teammates? Reading sure is hard...
---
Aww, you can see the joy on her face
---
nope...:)
---
I don’t think you can until you finish all the challenges
---
Nah just say it
---
Yeah i know, Idunno i was expecting it to be a brightness comparison between the neon of the high vis and the skeleton paint, Not that this comparison wasn't good because it is, just confusion on my part.
---
and the game lore refers to him as joey, while outfits refer to him as joe, so joey is probably just the nickname they use, and i prefer using it.
---
That'd be hard to implement, though. Plus, I presume he's immune to that stuff by now. He walks right through clouds.
---
killer queue is like 10x times longer lol
---
Rip pallets
---
Brown toolbox time
---
 im sorry but did you not read what i said or just read the calm down part OP probably didnt have sauce
---
the pics was taken by my friend since none of my friends rly like DBD enough to buy skins or DLC
---
So are survivors just not supposed to enjoy the game? Cos if this happened 100% the game would die
---
At least you can do your mission, my last one is locked
---
I don't think I'll finish any of the level 4 challenges lmao
---
Fucking hell there’s two posts of it at the top of the subreddit as I’m typing this. The fact that people still upvote this baffles me
---
Yup thank you! Also, I don’t really dislike spirit, unless they’re toxic, like almost all of em, but some, some are nice... very rarely though
---
there r cinematics available? :D all i get is the audio play with that horrendous voice of one the devs...no shade
---
At lower ranks, I get the logic of not wanting to focus on just one Killer, but at high ranks, you're either against a Spirit or you don't need perks to win. At least in a SWF.
---
You should have picked mercy
---
Alternate game modes aren’t even being considered. I think it would be cool to have new game modes but it’s not an option. And this would be a terrible idea anyway
---
On another Map? Fuck that! I want to be seen in an entirely different realm!
---
Yeah this specific mission encourages to play full optimal SWF with meta perks, genrush and bully the killer, then get people down, hooked and saved in a controlled fashion while still bullying the killer because it's a fucking sweaty challenge. This is probably going to bring more toxicity to the game tbh.
---
Some other challenges are cool (I loved pulling a This is not happening + no mither build), but there also are a lot of bullshit ones in Chapter 4...
---
I did it and now its gave me the feeling when i go below 800K BP i go,

"*oh god, oh fuck, oh god*"
---
What I’m saying is: do not post things you do not have the source for. It is damaging for the artist and they may not give permission to do so. It makes the whole process easier. It is a word of caution
---
Ok. Good. Just wanted to check before I accepted it.
---
This post shows you are new to the game. I'm a rank 1 killer and will try to convince you otherwise by prvoding a counterargument.
---
As a killer, you want to apply *split pressure* instead of putting all the pressure on one survivor. Why? What do you think those other 3 survivors are doing while you chase down the injured survivor? They're doing gens and it's *your job* to defend them. Remember that your main priority is to **defend gens**, not kill survivors.
---
So what would be the benefits of chasing down the savior instead of the unhookee? You apply *split pressure*. Going for the savior means you apply pressure to two survivors. The injured survivor has to heal themselves or go to a teammate to heal them and the healthy survivor is now being chased. Pressure on 2 survivors means 2 less survivors on the gens. It also makes you seems like less of an asshole because you punish the guy who is farming a teammate.
---
Let's look at option 2. You go for the injured survivor. Going for the injured survivor means the savior leaves untouched and can continue doing gen work. You've got pressure on just 1 survivor, which means 3 survivors on the gens and a greater likelihood of getting gen rushed.
---
On top of that, survivors have a lot of tools to counter tunnelling. Borrowed Time provides the unhookee with an Endurance effect, which means they can take an extra hit and requires two hits anyway. At that point you might as well go for the savior. Second, Decisive Strike exists. This is a perk that lets survivors stun the killer for 5 seconds if they get picked up within 60 seconds after the unhook happened. This causes you to waste a lot of time since you either have to re-engage in another chase, or go to another area of the map to defend gens.
---
TLDR: Split the pressure on multiple survivors to prevent gens from being done. The more time they spend doing other things, the more beneficial this is for a killer.
---
Lery’s
---
You could say the same about huntress, but with more skill needed. And she is faster than huntress too
---
I play on Xbox, my experience is with console players. Aha
---
You need to do after blink lunge to progress it. not blink go closer and hit
---
Injure and then down
---
I guess I'm underestimating the power based on the logic that in most cases you won't be able to REACH the next person. You still learn where everyone IS.
---
you can...i did all the survivor ones. i was reluctant at the beginning as i thought it will lock my killer quests but it didn’t
---
i don't remember but something like 600k bloodpoints and 2000 shards... or something like that.
---
Hahah it’s just an undertale quote, not saying anything about y’all, don’t worry about it
---
Are survivors not capable of cleansing at corrupt pools? I was playing Plague a few days ago with a three gen strat, but they seemed to cleanse no matter how many pools were already corrupt. I wasn’t seeing new pools spawn in, but the map was full of them by the end.
---
I see. Good work.
---
This isn’t comparison time, it’s “why punish me for doing so well?” Time. You got half of it right tho.
---
Even as a totally separate game mode, the biggest problem isn't the horrible balance, it's the fact that it would just be zero fun whatsoever.
---
Same here. I didn't even get any of the promised rewards for the last experiment, so don't have high hopes for this one.
---
Up to 20 repair points is always safe. I wonder how much longer it takes though, and how many fucked up ruin skillchecks compensate the time you lose by gen tapping.
---
I'm a survivor, and my perk set up is usually something along the lines of Prove Thyself, DS, Balanced, and Deliverance.
---
Personally, as a solo survivor (Mostly) I run these perks because I feel like I have to. Prove Thyself gives extra BP and encourages teammates to work on Gens. DS to counter camping and tunnling (A common occurance), Balanced for exhaustion, and Deliverance in case my teammates don't understand what a hook save is.
---
Imho the issue with NOED is that it's so cheap, and it's essentially an easy win if the people you're going against aren't coordinated. Losing the game hard? That's fine, you have NOED and great totem spawns, so you still get a 3K. It kinda just feels shitty to reward the killer for being bad.
---
I know you can counter NOED by totem cleansing, but that's just not realisitic for solo survivors. Takes too long and half the time your team won't do it too.
---
I personally have a pretty strong aversion to running the best things in any game (Playing the best heroes in a moba/team shooter. Running the best perks in DbD.) I like winning and knowing it was me that won. I like knowing that I looped a killer for multiple gens without using an exhaustion perk through the use of reads and jukes.
---
What are the stereotypes of the Killer Rulebook?
---
I love running this except I like to replace one of the addons with “soot - the serpent” because not only do you get to destroy the pallet near instantly but you uncloak and get to start smacking bitches right away, too bad dedicated servers broke it a bit..
---
How does that remotely counter the argument that noed can be easily countered?
---
yall seen ormond?
---
Downvoted for obvious reasons
---
I know no quote was ever said but it was showing that pearl(ghostface) was ignoring the entity(Steven) to go to Greg(survivor)
---
People should just hide the chat and play how they want (beside cheating ofc)
---
If you want to try to buy the Trapper, be my guest.
---
I always tunnel the guy who did the unhooking, not the guy who was hooked. He can't help that some asshole decided to farm him.
---
You got to admit seeing the same joke over and over again is annoying, and most people on this subreddit would have already seen those jokes
---
If they 3 gen themselves they can't really blame killer for the survivors being stupid
---
Someone has to test this
---
That’s exactly what my comment was getting at but it seems because it’s coming from a survivor PoV you’ve confused it as a separate issue. What I was getting at is the game isn’t “who is the best” it’s ebb-and-flow based meaning that without a mandatory set amount of game time spent doing multiple activities the game WILL fuck you over in terms of points/scoring.
---
Pretty much, except rather than doing a reply directly to a comment that makes a reference it'd be less annoying for it to be a top level comment that aggregates all references.
---
I hate her because her mechanics attract assholes. If people weren’t playin like assholes then she wouldn’t be absolutely busted, just really annoying. But people love to play killers that take away all interactive ness. If she’s phasing you have no information and really just have to guess, yeah you can get better at it and learn how the spirit plays but it’s still a guess that can be wrong half the time. And if she’s not phasing you can’t properly loop her around a pallet because her passive phasing makes it look like you’re getting moonwalked and suddenly she’s on you. When someone that isn’t good as spirit and isn’t an asshole plays her it can be an ok match, but never very fun. Unfortunately people like to be dicks, they moved to spirit when legion got reworked and their still being pricks. But this isn’t a spirit post
---
Felt this when trapper was camping last genmys hard on hospital map and already used mori on 2 survivors
---
I'm lack toes in toddler ants as well
---
The rift gives okay returns, and the part 1 challenges aren't impossibly hard like the leaked part 4 ones are.
---
Then those brainlets shouldn't have given the killer a 3-gen setup
---
Omfg I'd die. Wazaaaaaaaaap
---
Tier list memes were fucking great what the hell. This is bullshit.
---
You're saying the killer can open the exit gates? What strategy does that employ
---
You can see when she's phasing if you look at the glass. I agree that prayer beads is broken but base spirit is fine imo. Strong but fine.
---
She's one of Legion
---
Being a red rank killer I gotta say, going for a save with a flashlight isn't really dumb though. Because it has so many benefits long term. 1 you have someone, 2 potentially stun killer, 3 prevent a hook and keep match going on longer. You could say that about DS, but the issue is I've run into more people that just stupid run around injured without a care in the world because they have DS and know I can't do anything to them, besides slug, and that might waste time since I'd potentially have to chase them. Sure, they can body block and get all the same stuff from the flashlight stuff, but I run into that WAY less often. And most of the time, attempting a flashlight save doesn't put most people at risk, unless they're actually just really dumb. I have people try it to me at red rank plenty, and most of the time it isn't something I'll be able to punish unless the person is just really dumb/cocky.
---
And if you're a smart killer running endfury you're not going to just walk around trying to get stunned by every pallet you can. Huh? Your objective with that is to bait out pallets to make survivors throw them down like normal, and only show that you have those when your Spirit Fury is up and you'll be able to punish it. If people know you have endfury, they'll know to throw pallets down early, and not wait for the stun, which totally ruins any use you get from them.
---
From what I've seen, since I don't use lightborn, is killers only pick it up when they see a bunch of people running flashlight, and even then, they look around before picking up survivors most of the time to prevent it. None of those skills you have mentioned promote playing dumb, because to benefit from them fully, you play smarter or people will know what perks you have.
---
I want to be seen on a different game.
---
Now I know NOED’s hard counter is to do totems, but even so, it will always be a perk that rewards killers that have failed their job of defending the generators. It is a crutch for low rank killers and that’s why you see low-skill killers at high ranks and it’s honestly frustrating to see it.
---
Adrenaline can also feel pretty unfair at times, but it rarely ever has as big an impact as NOED does.
---
I’ve always thought double BP should be normally rate personally
---
Okay, don’t get mad, I play legion a lot... I am not a mean one, sometimes... WHEN I found the hatch when the last person is alive, I’ll drag em to there, else...
---
Just run less meta perks and make sure to pip. You can still pip even if you die so you could start playing like a potato near the end of the match to make the killer feel good at the end. Don’t have to obviously, this is just what I do because I remember how bad it can be as a killer
---
monitor and abuse it’s a staple myers perk, but you can really use anything based on ur playstyle
---
Well being nerfed for the 1000th time is actually a valid reason to being vocal. You need to be specific killers to be relevant at high ranks.
---
It looks like she shot Nea in the back with a gun
---
That’s some weak ass bait. You gotta at least make a proper post so it look so like you’re serious
---
Pc or console?
---
ruin AND bbq on a 3 perk demo? :( freakin lucker
---
I think he meant leave at lobby before the match begins.
---
the nurse daily has been broken for a while, i dont know exactly how long but everyone says it doesnt work :(
---
Feels bad. I really wanted Sarah Connor as survivor :/
---
Nurse and Huntress aren’t base game but good work nonetheless. Thats really impressive
---
I’ve been wanting this for years, it would be perfect. I honestly think that even a 1/2 exchange rate would be fine
---
Inner Strength is a good perk that soft counters NoED. Detectives Hunch helps you find totems for any hex perk and has other uses. I will agree that Small Game is pretty trash. Simultaneously too big of an angle so it's too vague, while also being too specific of a circumstance to rely on it finding totems quickly.
---
they need to leave doc the fuck alone. hes my main and hes perfectly fine even with a high as fuck co-pay because my insurance doesnt get along with him
---
I run Thana, Dying Light, Discordance, and Save the Best for Last.
---
Dying light can probably be replaced by ruin but I've been hurt too many times by that perk.
---
They play killer so much they can afford those perks I guess
---
Yes. Please tell me you’re running this on Myers with Fragrant Tuft of Hair and J. Myers Memorial. Exposed overkill
---
See, the problem is that you prestige. If you like the cosmetics then good for you, but otherwise it’s an absolute waste of bloodpoints. And in my opinion the cosmetics don’t even look that cool
---
That sucks, although I did actually kind of enjoy the meme add ons. Caught a few survivors out by having no terror radius, which is weird since Nurse's breathing is really loud. More fun than trying to play regular nurse on console.
---
They both suck ass almost equally.
---
Not quite. 
---
BNP is consumed on use.
---
One guy has to not use his BNP and get himself killed.
---
You're designating one person as a sacrificial lamb, and having them not use their item.
---
If the killer goes for somebody else first, the strat fails and you're left no better off than if you weren't running the perk. 
---
So in the end you're getting one teammate killed in order to get a couple gens worth of progress. You don't need a perk build for that.
---
There is just no good reason to run this in a SWF. The meta SWF build is already strong enough to reliably get 3-4 people out alive if executed properly. If you just want items, a Plunderers build is still better. 
---
Vulture is a fun little perk for solo survivors. 
---
Trying to use it in SWF might occasionally let you dupe an item, but trying to force it like that will throw matches and often result in your group taking fewer items out of the trial than you brought in.
---
It’s either in or out, no tweaks.
---
As a Rank 1 Plague, I can say that it's the same way up here as well.
---
I prefer it when they do not cleanse. If they do cleanse, I'm still going to ignore Corrupt Purge except in very special scenarios. It's just more ideal for me.
---
Damn, you lived through a throat slash??
---
This sub has became pretty fucking cringe lately. Memes are all reposts and low effort. Cosplays are all similar in quality also same Pig, Huntress, Legion, Dwight ones every day. Low quality videos taken in real life of someone tbagging or clicking a flashlight. Insert spirit bad meme. Insert a DC meme. Insert a meme using the trappers face and Dwight in the template. Insert a salt story. Insert an “unpopular opinion”. Insert template using pink addons or purple perks. Insert killer concept here(Probably a fright nights at Freddy’s one). Sexually repressed representation of literally any and all characters in the game bordering on a disturbing fascination. A video of a killer getting bullied. A video of a survivor getting last minute killed. Insert Bloodwarden here. 
---
I used to like discussing perks, new killers, builds, maps, items, and the god like gifs or memes that used to be here but now it’s gotten so.... lame. Look at any other sub that has proper conversations and fun without using low quality reposts for karma constantly.
---
But I'm broke and they wont put inner strength in the shrine :(
---
Insulting people because you disagree with them means being an entire circus
---
nah. you’ll probably be accused of it tho
---
Use the meme to talk about it’s overuse. Well played.
---
Does demogorgon even have a human soul because of it’s connection with the lass from stranger things or no?
---
yea but Plague can hit multiple people
---
Definitely, m8
---
Both are very unfun to go against. They’re not difficult, just very annoying and boring. Doc needs it more though. Hopefully they make him fun
---
New-ish? It used to always happen before loading into a lobby, now that’s gone and replaced with this.
---
Oh, yeah. They probably made whole new accounts and bought the game again just to not rank up Survivor until they had their meta builds.
---
It's either that or waiting for like two rank resets after deranking fully.
---
I thought he just wanted some advice too so I could talk to him instead of on here. Jeez calm down guys
---
True true
---
Yes buuuut, the bleed out timer will start because you have no terror radius.
---
it’s seen as a crutch by most. it’s less popular at higher levels because they usually don’t need it if they’re good enough to get the 4k beforehand
---
Don’t think that’s his intention. I think it’s Just a “rank 1 killer” joke
---
I thought he just meant ignore the post-game chat.
---
I'm rank 8 so not too bad, not too good
---
What would your alternative example be? The point is that patrolling the last 3 gens is kinda the only real strategy available to the killer at that point. "Stand in the corner" might be a tad hyperbolic, but anything that involves just leaving the area on a whim is just basically handing the survivors the opportunity to get the gates powered for free.
---
Well I think BHVR would reply to you and say:
---
"you don't have to complete the survivor missions and you can just play how you want and progress through the tome at your own pace. If you want to go faster then you have to complete the survivor missions."
---
Nurse daily been broke since rework :(
---
Becuase it also shows auras
---
The game is literally built on imperfect balance. As it stands though the eboni mori reduces the fun factor. There is absolutely no counter to it. I also agree that a key allowing 4 people to escape is not fun. That's why I made the suggestion to allow only 1 person to escape with a key. You've made no suggestions. You've only complained and asked for my credibility.
---
GULP
---
DS punishes killers for tunneling, a survivor can’t do anything to counter  being tunneled straight off the hook or teammates farming. 
---
Also, considering how few people are able to consistently use DH effectively I really don’t think it’s a good example.
---
Nah Janes booty will always be supreme
---
haha Steve needs smoke in his hand.
---
And practically every killer perk with a minimum distance on indoor maps. Whispers always on, BBQ almost never showing auras, devour hope significantly harder to trigger, ...
---
Old decisive rewarded bad gameplay. Current decisive punishes killer for tunneling
---
They wouldn't have that build without a lot of playtime in someone.
---
Yes. You're supposed to run across the map and walk in circles until the survivors finish the rest of the gens and open the gates to leave and start to tbag, before you're allowed to leave your corner of the map.
---
No, neurotypicals are just that shitty sometimes.
---
There’s no perk designed to help you disconnect but there is a perk designed to help you camp. Notice the difference, lad?
---
Remember don't cream your pants
---
(Reference to season one Steve for context)
---
^this 100% - it's currently the healthiest perk in the game. anti tunnel, rewarding conditions, win win for both sides.
---
I think I found a good image that shows it in-game:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/drckbu/when_you_were_just_penetrated_by_daddy_myers/
---
Not similar at all, actually. Noed gives the killer a speed boost and the ability to one-shot every survivor. If a killer is having noed activate every match it means they are consistently unable to kill survivors before the gens are done.
---
Dead hard is a second chance perk that buys the survivor a few extra seconds. It’s only a good perk if the survivor knows how to use it. A killer doesn’t need to know how to use noed for it to be effective. 
---
Decisive is just an anti-tunnel perk, I can’t even begin to understand how you think it’s similar to noed. 
---
Adrenaline is a reward to the survivors for completing their objective. Noed is a reward to the killer for not completing theirs. 
---
That being said, I don’t think noed or adrenaline are toxic or unfair to use. No current perks in the game strike me as overpowered.
---
This is stupid. This gets nearly 2K upvotes? That’s sad.
---
Idk just doesn’t make sense. Killer gets bp either way and you get nothing. Seems detrimental to you more than anything, but hey it’s your life. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
But the fact is that they are getting something in return for failing the objective
---
Removed please post /r/dbdLFG
---
But what's exactly the tome? I haven't played I a while is that something like a battle pass?
---
They already reworked doc before trappy boi and LF need it most
---
So they should take off perks??? No of course not, because same happens for good killers when they take a break and shit on new players. Stop being such a whiny bitch this kid got his ass handed to him fair on square
---
You’ve spoken as if everyone sides with you a lot
---
For example
---
No one with over 200 hours cares about ranking, bloodpoints, emblems, and they don’t care about removing a player with a mori. 
---
You also use they word people instead of I or me. 
---
Most of your arguments are similar to that of a face camper. “It gets kills and that’s all that matters, who cares about literally everything else?”
---
Legion:am i a joke to you
---
Left behind encourages survivors to let their teammates die
---
That's...kind of weird. So you can buy the skins with money year-round, your serums will vanish 2 weeks after the rift ends in like 64 days, and offerings will become unusable/Halloween stuff stops spawning in a week?
---
You're god damn right
---
I've done jump scare from tier 1 to tier 3.
---
It can be done in most maps just not as well as ones you've mentioned. 
---
That being said, it's my most fun strat
---
Triggering EGC.  
---
I did it to trigger blood warden/ end the game quicker.
---
If only some unforeseen circumstances made them keep it on, yes?
---
New skin has big booty
---
Thank for choccy myilk
---
I liked the tier lists. Low effort memes are the best memes, you can’t change my mind
---
Me being rank 10 and getting paired with 3 rank 17 bills
---
There was a boat load of lore before in any case.
---
Stop... *heavy breathing* running away... *heavy breathing* from me....  *heavy breathing* so fast...
---
The killer absolutely needs to have the power role but survivors shouldn’t be helpless. If the killer should be the undisputed powerhouse then it should be a single player game against bots. Spirit isn’t fun to play against, because what you do doesn’t really matter. All you can do is make a guess and hope the killer makes a mistake. With every other killer (including nurse, just to a lesser degree) it comes down to the relative skill of both the killer and the survivor, but with spirit it’s dependent solely on the skill of the spirit. A bad spirit will lose every game, a good spirit will win every game.
---
I never knew that "tunnelling" was a thing or that there was rules against this type of play (laid out by survivor - lol) so I might have been guilty of this. 
---
Normally I go defend the gens, but if your stupid enough to run in my direction after being unhooked then you're going back up. Sorry not sorry.
---
I'd prefer if they just raised the BP caps to 40k, 10 per category, but double BP every weekend would be fantastic, especially considering the gulf between casual players and the multi-thousand hour elites.
---
Survivors: ***do all gens within 2 minutes***
---
Entity- ***Double pipppp***
---
Those builds work the best with doctor, since it's aura of madness increase along with the terror radius
---
*Honk Honk* 🤡
---
I know I m a trapper Main!
---
I was just thinking that there weren’t many trappers in high rank!
---
I used to enjoy the game like this. Now I sorta just survey the area near a gen and see the closest pallet/window loop and strategize accordingly. It's less fun when you're no longer afraid of the killer.
---
*laughs in all trapped exits beforehand forcing you to either attempt a dead hard through one or waste time disarming one*
---
I like to pretend legion just doesn’t exist
---
From the perspective of a solo queue survivor who has to go against rank 1 Spirits, it's turbo aids. She is more balanced for playing against a 4-man SWF. You just can't beat her without a certain level of coordination. Sometime the stars will align, and a solo queue team will end up wasting no time just by chance, but most of the time you can't outpace her momentum.  
---
One problem is that you've gotta have Iron Will on to be able to play against her, and you may need Spine Chill as well (especially with prayer beads). You can't have mandatory perk slots to play against a certain killer when there are 17 killers and rising. The other problem is that she makes the game uninteractive from the survivor side. You have to guess what she's going to do, and then just wait to see if you die.  
---
What makes a survivor really good comes after learning to loop. It's about route planning and decision making, using the information available to you. It's part of the reason for the strength of SWF and Spirit. Solo queue players have no info from or about teammates, and no info from Spirit. There's just no way to leverage game knowledge or experience in a situation with no information.
---
Basement stairs. 
---
Wasted your wish lol.
---
Nah man. I got We're Gonna Live Forever after unlocking all perks (including all teachables) and I have 90% of them at tier 3 before I got WGLF to appear in the bloodweb.
---
\*This was before the new updated bloodweb which made this 10x worse\*
---
They're both solid endgame perks. Adrenaline is frustrating and comes in at clutch moments, but so does NOED. Adrenaline is countered by the Survivor being out-of-chase or dead before the gens all pop off, NOED is countered by doing bones.
---
Thank you. They were all trash
---
What would you say is a good alternative example?
---
They're both crutch perks. NOED has the redeeming quality of being tied to totems, but Adrenaline almost deliberately caters to SWFs and is ALSO Hope, because apparently Hope exists just to spite low-level Surviors.
---
NOED should probably be swapped to just a speed boost, but a much larger one, while Adrenaline should only heal.
---
Actually, I always DC when I reach sans battle
---
Every day we stray further from God's light.
---
this reads like someone who's never even played the game but is survivor-sided because their friend is a survivor main
---
Yeah I guess you were right then, would still prefer a bonk noise anyways heh
---
*Laughs in Prayer Beads*
---
It’s not PVP, it’s cat and mouse. This is my point, nobody remembers how it’s supposed to be.
---
Nah I'm saying Freddy's oblivious effect makes a zero tero radius bubba if you're asleep, prepare
---
Exactly!
---
That's like saying you should make equally as much money as a professional painter when you can't even hold a brush.
---
You work for something therefore you get the skills and knowledge to be better. Everyone playing this game starts the same with nothing but the chars and the 3 skills each character has, if you can't handle that go play something else, otherwise sack up and plow through, we all had to do it!
---
If you want to be good at a game you're to lazy to put time into, then it's not the systems that sucks but just you!
---
Prove Thyself/Resilience, if your gonna be by yourself most of the time you probably won’t be healed so run resilience, if you’re going to be with people run prove thyself
---
If you feel that way about Dead Hard and Decisive then you might as well make an argument like that for nearly every perk in the game and it’s not true. NOED is completely different.
---
Rank 20 is hard to get if you're not a new player - even being an absolute potato, you'll rise relatively quickly. So, you're suffering from a small pool of players near that rank.
---
The good news is, with a decent number of games under your belt you'll be out of that range in the near future.
---
Cause event
---
How is getting tunneled failing the objective?
---
I only tap for the last smidge of a gen when ruin is still up. 
---
Better to spend a tiny bit longer finishing off than if I by chance get a skillcheck and have to spend even longer.
---
I try to bait survivors into using pallets; if I’m getting looped and a pallet is near by I’ll try to get the by it and act like I’m going straight for it but back of at the last second.
---
You are misunderstanding/misinterpreting some things here.
---
First of all, the majority of my playtime is in killer, probably around 2/3rds, so don't assume I simply don't understand the killers side.
---
Second, "toxic" to me means a certain type  of behaviour that leads to other people behaving badly (thus poisoning the community, like a toxin) which is definitely the case with camping, but also with stuff like t-bagging.
---
Third, I never said I do stuff like t-bagging or feel entitled to it, because I don't. I merely said I understand WHY people do it, and that I think it makes for a more effective strategy than camping, in regards of bloodpoint generation, but the clear implication being that both are bad.
---
And finally, I never purposefully implied specifically you being a rager, I said \*I\* used to be a rager, as to say I understand why a big portion of the dbd players in general put feelings over facts and don't think about what consequences their behaviour will have, or whether or not what they are doing is even the most effective course of action.
---
Wouldn't even say that myself, but thanks mate
---
That's fair and forgivable.
---
r/lostredditors
---
Ranks 10-15 have the fastest times. Anything above or below and you might as well start pitching a tent.
---
Why should you take only one Totem tho
---
They dont know what rank killer they are up against, rank 16-20 can get placed anywhere due to long ass queue times. It's the only exception to the matchmaking system. "Run less meta perks" so run shit perks that dont actually do anything. You have such a lack of understanding of this game and its insane.
---
My main issue is he speak too fast. But yeah once you unlock all the journal entries there's one of those movie clipper things in the top right that's supposed to play a cinematic (I only know this cause I have seen the cinematic on YouTube).
---
question what is the fasination with shirtless myers? i think his standard outfit looks a lot better than this new customization.
---
Yea you get cinematics for completing the entire level of the archive I believe
---
Blue woman bad
---
Is doctor the next rework? Really? I don’t dislike him, but some perks and add ins... ooh, some make me mad
---
It’s worse for Killer for me lately. I have all my survivor challenges done too.
---
In B4 black pip.
---
Does Vigil stack.?
---
Ghost face every game... I played 8 of them last night.
---

[Right on the front page...](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dr1zmk/subreddit_update_rule_8_oversaturated_content/)
---
I just do that one thing, you know. Where you move on and don't care
---
I believe it can do doable, you just need to tell your survivor mates “bro, I got a difficult challenge. I need you guys to throw the match a bit at the EGC plz”
---
Yeah we do. That’s why we bait you to throw them down. Good killers get stunned when they’re deep into a chase.
---
Every single one of them had such a bad game that they didn't do a single gen yeah sure
---
If y'all don't stop going after the Russians they gonna pull up on your block with Hillbilly like motherfucking J-12
---
Why does Tapp look like somebody's uncle
---
The event + a small player pool = wait times. I’m rank 8 and it usually takes me 3-5 minutes to get into a game.
---
Ohhhh I fucked up
---
Strange, while longer recently killer queue has always been longer for me. Anyways sorry about your apparent super long surv queues
---
If they’re at rank 19 they can expect to play against rank 19’s unless they’re in the middle of nowhere. And clearly they’re being matched against rank 20’s. Your entire argument is idiotic so I’m starting to think you’re a troll. Obviously I apply the same logic to killers, if you’re at rank 20 after a break and you play billy, nurse or spirit with strong perks you’re being an asshole too. It sounds to me like you’re just trying to defend bullying new players
---
You can only get benefit from 1 totem you can always go look for the 4 others...
---
No? Tinkerer and cruel doesnt slow the game
---
I guess since Legion got nerfed to shit, the community needs somebody to complain about. Survivors won’t stop until each killer is dirt easy to predict
---
Apparently that joke post got their attention
---
There are some killers that are better at it. For example old Legion can tunnel you and there was nothing you could do to counter it.
---
You can't tell me you find mending fun.
---
I swear it! I would bring noed and a mori because i think a group is gonna be optimal. I still get the 4k without even using either and i get called trash because of it. So, I'm trash for bringing a perk and offering that didn't help me because i didn't even need or use. I'm trash because I basically hindered myself to 3 perks and didn't use my trump card. OK
---
Sportsmanship and respect towards the other side should be taken into account. The bare minimum of not teabagging at the exit gate should be taken into account as it feels like you are being mocked.
---
Flashlight saving isn’t an example neither is pallet saving. You’ve got punished for being reckless and the survivor knows their timing. Pallet blinding isn’t toxic because you can often times punish the survivor or be able to hear the direction they went.
---
I agree. Maybe I'm crazy but I enjoy playing solo more then swf. I almost feel bad for killers when I'm in a 4 man. I also give hatch as killer to baby survivors or a good fair player who did not bm or drive me crazy.
---
Why not just don’t be toxic in general? Also, this is a popular opinion.
---
Wow its brutal, killer life makes me sleepy
---
No mither,object of obsession,pebble and head on is OP man idk what youre saying
---
I camp whenever I can force a stage 2 hook. If they're freshly hooked then my attention is best elsewhere but if I come back to them and they have about 10 seconds left before stage 2, I will make sure those 10 seconds run out before I leave. 3 hooks for a kill is much harder than people think, so I do my best to at least force struggles whenever I can.
---
It’s broke and I skip it! I like playing nurse but the last few patches have made her painfully unplayable! Plus trying to play nurse on console is a pain in the ass, BhVR needs to fix their game and also give us console players better optimization as promised! You look at nurse on PC and it’s glorious watching the game play, then you play her on console and it’s like taking a trip the landfill, turns to trash and looks the same! 
---
I’m on PS4 and the only time I see a nurse is once in a blue moon and that poor guy didn’t know how bad she is and loses horribly. Me and my SWF will let them take free hits and even a hook.
---
Yeah they pretty much do but they could have just shown a bit of the chase and them escaping through hatch.
---
I have still not encountered a gown myers :(
---
It's why I take /Lithe/ over /Balanced Landing/.  In every level there is always windows/pallets to vault over. When in some levels there is none, or almost no heights to jump from for balanced landing.
---
I would imagine the true alternative is go on a chase. If you're patrolling a 3 gen you probably found some people, and you probably smacked them, and they probably ran clear across the map. The stereotypical "toxic survivor main" probably thinks the killer should go commit to the chase once he finds the survivor. Most killers know that you don't chase this guy because the time it takes you to walk across the map is enough for the gen to get done.
---
it's not really "go stand in a corner" because you still get a potential down for following the survivor, but you're making a conscious choice to give up the objective in order to do so.
---
Yes that's their job
---
so wait just a quick question, because you like spiders would you find those videos of people popping egg sacks and all the baby spiders crawling out creepy? i get literal chills from how creeped out i get but i will admit it is cool to see spiders just sitting on your arm all peaceful, so i guess ya they can be pretty neat.
---
i don't really understand the point of ever using a mori at all if i'm being perfectly honest. i have so many mori's saved up on every killer that i literally can never justify using. like how do you say no to bloodpoint bonuses over a mori?
---
What about a hypothetical scenario where a SWF all bring toolboxes, prove thyself, brand new parts etc?
---
R
---
Every time I play survivor. Every time.
---
Myers.
---
These archives r going to take a long time at this rank lol
---
I can’t go past the first readings on any of it! If I do I get the blue screen on PS4 with a error message and it’s force closes the game and sends a report...
---
Thank you, was going for adept David a month ago or so and I bounced from lobby to lobby trying to win with no mither until I got in a match with a Demi who let me res myself once and it allowed me to save a friend off hook and escape through the exit gates. Generous killers are always appreciated
---
Ghostface, I like stealth based characters
---
yeah this is definently like my grandma
---
I am so surprised that Freddy isn't just straight up covered in cosmetics. This is Freddy Kruger we're talking about! He is like the Killer King of Memes!  
---
At least give him a jeepers creepers trench coat.
---
Yeah you're right make the killers always have the exposed effect and survivors don't get perks. Makes the killer powerful the survivors weak. I'll send this to behavior and we should see changes in a timely manner. You did a pretty good job.
---
David has 'fuck me' eyes
---
Do you want some Chocky Milk??
---
I dont think you are toxic for playing spirit, and I really think most spirit players dont play in a crappy manner. However, I do think there is something to be said about maining a killer that 90% of the population agrees sucks to play against.
---
BHVR: Needs less pallets
---
Plague should be Slayer's Epidemic, c'mon
---
love that Carcass choice
---
I am going to try and do it legit. Bloodwarden, Remember Me, Deerstalker and Infectious Fright with perma-T3 Michael (Fragrant Tuft of Hair+J.Myers Memorial) so NOED is not needed. Really looking forward to it.
---
yeah I just realized that Legion and Doctor would be broken if you have to break out of tier 3 madness while mending
---
Except Jane because she’s thicc I guess and Laurie because muh final girl
---
I’d say Myers because his addons make him versatile, but if you wanna mindgame and sneak up on people I’d say ghostface

my friend can't see red stains or the clowns gas because they're the same color as the dirt. We need colorblind settings

Originally it was 1 strong killer vs. 4 weaker survivors but because humankind has a bad track record for cooperative play they made the game so that survivors are now stronger when each is doing their own thing instead of team working, the only reason you should see 2 together is because they where just rescued and/or are healing each other.
---
This makes it harder for the killer to apply pressure because 1 person can't be everywhere the 4 single enemies are, I grant you it's tactic but instead of folding like origami BHVR should have just said: "Learn to teamwork better!"
---
Letting them go kills the fun for the survivors. I don't want a killer to let me go when I play survivor. That's almost the same thing as disconnecting

---
I can not make wraith work.  He just seems like a mouse 1 killer with no real way to deal with things.
---
I will ever remember this match with sadness, I was the Claudette going for heals chasing everybody :(
---
When its an legit strategy for killers to tunnel and camp, then gen rushing is for survivors.
---
Ha true
---
As killer, I've noticed that people do running vaults on windows when I've partially lost them already. Look behind you before when you know you're about to do a running vault. That alert has helped me quite a bit in chases. 
---
Retracing your scratch marks can also be effective but can't always be done. There are times when the scratch marks stop, and I have to retrace my steps. Gives the survivor a longer chase.
---
Obviously, look behind before you drop palettes. See if you can try looping in that palette  area to waste time.
---
Well you know that server will be full of Claudette mains! Had a shit load of them this weekend and they all just hid in the corners not doing a damn thing, except watch us all die!
---
I meant paid skins, cause It's all that matters for them, they only care for money and forget about the bug fixing.
---
Either make SWF opt-in/opt-out, or put in a bonus to bloodpoints for having to face them.
---
Look at his name, he’s a troll.
---
The plague isn't so bad, either none of you use the healing basins or all do...  
---
The problem is some people have so little faith in their survivor teammates that it's actually they that fail the group and not the other way around!
---
I don't want to be that person and I know I've complained before about the lady that writes the lore but bhvr seems to have a big team that's not so good at what they're all supposed to do... I think a smaller one but with more capable people would be so much better for them
---
I’m not good at the game by any means but as a mostly surviver player I feel like the game is easier for killers. I played like 5- 6 games the other night with some pals, as survivors, and all the games we played we got straight up dominated. We got maybe 1 gen, the rest of the time was trying to hide from the killers or get each other off hooks cause somehow they knew exactly where we were even if we weren’t in the same place for very long. I mean came straight to us, didn’t matter if we were close to the killer when they hooked a survivor or if we were far away. Granted the people I play with get their player rank down to 10 and I barely get to 14. We still all got our ass’s handed to us. Idk if it was some kind of perk the killers use but goddamn that shit is annoying lol.
---
thats why i always bring DS
---
Genrushing obviously exists. Killers job is also to kill people but camping and tunelling exists. 
---
There are perks and items that help do gens faster, you can play the game in a more altruistic way, you can do totems, search chests, there is other stuff you can do than just gens. Just because they are the main objective does not mean there is nothing else to do during the game.
---
You deserve a gold.   
---
That is insane as hell, well done &lt;3
---
Oh, ok then. Prayer beads are in themeselves ashole. They're just so broken that as soon a a spirit gets it in their. Bloodweb the use it, so yeah, O can agree with that.q
---
I'm the one who knocks... some sense in your t-bagging skull!
---
Holy shit I’ve never actually seen this in action. Does breaking a pallet even have an animation?
---
I’m guilty of playing as him all of last night. He’s just so good and consistent now.
---
Hahah i can relate so much with the second picture
---
Lol I don’t have DS, yes that’s BS
---
So you'd rather them play a weaker killer, not have "fun" the whole point of a game, and still shit on these noobs. Or other way round you'd rather survivors use shitter perks but still shit on the killer because perks wont make a change to their looping, the OP did dog shit, he had 6k points. He did nothing practically. But you'd rather these "bullies" stay at this rank and take longer to get out of it, rather than them just sweeping through getting back to their original rank. You're an actual potato.
---
I know when I'm tunneling because this exact line plays in my head "oh ok, you're gonna fuckin die"
---
I legit baited one guy with another guy because all I cared about was killing him, at a point I legit downed 2 guys and ignored them to keep chasing that other guy
---
Yes everyone has the same survivor and killer 
---
No if it were different that wouldn’t make much sense
---
Survivors lagging when you play killer. You lag when you play survivor. I'm seeing a pattern
---
I mean what i got, other totems are already broken and i can only get to use it once most of the match. Im not complaining jus making it as a joke.
---
I wonder how the Entity directly treats all the killers, since they all have varying degrees of success and failures. Not to mention how it specifically handles Michael since he doesn't obey it.
---
Fucking THANK YOU, I woke up this morning to this same god damn meme on the front page
---
Really ? No way it's 0.2 seconds it feels like so much longer when i play Myers
---
Play the doc for a while learn how he works, he really isn't that hard to counter once you do!
---
and yes, poor ol' Bubba needs some TLC he's so bland to play!
---
ah yeah that sucks then. if you have a friend to queue with, having one teammate with borrowed time might help (i know you were just memeing but still, it sucks to get tunneled)
---
Oh Good, a concussion
---
Simple fix would be to just make trials 20 mins.
---
Switch Version it’s always killer that takes forever to load, either way though seems like all platforms have problems at one point or the other.
---
Thats what i thought but i wasnt sure. Thanks ^-^
---
So me??
---
Shhhh....it's Carrie....
---
fair enough just use each game to learn and move on, sucks getting tunneled but yea
---
why do people hate slugging and tunneling so much its part of playing killer and in some situations its needed for winning the game as killer so shut your face
---
I don’t disagree with you. I am not saying that it is a bad example, I am saying that it is an overused example.
---
r/okbuddydbd
---
Why the watermark?
---
I discovered that build a few weeks ago and it is extremely satisfying
---
Replace Bamboozle with Spirit Fury and then it's perfect.
---
I used to leave hooks even when I knew literally everyone else was there. Turns out its 0 fun to deliberately make a bad play to appease strangers, so I stopped playing dumb. 
---
If I’m playing survivor and most of us are around the one hooked player, I’m not gonna blame the killer for sticking around when it’s clearly the better option.
---
Slowdown perks just means you need 5 mins to end chases as a killer with snares or fake pallets. Seems pretty Pepega to me if you think that stacking slows makes you a good killer.
---
Oooooohhhhhhhhhh so this is a Tier List of pairs. Okay I thought it was a Tier list of individual potential in this new game mode. And yes, that would be a terrifying combo lol.
---
I got another one for ya: Sniper Squad -&gt; Huntress + Billy
---
My assessment is not that this is a bad example. It’s just that it is overused. There are other ridiculous hyperbolic alternatives that could be used aside from just “standing in the corner”
---
this meme aged like milk
---
(Watermark is on the image i added, not the possesed feng)
---
1) when did I to speak for all killers? Did I ever say: "I am speaking for every killer main"? No! I just gave the information because i was accused being a survivor main but thats not true at all.
---
2) Noone is forcing anyone! Here is a big secret for you: the tome is optional! You can end the rift without doing any single one of those missions. If you feel yourself FORCED to do the because they are there then you have some heavy psychological problems if a game can manipulate you to play it just because its there
---
3) If there would be bonus objectives for survivors (4/1 and not 1/1 like now) queue times would be better, if one does not want to play survivor then dont do it and you will not get those rewards but there are some people who might do it and those people should be rewarded. 
---
you whole argument is: "There should not be more missions for survivors because I dont want to do more and I dont want that survivor get something killers dont get" Thats GREEDY and egoistic aF! YOU can not put yourself in other shoes dude. Your whole argument is about "FORCING" but everything in this game is optional maybe go see a doctor because of your addiction to complete game challanges but there are a lot people who can skip over those and still sleep at night.
---
EGOIST!
---
They should add a surrender option, so when everyone is incapacitated players have an option to initiate a surrender, if everyone agrees then the game is ended and the killer gets all the points for hooking each individual survivor to prevent slugging and game hostage taking.
---
If I see this fucking meme one more time
---
Thx lad
---
What I’m saying is that this community has lost sight of the original intent of the game. I’m not saying that killers should be able to Insta down and mori every person they down, not in the slightest. Survivors should still have tools to help survive, as a mouse has its hiding hole. This game has become is a Tom and Jerry skit. There needs to be a fear of the killer.
---
Getting caught is failing their objective
---
I just saw something about that his morning from a youtuber. He said that he had tried it a few times with a friend and said that they only noticed maybe half the time.
---
I was spamming my best killer, Wraith, this morning just to get more bloodpoints before the event ended.
---
What I basically do is I will do a totem in the starting and keep a lookout for others and remember where they were. 
---
Everytime Killer comes near me looping somebody, I will intercept, take a hit, most of the time killers will ignore me after that to get their main guy, otherwise escape and locker heal myself.
---
Then do another totem to rinse and repeat, you get chase points, heal points, escape points, protection hit points while reducing killer assets at the same time.
---
Cleansing is fine in some cases, such as at very end of trial or on super large maps if you do it in an area where all gens popped so killer wastes time to go get corrupt purge.
---
Its also fine on maps like Game where its easy to block LoS and the pallets are often super safe. It is not fine to cleanse on maps with low walls and open sightlines like shelter woods, gas heaven or yamaoka estate and obviously never cleanse if its near start of trial.
---
Also if 1 guy cleanses its often better to just cleanse from then on because she will already have access to corrupt purge and you cleansing doesnt really do anything.
---
The legendary Zimbabwe Bubba
---
Well.....Freddy was *England* right? Who played Freddy....*Robert Englund*...
---
It’s real. But that doesn’t mean the survivors are to blame, it’s more of a problem with the game itself.
---
Yeah, should have done that. Would have fit better for the purpose. Mistakes were made.
---
You're cute, try to play Doc or Clown in red ranks
---
Ghostface seems pretty versatile when I play him. Stalking mid chase is pretty decent.
---
I know how to counter the doctor . I p-3 him. I'm not saying he doesn't need a rework I'm just saying leatherface needs it more.
---
Just apply pressure baby killer /s
---
It's Stephen King's tweet, I posted a link and it did that
---
It does. You can watch some Monto vids on the build. It’s basically 1-2 BREAK.  Honestly, using both barely makes a difference with Brutal Strength. They all stack, but it’s barely much faster with everything mixed in. You’re better off just using the purple with Brutal Strength.
---
Ds sucks. Whenever I bring it no one camps or tunnels. Then when I take it off I promise they all camp and tunnel. Just my luck.
---
Depends on the cosmetic she’s wearing, and you have to be pretty close to see it
---
Make him a little taller than Plague and he'd be terrifying!!
---
Outside of the weird lag from dedicated servers, Huntress can only hit 1 survivor with 1 hatchet.
---
Plague gets a constant stream of damage that can harm all survivors around her. Her corrupt purge is way better than hatchets which is why it's temporary
---
Ghostface because you can tier 3 forever without running out of survivor juice.
---

My unpopular opinion is that if you DC for any reason you are the cancer of this game. For all the bitching I hear about Spirt or NOED I still get people who will just DC no matter what killer I play or perks I use.  A person who DCs sucks at this game, has no balls and you should have no say in anything.  I could not tell you how many times I force myself to remember names so I don't play them again. Not for me you see but for the other survivors so they won't have a 3 man to go through.  Sad.   I don't camp. I don't tunnel. I rarely ever use NOED and I will still get DCed on. Don't @ me with I'm lagging or maybe they just drop. No. They got out played and quit out of rage/ embarrassment or my fav. To give a friend the hatch just to deny me points. Sorry about the rant.
---
Also, if you want to believe the games are canon (even though they aren't), he *also* survived being shot and going through an entire Jigsaw facility, complete with rusty needles, glass, and endless amounts of traps, including poisonous ones and an explosive collar (fun fact: Pighead was there, and so was Amanda, but she wasn't Pighead).
---
those posts by just existing degrade the quaity of the subreddit and make browsing it a worse experience, same reason why post-game screenshots arent allowed. They're effortless to make and just waste space.
---
Gen destroyer doc on the game map laughs at you.
---
It's also worth pointing out that kills aren't the only objective. There are 3 more scoring categories if you want to "do good" and get alot of points. Like gatekeeper which is scored based on how many gens left/regressing
---
I want to camp you then tell you it doesnt exist and it's my only objective.
---
Haven’t played Hag in awhile because I found her really easy and went on to get other adept killer achievements. But I went back to hag yesterday and ohhh man did I get hate mail just because I was pretty much bouncing around chasing all of them and getting people hooked and zooming somewhere else. Add to that I had perk to see people healing and I got two DC’s and a Claudette saying reported me then continued to spam messages after saying I’m a camper noob lag connection hacker AND farming for points once I started being friendly after I got everyone to two hooks each. Can’t make anyone happy!
---
you are about the 1,000,000th person to post this
---
I swear it's like the scene in spider man "what's this 100 bucks, but I beat the guy! The match for was for 3 minutes, you beat'em in 2. Now get out of here."
---
Better overall: Myers.
---
Better due to shitty game mechanics:  Ghostface.   Breaking him out of stealth is beyond fucky in how it works.   Sometimes you can break him out by seeing his coat tail from across the map, and others you can stare at him 2 feet away and it doesn't even count it as seeing him.
---
I have loads of useless bone splinters, even though I ALREADY HAVE LEATHERFACE! THANKS BHVR
---
I love it
---
So skinny dip in cement or mud then?
---
I always used small game for noed after it activated. Used it at the start for ruin.
---
i guess i'm exceptionally rare
---
If they would stop nerfing all the killers to the ground maybe gen rushing would not exist. They nerfed pig for crying out loud lol. And nurse turned into dog shit on console since they nerfed her. Only good killers left in the game are spirit and trapper. At least on PS4 that is. And now they are about to nerf spirit. Mark my words
---
I literally had a Steve do that, he cleansed, saved my disgusting sick ass, then cleansed again. I think he cleansed like 10 times that match all of which he was never broken yet either. subsequently the rest of us had to cleanse as well.
---
Fortunately the Plague was a baby so 3 of us got out still.
---
Sometimes, I can't find the last few gens for the life of me. It makes it harder also if the gens is where the survivor is looping the killer. I likely won't go there unless I know for sure there are generators there.
---
I think teachables shouldn’t be a thing and survivors should be forced to play with their unique perks.
---
You are not entitled to the hatch.  But if you are the last survivor with me as killer and point at a hook I'll give you hatch.  So don't wiggle.
---
Came with receipts lol
---
nono, the Huntress can hit multiple people *at once*
---
yoinking this, thank you for your service
---
Or just a robert englund freddy would be fine too. I hated that remake
---
Okay, its time to stop reposting this crap
---
Its previously yoinked... lol
---
Gonna post this on every post I see with this.
---
Say my name
---
*tunneling killer who still manages to let all 4 of us go*
---
You're God damn right
---
A lot of the backstories to the killers have bad fathers, where in reality a very common precursor to serial killers is an abusive mother.  I found that interesting.
---
Wow so quirky dead format, no editing and great cropping, ohhhhh and spongebob, daring arent we?
---
Yeppers.
---
Don't care much for adrenaline but can see why some would be annoyed by it.
---
I am a killer main but never run it as a killer, as a survivor I think NOED is pretty bad, really annoying to have 1 totem missed which causes instadown and it doesn't really play into many builds, always seems like a cheap last resort v-v
---
Got into 1 game and had 2 survivors dc, so i just farmed with the others. Waste of time if i can't even play a proper game
---
I’m not gonna lie, this is so stupid but it made me laugh l o u d
---
So you’re telling me you think that making 80% of tome missions survivor and 20% of tome missions killer without even making killer missions worth 4x as much is a fair, healthy change? And also this MIGHT lower queue times for as long as the archives are here but this will just result in even more survivors who are just trying to complete tome missions that will dc when things go south. So it MIGHT work to lower queue times, albeit in an incredibly unhealthy way, and then when the archives go away things will go back to how they used to be, this is not a good solution.
---
So I was a survivor main but after playing with Killer due to the Archive challenges. I feel like I’m slowly slipping into the bottom categories. Since my killer level is at 19 and I’m just torturing all the noobs. But my level 10 survivor ass knows all the tricks so rip peasants.
---
*Ruin gets taken out instantly*
---
*Isn’t using Billy, Nurse, or Spirit*
---
*4 gens down and it’s only been 3 minutes*
---
*They neglect cleansing*
---
*No-Ed and Blood Warden*
---
;3
---
Depends on what you mean by better i guess.
---
Just killing all 4 survivors by any means? Then myers wins with his strong addons (tombstone piece, or infinite T3).
---
A consistent build that gives you lots of BP and pips? Ghostface with power recovery addons it is.
---
Being sneaky spoopy? I'd say it's a tie. While spoopy myers is a ton of fun in the early game, the longer the game goes on and survivor understand what to do it drags out.
---
Sneaky ghostface with stalk addons is less fun initially, but stays about the same.
---
Should just slice the survivor in half at this point.
---
Thats the one. Was not aware Fog Whisperers were given a charm, just wanted to make sure was no secret unlock or something.
---
An evil plan is to get that extra 500 by leaving a dull and running to it after gens done.
---
Viable at which rank? 15? Because you have nothing to stop generators and long chases with that build
---
Me and my group end up screaming this before every Hex totem now, just to emphasize that popping that haunting grounds was worth, no matter what.
---
Brb gonna go make these in Minecraft now
---
I started playing as a killer main for 3 weeks before I figured out what tunneling was #GameIsHard
---
Yeah, I could tell they were a swf in the lobby, but I didn't want to wait for another match. I thought that maybe they were just memeing and wanted to have fun with their friends.
---
You can see how well that turned out for me lol.
---
Lmaooo
---
YES this is how you're supposed to cleanse-near finished gens at the corner of the map. Most people act like cleansing is a do or die thing, but it's really not if done correctly
---
This isn't a meme though. It seems to  be a legitimate tier list just with comedic tier names
---
It couldn't be above it. Like opposite of borrowed time
---
Just curious: In your opinion, does that include when someone DCs on their death hook because they were tunnelled for no real reason? What about if someone is being slugged the entire time just so the killer can try and find the last survivor because they “need the 4K”? 
---
I’m not saying these are always the case for DCs (they usually aren’t), but it does happen. And I think on some occasions, a DC is warranted.
---
I’m thinking I’ll derank to get shitty survivors and killers to make this stuff happen.
---
I've literally stopped playing the game because how long I have to wait for a queue for killer an just get dced because survey have bad internet (ive waited for almost 3hours one day)
---
Swing through it too. Worst case is a stun but best case is a smack
---
In the middle of the game i freeze for 15 seconds and then get imediatelly DC-d.
---
Wtf pls help im going crazy.
---
Always have a three gen in mind as a win strat.
---
You took off your trap that’s pretty toxic to pig. She spent all that time to put a trap on you and you say no thanks ),:
---
I also depip, lose my item and offering
---
It's so fun to stalk a survivor when they don't notice you. Sadly it typically only works on potatoes.
---
She's not bad, just currently broken making her unfair and unfun to play against.
---
People okay here pretend they're "mind gaming" when they're literally just completely invisible with no indicators and no sound (or if you're close, a completely non directional sound to tell you what you already know, you're about to get hit) so it's pretty stupid.
---
She's currently very prevalent in high ranks because even against high rank killers it's easy kills and easy farm, so it get tiring facing the same broken killer over and over, hence the frequency of posts.
---
The issue is that it's not our fault. The devs should hotfix issues like this. They're kind of absurd and it sucks that we always have to wait months between fixes...
---
Add-ons are what they're reworking. They may make changes to his base kit too, but main focus is add-ons
---
So cute! Thank you for sharing!!
---
I've done this to too many survivors, I always feel bad. I'm sorry! It was the closest hook!
---
Anyone else feel like the word Toxic has lost it's meaning?
---
If only we had emotes for killers where we can facepalm or shake our heads when a survivor complains lol
---
I get into games instantly as Killer. Survivor games take 10 minutes most of the time.
---
That's what it basically takes for genrushing to be a thing and not a self inflicted wound by a killer playing unoptimally.  9/10 it's a term misused by killers playing poorly and not attempting gen pressure.
---
Killer: "Filthy gen rushers!
---
Me: "Bruh I solo'd 3 gens and didn't see you once."
---
Dude, sell the hats on the TF2 market, make a... Killing.
---
Yeah I met 3x red ranks 1 green. Doesn’t matter what I do. My discordance keep popping. I hit it and if I chase a survivor off a gen I can be sure the gen is getting worked on. Any hit will get recovered so quickly. Oh well....
---
Yeah let me stand still and zoom to check for a slight hardly noticeable glow, in mid chase to see if the killer is behind me already or not, right?
---
He’s rank 20. A survivor can still double pip without using strong perks and items/addons against baby killers. These builds would actually slow down their pipping by making the games go too quick, the only reason to run this is to make a killer hate this game. And if you don’t find it fun to play any killer that isn’t top tier that’s your problem, I’m not saying you can’t play them. But accept the fact that if you’re sweating like these survivors at rank 20 when you should be at a higher rank you’re being a dick. At this point you’re either an idiot or a troll, and there’s no point continuing this regardless of which you are
---
Thats great! I wish my costume had been that cool!
---
Let's have monto make a video about this
---
I’ve seen 3 iterations of this meme in the past month
---
A survivor that isnt a stereotypical complainer, this is my reaction to the most hated/used perks:
---
Ruin? We gentapping because my lazy ass doesn't feel like trying to find the totem.
---
NOED? Its funnier when I find out through someone else.
---
Pop/OC/Lullaby? Oh well, guess I'll gen rush
---
Nurse's? Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck
---
Blood Warden? Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck
---
Thanks for the trapper part A_person42069
---
A good rule of thumb is always to be exceptionally wary when you see someone run a "low tier" killer.
---
If you're lucky, they're doing a chase daily or they just enjoy that killer's cosmetics.
---
If you're unlucky, you'll have been matched against That One Killer who is determined to prove to the world that their beloved low tier character is godlike.
---
Wraith is low tier but there's nothing funny about getting matched against one running double Windstorm (or Play with Your Food and stealth add-ons) alongside Haunted Ground and Make Your Choice.
---
Discordance, BBQ, Pop, and Enduring is what I use, replace discordance with spirit fury for extra sweat.
---
Thank you! Cheers
---
I agree. A lot of my good matches were against legion than any other killer
---
I was referring to the loops where the pallets already thrown and the high rank survivors pretend to vault, but just keep running. Don't fall for the fake vault
---
He always did rely on family.
---
Nah much better to get the 5 during the game so you don't give them that initial free down on whoever they were chasing when last gen popped or whoever they catch at the handle early.
---
Freddy already has like 5 songs written for his movies.
---
Dream warriors is a banger
---
1. You never directly said you speak for all Killers, but your wording made you seem like that’s what you thought.
---
2. It is optional, sure, but not for those who plan on unlocking things. So you know... literally everyone. You see, the Rift is very grind-y. Doing Tome challenges helps with that. There’s also the extra BPs and that cool charm.
---
3. Yes, that’s true, but you’re not listening to me. So please, for the love of God, bear me out on this part: people who play Survivor for the challenges would only play to get their challenges done. They won’t actually play the game. They’ll let their team die if it means getting their challenge done. And in a game like this where teamwork is everything, that can be very bad. 
---
You seem to have forgotten when I mentioned that I main Killer. I play Killer almost exclusively. My argument revolves around fairness and not forcing completionists to do extra for the same reward. And it is not a bad thing to want to fully complete things. For example, I like to complete jigsaw puzzles. Does that mean I’m addicted to puzzles? I want to be mature, but you seem to have started ranting at the end because you simply cannot understand. And you call me an egoist. So I’ll return the favor...
---
Kindly go fuck yourself, you immature, irrational, insufferable cunt. And don’t reply, because I know you’ll say something biased and continue to personally attack me like an immature asshat. Had a bad day, dickhead.
---
Absolutely. I’m devotion 3 and I still need to get perks from 3 survivors and 3 killers, not to mention actually getting the perks on all my killers. The grind is insane and I’m glad they made more perks per bloodweb but that doesn’t help the grind for new perks, just the grind for perks you already unlocked
---
Isn't the reason why Quentin face change is even happening is because the actor agreed to give them his likeness?
---
Changing freddy would require permission from the franchise rights owners.
---
* Tier lists of any kind. This includes meme tier lists and personal perk/killer rankings.
---
It's 'asymmetrical' as in 1v4. It still needs to be balanced or else everyone is just going to chose the strong side and there will be no game.
---
Imagine thinking you're a good player because no one can see or hear you, lol.
---
If you walk through a pallet it's your own fault
---
imo survivors are easier. just level them to have a build (incase of character specific dailies) and have 1 "main" that has them all.
---
Killers are completely different because each one acts different and plays different.
---
Usually I'm solo queing so that isn't an option. Because you know, swf is t0xic
---
No, I’m good on chocky milk.
---
No, please. No.
---
No!
---
NOOOOOOOOOO!
---
If the wraith is mindful of hiding his body shimmer, he can still sneak up on good survivors. But spinechill is the bane of his poor existence.

The goal is to kill 4 survivors so good luck doing that while camping, maybe that'll work in the rank 10s and up with the baby survivors. It could still be a legitimate strat if you have a 75-99% gen that you kicked and two hooked survivors nearby and you "proxy camp". But damn did survivors have to fuck up to let that happen
---
Cool. Is this for like art class? Or computer or something?
---
yeah some were unique and funny, but most didn't even make my nostrils move
---
Same as you except I have been unable to play Killer at all. My longest queue before giving up was 20 minutes.
---
Kind of lol.  I'd rather play him then Doc or LF at this point.
---
You can save up map offerings and only play doc on the game. Sure you might not always win but I have a pretty solid record of 4 kills at red ranks with this build.
---
I always thought billy and bubba would be hilarious. One pressures the map the other camps hooks Lmfao
---
Thanks, &lt;3
---
The game's been pretty fun for me so far, so I'm not planning on quitting anytime soon.
---
Why not Spirit Fury instead of Bamboozle?
---
I think they just wanted it done quickly. But yeah, the guy talks way to quickly.
---
Hmm.. I think that's stretching it a little bit. Not getting caught during a trial is the only way for a survivor to succeed at their objective?
---
I mean, a survivor's ultimate objective is to escape. The developers didn't balance the game so the survivor has the opportunity of never getting caught. There's a reason why killers are faster than survivors.
---
There are also times when players will strategically take a down (to prevent the camping or tunneling of someone else). Is that considered failing your objective when you help someone else escape a situation like that?
---
Is it really slugging if another survivor is right in my face, one after another? Everytime I downed someone, I had someone in eyesight or just about there, should I just not chase them?
---
well you see you can still loop a plague while broken. but her corrupt purge is a lot harder to avoid so you go down much faster at fully health against a powered up plague then you would if you were merely broken
---
It never had meaning.
---
Bbq,run or corrupt, Moniter and abuse and pop goes the weasel.
---
Billion and one posts on this topic.  Throw a rock at the sub and you'd have hit one of the others on here where all the opinions have been shared ad nauseam and there's been no new developments with either perk so nothing will have changed.
---
replace lithe with head on because jane and head on are good
---
all the challenges are possible hypothetically, but I’m just wondering how realistic it is to want people to get 3 safe unhooks after the doors have been opened in one match.
---
Well at least you could go full Tremors 3 on her xD
---
Imagine not hearing a TR
---
Rework clown. Hie is irrelevant because Freddy does everything he does better.
---
The classic meta BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Sprit Fury build works out pretty well for him.
---
Destroying pallets with your chainsaw also counts for spirit fury, so it's pretty powerful on him.
---
I know that camping wont help with the true objective but man it's about the most annoying playstyle. That and killers waiting for you to get unhooked so they can hook the person who saves you. It is a playstyle it's just not fun for anyone else. Same as when all the gens go off super fast. You can do everything right and still be rushed if a team is coordinated enough.
---
I’ve tried actually discussing the game on this sub but if it’s not memes or universally agreed on opinions and hate then nobody gives a damn. The only place you can hope to discuss the game in detail is the Forums.
---
HEY LEAVE LIL GHOST ALONE FAM
---
I get confused without seeing his hat on.
---
That is a very clever thing to do.
---
I at least wait 5 mins. I guess that how it is outside the US? I'm EU.
---
But the obsession would have the terror radius meaning that unless you lucked out and found somebody outside of their terror radius the bleed out timer would still be paused.
---
Furtive chase would probably be a better fit than dark devotion.
---
Honestly, just don’t let the toxicity get to you. I only play hag in red ranks, sometimes legion, which nobody like to go against either. But I usually have a lot of fun, and get either a 4K or 2K. The more you let the toxicity get to you the worse you will do. Have fun and play who ever you want (: !!
---
*vaults over pallet*
---
what ?
---
you think i'm just gonna stand there and break it ?
---
Infectious Fright, Knockout, BBQ, Enduring
---
Actually no, it doesn't seem to work like that. Because technically they're emitting their own terror radius. For whatever reason their timer will go down. Everyone who is hit. Even if they're in the radius of the obsession
---
I completed the full first challenge list and have listened to all of the archives that it currently provides. I think there's 1 full set you can listen to. I can confirm that there are no videos to watch.
---
I agree, it's bizarre. I'm not sure if it's a camera angle thing or what. I'll swing at someone as a killer, swear to god it's going to hit, then nothing. But I'm playing survivor, I see them swing, hear the miss sound, think, "Nice try, bud!" and them I'm bleeding.
---
I made a post about this a few months ago and got downvoted to oblivion. The memes are fucking annoying.
---
Yeah. It was totally killer sided when 
---
- One toolbox could sabotage all hooks on the map, where they never respawned
---
- Entity didnt block windows
---
- Bloodlust didnt exist
---
- Killers couldnt damage generators
---
- No fall stagger for survivors
---
- no medium vaults, if you were holding shift it was always a fast vault
---
- we’ll make it + botany  healed yourself faster than a killers hit cooldown
---
and way more
---
Okay so it's not just me who has had weird issues cloaking/decloaking? I got flashlight burned earlier, chased down the survivor who did it, and right when I was about to get a hit I magically cloaked and had to decloak first.
---
No thats rank 20 dweet and jake when they hesr a demogorgon roar for the first time
---
Yes! I just don’t prestige because it’s kind of pointless except for the cosmetics
---
I'm new. Can someone ELI5 what map pressure means vice other types? Or link me to an older post that does so? And how killers 'exert' map pressure?
---
That seems like an oversight by the devs but it's an oversight that I want to use.
---
Thanks for the build idea.
---
Right in front of my salad?
---
Hello There
---
I also completed all the challenges and I got a video of The Alchemist using the putrid serum.
---
No you can’t
---
You gotta use them on a unit with a lot of attack and defense.
---
Dedue absolutely shreds with them.
---
General kenobi
---
Because we only talk in extremes here.
---
Competent survivors will expect the Spirit Fury and start slamming pallets early, though. I prefer Enduring and Bamboozle alone for being a monster in chases.
---
Oh yeah that has happened to me as well it was very bizarre it’s only happened once but you described it exactly right.
---
Yes, there are black shorts underneath.
---
I’d say demogorgon or Freddy. Spirit is best meta though
---
Yes, it's a good option too. I prefer to block the window and force the survivor to drop the pallet. A good survivor can loop really well just with windows... but yes, for the purpose of the meme, Spirit Fury would have been better.
---
*visible happiness*
---
I find it very easy to dodge, wait until you see and hear the animation, wait until the killer has a straight line of sight on you then turn 90 degrees and he will zip past you. It might just be baby killers but I have not been hit by it yet.
---
Lore wise and game wise are two very different things. The killers wouldn't actually be around if they were underperforming, the Entity would just replace them.
---
During the game I thought they were just goofing around. I assumed I wouldn't do well against them so I was happy just to chase them off gens and get a single hit on one of them. It was only afterwards when I saw their perks that I thought they were intentionally targeting noob killers. 
---
It's all good tho, in the end it's just one game out of many.
---
Spirit is fun, powerful, and has good perks.
---
Other fun dlc killers include: Pig, Myers, Ghostface, Legion, and Doctor.
---
Other powerful dlc killers: Freddy.
---
If you want good perks: 
---
Myers (All his perks are good depending on the killer)
---
Plague (Corrupt is a good replacement for Ruin, Infectious Fright is great for snowball)
---
Clown (Pop Goes The Weasel is great, and Bamboozle shuts down god windows)
---
What bizarre pocket dimension are you trapped in?  Killer Qs for me are like 15 minutes +.
---
Killer mains are angels and can't be toxic unlike survivor mains. 
---
Unless its Ghost Face or Pig they can tea bag
---
I dunno that can hurt a lot of creative builds that can be made because all the perks are exclusive. Maybe only have one be exclusive or something to make the survivor unique but not limiting builds as hard. Finding a perfect solution to the perk problem isn't easy simply because of how its already been set up.
---
Honestly if it was 4 people that knew what they were doing, they could've gone in with no perks and items and stomp most killers at that rank
---
You are a bold one
---
Yay im rare
---
At this point, Killers, Never use your power, its toxic
---
Now we have conformation that he is a real bad man. Breaking Evans jaw for talking back and calling all his workers maggots and so forth
---
You're new here, huh?
---
Makes you wonder how the killers are tortured.  Maybe they are forced into a game where a bigger, meaner entity hunts them down?  
---
Alternatively, what if the survivors are forced into a killer role after winning to hunt and stalk down like hot dogs for food?
---
Ah, this glitch for the 100th time
---
Damn. Alright. Thank you
---
Now you know what it's like playing killer for the entire rest of the year
---
Welcome to the club
---
How are your temps? It could possibly be an overheating issue.
---
Hey, if it's close enough, they going in the basement.
---
I play on PS4?
---
GHOSTFACE IS BETTER THEN BOTH
---
My killer times are longer than survivors
---
Weird. I don't even have a single option for it anywhere. I can listen to other notes or go back to the challenge list or the rift progression bar and that's it.
---
Oh ok
---
The Trapper's lore states that his dad had him kill workers that stepped out of line.
---
I completely agree my dude
---
Yea I am US. Not sure you get queued up with EU players only or it might put you in the US pool too if it takes longer to find a game.
---
Stuns have been failing to uncloak properly some of the time. I’ve played a lot of wraith the past few days and you have to check whether it says cloak/uncloak, not whether you’re actually visible on your screen after you get stunned while cloaked. I’ve been pallet stunned a few times, won a chase, and then realized I didn’t really win it because I was still cloaked and needed to uncloak for the hit.
---
What a shame.
---
THIS
---
its okay, you admitted it. have my upvote for your willingness to admit to your mistakes
---
True, that's smarter. I've literally chosen to not go to the basement to hook on the event hook though.
---
What? I’m literally playing right now. Rank 2 killer clown. Dude as I type this I already found a lobby. That’s gotta be like 20 seconds.
---
Disclaimer: I know that BHVR wants to have a faster matchmaking so stuff like this happens from time to time and that's okay I don't mind. (But secretly deep inside I still feel hurt).
---
Ayy-man
---
my temps are average, even when i was streaming dbd earlier ran between 65 degrees to 71
---
and my cpu was a solid 55/56 degrees
---
Lithe is pretty bad on some maps too though, The game has like 6 windows in total, and there’s a few others.  Although pallets work which is nice of killers don’t break them
---
There is no add on in this game thats stronger than or as strong as Prayer Beads. Not a single one that's even close.
---
*Basement Trapper intensifies*
---
Keep in mind, right now survivors are playing like shit due to 2x bloodpoints which brings out rusty players, and archive challenges/event gens that promote very suboptimal play, so your experience might be influenced by it.
---
That being said, I think trapper is actually pretty strong and well balanced, but has some really hard counters, like maps for example, and is one of the hardest killers to learn, due to the amount of experience and foresight required to effectively use his traps.
---
"Get a load of this ~~guy~~ baby killer."
---
Yeah your temps are completely fine. This sounds like a really weird issue and I’m completely stumped.
---
Bischey with that pure meta build though.
---
The difference is that it's a shitty meme that has had 12 a day posted for nearly a year.
---
I mean it's all in the eye of the beholder. These are rough ideas yes but the idea was to mainly make every surv and killer play more uniquely (Killers already do, Survs are just a skin).
---
25% slower would be in the sense of pushing him more towards his chainsaw, but also allowing him to be able to still swing. I forgot he would also still have a initial burst on his charge so his first couple of seconds he would increase in speed then start to slow down to his normal speed, meaning he can use it to catch up to you and have a faster cool down BUT have to hit you twice still, if his chainsaw runs out/turns off but you're right there he has options! But if you use it as your main way you suffer a penalty.
---
The Meyers one I felt could be interesting, because he likes to stalk and wait, he'd still have the same amount of time to down survs but it'd take just as long to build up every time. He would also have infinite stalking on survs (Right now they drain down to a point where he no longer gets any energy on them). And as more gens pop his charge time gets faster and faster, when it's the last gen he can ramp it up pretty quickly meaning he's a viable endgame killer without NOED.
---
I work evenings and usually only get to play at night afterwards, usuallly after 11pm and this is how 80% of my lobbies look like
---
I see this comment in every subreddit.
---
Yeah, ps4 servers suck. Weird though how that dude was the only person in a whole swf that acted like it was my fault. When I'm experiencing it as a survivor, myself as well as all my friends I'm playing with experience it and it isn't just me. You can take your implied assumption of it being "just me" and fuck yourself with it though.
---
Lol for me it’s in reverse! I am a rank 8-9 and get matched up with r15-20’s that are below lvl30...
---
No she can't. That was a bug on the PTB. Last year I think
---
Did you mean to put play with your food instead of save the best for last?
---
Does he scream "Raw!" When hitting a survivor as demo-gordon?
---
Why would you be able to do it in kyf. You don't earn bp in kyf
---
Just saying if survivors lag when you play killer you're a bad host because bad internet.
---
I face camp if I have literally not hooked anyone yet in the match and the gates are already open. There's nothing else I can do to get a kill, but even then, the other 3 survivors can usually unhook the person if they all rush at once.
---
I face camp if it's a SWF who T-bag all game and take turns flashlight stunning me and all use borrowed time or adrenaline. Still, they usually get unhooked anyway.
---
I face camp if someone is hacking and I finally manage to get them on a hook, but their teammates will still try to unhook them, then flame me after the match for face camping even if the person was speed hacking or similar.
---
And I face camp if a survivor is trolling their teammates by sandbagging or body blocking. Again, the other survivors will stop at nothing to unhook said troll.
---
Otherwise, I specifically make sure to hook, then yeet unless a survivor is literally barrelling toward me before the animation is finished.
---
What if I run Head On with Balanced Landing?
---
A
---
I'm actually getting frustrated that I can no longer get killer games anymore. I'm playing DBD after close to a year off, so my ranks reset all the way to 20. 
---
PC player, US East. Rank 6 survivor - levelled up with my bf who was much higher than me when I re-entered.
---
Rank 20 killer. I have not been able to get into a game since Friday and the longest I waited was last night close to midnight, 25 minutes. It's absolutely frustrating.
---
This alone is one of then main reasons I love playing the demogorgon.
---
Doc can still plan and force out a 3-gen scenario if he plays defensively. I do plan to 3-gen in all my doctor matches but I'm soft 4 or 5 genning and as gens pop I get more and more defensive with my "desired" 3-gen until I'm hard 3-genning. 
---
Overcharge Unnerving Distressing Doctor can make a 3-gen borderline unwinnable for survivors and result in a situation where the match doesn't end until survivors manage to power through the last gen somehow, or get reckless, make a mistake (or flat out give up) and get hooked and eventually sacrificed.
---
I am a survivor main :P I have played for around 350 hours now and I haven't touched killer a single time. Now I am trying it for the first time and trapper seems a fun beginner killer to me. So yeah I have no idea what a good build is, any tips would be helpfull!
---
Please, yes. I have wanted this for so long. Hopefully they make it so when you prestige, all items and offerings are sold for a 1/3 of the price, with no 1m cap on bloodpoints. (Like how they refunded bp for accounts reset to level 1)
---
LMAO
---
we should be able to sell them to the observer for his “research”
---
They both came out with their videos within an hour of eachother, he didn't copy him.
---
Nah dude you absolutely nailed it on the head
---
well obviously those would have to be done in normal matches but ones like "sacrifice all 4 survivors in the basement in a single match" seem a little unlikely unless you have some stupid ass survivors. im not saying it cant be done just that it'll be a major pain in the ass
---
I'm relieved to know I'm not the only one.
---
Is the goal really a 4K? I find I'm happy as long as I safety pip. Dev's also claim the game was balanced around 2 sacrifices 2 escapes, implying the gens are going to be completed at SOME point.
---
I think the idea of having a 2x bp event is not only to just give out more bp to ease the grind, but to invite more players to play the game. Also, more people would be inclined to buy new killers and survivors knowing that they can quickly get their teachables with the double bp event. Lastly, if players were given the ability to activate the double bp whenever they want it would negate the idea that the double bp coincides with a special event/occasion.
---
Alert, spine chill, urban, Iron will
---
Right, but pretty much ANY unit with high attack and defense would shred with any weapon, right?
---
The opposite would be more accurate
---
How about that plus coulrophobia AND nurse's?
---
Clown 
---
Good chase potential and pop goes the weasel is meta.
---
Probably spirit, but if you want to make sure people don’t rage dc and call you trash have at plague
---
Honestly, I had no idea it was overused. I have only been reading this sub for about a week or two on and off having gotten back into the game after a long time off. Standing in the corner just feels like the correct hyperbolic example; basically just akin to being told to do nothing which is what I would infer from being told I'm a camping POS for doing a genny loop.
---
Possibly.
---
Well, not everyone can do that and ruin most of the time slows down the game really well and thats what every killer needs
---
Its a “must have” perk for me
---
DRINK IT. CONSUME IT.
---
Looks like Nea's enjoying it too.
---
Forgot to add Tier 3 Micheal lunge
---
To be honest i like them all xD, but i wont be able to get them all so yeah
---
I wonder what his win rates are.
---
Don’t know why but that crying kid really gets me in the feels.
---
Cowshed der toten
---
Xbox: borrowed time didnt work. after unhooking, the killer hits my team8 and gets downed
---
Can confirm. Doctor is one of the very weird killers where perks that otherwise seem shitty or situational can be good on him. Many people hate using TR related perks on most killers since you typically want a smaller TR, but Doctor is a killer where you want your terror radius as large as possible and thus can throw on stuff like Unnerving Presence, Coulrophobia, etc.
---
I'm gonna be honest, this post is more cringe than the og comment nearly every time.
---
did feng just inject herself full of *mmmmmm* putrid serum?
---
Stop what, making comments on Reddit?
---
Lock me up, officer
---
Don't need context for that flair, either. It's just true.
---
They weren't lagging. Dude made poor choices the whole start of the game. The stupid kid sat there talking about how he's gonna report me. I gave him screenshots from the exact moments before he rage quit and told him to send those to where I'm in clear contact with his character model. But hey, apparently to him he was "10 meters ahead of me." Sure thing pal. He was mad cause he kept doing stupid shit the whole game. He made bad plays and calls it "lag." Weird how absolutely no one else had an issue. 🤷‍♂️
---
He had to see you...
---
Just cuz u disagree doesn't mean you have to downvote me :/
---
I was thinking about clown supposedly it's a really  fun killer to play
---
Lmao, nah won't do that, but nice talking there
---
Yess that would be fun
---
That's what I thinking he looked directly at me
---
art class yeah
---
I meant that also punishes unintentional DC's. My internet provider is kinda shit and they do random rolling resets, so my internet can just cut out for a minute out of nowhere. I don't think I should be punished for that given I try to make a point not to DC by choice, but it still happens., Unfortunately. They would need to find a way to tell a crash from an intentional DC, but idk how they would go about doing that...
---
Can freddy get a face rework too tho?
---
You are invited to suffer.    🍰 Join?
---
I feel like the words "camp" and "tunnel" have lost their meaning, personally.
---
I try to embrace the whole "Killer" role and just, do what I can, but every time I a survivor tries to loop me around a pallet that's next to a hooked survivor, or someone runs me all the way back to the hook and unhooks someone, all I can imagine is: "They just think I'm tunnelling/camping."
---
Now feel our pain.
---
Please stop posting this.
---
He was looking your direction when you entered the street.  How he didn't check the tires,, I don't know?
---
One question can you pip up from just doing gens? If the answer is no than that is not the survivors only objective. Just like if the killer only had to make sure the the 4 survivors died moris would give you a pip, but they don't and neither does just doing gens.
---
Two survivors escaping and two survivors dying is an equal trade basically and it makes sense thats the goal. If the game was balanced towards killers 4king easily no one would enjoy survivor killers would be overpowered. Whereas at release where four survivors with equal skill to a killer, 1 kill was outplaying one survivor 3 times or scummy playstyle.
---
N
---
Oh no...
---
Entity: Now Laurie, how did it make you *feel* when Michael murdered your only two friends and then tried to murder you and the children you were babysitting?
---
Laurie: It made me feel hurt, it made me feel scared, and it made me feel alone.
---
Entity: I see. Now, Michael, how did it make you feel when Laurie stabbed you with her DS?
---
Michael: ...
---
Entity: Now, now, no need to become hysterical, let's all just take a breath and hug it out.
---
hmmm, a bionicle clanka, you just are
---
Is this like a bad attempt at a haiku?
---
Give bill and ash guns
---
I do, I really do, although I do enjoy playing killer a lot!
---
My personal ranking:
---
Spirit, Plague, Clown. Spirit is by far the most fun to play as but is pretty OP in the current meta and will probably be nerfed in a few months. Plague pretty much puts everyone into a permanent injured state so is strong for that reason, but is otherwise an M1 killer. Clown is ultimately an M1 killer, his power needs a buff. Good clown players can be good at clown, but the payoff for hours of practice on a better killer is more worth it IMO.
---
As someone who bought the game it is their right to do with it as they wish.
---
This includes DCing
---
You cannot force me(or anyone else) to continue playing a game we bought ourselves if we are no longer having fun
---
Your situation is very close to mine, except I am US East. PC player, I started playing again only last weekend after almost a year off and I teamed up with my bf as survivor. As a result I was rank 20 in both. 
---
Levelled up to rank 6 as of last night (although some of that was solo). 
---
Rank 20 killer, my queue times are 20+ minutes before timing out or giving up, I was told to play closer to midnight, but after waiting 25 minutes I couldn't stay up anymore since I have work the next day. 
---
Post earlier in this thread is saying 45-50k players, but not sure if that's a point in time or over 24 hours.
---
why i hate people
---
I don’t understand this hate for cleansing. Did some YouTuber say that and now it’s gospel? I can understand it’s annoying when people do it before being broken. But is it not better to be two hit then one? Sure she has the range and can hit multiple people.. but as long as you don’t run with your teammates when being chased and try to keep your distance when you know she’s got the purge you’re good.
---
You go super fast add this with other fast perks and such and you can be the flash for like 60 seconds
---
4 pallet stuns in one game? Oh yeah, it’s pallet camping time
---
Undertale X Let it Die DLC confirmed
---
Could never happen.... way too OP
---
Also in the menu it looked green instead of blue :/
---
Yeah. Faking a vault is a risk you take as survivor because killers can read survivors as well. This is what makes dbd fun for a lot of people at high levels. The cat and mouse outplaying and predicting during chases. Conditioning the other player into a habit is also a strategy you can use as killer and survivor alike to further outplay them. Conditioning does take time that killers might not have though.
---
Team Vroom Vroom
---
The speed boost makes a difference. Nowhere near as good as play with your food, but it’s consistent.
---
Yes each bird count as 1
---
Exactly 0 sarcasm. When I play killer, nothing brings me more joy than BBQ showing me some 3000IQ gamer Self Caring in the corner while his team desperately tries to bang out gens without him. It’s literally like a 5th perk for killer with how much time it wastes
---
I get that it sucks to not get other players in your rank on your team, having weak links in a team based game gets frustrating. But, being a red rank survivor, even when getting above rank 10 players on my team, I will usually pip. Generally I will just carry and get a bunch of safe unhooks, and get good chase points against the killer. If you get it out of your head that you NEED to escape, you will have a good game, no matter who is on your team.
---
Good god that’s a lot
---
I fucking love this comment😂😂😂
---
Why would anyone get into a locker within hearing range of the killer?
---
I'm not really touching the premium rift until it offers skins for characters I actually use.
---
*We will be right back*
---
Imagine you’re working on a generator and this asshole of a avian steals your toolbox!
---
I really really want this to be an April Fool's skin for all killers, but instead of just sliding around with no animations, it's animated like the Toilet outfit in Saint's Row the Third, so you're hopping around, hook rolling from side to side as you run. Even better, they could let it be a year-round skin, but really obvious and loud, so it's not an advantage or something, with an idle animation to prevent you from pretending to be a normal hook. It would make it really obvious you just want to meme or farm.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Thanks! That got it working!
---
Personally good plague and clown skins are far and few between so the Halloween ones are a must I find spirit and hag are also good but a lot of long hair spirit heads are a disadvantage cause people will see you fast hag has nicer skins I think I’ll prob run the new clown skin when it drops but this one is good for now
---
Maybe a streamer who looked at chat when you crossed?
---
Indeed
---
Suspect comment is suspect.
---
Yee
---
Which item? I read that this is impossible, and that items in the rift will most likely be available for purchase later.
---
Oh sorry I misunderstood. Yeah that is weird
---
Yes, that’s the quickest way to complete the challenge.
---
Oooooh you’re a pretty salty baby aren’t ya.
---
That challenge was from a holiday trophy pack on console awhile ago. Probably on steam as well. Definitely possible but very rare.
---
*survivor tbags once*
---
Me with my new ability called Tunnel Vision:
---
Has nothing to do with it. I'm in US, and Killer cues ARE long.
---
We make jokes about it on the Discord alot. 
---
This player is just either lucky or in some wierd limbo.
---
*The Entinity is Pleased.*
---
36k but nice try.
---
I imagine the Entity doing its spiral of death above a hook, but it's really just grating cheese and waiting for you to say thanks so it can stop.
---
Lying, you are. Overdosed on ketamine, you have.

I decided to play pig for the second time since she came out and got hawkins lab, got all 4 down and masked because they kept trying to run between hook saves and the same machine -lvl2 so no perks on my end to mess with them- and they all popped minutes in and i thought “boy i guess i really did a good job in that game” and the game was clearly disagreeing based on the rating.
---
Dude it’s so easy to get people to the basement run agitation,iron grasp,mad grit and another perk like monstrous shrine or another it’s easy
---
“I’m your boyfriend now Nancy!” 
---
I say this so much while playing this game. &gt;.&lt;
---
12th
---
Reminds me of when I got disconnected as I was hit into the escape
---
That last point. It is the survivors objective to escape the trial alive. If you purposefully try and get downed even for a good cause you are just sacrificing and hurting your chance of survival which is your objective. So I would say yes, you would be failing your objective in game by doing that.
---
Oh no im in limbo. Oh fuck.
---
Oh yeah. If it’s on first hook and I walk around seeing nothing happening before they reach stage 2, I’m totally coming back. That just seems natural.
---
That’s the only one I feel is too hard same with sacrifice 3 people it seems very unlikely unless it’s like multiple games
---
&gt;super fast
---
Isn't basically the base killer speed?
---
The map I want to be added most to DBD is the Good Guy factory from Child’s Play 2. It’s honestly more important to me than a related survivor or killer. That’d probably be the brightest map I could see actually fitting the games aesthetic.
---
...how?
---
I actually used that ultra rare add-on earlier that randomly opens a trap every 30 seconds somewhere on the map, and I got people walking into traps left and right, and they were usually traps I never picked up, so they were in random places. It was actually great!
---
It's fine, you said it was a WIP so it was just a suggestion for the finished product! :)
---
But-
---
Food Everywhere- Every 60 seconds stuff yourself with food and run slower by 50%
---
dual wielding hatchets dam son
---
Strangely enough, I use him for farming since it's so damn easy to body block and then spam bell rings so they get the point.
---
If I wanted to actually kill a team, I don't see it being that hard at all. And I'm a frigging Pig main.
---
I was thinking Plague Ghostface could be pretty strong. Plague spits on everyone and makes them permanently injured and Ghostface just walks around one shotting people in stealth mode. I think you could pair a ton of killers with him that are good at getting the first hit but struggle actually downing.
---
Imagine Legion having 8 targets to run around smacking people pretty much permanently in Frenzy mode and then Ghostface just follows him around cleaning up people trying to mend and heal.
---
Oh my god
---
*Haddonfield
---
u go 4.6m/s fast, that's standard killer speed, so u are not super fast. And what Perks do u wan't to pair it with to be strong? It's just the Killers regular movement speed so it doesn't do anything.
---
What are we supposed to see here?
---
No I’m talking like rewrite history fast
---
I still remember how I somehow killed half of a four-man rank 12 SWF as a rank 19 Spirit, and one of them was streaming on Twitch, so I had the audio for the comms post-mortem. It was in Spanish, so I didn't understand what they said, but the screams of "OH SHIT SHE'S HERE" were very clear and satisfying.
---
Yeah I was thinking it would be kinda boring but then again it would take away people running the same builds (maybe) But i was thinking it could be like identity v where a specific character has passive traits (claudette has faster healing, meg has a slightly faster running
---
speed, dwight a slightly faster repair speed, etc)
---
Rank 1 killer on East coast is instant queues.

Rank 1 survivor on East coast is 2-5 minutes

This is for pc
---
So is the Day of the Dead skin for Julie about the same level of glow, then?
---
Yeah he camped me lol.
---
happened to me plenty times (most as Hag and Huntress).
---
one enters my basement and he never comes out again including his friends checking for him.

---
You didn't read the disclaimer did ya? But yeah, definitely.
---
Idk seems more like a meme build addon then anything else
---
There were some videos from a year ago (?) about a group called The Depip Squad. They only did gens, then escaped using no perks or items (in the first iteration). They weren't that great at looping, but because they didn't mess around and only did the objective (they might've unhooked once exit gates were open, not sure) they didn't allow the killer enough time to do anything (hence the "depip" squad). They weren't toxic, either. They just wanted to show how weak killers can be against any coordination (I don't even know if they talked at all in the first iteration)
---
Yes, and as a person negatively affected by people who DC cause of those reasons, and a person who also bought this game, I will continue to promote anti-DCing.
---
Also something you cannot stop, my guy. ;)
---
Nap time: 
---
After a generator is completed find a locker and take a brief nap to celebrate your hard work.
---
Smartass: bend the rules to your advantage without breaking them. Can go into a “crawl” state (downed but no injuries, no loaning from injuries, but just “damn it’s hard to move like this” grunts, but can still be picked up while crawling, takes 3 seconds for it to fully activate and 6 seconds to get back up) and can put pallets back up. Putting pallets back up takes 20/15/10 seconds.
---
*ya see that’s the funny part, the entity thinks it can manipulate you into being a dumbass when in reality you just need to stop and think for a second.*
---
pig main right here :P
---
A good killer will be able to read if the survivor is going to drop the pallet or not. Some survivors will drop the pallet no matter what and won't risk the 50/50 on whether the killer will respect it
---
question my doses of ketamine, you must not
---
Why arent mods deleting this, its the 10millionth ytme ive seen this
---
dbd and relax? yeah thats not going to work unless you have extra dark red swf team
---
What was the point of this?
---
Well this aged like milk
---
Only one does for everyone who's asleep, but the other one makes it so the obsession is always asleep. So I guess technically it does?

Honestly I just feel that's how reddits become.

Treacherous Dweller: Your knack for exploring deadly locations gives you an upper advantage. When exploring the basement, you walk and run 15%/20%/25% faster for the duration of staying in there. You also gain a 6%/7%/8% increase to unhooking, chest searching, and entering and exiting lockers
---
It’s based off of my tendency to spend most of my time in the basement playing this game, which may need a change honestly... too many hours
---
I think you forgot to switch account. You're using your overwatch troll account.
---
If you dc against a reworked legion then you shouldn’t play this game
---
No item in the rift is the same, it's probably just a slight recolor
---
Jake's head is hot honestly
---
I guess they're not an option anymore
---
ew
---
It’s pretty normal for console
---
Yeah, we are pretty much forced to use BBQ in every build if we want to level up killers
---
[Emblems Explained - "The ELI5 version"](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/8bvz68/emblems_explained_the_eli5_version/)
---
Poor baby.
---
BBQ, Whispers, SF, Enduring.
---
Knockout is also pretty good, cause Billy is a good killer to slug with. You can also replace Whispers with Ruin, but Billy still has a bunch of map pressure without Ruin.
---
Glad someone else noticed the monotony of the cosplays. Don't get me wrong, I love cosplaying. I myself went out with friends as a low-effort Ash cosplay the week of Halloween. But as it was low-effort I didn't feel the need to post pictures of it every day. I wore a denim shirt tucked into belted brown pants, with a tan fur-lined coat. Zero effort, I just walked to my closet and picked it out. And that's what 90% of the cosplays being posted here are. Someone in a hoodie and a skirt cosplaying Susie, or a tank top and a beanie as Nea. Which is totally fine to do, I respect it by itself, but is it really worth posting? *Especially* when 11 other people already posted the same thing? The only actually interesting ones have been the Wraith and Doctor cosplayers that popped up.
---
Also, unrelated but you forgot to add "Insert endless 'LUL SURVIVOR MAINZ LUL' memes"
---
He's definitely really bad in dedicated servers. His lean ability is broken as shit and revealing has become even worse.
---
So apparently ppl are expecting everyone to spend their life on this sub. I hadn't seen this before and just wanted to share sth funny with this community, but well. Seems like I can't.
---
Easy Death: You die quick and painless for realizing how fucked you are trying to actually run
---
Spine Chill my man. It's a good perk in general, but great for playing against stealth killers.
---
I know, hence why i’m triggered that they called it the eiffel tower 😂
---
Well granted I'm exhausted due to Head On I can still reduce the stagger fall from Balanced Landing, that right there makes it worth the trouble imo.
---
it is actually good, it forces everyone who wants to rank to do everything in the game, not just one, and as the killer it prevents camping because if you stay near a hooked survivor you lose your emblem
---
Can't decide between "Play With Your Self" and "A Lot of Mither."
---
There is no point, look it's about Nancys hand when she runs out
---
oh wow not like this is the 100th post about tome 4 being leaked too everyone
---
Oh i see, lol.
---
Claudette mains would love if they could do this every game, new level of bm.
---
The roblox version has more people playing at once than actual DbD lol
---
I think the each survivor should have ONE perk unique only to them which is always on. Then, add in 3 other perks (remove the 4th).    
---
Also, no teachables until PIII. And they can never teach that unique perk (but they can teach the other 2).  
---
Something like that anyway.
---
Watch closely as nancy walks out
---
I know what the emblems mean and how to get them. Still, for some killers it is much harder to actually get the same points as others in each category, and it´s funny that a long game ending with 3K with plenty of chasing and switching targets doesn´t even pip you (I gave the last guy hatch, but still).
---
I was asking myself the same question a long time ago,I wanted so bad clown but got spirit lol I had a lot of fun playing as her,its super easy to play as her (if you have headphones,if you dont,dont even think about it lol).After some time,I got clown and had a lot of fun too but when you hit red ranks you will see that you have to play very well to win with him,but he is fun to play on whatever other rank.And for last,plague,I dont really like her,maybe because of the character,idk.Anyways,I play on console too and bought them with shards
---
That’s my point. I’m not saying it’s a crime to be skilled, it’s just a dick move to sweat that hard against people that don’t warrant it. The only reason to run those builds at rank 20 is to be an asshole
---
Same. Last game yesterday I was a GF paying with around rank 10 to 12s. Anyways. I was downing them fast and got my 3 blight hooks immediately. So of course  I got 2 DC's . Last guys came to find me and pointed at the hook . They both won me over for staying and let them farm me till they could no more. Yes I did let them escape. I can't help it but feel for people who stay when others DC. It happens to me too when im playing solo. Not all killers are jerks.  Killers have done the same for me so I'm paying it forward.  I also give hatch if I suspect a baby survivor. I play solo and it's a mind field with DC's . Crazy how many have zero honor.
---
Agreed Honk
---
Now is playable
---
Move bitch! 
---
Your desire to always get where you need to be drives you. 
---
Once per trial, you are allowed to stun the killer by forcefully pushing past them. The killer is stunned for a total of 3/4/5 seconds. 
---
“Move out the way bitch I have places to be!”
---
Infectious Fright, Tinkerer, Discordance, and Nurses Calling
---
I gotchu man thnx for the help
---
Yeah, the skins are basic asf and the better ones are in the free track anyway
---
I just want Robert Englund freddy
---
Is it just me or does Jane look like she has a lazy eye?
---
Any killer I can’t loop so that it’s actually a challange
---
That's a big reason why people DC. Its the killer keeps slugging me and it's no fun. I understand that. It's the people who DC because you outplayed them or they got found first.
---
If it's the same size map, a killer like Doc could patrol gens while a Spirit/Nurse/Clown chases people. Killers would be favoured. Or they could both just tunnel one survivor together and make every pallet/window unsafe.
---
Oh
---
...Shit works on me everyday. I'm a sucker for giving hatch. I know the pain of survivors. Feels good to do at times. Run along. I'll hook you some other time. Damnit I'm a sucker for it...
---
Full group, maybe hope for it to be during the rank reset. I foresee a lot of down-pipping to get the right killer to make this work on.
---
Ah thanks, lovely drawings btw you must be proud :D
---
I don't DC against killers but I guess some people just don't find it fun so they give up and move onto the next match. That or they still think Legion is OP.
---
It is literally impossible,even with swf and boorowed time you are closer to get a 4k qith burger king myers than to get this challengue
---
Maybe after each prestige one perk becomes a teachable in the web instead. Gives incentive for every prestige while still having a reward before pIII. Can make it feel not as grindy at least too.
---
It feels quite unrewarding and grindy without the challenges TBH. It´s not really an issue since you should get enough with the Tome, but I honestly stopped giving a damn about it when I am not doing challenges. 
---
The bigger issue is that I want it to stop blocking my chat.
---
I did but I kept getting games with the people who literally just looked for my traps.
---
Standing right in front of a hooked survivor, essentially giving the survivors 0 chance, very much a dick move if you do it from the start, on last gen or no gens left not so much
---
I find it fun going against legion. Then again I main him so
---
I doubt the creator has ever played infinite/tombstone Myers. Those are NOT the perks. 
---
You need PWYF and Ruin to slow everything down. NEED
---
agreed tbh
---
My opinion is that she's fucking bullshit
---
Like yesterday
---
There will be 2 more chapters this year, it said so on the timeline of 2019! So soon! Probably this month and new year! Something like that
---
That would be fun! I think that’s what the Trappers might be doing.
---
Cool!
---
Prob distracted or has Vietnam flashbacks when he sees David?
---
At rank 20
---
Survivors:”all killers op plz nerf”
---
It was either the :P or a /s.  
---
Either way, it's a sad sad world we live in where you can't know if I'm serious or not. Poe's law is the norm now...
---
True, but most of those units have bad speed and gauntlets let you attack twice.
---
Killers:"all survivors toxic plz ban"
---
You mean 4honk?
---
Huntress is free?
---
Sometimes when I know I’m about to die on last hook I pallet stun the killer then tbag just to make it satisfying for him when he kills me. They spin around in joy and it’s perfect
---
Idk bro. Some of these pc players even at red ranks kindve boosted.
---
Ps4 player here, i would say that console and pc are rather the same
---
Hate to tell you this but freddy is not the killer he used to be. I would easily put him in A tier.
---
I have literally AFK'd in Killer games because it takes so long I go try to take care of something else and forget i had it up. Survivor queues I wait maybe a minute or two max
---
Its an asymmetrical pvp game. Someone is always going to get the short straw no matter how they balance the game to mitigate frustration or impatience. Therefore, there will always be people who are bitch enough to DC over any game going their way in the slightest.
---
There needs to be DC penalties, period.
---
so apparently there was 8GB update that Microsoft Store didn't see until I refreshed
---
I mostly play survivor and whenever I play killer I try to make the game fun for everyone as well. Most of the time it's just slapping on BBQ and chasing the next survivor aura you see. I tend to avoid going back to unhooks unless I can't find anyone and I avoid slugging if I see multiple survivors in an area. 
---
The only time I'll go out of my way to be unfun is when survivors make the effort to only run main buildings or stealth hard enough so I can only find the same one or two survivors.
---
i was playing a ghost face game yesterday and i had a feng land right on top of me, this drop down is by far my favorite part of the map lol
---
I don't normally agree with Mr ego, but he has a point.
---
No one says pls ban.
---
I got accused of gen camping once
---
You probably are unlucky,i am rank 6 and i mostly play solo,most of the time i escape or we all die with 2-1 gen/s left
---
The problem with balancing the game is who do you balance it around, the solo players, the SWF players, high rank, low rank, etc? I know that the game typically favours survivors in the red ranks, and as this is where Tru3 mostly plays it’s understandable why he wouldn’t want  the best killer to get nerfed, especially when there are so many ‘weak’ killers. 
---
That being said, I do think The Spirit is too strong for the vast majority of players, myself included. She’s incredibly unfun to play against as there’s almost no room to mind-game her. Her only true counter is a perk (Iron Will), which she can counter with Stridor. 
---
I think the best change would be to make her phasing sound directional, that way you’re able to tell where she’s coming from. Prayer beads should then be reworked to removal the directional aspect, but still retain the sound.
---
Me: well, time to... you aren’t struggling? This 0% wriggling, it’s hope is gone! BABY DWEET! THIS IS THE LAST OF MY GUILT! TAKE IT FROM MEEEEE! *fuckin yeets across the map to hatch lol*
---
early december im pretty sure
---
"Go play something else." I mean if you want the long wait times when a bloodhunt isn't active sure. Interesting that you are assuming that I'm making the complaints for myself, which says quite a lot about your argument, you're taking it too personally. The game needs quality of life improvements to keep attention on it. Currently when people have to endure people with full perks when they can only fit one it frustrates them and they're more likely to quit. Fixing this could just as easily be something like removing the slot level requirement or reducing the level requirement for teachables so new players don't have to max several characters just to get some of the better perks.
---
He has a good point, people in this game often expect that they are supposed to 1v1 the killer every time and win by looping. It is a 1v4 game, the killer IS supposed to be stronger. There is a reason why you go down on 3 hooks or why the killer is faster. Survivors need to rely on teamwork, and expecting to win alone is not realistic, at least against a worthy opponent.
---
That being said, Spirit does need some tuning, mainly to her add-ons though. As far as her base power goes I would honestly just remove collision from it. But some people just want to nerf her to the ground and that sucks.
---
For real recently survivor queue times where 5+ minutes then my killer queue times where like 10 seconds
---
...I mean you're not exactly telling me why is strong.
---
We don't want to 1v1 her we just want some kind of information whatsoever
---
Right now we get none
---
\&gt;:(
---
I wanna bring cute clothing cosmetics back. I want my Claudette to have pretty hair, dang it!
---
Ikr? And no one mentions it. Ever.
---
Clown gives me reason to use him.  Hag because I rotate her in when I play killer. I already love the Docs. Love Spirt but I suck with her. So clown and hag for me.  The clowns face plus his Santa costume look cool AF.
---
He's not wrong tho. That's what gonna happen, even devs say they make changes based on data alone (skewed due to DC whiny players count as kills for example) and not how things actually works
---
I already play mostly survivor for how stressful is to play killer. If they keep doing stuff like that I'll just play survivor if I wanna play the power role
---
That’s really good my dude, keep it up
---
What’s up with Jane‘s left eye? 👀
---
Great work though!
---
Yeah u right X
---
I think swf are easier to deal with. They get shit stomped because they become too altruistic
---
Just a honk that kills em with fear
---
i wouldnt say 2 by the end of the year. the roadmap doesnt say "2019" it says "year 4" which could be a year from the games anniversary. one more in december and then probably another in february
---
none of the rift cosmetics can be something you already own

---
It is very much, in her hand.
---
Its rng my dude, if you want a specific map you can get offerings in the bloodweb
---
Could be a game where the goal is the goose has to steal as many of the trinkets from the survivors before the survivors power the gens. Survs can chase the goose as well trying to get the trinket back before she "banks" the trinket.
---
I'd accept the challenge if I can keep the Pig, but they'd probably just go "lol use a splinter."
---
Its a downvote/upvote account. Look at the name and its post. Ignore this post
---
I wish killers could slam dunk a survivor down the hatch.
---
Me too. Have done every channel other than the "This is happening" challenge but it will not let me select it.
---
It would he way to op
---
In my opinion the game should be survivor skill based, but with a hard limit, a killer if they hard tunnel someone should be able to get them within 60-90 seconds at most. This garbage idea that should never be introduced but think if you could only drop so many pallets in a chase before exhausting yourself or something. 
---
The killer is a power role, and it should be possible for survivors to escape. It should never be possible, assuming an even skill game, without a major outplay or teamwork for ALL survivors to escape. Im talking [this type of teamwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dfdh46/decided_to_try_head_on_for_the_first_time_to_pop/) not I healed someone to full after i unhooked them "teamwork"
---
Again you!
---
Dude, she's not being changed for **Over A Year**.. only recently people started crying about her. That's very sad how these sheeple just see what X streamer say and they follow
---
He is right
---
All they had to do was remove the single trial demand.
---
I'd honestly consider allowing it as a Killer if people weren't so frequently toxic that it might benefit someone I later hate.
---
It isn't just killers though.
---
I get unsafe unhooked all the time. I even had two fellow survs tbag in the open exit gate and not unhook me. I received the message "suck it Steve."
---
Scoop Troop is easily becoming the most bullied surv.
---
Hell yeah they are!
---
Mine is literally opposite
---
No man, you said it wasn’t true at all. So I’m asking you to get me the proof. You’re asserting the negative. Go ahead, kill them all before they do anything. Like I said I’ll wait
---
Scoops Ahoy Steve's should be both Feared and Respected
---
I don’t get it.
---
&gt;Noone was complaining about base Nurse before the nerf.
---
That just made your whole argument invalid
---
\*Game loads\*  
---
Survivor: "This time I'll use deliverance!"  
---
Spirit: "Omae wa mou shindeiru"
---
Only switch
---
Uhhh I think you need to take math again.
---
Tbf, on console the survivors that have sent me messages after a game have usually gotten a successful report from me which shows how toxic they actually are. I’ve only ever had two messages from killers when playing survivor. One was meant for another survivor who kept flashlight clicking and teabagging the killer and ended up being the only one dying to a mori
---
There is no crossplay, if you are playing on 1 platform, then only other players on that platform can play with you.
---
I thought of that one too it would make sense with a factory because they'd have a lot of pallets and vaults too
---
&gt; Ban DC = suicide on hook. People will not play games they don't want to, ever.
---
This right here is what I'm talking about. No perfect solution? Oh, might as not even try to fix it! How about you get the fuck out of here with that shit. 
---
Stop acting like people are being forced to load up Dead By Daylight and play matches under penalty of death. If people don't want to play the game they shouldn't be joining lobbies in the first place. 
---
If people suiciding on the hook becomes an actual rampant problem then you disable the wigvle mechanic.  Keep arm flailing for signaling and obviously keep Deliverance in existence,  but disable the ability to purposely shorten the first phase.
---
People who want to rage quit mid-game aren't some poor victims who deserve pity. Eventually they'll either sack up and start playing the game due to the time investment involved or go ruin some other game.
---
Somehow, after everything else this game has endured, I think it can live even if all the chronic d/c'ers are held accountable.
---
In an ideal world what I would like to see done to the Spirit is her add ons to be looked into, Prayer beads moved to an Ultra rare.
---
And to give survivors an indication to where she is when she is phasing to prevent this ridiculous gambling feeling when playing against her
---
Anything else ?
---
Maybe you can search for a program that change your monitor directly? Not the game but that automatically correct everything on screen, but I don't know if it exist or even if this is possible sry dude
---
The best feeling is when you pop around a corner on to a generator and have it blow up because the survivor panicked and missed the check
---
He said he lost badly. Not that the tbags were op. Stop being stupid.
---
It’s a trade off that needs to be considered carefully. You’re either permanently broken and louder than usual or you give the killer the most powerful attack in the game.
---
On most maps it’s extremely difficult to loop a corrupted plague, that ranged attack is ridiculous and she can set out a constant stream while moving. Pallets are suddenly unsafe. Windows are unsafe. You have so many looping tools deleted from you.
---
As a broken survivor against a noncorrupted plague you can still loop. Yes you go down in one hit but there is SOME level of counterplay available since she can only M1 you after she infects you.
---
Honestly, knowing the best option requires you to consider the pros and cons carefully, as well as decide where you cleanse at. Usually the best option is to not cleanse, but as others have said above there are situations where cleansing is beneficial.
---
they just need to make it so when you t-bag it doesnt give a speed boost thats op
---
Spirits aren’t that hard tbh. You just don’t run around as often as you want and stick near teammates that can heal you.  beads make it difficult but not impossible
---
If I can tell people in the match are really bad I just start walking away in a random direction every time I hook someone until they unhook them, that way I get full 12 hooks and plenty of points. It may still be a fairly quick game if they are complete ass at chases, but in general you can get a lot of points and play fairly normal, besides pressuring on unhooks
---
See i would but its just faster to dc and go. But i dont usually DC I've only done it twice.
---
Yup how dare we play the game 😂😂😂😂😂
---
Swf is pretty garbage. Its ranked matches and it gives the single advantage of communication. With that you can get so much more done. Its undeniable. There usually is 0 risk for saves and such because you will know if the killer is there or if someone else sees them.
---
You seem to really dislike people who use balanced landing, buddy.
---
Maybe the issue is how POSSIBLE tunnelling is. Well, AN issue, yes nerf beads and give her a vault animation.
---
But consider that the game is balanced around its current state, where Survivors can't really protect one another if the Killer is decent, unless they're also unlucky. Pallet stuns and flashlights are generally avoidable, Killers can choose when to attack, so if you want to draw one's attention, what can you do?
---
Now, Killers are already on the weak end, so giving Survivors a general ability like flinging vision-obscuring mud would be a nightmare on its own, but what I'm basically saying is that Survivors seem to crave the ability to 1v1 every Killer because generally, Killers are only in 1v1 situations, and they can generally pick their opponent.
---
Can’t wait for this + bloody mask
---
As a console player it always makes me laugh when someone says nurse is the best killer.. we rarely come across her and when we do it’s usually because she has a daily
---
If the QoL of this game isn't what you want yes, go play something else... It's not that hard! Whining about something every player has to go through literally means you're a bitching baby that is to lazy to put time and effort in something he needs to accomplish.
---
Btw, of course your complaining for yourself... it's either that or your a chronic whiner that needs to find a torch to bear for others so he can spew his bile every so often.
---
All this game needs is decent finetuning and you don't do that by handing people more shit that breaks the game even more, you do it by fixing what's already in the game!
---
Aaaah alright I thought you put the emoji there for sarcasm, my bad.
---
Yeah she is quite difficult to play well depending on the map layout. She got a very strong 3 gen Potential though.
---
While a terrible killer strat it will piss off pretty much anyone
---
Pair it up with ruin and it truly is infuriating
---
My killer main ass: BLOODY WARDEN, I CHOSE YOU!
---
Random success/failure rate ≠ difficulty
---
No0b3 gone but never forgotten &lt;3
---
I find detectives hunch with a map and to be godly in finding totems
---
That’s just false
---
Wow haven't played since the update and I'm kind of shocked they thought this was a fair single game challenge.  Looks like they still got some balancing to do with these things because that's just ridiculous.
---
I wonder how/if they will do archives with licensed characters. They will have to expect you to buy them or at least get their perks from the shrine, and by the looks of it you will need to play the character directly at least once as seen with Trapper and Claudette.
---
Downvoted? But you are right lol.
---
just imagine
---
Not my boi Jeff....
---
yeah i was planning on making more killers and also survivors
---
I'm sorry, is this some sort of peasant joke that I'm too red rank to understand?

Console lmfao
---
Well I am not sure if I have seen the same image but there have been many posts like this.

So sir, I respectfully won't call you a thief but still its not anything fresh either.

They were sharing a few helpful tips, is that too serious for you?
---

---
Its almost like this sub talks about spirit a lot.
---
And no i dont just listen to popular streamers. You never told me any actual counters to spirit, and when spirit is brought up and you force someone to say counters to her, they cant think of anything so they hit you with the "you dont like her bc she is good"
---
I’ve never had a problem with facing the plague. If she’s got corrupt I’ve been full health and she’s only managed to land at least one hit or if she gets me down it’s ran out and she has to start again. Maybe i just get lucky
---
\*meg screaming\*
---
I used to use it a lot. 
---
Very good people there, but please follow the rules.
---
There’s game discussions, and even a gameplay review system to help you improve. There’s a few other languages. You can also participate in events that the dev team might do. (Ie, play with the devs).
---
Did you read the ending of what he said? "I shouldnt be losing games this hard bc I am a red rank killer. developers plz do something!". Its a bait.
---
Once again you accusing me, you might want to calm down and get way less personal. If you want to come at this with a less toxic angle feel free, but you aren't proving any points when you have to sling around accusations and insults. How exactly would removing the level lock on perk slots break the game? It's a meaningless wall that keeps people from experimenting properly with the three perks they already start with. Why not just let them use all three right at the start?
---
Have you done Stardew Valley art? I swear I've seen your work before...
---
But damn those event hooks are so fucking far everytime!
---
You’ve never played against a decent plague before, then.
---
Meh, personally I dont consider crossovers and anything happening there to be canon so whatever
---
A good two years ago, before Wraith got his first rework and was the worst killer, I had a game as him on Swamp.  Found a Nea who was my obsession and downed her after an embarrassingly short chase, given I was addon-less Wraith and she Tbagged at the pallet she threw near the start.  Old Decisive Strike happens, I down her again, DC.  This was before DCing for being the first downed was really a thing, or at the very least before it became as prevalent as it was today.  Just stood out to me as a massive rage quit because “I was the easy killer!”
---
\*saltier
---
I am gonna make one with Jotaro as the killer. It's gonna take some time tho. Be on the lookout
---
I’ll never forget the match where 3 people in 4 man swf dc’d because I exposed them. Not even because I downed or hooked them, just exposed them. The last person was really confused and I felt so awful that I had to help them farm and give them hatch. After the match, I told them that I was sorry that their friends just left them like that.
---
I’ve never dc’d intentionally. Only if there is an internet problem will that happen for me. Even if the match is going awful, I’m getting facecamped, I’m getting farmed, someone is trying to bm me, etc. I still want my bloodpoints, so I’m not leaving. And I don’t care about rank enough to get upset over deranking or depipping. Although my internet (or rather the host’s internet) did make me dc once with awful timing because it made it look like I rage quit. I think we were playing against a Spirit at Hawkins Lab and we were all doing awful. I wasn’t the only one to accidentally dc though and my friend messaged the killer who genuinely apologized for their internet being trash.
---
Well, yeah, tunnelling is completely optimal and that's not Killers' fault. Even outside of explicit tunnelling, picking out the Survivor with a key/toolbox/toxic outfit is just a choice the Killer can make that Survivors cannot interfere with. The issue has two facets:
---
-Killers don't have much REASON to rotate targets if they're all in the same situation. They can abandon bad chases/apply pressure, but ultimately, they can choose to 1v1 whomever they want and it's generally smartest to focus the weakest or nearest to death player.
---
-Survivors have such a significant upper hand as it is that giving them any ability to take this decision away from the Killer or penalize it would make Killers virtually unplayable. There has to be a change that rewards Killers for rotating targets so that they do it voluntarily. Myers' Stalk is close, but he doesn't actually attack his stalking targets for the most part.
---
I dont think people want to be able to 1v1 a killer, i do think good killers in the game are the most fun to play against (especially since a lot of the low tier killers seem to be the most annoying).
---
Every argument saying spirit is not the worst is met with people just saying "its bc she is good". nurse is good, but nurse at least tells you when you are gonna die, you might be able to work around the nurse
---
To be fair, this meme is also getting super old
---
I actually think her husk should be vulnerable to torchlight  when she shifts, revealing her midshift. That would provide some counter play.
---
The entire topic is exhausted. This is like the tenth post I’ve seen today about spirit nerf karma farmers.
---
Was just trying to say strange, but that applies as well quite accurately
---
I would say adam is the most forgettable survivor
---
"I don't agree with something you said, so I am going to ignore you."
---
People complained about omegablink nurse. Not base nurse
---
Can't be healed sometimes. Can't heal sometimes. Won't heal to full sometimes. Sometimes hex totems spawn in a spot where they can't be reached. Sometime hex totems are shown as plain dull totems. 
---
Played a game where survivors had multiple dead hard boosts away from me. Entire game is balanced around ruin. Cosmetics cost way too much.
---
Everything here is wrong in so many different ways.
---
That doesnt really help since im p sure she can hear your flashlight, Its kinda just like "haha she is phasing! i guess im dead!"
---
u/vredditshare
---
Asymmetrical: One side is a hope-eating juggernaut, and the other is Killer.
---
The first guy was saying that the t-bagging doesnt mean SWF
---
Interesting,  I havent seen that one before.
---
Is this on derpacated servers?
---
And if so was he moving around while hitting you or just standing still.
---
Asking as sometimes (thanks to the servers) a killer will see a player model glitch out and they can hit you at a window or drop even if survivors see you move away to a different location.
---
Let me guess. Spirit main?
---
Purposefully designed that way to drive sales..."BUY TIERS NOW FOR JUST 100 Cells EACH".   Super scummy business practices, but what can you expect from these devs.
---
Is Billy good on console? I don't really know how it works there.
---
As a wraith main it’s honestly not too bad. Certain add-ons and perks can make it really easy to speed up to catch them and down them. Things like haunted grounds help, devour hope, etc...
---
i had a few survivors DC against me when i was playing The game map as billy, not sure why
---
Very confused about the with Freddy no less mention.  Since his rework he has become a top 3-4 killer in the game depending on where you place Billy.  Personally I think he edges Billy out for 3rd.  Freddy is amazing now and viable without addons at red rank and quite strong with dealing with swf squads.
---
And it's only be allowed to be used on Ash
---
Look at that template good lord it’s beautiful.
---
And just in time for thanksgiving
---
Killer queues were instant back then.
---
I'm struggling enough trying to hold 3 glasses of chocky milk...
---
The fact that you just mentioned Leatherface as a "broken" killer, called BBQ "broken", complained about wallhacks in this game, compared STBFL to "infinite ammo", complain about "bad maps" when many are great for survivors as well as somehow think Dstrike is bad just tells me you are probably Rank 30.
---
I bet the hitboxes work better

---
Not really tho lol one helps the other but it's not a slowdown perk in itself. Do you just get off on trying to feel superior to people because you're so pathetic in real life or something?
---
I LOVE that perks, you aren't fully perked without it
---
I did the totem quest with that but a green map and it was pretty fun
---
We need Clown in short shorts.
---
Asymmetric means the GAMEPLAY differs, not the overall capability of each SIDE. It's just that the one Killer should be roughly 4x as capable as one given Survivor.
---
Leatherface isn't broken. He's rather weak and his only niche is being a strong camper which won't get you very high in ranks.
---
But I'm not getting mad at it. I'm finding the humor in people getting mad at people making the same joke over and over by using said joke.
---
(Edited a spelling error)
---
So you hate the killer mains that use s tier characters, or an f tier character (leatherface), what about the killer mains who play doctor or wraith or myers, maybe even legion.
---
Please be shitposting
---
Survivors can listen to foliage such as grass, and corn to detect the spirit when she is using her power.  
---
They can also observe said plants being brushed aside when she is "mindgaming" you.   
---
How do I know all this? Because I play Rin a lot and the corn betrays me.
---
Had a game where a spirit chased me to a pallet in phase and I had to just throw the pallet and pray i was on the right side, spirits of different skills/experiences play differently so you can't predict half the time.  
---
Just give me an indicator of how close or something, for spirit it might seem like a mind game but as survivor you're just guessing and hoping your choice was the right one.
---
Enjoy yourself. I can’t remember the last time I saw a trapper in purple/red ranks.
---
The 7th time I've seen this format in the past 3 days
---
This will be 10 times easier with blood warden as well

That is basically every battlepass in every game TBH.

At least it should be pretty okay to get to max and you get enough Cells to buy the next one, that is good enough to me.

&gt; I used to like discussing perks, new killers, builds, maps, items, and the god like gifs or memes that used to be here
---
lol when did you start posting here? It's been like this for like a year.
---
The only killers I don’t DC on are Myers, Hag, clown and legion.
---
This has potential to be the worst post I’ve ever seen, maybe ever
---
This is hilarious.
---
*Carrying in Dead by Daylight.*
---
I feel uncomfortable. Because I don\`t have friends to play with.
---
Read the tag sis
---
The hatch spawns when the amount of gens done is one greater than the amount of survivors left alive.
---
Probably cause the movie... he looks just like that haha only with a suit
---
barren it may be, but hearty it is. it's a shame your ketamine was stolen by a fictional character
---
You're god damn right.
---
This one of the more fun and balanced killers in the game. I don't want to never loop her again just because of some whiners.
---
He wasnt anywhere to be found. And this video was taken last night so if dedicated servers are live then yeah could be that. But he stood still at the window (that's where I thought he might have turned on any cheats) and after that we didnt see him (I thought maybe he went invisible or turned on lag switch) but I kept getting downed after getting up for a good little bit. Eventually he reappears and slugs us and let's us bleed out. It very much could be a servers bug now that you mention it though. The killer left immediately after so I never got to ask.
---
Ahh yay got something wrong Lauries hair has to be shit
---
B..bb.. but.. the blood..p...point economy.
---
I got accused of "camping gens" with one generator left...
---
I've heard conflicting info on that. Are you sure the grass moves on survivor's clients? I know it moves on the killer's client.
---
Agreed. The only time I begrudgingly play Adam Francis is if there is a daily to do.
---
It's always the fucking Laurie's I swear.
---
Hey you wanted to butt in, right? If I can't target you when talking to you then who? The guy that didn't spout ignorance, if you want to fight for a cause at least do it with the notion that people not thinking like you are going to be addressing you and probably not with a happy, fuzzy feeling inside them! I don't need you to like me, I ultimately don't care about you...
---
You don't matter and ultimately nor does you opinion, by keeping the replies coming you care about my opinions, that doesn't mean I do about yours... weird isn't it? You got a right to freedom of speech that doesn't mean I got a duty to listen to you... something way more people should realize.
---
I accuse you based upon statements you made, if you want me to stop don't answer on this post anymore and it'll magically disappear. But that's not going to happen is it?
---
I'd like for him to laugh loudly when someone dies. Freddy always and clearly took great pleasure in his kills. It was a good part of his appeal to me anyway.
---
You're a bait
---
Very great work! You should make more
---
Don't group up, everyone cleansing makes plague waste a lot of time reapplying sickness and takes a lot more thought. I play plague a ton, and I bring thanataphobia, stridor, brutal strength... pre-infection addons... I personally HOPE you don't cleanse.
---
Please report back to us if that works!
---
These are the people that cause people to go pure meta only killers with mori's.
---
They just have 2nd accounts and unlock top tier stuff only and sadly theres nothing to prevent it except lobby dodging. I hope your future experience turn out better :(
---
I am usually the one playing the plague and on maps like the swamp you have 2-4 free cleanses. However that’s about it. I can leave those corrupted on now you got to juggle the remaining pools, which are always in a good position for me.
---
Anyways, you are right that this does indeed need coordination and from my experience only 1 in 4 teams actually uses cleansing in a non threatening way to them.
---
So I agree base line should be not to cleanse, but  under certain circumstances it’s actually the right thing to do imo.
---
Crazy how that worked out right? I remember seeing everybody recommend Spirit to people when they asked who they should pick up. Now after the Nurse rework was confirmed and put in NOW Spirit is OMG SO OP PLZ NERF.
---
There’s a bunch of drag queens streaming dead by daylight. It’s awesome.
---
It's not, this is just coming from the tweet where the actor for Quentin told the Devs to use his likeness, but it's not that simple. This sub just has been fixated on that since then.
---
So I clicked on your profile to look for the fan art and I forgot and I went into a F13 the game discussion and thought it was dbd
---
Keys feel just as powerful as some add-ons for survivors. It's always shitty figuring out what the hell just happened, but I don't feel cheated if they're able to congregate at a hatch after having done enough gens. That's on me.
---
I've had a lot of fun with it so far. I know it's not the best status effect and I can't think of many other killers I'd use it on. On the Trapper however, once you're in those bear traps, no ones going to save you.
---
I've had survivors die on their first hook because no one knows what's going on and where they all are in relation to each other.
---
That’s totally fine. Have a Pleasant Day Sir.
---
Deliverance.
---
Ouch my feelings, arnt you supposed to be interrupting some sort of murder cult in a small town instead of being on reddit?
---
Yeah, people should say “go stand against a wall” or “go afk and make a sandwich” so the examples don’t get overused am I wrong?
---
These are incredible! Pls make more art for us :)
---
This usually gets people because most higher rank survivors think that they can safely trigger your traps while your in a chase.
---

I thought Freddy’s shirt was dark green and red?

Two years ago. I stopped frequenting long ago only kept subbed for the new chapter announcements because I don’t fuck with YouTube.
---
We got a base and add-ons nerf when noone asked for a base nerf. What's your point?
---
I appreicate your honesty. Hopefully something new and original comes along.
---
Ok, this a shit post
---
Devs didn't confirm anything, this is just coming from the tweet where the actor for Quentin told the Devs to use his likeness, but it's not that simple. This sub just has been fixated on that since then.
---
The PS4 times have been shit with the 3.3.0 patch, I’m in the southeast USA and the past few blood hunts it’s always insta lobbies for survivors and long waits for killer, but this time around it hasn’t mattered what you wanna play, 10-20min waits... wish BhVR would fix their game. I spent more time during the blood hunt waiting for a lobby than I did actually playing or while loading into the killers lobby would get a error and kicked back to the main menu to just start all over again...
---
&gt; You have broken perks like bbq (wallhack basically)  
---
Ahahaha, okay I stopped reading here.
---
You must be doing an action such as healing or repairing. Otherwise staying in the same 10m will cause crows
---
At last take out the *single trial* rule for some of them. It's still challenging to have one survivor get hooked and saved during EGC most times, then you still have to do it 3 times. Lol
---
Yea I haven't been on here much lately either.
---
No your mistaken my sir
---
I’m the end of the i say you would. 
---
Ironic...
---
The devs won't do anything because all they do in every update is make survivors stronger without any downsides. Really hoping they do something to address this in the future.
---
I killed 3 and Mori’d one. Only got sacrifice and hunter (chase) 
---
I lost my rank 3.
---
Spirit might not have been changed since the MidChapter after her release, when she was finished (Yes, some stuff in that patch contained planned changes for the release after PTB feedback). But that doesn't mean that the percpeiption of the killer changed over time. Or that she wasn't affected by general changes. The Legion patch broke audio e.g. That kept Spirit underpowered and less popular for some time.  
---
And it also took time for Killers to realize how reliable she is at high ranks. So it took time until her popularity and Meta evolved. She basicly replaced Hillbilly as the go-to-red-rank killer, now.   
---
And since that happened, survivors complains emerged. Not uncommon. Because you tend to complain more about things, you face a lot. And it's not because they repeat what streamers say.
---
Yesss

Must be nice, here in the south east USA it’s been 10-20min wait times for killer or survivor. Blood hunts normally give us 1-2mins survivor wait times. But since the 3.3.0 patch we have been screwed and my friends have had the same problem and we are scattered across the USA from the east to the west
---
Toxicity is the problem, toxic survivors breed toxic killers and vice versa. If we keep not being toxic then it will spread in reverse sooner or later.
---
I hope you're being sarcastic because everything you said is wrong; I can explain every single point if you want

This is hilarious
---
Yw
---
And now you can't even use it as the last survivor. Devs just nerf random shit
---
I play both sides. I know it can be fun to instant win! But everyone depipping is a snooze fest. When I’m killer and can finish a game in less than 3 minutes, I hook 3 people and let the last one get unhooks and maybe one heal off and do it again. That way everyone can at least play the game some, get a decent amount of blood points, and black pip at minimum.
---
See? You don't like the answer because you won't adapt

It's a you problem not a me problem my dear

Playing 15 games as a red rank killer with no add-ons, perks or offerings sounds like 15 games of getting no kills. What is the point and what does it prove?
---
It likely would lower queue times. I assume this is part of the reason there are missions you can complete on either side, as it eases the imbalance. Maybe if they just increased the number of neutral missions available it would fix the problem.  
---
While I can't speak for everyone, I'd rather have shorter queue times than more missions. An 80:20 split seems extreme. If they could find a way to do that without giving killers fewer mission, that would be ideal. One possibility would be to make the survivor missions take a bit longer on average.  
---
If they did a little of each, it wouldn't be that bad. A few more survivor mission that take a little longer, and a few more neutral missions. Maybe also make the neutral missions take a bit longer on survivor than on killer.
---
That you guys won't adapt but ask for nerfs. That's it
---
My dumb ass couldn't figure out which girl Quentin was 🤦‍♀️
---
Do some swf abuse the killer unnecessarily? Sure. But I wouldn't say that makes them OP. Mostly because 75% of swf don't bully. They've buffed the killers immensely in the last few patches and survivors have got nothing but nerfs, sometimes you'll just get shit stomped, it's just how the game goes.
---

What were they saying about us in the DBD community? You know since you went under cover like James Bond and penetrated the F13 threshold?

I swear my most hilarious killer games are as Leatherface, Trapper and Wraith. There's just a huge demographic of survivors that turn into braindead garbage against them and it's just glorious.

I’m a player on the Switch, and I waited for 1.5 hours for a lobby before giving up. My boyfriend waited an hour before getting a match yesterday. Noticed it getting worse since Halloween
---
Take my last Silver for putting into art what I’ve been feeling
---
Coherent English please?
---
But the game is already a tunnel, camp and slug fest. Killers do it all the time, because it's already viable. And understandable. Why would they limit themselves?  
---
Besides that True is kinda missing the point, about Spirit complains. I mean Nurse is stronger, but less hated. The reason why survivors complain is more about game feel than balancing.
---
Headphones help a shitload.
---
I understand why Stridor is a strong perk and Whispers too, but I just don´t understand why you want to pair it with Furtive Chase.
---
Their a difference between crying and setting the record straight

I cannot freaking wait for this, his design was one of the main reasons I waited to get him.
---
9/10 times the correct play for killer is to not respect pallets. Where did people get the idea that it's bad for the killer to get pallet stunned?
---
Was wondering the same thing or she crossed eyed!
---
Looks like Skeletor!
---
I finally saw him in game and the person playing him was a sweaty heavy breathing try hard. Game was lost and I couldn't get him to pose a second. I'd love a couple more emotes. 
---
Point and give a thumbs up then mime taking a picture and maybe putting your hands together in front of you like you're begging. 
---
Something to show the killer or another survivor they scared the daylights out of you.
---
Because I wasn't quite sure myself, what and how to synergies it the best way. I don't play Spirit too often to be honest, but since I was browsing the wiki I recalled that her TR is actually 24 instead of 32.
---
And 24 metres by default is more or less a given for FC, as your approach is cunning enough to make not using M&amp;A less of a punishment, while 8 metre TR once using a fully stacked FC sounds also very potent.
---
&gt; The bigger issue is that I want it to stop blocking my chat. 
---
This was the Dev's secret solution to dealing with post-game salt all along! BWAHAHAHAHA
---
Bro he cut your ear off
---
You are correct I'm sorry
---
It's normal at mid ranks. But as a word of condolence, each match try to finish one gen by yourself, get one safe hook rescue, and one teammate heal. With those three things, you should manage to get to red ranks and leave your teammates behind (survivor rank 1 for the past three months).
---
Haha no worries, glad to help
---
On twitch or where???
---
What do you mean when you day map RNG has favoured killers since clown got added? Are you referring to something they made in that patch or are you saying that the clown made map RNG favoured towards killers?
---
Lol me too but I use susie's skin

Yeah Billy’s good. It’s just the frame rate is terrible when blinking on nurse, you’ll end up missing most of your hits. She’s the killer that’s different on console I think

hoo boy.

lmfao at the end

It´s actually crazy to see how big the game has grown. I remember playing when we still had 3 killers in this game, and perks like Shadowborn were top tier. 
---
Now we have 17 killers. Wow.

Why are you booing me? I am right! 
---
Seriously, this is a Killer Mains only subreddit.
---
My 13 year old carved that one himself. He was really disappointed because he wanted to make it look like the pumpkin from the opening credits of the original Halloween film, but I told him that I honestly thought it came out kind of creepy and mutated and that I liked it more this way. I'll show him this comment so he knows I wasn't just trying to make him feel better.

someone’s gotta.

same here 💀

Welp time to play huntress when I get he from school :P

You got two plagues in a row??

As a Killer, there's nothing more satisfying than finding Survivors by listening for the faintest of rustlings, the slightest of breaths.
---
Toxic

They aren't

You’re right, but if she looks slightly to the side she won’t blind. It’s situational and can be used against you

paranoid- every time you get hit by the killer you gain one stack of paranoid makes you see the killers aura for 5 seconds when you are within 24 meters of the killer also consumes one stack can only be activated as soon as you get out of the killers terror raduis
---
the unstoppable force
---
gain one percent extra movement speed every time you help the obsession for the rest of the match maximum stacks 5
---
decreases the chance of you being the obsession.
---
english is obviously his second language dumbass
---
Do you really only get a 7 hour window to complete these 15 matches? That seems pretty short especially considering how the killer queue times can be.
---
Who's this "Steve"? 
---
We're talking about Steve "the hair" Harrington here.
---
Enjoy, she's probably my favorite
---
I am actually amazed your totem is surviving long enough 😁
---
On one cosmetic sometimes. Not consistently and it’s faint. Can’t see it on console
---
If only there was an addon for adding more "swing time" :(
---
That's a funny bug you've found.
---
"Youre worst nightmare."
---
okay so I'm not great at playing Freddy, that doesn't mean you need to be mean about it
---
Use your damn ears, you can hear their breathing and the grass moving.
---
Alright slow down there Tex you’re sayin a lotta Mumbo jumbo words and I don’t fully understand
---
By a large margin
---
Exactly. And she makes playing killer exciting and fun for me. Most of the time. Lol
---
you’re only gonna get more people who can’t hit ruin skill checks lol, my advice from personal experience is to find a couple people who you really play well with and make that your main swf. I almost always only play with my two buds bc I know they’re more reliable than any random in existence.
---
Someone did, it still shows this community
---
Ok,first of all.
---
We can all agree Spirit and Nurse are the strongest killers,but they aren't broken at all.Nurse has been nerfed recently but even without the nerf you can dodge her blinks or break line of sight.Spirit is the only one I agree A LITTLE BIT with you.I'm a killer main and I completely understand that guessing games suck for survivors.Still not OP or broken.And LF...he doesnt have any kind of stealth or map pressure and his instadown...sucks.
---
BBQ isn't wallhack kind of level at all.You only see survivors far away from the hook and can be countered by lockers.It's a nice tracking and farming perk but it's far away from OP.Save the best for last just reduces the goddamn distance between a killer and a surv after a hit(and you have to completely ignore the obsession).And Ds...I think everyone knows that shit was basically a free live for survivors before the rework.
---
So yeah... that's all of your post that's wrong.So please tell me it was a shitpost.
---
Why Not?- When running into or by the killer, you can't drop pallets, but you can run faster. When in a killer's fear radius, you have a 10/20/30% chance of healing/doing generators faster. You also have a 5/10/15% of doing these slower. You earn more points for running past/into the killer, but you are more likely to be downed faster.
---
*"Being terrible sucks, but... well... that's just it." -Kompy15*
---
I mean the guy still didnt even try to prove his own point stating SWF is busted. He just came here to complain. I think its justifiable to poke fun at that.
---
I just had my first perfect game yesterday, also as Freddy!
---
On Twitch. :) 
---
I follow one I really like, Elix9. There was a whole group of them at TwitchCon.
---
I did not notice that, but still a unnecessary nerf right?
---
And if you think Maps are killer favored...play Hillbilly on Haddonfield or Myers on Cornfield.
---
The problem with FC is that it is only active *while in chase.* Which means you lose the effect as soon as you break away...which is pretty terrible. And you cannot really hear Stridor properly with the chase music going on, and Whispers is also quite meh when you are in close vicinity of the guy you are chasing so it´s lit up. 
---
You also lose your stacks if you obsession dies, in contrast to perks like STBFL...FC is really just a weird perk, and I cannot really understand what purpose it should serve. Maybe if it lingered for some time after you break chase, and didn´t go away after obsession dies...but in its current state I cannot imagine running it. I didn´t even pick it up when I was levelling Ghostface.
---
That is really good any advice I want to start drawing people/perks from dead by daylight
---
The cringe.
---
Almost as cringey as me saying 'The cringe'.
---
Just move onto the next game tho
---
So you don’t like the teammates at rank 8, so you think the solution is to go to rank 14?
---
For me, at the beginning of the video he was stalking one guy, and maybe he saw the aura of him in the corner and juke him like in the video
---
Kiss me bitcha
---
Alright
---
For what? A joke?
---
Dirtiest anti-heal build in existence.
---
But it's not a nerf. That's the way the game has always treated deliverance since the perk came out with Spirit last year. It's not a nerf if they've never changed it.
---
It’s not that we want her to be easy to 1v1, it’s that we want to be able to have some input in the matter, give spirit chases being an actual fight instead of a gambling/guessing game. Nurse is way more fun to fight than spirit is (let alone genuinely fun killers to fight like billy and Huntress) despite nurse being stronger, because you have the ability to play against it. Spirit offers almost zero feedback on what she is doing, whether that’s cuz she’s using her power, her not having a vault animation (WHY DOES SHE GET SPECIAL TREATMENT HERE), bumping into a survivor during her power basically being a free hit, sometimes even the random twitching her model does sometimes gives the illusion of her doubling back. Another problem is that the pallet “mindgames” is really just a guessing game in disguise where there’s no skill expression in reads or mindgames. “Oh is she doing the mindgame where she’s standing still at the pallet? Idk she has the schoolgirl skin on and I can’t see the glass so she could be doing anything and I don’t know.” It’s just dumb, when a nurse hits me I’m like “damn that nurse fucking read me like a book, she’s really fucking good” when I hit by spirit at a pallet I’m like “welp I lost that gamble and now I’m injured so she gets the next hit for free cuz despite me having iron will she has stridor and can still hear my grunts.” Also because the only reliable counters she has are two perks, why do we have to build towards one of the 17 killers when you can’t even see who you’re fighting until you’re already in gams, it’s just bad design, and if you DONT run those perks and she ran prayer beads then you’re gonna get gen grabbed with 0 fucking counterplay and it removes literally all of the chasing mechanics from the game and you just get hooked for free.
---
I actually met a bunch of very nice people who have .ttv in their name. It is where I find a lot of accessible, not-god-tier-but-fun streamers
---
after you finished chainsawing with hillbilly, the sound still goes on and it kinda annoys me \^\^
---
You will only be more frustrated at the more potatoey potatos at rank 14. XD
---
I was talking about how to deal with 4 swf that's all
---
During a chase? Why would terror radius matter in a chase?
---
Decisive Strike, need I explain?
---
Shout out to the Blendette squad  :)
---
That’s why bloodlust was added
---
It does make the perk a lot weaker, aside from the broken effect. It is not a nerf, but a unnecessary downside
---
Kiss me too
---
I'll take that if there are warning notifications added for BT, adrenaline, and DS.
---
Exhaustion perks can stay hidden because I'm so nice and good at balance.
---
Its the canon sequal to Freddy vs Jason
---
Oh ok, thanks
---
Rare Leatherface here, hello
---
i'm working on more killer PAs
---
teabagging `scum`
---
nice play though
---
Just do gens
---
This subreddit is just going to keep this cycle going my favourite part is when killers come in mass to post about survivors complaining about the new killer when no one ever actually posted anything and then the release happens and the survivors whine afterwards when it comes out in a buggy release. Conclusion I love this game &amp; community
---
Thanks!!!
---
I've thought about that actually. With ruin, they know straight away as soon as they are working a gen.
---
I think it's a combination of the third seal being less obvious and less of a threat. I've gotten a few 4ks with it still up.
---
Still luck of the draw, but I'll take it.
---
lol we've all had that moment of panic! he never fails to spook me
---
What?
---
Not at all. Ghost face is nowhere near one of the best killers. He most certainly does not need a nerf.
---
When you're the only one left, the few seconds it takes to open that gate always has me on edge.
---
Bless you for cataloguing all of these. I don't understand how someone can still think they're the first ones to find this
---
Every time I mention this I get downvoted to hell, but its the truth.
---
That's a really solid tip and I'll have to try it out!
---
OH YEAH YOU WANNA GO LITTLE BOY? WANNA FIGHT WELL BRING IT ON
---
BYE MUST WATCH NOW
---
When survivors lose, that's called "bullshit." when survivors lose badly, that's "tunneling."
---
I remember 1 dude used a key right in front of me and then i closed the hatch to trigger the endgame, just screwed up the game for the other 3 hiding around hatch
---
thank you!
---
It was tried, but wildly unpopular. Sort by the most controversial post. Since it's been 2 years trying again might not hurt
---
Dude can one shot has 0 terror radios and if you try to stop the one shot he gets pinged of your location who else has that

It's incredibly situational. You have to be deliberately trying to get a safe unhook in early game and hope the killer downs you otherwise it's a waste of a perk slot. Sure, a guaranteed kobe is great, but most of the games where I've used the perk and managed to use it, it ended up being a game I ultimately lost. The best game is one where you don't get hooked at all and therefore it's better to just bring other perks.
---
Imagine being so garbage at the game that instead of your teammates farming you, you do it yourself.
---
*cries*
---
You need to use NOED for the challenge
---
I honestly found out about dbd because my little brother would ask me to play the roblox version W/him and i actually enjoyed it and said i wish they had a 'adult version' and he told me it's based off a real game, lol. I still play the roblox version w/him occasionally.
---
I agree, it's more gimmic than anything else. 
---
I mean it actually has some advantages, especially when playing on in-door maps, as you can cut ways and punish much more easily. Plus it the time for a chase to break is like... 6 seconds? So ofcourse you can't just abandon a chase and go for someone else, it's literally just for in-chase mindgames on favorable maps. If you don't use Dark Devotion that is.
---
Now that I think about it, using it with Dark Devotion might actually be quite entertaining.
---
Furtive Chase, Dark Devotion, Make Your Choice. This might more rely on the Obsession transfer than on the actuall TR reduction, slugging the Obsession once one-shotting with MYC and go for someone else during DD's duration might be quite interesting.
---
But yeah, Furtive Chase is definetly more of a gimmick than a efficient meta perk. But considering the amount of perks we have, there might be some interesting synergies. Since I have more than 2k hours on this game, I enjoy tinkering with different loadouts more than consistently running the best perks.
---
Well from my experience ruin isnt that common in rank 14 so my teammates will actually do gens while i loop the killer
---
&gt; luck of the draw
---
Yeah well thats the thing, lately every time my totem spawns right next to that 'one' toxic survivor who t-bags and point at you after every pallet drop. My luck sucks real bad.
---
1) Leatherface in no shape or form is broken and nurse is now dog shit in chases
---
2) RNG is literally RNG and doesn't favour either sides, hence it's name RANDOM number generator
---
3) BBQ only works outside of 40m so if you decide to stay in the same spot while they see your aura for like 3 seconds it's pretty much your fault
---
4) you said looking at survivors yet you complained about killer's so I think this is stupidity on your end
---
Overall I think you're just whining because you can't adapt to the higher rank killers I feel like you should know that those of us who camp and tunnel are quite the minority
---
Sir, have you been hit over the head by leather face one too many times?
---
What?! 🤦‍♀️
---
Either Laurie or Nea.
---
&gt; Predicting your opponent
---
completely invisible, no sound, no motion, nothing
---
&gt; past behavior
---
they were completely invisible, no sound, no motion, nothing, and then they hit someone.
---
There is no "mindgame" with Spirit, she is currently broken, and it takes absolutely 0 skill to catch people off guard when they can't predict literally anything you're doing.
---
Please have Jesse in the game so he can scream “yeah decisive bitch” 😂
---
Well I mean if you get all of them before the gens get completed  then the keys are useless, but if you get some of them, the other two can easily escape while you're going around patrolling gens, I've been cucked so many times by keys it's not funny, but it's part of the game and they're pretty balanced if you think about it, it's the gens that get done too fast
---
 &gt; All you can do is make a guess and hope the killer makes a mistake. 
---
I think it's more of a read then a guess.
---
For example: You know she's phasing so you vault through a window, you also know she has to go around it to get to you. You have to make a read. Do you commit and keep going after the vault, or do you vault back over slowly. There are many jukes and verse -mind games you can do against her. **Even if she's good.** 
---
It's a battle of who can read who better. If the spirit can read you like a book and predict what you're going to do before you even know what you're gonna do... Then IMO they deserved the win.
---
&gt; A bad spirit will lose every game, a good spirit will win every game.
---
But isn't that kind of mental gymnastics? You can't say every time a spirit beats you shes good and then when you lose she's bad. There are way too many factors that go into matches.
---
Who else has that? Nobody. Why would more than one killer have the same exact power? The point is he is not OP, not even close. You just need to get better.
---
I don’t play Tombstone Myers to win. I play Tombstone Myers to get a 4K and displease the entity because fuck tentacle hentai monsters
---
I don’t think it’d be “toxic” per say, but it doesn’t really make sense. Just rank up and get better teammates. No point in going down, especially if you’ll move back up as you play anyway
---
I agree, but it is almost impossible to not get hooked at least once against a good killer, and the perk should give you more autonomy in that scenario. But the downsides of the perks overshadow any benefits, and while the situation I mentioned is pretty rare, it is the most powerful effect deliverance can cause
---
Someone forgot to pray to RNGesus
---
I fail to see what the title has to do with a pic of the Demogorgon screaming after a hit...
---
for the 600th time, yes.
---
Go back to school, since by your own words, you have the knowledge of a 13yo since you quit school at 11-15yo. That's sad
---
Bot please, I wanted answers ;-;
---
On the plus side, the long queues made me pull out my copy of Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon
---
Simple mindgame potential. Having a TR of just 8 metres will render you less predictible once line of sight has been cutted.
---
This results in a much easier time to cut ways and punish Survivors for their movements. Sadly this is very map dependant, as this might work very well on for example The Game, or Lery's, as they're indoors (LoS being broken more consistently) but also offers lots of sideways to approach Survivors during a chase from several angles. On the other hand, playing this build on Rotten Fields might result in your perks being quite inefficient, and the result of the game relying more on your skill than on both, skill AND perks. Which's heavy in many scenario's, especially when you have no additional time that Ruin for example grants.
---
I must mention that this is only about the gimmicks of Furtive Chase tho. I'm very aware that this Perk is not meta or even close to it in any form. I simply enjoy to tinker with loadouts and potential synergies.
---
I know, killing everyone at the beginning of the game gets a depip too but apparently we live in lala land and everyone is saying that doesn’t happen lol. I’m getting called a liar for just saying a fact. I don’t even know what these people are on, I guess meth
---
But then again red rank killers should be the best of those around. I get when a rank 15 killer does not get a 4k every game but isn't red ranks like the top players who are the most skilled at the game? He has a point you know?
---
Ok explain how you get better in this situation I can break him out of stealth only for him to have a ping on my exact location how do you get better explain with something a little more helpful because quite frankly your responses seem a little killer sided I assume you are a ghost face user
---
He can only one shot if you’re unaware enough to spot him staring at you. As soon as you know it’s a gf you should always be rotating your camera to look for him. Hell, you should be doing that until you know for a fact it ISNT gf.
---
I actually got my "kill all survivors" mission done that way.
---
Me too man, me too, Except I try to be as wholesome as possible, When they act toxic and everything I just say 'Ggs' at the end and leave, but when someone doesn't go around clicking their flashlight and tbagging I take the defeat and onto the next game we go.
---
Adapt to what? tell me how im supposed to adapt to a spirit using stridor
---
I think if you as a killer main want to see how difficult he is to actually play and get a good stalk on someone you should play him for a while. I am in green ranks and it is a serious struggle to get it. He takes a lot of skill to get set up to even stalk someone, as everyone is running perks like spine chill. As soon as they are wise to you everyone is on the lookout. He is easily revealed then you’re basically just an M1 killer at that point. 
---
My advice to you is to start thinking like a killer when you are playing survivor. You’re working on a gen or approaching one. Think to yourself, if I was trying to sneak up on my right now how would I do it? How can I block myself from view? What’s my escape route if I get in a chase? Spine chill or any detection perk is a major counter. But game play style wise be stealthy yourself. Use cover to your advantage, don’t get seen. Make it hard for them to get line of sight on you.
---
Except bloodlust does nothing when at a thrown safe pallet. If yiour chasing into basement of preschool and they throw one of those pallets you just lose the chase if you dont break. Breaking the pallet resets BL, honestly now that im thinking about it what if that just didnt happen. Would be fine imo.
---
Solid b8.
---
You hit most major points, but I feel like you may have tried a bit too hard when you added leatherface.
---
Another thing, quality b8 should look real, like something a bad player could think, but this one doesnt.
---
I have to rate this 6/10. Not horrible, but you can do better.
---
As I stated it's not the one shot that bugs me its him getting a ping when he dosent notice you and you break him out of stealth
---
Not the point
---
Now that I think about it, I don’t know why I put Save. Forgot tombstone just grabs. However, nothing is funnier than mori’ng survivors in front of the exits, hence blood warden
---
I jUsT wAnNa PlAy WiTh My FrIeNdS, wE’rE nOt EvEn TrYhArD. gIt GuD bBy KiLlEr
---
Or something like that
---
.....what?
---
killer main here
---
if you're good at the game then a SWF shouldn't bother you since you should be able to easily wipe them out, no?
---
I don't think Xenomorph would work. It would have to be way too strong for it to stay true to the lore.
---
Pennywise definitely wouldn't work because he's not actually a slasher, but an interdimensional entity that feeds on fear. *It* has no physical form, and doesn't travel through conventional means. Seriously, can you imagine how silly it would look, to see Pennywise chasing people around? What weapon would he even use? Technically, *It* manifests itself as three orange lights (the Deadlights), which are rooted in the void surrounding our universe. Anyone who sees these lights is killed instantly or driven hopelessly insane, due to the human mind's inability to comprehend what it's seeing. The closest thing to *It's* true form is a huge spider-like creature, with red eyes and living saliva. Obviously that wouldn't work in DBD lol.
---
Jason is very unlikely, but the F13 game lost the license to the character, so it's still *possible*.
---
So yeah, Jack would be a great addition. My overall top pick is actually Pyramid Head (and James, as a survivor), but who knows if Konami is willing to whore out their licenses.
---
If Ghostface had no notification that he was being broken out he couldn't react and try to hide to avoid being broken out. It's important to know from where, because if the person is behind you ducking behind an object won't do much. Losing it would just give survivors too much power over his own power.
---
You mean it takes a normal amount of time to do anything, as currently everyone needs to run Hex: Ruin for the game to not end in 3 minutes.
---
They either spawn where you can’t get to them....or in the open where they are easy to see and you may as well have a sign up with an arrow pointing at it cleanse me!
---
They could still give the audio q just not the ping
---
The in game guy who wrote all the lore (can’t remember his name) said that during trials he would “sometimes be the one on the hook, sometimes be the one putting others on” so apparently killers and survivors both know what it’s like to be in each other’s shoes, but the entity torments the loser so they do whatever they need to do to win anyway
---
Fucking blendettes
---
People have been complaining about spirit for much longer then that
---
Try not looking at him wtf? He only gets the oneshot if your a dumbass and dont break him out of stealth in chase. You can break him out of stealth while running you know that right? If you cant that just means your pathing is aids.
---
Most maps are survivor favoured, loops are still insane (coal tower, haddonfield and the killer shack), at the start of this game there was placed where it was literally impossible for the survivors to be caught. Nurse was nerfed to being fair, spirit is fair (maybe not prayer beads) if you know that her shards glow up when she's phasing and there's still plenty of pallets all over the maps. Also you can escape in around 3 minutes if you're try harding. There's a lot of good perks like balanced, adrenaline, inner strength, lithe, dance with me, borrowed time and decisive (which I love as both survivor and killer). Want more?
---
Yeah, this format is wack.
---
uh...ok
---
Or you could just use spine chill.
---
So he know where you are, so what? Without his power he’s just another shitty M1 killer that gets looped. It sounds like you just need more experience on how to run killers for extended periods of time.
---
tip: never hide in lockers as David. he groans loudly when he gets in and out. also when vaulting, even slowly. 
---
it's like when the T-rex in Jurassic Park crashes through the fence and roars. I've actually though about photoshopping this, but I have no initiative.
---
Please I'm begging you, just save face and say this was a shitpost, it's so fucking funny
---
It gives you access to a few premium reddit features for a small amount of time, and costs real money. 
---
They only give golds out to incredible things that people love. 
---
And your doctor costume 100% deserves it (but, alas, I am broke)
---
I wish this was in game, i would get to 1 million instantly
---
Agreed
---
especially as David. that GROOOOOAAANNNN
---
I measured it and it's around 24m base, though it's stupid hard to hear in the last 4m.
---
The crossover we need. Who would the killer be though?
---
Yes same for me i finish the round and before i even see my score it does that a I’m stuck in a loading screen and it brings me back and no xp earned
---
I always let last person leave until I reach red ranks. Then I show no mercy, unfortunately it seems like toxicity increases the further up you go.
---
Finally! Someone understands that this game is asymmetrical and that either side can be biased! I'm a killer main and I understand why addons are a need.
---
The way I see it, survivor items are the equivalent to killer addons. And I'm pretty sure some killers can get by without addons and running meta perks.
---
As much as I wish or want to change some elements of the game. I gotta understand what the other side is going through, for example I don't like how long decisive strike is but I understand why it's in the game, it's so that other killer's don't tunnel. Or why NOED is so... independent(?), it's to give a killer more leverage during endgame and apply pressure on survivors to get out.
---
Enough of my rant, you deserve an upvote!
---
I searched hard to find the original artist for this Luigi so I could credit them, but I wasn't able to. Sorry if the person ever finds this!
---
BT is now completely balanced,DS has obsession(also don't tunnel) and adrenaline does very little compared to NOED
---
Mhm, or the deniers that flat out refuse to acknowledge that they are playing with an advantage by using out of game comms
---
Me seeing the same god damn meme on the same fucking format for the 4000th time
---
It's gotta be King Boo.
---
Entity: *Makes some killers too weak*
---
Those killers: *Are too weak to do a good match*
---
Entity: **This is the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals, maybe ever.**
---
Honestly over the past bloodhunt i've seen almost no spirits at red ranks. Its been ghostface city for me, i saw a total of 2 spirits and one of them sucked ass. Hell i even saw a clown before spirit.
---
The thing is that the spirit has all the info. And even still you have to guess. If you vault the window then you have to guess whether to vault back or not. Yeah, you can do better some games then others but no matter what it’s a guess. Spirits don’t need to predict you everytime, they just need to not fuck up. You don’t outplay a spirit, you let her outplay herself
---
Renaissance Man: You have a natural talent to do things others can't. Every time you are injured, gain a token, for a maximum of 3 tokens. Each token grants you a 5/10/15% bonus to any bloodpoint category.
---
"Don't worry, I got this! I hope..." -CollieRyan
---
A more ghostly style character besides the spirit would be nice. The body would be unusual if they kept him as he looks in Mario though.
---
Selfcare needs to go. All it does is slow the game down and without the crutch you actually get better. Brown medkit without add ons is better then selfcare.
---
I just crawled out of a game with one of those on I had like 3 seconds xD
---
By itself it's a pretty weak percentage. But it stacks pretty well with others.
---
I did a bunch of measuring of healing times while self-caring. Coulrophobia + Sloppy Butcher was 79 seconds. Adding Thanataphobia made it 86 seconds. So while the percentages look bad, the number of additional seconds added to the total time required can be big.
---
In my case it's 2-3 mins for survivor but like 9-10 for killer
---
This shows how much time you have when on the hook and why you shouldn't sacrifice yourself. Survivors can do quite a lot before launching a rescue attempt. Also, pallets near the basement should be resisted unless absolutely necessary.
---
It also shows how the game can fuck with you in unforeseeable ways.
---
thts why that perk kinda sucks :/
---
&gt; And I'm pretty sure some killers can get by without addons and running meta perks.
---
This is the very issue that OP was talking about; they're saying it's a problem that there are some killers who *can't* get by. Like, I swear that 75 percent of you didn't even read their post.
---
fellow jake main
---
No dude that's not what I'm talking about it's the location ping he gets when he isn't chasing you and you break him out is what bugs me I can usually spot him way before he sees me but he still gets notified of your location when you do it
---
Yeah this shit cracks me up, killer queues take for-fucking-ever and there's probably a killer out there waiting for every survivor and yet it still takes forever to find a match as a survivor or to fill a slot for a killer. Killer wait I can understand, survivor wait is clownshoes ridiculous.
---
That seems like another case of someone complaining about a gamer mechanic because they don’t personally like it. Wanna know why that’s a thing Ghostface can do? Because people can reveal him without being visible to him themselves. This would result in everyone hiding behind a window and staring him down, and he wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. Don’t like it? Learn to decide when to, or not to, reveal him, because nobody’s forcing you to reveal him every time you’re within 40 meters (the range in which you must be in to reveal him) of him. Simple as that.
---
And I’m curious; do you play Ghostface? And if so, what rank do you play him at?
---
Again, dont look at him? You can position your camera to see him but not break his stealth. Your not supposed to break him out for free homie, just let him kick the gen and leave
---
All good. I'm probably not on enough to warrant it. I appreciate the love it's getting though more than anything. Thanks
---
I really liked the vid, but if you speed up her charge and only do grass, I'll be seeing a lot of game offerings.  The rest of his points were great imo.  Watched him absolutely abuse survivors and see how easy it was to crush bc holy shit she is so fast.
---
My counter is if you flash her husk she returns back to it.  Also no collision.  No prayer beads, in return speed up her charge.  I don't want to 1v1 a killer but I need a way to outplay them long enough for 1-2 gens ffs.
---
I'm green rank and it's abysmal if spirit brings haunted and ruin with beads and how she is.  I don't DC, I just try to not depip.  It feels like blendette is queen vs spirit and I hate that style, so much.
---
I cannot figure out for the life of me why this comment is downvoted. Did the survivor mains just go on a fucking rampage in here or something?
---
Nothing against drag queens but she legit looks more terrifying than Huntress.
---
To take care of my cancer sick father. 
---
But it’s nice to see you’ve resorted to things outside the game because you can’t refute these facts.
---
So you're telling me that I should get rid of my build, forgoe all of my favorite perks, and dedicate my entire build towards having a chance against a killer that I might not even face?
---
And you don't think that's even a **little** concerning? Especially from a game balance standpoint?
---
You adding Leatherface and saying he is broken clearly this is shitpost or you’re actually just stupid. Nothing else to be said here.
---
The BM at the end was a nice touch ;)
---
*internal pain*
---
If it doesn’t bug you, why did you even mention it?
---
Bro this is a fucking banger
---
yeah i get that. people aren’t scared in red ranks so just doing the objective isn’t fun, so they play like assholes. i’m guilty of doing things to prolong the chase so gens can get done. some people might consider them toxic—palette looping, blinds, stuff like that. i don’t teabag but i do use game mechanics to my advantage in ways green and yellow ranks are too scared of being hit to use. i think that’s the main difference
---
Alien is owned by fox which is owned by Disney and Disney isnt going to let anything not owned by Disney use that license. It has been over a year now and Victor Miller AKA some guy who hates fun has not repealed the lawsuit and I really dont think gun media gives a damn. This extremely simple thought process I am about explain completely goes over way too many people's heads but, obviously Friday the 13th the game is going to get it's right back LEAPS and BOUNDS sooner than a dbd is. Obviously the creators of f13 know about dbd, and will more than likely make a deal with Victor Miller (if he ever revokes his lawsuit) that he can not allow the rights to f13 fall into the hands of the very similar financial competitor of dbd.
---
I can’t unsee white Claudette
---
Hmmm nice name dude figured such I'm a killer main to however even being a killer main I think that's a bit much he has 0 terror radius first off while in shroud hes 99 % black no red stain if you cant sneak up on ppl maby it's you that's got the issue here and you have to be visible you stating that is false your character has to have a los to him you cant do it threw bushes
---
PC here, I lag so hard with the spirit's cosmetic and I wasn't sure why
---
How is that a joke? It’s a raw statement.
---
&gt; i would say Billy, huntress, spirit, nurse, freddy, and maybe hag depending on the map dont need addons to do good at high ranks
---
I'm just gonna chime in to say that if you use add-ons for Huntress you will never be able to play her without them. It's imperative to know how to use the hatchets without them winding up more quickly, hindering the survivors, and increasing your movement speed as you ready a hatchet.
---
Also Hag 100 percent needs distance add-ons because the base teleportation is very small
---
I learned that people will be toxic no matter what you do. I just play however I want now, and skip the post-game chat.
---
Ok that makes more sense but that's a rather strong killer in that case
---
What you observe is whether they assume you stayed at the loop or tried to move on, or whether they stand still often without using the power, or whether they prefer to go a certain direction around a loop.
---
You get to see the results of the power even if you can't see her use it.
---
Or run self care blendette hit every locker and wait for everyone to die before you.  Who is that fun for?
---
True, but they also wipe the floor with anyone below a certain level of skill. That’s the problem.
---
The Legion are not older than Jeff. Frank is presumed to be 18-19, with the rest of the gang being younger but in high school. Jeff was visiting his hometown of Ormond when the group commissioned a mural, and paid him for it with beer which Frank could legally purchase in the province of Alberta. Presumably, the entity just decided Jeff would be a good fit for the survivor for the Legion, taking him shortly after them.
---
Haha, I'm sorry. The killer was being toxic that whole game and he deserved it. Even if he wasn't near me, I had to get a bag on him
---
Read the initial post it's the ping that's kinda fucked
---
We should just get cross play and no one will have problems!!
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand say goodbye to your karma!
---
I feel like the dull key should only open the hatch for the user of the key then close the hatch again whilst the skeleton key should leave the hatch open completely.
---
I think that it's better to actually take steps to counter a killer that you suck against then it is to do nothing and bitch about it on reddit.
---
I assumed you did tbh.  You try Google?
---
Yea ur prob right about hag, but i never use addons on huntress to avoid that lmao
---
Thanks ! Will change that up ! Was the video itself good/entertaining ?
---
F in the chat for palleh
---
It's actually when you add the gens and the survivors up together to get 5 or less in total
---
The last time I got a Tapp he DC’d as soon as he saw me. I was Pig using a Mori, so maybe that’s why (it was my first Mori and I thought it would be cool to get a Tapp as my first Mori but that’s besides the point)
---
You did a really great job on the hook.  The rest might need work but I can't draw for shit so wdik
---
This happens to me, someone will be unhooked half way across the map and I don’t even bother walking that way then 2 mins later I see them healing with nurses so I down em and omg I tunnelled them! 😂

If the ridiculously imbalanced things were reduced or removed, it would then in turn reduce the amount of DCs drastically since there is less reasons to DC. I get that there will always be people that DC but you can't have harsh punishments for a non competitive casual game or else it would reduce more fun than the actual DCs because realistically most people don't want to play against a syringe swf, iridescent huntress,beads spirit or whatever else imbalanced thing is in the game. Also even if they did create DC penalties then what's going to happen is more people will just start throwing games,so there is no real fix.
---
Ps4 Westcoast herr killer ques never instant rank 8 but I get red ranks and 6-8 mixed Survior I am rank 5 play with friends que can be anywhere from 5 minutes to 20
---
Uh, no it is not beside the point. If his base kit needs buffing then it 100 percent means that he is add-on dependent because almost all of his add-ons are basic quality of life shit that would go into a base kit buff
---
Plenty of PC players out there who use controllers, unless you know for certain this was on XBOX?
---
You’d be depressed too if you left your dog abandoned  in the real world. :(
---
I like trappers its just I'm too broke to get it
---
Yeah, in those situations it's almost always the fault of the Survivors if they get three-genned.  Unless a Killer is like hardcore camping those three gens while others are still up and slugging everyone, you can complete at least one of them so you're not locked into a three-gen chokehold.
---
Bin bag man
---
I just rather not waste money on cosmetics lol. 
---
I know it’s a event skin but last year I wasn’t there for Halloween lol.
---
So by that logic, Wraith is OP because he’s almost completely invisible and has the Undetectable status effect. Also, I asked you if you play *Ghostface*. So I will restate my question: do you play Ghostface, and if so what rank do you play him at? Because if you do, then you’ll understand that Ghostface is, by no means, overpowered despite his strength. Actually, he can be pretty hard to play. This is just a case of you not knowing how to counter him.
---
And what do you mean “nice name dude figured such”? I don’t understand what you mean by that.
---
I did it because I was bored
---
As bad as an invincible ruin is, it’s better than invincible devour hope!
---
I'm baffled that you've been doing this for so long. But it's good
---
That doesn’t answer the question. Why even mention his stealth power if it doesn’t bother you?
---
I disagree.
---
just gonna take a wild stab you play on console, right?
---
I got spirit with my serum
---
2 biggest scares in the game for me are survivors pallet stunning me in dead silence with no idea they are there
---
Whoops
---
I can definitely see what your going for and with the right target audience I think your golden at times your audio seemed a little loud but other then that better then most I've seen.
---
Actually, I’m pretty sure he moved there and met Frank years afterwards. Maybe he was around, say, 20 when Frank asked him to draw a mural for him, while Frank was only 17 or 18.
---
If you're gonna repost a meme, at least don't make it into a hehe trans bad helicopter good meme
---
Just draw about something you like while using a letter that's related to it so I picked dbd while my friends picked, jojo, mario, and minecraft.
---
This is bait, poor bait.
---
I just faced a purple rank team with a key and I just didn't let them get a single gen done :) Keys aren't OP.
---
Where are mods for this?  I clocked random 3 and of course all are up.
---
Blame the community itself. They tried adding a second objective but people had to ruin it.
---
We can't have nice things.
---
It’s probably due to complaints etc. from last year lol.
---
Wraith has to un cloak you hear and see him a mile away regardless of him being cloaked or not and he gets 0 notification ever even if some one sees him he gets hard punished if you flashlight him while cloaked o and he cant 1 shot you so no not even close to as strong as gf
---
David looks like he being played by Jared Leto
---
Sprint burst, lithe, dead hard and balanced landing
---
Yes, because a minority of players screamed and cried really loudly a lot last year and killed the chance of ever having a good Halloween event this year
---
&gt;Youre worst nightmare
---
Seems "youre" worst nightmare is grammar and spelling.
---
I’m sorry if i offended anyone. That truly was never the meaning of this. I made this in ms paint in like two minutes
---
So good that it's made my Legion matches viable.
---
*squint*
---
alright buddy, you get a pass this time, but y'better have proof next time
---
What is that? (Noob here)
---
Sure, but he’s still almost invisible, so he can put himself in a position that makes escaping him more difficult. Meanwhile, Ghostface is completely visible. And you still haven’t answered my question: do you play Ghostface? Like, at all?
---
Yeah it’s kinda shitty to drop rank on purpose just to get easier lobbies. This is why I don’t like YouTube or Twitch because they do this a lot to get clips of them bullying lower rank killers. Jerk move
---
If you are facing away from the exit being downed is not safe but she was too far anyway. Also 8 stack stbfl got a kill yesterday with that made me hot
---
Another one bites the dust
---
Oh well pablo made it from some metal scraps he found so... and his screw driver isnt a match for a mindless, unkillable man with no soul and a kitchen knife
---
You need to talk, friend?
---
Ooh, Exhaustion build, interesting. If only we had a perk to reduce exhaustion faster.
---
Basically the halloween event is just getting a bit of bloodpoints. Combine this with the fact that it is 2x bloodpoints and you get a pointless event. Why add the halloween event if you get the rewards from a pass that lasts 69 days?
---
Honestly think they're the weakest of the strong items. A purple toolbox/bnp or instaheal can save much more time than a key can. A key just cheats partial victories, it doesn't win games.
---
What kind of neck beard shit is this?
---
Imma be honest fam, that not cleansing strat has never worked for me.
---
Thanks ! I will try my best to improve &amp; will make the audio better soon. Thank you so much for your feedback and time !
---
Thats only if you fully reveal him. During the sound effect leaking up to the reveal he gets small silver notifications to the left or right of his screen to point him the revealers direction
---
Accidentally hits the crouch button 
---
Killers: Enemy spotted
---
I was amazed at some asshole that played ghostface the other day.
---
Somehow he was rank 6 but his strategy was basically hunt one survivor, stealth camp him, tunnel him if he gets rescued, repeat till dead.
---
He only got 2 of us but I wonder how in the heck did that garbage strategy got him carried to rank 6.
---
Thats when you fully break him, during the revealing proccess its only directional. If you fully reveal then you should of already been running
---
its live, came out with the archives I'm pretty sure
---
Looks kinky r/dbdgonewild

---
):&lt;
---
Save the best for last. Every time you hit a survivor your weapon cooldown is reduced by 5%, up to 8 stacks. Lose 2 stacks if you hit your obsession
---
You could try, but be ready to have only 2 perks up during half the match when survivors find them.
---
Haha I remember doing this project in school. Hope you’re having fun!
---
I’ll never camp, but if a team wants to try and get someone off in front of me, or play games around the hook, I’m probably not going anywhere
---
Our hero in time of need
---
Prayer beads is busted as shit and needs to be removed 
---
Put it this way, people wont go out of there way to find Lullaby, but they will go out of their way to find ruin. Them going out of their way to find ruin makes it really likely they will find both totems and thus two dead perks when they are popped.
---
They work well together when alive and fully stacked, but the time it takes to get 5 stacks will not happen if they are actively seeking lit totems.
---
It's complicated. They definitely favor new survivors and try to balance the game for them as much as they can because it can be brutal as a fresh new survivor. They want new players to stay and not be discouraged. But then as people get better and rank up, the game becomes more and more difficult for Killers. It's a bit of a mess.
---
Yeah you’re drunk my man Adam is way better than Tapp
---
We don't even know what you are talking about in the post though :I
---
Imagine Ghost face  and myers lol fucking shit up
---
IMO, it's not worth. If you already have those hexes unlocked, you probably already have other good options. Your totems can get hit in less than a minute, so you'd be in a game with just 2 perks.
---
2 totems are hard to defend and honestly lullaby isnt good, it takes too long to get an effect
---
Ask the community. No one says "SuRVivOrs tOXic plS BaN"
---
Thats becuase you cant. You can play with other pc players but steam invite list runs through steam friends, there is no DBD friends list.
---
Since it's been an hour since he said this, I assume he isn't going to do it, so I will.
---
1) Nurse is already nerfed, spirit can be countered with iron will which is really good against all killers, and leatherface isn't S or A tier killer. The fact that he can instadown doesn't make him good. Hillbilly isn't good just for being able to instadown, he can also move long distances quickly which makes him good.
---
2) I don't get what you mean in the third paragraph, maybe it something they made in that patch, idk, but maps aren't killer favoured, you just have to learn how to loop and combine the structures. 
---
3) BBQ can be easily countered by moving towards one direction and then go to the opposite direction, or just hide in a locker. Save the best for last just reduces the time between hits, but it isn't very OP. And about the add-ons, survivors also have items and add-ons that are OP. With toolboxes and good add-ons you can finish a gen by your own really quickly.  With flashlights you can release a survivor and make the killer spend more time. Keys are very OP, a killer can be playing very good, but even if the 4 survivors are potatoes, they just have to find the hatch and they can escape without doing anything.
---
4) There are many more OP survivor perks than the ones you mention. Iron will, completely reduces your sound, which is very useful for killers to find survivors. Adrenaline is really OP, a killer might spend 2 minutes trying to down a survivor, then adrenaline pops and he gets up. Object of obsession is also a constant wallhack, but it still works against many killers. I won't continue because there are many more OP perks.
---
If you don't believe me, try to play as a killer to see if everything is as favoured for killers as you say, because this is the same bs that people that just main one side say, survivors complain
---
don't forget distressing
---
Are you being serious?
---
People in the dbd discord server makes fun of me for being a huntress main
---
There are some bugs where you can get stuck in an infinite queue or loading screen. Restart your game if it takes too long.
---
Not gonna waste my vision time. I just know it’s full of delusions already. 
---
Killers have built in perks 
---

It feels like the moment i bring a medkit with addons i get paired with a plague.

Damn, that sucks, I just got a reply from BHVR that said it may be implemented in the future but they have no timescale. Quite unfortunate :/

That's what you get for recording vertically

Now that can be pretty arguable

That’s why they’ll never do it 😂

BHVR: \*It's a feature\*

I sent a ticket to support and they said they were aware of the issue and are trying to fix it. As of now, I am still not able to complete any challenges.
---
I see the problem... Myres is still wearing a shirt...
---
You can chase the obsession with killers like demo
---
That only happens if they were trying to stalk you and you break them out of Shroud, and it only reveals your aura for like 2 seconds. They were on to your ass already anyway. -_- JFC just play Ghostface for like a day ‘killer main’ you will see what everyone is talking about.
---
I usually block “gg” losers. 
---
Don’t need betas like that in my game. I’m looking for a challenge.
---
It is a use for my 320 wreath offerings
---
Id like to see it be the ability to play the killer with their teachable at tier 3 and green addons of your choice, for as long as you have the challenge activated.
---
Your problems are your own and if the solution is walking away... you should do that! I'm not into the whole cradling millennial's balls, you believing that everything said to you attacks you personally because it's not your opinions is your problem, I don't need to solve your problems for you! You should have wizened up, but it's all about you isn't it, it's all about the dipstick that couldn't keep his mouth shut and now has to regain the high ground by whining even more about how he ges attack personally?
---
Can you tell me how it feels to be so weak that mere words hurt you? If you want to stand for something wear armor, wear it until it's dinged and bruised and rusted, you aren't  knight in shining armour fighting for others, okay! Knights in shining armor are fighters that have never been in a fight, you never had your mettle tested, wear your bruises with pride or don't start something you can't finish without hiding behind personal assaults!
---
**- Also I'm not seeing any counter argument so I guess you're done trying to go against my point that the perk level lock out is an unneeded part of the game?**
---
I gave you my idea in my first reply to you, since then you started blabbering about personal assault to derail the entire argument and haven't brought anything new to the table there was no need to re-chew the cud master debater! I gave you the option to saddle up and walk away, I'll do it again...
---
Just stop whining about yourself, and how you feel assaulted, swallow hard, walk away it's that easy! You're the one that originally replied to me okay, You obviously though I was wrong and now you dug yourself into a hole you can't get out without loosing face, that's what this has become... You aren't even a pain in my ass yet, you're a mild itch! Be smart, walk away! I don't need a sorry, I don't want excuses, I don't need anything from you, I don't even harbour you ill will, that's all between your ears, just be smart and walk away!
---
It's not even fun anymore when you make breaking you down so easy... I'm starting to feel sorry for you at this point! *(Not because of the insults mind you, just because you still don't get the whole point of what you changed this debate about.)*
---
Keys are boring tbh most of the time it justg ends the game early
---
If you can't play 15 matches in 7 hours in the US thats a problem. I even play during offpeak hours and i get games within 10 minutes

Not to shit on pc or anything and I can’t say for sure but I believe dedicated servers will benefit more for a console thing considering about 80% or more people use WiFi while playing console so the connections are way worse so the P2P connection are just horrendous especially with the matchmaking. I live in NA East and every other match I get a killer from a different country mainly Spain and South America so with them being a country away or across seas plus with them using WiFi will cause really shitty connections and lag. That’s just my input and I could be wrong so idk

If ruin is giving you so much grief, just run small game. I do, it's great.Be the change you want to see.
---
Oh look the toxic killer has found his voice
---
It’s not necessarily the 4 basement hooks that’s the issue, that’s a 1/30 games thing for me. The issue is survivors tend to get salty and disconnect, which will ruin the challenge
---
Lmao ya it's basically every other thread at this point
---
They could do it with ghostface. They only need licensing for the mask, but Jed Olsen is their own character
---
I wonder if people that downvote this post think I did the more than 1 killer exploit and dislike it bc of that just a funny observation

I get consistent 90 ping on Xbox, so do most people I talk to. If it works anything like pc is right now then I hope it doesn’t come to console

This is actually alot like my Stealth build, except no Spine Chill and Sprint Burst, I could make this, sounds fun, and would give me a Stealth build with an increased escapability factor to it.
---
If you read the parent comment I responded to,  it should be glaringly obvious that I'm not actually claiming you should be punished for having ttv in your name.
---
Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see? Do you know how many bloodpoints I make a year? I mean, even if I told you you wouldn't believe it. Do you know what would happen if I suddenly stopped killing? A realm big enough to be listed in the multiverse would go belly-up. Disappears\*! It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to. I am not triggered, Nea, I am the trigger. A guy wanders by the exit gate and gets downed and you think that of me? **I am the one who hooks**.
---
\*\^bing \^bong
---
What? I just said that I’m bad at survivor, and it was one of my first games as Survivor when I played against him. And I would’ve beaten him if I knew how to loop.
---
You wanted this. My “Slug Me I Double Dare Ya” build:
---
No Mither, Unbreakable, Tenacity, Flip Flop.
---
At least 30 an hour. But not this month. Save it for DDD
---
Ive been in more than a few lobbies where someone in pre-game chat is trying to organise a gen rush. If it didnt exist then why do so many people actively try to implement it?
---
As a killer main, I can say this is completely accurate
---
-squeals in No Mither temptation-
---
As a survivor main, who actually reads chat. You'd be suprised.
---
So it was a potato ghost face that probably didnt even know how to play and you being so very knowledgeable about the games mechanics still died that explains alot.
---
You stole my comment
---
Using DH and BL on the same build never felt so great. Got Shelter? Use Dedard. Got Haddonfield? Infinite loops
---
Toxic people: **omg nerd spirit she op**
---
Me: what about how swf is just a massive buff and no way to see if it is a team
---
Toxic people: *YoUr JuSt BaD aT tHe GaMe GiT gUd*
---
Alright, you clearly are just hearing what you want to hear. But yeah, he *was* a potato Ghostface. I was just terrible at Survivor.
---
If I am not almost done with a gen and remotely close by I will unhook them because even if they are potatoes my odds are still better with them alive.
---
It would be a good idea to read the post and not just the title
---
RIP Susie
---
You playing 1 game as a survivor gives you 0 say according to your own words earlier sir
---
It's que time?
---
The Mods definitely need to change something because /r/deadbydaylight has been like this for a long time.
---
Oh I did, trust me. If you want the short version, it went something like this:
---
-
---
"I didn't receive the rewards. -&gt; Sorry for that, we fixed it now. -&gt; Uhh, I still don't have the rewards. -&gt; Send us your Player Cloud ID so we can fix this. -&gt; Okay, here is my ID. -&gt; *no answer for 4 days* -&gt; Yeah if you don't have the points by now, you didn't complete the experiment. K thanks bye."
---
After that, they marked the ticket as "solved", and nothing more came of it. If you'd like the longer version, you can look through the entire exchange [HERE](https://i.imgur.com/XBm87Nk.jpg), if you care to read it.
---
It’s accurate for both killer and survivor lmao
---
If you say so, I don’t have much trouble with it
---
Faster everything is pretty fun to mess with. 
---
Sprint burst, tenacity, urban evasion, fixated,
---
It doesnt matter where you're going but you'll be doing it fast!
---
It's funny, tenacity actually has saved my life way more than it should have. Killers never expect it.
---
What? I’ve still played as and against Ghostface, so I still do have a say. You, on the other hand, have only seen half.
---
Oh of course! It’d be like trying to recast someone like Indiana Jones or Neo—it just wouldn’t feel the same, ya know?
---
i dont want my hex ruin to survive a whole game but longer than 30 seconds each game would be nice. this was the 6th time my ruin got cleansed 30 seconds in the game. i really dont mind survivors finding my totem but why does it always have to be at the start of the game man. i have tears of joy if my ruin keeps up for more than 1 and a half minute tbh
---
What about Self Care? That's one of the more selfish perks to use.

And you missed?
---
Balanced Landing, Spine Chill, Bond, and Lightweight.
---
OH! That makes sense now. That’s why I was confused, I couldn’t tell if you were poking a little fun
---
I think spirit is fine, though it does feels kinda cheesy that you can literally outplay people by standing still.
---
Not too sure why this is getting downvoted so much. Why is it controversial that all Killers should be viable without add-ons? Both sides should be both good and fun
---
What do you think PC players to use to game?
---
Whenever Quentin gets to switch I’d switch out SB for vigil in that build, since SB makes the others impossible to use
---
I can relate when it comes to legion or trapper🙃
---
i got left on the hook 'cause i opened a chest near a Nancy hidden in a locker (probably to loot the chest but i didn't know she was there)... she came out of it while i was searching it, then she got the flashlight i left there, and when i was on the hook she just left the flashlight under me while i was struggling. felt so good to see her get destroyed tbh. They get salty for the most stupid things honestly...
---
Yeah but we’ll see because what they have on pc isn’t the final version. They’re still testing it and gathering data from pc matches.
---
Just did a readthrough, thats tough. Only thing i can think of is that you somehow didnt flag the test correctly, what was the last  test for?
---
If a survivor loses to a killer it’s “op need nerf”
---
Shut up about the sun! Deathcore!

It was released 2 Days Ago on Microsoft Store pretty sure you got it consufed with steam

I got this
---
Your knack for procrastinating and succeeding gets you somewhere.
---
You become the obsession. For each survivor hooked, you gain 3% repair speed and 5% movement speed for 15 seconds after every hook.
---
When the gens are done, you are permanently exhausted and suffer a 10% movement speed penalty.
---
*finally, it is done. I need a break, I feel like I am gonna pass out*
---
How exactly? I mean everyone has to learn at some point, and to not-die-as-fast is part of it, it only deoends in tje killer interpretation, and let me tell you, those who get mad at a single pallet stun are never gonna get better
---
Sir please stop looking into DBD players wet dreams
---
Killer was able to get up there too. It was a pig and she didn’t even ambush
---
What is that at the top ?
---
Dbd is one of those games I have a huge love/hate relationship with. I love the concept, the original killers, the fact that they can get licensed killers,... But the balance is something I've been struggling with from the start and that holds me back from playing it as much as I'd like to. I've been playing survivor more now which are pretty chill games but killer is where it's at for me and it sucks I can't play killer without all the frustration and stuff.
---
The BS I used to get from survivors when I hit them on the hook. The reports were mental
---
A mistake
---
IMO, yes, you are going to ruin the fun for quite a few killers at that big of a rank difference, not to mention fucking over your teams to depip.
---
OOF
---
Idk, if nobody is doing gens, ghem killer has time to camp.
---
You are not applying enough pressure, survivors.
---
Chopped blueberry with prayer beads.
---
IS and inner strength synergyise with the rest of the build though. IS if you have ds active lets you either heal if the killer waits for the ds timer, or you full heal and get away with a stun. If IS isnt active then you get the stun when ds runs out, if you got in a locker without the ability to get head on, ds or IS then you kinda inted.
---
Shitposts are supposed to be funny
---
The requirements they sent to me looked like [THIS](https://i.imgur.com/wymmFQ8.png). And I swear they even later clarified that you could play for example 10 killer games + 10 survivor games and it would be alright, as long as you played 20 of them total, but I couldn't find the message containing that. I can tell you that I followed these rules to a T. No SWF, no items, no perks... I didn't even dare take items from chests, because even as I was completing the experiment, I had a gut feeling that it would count those as "against the rules" anyway, what with BHVR's track record and all.
---
The only Pay2Win is the Blendette cosmetics lol.
---
I thought it would be lackluster, assuming I'd have to avoid the obsession all the time. But in practice, it's great. You can get enough stacks that you're still getting a benefit even if you chase the obsession. And if the first survivor you encounter is the obsession, go ahead and hook him to build map pressure.
---
when i see 2+ toolboxes pop up that’s when i either bring an ebony mori or find a new lobby
---
My statement was sarcastic. If the post isn’t about pallet stunning being toxic and was instead about being a ‘man’ or not, then apparently new players aren’t men
---
I own the game on PC and Xbox and hits connect way worse on PC maybe just my experience though

I brought a full healing build with a great medkit and everything since I had the challenge and a Claudette daily and got a Plague. Lost my medkit too 😭

Same for Moris

kinda crazy then. The only thing that i can think triggered the rulebreak was that you did a killer game when you signed up for a certain side only. Unlucky

Frank's story takes place in Ormond, the place Jeff moves *from* after making the mural.

Learn how to loop a killer? This is literally no different than any other killer spotting you. Just run them around. Based on your responses, I assume you're a rank 20 because you clearly are just bad. I'm not being killer sided. I play 50/50 killer and survivor. Ghostface does NOT need a nerf.
---
Link me that game clip
---
I'm pretty sure Monto has used it before in videos if you want to see how it works.
---
yes, thank you, the cooldown throws off so much of my timing, like i cant tell you how many times i miss my chain blink window because my blink needed to charge like .2 seconds longer.
---
Joe who?
---
So nothing.  Sadly
---
Don’t forget if you chase a survivor more than 5 seconds you’re tunneling
---
bruh I forgot to quote. rip joke
---
Failing No Nut November I see ghostface.
---
How havent you received hate mail? Ive been playing for like 5 days, and ive gotten hate mail multiple times. They were all stupid, like one said Huntress was OP, but still.
---
&gt;i dont want my hex ruin to survive a whole game but longer than 30 seconds each game would be nice. this was the 6th time my ruin got cleansed 30 seconds in the game.
---
Nice try but you had Corrupt Intervention and it shows there 60s had passed already. 
---
&gt; i really dont mind survivors finding my totem but why does it always have to be at the start of the game man.
---
Do you even understand the purpose of Ruin? It is purely made to force survivors into totem hunting within the first minute after they become aware of it. For as long as they are running around the map, the match is in your favor. 
---
If 3 survivors are running around the map looking for the totem and your totem still gets destroyed within 60s, you just earned yourself 60s of zero progress on generators (a gen takes 80s to complete). 
---
Anyhow, this discussion is regarding totem spawns and I still believe you got a nice one. I agree that some maps and some spawns need to be fixed but the majority of them are fine.
---
Oh, i didn't noticed it was sarcasm, everyone becomes a man at some point

---
If the survivors continue to work on gens, you mean. I've played many a game where 3/4 survivors completely give up on doing gens altogether and spend the whole match looking for the totem.

---
No no, that's the thing. In the entry survey, you could tick either Killer or Survivor, depending on which you preffered to play. But that had no bearing on the actual test, because people received different E-mails based on the role they were assigned. So some had "Play at least 20 full matches as the Survivor", others "Play at least 20 full matches as the Killer" and others again "Play at least 20 full matches as the Killer or Survivor". I received the ambiguous one.
---
Pretty sure they'll stay indefinitely but once the event has ended you can only buy them with auric cells

Not every killer should be dirt easy to go against, and survivors hate that she is challenging

---
Sorry bro, you aren’t epic enough.
---
Thinking new nurse is broken 😂
---
Definitely not. Spirit bad is is the majority consensus but I don’t think that’s a bad thing. You don’t see people saying “Billy bad” or “Myers bad” for a reason. She needs legitimate changes, she’s just a bullshit killer. 
---
But on the other hand I also think Nurse base kit didn’t need any changes. I’m shit at Nurse, but seeing gameplay from people who took shit ton of hours to get good at her is okay with me. But the addons for multi blinks could get fucked. 
---
And I also think that the lower tier killers (Doc, Legion and Pig) should be get buffs before anything else gets changed. And not every killer needs to be Billy level, or to get reworks to be as strong as Freddy as well. For ex, Hag with addons is good where she is, Myers, and Huntress. Ghostface too.
---
a base killer should always be viable against equally skilled survivors, the killer is supposed to be the power role in this game, not the survivors.
---
I did the same earlier on spirit with just BBQ and Shadowborn. Even without a stacked build it was easy

Now you know your lesson never go in lockers
---
Diddo
---
 It's fast as killer but takes very long as survivor for me here in central Europe
---
This argument is completely wrong, let me tell you why.
---
"One of the best killers" okay, but that's in terms of "great effect when played," not "well-designed." Excuse me, but if there was a killer who instantly killed all survivors as they loaded into the match, wouldn't that be a "great killer"? It means nothing. Being a powerful killer is no inherent positive.
---
The issue is that Spirit is NOT FUN to play against. Your options against her are a coin flip. Is she using her power? Yes or no? If you guess wrong, you get hit. If you guess correctly, you don't feel like you've accomplished anything, just a wipe of the sweat from your forehead as you get maybe ten seconds respite from her. You haven't outplayed her, you just guessed on a coin flip. Spirit gives no information to survivors that allow them to counterplay her aside from rushing generators and leaving as fast as possible: Let me tell you, this isn't fun for either side. No survivor wants to M1 for the entire round, and no killer wants to have their games end in 4 minutes. 
---
I've been rank 1 since the day the game came out, and I can say with certainty that every killer is viable there. All of them. Some are better, some are worse. You absolutely cannot put down a blanket statement that "Everyone except X is trash," it doesn't promote or advance discussion. True might believe that the only way to play at Rank 1 is with Ruin, tunnel, camp, and slug, but he's an idiot. 
---
Remember how old Legion was really weak, but was basically unstoppable in chases because he was next to guaranteed to kill you after a certain amount of time? This is the same problem. Spirit is next to guaranteed to kill you after a certain amount of time, and you don't have any counterplay options.
---
Agreed. There's a couple day window there where I'll be nice, I don't wanna shit in anyone's cereal and make them feel bad after all, but FFS it's the 4th of novemeber now. Enough already.

Most if not all PC players use a cable and put the desktop right next to the router

They are! So after I kill 1 person I play around the hook like attempt to down someone within range of the hook.
---
Eeeeeh not really since you can get them to pop up pretty easily. And if you're last survivor and hatch gets closed just reopen it. If I have a bunch of survivors who I see farming or trolling I'll open hatch confront of a killer and watch them run in terror
---
I had a moment like this with Tombstone Myers. 😁
---
If 4 survivors get out with a key, they were going to win anyway. The only thing they had left to do was open a door.
---
Jules is my mami
---
Ah. Yeah, I didn’t completely remember his lore, so I gave it a quick re-read alongside the Legion’s. Here’s my explanation:
---
Jeff was a Senior in high school, 17 years old, when Frank gave him the mural request. Frank was not a legal adult yet, either, because then he couldn’t have been adopted, so I have deduced that Frank was likely 16 and a Junior in high school by using knowledge and timeframes from Jeff’s backstory. After, let’s say, 2 years, Jeff got hurt and spent around a year after that in art school, then went to visit Ormond and was taken by the Entity. That would make him 20, while Frank has already been confirmed to be 19, alongside the other 3 teens in his gang. 
---
And that’s my explanation.
---
ok Boomer 🤡
---
I'm 50/50 as well though I use killer slightly more so probably 60/40 and no I'm not rank 20 but nice dig see we got another charmer in the room. It is different in ever sense as he gets notifications on everything. Including when you break him from shroud which is just dumb. slivers not so bad give a general direction but no hes right there ping cuz you saw him first and he wasn't being stealthy enough way to easy to find ppl I personally think. So he can 99% stalk you gets a notification if you look at him gets a ping on your location if you break his shroud and if you chose not to break it he can one shot you if he sees you. seems cool guess we will just continue seeing the ever growing flood of ghost face thanks for yet another useless yet toxic as usual dbd comment. Slap on nurses calling no need for whispers has that basically build in slap on bbq and you will be back in a stalk in no time dont even gotta try to be actually stealthy  dude straight black with 0 terror radius and if they break you out of it hey your in a chase again no issue
---
Outstanding move

I have 4k hours and the majority of my friends on average have 700 to 2k hours. Non of us find dead hard an issue as killer and frequently get screwed over by its buggyness as survivor or get slapped bc the killer waited. R1 killers will often wait before they even know you have it. We all dropped it bc it was so unreliable after dedicated servers. And  I dont see why huntress cant mind game dead hard too...
---
And yet when I have to disturb 25 of those idiots for the archives, I find one fucking crow in three matches. Hahaha
---
You still have no grasp on the concept of time
---
while you get camped your teammates get gens done, if you really want to be a whiney baby who can't wait 1 minute to die (2 if you struggle) while watching a youtube video then kill yourself on hook, but even then, holy shit can you not wait for a 1-2 minutes to help your team get stuff done?
---
Hu. Im on xbox to. Maybe Huntess is annoying to play against ot something.
---
Sometimes, yes. There are a lot of variables of course, but the answer is in the core mechanics and numbers.    
---
Survivors have to complete 5 generators, each taking 80 seconds at base speed, can be faster. They can also spread out and do multiple generators at the same time.  
---
The Killer has to win up to 12 chases, which at advanced ranks can take a while, and only being able to commit to one at a time. There is just a lot more to be done, and not much time to do it.    
---
That's why experienced Killers try their best to create a snowball effect and instead of focusing on killing, the focus is more on "what can I do to keep as many of the survivors off generators to buy myself some damn time". And good killers are good at this, they will win a lot, but sooner or later those numbers catch up with you and even the best killers will have matches where they just feel powerless no matter what decisions they made.  
---
From personal experience, I actually enjoy this state of things. I'm one of the crazy dudes that will rewatch my killer matches to improve on little mistakes. But honestly it can be exhausting, while Survivor is where I go to chill. A lot of people feel it should be the other way around.
---
If you have a key and left behind you will win the endgame
---
yes of course! no ahoy! cap though, because it covers my best feature (and also screw company policy)

Or no memes that couldn't possibly have taken more than 10 minutes to make. Just nuke them. Take them to r/ColdwindFarm.

Maybe
---
That's your opinion, but seeing as how virtually nobody else is complaining about ghostface, I would suggest you just try to get better. He is easily beatable.
---
Survivors addons cost 50% more bps, and survivors mostly get less bps in matches. Also killer's addons are much more impactful. If u want to make killers viable without addons then u gotta make all the things i mentioned above equal too.

I always thought that luck should also come into the hatch spawn, idk if it would work but the higher the luck the closer to you the hatch might spawn

Whoa, be careful or you might cut yourself on that edge
---
 You as a survivor is clearly not punishing the killer for camping. Seriously, the easiest way to deal with camping is to gen rush. It’s enough for a solo gen to be 80% completed for a survivor to be on his first hook and then camped to death. That’ll be three gens spread out evenly in the map ready to be completed. And if killer decides to camp again, he will definitely depip

I like to run surveillance discordance ruin and overcharged. You can switch overcharged for pop.

This took me a while and I'm actually kinda proud of it. And obviously I don't have any hate towards any of the streamers or community, in fact, I absolutely love the three streamers I referenced. I just love this game so much and would love to enjoy it with my best friend who's on PC, but I can't afford one for the time being and I'd love for them to introduce crossplay. It even looked like they were close to implementing it when they added the in-game friends list, but I feel like they decided to hold off when most of the community said it was a bad idea. There are definitely more pressing issues the developers need to be spending their time on, but I was just so disappointed when the community made me feel like I was the only one who actually wanted this. Either way, no hate, just disappointment. But more than anything, all I have is love for this game and the community. Also, my first meme!!!!!! Feel free to discuss anything you disagree with or some of the points I wasn't able to make on the small meme. :) &lt;3

No I meant the 0% achievement rate

right now im using bbq&amp;chili, Monitor and Abuse, Deerstalker, and Discordance. works for me for now but i always end up changing shit. i like this build so far though
---
More cosmetics if you are good, fewer cosmetics if you disobey/are bad, hence why Michael (who is the only killer who can outright disobey the entity through his Tombstone offering) only has the 1 cosmetic.
---
Must be broken cause I believe I have that one.
---
I had a rough one yesterday. It was temple of purgation and something like two of the four blighted hooks were in the downstairs of the temple. Had two survivors wiggle out while I was trying to get to them.  The other two were on hills with inconveniently placed ramps too.
---
So why would you use Monitor and Abuse on him? Doesn't that screw his power? Or am i wrong
---
The tier list is pretty much the same on console, but the controller, low sensitivity and bad frames make some killers more difficult. I’m on PS4 and I’ve been wrecked by good red rank Nurses and Huntresses, they’re just rare because it’s harder and most console players are more casual.
---
Quite strange, don't think I've ever seen a bug like that on steam before
---
Unkillable will have to be an only one use thing. Like DS. Other than that. It's perfectly balanced!
---
At that point I hook 3 and let one go. Give em a second chance
---
Literally just hit start for a game as killer and 15 seconds go by and I’m in a game.  Now survivors for me are a different story.
---
Flair checks out
---
Hope isn't *that* bad when its active. The problem is the fact that when it does activate it doesn't have that much of an impact. 
---
Adrenaline can single handidly win you a lost game by picking you off the ground, hope lets you loop the killer way better then you have any right to, if their 110% they want to kill themselves since you run at the same speed basically.
---
Im so confused. He said people dont use WiFi on PC and that would make Console better for dedicated servers. Then went on to say Ethernet isnt Wifi.

It's because Save the Best is practically mandatory for two-hit M1 Killers. It's insanely strong when it gets fully stacked and helps so much on so many Killers.

I’ve watched videos of dbd since the beta came out and the events always looked like so much fun and then it’s not on Switch, the only console I have to play it because I’m a broke gamer, and I’m really irritated.

Thanks for the feedback and kind words. Things I considered while making this concept was how powerful on demand instadowns and enhanced chase ability. Basically like tier 3 Myers without chasing, which is why I think harvesting Pustula Plants is necessary.

They cost the same amount, unless you mean item plus the two add-ons. And the Killer add-ons sometimes aren't impactful at all. Virtually all of Legion's, Leatherface's, and Pig's are awful to at best just good. Compare just good add-ons which is what some Killers at best have, to a Styptic, BNP, and a flashlight in the hands of a good Survivor

What I mean by that it’s kinda boring just playing kyf over and over

It would require a lot of balanvd changes and stuff

I wish buddy. The circle is divided so that you get about 1/6 in one game (if you are lucky) sometimes when I play a game it gives me about 97% of the xp bar and so I have to play another game to get 1/6 piece of the completion bar.

I mean Maybe.

PWYF (play with your food) is great if you want to fuck around and move way faster, but questionable if your goal is to win the game because finding, losing, finding, losing, and finding a survivor again takes time that could be used whacking other people. Speaking of whacking, also lose a stack whenever you make a melee attack on anyone, not just the obsession. Unfortunately for the purposes of PWYF, Shred counts as a melee attack, but doesn’t count as one for STBFL (Save The Best For Last). Go figure.

Fun perk. Moving almost half again faster than a survivor is hilarious. Not good perk.
---
Same. I could play it on xbox but the hate speech messages just don't cut it for me.
---
Basically this. "Hey I'm going to take a perk to make myself Broken for a minute instead of just letting someone unhook me."
---
I think in a coordinated SWF environment the perk is great but in pubs it's massively overrated. Nothing makes me groan more than getting half way to unhook someone just for that dumb cunt to unhook themselves and then go down 30 seconds later because they can't heal themselves.
---
Occasionally it can be amazing, which is why I don't think the perk needs any major buffs. (I'd really like it you could unhook yourself on second hook though ngl) But in terms of the "situationally amazing" perks it's one of the perks that can backfire more than any other one.

I'm going to be able to use Deliverance a lot more than Unbreakable but I'd much rather take Unbreakable than Deliverance.
