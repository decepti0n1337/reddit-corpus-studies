Lmao that killer was so bad,ggwp Dwight

---
She's a keeper!
---
Remove ruin‚Äôs hex effect, make it a token system. Each survivor must deal with X ruin skillchecks. Token are consumed upon great skill checks and good skill checks. Ruin‚Äôs effects end for that survivor when all tokens are consumed. Makes it consistent, but not too powerful. It‚Äôs really an early game stall. Maybe add a single token to every survivor‚Äôs pool upon hooking a survivor for the first time.
---
Ghostface.
---
Ok I'll start doing this . Delet this
---
Kind of unrelated but I‚Äôm worried this might also be toxic on my part, is downing a survivor and then running off to chase another nearby survivor considered poor form?
---
Lol, "Adrenaline is skill"
---
Have you seen this sub-reddit? Everyday there are Shitposts talking smack about survivors and "making killers scary again"
---

---
You have it backwards.
---
What I mean is that sometimes you have team mates that do nothing but still benefit from adrenaline. It's a good suggestion, it just feels too one sided imo.
---
Really? In my opinion Michael scared the living hell out of me when I first played against him. When I heard his theme song blasting in my ear I couldn‚Äôt even concentrate
---
Get Jeff
---
She should make them on Etsy I‚Äôm totally thinking about getting my own perk build for my wall
---
I would love to think of a whole bunch of attacks and encounters for the Killers and Survivors, this is really creative and I hope you get this done :)
---
Thank you!! I‚Äôm pretty proud of em :)
---
it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm runnin‚Äô Ace in the Hole irl
---
Try doctor at rank 1
---
We Hags love making you bump into walls with our traps &gt;:3
---
We will definitely work on that! Thank you :)  message me if you‚Äôre interested
---
And what do you suggest? I'm all ears.
---
Also please don't put words in my mouth I said it's not a surefire strat but it is better then going after the survivor who has 800 hours on DbD vs a survivor who just has 100.
---
Just because they‚Äôre rank 20 doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt have money
---
Bruh it‚Äôs the weeb memo to eat up being called a weeb
---
Try solo survivor at rank 1.
---
It's gonna take them more then bloddy 5 hours to fix him, but you already mastered your field of play I see. Good Job! He is bloddy brilliant!
---
He should just be on there four times
---
Hoodlums that can Y E E T over pallets and make really loud panting noises.
---
Also Amanda doesn't oink; she sneezes like a puppy when her snoot gets booped.
---
I have thought about doing this for her, but I‚Äôm also concerned about the legality of that. idk if it‚Äôs like protected content or something ya know what I mean?
---
Thats the point.
---
I full on thought this was gonna be a satire post as someone 3 years in the future complaining about the PTB for Chapter 21.
---
Depends on the mode sometimes I just quickly steam roll and sometimes farm
---
YoU 4gOt 2 tBaG bRo
---
Now this is what I was expecting coming into this thread lol
---
Once 60 fps on console has been achieved I think crossplay would be fine, and the advantage quicker queue times would outweigh any disadvantages. On DBD, Keyboard and mouse isn‚Äôt hugely better than controller compared to other games like FPSs (ignoring the huntress and the nurse, but even then the nurse is mostly bad on console because of the frames not controller), and on survivor it doesn‚Äôt really make a difference at all. I play on both and I‚Äôm a rank 5 killer on PC (using controller) and rank 3 on ps4. 
---
The ranking system would mean that it gets balanced out by most console players just being slightly lower than PC players, but even then I think rank 1 would still be possible on console. 
---
The only problem I think would be Bill, as valve might not want him appearing on consoles. But if he did, then it‚Äôs kinda like an advertisement to console players to get the PC version to play him.
---
80% Escape rate on Rank 1.....most played Killer is Nurse, this doesn't sounds like fun to me buddy! But sure the devs aren't responsible for the balance, sure.
---
"I do believe we're in a spot of bother"
---
Frank is my husband, Susie is overrated, Joey is okay and...who is Julie? So that starter pack is not for me dawg
---
Buffs aren‚Äôt exactly needed. He‚Äôs broken in the PTB due to programming errors he needs to be fixed simply enough.
---
Surprisingly there‚Äôs not a lot of killers that run NOED in my experience, but it‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm rank 15
---
Myers and just don't hit tier 3 EW for a real vanilla M1ing experience
---
Dont think they could add him since jason has his own game
---
Can I see the original version?
---
Lmao remember he had to get merged in the beginning
---
Feels like drunk post
---
Literally my favorite scene from Ash VS Evil Dead, but so true.
---
Stop it sis, you're making me cry.
---
Oh shit, they‚Äôre trying to effectively play the game
---
Oh shit I mained pk in for honor a bit too much
---
Bwahahahaha. Seriously? That‚Äôs where I encountered it the most üòÇ
---
Wow, what an original idea
---
Look I don't like to use that perk because I also feel like it can kinda be op.  It's one of those that is hard to fix in my opinion
---
Also kinda just looks like Huntress skinned A realistic version of Spyro the Dragon and wore it
---
my profile. the old version had the bear head on it. I also did some custom doctor cosmetics, like a white blood-stained Tuxedo and a Prison guard
---
Cats need sustenance! Rich buttery sustenance!
---
Okay well I‚Äôd prefer Randy so let‚Äôs agree to disagree
---
I think they should be basing their balance around red ranks. In any game that wants to be competitive the devs should be balancing around the best players. 
---
Coordinated survivors should be nerfed yeah, they can do the gens too quick, waste the killers time for too long and make plays that solo survivors could never set up.
---
Half play solo?
---
Better than ghostface
---
Cows was turning slowly into Ochido 2.0 so it's for the best that he got banned.
---
Imagine having money for skins
---
This comment was made by the poor gang
---
*have ffs
---
Spirits mori is worse than the pigs?
---
Nani sore?!
---
r/sad
---
I will and if I face a doc I will ez scape most of the time
---
I would LOVE my own perk build like this. Let us know if she‚Äôs gonna start making/selling them!
---
I had one do this last night, every time I would pick some up, there she was to flashlight save! I kept hearing foot steps behind me and went for her, well once the gens popped I was able to down her and then proceeded to face camp her and hit her with my knife until death, her friends all just sat and watched, not even trying to get her. It was so worth it!
---
I give him 3 days tops and he will be advocating shirtless Myers in every ~~shitpost~~ concept art post.
---
If you're matched against a full team of 'highly skilled' survivors, then evidently either matchmaking has failed, or your are a highly skilled killer yourself and can deal with it just fine.
---
But yeah, realizing there's an odd one out and IGNORING him is a very effective way of giving yourself an advantage. Double so if you make the odd one out **think he is being chased**, whilst you're actually just shoving him across the map along your patrol route looking for other survivors.
---
If there's one guy trying to get your attention, that's one guy less on a gen :D
---
I mean it's definitely good to experiment with different perks and combinations, but I say as long as you're being helpful to your team then use what suits you the best/you enjoy the most. You don't have to just use the most meta build just because it's the "best", hell it might not even be best for your playstyle
---
That's exactly right!  "Death is not an escape" is the warning you're given.  Every sacrifice, he takes *a little bit* of your soul, as well as feeding on his sadistic need to give you *hope* JUST to take it away.
---
It's how THE ENTITY operates.  If *someone* finds a deck of cards in The Fog, ya'll might pass the time earlier... might teach you a trick or two.
---
-A.V.
---
I cleaned out three differnt event bloodwebs last month.
---
I am too restless to camp a hooked survivor. Running off to hunt for more survivors is more enjoyable and yields more BPs. Plus, I love it when Hex: Devour Hope or Make Your Choice exposes altruistic survivors.
---
I‚Äôm a straight up clown main my build generally consists of
---
Perks
---
BBQ 
---
Nurses calling
---
Sloppy Butcher
---
Thanatophobia
---
Add-ons
---
VHS Porn
---
Thick Cork Topper
---
That build allows you to maintain a chase while reloading due to the increased movement speed while reloading and increased reload speed. 
---
Nurses,sloppy and thanatophobia all work in perfect synchronization to ridiculously slow down healing while you can see them healing 28m away. While it also slows down other progress by up to 16%
---
great job, you have talent
---
That's so good! I draw, too, but not as well as this.
---
Your missing the bigger picture, when you play on PS4 and camping is rampant and you need to Interact with the killer to pip and play the game as it was designed in order to feel like your actually doing something. I love when people like you say something like this, because you just don‚Äôt get it, if it was a face camp here and there okay, but when you play 10 games and 7 of them were camped by the killer it gets old and not fun to play and you don‚Äôt pip plus feel bad for the guy on the hook. Then the same thing happens day after day, on PC it‚Äôs a different world vs PS4 and most people don‚Äôt realize that.
---
Opened this subreddit, saw a massive upvoted post ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna miss old Freddy‚Äù.
---
I truly am gonna miss him. My body is ready for new Freddy though!
---
do you have fun while doing so? I'm concerned with that an EZ escape.
---
Or when my dumb ass equips A Nurse's Calling on the Plague.
---
I repeat. This is no big DbD secret. 
---
The only secret top secret DbD tech that remains at this point, is the ascended "uninstall game from Steam library" button. Still mastering it, myself
---
I play killer sometimes and think slugging is bullshit unless you see the last person immediately.
---
But sometimes you physically can't face a wall, in open maps like corn.
---
I agree with the second statement, some maps are just hell for killers against good surviver,
---
But otherwise I would say that the game has come a long way from the beginning
---
she definitely would! Shoot a message over to her, /u/kelseyboi
---
Doesn't really sound like an *issue* with legion, more that your friends are just pricks to me. They're DCing because they just want to say 'fuck you, you don't get blood points from us' despite the killer getting blood points not negatively impacting them at all.
---
That‚Äôs when you know they‚Äôre REALLY bad. I mean, dude, you have insta downs now and you‚Äôre STILL deciding to camp lmao
---
Could probably fit it if the &amp; symbol is viable for the name.  Not sure if it is or not though.
---
Ghostface is like the Russian version of Michael Myers. "Now survivor stalks you!"
---
NOED, destroying survivors since 1851!
---
and this whole research ruined by a black text on a black background
---
doctor mori is cool ;(
---
pigs mori is the worse of the game
---
cool tierlist ;)
---
Well if you‚Äôve played the game for a while, than you would know that the developers change the killer after the PTB is over. Not during the PTB.
---
could you just make it a table? 
---
Name - number
---
Another Name - number
---
and sort it from most to least seen
---
:D
---
I had to do a double take thinking Charlotte said Claudette. That bitch would be pumping out pallets.
---
if they are in a chase with you, the RBT timer stops so they can go through the gate, if not, their head will explode
---
I don't even need to go there, just see another trashy tier killer
---
I know they will, but they could try to make sure a super easy to identify bug doesn‚Äôt come out with the PTB.
---
i swear if this ain't me...
---
He's fun, he's not bad, he requires some skills, but in the end, you'll be left wondering one thing.
---
Why am I not playing Huntress instead?
---
Much better thanks!
---
Happened to me a couple games ago where I triggered endgame and the Claudette started to run but I got her, then proceeded to mori her
---
Honestly..
---
Killers cannot barely afford mistakes, while survivors are granted plenty of opportunity to mess around. Killer definitely stresses me out more.
---
I felt like I was playing Fuck, Marry, Kill game taking this survey.
---
For real, send me a message!
---
Send me a message so we can talk details! I would love to!
---
Shocked (Pun not intended) nobody DC'd. I'd replace Overwhelming Presence with Unnerving Presence for harder skill checks in your terror radius if you have it.
---
I feel attacked. Holy shit ;-;
---
People don't like the ez reward Its a bummer to run the killer 5 gens only to get hit with s single no ed and get sac'd on 1st hook because team cant find no ed totem
---
Cause they sure as hell not doing gems lol

Leatherface: why HELLO DER. *downs friend and hooks her. Proceeds to stand 2 feet away chainsaw primed and ready until she died*

I'm on it

Check the Legion skins again.
---
THIS IS LITERALLY ME AND MY FRIENDS THOOO
---
Lol. True
---
Ah yep now i see, 41 is billy. The colours confuse me since the key has a little shiny part that's different than the flat colour on the graph. :P
---
Definitely We‚Äôll Make It. A top tier perk for all ranks. 
---
Just be sure to ‚Äúteabag‚Äù right before an unhook so the survivor actually thinks to stay put for heals. Unless the killer is right there, it‚Äôs best to heal immediately. Nothing is more frustrating than terrified survivors spending 30 seconds running away. But run this perk with Empathy, and your team will love you for it.
---
Yes you could have said it better
---
I'm the exact opposite...hi, killer main here. I dont mind killer because it's all on me, when I play survivor (always solo que, my friends are lame and dont play this game) I'm much more aware of not wanting to mess up the game for everyone else in my group. As killer I can just mess up some MFers and have a good time or get run around a loop for 2 minutes and see all 5 gens pop simultaneously. Either way, it's on me and only me which makes it more relaxing without worrying about letting down the team.
---
distressing id maybe get with m&amp;a and claurophobia for bonkers terror so they dont hear you, but with nurses? thats just pure cookoo. nurses advantage is 24 terror and 28 nurses. stop smoking whatever quentin is smoking bruh :P
---
It would take me probably 5 years to create something of this level
---
Reason*
---
Did somebody say BDO??
---
This actually made me laugh because when I first got for honor I got into PK, than I learned about Centurion and dropped all the classes just to play him
---
anyone got an idea for ruin replacement as the totem spawns are obnoxious and thana got gutted and is piss poor now and dying light is playing russian roulette - u may get it early u may get obsession on a blendette in narnia so none of those are reliable.
---
r/dbdgonegay
---
Dude, that‚Äôs sick. Great job!!
---
fuck im colorblind
---
as a survivor main, I think slugging is a good and valid strategy where applicable, like if there's multiple survivors in one location, or it's late game and everything's chaotic, or there's only two people left, etc.
---
just when killers try to slug everyone when it's early game and everyone's still spread out, that's kinda toxic. at least it just gets annoying and boring real fast
---
3 to 5%???? every match I play is a 3 man or 4 man SWF.
---
I'm not dude.. nerd
---
&gt; at best 3 to 5% of all games are there 4 man SWF. I also hope you realize this would apply to killers as well.
---
So theres a 3 to 5 percentage chance that I'm going to have a terrible game where it's impossible to win? I'd also like to see where you got that statistic.
---
&gt; The dev's can't keep nerfing survivors, Something has to give. Plus no need to make this game any harder or hostile to newcomers.
---
They can and they should, they are still the more powerful class. Nerfing swf won't make the game more hostile to new players at all
---
The fact that we‚Äôll make it got chosen, thank you bro
---
The bar graph has been made :)
---
Old news
---
You can clearly see the most dominant/overpowered killers. Idk if overpowered is the right term but.
---
I made a more readable bar graph for everyone to look at instead
---
Sorry, I have a hard Time telling which color is what
---
Can confirm God tier console nurse ... eventually you just see past her limits and into the void, you see past anticipating their behavior you become one with their movements and then you become one with her.......
---
I would be glad to know that he lost the game and my team escaped.
---
Ya I am surprised by the lack of nurses though
---
Huntress ez
---
Trapper stronger than nurse? I don't think so
---
I would love for this to be a killer, especially as I'm a world war 1 and 2 finatic l, you should make a petition for this for give the idea to a game designer or developer, I hope this becomes a real thing
---
She should consider selling them on Etsy! Would buy!
---
I made a bar graph for everyone to look at that is more readable :)
---
This is not about what killers are strong bud, it‚Äôs about how many times he ran into them
---
You mopped the floor with them!
---
Are you on console or pc?
---
ye, but the colors are to similar for me.
---
At least the different greens
---
Posting a survivor-sided post on a survivor-sided sub
---
So brave
---
Then those killers are more popular, not overpowered
---
I have gone against some intense trappers but it is an oddity to what I expected at the start
---
Are you asking to have your inbox spammed
---
What ranks were these games in? Interested due to the diverse amounts of killers shown in here, I usually face leatherface and hillbilly solely
---
UGH. UAAAGH. \*GASM\* UAAAGH
---
Do whatever you want to do. The only thing frowned upon is face camping. At the end of the day you play the game how you want to play it and don't let anyone tell you different.
---
Pc also I was between rank 9 and 7 the entire time
---
I did for a few of them too, but I noticed that the color key is actually in order from most encounters to least.
---
Much easier to compare the differences now, also nurse isn't at the top? D:
---
Ugh, don‚Äôt be toxic....
---
/s
---
9-7
---
‚ù§
---
The nurse isn‚Äôt that great of a killer, she‚Äô has a ridiculously hard learning curve. Not everyone can use her that‚Äôs why the trapper is higher up due to his easy to use ability and play style
---
Well, some trappers are very good honestly, but good nurses are unstoppable.
---
Nurse currently least enjoyable to play as. I'd guess it's because you're almost forced to play her at higher ranks if you want to consistently pip.
---
Bugs that are seemingly "super easy to identify" may not be so easy in a small QA environment.
---
Word up, fo shizzle, right on, PREACH
---
The way this one worked the names in the key went from highest to lowest if that helps
---
The first time I played against him I never even saw him until the end. I didnt hear a lullaby or anything and right at the end I got put to sleep (I didnt even notice at the time) and he got one slap in which scared the crap outta me. Although my first Myers got a good scream outta me
---
....... hahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha I‚Äôve been having a crappy weekend man and you seriously made me laugh. Thanks for that. Oh my man that‚Äôs a good one.
---
On console (Rank 6-8), generally I run into hillbilly‚Äôs and trappers. The occasional nurse and spirit
---
Ah, ye makes Sense
---
Thanks but its the truth
---
Not that hard tho, for me huntress is harder than nurse
---
It's important to note which killers are free aswell because I know alit of people refuse to buy killers
---
I agree with that completely I‚Äôd much rather see a nurse or a spirit than a huntress. They are almost impossible to loop if they are accurate
---
I know that surprised me too. Aswell as the high huntress and trapper counts
---
Even better pun
---
*sorts by controversial*
---
I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so controversial that I‚Äôve never seen anyone else do it, and that I hope killers don‚Äôt start preparing for it
---
Free and kinda overpowered, like the hillbilly hands down is the number 1 killer if not number 1 he‚Äôs a 1b. Ever so close behind
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Colors a bit hard to differentiate. The names being in order from highest to lowest is very helpful thank you.
---
I never saw noed, until i started playing killer and used noed myself. Karma sucks
---
I always tought that should be a skin for The wraith.
---
I‚Äôve never seen anyone else do it in game. I guess it‚Äôs not as secret as I thought. Apparently that‚Äôs pretty controversial for some reason though
---
It maybe the way that the get their killer mains by giving them the best for free
---
I‚Äôm a rank 20 killer because my parents are divorced 75/25 and the game is at the 25 so can confirm
---
Your welcome hopefully people get something from this experiment
---
I don‚Äôt ever watch streamers, which explains why I never see it
---
wait which hair
---
Idk why people are downvoting this he wasnt testing out the new perks. If he was testing out the new ghost face perks i could understand but he wasnt
---
As long as Ghostface isn‚Äôt released being worse than current Freddy I will forgive them. (They most likely will)
---
It‚Äôs very possible, but I‚Äôve noticed that the paid killers generally are the ones that camp or tunnel. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs just my personal experience
---
Thicc asf
---
If you still want practice, I'll be on Monday so you can do KYF practice. Always happy to help new killers
---
yeah same survivors complaining then are the same ones bitching now.
---
So that's what Legion Mains look like ü§î
---
I feel this person would always be a lower-tier than Huntress though
---
Legion or billy
---
You miss getting easy games and now that its actually challenging for you, you wanna call them try hards? lol.
---
I'm still not really understanding what you are saying 10K bp for though. I agree 10k isn't anything brag worthy, but I don't get what that has to do with DCing to spite a legion?
---
she would love to, but doesn‚Äôt have any of that set up at the moment. If you wanted something like this, she told me she would be happy to do more, shoot her a message!
---
I use hope instead of darksense
---
I have seen that aswell at least more often than free killers
---
but failing to protect gen rewarding killers +  with endgame collapse. meanwhile, you get a free health state by completing all gens
---
I wish I could go against that many Billies.
---
Message me if you‚Äôre interested :) I‚Äôd love to help you do that!
---
I want to eat Jane's ass
---
np mate. now excuse me while i run as far as i can away from u after u unhook me
---
LOL hell no.

hmmmmmm

This entire post and comment section is already controversial.
---
*Have fun*
---
Yeahhhh, shoot me a message! We can discuss details!
---
Pig will be at the top when the cosmetics drop lmao
---
Ever had a game with all ace mains? It's fucking fun as hell
---
It's to be expected when one breaks the circlejerk.
---
Iz Preeeettttyyyyy!
---
-J. Chase
---
Many of those games ended in death
---
Put spirit a bit lower and move nurse up a tier
---
Fuck the people
---
I hope so pig is so underrated
---
Tryhard barely even registers as an insult anymore. And I can relate with that sentiment, the current ranking system takes new players like him (or me, a month ago) and throws them in the deep end way too quickly. The first baby steps you take as a killer or survivor are fun and chill, everyone's learning the game, everyone's kind of fumbling around.
---
Then you play a dozen matches and suddenly you're facing purple flashlights with addons every game. At that point in your growth as a player you probably don't even have a full four useful perks, you might be running some garbage like Thrill of the Hunt just because you have nothing better.
---
It becomes more manageable and fun over time but man is the learning curve brutal. And the community toxic.
---
The ones that want balance? Yea they'll birch about unbalanced game mechanics
---
If I hear chainsaw I tell my friends it's nurse and the other way around for nurse blinks
---
The streets will never forget
---
Getting back-revved just means you fucked up or didn't play safe enough.
---
I mean no disrespect when i say this my friend but i feel these posts generally have the same questions asked with the same answers everytime and the comparison of old dstrike and noed still dont match up dstrike had no counter play and noed while extremely difficult does have the counter play
---
I hate how she has pink nails and the blood coers only a little bit but not all so you just see pink with a little bit of red which makes me want to bash my head in.
---
Hmm, that makes sense, I guess I gotta prioritize hooks then. Thanks for explaining!
---
I personally love the way thw bloody pig head looks ^^
---
You want to get better at looping, go play Leatherface. He‚Äôs a great killer to learn on. His huge tall figure makes him easy to see over loops, his terror radius alerts survivors of your presence super early. In short, survivors can see you coming a mile away and set you up for optimal looping circuits.
---
Exit gates or hatch?
---
A bobby trap killer. he can tamper with chest, totems, gens, doors and windows.He can make tamper with gens to make them slower to repair for  a fix time(void if its being repair with a toolbox). Tamper with windows(vaults) to make you ‚Äútrip‚Äù and only be able to slow vault that vault. Tamper with chest so whatever you get is at 50% used. Tamper with totems to reveal the aura of the survivor to the killer while the surv works on the totem(doesnt reveal location if its a hex). Tamper with doors to make them a bit longer to open. He can have like 20 charges during the entire match. He cant kick gens but he can work on them. He works on them same way as a surv but instead or repairing it, he regresses it. Every like 15 seconds on a gen he gains 1 charge. He can look like a very creepy mecanic. His name will be jim and his map with be a hardware store.
---
Yea that‚Äôs exactly where I am at with clown. People say he can shut down loops real easy, but huntress just hits them. You don‚Äôt have to be as accurate with the bottles but you still do have to be accurate.
---
He‚Äôs just a boring, scuffed version of huntress imho. One of my least played killers.
---
Is there really an audience for streams of unpleasant people griefing team mates?
---
[removed]
---
OOF poor nea.
---
I definitely think about load out and mood before playing, as well as check ping. (I play survivor, no I‚Äôm not toxic, I‚Äôm terrible and I know it, I just play with friends to have fun). Glad to see I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks through things like this before playing DBD. 
---
Side not I have a friend who will ask my cousin (who we both play with) if he wants to hate his life. It‚Äôs his way of asking if he wants to play some SWF on DBD. In the end we all regret it and say that‚Äôs the ‚Äúlast time‚Äù we‚Äôre playing the game. It‚Äôs funny how despite everyone getting frustrated with the game, we all go back to it.
---
This is the superior infographic. Very easy to read.

This made me laugh. Oooo here comes Mr Bing Bong watch out!
---
I can't go to the other ones mostly contain "just cleanse totems 4head" and I was hoping that if I made my own post I could get some actual responses, clearly I thought too highly of this cesspool known as the "dead by daylight subreddit"
---
My guy. Why cant you cleanse totems? Why cant you just leave and not stick around? My guy NOED isnt even that strong.
---
From the small icons I think OP is playing on 1440p. I play on 1440p and the icons get smaller. On a side note, I wish they‚Äôd fix that.
---
Agreed. As survivor, I'm much more relaxed and calm. When I start the game as killer, I can actually feel my heartbeat getting faster and more intense due to stress. In a horror game, this should *definitely* be the other way around. The devs need to do some major work on this.
---
lmaoo
---
This is honest great post
---
The one where your altruistic actions are faster after the gates are opened?
---
Are you sure The Doctor isn't playing a trick on you?
---
That was beautiful to watch. Knowing it was a legion the kid was probably screeching and broke his controller after you escaped.
---
Personally i think its boring going against a freddy. You get put to sleep he chases either you or another survivor if its you he knows wherever you are with his aura reading abilities. If he chases another survivor he can come back in 30 seconds and put you back to sleep then you‚Äôve got to either run around the map looking for a survivor to wake you up or just fail a generator skill check then repeat throughout the match
---
Girls in high school that have taki‚Äôs for breakfast
---
A bundle? Including the game and all dlc in one price? I don't see it in the Xbox store...
---
These are based on his personal sample
---
So this is what a guy without friends talks like ü§î
---
Same thing with league.
---
In league of legends I go to each tower and ignore the other player, make a build specifically for killing towers faster. Then when Im 3-4 levels above them from just having better economy I can just steamroll them.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Then they whine how it doesn't count, while I try and explain how the game actually works.
---
Well sonofabitch. If I get there and it's the doctor I'll be pissed.
---
Poor poor Thicc Finger Licking Lad. Good thing Ghostface will come out and take the spot as least played killer.
---
Well, Im on PC. I saw a bundle on Steam a few days ago, but it‚Äôs gone now. Probably something to do release of GF.
---
I torn between hating The Spirit or The Hag more because I get The Spirit  in so many of my games as survivor but I hate The Hag because her traps are annoying and she guards her Totems most of the game.
---
Before endgame I would do 1v1s and it would usually come down to how the map spawned.
---
If the map spawned gens too close together the game would go on for literal hours but if they would spawn further apart then I could win easily as survivor. 
---
It wasnt particularly interesting before endgame collapse.
---
They should implement a proper 1v1 mode though. Along with a 2v8 mode because that would be awesome.
---
Dude this is not me at all lol. It‚Äôs the other way around for me, killer is chill for me while I once broke a monitor over the terrible survivor hit boxes.
---
Exit gates both times
---
Just cleanse all totems 4HEAD
---
Why are the frog devs incapable to making new killers cool.
---
ya i thought about that too... or ‚Äún‚Äù
---
Riparoni
---
I can only bring myself to play killer after a few frustrating survivor matches. I‚Äôm not bad or anything if anything I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm pretty decent but killer just feels like there‚Äôs so much pressure compared to survivor
---
I always do a survivor warm-up round before I play killer for the first time each day. It's the only way I handle the stress.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what the message this meme is trying to convey, genius.
---
Well done !
---
The community is toxic and the game is a mess in terms of balancing. So you haven‚Äôt missed out on anything.
---
I'm honestly wondering what works in 1851 had the word NOED.
---
I can only imagine it was either some lower class person that didnt know how to spell "knew" or a name.
---
Let's break this down: "Why can't you cleanse totems?" I can cleanse 2-3 totems on my own, I'm not gonna spend 4 minutes finding the last 2, it's wasting time, and I'm not in a SWF so I can't even tell if my team is doing any totems with me. 2: "Why can't you just leave and not stick around?" I'm not a toxic survivor, when I see an exit gate I open it, when I see an open gate, I leave (Unless I got hooked teammates that can be saved safely)
---
This was the amount of times I ran into each killer in my past 360 games on PC between rank 9-7. My intention was to show how often I saw each killer during the 2.7 patch
---
NOED is a perk bad killers use and is only effective against bad survivors. Good killers don't run it because how little difference it makes in their games, and good survivors don't die to it because they know how to cleanse totems, hit skill checks, loop the killer, basically things a turd flinging chimp can do.
---
That‚Äôs very flattering :) thank you!
---
If it makes any difference I only saw him 3 times over my last 60 games
---
People don't realize they can take advantage of a weak link lol.
---
I am so sorry :(
---
The problem is its out of BHVR's hands if they get banned.
---
PrEtTy GoOd JoB sO fAr
---
I hope they power up ghost face I really want him to be a popular killer
---
Get the game, become immersed, swear yourself to the entity. 
---
I got it this April, it is now my most played game on PC. The community can be toxic, but there are plenty of nice people on here. As for games, it‚Äôs pretty alive on PC and  recently DBD reached an all time high player count. It recently dwindled down, but it‚Äôs far from dying.
---
Thank you ;-;
---
Fun fact: That loud ass static noise is actually heard from 24 full meters away, just 8 shy of your full terror radius. Thanks BHVR for yet another well designed killer
---
See i do though. I am that guy running small game looking for totems and i never run into noed unless i was lazy and didnt cleanse the totems.
---
I'd recognise that MCM wall anywhere
---
Any chance I could get some feedback on this?
---
She should do killer perks!
---
666 upvotes.
---
Instablind.
---
It was a lore joke
---
Getting shit on isn‚Äôt fun either.
---
To be fair neither is getting your ass handed to you by others using meta perks
---
It warms my heart to see BMing trolls get what they deserve.
---
Okay, now we NEED a Yandere/Gasai Yuno cosmetic to Susie.
---
No, I don't main Legion...
---
What? Soulless teanagers need love too
---
Have you played as killer without meta perks? Do you know what happens? the majority of people wants to win. Besides, this does not only happen with killers, with survivors too. Most players start unlocking the best meta perks, they get used to them and to make different perk combos it takes a lot of grinding. Personally, I have my moments where I just want to win and others where I just want to have fun, that's when I change perks, mostly only because I have them all... I have 2,5k hours in the game, but casual players can't afford "variety" most times
---
Like survivors don't do the same...
---
Then get better!!! Don't use the same fuckin meta perks as everyone else and thinking it'll make you do better!
---
You don't fuckin need ruin to combat 'genrush' you need to learn how the fuck to pressure survivors off of generators
---
You don't use bbq "for the points" don't you dare fucking lie- thats just the cherry on top for the x ray locating of fucking survivors.
---
We don't like being shit on by stuff like this either
---
I‚Äôll put away my meta perks when survivors put away theirs.
---
Because killers have a handful of perks that help past rank 8.
---
This is awesome, post has more upvotes than people who like his power!
---
Why don‚Äôt you get better at dealing with the perks?
---
Damn your mom's a savage XD
---
If Ruin isnt used the game ends too fast in the survivors favour. Killers need to stretch games out to win. 
---
Without "tunneling" we need to get 8 hooks with a chase lasting at least 40seconds including finding someone and up to 90 seconds if they dont screw up, if they dont have decisive strike, if they dont have mettle, if theirs no other survivor that snuck up with a flashlight.
---
No Ruin means the gen at base is completed in 80 seconds. Less with Toolboxes.
---
BBQ and chilli is more used for bp gains, the tracking is nice but 100% BP is amazing.
---
Claudette's crouched in a bush wondering why the killer is hanging around nearby, Meg is watching you loop the killer in complete awe like some anime sidekick, and Dwight's looking for Ruin.
---
You‚Äôre really salty. 
---
and you‚Äôve also never played high rank killer games. 
---
And yes, most killers who aren‚Äôt Billy/Nurse do not benefit from the aura of BBQ against GOOD players. If BBQ hurts you then you‚Äôre not good.
---
You dare insult the son of a Shepard!?
---
Really wish they just called him ‚ÄúThe Ghost‚Äù or something. Seeing two words in a killer‚Äôs name just feels off.
---
I‚Äôm in this picture and I don‚Äôt like it.
---
Be wary of longfinger, in short, try rear
---
Perfect summary.
---
As a Hag Main this made me laugh
---
To be fair I think that‚Äôs the point of the maps sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you get unlucky
---
"stealth killer"
---
No u &gt;&lt;
---
Nope.
---
Ok.
---
It‚Äôs MoM, an exhaustion perk, adrenaline on everyone. But for some reason killers bringing their own strong perks is being predictable
---
Bad strats friend. Ruin stays.
---
Play with mouse and keyboard? I don't play on console, so that's the only thing I can say
---
Decisive isn't a factor unless you tunnel the person right off the hook
---
I still read that in Stamper's voice without even thinking about it.
---
what is wells?
---
My guess:  **ENTITY DISPLEASED**
---
Uh huh
---
i remember like 2 or 3 days after getting this game i got a flashlight save off a already transporting freddy while awake and i was laughing my ass off like a fat kid that just broke into a candy store after hours...
---
can't you back it up
---
No I do not believe so, but I have not checked
---
I main both Survivor and Killer, and um... I'm the second one for both sides üòÇ
---
That's like saying Ruin isnt a factor unless you ignore totems
---
No, Because if someone else ALSO had BT, you can get unhooked safely, and if you rescue someone with BT and the killer is a tunneller, you basically use them as bait, but in a safe way.
---
ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE.
---
played duo SWF with my girlfriend the other night and I took the killer for a loop while she cleansed the 5 totems. I was SO irritated with the other teammates. 5 minutes into the match, and not a single generator pipped. I think at one pointed I shouted IT HAS BEEN OVER 180 SECONDS WHAT THE HELL IS URBAN EVADING NEA DOING?? obviously not gens.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ yesss
---
I love how so many of BHVR unfun mechanics can just be summed up go ‚Äúwe are incapable of programming in a way that would be fun‚Äù
---
this reminded me of Bela Kiss
---
keep playing, use shadowborn. Remove Noed (If you are using it) 
---
Don‚Äôt use add-ons, like ever.
---
Try the no ruin challenge for a few days, rely on pure skill. 
---
Delete all unnecessary things that take up storage from your xbox, such as - messages, videos, photos, games you don‚Äôt play etc. This might improve your FPS in-game.
---
Last but not least, realize that you just can‚Äôt turn quick enough to hit survivors behind you after a blink, so always aim behind them and predict their movements. If they double-back a lot then react accordingly.
---
On the Clown map with the hospital in the middle there is a spot when the basement is inside on the top of the stairs where the trap is invisible

BILL!
---
@ me next time.
---
where is the TBAG?
---
right like who gave the OP permission to post me? DID NOT CONSENT 0/10
---
if you aren‚Äôt having fun playing a killer or just suck play billy lmao
---
He may not be as unique but he services the role as a killer and he does it damn well
---
ULTIMATE GAMER GIRLFRIEND
---
Sorry but that‚Äôs a solid OVERCHARGE
---
Imo much more difficult on console than DS as DS is slightly larger
---
Last time I played console was pre nerf ds but u right
---
Can I be a hipster and brag about following this sub before this post? That would make me feel special if y'all wouldn't mind.
---
Honestly my mentality is just get all the perks on the web, or focus the highest level perk. They cant appear once youve got all 3 levels. I know its shitty but its better than getting the same couple perks over and over forever.
---
yes especially if getting tunneled triggers you like nothing else. and it happens a LOT
---
She‚Äôs definitely not ‚Äúuseless‚Äù. 
---
She just gets a lot better with corrupt purge.
---
Playing Survivor is like going through one of those Jungle Gyms as a kid.
---
Playing Killer is like going through a Jungle Gym as a parent, searching for their kids who just keep running away because they don't wanna go home.
---
Sure man
---
Hate, hat... close enough. After all, people hat fedoras
---
No
---
I mean you're basically going no mither if you don't cleanse, and if said survivor is bad at looping or gets some wonky lag as they're dropping a pallet or whatever, they're fucked because the killer only needs to get lucky once.
---
As a killer main, NOED has saved my ass a couple times, but with an aggressive play-style it‚Äôs a useless perk (basically running 3 perks). So yeah, I agree that most trash killers use it. However, I think the argument is that survivors have had so many more crutch perks over the lifespan of the game (DS, Borrowed Time MoM, etc*) that NOED makes up for all the times those crutch perks have saved the survivors life. That‚Äôs just my opinion though.
---
Where it says you have to play the new killer to enter the PTB?
---
and why someone would want to play a killer with no power?
---
Thank you.
---
Idk about your experience but I constantly have people with DS practically throw themselves at me to try to use it. I just stopped picking them back up. Slug it out man.
---
Darn.
---
¬øPor que usted hablar espa√±ol en inglesa comunidad?

Report image - Reason: I'm in it and I don't like it
---
I deliberately stop myself from going above rank 10 purely for the fact I can run pretty much any perk loadout I want and still get fun games. I have an extreme dislike of ruin purely because it's pretty much necessary to have it for games to last more than 5 minutes in the higher ranks.
---
this guy would look so badass, also aiming in this game is pure shit so idk about the gun shooting
---
They did mention that they are working on the ranking system and said a few things they'd do for survivor pips specifically. That said, I don't think there will be a way to change the ranking system when it comes to being downed early, tunnelled, etc.
---
That's a baby killer for sure.
---
santa doing the righteous work
---
Because there's like 6 usable perks in this game and the rest are so terrible that you'll get shit on if you don't use them. Not using meta perks won't stop survivors from using them, so you can guarantee it'll be a one way trip to stomptown.
---
Imagine thinking you‚Äôre losing games to bbq and chilli
---
It was so obvious lol, thanks :)
---
But look at this way, they don't cleanse, they basically have a free NOED that lasts all game.
---
No need to get that shit started. He doesn‚Äôt need to get better by basically cheating.
---
If you can see the red stain you'd better throw it. If you are ever doubtful you can make it safely, dead hard to a window or pallet to give yourself some extra distance. If you know the killer is running spirit fury throw the pallet early and avoid a pallet stun.
---
Brave words from a soon-to-be pussy ass bitch
---
I play this game purely for fun so never really run meta builds. Ruin is by far my least favourite perk in the game.
---
Thanatophobia, surveillance, ruin and overcharge works good with her. Survivors dont want to heal? Thana. Want to do them generators instead? Surveillance and overcharge will help that.
---
NOED would have been a more apt perk, and sure either work through it or do totems.
---
You should used your "Morto Stecchito"
---
Well gta shows them boobies so why not
---
Dude it wasn't my offering, there was another username but i blurred it out
---
I saw one guy practicing moon walking
---
If the Legion waited out the DH and didn't get unhook juked, this play wouldn't have happened.
---
I remember when this game first came to console the doctor was DISPISED. I would cause DC's left and right. Idk if he's still hated as much as I haven't played in awhile. When 60 fps comes to console j might give it a shot.
---
Pog!
---
*bruh*
---
happened to me too lol
---
Mouse and keyboard offers unfair advantage over other players on console. There is a reason that people don‚Äôt want this game to be cross-platform. 
---
And congrats, you play dark souls with a controller on a PC. Doesn‚Äôt matter because you are on a PC doing it.
---
Can we please stop giving advice when we don't know what we're talking about
---
I‚Äôd low key buy killer perk icons. I‚Äôd go with NOED, Hex Ruin, Surveillance, and BBQ and Chili.
---
Idk if it's being stupid if the killer is camping the hook, you don't have much room to do anything. If you get farmed then it's not really your fault.
---
I think moris should only work on death hook.
---
Hahaha this is so true! I burned out so I took a break from the game... just started up again recently and I had deranked completely. In one of the games I was looping the killer to the point I actually felt bad for him, until my dumb ass got stuck on a random piece of wood/branch. Killer hooks me and leaves (which surprised me tbh cause 8/10 would have just facecamped me at that point.) Anyway im on the hook, I see 1 aura doing a gen, thats it. I go into struggle phase and all of a sudden I see 2 aura‚Äôs come out of lockers. One started running circles and the other beelined for me. I get unhooked, first thing I notice were 3 crows circling my savior. I run towards the first place with a pallet for a safe heal, only to see the other survivor also running 3 crows üòÇüòÇ  She had evolved though, instead of circles she was now running an 8pattern like a bee. I couldnt stop laughing, ofcourse I was so distracted I didnt see the killer sneak up on me so my ass got handed of to the entity. My thoughts were with the visible aura doing gens. I hope they were also back from a break cause if not they are gonna be stuck with those kind of survivors forever...
---
Also it was kind ironic that the quickest way to get rid of the crows was to get in a locker üòÇ
---
I think that for 1v1 killer should close hatch you two meet at hatch and if you can loop for the entire duration and die by endgame you win (or open exit)
---
claudette is what people wanting to win badly use. Shes well... black thus letting hide so well. Sometimes she runs into a dark place and disappears
---
and im not even kidding
---
Urbban Evasion, you don't want to be an inmersed survivor
---
Upvoted for the effort made making the reflection in the eyes from the game
---
Yeah. everyone said the same thing about Legion's changes. How many of those nerfs made into the game for him? ALL OF THEM. The difference with Ghostface is he's not even going to have a chance to be a good killer.
---
He asked for an advice, I give it to him, what I said is not bannable, overcome it man
---
Definitely. I was recently learning to balance out generator repairs and chasing (because whenever I take too long to chase someone, they gen rush) and it's stressful
---
Bing bong, your opinion is wrong
---
Window repairman billy cosmetic when?
---
Ez game tbh.
---
But it isn‚Äôt tho
---
Min best girl 10/10
---
enduring, spirit fury, monitor, bbq is a pretty all around good build except on nurse really lol.
---
Thankyou :)
---
Happy cake day lad
---
Yes!
---
Is this like a personal attack or something?
---
Thanks :D
---
Yw :D
---
Play a few detox games! My favorite is "Git off my property" trapper. Just pick a building and put all your traps there, then you don't let anyone go in your house. Bonus points if you talk in a comedic cartoonish southern accent saying things like "Gone git! and stay git!". 
---
Really helps loosen up and the rank decay will help you get less sweaty games ideally! 
---
Bubba's basement chest is also a good one. Just insidious in the basement for the whole match until someone gets greedy and goes for the chest.
---
I never said it was original. I said it has a name but I didn‚Äôt actually say it because I don‚Äôt know how to spell it. Boyo-tech or something? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been told to call it. I never claimed it was our idea, just that I don‚Äôt see it in my own games ever, and it‚Äôs one of my favorite things to successfully pull off, so I hope killer‚Äôs don‚Äôt start preparing for it.
---
I didn't stutter.
---
Sure you do. As you get gen rushed before your first hook.
---
Please provide proof.
---
Hey do you mind if I lol real quick?
---
I mean... You can add me if u want
---
The heck is that picture?
---
Why "fix gen rush" when it's not even broken?
---
Idk exactly how to prove
---
Yeah
---
Maybe if they didn't make killers such a joke, the game would be more balanced.
---
You gave him the easy answer. Shitty for other players as well. It‚Äôs not good advice.
---
No. Im gonna use the wells.
---
If you have Reddit on your phone, take a picture of your PS4 username. And then private message it to me.
---
I think dying light attracts way worse players. I've not run into a single player who didn't camp their obsession after they found them.
---
Thanks for your opinion, but is not your decision
---
I won't let me send the pic.. how do I do it
---
What do those two maps have to do with curtains anyway?
---
Literally just happened to me. Rank 10. Looped the LF for a solid 3-4 minutes. No gens done, he didn't have ruin....I mean what are they doing???
---
Oh. Oops that's not how it works.  I forgot. I guess you have to post it on the subreddit.
---
I believe this is because as survivor, you can count on others, while as a killer, you need to do everything yourself, leading to you questioning yourself all the time because you can‚Äôt rely on anyone else to help you.
---
Lol are u on ps4
---
Yeah.
---
LOL
---
How can you compare turning brightness up and game bugs?
---
What the hell is wrong with you?
---
Finally you understood, thank God
---
yeah it really is smart ass
---
I try to cleanse at the furthest fountain possible forcing The Plague to waste time walking across to collect it.
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt use the wells yeah you‚Äôll be injured all game but she has to catch me ü§£
---
yeah, better player.
---
Alright, so let's just agree to disagree. I still don't believe gen rushing is even an issue at all.
---
Overcharge, if survivors are good enough, is a bad perk lol. At lower ranks it's unbalanced
---
Nothing wrong with a little artistic license! Awesome work!
---
The Clown can end loops super easily if you know how to play him. Leatherface not as much.
---
Plague depends on the survivors
---
I primarily like playing survivor but have been playing a lot of killer lately due to the killers you described. They just make the game so unfun.
---
So I have been running limiter Billy with no ruin at rank 10ish. My main goal is to hook everyone twice, bare minimum once for bbq stacks. I try to make sure not to actually kill anyone unless the survivors force me to by not leaving the game (rarely happens but they want me to get kills since I am being nice). The extended chases (only chainsaw even injured survivors unless gens are popping too fast) plus no sacrifices allows me to safety or depip, which keeps the matches relaxed for me.
---
I walk away with 50k blood points every game and everyone had a good time.
---
I can see that now, but some people responded super harshly compared to what I said. Props to you for not telling me to uninstall right away
---
You‚Äôre right I agree I‚Äôm just saying what I think is worse, I would prefer roll the game through that than get vomited on from a distance she has to m1 me rather than a distance shot. Idk
---
LOOOOOOOL
---
Frank's is literally fucking useless now
---
I‚Äôll take the slow everything over getting downed at a distance lol
---
:‚Äô(
---
true, but have you ever hit an unnerving overcharge? now that's BETTER than sex.
---
My aim is shit with the clown unfortunately and the plagues power literally relies on the survivors, which sucks.
---
*grabs popcorn*
---
Nah but deadass tho
---
What do you even suggest to do that? Gens already take a long time
---
Nice name :)
---
&lt;3 were u actually able to see it lol
---
That good and all I‚Äôm just stating a playstyle that has actually worked when people don‚Äôt hit the wells. My post was a little aggressive in manner (my bad) but I‚Äôve done it was a group off coms and it went well multiple times :)
---
The honor code is made up and the rules don't matter. Run whatever you like and whatever build you like.
---
KOBE shouldn't let players use DS, just like it doesn't give you devour hope stacks.
---
Running at the killer is the shittiest thing you could do because it completely fucks over the rest of your team. Go immersed, do gens when someone else is being chased.
---
If you really don't want to get Dying Lighted stop running obsession perks.
---
Yep.
---
Ruin, BBQ, Thanta, Franklins, agitation, pop goes the weasel, STBFL, and I suppose...enduring evem with the nerf.
---
Unless you're great at looping, try staying low when you hear the TR.  
---
Dying Light just promotes unfun gameplay.
---
Bt is fine the way it is. With the way mending works now, bt is in a fantastic place. Trading places is the risk you willingly take when you use bt. So, if you trade, you need to expect it. Especially if they are camping.
---
You must have good quality, cuz even in my gallery I can't see it lol
---
Overwhelming Presence to stop genrushing
---
Territorial Imperative to stop basement looting
---
Lightborn to stop flashlight blinds 
---
Stridor to stop escapes
---
Monstrous shrine is also essential for basement builds
---
Smaller screen on phone makes the quality higher.
---
does anybody here even play killer? I can't be the only one who 'thinks this.
---
Oh nice
---
Ooooooooooooof.
---
Someone else was running Decisive and I was made the obsession for whatever goddamn reason.
---
Then it's your fault, not that "killer who can truly be looped into eternity".  
---
If you want a killer to learn the game with, go with Wraith. If you want a killer to win with, use a non-M1 killer.
---
I suppose rank 15s need to win every now and again.
---
Play him for a bit and you'll figure it out. It's not that bad
---
There's already enough toxicity in this community. No need to lop on more. Keep playing and having fun, brother.
---
A fun chase against a good killer/survivor.
---
Survivor is a fun time killer like Mario Party if you just want to screw around. Killer is stressful as shit.
---
It will always feel cheap to me. You can say that Adrenaline is the survivor version of it, but against each other NOED wins. And when it pops your usually on your last hook because the game is about over so you just die right before the end because of 1 perk.
---
I make lockers my friend when im dl. Sounds shitty, but wait until another person gets hit before you try a gen. The game relies on YOUR survival at that point. Make it about yourself.
---
I'm a lone wolf as survivor, especially when I'm playing solo. So I'm doing my own thing and keeping my own butt safe outside of the occasions that I feel the need to be altruistic or see an opportunity to join a teammate on an objective. Other survivors are able to help me fix a mistake I may make, and help me finish the objective faster.
---
As killer, I'm still admittedly stuck in the "I have to 4k every single game or I've failed" mentality (something I know I need to break). But outside of that, I know that every second I'm not aggro-ing survivors, there's at least three (save for the one I might be chasing) survivors doing God knows what else out there and probably pounding out gens. There's no one else to help me, no one else to help rectify a mistake.

If I get genrushed as a killer, there's pretty much nothing I can do about that except hope I can get them before they run out the door. It's very stressful for me, especially when survivors are being cocky little shits and teabagging, jumping repeatedly over stuff to alert me, and pointing at me (might be petty, but meh). Like if I'm doing that bad in a game, I know it, there's literally no need to rub it in my face. I can't enjoy chases either because I feel like I need to end them as fast as physically possible to go bother other survivors, rather than being able to look at them as an opportunity to see if I can outsmart another human being. 
---
In short, I'm always worried as a killer and always stressed, always going, going, going. Gotta rush, gotta hurry, gotta go, go, go. As survivor, I know the other three survivors have a good chance at aggro-ing the killer on their own, so as long as the killer is distracted with them I can pop gens in peace. This really needs fixing.
---
I never sweat killer I normally have an agenda and try to meet it. Whether my build had some goal or I want to accomplish something specific as a killer. When I play survivor it‚Äôs more like, whelp my team dc‚Äôd or, nothing to see here sweaty nurse player, etc.
---
Like one full of mind games and the winner is whoever outsmarts the other?
---
I play for fun, I just get one hook per game with plenty of teabags if I don't use meta and deranking to yellow doesn't change that. I miss EW1 gen grabs, survivors saying they were spooked and traps that weren't disarmed. :&lt;
---
Gens absolutely can go fast but the majority of the time it's fine if the killer applies pressure. The moment someone is hooked gen progression slows massivly
---
Also it's more this is a "quick fix" for you. It isn't, gens already take a long time and are boring to complete but survivors have  nothing else to do.
---
Usually a long chase where mind-games are involved.
---
IS THAT IN IFUNNYCO WATERMARK I SEE!?
---
Oof√ó1000
---
I wish the lantern lit up ingame.
---
Which would be stupid in this case, the PTB is used to test the character and how he works, but right now it's unusable, so we have a PTB to test nothing.
---
Those are pretty fun
---
I'm the Feng waiting to flash light save but do it too early and fuck up.
---
I try to stay between rank 10-20. It seems I consistently get fun games there where I can actually run different perk builds without worrying if the game will last more than 5 minutes. Lotta fun doctor builds to run in those ranks.
---
In red ranks he might as well not bring the chainsaw at all.
---
I put it back on to help me work on gens with them to help. And ones I see them doing nothing, if I‚Äôm being chased I bring the killer to them.
---
Learn how to loop or hide better.
---
Dying Light even isn't a popular perk.
---
Nea is abusive to the senses.
---
There is no need for the unpleasantries. The reason I chose these 3 is because they are the most m1 killers of the game. I want to learn to be a good killer with an m1 killer. As for wraith, I don‚Äôt want to use the invisibility and speed boost to get the drop on a killer, I want them to know I‚Äôm coming. 
---
You don‚Äôt need to use a ‚Äúnon-m1 killer‚Äù to win. Sure, those killers might make it easier to win with, but in the end they aren‚Äôt going to help me be a better killer overall.
---
I played quite a few games and it‚Äôs either 1 of 2 things: I‚Äôll try to throw it far and it hits a tree branch or something; I‚Äôll throw it where the survivor is running it‚Äôs waaay to short.
---
no cock and ball torture?
---
aight i‚Äôm boutta head out
---
Whats the name of perks btw i only know the cat one
---
YES I am I even filled out a support ticket and am waiting for an actual good reply rather than " we have taken your notice into consideration we will try to solve this as soon as possible"
---
Yep we as a community also want to make the game killer sided so survivor mains can't have fun! Slower gens! Higher killer movement speed! Better map control for all killers! Shorter flashlight blinds without lightborn! Slower gates opening! Ruin buff! Survivor exhaustion perks nerf! Adrenaline only triggers after you've been hooked 3 times! DS usable for 10/15/20 after unhook! Make DBD great! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I see, i kill. They surley won't predict THAT
---
Survivor perks that are (HIGHLY) debatably busted: MoM, Adrenaline, Balanced Landing (Haddonfield why)
---
Killer perks that are busted: NOED, (highly debatably) Nurses calling and Spirit Fury+Enduring
---
I swear if I see a single person say ruin is op, I want them to play killer for 10 games with ruin and tell me how many times it gets broken in the first minute of the game
---
Everything else is fine in my opinion since there‚Äôs clear counterplay to borrowed time, DS, BBQ, etc.
---
Also it's been 3 days so yeah no dbd is killing me
---
I don't use a headset. I'm a cheap bastard.
---
Overcharge with Unnerving Presence against a Doc so the skill check isn't in the center O_O
---
That's awesome!!!! She's super talented. You got a keeper for sure.
---
Dwight wears glasses and Jane's ass is thick.
---
I play in red ranks all the time and I get plenty of chainsaws.
---
Looks amazing!
---
At least we‚Äôre in it together, right? lmao
---
I just bring a mori and do what i must.
---
What do you mean by "The most M1 killers of the game"?  
---
You can't really be good with M1 killers as their skill-caps are very low.
---
Barbecue and Chilli, Hex:Ruin, Enduring and Spirit Fury are pretty much standard perks for M1 killers.
---
A Nurse's Calling, Monitor and Abuse, Sloppy Butcher and Hex:Haunted Ground are pretty good choices as well. Other perks can have sinergy with a specific killer, like Infectious Fright is very good for Nurse and Shape or Surveillance is very good for Spirit.
---
Do one gen, find hatch. Ez.
---
Don't set sensitivity to max. You'll just overcorrect. Do the setting you're comfortable at.
---
I have the weirdest lady boner right now
---
I get that but I‚Äôd honestly just rather the game be fun than having to resort to killing them myself bc if I don‚Äôt I can‚Äôt play the game the way it was designed.
---
&gt; I refuse to believe it‚Äôs truly fun for the survivors either as it has to definitely remove some of the anxiety as well.
---
Pretty much this. This game is built from the ground up to be a "what if" kind of game, in the sense that you have to guess what everyone else is doing, what the killer is doing, what you should be doing (all unless you can actually see people near you, obviously), etc. etc. etc. SWF? Nah, you can just say the killer is on you, or if they're camping, which direction they went after unhooking someone, what generator needs to be finished, etc. In a game that's built around the survivors not being able to directly communicate with each other, being able to immediately communicate on over voice comms/text is flat broken.
---
Also, inb4 the "I just wanna play the game with my friends, you're just mad because you don't have any friends to play with" bullshit.
---
Yup just gotta wait it out I'm hoping it's just a small inconvenience and not a tremendous problem like having our profiles completely deleted. What do you believe caused yours?
---
tfw people forget about the objective
---
Oh, 16% slower repair speed, ohhh, so scary, how can I survive now ? And Overcharge is literally useless at red ranks on anybody that isn't Impossible Skill Check Doctor.
---
I hope you marry her.
---
Greatest play you‚Äôll ever make? Damn dude lol
---
I made it to rank 4 with Wraith at level 1 and no add ons. Can‚Äôt do it anymore unfortunately, but it‚Äôs been done. Which means that with a good set of perks and add ons, I can do pretty well with any killer if/when I get good enough. 
---
By the most m1 killers, I mean that‚Äôs really all they have going for them. Especially the Plague, nothing helps her with looping or catching survivors unless they cleanse.
---
You can adjust where you are looking. Hold it longer but look down a little and you throw it in more of a straight line.
---
Trying to predict where they will go is hard and good survivors can avoid it. But if you can aim it at there back its hard to dodge without running into a bad situation
---
I feel like you've posted this before.
---
Regardless, I agree that Amanda could use some love, specifically with addon improvement. I also like your idea of a map-wide audio and visual cue for RBT deaths, as well as an icon switch.
---
Even if I agree with you, if Plague gets Corrupt Purge, you need to use high walls loops against her and also, a pallet stun remove her Corrupt Purge.
---
No clue man. I recently got back into this game and like 6 other friends started playing it a lot recently too. A couple of us were grinding out some challenges and I got up to around 250k bloodpoints and after spending it all, woke up to this error the next day. I heard that getting a lot of bloodpoints in a short amount of time leads to this so that‚Äôd explain a lot. Hope it‚Äôs fixed sooner than later
---
I just do it for SWF. Apparently to bhvr i shouldnt even need it because people dont play SWF that much.
---
Don't waste your time. The dipshits over at BHVR have her "rework" (aka fistfucking) on the top of their list.
---
Yeah, Lery's is pretty much guaranteed in the killers favor and Blood Lodge is in the survivor's.
---
Sometimes I am too scared to play killer. I don't even have ruin
---
They just need to make swf unranked. Problems solved.
---
I think having all the survivors play No Mither without the benefits is a huge advantage on a level one Wraith.  
---
My point is that you can't get good with M1 killers; their skill caps at moonwalking, cutting corners and learning how to play tiles. Besides, playing the game as a 115% ms killer without a power seems really boring.
---
Hahaha bit rude. I‚Äôm just having a discussion
---
Dribbling only worked next to a hook AND gave them 3 chance to flashlight save
---
Slugging doesnt solve the problem. They still had the perk, they were going to be healed and were just back on generators/loops
---
And enduring didnt counter it. It slightly lessened the effects.
---
I'm not huge on noed either, but it has more counter play than dstrike did.
---
RIP. 
---
You know, Trapper and incoming Ghost Face are also M1 killers also, maybe you also play them.
---
Understandable lol. Her names pupina i think shes just a troll who made alot of weird vids ik theres one abt her hating minions and one abt her wanting santa to spank her etc so i would take it with a grain of salt she was probably just trolling.
---
I switched to a survivor, and despite being killer main, my survivor rank is +4 of my killer, the game is balanced for survivors, that‚Äôs how it is now.
---
I really think this would solve it. Wanna play with your friends for shits and giggles fine here‚Äôs an unranked playlist.Want to earn rank go it alone and actually earn it. Or if we wanna make things really crazy if survivors can play with 3 other friends let me as the killer play with 1 of mine!
---
[https://youtu.be/uRFGT9JZZZo](https://youtu.be/uRFGT9JZZZo)
---
I main killer and my priority is smacking the shit out of the survivors and making it fun, or at least stressful for all. I'm really happy with a 4k but never actually expect one. Rarely do I get pissed. Oh, you're throwing a million pallets? That's basically a death sentence for your team-mates later :)
---
He wakes up and gets left behind. Then he borrows time to ...forgot...
---
Remember dead hard, remember dead hard, remember dead hard, oof David got me with ded arse  wkdnchdjsbd
---
Holy shit yeah.
---
I feel like every other game on Xbox is against an swf so maybe they need to look at their data again.
---
Kindred
---
Trapper isn‚Äôt a true m1 as he relies a lot on his traps to help mind game at loops. As for GF, I do plan to play him.
---
The devs should've just made SWF combine with KYF from the very beginning. You want to play with your friends? Fine, but the killer also gets every single perk they want fully upgraded and every add-on and offering they want as well.
---
Abuse of mechanics. 
---
At the time survivors were more powerful, this was around the time huntress came out.
---
Same here man.
---
You'll have fucktards claim "BHVR won't touch my precious SWF because it'll kill their game because so many people use it" and in the  VERY NEXT thread they'll say "LOL not many ppl use SWF, BHVR said so, get over it"
---
????
---
The thing is though I want The Killer to know I'm friends with my Lantern
---
I love moments that break character. The other day I hopped in a locker as the doctor was rounding a corner, he saw the door close and he stood in front of it and shook his body as of to say no. I got out and just looked up at him slowly.. then he left like he didn‚Äôt see anything and we went our separate ways. I was laughing so hard.
---
He is against good survivors, trust me.
---
You waste so much time for traps that can be easily disarmed, you might as well playing him like a M1 killer.
---
Not the dude above but the best thing to learn early is to let people go if they‚Äôre going to a strong loop or an area of the map with no gens
---
This would be so much better. I can‚Äôt remember ever having such a roller coaster experience with a game before. One minute it‚Äôs tons of fun and the next it‚Äôs crazy awful and I wonder why I‚Äôm playing.
---
Next Killer should be able to do this though I'm unsure how it would apply to female survivors.
---
Yes stop cleansing. Makes thanatophobia much more viable. People say the plag isn't good but all the hatemail I get says otherwise. I'm not even very good either I just find it funny.
---
Okay, so, while I can't actually play DbD due to money problems, I play IDV to scratch that itch and as a hunter main, this is actually the opposite of how I feel. I'm usually pretty chill when playing hunter and I just like to mess around. Sometimes I won't even land a hit and it's fine. It's when I play survivor that I panic (and run-) cause who knows what's gonna happen, if someone'll get ticked off cause I didn't rescue them in time.
---
I'm no expert, but I learned that if the survivor is really good, and you know that/ the Chase has lasted for a while, you can leave them to patrol gens. Don't get hung up on patrolling a hook/ watching for a save closely unless the gens are all finished, and if you have to choose between stopping someone from finishing a gen and  going back to the hook after a save, stop the gen.
---
wow at least I'm not the only one üòÇI thought I was thinking to much into it but survivors are dicks üòÇ
---
Too real
---
It's in the shrine this week if you got the shards for it
---
Honestly asking, why would enough killers play in that mode? Killer gets bonus blood points towards their ranked account?
---
Camping isnt bannable. Anyone who says it is, doeant play the game.
---
&gt;I refuse to believe it‚Äôs truly fun for the survivors either as it has to definitely remove some of the anxiety as well.
---
I haven't played SWF in over 8 months so let me tell you something, solo survivor experience is miserable to say the least. 
---
Unless you come across 3 equally experienced solo survivor players (which is extremely rare), you are usually going to have a terrible experience. 
---
* Teammates hiding in corners when the killer is clearly across the map.
---
* Teammates urban evading around the map when they can see that the killer is chasing you. Often times while I am looping the killer I manage to spot an immersed teammate mid loop and it just makes me stop looping. I lose all the will to continue playing that match cuz I am holding the killer for literally no reason. 
---
* Teammates crouching at pallets (even shack pallet) and immediately dropping instead of at least attempting to loop. 
---
* Teammates dropping pallets against a doctor who isn't even in punishment mode. Against a Freddy while they are still awake. Against Legion when they aren't injured. 
---
* Teammates not committing to generators and prioritizing unhooks when there is more than enough time to finish the gen.
---
I could spend all night listing a lot of silly misplays that you have to put up with in solo queue.
---
All of this can be avoided by playing SWF and having at least 1 veteran survivor telling them to stop being useless. At the same time, this wouldn't make them god players like depip squad so the killer shouldn't struggle if he knows how to play. 
---
**TLDR: Killers are too used to solo players because they usually spend way too much time idling around the map so the game takes ages to progress in favor of survivors. When they get a SWF squad or 4 solo veteran players, survivors are less forgiving and the killer needs to actually use his brain.**
---
Yeah, I mean it‚Äôs just a strategy that‚Äôs worked for me my post here was a little heated but I just wanted to have a discussion and see what others thought I know it‚Äôs worked for me
---
That's the secret. No one will fucking play it. It will just be 4 dudes beating off in a lobby.
---
Forever.
---
That‚Äôs because they need to cover up the fact and refuse to admit that if they couldn‚Äôt play with their friends they couldn‚Äôt touch the ranks that they do. That‚Äôs why they bully the killer cus it‚Äôs the only time they have the ability to do so.
---
We all worship ~~makuta~~ the entity
---
I haven't even read his notes but you're telling me he has a static noise when crouched and shit? what the fuck is the point of that lol
---
You cannot get banned from camping. As long as you don't anything in Chat that could be used against you. Then no. The only penalty you could even get is from Points for ranking. The most profitable fame you could get from camping is to have the people write something on your profile.  But I wouldn't worry as much since you everyone has a reason for camping.
---
That is my exact build for Claud other than WGLF. I run botany knowledge instead
---
&gt;Long time killer
---
&gt;Toss in some brutal strength
---
TheyHadUsInTheFirstHalfNotGonnaLie.jpg
---
Nah but seriously, great idea I just don‚Äôt think brutal strength is worth the perk slot.
---
It will give you a little boost but very little, you could have and other useful perk like BBQ, Nurses, bitter murmur, spirit fury, enduring.. etc...
---
Noed can get completely nullified by being cleansed.  Adrenaline can‚Äôt.
---
That was more David Copperfield levitation than flight.
---
I mean.... I guess
---
plot twist OP is a killer main and he wanted a survivor pudding .
---
very nice, i would just be throwing the drawing pad across the room because of the mouth
---
Not being coordinated is a challenge of the game. That‚Äôs why there are 4 survivors to make up for dead weight. Are there going to be some potato teammates? Yes, there are in every game ever. I would also be inclined to believe that teams would get better as you rank up as everybody got their on their own instead of being carried with swf. You wrote a whole lot to essentially say if people can‚Äôt play with friends they can‚Äôt win. So then that‚Äôs a player skill problem. And for the record Ive has my ass handed to me by plenty of non swf teams bc they knew what they were doing. I don‚Äôt want to play against a squad of randoms so I can win. I want to bc it‚Äôs more fair and balanced.
---
Well if a large group 3 to 4 all pop in together, if theyre friends, if the names are similar, if ttv is two of the names, the all have the same item, and if theyre all the same character.
---
I picked this game up about a week ago and am having a blast, but I still have yet to play as a killer. Might try hillbilly first
---
The same could be said about mettle of man. You are going to get them down, they are on their last hook, but then mettle procs and they make it to the exit gate.
---
Killers: survivors have it easier
---
My teammates: HURRE DURRRR RUN DIVE HOOK, dont Do GENS, GoT Downed DC DC DC
---
If you're on PC, you can check their friends list.
---
I feel like those happen less than just an SWF that joined at different times.
---
SWF: Hey we got 4 party streamers want to farm?
---
Killer: I'm about to end this SWF whole career. 
---
\*Pops Ebony Mori\*
---
Welp thats my criteria.
---
I‚Äôm the opposite. Killer games are whatever cus I don‚Äôt give a fuck ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and I mostly play killer too. Actually I‚Äôve only been playing killer for a long time now.
---
Welcome :)
---
What show is this? It looks familiar.
---
I just noticed I never pay attention to who joins my lobby as killer.
---
I guess it's me being in Europe servers or something then.
---
You give them less time to get to another pallet and you smash gens much faster I personally have it as one of my go tos on any m1 killer I run. And I run BBQ Nurses and bitter murmur in the all in one package perk you know as ‚Äúwhispers‚Äù
---
&gt; Not being coordinated is a challenge of the game.
---
I am not talking about coordination... I am talking about people consciously being useless when they could be working on a generator or running around the map instead of crouch walking. 
---
&gt;I would also be inclined to believe that teams would get better as you rank up as everybody got their on their own instead of being carried with swf.
---
Nope, ranking up in DBD is too easy (and it should be because of queue times) so people reach rank 1 with different levels of game knowledge. 
---
&gt;You wrote a whole lot to essentially say if people can‚Äôt play with friends they can‚Äôt win.
---
No... I said that your life is miserable because you have to witness people doing nothing more often than not. Which makes you gradually lose the will to continue playing or move towards SWF.
---
Games are unnecessary longer or unpleasant simply because people spend too much time idling around the map or wasted valuable resources.
---
Way better than my description on the forum smh my head, if only I was more creative D:
---
Playing against Spirit is so much fun especially when your able to mind game her instead of the typical other way around
---
Too be honest I kinda enjoy SWF in a killer perspective because they usually have a pattern of always saving each other even though that's normal it's to keep their power of friendship alive. Then there are the solo groups that slowly wait until the other one dies on hook for the hatch. But yea it's kinda a hit or miss sometimes but I don't really bother with it as much unless it's in Rank 1 it's a different story.
---
Aren't we all *oink*
---
Nipple clamps
---
I always wondered why this keeps happening to me also.
---
If I might ask, why save them for SWF?
---
Because I don‚Äôt have friends and I am jealous. Since I can‚Äôt have friends, no one else can either.
---
Exactly
---
They already said that the PTB version is not the version they intend to release.
---
It varies completely on people. Some people like the challenge some people don't. Everyone has their own opinions even now.
---
That‚Äôs too much prep work for me. I like to be lazy.
---
In some moods yes. While I play the game more casually now (Billy main in PS4). In some situations I'm like this. While I don't doubt some of my chainsawing capabilities. Sometimes it just feels like that. I just try to keep it calm.
---
I have rt as my use item and lt as my sprint
---
Remember: Dead Hard, DS, Mettle, Adrenaline, Borrowed time, unbreakable. Survivor is so much less stressful thanks to so many clutch save perks

Okay, so. Borrowed Time becomes a problem when all 4 survivors are running it. It‚Äôs not OP (used to be though) , but when combined with pre nerf DS and pre nerf MoM, it was hell. DS took the hate away from Adrenaline, but AD isnt NEARLY as broken. It‚Äôs not even THAT broken, but the fact that a survivor who has done nothing benefits from it is a little iffy in my book. At least a survivor should have to be required to do one gen or have a decent amt of chase points.
---
Opposite... Like am I the only one who still gets sacred and nervous playing as a survivor???? You know what survivors you're going up against as a killer but you might not know what killer you're up against until you face them (directly or indirectly).
---
 The heart beating gets to me for some reason and if I see a killer w/o hearing it I get even more freaked out. I've played with so many selfish survivors that I feel like it's 1v1 all the time.
---
Killer is fun because.......you're a Killer. No threat besides playing poorly.
---
I have been thinking about DbD versus the old game evolve lately. I think what evolve did so nicely was that the one had the objective and therefore, was in the power role to control the momentum of the game. DbD has a serious issue with survivors controlling the game and the killer just trying to stop them. I get that it fits the theme, but I really hope a good assymetrical game comes out soon where the one is the power and objective role. Sad that deathgarden went the same route as DbD with only having the hunter chase survivors while the control the game momentum.
---
I get that. I like a good challenge. I used to run soul level 1 runs on dark souls. The difference there was if I fucked up it was on me. The game didn‚Äôt make it harder on me by applying crazy ass game breaking advantages.
---
&gt;The ranking system for survivors would also need to be adjusted as well. This way good survivors move up and away from the bad ones. As far as life being miserable yea man cus it‚Äôs all roses and rainbows playing against an swf.
---
Again, killers get too used to playing against idle survivors that they start complaining when survivors are actually being useful. 
---
Easy difficulty = Idle survivors (or solo players according to the average killer).
---
Normal difficulty = SWF with one or two veteran players. You can still easily down 2 to 3 survivors in this group so managing them shouldn't be hard. 
---
Hard difficulty = SWF with 4 veteran players who are good at looping.
---
if something is reasonably counter-able and doesn't ruin the experience, survivor or killer, then it's not toxic imo
---
Changing that would be a huge nerf to hag, the camera change is just part of her power
---
I don't even check who enters my lobbies.
---
No they absolutely should balance around rank 1s, I'm tired if being punished with improper balance for not playing like a potato, the majority of players end up in red ranks anyways, and trickle down balance is a thing.
---
oh yeah, she was a confirmed troll don't worry
---
her videos were pretty funny
---
Mathieu C√¥t√©, the director of BHVR, the corporation that develops the game, said one time ago " I think we did a pretty good job so far " during an interview. But given the number of bugs and funny glitches that were still in the game at that time, plus the YouTubers that got to make this a meme, this funny sentence has become popular in the in the DbD community
---
So this is just a normal tier list but inverted?
---
In that case, Freddy is too 'high', and I reckon Spirit and Hag should switch places. Hard agree on literally everything else though, I'm glad someone else can see how bad Plague and Clown are.
---
Meh I like to play 3-gen doc and drag the game out for so long the SWF team embraces death.
---
And still gets called sweaty lol.
---
Then dead hard, then DS, then adrenaline (if gens were all complete)
---
There ain‚Äôt no real way to tell. If the survivor is being chased or is inside your terror radius while having the deep wound status, then their timer won‚Äôt go down at all. Also, if they are mending when their timer reaches 0, it won‚Äôt have any affect unless they stop before completing it.
---
While some of this is true, the tldr is insulting to killers.
---
Killers are not "used to solo players" (you must mean casual, non-competitive). The reason killers believe they face a lot of 4 man SWF, is because:
---
1 they get a lot of games with 4 solo veterans. It's not hard to imagine, considering the player base size, average hours for players who have played more than a year, and average players per day. At least half of DbD players are veteran, and a ton of those vets play solo.
---
2 they do face SWF a lot. Just not always 4 man teams. 2 man, and 3 man teams are more common. 
---
Saying killers have to "use the brain" when up against SWF, is ignorant. 
---
Most Killers I face (rank 1-10) are so try hard they will tunnel and camp a rank 20 that started the game stuck in a tree. They using every tactic they can to destroy anyone they face like it was four 4000hrs rank 1 SWF with comms and they just spanked him the last match. No chill for the most part. 
---
If there is a "has to use their brain" above the sweaty bastards I see, you better not tell me what they do, because it's probably bannable, and nsfw.
---
That sounds like a response I would give when I was 16. The dude literally told you how to check if the team was SWF.
---
If I had that trapper perk for him, then I would as well, but alas I do not.
---
The bar does go down, but don‚Äôt expect it to ever hit zero &amp; down the survivors. If they are in your terror radius, the Deep Wounds timer pauses. If they aren‚Äôt, they are just going to mend.
---
not at all if they're dumb enough to be nearby they deserve a wack

First of all never said unplayable, I said it‚Äôs not as enjoyable. This is now the second time you have read something that wasn‚Äôt there so please work on that. Secondly are you joking? ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs on me work on the gen‚Äù ‚Äú He broke off and is heading your way hide‚Äù ‚Äúim on hook he‚Äôs still here to my left/right/behind‚Äù ‚Äúhe‚Äôs chasing me through field, there‚Äôs a totem near the haybell‚Äù ‚ÄúI got 3  totems anybody got anymore‚Äù All of that‚Äôs just off the top of my head but I can keep going if I need to. I think it‚Äôs really disingenuous of you to act like being able to communicate doesn‚Äôt at least tip the odds in the survivors favor.
---
Why is it always Dwights who do this? Lol
---
Learn how to run a killer.  Every survivor in this game needs to be able to hold their own in a chase.  If you can't do this you're just about useless to your teamates.
---
Hostile? Yeah, he did and while I appreciate it, I‚Äôm not going to go through that to do it. I‚Äôm 24 and know damn well what I‚Äôm going and not going to do.
---
I watched all the movies played and own two copies of evil dead first broomstick and once my prop skills got better I had to cosplay a gender bent ash anyways what does ash fall under like example healer or mechanic stuff  like
---
Welcome to killer friend. SWF is just one of those things you have to stomach.
---
One tiny silver lining I can tell you is that SWF groups are good practice. You can improve your killer play by versing them. It's not usually a pleasant experience, but you do get some experience.
---
In the end though, SWF definitely needs to be balanced. Just do your best and try not to let the assholes get under your skin.
---
Why do so many people run Thanta? The perk is hot garbage with the exception of a Freddy build.
---
To answer OPs question, most people run BBQ\Ruin + 2. Just depends on the killer. If it‚Äôs a highly aggressive 115 killer like Bubba or Billy, you‚Äôll want Enduring at a minimum plus one, most people use spirit fury. If it‚Äôs any other killer, run whatever other 2 floats your boat.
---
You're right, she doesn't need to be any weaker :(
---
Depends on the perks/add ons. Certain setups are a pain in the ass to verse.
---
That's one of the main reasons I regret making it to red ranks each season. 
---
Then again, I haven't really noticed killers using try hard setups. Most of my survivor matches have been pretty chill. 
---
My biggest gripe is lousy teammates (even at red ranks).
---
Anyone notice how big her front teeth look? lookin like buck teeth
---
Are you trying to suggest that Vigil is actually a good perk? I use it ironically as a Quentin main but it is one of the worst survivor perks right now.
---
Vigil is supposed to be the debuff perk. It's not useful if it doesn't debuff you most of the time.
---
&gt;I don't know why you are so mad that afflictions without timers are not changed by a perk that only reduces timers.
---
1 It works against all add ons that don't say "until healed". That should be obvious. Thinking the perk is useless because you lack reading comprehension is fucked up.
---
I stated that Vigil only works on debuffs with timers in the second sentence. It was even in capital letters for you. Maybe you should check your own reading comprehension skills.
---
You're playing against low rank killers if you're not getting downed without cleansing lmao
---
Hes in the basement right now so hes not there for the photo
---
Easily the best totem spawn.
---
I've watched the show and meet Bruce Campbell at monsterpalooza cooler in person and I've been doing that you know being a distraction as soon at I help my teammates and i get hooked they fucken leave me to die keeps pissing me off I've my share of shity teammates in rainbow 6 overwatch payday and F13 but these guys are on a whole different level of shity teammates sad thing is I play on Xbox
---
This will be my last reply because I am bored of this discussion. 
---
&gt;First of all never said unplayable, I said it‚Äôs not as enjoyable.
---
Whatever, the point stands. I didn't bother to go check every word you used but the overall picture remains the same.
---
&gt;‚ÄúHe‚Äôs on me work on the gen‚Äù
---
As a solo player, if he isn't chasing me, I am working on a generator. Don't need someone to tell me this. 
---
&gt;‚Äú He broke off and is heading your way hide‚Äù
---
I use my eyes and ears to know if the killer is coming my way. If the survivors hud hasn't changed in a while, the killer is probably looking for people so my attention is higher during this moment. When someone gets injured, I can relax. 
---
If I can hide, good. If not, he must chase someone otherwise he will just continue to patrol until he finds a survivor anyway.
---
&gt;‚Äúim on hook he‚Äôs still here to my left/right/behind‚Äù
---
I continue to work on my generator for as long as I can before moving in for save, as long as there is enough time to unhook before struggle. This tells me nothing because if he is still there, he isn't coming for me and he is losing generator progress. 
---
&gt;‚Äúhe‚Äôs chasing me through field, there‚Äôs a totem near the haybell‚Äù ‚ÄúI got 3 totems anybody got anymore‚Äù 
---
This one I can agree on. Totems are way easier on SWF. As a killer I don't use totems so this doesn't affect me but still true. 
---
&gt;I think it‚Äôs really disingenuous of you to act like being able to communicate doesn‚Äôt at least tip the odds in the survivors favor.
---
It does tip for the reasons I mentioned. It reduces the chance of misplays by inexperienced players in the match but still far from the huge issue usually stressed out by killers.
---
Last one I got bitched out about was my Freddy Build
---
- Green &amp; Purple sleeping blocks for addons
---
-NOED/Franklyns/Ruin/Bamboozle 
---
Not really a painful build, but apparently a "sweaty build" as the survivor kids I versed called it
---
My favorite is when tbagging survivors who had two invisible claudettes get a taste of noed and die. Makes it worth it being used on me when I play survivor.
---
Yeah.. i do. Youre missing the point even if i was a  master at looping im still at the mercy of bloodlust, Hitboxes, and late hits. It doesnt help anyone if we're all injured the killer can play on peoples fear of corrupt purge. Youre basically saying just loop and that cant always make you win it changes match to match. You sound dumb man.
---
I mean, there are only 4-5 truly optimal killers imo
---
Well I‚Äôm jealous, I‚Äôd love to meet him someday. 
---
As for the game, that sucks but survivors like that do exist. I play on PC, can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs much better but finding a game doesn‚Äôt take any time at all in my experience.
---
[deleted]
---
Wow someone cant take a joke weeb
---
Sorry for flex
---
This reddit would be a lot nicer if people bothered playing both sides
---
Yep :). Ill take a better pic of the axe later!
---
Did she get tunneled and camped
---
Why would the killer bring adrenaline? /s
---
Lol all these things determine if I even play
---
If your teamates do gens during your chases you're fine.  Again I can run a killer for multiple gens.  Uou obviously cannot if you think it's better to continuously feed the killer a downing projectile to use against your teamates.  The best is when they collect the pool your dumbass fed them and use it to proxycamp the hooked survivor.  That little double play you set up with the killer is so much fun for us...
---
Ew, why tuck your pants into your boots when you could blouse them? Fr still looks good tho
---
That was your game going out and not there‚Äôs. And that sucks the most! 
---
Hope you get your adept soon
---
Thank you, captain obvious
---
Agreed. The us vs them mentality is not healthy. I main killer but I‚Äôve played survivor as well. It‚Äôs not really my thing but I get that people enjoy it. When I play survivor idk use party chat cus I know that sucks for killer. Just like when I play killer I do my best not to tunnel or use NOED cus I hate that happening to me. Unless you‚Äôre toxic then all bets are off lol
---
"Huh, whats that wooshi-OOH FUCK!"
---
Eh, Yew Seed only reduces movement speed by 3%. It essentially makes the Huntress a 113% killer for 30 seconds against that specific target. Does it help? Sure, but you're honestly better off with exhaustion addons or faster windup/cooldown.
---
I would use dead HARD there not gonna lie.
---
Yea had this guy who talked trash on frequent basis, he dc once I was about to mori him. Take names, mori later.
---
Exactly ! 
---
I just had enough time to play every killer once before I started to come up against decent survivors. I decided to stick with one Killer to improve faster (Trapper) and after 10 games or so I started to see purple Self Cares and Exhausted perks kinda everywhere. 
---
I had to adapt pretty fast to this build so now I run NOED, Bitter Murmur to get at least one more survivor at the end, 30% cooldown reduction on attacks and 20% faster destruction so I can allow my nooby self some mistakes along the way.
---
What if noed had charges based on totems still up at last gen and each hit used a charge.
---
I don‚Äôt think you know what toxic means
---
It‚Äôs surely doesn‚Äôt describe pointing out the fact that shouldering the entire responsibility is very different than being apart of a four man team
---
Clown.
---
Looped to eternity.
---
Nani?
---
Yeah exactly. 
---
Facing those builds you described with purple flashlight and two battery add ons make you feel that the Meg trolling you is the real killer and you‚Äôre just in a TV Show about retarted killers.
---
I have a long way to go then how long does it take to grind a survivor
---
nah man the double wind up addons are the best
---
How about steam cloud
---
Get ruin and pray
---
A well experienced team can get the doors open in under 4 minutes if there‚Äôs nothing to slow the game down, the killer can only chase one person and if they use their time well (which they should be) the match can be extremely short, killers and survivors both want longer matches to earn more points/ build up their emblems, short matches hurt them both and before you say ‚Äúbut survivors have nothing else to do‚Äù I know, and that‚Äôs one of the biggest issues because survivors know that the only two reliable things you can do to get points is be chased and do generators
---
Yeah my first salt mail was ¬´¬†Nice camping bro !¬†¬ª like mate not my fault you got hooked in the basement and the last 3 gens are right around the shack because I have a strategy and I only let you do the gens I couldn‚Äôt defend anyway ? 
---
Closing the hatch in front of the last slug is pretty satisfying too, especially when it‚Äôs that one survivor you didn‚Äôt see the whole game doing gens at Mach 4.
---
People need to stop viewing Dead by Daylight as a "competitive game" - it is *not*. The only thing *competitive* about this game is the rank system, which is an absolute joke. 
---
Dead by Daylight is a party game. This game would be a lot more enjoyable if everyone treated it as such.
---
As long as the audience agrees that the people being killed are the villains, then this is pretty standard story telling. If you agree that the camp counsellors deserved to pay for their negligence etc., then Jason's enemies become yours. If you don't agree (or can't be convinced) with that, then the fact that the killer hates the people doesn't change your perception of them.
---
Heroes can do almost anything to the bad guys when we support their cause. See: all martial arts movies ever. :-)
---
Can you get us to support a killer where the targets were objectively just in their actions? Even though the killer is the only one who disagrees with that? Hard to do in a short movie, may be possible in a book.
---
Thanat is ass and barely adds any time.
---
Only Monto's skillcheck can only satisfy him.
---
Thanks for yout feedback. I had prepared 1 more attack i thought i could fit it in but i decided not to, because the attack's sprite wasn't done yet.   
---
Here's unpolished version of the attack am talking about (Trapper blaster... I really had no other name for it)  
---

People don't like to admit it but face camping is a real strategy. Is it a good strategy? That's debatable. If you have a lobby with asshole survivors that don't care for each other then you're probably just gonna walk away with one kill. Also if they're running kindred then yea face camping is useless. But every now and then you'll get altruistic survivors who will try to save, and its that altruism that face campers depend on. 
---
Again, is it a good strategy? IMO, it's not. 
---
But it is indeed a strategy. 
---
PS: Before you go off thinking I'm defending face camping or accuse me of being a face camper; since the day I installed Dead by Daylight, not once have I even thought of doing that. I never needed to, I never will and its just not fun. 
---
Thank you~
---
Why are using premonition use spine chill
---
I can still remeber it nice and clear when I had just bought the game right after freddy had come. I thought the invisible killer picking up a survivor was bug or that the killer was too far to render or something :D 
---
God was I stupid.
---
I don‚Äôt think he ever said that killers need a direct buff because survivors have it too easy, if he did than I did not see it and would be mistaken, I never even told you to talk to him, I said that WE can have a conversation and if you want to, you need to stop whining
---
Yeah, its because youre alone and your failures lead to just disappointment. No early out like survivors, when you die you can just leave.
---
I miss these days too be honest.
---
for all of those practicing a new killer power or survivor juke, don't give up. if you work as hard as you can, you'll figure it out.
---
cheers!
---
Should be B then, I‚Äôll try this tonight. Thanks again for the tips man and have fun !
---
Vigil is ass no matter what you run it with.
---
How much? Take my money.
---
You are one person, not everyone is going to count totems in solo without scouring the map and wasting time.
---
Dame even when I can escape the meg still wants her bloodpoints
---
It's just an easy injury now. They nerfed every aspect of Legion's power and made them feel bad to play.
---
If the killer would have hit you with the lunge without you being locked in the animation, then just save the pallet and run somewhere else, but if the killer were to only hit you if you were to be on the other side of the pallet and you can keep running around
---
See you on the other side bro bro
---
That is also true.
---
It doesn't go down in your terror radius AND you can't see the progress as the killer.
---
Because god forbid you could actually play around your own power as killer.
---
Use ruin. It slows down the game JUST A LITTLE BIT.
---
Did it count as an escape?
---
Happens everytime man. That's why I usually run Rancor for the dailies but majority of the time when I pop a mori they just have a Party streamer and I just say "DAMMIT!!"
---
yup i get offended if someone calls my art for weeb and says that they would quit the game if they see my skin in game. Like bru? whatever joke or not idc anymore i just wanna share my skin design
---
Self Care, Head On, Quick and Quiet and Plunders.
---
Ill update with footage when it uploads.
---
What platform and rank are you?
---
Kill her, because she is not the legendary Wholesome Julie.
---
Careful there son, throw a green add-on and she might be a decent killer outside the 3 gen strat.
---
They just decided to nerf the killer auto lock. I mean. Come on man. That sounds pretty fucking forgiving.  I'm not saying one has it harder than the other. I'm saying how do any of you fucks actually know, objectively,  who suffers or is catered to more. You all sound so closed minded its infuriating to say the least. It's not that fucking complicated to realise if both sides think they have it worse, maybe it's just not a good game. There is just too many of you who play this game. 
---
Glad we had this talk
---
Don‚Äôt you think how much better the game would be if everyone had conversations about what they think the game should be? And I agree, NOED should be changed. I most definitely disagree on that, the game is not in a fine state, especially in terms of balance where you have a camping letherface and completely destroy your rank if you run into him multiple times, that doesn‚Äôt sound fine to me. And I don‚Äôt think longer gen times would be a buff only for killers, maybe if the only way you ranked up was from killing survivors but it‚Äôs not, the killer has to many different things to rank up and the longer gen would allow more time for emblems and bloodpoints to be gained for both sides, do I think this would fix the game? Absolutely not
---
Thank you for calling me cute üòä as for dbd yeah I tell need to unlock alot of perks and I'm going to need to grind like hell thank you for the help

Inaccurate to Ace mains, we're too busy looting chests to care about gens

Got to play freddy multiple times for free. Queued as Hag using one of the glass pieces to play as freddy to test him out. Someone dcd or something while we were loading so i ended up back at the lobby and had freddy selected as a killer. I had access to his perks, blood web, etc. Went away when i selected another killer. 
---
Side note: leveled his blood web a bit then bought freddy out right and the perks/addons stayed!

Aww, they deleted it. What was so funny?

Do the quentin now

Well I was thinking that it's of his own volition not to kill innocent people.. see while the mask does grant him super natural abilities.. this helps explain how most.. well how at least he's able to perform those serial killer.. moves like appearing out of no where when he was behind you, how he can stab you with a knife and you can hang from a wall.. by a knife.. how they are able to take abnormal damage.. while still being kill able. 
---
or being able to have
---
Super Natural Evil Sense: The mask gives the wearer a super natural sense, which the wearer can sense the Evil intents in others. This happens mostly, from personal contact with any said person, but in cases the wearer can sense the evil from very horrible people such as, Rapist, Serial Killers, and Sexual Predators.. I mean they have to be pretty fucked.. the mask gets corrupted.. and will force him to try and harm an innocent person.. or maybe he can easily mistake anyone as a threat..
---
still working out the kinks.. I did want to give the mask a curse or something.. but idk.. but I just wanted him to kill bad people.. because I know people.. see real injustices being done to them or others.. and they are helpless to do anything.. so was this guy and then.. he was given this mask or he found it.. and he was finally able to do it.. not only did he kill but he enjoyed ripping them into parts.. 
---
Is he the wraith of a dead man.. innocent man or is he a human under the mask?
---
I also came up with this killer before hearing of Dexter.. but i guess i use dexter since he's the only serial killer who also kills bad people.
---
I was a Lawbringer tho!
---
This! Always break pallets even if a surviver gets away, nothing more annoying than looping with pallets down.
---
I mean, Hag isn't too bad even without add-ons, but I see no reason to bitch about her or her add-ons. I mean, you can bitch about Mint Rag with Make Your Choice on her, but these survivors complained about a Hag using 2 yellow add-ons, saying : "look who need add-ons to win". The sad part is that the guy who complained about her add-ons also used a Toolbox with yellow add-ons ... .

Reminds me of this one time with [Meg and Tum Tums](https://imgur.com/xID7Q32)

This is on point

Equip insidious, sit behind a corner, and wait to snipe someone without terror radius. I'd literally meme whole game long with this killer. I like it.

One of the main problems on that map for me is there aren't enough windows.

Ds makes ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù, a random person the obsession, not the user.

He must be really special

To that Claudette that was t bagging and hasn't been hooked once please don't use those pallets

I dc whenever I see someone cleanse

The Pig is going to be Top Tier when she gets her cosmetics.

Ouh yeah üòÅ.

Enjoy your 3v1 games cuz I‚Äôm out

Spine chill, empathy, lithe and auto dick dick for the win
---
I actually like playing against legion now, it's fun and can make for interesting matches, idk why so many people are still against them haha
---
Might as well use them up now
---
He‚Äôs right tho. I dc whenever I see some moron cleanse
---
Just throw it and don‚Äôt camp the pallet. If killer is getting too close, don‚Äôt throw it and take a hit. You don‚Äôt need those 1k points
---
Know your pain, my Freddy with just the sleeping blocks 
---
Getting the riot act, from the guys running MoM and Adrenaline
---
You DC because somebody else doesn't play the way you do? Sounds like you're the moron
---
Prestige just resets you and gives you one bloody cosmetic, it's a waste of time for new players. Teachables which are character specific unlock at levels 30 35 and 40 after which they'll be in other bloodwebs. Level David King first to get We're Gonna Live Forever, that helps reduce the grind.
---
Lmao what a loser. This topic will get banned eventually though.
---
My planet needs me
---
They stack together?
---
Same rules as for survivors (https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Crows#Spawn_Time)? It'll be useless.
---
I dc because someone can‚Äôt stand being injured so much he fucks his entire team and forces them to cleanse too, only to touch a infected gen a second later. He chooses to fuck me up? I choose to fuck him up.
---
Yep add to the DCing problem. Why play the game if youre gonna dc?
---
Why?
---
I ONLY dc when someone cleanses. They can‚Äôt stand being injured so much they choose to fuck the entire team over and force them to cleanse, only to touch an infected gen a moment later. You choose to fuck me up? I choose to fuck you up. I‚Äôd rather play another game than deal with idiots
---
*what have your brought upon this cursed land*
---
You would get his iron sights in first person so I think it would work :D
---
Trapper is surprising to me, huntress not so much, she is fun to play and fairly strong.
---
Go and hug her.
---
Replace DS with MoM and you've got yourself a me.
---
Oink tier seems fairly balanced, maybe devs should nerf it with a buff?
---
Ok
---
So I just played a game and i was just told the killer was a hack because he ran faster then survivors and he had a perk that he didn't have equipped does this happen often
---
"Nerf it with a buff" LOL, this should become a meme btw.
---
Right....lets DC to teach people not to use a mechanic in the game. Or better lets just not use pallets at all like none or even better lets just go AFK.
---
Im done. Im gonna keep playing how i play i tend to live. You can play that way and if you live whatever.
---
he choose to infect himself. cleansing is a bad idea all along, it's a fucking trap. being injured doesn't change anything, you  can still loop for many minutes while being injured. those people who are like "lEt Me SeLfCaRe FoR 40 sEcOnDs BeFoRe UnHoOkInG yOu. Oh YoU dIeD lOl" are annoying me as fuck and vs the plague they can not only waste time, but also fuck everyone with it! AMAZING!
---
Depending on what role you play, As survivor you are a in a much weaker state, but you have teamwork and deception on your side.  As Killer you are and Unstoppable force of destruction... but you can only be in one spot at any one time. stay on the move and keep an eye out for survivors, If one is wasting your time peel off and focus on your objectives.   
---
I would recommend playing both roles so you can see how they behave. 
---
Oh and of course play the tutorial. It doesnt offer much insight into the primary mechanics and how they interact but you do get a bunch of blood points. Once you do that pick a character and try and get them upto level 40 or so for their teachable perks.   
---
I would recommend Dwight, Meg, or Claudette for Survivor and/or Trapper, Billy, Huntress.  as starting Survivors and killers
---
Make it low how survivors don't get crows when they're on gens.
---
get used to playing 3v1
---
The worst thing is that on the screenshots it of rank 1 it isnt even the same gamertag as the guy posting them
---
[Yup](https://en.meming.world/images/en/thumb/4/4a/Modern_Problems_Require_Modern_Solutions.jpg/300px-Modern_Problems_Require_Modern_Solutions.jpg)
---
Bruh im like 99% sure youre the only person who dc's for that.
---
Only if the killer is afk
---
What's 2.7 mean?
---
I'm saying full tier 3 perk build players on either side, will not also have the advantage of having very rare addons and Moris to at lower ranks on less experienced players. And will also be incentivized to rank up in order to use them
---
This is sub is heavily a survivor main sub. Then I was called a 12 year old because I genuinely laughed that hard and thanked him for making me laugh after the bad day I was having.
---
Clown's ability is literally the most basic boring shit ever
---
Does the Deep wound heal work with Mangle and Nurses calling? Also is there a limit to how many hits you can do to a target while in frenzy or can it just never get a down?
---
Players play a killer a lot =/= overpowered, clown isn't the weakest killer, but he's probably the least fun to play as
---
This isn't a tier list, just the amount of certain killer's encountered
---
IT'S IN WORDS! God, it's shocking how pressure and the fear of BM can deter me from playing killer. I wish the devs realized.
---
"Remember. Dead hard" that's so fucking me, I always forget it..
---
Very cool - love the Black Swan vibe. Good luck!
---
Getting some bloodborne vibes from that headpiece. Overall, I like it
---
The only time slugging someone and waiting until end game collapse to kill them is ok is if they crawled into a corner where all the hooks are broken and they keep running back to it when they get off your shoulder/the gate is really close
---
How much faster is she in spirit form then? She must be really fast for it to be good
---
Ikr, survivors have so many perks that save you when you fuck up
---
I'm sorry is that fullbright? What is that lighting, why pc players gotta be cheaty lil cunts bruh
---
There are also maps that are really good for some killers. For example I think I've never got less than 3 kills at backwater swamp as Billy. Also coldwind farm, the one that spawns with a lot of open field in the middle of the map (sorry I don't remember the name of this map spawn), if you use Billy there you can almost check every gen with one single sprint. In this map you can lose as billy only if you use the mouse with a foot and the keyboard with your nose.
---
This has to be the Worst "logic" I have ever seen
---
\-"Don't Cleanse, it will screw over the team"
---
\-Dc's when unhappy and screws over the team
---
\*So it appears you are OK with you screwing over the team but not with others doing it" Pretty hypocritical
---
I play both, both are easy if you are learn to play. Stop being a baby.
---
Abortion joke. Chinese babies are usually aborted if female.
---
Uhhhh.... that's so useless tho
---
Upvoted for honesty
---
Doesn't matter if I'm stressed before, after a killer game I'm ready to never play killer again
---
Totally fair and balanced and intended for the game
---
Stockholm syndrome is a condition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity.
---
But you get bloody points
---
I'd help out. I love not trying that hard
---
She's a cutie. An innocent face.
---
Dude, I'm not commenting on how easy either one is, I'm just saying that you're salty that killers are complaining.
---
The thing is though:
---
What they did is against the EULA.
---
The right thing to do would have been pressuring the devs into giving them the legacy cosmetics back, not forcefully getting it on their own even if it meant hacking them in.
---
Imho Spirit is a really underrated killer. Very strong in the right hands. If you have a good build on her, and are willing to put in the time to learn her, she's an amazing killer. Her ability can be used to cut down chases by a long shot if used properly.
---
The only info I can find is in "Outdated" section of the Wiki and it says 176%
---
You realize all you have to do is follow the heartbeat right CJ?
---
She looks angry as fuk

Literally me everytime i play hillbilly. I run after a survivor, charge up the chainsaw and the camera angle fucks up and im launched into an object.

I see it all the time in this sub and I'm sick of it.
---
She uses empathy, so she's a keeper.
---
Same. I had to buy Hag just to get ruin because the shrine is being a dick
---
Thank you!
---
Spirit ismore powerful than clown
---
Who screenshots their pips for single games like that? I get screenshotting when you get a perfect game with all 4 iridescent, but like, it's just an average single pip, who cares lmao?
---
Killers like this is the main reason why I bitch as a survivor main. That and when a killer just face camps and tunnels off hook without the survivor even BMing them...
---
Yeah about build, i'm pretty new to the game so i can't make builds yet, is that a big problem?
---
The Claudette player in your example is playing perfectly fine.  If the Killer is being looped for a long time and she is super close, odds are if she exposes herself the Killer will then switch on to her, especially if she can tell that she is not nearly as good of a looper.
---
In this example, the person being chased should lead the Killer away from the teammate (Claudette)  so that the Claudette feels the need to stop hiding and can go back to gens
---
Oink D:
---
Welcome to the fog.
---
Nothing more to be said really, lol.
---
This level of anxiety is why I'm a Leatherface main.  He kills out of fear of making the Entity angry &amp; it helps me get into character.
---
And I 'Shouldn't have to'  spend time making you less salty. And if anyone's the dick it's you. So stop being so salty and calm down.
---
Yaaaaas I love this!
---
Its takes me 2 to 2 and a half minutes to find a totem. I wouldnt say useless. 
---
I feel you guys need to just deal with the fact NOED isnt getting nerf there are litterally many counters to it. Just because you guys rush gens and dont think about noed is not anyones fault but your own.
---
Don‚Äôt threaten me with a good time Dwight‚Äôs boy
---
I'd like to watch some former Nurse main who's now a Spirit main because she's a stronger killer. But I don't think I've seen one on Twitch. I know, it's a small sample size, but still.
---
People that don't play Pig don't play the game correct. OINK OINK
---
I just turn the brightness up using the Nvidia control panel, Claudettes can't really hide then.
---
\-This is just flat out wrong. DS had WAY more Counterplay than NOED. DS had 10+ ways to Counter.  
---
\-I also don't think you know what the Word Counter means.  Trying to claim that Enduring wasn't a counter when it literally reduced the length of the Stun of DS basically proves this: 
---
\*Slugging is definitely a Counter, you can't use DS if not picked up.  
---
\*Dribbling is definitely a counter. You could successfully dribble from very far away. 
---
\*Even things like Unnerving Presence (Even Smaller Skill Check to hit), Agitation (can't use DS if you get hooked before you wiggled enough), and Rancor (Can't DS if the 1st time you are caught you get Mori'd) are all counters.
---
\*Heck, even having other teammates using DS was a way to counter it being too widely used since Non Obsession DS users rarely even got to attempt to use it.
---
"Fuck up" oh no I successfully hit a survivor, dangit I forgot I was supposed to let them go my bad bruh. Go fuck yourself
---
Spirit is a powerful killer but has a high skill cap but it's more mindgames than mechanical skill, unlike the Nurse. If you're willing to put the time in she's worth it but otherwise if you're inexperienced you might want to go for another killer.
---
That just takes a couple seconds
---
Agree 100%,  Haha trashes downvoting you, i swear 90% of people on this sub are casuals that have no idea of the game and circlejerk eachother all day.
---
You are correct.
---
Is the video actually any bit good or is it just the cliche:
---
"Let's put a young Kid in a video. He will say generic stuff but many people will watch and like it becuz look, IT IS A KIDDDDDDD!!!!"
---
I'm rank 8.
---
That's not an insult then you say I'm uneducated. You funny kid.
---
Playing survivor is like going on a vacation. No stress in the world.
---
Your obsession with salt is disturbing.
---
Hello pig king
---
&gt; At least I'm not a piece of shit. Do you get high off insulting people online?
---
Oh dear. When all the toys are already thrown out of the pram, I guess we're at the stage where you have *nothing* left but practiced insults. But feel free to keep at it, because you've made me laugh quite a bit today. 
---
And also, I'm archiving this before it gets deleted because of your shit-flinging temper tantrum. How kind!
---
Not sure I was under the belief that you can look at what they have but he said you can see what they have
---
Bro whaaat
---
Right back at you.
---
I'm at rank 12 on PC rn and all I get is gg for either side. Can't wait to test rank 11 lol
---
Ah, I don't look at very many tier list. I suppose the correct term I was looking for was more so 'Under-Represented'. I just say underrated since I don't see her talked about much when mentioning strong killers. For a lot of people it's Nurse or Nothing, and for a lot of others they just give more credit to Myers. (Which is fair, I think Myers is a lot easier to pick up compared to Spirit.)
---
It would render insidious completely useless.
---
Already responded to a similar comment just make it like how survivors don't get crows when working on gens.
---
To be honest, I think the warning is enough itself, letting survivors know how many totems are left seems a little strong, for countering hexes and the like...
---
But being able to know at the moment of the last gen, that the killer can oneshot you, changes your playstyle.
---
&gt; I miss those games
---
not me i'm "forced" to play at only  10% of my real power to not bully them.
---
Just let us know we're exposed &amp; we good.
---
I think what's most likely to happen is that killers (who have quite game changing purple/red add-ons and offerings) can't wait to tryhard their way to red ranks after rank reset to be able to use their best stuff and sit there in empty lobbies because survivors are so motivated to get to red ranks to use their ... what ... brand new parts whose effect is undone with a single PGTW charge? Odd bulbs? Only thing still really worth using are the syringes, but those are already on the devs' nerf radar, probably going down to BNP level of usefulness or else there will still be complaints about them.
---
This would mean that if you keep your rank low enough as survivor, you're not missing out on anything worth using but you're avoiding all the stuff that people hate, like ebony moris, infinite T3 Myers, one-shot hatchet huntresses and prayer bead spirits.
---
Other than that, what laivu6 says, add ons and items aren't everything. A 1000+ hour survivor doesn't need an odd bulb to bully a new killer.
---
That actually mad men jump
---
So a few things,
---
1: Devour hope also doesn't tell you that you're exposed until someone gets hit.
---
2: if there's going to be a survivor totem counter, have it be tied to small game
---
I agree. I‚Äôm not a main of anything I play both roles and I‚Äôm a Solo Survivor. 
---
I think they should at least remove the MMS Buff I think that makes it a little too much as well. The problem I have with noed is most people that use it are just getting rewarded for playing bad. I like Myc and Dh because those actually have some skill and challenge to it while Noed requires you to be able to hit. 
---
But what makes me laugh is when a Billy uses it.
---
... nothing is perfect. This is something that can do very easily without spending too many resources...
---
Her movement speed while phasing is 176%without any add-ons.
---
Devour Hope is arguably more hard to use and Activate then Noed. Also once they figure out you have DH they‚Äôll scavenge for a lit totem asap if they haven‚Äôt found it yet.
---
Oh shit yeah. Except they get out on a different kind of hook
---
Just stand over the body for like a second, they'll flock to you and you either get a free hit on them or you get your pickup
---
That's why I added the part where I suggested item rarities would have to be reworked in order to balance this.
---
Kek, I love that. It‚Äôs a funny idea
---
Oh god this is my mood whenever i think of playing killer
---
Their lack of self awareness can be incredible. I was accused of tunneling yesterday. Nevermind the fact that the person I "tunnelled" was nowhere near my radar until they missed a self-care skill check. But their brain somehow erased that part from memory.
---
I know what you mean. When they reworked Deja Vu I gave it a go and quickly realised how often people just didn't give a shit about how grouped gens would be, so I just became this tactical generator splitter upper in order to open the map up for us
---
If you want to protect totems you run a perk to protect them. If you want to destroy totems you should run a perk to help you with that.
---
Ahah true that, nothing sweeter that smacking an experienced looper.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox so no GG for us :(
---
They stacks but most of her add-ons are huge shit. She needs a rework
---
Oh. Really? Why? I thought they used to have a law about having as many Girls as they want but only one son?
---
Survivors on this post: Play an s tier!
---
Survivors on other posts: Red ranks suck! Nothing but Billy, Nurse and prayer beads spirit.
---
Spirit &lt; Nurse &lt; Spirit with addons &lt; Nurse with addons
---
At least with a brown med-kit you can heal yourself one state, a brown toolbox on the other hand‚Ä¶ it takes more time to open the chest and grab the toolbox than the time you will save using it.
---
Broken keys should be completely removed from chests.
---
Deep wound is meant to make survivors lose time not to down them, like RBT
---
Please do üòÇüòÇ
---
Thank you :)
---
I didn't think so, wanker
---
You did an amazing job on your street cat design, it clearly shows how much thought and time you pit into it &lt;3
---
Those cakes are a death sentence. I would be worried if I were you.
---
Global totem counter would be a no in my opinion unless they give Thrill of the hunt a buff and make totems take longer to cleanse (with or without Thrill).
---
Having the exposed status revealed would make sense but devour hope also functions the same way so they'd probably end up having to change that too for the sake of consistency.
---
\*oinks in pleasure\*
---
Thanks for that, I will be sure to put my mark on it :)

HOLY SHIT GAMER GI3L!
---
Tell your girlfriend I said this:
---
'Holy hell youre an amazing artist"
---
lol these are just really damn good
---
Holy fuck
---
Honestly its not a bad build. I hear this "good survivors can hit skill checks" but tbh some of them honestly can't. I see so many times rank 1-4 survivors failing ruins or overcharge non-stop. Where the build really works is if they stay injured they are slowed slightly and you got ruin as well. If they go back to a gen Surveilance can really help. Overcharge though is a niche perk. Could be replaced with another but its not bad. I hear this "skillcheck" stuff so much but as a killer main who has been to rank 1 for it and survivor rank 1 so many times...Its kinda bs. Way to many survivors can't even hit a hex on a gen I am working on at rank 1 or 4. Yeah there are those good survivors out there but there isn't as many as people believe. But its easy to remember those few "hard games" where survivors hit every hex skill check than the many that don't for some reason.
---
im doing this when i get home
---
Again, I do go for the unhooker, but you do have to keep in mind not everyone runs d-strike. Since the rework I have seen a lot less of it. Slugging the unhooked isn‚Äôt really something I do if I do down them because they‚Äôre either on death hook or dead.
---
haha he do the reverso thing get it the joke is it should be backwards
---
Boy, he was pis- he was mad!
---
The first time I played the game was with a friend in SWF, who also had never played it before. We had just gotten it, and started playing with no plan one night. We knew there would be a 'Killer', that's about it.
---
So we're standing there in the woods, and all of a sudden I spot a fucking horrible looking, Heath-Ledger-Joker kind of dirty Clown face in the distance, COMING AT US WITH A SPEED- That shit scared all life out of me, I let go the shrillest Hollywood scream you can imagine, and just BOLTED OFF
---
All I got back through the headset was her laughing her ass off about me for the next 10 minutes. It was brilliant.
---
You've learned something few have, there are no sides and assholes either play the game or dont, if they do they are either  survivor or killer, but they are still assholes.
---
The build however, doesnt matter, no build is toxic on its face, it can only be toxic if it coincides with their toxic playstyle.
---
and at one point you don't really care anymore about BP.
---
I've 3 survivor with all the perks with 2 of them being P3. 
---
I've Spirit P3 too with all the perks‚Ä¶
---
i don't need to have a lot of BP each games. So i'd need a really good reason to not just gen rush and unhook.
---
Talk shit back! Shit talking is half of videogames. Tell him he's trash and can't rank up. Call him a sore winner for bragging about beating rank 15 plus. Don't let it bother you. Say things like, if you are rank 15 with that build you must be brain dead. You know, stuff like that. Gotta have some thick skin in this kind of Game, and don't get me wrong, I know it can add up, or just feel annoying, but you gotta talk shit back. Even if you just put ahahhah after everything he says, it's like you don't care, that'll get to him more :)
---
Are you good?
---
"OP Builds" *Runs Adrenaline, Dead hard, and Self-Care, also DCs.*
---
Shame on you.
---
I only play as a survivor and I actually quite like NOED. Not when I'm the first to get hit with it obviously but otherwise it makes the end game more tense. I usually try to cleanse all totems anyway but if not, when there's a survivor hooked and you've got to find the NOED totem and unhook them in time whilst avoiding the killer.
---
On the edge of my seat, love that shit.
---
NOED is a perk that allows a killer to instantly bring a Survivor from the Healthy state to the Dying state with just their normal attack (M1/L2) once all Generators are powered. It causes all Survivors to be in the Exposed effect until a Hex Totem is cleansed. It can be any of the 5 Dull Totems that spawn on the map.
---
you got the source brother?
---
I saw this for the first time last night (PS4)
---
there is this map with only small trees everywhere and nothing in a large part of the center with some Walls at each corners. It's horrible as survivor
---
Oh that sounds kinda broken but amazing as a killer so what's its actual name? So I know to look for it :)
---
Yeah, and that's why i can almost never believe somebody when they say they never DC
---
My point is this guy with every character at Prestige 3 &amp; meta perks has been purposefully deranking to stomp new players and trash talk them.
---
Literally not the point here.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm an agent of chaos‚Äù *Begins to plant bear traps in each corner of the map to counter immersed Claudettes*

---
I'm still a complete baby at survivor though

Thank you so much its gonna help heaps :)
---
imagine making a drawing way better than the actual killer
---
great job!
---
Altruism 100
---
Thx
---
I also use it as a safety net when I‚Äôm using bloody party streamers or survivor pudding, just in case I have a bad game or get gen rushed.
---
I wouldn't mind a Thrill Buff being a bit of a longer Totem Cleanse time. Would give the perk some use besides just BP farming.
---
That's true, I forgot Devour Hope even existed while writting my original post. I don't see it very often in use, since it has the curse of breaking the first two seconds of a match starting.
---
Can you tell me how? That sounds rly useful. The salt that people have in end game chat. At this point I just leave right away unless they used a BPS, in which case I thank them first.
---
How was bt nerfed? Also the pipping system affects killers too, they have to do a ton of different things. For example, once I was playing trapper and I got a bronze chaser because people stepped in my traps in chases.
---
Not putting a time limit on DS makes it old DS but with the ‚Äúrequirement‚Äù you‚Äôre hooked once. Collapse was a mixed bag, on one hand, collapse forces survivors out and makes perks like blood warden a lot more powerful. But it also opens hatch no matter the generator count and when the hatch is closed, it powers the gates.
---
Killers aren‚Äôt intended to get those bullshit hits at windows, IIRC it‚Äôs hitboxes getting detached from the survivor sprite in a window animation and going slower, or being further behind or something. Which causes killers to get hits on the tip of their weapon on a survivor that was further away.
---
The whole ‚Äúkillers whine about everything‚Äù is just caused by the us vs them mentality in this game. I‚Äôm gonna assume you‚Äôre a survivor main, so what seems like a good perk or mechanic to you, is a huge annoyance to killers, and vice versa. So, naturally, when survivors complain about something, you agree, and it‚Äôs a protest. When killers complain about something they think is unfair, for killer mains it‚Äôs a protest, and for survivor mains it‚Äôs complaining.
---
Also, slugging any survivor that got off hook ‚Äúin case‚Äù they have ds wastes a lot of time.
---
Where did you find her? Can I also get one like that?
---
Then I treat them as SWF. And a useful thing is to use ctrl+F to find names on the friends list.
---
Tbh predicting NOED generally isn't an issue for me. I generally play around Rank 10, and almost everyone at that rank runs NOED. That, mixed with the usual 'All Trappers and Bubbas Run NOED' and I usually don't have an issue. My real problem usually just comes in from playing solo, breaking all totems I see and still getting hit with NOED. Maybe it's just because I've been spoiled from playing 3 man SWF. I'm not gonna act like I'm an amazing player or anything, and I'm sure there's a lot more I can do to improve, but you can also only do so much when you're the only one cleansing totems too. I figured that's where the counter would help with Survivors- I usually find myself more inclined to cleanse totems if I know my teammates are going to do it as well. (Such as, if I see a teammate cleansing a totem at the start of the game.) So I figured others might feel the same- if a bunch of solos are playing together and one person starts bringing down the totem counter, might encourage the rest to follow suite. (But not force it either.)
---
Yeah for Xbox it‚Äôs bad. I let it sit for a couple of minutes and as soon as the lobby was made I had survivors. Seems like they‚Äôre messing with matchmaking again.
---
The law was only 1 child.
---
Same. Rank 15 for life

Upvoted for love is war
---
Pig or meyers. They have a lot of character recognition and even from the start and were just always a ton of fun to play. Then daddy meyers became  huge thing and people loved him more. More and more meyers memes like the moonwalking and such just made him huge. The pig was always praised for being a cool killer with a unique power, and then exploded in popularity when they announced the game's first ever licensed skins. Then again, when she got her huge nerfs. So pig and meyers are by far the game's two most popular killers
---
Yeah i got gen rushed hard but got lucky cause i run discordance. Let me know what their secret offerings were(vigos shroud and shroud of union) and gave me the info i needed to keep them from getting the last gen. Got a nice little 4k with 2-3 gold and an iridescent(can‚Äôt remember if the gen badge was gold or not).
---
Some people are fucking sick in their head.
---
yup "8 killers that can (instert powers here" makes it sound like all of those 8 killers can do it. not to mention "can **placed** traps" and also wtf does "cloaked itself mean"
---
It really isn't sarcastic and I still stand by my stance. Im new as well so maybe I am misinformed, but you could of had some bad experiences. As a fellow gamer, you must be aware that depending on the gaming communities, there is a scale of how toxic that community tends to be. Say I am wrong and lets pretend the whole DBD fanbase is super toxic, well at least the ones on the subreddit are nice if anything :)
---
Looping is still a skill set as not everyone gets it right without practice, plus technically the killer still has a chance at killing the survivor. However, as far as I'm aware, standing by the hook as the killer doesn't take a whole lot of practice and doesn't provide any sort of chance for the survivors to rescue their teamate. By not camping, you are trying to create a more fun gaming environment which in my book = nice. Fortunately, camping is less seen at higher ranks (based on footage I have watched) because it isn't that practical to begin with. For example, yeah spamming in Street Fighter is going to work against other beginners, but in the end, no one is going to want to play with you anymore and is going to cease being a "good technique" by time you go against someone that actually knows what they are doing. So, I will have to agree to disagree with you on this one.
---
Tl;dr Dafaq you should have read my comment. Oh well, as a new player maybe give the community a little more of a chance :)
---
No, the one child policy was one child only. But because of sexism, males had an advantage. This lead to a significant decrease in the female Chinese population, which led to a reduced population overall due to the gender difference. This in turn led China to repeal the OCP.

My education is finally paying off. I love having useless information.

A good rule of thumb is that unless add Ons specifically say they DON‚ÄôT stack, they‚Äôll usually stack

---
Playing killer is so much stressful and hard
---
There is always 5
---
Nurse and Hag shouldn‚Äôt be in this picture.
---
Hey, us Billy mains have it hard as well. Most of us refuse to use our mallet when we have a chance of chainsawing.
---
I think it‚Äôs because people like playing killer? That and I find it easier and more fun to get bloodpoints as killer.
---
3000 bloodpoints
---
Spirit, in my opinion, is very fun to play. She requires a bit of skill, but she can be very rewarding. One thing you will love with her is the mind games you can play. Simply standing still and tricking survivors into thinking you‚Äôre phase walking will have them literally walk right into you, grabbing them off gens and pallets are so satisfying.
---
Sometimes its flipped others its not
---
Had 2 games in a row they went like this:
---
Instacharge billy finds me in first 2 seconds 
---
Silent spirit does the same thing
---
Lagswitch hag
---
10 lobby dodges
---
Alt-f4
---
you won't get banned, and I get the struggle, its hard knowing you could camp one and confirm it, but honestly I do what I can to keep playing normally, Id rather let them leave than camp
---
No. Killers lose way more than that from a DC.
---
Literally me
---
I remember when I was at the time when this game seemed so magical
---
Is the background kaguya sama?
---
Same here, I can feel it in my throat after a few chainsaw misses, b/c I know that if I don't down the little shit soon I've lost the game because there are too many gens done for the hooks I got
---
Fucking Meg's I swear to God. üòÇ
---
Don't worry, I'm usually just a meme-y survivor who's nice to killers. I'll always give good killers props if they make good plays or it's well deserved. But people like the killer OP went against are what make me want to die and will generally just result in a little bit of bitching in post game chat or maybe a quick rant to my cats.
---
So true üòÇ gotta say, I do have to prepare myself to be a killer. As a survivor I just go game after game without question, but I have to take a break inbetween killer games even if I'm playing well.
---
Makes you wonder how evolve died and this didnt
---
Way less stressful (and better)
---
Bp shouldn't enter in consideration while balancing.
---
Balancing is about pipping, escaping, killing. To escape you need ways to lose the killer or to make chases last longer, to unhook safely, to repair gens. To kill you need to have ways to make chases shorter, to spot survivors and to slow down the time to fixe gens. That's the only things that can be adjusted to fix the balance.
---
I only play as survivor:
---
Nea
---
Balanced landing, iron will, urban evasion and self care
---
i play as Ace, i have a pink sweater, magenta pants and glasses on him, he looks absolutely amazing and he is indeed Pink God
---
Shelter Woods. Has the lowest survival rate in the game, and is actually one of the biggest maps, it's just that about 80% of it is empty space in the middle.
---
There's so few safe spots on that nap that you semi regularly get double pallet jungle gyms, JUST BECAUSE they need do that to ensure there's the minimum number available.
---
Well you forgot the effing plane noises he makes while walking on stealth. Those are quite loud.
---
im in this photo and i dont like it
---
I try and do a bit of both! I've been playing Jane a lot lately, and I really like the skin with the jeans and the striped top, but that's also such a bright color and easy to see on most maps, so I got her red striped dress because it's also cute, but blends in a bit more!
---
After reading these comments, I have determined what makes Killer so hard for the killer mains like me, and the same for survivors; which I couldn't even fathom that they felt the same way.
---
The stress is from a need to 4K/escape, or to have fun. If the stressed player starts playing for fun and not caring about kills/escapes, then the game becomes more fun for them, so I'll give that a go, but it'll be hard to shake the sweaty mentally that I have for killer. As soon as I start I typically have to be chainsawing from gen to gen, if I find one worked on then I have to down the survivor and quickly. So yeah, I think that playing to have fun is the way to enjoy the game. Instead of playing to win.
---
Don't be put off at the start because you will probably find when you play survivor the killer feels OP and as Killer you just can't find people. Like others have said the game does have a steep learning curve but once you get used to the mechanics it becomes very fun.   
---
Survivors can be thought of as just skins. It doesn't matter really which one you play, however some of them are harder for the killer to see in certain clothes, the only thing that matters with them is their perks. Since the perks can be unlocked by level 40 on a character your best bet is to focus on someone whose perks you like or think will be useful, I recommend either Claudette, Nea or Meg. Claudette is usually a good starting point as she is one of the characters who can hide well and she has a self healing perk which will help keep you alive and give you more practice with skill checks.   
---
Killer is different because each killer has their own unique power and that often means a unique way to play them. Advice with killer is to just play someone you find fun and get used to how they work, you won't kill people every time but their is more to learn with a killer so that shouldn't be expected. Again killers have 3 perks that will all be unlocked when you get that character to level 40.   
---
My biggest piece of advice is to play both sides. In this game and in its community their is an issue with toxicity and often it comes from people only playing one side If you play both not only do you then understand what each side has to do but you will learn better ways to win, example being if you play survivor you learn how and where to hide but this means when you play killer you will know where a survivor could be hiding. This game can be tough at first but if you persevere it is very fun, also if you get a friend into it you can play SWF (survive with friends) and that can be very fun plus help you survive more at low ranks.
---
I main Dwight since I like the look of the blue slim jeans, red l4d shirt and red cap( replaced with Dweard when I'll get it) and Billy because I play against a lot of very good players and I want to have a chance against them without playing nurse+ I feel like he has a quite high skill cap and is fun to play as well.
---
one can only hope
---
It‚Äôs just at higher ranks you‚Äôre having less fun than in the lower areas. Mild coordination of survivor time will end a game in a few minutes and in the green/low purple area you can make a few mistakes and still enjoy the game. 
---
Meanwhile in sub R5, lose one mindgame or respect one pallet too long and there goes the next two generators and the other people will BM you for the rest of the game.
---
especially with the amount of 'second chance' perks available to survivors. pretty much every game ive come across lately is decisive strike, mettle of man, self care, and borrowed time/deliverance.
---
Killer mains: "Killers should be stronger than an uncoordinated survivor group, because that's what the game is about!"
---
Survivors : *Is coordinated*
---
Killer mains: "Fucking survivors so OP"
---
I'm curious how a universal totem counter would be considered strong? I mean, I kind of get it, but survivors know when a Hex totem is broken already. Plus, I would like to think that the 5 totems per map thing is pretty common knowledge... I would definitely be against a totem counter as well if the number fluxuated.
---
Still, I would be alright with only one thing being implemented. At this point, any change is a good change, and I don't think the perk needs a direct nerf, so just figured these might be two decent alternatives.
---
I hear good things about Billie. Im weird though and prefer playing females so that makes me avoid Billie. Ironically I do like Detective Tapp, but that is only because I love the Saw movies and am an aspiring police officer.
---
Honestly I hope we learn more about the Blight. Those flowers were super cool and I THINK might be able to hinder the Entity in some capacity. Also...
---
Pustula Plague with orange vomit please
---
She has badass perks, I could never get over her design though. Im glad you like her :D
---
No, I don't fear being Make your choice'd because I don't fear being injured
---
why would I fear a basic hit?
---
She's the second best killer in the game and she's way more fun to play than Nurse :) My fav killer btw :D
---
DESTRUCTION: 100
---
Killers aren't the only ones affected by DCs bud. And Killers DC too.
---
but what about Haunted Ground
---
I've only played legion (a decent amount) because i just love them haven't used survivors yet but my main would be ash since I've been a huge fan of evil dead
---
I'm a Claudette main! I like her stealthy immersion, and that she's the resident healer. When I play her with solos, I run botany knowledge, empathy, adrenaline and borrow time. When I play her with SWFs I run adrenaline, urban evasion, prove thyself and resilience.
---
Pig is my killer main. She may not be top tier Billy or Nurse status, but she is DEADLY. she has some weaknesses, but they're adjustable with the right perks. I play her because she's fun. She frustrated the hell out of me as a survivor, so I bought her DLC to better learn her. I think thats the most effective way to counter a killer, is understand how they function. Then I was obsessed. She's what brought the game back to life for me. I was tired of chainsaw sprinting around the map as Billy and needed something fresh. Pig was that refresher.
---
I run Nurses Calling, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Enduring and Surveillance on her. Sometimes if I want BPs I replace Enduring with B&amp;C.
---
Billy is overrated
---
Seeing as Pig mains are the loveliest people you can encounter, Amanda should be seeing an easy win on *that* question.
---
Or instead of mindgaming you just follow audio cues :)
---
I change between pink and Green Hair  Nea. Cureently playing a lot of blue haired feng. I dont like to blend in tbh
---
I would of put Trapper in over the Clown. SlimerCream has a point that a good clown is one of the best anti-loopers in the game and also wouldn't be just an m1 killer as they know how and when to use their bottles.  
---
Also if your going to main the Plague a good set of add-ons to use are the ones that speed up the infection time. I know a lot of survivors think the best way to play is not to cleanse but other than the fact your then 1 shot they seem to forget you are loud and you have noxious gas oozing off you which makes it a lot easier to locate people. If you use the ultra rare add-on that means you see an aura every time they puke then it really breaks this way of countering the plague, I think its the ashes.
---
Now hit that skillcheck with your feet.
---
Beanpole!
---
I would relate but sadly I‚Äôm the top ;(
---
Oinks Queen, the Pig :) I love her. Even you loose those stun sounds are S tier.
---
And survivors do too. If a survivor DCs straight away the game is more or less lost unless the killer is awful.
---
Read comments
---
Yeah man when I was a kid I watched evil dead and army of darkness countless times and I just recently started playing but for some reason legion really stands out to me once I saw them read their back story and what they look like I kind of connected with them
---
All movie characters are licensed and can't be unlocked through playtime. Devs said that they're trying to change that, but I'd say that's very unlikely to happen.
---
For me it's only "Is my internet good rn?"
---
Throw on enduring (and spirit fury), eat pallets, and don't mindgame yourself. Killer is pretty damn easy in 99% of your matches these days.
---
I've had good and bad experiences so I'm not saying it's "super toxic", but it's certainly more toxic than not, i.e. A typical and unremarkable and ordinary online gamer community. 
---
What you say about camping skill vs effectiveness by rank is true but misses the mark. If it works, it works. If it doesn't, it doesn't. At high ranks people don't do it, not because it's nicer, it's because they know that camp time is free time to work on gens. A risky move that isn't punished isn't a bad move. If I'm the killer and I see you moving to the hook what do you expect me to do? Play dumb? People who play this game, you can call it a "community" if you want to, will call anything less than immediate departure to the other side of the map "camping". 
---
The killer is not obligated, incentivized, nor "supposed" to work with survivors to make it fun for everyone any more than survivors are supposed to care about making it fun for the killer by not running too fast, not helping each other too much, not utilize infinite juke spots, etc.
---
I know what you mean about trying to make a more fun environment but playing a soft hearted killer is not the way, despite the community's invention of terms like face camping and tunneling. If these are bad strats they should be punished in game with counter play, not mean words in the post match lobby. But guess which one people do?
---
forgot abt that. well nvm. but can i get his "barbecue and chili" perk atleast?
---
Too bad
---
I agree(for the toptier killers at least)
---
The balance of the game itself is actually not that bad. There are some maps which are very annoying to deal with as a killer.
---
What I think is the biggest thing, is that they should find a way to "replace" ruin with an ingame mechanic. Like people suggested many times, something like a gear you have to find and put in the gen and before you cant start working on it. The gears dont need to be hard to find, but they have to be found. (I really like the idea of it, its simple and shouldnt be that hard to add to the game codewise, so I would really love to see that bevaviour atleast would try it out on the ptb. doesnt need pretty models for that. And if it works well, theres a lot of potential improvement from that simple system)
---
Having an ingame totem counter, so survivors(and killers) actually know how many are left ingame.
---
Making sabotaging useful again.
---
These would all be things that would add more objectives to the survivors and give some breathing room for killers.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm trying her out right now and I‚Äôm wearing all brown clothing. It‚Äôs working sometimes
---
The only part that could be more stressful as a survivor is that you have to rely on your teammates, and every time I get hooked and see three people crouched in various corners I get closer to a coronary.
---
A lot of BPs and not having to play in red ranks? Sign me up!
---
These are licensed characters and the can only bought using auric cells or actual money which is annoying because leatherface especially has one of the most used perks bbq and chilly
---
It‚Äôs kinda obvious people are lying or exaggerating to get the game whitch I‚Äôm not that surprised at me I would be grateful and play the game nothing more don‚Äôt mean to be bossy but please PLEASE do not give it away to someone who is obviously exxagerating
---
To be fair, I completely forgot about doing that, I'll be doing It for future photoshoots, thank you for reminding me!
---
I actually want that perk.
---
they already known some nerf at this time

Really? After around 5/6pm UK is when the queue times start getting good for me. I‚Äôll find games instantly as a killer then and as a survivor it only takes a minute or 2.
---
If I play during the day I‚Äôll queue for 5minutes as a survivor sometimes. And killer games take a couple of minutes.
---
Well I found that pustula is a disease that infects plants so maybe it can also infect the entity that would be interesting
---
Yes, it will eventually be in the shrine of secrets.
---
Well, I don't disagree with that.
---
Down someone before the first or 2nd gen pops, be at least halfway through a chase before hooked guy gets rescued.
---
Don't guard hooks, don't bother kicking gens unless you know 100% no one is nearby, don't mindgame yourself at safe pallets; make the pallet drop as soon as possible. DON'T respect the pallet; take the hit while swinging, there's a 50% chance you damage the other person.
---
Killer is less about thinking and more about downing people, fast. If you NEED the 4k for whatever reason, you can incorporate map control/ slugging to lay on the pressure. But it's absolutely not necessary anymore since killer has been made much much easier.
---
Kool ;)
---
Imagine thinking that Ghostface doesn't need buffs
---
Wow actually pretty good deserves way more upvotes
---
There's always five. And destroying totems isn't the issue- the issue comes from playing solo survivor and being the only one cleansing totems. I don't think NOED needs a Nerf. It's not impossible to counter, and it's not like it's a broken perk. But something like either the universal totem counter (Where Survivors would be aware if their team was breaking totems as well, while not forcing them to do it) or the exposed going off as soon as the final gen is powered (Letting Survivors know they should probably play it safe.)
---
&gt; but can i get his "barbecue and chili" perk atleast?
---
You can wait for it to appear in the Shrine. But that could be a very long wait. I'd say wait for the next sale and buy DLC
---
Dweard. Too OP
---
Aight
---
oh god meg got shadow buffed
---
you're better off buying him and leveling him up, BBQ has been on the shrine exactly twice since release.
---
For me it's precisely the other way around: playing killer is snooze-mode, whereas survivor is a terrifying panic-at-terror-radius I-can't-think-oh-god-jesus-fuck stressfest
---
You're not my real dad, you can't tell me what to do
---
*bubba noises*
---
well thanks to OPs very informative post he didnt specify it was a bug, and it took him 3 whole hours to explain it, when someone asked it, despite the fact that he couldve jsut explained it in the post or instantly posted a comment explaining it.
---
It's the difference between knowing and guessing, if you find cleansed totems, you cane hope they're all done, with a counter, you *know* you're safe. One for the killer would be handy though...
---
You cant estimate 60 seconds? Are you disabled?
---
Idk maybe its breaking them again for next trial Haha I have no idea
---
Feng with blue pigtails and mask, turqoise jacket and default pants (but the one recolored to blue). It feels like the clothes were made together and fit really good, also you look pretty.
---
So people can tell that they are unusable from a distance if they were unaware of endgames mechanics?
---
where did you pay 30$ for that game?
---
Not on console.
---
Everyone! To the lockers! ü§£
---
Nurses new weapon the coat hanger confirmed?
---
It‚Äôs not the gg, I‚Äôm on Xbox so just receiving a unimportant message from someone I don‚Äôt know seems just unnecessary
---
Why does gassy boi never get played, I main him
---
Okay that's enough Reddit for today.
---
(Leatherface oinks when he uses his chainsaw)
---
I believe they are permanent and will come out when Ghostface releases as in the Q&amp;A they wanted to fix how the hairstyles looked
---
gg man
---
I see so many pig mains here on reddit but never see 1 in game
---
Cmon I think leather face deserves to be a bit higher he was the original oinking serial killer
---
That‚Äôs a bit extreme lol üòÇ
---
Gg wp
---
They shouldn‚Äôt even have a ranking system imo this game is a super casual type. It‚Äôs not really meant to be competitive.
---
Saw the blindest one in game, or maybe that was just the corn vision.
---
Mine was Myers, so I was terrified.
---
I find that ppl who ask that question or disabled themselves and prob survivor mains.
---
The problem is i can go chase someone else and then comeback, down the guy that was unhooked and get hit by DS. Kinda sucks to get hit with anti tunnel perk when you dont tunnel.
---
Or you could just join us doctor mains and have a fun time just shocking people. Don't care if you win or lose, just have some fun.
---
exactly
---
No. I'd rather them just remove ebony mori's from the game and make the ivory ones ultra rare. Because making them on death hook is pointless. That would be like making instant heal medkits only work after being hooked twice. Or you can only use brand new part on the last generator.
---
I'm being the bigger man and ending this now.
---
Just like yesterday when a Claudette and I were fast vaulting by the exit gate to let the Freddy know what we‚Äôre doing. Claudette escaped and then I got to find out that Freddy had blood warden and NOED... Freddy had just hooked a survivor. üòé
---
Pre-‚Äúnerf‚Äù DS, I‚Äôve never missed it since the change, the skill check is really big rn
---
This is a you problem not a problem with the perk. Don't tunnel. Decisive Strike and Borrowed Time both are popular perks that will punish you for tunneling the person off the hook. If you still choose to go for them, that's your fault. It's not toxic at all.
---
For each hook state they didn‚Äôt endure that‚Äôs how much BP you should get
---
No, she should be on a gen
---
It's the message the killer gets when they depip.
---
r/punny
---
Why would one randomly depip?
---
SPEED HACKER ALERT! CODE RED OR SHOULD I SAY CODE MEG
---
Really? I‚Äôd rather have some survivor pudding if I were you. 
---
But anyways, that‚Äôs awesome!
---
And from that day on, everyone played nurse.
---
You also gotta mentally prepare for the possibility of a 20 min wait time.
---
I feel attacked
---
Killers depip based on performance. Similar to Surviviors. If you don't get enough points to pip, you'll get an "entity displeased" message. Usually it happens if you let 3-4 Surviviors Escape, camp a hook too long, not down any Surviviors until the gens are done, 4 man Mori them. Etc.
---
Excuse me what?
---
When my wife first saw me playing this I told her I like to main the killer. As I began to hunt survivors she saw how ghastly and morbid it looks. ‚ÄúYou always pick the killer‚Äù she asked me looking a bit uncomfortably. I told her yes and didn‚Äôt think of it much more as I continued the match. 
---
I thought she had gone back to working on her Sims 2 family and didn‚Äôt realize she was still watching. About halfway through the match I heard her start egging me on and getting into it. 
---
When I asked what made her get start cheering me on seeing as she seemed to be weird about me wanting to slash people up and not so into playing survivor. ‚ÄúAre you kidding me, the four of them are more frightening than any horror movie killer. Look at that bitch chasing you with a flashlight‚Äù.
---
GODDAMN PAST TENSE REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I used to care SO MUCH about my rank but now I‚Äôm just like, sacrificing myself to the killer so my friends can escape.
---
How‚Äôs that fun? Playing doctor is so boring
---
but cant you? Its something kids learn in kindergarden
---
I am free from my chaines
---
yea, hence why I put him up there
---
That's fair. Seems like a lot of work for someone to send just a GG via Xbox message
---
This isn't a Survivior issue or a D strike issue. It's a you issue. Don't tunnel and suddenly it all stops becoming an issue
---
How do you not expect 4k's? The game nowadays just hands them out
---
Tried that on ToP last night. There were still 125 pallets left when they all escaped. Admittedly, I need to git gud, but man that map has a ton of pallets.
---
Back to the Future meme: "hey, I've seen this one"
---
This actually happened to me once. I got a 3k and like 8k in all areas other then sacrifice and still got a displeased entity.. (2 gens were left)
---
I think we found it people. No more tierlists this is the best already.

---
Spirit, because I love the jumpscare potential and I think her ability completely changes your playstyle, moreso for me than any other Killer I tried so far. Also, cute cosmetics!
---
Nea because I feel dead inside.
---
They do stack. But most of her addons are so shit anyway. BHVR needs to rework her addons but they don't show love to Pig.
---
If the survivor fucks up: He gets hit.  
---
If the killer fucks up: He loses the game.
---
Damn trapper at D tier? I actually really like his prestige cosmetic
---
Deliverance and instaheals dont really work together
---
That's why Dwights hide in their locker
---
&gt; It is IMPOSSIBLE to get a gate open before you're found unless your killer is an utter potato.
---
Read this again. Slowly, this time.
---
This is one of the things that confused me because there isn't anything wrong with Clown yet he's the least played
---
Leatherface switching cosmetics in the middle of the match
---
Just play nurse. She moves through walls for god sake
---
What kind of candy do you have?
---
Personally I like the jumpscare potential from playing against her
---
The only safe place that doesn't have a hook in it
---
I am a survivor main but I don‚Äôt understand the disproportions of bloodpoints between killer and survivor. 
---
I can hook a single survivor, do some light chasing and let everyone escape and make more bloodpoints than I can completing 3 gens getting a hooksave or two and escaping
---
Thanks for rhe advice
---
imagine lobbying up with 3 aces just to get berated with an endless stream of dad jokes
---
I want to say that I play this game every couple of months so I always get deranked to the 20s and have to restart. So I‚Äôm not saying this is skillful by any means, but it was truly baffling to see the game go so quickly and to sacrifice the survivors the way I did. 
---
The action truly starts at around the 2 minute mark for anyone wanting to skip.
---
This is like a match where every survivor has a purple flashlight.
---
I mean idk how to think about it, I won't expose myself but I will commit too if I need to
---
Being bullied a hole game is not funny for me I guess. Also playing a killer with a useless power doesnt feel very funny. I like the actual Freddy because even being weak, you actually use a power with an impact on the game. I mained doctor for almost 6 months and at high rank and the only power you have is an easy spot from survivor at the early game and some addons effects.
---
I play on pc and during the data collection I was between ranks 9-7
---
I am OP and I approve this message.
---
*S M A S H*
---
but she oinker, she is p i g
---
I play Legion, I started playing them when they released (abandoned huntress) and I learned how to play killer while playing as them. No matter who I start playing I will always be a legion fan at heart
---
It just looks like he has ketchup rubbed on his body. His weapon is meh the good thing is his mask. And yes I do have him p3 I just think it's really lacking
---
Not saying dumb teammates aren‚Äôt frustrating, but the stress levels between playing survivor and killer are night and day.
---
it also takes 5 hours to stalk survivors as ghostface
---
I would sell my souls to BHVR for Joker as a killer, even as a skin for the Clown.
---

I'll counter your QQ with my QQ. Seems fair to me:
---
  
---
\-Meanwhile in 2 out of 3 games my ruin still spawns next to a gen. (I got a lot of screenshots of this. All taken in the last month).  
---
\-I can't play 11 out of the 14 killers on red ranks without handicapping myself while a third of them require a lot of stress and lots of survivor mistakes to achieve good results.
---
\-I still don't get any bonus for facing SWFs, who heavily break the balance of the game.  
---
\-I get insulted for just playing the game. I rarely camp. If do, I do this against overly altruistic people who go for instant saves, hook dives and more.   
---
If I somehow manage to find the same guy twice people will insult me for tunneling.  
---
If I win I get insulted. If I lose I get taunted. I even got insulted for gifting the hatch.
---
You bring in BPSs and want me to farm with you? I don't? Well getting flamed by idiots again.  
---
I didnt 'respect the 4%"? Another round of people telling me to kill myself.  
---
\-MoM exists (Atleast it is getting nerfed).  
---
\-Survivors run sprint burst, self-care and whatever they need to win. But if I run Ruin, NOED, Whispers or Sloppy Butcher I am getting insulted for running 'Crutch Perks'.  
---
\-Survivors getting buffed for YEARS while killers sucked through the dark ages? Well, they reworked DS, removed some pallets, OP exhaust perks got the necessary nerf and now people like you pop up sounding like the devs are making it rain on killers with them nice buffs.
---
That's always hilarious to me. I often wonder if the survivor is sitting there thinking "wow I'm such a good looper :3" meanwhile most of the map is now devoid of pallets.
---
nice one crediting a ig page that steals memes from this subreddit.
---
I run kindred, and aftercare to expose them.
---
Yeah with bbq and chilli I can get like 40k+ per match as killer doing average but when I tryhard as a survivor I can't get half that
---
&gt; don't bother kicking gens unless you know 100% no one is nearby
---
Sometimes kicking a gen and then coming back to it to see if it's still sparking is how you can tell if anyone is nearby.
---
GG Git gud baby killer EZ
---
Tbf its the same image not the same meme
---
Dont forget that pig is smaller than other killers. Playing that shitty swamp map? Dont bother crouching
---
&gt; you have to rely on your teammates
---
Except you don't. If your teammates are eating shit just go prep for a hatch escape.
---
crouch to anti red circle
---
Gg
---
he's the chad of the group
---
dodge swf coz theyre toxic af never play against a swf EVER(well some of them arent but most of them r)  
---
use franklins then camp their items XD  
---
play trapper then trap the exit power and camp it( dont forget insidious lmao)
---
This is awesome, but you should've cropped the vid a little more, first part was unnecessary
---
i think the ‚Äúam i in a good mood‚Äù also fits just anyone playing a video game ever. i know i cant perform well as a survivor if i‚Äôm in a bad mood. lol
---
Ace main to confirm this is definitely what would happen.
---
It's the same joke
---
10/10 would get trapped in this tiny trap
---
Yeah I realized that after I posted it haha, but I also wanted to show complete start to finish, but definitely could‚Äôve cut out some of the loading screen so that‚Äôs my bad. Thank you though!
---
I understand what you were trying to accomplish but this is a huge mistake. 1. Any change that takes away what people have grinded on is gonna piss off the player base ( collecting good add-ons and items takes time) and the fact is that it's not the bad rank 20s that are good with these items. A purple flashlight means shit when it's run by a rank 20 that can't even loop shack correctly. Imagine how frustrated everyone would be if they kept spending 5k+ on green or better items to help them but they can't use them cause they aren't a high enough rank. Doesn't make sense to punish bad players and keep high tier players the same. (Rank 1 both sides every season)
---
random ‚â† funny
---
If you're having trouble finding people then you're already losing tbh
---
It's a rough match when there's even 20 seconds between chases
---
oh damm same! i was looking for this post, thank you. already reinstalled the game and it still does this, have to force kill it through task manager every time
---
Lol true. Anytime I buy a new killer I have to de pip to rank 10 and only slug to learn how to play them. Wish they would add a casual mode so I wouldn‚Äôt have to
---
:(
---
Ds wasnt good because of the stun. It was good because it was a second chance. The stun being reduced did not change the main, most impactful, effect
---
Dribbling only worked next to a hook. It was situational. And flashlight saves arent "random". Anyone with any aura reading perk can find you and take advantage of the killers animations.
---
If you killed two people, slugging the last was optimal anyway. But I dont want to have to ignore somebody the entire game waiting to plug one person.
---
Making something slightly (barely) more difficult is not a counter. By your logic, sprint burst counters noed because you move slightly forward.
---
I am a killer, but I play a lot of survivor with my friends who refuse to ever play killer. I'm a rank 5 survivor at the moment because of them.

Situations like this are why I don‚Äôt run NOED. I don‚Äôt need to rank up faster than my actual skill can support. I want to learn how to win before gates are powered and to deal with altruism trains without a one-shot. Yes, that means I‚Äôm getting more 0k and 1K games as I learn, but in the long run I feel like it will make me a better player. 
---
I don‚Äôt begrudge anyone running NOED. It‚Äôs a perk in the game. Run what you like. But I can‚Äôt help seeing it as a crutch or consolation prize for my own personal tastes.
---
escake cake
---
Think about it this way..
---
The killer has to play ALL game, where as survivors can be out in a few mins. The killer has to stop all gens getting done, manage 4 survivors and chase at the same time. Survivors have to either sits on gens, or loop the killer. There is more the killer has to do, and for a long period. 
---
From a player who plays both sides, I think its fair.
---
Awwww ty uwu
---
Careful, he's a hero.
---
Anyone feel like the female characters are shiftier when running and have a better chance of throwing the killer off?

The pallet

It happend to me as i instantly left the lobby to avoid the end game chat

I only run it on bubba which I rarely play, cause he's sort of weak as it is.

"You better have Borrowed Time, Meg."
---
*Doesn't have Borrowed Time*
---
*I get insta-downed*
---
*Looks at DS being active*
---
"Fine, I'll do it myself. "
---
-DS was OF COURSE good because of the stun. If there was 0 stun it would have been worthless since you would have been Auto downed.
---
-You could dribble from a very far distance from a hook.  A Killer could dribble a Survivor 3x and still hook them PLUS the Hooking Animation would override the DS if both were done at the same time .
---
-By random I meant Rare.  If you get Flashlight saved 1x for every 100 Hours+ you play, that is so rare to not even be worth mentioning.
---
-Every counter I listed makes DS Significantly less effective.  Even Rancor countered old Noed since you could just Mori them 1st time you caught them.  The amount of Significant Counters Old DS had was at least 10

Oh yeah after 10pm, where I am, for survivor its 10 + minutes to find a game. Killer is almost instant each time though
---
When I do it it's kinda like the opposite of tbagging. I'd only do it if you didn't play like scum
---
Omg...this is too perfect and amazing!!! I love your work!!!
---
Oh shit there is a killer, time to DC!
---
Well true but jesus christ, you'd think after playing as much as they did they'd at least know basic stuff like that.
---
Im new. Can somebody explain what swf means
---
Skill ceiling means how much it takes to master a killer. Nurse has a high skill floor but you can't learn many new things when you learn her basics.
---
I often kneel &amp; throw my head skyward at the foot of a hook after a farming sess. with a friendly killer as a show of good faith. I usually get a bucket ton of BP and/or double pips, so it's no sweat, imho, to give the killer a solid sacrifice. That being said, when a killer knocks me down unexpectedly during a farming run, I smile a bit &amp; chuckle at the move, as it plays on my expectations and I find that funny :)
---
The current reward is low, but the salt is priceless. DC = Ragequit, and ragequitting is worth more than any mori, hook, escape, etc.
---
if everyone hates noed so much then why does no one cleanse dull totems?
---
I would love to find out that they have been logging DC's and sometime soon they come out with a huge list of perma-bans for the overly regular drop outs. No warning, just gone .... That would be karma!
---
no she doesnt lol shes an a tier killer even better than huntress id put her after billy n nurse
---
I have this game installed but never played because I don't want anyone too derank because of me
---
survivors are supposed to have a hard time you know...surviving. As it is, it's just too easy for them.
---
I dont know what any of this is but im interested in learning more. Anybody wanna explain or give me a link please? Thanks :)
---
Wicked AF, rooting for this cosmetic!
---
you a break? what about a survivor who got unhooked 30 seconds ago???
---
There was a big road accident yesterday in my part of the world. 6 people died, 5 of them were the 3 children, a mother and wife of a man who survived, while they burned alive in the car they couldn't get out of. I feed bad for that man. He could most likely hear all of them scream. That's not to take away from the tragedy of the dude on Twitch whose Ruin got broken. I think with enough help from friends and family he, too, will be ok. In time.
---
Just more 100% of what you earned normally
---
i said gg, clicked "leave" and this shit just stops every time when i play killer.
---
Keep in mind that DbD is a time efficiency game. A race basicly. Learn to not waste time and with experience you will be getting better.
---
that was kinda your own fault tho tbh. Plez dont karma bomb me
---
Do you think he might need a buff?
---
after 1k hrs: run after the killer instead
---
Because whining about it is easier. They want an advantage not a counter-strategy.
---
I know they all have Mettle
---
Good to know that I am not the only one
---
They all just add up 100%more from base value wich means they stack not multiple
---
That's because they're just that sneaky.
---
so you finish with 300% exp, 100 base, 100 from event doubling it and 100 from bbq adding another stack of base exp?
---
Pretty much my opinion on noed; it's fine against swf, not fine against 4 randoms
---
&gt; A bad killer will get a the whole time it takes survivors to fix gens and escape (a solid 5-10 minutes) of gameplay to earn points.
---
&gt;fix gens and escape (a solid 5-10 minutes)
---
*cries in all gens done 5 minutes*
---
thanks for confirming what i just said then..the killer is punished for playing the game if they run back into the last hooked survivor and get the down...it has jackshit to do with intentional tunneling.
---
I would rather play killer, given the choice, but the stress of going against bullies hardly ever encourages me to play more than a match or two a day. I really hate how survivors will purposely deny you points and purposely wait until the last possible moment to leave, or purposely vault repeatedly so you get a headache. When I play survivor I never am so unkind or unfair. 
---
Survivor should be terrifying while killer is more or less the role you go to unwind. Not the other way around.
---
Unfortunately I go against a decent number of rank 16-20 killers, and i'm usually sitting at around rank 12-11 survivor since I play both sides and tons of other games, so I never get to rank very much :( 
---
I just feel bad when that happens, because when they get into chases it's clear they don't know what they're doing yet, and the game had no business throwing me at them, as well as other green ranks.
---
honestly feels like cheating. Pretty much always know were someone is. Alert is clutch too. I will touch every gen I pass so I know the killer is there when they stomp it. You Know theyll stomp it too haha.
---
The stun was necessary, but it was good because of the second chance. If it had a .5 second stun it still would have been good.
---
You could not dribble a very far distance because eventually the got out automatically even if you could, that would take an incredibly long time. 
---
It is worth mentioning. We have already established you dont play killer. Most good swf teams in high ranks have one- two people who flashlight save every time somebody goes down. They went that rare.
---
Okay, then noed has at least 10 counters right now. 
---
Adrenaline moves you slightly ahead.
---
Sprint burst moves you slightly ahead
---
Urban evasion let's you hide
---
Now I never argued that ds had no counters. But noed is easier to counter. That was the original argument.
---
That doesn't go far enough, we should establish a UBI of bloodpoints to make sure all survivors have enough perks and items to survive in this entity realm we call home
---
Pallets are waaaaay more inconsistent now, and in average lobbies you're always gonna get teammates who fucking waste them too early.
---
Windows stick around forever, but the devs continue to make them more fair and less "infiniteable"- which is great. Map balance is at the heart of this game's health.
---
But with unsafe windows and a killer who knows how to play, what in the holy fuck are survivors supposed to do with a killer chasing them and no pallets?
---
When people start playing, it's glorified hide and seek. But people *keep playing* because they enjoy the chases and team synergy when stringing together things like borrowed time/ DS/ flashlight saves.
---
Chases are inconsistent as hell, and the devs continuously nerf and remove synergy or second chance perks. They keep pushing the game back to hide and seek- and that shit is **really fucking boring** to play extensively. (Especially on killer. Good god I want to tear out my eyes when playing against an immersed team.)
---
Literally not the point lmao.
---
you dont get it....the whole purpose of the perk is to give you a Second Chance, just like adrenaline, deliverance, MoM.
---
Those perks (except mom) exist to keep the balance between a really good Killer and 4 survivors.
---
DeadbyDaylight is pretty balanced right now and as long as perks like that keep getting buffed/nerfed its pretty fair for both sides.
---
It's that good huh? I haven't bothered to farm for it because it seems like it would be hard to get the hook after the gates are open... the gates have to be open right? Or just powered?
---
I once went against a nurse who slugged right from the start, and was running Deerstalker and knock out. One of the lease enjoyable games i've ever played(worse than facecamping LF, cause at least you get some bp) and that's where slugging starts to turn into toxic territory for me.
---
killers need way more bloodpoints. survivors only need to level every survivor to rank 40 and can max out a single survivor and they're done. killers can't do that. they need to max out every single killer.
---
Was it Disturbed Ward or Father Campbell's Chapel?
---
It nearly killed me.... but the work is done..
---
Not really...its a fact..especially the way you reacted to it. As long as you know the truth, even if subliminally, that is all that matters :) If I am not obliged to pick up every survivor I down than no every survivor is obliged to escape alive...one of the reasons hatch closing exists now. Two sides of the street. The issue presented was simple. Being punished for running into that survivor again and downing them...what if they are all the same character or you simply forget which one it was that got unhooked recently. Like I said...once that person unhooked loses chase of killer (ESCAPES and IS NOT being TUNNELED) it shouldnt be transferred to them 50 secs later...it can easily be abused...unfortunately you dont understand that.
---
Correct :)
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm SO glad you all made it out alive! Makes my sacrifice worth it!‚Äù üí©
---
The claudette in the corn reflecting in his eyes is murdering me
---
Thank you! I'm glad you like it.
---
IMMERSED
---
I have about 80 hours in the game and got to rank 6 last season.  I noticed I was the weaker link in some of these games. I wouldn‚Äôt lead the killer to others but my situational awareness was my biggest issue. Understanding what perks the killer has and how I can counter them was the bigger picture. Also looping and practicing fake vaults etc
---
no, it isn't
---
Sweet also great flair lmao
---
That one of the corn maps? It's cancer as killer, but why would survivors hate it? I love corn maps as survivor, corn = easy escape.
---
the first match of the day is so painful sometimes, there's days when i just instantly regret making a lobby and just switch to survivor or even another game
---
Not always is there a Winner and Loser. If it ended with 2 Kills that is basically a Draw
---
**Survivor:** Jeff (I like his look and being a somewhat hefty, bearded guy myself I guess there's relatability)
---
\- Iron Will
---
\- Alert
---
\- We'll Make It
---
\- Distortion
---
**Killer:** Clown ( I like that his power is straightforward but can also be used strategically and with some thought. Also, his sounds, cosmetics, etc. are all great. Also, clowns.) 
---
\- Save the Best for Last
---
\- Discordance 
---
\- Brutal Strength (Probably going to replace this with Corrupt Intervention when I get it)
---
\- Monitor and Abuse
---
1 mil would be decent
---
100 billion won't break the game? I Mean I am alright with it
---
Plus full stack Huntress Lullaby and Ruin. Imagine the difficulty of the skill check.
---
All BP-modifiers are additive, BBQ + double BP is 300%
---
Flashlight saves are not "extremely rare" they happen all the time. Maybe uncommon, but not rare. And even if they were, we couldnt disregard them as a whole as they still happen.
---
Boi, you cant say "this perk make sit slightly harder so it's a counter" then turn that around when you dont like it. If unnerving presence counters dstrike, then sprint burst counters noed.
---
Noed has way more counters.
---
You can cleanse totems 
---
Use the hatch
---
Use literally any perk that shows totems
---
A map
---
Remember totem locations, cleanse later
---
Loop the killer (a bit difficult, but lots of locations can do it well)
---
And these are hard counters that completely shut It down. 
---
When i use to use it, most my kills were people waiting around after the gate opened. Dont hang around after the fate is open or you deserve it.
---
Prenerf dstrike had less counters. They weren't nearly as many and they were less effective.
---
Honestly, I was like you when I started playing.
---
But the more you play the more you see it's pointless being nice to everyone and you grow tired of toxicity on both sides. I still play faily and want everyone to have a good time, but I stopped caring. Once people who play with you let you down one too many times, something snaps. Either you turn into a selfish jerk or stop caring like me.
---
Friends can make it easier (if they don't suck too hard). It's easy to make friends in this game imo.
---
&gt;Yeah youre still only thinking about the killers side.
---
See:
---
&gt;The first baby steps you take *as a killer or survivor* are fun and chill 
---
I play both sides you reactionary dumb dumb. I used killer as an example because that's what was being discussed, but the post very clearly implies that this goes both ways. New players have a shit time in green ranks early on regardless of which side they play. I distinctly remember when I started facing insta-chainsaw Billies, BBQ&amp;Chili and Ruin every game. Not fun,
---
Proximity chat would horrid. The game is already toxic as is and voice comms would over do it.
---
I main the pig!  She was the first killer I went against when I first got the game and  and I‚Äôm a big fan of the saw series I‚Äôm almost at p3 50 on her but I‚Äôm trying to get everyone‚Äôs teachable perks  first. 
---
As a Survivor I main Dwight with spine chill premonition, sprintburst  and for my last slot I‚Äôll run adrenaline or leader depending who my team picks
---
This is exactly how I feel
---
The game considers downing the same person who had just been unhooked less than 1 minute ago to be tunneling.  This can be avoided by waiting 1 minute to go after them or at minimum 1 minute to pick them up
---
u cant have fun when ure getting tunnel n camp the whole game
---
Spine Chill has been a staple for me since day 1. For me, it is practically meta.
---
The advanced warning that the Killer is nearby is invaluable to me. Being able to "read" Spine Chill really give information on Killer activity.
---
Repeatedly flashing = Killer is nearby and possibly chasing someone else.
---
Not Flashing = Killer is headed right for you. Get off the Gen and hide.
---
I'm a simple man. I see survivor on a gen, I stab them.
---
Thanks it's good too see there are people who just want too have fun in the community I do really want too play this game but I've always been a solo player in all games so multiplayer is abit scary too me lol
---
Don‚Äôt you think that running back to the hook to stop the unhooked survivor from healing is kind of like tunnelling? In which case the perk is working as intended. Don‚Äôt run back to unhooked survivors and you won‚Äôt have to worry about DS.
---
I think it would be cool as a separate mode though, not a bad idea to spice things up ü§∑
---
Wait wut
---
If you don't slug them and then get DSd then that's more on you for not playing around it.
---
&gt;but you do have to keep in mind not everyone runs d-strike.
---
True, but playing around them potentially having a perk is a big part of this game. You hide in a locker in case they have bbq, you don't heal in the terror radius due to Nurse's, you wait for DH, etc.
---
This game definitely needs some spice/change, soon üò¨
---
Console got the hag and doc dlc eith the base game
---
Real life Pig=Real life upvote
---
I'm also pretty sure there's a marriage "drought" issue, where since there are less women to marry there, it's more competitive between the men.
---
They'd also have to update devour hope as that also doesn't notify survivors when they're exposed until someone gets hit.
---
According to my recent games, this applies to Doctor, Legion, Hag, Wraith, Myers, And even a LV 15 Trapper with no synergistic perks.
---
Did you join it?
---
Wow, pretty fragile minded...maybe killer isnt for you.
---
I mainly play as Kate or Nea. Typically I use Borrowed Time, Spine Chill, Adrenaline, and Balanced Landing. Dead Hard is probably the best exhaustion perk out there, but BL is more fun imo
---
Need this for Myers too (-:
---
Incredible job
---
Yeah just lose all the pressure with M1 killer EZ. Maybe i want to chase the person who saved, maybe there is noone else to chase besides them?
---
How about don't pick someone up after they've been unhooked for a minute? You know you can tell between the different survivors right? And I still don't see how that's toxic. I don't think that word means what you think it means if you're using it to describe a perk like Decisive Strike.
---
Not really. You have to work for devour hope stacks, it‚Äôs high risk high reward unlike noed.
---
I got two camping leatherface's in a row last night, first one got 3k cause my other teammates didn't seem to understand that it's not worth it, got the hatch on that one. Second one hooked me first and face camped me while my teammates did all 5 gens and escaped, it was worth the sacrifice and I'd do it again.
---
Ace, walking up to a dwight on the hook: "Are ya winnin son?"
---
&gt;The point of a mori is to speed things up.
---
Yeah and that makes it completely broken, being able to remove a player from the match without any real time investment (if you were to camp them till they die it'd take way more time) is completely unfair and breaks the asymetrical design of the game completely.
---
With the death hook change you get to enjoy the animation and get some extra points for your trouble, plus it saves you having to play around the DS/flashlights.
---
How would you feel if they added an offering that added hook states for the survivor, instead of having to hook them 3 times it's 5 times? Or an offering that guaranteed an escape from killer's grasp 2 times in the match?
---
Equaling it to an instaheal is ridiculous, styptic takes away 1 hit, syringe resets 1 chase. Mori removes 2 HOOKS.
---
No like I‚Äôm ok with getting every character prestige within the game but...is that really enough??
---
Well you rub it and then a miracle happens
---
The first thing I thought when I glanced at this was how realistic the leather texture was.
---
My favorite one recently was playing on Coldwind as Nurse. One survivor DC‚Äôs so I figure I‚Äôd play the game more casually by going for the unhookers. One Adam I down gets unhooked I blink back and follow the scratch marks to the top of a hill. Down in the cornfield by an exit gate is the god damn injured Adam, sitting there hoping I don‚Äôt notice. I looked at him for maybe 1 minute, kicked a gen close to him, and let him be because he was being a cute noob. I call that a killer power move right there.
---
I mean if all your dulls get cleansed then you've wasted a perk slot on NOED, it's just a case of most survivors not caring about totems that keeps it in a fairly powerful position.
---
Or they can just combine SWF and KYF, where one of their buddies can be the killer.
---
Ohh ok, didn't know you could do that lol.
---
A good step in the right direction for noed would be to force it to only activate if all gens are done, that way the killer can't just cheese a noed hit on the last survivor by closing the hatch.
---
I'm also an advocate for there being a new global noise similar to hex breaking for hex spawning so you know if noed pops up (also gives them the ability to add hexes in the future that don't start in play while also giving them this same balance)
---
I wonder if it's possible to remove the mask with some program and see what's under
---
Funny how at rank 20 the survs fear the killer and from rank 12 and up the killers fear the survs
---
People would just leave and abuse it tho because people are people
---
That'd be dumb cause they'd depip and derank.
---
I still don't get it why people almost instaDC after starting a game and going into Madness 1.. the doc is the most enjoyable killer to play and to play against because he's not exactly weak but he's not too strong either.
---
Uhhhh what?
---
I think they need to give away way more blood points. Grinding for perks I want, but never getting them and having to play through 2-3 survivor games just to finish a level is really not my idea of fun.  I think "Double Bloodpoints" should just be the standard amount of blood points given. Also since leveling up and unlocking takes years, I don't see why it'd hurt to be able to prestige characters faster. especially since it doesn't do anything.
---
You think swf care about ranks?? Rofl
---
Wasting the killer‚Äôs time is not toxic, it‚Äôs literally the only way survivors can escape the match. Waste the killer‚Äôs time and distract them until all gens are done. If nobody wasted the killer‚Äôs time then all survivors would just run in a straight line and never use pallets, then die on their first hook. Nobody would ever escape. 
---
And if you think it‚Äôs only SWF that body block for each other, you‚Äôre mistaken. Knowing when to (and when not to) take a hit for a team mate is a part of skilled solo play. 
---
But sure, keep kidding yourself that every time you lose it was because of toxic cheating SWF, that‚Äôs sure to help you get better.
---
Some anon on /asg/ recommended that I play it chill and just walk at people pressing M1 whenever necessary. Not worrying about target prioritization, just going after whatever falls in my line of sight first. The goal of the game isn't even to sacrifice people per se, as long as I hunt em and slap em the entity is pleased.
---
Playing with that mindset has made the game much more enjoyable for me.
---
The code just explodes??
---
Idk fam.. might need more
---
"I don't like that killer so i won't play" -Toxic claudettes, propably
---
no i think we need to have a little bit more just a little bit
---
Why do your comments in this thread, and the combination of "suggestions" you have, make me wonder that you've been ranking up, and can't compete with actually skilled Survivors all of a sudden... hmmm
---
They didn't *instantly* power a generator. You still had to perform the channeled action.
---
Im always playing Swf and I care about my rank. So do my friends.
---
r/boneappletea
---
Where is his cousin the crapper?
---
This.
---
All four survivors are at the hook and you can only find the one that just got unhooked? Seems like an unlikely enough scenario that it‚Äôs not worth complaining about.
---
All of my friends hate it because they get shit on. Not my fault they're bad. I had not played for a year but still won 5 out of 7 games as a survivor with no items on a new account last night. Its not hard if everyone actually does what they are supposed to.
---
Okay thats your group of friends
---
But the majority of swf dont care about ranks
---
They just care about having fun and winning, soo if they gonna die they can just dc and their friends get the hatch and even free bloodpoints
---
OINKITY OINK OINK OINK
---
I mean like 10% ownership of bhvr for each player, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really enough
---
It would be kinda redundant if Prestige let you keep your perks but I do think that Bloodwebs should be cheaper, not just if you Prestige but in general.
---
~~Also give me an option to refund offerings because what the fuck am I supposed to do with my 300 Smelly Inner Soles as Clown?~~
---
That's awesome! Great job!
---
just 1000?
---
None of my friends besides like two actually play games in general and the ones that do are all into shooter shit which I don‚Äôt really care for
---
Yeah i think every player remaining should get some plus and the removal of a required gen, the killer should receive a 1/4 of each emblem they‚Äôd lost out on due to the dc.
---
Listen here nerd
---
Door escape should be safety pip, that is. If you literally did nothing all game and the hatch spawns below you after you let your team die, you do not deserve a pip.
---
Yea it sucks that you‚Äôre right .... it seems like you can‚Äôt really do anything to reward survivors who stay during a dc without some people abusing it. 
---
Maybe it doesn‚Äôt earn you points but some sort of limited time speed boost (like a sprint burst but no exhaustion) or like it reveals teammates auras to each other for so many seconds to encourage the rest to stay. So you wouldn‚Äôt get extra points but you‚Äôd some help with match points?  Also it would only happen in the first dc.
---
Majority of the playerbase isn't in red ranks, hence why red rank queues are so garbage. For most of the season you play against the same people every few matches.
---
Most people hover around green ranks.
---
I had not played for a year until last night and about 50% of time if someone got hooked at the beginning of the game they DC'd immediately. Fucking sucks. Never happens to me because im not a shit tier player.... but even if it did I would not DC....
---
Thanks for the tip! Worked!
---
Usually there are two people around the hook person saving and the one saved, rescuer hides most of the time, you down the person that was saved after you already finished other chase, if you dont keep in my who you are downing you will get ds-ed. Punish for tunneling on purpose not for me doing well and downing someone within a minute for second time because they dont run and stay there.
---
Clown without the fatsuit.
---
Now take my money!
---
I had a friend of someone I was playing with say he hates the doctor because he hates killers with no counterplay. I'm like bruh...Just run in a circle
---
Yeah thats right, didn't think about it

---
Adrenalin ignores exhaustion because its adrenalin, literally it‚Äôs in the name thats what the perk was built on, and I don‚Äôt think it will change anytime soon.
---
Doctor has no counterplay? More like Doctor has Counterplay to your Counterplay but you can Counter it too.
---
So that the immersed claudette who was sitting in a corner the whole match without doing nothing can escape while who actually tried to escape and did the hard work dies? I don't think that's balanced. There are keys for that.
---
The reward for simply rehooking is higher than the risk imo
---
If they ds me, oh well. But if they don‚Äôt, they‚Äôre on death hook
---
Gates have to be open, none of them expect you to be running bloodwarden so they just teabag until its too late.
---
It's really quite decent vs players who expect you to be running Spirit fury. You can couple it with enduring, enduring alone is pretty underwhelming, you need to combine it with either Brutal or SF. Plus if you're against good survivors, you'll never get SF off anyway.
---
Nurse's is really good but you usually don't want to take it on killers that don't have a way of downing people fast. You can see them healing on Wraith, but you still have to down them &amp; get looped. Spirit, Huntress or Nurse on the other hand can get a hit in really easily.
---
A lot of us solo play this game. SWF is only a problem really for the killer to handle.
---
At most they'll leave you on the hook because they don't give a shit. Otherwise just have fun.
---
Nurse's Calling and Surveillence those 2 are for me
---
I rarely play noed because when I do it rarely gets used. But when this kind of situation happens its glorious.
---
\&gt;"They're are"  
---
Also, yeah, of course it's taking a while to fix it. Developing games ain't easy. I'm willing to bet we won't see Ghostface be properly fixed until he is officially released. Maybe shortly thereafter.
---
Best part of being the Hag is knowing that my traps terrify the survivors :3
---
if they run towards you and you already expect a DS, than auf would you Fall for it?
---
Thats not toxic, thats just dumb on your part
---
This is the most accurate representation of this game I have ever seen.
---
Bing the fuck bong motha fucka
---
He was in that locker from the 2 minute market up until I found him in there lol.
---
He truly is a ‚Äútrap‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm just hoping it comes out this week before the release
---
Judging from my red rank killer games, there is still a lot of potatoes in there.
---
*gag*
---
Bloodpoint economy
---
r/wooosh
---
And there‚Äôs Med kits too but that doesn‚Äôt stop self care from being a perk. 
---
Closing the hatch doesn‚Äôt stop someone from escaping, because you still have to camp both gates as a killer for that. If a Claudette that weaseled her way through the whole game and didn‚Äôt end up having her team message the killer to give her away ends up with a closed trap door, chances are it won‚Äôt stop her from getting out.
---
BING BONG WOOSH MADAFAKA
---
This is per category right?
---
Rank 15 ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The devs confirmed that the 80% was a mistake, if you survive and pip then it counts it as a rank 1 game, if you depip it dips to rank 2 and doesn't count the game as rank 1. Hence why the survival rate was drastically inflated.
---
The actual number was like 41% or something.
---
English, do you speak it?
---
\*sip\*
---
They don't do gens like they used to.
---
There are very few things more frustrating than successfully juking the killer, completing gens, unhooking and escaping... only for the killer to pull the plug *right as you cross the exit gate*.
---
Sorry fam, no survival points for you. Sometimes no points at all. The last killer who did this is the only DbD player whose Steam page I bothered visiting to call him out on being such a poor loser and spiteful egotist.
---
Killers need the BPs for add-ons they burn through every game.
---
Someone already posted Michael w/out his mask and it is horrifying. Its just black with the eyes there iirc
---
You mad? You cant play without survs either so whats your point lol. Complaining about dead hard and balance landing lol git good. You know dead hard can be countered by wait a sec after of being in reach of hitting them right? Imgkshd adrenaline but noed is ok? Insta heals dont phase my spirit. Only killers are allowed to have op add ons like insta hatchets, beads and moris though right?
---
The hypocrisy is embarrassing dude. The game was supposed to be balanced around 2king, not 4king with s tier killers every game. It's not hard to 2k consistently with most killers in solo. Again, at least killer mains get killers that guarentee winning every match. I don't have that as survivor. I'm at the mercy of my other 3 randos actually playing well in a ranking system that doesnt do its job. As killer you have nobody but yourself to worry about. If you're having a bad time as killer you're playing the wrong killer for you period. You have two perks that counter flashlights. There are multiple s tier killers. It's not like you only have nurse and Billy. Get. Gooooood. Killer mains have far better crutches than survivor.
---
&gt;I'd also like to see where you got that statistic.

---
No, but ‚Äújust cleanse dulls looooool‚Äù argument is stupid.
---
both of them
---
Couldn't have said it better, too bad you're getting downvoted.
---
I don't see it, causing people to dc might give you that small points bonus, but you're getting less unhooks and therefore less altruism, and way lower odds of surviving for what is usually one of the biggest chunks of points you get in a match.
---
I cycle through Jane‚Äôs outfits, but my favorite combo is her pony tail with a bow, her bloody pinstripe blazer, and her red skirt. I do also like switching out her p1 top for the blue shirt too. I think her dresses look better mix and matched than together.
---
Meh, like I care. Internet points is the last thing to worry about.
---
The fun thing is that a survivor sprint is 150% while Legion is only 125% after the rework.
---
I think after watching that movie is when the devs came up with the idea for dbd.
---
nah not rlly ive made it to rank 1 before its still full of campers   
---
and usually rlly sweaty people n streamers
---
You‚Äôd get more points overall from having a fourth teammate as opposed to getting stomped in a 3v1
---
Slugging begone
---
How? It's a solution to the problem. You cleanse the dull totems and the killer wastes a perk slot. 
---
I play survivor more than killer and I've lost track of how many times a killer has hit me after the final gen has been done expecting to get an instadown only for me to carry on running, realising that you took away one of their perks is a great feeling.
---
...where?
---
For the killer or for everyone?
---
Y do u have such trouble with it? Do you also struggle against huntress ax?
---
For everyone of course
---
What
---
Disturbed Ward is probably the worst map for totem spawns. It's just a void of grass and trees with anything covering props. And I think it's the only map in which the shack still spawns a totems outside the wall instead of behind the door.
---
He has a mouth too. So only his eyes and mouth were rendered.

well u can derank so y not dernak then
---
Not in England, Canada, some States and many other places in the world!
---
On a serious note people actually ship those two? Ew...
---
It has the Flesh and Mud dlc, the Spark of Madness dlc, the 80s suitcase and bloodstained sack cosmetics.
---
‚ÄúI got hooked without getting a MoM stack, time to DC‚Äù -Ash players, in every case.
---
Laurie and Ash are Americans.
---
Everyone, just ignore that rogue E.
---
25% extra bloodpoints (like a BBQ / WGLF stack ) for every player that disconnect to the players that finish the trial.
---
FBI: We got 'em
---
It‚Äôs not a solution. Existing ‚Äúcounterplay‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean that the perk is okay.
---
Aight not gonna lie I'm satisfied with having 25% of Mister Burns fortune
---
Yea I think I'm blind
---
I‚Äôd also love something like WoW‚Äôs warmode bonus. 
---
The fewer people that are queuing for one side, the higher the bonus to incentivize people to play it. 
---
Killer queues are taking hours because there aren‚Äôt enough survivors? 40% blood point bonus for survivor queues. Queues are sort of even, but could use a few more killers to speed things along? +5-10% bonus for killer queues.
---
It was funny tho, because he wiggled immediately after u grabbed him
---
huntress axe is a projectile, not a stream that hits everything around her
---
No, in the right hands he's godly. I almost always get a 4k with clown because his ability to herd survivors into certain areas is amazing
---
Lol just get goood 4 head. I also play survivor too and I rarely complain about anything in this game. I‚Äôm just ranting about entitled survivor players like you who sound like you only play survivor and have never touched killer because the only advice you seem to give for playing killer is to ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù meanwhile survivors can exploit the map and do infinite looping on some killers i play to have fun on and not try to win every single game. And the only crutch perk a killer has in a high tier game is Noed. Meanwhile, again, all the perks I‚Äôve stated plus items can make killer have a hard time. You know there‚Äôs a problem when you have to waste two perk slots to counter a flash light. And you also sound like that guy who rage quits after getting downed by said insta hatchets or getting mori‚Äôd which doesn‚Äôt happen to often unless you‚Äôre rank 1 playing against the same guy every single game. So it seems I only have to ask who‚Äôs hypocritical now..?
---
You might run into problems of people queuing together and intentionally DCing to farm BP on one guy if that‚Äôs the case, 3 DCs and getting hooked/hatch on the last survivor is 10k+ BP in just a few minutes. This wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if DCers got actual punishment though.
---
So don't counter it and then complain when you get knocked down..? I really don't understand some people's hatred of cleansing totems, it doesn't take long and it's easy BP
---
Thank you, I tried really hard with the leather c:
---
"Some states"
---
How am I suppose to cleanse all 5 totems if I am getting chased the whole game?
---
But remember when you dc you lose all your blood points
---
I thought at first he was trying to mind game you to get you to run away but it definitely seems like he could see through those tires.
---
Aye bruh you coulda just paid for gamepass, 20$ cheaper
---
That's fair. I guess the solution is to spread awareness that totems are Hella important.
---
 Imagine getting 15000 points from a match, having a fully stacked BBQ, a survivor pudding, one survivor having Bloody Party and it being a double bp weekend.
---
you'll get: 15000 \* ( 1\[base\] + 1\[bloodyparty\] + 1\[pudding\] + 4\*0.25\[BBQ\] + 1\[doubleBPweekend\]) = 15000 \* 5 = 75000
---
But the survivors don't for the actual item AND addons?
---
But the devs didnt give the items back. Its fucked either way. They handled it wrong.
---
not surprised since there exist people who ship Myers with Laurie
---
Some killers are very addon dependent, no survivor **needs** to have an item in order to succeed.
---
On the plus side that ship isn't incest anymore.
---
I‚Äôm p sure the pic on the left is stolen Kate art.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter anyway since teachables are a thing
---
The pic on the left is stolen Kate fan art I think
---
Nah..
---
Much like 4ks imo
---
No it still is. Laurie in DbD is "OG" Canon Laurie.
---
Context
---
I play a fair share of both survivor and killer, and ‚Äúgens getting done too fast‚Äù is never really a problem when I play killer, and if it is, then I know I‚Äôm getting outplayed. Hell, even if I‚Äôm playing with 1 or 2 other people in a SWF, generators seem to take forever because usually one of us is working on a generator and the random(s) are either too altruistic or just don‚Äôt want to do gens. Also, removing ranks would make things much worse, as experienced players who have played the game since around its release can be matched with a complete newcomer who would stand almost a 0% chance of getting even 1-3 kills. imo the game is fine the way it is right now in terms of things like generator repair times. I can agree on other problems with the game, but I just can‚Äôt agree with things involving gen problems and some things of that nature. In the end, no matter how the game is, not everyone will be content and happy, and a perfect balance in almost ANY multiplayer game is close to impossible.
---
(I‚Äôve been to Rank 1 multiple times and all of this is true between ranks 15 and 1 as far as I‚Äôve seen)
---
Thanks for your response. That makes sense. My copy definitely came with those.
---
EAC is such cancer, its so aggressive. You could have cheated in another unrelated game playing on your own private server you pay for yet get banned in a totally unrelated games because "wahhhh some blacklisted driver was still loaded". 
---
Fuck EAC, its a reckless anti cheat thats nearly out of control. They ban without proof of cheating based on whim. Something the program doesn't like? Get fucked cheater. And no one will believe you didnt cheat.
---
Be able to tell when they are baiting you.  If you start chasing them and you see them wait for you to catch up, or are taunting (t-bagging, flashlight clicking) they might be trying to play the runner style and want to keep you on them.  Normally they are also good at looping, so after chasing for a while and you can tell they are really good at looping and mind games, it is probably best to ignore them for now.  You can also use their position as a hint, if they are trying to bait you to chase them to some side of the map, maybe go to the opposite where they are trying to keep you from.
---
Sometimes it is really obvious when survivors bait.  If you hook one, and a survivor comes and saves them and they run.  The one on the hook might slow down instead of having the healthy one in back to be a shield.  They probably have the borrowed time effect, mettle of man, or decisive strike.  Go ahead and hit them if you can't hit the other one.  If MoM and BT didn't proc, they might be running DS and I would just leave them on the ground and chase someone else waiting for the 60sec DS timer to run out.
---
In Halloween 1 she wasn't his sister, that was only introduced in the second film so we could be safe
---
no, it's not. nothing on this pic looks like her. Wrong type of clothing, wrong pose, wrong expression, wrong boob size, not even the hairstyle is the same.
---
This is assuming player play using their brains
---
*safe unhooks intensify*
---
You can get a lot of points with The Legion
---
Dwight and spirit
---
The killer you are best with and BBQ.
---
They aren't any better at Rank 1. 
---
Randoms always loop the killer around the hooked Survivor then farm them, wait for rehook, then do it again.
---
Git Gut.
---
Yeah it needs a rework but that idea is way too op.
---
MEEP MEEP!
---
Nope. I should get a multiplier for every person who disconnected.
---
but it was confirmed she's indeed his sister
---
Yeah but at rank 20 the killer doesnt really matter too much, I just wanna farm to lvl up my survivors
---
G I N G E R S N A P S
---
Yup commenting is sometimes like walking on eggshells really. Say one thing they don't like you're up for a bad time. But nonetheless I can are with you
---
Dwight because his p3 looks cool, spirit cuz im a tier list whore and nurse is too hard. Spine chill, BL, Adrenaline, and DS on dwight. BBQ, Whispers, surveillance, and nurses on spirit
---
You must be rather unlucky then. Red ranks are sweaty as hell, I hit 1 once a season and then don't try so hard to stay there but I don't typically see campers as it's just not a viable way to get enough bp to stay in the rank. I find 8-6 to be the sweet spot where people are more about having fun and still know how to play. You still get campers but the majority of games are good.  I'm pretty toxic and still don't get the face camp at those ranks unless I loop for 4 gens.
---
Solo survivor really kills the enjoyment of this game. So so many survivors are awful at the game (and very much so in red ranks, as well), barely working gens, barely lasting 30 seconds in chases, barely making good decisions even on a common sense level. It sucks the energy right out of me to want to play this game at all anymore, much of the time when I go for a solo survivor session. Playing killer is a more pleasant solo experience no matter the opponents I get, and I would and do take that over solo survivor most days of the week.
---
When I play SWF, it is without voice comms and with 2 or 3 players total, most of the time. And it is a completely different game. If you can trust your teammates to actually be teammates, to work on gens, to be competent enough in chases, to make sensible game decisions, suddenly it's fun and things matter and even losing is fun, because it is always engaging and losses mean it was challenging. Two random survivors are still enough to ruin games, so playing as a trio is nicer, though I do agree that playing as four competent survivors tends to make things too easy, against many killer players.
---
Why run iron will and self care?
---
You gonna be out of 20s real fast since you can‚Äôt depip past 15. But if it really doesn‚Äôt matter to you then I suggest Wraith, his ‚Äúsurprise attacks‚Äù are very bloodpoint worthy. Doc is good too obviously.
---
The doctor with distressing and BBQ.
---
This was my first time editing a video on my channel, I hope you liked it! Feel free to give me feedback so I can improve on my next video! :)  
---
This game was recorded during the Moonrise event if anyone was wondering!
---
We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever‚ÄîDavid perk.
---
Basically you get a token every time you safely unhook someone or take a protection hit for them, up to 4. 4 tokens is %100 more blood points for the match.
---
Everyone is this game is 21 or more apparently.
---
Thx I didnt know I cant depip before 15
---
I'm 25 and I'll tea bag you, the killer, the hook, the entity all of em. Toxically and thankfully.
---
Ehh I just go grab a beer
---
I don‚Äôt see how. You have to be the last survivor so you can‚Äôt just open it and let all of your friends out, the endgame collapse is happening so you have less than 3 minutes to find it and reopen it rather than go to a door, and if you don‚Äôt find it in that time period the killer gets a free kill.
---
The cake is not a lie!
---
Leave adrenaline alone! It's an award for completing your objective...
---
Sprint Burst the fuck outta there.
---
really? her model makes her look... kind of old? i think that's just me going nuts
---
O I N K
---
As a beta boy, I approve of this meme. Sorry rank 15 trapper with 12 hours, I just want my blood points to fuel my already P3 50 Claudette.
---
How do you know tho? Have you looked through every piece of fan art?
---
Love being farmed by my team ‚ô•Ô∏è Most exciting 45 second survivor games ever üôÉ
---
why do some players wants Adrenaline to be nerfed so much? in its current state is fine the way it is and it actually rewards you for doing the objective + it is way too situational
---
what is your point? teachables let you learn everything on one survivor, so every other survivor just becomes a skin. grinding multiple survivors doesnt change anything gameplaywise. that doesnt work on killers, because every killer is different. so you need to grind multiple killers..
---
Yeah, but the person who stays doesn‚Äôt. People could even make dummy accounts/bots to queue with even
---
McCote referred to the events of Halloween 1 as a "sibling reunion"
---
If you went on dbd rule 34 kate denson you would find it
---
The sad truth has been spoken
---
Feelings don't work here. You either overcome or succumb.
---
Pff But when is that going to happen
---
Is that a Claudette?
---
Mom turn off the vacuum I'm playing ... * fells of the chair *
---
And still not an advertisement for DBD.
---
Sorry but it's really getting annoying hearing killer mains talk about how communication is unfair. Dbd is a team based game meaning communication is highly important. It blows my mind that there is still no game chat along with survivors getting constant nerfs and killer mains are never satisfied. Not trying to start something here, just speaking my mind.
---
17 is legal in most states.
---
Think whatever you want bud but people might recognize her
---
Huntress is free
---
Do you know what an advertisement is? I play the game and have no idea how this is an advertisement for DBD. Going through a rule 34 sub to find a comparison picture that vaguely resembles Kate still doesn‚Äôt make it an advertisement for DBD.
---
https://youtu.be/MqI67S7wE6I
---
That happened to me recently. But the twist was so intense. That even the killer had lost all brain function.
---
Lmao these are some to tier immersed assess
---
Oh weird, I am coming from Xbox where I have Doctor and Hag without purchasing but need to buy Huntress.
---
U know what an add is doi and i play it too
---
but only just a lil bit
---
doctor is paid, huntress is free for everyone. i think you confused nurse and doctor
---
As a survivor main you CAN'T derank without hurting your team. You can't just dc or stand still like the killer because you are actively working against your team which is bannable. I don't dc unless killer's forcing me to (slugging all for no reason, constantly clicking mori to mock me). All I can do is wait for rank reset.
---
Wow toxic
---
Just came from Xbox where it seems to be the opposite of this. Hag and Doctor are included on there. That's where my confusion came from. 
---
Appreciate the quick responses
---
I'd love to play killer but for me (pc) it takes about 10 minutes (at any rank) to begin filling a lobby, which to me is way too long. Survivor games are instant when I join a lobby
---
xbox has special edition  only, so we get doc and hag for free
---
Yeah that makes sense now.
---
I never knew Hag and Doc were even purchasable. I've got the special edition on PS4 I guess they come with it and I guess huntress too
---
Yeah I'm not wasting 20% on a perk slot, insidious is just too valuable to me
---
‚ÄúThe entity wants you to torture not just kill‚Äù, It still sucks a 4k can depip
---
Say whaaat? Im the total opposite, I'm always in a constant panic/ frustration when plsying survivor because i hate teaming up and the game is so immersive. Whilst killer is just lollipops and rainbows.
---
Kaguya-sama love is war
---
GOOD killers don‚Äôt need to rely on op nurse to get kills,
---
That‚Äôs like, a full survivor game + escape PepeHands
---
But ruin helps slow the game down, just a little bit.
---
How cute
---
Am I getting downvoted for stating that something that is clearly dangerous and not healthy is sick? A normal person shouldn't enjoy those things. There is no point. Just pure degeneracy.
---
Rank 20-17 people who don't know how to play rank. Rank 17-14 campers who don't know how to play. Rank 14 -11 sweats  who don't know how to play. Rank 11-6 campers who know how to play. Rank 6-1 sweaty 5 blink Nurses
---
I just wish they could tell when it's an actual internet failure and not intentional
---
There's absolutely a learning curve.  You're essentially BP for the killer until you at least get the skill checks down
---
Template by u/Zombiehuggerr
---
To start things off I want to know what you know and build off of that.
---
Depends on what time of day you play
---
Must be a big coincidence that most DC are soon as a survivor goes down, what are the odds of being called to dinner or car vomit or someone at the door....
---
Id rather have a small player base with people who want to play vs DC because they are salty selfish a holes.  You know how many matches I have played where I still got tons of BP even though I was the first to go down?  I will also say, those who DC pretty much guarantee that the rest of the survivor will all die too. Survivor DC only hurts the other survivors and helps the killer immensely.
---
I think for majority it's the other way arround.  
---
If I am playing survivor I can listen to music or talk with friends over discord.  
---
Sprint Burst saves me from Jumpscare-Killers (Pig, Wraith). Terror Radius is enough for the rest.
---
Sure, sometimes I roll my eyes when I see my teammates disconnecting but besides that it's a chill.  
---
If I play killer (on higher ranks) I need to focus and pay 100% attention. No music. No multi tasking. I have to be completely in the zone or else I'll lose.
---
Plus you know you will actually play out entire match, and not get tunneled or camped and get like 5000 points for a match. If you know what you are doing you can get good 20000 points even against tryhard swf groups.
---
How is face camping and slugging not torture?
---
If you're new, run either Spine Chill or Premontion (up to you, but I personally think Premonition is more useful). Either of these perks will give you a "head start" on knowing that the killer is coming towards you, and it's a good way to get the hang of evading the killer and paying attention to your surroundings. 
---
As a general tip, always look around you. If you're on a generator, be moving your camera left and right and every which way as there are many "stealth" killers that can sneak up on you.
---
Creep everywhere, try not to leave tracks. Things will be tricky until you get yourself some good perks so be prepared to die a lot, it's a learning curve. Remember to save other survivors, you need to work as a team. I think you'll learn the most from playing and learning from mistakes. Have fun and welcome to the community :D
---
Yeah I get 4ks and depip all the time
---
Good survivors can work through Ruin making the perk a waste for the killer.
---
When I play survivor I find this map really easy to escape on
---
Pretty unarguable tbh. People have a lot of crazy standards for this game without any logical consideration towards plausible realities.
---
well yes i agree it‚Äôs nothing like you‚Äôd see in green or maybe purple ranks as well
---
I'd rather play with a rank 1 survivor than anyone else.. it takes skill to get to rank 1 survivor.. you gotta actually know how yo do things.. highest I can get is 3..  it's just a struggle you have to have a perfect game to rank up in red rank.
---
If a killer goes against a good enough team then yeah they do need the nurse.
---
Kate 'cause she's lovely, gorgeous, interesting lore + she gives me pretty much Miley Cyrus' vibes since i'm a fan and i loved that about Kate, for her i use DH/BL, Bond, DS and the 4th perk it's random (most likely Adrenaline, MoM, Iron Will, Open-Handed, BT, Deliverance). Piggy, the Saw chapter it's what got me into dbd and i'm a huge fan of the Saw series + Amanda was my favorite character, i run BBQ, Ruin, Enduring and same, for the 4th i switch between PGTW, Brutal Strength, STBFL, Monitor.
---
Face camping means you are only watching a few survivors or one and slugging means you aren‚Äôt sacrificing to the entity, unhooks give hope which the entity feeds on
---
Huh?
---
That wraith is completely deaf
---
Lemme vent here for a moment, last night I was in a match vs Bing bong and was crushing it, had 3 gens do e solo, wasn't seen once, 3 unhooks. Last gen gets repaired and we were looking good. Got downed, watched the dwight silhouette coming for me, he enters a locker and just sits there even tho we knew the killer was on the other side of the map at an exit gate and the locker was right around the corner from me. He leaves the locker and opens the closer gate ant just leaves. Blew my mind. I had unhooked that bitch twice.
---
If I was that Nea, you would've scared the shit out of me.
---
The devil's eyes...
---
basicly I dont have any plan,just ta tics for short periods of time
---
Every god damn time
---
Filthy and fine. 
---
I'd say that you should just get a feeling for the game at first  try reading the descriptions for the perks you plan on using. This game isn't really complicated, but if you'd like to learn more watch this video https://youtu.be/wKM7sM5a3WQ Have fun!
---
It does not need changed. Survivors don‚Äôt need anymore help.
---
I will try thank you!
---
Yeah, agreed. Most killers would've killed you if you opened a locker that close to them. Probably bwtter to just hide somewhere else and hope they don't see you.
---
Ok thanks for the tip. How do I unlocked these perks? Is it just through leveling up?
---
Oh wow, what a different world. Yea it's no joke the exact opposite. Maybe less people like killer on ps4 because of the 30 fps (best case scenerio)
---
I would say around 2 weeks if you play enough.
---
it doesn't look like her. when you fan-art you can draw hag and call it spirit, so it doesn't make much sense
---
I love it, it's gonna be my next perk I farm for, or hope for next week in the shrine :)
---
So a chainsaw has a counter play? When the killer can do a 360 and hit you with it when you‚Äôre behind him due to the broken hit boxes?
---
Yep! Both Premonition and Spine Chill are "generic" perks, meaning you don't have to unlock them through leveling up characters first. You'll just see them show up on your bloodweb as you level up your survivor. 
---
Until you get premonition or spine chill, just pay attention to your surroundings. The rest of it is just getting a feel for the game through trial and error. It's not too difficult so I'm sure you'll get the hang of it in no time! Welcome to DBD. :)
---
Camping should be punishable
---
Yea I'm at that sweet spot for rank at 12 right now, so I get rank 8-9ish survivors up to about rank 14, once and awhile 15 if they are swf.
---
Plunderer's Instinct. Everyone makes fun of me for using it (my friends and I are all red ranks so they're always like 'what are u doing running that'), but I have a nice collection of purple flashlights and rainbow maps and other pretty things that I'll never actually use so who's the real winner here.
---
Curious how they'll treat repeat DC offenders. As stated the player base (specially on console) is to low and would do nothing but damage the game player base. The only thing I could think of is partial bans, for example you DC to many times in a 24 hour period then your barred from playing that role survivor or killer for a set amount of time forcing you to play the opposite role. Or bar them from using the character they most recently DC'd as for a set amount of time which could be beneficial financially for them. Banned from every survivor/killer because you DC with each one in whatever time frame perhaps that would tempt people to buy DLC to keep playing while waiting for the ban timer to count down on whoever.
---
Good survivors can ignore ruin and finish the generator by hitting the great skillcheck
---
I, myself much prefer Spine Chill and would highly recommend it. I used it pretty much up until Devotion 1. Great perk. if you're playing Nea too, you'll also have a perk called Urban Evasion which allows you to crouch away a lot quicker too, so both of them together are amazing.
---
Lmao was she speed hacking the entire game üòÇ
---
Its like this format was made for this, top meme game OP.
---
I politely declined.
---
If you are on ps4 you can add me, I make the offer to anyone because no one should have to play alone :) milkman-4ever is my psn
---
Yup exactly. In my worst nightmares I see Megs running around with MoM, Decisive Strike and purple flashlights :(
---
There's too much to cover. My tip is go subscribe to some dbd content creators on YouTube e.g. Tyde Tyme, Monto. They generally have tutorials for all aspects of the game as well as general tips for playing survivor and killer. It's how I learnt so much.
---
No Mither. I run resilience and this is not happening with it and skulk around all game doing gens.
---
Depends on how much you play. If you no life? You can grind out 3k shards in a day
---
No u
---
No buying characters just gives you a new experience but the killers and survivors you get for free are still good
---
still new to game, 
---
got into cause of how much i love saw, i main pig, and am trying to get into nea rn
---
Survivor main: Claudette with purple hair and sweater/skirt combo. I equip her with self-care, urban evasion, borrowed time, and lithe.  I used to equip her with iron will, urban evasion, mettle of man, and lithe, but decided to get away from MoM because of the impending and unwarranted nerf. 
---
Killer main: Hag as Medusa or with the gold dress. She has Hex Ruin, Nurse‚Äôs Calling, Monitor and Abuse, and Surveillance (or Franklin‚Äôs Demise if the survivors have a lot of items or a key). 
---
Also, the Plague with BBQ, Hex Ruin, Surveillance, and NoEd/Franklin‚Äôs/Overcharge - depends on how I feel.
---
For DBD the later you show up the easier it becomes. Everyone who's been playing already has habits.
---
Nurse is the only killer that‚Äôs stands a chance at high ranks, change my mind.
---
In Halloween 2, yes.
---
Hot
---
Aight, ty. I think i'll give it a try
---
Thanks that's awesome I definitely will!
---
But the game doesn‚Äôt take place in America

That‚Äôs just bad memory on his part then, because they‚Äôre not siblings in Halloween 1. That‚Äôs introduced in Halloween 2 which starts its own timeline.

---
 i think they said killers get more BP b/c killer blood webs cost more BP? or something like that. ive seen it mentioned a few times on here
---
So if i knew how to maximize points i could get a ton with my main? Good to know...
---
Excuse me oink fellow survivor. May I oink work on this gen with oink you?
---
Kuwabara?
---
Where i am legal age of consent is 16. The question is which state/country laws would apply to The Entity‚Äôs game?
---
Awesome, most of the time I'm on between 5pm est and 10ish pm est but I also play fortnite a little and stuff and so have a gf so it can be whatever, but never hesitate to message me and ask to play if you are on, I'll drop what game I'm playing and come play a couple rounds :)
---
Ruin doesn't affect Overcharge, but yeah full stack Huntress' Lullaby with Overcharge and Unnverving is pretty ridiculous.
---
If someone is at the door, or my dog poops or my roommate starts speaking in tongues I just put the controller down so as not to impact the other players.
---
I do Killer main however/
---
Frank's Mixtape went from OP status to useless status.
---
they could just add "if players are in group and 1 from group disconnects no one from group gets bonus" and only the "ungroup"ed does.
---
It is. You can't win if you do.
---
Yeah but I was talking if you just play the game a little bit and switch it out for another. I personally would never be able to get 3k shards in a day because I do alot of stuff.
---
Yeah that should be fine I'll remember too add you once I'm home!
---
I think Deliverance and Diversion are quite underrated. I started as an Adam main so I guess I just used them because they were there and got used to them.
---
Do you plan as playing Survivor? If so, you can probably get away with it. There are systems in place to get perks offered by DLC characters without payment, though it may take you a while to get what you like. Aside from these perks, Survivors are literally the same aside from appearance.
---
If you want to play as a Killer, that's a maybe. Again, perks can still be acquired, but the Killers differ significantly from one another. There are systems (to my understanding) that let's you play as DLC Killers for free, but I imagine that they're rare to come across.
---
In short, you are not required to buy DLC. You will not be walled off from those who have purchased DLC, and there are systems in place to allow you to get around DLC purchases.
---
Alert

its not pedophilia if the person has his puberty

so you're so called fact doesnt even get that part right 
---
for shame

for shame

I‚Äôm glad we agree friend
---
I made a video recently specifically for trapper if you wanna have a look, if not it's allll good but it may help you think outside the box :) https://youtu.be/V3xFD0JdOh4
---
Purple and red are like night and day, yeah. 
---
I don't have to go watch youtube video when im in purple, the queues are really fast.
---
I‚Äôm more okay with being left behind if the killer is running NOED or is just camping me, instead of giving the killer an extra 1-3 kills. Like im over here tryna be a hero, but all I am was the first domino piece.

What movie is this?
---
Ok thanks!
---
Yall are being cringey and weird. It‚Äôs creepy as fuck to ship someone with a person over half their age to begin with. Stop arguing what the age of consent is in different countries, it doesn‚Äôt make it less creepy,wrong, or weird.
---
yes alert is cool
---
nice sneaky gen rush build
---
Meyers scares the crap out of me Bc he has almost no terror radius and I look behind me and all of the sudden he‚Äôs just standing there like a big creepo. 
---
That and hag when you first play her and trigger her traps. Geez my yelling can be heard for miles.
---
Definitely do it as an offering. Sometimes because I definitely shouldn't have lived or the killer was just a fun sport. Example, a basement Bubba was in his normal lair, protecting the chest. So went down there and gave him an offering of the item I had, and he let me open the chest. Someone before me tried opening it and he sawed them down and hooked them. So as some said, shits and giggles, other times as an offering because they were fun or because I shouldn't have lived that game.
---
Overcharge is still a solid perk I think, I must just run into some good surv I it's who can land it at rank 8iah personally
---
Yes but the pig still catches you by surprise. Ghostface however can still be heard when he‚Äôs going ‚Äústealth‚Äù. I mean Myers can go completely stealth and he‚Äôs not OP in any way. I just feel like ghostface power shouldn‚Äôt be heard from across the map when he activates it. And then when he gets close to you, you can‚Äôt still clearly hear him before he‚Äôs close enough to lunge at you or do anything effective.
---
I actually see more experienced survivors at purple ranks, a lot of people derank to avoid seeing ebony moris and broken add ons every game.
---
I can kinda sympathize with that after going vs 4 MOMs and syringes.
---
I do like to play Nea with that perk so I'll aim for those perks.
---
Are you suggesting the traps be invisible?  Because if so I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs an awful idea.
---
I'm just telling you the facts, bud. The DBD versions of Myers and Laurie are siblings.
---
Did you even try searching?
---
Punishment for playing hag
---
It‚Äôs a shame that his sounds make him easier to play against. He has wonderful sound design
---
The only problem is none of their lore states that they are. They‚Äôre obviously going off of Halloween 1 in which they have no relation.
---
Including the killer right? I hate it when im playing piggy or myers and i find someone quickly and they dc :(
---
can confirm
---
O
---
I
---

---
K
---
Alright thanks, was way off already have 820 at level 9
---
I think the biggest problem with the ranking system currently is that there isn't enough scoring events in game (for both killer and survivors) like, if they added stealth points for being in the terror radius without starting a chase. My biggest issue, is the bullshit -1 pip. Imo if anyone dc's everyone (including killer) should receive a safety pip, that is separated from the scoring system.
---
No you dont need any dlc's.(except the saw one oink oink best killer)
---
That‚Äôs bullshit lmao. Same cost.
---
Me too.
---
Deja vu (im kidding please dont kill me)
---
It has probably only been 3 working days for them to work on Ghostface, I expect some bandaid fixes tomorrow.
---
Urban evasion=best perk
---
I concur with this, if we Killers get a BP compensation Survivors should get one, too.
---
Not true, you can still get adept, it's just harder
---
Interesting. I guess it makes sense why Nurse wasn't too popular.
---
You need double pip for killer adept
---
because of the fact that these addons dont work on maps like lerys or the game and the whole point of the addons are to make the traps harder to see so this would work
---
A good nurse doesnt need perks
---
I only played during a free trail, but can't survivors find items during a match, and keep them if they escape, essentially giving them free stuff. Sure there are bonus things I forget the name of, but they didn't feel necessary. Whenever I played killer I never used enhancement items out of fear I'd run out, unlike player items that I knew I could restock by not sucking and actually surviving.
---
I can see where you are coming from in some cases.  
---
Going against a jumpscare Myers on certain maps can be funny in a 'scary/nervous' way. Same with a soundless-bell Wraith, soundless haunt Spirit or unvisible/soundless trap Hag.  
---
All of them are rare occurances though.  
---
The frustration as killer is more a "I hope I don't perform poorly" thing, since every mistake punishes you heavily.  
---
You can't enjoy chases because the longer the chase, the bigger the punish.  
---
And at the end of the game you are most likely getting insulted/taunted, no matter if you won or lost.  
---
After hundreds of games this can get to people (who don't have a thick skin).
---
Me when i see Freddy's basement in my sub feed.
---
Haddonfield when you're a killer
---
Or the game when you're anything really
---
It dosent affect it technically no, but it does mentally. Something about that red skill-check fucks people up so much more than normal.
---
Open-Handed
---
But the estate is bad for both sides because there is tall grass **e v e r y w h e r e**
---
Ya, which you can still get if a player DCs, it's just a bit more challenging. Did it with the clown
---
coming soon
---
you right, but i still enjoy the idea of it
---
That's irrelevant. Like I said, as a survivor you don't have to rely on your teammates. Hatch is always an option.
---
I‚Äôve been here since launch and have had to restart 2 times because of issues with my first two accounts. I always felt bad having to start in the 20‚Äôs ranges again. Even without perks, a lot of killers weren‚Äôt used to lunge or chases yet.
---
Not for both sides. The survivors are helped by the tall grass, even more if it is a p3 claudette
---
I'm a man, and reading that still hurt me.
---
But the lack of pallets is annoying
---
Congratulations, you lost your virginity
---
Oink oink pig forever oink oink
---
Definitely an improvement, I appreciate it.
---
Lol guys for anyone curious about OP.  He's an insidious camping Leatherface that runs NOED.  This is what you're hearing complaints from about an anti tunnel perk in Decisive....of course he doesn't like it.  He's an insidious camping Leatherface lol!
---
I really like detectives hunch. I know where every chest and totem is in a 30 mile radius every time I finish a generator.
---
I‚Äôm a rank 1 Hag main and my build is Ruin, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Nurse‚Äôs Calling, then usually Make Your Choice but if they have flashlights or multiple toolboxes I run Franklin‚Äôs Demise. I really like M&amp;A on Hag since it can help you get the first hit by just surprising someone on a gen, then you get the down when they run into a trap (near a pallet loop, inside a structure, etc). It also combos really well with Nurse‚Äôs Calling since her terror radius outside a chase is now smaller than the NC detection range.
---
For add-ons, usually the trap setting speed and the teleport distance ones are best. If you‚Äôre running Make Your Choice you might want to use the ‚Äúphantasm duration‚Äù add ons (eggs) instead of teleport distance. That gives you more time to wait for the unhook and then get the cheesy teleport one-hit if they have set off your hook trap.  Disfigured Ear is also good and Granma‚Äôs Heart can be fun but a bit more gimmicky.
---
Hillbilly
---
Because being at high ranks is such a positive
---
Well boys we did it, we stopped racism üòé
---
Read the post.....the crutch is fine for swf.  But soloqueue is broken with NOED.  You essentially have to cleanse them all yourself which is difficult to find 5 per game otherwise they get a mindless proc endgame.  His counters were as minor as it gets too.  A totem counter or simply the notification endgame that the babykiller has NOED.  They've reworked all the other crutch perks for survivor it's about time they address NOED.
---
Every Killer can do well (at any Rank IMO), but almost all of them depend on the Survivors to make mistakes that they can capitalize off of. This is true at every rank.
---
Nurse, however, completely reverses the structure of the game: instead of capitalizing on Survivors' mistakes to win, *Survivors* need to capitalize on *her* mistakes to Survive. If a Nurse player doesn't mess up, the Survivors don't live.
---
That would be awful for me it would be just me jumping every time
---
And one of the survivors have a chainsaw with 2 ds and 2 boil over
---
It's ephebophilia not pedophilia.
---
Just DC at the end of the match. Helped team. Depip. Win/Win.
---
Buy pig (oink oink)
---
killer stresses me out all the time can't help that I'm rank 9 and always play against red ranks
---
Spirit=trash pig=god
---
This is some r/okbuddyretard shit.
---
I don't think he needs a buff, I think it's just the nature of his power. If they buffed him he would be broken. You can shore up his weaknesses with the right perks, base clown just has weak map pressure.

I'm sure you're right, and maybe I'll get there some day. Until then, kinda need a way to learn when I don't play. Not a lot of time on hand, y'know?  
---
That said, I'll check out Monto when I have some time.
---
Appreciate your time.
---
So you used a toxic survivor to farm kills off hook and the players you tunneled were upset?  What a great reason to embrace being a babykiller and vow to camp and tunnel harder.  What a clown.
---
Don't creep around everywhere.  That dude is crazy.  Work on Meg first, get SB and Adrenaline.  Later, you can replace SB with something better.  As you walk around maps, take note of where pallets and windows are, those save you.  Keep your head on a swivel, the 3p view is your biggest weapon.  If you run, you will leave very obvious tracks, so don't run unless you're being chased or you know the killer is elsewhere/distracted.  Your goal early on is to learn how to be chased properly.  Looping and (hopefully) line of sighting the killer is the most important skill for Survivors.  You waste his time, and possibly lose him in a chase.  Skill checks are simple, and you can practice them online on the web. 
---
There's a small book that could be written about when to save, when not to save, when to abandon a loop, when to power through a Gen when killer knows you're location, etc.   
---
Find a good streamer to watch.  Fungoose is very educational.  
---
Let your team know you're new and still learning.

I always ignore people at the gates sometimes I catch the one dumbass not near the line to escape
---
Wait buying this game. In the next week's it will have their anniversary, so it will be probably cheaper. Also dlcs are at sales then
---
I play her perkless but I can list what's good
---
M&amp;A is good on her
---
if we're talking about her base power (no special add-ons) you can simply slap enduring + spirit fury on her in case you're forced to chase normally. 
---
Make Your Choice is good on her
---
ofc hexes are good
---
I main the oinky lady and use all her perks because she is perfect as she is
---
This argument only applies if the punishment for a small number of DCs is severe. What's more likely is a 10 minute timeout, which gets longer as you repeatedly DC over a short period of time.
---
You know just seeing the killer has to be a potato does it make it through.
---
If multiple people able to do it against multiple Killers and you somehow are the only person who seems to considering impossible as I said before maybe the problem is you
---
When is the dobule blodpoints event?
---
Okay what about BBQ &amp; Chili on her? Should I opt that perk out since she's a slow killer?
---
It's not like killers want to play with the same perks over and over again, it's just... the alternatives are... not so great
---
I‚Äôll check out Monto and No0b3
---
Never stated in the lore, and it was a stupid thing introduced in H2. Carpenter himself never liked it and the new canonical sequel, Halloween (2018), outright denies the relation.
---
Because being attracted to a 7 year old and a 19 year old is the same thing. /s
---
Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
---
"I COULD go complete immersive but that means I'm not doing gens and just hiding all game"
---
Nope, wrong, you can absolutely do gens while being stealthy, don't fall for the meme that using stealth automatically makes you worthless to your team, you just need to learn when to hide when doing gens
---
Playing with bond on as survivor is the fast track to becoming incredibly upset and jaded
---
Would be still after this nerf...
---
Heheheee, yes we loves it &gt; :3
---
I truly believe he will be. Easy to use insta-down with no significant disadvantage.
---
Yea I would have no problem with swf without voice comms. That‚Äôs fair to me. People are really taking what I‚Äôm saying the wrong way. I have no problem with people playing together. If you can trust each other to get the job done more power to you and you deserve the win. I do have a problem with them being able to essentially call out every move I make.
---
Actually, I've mostly done artwork with a thing to look at, so Idk. I should draw again. I have a good idea for a Cuphead drawing.
---
You both keep bringing up that "Carpenter didn't like it", which is irrelevant. 
---
Calling Halloween 2018 "canon" is pointless, because it's in its own timeline, same as how H2 and H20 are all canon in their own timelines.
---
McCote literally called it "a sibling reunion" in the official Halloween spotlight video, which is official and made by BHVR. Thus, in DBD's lore, they are siblings.
---
The entire leaning mechanic is sooo bad and  needs to be changed to manual input instead of SOME corners having it, relying on the map to not be designed horribly is not something you should have to worry about.
---
I wanted to write out a good counter argument but then I saw this
---
&gt; because killer is just way too boring/ easy 
---
Not falling for the troll, mate. GG
---
Oh stuff like that is so cool but...I don't like to do stuff like that x'D I makes me angry when it's not working x'D
---
Hmmm. I feel like someone should say pig=upvote
---
Should've known what was going to happen when I saw the name but I didn't
---
Then it should have proximity chat or something so I as the killer can hear Johnny Callouts if I‚Äôm close by. I would also like to point out that I‚Äôve only been playing for a week so if this is an old and tired complaint I apologize. Just discussing something that‚Äôs bothering me as a newer player.
---
What if the perk was altered to better reflect the actual, final campaign in Left 4 Dead that resulted in his demise in the first place? When he was "Left Behind", the other survivors had to leave him behind as he sacrificed himself to lead the other survivors to safety. Here's what I had in mind. It's a little complex, but I think it makes sense for the context of Bill's character:
---
&gt;**Left Behind**
---
&gt;You understand that in order secure the safety of your comrades, sometimes sacrifices must be made. 
---
&gt;Upon being sacrificed, grant the remaining survivors a 60%/80%/100% bonus to repair, healing, cleansing, sabotaging, and exit gate opening speeds to be split evenly amongst all remaining survivors at the time of your elimination. 
---
&gt;This effect cannot be stacked. If Left Behind is activated twice, the effect gets renewed to match the conditions of the last survivor to be eliminated with Left Behind equipped.
---
&gt;Increases your chances of becoming the Obsession. 
---
&gt;*"You guys are the only family I got! Take care of each other!"*
---
As you can see, I had to change the flavor text and the quote to better reflect the changed perk. 
---
So, in other words, if you are the first person to be sacrificed, the remaining survivors get a 33% progression speed bonus each.         
---
If you were the second person to be sacrificed, the last two survivors each get a 50%.       
---
If you were the second to last survivor to be sacrificed, the last survivor gets a 100% bonus.       
---
The effect doesn't wear off. If the Left Behind effect has been applied, and another survivor with Left Behind is sacrificed, the effect does not stack, only renew itself.
---
You just need to know what distances the killer can hit you from by heart, you can actually punish pallet swings if they're a bit too far away when they swing and you just keep running
---
I expected more from you, but still \*happy oinks\*
---
Wait thats ilegal
---
Yeah. Even tracing, I was bad at drawing Squigly from Skullgirls. I probably had to do some shading.
---
Aftercare: you see them, They see you. Fantastic perk
---
Well if your a killer and someone quits before you can hook them you miss out on at least 200 but if you take in late hooks, hits, entity summoning and sacrifices it's way less than the 625 you get for a quitter and then the survivors have way less of a chance in escaping which is 5000 so I think it should be more like 3000 points at least or more
---
Op are you high or is this just a shitpost? Lmao
---
No one is defending the ship, just correcting OPs definition.
---
Wait shit, look, it actually is Kate fan art, he sent a link
---
The 2018 Halloween film retconned all other Halloween films. In the movie, a few characters even say that Myers being Laurie's brother is just a made up rumor.
---
32k ;)
---
Yeah shading and highlighting blows in the soul of some drawings
---
When I‚Äôm running Myers or Billy, if I down a survivor and I see others trying to be slick or distract me I‚Äôll go after them. If you are running the chainsaw or tier 3 Myers, I have downed many people this way. I run deer stalker too, so I can keep tack of where everyone is. If I go after someone, I‚Äôll often route back to the first survivor I downed and sure enough another survivor will be going for the heal.
---
Remember how survivors screached about 40% escape rate when there was an event with lots of suicides, but when it's the other side, silence
---
What type of oink heresy is this?
---

---
every player remaining get a BP increase by percentage would work better, 50% more? or all the blood points which the DC player got will get split across every player still in the game after.
---
a survivor DC pretty much means survivors lost. So i think more bloodpoints for everyone would be better
---
BBQ is okay on her but not stellar I guess. I think she gets less value out of it than the faster killers though (like you said) and she gets a good amount of information from traps anyway.
---
the shipping shit in general makes me want to gouge my eyes out
---
I think it‚Äôs just a me thing, but as survivor I feel like I‚Äôm letting down the team if I‚Äôm not doing gens or if I don‚Äôt get people off the hook, but as Killer no one relies on me other than me. If I do bad as a killer it only effects me but if I fail as a survivor I feel like I let down the team.
---

Survivors on console can literally run around you in circles faster than you can turn in circles from the extremely low sensitivity. You're wrong
---
I don't want to play with pc players, they are cheaty fucks. They use hacks, they use macros, they use shit like fullbright using their graphics cards to have a grossly unfair advantage, and they have mouse and keyboard to make absurdly fast 360s, literally spins that happen within 1 - 2 frames while console sensitivity is still too slow, no thanks, I don't want to hit teleporting survivors.

I play nurse with a sneaky slug build I put together that I think is great fun. Deerstalker, nurses calling, hex:third seal, and knock out. Makes finding your teammates difficult and I like changing up the gameplay for survivors. Not exactly a great way to rank up since I never hook until all 4 are on the floor but I kill all 4 every game.
---
My average survivor pudding farmer Doctor build I net anywhere from 70,000-100,000 BP, the most I‚Äôve ever gotten on survivor was a 3 iridescent 1 gold game with 4 WGLF stacks, i got like 60k

That sacred the shit outta me what the fuck

this map literally has below 10 pallets I swear

I never said anything about an Xbox, the number 360 was the amount of games I played

Its part of the game not knowing if noed will show up

If you are that scared use small game

Bam problem solved

Noed is fine as it is
---
This I can agree with, on a rare occasion I can pee and still pull of a 4K, but I do agree that as Killer you have no real downtime. If I‚Äôm playing Killer and need to pee I‚Äôll just try hard (which I don‚Äôt do often, I like playing with survivors as Myers) but if I really need to pee I just accept that I won‚Äôt do good that game and just go to the bathroom and accept defeat.

There was a 3rd year of DbD anniversary stream just recently, and I can remember Mathieu C√¥te(The game director) said "we're adding pretty much everything people imagine and ask for AND other epic stuff you didnt know you wanted!" So I'm really excited to see what happens in DbD from now on. I honestly cant wait!
---
Snakehandlers mori (-).O
---
If its so situational. why are 80% of survivors running it?
---
I don‚Äôt know if this is underrated, but I‚Äôve been using urban evasion a lot recently.
---
The survival rate at rank 1 currently is 80% on pc. Nurse is the most played killer at rank 1. Nobody can convince me survivors will ever be less powerful then the killer at that rank. At the lower ones for sure. But a team of survivors playing absolutely perfectly can only be beaten by the nurse. (Which btw, makes up the majority of the 20% of killer win rate at rank 1) Wake the fuck up people. Please god.
---
As a newish killer, it‚Äôs my least favorite map, yeah.
---
Posted this a while ago. People dont seem to like it..
---
I do agree though. 
---
https://xz.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bv6ugt/adrenaline_and_noed/
---
wait, this particular log causes this kind of thing? that's wild
---
I'd encourage some of you that main survivor and only play killers to shrine to toy with anyone that smells like new blood. We want the community to grow. The learning curve for brand new people can be steep.
---
Sorry if this joke has already been made, but this is probably one of the only times I've seen a proper glitch in a public match
---
And the killer should have it count as a sacrifice and not half the points. Most of the time I chase them and down them then they dc. I deserve the points after all that work.
---
And survivors shouldn't be penalized for then leaving going against there pips. In general DC's shouldn't go against any player that isn't the one leaving.
---
You people already have lockers, is bqq REALLY that hard to counter???
---
On PC sure. On console where you can barely get 30fps combined with the potato internet connection of most killers, is not that easy. But yeah, I don't have that much of a problem with ruin. It is annoying that everybody uses it now, but I am ok üòõ
---
If they are willing to do all this shit for pity 10k, I'd let them do. They are too stupid to be productive anyway.

---
I‚Äôm a Feng main and I swear, the GG jacket with brown pants and a brown ponytail is better camouflage than I imagined. Some maps are better than others but I‚Äôve hidden in plain sight several times in the Farm and Wreckage Yard maps with decent success.
---
And loose because the other players are doing gens meanwhile. I've done this many time and if you do it on Blood Lodge for example, you're gonna loose ;)
---
Solidarity, I love to heal so that perk saves me so much time
---
I bought a really good one from a Russian guy on etsy, only cost me ¬£48 ish really good quality and arrived in about a week/2 weeks

---
Nurse cant blink through + I've seen multiple instances of this particular log doing this.
---
That‚Äôs what the ruins for and I‚Äôm sorry but *Lose
---
Stop trying to give yourself an unfair advantage, that's my tip :)
---
There's a reason it doesn't work
---
Nah actually legion, I was just joking because insidious is kinda one of the most useless ones unless you're camping a hook
---
Killers that defend their use of NOED constantly counter argue that totems are survivor objectives too yet they refuse to allow this objective to be tracked...seems hypocritical, every other objective for both sides is tracked.  SWF already have a totem counter anyways.  This just balances it for solo queue.  And killers don't want to be gen rushed correct?  This would encourage games to slow down by having survivors search for totems.  Isn't that a good thing?
---
Small Game is not a solution.  It won't tell you about a totem that may have been already taken out by someone else.  You could spend the game looking for a totem that doesn't exist.  At the very least the perk should include a totem counter if it is a true counter to NOED.
---
Bold of you to assume a good nurse needs anything.
---
All I know is that I saw the same image on r/dbdgonewild and on Kissanime. I am probably not alright. Sned Pleh
---
Unless they find ruin in the first 3 seconds of a match/can actually hit skillchecks.
---
I mean it‚Äôs fair but I hate Juilie and I like Frank I Maine‚Äôs kensei thank you
---
Not anymore, with the new matchmaking, they all join at once.
---
I did it in geography, lmao
---
Stbfl in my opinion isn't great for hag, because she literally cannot pick and choose her targets, or choose favorites. she can't really avoid the obsession without detriment, she has to spread her "love" evenly across the team and hit anyone who trigger's a trap, because traps have no bias.
---
Do Gens. 
---
Learn optimal looping routes in chases. 
---
Save other survivors but don‚Äôt be stupid about it. 
---
Do Gens. (Very important) 
---
Only play immersed when the killer is near you imo
---
I agree that voice comms are BS from a gameplay standpoint, but I also know that a lot of players simply use it to have fun or because it is fun, that the tryhard squads that use it for extreme coordination and domination are rather rare. Knowing also that disallowing voice communications would lead to lots of players quitting the game, and that in turn only leading to longer killer queues among other things, I would not advocate for as much.
---
I do think there should be SWF nerfs that at least to an extent account for the existence of voice communications, such as limiting the amount of perks they can bring, or increasing generator times - respectively on a per-player basis, so a duo can bring 3 perks each, a trio 2, and a full SWF only 1 perk each; or +10 seconds generator time for every SWF player (+20/+30/+40). These things would not affect any non-SWF survivors in the duo/trio games.
---
Yup. I‚Äôve played against plenty of trappers and hags between rank 9-13
---
The distinction doesn't really matter, they're both still gross.
---
Shit like this happens to me all the time on pale rose, where I get hit and downed literally fucking on the ground next to the boat and teleport there, where on my screen I was upstairs.
---
It‚Äôs buggy af and one of the reasons I hate Pale Rose. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not ping/lagswitching now. It happens far too frequently on decent ping games. It‚Äôs always around the boat.
---
"Here come's the trapper!"
---
Hate to break it to you but it's never going to be bannable. The EGC timer is only 2 minutes so it's not taking the game hostage.
---
I know but most people dont know what Hebephilla is.
---
Fair enough, I'm normally on the other side and get let down by other survivors and then I never get saved while Bill gets downed across the map because he ran over a hag trap
---
Ta
---
The sole Surviving Killer
---
should be granted
---
That Survivors accumulated POINTs
---
For Dc'ing even more so when they dc so the last survivor can escape via hatch
---
Agreed. I play with 1 or 2 friends most of the time, partially because it's fun to be able to communicate and hear each other's reactions and jump scares and stuff, and partially because we all get incredibly upset with solo q toxicity. What's worse than toxic survivors as a killer? Toxic survivors as their teammate. It's incredible the amount of randoms who will lead killers right to you and then teabag you while you're on the hook until you're dead. Surviving with friends isn't the problem overall, it's toxic survivors in general. If you get a swf that happens to be toxic, that definitely sucks but not some of us just want to have fun playing the game. I spend almost all of my gaming time in a party with friends anyway so naturally it just turns into "send me an invite," but neither me nor anyone I've partied with has ever been toxic. Maybe not the brightest but not toxic haha
---
Living that kind of life, you get pretty tired
---
I think most people feel like the hairstyles look really stiff now though. I saw a few posts on them. I personally feel like it looks unnaturally stiff now, but oh well :(
---
Yes, they stack but you dont need addons to oink people
---
Obviously Darude - Sandstorm with OINK instead of du
---
But it is griefing, which is a reportable offense
---
https://youtu.be/6X4Pl7_tGRw
---
Check 3:13, they are siblings.
---
I know it's Hebephilla but most people don't know what that is lol. Pedophilia is more recconized as "wanting sex with underage individuals".
---
I say more depending on how many generators are left ya know
---
Dude I just pictured the most badass fight scene with that song playing while I wear the Oinker mask.
---
But.... oink
---
If the game wasn't designed for swf, it wouldn't be a part of the game, and they wouldn't be expanding on that party system. I understand it can be more difficult or unenjoyable on the killers end sometimes or possibly even toxic, but it's not like swf is against any rules or doing anything wrong
---
Bing Bong, REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!
---
We all know the Wraith will always be the best M1 Killer in our hearts.
---
Technically it is holding a game hostage albeit just to bm for 2 minutes while being a needless dick.  You are correct though that it isn't the reportable game hostage situation the devs refer to since the game is guaranteed to end.  
---
The irony is EGC was added to help eliminate survivor bm and instead it is being abused to create new killer bm lol.  Really a shame that the toxicity in this game exists on both sides so widely.
---
I'm surprised she didn't drop the cake like it was a pallet on him.
---
That would be bad ass
---
Autodidact bad
---
Happens to every new killer sadly.
---
I cant distinguish between oinky lady and trapper
---
it's very easy to make one yourself too, but i can't really call that a "quality" product
---
And some other survivor is cleansing a dull totem, while the killer is nowhere in sight and anyone could have unhooked you but now the entity has been summoned.
---
A lot of players quit when the killer camps.  I'm surprised and frankly disappointed they still haven't fixed the underlying problem
---
Why do people have a problem with streamers? I stream, after every match I always say gg and I love you, no matter what. And people are just like, "I hate streamers". I just don't get it.
---
The eyes of "Oh boi, time to go killing again" when he goes EW3.
---
I don't do that as a killer either, though I'm unsure if they'll actually set a ban for that because I've been MEGA TROLLED by survivors and killers. They just like to fuck around when they realized theyve won. I let it roll off my back and start the next round lol
---
Being puked on for 2 minutes and then dying sounds like a horrible way to die.
---
Don‚Äôt be a jackass. It‚Äôs the quickest way to die if you are one.
---
I just wanted to try it out if I ever want to switch over to PC not for a unfair advantage

Claudette confirmed
---
No, we're going to bitch about things and there's nothing you can do about it :p
---
There are solution's to those problems, stop being complacent.
---
I am going to bitch about everything you told me not to bitch about
---
1. Swf is a problem in the way that there's a huge divide between solo players and Swf players, the game is almost impossible to balance unless they merge the two, what I'm saying is give solo survivors comms in game and balance around that
---
2. I don't want to use the same meta perks over and over again, 90 percent of the perks in this game ate useless and that's annoying
---
3. that boi ain't getting buffed lol
---
4. mom is poopoo üòé
---
If it bothers you so much why not change your profile settings so you can only be messaged by friends 
---
Kind weird to get upset at someone thanking you bit dramatic
---
I disagree it just looks like they had Ketchup poured all over them while Clowns Knife looks beautiful even with the gore and Clowns face isn't just full of blood he has it on one side which looks more realistic if he were to kill someone and his body is still bloody but the Gut isn't to show he is  disgusting obese. I just feel Trappers and Hay just looks ridiculous and doesn't even look bloody
---
I say 10k make it worth playing 3 gen Doc on The Game
---
I don't think it needs another counter, I just like coming up with buff ideas for unused perks.
---
Oinky lady because oink
---
This is absolutely accurate to what I see.
---
I'm rank 10-5 like most of the time, and this graph could not be anymore accurate (atleast for me).
---
You have bullied the killer so much that the entity has cursed you. You shall not pass.
---
I agree with this and that seems fair for everyone really. And if the tryhards are rare then I have the worst luck. Admittedly I‚Äôm not the best and I‚Äôm still learning but man it seems like I run into a lot of groups that bully the shit out of me and seem to know every plan I have. Then we hit the end screen and I see ranks like 2,2,8,13. I‚Äôm a rank 12. As I typed that out I‚Äôm thinking my issue may be more with matchmaking than swf itself.
---
....the character is a literal parody. Everything in it is meant to be dumb racist and stereotypical. This is literally a character from a fucking parody movie. That‚Äôs why I asked if you were joking. This whole aDmiT to wAnTiNG tO kILL aLL wHIteS shit is so lame
---
I only rated her so low just because it's kinda bland. At least she does look bloody while Trapper just looks like he broke a Ketchup crate and it got all over him
---
This is why I love console, rank 1 still gets you solid games. Only spirit is op, because people have no idea how to counter her.
---
Well the salt/rant flair was certainly appropriate here.
---
Serious question, I thought clown was a really good killer have they nerfed him at some point so he's "op".  I know this tier list is ironic, but I thought he really was good
---
Meg ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fast as fuck boi!!‚Äù Thomas.
---
You dont appreciate the oinkness
---
Followed by "...I hit them? I hit them. I hit them! Oh my god, okay. Hook. Hookhook...fuck. AH GET BACK HERE YOU FUKIN..."
---
Not exactly what I meant as far as design. I was speaking more about the mori aspect. Yea I can run that to combat it but I‚Äôd much rather hook and sacrifice so everybody has a good time. At the end of the day we‚Äôre playing a glorified hide and seek video game. We should all be having fun.
---
\*soft oinking\*
---
The short version is if killers didn't make more points far fewer people would play killer, and ultimately the game would die.
---
Obviously other reasons and naunaces are involved, but that's one of the big reasons
---
Again, maybe you should check your own comprehension skills.
---
I'm explaining to the original comment why Vigil is bad.
---
&gt;I'm saying it's silly to be mad that it doesn't do things it doesn't say it does. 
---
No shit Sherlock; I'm mad because these are some of the things Vigil SHOULD DO so it can be considered a worthwhile perk. The fuck are you on?
---
Yeah i realised once he dropped me next to a hook to close the hatch 10 meters away he wasnt going to hook me so i just went afk while on my phone. He seemed pissed i didnt react to it in anyway because the only reason they do this type of shit is for a reaction and for the survivor to try and escape
---
I just think it could've been better like how Pigs blade doesn't even look bloody it just has the weird organ type thing attached to it and bloody pigs head  is kinda hard to tell it's bloodied.
---
Gotcha. I misunderstood but I agree with you about that. The Mori aspect is definitely necessary sometimes but I feel it also takes some fun and suspense out from both sides
---
why am I being downvoted I'm just sharing my opinion on shipping christ
---
If I see a survivor getting farmed I'll tunnel and camp everyone else and let that player farm points + give them hatch, to punish their dickhead team mates and basically reimburse them üòÇ
---
Underlying problem being that alleged adults (M rated game) can't handle pixels not going their way so they throw a fit equivalent to a child taking their ball home from the park?
---
Survivors would find ways to abuse it, especially swf.
---
Just go on your phone or something. It‚Äôs only 2 minutes
---
Oinkly oinky oink
---
Double BP is this weekend I believe
---
Would be kind of easy to abuse the system. make the player that disconnects lose something to deter dc's
---
dont buy the game, its way to grindy and devs dont play it so they dont know how to balance stuff + fucking dlcs
---
Not even. We are talking ephebophilia here, and its just a preference, not a disorder.
---
Feng. I probably play Clown, Freddy and Wraith the most.
---
That's not hostage. Game state still progresses even though it is dragged out. (Collapse kills you, or you bleed out into the dirt and die.) 
---
Hostage would be something like 3-gen doc, but NEVER hooking anyone and just picking them up and dropping survivors to reset them so they're stuck until someone DC's, or bodyblocking a dude in a corner and just waiting until he DC's etc. 
---
I still think it's a shitty move though. I'll admit I did it the first few times because the animation is hella cool but after that I'd rather hook them and get the match over with.
---
Me, as Spirit, blindly running in my spirit world, it ends. There's a survivor. I hit them. They instantly disconnect.
---
Back into the spirit world I go.
---
Matchmaking can definitely be awful, especially when mixed-rank survivors team up. Rank itself is not a good measure of skill, which leads to a vast skill disparity at any rank. Rank should be more about winning in the objective sense of survival/kill rates, and matchmaking should ideally also take into account hours played, on a best-possible-match basis, and certainly more-closely match players based on rank, too.
---
That said, I do think you will find things to get a lot better if you get better yourself, simply by playing more, maybe watching some strong killers on streams or some tutorials. Then instead of demoralizing, it can actually be rewarding to beat such teams, and many of these SWFs tend to be overaltruistic to their deaths.
---
One tip I can give you now that you could try and immediately see an improvement due to: tunnel with a vengeance, that is, even leave chases to return to the hook and chase the unhooked survivor. You want to get survivors out of the game as fast as possible.
---
You didn't see the new Fat Jesus perk..."See through Pallets"...He is Jesus, so it's balanced.
---
The only reason you‚Äôd be downvoted to hell would be because youre over analyzing a joke character from a joke movie who went with stereotypes and making it like everyone wants to kill white people. It‚Äôs just an old movie making fun of a bunch of different horror movies and stereotypes with black people who are also stereotypes and takes shots at everything including themselves. Some of the things said in the movie were either dumb racist sexist homophobic and most of all stupid just to be. Literally blacks white asian everyone was made fun of. There‚Äôs no white hate lol wtf
---
Yea nobody likes getting knocked out of the game after first hook and honestly I feel like I miss out on BP if I have to eliminate early
---
Survivor main here.  I didn‚Äôt realize how tough it was to be a killer til I just tried it recently.  I‚Äôll be teabagging a lot less now.
---
Also, as a killer I basically tunnelled whoever was teabagging.  I learned that tunnelling/camping is warranted in those circumstances.
---
It sound like it took the same movies to spoof as Scary Movie
---
The answer isn't to start rewarding those left after someone disconnects as that won't solve the problem. The answer is to start punishing disconnects hard enough that they stop happening with any real regularity. Queue bans and or Leavers queues from the very first disconnect just like they do on games like League of Legends are the only way you will fix the huge disconnect problem this game has.
---
He is good just not as easy to see his impact as with nurse billy etc. Same with Plague. They‚Äôre both solidly in the top half of killers.
---
I don't see why it should be bannable because what if you can't find the survivor during that time it would make it difficult to tell who is just being rude and who is trying to find the survivor and just can't obviously you could send footage but I don't think alot of people would.
---
I see what you did there...pretty sneaky sis.
---
Yeah brutal strength is hot trash right now it saves like 0.4 seconds or some shit. Just bring spirit fury.
---
I thought I didn‚Äôt care if I win or lose as killer.  Then I saw all these asshat survivors teabagging me after vaulting or at exits.
---
Made me care :*(
---
Was thinking exactly the same thing I really fucking hope it‚Äôs ironic
---
It gets worse for me the higher I get in rank, rank 12-8 is probably the least bad imo
---
Hangsman trick=meta perk
---
Change my mind
---
Firstly, by slugging all I also mean leaving them be, to bleed out, just to piss people off (sometimes even take Hex: The Third Seal with Knock-out to force people to actively look for them and expose themselves. Yes, happened to me with a nurse). Not just slug because somebody else was near and they decided to down 2 people.
---
Secondly, I dislike slugging a whole lot, because it's SO boring and annoying for the survivor to just lie there for 4 minutes each trial (I should mention I do play the killer myself sometimes and I know both perspectives), a sweaty strategy used by people who can't get 4k without doing so. I wouldn't be angry about if it didn't happen so often. Take ubreakable, you'd say. So what, they finally find one of us, slug again. After 10 trials like this in one day, you start to hate it.
---
But if survivor(s) had a way to hold the game hostage for 2 minutes and the killer could do nothing about it but go on their phone at the end of the game for 2 minutes there would be an uproar in the community. The plague puking on me for the entirety of the EGC timer is equivalent to survivors tbagging at the exit gate and refusing to leave
---
Oh wait you cant cause i dotn have one
---
Doing gens, you?
---
It relates to a lot more people which is good.
---
You can get a 4k by camping the hook and having two altruistic survivors. That's not something the devs want to encourage, nor do I think its a style of play we as a community should want. The system we have now isn't perfect either, but I think it's much better than a blind "4k = pip"
---
I'd like a system like this, as long as you're not  SWF with the quitter. Also, whoever DCed should lose 3000 bloodpoints their next match, as a "quitter loss" or something.
---
This was during the "Moth" Special Event...GG my dude.

---
Slugging sucks when you struggle to down survivors. Next time, slug and patrol. If they're SWF, you can expect their friends to still be around.
---
There wouldn‚Äôt be an uproar because it‚Äôs 2 minutes. 
---
They won‚Äôt, and shouldn‚Äôt, make this a bannable offense because it happens maybe once every 20 games
---
Good for stealth not that bad of a map
---
I sure did :)
---
So what happens if you just naturally got to be the last survivor?
---
Oink Dubstep you say? Here you go. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-j2FY9RLs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-j2FY9RLs)
---
Understandable, but its just a safety pip, and if the survivors are dumb enough to still go save after seeing multiple times that theyre camping its a bit on their side as well
---
Usually during holidays, or when a new chapter comes out, prior chapters go on sale for awhile.
---
sounds like you're taking it too seriously xd
---
I already get Freddy 3/4 k a LOT and thats assuming I don't have 1-2 disconnecting just because I'm playing Freddy which is my fav killer to play.  If I get to teleport to gens im going to just start wrecking games  lol!
---
I didn't have the door finished, Billy did the rest.
---
You know that the killers can open the doors now.
---
Ok yeah so then maybe not a deduction but not as many points for escaping through the hatch
---
well yes but he was carrying a survivor
---
Ok people need to chill on the Ghostface buffs. Yes it's coming, yes it will take time. Are survivors still waiting on BHVR to fix the fast vault on the bus? Also yes. (if u don't already know, the bus vault doesn't work during a fast vault and it's been that way for well over a month)
---
I've not done it myself yet but I guess since he can still hit with his free hand...
---
I guess thats okay
---
What?
---
well yes but its a prompt , you hit r1 to do it. i just didnt know you could do it while carrying a survivor
---
There was about a 12.5% chance she picked the Nea locker. There was a 50% she'd exit the building that way.
---
The odds were 6.25% :^)
---
Killer mains consider it toxic when more then one survivor brings a medkit to the game. I think there would be an uproar about survivors being able to make the game last 2 more minutes without the killer being able to do anything about it but watch
---
Blessed
---
Vigil‚Äôs a waste of a perk slot either way.
---
Thanks for the advice. I genuinely appreciate it. I‚Äôve been seeking out more stuff on YouTube and twitch to try and pick up on what people do. That has helped. I picked up the game last Monday and was going through ranks pretty quickly up to 9 then hit a wall. Now I‚Äôve deranked back down to 12 so just frustrating I guess.
---
Use "we gonna live forever" I think this is the name, main killer sorry, this can double your BP like BBC. And about points, greedy and toxic play style do this. Guys want rush generators in 5 minutes don't let the killer get 1 hook, with 4 survivor friends full flashlights. And get 20k points or more. Go find some totens, do generators even if you don't need. Try be chased by killer, this is part of the job, every pallet you hit gain thousand points. Everyone complain about killer behavior, but if you play with killer can easily understand. Every time I use better add-ons or a mori players disconnects. Imagine if every time survivors use brand new, purple flashlights, (decisive strike M of man adrenaline and borrowed time) the killer disconnect. Just look around less people wants play as killer because of toxic behavior of survivors. If a killer get everybody he received salty and if 2 escapes he gets toxic.
---
Driving a car has a function and has made our countries great. Hurting yourself for these reasons is not normal and is useless. Just a perversion.
---
Funny because a lot of games have longer games (MOBA‚Äôs for instance) and leaver penalties but people still play them. 
---
People should just man up and learn to lose, it‚Äôs just a game. I never DC‚Äôd from DBD so far.
---
I would put ghost face, billy, trapoer, and hag on top. That‚Äôs just me though. Nice list.
---
Or the same amount as the killer?

Trying to justify your fetish makes it even weirder.

Disconnects can be fixed, and here's the solution; someone disconnects early on = reduce the points needed to get to 0 pip, but keep the point distance between 0 - 1 the same. This ensures that, even if they DC, you'll at least walk away without losing progress. DC'd don't piss me off, it's the fact that it's a guaranteed de-pip that ruins it for me. If I can walk away without losing a pip, I'm happy.
---
I honestly just wish they'd award me the hook states for the DCer, killer adepts just got harder already but when someone dcs that that entire attempt ruined.
---
I do feel Hillbilly is a little low so I agree he should be bumped up but I still agree with my opinion that they(trapper and hag) look like they got ketchup poured on them but hey it's all opinionated
---
As a killer main,I live seeing a flock of disorganized duck walkers.  It makes my day.
---
I am asking myself the same thing. I even heard the characters differ in how much noise they make when injured.
---
you don't lose them if you unplugg
---
I just hate it cause I really don't understand.
---
Fuck I hate this. 
---
What‚Äôs worse is when the killer is chasing all of my teammates the entire match and they‚Äôre getting hooked left and right, saving each other, etc., while I sneak around and complete like 3-4 generators by myself. Then I complete the last one, my teammates escape and I get hooked, and literally NO ONE cares.
---
I just want to throw my computer out the window in those types of matches.
---
My first killer to go against was the huntress. The first time I heard her lullaby my heart just fucking sank and I became mega immersed lol
---
because you don't counter her. You just can try to juke her if you have iron will but you don't know in advance which killer you're going to face. So it's not relevant. There is no ultimate counter to Spirit.
---
I feel Micheal is definitely one of the funner killers when you first use his ability,  you stalk a survivor and go into the next tier and if you stalk again you gain a one shot ability for a limited amount of time and his ability is completely unique to him(well for now anyways because Ghostface kinda has it) so yeah I recommend Micheal as he is pretty unique and satisfying to play as
---
&gt; Never expect to escape.
---
all of your advice was good, but this is the best. if you can accept this, you'll have a much better experience.
---
Prove Thyself. Good for gen rushing and some extra blood points
---
Yeah... I think it's just for the consistency for how the notifications and status effects are handled in this game. Both these 2 perks stand out and are a huge annoyance in the community.
---
Yeah it's just players that do this seem to go unpunished
---
People can just yank the Ethernet cord

Ohtofu has gameplay review videos and how to use just about every pallet in the game and he‚Äôs recently been going over specific maps and best places to run killers. Highly recommend.
---
My first killer was Freddy but I didn't know he sucked ass back then. So I moved into playing Michael and man he's so much fun to play as. Want to scare the living hell out of someone? Play as Michael. Sometimes you can even grab someone of the gen because they don't pay attention.  
---
As for perks, level up Nurse and get Nurse's Calling. Then level up Leatherface and get BBQ. Two must perks for high rank (if you get there, which isn't hard at all)
---
I know for sure there was a website where people could submit builds for both killer and survivor, I just gotta find it.
---
Amazing work! Tbh i'm not a main hag, but hag has some awful skins, I expect to see her getting some skins, but would be awesome to have ur idea as skin on nurse too!
---
Oooh ok thanks. I‚Äôll consider him then, just questioning, how good and enjoyable is the clown to play anyway?
---
Trapper is at 31 and pig is at 14. Sorry the colors look too similar
---
Thanks
---
I think it's EPIC because you have the power to expose people with the Red Head's Finger which takes the same skill as a Huntress and are you saying Freddy and Ghostface's Power are any better?
---
Solid games vs Billy. Ill take a hard pass on that
---
The devs have stated everyone in game is 18+.  I have no clue how that works, but that is what they claim.
---
You remember both of the wind-up addons + tinkerer some time ago? It was the best of the best.
---
Thank you oink
---
Such a cry baby. Go take a dump or something if it happens. It isn't hostage either.
---
Ok thank you. I‚Äôm playing huntress atm due to how satisfying she is to play. I will get round to nurse soon though, I know she considerably the best one.
---
also can i not lose my offering pls k thx
---
Ye true
---
He is very weak at map pressure but great at ending chases he does need alot to make him work and has a decent learning curve, so I wouldn't recommend him as the first DLC you get and I'm kinda a Clown Main. He just can't handle people doing the objective that well which makes him kinda unfun to play.
---
I dont understand what you are trying to tell me.
---
Situational for me means, that its only useful in a situations which occure rarely. Which isnt really the case for all of those perks you just mentioned.
---
DH, BT and DS are all fine and really good perks.
---
i think he said 1000 sextillian steam cd keys. have fun!
---
No, not just that. 1k-5k bp's, 1 stack of wglf or bbq chili, the dc looses their item and a rank.
---
Remove every possible benefit.
---
Clown because he would probably have a pretty interesting move set and plus he is thicc
---
Is that a wraith, visible? üò±
---
That trapper looks dope though, amazing. And amagad the tiny trap!!
---
Nurse is gonna need a lot of practice btw
---
I mean it is; reddit is just filled with people too stubborn to learn how to play the game and that's all who devs listen to when it comes to balance.
---
**CRUNCH**
---
‚ÄúYOU FELL FOR IT YOU FOOL! CROSS BEARTRAP SPLITU ATTACK!‚Äù
---
For stealth. Nothing else. Barely any pallets for loops and terrible as killer because of all the boulders
---
Both have already been in MK tho
---
They‚Äôve already been in Mortal Kombat and OP was asking about original characters, not licensed ones.
---
That was why I suggested them üòú
---
That‚Äôs where the inspiration of the game came from
---
Oof
---
Meh you just gotta know where the pallets are and if you know how to loop you can loop them all day the pallets are really safe
---
That I use? Autodidact. I absolutely love how much time it saves me once I get the stacks going.  
---
The most underrated in general, however? Definitely Small Game. I don't use it, because at this point I've learned most of the possible Totem spawn locations, but gosh darn is it amazing for learning, well, exactly that.
---
You guys are just *mean*! Somebody will say something nice about me in the comments
---
Don't blame me for your ignorance. Google it and read, if you even can.
---
Your "side" was in an advantageous position before the extremely-reasonable nerfs. I get the salt but just tallying up buffs and nerfs over a period of time isn't a good way to look at where balance stands right now.
---
Thats exactly what I think the issue is. They are not necessarily OP, but extremly annoying to deal with. Even just having a totem counter(which there should be one ingame simply because of SWF) might be enough for NOED.
---
And if people think a totem counter would be too strong, you can still adjust afterwards by increasing the amount of totems on the map or whatssoever. People dont seem to understand that not giving players the information ingame which they can get via thirdparty/discord is extremly hurtful for balancing purposes
---
I agree with this, but it definitely shouldn‚Äôt be an instant open like with a key. It should take 15-20 seconds and like totems, if you let go the bar resets. I still doubt  many people would run it, but it would definitely serve a purpose at least. If not this, then maybe upon the hatch closing, a chest spawns which is guaranteed to have a key. So you‚Äôd have to find it first with the clock ticking down.
---
√ñ
---
Wake up it‚Äôs a gamble to use a gate only perk but at max level that 15% can be hell of a help
---
I have 1990 iridescent shards. You need 2000 to get a perk from the shrine of secrets
---
Cindy or Brenda from scary movie and they should have voicelines like Ash.
---
Ok this reply is borderline comical. Absolutely has to be a joke or troll of some sort. 
---
No one thinks that bringing a **med kit** into a game is toxic. It‚Äôs a basic healing item for fucks sake.
---
I‚Äôm going to put on your shoes for the sake of debate and assume you meant ‚Äúinsta heal‚Äù med kits, which once again, are rare and seen in maybe 10% of games and is only ever toxic if 3/4 survivors are running it.
---
Part of it is motivation.
---
Killers are the big important part of the game, they're the conflict.  The dev team wants to reward players for picking up and playing a difficult part of the game with more BP income.  Survivor is difficult in some regards, but killer is in general far more challenging.
---
i just *really* wanted to main Amanda as of recently for some reason
---
mainly because Nurse's Calling and Sloppy Butcher on a stealth killer works wonderfully well but also because Amanda is awesome
---
GlenOck is probably just kidnapping people and forcing them to join his Pig cult ya know the usual
---
I think it's the opposite. We need a 4:1 ratio. I can match into a game instantly as survivor. Takes 10+ minutes to find a game as killer sometimes
---
Finally I can deal with those damn libtards üëãüòé
---
Uhhh I'm dying inside. All these pig jokes but all the pigs I are are camping and tunneling AND nodding your heads like dicks on PS4, so theas jokes mean nothing.
---
No ... it's having sexual interest in prepubescent individuals.   Anyone who thinks it's related to age of consent is incorrect.
---
Looks like Billy's
---
Think they were just angry that I got out. One sent me a message calling me bad, so I started tea-bagging and I guess he thought I knew where the hatch was going to spawn
---
Never heard of him.
---
Well I am on PC so you never met me :( Also I can confirm that I am a skilled player don't worry.
---
Didn't have to use it because I was the last one. I think they thought I knew where the hatch was going to spawn, but I just took a guess
---
I've done that once or twice, I'm carrying the last survivor toward a hook, can't make it in time, but I hear the hatch so I just drop them and close it and let them bleed out. 
---
I'm sorry but I'm not seeing the problem here, it's not 'holding the game hostage" you whiny baby, there's a bleed-out timer.
---
The Doctor, Clown, Huntress and Wraith could have a lot of potential. It would also be cool if there was a Nurse skin for Ermac
---
Actually, they‚Äôre could be a doc skin for raiden, too
---
All good only took me 8 hours to make this
---
The Guy that literally just posts and comments about the pig. The Guy that says pig=upvote.
---
I agree with both of those options totally. Something about ‚Äútaking time to pry the hatch back open‚Äù and giving it 15-20 seconds I could totally get behind
---
Ooh nurse and huntress could be baeeee
---
I like your confidence
---
That's most of the multiplayer games these days, unless it's a game that is made for a more casual crowd it always devolves into elitism and it gets harder and harder for a new player to get into it, even if he wants. 
---
Most popular games have this problem especially the battle royale types. Put people who make a living from a game in the mix, smurfs, cheaters, boosters and you get the most awful multiplayer experience. Ladder anxiety was a very real thing for me in SC2 to the point where, I would play maybe two games in a week until I stopped completely.
---
I dont think DbD is a one of those titles, sure most of the player base are somehow entitled to an opinion of how you should play your game but overall they don't matter. It's easy to get into as a srart but  hard to master all the mind gaming, loops and time management. Play however the fuck you want and the only real loss is when you dc or you get like 600 points and cant renew items or addons.
---
Casual = Better
---
My revolution has started. Us Pigs will hide no more! You have 24hours to surrender or else we will TRIPLE the Pig posts.
---
I mean, I'm a red rank p3 pig main with all of the trophies. So I can't speak for survivors, but I can speak of survivors. I didn't mean sweaty as in sweaty, but as good. And if I didn't WANT to play against good people I wouldn't be red rank. People need to stop complaining about good players. Your good too if you play against them. And the skill gap between Good gray ranks and good yellow ranks is enough.
---
Hes like the biggest pig main on this sub. All he pretty much posts about is pig. Oink.
---
i wanna point out the fact that it is situational because there are rare times if you make good use of it since good killers will get everyone before the last gen to pop (unless they're playing swf) but when you manage to do the objective, it rewards you greatly, especially if you're in a chase. DH, BT and DS are also situational because the killer won't always camp, tunnel or fall for your DH (idk why i included DH since smart survivors will use it to make if faster to a window or pallet but i can say that i see a lot of survivors using DH to bait the killer like a rank 20). but i can't argue with you, all these 4 perks are great and i don't think they need a change, i'll rather want underrated perks to be changed so survivors won't be always "forced" to use the same shit over and over again to survive
---
You have been invited to the oinkers! If you would like to join: oink.
---
Twice the pigs, double the oinks
---
Oh.
---
oink
---
This part is true.
---
As far as buffering themselves, Survivors have many more options.  Any survivor can choose their 'power' (firecracker, flashlight, toolbox, medkit, key) and any addons associated with that item.  In addition, they can find other stuff in-trial, and they have the benefit of having multiple options if something they find isnt favorable mid-trial.  Both sides are able to use offerings.
---
Killers are dependant entirely on what they find in their bloodweb.  No ability to find things mid trial.  And killers are also stuck with the one ability they have.  That doesn't mean much really, but it speaks to the flexibility of survivors who are able to find their 'powers' through the bloodweb and pick through them freely.
---
Hi it's me. The Pig guy, I have like 50 posts and memes about Pig, I am a rank 1 P3 Pig players and I love her. You will get to know me sooner or later.
---
GlenOck have you considered making a subreddit just dedicated to the pig or not?
---
I did not! I tested them, those who had the will to live joined my cause.
---
I would have reduced the generators reqired to open the gates by 1 as well.
---
And here I thought that was suppose to be a threat. You‚Äôll have to try better than that!

Your invite will arrive in a couple of minutes, pls accept it when it arrives.

Oh man, we GOTTA get more merch with this awesome art on it!! Personally, my walls and shelves are covered with prints and figures, I'd be all over nice prints/posters and PVC figures. I also second the user who said to add this art to the loading screens! DBD has some of the coolest art of any game I play, I'd love to see y'alls hard work highlighted more!
---
\*Big OINK\*
---
Well I just got out of work. Wifeand I are celebrate our 3 years of marriage this Saturday and my paycheck is gonna be pretty spicy this friday. So yeah, life is pretty good rn, bud :)
---
Are you getting stressed playing Killer? Bro I think you should maybe try Survivor for a bit. Perhaps go play Civ.
---
I'm rank 8 and playing with a friend that was rank 5 and we are playing against rank 15 killers rn (srry for them)
---
You say "mind game" like you aren't just completely guessing \*unless\* you have Spine Chill and can properly infer what she's doing from it.
---
I need this in my life and i dont even play her!!
---
No , good survivors will win against billy almost everytime
---
Yeah lol
---
Well yeah, but the slowdown is barely noticable kinda like thanatophobia if you are hitting the great skill checks, and its a hex perk too meaning its eventually going to be disabled.
---
In addition while Ace's age is not given in game he's described as having grey hair and looking like "an ageing 50s movie star." It's probably safe to assume that, while Ace is likely younger than Bill by a good amount, he's probably at the very least as old as Ashley Williams and likely older by a few years.
---
Also judging by their lore Jane Romero is in her late 20s and Jeff is probably in his 40s. Don't know why I felt the need to bring that up but there that is.
---
They will join revolution.
---
I never tunnel people off the hook. Ever. Unless I see them sandbag a survivor, waste a pallet, or farm a teammate
---
No, its not rare that all gens get done. I dont have an issue with adrenaline itself, the issue I have is adrenaline combine with other exhaustion perks.
---
But yes, there are a lot of perks that need buffs. Maybe that would already thin out adrenaline
---
When ever it allows me to post there, I‚Äôll challenge the sub to convert me and see if they can make me meet my demise.
---
I think Ash is specifically 56. Iirc
---
Yeah IDK I just dont like LF, it always seemed like a bootleg billy.
---
It's a pretty bad map but it's not even close to some others imo. Haddonfield and mount Ormond come to mind
---
You cannot post? How do I give people rights to post?
---
I'll be sure to delete them later
---
Yeah I think it‚Äôs because if they kept the original ages the game‚Äôs age rating would be a lot higher (at least that‚Äôs what I heard)
---
Within 5 minutes all 3 other survivors disconnected. Wtf
---
I really liked the video. Keep up the good work!!
---
I'm using it with Jake's new tank top :( it has a lantern
---
great test then, because they got no data about the killer
---
Lol Sorry it was a joke. Sarcasm doesn't come off great on the internet.
---
This map is god awful for killer cause you can barely find anyone (unless you‚Äôre doctor). And survivor for this map sucks too, barely any pallets as far as the eye can see
---
How in the actual hell did your brain think this meme made sense?
---
What‚Äôs so bad about legion. I‚Äôve heard he‚Äôs pretty bad in the higher ranks.
---
Yep. Sad Ghostface probably won't have a nickname besides Jokeface though. Truly sad for all future GF mains . Guess I'm on a crusade for a new nickname for him
---
I try to slug everyone once before I hook anyone(not at once, and I dont camp them while they are slugged) but that way everyone gets like an extra try, however sometimes I'll randomly slug people if I feel like I'm running into them too often instead of just killing them. 
---
Should I just be hooking them?
---
I have no clue. Maybe it‚Äôs a timer thing? After a short while, it‚Äôll let me?
---
I think the best dlc to buy is the doctor bc he is the most enjoyable to play
---
We will see.
---
On console it‚Äôs the other way around. Only killer mains out there making it about a 10 minute wait time as a survivor. 10 second waiting as a killer was a long wait for me. On pc I found being killer was harder to find survivors..
---
The problem with dealing with dc is basically anchored deep in the game.
---
MMORPG basically said it pretty well a long time ago. People don't like losing control of their character, be it stuns or dying state or hooks. Add the fact that at low ranks killer think the most efficient way to play is to camp every hooks and it works. Now add the fact that you can end up playing vs a killer that is "cheap" (old legion for example) Or outright phobias. Now add unfair maps and a lack of veto to stay away from those (we're all looking at you The game and haddonfield/springwood.).
---
Before they even think about trying to punish dcs they have to AT LEAST start fixing the reason for the dcs. 
---
People don't dc JUST because of a lack of punishment
---
Love it
---
No I'm not.  You as a killer are literally holding their game hostage for 2 minutes so you can waste their time, and bm your way to your 4k.  There is no strategy involved in using egc to kill the 4th slugged survivor.  You could do the right thing and end their game by hooking them for your 4k at any point but you choose not to for lols.  It isn't reportable but it is definitely needless bm.
---
Griefing is purposefully messing with players. Playing with a survivor and chasing them for 2 minutes straight just to mess with them instead of killing them is griefing.
---
Oh really? "Just a parody", huh?
---
Alright, how would you feel if I said all of those things, but replaced white and Asian with black?
---
Would you still have no objections...?
---
I didn't know this character was from a parody movie either.
---
I mean, you replied to a clearly serious comment with "is this a joke?" Most people who don't believe anti-white racism exists also want to kill all white people.
---
*chuckles*
---
 Im in danger.
---
Peace offering
---
I think it'd be kind of a cool side objective to maybe "collect" the skulls of totems and put them in the killers shack or something on a display for extra points. Or the basement if you're really looking to make it harder on survivors.  A totem counter would be awesome though just in general.
---
I went into a kyf game with my friend who had never played, I at this point had been playing for a week and a half and I was a natural at being killer. I found out that he had to find the hatch and he found it before me.
---
I had thought that i could be killer and he be survivor as well as 3 other randoms being survivor as well, I was wrong and he found the hatch and escaped.
---
He then immediately declared dead by daylight to be trash and uninstalled it at that point. I tried explaining that it‚Äôs actually more then just finding the hatch before the killer but  he would not have any of it kinda like one of those people who think they‚Äôre always right from r/entitled parents
---
I was like ok your loss it‚Äôs a good game but ok (we both have it off game pass and he has a negative view of everything on it unless he was told about it from someone who he likes playing with and I‚Äôm not one of them we only play because one of my other friends makes us because it‚Äôs not fun playing gta without him, on top of that said person that hates dead by daylight won‚Äôt even try a reap game he‚Äôs such a idiot
---
legion is in highschool
---
Calling someone sweaty is not calling them good, it's basically saying this player will use every dirty trick/tactic they can to win. They don't necessarily have to better or smarter than you. You can play fairly and be nice and still stay in red ranks, it just takes skill instead. So if you want to call someone good, don't use that word lol.
---
I mean 19 is legal /s
---
The nonverbal way of me saying ‚ÄúDear Killer, for showing grace for not murdering me, I offer you this humble sacrifice of my bloodpoints in physical form.‚Äù
---
Poor birds!
---
&gt;Not really...its a fact..especially the way you reacted to it.
---
So despite me saying I'm not a survivor main you seem to be bent on me being a Survivior main. Gotcha
---
&gt;If I am not obliged to pick up every survivor I down than no every survivor is obliged to escape alive
---
Your goal is to kill Surviviors. Theirs is to escape. Slugging them isn't an inherently toxic strategy unless they're all in the dying state and you are just letting them bleed out without just ending the game there. At that point there's no hope for them and ur just letting them all die on the floor like a dick. 
---
&gt;one of the reasons hatch closing exists now.
---
It was brought back as one of the two ways to end the hatch standoff. You can close it, but now you can't interrupt a hatch escape. 
---
&gt;The issue presented was simple. Being punished for running into that survivor again and downing them...what if they are all the same character or you simply forget which one it was that got unhooked recently.
---
Then you made a mistake and didn't pay attention. And you got punished for it. Why suddenly are killers the only ones allowed to make mistakes and not get penalized for it. 
---
&gt;Like I said...once that person unhooked loses chase of killer (ESCAPES and IS NOT being TUNNELED) it shouldnt be transferred to them 50 secs later...it can easily be abused...
---
Not really. You seem to be overestimating how long 60 seconds is. I'd argue it's perfectly balanced. It punishes you for trying an inherently unfair strategy
---
Alert. I love it.
---
They were following them around on the ground, because they were slugged. The killer picked OP up, heard the hatch, then dropped them and closed it, and allowed either the bleed out timer or the ECG to finish the job. That isn't a reportable offense.
---
You should have omitted the parts about exposed and RBT add ons. Keep it simple, and nobody gets confused, dude. 
---
What do you want it to do? It already counters a lot of add ons, and some perks, plus it buffs survivors with exhaustion.
---
Maybe it should actually include standing still for X seconds, and everyone who stands with you in X radius can recover from exhaustion while running, or all afflictions are cured? Like holding an actual vigil. Or, everyone in X radius will have auras hidden, and it can work against scratched mirror. 
---
Throw out solid ideas, and you get positive feedback. Rant and complain, and you have to take what you get.
---
Are you sure? I recall the percentages being lower a while back.
---
Well either dead or he found a way out. If Vigo is as smart as he is, then he might have found a way to escape
---
There is nothing wrong with slugging, it's a valid strategy. Though it can be really annoying and boring if you have all 4 slugged but refuse to hook any of them, but doesn't sound like you do that.
---
bugs in this game don't surprise me anymore lol I just try to avoid em if i know about em
---
So, you're gonna make a good part of the game inaccessible for people who say can't hit past rank 15-12? (No, I'm not one of them...I'm rank 4-5) I'm gonna say Nah on this one fam. It's a nice idea but not one that would be helpful if you're just plain not good at the game but play anyways.
---
Why would they nerf probably one of the most useless perks in the game. I just don't get these devs sometimes if anything it should've been buffed by upping the precentage it gives
---
Then I agree with the meme.
---
Okay fair point, I didn't mean creep everywhere, but I know some new players literally run all the time and wonder why they get hooked. But once urban evasion is available i tend to sneak by default, then run when I know it's definitely safe to do so
---
Even still, BMing is. And that's what was happening. BMing is griefing. If she had just slugged and walked away or even just stood there, it wouldn't of been griefing, but dropping them just to circle them and puke on them is
---
I was gonna be upset by you attacking me and calling me a nerd, but it was so telegraphed i sprint bursted away.
---
I appreciate that the Claudine is hiding
---
Ummmm.. how has no one said david?
---
Swf stands for "survive with friends" it means 2 or more people are grouped and likely in some kind of voice chat
---
Why exactly?
---
17 years old is at or above the age of consent in most of the world, and even in most of America
---
Is the american movies tradition of 30 yo high school students
---
They already had the kills, but the Kobe took them away. I don't really see a problem with someone getting a lucky escape, when you see so many people give up before the match really gets going. In this forum we have to set the bias aside and look at it from an objective perspective. 
---
We should all admire her for playing the game, and not disconnecting, or giving up. That tenacity is rare, and her grace under pressure is harder to pull off than the sick hook tech.
---
So killers have different lunge distances?
---
Bruh what are you on about, just because it‚Äôs the lore from 1 doesn‚Äôt make it cannon that they are siblings, for all we know the Laurie pulled didn‚Äôt make it through the first one.

If I see another Pig Tier List Imma yeet myself off the edge of the Sun
---
They are too human. Well apart from Nea
---
for some reason I thought the change was coming this week, but its next week.
---
We can only dream right
---
Yeah that's certainly BM, but OP seems focused on the morality of refusing to hook at the end of the game, it's in his title. Even wants it bannable. I mean I don't love getting teabagged but it would be dumb to punish it, if they're not cheating or making threats in chat then we kind of have to deal with it or police ourselves, especially when it comes to valid in-game plays like not hooking a survivor. Technically all the killer did "wrong" here was taunting, which I agree is BM.
---
You're missing the point big time here. My point, to which you've just agreed to, is that the hatch is an option. I never said that you have to play hatch only all the time every time.
---
P3 Michael. But they're all great. Brilliant work!
---
You don't have to fail a grade to be 18. You just have to have your birthday be before your graduation date.
---
For example, if you were born in February 2000 and you graduate in June 2018. You will graduate while you are 18. If you were born in October 2000 and graduate in June 2018, you will graduate while you are 17 but will turn 18 later that year.
---
3:13 "family reunion"
---
Okay. I'm sorry for this argument then. We were both arguing eachother on points the other purrson wasn't making. I agree that slugging, camping, or what have mew isnt bannable in any way. Irritating, yes, but not bannable
---
I'm also fairly new. I started with the trapper and now the legion. Both are frustrating (legion more so) but when everything comes together correctly they're a blast. For example, when playing the trapper and a survivor thinks they're going to escape and then SNAP, it's trap and hook time. Or when you get multiple traps going off at the same time. The Legion has a frenzy ability that you can use to chain attacks on multiple survivors to apply deep wounds (i think that's the debuff) and if done correctly  feels so rewarding. His play style is more wound and track, which I think will get better once I get more powers unlocked. Ultimately what I like about both is they're challenging to play. (I'm sure all of them are, but my exp is with those two)
---
I really don't think McCote writes the official promo material for the game but aiight
---
Nah, but a neon light should appear over the head of a player that DC's for the next 5 games and it should be an unwritten law to not save them.
---
Nope I did get reported today for finding a survivor at the start of the match and catching up to him(was playing Clown btw) he also disconnected and sent the footage to Bhvr which he probably didn't and if he did he could get banned for disconnecting which made me laugh my ass off. You're good dude if they don't have any evidence you cheated then and you haven't gotten reported multiple times in let's say a week then you are in the clear.

I mean I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre thinking. Shit they could think you‚Äôre cray with the whole ‚Äúthis must be hate against whites‚Äù thing you got goin on.

And the same can be said to you. How do you know everyone‚Äôs pc (doesn‚Äôt make sense if you‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre pc AND hates whites. You can‚Äôt be pc and still do that ) and will downvote it for that reason.
---
And if you‚Äôre only talking about me I don‚Äôt hate you bc you‚Äôre white. I don‚Äôt hate white people lol just bc I‚Äôm telling you that a parody movie with a parody character is just a joke doesn‚Äôt mean I want all whites to die lmao

I‚Äôm still sure this is a joke. That or you‚Äôre some sad boy migtow hating the ‚Äúmen hate‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite hate‚Äù just bc an old movie made jokes that were meant to be dumb. 
---
also I will double post. I‚Äôll triple post if I have to until I‚Äôm done saying what I want to say. Don‚Äôt worry that also doesn‚Äôt mean I hate whites too mate lol
---
Also probably ask if you don‚Äôt know? Bc then you‚Äôre jumping into something not knowing shit getting offended for literally no reason at all. Over a parody at that
---
Where‚Äôs the salt
---
Probably, but tbh I think the key to experiencing less toxicity is to stop burdening other players with hurt fee fees like you're doing, to start acting like a big boy and not taking shit so personally. People are going to get pissed from getting slugged or teabagged or tunneled or rushed or clicked or whatever, and you can't expect  Mommy and Daddy to come in and design it out of their game for you. Some stuff that exists in DBD is really dumb, like being able to bodyblock a survivor in a basement and legitimately take a player hostage. But whining like a lil baby over having waiting out a timer once in a while is pointless.
---
Killers use a lot more BP than a survivor does though.
---
A pallet the killer can easily move around. Like if there‚Äôs just a small obstacle next to the pallet, it‚Äôs not safe. If there‚Äôs a lot of room to run, you can drop it and it takes the killer some time to come around to the other side if they choose to not break it immediately.
---
Thanks for the answers.
---
Ha at the rate of dc's I'll be a bloodpoint millionaire by no time!
---
Leatherface was in mkx
---
As long as they're not swf, sure.
---
Trapper
---
Yikes
---
I hate Ormond. There‚Äôs random little piles of these tiny ass rocks that you get stuck on and it drives me nuts.
---
I just visit the 6 lockers in the shack (if basement is there) if if the killer finds you once, chances are you‚Äôre dead so it may be boring to be a locker bitch but at least gens get done and people make it out.
---
So what about the Entity then?  How old is Entity-sama?
---
Don‚Äôt forget the game
---
10,000
---
Yeah it's all good, I realized what you were saying and it doesn't seem like we disagree.
---
There we go that clears it up
---
I just don't get survivors some times. Like oh we are on suffocation Pit one of the most notorious maps to get 3genned on allow me just to do all the gens on this side. Or like you said cleansing then getting sick instantly.
---
Lol I'm done with your dumbass.  Jeep cheerleading for mindless bm bro.
---
Sorry, need to clearify it. They send me some messages and invited me into a PS4 Party complaining about getting killed :D
---
That's nice you made that for him. Spot on !
---
They never nerfed thanatophobia? You‚Äôre probably recalling back to when they were testing the numbers on a PTB which would go all the way up to 24% but it never made it to the live version so therefore means it wasn‚Äôt nerfed. It was just a test that didn‚Äôt make it live.
---
Yea it is Billy's chainsaw chewing into the back of Claudette :D
---
There‚Äôs an add on called Black Incense which reveals survivor‚Äôs auras for 5 seconds after they puke. Considering you do nothing but fucking puke when you‚Äôre infected it‚Äôs basically infinite aura tracking. I got finger blasted by this a few times and since then I just cleanse.
---
Will do, keep pissing yourself with rage every time you get BM'd or """""held hostage"""""" lmao
---
OK Michael, you can stop stalking me now, I think you're getting to know me a little *too* well &lt;_&lt;
---
Anyone else think ranks should start at 10 or something and from there you can derank if you're bad/new/dont care instead of everybody starting already at the lowest
---
Assuming a 100% chance of someone being found since she likely would have checked all lockers, there's the 50% chance it was the nea and the 50% chance of her taking the far door, so really more like a 25% chance. Of course for the stars to align into the whole situation to begin with... priceless.
---
Ways to cut down on dc's:
---
-Remove "Leave Game" option from the menu.
---
-1st offense results in 1 hour suspension of whatever role was dc'd from (if a survivor disconnects from the game they can only play killer for one hour and vice versa).
---
-2nd offense 30 minute ban an all gameplay except for the tutorial.
---
-3rd and every offense after 1 hour ban on all gameplay.
---
-punishments reset daily.
---
People who were going to troll and sandbag already do, regardless of blood points. If you think that this change would incentivize even more trolling, then that means you believe these trolls care about blood points still. And if they do, the greater amount of blood points earned through playing the game normally would, logically, disincentivize sandbagging and trolling.
---
The argument you're presenting is that we'd see a rise in sandbagging and trolling tactics by offering some consolation blood points for the players that remain. I don't believe that would happen. Furthermore, it seems to me that this system would reduce the impact of players who are on the receiving end of sandbagging players' shenanigans. If you have a neon Nea running around the map, dropping all pallets and disconnecting all in the first two minutes, then your game is still ruined but at least you're going home with more bloodpoints than under the current system.
---
I don't play Plague so I didn't know about that add on. That sounds OP as fuck until the survivors catch on and cleanse
---
I get that the topic of the post is about dc's, but this persons comment is just talking about bloodpoints , and doesn't mention about dc's at all.
---
On that topic though, I think incentivising disconnections for survivors even more is a bad idea. Yes, it would help those that don't.. But it would incentivise those that do, even more.
---
There needs to be more punishment for the dc'er, not more rewards for those that remain.
---
It's really good, but it's a pink one, so you go against it as often as you get a iri head huntress or a tombstone Myers.
---
I didn‚Äôt know about it either until I got smoked by a Plague and looked at her loadout in the post game. It‚Äôs like I have PTSD now and just assume they can see me when I puke so I just cleanse asap.
---
It is great to hide in the bamboo bushes as a survivkr. Absolutely love it. :v
---
Why did you repost this crap?
---
Awww that pig is adorable
---
Is it yours OP?
---
And if it is, can we see more of it?
---
Ah okay. Seems fair enough
---
Wanna talk about useless? How about monsterous shrine
---
The Entity could have taken someone at a later point in their life. Just because Laurie was a teenager in the movie doesn't necessarily mean that she was taken by the Entity as a teenager, she could have been taken years down the line.
---
Okay, even if both of them were adults, just ew. Do people actually think they look cute together?
---
Very much this. I have been running itemless for a while on survivor now.
---
To do that with most killers, you'd be lucky to get an average of 2 kills, if not less.
---
I like the huntress, so satisfying to pull off, the doctors fun too.
---
I didn't think they were there to fool the survivors, I figured they were a reminder that the killer shares in your 'madness' and that you're being tracked with it. But yeah it would be cool if there were some more mind game potential with them. Sometimes I use his purple terror radius add-on with Monitor and Abuse, it makes it easy to sneak up on them and maybe the illusions help with that, I don't know.
---
Monsterous shrine at least let's you sacrifice faster, territorial imperative does even less
---
I know It is a fetish and it exists but that doesn't mean it isn't weird
---
i played against a doctor with insidious once, who was great. I ran into the building to do a gen, went upstairs and saw an illusion (i was already in tier 2 madness).
---
i ran through the doctor and was surprised when i collided right into him and got clobbered. it was great! i was not expecting that.
---
Thank you! Yeah, the P3 Michael is one of my favorites, too!
---
Just had a Wind walking p3 wraith with ebony mori at rank 15. How much fucking fun. Definitely what I'd like to encounter if I was a natural rank 15 survivor. SMFH.
---
Noob3?
---
Awesome! When I put her together, I add tiny little plastic shards to make it look like glass.  I have this one on my desk.
---
Feng looks adorable. &lt;3
---
I'll have to make one soon! :P
---
The number of times I get stuck in tall grass before realizing I ran into the last survivor I‚Äôve been looking for for about 15 minutes.
---
I said that...
---
I thought it was nerfed back to 16% because of Legion. I thought they would buff it again after the rework, rip.
---
Piggy, because off jumpscaring.
---
*cough* ^XII *cough*
---
It doesn't work after death because it would be too op. A dead survivor slows the game by itself, it doesn't need another nerf to speed.
---
Fully accurate and support this üëå
---
I‚Äôm lucky that my friends tried dbd.  They also fell off immediately the moment they fought against a killer with anything but the base perks.
---
Randy from scream as a survivor and as a killer main I‚Äôd always prefer more victims
---
16 is legal in canada I‚Äôm fine
---
Legion
---
There‚Äôs a guy on eBay called ‚Äútrusted code seller‚Äù or something like that. HybridPanda buys giveaway codes from him and has good success. Maybe check him out.
---
No you
---
*get outplayed by this comment biych*
---
&gt;Black Incense is very good and very underrated as an add-on. Combine it with an Apple and after you made everyone broken and if nobody wants to cleanse ( good survivors won't cleanse against Plague before the end game ), you can get the Corrupt Purge from the already corrupted fountain and now you see the auras of all survivors from the entire map, all survivors are broken and don't how you got Corrupt Purge and now you have Corrupt Purge for an entire minute. With this combo, you can destroy entire teams and your snow ball potential as Plague is considerably increased. Also, with Black Incense you can see even the survivors from the ground  ( apparently survivors vomit even on the ground ) so this add-on gives you an Deerstalker build in and it helps you slugging them ( and you should slug them if you use the combo with the Apple ).
---
agreed.
---
It‚Äôs used to be 6%/9%/12%/15% tier 3 and then they changed it to 4%/8%/12%/16% so I guess it‚Äôs a nerf for the first 2 injured survivors but that‚Äôs about it. The 24% for all injured was just in ptb it was never in live version. they had the wrong description in the live version but the numbers were and are the 4/8/12/16 in the game system.
---
thank you, ppreciate it
---
Pedophilia is sexual attraction for kids. The correct word is ephebophilia, and it's not illegal.
---
Both killers and survivors have no idea where the hell they are going because half the time your vision comprises of literally just tall grass
---
Survivors are more helped than hindered but if your panicked you can really easily get downed because of the grass blindness
---
It's not pedophilia a 17 years old, it's ephebophilia and it's not illegal.
---
Think it needs to be bigger?
---
It's SO hard to find his coveralls or make them though
---
Once we get dedicated servers the d/cers will start getting banned. Incentive wouldn‚Äôt be there anymore
---
I think, the person who  disconnects should lose points. Or else people could just mess with the system and farm points.
---
I think the point he is making is that means they only tested the broken version of GF in the PTB. Once fixed, how do they check that the fixed version works?
---
Basically nobody can successfully Stalk. So they'll likely have no data about successful Stalking.
---
As a survivor, I don't tend to try hard at all except when someone disconnects near the beginning. At that point, I know the team is really going to need my help.
---
It actually is. No matter what it‚Äôs creepy and yall just keep going. Seventeen is still a minor lol and it doesn‚Äôt make it any better.
---
This statistic doesn't state how many SWF there are per rank, because I've found that there are much more SWF at rank 1.
---
It is from r/Aww just saw it and thought of the meme it shouldn't be to hard to find there.
---
Claudette, Dwight, Meg, and David
---
Zone defense
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it. I would be lying if I said I‚Äôve never gotten frustrated at a new player hiding in a locker all game; however, everyone starts from somewhere and that is just part of any game. 
---
Deranking isn‚Äôt that big a hassle (imo) and I guarantee that people will completely forget about the game with a bad player by the next day. Don‚Äôt be scared to play! I know we portray the game as toxic but ignore them, move on, improve yourself and don‚Äôt let a 10 minute game ruin your day or experience!
---
His instant down is harder to set up than Leatherface's, and LF is low tier.
---
My theory is Ghostface made Amanda popular by doing the same thing worse.
---
Nothing in the game that says they're not siblings. Seems like the sibling theory is one point above the non-sibling theory.
---
and then they immediately go cleanse again
---
And those 1000 BP should come from those who DC
---
Ah, misunderstood, I thought you meant you wanted leatherface
---
Well i mean if they keep teabagging after every pallet and window it starts getting annoying, therefore it disrupts my fun and from that point on the slugging game shall commence.
---
bahaha, 1k DEFINITELY isn‚Äôt enough.
---
*sneak fails*
---
"Hey! I said don't turn around!"
---
"Oh, I didn't"
---
I like Lithe and Dance with Me, from feng and Kate, it's a dirty combo, plus I use bond and whatever else. Usually my last perk is whatever I'm feeling
---
This is even more flawed logic. There are game companies who make sure to go through several iterations of their test patches, and game companies who don't. The former tend to have much better live releases than the latter. Behavior is one of the latter, and it's been shown again and again that it's a problem. Trying to call out someone for not knowing *exactly* how the process works while ignoring that the gist of their issue is a real issue is much worse than being wrong about the heart of the issue.
---
First it's not a fetish, it's a preference. Second, I didn't say it was my preference (and you don't even know my age), I pointed out that op was misleading information. Third, if you don¬¥t like ,that doesn¬¥t mean you can go calling it weird. For people like you homosexuality and the like were treated like a bad thing, ignorants.
---
I hate that argument though, it's basically the "just do generators" argument.
---
I play dbd to play the game, not m1 simulator for blood points.
---
Keep in mind I also report those afk cloaked wraiths that queue up just to depip. I had another survivor tell me not to report them because it's free blood points for us (totems, survival, objectives, etc points). It is literally a reportable offense and it's even listed as an example as one. I queue up for dbd to play the game.
---
Whether you're an insidious leather face or an afk wraith, you're not actually playing the game. It's boring as hell.
---
Seems my  huntress. Level 40 still no sign of ruin BBQ or nurse's Calling :l
---
Toxic gameplay spawns toxic gameplay loo
---
Although I fancy Michael I think you should get Hag first, for the perks(eg ruin, devour) and for the map pressure it applies compared to m1 killers
---
BuT bHvR sAiD aLl ChArActErS aRe 18+
---
If theres at least two dc in the first 5 minutes, remaining survivors should auto safety pip.
---
Then they complain about you using ruin when they have dead hard, M.O.M., self care, sprint burst, adrenaline, etc.
---
You're annoying af...  hook them and end the match..
---
Someone‚Äôs a pedo
---
I stopped counting after the 150th blood web, tbh. It's a rough life.
---
Nobody cares *why* you're toxic. 
---
You wanna play that way do it. If you don't, don't.
---
*specifically trapper
---
Just don‚Äôt care about the game. I personally don‚Äôt get the whole obsession with toxicity and getting worked up over it.
---
Killers don't need ruin in general lol
---
If you need it, you're bad at staling the game and pressuring survivors off of gens
---
Then when the answer is yes you get pallet town, the preschool, or haddonfield
---
LmaO
---
I don't think anyone can convince you not to take your anger out on people that didn't do anything to you. I know it's hard to be the bigger person when you're playing a game notorious for its toxicity, but if it's getting to that point, maybe you should take a break.
---
Bond is the best survivor perk, I feel nude when I don't use it, give it a try
---
Toxicity breeds toxicity. But idm you being toxic to those that are toxic.
---
Blood borne would be an amazing cross over tbh
---
You can't give someone something they haven't earned. This would make the DC problem worse. The best way to fix this is to have people lose points for frequently disconnecting.
---
Me as Survivor: No safe pallets, easy mindgame walls, WHY IS THERE A FUCKING ROCK HERE, why can‚Äôt I vault this tree like on Pale Rose (you know that fucking dumb ass log that you get trapped in like a doofus) 
---
Me as killer: Fatshame area, fatshame area, fatshame area, I can‚Äôt go around this rubble because THESE bamboo are solid, where y‚Äôall mf at? üò©üò©üò©üò©, what am I stuck on? This isn‚Äôt even stealth, David is just standing there.
---
Could also be because of the items they wanted to use. Some players just don't have luck and won't get items they want on a survivors. Also like others have said some times they just want to play as a different model.
---
I've found they often are. I make sure to thank them at the end of the game if a pallet they wasted leads to someone else dying because I'm slightly toxic like that.
---
Why? If the relationship is consensual, everyone can have sex with everyone. I'm 20 and I also like men over 40, what's the problem
---
If I body block the basement, but message them to let them know I'll stop doing it tomorrow, is that OK in your book since I gave them a timer? Or is pointlessly prolonging the game a dick move even if it isn't literally forever?
---
Billy is #1 most seen for me in high ranks. Other than him it's Michael or Spirit.
---
Honestly a big brain gamer
---
Billy
---
Enjoy the game more, disable post match chat and boom! you are free
---
You arent gonna get any positive feed back on dbd reddit it's full of toxic lame ass killer mains that can do no wrong in dbd... it's rather pathetic and sad.
---
But I feel ya on this... my friends will just DC and say fuck em... we wanna move on to the next match..  everyone is like oh it's just 2 minutes.. it's a huge waste of time. Especially if its multiple matches this is happening.  Just hook them and end it.
---
Survivors with chainsaws too op. Plz nerf
---
I don't get the D/C after first down. Especially the game was already going on for several mins. There should have 30k bp penalty if someone intentionally press "Leave Game". 
---
Don't get me wrong. I d/c myself but it's either, 2 already d/c within 2 mins of the game. Or. Firat down and received series of bad unhooks and intentionally tunneled. But only it's my last hook.
---
Just because a small group of people on the internet tell you it isnt weird doesn't mean it isn't weird. We actually went the opposite way because they used to marry young children off to older men all the time. We have figured out that is fucked up and wrong and since moved on from that.
---
Blood Gift: Instantly heal a survivor by performing a difficult skill check to give them one of your heal states.
---
Entities Spy: If your aura would be read by a survivor, their aura is revealed to you as well.
---
are you confessing? cause thats not the kind of thing you wanna admit 
---
have you sought therapy over this?
---
Billy boi
---
Yep, Laurie and Michael's descriptions are more "obscure" while Quentin's one is quite big and apparent. Devs have said that all character all of legal age but some stuff stills sounds suspicious anyway.
---
Yeah a fucking wraith can pressure the gens like nobodys business. Honestly some killers really need it. It depends on the survivors really. You want to be able to at least get a hook or 2 before 3 gens get done. If you would go against a good Team (solo) and chase one with say the wraith and you down the guy 3 gens are easily done. Not mentioning how that would end with Prove Thyselves or swf. It just helps to slow the game down just a lil bit.
---
This is so true
---
Devs released stats of this type of stuff. Billy is top, Myers 2nd, and Huntress or Spirit was 3rd.
---
Today I learned Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Ash (Bruce Campbell) are the exact same age irl, thanks to this post. 
---
It makes me wonder why the entity chose Laurie as a teenager but not Ash when he was younger?
---
This post was brought to you by the Red Rank Survivor but Yellow Rank Killer gang
---
I don‚Äôt care what your preference is ,it‚Äôs not my business but a minor is a different story. If people think it‚Äôs gross and weird they have that right. It isn‚Äôt normal and it‚Äôs fucked up. Just because people on the internet band together and decide it‚Äôs okay in their eyes does not mean it‚Äôs legal or normal in the majority of places.
---
Just remember the other people in your games are actual human beings and likely just want to have a little fun with their free time. To quote Bill and Ted: 
---
‚ÄúBe excellent to each other.‚Äù
---
Billy. Because without 1 shots youre basically fckd in this game at high rank.
---
Most killers except Billy, Nurse, and Hag have a general lack of map pressure. Depends on the map of course too. Basically M1 killers like Clown get dumpstered in terms of gen pressure since he just can't apply it.
---
What's M1?
---
So not worth a perk spot
---
Do you seriously camped with Insidious ?
---
Cause that's when Ash was in his prime. But more importantly why choose Ash at all? Why bring someone who'd logically destroy every killer in a fight?
---
Nah, I‚Äôm just always an angry person.
---
yep, I lost all progress I did yesterday.. and I had a lot of time yesterday and was basically playing the whole damn day. Wrote a ticket and they said they would compensate me. (This is on PC)
---
Killbilly. Almost every game I go into I hear that damned chainsaw in the first 5 seconds.
---
If a team of Rank 1 Survivors can‚Äôt beat a Rank 1 Doc they‚Äôre trash and shouldn‚Äôt be Rank 1. Solo or not.
---
Im in America and age of consent is 16 in my state, so... your point?
---
Um I have to disagree and say sheltered woods that maps had like 6 pallets and lots of open areas and dead zones..
---
I just said that I couldn't make a hook in time, especially when three survivors are dead and the hooks haven't respawned. There's perks specifically for slugging though so just get over it, and even ones that counter it if it rustles your jimmies so much.
---
Ohhh I should have slugged the bastard!  I was so bent on getting him out of the map I didn‚Äôt think of that as an option for better revenge!
---
Right?! Probably why they gave him such an over powered perk lol
---
You get less points in general for steamrolling survivors. You probably 1-hooked 2-3 survivors, which mean you chased/hit/hooked/used your power less. In Myers' case, a good Myers gets the bulk of his chase points from "Survivor Found" events, they give like 200-300 each. 
---
Myers is an ambush killer, he's designed to end chases before they begin.
---
When I dominate a team with 5 gens up, I'll usually hook 2 then pick up the 3rd guy, carry him to a hooked teammate and let him wiggle off, though these days crybaby survivors usually DC/suicide before I can do this.
---
Also, don't bother with the rank system. It's a total shitshow right now, just have fun, fuck rank.
---
I see a lot of trappers in red ranks...
---
&gt; Lower rank better/less sweaty trials.
---
tell that to the ruin instasaw ebony mori billies at yellow and green ranks. there are plenty of them out there.
---
Took you quicker to do this than it do get exposed with him
---
Same with Billy, Huntress and Nurse. Since you end chases so fast, it sometimes counts as if you lost it.
---
Yeah for sure, so it gives incentive for not killing the obsession but also encourages you to bully them. Drags the game out without actually killing anyone assuming you do it right.
---
Spirit for PS4
---
Would blood gift work with solidarity? Meaninf you would insta heal them as well as half healing yourself?
---
Did they dc halfway through or when they first say you/got downed?
---
Dammit that was me before.  I was rank 16. With like level 1-2 perks. Got bullied by them level 5-8 survivors haha
---
You don't play much killer do you, pressuring maps like haddonfield or asylum can be really hard on some killers like doctor or huntress if the survivors know what they are doing and ruin really helps to relieve pressure. Not saying for all killers but certain ones do need with gens getting done in under 40 second
---
Infectious Fright is probably better than Third Seal for a slugging build.
---
Also, I hate you.
---
epic
---
https://imgur.com/a/5lmUoCY
---
heres what they look like in game
---
I have a _slight_ feeling you're just being sarcastic/pretentious but still, nothing annoys survivors more than getting slugged.
---
Epic game moment.
---
The boring same ones, Billy, Nurse &amp; Spirit.
---
You are saying that its weird without even explaining why.  I get you are using common sense to justify it, but that ¬¥s an excuse to not think. Like I said, It¬¥s not a small group of people, try sexology on google. Can¬¥t believe op was trying to troll people and a lot fell for it.
---
Within a rolling 3 day time frame this is probably best. 3 days because people like me legitimately only dc from a crash or hardware malfunctuon or such.but tbh who does this on purpose yet less than 3 times in 3 days?
---
I love playing Jane with her tight jeans and striped peasant shirt with the ponytail and now. I love playing really femme survivors so I feel like it‚Äôs the perfect cosmetic.
---
There is some counterplay to Mettle. Not very good or reliable counterplay, but you could bring Rancor and ignore the obsession all game only to One Punch Mori them at the end which I do with Freddy all the time. If multiple survivors are running MoM you're kinda screwed though. You could always tunnel off the hook with a Mori or something.
---
After the first down.
---
The reason it's harder is because to get iridescence quality for sacrifice you need 9+ hooks, so if someone DCs immediately, you need to hook everyone the max number of times.
---
Exactly but what gets me is my random solo teammates will run out the gates when I‚Äôm the last one hooked and the killer isn‚Äôt running NOED and they know it, then when the killer is running NOED the whole team comes for the rescue and they all end up dead! 
---
Beats the hell out of me, over the weekend all I gotta say is the purple rank people can go fuck themselves! I don‚Äôt know how many times I would be hooked and also running bond to see what my teammates were up to and guess what? They weren‚Äôt doing shit! If the killer wasn‚Äôt camping they were just standing around doing nothing, while I died on the hook and they weren‚Äôt even doing gens or totems, blew my mind. I depiped back to 9 because of a bunch of shit games and the green ranks were running around like a bunch of Seals on a mission, best games I had for the rest of the evening!
---
It really depends on at what point we're referencing him being a "50s movie star." If he was taken by The Entity in the 1990s that would put him at around 60, while him being taken in the same year that Of Flesh and Mud was released (2016) would put him at a whopping 86 years.
---
The fact is: 17 years old is age of consent, and it's normal having preferences. It's not illegal and it's not fucked up. It's 2019 sweety, sex is not a taboo.
---
She doesn't need it, but she can run it. Good survivors also don't need exhaustion perks to loop well, but nobody stop them to use these perks. Also, I notice that Nurses without Ruin are more confident than Nurses with Ruin and they tend to run Infectious Fright and slug everyone and trust me, you're better dealing with a Ruin Nurse than a slugging Nurse.
---
Frank was a dropout, and I believe the backstory suggests it's been a while since they would have graduated anyway.
---
But like, you're saying you don't have to rely on others. And for the game to be anything more than a crapshoot, you do. You need others to unhook you, you need others to run the killer long enough to do gens, or to do gens while you run the killer. You need other people to do well, and just because the possibility of escaping alone exists does not make you any less reliant on other people to consistently escape.
---
That's the dumbest false equivalency I heard all day and I'm in like three separate discussions about NOED. Bodyblocking the basement is bannable on it's face and isn't/shouldn't be a mechanic, I'm sure we agree. Not only is slugging an actual in-game mechanic, but it's supported by perks dedicated to it. It can be annoying to lose to a legit strategy sometimes, sure, but that's not the same thing as your opponent cheating or forcing you to disconnect. The killer seemed like a dick in OP's scenario though, no disagreement there.
---
This makes no sense. Ofcourse disconnects can be "fixed". Fixed doesnt mean that people wont do it anymore or wont be able to do it anymore.
---
Fixing DCs means that people who get salty and would just leave and move on to the next game, will actually think twice about it because they could be put on a timeout after that or get some other punishment.
---
I have everything unlocked on 3 seperate characters and I like to just switch between them for no reason. It doesnt have to be as deep as you are making it
---
Man I‚Äôm glad my boy David is of age
---
...3 hours?
---
Really your play style will affect who is best for you. I personally have a lot of fun with the Pig and Myers though I should note they can be hampered by the map they get on. If you are just looking for perks go with Leatherface, BBQ and Chili is one of the best perks in the game and it almost never appears on the shrine. He also is not too bad of a killer if you don't play him like hillbilly and actually treat him as his own killer. 
---
Clown is fun though I find him really dependent on his add ons. His ability is more about pushing survivors to areas that are easier for him to get them at and cutting off loops. If you think about using his power as more of a way to shorten chases instead of looking at it as way to control the map he is pretty strong.
---
When I play Freddy I see people cleansing dull totems like crazy even if I'm not running NOED.
---
I never really went into trying NOED on 3-gen doc but nobody would really expect it because if you're committing to a 3-gen strat, why would you bother bringing NOED since the idea is you never reach endgame in the first place?  Must make them really frustrated if they spend like a half hour to finally finish the gen, and get rewarded with NOED for the trouble.
---
Best part is if totems are left behind, it's 100% the survivors fault if you 3-gen and they somehow manage to brute-force the last generator.
---
They had all the time in the world to cleanse the totems throughout the map since you played so defensively and wouldn't stray too far from the 3-gen, yet they didn't bother and got hit with NOED.
---
I don't know that I agree that it's not fair. It just is. If anything it brings a sense of realism to the game. You see it in movies all the time where someone could do something to help but instead they run. I wouldn't expect anything less in this game especially in a PUG.
---
I think you hit the nail on the head. If they're camping that hard you'll be dying soon anyhow so dc still lacks a justification.
---
You're right. I just need infectious fright so I can slug everyone.
---
With dedicated servers they will be able to, sort off. People will still be able to physically remove the cord, thought. But having a bad connection should still get you punished, since it wont happen that much. If it does happen that often, then its kinda your own fault as well.
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again: If you do things like this, you're begging for attention, and if you want my attention, I'll give it all to you. I'm not face camping, you wanted attention, you're getting what you asked for.
---
I think maybe it's inside. I just made a banana chocolate pudding cake last week, it was delicious!
---
the absolute CLOWNERY on this thread. it doesn't matter what the age of consent is. 1. age of consent is to protect teens who are sexually active with other teenagers from legal punishment and 2. legal does NOT equal morally right. it' still fucking gross and creepy. a 17 year old is a kid. even if they look older the mental difference is massive. knowing teenagers, most of them can't even do laundry; you think they have the maturity to date a grown ass person? please none of you go near children ever.
---
Marry her.
---
Sounds like a bit of a persecution complex on your part, feels like anyone can get a post upvoted if it's smart or funny. Bitching about "mains" seems a little cringey though.
---
How about if someone DC's intentionally, they lose their item/offerings but everyone else gets to keep theirs as well as extra BP/safety pip? Would stop peeps yeeting the instant they see a mori as well, which should make killers happy.
---
EDIT: Maybe have the bonus BP be in the form of a multiplier based on how many people yeet out, and it pops the gen with the least progress? If they yeet out after gens are popped, add a minute to the timer and pop a door?
---
Other than the good play with the hook save, this looks pretty standard.
---
I do play killer.  Nurse, Hag, Plague, and Spirit.  I only use ruin if I'm using haunted ground, and I can assume I'm better than you.  Never needed ruin.  If I get "gen rushed" it's my fault and I need to do better.  I don't bitch on Reddit about how I'm a shitty killer that needs ruin and BBQ to be good lmao
---
I never knew the killer could open the door while carrying a survivor!
---
Hey don‚Äôt say that, trap is a slur
---
yeah exactly my thoughts! I do that mindgame myself too, but here, he was able to stalk me for some reason D:
---
The age of consent is considered 18 in most states because of the fact you are legally an adult unless stated otherwise with a gap of no more than 4 years until 18. I am not a child so don‚Äôt patronize me. Most people consider this to be creepy and can express what they want. If one or two damn states have a lower age of consent congrats I don‚Äôt care. Yall straight up defend the weirdest shit. If your preference is a minor you‚Äôre a freak.
---
The most common age of consent in america us 16 [wikipedia link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_North_America)  In fact it is only 18 in 12 states.
---
Then break chase with that one guy cause gens are getting done you fucking moron lol
---
Ughhhh please uninstall
---
*Concern.*
---
I want a perk that is Pharmacy, but guarantees a green flashlight in place of a green medkit.
---
You mean in 12 states.  Not most of America at all
---
Me af
---
I'm still here. I'm not sure why that puzzled you so. Do you know where you're at right now? Do you need assistance? Am I speaking to someone who has all their mental faculties together?
---
Ormond also has shitty scratch marks, blood stains, and a few fat shaming spots. That map blows.
---
two consenting gay adults can do whatever. they're ADULTS. most teenagers can't legally consent. don't even try to compare the two.
---
Maybe try the trusted old technique of deleting and redownloading the game?
---
Ghostface bad! Won't be changed! What do you mean they're testing him and his current version is not indicative of the final product?
---
Are you going to do this for killer also? Because I'm kinda curious on what ages Trapper and Hag are
---
This map is shit. Good post.
---
Dude, your shitpost became a moral debate xD
---
She's a keeper, that's a nice cake, props to her!
---
BTW, Happy birthday!
---
I like this map, I think it's pretty balanced and RNG can also make this map survivor sided ( I saw once 3 rocks loops connected with each other, they were literally next to each other ). 
---
Also, this map is very good for stealth, so Nurse and Huntress suffer here. Especially Huntress with all the rocks loops she can't throw over and all the LOS breakers, this map is one with a high DC rate for Huntress mains ...
---
I've done this to plenty of survivors, I feel awful but it's an easy 4k and it's a good reminder to never trust a killer.
---
One time a survivor had their twitch channel as their name so I tuned in with the intention of fake-farming. When I started hitting gens to indicate I'm "friendly", they all moaned "ugggh just play normal. so fucking boring." little did they know the match would indeed *not* be boring for anybody. Lol.
---
(I don't do this often, just when I'm feeling bored or infuriated at humanity)
---
I know lmao this fucking community lol
---
It's one of her best add-ons by virtue of the fact that it actually gives survivors a reason to cleanse beyond trying to work with Thana.
---
It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve seen him but Ace doesn‚Äôt seem like he would be the oldest. Bill definitely seems like he‚Äôd be way older.
---
99% survivors are all the same. They'll shit talk you if you kill them, they'll shit talk you if they all escape. You have no reason to play nice with these "people". Embrace the Dark Side, sweep the leg, tunnel, facecamp, smack them on the hook.
---
Nothing you do, for better or worse, will change their infantile attitude.
---
You should have to expect it...
---
I like huntress because it looks like her nose is her mouth.
---
i enjoyed the spirit. cheers!
---
Same
---
There is no perk dedicated to slugging the last survivor when you could hook them. You get nothing for it, just like you get nothing for body blocking the basement. It's purely a dick move. Both slugging and body blocking are intended mechanics, but intended mechanics can be used in ways that I don't think are valid, as in the case of body blocking the basement. So I think you're kind of drawing a false distinction to brush off OP's point about bad behavior.
---
*Hey babe come over*
---
*Sorry I can't*
---
*The Killer's Terror Radius is there*
---
I would but I'm lazy among other things. Maybe later.
---
Not really, just play the game.
---
Play at least one match a day as each side because you get some bonus experience for your first game as each.
---
Play a ton a day? Really the only way is to play a lot so you level up multiple times a day
---
I kinda forgot it existed honestly.
---
Ace is the hardest to judge as even though he has a concrete indication of age it's really hard to tell what that reference of age is related to. Ace's age really depends on when he was taken by The Entity, because him being taken in 1990 (~60 years old) versus him being taken in 2016 (~86) are two very different times.
---
No one commented on it so I‚Äôll just say that I love those names. You hit all the bases pretty well: generic name with numbers at the end, someone who thinks they are funny putting hex in the name, and he Russian guy. Good job üëçüèª
---
This seems to be the first time that people have seen this, me included.
---
More like run the killer around for 5 gens get donwned your first hit w noed and the survs leave you to die first hook of the game
---
They could be doing it on purpose.
---
While I don't agree with the unnecessary toxic "cry baby" comments, he is right. Just go on your phone, get a drink/snack, take a bathroom break, stand up and stretch...it's just a killer being toxic, what else is new? Ignore it and get on with your life.
---
Also give Hybrid Panda a watch on youtube. He is frequent in this sub and one of the few creators on youtube who shows his failure as often as his successes. His shrinewatch series is great to learn what the ability on the shrines do and recaps DBD news each week. I also recommend Tyde. Tyde has come great explanation videos though he is a bit his way or the highway when it comes to pointers
---
You can disable the post game chat?
---
Look at all the salty survs disliking your comment xD
---
Reminded me of a Monto video where a Survivor was complaining about NOED while they were using Adrenaline.
---
EDIT: [This video](https://youtu.be/H7xbbeYo8WE) at around 11:05.
---
You could farm with friends when doing swf
---
Plus they face whoever is in that madness level. 
---
So if you go towards what they're facing you'll bump into a survivor. 
---
I think it's pretty neat.
---
So treat everyone the same and become a toxic little shit. I like it!
---
This is a fantastic piece of art, btw
---
When‚Äôs ghostface supposed to come out?
---
It rubs the locker on its skin OR ELSE IT GETS THE HOOK AGAIN
---
Sadly. And yeah the illusions are mainly for Doctor's tracking and aura reading. I just wish since Doctor seems like a "Screw with your head" killer given fake pallets, fake heartbeat, wonky skillchecks, fake red stain, etc. that the fake doctors were actually terrifying. 
---
Like you'd be working on gen or something then a doctor illusion comes rushing around the corner and starts chasing you. Anything to make him more frightening for survivors. Currently I find Hag much scarier than Doc is.
---
July 18th
---
Why Bond over Empathy? Other survivors specifically need to be injured, but at tier 3 you can see almost across the entire map. Plus you'll know where the injured ones are specifically to pick up some healing points.
---
yes, thanks! english is not my first language which is a bad excuse but what you are saying is what i was hinting at with my comment. they didn't get any data how the real killer works if his power is broken.
---
Well I'm done here and I'm blocking you, this is pretty much harassment now and quite frankly there is something wrong with you. Have fun giggling about this with your "friends" like a bunch of teenage girls.
---
Just gonna second the idea of the killer you are best at with BBQ. Ppl are suggesting things like doc and legion b/c their kit makes it easier to rack up specific types of points, which is absolutely helpful, but at the end of the day you get BPs for doing a successfully pulling off a multitude of things. So if you click with a certain killer and manage to pull a lot more activities than with other killers, slap on BBQ and never look back. 
---
But yeah, whoever you pick, get BBQ on that killer. It helps so much.
---
Ignore it...
---
No not late at all. All of the platforms are still lively. No DLC is required though I would strongly recommend the Leatherface one for the BBQ and Chili perk. It can show up on the shrine but it almost never does.
---
As other have said most of the DLC characters can be bought with shards unless their are licensed dlc.
---
"playing non for last 2years"  might be me
---
Thank you! Really glad someone noticed the names haha! It's just what I end up seeing in majority of my games.
---
I didn't knew that i needed this until now, great work
---
So...a two person SWF?
---
&gt;wasn't seen once, 3 unhooks
---
Sounds like you need Deliverance lol. I've been using it along with DS and Breakdown and when it works, it works like a charm.
---
David 22? That man looks mid 30‚Äôs
---
Small Game and Kindred are two great perks that do not get used enough. Kindred has the potential to turn every game into a SWF game even if you play with new people.
---
I didn't even know this perk existed, I just started playing again recently. I'll give it a try as soon as I get it!
---
That word describes them the best üòÇüòÇüòÇ.
---
From experience, I love playing Doctor. Go on YouTube and look at some builds. Doctor is badass.
---
You‚Äôre wrong , it is hard to chainsaw a good survivor , they‚Äôre not going to run in the open and in a straight line , billy is obviously better than every other killer bar nurse and spirit , but you can‚Äôt say he has an easy time at red ranks
---
In those situations, don't run out, just stand at the exit line and make the killer hit you. It wastes their time and helps other survivors have a couple extra seconds in whatever they're gonna do. If you can even take 2 extra hits before you crawl out, that's an even bigger waste of time for the killer.
---
Lmao
---
Well imagine that BUT with billys that are skilled and know how to play. And you get red ranks.
---
they're probably trying to find the disconnect button on reddit too
---
18 years old is the age of adulthood, not consent. You can have sex after you become a teenager. Plus, if I person wants to have sex he is free to have it, the important is that it's consensual and secure.
---
I use BBQ brutal strength STBFL and Bamboozle because it basically does everything in my opinion however you could swap bamboozle with corrupt intervention to get your setup ready but I mainly just place 1 or 2 then just hunt for survivors
---
What a stupid question
---
I usually try to help hooked survivors at the end, but if the killer runs everyone out of the gates, there's no much to do.
---
I like to run Pop Goes the Weasel, Overcharge, Hex: Ruin, and BBQ&amp;C (which you can replace with Unnerving Presence if you don‚Äôt care about bloodpoints). Get everybody‚Äôs madness level up and hope that they miss those skillchecks.
---
Wish killer could have an option to unhook a survivor once per match without advancing a hook state. Maybe give a BP bonus for showing mercy to fill the survivor with hope.
---
Sometimes I hook a dude, not even before gens are done, and I'm on the other side of the map and nobody goes for the unhook and they lose a state or even die on first hook. Or I hook a guy, gens are done, and everyone leaves and I don't feel like camping because I wanted them to get unhooked but the team just abandons them anyway.
---
If their team's going to leave them behind or not rescue and it's obvious the survivor is frustrated (Nothing is more annoying than teammates who flat out let you die even if the killer's on the other side of the map + in a chase) I should at least have the option to do their job for them. Killer can camp or tunnel people off the hook and that sucks when it happens, but it annoys me when I'm killer, I hook a guy early on, and I'm internally screaming "SAVE HIM ALREADY I'M ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP FOR ENTITY'S SAKE!' and some rando ends up dying on first hook. I'm not saying it should be something survivors are entitled to but at the very least give me the option if it seems like their teammates are just as much of a killer as I am.
---
EDIT: This especially applies in matches for whatever reason (BPS were burned, I'm feeling nice, doing a daily, etc.) I want to 2-hook everybody first so nobody gets deathhooked until I l have to. Sometimes I do stuff like if a survivor is rescued in front of me, tunnel him but leave him slugged and go after the unhooker so the farmed guy can be healed, etc because I want to try and maximize bloodpoints for everyone. As I said I hate when I want to try and avoid killing the survivors until I have to, yet they end up dying anyway on first hook because a 3-man SWF decided to let the rando die or they get ditched after the gens are done when I didn't even have NOED and ran away from the hook. 
---
Or the most common scenario, second to last survivor is hooked, and rather than attempt a rescue, Blendette would rather just let the guy die so she can get hatch after being immersed all round and doing nothing.
---
Edit: I just realized I probably added the wrong flair to the post.
---
Thank you so much! It was quite a lot of fun making it!
---
Yeah I don't disagree that you can use valid mechanics for the purposes of being an asshole, but I'm not sure what we're even disagreeing on then; do you believe that BHVR should force killers to hook the last survivor or punish them in some way for not? I think they should fix exploitable mechanics that can ruin people's whole nights, like basement blocks or using glitched terrain or something, but it's pretty hard to just punish straight BM, and it can be a slippery slope.
---
Killers best friend; urban evasion/self care Claudette. He felt bad for your team.
---
You can even equip Plunderer + Ace In The Hole and do loot hunt runs. You have good chances of finding good stuff with these.
---
The killers you mentioned all have good map pressure. Try playing Huntress without ruin and see how quickly you get gen rushed in red ranks. Your argument here is basically 'get good' and doesn't have much substance at all.
---
Ooooooh that would tilt me off the face of the earth lol, really good play though
---
Bad guy origin story üòÖ

---
Btw, dies anyone knows which music is in this video? I kinda liked it.
---
You're not wrong, but you have to consider that "bad" data is also data. All the shortcomings of Ghostface - including the unintentional ones - in the PTB is useful information for how to fix him.  
---
They'll be collecting data for when he's officially released as well, so if they happen to buff him a little too much, they'll be sure to fix that as well.
---
I have one friend who quit playing dbd because every killer is "wallhacking"
---
Idk why you got downvoted, but I have definitely seen an improvement in frame rate in recent months. I still have bad days, but the game has definitely been improving.
---
considering how hard the current pip system is and how reliant it is on you helping a shit load/ slashing,chasing, and hooking a shitload, maybe more
---
Or you can just automatically get facecamped, for daring to loop a killer who respects pallets.
---
Lol! Ace is definitely no where near 86. I would say between late 40‚Äôs - mid 50‚Äôs.
---
BBQ rewards you for what you are supposed to do anyway AND has an aura reading ability attached to it, which is very useful. WGLF just gives you points after the match and does not bring any advantages in match.
---
she lives in a state where the age of consent is 16
---
also they are all dead anyway
---
Had a blast playing with her today (most of the games at least)
---
What's BM?
---
Enduring, Spirit Fury, BBQ &amp; Chili, flex spot (Ruin, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Bamboozle, etc.).
---
Change overwhelming presence for huntress lullaby if you have it, and put on the game offering if you have that. It's called the impossible skill checks build.
---
Ace looks late 50s-mid 60s honestly. Bill is DEFINITELY in his mid 60s-early 70s.
---
Dwight and Feng both have to be between 21-25 because they drank

Im mean, its not much but id be down for 10000googleplex bloodpoints, and 50 liters of gamer guy pee
---
My friends used to play dbd (we played it for the first time together) but they never cared enough to know the perks and mechanics of the game so they stopped playing. I was pretty much the only one who was really interested to know more and become better
---
Great! Thanks for sharing it!
---
I only ever get brutal killer so.. yay? I am full of mercy
---
Just guard the best group of 3 closeby gens and you'll be fine.
---
It still does its job technically since you cant hit great skillchecks thus not progressing faster.
---
No no I wasn‚Äôt being sarcastic.  It was one of my first few killer matches and as others have said it‚Äôs stressful to be a killer.  You always feel like you‚Äôre wasting time so I didn‚Äôt have a chance to think of how to properly punish the guy. I guess also I was afraid the others would just revive him and he could resume his teabagging ways with renewed alacrity.
---
You look like you got good grades in probability
---
That's parasite we're plagued with. People who enjoy tormenting others who just want to have fun. A reflection of human nature, honestly.
---
You just need to apply the door directly to the forehead
---
Actually yes it is. Just look at the QOL changes over the course of the entire game. Which surprise surprise have been overwhelmingly for killer.
---
* Infinites. The devs introduced blood-lust and have begun boarding up windows in buildings. In turn making some places like the groaning storehouse death traps for survivors. 
---
* BNP. It was nerfed twice, from op to strong, to near useless and hardly worthy enough to be a rare add-on let alone ultra rare
---
* Insta-blind flashlights are now gone and all them blind at the same rate
---
* Hooks now get repaired in 3 minutes instead of being gone forever
---
* Lets not forget the game changing nerf to exhaustion making perks like vigil useless and the pallet vacuum being gone. Which caused pallets to be buggy and awkward to use until the devs made the drop speed faster.  And of course less pallets on all maps
---
* And of course the nerf to healing and DS and borrowed time.
---
And the only good quality of life change for survivors is that killers can no longer face camp as now survivors can be unhooked from any direction. 
---
"Your side" Have gotten all these (mostly well) thought out changes while survivors have remained static and unchanging these past 3 years. Survivors have been wanting new ways to deal with camping ,tunneling, and evading the killer since day since day 1 and the devs have stated it's part of the game...
---
And then many killer mains have the audacity to either play dumb or ignore on why perks like DS was so popular. Yeah some survivors were toxic shit heads but some were just sick and tired of being camped and tunneled. DS was a way to fight back and give them a second chance.
---
This is not even taking into account for solo survivor experience.
---
It's like dropping a ton of bricks one side of a seasaw and a feather on the opposite end and calling it balance. Sure survivors still have a few advantages but with each patch it's getting harder and less fun.
---
So please feel free to share your thoughts.
---
P.S I'm a killer/survivor switch I am on neither side.
---
I've done it before. It just requires perseverance
---
I want them to take out the Scrapped Tape (changes from a cone to a donut) and replace it with something that gives his illusions collision instead. Clearly the random illusions up in the trees and fucking off on top of buildings won‚Äôt be helpful and need to get fixed, but I think those would be nice.
---
Yeah that's why I run ruin because I'm bad,  that's pretty sad you think that way also sorry I ran a perk without your permission lmao, and yes you can assume that you are a better player that doesn't make you right, but please continue to think that your right and your opinion is correct, as well as that you deserve to criticize others over what purely opinion based.

---
Survivor: plays in a way that may hurt your feelings, but doesn't ultimately impact the flow of the game.
---
Killer:face camps in response and ruins the entire match for everyone.
---
Things will never change, sadly
---
Everybody gangsta until Jah starts hooking the survivors
---
*Monto has joined the chat*
---
That‚Äôs why I just leave if any Dwight get hooked. All Dwights strangely fit the stereotypes of cowardly, selfish character portrayed by the game. Not to mention the ones who‚Äôd sandbag, leading the killers to you types. The effort you put into helping them usually is not gonna be returned.

Free weekend, my third day playing this game. 30 seconds into a match, I get one shot by Huntress. Unhooked by teammate, healed, few moments later another one shot from range and mori'd.
---
A warm welcome.
---
Thanks! That makes sense. My childlike brain was leaning towards Bowel Movement, but I couldn't place that in the game...ü§î
---
Hex:Ruin, Barbecue and Chilli, Enduring and Spirit Fury. You can't go wrong with these perks on Trapper.
---
Surf Tones Dwight, +rep
---
Tf is wrong with Megs face, it looks normal in this pic
---
Bad data can be good data. But 'no data' cannot be good data. There may  be loads of glitches of, say, GF hooking survivors, that they never caught during PTB because he rarely if ever hooked anyone.
---
I'd replace Overwhelming Presence (Faster item consumption in terror radius) for something else as OP is pretty underwhelming. (Pun not intended) 
---
I run BBQ as the flex perk. You could run something like:
---
Dying Light (The obsession can die during the 3-gen, which isn't all that unlikely considering how well Doctor can snowball. Like don't even target the obsession in particular, just 3-gen as normal and the obsession may die. Now they're both down a man + have Dying Light penalty and are extra fucked) 
---
NOED (Cheeky but funny. If you're 3-genning and survivors somehow manage to power the last gen, they get rewarded with NOED for their trouble after a half-hour game. Nobody expects NOED on 3-gen doc and it's completely their fault because they had all the time in the world to cleanse totems across the map but didn't.)
---
Rancor (Same cheekiness as NOED, but you chase the obsession once there's two survivors left, let the last gen be powered, and instadown+Mori him. Rancor's tracking is pretty crap and the survivor knows you're running it.)
---
Ruin or Lullaby (I dislike both as they're often gone too fast and if you're 3-genning the totem is unprotected)
---
Sloppy Butcher or Coulrophobia (Slower healing)
---
Franklin's Demise (Survivors hate losing their items.)
---
Pop Goes The Weasel (Getting buffed soon with a longer timer! Allows you to apply even more pressure as after a hook, you can remove a hefty chunk of generator progression which can help set back gains made on the 3-gen during a chase)
---
Either way I run BBQ instead of Overwhelming for aura reading and more points.
---
No problem, I understood you.
---
But actually No
---
Yes, they should punish people who intentionally ruin the game, of which bodyblocking the basement and needless slugging are two examples. I don't see a downside to that.
---
Damn I can taste that salt all the way over here
---
I don't know how to address your post, I wasn't asking for a list of survivor nerfs because I was already aware that they received them. I don't want to dismiss all your points but I also don't want you to pad your posts with redundancy. My point was that survivors received some nerfs from the position of power they were enjoying, and they were sensible changes that were good for balance and the game in general. So the idea that you can just tally up the buffs or nerfs from an arbitrary period of time and just conclude from the sum where balance *currently sits* doesn't make any sense. Maybe survivors *are* underpowered right now; I don't believe they are but maybe that case can be made, but just pointing to which side received the most nerfs over X period of time doesn't tell you where overall balance is sitting right now.
---
I'm not going address your frustrations with camping/tunneling or with overpowered perks like DS/MoM being adjusted if you don't mind, it's just not an interesting conversation to have IMO.
---
Accidentaly face swapped laurie and meg. Pretty happy with the result xd
---
Really? I rarely ever run into spirits if at all on ps4. It's all billys over here
---
What were you thinking when making this?
---
Quentin's N word? you turn the N 180 degrees.
---
They also need to increase the numbers. They're way too low for the perk to even be considered
---
it‚Äôs fiction
---
yes I do get upset when a killer chooses to facecamp someone and all I can do in response is ~2 gens and leave, getting very little bloodpoints and only safety pipping at best.
---
megs I like the design
---
The Entity didn't choose Ash, he flubbed an incantation and ended up in the realm
---
&gt; anti red circle
---
you mean the stain?
---
Ash ending up in the realm was a fluke, and due to his own ineptitude
---
What rank you at?
---
Getting downvoted for asking a question :) classic.
---
i would suggest this and addons that effects sap and scream duration/frequency, survivors rarely screams and sap duration is rarely useful.
---
Killer only safety pips for facecamping too. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
Canadian laws are different no?
---
Eh, agree to disagree, I think being slugged is frustrating, but that asking BHVR to use a heavy hand and dictate when you can and can't do it is too much when there's already a timer on it that doesn't take too long to reduce.
---
phrog
---
I mean, I don't facecamp because it's fucking stupid, but I empathize with the killers who get frustrated and choose to do so
---
Survivor Perk:
---
Every 40 seconds the killers aura is revealed to you for 2 seconds.
---
Staying inside the killers terror radius will not activate this perk.
---
Staying inside the terror radius for 35 seconds while not in a chase gives you 1 token.
---
Each token token decreases the cooldown by 2.5 seconds and the aura reveal last 0.5 seconds longer.
---
Can have a maximum of 2/3/4 tokens.
---
Killer Perk:
---
At the start of the trial and for every generator completed you loose your terror radius and red stain.
---
Gain 2%/4%/6% movement speed for 75 seconds or until you start a chase.
---
No.
---
I mean like David has to be in at least 27. I refuse to believe he is 20 fucking 2.
---
It has changed. 
---
You can easily report them and they will get suspended or banned.
---
I didn't say he was easy, just that he's *easier* than other killers to play at high ranks. I simplified how you play him because I don't feel like writing a full Billy guide to someone who believes he's bad at high ranks. Survivors will juke, but if you change the timing a bit each time, it's much harder for them to juke you, and you need to know how to use the flick well, but that doesn't take that much time to learn in comparison to parts of other killer powers.
---
‚ÄúChapter 3: Sex or the Saw‚Äù
---
Why did they changed it? Now you have to exit a lobby if you want to buy something
---
Perfect coverage for Amanda mains, they just don‚Äôt get to see anything
---
Don‚Äôt agree about Jeff he is a sensitive artist type. David King  should be higher. 
---
Lmao on Quentin
---
I mean, to say there is "no data" is a bit ridiculous. That's what I'm really getting at here.  
---
There is plenty of "bad" data, without a doubt, but I'm willing to bet my left nut that there's no instance of insufficient data regarding, say, our boi Danny hooking survivors.
---
noo, I mean some other read circle
---
He look depressed
---
Yeah that's kinda petty of people downvoting üòÇ basically bond (although it has a smaller radius) has far more uses. Running the killer around you can see where your teammates are so you can avoid and not interrupt them, you can see if people are working on a generator nearby etc.
---
stan twitter just leaked
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind an ‚ÄúIridescent Queen‚Äù add on. Instead of giving you all the afflictions of your add ons it would give the passive effects instead. So things like +25% Shock Therapy Madness, larger Terror Radius in Treatment, etc.
---
Art
---
Woah woah WOAH. Have you ever watched Ash vs. Evil Dead?! (Season 1 Spoilers) When Ash‚Äôs hand regrows and kills Amanda, Pablo and Kelly figure out the *real* Ash only because the fake Ash was racist to Asians. Ash then reveals that he is ONLY RACIST TO MEXICANS. He also says that he loves Chinese people.
---
derank if you start to rank up and dc if the killer's a prick
---
David's we're going to live forever is great for bloodpoints so you can level quicker, and dead hard is a nice perk from him (avoid no mither, it's a hindrance not a perk), so I'd start with David king.

---
Legal drinking age in China is 18. Legal drinking age in the US is 21 but I doubt his asshole boss gave a shit about that when they gave him moonshine.
---
Play the game how you want to play it. The best thing I ever did was turn off chat. I play both roles and both sides can be total asshats with their made up rules about how each side is supposed to play.
---
Survivors have a way to hold the game hostage for 3 minutes, it's called the ECG. Before that it was unlimited. Run Unbreakable if you're so concerned about the possibility of waiting out a 2 minute timer every once in a while, it's really not that big of a deal. That dude was a dick in your game, it happens, but lets not overreact.
---
&gt;Why do people keep trying to fix what isn't broken?
---
Because they want an easier life.
---
That's what I've had to do at points in order to secure a win. But I shouldn't be forced to do exactly that in order to make games go at a manageable and longer pace that I control.
---
I hate this
---
I find playing survivor games are the best way to accumulate iridescent shards. Since survivor games end quicker than killer games you tend to rack up more shards faster.
---
As others have mentioned make sure to play a match as a killer and a survivor per day to earn extra xp.
---
ash un poquititito loco
---
I never said to send hate, i simply just want my PS4 players to beware.. DUDE farmed me and another team mate the entire match then proceeded to message me about how bad i am and his screenshots.
---
Ear rape
---
Fake story for you to have an excuse to "be toxic"
---
Dwight is American I'm pretty sure, though the legal drinking age in China is 18.
---
Legal drinking age in Canada is 19 with the exception of Alberta, Manitoba, and Quebec (where Behavior is situated) where the drinking age is 18. That being said you can not legally purchase alcohol in Canada on your own unless you're 21. At least I know that's the case in Ontario.
---
I lost braincells reading this. Just don't tunnel
---
I think it will too. But im simply just trying to warn PS4 Players.. dude farms then calls people trash.
---
I like this idea but boost it to 5k.
---
I will try. Young teens and teenagers can be homosexual too, and a lot of them had suffered bullying (specially at that age) because of moral idiots can't think out of their box. 
---
Besides, on most countries age of consent is 16, and we ¬¥re talking 17 here. Bellow that I agree it has to be illegal, and i never said anything about adult having sex with minors, i just said that ephebophilia it's a sexual preference and not a mental disorder.
---
Moreover, some scientist gaps teenagers till 24 years old, and the most watched category on pornsites is teen, so it's not just me saying things because of "weird fetishes", I m just exposing the truth.
---
The best way to avoid being tunneled. 
---
Play a survivor that has a scream so painful to hear that the killer avoids hooking you the entire game.
---
It's great for punishing survivors who refuse to cleanse. You either stay one shot with your aura always revealed to me or you cleanse and give me my power.
---
The relation is the mansion part. Indoor maps, as we have clearly seen with Lerys and The Game, are just toxic and not fun. A mansion would be an indoor map.
---
Leatherface is mid-tier unless you don't know how to use him.
---
Once the fix Ghostface's bugs and audio issues, stalking should be fairly reliable.
---
People were toxic to you and you didn't like it.
---
That's all the reason you should need to not be toxic to others. 
---
If you submit to any urge of frustration or anger over how others were mean to you, then not only are you letting them be successful (because always a main goal of being toxic is to tilt and piss off the person) but you're sinking yourself into the problem and making it worse yourself now being toxic to even more people.
---
It‚Äôs still possible to win a 3v1 if your team have any hint of a brain. Plus you loose points, you ruin the game more for the other 2 and the killer, and you‚Äôve also been waiting how long to find a game? May as well get some points
---
Why is feng so low she is a gamer.....
---
What if their game crashed or their internet? That‚Äôs not fair.
---
4 lockers, 25% chance for each, and 50% for using one of the doors. She checked two lockers, making it go to 50% of 25%, then another 50% on that for walking the right direction.
---
As someone also dating a significantly older man (and I mean significantly), I agree. I don't get what the big deal is about the age gap as long as it's legal and they are consenting. There are about 30 US states where the age of consent is 16 years old, so not sure where she is getting that most states have the age set at 18.
---
Waiting for a game is never gonna be long enough to be worth suffering through a 3 v 1 with 5 gens and i highly doubt they can give enough bonus points to make it worth staying to be honest
---
I swear people like this are bad 
---
Don‚Äôt facecamp survivors are going to be toxic but you should be better than them facecamping is a waste of time and fun for knowone just give them a head nod then kill the rest of their team then show them who‚Äôs better
---
because shes chinese
---
Someone recorded that scream in a studio.
---
That's not fair on everyone but if I was the one that disconnected, I sure as hell would like my team mates to be compensated for it.
---
Any points are better than none. And I don‚Äôt enjoy waiting 10+ minutes to find a lobby then the additional waiting time to get people and then the additional loading time for nothing and then restarting the process idk about you.
---
I can't confirm but I read that Frank was the only one over 18 while the others are 9-11 graders
---
breaks included
---
she will paint some for you ;)
---
You're entitled to your opinion, but don't spread misinformation. "Most" states have the legal age of consent set at 16 years old.
---
Edit: a word.
---
So you do want SWF to get the bonus points too or don‚Äôt you? You just said you didn‚Äôt.
---
That's a neat build, haven't really seen it used much.
---
They don't like the idea of being humiliated and potentially recorded.
---
They also don't like the idea that someone else may be living the dream of getting paid for playing the same game (regardless of how much the pay may be...)
---
Source: Am not a streamer.
---
I don't know if this happens already but if a person DCs it means instant safe pip for all players
---
Your the one claiming that inappropriate images of an underaged child is not pedophilia
---
Isn't Frank also the one who got the others killing?
---
They need NECA to make figures of all the characters.
---
I'd buy the Trapper in a heartbeat.
---
Flaming Hot Funyuns
---
Isn‚Äôt there already a quitter bonus? It‚Äôs around like 500 maybe? Not sure exactly
---
I think about this every single time I go to the shrine. BHVR pls :(
---
Because Dwight is a meme
---
Id rather go through all that again then fighting a losing battle 3 v 1 with 5 gens.  
---
Also bloodpoints for survivor is shit either way. Only way to get decent bloodpoint is by killer
---
This makes me uncomfortable. Not a funny meme, not sorry.
---
Yea as a Freddy main that happens all the time üíØ
---
A random internet stranger is calling me a liar!? Oh good golly what ever am I gonna do???
---
So what part of the story is so fake then?
---
You must have a better queue time then. I‚Äôd rather spend the extra 2-3 mins to get 8k bloodpoints instead of absolutely nothing for that boring ass time of waiting.
---
Haven‚Äôt you read the lore? Legion are fucking boomers!
---
Well if the match gets cancelled, you get your items and offering back, unless you were the one that disconnected.
---
Flash light save, hook rescue, body block. I‚Äôd say that was a pretty good contribution with the assumption you didn‚Äôt farm your teammate.
---
Endgame collapse. Also d strike works way different. Maybe take a look at the new survivors perks because they do change some fundamentals
---
Playboi carti- kid cudi (pissy Pampers)
---
going to whip and nae nae on your ass with myers
---
I mean, some games you never use it. Some games you don't get the down. But the games where it works... Those are good games.
---
Who? Lol
---
Well Freddy is getting a rework, Ghostface(not one from the movies just the mask) is coming to the game and is so far the worst killer. we got Big booty Judy and Jesus as survivors and a priestess and group of Edgelords with knifes that can vault pallets.(forgot ash from the evil dead oopsie daisies)
---
Laurie would never say that. She‚Äôd probably go out of her way to NOT say it tbh
---
Oh no not SWF, I can understand that. I meant for randoms.
---
&gt;Borrowed Time should not be a perk. It should be naturally applied after every unhook that meet its requirements.
---
Best boi
---
Ash was born in 57, Laurie was born in 58, they're only a year apart.
---
Well like I said I still think SWF should get it because the game can crash and Internet can get stuffed up.
---
Yes. It absolutely should. Change my mind.
---
Harassment when you keep coming back with your own set of rehearsed zingers? Hm. Questionable. 
---
*Questionable* logic.
---
Hmm. Sorry. Not gonna download the file.
---
Sigh.....
---
*Unzips*
---
I totally agree with you and if I could have it my way then that would be it. Unfortunately like others have said however, it can be abused.
---
Mouse 1
---
M1 killer - someone who doesn't use the killers power, just hits them.
---
That's the most common one I've heard.
---
I may take you up on that offer!!!!! I'll shoot you a DM!
---
Big booty Judy, you say?
---
Also, just a mask?
---
Collapse? In whos favour?
---
Probably depends on rank. I've seen just as many Spirits as Billy lately
---
Were going to NOT slow the game just  a bit
---
Mostly in yours. You can now shut the hatch as a killer, which causes a countdown timer. Keeps survivors from holding games hostage after the doors are opened
---
I disagree, but I‚Äôm curious why do you think Borrowed Time should be automatically applied?
---
On console, you set it up to receive messages from friends only.
---
That's fair, still feels kind of unfair to us non-toxic streamers trying to do our best.
---
But, life's not fair, right?
---
I just wish people could see multiple sides of a coin.
---
killer chooses to do that. With how common it happens on PS4, you can have so many games where the killer plays like this and be stuck at your current rank after dozens of games with very little payout and it is ultimately out of your control no matter how good/bad you play.
---
That just adds an extra layer to the film/ game /s
---
Adam/Meg! Getting major Coraline vibes
---
I get it.
---
You're right, doubt there's 'no data' for anything. But the point of the PTB is to get as much data about all interactions as possible. Especially since some glitches are rare. Add that to the fact that in order to test viability you really need as large of a data set as possible. If it's much more limited than intended, the data set is far less useful
---
Haha, I just realized my question has negative Karma.
---
WOW
---
If your argument is that it's "technically legal", or even worse, legal in *some* places, you've already lost
---
Don't the other survivors get gens though? Seems like only one person's game is impacted, unless the other survivors are completely braindead.
---
That's fair. Odd that it happens often on PS4. I rarely see it on Xbox
---
Like I said, I don't do it. I know it's scummy and I try to avoid tunneling too
---
Did you miss the part where the only other survivor left in the game was on his second hook? I guess I only said down, but I meant down and out. Even if they were down though, they aren‚Äôt getting themselves up with the last on hook.
---
I wasn‚Äôt going to give Killer free BPs for no reason.
---
Hey structure of the nurse sounds like a terror game
---
They got the license to the mask not the movie killer so he looks completely different besides the mask staying the same also. Referring to Jane Romero because her ass is like two watermelons which is why I call her big booty judy
---
Tree fitty?
---
Michael ‚ÄúI want to die‚Äù Myers.
---
good for you
---
:)
---
Jake:"I am a joke to you?"
---
BT used to affect both players. When you're the only survivor and the hatch was closed and the gates are powered, you think the killer is going to let you sit there and open the door?
---
Slugging only wastes time if the killer isn't using his soft camping wisely and or if the survivors are actually smart and use the opportunity to gen rush, which most don't when they see a slugged teammate and you're not in SWF, you can have everyone come to you, causing nearly a team wipe. That happened to us at coldwind in the house with a leatherface, slugged 3 people and I got the hell out of there.
---
Leatherface is only mid-tier if survivors keep running out into the open or hanging around pallet dead zones. He's not the worse thing ever, but his power's real geography dependent.
---
They fix his bugs, heck they remove the audio cue that he's sneaking near you, and he'd still have a worse power than LF. LF doesn't take four seconds to get his chainsaw ready, LF doesn't have a 20 second time limit to get in a hit after the chase starts, and if LF misses he can try again. Plus he doesn't have to waste time crouch walking to maybe get a shot at his power, you get right up on some one and figure out then and there if they have time to get away before you start revving.
---
Pedophilia is about children. At 17 Laurie would be sexually mature, be able to have children, and is mentally mature enough to have sex. If she was a few months older and turned 18 would a fairy come down and change her? The reason the federal legal age in the US is 18 (most states have it at sixteen, and even with that most states also have laws giving flexibility to this number as well) is because laws need to be in order to be enforceable.
---
That's what I do. Then I bask in the glorious salt
---
If the game is stressing you out this much, you might need to take a break. Do something that doesn't make you upset or that you actually enjoy. There's no need to torture yourself and others when there are infinite other games and hobbies to enjoy.
---
Ask yourself what you're getting out of being toxic. If you do it out of frustration you need to take a step back from DBD. If you actually enjoy it then you don't need to make excuses for it.
---
They don't get evader emblems for chases and don't rank up
---
1k that's it?
---
It‚Äôs just when a killer only uses m1 aka their melee
---
I've been seeing a lot more Nurse players on PS4. Whoever says she's bad on console has obviously never got mercilessly slaughtered by her. She can be very good on console
---
What exactly would the requirements be?
---
Basically a left click on a mouse
---
June 14th - 18th basically just preparing for ghostfaces release
---
This weekend, 14th to 18th
---
Fits her lore and she also does the classic close your eyes thing, it‚Äôs much better then trapper and wraith
---
Wait the pigs getting outfits?
---
Eh I‚Äôve found it works quite well and often get 8 stacks.
---
Rank doesn't really matter nor should you care for it since all it does is make you go against people who tend to be more rude. You get nothing by ranking up so I recommend playing for fun more than playing to win.
---
Ive heard its the 14th thru the 18th of june, someone correct me if im wrong please
---
Thanks all!
---
if ALL you do is a couple gens and leave then it isn't enough to pip since you get 0 boldness/evader and 0 altruism/benevolence since the killer is just standing by the hook doing nothing.
---
I agree! The amount of points lost is a lot more than one k
---
Honestly hang around 10 to 8 if you want to play against decent people who wont hate mail you for playing 5 blink nurse or something akin to that.
---
There would be more farming and hook rushing, which ultimately increases the chances of killers staying nearby or refusing to leave the hook since they expect it.
---
Without having anything to rebuttal, this is the answer I‚Äôve provided.
---
AFAIK speed addons don't increase efficiency, they just make it burn through the charges more quickly.
---
You'd probably get a little more discussion if you explained your own thinking a bit.  You're not claiming something that is obvious to most people, so some justification for your rationale would help.
---
IMO it's an interesting idea, but would probably be OP.  Maybe if it applied only to full solo queue lobbies or something like that?  But even then it feels too strong.  
---
It's one of the stronger perks in the game, which you can deduce by the fact that it's used fairly often.  Adding a perk that is borderline meta to any killer/survivor base kit would probably be OP.
---
The normal requirements for borrowed time. If you are unhooked within the killers terror radius your next hit for 15 seconds puts you into a mend state.
---
Speed addon will increase the speed that you heal, however it also increases the charge use rate equal to the time you are slightly faster at healing, in other words, you only heal faster, not more charges
---
If you want more of your medkit, use efficiency (botany knowledge, streetwise) or use extra charges (bandages, self adhearant wrap, ect)
---
M1 Killer is a Killer whose power doesn‚Äôt really help them in chases. Huntress isn‚Äôt an M1 Killer because she can throw hatchets. Nurse isn‚Äôt an M1 Killer because she can teleport. Wraith is an M1 Killer because all he can do is chase and attack with his M1 to down Survivors.
---
Frank is 19, everyone else is younger
---
Ok I see what you‚Äôre saying now. Yea it can be abused but the whole idea of the game has always been able to be abused. Farming in the game is abusing it and everyone does it. Legions add ons were abused and their response to that was banning the players. Camping is abusing it, hatch stand offs where the killer would stand on it so you couldn‚Äôt even attempt to jump in was abusing it. There are/were so many ways to abuse the game but come the fuck on give us compensation even if there are times when it can be abused. Hell I even want compensation when we don‚Äôt even load into a game coz that‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs time wasted and not everyone has all day. If they don‚Äôt want it to be abused they should be banning people who constantly DC but they have never done that.
---
such a shame that DeadbyDaylight mobile is coming out lol
---
Play solo survivor and loop the killer half decently. Suffer the consequences when you eventually run into a killer that decides only you should die.
---
I just want my bbq stacks tbh
---
Nice job!
---
The most obvious answer seems to be that it would systematically discourage camping and tunneling by making them less effective.
---
You should be rewarded for wiping a team so quickly but I'm assuming you would only safety pip due to the new emblem system.
---
I once had a similar situation. The team was too altruistic and threw themselves at the hook and me. Then they sent salty messages as per the norm.
---
Love the oh shit shuffle you did at the start
---
Is that a real pig?
---
No, Absolutely not, imagine if the survivors had 5 perks and the killer had 4, it would be pure bulllshit, killer has a hard enough time winning at high ranks considering how bullshit maps and pallet/window spawns can be.
---
I only play survivor I‚Äôm decent at looping but I still don‚Äôt understand why everyone should have built in Borrowed Time.
---
When killers quit at the start of the match we should at least get black pip
---
There will likely also be a BP bonus during the Anniversary event which starts on the 18th.
---
Hey theres a perk for this now, do you use it?
---
Clown
---
I will run the BBQ as I agree with how little OP has seemed to be helping me. I actually think sloppy and coulrophobia are sleeper overpowered with this build because it causes survivors to waste more time healing as I usually one hit and move on the the next survivor/generator. It may be a game that lasts forever but I prefer a long game to a beginning 4k or a gen rush.
---
Well when you put it like that, f*ck it they should just add it for SWF too then lol. Like I said before, I would like it more if they did anyway.
---
There is no skill in getting to Rank 1 though. Literaly none is required.
---
I know a guy who plays this game exclusively. Doesn't touch any other game and hops on it til bedtime EVERY day after work. Basically lives on the game.
---
He's always Rank 1 every season.
---
Yet he's still not that great at the game, can barely run the killer around very long, and near everytime we played with him we'd get a hatch game where only one person survived. (Wheras when we play without him, we typically have 3+ survivors often)
---
He simply knows how to farm pips. If killer downs someone, he'll ALWAYS announce on mic "I'm right next to em. I'll get em" because he follows the killer to hook and camps it out to get unhooks, prioritizing them over objectives. Literaly EVERY game you'll hear him say "I'm right next to them" when someone goes down.
---
He runs shit like WLF for unhook bloodpoints, makes sure to follow injured survivors to get heals in and works on at least one gen.
---
He usually pips this way even when he dies.
---
You may think he sounds like a good teammate but he's really not. He prioritizes his pips and bloodpoints over everything and everyone else.
---
Like i said, he cannot run the killer around unless they're bad. If killer tunnels him from the start, he's out of the game very fast. Most matches end in only one escape via hatch because he will always focus on his unhooks over doing objectives.
---
So while one of us is running killer around, instead of getting gens done, he's watching where they go so he can be there for the unhook if they go down. He only works on a gen if it's in an area where they're looping killer. And if someone else is injured and healing or trying to get a trap/madness/sickness etc off, or searchinh for Ruin/Devour/Lullaby that leaves one person doing gens all match which fucks us over constantly since Rank 1 killers can pressure gens.
---
And he just makes really poor decisions including farming someone when he's the last player not downed or on hook or runs killer to other players etc.
---
Knowing how to get bloodpoints/pips doesn't make you a good player. 
---
Being Rank 1 doesn't make you a good player. And playing with 3 Rank 1's doesn't increase your odds of having better teammates either.
---
Most Rando's at Rank 1 disconnect the second they get downed the first time or farm you off hook, run killer to you, or spend the game looping pallets, flashlighting and tbagging then disconnect the second they get hit.
---
Or if you get downed yourself in the first 5 min of a match, they disconnect. Ruin on gen and you miss a single great skill check? Disconnect. 
---
That or they remain immersed Claudettes wandering around the shrubbery or in the basement the entire match waiting for gens to pop or hatch to spawn and do absolutely nothing at all themselves the entire round.
---
Rank 1 can be mega-cancer.
---
That's why i never go out of my way to get back up there anymore. I usually stay between 3-6 through normal gameplay without 'trying' to pip.
---
Survivors on this game are just really selfish, bad and entitled overall no matter the rank.
---
Yeah I guess, I just think that the game is relatively balanced right now, compared to some times in the past. If they do this the game might become more survivor sided.
---
Donut Doctor is probably the least played addon I‚Äôve ever seen because in what situation would you ever go ‚Äúyeah I need to everywhere around where the center of a target is‚Äù
---
If you wanna try hard Spirit. If you wanna be toxic Freddy. If you want okay perks and be toxic Plague.
---
Youve never been in red rank am I right? Lol
---
I'd say spirit
---
The 2 that he "lost" points in are the two you really don't have much control over. Only way to get gatekeeper is to run ruin and hope they don't find it early. And with devout if you don't get the 9 hooks due to survivors not going for saves you'll easily end up in gold or silver.  It just shows how stupid the system is
---
Im pretty sure that technically pedophillia is with children under like 6 or something.
---
Why not just impose quit penalties? 20 minutes before you can search for a new game for quitting.
---
What does the countdown timer do?
---
Sounds delightful, tell me more.
---
you started throwing it, got hit, then it hit the ground. try using the same logic when driving a car and I PRESSED BREAK SO HOW DID I HIT THAT WALL (I know, flawed argument, game is not real life)
---
Exactly lol. I used to complain about perks like ruin/noed being used against me but I stopped after I realised I used all of the OP survivor perks and complaining about that was pretty hypocritical of me.
---
If only....
---
Micheal is pretty cool
---
You gotta remember Halloween 1 took place in the 70's so her clothes are also at fault for her seemingly older appearance.
---
(Survivor) Faith: When you enter a chase, all other survivors in a 24m radius receive a 7% Haste status effect and your aura is revealed to the killer, both for 10 seconds. This perk has a cooldown of 60/50/40 seconds. You cannot be affected by any other survivor's Faith perk.
---
(Killer) Spider's Nest: At the start of the trial, 2 hooks are marked with a special aura. Survivors can see the auras of the Webbed Hooks while the killer is carrying a survivor. 
---
Hooking a survivor on a Webbed Hook randomly transforms another normal hook into a Webbed Hook.
---
Survivors within 12m of a Webbed Hook gain the Hindered status effect until they leave the radius. When a survivor is unhooked from a Webbed Hook, the aura of the rescuer is revealed to the killer for 4/5/6 seconds.
---
Spirit is the strongest. all of them are kinda fun on their own terms. Legion is good for farming bloodpoints. Freddy is getting a rework soon so you can try him out before it and you'll have it once it hits live
---
Clown or Spirit. None of the rest.
---
He dropped out right? After his incident he thought it as a retirement. Therefore he was collecting debts often and his frequent drinks at the pub make me think he can‚Äôt be older than 40 or younger the 25.
---
I mean, you could still maybe have an interaction button for hiding behind a curtain.
---
I really wouldn't mind to see another stealth mechanic. It would make it dramatic and fun.
---
Like the locker but different,
---
M1 killer is someone who has no other way of downing a survivor than using their basic attack
---
All survivors remaining in the match die when it ends. It happens when an exit gate is opened, or when the hatch is closed (which also powers the exit gates if they aren't yet).
---
If so, Noed should be in base kit too. Change my mind
---
The pig used to be the best end game killer until EGC, now her traps can‚Äôt be used effectively in the late game. The best build probably has NOED and Bloodwarden, but i don‚Äôt know what else.
---
It is fine as is.
---
Well most of the characters in dbd are Canadian. That includes form what I remember, Jeff, Trapper, Claudette, and Legion. Claudette, Meg, Dwight, and Jake all walked into the same woods.
---
yeah because its not. there is another term for it attraction to teenagers instead 
---
you are the one who said somebody is a pedo and as i know im not a pedo nor am i attracted to teenagers im forced to assume it was you
---
What does he mean with kys
---
This is excellent I tell you. EXCELLENT.
---
I disagree. From a free escape to an anti tunnel perk was a fine idea. If you never get tunneled then you don't gotta worry about using it. 
---
It's actually a pretty decent perk now compared to how ridiculous it was, even in concept alone it was ridiculous. Being broken for 40 seconds don't seem like it would be fair at all. Because at that point it goes back to the original issue (a free escape) while the downside you propose is useless. In those 40 seconds you'll be getting chased anyway, being broken doesn't mean anything since you wont be healing.
---
Farming is basically just a quick unhook correct? So if farming occurs, killers can just wait for natural borrowed to expire, and still tunnel until then. Which is much less effective than targetting the unhooker in that time. If killers stand nearby they lose points, people can just gen rush then and killer loses. Or if someone does get the unhook and decides to tunnel once again has to deal with natural borrowed. It keeps killers focused on the objective of the game and avoid having that dirty little option... hmm well Im losing so let me just kill this 1 person. In a solo que no one is going to be able to stop you or even want to unhook you if you're getting camped. But with natural borrowed it will incentives those 1 hook warriors to be saved.
---
he is supposed to be in the same tier as feng, hes invisible for some reason
---
Spirit
---
I think the ‚ÄúAging 50‚Äôs movie star‚Äù isn‚Äôt meant as the 1950‚Äôs but more as a actor in their late 50‚Äôs earlier 60‚Äôs but otherwise I feel pretty damn spot on
---
New DS is wholesome, specially if you are in the basement and the killer comes back.
---
With old DS he could dribble the obsession back to the hook or non obsession couldn't wiggle in time.
---
KYS typically stands for (online at least), "kill yourself".
---
So it's not a very nice thing to say.
---
The perk is utterly useless if the killer is not near the hook. And if the survivors are all near the hook, there will be plenty of options for you to chase. Including the unhooked with natural borrowed time. You can still tunnel and camp killers dont worry. It's just harder now. If you play objectively, you should have absolutely no difference in gameplay or balance. That's a fact
---
I think is fine as it is now, but also you can use it in other ways and not only being tunneled, like using bond and going to a surv who is being chased, you get the hit, the killer picks you up and you use ds, saving a teammate
---
Time doesn‚Äôt exist in the realm of the entity
---
The prick must be sabotaging the hooks...
---
Pig? Endgame? Why must you remind me of the good times!
---
Borrowed is only a good perk right now because it takes up a perk slot and theres always a thought that they might not have it or maybe they will have it. So killers camp and gamble. Knowing natural borrowed exists will just make killers not want to be near the hook at all. Who wants to deal with borrowed? No one. So dont tunnel and camp and you never have to deal with it.
---
TL;DR he's an m1 killer who's power doesn't help secure the down, similar to wraith it only helps get the first hit.  
---
When bhvr nerfed him they took away almost everything he had going for him, they reduced the movement speed of his ability (they made it last longer to compensate, but people are easily gonna outrun you if you don't pop it behind them mod chase as well as made it take longer to recharge), they removed the mind game potential of mend by not showing the killer where it's at (previously you could roughly guess where someone is based off of when you hit them and when they finished mending). Not to mention that if you miss your swing you immediately lose all of the power gauge and get stunned,  and to top it all off they made it so hitting someone with feral frenzy while they are in deep wounds no longer reduces the deep wounds timer or does really anything aside from the 300 hit score event,  it still takes you out of feral frenzy as before (most people don't even bother with the second hit unless they're going for bloodpoints or stbfl, they'll just manually end the power next to them and deal with the stun without giving the survivor a speed boost). Sure he's basically guaranteed an early hit (assuming you don't 360 them or they get caught on something and lose their power) 
---
But as far as getting the downing hit you might as well be any other m1 killer.  During his ptb people found out that he was still OK with stun reduction add ons, but bhvr nerfed them too before releasing the "reworked" legion.
---
So if there's one left, the hatch opens. If I find the hatch and close it, the gates open and an exit timer starts up. Time runs out, survivors go boom?
---
Borrowed is the worst perk in the game when you play against a respectable killer that doesnt tunnel.
---
Thank god, I wouldn‚Äôt want people to dislike me for playing *5 blink nurse*... I really don‚Äôt understand why people get so upset üò•
---
*Laughs in deliverance*
---
Just started using Diversion and games have been 10x more fun
---
To add a note to this: Hitting great skill checks progresses the interaction bar without consuming extra charges, which means that you can keep your brown Med-Kit if you hit at least 1 great skill check.
---
On Freddy I‚Äôve been using Devour Hope, Blood Warden, NOED and Remember Me.
---
Some killers have a hard time winning. A skilled enough Nurse/spirit/billy/huntress have absolutely no problem slaughtering a swf. Without tunneling. Without camping. Those are the killers that get ggs. Not the ones that win or lose because they gambled on tunneling and well shit he had borrowed. If you think borrowed is OP... I mean have you ever played survivor lmao
---
But then, say someone likes the bait &amp; catch way of playing, instead of survivors being able to play around them by doing gens, that killer can no longer play THEIR game &amp; has to play in a way they might not like, or not play at all
---
Then why shoukd killers even try? Now the killer has to watch the hatch and both doors, it's like a guaranteed escape.
---
I just started; literally played one game (I survived; got hooked but someone rescued and healed me). I've watched tons of videos and always wanted to play but just don't have a ton of time (44 with a 17 year old graduating and a chronically ill wife, so free time is almost non-existant). That one game was fun and showed me that running and juking isn't as easy as the pros make it look. Looking forward to playing some more tonight. It's daunting but I don't take it personally. The killer camped me on hook until someone else finished a gen and he left. Really fun game, great premise.
---
I'm sure I'll get jaded and toxic at some point but for now, I look forward to seeing some of you out there!
---
Press the drop item button. Default bound to ‚ÄòR‚Äô
---
Camping is a part of the game sadly, the devs even stated it as a ‚Äúvalid‚Äù strategy (the quotations are my input).
---
Waiting out borrowed is letting the survivor get back into chase in a relatively safe area (jungle gyms or pallet loops). Killers would always go for the hit because no matter what the survivor will be back in a good chase spot.
---
Farming can be farming as a whole (everyone in the match), or farming your teammates (usually putting the hooked survivor into a poor state of survival). Less people would gen rush if they knew they could get free unhooks and farm points without much downside. Farming is the reason WGLF was changed to safe unhooks. I know I would go get a easy stack and over a thousand points for a easy unhook, this leaving the gen I‚Äôm on.
---
Now imagine with a SWF who could coordinate easy unhooks so multiple gems could be completed in a reasonable time. It would dominate already more than a full SWF does now. It makes solo Q easier knowing you‚Äôll be unhooked, but makes SWF more busted.
---
Seen lots of billy and huntress with a few cheeky legions
---
killers arent better lol, a lot of just camp and tunnel then wonder why we‚Äôre toxic when we get to escape.
---
Easily. If you dont tunnel the guy off the hook, borrowed will never effect your life. Noed is a crutch that dramatically changes the game. (I dont think noed is overpowered). But it is incredibly strong in a situation that occurs unavoidably every game.
---
As a Claudette it brings me joy, as a killer only suffering.
---
10000 years old, uguuu...
---
That poor toolbox was left behind ;-;
---
That makes sense, sucks but it makes sense lol thanks
---
Okay that makes sense, thanks
---
It pops up in the blood web eventually on its own
---
So Pig endgame isn't viable anymore?
---
being caught in the end-game shouldn't result in you surviving tho
---
Some people are just really sore losers. It just kills the fun. In my book (I'm survivor main), as long as you don't camp, you can do whatever you want as a killer.
---
What's EGC? And is Pig endgame isn't viable anymore?
---
You have to run it as an offering (either Cyrpus, Ivory or Ebony) then down a Survivor you have already hooked.
---
You can also get it from certain perks, such as Devour Hope and Rancor.
---
How would you compare Freddy to Pig for endgame right now?
---
Adorable! I love all.
---
&gt;Dbd is a team based game meaning communication is highly important.
---
Uh, it's actually not. The Steam page even notes this. You just happen to be on the same side as three other people who all have the same goal as you: survive. How each person intends to do that can be very different from person to person.
---
And yeah, communication is important. But a huge part of this game is having to work together (or not...) with other survivors *despite the lack of ability to directly communicate with one another*. This is basically a hide and seek/tag/mystery (in the sense that you're not meant to know exactly what's going on across the map at any given time) hybrid game. There's a **reason** there's no voice chat in this game.
---
So Survivors should get 5 perks? Fine.
---
But now BBQ is basekit for all Killers.
---
Wow, people are still bitching about how unfair SWF is and how voice comms break the game. It isn't going anywhere. Get used to it until the devs fix it or go play Minecraft.
---
Corrupt Intervention to give you time to set up, BBQ because... well BBQ, STBFL as Evan needs help in chases &amp; Third Seal as survs still get the trap notification, but just like hooks, are gonna have difficulties finding them
---
Tooooooooooooooooooooxic dude. (Just a joke, if you know who it‚Äôs from)
---
But then its doing what you want anyway?
---
Cleanse the totems, brooooo.
---
Consistency I guess, since they added the cosmetic store they wanted everything to be in a single store.
---
Both are toxic lmao. The more one side is toxic, the more the other side tries to counter it.  But survivors aren‚Äôt blameless. Not every killer camps yet most of the games i‚Äôm a survivor in people still do that shit.
---
Spoiler alert: David Dies
---
Nope, traps only activate when a gen is done now. Survs still cant leave gates with an active trap, but she still got gutted &amp; still has yet to get compensation
---
I disagree with the devs clearly. The strategy completely incapacitates a player from functioning whatsoever if the killer chooses to go about about that. Other teammates can only just watch you on the hook or sacrifice themselves trying (against God killers). 
---
If a killer waits out borrowed or hits the borrowed they are missing opportunity to get an actual injury which may even trigger/benefit some killer perks (thanatophobia sloppy butcher) rather than just a mend state. 
---
I was responding to farming in the context of hook farming. Killers complain about gen rushing so incentivizing hook rescues is bad how? Go ahead and save your teamate that's what the games about.
---
Your last paragraph just mentions some issues with swf that exist but are not effected by adding this change, as long as a killer doesnt plan on tunneling.
---
Oof... this is literally one of the first results when you look up ‚ÄúDBD memes‚Äù ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Baby arms lol
---
As a killer I hate lerys, badham preschool, all cornfield maps, ymaokas estate, and ESPECIALLY haddonfield.
---
As a survivor shelter woods kinda sucks i guess. I mean it's still not that bad. 
---
Haddonfield= DC.
---
Head 2 big amirite
---
Yeah I know. But this plays really well. And it's a different outtake on it. It has a cool tim burton style to it. For a mobile game I feel I'd prefer this. Dead by daylight whe I'm REALLY gaming haha
---
What about "buy time" Pig? Like slow the gens as much as possible so the bear traps will go off?
---
Ghostface and Leatherface would be around the same tier. GF has stealth and can get insta-down lunges through windows amd pallets, while LF can use his power without an in-built restriction and is better with the basement.
---
Eh, in all honesty, Laurie x Quentin is better in my opinion.
---
hillbilly
---
I never said that it should, although I do believe the timer is too short. Ans door standoffs are rng but usually a free win for the killer. I preferred hatch standoffs honestly lol
---
For reals
---
LOOOOOOOOL
---
lmao get out
---
thanks, didn't miss it
---
Why Billy? To me is overplayed by a large margin.
---
Yup. Two very rare outfits.
---
Clown, Spirit, or Freddy. I know Freddy will be unpopular, but hes getting his rework soon and looks like hell at least be mid tier
---
Not sure why you think it's an extra perk, once again it would literally be useless if you didnt tunnel. 
---
And I think the bp part of bbq makes it a no brainer. I wish they would rework it. But honestly go for it. I'll take that trade.
---
you tryna be crate
---
I've been rank 1 killer before smart ass. Last year, with The Spirit. I was rank 1 for awhile actually. But for some reason, I can't this year.
---
It's the roman numeral for 12.
---
&gt;killers don‚Äôt need Ruin in general. 
---
Uhhhh.....
---
&gt;if you need it you‚Äôre bad at stalling the game
---
Ruin is in the most picked perks across all platforms in red ranks so I guess all killers are bad at the game lmaooooo
---
Auric cells I assume?
---
Clown is actually shit. His power  just makes things blurry
---
Preventing the killer from tunneling. Indeed it is (:
---
 Why do people camp? You get less points right? I only remain in the hook area at end game since there's nothing else to do. Camping early in the match seems pretty stupid and it makes me giggle when I see the killer got like 3rd to last place in points. That's why you're dumb. You're supposed to be 1st or 2nd if you're the killer. Jmo.
---
Auric cells I assume? And why is she getting outfits
---
Fuck.jpwg
---
Sadly it's not, age of content in many places of US is 16 and in many other countries is much lower, so this is really just your personal preferences put into a weak meme format
---
yeah.
---
if you need a perk to use as a crutch cuz yer not good enough to do it on your own? you're bad. lmao
---
spirit
---
Yeah people intentionally derank for the free weekend lmao
---
I'm just assuming they got creative rights or something.
---
Also, I don't remember what It cost. It was leaked  with Ghost Face.
---
Oink!
---
Ok, and ruin is basekit for all killers, except it's not a hex anymore and it fades away after 120 seconds since anyone started doing gens. Change my mind
---
Always see it positively. An escape is only 5k bloodpoints. What's that? A green offering? If survivors/killers play a good game kill count/survival is not that detrimental.
---
Well other than the fact that I hate supporting Netease, a company notorious for ripping off other games, it‚Äôs killers and survivors are also rip offs. I remember the clown character was a direct rip off of Billy and there‚Äôs probably more. I also heard that Survivors in that game is super easy and way in favor of them.
---
The perk play with your food contains a quote from the extended version of Halloween 1. The scenes in the extended version were shot with Halloween 2 for the TV release of Halloween 1. In the TV version of Halloween 1 they are related.
---
Just see amanda with a gun in hand lmao
---
join the communities on ps4 there's usually like 40+ parties to join
---
So you agree under conditions? Or are they separate thoughts? Because regardless of the state of killers I think this change does not boost or hinder a killers ability to kill survivors as long as they dont tunnel.
---
But I do agree.. ruin is fairly necessary. I wish they would make 2 or 3 similar perks like ruin... but the way killers use it now it might as well be a 5th perk. I'd take the trade if it came down to that though.
---
Oh shit you‚Äôre right... Tbh it should have been Wraith.
---
I did but they were all full/doing dumb stuff
---
I laughed my ass off. I love it.
---
Wait what people are shipping them? Tf
---
The most I look at it, the worst it gets
---
#Leatherfacecamping
---
I am very appreciative of the random survivor that cooperated with me in order to get the From the Void She Kills achievement. It felt impossible under normal circumstances, so I downed a survivor, carried him to a generator, then smacked the gen until he got the message. It only took one try.
---
"Rev up those generators because Im ready fo-"  
---
\*P3 5 Blink Nurse out of nowhere\*
---
Oh no the whole game is a direct copy but with a cool style to it. Like the characters look really cool to me. But hey dont install if you dont want. Just a suggestion
---
Literally me I got the game a month before PS had it for free. To scared to play survivor so I got scorched as a baby Hillbilly on swamp. Memories
---
I mean if BT becomes survivors' basekit, then killers' should get something worthy in return. As ruin is one of the most used perks in the game it would be good if it became basekit, while the hex:ruin would be replaced with something else.
---
I don‚Äôt know spirit pls explain
---
This at least ends.
---
Only thing I can agree with you there lol. It‚Äôs got that Coraline style.
---
You got it. The timer is two minutes if no survivor is downed or hooked, 4 minutes if they are. It's not supposed to get kills, but mainly just to give survivors a reason to not stick around for half an hour to annoy the killer.
---
It should be 2.5k for both Survivors and Killer. It's 1/4 Survivor after all. Or 2k if we take it as 1 of 5 players, i would be good with that too.
---
I agree that gen rushing is an issue but also that it is entirely separate from the tunneling issue. But on that separate note, I'll say I agree that ruin should be base kit. Even though it's annoying as hell. The only problem would be that everyone would just cleanse totems right away every game. Rather than have that level of ambiguity not knowing whether ruin exists or if your team is looking for it.
---
I love it
---
Are you on PS4? Because I was probably bubba on your first game. I was surprised to get more than one survivor for a couple games. Even one had dark sense and was the first one I hooked
---
Better perks imo
---
I'm frequently this person. The survivors all sit there hiding and waiting for somebody to do an exit gate, and then I say fuck it i'll do it, get it to like 90%, the killer chases me off, they open it and fuck off.
---
He's also majorly busted in the PTB right now, and the devs haven't outlined how they're planning to fix him just yet. Don't get too excited for him.
---
Oh yeah, and the devs have recently been on a kick of letting the survivors control whether the killer gets to use their powers. Legion inflicts deep wounds with his, which do nothing if the survivors don't heal after taking it. Plague gets people sick which hurts them when it maxes out, but has a second power that gives her ranged damage if survivors remove the sickness. Otherwise, she's just a normal killer without a power. Ghostface is the worst of the lot. The survivors just have to look in his direction, not even see him, in order to completely remove his power.
---
BLOODY RUN CLAUDETTE RUUUUN
---
Payday 2 players who have played since launch
---
My favorite Endgame build is with Freddy. It was better before Remember Me got nerfed but it‚Äôs still a good end game build. Before the nerf it would take 75 seconds open a gate if you had max stacks and the Survivor was in the Dream World. Even longer if you had the Swing Chains add on. 
---
The build i ran with was Ruin / Remember Me / BBQ / Blood Warden. Ruin and BBQ because even though it‚Äôs an end game build you need to get some hooks before the end game or else the Survivors will be fearless and you‚Äôll have a lot pressure.  A Survivor on death hook will play a lot more conservative compared to a Survivor who hasn‚Äôt been hooked all game. Blood Warden is self explanatory and Remember Me synergizes well with the slow down of the Dream World. If you‚Äôre low rank you can bring NoED instead of BBQ but I found at high ranks most Survivors expect end game Freddy with NoED so they almost always cleanse the totems. 
---
For add ons you need Class Photo. It‚Äôs a purple add on so you‚Äôll need to spend a lot of BP. It‚Äôs pretty necessary though as it‚Äôs way too hard to reliably have all Survivors in the Dream World  after the gens get powered unless you have Class Photo. Second add on is Swing Chains to slow down the gate timer even more. 
---
I haven‚Äôt tried this build since the EGC/Remember Me nerf but it‚Äôs probably still one of the better end game builds.
---
Again my understanding is that he got kicked out as a junior college rugby student and then went into more violent passtimes like underground fight clubs and the likes.
---
That being said, the idea that this game can't possibly have any balance issues anymore (including the ones which imply survivors are overall stronger than killers) just because survivors have been "nerfed," is an... incomplete sentiment.
---
Haha of course youd say in favor of the survivors. This reddit is hilarious. It's a suggestion. It's a phone game. And the fact that you said the favoring the survivor thing is so funny. Like you cant handle survivors having anything even in a phone app. I play it a lot lately and both survivors and killers have a lot of stuff they can do.
---
No that can be abused. Should be a time penalty
---
Ken really is sick of Barbie‚Äôs shit.
---
Accurate
---
Personally Auto Haven Wreckers, more specifically Azarov's Resting Place is worse. It's too open and is very easy to chokehold because of the chokepoint in the middle of the map. A Smart Doctor or high mobility killer can lock down a 3 gen on one side of the map because of how close they are all together.
---
True. I dont see any clean options the way the game currently is. They need to rework the end game a bit but I havent put enough thought into how. But I do know that door standoffs are pretty dumb. Or just getting tunneled by the killer and he bloodlust up and force you into a corner until end game gets you. Not a fan of either conclusion to the game that happen so often.
---
Now listen here
---
I pretty much played only spirit for about 5-6 months after her release.
---
Her only counter is iron will and user error (and sounds being fucked, but that's being fixed again soon). She specifically needs her movement speed and activation time add-ons nerfed/reworked. Prayer beads are also very questionable. Wakizashi I have no opinion on, I never used it enough.
---
Spirit's probably more powerful than billy with the right add-ons. Maybe even on-par with 2 blink nurse.
---
Susie is over 18
---
Three words to change your mind.
---
Gideon meat plant.
---
"50s movie star" is clearly referencing a look. It's saying that he would not look out of place as a typical actor in a movie that would have been released in the 50s. It does not mean he looks like he would have been a movie star decades in the past. I don't mean to be rude, but you are misunderstanding that phrase. Ace is likely in his 40s.
---
I have a problem with someone getting a lucky escape. RNG already decides far too much of the game and it's dumb that one player just loses if someone else holds down M1 and gets lucky.
---
I turned 18 before I graduated
---
Yes and so does them hurting themselves, while it's a less Noble function, it's still a noble function. It is unhealthy, but so are cigarettes and beer, but those aren't as looked down upon. I would like to clarify, i am not intending to say that your a bad person for believing your opinions, just that I'm trying to show you other sides of the opinion.
---
I never said survivors were op in dbd you absolute meathead. I read it from multiple forums when it first released. It said that survivors could teleport and shoot the killer easily. The ‚ÄúCipher‚Äù machines have extremely easy skill checks. The short time I did play I escaped every time and it was uncommon to get a 4K.
---
There were 3 killers released after Clown?! I've got a lot of catching up to do
---
Interestingly enough, many people seem to incorrectly attribute this quote to the original film, not the TV version. Not saying you‚Äôre wrong, just thought it was interesting.
---
Thx to everyone who commented, I had to get clown boi.
---
If your going for perks then hillbilly or spirit, spirit has haunted grounds and spirit firm, Billy has enduring. Great perks to unlock.
---
The game is saving your progress
---
Ah thanks

Claudette is the only confirmed Canadian from the original bunch, having lived in Montreal. Jeff and The Legion both lived in Ormond, which is a [small town in Ontario.](https://www.tripmondo.com/canada/ontario/ormond/)
