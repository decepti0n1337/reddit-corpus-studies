Couldnt you just like? Hit them again? That's what I do.

Starts off as the most annoying and obnoxious person you'll meet (release), but then the fetal alcohol syndrome kicks in while they age and they show signs of mental and cognitive fatigue resulting in slower movement, lack of focus, drastic loss of effectiveness in previous ability, and lower tolerance of society's criticism (2.7.0 nerf).... yup, sounds like legion all right.
---
Bill lookin sexy though
---
‚ÄúSo him AND his opinions can go eat my ass‚Äù üòÇüòÇI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve laughed that hard in a while tbh with you lol and yay! Glad you‚Äôve broken contact with him, and I‚Äôm glad everyone‚Äôs been really kind to you, you deserve it‚ù§Ô∏èI wish you the best!!
---
I recently unlocked m&amp;a just for him  but havent gotten it yet. I've had quite some success with insidious on him, which I can't find any good use for on any other killer. I also love having dying light on him. It slows the game down so much.
---

---
I agree with you that Freddy is bad at chases, I stop most of my chases if I can't hit people fast enough. But he makes it up being able to ambush them on their way back to objectives.
---
By reaction time, are you talking about the 7 seconds he needs to hit someone?
---
Any killer can get 4ks and anyone can cherry pick their highlights. Show us the games where you get stomped on. Shows the games where you can't keep anyone in dream state because of shit RNG. Show us the survivor completing a gen in your face only to immediately proc adrenaline. Or a survivor getting healed while you stand and watch.
---
I mean think about it. If you can't keep people  in dream, what makes Freddy better than wraith? Freddy is one of my favorite killers but he has obvious issues.
---
Idk I don‚Äôt really think he‚Äôs much of an icon anyways
---
I think it'd be cool to get face masks for some of the newer survivors.
---
Actually not a bad idea, His dialogue is on point, and he can do stuff other killers can‚Äôt. Yet it is also vice versa but I would want this in dbd
---
It‚Äôs a killer perk called no one escapes death, everyone says Noed for short.
---
Im kinda confused is it an achievement or ritual?
---
Yes

I love those little dumb bits that happen during the game, it makes me love it even more. Just goofing off in matches and not taking things too seriously has led to some of the most memorable moments in the game for me and some of the people I play with. If you‚Äôre ever looking for someone to play with, serious or not, I‚Äôm always happy to join as well!
---
Nobody Escapes Death.
---
It is a killer hex perk that activates when all gens are finished, the killer can double damage (instant down) all survivors, this can be stopped by clensing the hexxed totem.
---
Then love that hatred.
---
My biggest problem with Doctor. He's already *super* reliant on add-on's and not amazing at rank 1. It's annoying that his shock doesn't always cancel the interaction as it should
---
[No One Escapes Death](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_No_One_Escapes_Death)
---
I keep playing DBD because I enjoy making people miserable.
---
No one escapes death. A killer hex perk that activates after the last generator is completed powering the exit games as long as there is a remaining full totem on the map. It gives the killer a boost of speed as well as giving the survivors all the exposed effect making them all one shot downs.
---
More handsome imo
---
Thank you &lt;3 It's hard keeping up with all the comments and support that people are giving me, but it means a lot to me!

Haddonfield is worse than the corn field maps to me. The fences are cancer and some of the loops can feel infinite with balanced landing.
---
Rip me

Without looping chases would end really fast though
---
Agreed!

Yeah, one pip is better than depip

for marketing &amp; Advertising purposes its considered a ch to drive up hype and encourage more people to buy it

this was done with both ash and leatherface

this "leak" could have been done to drive up hype, so they can show the people who own the Scream rights how much potential money they can make if they are allowed to bring in a survivor

The survival medal.   You either get gold or close to it for surviving over 9 minutes.    Even if you end up dying.

Awesome! I bet we could get a whole group together just from this reddit post honestly lol

I send you an add :)

I love Yamaoka Estate. I don't think it's a bad map for killers, unless you play against P3 Claudettes.

I didn't completely dislike what they did with his look here but good lord this movie was ass.

---
You can avoid them but they also have an insane hitbox. Like I've seen those things hit people who are miles away from them. But yeah just wanted to throw in a couple bits for ya.
---
Grabs can't be relied on to happen often enough, devour hope is unrealistic and still requires hooks to get enough tokens to work, so you still end up tunneling someone to make the exposed status appear. NOED's good but gets nullified by cleansing above certain ranks. Moris do it fine but are quite expensive in the long run, can't expect to use one each game, plus you can't use them with BP offerings which worsens the grind. Rancor is great but only works on the obsession, and only at the end, so you still end up tunneling the others the whole game to finish the MoM user at the end. 
---
Killer abilities are good, but not all killers can damage with their ability, many are too situational, and anyway a lot of MoM users are counting on the regular hits to exploit the free one, so they'll actually try to take a hit to draw your attention away from others.
---
i think it's speculation but very grounded speculation. bhvr can use the mask but not the character itself. if that makes sense

If the Entity can have electricity in its domain, then it can have reception too.

Why the fuck would you do that, you stupid cunts? You think that's going to give you a free pass when another killer shits all over you? You think that Pig won't give up and default to Billy or Nurse after having been embarrassed like that? After having made their awful performance known on reddit, no less?

You're not doing anyone any favors by posting a garbage killer being handfed kills out of pity so you can get some fucking reddit karma.

---
So fresh, so new.
---
Tread carefully now, Neas fanbase is not to be trifled with.
---
Because it is? Lol. When the survivors aren't able to coordinate, the killer has an advantage. All it takes is one survivor to slip up and everything starts going to shit, and without swf you don't have anyone you can rely on to pull it back. I think part of this sub's problem is they expect playing killer to be like the first half of a slasher film and anything harder is viewed as survivor sided, when in reality if you are evenly matched skillwise then you should be getting that 4th kill when there is 0 or 1 gens left if you play better, or get one or two kills and everyone else escapes if you play worse. (Granted behavior is fucking horrible when it comes to recognizing what makes for a good game by killers in terms of pipping, but that's a different rant)
---
Got a source for this as i have been seeing this everywhere and have found nill
---
They are replicas. They aren't "exact" because they are designed to be skinned, boneless faces, which naturally deforms how they look.
---
To all of them, start a chase and in 44 seconds the other 2 pop and adrenaline kicks in.

Killers on a mac be like

We want more!!
---
Why do people keep thinking this is a new discovery? This has literally been in the game files since 2016.
---
A third party? Which one? I'm fairly certain the black robe/cloak (father death outfit) also owned by the same license holders of Scream.

Platform: ps4. Bug: ingame, whenever I‚Äôm playing nurse she constantly uses her blink when I‚Äôm not pressing L2. I can only stop it by holding blink but then that messes me up cause I‚Äôll blink too far.
---
Yeah I checked at you do only get silver as the highest for dying.  But it‚Äôs still silver for passing the 9 minute mark
---
But my question is when does that time start 
---
During the camera rotation intro or when it‚Äôs finished
---
Dang I never knew that
---
Survivors who camp hatch while there is someone on a hook disgust me.
---
Did a pretty good job so far
---
If they camp and you are hooked, you're next to screwed. But that doesn't mean your friends can't save you at the right time, or they won't get caught either. Kindred is a great anti-camp perk because if they are face camping or proxy camping you can see if they are near them or not, or your teammates can see you and where the killer is at. It should give a clear sign as to what to do for the others. It will possibly have to be a sacrifice you have to make.
---
What do you mean by 1 gen?
---
&gt; Perhaps intermediate or advanced tips?
---
Brave of you to assume I'm an intermediate or advanced player, haha. I'd like to continue these in some shape or form, but I'm definitely not a player who should be teaching others. I'm putting together some ideas for more specific guides, such as what to do when a team mate is getting camped, or the basics of individual killers.
---
still think the Huntress would be an awesome concept for a horror film, especially with the culty symbols on her new mask!!
---
So backwards to me how a manual shock won‚Äôt animation cancel survivors, but a random shock from their madness will.
---
Ironically one game all 3 people were either hooked or getting chased, while I legit stood unguarded in the corner of the map hooked, legit i was wide open because the killer was on the opposite side of the map, and everyone knew that with my kindred, and they legit never went for me. At. All. Total bullshit that game was tbh
---
lol why the eff is this a thing
---
You‚Äôre talking about Ardetha right?
---
No??? We just wanted to be nice??? She seemed to be happy in the end chat...

I always have that problem with generators

A dream if you run TOTH.

"When I starting play I very disappointing and very sad after my lose. If you want to make one goal to win you must lose. You can't win all games. We are people, you make mistake. You're not computer. And if you understand your mistake when you lose you just can make analysis game and continue play try to fix it, and it's no problem. More GG, more skill." - WhiteRa
---
I like it
---
Honestly, playing survivor helped me learn exactly which generators are gonna be the key ones. Once you know which generator you would want to go to, you'll know which one to check first as killer. Learning to defend gens is largely something that comes with time, but it's something I still have trouble with after 250 hours in game.
---
I‚Äôd say switch shadowborn for make your choice, it‚Äôs really good on wraith

custom dakimakura?

I must get lucky since I get more normal people than toxic

Just make sure your heart doesn't stop

also I'd like to get hex ruin but I don't want to have to put that much time into the hag was ruin ever in the shrine of secrets?

True, but remember, characters like The Hag were leaked because people were getting her challenges on the live game despite her not actually...you know...existing yet.
---
Lol wtf? Are you ok mate?
---
Report the comment
---
Why are you so personally offended by this? It wasn't supposed to be malicious.
---
At no point did op make fun of them or anything?? You have way too much time on ur hands if u go through this much effort to complain about video that was just supposed to be silly.
---
I doctor main and zap the fuck out of everyone. Just because I‚Äôm a terrible person.
---
I got it in the shrine awhile ago, and I know it's come back since. It's not too uncommon to see there.
---
They already spawn rarely next to generators.
---
Besides that, be careful what you wish for. All these totem spawning rules can be used by the survivor to find totems more efficiently. When I lool for Ruin etc. and I see a dull one then there isn't one close by in most cases so I move on from that area. Since they rarely spawn next to generators I usually skip around these areas too. 
---
If totems have too many of these obvious spawning rules it will only get easier for decent survivors to find them.
---
That second part is rather interesting.  However if they managed to get the rights they wanted, would they be able to work in a whole survivor and the original robes before the 28th?
---
Hate corn maps, especially with new legion
---
That makes no sense. Giving a shit killer pity sacrifices because you wanted to be nice? Delaying their already terrible match even further to run it in their face?
---
I'm sad Endgame is here, honestly. You can't hold shit killers like that hostage anymore.
---
Literally the experience of every player on this subreddit:
---
*Plays Survivor: 3 rank 20s who can't hit a single skillcheck and waste every pallet*
---
*Plays Killer: SWF of 4 godlike rank 1 teabagging TTV streamers with full meta loadouts, syringes, and flashlights who pop gens within ~40 seconds*
---
"Wait, you get not terror radius all the time when crouching?"  
---
"Yep, just about."
---
"So surely you're top tier!"
---
"..." *cries in oink*
---
One Word: Boo.
---
If rng favors the basement position it actually can be really good, specially if you fill it with traps
---
It would be cool if flashlights actually increased the speed of survivor actions by a really significant amount when shone on the action being performed.  Flashes already have such a low life with particular uses, that low skill/familiarity players often don't have a use for them.  At least this way they could legit say "I'm helping!" with an item boost.
---
LOL so you're not in a KYF it's an actual match where you can see even the Killer's name. This is a great bug.
---
No,I don‚Äôt want that
---
I knew it. so is it faster to solo repair a gen then two people working on it then? cause it never feels that way.
---
I didn‚Äôt lol
---
seems fair
---
Rank 20 is pretty easy to do when you already have an amassed knowledge of what your opponents do.
---
Found the key early on in the match thanks to Plunderer's instinct.
---
i dont undersand... explain
---
These would be good options, I always thought the obvious answer was Nathan drake
---
28 hits with no hook prox? WTF. Did they just pull that number out of their backsides?
---
Let's be real here: it's not 4v1, it's 1v3v1. It's always going to be you VS everyone else in the match. The best way to play the game is to assume that the survivors only want to farm or sandbag you, and that the killer will tunnel and camp you.
---
It really depends on context for me. If I did 3 gens, 2 unhooks, looped the killer for 2 minutes, cleansed all the totems, and my team couldn't manage to finish the other 2 gens collectively? I'll check to see if the killer is near them, but if they're proxying, I'll leave and camp that hatch. I deserve the escape a hell of a lot more than a potato.
---
But if it's a teammate who busted their butt? I'll go for the save regardless, or suicide on hook to give them the hatch if they're doing the same thing.
---
Definitely great, my character didn't show up in the lobby and the match start countdown stayed at 0:04
---
I never prestige my characters instead of pig because she didn't had anything else, I love the cat huntress one and now pig's costume is coming I am so happy for her
---
OMG I should play this game drunk that sounds so fun
---
As somebody who has had the timer run out while carrying somebody it forces you to drop them then it activates the kill since he was forced to drop you so close to the exit the game registered it as you crawling out and canceled being sacrificed by the entity.
---
I need the nea fixes.
---
Lol "BYE BITCH" üòÇ couldn't have said it better!
---
Alternate title: Dead by Daylight: Into the Horrorverse
---
What ?
---
Most likely.
---
That's actually so sick, really nice find dude
---
You don't even understand how piggie's traps work with endgame. They don't activate upon the last gen getting done, which gives you plenty of time.
---
Ops mom is still waiting for his first sentence
---
Really great guide, glad to see the time put into these. I want to emphasize on a few points that new killers will eventually learn. 
---
&gt; Know when a chase is going on for too long
---
As a survivor, I am happy to get tunneled. It makes me giddy. After thousands of hours, I know enough of how the maps work where I know I can keep a killer busy. Give me Dead Hard and Mettle of Man, and I can survive a *long* time in a chase. As a killer, I hate to tunnel anyways. I enjoy putting pressure on everyone and know when I need to admit defeat and get back to my primary objective - patrolling gens. 
---
&gt; Swing through that pallet, close the loop
---
Going through the ranks as a survivor during monthly resets, I see **far** too many killers "respecting" pallets. What does that mean? It's that momentary stop killers do so they don't get stunned. Experienced survivors take advantage of that. If I see a killer stop, I don't even drop the pallet - he has given me the distance I need to make that loop *again*. Connection wise, killers are given a huge advantage in landing hits they otherwise won't - take advantage of it and swing. You never know if you might get lucky with a hit. 
---
&gt; Keep track of generators
---
The 'ol three gen strat. When I load into a map as killer, I immediately look for a cluster of three generators and try to isolate them. Why? Cause survivors *have* to complete one of them. 7 generators spawn on every single map. Does that mean I commit to them all game and just abandon every chase? Of course not. But I keep an eye on them. If you haven't hooked a single person by the time the survivors have to complete one more generator, you're done. Cause every smart survivor will lure you away from that area so others can complete one. Try to check up on your three gens though occasionally if you can. Perks like Pop Goes The Weasel and Overcharge are really good for gen control.
---
LMFAOOOOO
---
The hatchet that can transcend across 3 different maps!
---
Well the first Evil Dead movie existed in the elm street universe with a scene of Ash himself being shown. The entity can talk people from different realms regardless of their relation to one another.
---
That one I would not know. I was just correcting the type of emblem you would get
---
Big yikes. Got looped for 30 seconds at a truck pallet and didn‚Äôt even make you throw it
---
Because instead of redoing where the totems spawn and how the game chooses their spawn location they just did a minor LoS at player spawn nonsense.
---
Literally nothing has been confirmed yet other than what was found in the game files. People need to stop treating conjecture as fact, as it's led to a lot of misinformation in the community.
---
This thing happened to me too.
---
And that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt camp the hatch as survivor anymore üëçüèª
---
Well dead hard only really works once because once the killer knows they can easily bait it out
---
No one cares
---
We can though. You just have to be lucky enough to get those Survivors in a game, and sacrifice them 25 times. What we need is the rest of the cast's faces to be added.
---
You tell em.
---
Meme
---
I have NEVER been able to get a damn trap off my head. Three machines in a row and all the things laugh in my face.
---
Survivors likely dont have codenames on their own because they dont have as much work required for them. 
---
There is also the licesining issues.
---
People don‚Äôt want to face op survivors anymore.
---
Purposely trolling for downvotes for a rush of dopamine; ok
---
You should really read the whole sentence. I said as a BACKUP.
---
Therefore I do not use insidious if people aren't toxic and disrespecting. But if they do I use it. As I wrote...
---
No, it's faster the more survivors, it just isn't as time efficient. 2 survivors will repair at 180% of the speed of one survivor. 4 survivors repair at 280% the speed of one survivor, so if it's just two of you, no big deal, but if it's 3 or 4 best split up.
---
It's just like Wraith. Can't let the babies get spooped by a sneaky Killer.
---
&gt;as much time of the \[other\]'s time as possible
---
Then aren't you the hypocrite for saying I'm the hypocrite? Since by the situations presented, a few minutes of the survivor's time isn't anywhere near the potential of a few hours.
---
You still don't get it do you. I bought a product that is evolving with time. I can have an opinion about a mechanic that is wrong without having the solution. Why? Cause i'm the costumer. I don't work there. I don't work in that field either. I can bring my complaint about the product to the dev and see what they do with it. In the working world how you like to put it you get paid for your ideas. Aint got shit to do with entitlement and more with just the way work places work. 
---
No i don't have an open mind about this. It's killers doing the same shit they have been complaining months/years over. Now that the tables turned it's all ok now? It's should have never been okay from either side but you seem to think it is. Which makes you come off very killer sided. If i can dc and save myself the 3 to 4 min and get into a new game already that's not childish but time efficient. If he wanted the kill he had his chance. He didn't take it so i'm moving on. 
---
My attitude is fine. You are just a bit delusional about how the real world works. If you pay for something you have the right to complain about it if you think something is wrong. I would be surprised about standing on a lonely hill cause i'm not delusional like you are
---
Mate...it‚Äôs a game where we like to have fun and do our own thing...it‚Äôs not pro league or competitive. You gotta chill out and have fun for once in your life. 
---
I do this too when the killer gets no sacrifices and I always let one survivor escape as a killer. It‚Äôs just based on what you want to do man. Relax and enjoy yourself
---
Oh no. Not... SKILLCHECKS!
---
perhaps for you. for me it would be just moving onto the next match and hope that killer aint toxic
---
Fuck i blew it my bad lmaoooo well what about the dribbling ?
---
The problem is the malice on both sides. I accuse you of benefiting from the toxicity because you have been defending assholery pretty hard this entire thread. One would only assume that you benefit from this toxicity in some way since you want to defend the killers doing this.

doesn't stop me from trying, though. :(
---
They could always delay the chapter if that happens. The 28th date was when the chapter would have been announced, not when it would have released.
---
The actual release date would be in early June.
---
Well the game is an easy 4K if you‚Äôre half decent
---
*Yet
---
I highly doubt they will ban everyone who accessed it right away.
---
My money is on them doing a huge ban wave soon.
---
Okay, so mobility and stalling. Another I was thinking of is Prioritization, basically the killer's ability to target individual survivors and cut chases short. 
---
Basically what I mean by "power over Survivors' resources" is the ability to turn Survivors' resources against them or ignore them altogether. The three highest scores in this category would probably be Trapper, Hag, and Nurse, because they can easily shut down powerful loops or ignore them altogether.
---
Do we really know that they give mid-Chapter patches country code names? And do we really know that they did not give Bill, Leatherface or Ash one?
---
Another thing pointing to there being no survivor is that the Fog Whisperer and dev affiliate Morf apparently said as much. And while the devs like making original characters, none of the costumes, sound effects or add-ons are taken from the franchise. What would the Scream license even be about, at that point?
---
That said, since the next (would-be) per-schedule Chapter release marks the game's 3rd year anniversary, it would indeed be weird for them to release a killer-only "Chapter" for that, and it being an off-brand Ghostface, at that.
---
I have no idea what the meta is so hillbilly and doc it is for me
---
Toxic is more like it.
---
This is why I always have trouble finding gens on indoor maps like The Game or Lery's.
---
I want a dead by daylight movie that's just complete madness, someone escapes their first trial but instead of running to the fire they run into the fog and encounter the many dimensions of the killers.
---
Like, they're running and all of the sudden they're in Haddonfield and they look around in confusion, it looks like a trial but  where are the walls? It just keeps going and going, and then in the distance the faint but all too familiar tune plays in the distance.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt increase the range of Amanda‚Äôs letter any higher than 20 meters, sure Myers has 32 but he also moves slower, has little to no lunge and doesn‚Äôt have a dash attack like pig, it also only works well on maps like lerys and game because Myers is so tall and easy to see
---
i'm...honestly kind of sad for you, both after reading your comments in this thread and another thread. if you can't play this game without always getting heated, maybe you should step away for awhile. the point of a video game is to have fun.
---
Yes it is
---
Bro the hype is real for this!
---
This would all fit into one category. Power of survivors would be a chaser category, for lack of a better word. It would be the killers ability to efficiently end a chase. 
---
It all depends on when ‚Äúchase‚Äù actually starts. If we‚Äôre talking about pallet chases only then billy is fairly weak since he can be looped, but if a chase would start as soon as you find a survivor then Billy is at the top again. You need prerequisites for this category.
---
Needing someone to heal you can be made easier by perks such as Bond or Empathy - anything that lets you see the other survivors - but yeah, if you're in solo queue it's often worth running Self Care.
---
Of course, but that doesn't change the fact that the flashlight can't be aimed downwards now does it?
---
You mean the mending bar? It got changed a lot. First of all, the killer can't see its progress anymore. And it only goes down when they are outside of your terror radius. So if you mean the mending it's not a bug
---
&gt;Why waste 32+ seconds self caring when you can use a medkit

FTFY

Remember that at the end of the day you aren't playing for money &amp; you won't have the worlds ire for losing a match.            It's just another lobby &amp; if you do horribly, there's always another match out there.            Even the saltiest post-game chatters will forget about you eventually.                    If you play Survivor, try out SWFs more.             The Discord is an awesome place  &amp; having a friendly voice in your ear goes a long way in cutting lose &amp; it's only helped grow in a ton of games.                 But remember: at the end of the day, you're only human and just as bound as anyone else to mess up.         Don't be afraid to call yourself on a bad play, surely.         But if you can't frame it constructively make a joke out of it.
---
*"I might've missed that Dwight by a country mile, but my Hatchet just murdered the shit out of that Exit-sign!"*
---
This and SWF plays into the same idea that, those who can ease up and let go are the ones who go the furthest.           
---
All that said if you play on Steam, my PMs are open &amp; I'd be glad to play.
---
I don't know why, but this made me laugh so hard. Thank you so much.
---
Lmao
---
that is some helpful info, thanks
---
Wouldn't the next survivor after Jane be Ash?
---
Ambush is useless at high ranks. Everyone knows how to listen to her breathing and the ritual is a pain in the ass to do
---
For what exactly? Not saving when there was no way to win the game for both of them? Two gens would take 2 minutes and 40 seconds. No way in hell a chase will last that long late into the game with little pallets left. Claud made the right play. 
---
And before you go and downvote me how about you tell me why im wrong instead?
---
WHY DID YOU NOT RECORD THIS
---
A lot of killers aren‚Äôt amazing at rank one
---
You fucking do that every damn time I try to talk to you about anything even if it's not important you just say K and to be honest it makes me feel rejected and unheard like nothing would be better that that bullshit who the fuck just says k after you tell them something important I just don't understand how you think that's ok and I swear to god you're probably just gonna say k to this but when you do you'll know that you're slowly killing me inside
---
Right. Running a stealth build and never getting seen is about the best way to depip
---
As killer main myself any killer that uses Noed are complete garbage no offense to the baby killers tho
---
[deleted]
---
Sorry for using a game mechanic my bad
---
This is the reason I record things now. LOL
---
All evidence points toward having Sidney as next Survivor, so fingers crossed, right?
---
It used to give a percentage based speed boost (which is why T3 Myers was extra spooky), but they changed it a while back so all killers go up to the same speed when lunging.
---
Well you‚Äôre really only supposed to use ambush attacks around loops or sneak one in when a survivor has nowhere to go
---
Stealth-

S: T1 Shape (only on S here because he has an add-on to limit himself to T1, plus detection perks don't work while in T1)

Are you sure it wasn't the aura from MOM?
---
How is that not already a perk?
---
I love the little killer blurbs.
---
They wont remove the map xD youll just have to wait until they decide to patch it up, until them you better pray to not get the map.
---
I don't care how many gens are left. If there's one survivor on the hook and they don't kill themselves, then you'll be damn sure I'll do my best to save their ass because that's the point of the game and that's what make it fun. Hiding in a locker for 2 min straight because you want the hatch isn't fun and is a bitchy move. I'd rather die trying than not doing anything at all. Just my opinion.
---
Sans confirmed for next killer?
---
Context: I had a game where my entire team was fucking worthless. There was one guy who was in a locker all game and the other guy who'd unhook me right in front of the Killer without Borrowed Time. (Third guy died real fast because of second guy farming them.)
---
The second time the guy without BT unhooked me I sandbagged him so the Killer would hook them instead of me. Then when the guy who was hiding in a locker all game got hooked I just camped hatch until they died.
---
Guy who was farming people off the hook then called me "useless" and told me "I hid in a locker all game" (because I went into a locker whenever they hooked someone because BBQ.) I told him I had about double his Bloodpoints and Iridescent in every category except Unbroken so he could kindly fuck off.
---
Ding dong ur opinion is wrong
---
Oh yeah. I‚Äôm still mad at Michael for killing that guy. He was so nice. ;-;
---
What do you mean by theme?

I have accidentally and shamelessly benefitted from this üò∂üò∂üò∂

When you select a killer, there's background music.

&gt;implying they all aren't behind that rock waiting for the save

Yeah green ranks are so much better................*hides all the dcs that have occurred the entire time while in green for more than 40 games*
---
That was atrocious. You would have gotten away so quickly without that lag.
---
These are so cool! I hope you find more topics to make more. Maybe map specific ones for survivors and killer specific ones? Like, one about Haddonfield mentioning the flickering lights tell you if a gen is being worked on or how The Thompson House only has one way to the second floor and can be dangerous to go to.
---
I'm not versed enough in every killer to offer various examples, but I do play a lot of Bubba, and my advice for him is to know when to basic attack a survivor and when to go for a chainsaw hit. Can't always find the time to saw a survivor in certain scenarios!
---
But still these are awesome. Nothing new advice wise to me but they still bring a smile to my face, I love them! ‚ô•
---
Big oof
---
RNG, bois
---
Which gaming system are you on? Also, some Killers are really good so try to look at it that way. Some killers are good, even good survivors have problems against good killers. No big deal, just a game, not a real life contest for $1 million dollars or anything.
---
Killer: About to curse
---
Me: No, don't do it!  I'm a virgin, aaaaaaaaaa
---
This means a bit out of date...
---
I want David to search me. Fully.
---
Dwight
---
omg that's funny
---
So it can't be used?
---
It was for the Teacher but never came to exist
---
it is pretty simple, motherfuckers don't heal, don't use feral frenzy and just down the motherfuckers
---
I knew Michael Myers was there somewhere. Can‚Äôt be complete without the other killer Ghostface copied an ability from!
---
Yes please
---
I'm sorry, there's no legion in this
---
How bout we fire you from this sub and we hire more shirtless Myers fans
---
I love how you turned this toxic conversation into a family-friendly one. No swearing shall be written in this place.
---
ok but if im fired im suing bc i didnt get paid a single time during my stay here
---
I thought that was a fun detail you included, three generators can be completed in under 2 minutes.
---
*Hatchet is loading, please wait...*
---
But it would still be cool if they added to the list. Meanface for Nea, Luckyface for Ace, Gamerface for Feng, Fightface for David, Prettyface for Kate, Teacherface for Adam, Roadieface for Jeff, and Gossipface for Jane.
---
‚ÄúWatch out, this is the part where the supposedly dead killer comes back for one last scare.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúNot in my movie.‚Äù
---
We‚Äôre all slaves to the entity, nobody gets paid except in BP. If you don‚Äôt leave in 2 minutes the entity will sacrifice you itself
---
Where is NOED?
---
I think you become an overall better player if you play BOTH survivor and killer, just knowing how the other side thinks really helps in keeping map/gen pressure as killer, and prioritizing certain gens and recognizing safe loops/pallets as survivor.
---
These are great guides for everyone and something I wish loaded on the screen for everybody in the game, I think another great idea is have a sort of "combined" guide that's useful no matter who you play, like learning about map layouts, learning about key gens, and even mindgames between survivor/killer.
---
but even if i try to leave youll just drag me back and force me to stay and die
---
You should make a little brochure of these lmao
---
The final few notes after the "Halloween" theme ended are the starting few notes for the popular song "Megalovania" by Toby Fox. The song was used in several of his works, most notably being the video game "Undertale" as the battle theme for one of the bosses of the game, "Sans". The song has garnered much popularity, and thus has become quite the meme over the years. 
---
It's a legitimately good rock/metal song, but it's been overused to death if you ask me. Don't get me wrong, I love the song, but holy shit I wish that I would hear something else when talking about Undertale. There's more than one song in the soundtrack, you know!

Platform: Pc

The killers chase music doesn't trigger sometimes. This has happened multiple times since the update.
---
You're overthinking it. Also see u/THapps post
---
Why do you want exclusivws in your console?
---
Bill is pc exclusive
---
How hard its that to understand? Oh right you probably want legcy back soo why bother arguing with you
---
&gt; but there's always that one Dwight or Claud that just loops me around them map the entire match
---
chase another survivor and get them to drop a bunch of strong pallets. then when the god survivor tries to loop you they don't have much to work with. 
---
also bamboozle, enduring, spirit fury combo says "fuck you" to basically every loop in the game.
---
A fake red stain could work if it were implemented differently, but the fact that it always just applies squarely on their back makes it so it almost never works.

---
Uhmm no.  Definitely not those fat cops you often see on TV shows/movies.
---
I'm just saying just to be fair and if I be a fun topic if we all talk would be a cool character for each system is that so wrong and I'm not here to start no damn War PC
---
Lol. You literally are your own problem, help your teammates.
---
Do you think you can find a link?
---
Just look it up. If you look hard enough you‚Äôll find out it‚Äôs a paragraph not a chapter. A cheater has a map, a survivor, and a killer. Paragraphs from what we‚Äôve seen so far either have 1 survivors (Bill or Ash) or one killed (LF)
---
I don‚Äôt know how you could implement it any other way that isn‚Äôt unreliably bad.
---
I don't know if I would call him a failed design simply because I feel like he was a good idea when he was released. But with all the new perks and such he's become less and less viable. I wouldn't mind a rework however, as long as he's better than before.
---
I like it, frankly anything that makes it so deep wound is more interesting is a thumbs up. You would have to adjust the deepwound timer to be longer or he would become way too strong at tunneling survivors.
---
‚ÄúI have this massive problem so rather than moving on I‚Äôm going to make this a problem for other people also.‚Äù Are you serious dude? You can‚Äôt complain about a problem and then proceed to contribute to that problem. It‚Äôs like someone complaining about how dirty an office is as they dump a bag full of garbage onto the floor.
---
This is actually how you lose, so don't do that
---
Okay, thanks. I'll put that it in there.
---
I only play solo and I run an altruistic build. Helps the team escape and helps rank up. We'll make it, bt, dh, sc.
---
&gt;I've had a few games where survivors who've died fed location information to the killer.
---
what
---
That's a big oof, my friend. :(
---
You must be my teammate in every game. All three of them
---
Dont think you can fix Nea..
---
I've had a few games WITH random survivors who've died and then gave my location away to the killer.
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
I guess you're right.
---
still though, it would be a cool killer concept; I mean we've never actually seen a professional killer before, the others got into it as a sort of hobby or sense of duty but never one that treated their actions as a profession; and they could play around with so many ideas ranging from ninjas, to mobsters, to ancient warriors.
---
Sauce?
---
Honestly not against since I‚Äôm tired of getting spammed during the match from a dead survivor
---
He is saying they messaged the killer his location,  probably so his swf team mates could get hatch or something tbh. Happens all the time.
---
Inb4 claudette's male version will look like my dad.
---
The path is yours fellow killer, either choose the toxic ebony or the kind streamers. It is up to you.
---
Saaaame, Overwatch just got stale after playing for too long, idk how dbd hasnt!

i'm always the kind who don't like to leave someone behind. If this happens to me I'll REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ENDLESSLY
---
Next time you buy something from the Shrine, especially on the last day of Shrine, wait a few minutes before you close the game app or it won't save properly. Also, if it's a major Shrine buy, close the game app and restart it just to make sure you got it.
---
When I was going for the wraith trophies I had a pretty fun game where a particular Claudette was giving me a good challenge. 
---
Sacrificed all the other survivors and she was the only one left, so because I downed her about twenty metres from the hatch I decided I'd just let her win by carrying her over there.
---
Instead she just disconnected as soon as I picked her up and sent a message saying "your so shit" lmao. She would have gotten a lot of BP from the match considering she seemed to be going really well, but the loss just really upset her or something.

Always funny to hear all the toxic stuff players do on this subreddit but will applaud this. People are right when they say the DBD community is toxic, and it starts here
---
Ouch, fuck that guy. For advice, honestly  just always be doing something like cleansing totems, or doing a generator. That‚Äôs more then what seems like 70% of the survivors do in this game anyway. You don‚Äôt need to be good at looping a killer, or getting 4Ks every match to be good at the game. Killer can be a lot more stressful as doing something productive all the time is mandatory at the higher ranks, but also you don‚Äôt have a team to let down. So maybe you might like it? If you have any other people to play with you could do a private match to practice? I‚Äôm on Ps4 unfortunately so I can‚Äôt help too much because according to Reddit all console players are bad.
---
i wasnt being serious
---
I like bitter murmur a lot more than distressing bc it actually gives useful info
---
This post is a clear hate speech stuff. Xenophobic much?
---
Alright, got it. I'll try to keep that in mind next time, thanks.
---
I've seen this on PS4 many times. Seems like the survivor doesnt see that it's blocked on their end so they can still go through.
---
If you truly like something you will admit it's flaws so you can make it better
---
I don't have any of the dlc for the game (yet, anyway). 
---
It is tempting, though hehehe.
---
I thought this was just my joystick acting up!
---
Honestly, I suck at chases too, but I usually use perks to help me out a little bit. I‚Äôve found that any exhaustion perk (most preferably balanced landing or lithe) paired with something like quick and quiet and/or dance with me is very very helpful.
---
Hes $5.00 usd and was my first dlc him and myers.
---
The sawyers are a very clearly deep south family. If we're going by stereotypes I'm sure they don't mind doing blackface

Seriously. What's wrong with some Hopes and Dreams once in a while?! Or maybe Spider Dance? Hell, I'll even take I'm Sorry's Theme! Just anything other than the Bone Boys or the Goat Couple!
---
I don‚Äôt mean to be rude because I know this is for new killers, but aren‚Äôt all 5 of these common sense? I‚Äôd be surprised if anyone played a few games and didn‚Äôt figure these out instantly
---
Medkits do work, but they have a limited number of charges, which you notice real quick against a killer whos whole power is based around getting the first hit.
---
Nothing, just chillin watchin the game...
---
Lots of encouraging "feel good" tips here. But also remember you're not entitled to be an asshole to other players  and disconnect just cause you have anxiety. 
---
Accept some responsibility in life (in the case of DBD and other games it means not DCing) even if it is unpleasant. I assume this avoidance issue translates in other areas of your life too. 
---
I recommend Jordan Peterson's lectures on how to overcome anxiety and become a decent human being. Don't hide behind your anxiety as an excuse, or you will become a pathetic human being who self victimizes and never achieves anything worthy. Yes the feeling is gonna be there for a while but you have to fight it not run away from it.
---
its fine i aint mad
---
Where are the mods we need this stickied.
---
and here you see the legion in their natural habitat
---
hatch standoff was a stalemate, that was the issue, neither person had the advantage outside of just who got bored first.
---
Gen gets done, killer knows where to look, you're relying on the killer being dumb to pull that off, not to mention that at ANY point of you doing gens all the way up to powering/opening the gate, that ENTIRE time the hatch is in play and the killer can just close it and start the countdown, the only way is to just hope the killer messes up. 
---
I don't know how badly you either play killer or if you go up against rank 20s, but it isn't hard to just look at the gates and see which one has even a little progress on it, unless you're assuming you have enough time to stealth around little by little to slowly open the gate...oh wait you don't because the EGC timer is going off.
---
The only way it's fair is if yes the killer closes the hatch themselves before clarifying where the survivor is, the killer doesn't have to do that though especially if there are any number of gens to be done, the killer loses nothing by just staying at the hatch.
---
and gates very often DO spawn side by side, if not they at least spawn within eyeshot of each other, like I mentioned at that point, the killer doesn't even have to hit/down/hook the survivor which plays into a huge part of the problem. They just have to find them and it's basically it as the entity will just off the survivor after a little bit of time.
---
I also didn't even bring up how several common killer perks and just killer powers in general can make it even less likely that the survivor even has a somewhat fair chance. Anyone who can move around the map fast, the invisible killers, several tracking perks, and so on makes it even less likely to somehow hide after you give away your position from completing a gen in the first place.
---
My MAIN issue as a whole is that the killer can just hold the hatch hostage AND also has priority over it when both players arrive at it. I personally wouldn't mind the former if the latter wasn't a thing. Make the hatch victory do what they say it should do, the person who gets to it first wins; not the survivor gets there first, stares at it for 10 seconds while the last 1 dies and then the killer zooms over and cancels out the jumping animation of the survivor and basically wins.
---
Might be a dumb question but how frequently do you reset the cache on your ps4? I only lag during endgame when I leave my ps4 actively on for more than about 5 hours at a time
---
Once I had to do something too but I was a survivor, so I entered in a locker and left. When I came back I had escaped, still don't know how...
---
Stop vaulting?
---
I'm not even devotion 88 and I've got about 170 hours in the game lol
---
This makes sense. My thing is ghostface was incomplete. We would have had no way to access a map in a dev build. If it is absent from the game files it's probably not done. Detailed maps take longer than one character model. We just truly dont know.
---
There are weapon wielding people chasing you for fun and you‚Äôre questioning the reception coverage? Same.

---
The number 1 thing that will help you shake a killer off your trail is to lose line of sight. Once you lose
---
LOS of the killer, you must take note of your surroundings and make the appropriate judgement based on how far they were away when you lost LOS. Perks that help you lose the killer in a chase include: quick and quiet, lightweight, dance with me, iron will, urban invasion, etc.
---
The number 1 thing that will help you win chases as a killer is to git gud. AS NURSE. Don't @ me.
---
where did you get this cause i want 8
---
That's like a 10 second difference
---
I feel like a really useful tip go over camping.
---
When you get a survivor on the hook, of course you'd like to kill them. But you'd likely prefer more kills. If you don't have something keeping you at the hook such as another survivor you know is close by, start moving to another generator. The time it takes for a survivor to go from 1st hook to dead is 2 minutes, it only takes 80 seconds for a generator to be completed by 1 survivor so in the time you spend securing 1 kill the survivors can nearly do all the generators.
---
It just comes outta now where. Either that or it jist drags the survivor on the ground by a rope.
---
Black splinter turns you into The Pig for the trial you‚Äôre using it on. Add-ons do nothing
---
Or am I missing something
---
What?
---
In general when you think someone‚Äôs lag switching on console, they‚Äôre probably not. My internet occasionally goes out of wack and I get all sorts of accusations, so be mindful of your own.
---
In general the lack of hacking is probably the console version‚Äôs most defined strength. That isn‚Äôt to say lag switching is hard. From what I hear it‚Äôs pathetically easy but people tend to chill on console.
---
That would be dope. Vigo would be even cooler though
---
I have yet to watch. Do- Does he do the thing?
---
PC Map is Ormond. Pulled a yellow med kit out of a chest and I tried to heal myself with it and it would not make any healing progress.
---
Is plague just not picked often? I'm rank 13 and play a fair bit and have literally never played against her. I'm very thrown off by it
---
Basically just shitting on op for being nice and giving the killer some kills and saying it was for ‚Äúkarma whoring‚Äù
---
I know exactly how you feel. I have very bad anxiety too and online games exacerbate it. If you're looking for a swf pal who won't judge let me know :)
---
are you rank 4? every feng i see is rank 4, every single time
---
There are killers that are played more often than others the higher in rank you go. At rank 1, you might never see a killer like the Hag or the Clown, but you will see a lot of Hillbillies and Nurses
---
Says they're using the offering on Trapper, with a Huntress weapon but she's Pig in game.
---
they loaded in as huntress, it said they were trapper, but they used a shard for pig
---
I had trouble the other night. We are around the same time zone and console. My matches earlier were pretty much instant joints for survivor.
---
Thank you!
---
Uhhh? All it does is let you play a killer with nothing on. No add ons or anything..... but it shows in the end screen who they were originally gonna play
---
Oh, I didn‚Äôt realize it said Trapper. Thanks mate
---
Well it seems this is gonna be a full chapter, so odds are prettyyy good we‚Äôll be seeing a survivor. There‚Äôs a post from ~3 weeks ago where somebody allegedly saw Sidney‚Äôs name in game, so if that wasn‚Äôt Photoshopped, I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a good indicator that she could be coming.
---
It's a bug
---
That makes sense, it's hard to gauge I guess. I just find it a little odd. Don't see clown very much either
---
Yes, the do do do thing
---
Just to put into perspective of how 'cheapo' I can be: 
---
I got 30 hours of my steam hours for dbd through 2 or 3 free weekends before I eventually got it.
---
Buuut, I didn't even buy it, one of my friends was sick of waiting for the free weekends to play with me so he bought it for me.
---
They‚Äôre literally gonna tell us who‚Äôs behind the mask when the backstory comes out. So if it specifically says Nea CUNTSON well you‚Äôre right. Otherwise it‚Äôs gonna be one or two of the killers from one of the Scream movies.
---
It's most likely a bug than a feature. Then again, it's BHVR so it will become a feature before it is even fixed.
---
I'm pretty sure this is fake.
---
That's the post I'm talking about when I said shady. They also had woodsboro pop up when they spawned into haddonfield supposedly.
---
I fear for the world now that I have heard this
---
It says you‚Äôre The Trapper because using a Splinter sets you to him regardless of who you were playing as. So you went into the game as The Huntress, played as The Pig, and now have The Trapper selected. Everything there UI-wise is correct, it‚Äôs just a consequence of DBD‚Äôs weird Splinter mechanics always setting you to The Trapper.
---
Evil within 4 is Meyers chainsaw dashing like billy
---
I did that once to an afk Jake, carried him right to the exit gate and he escaped would've loved to have seen his reaction

You can be cheap and get all the original killers with in game currency. Leatherface is 4.99 though. You NEED that perk.
---
Long story short: this game is fundamentally disastrous in a lot of ways.
---
Hillbilly is a relic of pre meta design and he‚Äôs never really been tweaked so he‚Äôs kind of stupid broken. On the flipside, Wraith is pretty awful because of this fact.
---
Stealth killers in general struggle because most of DBDs maps aren‚Äôt really doing you any favors stealth wise. Lots of open space, on maps like auto haven there‚Äôs basically no cover, corn vision etc. It‚Äôs not their kit that‚Äôs the issue so no tweaks to their design will help unless they change their fundamentals. The maps and the game‚Äôs pace have to adjust to help slower paced killers.
---
But wait, uh oh. Now Billy and nurse are even MORE broken now that the game‚Äôs slowed down for everyone else. 
---
Honestly it‚Äôs really not much of a stretch to say that Billy and Nurse are holding this game‚Äôs meta, flow and play style hostage just by existing. If they aren‚Äôt changed, the game can‚Äôt change, so stealth killers will have no change to benefit from.
---
I‚Äôm just making a joke bc Nea is the real killer... lol
---
I'd appreciate it and be happy to play with you! :) I'm on PC.
---
A lot of people play, they've been doing server experiments
---
Like I said ‚Äúentitled‚Äù survivors.
---
Me too! I pretty much exclusively play survivor just so you know though I'm no good at killer haha.
---
You have a REALLY bad approach to telling him this, he said it was a small idea, meaning it was open to change, if you have a suggestion, place it here, if not, move on, simple as that. Nothing here says "reply with a sarcastic comment trying to make the creator feel dumb
---
Hopefully [this one](https://imgur.com/Qmy9uNe) is more legible.
---
I think I'm Rank 11 or something, I'm currently at work so I can't check, an I just started playing survivor this season like Tuesday, but for me I haven't waited longer then a couple minutes.
---
If your Xbox has been on for like 5-6  hours I recommend restarting it, I have no proof but whenever I can't find lobbies and my box has been on for a long time I find restarting it helps out.
---
Also check your Nat type, an if anything else play a round of killer an go back, maybe theres just a kink in the server.
---
Leatherface transcends race and gender. He wants to wear everyone's face.
---
Tunneling has very little counterplay and is a mindlessly easy way to secure kills.  I prefer my killer games to be fun for both sides and I am typically pretty confident in my play so I go out of my way to chase the new survivor most of the time.  Games last longer I get more points, they get more points and I pip way easier.  Tunneling is just a painfully unfun and skilless way to approach the game.
---
Honestly, the game's flaws are purely caused by simple and not entirely thought out core mechanics of the game itself, and the character perks
---
.
---
it was a known thing on ptb. didn't think they'll bring it to live, oof, before fixing hitboxes.
---
Or the fat cops in my hometown
---
No..
---
I would love something like and have hoped for it for a long time
---
You right
---
That was a bug with hatchets double registering due to dedicated servers and the like. Also there are no ‚Äúheadshots‚Äù in DBD as there are no ‚Äúhead‚Äù hit-boxes for the survivors. Survivors have capsule hit-boxes that cover their entire body, so as long as the killer‚Äôs weapon hits a part of the capsule, it‚Äôll count as a hit.
---
Maybe but in order for them to be in the entity‚Äôs world they need to have committed great violence and despair and etc. so it‚Äôs gotta be a person.
---
I doubt it but I'll post an update if I am.
---
I've done that if you pick them up and drop them with your back facing the exit the final time, he'll be facing the exit when he escapes and you can smack them out
---
Deliverance. ;)
---
They gave him that "oops I farted"  look on his face for some reason
---
Part of the upcoming anniversary event. Survivors can gather charms and killers grab the cakes from meathooks (it says in the files)
---
Another Nea killer joke.
---
thatd be neat
---
Yeah I know. I‚Äôm just saying what if the entity couldn‚Äôt/didn‚Äôt choose just one of them? Kinda like Legion except it‚Äôs just the overall concept of all of the Ghostface killers meshed into one being.
---
I'd prefer a crafting system where you can fuse weak add ons to turn them into the stronger versions or mix up several non related ones and get a random stronger add on
---
i don't blame her. probably tired of getting bled out as the last survivor.
---
Why is this locker shit such a strong concept? Its uninteresting and would only be viable at rank 19-20.
---
This guy got stuck on that tree.
---
I always help my teammates when I play solo. You might want to try getting good.  Have a nice day.
---
Made me actually LOL. All I have is Silver...take it.
---
How would you use Frenzy to vault a window after downing somebody?
---
Downing somebody with an M1 or Frenzy hit on old Legion would result in your entire meter being drained, so doing that is impossible unless you ran a Pin (a pretty shit add on) or they just let themselves fall over (not likely).
---
Having it leave half your meter is a pointless change, but it feels nice so I'm not complaining about it.
---
I have gotten this as well, on various maps, with a med kit I brought in. My progress bar was not moving and the charges on my med kit were not going down.
---
"This looks like a groovy spot to find some medkits."
---
Its probably jist bad lag given its on console
---
Jesus this is oddly specific yet very relatable
---
Praise feng min xD
---
In less lore terms someone removed the mask off the model and there's actually nothing under it
---
Good job for researching the actual definition of abuse. Clearly it isn't abusing anything.
---
Upvoted for saying "they" instead of "him".
---
Whats with the "this is not happeneing"? just part of the template?
---
Theres still 2 gens left with only 2 people. It would be quite extraordinary if more than one of you managed to escape, but unless they weren't doing anything the whole game, you should really just let yourself die because going for the save here really is only going to end up getting you both killed unless you run for 2 whole gens with only one person repairing which would be a nearly 2 minute run.
---
He plays dbd so makes sense
---
is it me or most matches spawn gates so close to each other now?
---
With your use of ‚Äúfunner‚Äù as a legitimate word, I‚Äôm going to assume you‚Äôre not too bright. 
---
If you have these experiences happening to you, you‚Äôre low rank, and that‚Äôs your fault. 
---
If I had to guess, you‚Äôre a new player whose fuming on here after dying two games in a row due to ‚Äútunneling‚Äù. 
---
So have fun on PC lmao
---
NDAs were broken.
---
Theyd become pointless
---
No, i used to be in high ranks when i played more often, so it doesnt effect me much. But this needs to be fixed because its gonna turn alot of newer or casual players away when they get steamrolled by high ranks. 
---
Since theres no reward system, the only reason for ranks is to keep players around the same skill level together for better gameplay. So it would be nice if thats how it worked out everytime
---
Where's Evil Within I
---
Yeah....
---
Yeah when you dc, it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre frustrated over a perceived injustice. It doesn‚Äôt really matter what actually happened, but you don‚Äôt care about points, pips, other survivors or the killers points.
---
They nailed it for Feng and botched it for everyone else.
---
1. Did he just stand next to a hook go afk and just die.
---
Not really, I've seen a lot of skilled players use different tactics to survive. In the end pallet looping has always been a problem that devs couldn't find an asnwer to.
---
Anyway I still think it's a good idea. a lot of loops end up after the 2nd round. So it would just help slower killers, and to be honest it would not be completely broken, it would just reduce it to: run around a pallet once, then drop the pallet before the killer gets to it and run away. So it still gives you some time.
---
I was talking bout ebony and bps but thanks for info will use
---
Maybe I'm showing my kinda newbness, but what do you mean by moonwalking, and what does it accomplish?
---
But someone in red ranks obviously will have more skill and experience than a rank 18ish new player. Ranking up really isnt too hard but you still need some decent knowhow to get there. That skill gap ruins games for unexperienced players
---
It was to do with the dedicated servers used on the PTB. They were testing traffic on them, so bugs like this existed and they were far from perfect. It's not a bug that should ever make it to the main game.
---
I hope they get her likeness like they did with Bruce Campbell
---
There‚Äôs an official mercy store :)

---
&gt;Did he just stand next to a hook go afk and just die.
---
He wasn't AFK. It was a Bill crouching in a corner. He was the first I caught during my chainsaw run.
---
What does that stand for exactly?
---
I mean i just dont see how you get 1 point and not dc?
---
What ruins games are crybabies who DC on first down, or because "OMG it's another X killer", or because of "gen rush", who camp with 5 gens and 1 DC because their Ruin was cleansed.
---
I'm in love with those Kate edits
---
Plays like this are why I started playing the game. Just insane fun with friends.
---
Doesnt every game get stale after too long? lol
---
100% agree with you on that
---
Guess I know what I‚Äôm gonna run on surv now fixed all my problems
---
plunderers is god-tier now because of the amount of keys/rainbow maps you get
---
No, pipping depends a lot more now on how much chasing/number of hooks you get

---
Uh, no? *laughs* If someone screws you over, it's called vengeance. Toxicity is actions that you do for no other reason than to be an ass and elicit an emotional response. Like smacking your ass into the ground constantly after you pull a pallet down.
---
If we had an Assassin, I think a fitting power would be to climb walls leading up to windows.
---
Decreased Vault speed
---
It actually kinda helps both sides,as a survivor you can get more distance between you and him. As the Killer some people have said its easier to keep track of the survivor if he tries to do the good old Window trick.
---
Also the window animation looks much better now,the pallet one feels like slow mo though.
---
Increased Fatigue time
---
If Legion had his old 3 Seconds then he would be way to overpowered with his 115% movement speed. Even now with 4 Seconds you can easily catch up to a survivor,and thats without any CD addons.
---
Besides that,there is another very strong build out there. It Utilizes the Iridescent Button and i think the Sketch book,green addon that increases the duration of Feral Frenzy
---
Perks are: Thanatho,M&amp;A,Nurses and Sloppy/Ruin and its incredibly strong since you can keep everyone injured for 80% of the game.
---
Now imagine this with 3 Second cooldown,would be WAY to strong.
---
Feral Frenzy bar needs to be full
---
Basically you could hit a survivor,chase him stop the ability and either he somehow gets to a window or you kill him. If he reaches the window you could simply reactivate the abillity and jump through the Window.
---
At the same time,if a survivor manages to outrun you and your abillity runs out you could simply close the gap with your 115% and wait till your bar has 10% and hit them. Its stupid.
---
Missed Attacks
---
Simple,give survivors a chance to win against him besides using loops. If you somehow manage to dodge his attack then legion will be in a very bad spot for a few moments.
---
Not sure why you feel like Legion should be the special snowflake that gets no drawback when missing. 
---
Addon Changes
---
Movement Speed addons would destroy the whole reason why his Feral Frenzy is BELOW 150% MS. The reason for that is to make Exhaustion perks more useful,with the old legion a Survivor with sprint burst could not outrun you at all.
---
Now they can,so why give legion back the ability to literally make the most useful survivor perks useless?
---
With the best feral frenzy duration you can run for A LONG time,try the build out i recommended at the top. Now,yes it doesnt use the tracking addons,because i feel like they dont add any value regardless,but you can make these addons work if you combine them with the duration addon.
---
The joke is that killers sometimes falsly accuse survivors of being swf because they plax well
---
WHERE SHIRTLESS DWIGHT
---
Not dlc but I recommend nea
---
I mean sounds like they were mad you went all out in a 3v1 but you do you. Who cares what they say
---
I didn‚Äôt go all out I wasn‚Äôt taking the game serious once I saw the first person DC. I didn‚Äôt want to leave the game so I put up with it half the time I was letting them go
---
I really don't feel like going into further discussions on all of those other killers. None of those "punishments" compare because they are tied to abilities that actually kill survivors, whereas Frenzy stabs do not - *and even then they are not as punishing as Legion's current punishment is* (apart from Leatherface). Nurse has a shorter fatigue than Legion, even after missing a hit. That's ridiculous. Legions punishment is grossly disproportinate to the power of their ability, which is strictly non-lethal.
---
Just like Plague gets slowed down, so would Legion upon missing a stab. If you can argue, without just mentioning other killers, why Legion deserves a punishment as severe as ending and depleting Frenzy entirely upon missing a hit, rather than going into a missed attack cooldown and losing some of their Frenzy bar, that would be a better starting point to discuss. I see no reasonable argument for the punishment for missing a Frenzy stab being this severe.
---
That said, I don't think this is a make-or-break change either, since landing hits is something hard to mess up, though it can certainly happen without it necessarily being the player's fault, since hit detection is not immaculate.
---
But survivors t-bagging at doors was fine LUL
---
Because only pros use it /s
---
Moonwalking means walking backwards while still facing forwards. Basically, Killers have a red light coming from their face that Survivors can see to help notice which direction the Killer is facing. The red light (called red stain) always appears in the direction where the Killer is facing on their screen. Since the red stain reaches a bit further than the Killer‚Äôs model itself, it allows Survivors to track the Killer in a chase even if they can‚Äôt see the Killer itself (like if the Killer is behind a wall for example).
---
So moonwalking is basically just trying to trick the Survivor into thinking your going forwards (because they‚Äôll see your red stain) even though in reality you‚Äôre walking backwards to cut off a loop. Playing mind games with the red stain is something that separates the mediocre Killers from the great Killers, and it‚Äôs somethint anyone who wants to climb the ranks as a Killer main should learn to do.
---
Myers and Leatherface are both very easy to use and can secure 4ks relatively simply.
---
Myers has great addons, Leatherface has great perks
---
Anyone want 50 Lery offerings?
---
I love those maps! I play survivor more than I do killer though. I'm VERY "cornblind" when I do killer challengers.

He did have it.

Maybe not unlimited, but by default a good 6 or 7. Then she can get most of her deviousness points.

It's the way he runs with his knife raised
---
Haddonfield is okay. Seems like the only time I get it is when it's the one round out of 100 that I don't use balanced landing.
---
Don't have much of an opinion on Ormond. It's meh. Haven't played it too much tbh. 
---
If I had to pick a least favorite map I'd say it's Springfield. There's like no pallets on that map.
---
I'm aware, I mainly wanted to base this off the stealth killers, and skip the obvious legion/ghostface joke
---
Yeah I feel that. If I'm getting stomped it's one thing, but I really hate it when survivors go out of their way to be annoying. Like body-blocking on hooks or t-bagging after EVERY pallet drop or window vault. Like, why? I know I suck at killer, I'm only here for dailys, leave me alone.
---
Source Filmmaker
---
Yeah good legions didnt get fooled by that, but not everyone is a good player or want to invests that much effort into a game. 
---
Saying that Thanat is bad is just you being ignorant. Thanat is bad on most killers because noone can keep it at 100% efficency, Legion can do that and that makes Thanat a good Perk.
---
Instead of spitting out stuff you cleary have no idea about,why dont you go ahead and try it yourself? Would do you good.
---
Into the Dwighter-verse?
---
That‚Äôs a meg
---
Then why complain here?
---
Just picked up the game a couple days ago, thanks fella
---
Nice, wanna match up sometime?
---
I main killer and usually i stomp but 4 man swf that is smart are easily stronger than any killer except nurse. It can be hard to do anything, i dont care much for flashlights or anything "toxic" but im just waisting time if i have only downed 2 people and there are already 2-3 gens done.
---
I might as well leave and go find another game and not get matched with them again.
---
Why do I love this
---
Yeah checking the ping before is a must imo. But sometimes the ping can be good in lobby and once in game it just goes berserk.
---
survivors actually complain about literally everything. If the survivors had it their way there would be a billion pallets, nurse could only blink once, and they had a gun and could kill the maniac once they finish one gen.
---
From a survivors point of view I like haddonfield, I don't play nearly enough killer to know how that side of the game thinks about certain maps. If you say it's bad for killers, I just gotta trust it.
---
Damn that sucks dude, that is really dumb
---
No, it wouldn't be politically correct to have ONLY Claudette's face as an option. It would also be not politically correct to exclude Claudette as the only one of the original 4 BECAUSE she's black.
---
The only reason this turns into an issue of political correctness is because of OVERLY PC people who immediately go there and go "anything that could be offensive is" without looking at the context.
---
All 4 of the survivor's faces as masks has nothing to do with their race, gender, whatever.
---
Guess i'm wrong, but are you forced to watch him? Because i think is as easy as don't give a fuck. Same goes for Ochidoo fans.
---
I brought a flashlight after facing 4 Hags in a row.
---
I bring Lightborn if I see 2+ flashlights.
---
There are several issues that make it bad. It's very difficult to get from point A to B because of the houses. Houses also make it hard to check gens quickly. Many areas of the map are safe and can't be made unsafe because they don't rely on pallets.
---
Right? Just make it an actual wall at that point. Hope it's some stupid oversight.
---
https://imgur.com/9y9o8Ep

Same here, tried to play yesterday and today, couldnt find a single match.
---
Maybe I'm not patient enough.
---
Dude im a red rank player but i still enjoy these posts, wish i knew some of those things back in the day.
---
One, it's built into Steam anyway so it's basically impossible for them to hide that information.
---
Two, for a SURVIVOR to message the killer with the intent of getting you killed, let alone "a few games," that's some pretty huge evidence you're an awful teammate. Do you leave people on hooks for 1+ minutes while you crouch next to the hatch? Do you pull teammates off the hook in front of the killer? Do you urban evade around the map while the rest of your team plays the game?
---
I know this seems judgey, but that's an EXTREME thing to happen multiple times, maybe start looking at what you're doing to make teammates hate you that aggressively.
---
You‚Äôre just whining over the fact that a streamer shit talked you through a screen.
---
But yea angrypug is a toxic fuck and people who watch him do it because they‚Äôre so socially awkward so they need to watch someone that treats people like shit.
---
Troll clown shoots self in for foot
---
It's really not. Almost every single pallet on that map is turbosafe, the issue is navigating it, but if you can route it properly you wont die lmfao.
---
That's the point, you couldn't have done anything, you lost fair and square but the killer chose to drag out the game. The killer A) wiped your team B) found the hatch before you and C) found you before you could open the gate. If you want to prevent this again, then A) repair 5 gens B) find the hatch first C) wait for the killer to check and leave the door to give the maximum time opening it. Survivors have enough chances and I'm so tired of the whining about EGC. I play both roles and EGC hasn't affected my escapes as survivor but it has helped me get the deserved 4k as killer (and even then sometimes the last survivor escapes). Nothing personal, but survivors need to stop wanting the game completely balanced in their favour, as if 3 chances (as above) isn't enough to escape.
---
I decided to look into it anyway...
---
adding the same sound effects ochido uses, but without the camera work makes you... a much worse version of ochido. you want to stand out, you're copying him too much.
---
being kinda like ochido, but worse makes your content fall into the uncanny valley. for the whole video I was asking myself "why am I even watching that, when I could've been watching ochido instead?"
---
The movie robes were longer and went towards the feet while the devil's is more cultish and shorter they also  have different gloves and pants compared to the movie. They look way different in my opinion plus they probably just wanted their own twist on ghostface instead of adding the actual robes.  there were multiple instead one of one person so it could be a different person as GhostBoi then the people we see in the movies.
---
Its a small map so creating pressure is fairly simple, its one of the few maps that actually have good totem spots and the pallets can be mindgamed.
---
Oooh very cool. Thanks.
---
Ahhh. Gotcha, thanks.
---
It doesn't have to be their only power. If it's too weak add a second power like Pig with her crouch and RBT, and Ghostface with his stalk/crouch/hiding terror radius.
---
Ochido kind of memes
---
Then Bubba unmasked because you just can't kill Ash.
---
Leatherface, he's so hot right now.
---
For complete noobs: don't be afraid to let people get off the hook, go check generators, chase other people, if you stay near the hook you're not applying pressure to the 3 other survivors in the match.
---
I play it for the butt dancing.
---
it was fine when survivors were teabagging for 5 minutes instead of leaving, wasn't it?
---
it was fine when back in 2016 one streamer had his game held hostage for 2 hours, wasn't it?
---
can't you just wait for 2 minutes when killer wants to get some kind of revenge for those 3 years?
---
Oh he did, well less impressive than I thought but still impressive. Wasnt sure about montos perks cuz I saw it Noobs drunk by daylight video.
---
What are you? 12? just don't watch him, it's that easy unless you're inmature, which explains this post and whinning.
---
Yea I get that, but the default ones still looks like something from Assassin's creed when the devil robes at least look somewhat similar, could had made that the default without the red markings is what I mean.
---
No mither is also a great counter to noed
---
15 year old Feng
---
I saw his first time playing and it made me cringe so hard...
---
You went into his stream and started calling him out on drinking (what are you a child or something?) and insulted him for being fat. 
---
You sound like the toxic one in the situation you described.
---
Ok now this is a good idea. But would the bonus be offered towards killers to? I'm guessing yea
---
I think 1 cell for 1st consecutive game, 2 for second, 3 for 3rd and capped at 3 cells per game thereafter's pretty fair? That'll give us a way to earn cells to get outfits or characters without spending real life money too.
---
This sounds real coo.
---
The other exit was on the other side of the map. Since killers have faster walking speed and the map was the smallest one out of all maps, id say that needs to be balanced. I would argue that there is no point in having one survivor at the end if there is no way of defeating said killer.
---
A) You have to trust that the other survivors you play with do 5 gens, rarely happens unless SWF at High Ranks
---
B) Finding the hatch first is always a low chance, and since the killer speed is faster than a survivor he finds the hatch first majority over the survivor, also said killer usually sees the hatch during game so already knowing where the hatch is defeats the purpose of ECG most of the time
---
C) In this match the exit was opposite each other. But the speed of the Doctor on Meat Plant let him go from one side to other in no time at all, hence the video showing that.
---
I think before blaming a whole community of survivors, you should look at the mechanics of the level and the speed of said killer playing at the time, and how the balance works on each level with each killer. The fact is the DEVS are making so much money that they don't test these things.
---
Instead leaving it to a Biased community on PTB
---
Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm in green ranks but it literally takes less then 30 seconds to get a full lobby.
---
while were at it lets fight violence with violence, good tip.
---
i have no problem with main buildings or whatnot. sometimes it gives me pain but oh well. still mindgameable and you can just drop the chase or make them block window. but when someone abuses a bug and not even once(like that lil dude in my rant) that is... upsetting as it is already. but leaving hate comments and taunt a person after abusing a bug is just.. ugh.
---
This Spirit is HOT.
---
Its fun when it works. I like to do this build but with DH instead of boil over. I usually only do it if I'm with an SWF and we all bring sabotage boxes since you're pretty much guranteed to wiggle out if you sabo one hook and get a good bonus on flip flop.
---
Hey Skemoo just wondering if you can give us the Ghostface rendering but with the devils robe and default head/mask. I just want to see how that looks since I find it looks more like the original movie than the Assassin's creed default looking version.
---
Billys braindead lol hes almost as good as nurse and not nearly as hard, basically just a free way to red ranks
---
The real killer in this is the absolutely pathetic useless Megatron.
---
Yes, killers too. Without killers the survivors don't have a game to play.
---
Never saw a sympathetic survivor in a while
---
100% this
---
everyone keeps saying Game's good for totums smh
---
have you met Lery's?
---
I feel like the new ghost face we got is probably a cult and each outfit is a rank of the cult like the devil is the leader and the recolors are like base minions or something idk. I also think they based it on the new TV show which had the cultish robes instead of the ones in the original. Still would have preferred the original design
---
I never rlly cared about downvotes or karma.. but yeah, this sub is something else
---
Personally I'd prefer BP. Then the dev's can say they're killing two birds with one stone. Reduce disconnects and cut down on the grind.
---
It could be anything though. They could rotate rewards weekly if it matters.
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one
---
This is great! Even as an old survivor i feel this is important
---
I can get behind a secondary objective, but I think they need to do something about Ruin being so necessary, by which i mean introduce new generator-based perks. I try my best to not run Ruin but that usually means taking up 2-3 perk slots between Thanatophobia, Overcharge, etc. to make up for it. We need some equally strong perks that challenge survivors in different ways.
---
I like that idea
---
Yea, maybe they will change it with the feedback everyone's giving, since it's not out yet they still have time to change things up before release.
---
Yeah I feel like people need to be nicer to each other because all the people that send me hatemail are actually nice but just frustrated with the game. If people were nicer I feel toxicity and disconnecting would be pretty rare but sadly this community just like having yelling matches and wouldn't need incentives to stop disconnects.
---
Old but gold
---
True true. I usually just don't DC nowadays just to get BP. Since now DCing just gives you 0 BP. Rather get however little BP I got from farming hooks and stuff in front of a facecamper than get nothing.
---
Kinda like the new perk with the plague I could get behind that ..hopefully ghostface has a perk that will have something to do with gens
---
Does everyone else find LOTS of keys while using plunderer's?
---
I expected to get purple med-kits and toolboxes, but I currently have 9 skeleton keys and 2 purple ones and those are the ones I didn't get to use
---
Also rainbow maps
---
I'd recommend Leatherface and Spirit
---
You are complaining about totems being too easy to find while 80% of this sub complains about NOED being "impossible" to counter. 
---
I am konfusion.
---
There isnt an easy fix for this, 5 totems on each map some are going to be near a survivor and some are not going to have a god spawn, no matter where they are put survivors will eventually learn the spawn points. Totems really need to be made more into a secondary objective, right now they are just a timewaste and completley optional. I feel each totem (dull/active) should give the survivors a small debuff, once the survivors cleanse them they remove this debuff and when all are cleansed they get buffed.
---
Ruin is so easy for survivor now because they see it literally every single game. Id say the game has reached a point where they need to implement baseline ruin of some degree in exchange for survivors getting built in self care or something
---
I used to think noed was OP but now I get it
---
That's what confuses me, are you on ps4? I'm in green ranks too, I've seen people actually say they find survivor games fast on ps4, so I dont get what the cause is to make it so random lol
---
Damn I got the wrong system to play on then lol
---
Stop taking crazy pills, this game is a killers game, this game is catered to overpowered camping killers with overpowered aura reading perks. It punishes survivors when a match is too short, the killer camps, other survivors lead the killer to you, when the killer tunnels, killers can run BBQ, NOED, RUIN, MORI and they still whine like little two year olds that survivors have it easy. What a load of bull, the killer should not be able to close the hatch full stop. Developers just keep making it harder and harder for survivors and easier for whining killers. Eventually killers won‚Äôt have any survivors to kill and then let‚Äôs see what they will whine about.
---
@BM-1988
---
Imagine downvoting this guy
---
I don't mind it. People didn't stop teabagging when we asked them to just leave. maybe in 3 years they will make it so you can ask the entity to take you early when you're the last person, downed, and there are no doors open. until then, have fun
---
I'm personally ok with the new design I feel like they'll add the robes as a stand alone chest piece because they'd make alot of cash from it
---
There's crows living in a tree close to my house
---
At this point I feel like other killers just do a lot of the same things that doctor does but better. For starters his shock range should be longer by default. The range addons shouldn't increase the charge time either. It's a weird penalty for an already low tier killer. The clones could be more useful. Like maybe they walk around and get his terror radius and red stain for a few seconds. The illusory pallets are good, but I'd rather see his exhaustion addons removed. They don't really belong in the game; well none of the exhaustion addons belong in the game anymore since you can't use exhaustion perks multiple times in the same chase anymore. Instead, I wouldn't mind an addon that causes a short hindered, or maybe even a tier 3 madness causes broken status but madness builds up slower type of addon. It honestly rarely feels worth it to even shock people at all mid chase without his best possible addons equipped.
---
Just take the red strips from the back and front away and then you are good to go
---
"safe pallet" means the pallet is unmindgameable. I've had a setup as survivor with 8 safe pallets in a streak, 2 of which were in the surveillance room which meant that after looping those 8, you could drop down for 2 more god pallets at the basement.
---
Good luck mindgaming the main window is crotus vs a survivor that doesnt have brain damage IRL.
---
if you try it you won't love it any longer
---
T. the claudette at the corner of the map self-caring every time they get frenzied.
---
I didn't think we could get worse than corn but then they introduced bamboo.
---
Your user tag checks out
---
The survivor who is being chased let's say for x amount of time should be rewarded points for every objective being completed. It's such BS that you don't receive anything an depip because the killer won't give up the chase.
---
that's honestly my favourite thing to do. i lose the chase and listen
---
No, but it has way fucking better lobby times! I cant even eat a snack before I get a game in OV
---
Could be due to the system they made where the game makes a group of 4 surviors before finding a killer
---
how would you know ? may be she liked to dance see how happy she looks :P
---
Nice RPD uniforms there, gents
---
I think I've said something like this but for the sake of conversation, I want at least the other survivor's faces. Imagine,  NeaFace, AceFace, FengFace, DavidFace, KateFace, AdamFace, JeffFace. Hell! If they could, imagine if they could get something like LaurieFace, QuentinFace, TappFace, AshFace.
---
Def doesn‚Äôt say anything about that in her lore but I mean maybe
---
Thank you üòä Honestly I was really anxious about it, which was why it took me so long to build up the courage to actually do it until now after hearing all the woes of being Killer and dealing with toxicity. But so far I've only encountered one match that was intolerable where the survivors weren't even attempting to do gens, all four were just swarming me and trying to bait. Wasn't as upsetting as I thought it'd be; I just kind of laughed at it and found a new lobby to play properly. It's easy when I tell myself it's just a game!
---
2. "If you dont play the nurse, dont chase......just be the toy for suvivors"
---
Didn't a fog whisperer say there wasn't going to be a survivor Because they got flown out a while ago and told what was going to happen and what was going to be released?
---
What happened after you hopped in? Leatherface could've closed the hatch afterwards and started the endgame right away.
---
Uwe
---
I‚Äôm going for that ‚Äúcutting out‚Äù achievement, though I never get slugged unless I use my usual build haha
---
Yeah movement is more sluggish on survivor but somewhat better for killer
---
Ok so it‚Äôs not just me üòë
---
&gt; first time playing
---
And it's even better when it's a famous streamer
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I kind of disagree with 3. Don't make it a habit. A good killer knows when and when not to swing through a pallet. The chance of hitting someone through a pallet isn't random. Sooner or later you'll learn at which distance you can hit them and when you can't. Avoiding the stun to either walk around a weak pallet or just to break it will add up precious seconds and get you back in the chase faster.
---
Prayer beads+thrill/ruin 100% guarantee DC‚Äôs will happen 
---
The totems are just meant to buy time btw, if you‚Äôre guarding them 100% that‚Äôs 100% not doing any killing
---
While it is indeed "not my job" to balance the game around my own play style, and I do not intend to give up voice chat during matches - I do not want my enjoyment to come at the expense of my opponent. Killers in this thread have brought up some legitimate grievances which I have not previously considered and which I will implement in future games (e.g. not sharing information about the hex totem locations). At the end of the day, we're all here to have fun : )
---
SWF has a tendency to play heavily altruistic, so after hooking someone, take a look around the area, you might find another one hiding nearby. 
---
If you chase a survivor and they run right by a hex totem, assume the rest of the team now also knows where that totem is. Either accept the fact you're about to lose it, or if you can't quickly catch the survivor you're chasing, double back and see if one of their teammates is on it.
---
If you hate broken SWFs, you'll either have to play a high tier killer with good addons (Nurse/Spirit/Billy/Huntress) or play optimally (tunneling, proxy camping, no mercy). Survivors might bitch, but they're hypocrites, because you know damn well they will do anything in their power to escape, no matter how scummy it is, so do likewise.
---
Then you'd have one single killer whose name's in English, while the rest are translated though. That's shoddy. 
---
Here's a better one. "Der Schemen". Gets across what "shape" really wants to express, doesn't sound goofy like Die Form and doesn't feel weirdly passive and inaggressive like der Wandler.
---
The time spent healing outweighs the time they spend injuring you regardless.
---
Perks that help you track or reveal survivors are very useful on Bubba. You start with BBQ &amp; Chili which is widely considered one of the most useful killer perks in the game.
---
Since you don't have any of the other killer's teachable perks you'll be limited to Bitter Murmur and Whispers for additional tracking but you may find that BBQ &amp; Chili alone is adequate.
---
I'd run BBQ &amp; Chili, Sloppy Butcher, and Iron Grasp. Final perk is up to you.
---
Consider leveling to 35 to unlock BBQ &amp; Chili for your other killers, level some other killers for their teachable perks, and then revisit Bubba.
---
The devs are steadily improving totem spots every patch. These past couple major patches I've been noticing more clever hiding spots totems are spawning in. It IS getting better, but we just have to be patient.
---
wait longer
---
he probably just assumed that every release consists of a map, Survivor and killer
---
Currently 2k hours in, and me and my friend got bored simply because of the bugs. They need to fix this game before I go back to playing 10 hours a day. It's unbearable. Also 90% of the playerbase is trash and every game feels like a chore, so there's that too.
---
Yes. However, although unlikely, perhaps the fog whisperers are intentionally spreading fake news to pleasantly surprise us when it hits.
---
And RSB could be a proof of that. Either;
---
- He messed up by assuming a new map and survivor and killer
---
- He messed up by spilling the beans.
---
We should prepare for a standalone release but we can't say for sure. That's what makes it fun.
---
I saw that happening in a match yesterday, I was against an irisdescent head huntress so OBVIOUSLY 2 crybabies disconnected in the first minute of the match
---
But one of then did when he got hooked, wich appears to be the same thing that's happening here, so that's probably it
---
That's not a meme build, that's meta.
---
Thing is, from what i've seen so far, the charms look like some stupid cosmetic key chains you see in FPS games, guess BHVR needs some more revenue ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
They look worse out of it.
---
This warms my hart. I FEEL SO MUCH NOW!
---
Huntress is dogshit on Gideon too.
---
I think RSB probably messed up and assumed all dlc gets a survivor map and killer but I'm hoping I'm wrong to be honest as a new survivor and map would be pretty awesome. I doubt the fog whisperers spreading misinformation though as what's the point rather then just be blunt and to the point.
---
You clearly don't know  shirtless myers
---
anyone else annoyed that the plague's corrupt vile doesn't work when survivors are exposed. Like it doesn't insta down
---
lol....every pallet is a free Hit and the long corridors make hitting hatchets very easy. maybe you just need practise
---
I kind of hate this post. Because I am a Pig main. But it is still good. so upvoted...
---
I agree in the add a secondary objective thing
---
But make gens take longer?
---
No thanks, being stuck for almost a minute and a half without moving having only to look around and press space from time to time is already the most boring thing about playing survivor
---
And when the killer has thanatophobia and is a Legion, that sure is the shittiest scenario
---
It would be nice if totems where protected by the entity for a period of time when the match starts, like the corrupted intervention perk from the PLAG, so even if you spawned right next to it, you would still need to wait to get rid of it
---
I would like to add something. I was oooking through the files and found 3 new perk names i hadnt seen before that sounded VERY much like survivor perks , and even more like one that could pair with ghostface. Also there is the post that said there would be a survivor and map.
---
Personally I think that's the biggest problem with Amanda. She only gets bloodpoints for ambush attacks which aren't really worth going for when you can just uncrouch and go for a normal swing
---
Trained is going to be the best perk in the entire game. Exhaustion goes away when you are hooked no matter the time left, so this will be the focal point of every build
---
Hey OP, am a survivor main, and I think there are 3 reasons that I personally DC
---
1) Bad lag/servers
---
2) Extremely bad team/toxic team. Example was yesterday, I started doing a gen in God house, Jake fast vaults window, and quickly fails 2 skill checks. Goes down into basement for item, comes back and helps me with gen. Killer comes, he runs early to god pallet, and then I run towards door as well to run from killer. He blocks me in, and then proceeds to waste God pallet. I quit. Just a note, I don't hate bad teammates, it's just frustrating and I still try to play games regardless. 
---
3) Excessive amount of games against the Doc. Personally, I hate the doc, did 3 in a row yesterday against him, and the fourth time I had to quit, just couldn't handle it anymore lol
---
With that said, I got a super low quit rate, so when I do quit it's usually a solid reasoning behind it :)
---
A image have no polygons. This is not even a low resolution noed. It is a blocky noed.
---
Are you on ps4 by any chance? I notice when I play on ps4, this happens alot but on PC, every thing works fine like 90% of the time
---
i like it
---
That salty SWF in the background though :D
---

*Hello Zep intensifies*

*secret apprentice revealed*
---

---
People still DC against Legion and it can still get a fair amount of kills per game, even with the 4 second stun Legion is so fucking fast now it can get you in no time...
---
finally she gets new cosmetics
---
[**This can be captured here**](https://teesfit.com/limited12-1)
---
i think she looks cute in that
---
The original Nea one looks fine. The edits make her look like a man, and thats just wrong..
---
lmaooo
---
There arent alot of perks that slow the game down,at red ranks my ruin is gone within a minute. Sloppy and Thano at full stacks is a weaker but consistent way to slow the game down. 
---
Also alot of Players dont know how strong Thano is and just see that everything is slower and so they heal,which is a huge waste of time against legion
---
Tip 6: 
---
The best thing to do is to hang around a survivor once you hooked them! They love to have your face right up to their face!
---
I stopped taking your side when you said BHVR was smart.
---
Yes!  There are charms on the Ghostface hook :)  Hopefully all other killers will get them too.
---
I'm on PC, and it happens on all lobbies regardless of ping, and it ain't my specs either because I'm running a 1050 and even setting it to low doesn't change anything.
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night :,)
---
Idk but she kinda looks scary, she has long everything
---
Mmmm. Long haired leatherface. :3
---
This is an acceptable response to me as long as you are using 1 yellow perk and no items offerings as killer. 
---
Otherwise, sure buddy.
---
My flip phone had a camera on it circa 2005-2006
---
everynight
---
But Insta Freddy has 110% movement speed, so you can loop him like a Huntress without hatchets.
---
My reaction to this was:
---
............................BRILLI-
---
When I'm actually just going for a ritual I'm trying to show it
---
like for example playing huntress, spamming hatchets and leaving to the locker whenever I run out
---
Would be dope if there was a full line of these cosmetics for everyone: Claudette in SWAT armor, Meg in a firefighter uniform, Dwight with a gas mask etc.
---
It makes me laugh that you think they purposely got the other person caught. You can't see where anyone is without a map. They didn't even know they were in that wardrobe, so you're saying the person that saved the other one twice, managed to get off the hook solo. ran from the killer while the teammate was scheming to dip, and accidentally ran into the said player. You're saying they're the saltiest thing on the game? You're dramatic.
---
Bruh Jane thicc af

Platform: Xbox One X. Piggy never stays crouched anymore. She instantly stands up again after crouching. But the ambush attack prompt remains on screen.
---
Not gonna lie, as soon as I see someone get carried and I'm far away, I definitely hide in a locker for a good 5, 10 seconds. You ain't gonna use bbq on me boi
---
This. Stuff like this is why I subscribe to a game channel.
---
Thats how avarage woman looks without makeup
---
I recommend playing top tier killers with good add ons against SWF.
---
I would often play against them as the struggle to find games, but after so much bm, and several hate messages at once, I stopped doing them the favor. Now I completely avoid teams of 4, and often will avoid teams of 3.
---
It was suppose to stop killers from dodging lobbies when 4 survivors joined all at once.
---
From my expereince it never really helped
---
I love her scarred hands
---
I know lol. I‚Äôm talking about who he stole it from! Lisapeachy lol
---
Could I suggest a video to you which is very helpful for newish players?
---
I won‚Äôt lie, I love these dailies lol

In the locker scene he talks about Locker Camping (it's towards the end when she's running through the meat packing plant).
---
Funny thing is, using a flashlight against a killer who knows the game is kinda useless too. It's really easy to avoid being blinded once you know how to. So the flashlight's purpose is either to screw Hag or to use your extreme flashlights skill against fairly inexperienced killers.
---
Basically, flashlights were nerfed hard without any comeback.
---
Christ the filter does a good job

Like they wanted to hide before

Ia ctually do like surveillance mostly because that extra 8 meter hearing but thats just me
---
Sigh... we got a fucking puppet in the game, but still no bunny feng..
---
True just wanted to put my idea out there as it is annoying when you can never seem to get a perk up a level
---
&gt;. If everyone maxes everything out then there really isn‚Äôt anything to work towards at the moment. They want to make it as grindy
---
You would have cosmetics to grind for, which already have an exorbitant grind in order to get - and especially with the speed they're pumping them out you will not run out of things to do.  
---
For a new player the amount of grinding just to get a basic build going is insane. Some kind of 'catch up' mechanic is long overdue in this game.
---
Almost every LoL artist ported themselves over to Overwatch when it became much more lucrative to do so.
---
I lost my Freddy Adept because someone DCd on the ground so his also downed SWF (I knew he's on the hatch so I came for him first) could escape
---
You're not hooking me - Tenacity, unbreakable, flip-flop, boil over
---
Had to do my job for me.
---
Conditions - 2 survivors killed - if 1 remaining survivor DC‚Äôs (not killed) - add 30 to 60 seconds to hatch timer
---
Would completely destroy the entire DC for hatch meta, however, people would complain relentlessly so I‚Äôm telling you right now it will never ever happen lol.
---
The only hope we have is for BHVR to add a legitimate penalty for those who DC and not this half assed system they have going for them right now where 1/2 the survivor pop can DC from a game with absolutely no draw backs.
---
I changed Boil Over to Adrenaline, because Boil Over doesn't do much
---
Yep could be another reason why they didn't because you wouldn't be able to see the blood on it because it's so dark
---
People who DC don't care whatever happens after they DC, revealing the hatch to the killer or it having a timer wont prevent anyone from DCing
---
Stakeout, urban evasion, distraction (?is it called that? The pebble perk by Francis) and a 4th, perhaps spine chill
---
I call it the hunter's hunter. Stick around the killer to build tokens for stakeout and distraction, rock the skill checks and drive the killer absolutely mad because he can't find you.
---
Spine hill, UE and distraction make it nearly impossible for the killer to get the drop on you, and if they do break your gennie, the stake out tokens help you get it back up super fast.
---
I'm not gonna claim it's the best build ever, but I just enjoy it so much, especially to see the killer going for the distractions you throw. Bonus tip, throw your distraction at a generator to make the killer think you've messed that one up, like killer cat nip, hilarious to see them looking for you
---
Like I said, a lot of the game is rng. With the amount of add ons, offerings and perks in the game, there's a near limitless number of combinations. If you bring urban evasion every game then you'll have an advantage in the chance you're against a hag. Perks are not an excuse and can't be balanced when it depends on the combination. I play mainly solo survivor and have no problem escaping with randoms without communication. If each survivor repairs 1 generator and the killer can only be in one place at a time, then it's a given that most survivors will escape. However, if every survivor decides to go for the same save etc then that is what causes the team to lose. If the majority of your escapes as a survivor rely on the hatch then you're not very good. And to me, that's the problem. The only people complaining about EGC are those who could not escape hardly any other way. Just my opinion, but as someone who plays both sides equally, I feel I have an unbiased opinion.
---
Fun builds : 
---
Gen jockey build : Prove Thyself, Stake Out, Resilience, Adrenaline + a yellow Toolbox with add-ons for more charges.
---
Looping build : Mettle of Man, Balance Landing, Adrenaline, Hope + an offering for Haddonfield/Springwood/Gideon Meat Plant/Red Forest/Crotus Prenn Asylum/Ormond.
---
Healing build : Solidarity, Autodidact, Spine Chill, Empathy.
---
That's dark
---
You know, I heard a shortened version of this noise the other day and made a post about it. Someone said it was just the hook noises, but I *think* this is a Ghostface noise?
---
I... also *think* when I heard the noise the person's body was finally "accepted" by the Entity, like it seems to have been with the Adam here. Only difference is mine played for like 1-2 seconds. Still spooked the shit out of me and made me hella anxious, but my friend I was playing with at the time didn't hear it.
---
No Mither, Botany Knowledge, We'll Make It and Empathy.
---
"Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself"
---
That &gt;!username!&lt; tho
---
Shadowborn increases FOV by 8/12/15 degrees  
---
Monitor and Abuse  increases FOV by 3/5/10 degrees  
---
I don't know what the default FOVs are.
---
Actually they do care because they do it so their friend gets hatch
---
Am i wrong tho
---
Love this idea, honestly it would even be good to have like a 10s timer to counter the people who camp hatch.
---
Been hearing 65 and 70 degrees for killers.
---
It's such a shifty way to play and BHVR just does nothing about it.
---
This should be fixed by adding proper DC penalties in general (not just for 2nd-to-last survivor).
---
John doesn't have the rights to Michael though. If he did I doubt we'd have gotten anything beyond Halloween III.
---
I'm almost certain that's fake, especially since the entire map is referred to as one house. I've seen a few people claim they saw Sidney's name pop up on the next tab of their character bio section, so you never know.
---
Yeah lol whenever I see that I back out immediately
---
The Ghostface costume from season 3 is exactly the same as the original
---
ENTITY DISPLEASED... YOU KILLED THEM ALL TOO FAST...
---
Lantern owns Scream right now.
---
The killer was likely AFK. If all 4 gens popped at about the same time, its likely that all 4 of you were working gens the whole time, which means the Nurse didn't find anyone or even scare one of them off gen almost a minute and a half.
---
I hope they rework daily s
---
To be fair, they said "chapter release content". That wording seems a bit strange to me, but maybe that's how they've always done it.
---
Y'all heard of Slayer? Well check this shit out, we made a new skill. It's exactly like Slayer, except it's against *other people*!
---
I mean it's not false.
---
And Buttocks
---
This is the thing Killer dreams are made of, so beautiful.
---
Yeah I like the idea of the clone doctors moving around and the shock range being longer
---
Thank you friend, here, have a tiny useless orange arrow that signals success
---
Just happened to me yesterday because I dared to use lockers to counter BBQ. People will never cease to amaze me for  their stupidity.
---
As I mentioned before; there‚Äôs just no incentive to not DC.
---
Lol that guy chose the wrong time to teabag
---
Thanks heaps
---
So the beginning of Halo 4, but with skill checks. 
---
How about no?
---
Imagine being this sweaty for a 4k
---
This totally gives me a Kabal and Stryker vibe from MK9
---
I really thought it was a cosplay for a few sec
---
That's actually impressive
---
It's still better not to heal, the time spent healing is way longer than the time it takes for him to injure you with FF.
---
It doesn't matter that FF is a bit slower now. The duration is longer, he's still way faster than you during it &amp; he won't be using it very far away from you anyway so the speed nerf doesn't matter.
---
Honestly it doesn't make that much of a difference anymore. If you don't heal you're vulnerable, sure, but if you heal it's likely you will be stabbed again and you just wasted time, so it's more like with other killers, you must know when it's time to heal and when it's time to repair gens.
---
"How bad is it, Doctor?"

"I'm sorry, but it's worse than we anticipated: he has base movement speed and deep wounds are not viable."

"What are you saying?"

"I'm sorry, but your child may never reach rank 1 again.  But don't worry, as a Doctor, I can tell you that your child can still live a long and fulfilling life at low ranks and still do a pretty good job and get a respectable amount of bloodpoints.  But, while they're young, have you thought about asking them if maybe they'd be interested in a more prestigious occupation, like a Nurse or a Hillbilly?"
---
Nah, Legion mains mean well - they weren't born with the derp, they just got stuck with it.  They're not Franks, they're Susies
---
This looks awesome! Did you make this OP?
---
Yes, please! Self-care against my sloppy butcher Legion.
---
Yes. At the expense of the killer. The killer better not bring in a mori and ultra rates either.
---
Spam space dont wait for the skillcheck to go around

i‚Äôve met some really great people that i would‚Äôve never found if i weren‚Äôt playing, so i‚Äôm really happy about that :)

Scratched mirror Myers would like a word
---
please do Killer-specific guides!
---
plagye is pissing me off and i want that damn Adept! lol

Get off your high horse, I do play both so don‚Äôt make assumptions. The fact that you think survivors have more power so how delusional you are.
---
Looks like she's or 15 or a twink
---
I never realized how much I wanted to run from/fight Leatherface as Never Campell before now.
---
the default fov is 87

Just a bunch of Chicken Nugget obsessed methheads /s
---
&gt; **Drink if killer has Hex Ruin.**
---
Have fun!
---
If the Freddy plays like a traditional chase killer he deserves to be looped
---
wow this game looks good in 4K
---
I love blody blocking people. :)
---
Only if we get Busta Rhymes as a survivor. Nobody else gets to do that.
---
I nearly spit out my breakfast from laughing so hard
---
As has been explained they might not have the license rights to use the original ropes
---
87 seems like a weird number for killers. I don't doubt you, but it's just an odd number.
---
*Entity Displeased*
---
"Don't make me come down there you punk!"
---
True
---
He was great back in the day. Now he's losing his luster. Not so much a failed design but he is definitely getting power crept.
---
Entity forbid it. That's when the killer isnt playing fair, so time to DC
---
You seriously think the Ghostface leak wasn't on purpose? Besides, BHVR just gave us Ash, Ghostface, fixed 3-mans, hatch standoffs, Legion, DS etc. Of course this game still has problem but cut them a little slack
---
Hitboxes are the way they are because peer-to-peer
---
Lmao. Truth
---
how about the android?
---
they could dress like a demonic form of the cybermen from doctor who
---
Wow this is rly well made! And the blurbs from the killers are a cute touch. Nice!! üëç
---
Yeah, Red Paint Brush is a viable add-on just on Lery's.
---
Well I have probably triple the hours here than I do overwatch
---
Love it
---
thank you lots! :D
---
thanks to everyone who replied, update I am getting a custom built gaming PC can't wait to play dbd on it. The only thing is ill have to start from scratch lol On xbox I am devotion 7 anyway that will be fun a challenge for me :).
---
So cute!
---
Yep, I agree. Trial and error.
---
Great job is say they're better than the originals, give yourself more credit you deserve it!
---
2 of them i have no idea wtf they are doing, at least kate was saving dwight.
---
That doesn't make sense as a response to what I said which is why I said what..
---
Or just do what every other competitive game does, if you disconnect you get a 5 minute wait timer that increases exponentially the more times you DC and it resets at rank reset.
---
Ok this is beyond adorable, I love it. c:
---
Smoking some bud.
---
thx!! &lt;3
---
I don‚Äôt mind swf groups but 9/10 times they act like toxic cunts just for the fact that they can
---
Killers potentially have 2 gates and the hatch to look around to find the last survivor/s. If they guess wrong the first time it gives the survivor a chance to escape (if they're far enough apart). If they go looking for the hatch then the survivor could find it first, or they could run for a gate and leave. It's fine.
---
Pretty sure he got them back after Rob Zombie's movies
---
Co-op King: 
---
1. Bond to find your teammates 
---
2. Prove Thyself to make co-op go faster 
---
3. Spine chill to tell your team the killer is looking.
---
4. Lightweight to move across the map freely without worrying about your scratch marks staying too long
---
remove terror radius music and only have the heartbeat.
---
I'm so excited for him
---
His gameplay looks good on paper.
---
That is a wet dream and a half.
---
Stop it! Hes already dead.
---
Nice graphic, one question though...someone help me out here. The text for enduring says that it reduces your stun time 75%, but then also says it reduces it from 2.1 to 1.2 seconds, which is just shy of 50%.
---
The entity had to use 100% of its power to contain shaggy
---
This happens with Billy except it makes you look up
---
Damn, Tapp and Piggy look so good
---
[Hello, here is the coloured version of the picture. :)](https://i.imgur.com/SFkLDKt.jpg)

It‚Äôs only a game. I had a similar problem, and I changed my username to mock it.
---
Maybe you just need to find people that don‚Äôt take the game that seriously
---
&gt;entity displeased 
---
Nice system
---
Oh you're playing Freddy that might have sth to do with it? I'm generally just confused at this point why it's happening to you and not me
---
I said a little slack. Like I said, of course this game still has problems, but acting like the devs don't care or not listening to feedback is just straight up wrong
---
Holy fuck you spent $55 on this...
---
runescape
---
I hope it's Myer's dick
---
They understand I bought it as a silly novelty
---
Because....oink?
---
Ninja Bing Bong boy and Scratched Mirror Myers will always be scary af to me. 
---
I guess the element of surprise makes it scary. The tension of not knowing who's the killer until you come face to face in a split second, forcing you to constantly check your surroundings and listen and crouch.
---
$55 for a joke is a little rough. Then again people have spent hundreds on cosmetics.
---
I had a match where I siloed 3 gens and helped with both the other 2. Had a streamer‚Äôs game in the background so I could hear them and what they were doing. The 2 others were hooked and he was sneaking up to a hook for a save (could see him with Bond) so I went and opened the nearest exit gate. Then he get gets caught and instant downed and says ‚ÄúOh good the other survivor isn‚Äôt doing anything‚Äù (as I have the gate at 90%).  Finished opening the gate, I hooked all 3 of them but got downed, and they all immediately left through the gate and the streamer said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what they deserve for not helping.‚Äù And people wonder why everyone trashes on players with TTV in their name...
---
Game is still fun with or without friends. leaked ghostface builds hype and keeps the players that have lives excited. While they do 'fuck up' every month they still communicate with their players via live streams which is 100x better than mega companies like *cough* square enix. Seriously, fuck you square enix... You dropped your last hype bomb for ff7 remake like 4 years ago and now you show us basically the same trailer to string us along to e3 2019? BHVR is amazing compared to shit companies like that.
---
But they didn‚Äôt listen to the pig or legion changes when they first came out on PTB though...they may listen but it‚Äôs only after the echo chamber gets louder.
---
We all should be holding devs to a higher standard instead of looking for a convenience to excuse crappy gameplay.
---
Out of all the games at the top of my head that are multiplayer I‚Äôve never seen as many concurrent issues happening back to back overtime. 
---
Whoever helped produce the game and encouraged Cote to release the game with 360/ps3 gameplay should be slapped, this game is literally left 4 dead graphics and UI, do you know how ancient that shit is?!
---
Probably hoping blood warden wore off at the last second, which it didn‚Äôt
---
Nea...Duhh
---
Not every tap of the LCTRL button is filled with all of someone's malice towards  the killer. Bloodwarden was up, and they knew it.
---
TLDR.
---
Nea's long lost brother
---
I only ever get killer rituals but usually I play survivor. I hate it
---
Yea makes sense it wouldn't be happy that it had to do the killers job for them.
---
Shouts out Clementine.
---
YES! All the pink, ALL OF IT!!
---
Facecamping should not be allowed but it's not the point here, the killer sandbag the stairs and survivors cannot play. There is no gameplay, no strats, etc. It's definitively dumb, devs must change that
---
They were good enough to make the killer lose a pip by preventing the killer from doing their job the entire match, meanwhile the one guy the killer managed to even down he had slugged for almost the full 3 minutes and was camping the slug to run the timer down before hooking him to activate blood warden. The only one with BM in this situation was the killer tbh. The others were trying to save Dwight. If the killer is bad there's really no reason to not try and save someone, even at the end game.
---
What the fuck is this creation of a human
---
Baba Yaga is traditionally seen as an old woman. She lives in a hut in the woods that has giant chicken legs and can walk (IIRC). 
---
It does remind me of the outfit, which I think is in the 2nd Tombraider games (the modern ones) that you can collect in the witch-themed expansion I think you're referring to.
---
It is, but it was posted by the same guy more than 2 years ago, so it's fine
---
have you tried not getting hooked?
---
I was looking at 'Remember Me' and it seems like they nerfed it. Is it still worth taking? Blood warden hes been having fun with when those survivors teabag at the gate and he just so happens to have it proc the hilarity ensues. I've heard NOED works well with endgame builds but I know it's so crappy to face so I try and steer away from that, but it seems almost necessary with the fact he cant just straight smack you off the bat. Is knock out to just stall for time since you can see them anyway and make survivors waste time?
---
D'aww c:
---
They never learn
---
Also thanks for replying in a helpful manner! I have avoided posting in here because of the toxicity but today i figured screw it. I wanna be a poster not a lurker!
---
Having a totem between two barrels two feet from a generator is a bad spawn, but then there's the spawn in the middle of an open field on the asylum maps where they don't even try to pretend like it's hidden from anything &amp; imo, that spot needs to be fixed. No totem should be able to spawn that much in the open.
---
thanks a lot for the builds and advice. i really needed some help, thanks again!
---
Well, if we learnt something from Myers... Remove their terror radius
---
Yeah we shouldn't have cosmetics at all right? They add nothing, whats the point.
---
Try changing M&amp;A for BBQ and use Dead Rabbit  
---
The double bloodpoints effect is worth it imo.
---
Blood warden is a crutch perk now?
---
BHVR needs more feminine energy to deal with these egregious makeup decisions.
---
Depending on what you have. Sloppy Butcher is actually pretty good on him, but the rest not as much. NOED is a little redundant on Myers as his ability already allows him to insta-down. Thrill of the Hunt is only going to be good for making a couple extra BP as you're not running any other Hexes (although that's not *the worst* on Myers since his chase time tends to be so much shorter). Whispers is also usually not needed on Myers since his terror radius is so much smaller (unless he's T3). Since people don't hear you coming till you're much closer, you can find survivors pretty consistently just patrolling gens (as long as you stay out of sight so they can't see you coming).
---
Wait, low rank? I am rank 3. And my friends are at work.
---
Friends are at work.
---
A Disconnect Four is better than a 4K.
---
Your art's really good!  
---
Looks amazing
---
tysm!!
---
The other day a SWF called me toxic and a crutch perk for using STBFL so at this point I really don‚Äôt know
---
The negativity probably comes from the fact that there is a insane BP grind for all the perks you want let alone leveling up all survivors/killers with the perks you want and that grind becomes mentally degrading since launch when DC‚Äôs haven‚Äôt been resolved after X amount of years ( which is insane that everything else is hotfixed or patched before this).
---
To add further insult to injury DC‚Äôs have the potential to de pip the player and further fucks up survivors chances of BP grinding ( survivor DC‚Äôs? There goes survivor 1.5k hook points and killer hook points) 
---
I keep seeing elitists defend this garbage when the reality is a video game is ENTERTAINMENT... NOT a 2nd job.
---
It is just degrading having to try hard every match to autolock the 30k  JUST to only get 4-5 items in the bloodweb with no guarantee of the perks or items you want.
---
My best tips for finding hatch are:
---
- Keep in mind it will never spawn on the second floor of anything (so you don't have to go upstairs on Haddonfield, Badham, The Game, Red Forest, etc)
---
- Check landmarks first, if applicable. Shack is a frequent spawn, the base of the stairs of the big building on swamp, the little bedroom nook in the school basement (NOT killer basement) on Badham, middle of the street on Haddonfield/Badham, the big middle room on Lery's. These aren't guaranteed by any stretch, but they seem to be quite common.
---
Can you equip Deliverance, at all?
---
Stuff like this is why Kindred should be in-built
---
No, not M&amp;A! Swap Whispers or Enduring before you get rid of M&amp;A, as it literally cuts his T2 radius in half.
---
*Black Knights your sith ass*
---
Considering there's only 3 chests per game and that one is always in the basement it would require you to be playing against survivors with negative IQ to get someone to fall for it
---
Specially if they are using plunderer's
---
A perk that can trap chests would be cool tho
---
What STBFL?
---
Save the best for last, the Myers perk
---
That's actually very common, always expect NoED and Ruin on Michael
---
That's when you hold shift and W while looking in one direction
---
Y'know, the best thing to do against Freddy
---
I HATE YOU!
---
FUCK I'M BURNING!
---
Save the Best for Last
---
I noticed that as well, I was curious why I was not getting many bloodpoints for games when I would do 2+ gens. I thought maybe it was a visual bug. I would get the partial points if I stopped working on the gen or missing a ruin skill check, but once it was complete, nothing. Suprised no one else has said anything
---
forgive me milord i'll never do it again, im just a boy of very little brain with my crutch perks carrying me to the red ranks
---
Same happened to me. Made a post with no response. In my case everyone else had escaped and the killer DCs while I'm in his shoulder.  No BP for me. Cancelled Match it said.
---
/u/peanits_bhvr
---
lmao
---
At first I thought "yup, looks about right" until I saw you were in *pre-game* chat. Did that guy recognize you from a previous game?
---
Yup, doubt the devs care tho about ps4
---
This was in a kill your friends and i just pick random perks.
---
Pretty sure that's just a party outfit. I mean she's wearing sneakers.
---
Oh god didn't exept so much upvote for johny rapid, how gay is this sub ?   
---
We need Colby Keller skin for david then.
---
No but the end game collapse kills are supposed to count as normal sacrifices. It‚Äôs bugged
---
Oh, good point. I've been running without addons for a long time trying to get some other killers farmed up. I usually just bring the cheap moonwalk addons (necklace and earings).
---
Ohh okay I haven‚Äôt played in a while so I don‚Äôt remember a lot of the perks.
---
Okay thanks.
---
That or Claudette moaning like a pronstar
---
The invisible build :
---
Distortion
---
Iron will
---
Quick and quiet
---
Urban evasion
---
You can also use dance with me, lightweight or calm spirit
---
Had this happen with a group i played with the other day. Happened as one of our teammates got sac'd and DC'd on hook (he had an emergency in his home) and we were only one gen in. None of us could hear skill checks or billy's chainsaw. It was awful. Good to know that it wasn't him pullong shenanigans, but man that was bad. Even heard it when i left menu to go into spectator mode after dying.
---
I mean straight afterwards he just left so idk, and he was a p3 claud lol
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a pretty fun perk, let‚Äôs you hit successively faster so it‚Äôs good on killers like Myers or Clown
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people call it a crutch perk tho
---
Now THAT'S a vault grab animation! I want that to come back now.
---
Ok that's actually kinda creepy
---
Looks like Neil Patrick Harris
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn
---
Entity new crutch /s
---
P3 Freddy main here, playing at high ranks. When it comes to Fred, you have you use builds that cover your biggest weaknesses and use your strongest addons most of the time. His strongest addons aren't just dream reducers. Hell, none of his top 3 addons (imo) reduce the dream transition. Your best addons are **Class Photo** (the best one by far), **Pill Bottle** (for mindgaming around pallets while putting a survivor to sleep), and **Green Dress** (to ensure they don't wake up while sleeping other Survivors). Also, don't really try **Red Paint Brush** outside of maps like The Game or Lery's. That reduction in movement speed it gives stings. Good perks to run on any build would be **Monitor and Abuse** (to keep your terror radius small, allowing you to sneak up on sleeping Survivors) and **Barbeque and Chili** (so you can see what Survivors to put to sleep after hooking them and getting more BP). Other generally good perks to use are **Bamboozle, Spirit Fury,** and **Enduring** (due to his struggle with looping). **Save the Best for Last** (due to being an M1 killer without a power to help in the chase). **Blood Warden** and **No One Escapes Death** are good for him too, due to being one of the strongest endgame Killers. And **Ruin** is always good to run on any Killer, as long as you're okay with your totem being destroyed pretty soon after a game starts and relying on *that one time* the Ruin didn't get destroyed. (Although personally I never bother with Ruin on Freddy, I hate my totem getting destroyed quickly.)
---
yeah, at first i was like "wtf? my bloodpoints?" and i decided to test it in more matches but it keeps repeating. and i was also curious why im not getting as much bloodpoints as i used to
---
Another thing that bothers me - Trapper hooks Claudette without even downing her
---
True!
---
NO WEAKNESS
---
But, I dont want a job and I am still in school.
---
They should just remove that text. It gets broken every other patch anyways.
---
Just to help you while the bug persists, stop repairing at 95% orso, then you get the points, then finish gen. Just dont start-&gt;finish repair a gen in one go or it might bug the points.
---
It also hard counters NOED and Rancor.
---
Ahhh. Machine gun.
---
Not gonna lie I'd cough up the $10 for this one
---
I see
---
What does M&amp;A stand for?
---
At rank 5 on both Survivor and Killer, actually unable to find matches without queueing for over 20 minutes and I'm not even exaggerating. I usually play Killer when the Survivor queues are bad but I just spent said 20 minutes queueing as Killer and couldn't find a single Survivor.
---
That‚Äôs what I have been doing but I keep forgetting lol
---
I wonder if he'll have any exotics for sale
---
Because the pip system was created from a monkey on a computer who still recovers from a freaking car accident !
---
From what I remember of school Spanish the gender of the person/animal doesn't matter, just the name of the animal and that's "gender" if that makes any sense
---
Not to mention saw is owned by lions gate and so is halloween
---
I might do something with this, will keep you posted
---
Pig=upvote
---
Nope, playing killers sucks and I'm dead serious about it.
---
awesome! &lt;3
---
Listen here, smart aleck...
---
I love playing against Myers because it actually feels like a horror game
---
Every crow is suspicious now.
---
That first shot "u wot m8" but then...
---
Dead by Daylight
---
Badum tss
---
(I will see myself out)
---
If you're playing a regular M1 killer like Trapper, try switching to Billy or Nurse. Once you get used to them, you should have a much easier time as their innate abilities keep the pressure on the survivors without perfect play on your part.
---
I mean you'll still get stomped by an SWF every now and then but it shouldn't be so bad you're forced to give up entirely.
---
Myers doesn't really need NOED, since he has an insta down on tier 3
---
How much is it!
---
The best perks are the same as most M1 builds:  
---
BBQ, Enduring, Ruin and Spirit Fury.  
---
Tips:  
---
Don't hit the same person twice with Frenzy in single chase.  
---
Try using the power as a tracking ability and an easy way to get everyone injured.  
---
Other than that, they're a usual 115%, M1 killer.
---
Nea is handsome af
---
Tried restarting? It might be a visual bug.
---
$55 prop canadian
---
Hex: Ruin, BBQ, Nurses Calling and Monitor &amp; Abuse. Call it a day!
---
ah, alright that makes sense
---
BHVR: We think Remember Me would be too OP in endgame.
---
BHVR again:
---
I think the rights for ghost face only include the mask, so they had free range on the costume.
---
I would like to say that survivor isn't necessarily overpowered. With just the right perks you can catch lots of survivors and playing certain killers can reduce the chase time (depending on who you play) With Doc my main, I just zap when they reach a pallet or window to close distance on them and smack em.
---
I think it says $55, but can't tell because of OP's red circle.
---
Honestly if BHVR wants my money, they should totally sell Devil-May-Care Joe's jacket/hoodie thing. I'd buy that in a heartbeat.
---
The pig says "oink' 
---
Dumbass
---
For starters, it would be ideal if the daily that tracks the number of hooks sabotaged worked. I usually have to sabotage 4-5 hooks to get the daily that requires 2.
---
I like this
---
Ok but what is that stock image. Is that a girl getting caught banging her BF?
---
Jane...
---
She is the best character 
---
She is thicc
---
I've been getting the same thing for the xbox platform
---
DbD in a nutshell
---
And the servers aren't down, I guess all you can do now is restart it and see if it works
---
I feel you. Sometimes I can forgive the lips as maybe they wanted to go for a nude shade, but I feel like Claudettes is too light to even use that excuse. And I'm not even gonna talk about their brows as those just get me goddamn triggered
---
except the one dcing doesn't get hatch?
---
This was so satisfying to watch first thing in the morning
---
I FINALLY got some people.
---
This isn't an issue with balancing the game, just because you get left on the hook it doesn't mean the game is shitty.
---
I dunno, I think it's pretty caturate.
---
It took me about 5 million BPs to get that guy on my last killer
---
If it takes you a minute to catch a survivor after missing a hit then you‚Äôre doing something wrong
---
I did too
---
Nope. Sorry :/
---
This was happening to me last night. Extremely long wait times. Idk what was up with it
---
yikes i got my bbq on lvl 1 p1 doc and havent prestiged him since. also happy cake day
---
this is too powerful :(
---
NO YOU LISTEN HERE YOU LITTLE BITCH, YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I‚ÄôLL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH, UNDERSTAND?
---
That pretty accurately sums up my reaction
---
The rank system needs adjusting. When it comes to players disconnecting there seems to be no concern for rank. Depipping because you disconnected isn't stopping people.
---
Maybe because they only had 2 people hooked according to BBQ so they didn't get many hooking points
---
Interesting build. I see the idea behind it, and it is mainly for the memes, but it was pretty fun. Stakeout turned out to be pretty solid, especially due to the fact I play on Xbox, which means hitting perfect skill checks can be difficult at times, I was really impressed with the perk. With that said, I don‚Äôt think the perk is strong enough to have 3 supporting perks behind it. I think when I test stakeout again, I‚Äôll prob drop both spine chill and diversion for an exhaustion perk plus adrenaline/mettle of man, or even iron will! I feel that would make the build a bit more consistent without completely ruining stakeout :D
---
This is soooo cute can I use it as a steam pfp uwu
---
*years later*
---
I've been waiting for you Obi-Wan. We meet again at last. The circle is now complete; when I left you I was but a learner, now **I** am the master.
---
Doesn‚Äôt it just fill them all in at once now specifically to avoid people thinking it‚Äôs a swf?
---
read the tag buddy :)
---
i think it tries to make you play more 50-50.
---
Not to mention it makes multiple Survivor Perks that do some of those things entirely pointless.
---
You get a crutch perk! And you get a crutch perk! It‚Äôs cuz people get salty and need an excuse for why they did bad.
---
What? Which 2?
---
I legit do this and people still won‚Äôt accept I‚Äôm just doing a daily T-T lol
---
They try to rag on me for using a level 1 trapper or freddy that I never play... it‚Äôs funny because almost always I‚Äôll just get people in dream state as freddy and never actually go for the kill lol, just the daily, then after I get 4 of them,I just goof around... 
---
People get mean though after the game chat it‚Äôs hilarious. It‚Äôs like they are trying to trick themselves into thinking they are gods or something
---
Lore-friendly meme. I approve.
---
I actually agree and disagree with this sentiment. Usually (as a pure solo survivor) I feel like if I don‚Äôt make mistakes I can just chill and do gens and be comfortable with controlling the flow of the game as it relates to me. 
---
As a killer you‚Äôre completely reactionary and don‚Äôt get to dictate anything except making the correct capitalization decisions based on mistakes or choices the survivor makes. EXCEPT Corrupt Intervention. I think Corrupt intervention puts me in the drivers seat for those first 120 seconds.
---
YouTube for me.
---
Ghostface will be scary as hell
---
That death spam sound really got me
---
Because they don't really do QA and also seem really bad at trouble shooting their own code
---
Now this is where you get everyone into a injured state and wait. Key us have blood warden 3 and hit one survivor and down them near a gate. Open the gate and initiate collapse then at the 50 second mark hook that survivor and be an endgame troll XD
---
This is like one of those instances that are highly unlikely to happen again any time soon and I wouldn't even be mad if I depipped.
---
Is that what you tell people that complain about DC‚Äôs that fuck up their matches? Because that‚Äôs sad. Just because a person finds negative qualities in a product for a consumer doesn‚Äôt=go elsewhere.
---
If they start doing platform exclusive cosmetics that's gonna be some bullshit.
---
It sure doesn't feel anything like 87, lol. 
---
I'd pin it somewhere from 60 to *maybe* 75
---
It doesn't reduce stun time by 75%, it increases recovery by 75%. That'a the difference between decreasing the distance you travel and increasing your speed.
---
See you in the fog m80!
---
H-H-hey! Git off my lawn dude!
---
This is how we get alcohol poisoning lmao I do plan to play DBD drunk one day though it sounds fun
---
Damn that's awesome thanks a lot
---
Spoken like a truly civilized person. My point exactly.
---
yea, but it's another thing to look foward to. imagine that one day you might run out of things to do with your bloodpoints and you'll get sad
---
just ignore tbaggers friend
---
Kinda looks like meg.
---
It‚Äôs still really good through
---
This would be so good. I love the Saw theme.
---
i see it too now that you‚Äôve said it, oops xD i wasn‚Äôt really sure about her face and i think i made her forehead a bit too large.. thank you lots though! &lt;3
---
As dcing is very annoying especially with the wait times and lobby dodges. This game is still a casual game and many people forget that. I do take it serious when I play most of the time and wantt to win and get "butt hurt" when people play shitty, I lose alot,  or  when people DC, as I do with pretty much every game I play, but It is not an esports game nor is supposed to be for competition. People like to act like this game is those things. I would not be opposed to DC penalties, but since it is a game to play casually and for fun and not for competition I personally do not think there should be penalties for a DC.
---
yess no better feeling than getting really good skins for your favorite killers! ty ty
---
Nice work
---
I mean, looking at the roadmap of future content along with how much time the average person puts into this game I really don't see a time in the future where we'll run out of things to do at a 1.1X increase, especially with prestige levels on ever character. 
---
I'm just looking at being able to create a decent build on a new character without needing to drop 1 million BP OR 10 plus hours
---
just get rid of op shit on both sides, problem solved for me.
---
Perhaps im dense but how is the time it takes you to recover different from the total time of the stun? Does only part of the animation count as recovery? To my mind and in most games, that's a distinction without a difference. Genuinely trying to understand how this works.
---
Yes this, would love to see that
---
The progression really is awful.
---
You need to play the game like it's your job just to get through the bloodweb at a decent rate.
---
I was wondering this too!! I guess the entity got mad that the killer can‚Äôt do his job well and sense the entity is getting stronger, I guess it‚Äôs able to be aggressive
---
no they still load individually unless it‚Äôs a swf
---
It's a "problem" in the sense killers actually have to try. Killers get to rank 1 easier than a survivor so they aren't accustomed to equal matchups.
---
The maddest lad
---
It boggles my mind that they put in the EGC as a method to convince survivors to leave, and make tough choices, and they still want to stay until the very end. Amazing.
---
I'm a hardcore killer main, but fuck me that was so satisfying to watch.
---
The wiki states "Once the timer runs out, any Survivors remaining in the Trial Grounds will be sacrificed by The Entity herself." You don't get the same amount of points for killing someone with EGC and you do hooking them 3 times. If you only managed to hook 2 people then 4kd because you slugged someone until the end of ECG to get blood warden them you don't deserve a pip.
---
Walking backwards to hide your killer stain around corners
---
Nah, you know what's toxic, Camping the hatch waiting for your teammate to die instead of doing anything else.
---
Pro-tip, if you don't think that's toxic behavior, than it's probably because you're so toxic yourself you can't see it.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I said, I was greeted with a fuck you and had everyone tbag me upon the hook. Such a loving community
---
I sometimes find my nose through my screen when I lunge at a survivor I've been dying to kill.
---
does the artist not know that claudette is black?
---
Holy shit
---
This also happened to me once when I was playing Myers broken Mirror in the Lery's. 2 survivors were healing a third one behind a wall, I thought I would scare the hell out of them, but when I hit one of them, I was the scared one after hearing that Monstrosity that came from nothing. :o. I guess it was karma? 
---
PS: The sound faded away after a long time.
---
&gt; Eh, camping would be going around to gens nearby and just barely letting your radius go unheard,
---
That's literally patrolling. Camping is when you don't leave the Hook area. Face camping is when you literally stand next to the hooked person.
---
You can't win, Vader. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
---
Careful, you might trip and cut yourself on all that edge.
---
When I don‚Äôt have hex ruin and survivors gen rush. I get a little heated fast. Lol I think there should be new objectives to dead by daylight honestly.
---
How would preference list work when killer can switch while survivors are already in a lobby?
---
Lets all argue technical crap!
---
#Me #Too
---
Rip
---
Yeah and the killer can't follow your blood trail so if they come back you're practically a ghost if you don't run and leave scratch marks
---
No I usually laugh manically when I get the gen rushing mettle of man using flashlight spamming cucklord. Or I just chill when I get non toxic Bois I really don't care about kills mainly just letting people have a good time and blood points.
---
There were several discussions many times about this and what clearly wouldn't be a solution is to put DCers in a bucket playing against each other, simply because the game is platform specific with a not such a big player base like other online games have and can afford such luxury.
---
What could work is a timeout for DCing - 10-15min waiting time before searching for a lobby. Even with legit DC, this is not such a big annoyance, but it will to those who DC on purpose repeatedly. I have had 3 legit DCs on PS4 in a month and I wouldn't mind to wait those minutes
---
you hitting a strong window could give the survivor enough time to reach a nearby pallet and continue with the chase
---
You've got wood.
---
Yes, let the darkness flow.
---
I hate legion but I don‚Äôt hate this drawing. Good job
---
Nah dude it's all about #shirtlessLeatherface
---
I‚Äôve actually had the opposite experience. I‚Äôve played dbd for so long on pc, got my gf onto it on ps4, played a ton there, got a ps4 for myself so we can play together. Bought overwatch around legion release &amp; played everyday since then. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I do love dbd &amp; still follow the updates but I just haven‚Äôt had the desire to wait in lobby so long for a game &amp; the disconnects &amp; other frustrations just throw me back on overwatch. I am trying to play more dbd with the endgame collapse update.
---
Well the actor actually played ghostface so... this fits better, lol
---
I bet he had nothing but love planned for you in the post game chat /s
---
I don't see a problem there YET
---
I'd rather have things get unreachable than having to play without getting anything out of my points
---
Good, good
---
I see where you're coming from. It feels like you have to sweat much more as killer than as survivor but this is because there are 4 survivors and only one killer. I agree that they should make the killer gameplay at least a bit more relaxing
---
Those health state and full generator ones always feel like they take forever. Do they not take boosts into consideration?
---
in most matches, playing as killer is extremely easy. i think its the SWF that can sometimes give u bad luck, but even then i can usually hook everyone once for the BBQ, and i let everyone live regardless anyway
---
That pig was mad.
---
This may be unpopular, but I think when dedicated servers come online and are - for the most part - stable, you are going to see *a lot* of unhappy killers. You probably would have gotten that on a dedicated server.
---
I get hits as killer through windows and pallets where my immediate reaction is "I can't believe I hit him."
---
Honestly David's face stops me from enjoying him. Can they give us a paper bag cosmetic?
---
The world can't handle that kind of power, I would agree otherwise. Why not Leatherface wearing shirtless Dwight as a shirt
---
Probs stu
---
She‚Äôs looking 7ft tall and 125lbs
---
OP confirmed for next killer
---
I agree it would be perfection. But to reach peak performance we need shirtless clown without makeup
---
Except it won‚Äôt even have that red stripe as the poncho is part of the head. It‚Äôll be an all black torso with the grey hood, which is as close to an all black costume/ original as we‚Äôre gonna get.
---
It always could. When a survivor dies on the hook that's the entity killing them. That's why they get stabbed by the tentacles and stuff.
---
The entity just uses the killers as additional energy batteries and a way to get the survivors scared. If it did all the work itself it wouldn't be able to eat the hope from survivors, as they'd know they dont have a hope of escaping.
---
It‚Äôs pretty nasty in 3 gen setups too.
---
Swing through pallets, 50/50 shot you hit em through it lol
---
S P O I L E R S
---
Toxic Kate here. üòÇ
---
I love stealth so I totally will. Out of all the skins we've seen so far, his p3 is my favorite.
---
The entity takes joy of watching the game of cat and mouse, if you have a shitty cat that doesn't eat the mice you're going to be displeased. Or having the mice stretch out the game is also boring and not want the entity wants so it ends the trial himself hoping to be better entertained the next time.
---
Fcking brilliant dude
---
Hold on... I haven't played un a long time... BLOOD WARDEN DOES NOT PAUSE THE TIMER??
---
So far we've only had the 80s themed sets on sale for shards for a couple days one time, and there's nothing to suggest Bhvr is even going to do that again. Which sucks, because there's no way I'm dropping ¬£6 on a single fucking skin in this game.
---
^*think about it*
---
I don't mean to be *that* guy, but you might want to change the section on the hatch mechanics, just sayin'.
---
Finally, a chance to play as myself as a killer, that would be nice.
---
That's depressing just like me not getting BBQ after 20 fucking levels
---
Same, when you look at shirtless Dwight from the bottom up you're in for an unfortunate ending.
---
It might be clearer with a foot on the pallet breaking it but this is actually hilarious
---
The only reason I'll ever DC is because of garbage teammates. And I don't mean bad teammates that at least do something, I'll happily deal with those.
---
I'm talking about the ones that refuse to work on gens and just sit in a corner. Just had a game against a pretty good piggy, a few people got downed, then I got downed and I just had to watch as my teammates were all together crouching when the pig was nowhere near them. The only gen that got done was done by me. I don't like screwing over teammates but it really wouldn't have mattered in this case. They were all rank 5 btw...
---
Most of them just said gg. Dwight was really mad though.
---
Like I said, not the best build, and yeah I do it mainly for fun ^^ if you were to use this seriously, indeed drop diversion. I like spine chill but that's a personal favourite I guess. I usually just play with friends and mostly for fun, and I'm super low rank so it's easier to get the killers with diversion, hilarious at times
---
Thanks for that. Didn‚Äôt think about that.
---
If you got 5000 escape points, the killer DCed. If not, you DCed.
---
At least, you can usually tell that way, but I have seen some posts from people not getting ANY points when the killer DCs since the recent patch.
---
Also I've been getting kicked from games way more often since the recent patch :(
---
It's not a breach of the EULA since the build was made public.
---
lol exactly.
---
If only they gave more survivor dailies &gt;:(
---
lol
---
BUSTED, MAKE A PUN FOR IT
---
No, it won't be "fixed." They lose points on their emblems for staying close to a hooked survivor, that's about as much as you can hope for.
---
It happens to my friend a lot also.
---
Wise words indeed.
---
I doubt it, they couldn't even get it into the official game.
---
If anything though, I'm hoping that Pig gets a unique theme when she gets selected like the more recent killers did with the recent update (yes I know those were their release themes, but still.)
---
Because killers feel like they need 4k or else they lose. Obviously not true but it's a stigma. At least the survivors know they just need to get themselves out (unfortunately this has killed some team play, esp post-exit gates opening)
---
It looks freaking amazing!!
---
............*says the doc*
---
you need to be more than 40 meters away for him to see you, fast vaults don't give the killer a notification at this distance
---
You can swear on the internet sweetie
---
Yea it won't be "fixed". Just focus on ranking up, you'll see it less as you get higher in ranks.
---
It's also Sony that slows down the amount of updates/patches/fixes released
---
Same same at 13
---
I was playing wraith with shadowborne to try and get the most of the pallet as visible as possible, but now that I look at it, yeah. The pallet breaking animation is weird too. It goes from like kinda breaking up to just basically vanishing into pieces and it made it a bit hard lol.
---
Wish they had more blood, and looked a lot more grotesque like Nurse.
---
Unfortunately it's part of the game. Which is annoying because then you have to run shit like Mom, Ds, which gets in the way because then I'm the next games you could not face a camper.
---
I mean I gotta say, I got totally fucked that game. Pallet town was not fun as plague against those guys. Did I deserve the pip? Probably not but at least that big brain play at the end was nice.
---
Which part?
---
I just feel like if you're a camper you shouldnt even safety pip so those people stay in ranks they belong.  I ran into a rank 4 camping huntress. It was at the beginning of the match 5 gens and that person didnt get to do anything. They put them in the basement and we couldnt get down there. I was soloing but if I was with friends we couldve got them out. We always go in for the save even it's for randoms. But it's hard to conduct if theres no communication
---
It's like they don't understand who Dwight is.
---
There was no time left and everyone was still in the match, killer got a hook. They just earned four sacrifices.
---
We need more pajama dwight cosmetics imo. Boxers, white tee, calf socks. Let's gooo
---
Never disrespect Bunny Min
---
There are perks to counter camping for survivors and killer perks that encourage them to chase other players, e.g. Borrowed Time or Barbecue and Chili. The Devs stated that camping is a valid strategy and although it is extremely unfun for both the survivor on the hook and the killer it will never be really "fixed". A survivor can be on the hook for 120 seconds and it takes just 80 seconds for a single survivor to complete a generator without toolboxes, perks and great skill checks, which means that if the killer decides to facecamp one survivor the other three can easily get 3 or more generators done, likely making the killer de-pip and granting him next to no bloodpoints. It's boring and frustrating if you are the one on the hook but if the other survivors just do their best to get gens done the killer will feel like a proper dum-dum. (Hope this helps anything, I usually don't post stuff lol)
---
THE ENTITY: Because I wish it.  You do, as I require, when I give the option, as you feel you need to do.
---
This is my realm, with my requirements, and it's enchanting watching you scurry to appease me for mere bloodpoints thinking your sacrifices on my gaffs are *not* eventually going to happen.
---
These trials, these rituals, make you sanguine... optimistic... and your screams of pain as they pierce the Fog when you are denied an accomplishment excite me.
---
But please, continue.
---
-T.E.
---
It wont be. The devs said themselves that it was a completely valid strategy, no matter how much we all hate it
---

---
My adrenaline starts pumping when I'm the last survivor.  Looking for the hatch. Or when I'm opening an exit door. Lol
---
Games like these are what make me check for dead hard *ALWAYS*
---
I‚Äôm the first killer with a sidekick! https://i.imgur.com/JEZCkAn.jpg
---
This is incredibly well done. Kudos. Only thing I would mention is maybe the levels which you get another perk slot. But seriously good job on this.
---
Lmao that and the fact that Killers now toy with us just to make us die by the entity during the timer. And if you're able to escape, they'll carry you to a  hook because they don't like losing at their game. This is so fucking stupid.
---
This is my point. If EGC count to pips then you will get loads of killers using NOED and Blood Warden as clutches to kill the over alturisitic SWF that want to help their buddies out. BHVR need to make up their minds they want survivors to stay and help put their team mates that are hooked (Benevolent points) but they also want them to leave asap (EGC). What do you want from us solo survivors at red ranks BHVR?
---
Hehe I‚Äôve never escaped as a final survivor when the killer closes the hatch - I‚Äôve relied solely on the hatch if I get crippled teammates and honestly it‚Äôs been a pain to actually survive
---
It was the most appropriate "worthless perk" I could think of. I could've maybe used We're Gonna Live Forever or something I suppose.
---
With Leatherface it makes sense to have references to the movie since they actually are able to use the real Leatherface but a lot of the debate with Ghostface seems to be whether or not they got the license for just the mask and created a character around that or if this is actually Scream related so anything that could potentially be a reference makes me cautiously optimistic for it being a chapter. I'm on the same boat too though getting Ghostface will be great regardless.
---
The game of the year edition is the console version so you get doctor and hag for free on PS4 and xbox included within the base game. The huntress is a free dlc you can get from the PlayStation store or the Xbox live marketplace. Hope this clears things up for you.
---
Huntress is a free dlc on all platforms. The other killers are free because they're bundled into the special edition.
---
Exactly. Just went against the nurse. She closed the hatch but then what am I supposed to do against a nurse who can just camp both doors.
---
Great, as a killer main it basically stops hatch stand offs but if the killer closes the hatch then well have good fun getting steel shoved through your shoulder or penetrated by a spider god.
---
So you have a recovery speed right, the time it takes to go through the animation? Enduring speeds up the animation by 75%. It's the same principle as when you speed up a YouTube video or the like. If you increase the rate at which something is done by 100%, it doesn't mean that it doesn't happen, it just takes half as long to accomplish. The exact wording is "Your rate of recovery from stuns is increased by 75%".
---
Legion is like that asshole that smokes in trains.
---
I think a system like the MTG arena wildcard would be a nice QOL change and still keep the grind. The bloodweb could have a chance to spawn a wildcard perk which when unlocked would allow you to choose any perk available to you. Either upgrade an existing one or grab a vital one you don't have like BBQ or Ruin.
---
Oh wow. So that‚Äôs why I wouldn‚Äôt get pips even when doing 3 gens and getting saves because the game didn‚Äôt register it? Wtf
---
That's a depippin'
---
Someone was being chased and hooked? I wouldn't leave either until my teammates are safe or can't be saved. 
---
I haven't played since Legion but feeling very iffy about the game working like this now. Shouldn't the timer be paused by blood warden?
---
"Earned" is not the right word here. If he had 4 stacks of BBQ he might have earned it but he didn't. He managed to hook 2 people. Slug one person at the end and managed to make the entity 4k for him from 1 perk. I wouldn't say that is "earning four sacrifices". The same way a survivor escapes while hiding in a locker all game then finding the hatch. Sure they escaped but did they "earn the escape" no hence why they probably won't have pipped.
---
Can we see all 5 of ghostface‚Äôs skins?
---
Ugh, he's so overrated.
---
It‚Äôs working as intended which I like, to end the damn game. There was nothing worse as a killer than waiting 10 minutes for the immersed survivor to find the hatch.  Now, it‚Äôs a race to the hatch or gate, as it should be. I very much like end game.
---
Since two others have already answered, I'm here to thank you for your service.
---
Crop-top twink Billy.
---
But once the hatch is closed it is near impossible for the survivor to escape. Good concept but massively favours the killer.
---
I would add a ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù in the section that has when the hatch spawns. Really good job on this!
---
What?! You still got entity displeased???! You should get a bonus for that. Wow! That was perfect  üòÑüòÑ
---
Thanks! It's on there! End of second paragraph on first box!
---
I‚Äôm not too worried about pips.
---
I am worried about not having fun cuz of Legion trials.
---
Earned is the right word, they used game mechanics and perks as intended. I'm not saying they should have pipped, i'm saying they should count as normal sacrifices.
---
No much sense as a tip mainly because you never know which killer it will be lol.
---
No, and I apologise if I came across the wrong way. It just seemed like you were unhappy about quite a few things, and it felt like repeated exposure to those things was only making it worse. I was simply making a suggestion that you might find playing something else more rewarding or worth your time.
---
I've played a game every day out of habit, and there were a lot of things that I didn't like about it, but I kept playing it every day because that's just what I did. When I moved to something else, I was much happier with my gaming experience.
---
Again, just a suggestion - not anything more :)
---
You sure showed me
---
I don't take any offense, and the goal can tehnically be whatever you want, mine is to pip because I want to rank up, for others it can be escaping. It doesn't matter I guess... but I would rather pip than escape...
---
Thanks!
---
Hmm that might be a good idea! Thanks for the feedback!
---
I fucking Love this.

It's usually more worth to just buy the survivor perks off the altar if you don't really fancy any characters so you don't get perks that are considered bad.

The base characters have literally all of the Meta perks with exceptions to Ashes mettle of man.

__No, stop, that's like suggesting someone use a Map with gate tracking addons and Deja Vu + This Is Not Happening.__

Good to know, thanks for the info

Lol I didn't even read the title and I started laughing. Then I read the title and laughed again. Kudos.
---
Lol this is a meme I thought about while playing spirit and killing a Jane lol
---
I'm not annoyed because I play survivor mostly but I feel like there should be an add on for it. I feel like most the other killers have one. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It would obviously have to be an ultra rare add on though.
---
"*I gotta do all the damn work around here."*
---
The guy who was supposed to announce Ghostface confirmed that it's a Killer, Survivor, and Map. Judging by previous leaks from a long time ago the map is "Sidney's House" (possible beta name) and as a result the survivor is probably Sidney.
---
Clap
---
I wasn't aware such a subreddit existed. Regardless I think these look amazing, and I seriously can't wait for Tapp's cosmetics.

&gt;The killer can now be put on a hook!

This is an interesting survivor buff

PUDDING PARTY

The killer can be put on the hook?

Damn, I'll be sure to not leave survivors in dying state or a feng min could hook me.

Anyway, good job, add a few statuses and it will be better than the ingame one.

Wrong. Morf_uk (a fog whisperer) confirmed there is NO survivor. Do you have proof? Otherwise you're just spreading fake shit
---
Hex: Kawaii?
---
You could make due with just the Paintbrush, but you're really fucking yourself without a range addon in there. You'll never catch up to someone that knows to run away; this basically nullifies the Z Block
---
iri head, pinky finger, that kinda shit. and fix nurse and all of her addons. make it so the blinks have to be good by removing the lunge, make it so she can't make 4+ fucking mistakes and still succeed. i play nurse sometimes and there is rarely a need for more than 2, even 1 blink.

because it was "unfun to play against"

Do the the exit gates open when the killer closes the hatch?

Something like that.
---
However despite the robot like appearance it wouldn't be one as it's someone wearing a high tech futuristic suit.
---
Due to how the suit functions and looks you wouldn't be able to tell what gender they are and tell backstory never mentions it either.
---
Ok that commentary was actually fuckin hilarious

The gates are powered but you still have to open them using the switch as normal.

Wow nice

before. once they use it the obsession transfers to them.

*yawn* ok. Well I think some of us will go with the opinion of the best players in the game over a random reddit user.

 He wasn't even supposed to say it. I'm assuming he's getting shit from the devs right now. Not to mention that he was aware of that since a long time ago. Things could have changed since then.

Thanks for correcting me. You also get my upvote.

Sounds like a lot of fun
---
Touching myself
---
* Still think the body of the Nea set is too high-vis but the rest of it looks good. Might buy the pants seperately.
---
* Virgin regular Joey V.S. Chad Neon Joey. This one looks so much better than the default Joey and that makes me upset. :/
---
* Jane transfers some of that booty thiccness to her legs. The set looks nice but it has the problem that a lot of Jane sets have IE the parts don't look good individually.
---
* Adam set is nice and simple though the hair is kinda weird. (As per usual.) Still probably going to buy the whole thing.
---
* OH LAWD CLOWN'S CHICKEN LEGS. The set looks as awful in-game as I thought it would and I love it.
---
* Jake is a precious child and I want to defend him with my life. Also the first time I saw the gloves in his pocket I was like "Yoshikage Kira?" Might buy the pants for the sake of a meme but the whole set looks nice.
---
* UwU David Daddy. Y'all spend too long staring at his ass lol.
---
* The kimono really doesn't look good in-game. Might be because of how Spirit bends her body. Not a fan overall. :/
---
* White Ghostface looks really nice. Also (if we're getting a Survivor) is this the first time a Killer gets a unique item for DLC purchase (as opposed to Cell purchase)?
---
* Amanda sets just generally look nice. Think the dress one looks better but the knife in the leather jacket one looks real good too.
---
* Cop Tap looks awesome. Even the pants look great and I might just wear them seperately. Definetly buying this whole set as a Tapp main, and probably going to wear the hat along with his Prestige clothes.
---
* Daniel Rigg Tapp also looks good though the pants look a little weird. Do like the leather jacket but I dont know what part of the set makes him look like a porn star.
---
* OWO HUNTRESS. Probably the best skin they've made in some time. If I played Huntress even a little this would be an instant buy for me.
---
* Wraith set still looks really ugly to me. Doesn't fit his asthetic or the asthetic of the game. Looks like something out of Silent Hill.
---
* More ugly bright Feng sets don't @ me
---
* Dwight's a pokemon trainer. The pants and hair look terrible but the body is real nice.
---
No worries fam, I appreciate the build :)
---
Okay but serious moment:
---
* Blond Hair from the Neon collection. (Wrap Around Shades)
---
* Either the Samurai Jake body (Wool Noragi Jacket) or the Tommy Wiseau body (Dashing Shirt and Jacket)
---
* Pants with H A N D S
---
* Get a Nea wearing all pink (Pink Hair, Pink Kitty Sweater [Dart City set], some pink pants) to SWF with you. Get her to bring Winter Party Starters or Chinese Firecrackers if she has them.
---
* Jake is named Yoshikage Kira and Nea is named Killer Queen
---
It‚Äôs underwhelming. Personally I think the collapse should trigger when the gates become powered rather than opened. Would make the endgame very tense and exciting for both sides. It‚Äôs only there to make sure games actually end.
---
Purchase 2 points in both directions. Then buy bitter murmur, then buy the Mori, then grab the streamer. You can put 4 points into a web and after the 5th point the entity consumes a perk. No ‚Äúeither or‚Äù here if you spend properly.
---
Trapper has a theme.
---
Survivors aren‚Äôt meant to escape. It‚Äôs an A-symmetrical game for a reason
---
Well it's pretty clear when their power is lethal, they are effectively old Legion
---
Also killers everytime they mori jane.
---
But here is what happened, we were both on the hatch as it opened. I was spamming the escape bc i knew I couldn't get grabbed. I got a split second of my escape animation but it canceled it so the killer could close it
---
If there's a wall, uncloak behind it
---
just ping.
---
Because the tie goes to the killer.
---
If the Killer is at the hatch, you've got two other exits to get out at. If you sit there stupidly trying to "Lol killer can't get me", you deserve to be shut down.
---
And promptly taken down, leaking information is a breach of the EULA.
---
How long does it last?

Probably. It's still bs and I'm still mad lmao

Progress is saved on a server/internal hard drive
---
The community seems a step or two better than most PvP games. Also, really, if someone runs full on into me when they are just off the hook I am going to hit them. If there is a choice of survivor, I won't - but if do they run at me then they need to learn to be more careful.
---
YES
---
I've been saying they should just day ban people who actively dc. Not the ones that are unintentional.
---
Wait no perks or or obsession perks
---
You had me at Hoffman Oinker. Damn, son.
---
Sp00py girl
---
This scenar will come so ofter now that EGC is on. I wont try a late rescue if someone is down in EGC just because I'll be scare of bloodwarden
---
No obsession perks sorry about that lol
---
Yes. NOED is still that bad. 
---
Both perks are stupid, but one adrenaline applies to one survivor, plus you have to be in a chase with said person for it to even matter that they have adrenaline. Unless you‚Äôre Freddy, because he gets shafted. 
---
Noed applies to everyone until its been cleansed on top of getting a speed boost.

FUUUUUU

Whenever I play the game I keep getting error 300 or error 8014 after the game which disconnects me and causes me to lose the rewards from that match.
---
Using a VPN completely removes the problem but gives me much higher ping. I am living in UAE and my ISP is Etisalat, I've seen others have the same issue. I've contacted BHVR for it but they said they're aware and are not planning to fix it.
---
Does anyone have a solution that works and doesn't ruin your ping?
---
If you say so, "friend".
---
Use whatever you want and don't give a shit about what others says.
---
Could‚Äôve tried to get the killer to hit them so they were down slowing the timer, but that would be a stretch and I‚Äôm only thinking of it now cause Hindsight is 20/20.

It's one of the many references to Twitch streamers. This one in particular is a phrase from Vinc3ntvega.
---
I like it! My friends and I instituted an NBA point system to the game, might have to make the person with the worst stats drink at the end of the match!
---
The reason for egc was to prevent survivors from holding the game hostage
---
Saving Dwight is what screwed them though. 
---
So I‚Äôd say Kate is the one who ruined everything in the end cause she wasn‚Äôt aware of the full situation.
---
I get messages on PS4 constantly. And when I turned messages off for a while they‚Äôd friend request me and add a message to it. Never underestimate how far out of the way people will go to insult you for playing a game ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù
---
Not sure why my comment got downvoted so much..
---
You're right. It's the weapon from the valentine's day outfit.
---
Go on...
---
Ah, I see.
---
Money for less cosmetics genius!
---
But in seriousness this is a pretty cool idea, but i doubt it will work for pig since the Pig head is the entire thing that makes her 'the pig'
---
Leon S Kennedy survivor when
---
They already did it with the Nurse and her new cosmetic that reveals her face a bit. I'd love to see that with other killers as well, even their full faces [as you can see here](https://imgur.com/a/ugagDIy).
---
Also, bald head cosmetic for the Hag would really go well since you can see her bald on her body cosmetic item! I would love to see her bald with all those vines on her head!
---
My taste is more like quentin or jake

Y'know what, Akali is the best character of all time tbh
---
It was a real post
---
Stealth isn't how the game is meant to be played, yet there are lockers you can hide in, you have to take Perks to find survivors, and being Injured actively makes you harder to find.
---
Just because the players play the game "Wrong" doesn't mean this wasn't supposed to be a game where Killers had the upper hand if they found you initially. This game is filled to the brim with mechanics and systems that showcase that we play this game a lot different then the Devs intended.
---
A decently high rank game where the Survivors haven't cleansed the totems means they really don't have a reason to complain about being punished for it. They knew NoED was a thing, they only have themselves to blame for blindly doing the Gens and the Killer smacking them for it.
---
Sauce please
---
Also her perk Solidarity is great for a healer build and you can replace self-care and save so much time.
---
really? i‚Äôve only had a few people call me a noob when i tried out a new killer... i always send them a nice message and they‚Äôll say sorry and feel bad, so i‚Äôm not worrying too much about it. if they‚Äôre actually really mean to you then that‚Äôs probably extremely annoying! i think everyone should play killer and survivor to understand the other side instead of being salty and making up their own rules that killers have to follow
---
True! I'd just love to see Amanda's face though since she has a beautiful rendered one! She's still a human and not an actual pig so it would kinda make sense I guess.
---
ur mum gey
---
which one?
---
God i wish i saw little of hag at rank 1.
---
Wait till the killer comes to see if you're at the door, pop out of the locker when they leave, open the door and get out?
---
Alternatively, you can take the risk that they'll just go to the other door and try to open it.
---
There are ways of doing it, my man. It's only 20 seconds to get the door open and maybe 3 seconds to run out. You're only screwed if the door isn't open, the hatch is closed, and the Killer knows where you are.
---
And if the Killer has managed to make that all happen, you deserve the L.
---
I wouldn't even mind paying for that. 400 auric cells for a cosmetic that let's you see the face of killers would be nice
---
It ended Monday
---
Would you prefer pally-o-wally?
---
I don't think Legion is way worse than before, he never was great to begin with. But he is still in low-mid tier in my opinion. Yeah, you get a easy first hit and may stall a bit, but you don't do much progress on your side either.
---
It definitely is flawed, like I don't mind it.. But I do admit I get a little salty in after game when I see some red ranks mixed with purple. I just always assume SWF since sometimes I play late at night, and on PS4 at night killers ranks can vary so it gives me what's available. Idk, it might be just shitty matchmaking. I think SWF should only be able to join up if they are all the same rank, that's my opinion. So the killer they get is their rank, not a casual like me lol.
---
Shit
---
I don't see the problem here tbh.
---
Oh yeah i mean, i get where you're coming from, the issue is it's licensed so i doubt Lionsgate would sign off on removing the pig head.
---
\*\*FUCK\*\*
---
\*Throws Phone\*
---
fucking hit me with the phone DICK
---
Exactly! And you would get more than 1 cosmetic because for example body skins for the hag would change the top of her head as well so you would even get more variations of cosmetics!
---
Sorry, I didn't mean to imply there was a problem. I'm just laughing since I usually get these dailies of getting chased for 2+ minutes. 2 seconds was a new one xD
---
I'm not salty, a 3k is a good game yes, but when i get cheated out of a 4th kill that I am about to get and deserve, that isn't fair.
---
I had somebody message me calling me a cunt for knowing where he was using Legion‚Äôs power because they didn‚Äôt understand that he can see locations during feral frenzy. I play both roles for precisely that reason.
---
I see this as as absolute win!
---
Yes but their friend does. Randos don't dc to give hatch, swf teams do.
---
If you were already in the animation, he should‚Äôve just grabbed you. Either way, you weren‚Äôt getting out of that situation
---
This happened in a game I had yesterday. Someone DC'd and then this. I thought my ears were going to explode.
---
if i'm being slugged for the 4k i wanna move on to the next game, so i'll dc swf or not. it's a game and i wanna enjoy it.
---
I'm not trying to be God tier or anything, just playing to have fun. I dont even like doing SWF on survivor to be honest, it takes the fun out of it for me. I'm a casual gamer so idc if I get destroyed from time to time. I just get salty getting paired up with red ranks, but I think that's because I play late at night on PS4.
---
I‚Äôve only had the game since January so this is the only build I‚Äôve made. Also I‚Äôve only got Dwight perks on my lvl 50 Dwight right now lol. But I‚Äôm glad it works for you!
---
flying?
---
My argument is that he‚Äôs much better than before. His power is no longer a hindrance.

Killer would become weaker because of that. That is the reason why most "quality of life" changes for solo survivors are not implemented.
---
This is the ritual rework they were asking about in the player satisfaction survey :)
---
Imagine struggling against freddy
---
Come out from that rock you live under because they removed the ability to grab someone from the hatch,hence the title of this post.
---
What‚Äôs your advice for playing around him then, oh lord of sarcasm
---
Mmmm that is so satisfying
---
Show submission first, he may hook you first for BBQ stack but make him trust you and you will live, results may vary
---
Why should I? They removed the ability to grab someone from the hatch and we were already mid chase by the time hatch opened.
---
Lol Tobert did not say that. I follow him on Twitter. He just said he confirmed ghostface was coming he didn't say anything else about the identity
---
But they easily could have left. They just wanted the 4E. That's the choice they made.
---
Leon Kennedy for Dead by Daylight pls

---
NOED rewards the killer for not completing their objectives. It punishes survivors for completing theirs. When you have no viable method of telling if all of the totems on the map are cleansed outside if a 4 man SWF, you cant ensure that all the totems are cleansed before the end of the game, unless you plan on wasting 10 minutes searching the entire map for destroyed totems and remembering their position.
---
1. In the time it takes to vault a pallet, you could‚Äôve destroyed it instead. 
---
2. Hitting a single survivor forces you to seek out other survivors, or else it will end and stun you for 4 seconds (Which happens no matter what)
---
3. Survivors can easily get away due to the inability to view footprints in Feral Frenzy and the inability to search lockers while in FF
---
4. The mending is the most useless status effect next to hemorrhage. You can‚Äôt see the bar progress as killer and by simply being in the terror radius, the bar doesn‚Äôt go down.
---
The Shape is fucking hilarious
---
Well then you‚Äôll really have to learn how to loop
---
Not greed really, just helping someone else survive.. not greed for myself, just tryna get them more bp too!
---
Is there anything under Ghostface‚Äôs mask?
---
when you draw fanart of a dark skinned black character and tone her skin color down so she looks more like a tanned white woman then yes its a blatant example of white washing
---
using your Sprint Burst, Lithe or Balanced Landing (when possible) to get as far as possible once he starts putting you to sleep. 
---
if he isn't chasing anyone and you start hearing his lullaby, leave this gen and start running, because he's probably going to your gen and he'll start chasing you soon. Spine Chill can help you a lot, because it lets you know that he's going toward your gen. The distance you gained will help you a lot.
---
Right, just kinda lame cause you want your friends to survive too! I guess I‚Äôd rather face NoEd than BW in the end lol
---
Lmao DC = cheating.
---
I giggled. Beautiful.
---
The point still remains. It‚Äôs there to prevent you from having a 7 hour staring contest and thanks to you, I also know that closing the hatch is very useful in accomplishing this goal
---
but at least you have an option to not use it. you can chase like a regular M1 killer and use it right before landing your hit to gain some anti-stealth.
---
freddy on the other hand can't even think about not using his power
---
Lol.
---
You can see him in the background.
---
No character will ever be better than the best girl Evelynn, it‚Äôs been that way since season 2 for me and no one can change my mind.
---
It's like it's like you're purposely being dense. They shouldn't be able to interrupt the Escape at all
---
lowkey I wish no mither actually did something
---
Wait what were they doing for 1:30 while the gates were already open? And no one was hooked yet?
---
Glad you were nurse am I right??
---
..
---
. .. . ...
---
I‚Äôll show myself out
---
The killer who has people injured for majority of the game cause they don‚Äôt want to give her long distance blood puke? Yes. This is excellent for her.
---
So I just wound up downed on the hatch with some Huntress sitting right there as my last teammate escape. I started the jump animation but she slammed it shut and the jump promptly terminated.
---
Is this a bug or just how this works now? I was under the impression they could not interrupt exits now.
---
yes the person under mask is &gt;!Nea!&lt;
---
Sure.
---
lmaoo! but fr
---
Fun fact: He didn't mean to throw the phone at Stu but the blood was slippery af.
---
The survivor has a 50% chance to get rid of his trap at the first box, so you need to be very lucky and to know where he tried first, so you can patrol the other box. But he has plenty of time before he dies from a trap and if you patrol the box, you can't patrol the gens, so others survivors can just do the gens and escape. It's not a good strategy most of the time. I know Monto succeed to pull off a kill because of Amanda Letter's, but it was against boosted survivors, against good survivors, he wouldn't got more than 1 kill.
---
Ahh yeah I watched it from Monto‚Äôs perspective and it was hilarious how nobody believed him on the Game map match
---
Totems are an objective. If they didn't cleanse the totems then they failed at their objective. They get punished.
---
plague doesn't wear a mask though I do like the idea for some other killers
---
mainly trapper and legion though BHVR would have to make actual designs for their faces and all that because the simple removal of the mask model wouldn't really look good, like at all
---
No I don't think so, but i'll probably try to get on later today to see i can get it to work.
---
I think if anything, you need to come out of the rock. It‚Äôs an a-symmetrical game. Survivors aren‚Äôt supposed to escape.
---
Are we sure that the killers are Billy and Stu? I hope so but I'm afraid we might get the guy from the TV series instead just like how we got remake freddy :p
---
Aw, thanks üíö
---
Fair points and good translation ^^ Altough im not a big fan of translating proper names.
---
Good luck mate.
---
Yeah, it's a bad add-on for sure. The fact that Tyde Tyme said "Amanda's Letter is Pig's best add-on" demonstrate how bad this add-on actually is.
---
Thank you
---
Also works on Legion, don't forget about hex: hounted grounds and NOED. Oh and Iridescent head huntress.
---
Thank you. Just making sure.
---
Yes, No Mither is the best perk in the game. I run it all the time
---
I dunno, I get a sense of accomplishment out of it, seems dumb but I just like being in the higher ranks despite the extra toxicity and tryhards, I find it as more of a challenge... just how I see it, besides, they'll make ranking rewards soon enough, the community has been complaining about no rewards for so long now, it'd be stupid of BHVR to not add rewards. I don't disagree tho, ranking does definitely need rewards, just a few extra BP or something...
---
"So we're gonna give him tree themed clothing a-"

"But he is the tree..."

---
You got a boyfriend, I bet he doesn't kiss ya
---
Whats funny is that No Mither actually countered Legion before his rework
---
These comments are bizarre. I'm super stressed as survivor, but as a killer I'm completely relaxed.
---
I would expected a Meg to do that, but a Feng ???
---
I wish the killer didn't know you ran No Mither, then I would be totaly fine with the perk. I mean, I use it regardless, but it'd be nice if the killer didn't know

its just a joke bro

I was chasing Kate the whole time pretty much, she had me in a tough spot at a pallet. If I broke it, she could go and leave, same if I went around. So we kinda danced around it until Dwight came along.
---
I'm not saying it should just insta down, I'm saying that if you use like noed, then use it, it doesnt take advantage of the exposed status

What's happen Michael ? You're mad that Ardetha don't love you anymore ? Get over it.
---
Shouldn't it be swapped since Ghostface is the "newer" killer in DBD?
---
i don't get how that is different from 4 people dcing at the start before egc. it's not like they gain more bloodpoints than just playing the game, they're just doing it to be assholes and that happened before aswell. it happens to us survivors too infact. we use 4 escape cakes, the killer closes their game in the loading screen/dc's at the start. we bring BPS, the killer does it. they lose out but they're being a dick so it's whatever.
---
What an idiot lmao
---
10% more BP per consecutive game capped at 100%. Lose all stacks if you disconnect.
---
Your power, Barks and Bites, allows you to send out a tiny terror to sniff out scratch marks, which will alert you to survivors' presence. If your furry companion finds a survivor directly, it will hound them doggedly, revealing their aura for as long as your doggo has them in its sights.
---
PHAAA GROSS!!
---
i like it!! It will creep me out!
---
Reminder, Wraith was the original stalking killer
---
I put a reminder a month from now on my phone xD I‚Äôm gonna message them and invite them to a match.
---
I was wondering why gen repair daily was so hard to complete.
---
Then embrace if you must
---
And the killers objective is to kill and stop gens. Guess what two things they weren't doing if no-ed procs. Its rewarding killers for failing not just one, but both of their objectives. Its punishing survivors for doing their main objective, which is the gens. And thanks for ignoring my point that it takes a 4 man SWF to be 100% sure all the totems are cleansed unless you want to waste your entire match looking to see if any dull totems have been cleansed
---
dc issue is nowhere near as bad as people say it is lmao. i've played quite a lot of killer games and i get like 1 dc per 6 games. just don't be a dick and you won't get dcs, problem solved.
---
Mwah
---
Legion was clearly inspired by Ghostface and most people seem to agree Ghostface is the better of the two.
---
There should be a warning system followed by a 24 hour ban. I thought PS4 was bad, but PC takes the cake. I can‚Äôt even play a match lately without a disconnect. It‚Äôs the only thing that makes it bearable now is the new end game and then it‚Äôs a 50/50 chance the hatch spawns on the other wise of the match.
---
now i wonder if Ghostface and Frank are the same height in-game. from what i saw from the leak, they looked pretty similar in size.
---
huh? i don't get it. If you finish a gen in 1 time, u get zero points?
---
Big mood?
---
Fun fact: I made Legion about 85% his normal size for this photo
---
The entity is the one who killis them on the hook not the killer.
---
i play on ps4. if pc is that bad yiiikes
---
OwO what dosth be'et this?
---
I agree with the dc point but do pips really matter? Like I don't even care about rank and just fuck around because rank means absolutely nothing at all it shouldn't even exist they should remove it. I think the only time I cared about rank was when I wasn't even having fun because I only cared about rank meaning I played scummy to win but now I'm just playing meme builds and letting people get hatch. Point is dc deserve to be punish but pipping doesn't matter.
---
No the killer sacrifices the survivors on the hook. The entity collects them.
---
But the killer didn't sacrifice anyone
---
A lot of people, both killers and survivors, want dcs to be punished (not internet faulty dcs, just ragequiting dcs). In the survey a while ago one of the questions was exactly that, "should dcing be bannable" well idk how many agreed to this, but I would love to see it implemented, or at least make it so dcs don't cause you to lose a pip
---
You have no idea. Xbox, at least for me, doesn‚Äôt have that problem as much ... but PS4 started becoming an issue after they made it free with plus.
---
Imagine just hearing the heartbeat and not knowing if he was staring at your locker. It would be so intense.
---
Still better than half the people there
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Couldn't the killer just carry a downed survivor to the fog wall and kill them?
---
Your probably right it was probably just a late DS skill check still crazy I got the blind tho
---
Probably will be an add-on or Map Offering though.
---
It was Shaggy all along!!1
---
I was happy until you said PS4. I want Santa Ace to come on PC. :(
---
Please do not use that guide. It's old and the Engine.ini is wholly unnecessary to achieve this.
---
Head to AppData\Local\DeadByDaylight\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor and open the GameUserSettings.ini in a notepad.
---
Set "bUseVSync=False" and "FrameRateLimit=1000.000000".
---
That's all you need to do. Note that this is basically uncapped framerate. Setting FrameRateLimit=0 does not work, as it will be locked at around 62fps engine-side.

Wtf, this is why we can't have fun anymore

Took a while though don‚Äôt it? Didn‚Äôt know the entity liked its hope well done.

I suppose they could, might have to make it where they can't pick them up/hook them at all.
---
Im crying this is hilarious I WANT HER
---
Common glitch
---
I was wondering what was happening to my points lol. After I complete an action, I always check the side to see my points gained and gens stopped giving them to me and I was pretty confused. Good to know it‚Äôs not just me!
---
That looks amazing
---
first off. Love your tag. But i bet it would take longer than 2 weeks. Look at legion. LOL. Also, yea.... i love meme builds, but piping matters if i want more of a challenge tho sometimes, i get purps or reds while im in yellows and greens? if that makes sense
---
I wasn‚Äôt expecting the rest of those photos but I‚Äôm not even mad
---
The last person usually isn't suposed to have a free escape, because the survivors failed. The hatch isn't supposed to be fair, its tilted for killers winning because the killer won the match. The purpose of the hatch is giving the survivor a motivation to continue the game, so its a race to see who find the hatch first, if he camps the hatch you should do gens. Get all the gens needed to 99 and them pop them up to open the doors. You'll get more points that way.
---
I dont think it's well done, if anything it should be in larger than usual quantity. Fattened with hope, maybe?
---
Mi comida el cerda
---
How'd they all know where the hatch would spawn at if no gens were completed?
---
I'm putting on this cosmetic with Insidious so I can role play as a tree.
---
And you just ignored my point too. Totems are an objective. If NOED procs then the survivors failed to do their objective and they get punished for it.
---
Trashy. I get mad all the time I just dont badger people anymore. Chances are someone was probably not.trying to be toxic. Except for those p3 claudettes last might they meant it.
---
Thank you.
---
Depends on the Freddy. IMHO he's kinda shit for tunneling. Remember people WILL hook dive against him because of the sleep transition. 
---
I do try and tunnel (Especially my dying light black box shroud of separation build, which HINGES on the obsession ragequitting or suiciding on hook) but you usually sleep the guy running to the hook first, and then the unhooked person meaning the unhooker is vulnerable first. 
---
In terms of chasing if a Freddy is "Benny Hilling" you at all times that's a shit way to play him. I find Freddy plays most effectively as a side-grade to doctor, trying to keep everyone asleep and often breaking chase to sleep more people (Remember, there's both the action speed slowdown + you see their aura so you can leave them for later) etc. opposed to just sleeping one person at a time and chasing that one person until they are dead on hook while gens get rushed.
---
I didnt, that's why I said one of the objectives. You still haven't responded to one of my points, or the fact that no-ed activating results in the killer failing both of their objectives, where it punishes the survivor for failing one but succeeding in the other. It's a crutch perk that is unfair for anyone outside of a 4 man SWF
---
Also that play was hilarious! Some people are such dicks they can‚Äôt recognize when they are currently a part of greatness.
---
No clue, all I know was right after the last DC they got away seconds later.
---
I'd say a rank off of each other isnt too bad. Being rank 13 and 12 could easily just be one game going well or poorly. I'd be fine with 2 even honestly. 
---
I'm rank 11 killer and getting matched with 9s isnt that bad but when I see a fucking 6 and a 5 with a 12 I just tunnel the 12 and get ready for the salty messages from all 3 of em
---
And I'm 14 Survivor so getting a 12 killer wouldn't bother me as much as facing a 10 or lower

This is really cute, hope you keep making art and posting in this sub :)
---
*sniff* if you don‚Äôt give back the box I‚Äôm telling mom
---
Me too
---
How are you supposed to win against Blood warden now? I'm not quite understanding how this is possible.
---
Nurse is free too
---
Nyaa~ *violent stabbing*
---
I honestly don‚Äôt hate him anymore. He‚Äôs not annoying as hell to play against and he‚Äôs not necessarily that bad of a killer. I‚Äôd say the only problem he has is the power is pretty basic now since your only choice is to down by chasing. Deep wounds realistically will never down anyone now except for maybe a brand new player who ignores the mend prompt.
---
Great concept bro.. how cool is it to see granny running vaulting and everything haha
---
Legion feels like ass now for me I just don't see the point of using his ability when you're 115 speed which makes him an m1 killer for me don't see the point of dcing against him now unlike his older version which was annoying.
---
So like 2 weeks ago I came back to the game after a two month break. I‚Äôve been playing a good bit of both killer and survivor, and I also achievement hunt in this game. Before the EGC update hit, I made 9 out of 15 progress with the Devoted Gatekeeping achievement. After the EGC update, the 4ks I‚Äôve gotten are all with me closing the hatch. When you close the hatch, the  EGC starts, but the remaining generators don‚Äôt get finished, the patch notes said they get covered by the Entity or something. The Devoted Gatekeeping achievement says sacrifice all 4 survivors before all the gens are completed, which I‚Äôve been doing, but after the collapse starts. Will I have to kill the last survivor without closing the hatch, or is it supposed to work with the collapse, and it just doesn‚Äôt? Sorry for the whole ass essay by the way lol
---
Look up advanced tutorials. Regular ones dont teach you how to really loop. I can link you some good ones if you want.
---
#THATSASAVE
---
[Uh...](https://i.redd.it/eqtkr73uq9x21.jpg)
---
Yeah I went overboard people like that get my blood pressure too high sometimes
---
I just finished leveling him and I got 1 kill on my first game with him
---
RIP eardrums indeed
---
Because of end game collapse, no matter how many gens are done, the hatch will always appear. No matter what.
---
Rewarded the person who got away
---
It means like, relatable. Like I felt it.
---
The joke is more that Mathew Lillard played Stu who was one of the killers in the first. The fact that it's possible makes the old meme relevant.
---
I had 4 games where there was a dc, 2 of them being full lobby dc.
---
Im starting to think Legion isn‚Äôt as bad as people meme him to be, if people are actually leaving because of Legion it‚Äôs probably because they know they don‚Äôt like dealing with him/her.
---
If you dc at that start of a match you are a dick and need to be punished. I do dc sometimes. Like if I get farmed off a hook or face camped but still waste the killers time as much as a can and it's only done for super unfair situations. If they did more so I wouldn't have a match that was just me on a hook I wouldn't do it at all.
---
It's a code glitch. Should be an easy fix since it was working before.
---
The point of endgame collapse is you now are forced to choose. You can no longer always save them.
---
Same  now i don ' t reply to this type of messages anymore because the next ban will be permanent for me lol
---
Same thing for me :&lt;
---
So this one group of assholes ruins the whole thing?
---
So basically before they could interrupt the animation and grab you. And now they can stomp the hatch and down you. I'm not seeing a big difference here? Did you think them being able to grab you before was unfair?
---
Multiple groups of assholes, happened again, only this time I didn‚Äôt get the messages post game. They have given people an easy work around to actually playing the game.
---
Gamer wife
---
The developers said that killers have to be a humanoid looking creature so sorry to say it but the chopping mall robots along with the evil bong can‚Äôt come in. Also seriously skull trooper üò∂
---
They kind of wasted away the entire end game collapse timer. Blood Warden is only 1/4 (if hooked) or 1/2 (if saved) of the timer, so they really had a lot of time to leave beforehand, and sealed their fate by going for the save with so little time left.
---
Plague without her crown would be cool in my opinion.
---
Yeah they would have to make some facial expressions like they did with the nurse cosmetic.
---
&lt;3
---
yes?
---
I'm always Quentin when I play against him and 9 times out of ten I'm tunelled to death and I am always hooked first. I just find it amusing though.
---
Have you tried playing as him to understand him a bit better ? I mean, his weird hit range you cannot fix, but it may help in figuring out his weaknesses. I know the rework is due soon but I'm doing this, myself.
---
Someone always has to be a obsession even if no one has obsession perks. It could have been that or like the others said ds.
---
He doesn't... But nice work
---
No
---
Totems arent an objective thats my issue with them. They are just a timewaste currently unless the killer has noed. They need to serve some actual purpose if they are gonna be an objective
---
blood warden really pays off
---
Ah thanks. Yeah I actually had to stop myself. My body went on autopilot and tried to DC lol
---
Why is hag there? There's nothing on her face
---
i mean, go off
---
Good, because if a survivor finds it first it's a free escape.
---
I mean this has nothing to do with endgame collapse
---
is it not
---
So satisfing.
---
fair enough. I still wouldn't call Legion's power "hindering" tho
---
I main feng and im crying tears of the sad. Summon the booney.
---
What about TR-3-VOR?
---
Rip bbqc
---
Yeah. One of the addons says it 'decreases Shrouded Hunt Depletion rate when spotted'. Plus in [this footage at 9:50](https://youtu.be/1WFlMkkpBOo?t=589) You can see that the stealth bar doesn't drain while The Ghost is behind the wall, it only starts draining when Dwight turns around.
---
In most of the gameplay floating around the survivor is watching ghostface the whole time, so it looks like his stealth just drains in 5 seconds every time.
---
Wasn't there something about Huntress hatchet headshot in the PTB?
---
spine chill doesn't only help you with hide and seek
---
spine chill helps you counter many killer's powers and gives you a fucktone of information, even in chases
---
Someone has stolen my brand :(
---
but its also good so good job
---
Great list! Personally I would add (perhaps to a higher level tier list but this is still applicable to beginner play) something about gen loops and keeping track of which ones are left; perhaps even allowing certain gens to be activated (while making progress by downing survivors of course) in order to create a tight 3-gen loop for the last gen that allows you to easily trap the remaining survivors.
---
Her story does say that she is in a new life as the Pig. So Idk.
---
I mean if i dont see anyone on bbq i would patrol the hook too, to see if anyone is around.
---
DS makes makes it so a random survivor is an obsession when no other obsession perks are being used
---
That has nothing to do with the collapse though that was a complety unrelated change. And it always appered before.
---
Is anyone else having severe lag issues on PC? I am about 350-400 ping every game I join. Internet is fine. I'm 30 down/up. No idea what to do
---
Maybe. I think her story does hint at that being the case.
---
The Collapse update made it so people don‚Äôt need to do gens for hatch to spawn
---
i don‚Äôt prestige killers because the rare addon bonus is basically nothing and i don‚Äôt care about the bloody cosmetics, but i might prestige ghostface because the bloody cosmetic looks so cool
---
why not? The reddit is filled with legion's post so why can't the clown get love too?
---
ye, it is. Why would you run away if its obvious someone is around?
---
This community has people so scared to be called a camper lol. Like yeah, if the survivors are camping hook, go ahead and fake walking away to bait them out or search the area for an easy hit/down, but you don't need to come up with a different word for it. Its so sad lol. You don't need to apologize for playing the goddamn game.
---
Wow dam you're right. I didn't even realize there was a double skip. Well never mind then that throws the whole thing out of consistency.
---
Why would you want to go higher than 60 fps? You almost never get lag spikes and 60 fps is I think the highest the eye can see or something idk
---
He also deleted that tweet (I couldn't find it when I looked), so it may have been wrong. They also called solo Ash a chapter. He's not in his Scream outfit. There was also no hint of a survivor or map in the files. So, more than likely we won't be getting them. I mean, I will be glad if we do, but it's not looking like it.
---
Lmao complaining about ruin is ridiculous, you get it almost every game after u hit mid-ranks
---
Moar!
---
I used to do it, but now not seeing anyone means that they most likely went into lockers
---
Wazzzzuuup
---
He did give it to the sequel though.
---
Adrenaline is the opposite of NOED, but not the counter.
---
I keep getting error code: 8,013 whenever I try to log-in on PC. 
---
It's telling me that it "Cannot connect to online services. Please try again later."
---
Is anyone else having this problem? Is there a solution? It just started happening without warning for me. I've tried restarting and verifying my game files, but it still doesn't work.
---
Same and keep getting disconnected
---
its unfair by the Survivor that unhooked you. 
---
The Killer has absolutely no fault.
---
The best one yet, easily.
---
That's happened to me the past couple of weeks. Are you level 20 with that killer? What's your rank?
---
This game could definitely do with some optional arcade modes. Unfortunately, the player base isn't quite big enough to really make them viable. You'd have to have a pre-built group, or just a super long wait for the lobby. And even then, you'd still be draining people from the main game mode, making those lobbies take even longer.
---
All that said, I'd love to see this.
---
I‚Äôve been called a tunneling cunt wad for taking shortcuts and just happening upon the injured survivor.
---
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
so... what's your point again?
---
I played killer a lot and it never happend to me. everything I've seen was survivors complaining about hatch being closed, never saw a killer complaining about the EGC (other than the fact that you HAVE TO slug for a 4k now)
---
Shirtless ghostface when?
---
Death Metal Huntress and Leather Piggy are instant buys from me.
---
I actually really like that add on, I don‚Äôt use the trap immediately, if anything I use it to put pressure on an annoying survivor half the time. I don‚Äôt feel the need to have more traps when playing Amanda with that add on, I feel like it‚Äôs a fairly decent add on in itself.
---
It makes sense from a lore perspective though.  The Survivors didn't really "lose" hope, they actually maintained it that whole time.  So when the Entity has to forcibly step in to kill them itself, it doesn't get that same effect it would if the Killer had sacrificed them. 
---
It's like the Entity basically puts 4 Survivors + 1 Killer on a game board and expects the game to play out various ways.  If the Killer is taking too long to kill the Survivors and the Survivors aren't leaving after the gates are powered within a certain time frame, the Entity gets bored and wipes the board clean because the Survivors haven't lost hope and the Killer hasn't done a good enough job.
---
earned my upvote for actually landing hex skillchecks
---
exactly what i‚Äôm thinking!
---
I have a 144hz monitor, so I can see 144fps
---
I played no perk legion before the update and I still do whenever I decide to play legion, he‚Äôs fairly easy imo especially against bad survivors
---
The moment you buy this set **WHOOP WHOOP thats the sound of da police**
---
Hag might seem lame on the surface but is surprisingly very good at what she does. She is a lot of fun and I recommend playing her if you get a chance.
---
They were actually laughing along after.  I had a really good run of non-toxic survivors that night.
---
Yeah, this wasn't the original text haha, it was added in later as a twitch streamer reference.
---
As a Feng main, TAKE MY MONEY
---
The killer is accountable for their own actions. I play killer just as much as survivor and if i see a farm I punish the person who did it. I can understand it happening once maybe or if they didnt know any better but for the killer to hook the same person in 3 times in 2 minutes that's just a dick move. It's also intentional with some killers. If I go for the unhook and all of a sudden we hear the terror radius start and the killer shows back up I can wedge myself between me and the person and have killers literally hit me and walk around me to rehook that person. Even if I offer myself up it doesnt always matter that's the problem. I'm not extreme with the opinion. Tunneling is going to happen but hard tunneling isnt fair play if that makes any sense.
---
What's really going on, then? To me, this looks pretty close to whitewashing. Claudette's skin is a lot darker than this.
---
Curious to know what you play on and what rank you sit at. 
---
Can it change the outcome of a game, yes. But it can be countered. If you see a bad killer, most people I see do the totems.
---
NOED is punishing survivors for pushing through gens hard. (Especially in SWF) It is balance. The balance may not be great, but that is on the Devs for not giving great secondary objectives.
---
I suggested using one of the exhaustion perks (that could be used this way) to get some distance already instead of waiting for the killer to come near you
---
Yea, if you play survivor only you spend 2h to sometimes get 1 full bloodweb if you run into campers few games and get like 3k points.
---
As a killer it's a bit easier, as you can do shit and still get 15k a game, and if you do well, it's 25k-30k a game.
---
But with all the perks which now exists, damn it's hard to keep up. I had 500 hours on steam, and wanted to have 4 survivors with all perks, to have different builds for each survivor, and few killers maxed, without prestiging any of them. 500 hours, still didn't had all the perks unlocked. It's ridiculously bad.
---
Yeah, me neither, hence why I play and consume all games / media in English, if possible :D
---
yeah, you got into my lobby earlier and I insta-dodged
---
More like source of plagiarism
---
https://nm.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bn5qpz/if_i_were_me_how_would_i_stealth_thissfm/
---
So basically you can loop if you have a extra hit but not without it?
---
Killers shouldn't get rating from having to rely on the Entity to save the game for them at the final second.  They weren't kills that the Killer would otherwise get.
---
No need to apologize just saying you're trash if you use it. I ain't your mommy or daddy so you gonna do whatever the fuck you want kid.
---
I honestly never really hated Legion except for Infinite Mend Legion. I hate playing against Doctor more because of all of the skillcheck builds and madness ruin skillchecks being hell.
---
7.8/10 too much void
---
everybody loves you in this game
---
The killer power is so broken. Oof. The 2nd perk is a cool idea but again overpowered by what it can disable for survivors.
---
Also works on Legion Bro.
---
An objective of the survivors isnt to avoid getting hit. It's to complete gens. Remember me rewards the killer for hitting people. Blood warden rewards a killer for hooking someone. No-ed rewards the killer for not stopping fen progress and not killing survivors quickly. Adrenaline awards you when you manage to complete all 5 objectives. As I said, avoiding being hit isnt an objective of the game. Its actually recommended to take hits at the beginning of a chase. Mettle of man is insanely overpowered, hence why it wasn't the topic of discussion, Adrenaline was.
---
Especially since her only genuinely good perk (surveillance is ok, but doesn't do anything in a chase) is one designed to apply exposed
---
"No one escaped" and "Entity Displeased" should never be in the same picture.
---
Baphometüëèüëè
---
What, creating my own photo based on a film's scene for purely creative purposes is plagiarism?
---
Just because I made mine a day later doesn't mean I copied someone else's post, bud.
---
Is there even another team? Pretty sure Myers mori'd all of these teenagers ages ago.
---
Graduation cap has been in the game for a while though. And that Sidney Prescott could easily be photoshopped because noone else has come forward saying they got that to pop up too.
---
If they kill themself on the first hook it is.
---
Agree with the last point. Hopefully they see it and address/change accordingly. Really like them now though and not having everyone DC when I play them is nice.
---
I've started playing wraith again this week, and I've gotten more toxicity than I have in months. Apparently survivors have now decided that even Wraith is OP. Did you know that finding someone on a gen and bing-bonging right on top of them is the same thing as camping?
---
Eh, you'll live.
---
Yes I am.
---
Yeah badly xD
---
I guess that makes perfect sense.
---
Gotta love the dbd community
---
You cant compare the 2. They're totally different... 
---
One rewards you for doing your job and one rewards for sucking..
---
Bug 1:
---
PC
---
Menu, I guess? 
---
Description: I randomly gain pips and levels with no reasonable explanation. I'm not disconnecting. Nothing else changes or messes up, but I randomly gain anywhere from 1 extra pip to 2 extra levels. 
---
I cannot reproduce it at will. It occurs most often after a match completes, but it happens occasionally upon starting the game. It often occurs multiple times per play session.
---
Again, this is different than the previous disconnect rank bug. I'm not disconnecting. 
---
Windows 10 64, all drivers are up to date, i5-7400, RX580 8GB, MX500 SSD, 16GB DDR4 3000
---
This has been happening for awhile now and is still occurring. 
---
Bug 2:
---
In game, I guess? 
---
Description: Objective points are not scoring correctly. Example: I did 2 gens solo and 1 co-op gen. That's 3 gens from 0-100 and finished the match with 2558 objective points. Not even factoring skill checks, co-op, or the part of the door I did, the final count should be at least 3750.
---
I can't reproduce it at will. It happens at random.
---
This started happening after the most recent update. 
---
Bug 3:
---
In game
---
Description: Resilience is not working. 
---
I cannot reproduce it at will, but it does occur about 30-50% of the matches I use the perk.
---
Sorta?
---
According to the posters there, that file is new.
---
As for the Sydney Prescott thing, a couple of people claimed they experienced the same thing with Ash before he came out.
---
But yeah, both could be fake :(
---
Don't tryhard and you have a good time. If you want to 4k every game, yea, you gonna have a bad time, 50% of the time at least few buggers will escape. But if you play relaxed, have some fun with survivors, make some stupid builds, enjoy the game. You don't play to stress yourself out, you play to relax from a real world.
---
Don‚Äôt think so. I had one last night. Took me three games. The first one I‚Äôm pretty sure I completed at least a generator and a half. Second game I finished one for sure and co-opped on one and a half. The daily progress was at 99% with 2/3 completed.
---
Good news: they reverted the locker search "bug fix" when they realized how stupid it was.
---
Noed on a rank 5 nurse?  Hmmmm
---
You may need to replace that ritual...
---
No wonder I didin't get the fucking Lightbringer emblem when I did several gens on my own. I thought it was weird how it was substantially more difficult to pip in purple and red ranks lately.
---
I especially love the cookies.
---
You mean to tell me that isn't Nea?
---
Spine chill might be the single best perk in the game outside of against t1 Michael.
---
However, I have seen a lot of survivors use it poorly and be way too cautious as a result.
---
Imo Freddy needs one thing, in a match with him all survivors start in the dream world. Lower the penality for actions and rework his Power.
---
No they downvoted because they don't agree with you, that's the whole point at upvoting and downvoting. So oh no you lost 4 not excisting points on the internet I am very sorry for that!
---
Each side kind has crutch perks or as i like to say optimal perks. So Self care, Exhaustion perk besides sprint burst, MoM or Borrowed time or both, and adrenaline. And killer is ruin, bbq and chili, sloppy butcher and i prefer an end game perk. So yeah we both have crutches.
---
point is that they shouldn't be able to interrupt the escape at all now that they can close the hatch. Did I think it was unfair before? No. but now that they can close hatch,who ever gets their animation first should win the standoff
---
Dude, if your internet is so bad that you get DCed often enough for the penalties to become actually severe, you probably shouldn't be playing this game anyway. You can play other games where a DC doesn't completely ruin a match, but this one specifically is just placing your own fun over four other peoples'.
---
So yeah, penalize all DCs. I don't care if I get mistakenly hit occasionally. If my internet's not stable, I should take a break.
---
In one of Paulies videos he mentioned the cap popped up in the files when the spirit was released. Apparently it was for a teacher killer that got scrapped, or I think that's what people were thinking. I'm on console so I can't confirm anything about the files.
---
I mean I hate to just bash it like "no we're not getting it" but I'd rather say we're not getting them, then be hype for a full chapter, then we not get anything but the killer.
---
Then the killer dc
---
I feel like I am among the only people who wish Rule 34 wasn't a thing.
---
so after a nurse game, i gave a person hatch because i felt bad. Basically i played nurse after seeing a player who was super toxic and just T-bagged me 2 games ago when i was going my daily, i had no time to change my perks and noed was on there last time for some reason (this is important). Now after the game they spammed "noed" in chat and then "ruin noed" and we went into a talk about crutch perks. As you can see they are only running the most meta perks. They went off on how i was bad because i used meta perks, and i responded by saying they use meta perks, then they basically just said how i am wrong because i'm defending my perks. 
---
They then go on to say that line, explaining how he defined crutch perks as "a perk that can singlehandedly  win a game". Going off this definition alone, he proves him self wrong, all the best killer perks are HEX perks that can be found, and the ones that are not are supporting perks. I genuinely feel like this person is wrong, and since he DCed after saying that, would like someone to explain his side as to understand better.
---
I'm getting some major darkwood vibes right here.
---
r/unexpecteddestiny
---
Yeah but not as long as before
---
well it would've helped if you uploaded the scoreboard... also, every hook gives you 2% and every sacrifice gives you 20%, so you should have at least 88% there
---
I find myself shaking/twitching in anticipation of all the fun, annoyances, adrenaline rushes and frustration.
---
Playing as Killer is anxiety inducing for me lmao
---
I like how he looks behind him briefly while they‚Äôre being sacrificed as if to say ‚Äúis anyone else seeing this shit?‚Äù
---
I know what up- and downvotes are for but still people disagreed so they downvoted.
---
Oh, fair enough. In that case, it could be reused for Ghost face then.
---
Same, and it‚Äôs always people who BM and run crutch perks
---
Exactly. Thought your point was that you don¬¥t like if killers slug survivours and don¬¥t end the game by hooking them just to see the animation or something
---
I just let myself De-Rank. Let myself go all the way back to 20 and then learn a new Killer. Ranks really dont mean much since there is still no rewards for ranking up. Might as well just drop rank and have fun with a new killer without being stomped.
---
I love it when this meme is executed correctly
---
Same thing in the other thread from last week.. You gotta stall gens. If you don't kick a gen you don't get points.
---
They can just slug them then.
---
I'd love a concede option. No reason to stretch the match out any further than it needs to. Though you know some survivors would refuse to use it, and then blame the killer for wasting their time. Or use it and then blame the killer for breaking their personal rules.

Bald head cosmetic for the Hag would really go well since you can see her bald on her body cosmetic item! I would love to see her bald with all those vines on her head!

Seriously, how many Claudettes have we had run straight to us resulting in us getting hit with a Chainsaw, Hatchet, Nurse Blink, etc.?
---
Dwight isn't a twink but yes, I want a shirtless Dwight cosmetic.
---
Thank you for that far hook. I never see anyone bother to take the two seconds to get over there, despite it being able to save the entire match for you.

Yeah I fear that as well but a maskless option for original killers would still be great imo.

Press F, gamers
---
That's also what people are speculating, cause of the college in the second movie. Even though the first had a high school, so not sure why people are jumping to the college but idk.
---
So she could take it off, but it's not a mask, then?
---
I don't know why I didn't think to screenshot any other of the endgame screens. This was a few days ago just now got it uploaded
---
So cause some troll before allow you to be a troll too cause the game can let you do that ? what a point...
---
Her damn smile is really creepy. I'm not a big fan of masks in general, I'd rather see her evil grin!
---
She has the mindset of a child so idk if she would know what demonic symbols mean
---
Let's assume that maychmaking is good though (ik it never is but bear with me) a good killer will force a team to play well and do gens quickly or die meaning they have no time to do unlit totems. While you can do unlit totems against a bad killer unless you are SWF it is sometimes a waste of time. 
---
I'm glad we agree that perk balancing is stupid but I dont think Spine Chill and BL are in the same league as NOED. Spine Chill doesnt give you a direction and BL still means you have more of a stun than the killer and is very situational on the map and where you're being chased. NOED isn't situational it will always happen unless u get a chance to do all the unlit totems which again is boring, time wasting and sometimes pointless if they aren't using NOED.
---
I can't think of many times I've missed a swing because of exhaustion perks (apart from DH) because its usually easy to predict when someone if going to use one. e.g. Meg sneaking around right infront of me = Sprint burst. Running up a hill = BL... What those perks achieve is an extended chase which is what they're for. 
---
NOED isn't telegraphed to the survivors until one gets insta-downed (which sucks when it happens btw). Yes the game has other problems but in my opinion atm this is the biggest.
---
Ok I hard disagree with your rework idea but yeah Freddy isn't bad at all. I put him smack in the middle of the tier list.
---
yeah... 2min of waiting for bullshit is actually a great way out of this hell of waiting... thx
---
Look. There is always gonna be trolls. But what is better? A 3 minute timer that survs or killers can abuse, or an unspecified amount of time where only survs can troll?
---
Look at Wraith, just standing there, menacingly to the right.
---
1. Don't waste time trying to get the trap off unless it is active, do gens. [Unless case 2]
---
2. Try to get the trap off if the Pig is already chasing another survivor. Jigsaw boxes have a very short time to search through.
---
3. Pallet loops are not safe against a really good Pig who can mind game. Window vaults are better.
---
On my own walking down the only road I've ever known......
---
Yeah im in the same boat. I have to wait 5-10 mins for a game as any killer I have. I assume it's because there isn't a lot of survivors at level 20.
---
Getting to 90% loaded then nothing. Have to go to task manager to exit the game and restart. Lose my offering. Sad.
---
Black robes look mighty silly and would cause laughter rather than slight fear.
---
yea but having 2 perks as the things you look foward to and knowing that "the entity will start taking its shit from one of those" makes bloodwebing fun. later it's like "I'm gonna take some shit and some's going to be locked"
---
That's how it is in the original though. Going for that grim reaper look I guess.
---
Jesus, nurse with noed is the most crutch combo I can think of.
---
I can't remember if anyone DCd or not. I dont think so, but I might be wrong.
---
I have that, but with the Huntress' lullaby.
---
Blood Warden needs to be nerfed hard... 60 seconds is too long now that the end game is 2 minutes only...
---
Should be 30 seconds. Cut it in half.
---
At the rates survivors call pretty much any perk a "crutch" while simultaneously running all the second chance perks I'm surprised it means anything anymore.
---
yes, that's correct, but this kind of progression system is something that keeps me in games
---
I'd want everything completed and having a goal of getting all the perks on all killers is something that gives me a reason to play when the game's in a bad spot
---
Uhhh, you can for sure see the difference of 60fps to 144fps. Don't believe everything you read about fps. You can for sure tell the difference.
---
This appears to be the point at which the game awaits other people to finish loading. That really ought to be communicated to the user!
---
I'm not. just giving an example, because many killers can do nothing about it. it's the same as survivors complaining about BBQ when most killers use it for points and don't care about the aura reading thing
---
No, you can't. Whoever told you that is an idiot.
---
If there isn't a duration than the switch between dream world and awake would have to be instant, which is where we are right now. Survivors are barely ever in the dream state for over a minute anyway, and this would require them to either fail two skill checks before coming put of it, one skill check and still being in it for 30 seconds, or spending the entire minute in the dream world. The point is to just limit the RNG inherent to his ability.

Farm the killer ones... Hatchet throws, Myers stalk and Wraith hitting survivors out of cloak are all really easy to perform. Also, don't buy every DLC otherwise you'll be forced to do dailies as killers / survivors you don't want to play with. Delete Nurse Blinks if it pops up.
---
I kept it simple and bought Myers + Laurie, fuck the rest. These trash developers aren't getting my $ for a game they keep shitting all over.
---
The biggest issue is 3rd party coms. Hands down.  Period. Unfair to killers and single survivors. Gives WAY too many free perks and a huge advantage. However, when people play with friends, why would you not want to talk to them? The game does not want to acknowledge SWF coms, but has Fog Whispers that use it all the time. They really need to incorporate coms or some other better communication for all survivors then balance around that. 
---
And Spine Chill and BL are VERY OP if used correctly. Spine Chill is powerful enough to prevent getting hit by the nurse, wraith, spirit, or pig. It tells you when it is safe to stay or to get off a gen and hide when a heartbeat is heard or if the killer is coming in your direction. It tells you which direction the killer is looking in a chase to escape them (when you turn a corner and it goes away). Balanced landing stops the stun after a landing even in exhaustion. Those can be used all game to stay safe. I do it all the time. 
---
NOED adds a minor scare to the game. It makes a survivor fear the killer, even if a little bit. There are many more issues that need fixed prior to a preventable NOED.
---
&gt;how can you get around that?
---
Just fucking leave while you can
---
Same, but I guess im interested in the way things get translated \^\^
---
I like this, it‚Äôs a really inventive way of keeping the game fresh.
---
thanks. but there should be more art of him. instead of only the legion
---
What exactly do you disagree with? Survivors are barely ever in the dream state for over a minute anyway, and this would require them to either fail two skill checks before coming put of it, one skill check and still being in it for 30 seconds, or spending the entire minute in the dream world. It would reduce his relience on RNG, while still retaining the need for survivors to fail skill checks.
---
I‚Äôd love to see one with Billy and Bubba. Or better yet, Trapper and Jason. Oh. Wait...
---
It's just meant to be a fun add on, not every ultra rare has to be God tier. Look at legion and wraith, both of them have ultra Rares that just show you gen progression, that's it. Or Freddy's black box.
---
Play how you like my dude.

\*When you play without ruin
---
If you know Blood Warden is a perk and get yourself killed because you decided to stay within the last minute of the Collapse so you can get your save points, the word greedy very much applies.
---
If you camp or tunnel in anyway you‚Äôre trash plain and simple. It‚Äôs the same as teabagging at the exit gates or after you hit the killer with a pallet you‚Äôre grade A trash.
---
Either one works.
---
fair enough
---
I 100% agree. Hopefully the head will fit well with a different body piece.

You would never get banned for changing fps. You edit the game USER file, it's a file the user can edit for vsync, auto levels, sensitivity ect. And even in the slim slim slim chance it banned you, like the guy said above me, eac will remove the ban if you message them.
---
Player experience is a HUGE part of the DC epidemic. 
---
There's numerous things that happen in this game on both sides that either BHVR created with a new perk, buff, killer, item or the community created by not thinking about the fact there are 5 humans in every given match and being shitheads or playing in unfair ways. 
---
The game is fundamentally designed or played in a way that often your objective is boring (generators are slow/plus Ruin heavy Meta, survivors are stealthing and giving you no chases), or frustrating (killer tunnels you off hook/camps your face first hook, survivor has MoM, Adrenaline/Instaheal).
---
I honestly don't think you can fix it. The game will die on this hill because people either refuse to be nice to one another or BHVR instead of addressing serious issues will continue to release annoying band aid fixes in the form of perks or new killer powers.
---
I'm married so I'm not in culture enough to know more than twink, hunk, and bear. :'(

Wazuuuuuuuuuuuuup

I have never really cared about Warframe to begin with, with or without the grind. The NPE for that game is awful and once you learn to ninja slide, you can breeze through most of the beginning missions in a fraction of the expected completion time only for the later missions with different objectives to be a huge wall by comparison, and even then I didn't really feel all that challenged or enthused. Mindlessly grinding for hours in Warframe never tickled my fancy I guess. Only games I grinded for hours would be old RPGs.
---
But again, if you are only playing a game to grind unlocks, that is not really a testament to the game's quality. I remember playing old shooters on consoles [that had little to no unlocks] for THOUSANDS of hours, because they were fun. My time spent playing Halo, Call of Duty, Gears of War, Medal of Honor, Rainbow Six, etc. were all spent playing the game to have fun, not grind for 300 hours for more premium currency.
---
I eat ass.
---
This is what I hate, I get hooked near a team mate and  they decide to crouch around near the hook when the Killer clearly has no intentions to leave. The Killer now halting at least 2 person which is amazing if you ask me. Instead of getting  a free gen or two and pressuring the Killer to leave they rather  wait out almost the full hook phase and get into a chase right away after unhooking me, or the Killer deletes me from the game and now it's a X-1 vs 1 and an actively gen patrolling Killer, gj. I'm always baffled how they don't get that this game is all about time management.
---
The only time you'll be in the wrong (not *morally* wrong or anything, just not as efficient as possible) for doing that is if you're doing it incorrectly. If you camp too closely, you can guarantee a grab interrupt on the rescuer's unhook, cancelling it and immediately downing them. If you camp that close and they see you doing it, you're not actually baiting them out b/c they know its suicide (the only time they might take that offer is if they're running BT and want to die in the other surv's place). You need to pretend to leave to try and bait the unhook, to make them think its safe to go for it (especially if they don't have BT). Or search the area to try and find them camping nearby, waiting for their chance. If you just stand within grab distance of the hook, you're denying the survivors their altruism and survival points, denying yourself sacrifice points (if they get unhooked, you can hook them or their rescuer again for an additional hook bonus), and, perhaps more importantly, playing in a way that isn't very fun for either party.
---
He gon find another girl and he gon leave ya!
---
3 fellow wild cuties!
---
Like others said it's just endgame collapse. It's an extremely New concept that hasn't even been out for a couple weeks. You also missed the plague as a new killer and the hag. That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but I'm sure more survivors have been released that I can't remember the names of bc I don't like spending money for the DLCs lol
---
bhvr cleansed your flair
---
Haha, I don't hate Doctor mains at all, I just don't enjoy playing against him. That beautiful smile you guys have makes it impossible for me to have any malice towards you as players x)
---
I agree that‚Äôs the main thing I struggle with as a killer
---
because every game community needs a meme to hate. if it wasn't legion, it would be another killer.
---
Gen rushing and tunneling are, in my opinion, stupid terms. They're doing their objective.
---
The EGC is a brand new feature with an awesome new death animation. Of course some killers are gonna do this to get to see it up close. I think it's pretty likely that all but a very few players will move on from doing this after seeing it a bunch of times in these first few weeks
---
Ugh I just want to see her eyes. She is the only female killer without a face model.
---
We need shirtless cosmetics for all survivors, especially Adam
---
They should let us change the color of the scratch marks i have the same issue with red green.
---
Ever thought that maybe there are just some awful teammates who would actually message the killer once they die just to see you die as well?
---
It also doesn‚Äôt even look like her at all ;/ good art but it‚Äôs not really Claudette
---
This was questioned about in the player satisfaction survey if I recall correctly.  
---
I don't want to get your hopes up for nothing, so don't count on it, though.  
---
I wish there would be colorblind modes too.
---
On the occasion I play survivor, I think I have only faced another doctor twice. Seeing doc from another view made me appreciate what I put others through. I try not to run annoying builds that laser-focus on gen obstruction.
---
I've literally spawned on it.
---
I usually respond with 
---
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD
---
I agree and have said many times that this game is designed in a way such that no matter what someone leaves nearly infuriated.
---
I really wish F13 wasn't stuck in legal hell, it could have really given DBD a run for its money and incentivized better change when it came to objectives, variety, balance, etc. F13 I remember being much less frustrating and more dynamic, even a couple of patches made things really wonky haha
---
Either
---
A. Survivors died too soon on hook, not enough hooks
---
B. Genrushgenrushgenrush
---
C. You used a Mori, which usually doesn‚Äôt pip.
---
First off, beware that freddy is a weak killer so you might struggle with him, however, you can pick one of 2 perk builds:
---
1) The standard m1 killer build
---
Ruin
---
BBQ
---
Enduring
---
Spirit fury
---
This build is great for all m1 killers. Freddy eats pallets a lot so enduring and spirit fury really helps him. Disrespect every pallet and after breaking 2 you can get a free hit on someone. BBQ and ruin are obvious, bloodpoints are great, aura reading is helpful and ruin slowing the game down is fantastic especially for Freddy. Alternatively, you can use the end game freddy build :
---
A perk of your choice (preferably BBQ)
---
Noed
---
Blood warden
---
Freddy isn't a great killer, but one thing he's good at is the end game. Putting everyone to sleep at the end game and having noed makes it impossible for them to wake up, which makes all their actions 50% slower including exit gates opening. Knocking all of them down with noed and sleeping them gives you insane snowball potential. Blood warden is great combined with noed since you can block the gates and get a few more kills. You can even slug them then use blood warden to get them sacrificed by the entity. I would have told you to use remember me instead of bbq but it got nerfed and it's not that great anymore. 
---
Other good perk choices with freddy:
---
Monitor and Abuse (24 to 16 meter radius, makes survivors have little to no reaction time upon hearing your lullaby)
---
Make your choice (freddy sucks at camping, leave the hook then come back for the make your choice guy, he'll have a harder time hiding because of your low terror radius)
---
Brutal strength (freddy gets destroyed by pallets kick them in quicker fashion)
---
Save the best for last (freddy really benefits from this due to him having to hit every survivor to injure them, unlike other killers who have abilities to injure survivors)
---
Sloppy butcher (makes healing slower, especially with survivors in the dream world)
---
Knock out (freddy already has built in deerstalker, putting on knockout makes him really strong at slugging)
---
Freddy add ons recommendations:
---
Reduced dream transition add ons(the block add ons) 
---
Reduced skill checks in the dream world (green and blue dress) 
---
Pill bottle and class photo are insane) survivors don't see you in the dream transition, making you unpredictable and knowing where all survivors are while sleeping a survivor is great) 
---
Good luck in your future matches!
---
Fair enough, I misinterpreted there.
---
I saw earlier this week that somebody tested it and said it's only certain cosmetics that it isn't working on. Like the lab coat Claudette.
---
smh mh mh mh my head
---
Huntress is the only killer without a complete face.
---
During the 2x BP event, I ran into so many Docs [despite being in purple and red ranks] that I started grinding bloodwebs to unlock and use Calm Spirit lmao. And then I got to be tunneled every game afterwards :)
---
From the Wiki:
---
You also win points if you escape a chase without getting hit; the longer the chase, the higher the points. Every 15 seconds, you secure your points, however, you will only receive half of the points if you lose the chase.
---
And yes, you described how NOED works. It can be powerful. But so can other HEX perks. That is why they are tied to a Hex
---
NOED can be prevented in full, denying a perk slot. Again, it can be powerful. No one is saying otherwise. As a survivor, either do the totems or deal with the potential of NOED and get out ASAP. 
---
If you have a suggestion on how to make NOED better, suggest it. Here is one: NOED exposed only lasts 30/40/50 seconds.
---
Suffer through it, it was a pain for me believe me
---
I hear you on this ... but when they don‚Äôt, win or loos I tend to have fun playing.
---
I'd actually say that endgame collapse benefits survivors more unless the killer already knows where the last survivor is. You close the hatch and have to hope that they weren't near an exit gate or you're hosed anyway.
---
Well you said you're already in therapy so that covers my first line of advice. Have you brought up this specific issue in therapy? Because there's only really two trains of thoughts for this issue: address the underlying anxiety issue and either avoid the trigger (playing the game), or desensitization therapy (keep playing until the trigger stops). It sounds like you want to choose the latter, so all you can do is try to calm, ignore, or rationalize away those negative thoughts that pop up when you feel like DCing - a la cognitive behavioral therapy. 
---
So if being logical and thinking "hey, why am I getting mad at myself when no one is judging me and no one will even remember this game a couple hours from now?" helps, do that. If taking some deep breaths and visualizing something calming in your life helps, do that. If channeling your rage and getting indignant that some dick would put their SO through abuse over a video game of all things, and reminding yourself that you deserve better than that helps, do that. Because you do deserve better and no one should be beating themselves up over this game.
---
Also seconding finding a friend to play with, find someone who doesn't take the game super seriously and laughs off their mistakes and you'll be inclined to mirror that laid-back attitude eventually as well.
---
Nurse and huntress are always free, as for console hag and doctor are free because they are bundled in the special edition. Whereas PC have to buy them
---
yep
---
That's a sexy Blood Warden right there.
---
I disagree, their are some killers that can move from hatch to door to door in literal seconds to remove almost all chance of escape. And that‚Äôs not even counting in if the doors spawn directly across from one another or right next to each other. Which I‚Äôve had happen to me multiple times. So I was able to pace between both doors stopping the escape
---
The game would be x1000 times better with killer emotes and proxy VOIP
---
Lol
---
That Nea kinda deserved it. It is not that hard to just take a hit and get out. Either they escape or you get EW3 and it is gg. All they were doing is minimizing their chances to escape as a whole haha. Glad they were a good sport about it though.
---
This video represent my luck with such ruin placements.

Now I have an excuse for being blind!

---
Sure
---
I know his eyes are where the black patches are but the way those...eyebrows? Look make it look like he's slightly concerned.
---
And if you are a survivor who never did that and was against it because you don't enjoy wasting other people's time?
---
I'll probably stick to cat mask coz it's the cutest one she has ;w;
---
this is actually the reason the devs refuse to add colorblind mode.  they don‚Äôt want non colorblind people to get an advantage from the feature.
---
Lol heard that a couple days ago and looked it up it‚Äôs 1000
---
They don't like the new Legion either apparently
---
Its because pre patch legion had some mad bullshit survivors didnt enjoy playing against, so most people still dc, dont worry though you still benefit from their dcs and all they get is to keep their items, more or less when a survivor dcs you get the advantage
---
Ok so the first bit is literally just the top tier killers, Nurse, Billy and Spirit. Maybe hag if the survivor is an idiot and trapper could potentially get there in time if the trap rng is bad for the survivor. Don't even mention legion because their speed is pretty lacklustre now. Every other killer relies on the hatch being close to the exit gates AND the exit gates being close to eachother which very rarely happens.
---
On top of all that is the nerf to remember me (which wasn't even a good perk to begin with).
---
If I'm 100% honest the DbD community scares me lol, I never feel like I'm good enough to compete with anyone
---
Ho-ly shit
---
Skemooo, never stop. You're the best reason to come to this sub. Thank you so much for making these
---
Like Freddy.
---
Not getting any points has been happening to me a lot lately.
---
It's sad some people find this is a strategy AT ALL!
---
it's just a style of mine.

I'm guessing you just started playing this game?
---
I know that feeling man.. :(
---
The Shape just gave up and followed my ass for the rest of the game.
---
*When you play
---
atpHolUp
---
Yup.
---
Dammit, I thought we found Sidney's lol.
---
What the fuck are you even talking about?
---
this build doesn't elevate this trash level killer to any level
---
also, imagine changing PWYF into anything actually useful and running this build on billy. Much more deadly.
---
Agreed, but the boar axe will fit nicely with this
---
You don't owe these dipshits an explanation for a goddamn thing. Use whatever you want.
---
tl:dr - survivors are pussies - pussies all around me as I play.
---
ALL of those things happen to me and I never DC because I am not a fucking pussy.
---
Nut up and play the fucking game.
---
"Oh, I'm sorry, Milton Bradley: I flip the board on Monopoly because I always get bad Chance cards, go to jail, then someone else gets Boardwalk."
---
Everyone plays the same game.  Your "experience" is not more important than the people who aren't pussies.
---
You fucking limp-dicked pieces of shit.
---
Play it out.  DCing losers.  If you want to kill yourself on the hook, do that.  It's part of the game.
---
So sick of this line of thought.
---
Okay, but some of this actually sounds legit...The Fear power could be similar to the doctor, and flickering light could be badass, just not sure how it would work outside...
---
Heeeeey ya took his advice
---
Dude, don't be rude.
---
A man after our own hearts.
---
If I enjoy playing him, I will probably P3 him. I will P1 all Killers but only the ones I enjoy playing I P3.
---
Then if that‚Äôs the case why give the survivors the perk of borrowed time? Oh that‚Äôs right to stop killers from tunneling. I‚Äôm not talking about killing the survivors I‚Äôm talking about the people that blatantly take the game away from the survivors by tunneling and then bitch about borrowed time being a crutch perk
---
I never said your examples were fun either. I just said legion is (also) boring to play against. Or do you think that‚Äòs not the reason why people still don‚Äòt like him and dc against him?
---
Should you keep your items when you dc though? I can see good arguments for both side. But maybe people would be less incentivized to dc if they lost their shit.
---
Prayer Beads are somewhat debatable, cleansing all game is a thing all killers have and getting insta downed is cause you got outplayed or you fucked up, not being able to outrun a 100 and something killer for 10 seconds and then having to mend AND heal isn't fun. Personally don't hate the killer just saying your points aren't very good.
---
Is this against the rules? (Rule 3)
---
Shouldn't you put spoiler flair?
---
Did you report them?  That's disgusting behavior.
---
Tunneling definitely exists. There can be debate over it bring toxic or a fair strategy or whatever, but objectively 'tunneling' a survivor is definitely a way to play that a killer can do.
---
If I'm playing Myers and I have dying light on and I find my obsession and after hooking them I float loosely around the hook area and as soon as they're unhooked exclusively hunt down that obsession to rebook them and repeat again, I'm definitely tunneling the obsession. Is it the smartest play? Most likely, its all about getting Dying Light active. Is it accurately described as tunneling? Definitely.
---
Dont think of it as an insult or an inherently bad thing, it's simply describing a way the a killer can play
---
Have you done a render of Legacy Claudette??? this is so lovely.
---
I only DC to Legion twice, but only due to really bad lag and connection issues, game was unplayable on my end. Though, it has only happened with Legion. All the other killers, the matches are perfectly fine.
---
When shit players get fucked on, it's always gonna be your fault. 
---
And anyone who tells you to kill yourself over a video game should be the first to fellate a gun barrel.
---
This comment section really accurately reflects my solo queue experience of people using self-care and being effectively useless for roughly 2 minutes of every game. 
---
I don't understand why these people seem to be allergic to just running a med-kit.
---
Don‚Äôt start pls
---
I agree with you but, it also wouldnt be fair for people with bad internet, ive had my ps4 lose connection mid game a few times, and thats where the problem lies, its hard to tell sometimes, I just take the quiter bloodpoints and roll with it half the time
---
i don‚Äôt think it was that she felt lied to, but disappointed her mother didn‚Äôt accept her as her daughter and lied to remove Jane from her history.
---
If someone is hooked the timer slows by half tho
---
Pussies.
---
My original attempt a month or so ago was the most twisted and fucked up facial expression, lol
---
I'll give it another go as I do have better models now
---
legion was a low tier killer who could abuse chase mechanics to make it impossible to win a chase against them 
---
people didnt like this 
---
so legion got nerfed into being an even lower tier killer and these same people still quit cause they just were never good to begin with and preferred to blame legion
---
Lol ... toxic play aside, I was just thinking that. Most video game subs I post to or see are filled with people who just whine about nerfing a game to death because they suck at it. He ain‚Äôt wrong.
---
WE MADE THEM!
---
This isn‚Äôt a hatepost , I‚Äôm just laughing about his name lol. Especially since I browse this sub
---
Run ds!! Perfect for tunneling twats.
---
Well you aren‚Äôt crying, that I can see, so jokes on him
---
Except I wasn‚Äôt being toxic at all
---
Borrowed time is camping protection. It is a crutch, but it's a good crutch in a lot of ways.
---
Why have dying light that wanted you to kill a certain survivor?
---
Aw, I'm sorry to hear about your grandma. Here's hoping for the best.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with BBQ? I get NOED but BBQ is just a good perk
---
youre right but im still going to call you a cunt. cunt
---
Thank you for your cervix
---
Please do. I can't wait to see this dipshit's reaction.
---
To be fair we can‚Äôt say no survivor or map just because they do not seem to be in the dev build. By the looks of the dev build it‚Äôs very very early in stage of development and we have no idea how the devs work so they could always do killer first before even attempting to fuck with the other parts. They are not even fully done with scream by the looks of it either
---
it was kinda funny, though i'd almost always end up pressing it one too many times and have to go through a complete circle
---
I agree with you I have been playing billy today and EGC has gotten me more kills than I should be getting because I hook people at the end and they only have so much time to save them
---
Nobody bitches about dying light haha. It‚Äôs not meta, killers only complain about borrowed time because they can‚Äôt tunnel or camp. And it shows on the bottom right of the screen if the killer has dying light, again which nobody has ever complained about. You said it yourself it‚Äôs protecting the survivors from the camper tunnel killers
---
I have had matches where I had to wait so long until survivors left and you cry sbout 3 min? It‚Äôs revenge
---
No, if all you did was get hooked why should you pip? If that was the case everyone would always pip. Maybe try playing a little more stealthy and smarter instead of instantly found and hooked
---
it's time to come clean glen, i KNOW youre a billy main

I disagree with the tunneling part because sometimes the unhooked survivor was the only one I found am I just supposed to let them go? Like yeah if I‚Äôm picking between unhooker and just hooked I‚Äôll pick the guy who unhooked them
---
Haha thats amazing :) its nice you got to experience the other side of the game for a change. Its much better than the game my random teammates like to play. Its called DC roulette and pretty sure instead of a single bullet revolver they are using a double loaded shotgun.
---
Cool motive, still murder
---
It is especially good when coupled with the spirit.
---
This is my issue. Some how the high ranked survivors are getting there though. A majority of my matches are black pips and if it's a camper or a tunneler I get a minus 1 or 2 and I cant rank up playing like that. My main objective in the game isnt to farm more points it's to just do the gens I save people if I need to and that's about it. I have good chases here and there but if it's a tunnel I never have chance to actually try to pump out objectives. If too much pressure gets applied I have to drop what I'm doing to save people.
---
Happy cake day!!
---
se tonight
---
Try it atleast or fuck off mate with your trash ass negative message
---
It has been there as long as the outfit has. Although it only shows up when looking at the outfit as a whole, which used to be only something you could do in the Store before they added the outfit option to the customization menu.
---
Amazing homophone, and happy cake day!
---
No, you should add Brutal Strength, Enduring, and Spirit Fury. Nurse can't chase for shit. ^^^/s
---
Hmm good idea
---
twinks unite
---
I never DC but immediately after the patch, 9 out of the 10 matches I played against were all Legions. I just got sick and tired of playing against him.
---
That's an unexpected response. I would have hit back with "no u"
---
Same. I even tend to DC without any warning, while the internet is completely fine. Makes me feel like shit for my other teammates and the killer.
---
no. I think for a large Part that is due to the Community meme
---
WAAAAZZZZUUUUPPP
---
Over the last few weeks I've been playing more and I have noticed people dc'ing after getting downed without even being hooked. This shit honestly pisses me off because it leaves the rest of us at a disadvantage. I'm not the best player but since getting to rank 10+ it's gotten worse
---
Stop playing The Pig
---
They‚Äôre never going to stop shitty players from being shitty. I played 3 matches in a row and was face camped and lost pips, but got them back and then some within the hour.  
---
Survivors get penalized if we don‚Äôt go for the first two hooks, killers can see us when we heal, repair, run past crows etc ... it wouldn‚Äôt hurt them to penalize the killer via BP for camping when not in a chase. It‚Äôs what they done to survivors.
---
You can't.
---
Its judt calling killers. Going after the weakest link is not only smart, its encouraged.
---
I judt had someone message me that dying light was op.
---
Sounds great
---
For a second I thought it meant his username was gocry and I was like oh
---
I agree with you on that, that's just what I've noticed. Like if I do a full gen by myself using a tool box itll usually not give me a full gen for it
---
This is feng' s ballerina cosplay
---
no lol, if you could get banned for blocking to get the hit i doubt we'd ever see a wraith again
---
As for the perks...  
---
Bitter Murmur on Huntress is really fun, imo.
---
&gt; Slow ass motherfucking Jeff
---
MOVE YOUR ASS, DUDE!
---
me: why can‚Äôt you just be quiet?
---
feng: heeeeeaaaauuughhh
---
Thanks for doing jesus‚Äôs work
---
Thanks for drawing this beautiful piece of art
---
Upvoted for visibility, we need a quick fix on this one
---
Dying light sucks, if the obsession is good at the game you can pretty much guarantee that perk not activating. Also tunneling someone off the hook doesn‚Äôt make them the weakest link, you could have easily gotten a bs hit or anything on them causing them to go down. Especially with the amazing host system this game has
---
What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land
---
Im on pc
---
Some survivors even go to my screenshoots and comment -rep killer killyourself and yea I report and nothing happens
---
But killers cant complain about what survivors used to do if they just turn around and do it too. Honestly I feel like the same survivors that did it are the same killers doing it now. I mean do most people not play both? You get a xp bonus for play each per day
---
I bet they didnt know what endgame was and the killer is grabage bc technically they were three scapes
---
Well I'm always looking for new ways to play my favorite killers. What does this build do with overlord bubba?
---
Every game the killer dc'es after 30 seconds, right after they down me, and I lose a pip. Please fix this.
---
oh im sorry, i didnt mean to lead you to believe i give a fuck if you're offended
---
Next time tell them it might be more entertaining for them to watch their dog lick its balls.Its lame. They get little bp and don't pip.  Real winner we got here.
---
I love him, that's why I got him to P3 first. Just a quick tip; 99% your power and only pop it once you're close for a guaranteed down.
---
New killer: The English
---
Birds fly, grass grows, and people DC against Legion.
---
So did you eat the hit or what. You guys always leave me with cliff hangers.
---
Kinda reminds me of the Dahaka fron the Prince of Persia series... for some reasons.
---
I seen a name that was  Hit=DC guess what happened. What funny clowns we have.
---
I absolutely LOVED that mask! Damn it looks amazing! The outfit is nice but doesn't seems to be much and the weapon looks a tad bland but I just liked that mask so much!
---
Thanks! She seems to be pulling through. Shes better today than she was yesterday, and the day before that. She‚Äôs pretty tough.
---
Ah yes, let me crouch in the corner and not do gens. He‚Äôll never find me now! If I don‚Äôt do gens, he can‚Äôt find me during his gen patrol, and I cannot be chased or hooked!
---
Wait, on ps4, I clicked circle and dropped the survivor. So is it just I can't drop and pick up more than once?
---
BLACK pip. BLACK. As in "Safety". Do you need your eyes checked?
---
&gt;  If all you did was get hooked why should you pip? 
---
Being camped makes it impossible to do *anything* other than dangle there, or just suicide and get it over with. It may as well just take the controller out of your hands for five minutes because the only way you can progress is if you kobe (and get downed immediately after), get rescued by a teammate stupid enough to try (and get downed immediately after--Immediately give or take ten seconds with Borrowed Time), or by a literal miracle and all the stars in the heavens align you somehow lose the killer and THEN do everything you can to not get caught again, which doesn't happen often.
---
This is about the same level of argument as "Gens don't go too fast at high ranks, just apply more pressure!"
---
You find your obsession, back away immediately to get your Play with your food stack, repeat 3 times, then at that point Tinkerer should proc and you rush the gen, you down someone then if possible go get your stacks back
---
*insert thonk gif here*
---
this is so fucking sick. black phillip is proud.
---
I mean you put just as much effort into making this design for the pillow then they did
---
usually if i enter a lobby and there's a survivor with "=DC" in their name i just leave

---
I didn't bring it upon this land I birthed it unto this plane if existance
---
I used it with breakdown and boil over just for shits and giggles. Had 3 games in a row where I got off the killer's shoulder more than once. This was in red ranks too. I think on its own the offering is shit though.
---
Dying light is good if you're good at chasing, downing, or have a mori. 
---
Ok but if they are at full health but have been hooked, and someone next to them is injured but isnt hooked, it still can be smart to go after them.
---
And if you got two "bs hits" in one chase, chances are those weren't bs.
---
Thanks this was really helpful! I know hes a weaker killer due to his power but hes fun af to play lol. Just difficult
---
at least he had to crop claudette instead of just directly copy/pasting
---
I didnt say crouch and not do anything. I said play more stealthy and smarter as in maybe not sprint everywhere, figure out killer locations and try to not be found at first. Big difference there junior
---
Mom said delete this post or no Nintendo for a week.

I'm moreso disturbed by the lack of Shirtless Dwight, Jeff &amp; Clown.
---
surveillance is sick
---
We get to play chess now?
---
This is clearly intended
---
...If you don't get camped and still play really badly?
---
You seem convinced I lovingly throw myself into their arms to be put on a hook. I hide the best that I can but since I participate and doing gens and don't just hide in a locker in the middle of nowhere, you can't avoid being spotted forever. I go for a chase, I do what I can, but sometimes RNG sucks and you get no pallets for miles. Other times you just fuck up with basic mistakes, no-one plays a perfect game every single time, it happens. You know, it's the entire REASON why you need to be hooked three times for a full sacrifice.
---
But ONE mistake getting you caught shouldn't result in the entire round being wasted because a Rank 16 Leatherface is shit, bonus points if he's insidious camping a teammate you are trying to rescue for points and progress and getting fucked over instead.
---
There's plenty of ways to depip *without* being camped to death the instant you are caught within two minutes of the game starting, and the fact you think depips would just no longer be a thing is asinine, that or you haven't played Survivor since the Emblem Nerf a couple patches ago that makes it fucking impossible to rank in certain categories.
---
Oh cool!!
---
I think survivors who get facecamped should definitely at least blackpip, considering they‚Äôre taking away the killers attention from everyone else
---
I like potatoes
---
But you still didn‚Äôt seem to respond to my comment on issues that cause those bs hits. Those hits can and will happen many times a game.
---
How is it EZ mode for killers? If you are caught out by the collapse, it is your fault.
---
I hope you realize I'm joking ;-;
---
Should yes. It's what I do. You grossly overestimate the competence of the average Survivor if you think they do what they should.
---
Could've Atleast took a lap around first for the poor guy lol
---
They DC because they are rage quitters with unrealistic expectations. If you DC because ‚Äúfuck this killer‚Äù, then you need to go play a different game.
---
rip kitty amazin memer
---
I know, but when you get hit with it round after round you just stop giving a shit about your team farming you and just leave to get it over with. I had seven campters in ten games and was just fucking done with it.
---
i like to end a chase the moment a survivor goes for an infinite. it's also wise to end a chance the second or third time you get juked. it's time to move on to a less skilled player.
---
Developers almost finished Freddy's rework, it's too late to come with ideas. You should put these a year ago, before they started the rework.
---
You can only be banned for bodyblocking if you're holding the game hostage.
---
- Bodyblocking to get a hit? Nope.
---
- Bodyblocking the last survivor in a corner while the hatch is open and then going to go make tea? absolutely.
---
As for underrated killer perks, I have to say I love Remember Me and Fire Up. Fire Up is a better Bamboozle (stat wise, not blocking window wise) and Brutal Strength mixed into one when you absolutely need to get stuff done, and Remember Me helps keep them in the game longer so you have more of a chance to actually kill someone at the end game.
---
Bloodwarden is a favorite too. I find it funny that I love Freddy's perks but don't really care for Freddy, even if I understand him better than half of reddit.
---
I hated him before because he was easy to loop if he wasn‚Äôt frenzying, but even if he never caught you out of frenzy, he‚Äôd eventually down you anyways because he‚Äôd just frenzy and hit you no matter what. But that‚Äôs fixed now, so it‚Äôs fine
---
I don't recall the monologue going like that-
---
/s
---
Might be the worst comment I‚Äôve seen all day. 
---
The new EGC entirely favors killers.
---
Yooo survivor perks that effect hex totums would be so cool! Like maybe you gotta go cleanse them to get their benefits or smthn
---
True. Although you could add in haste perks such as save the best for last to make up for the lack of power range add ons
---
This is evil... I love it.
---
It barely changed anything. Now you have 2 minutes to escape. If you can't manage that, that is your fault.
---
Yeah, it does happen. It will hopefully be fixed with the introduction of dedicated servers
---
This just in: memes are plagiarism   
---
more at 11.
---
Wow
---
Its like... English isnt the most spoken language and the world and there are... Other languages!
---
I was trying one game to get the entity to kill me just to see it happen but the killer ruined my fun and found me. :(
---
Huntress is getting a gun it's was leaked here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) showing it off
---
I got fucking smoked.
---
Then again, half the battle is catching up to a survivor and tagging them for sleep. You won't get stacks on the perk if they're always awake.
---
DUDE ME TOO!
---
:(
---
That's p much accurate.
---
Yo, Dookie pick up the phone!
---
‚ÄúGreed‚Äù though is all about *selfish* acts. I guess wanting everyone to survive is a little selfish if you‚Äôre all running together, but if they‚Äôre randos I feel more obligated to help them.. I just really want everyone to like this game.. I run into so many survivors that just say ‚Äúscrew that guy, I‚Äôm doin this totem‚Äù or other things like that, so I try to be just super helpful so more people enjoy it
---
Samination once replied to my comment and i felt so good
---
you missed XD
---
That might've freed them
---
I agree, I'm not colorblind and I often have a hard time seeing the generators/scratch marks so I can't imagine what it must be like for people who are colorblind.
---
It's so annoying... just had a freddy do it to a random.. let him crawl to the exit then picked him up carried him around found hatch dropped him by hatch closed the hatch and let him die on the ground.  
---
I'm sick of the hypocrisy in this community. Toxic ass killers coming out of the woodwork in this game.  But they wonder why survivors "tbag" hmmm...
---
I was huntress r and this person farmed a Jake whom I played with the round before as a survivor. I tried to hit the farmer but it went past them and hit the Jake, so I killed the Dwight and let the Jake crawl on the ground as a way to say sorry (he was on last hook). Then I went to where I saw the Ash (last Survivor) earlier in the game and killed him, then let the Jake repair two gens and escape while cleansing my lullaby.
---
I got a message from the Ash talking about how they were reporting me for farming with video evidence on the behaviour support page with a screenshot of them on the support page. Big yikes.
---
Ok. Makes sense.
---
agreed
---
How does that last part make any sense? If I get saved from the hook while the killer is 10 feet away heading to the hook and he decides to down me before I can even make it 5 feet how would that make me bad?
---
and yet you did
---
Does this mean we're also getting the Crapper?
---
Holy shit, that looks great.
---
People thought it was funny and edgy to dc against legion, and then it spread all over the community
---
Ehh lucky
---
Not that two wrongs make a right, but this shit happens to killers too. All gates open and survivors spamming vaults to be annoying. Or running around the map with their MoM because they want it to proc. Swings both ways man.
---
Whatever it takes
---
How so? You still have the ability to open the gates and leave. Just because you've lost the power to screw around and force the game to linger on longer than it should doesn't mean it's tipped in anyone's favor. Certainly not easy mode in any sense unless you're the last person alive and the gates are spawned close to each other.
---
God damn genius
---
Why people keep DCing against him ? You can loop him like a M1 killer without a power.
---
You can't bodyblock, they got that one at least...
---
Better Believe It
---
Not impossible. It's based entirely on map RNG in regards to where the doors spawn. Aside from that, Survivors aren't mean to 1v1 a Killer with expectations to win every time. If it were like that, then it would be completely imbalanced considering there are 4 Survivors and 1 Killer.
---
Nah, The Crapper would be too OP ...
---
Jerma Genie, is that you?
---
hardly doubt you didn't camp or tunnel otherwise you wouldn't be coming in here begging for confirmation. What do you want' for us to tell you, "you are the best killer ever?"
---
If you genuinely think the EGC doesn‚Äôt favor killers greatly, you have never played this game before. 
---
Yeah. The power to open the gates becomes useless if the killer finds you. You just outright lose, there‚Äôs no counterplay.
---
you cant bodyblock freddy though if arent asleep that part is true
---
it would be interesting the pallet cant stun u if the survivor isnt asleep that is a good buff i like, it wouldnt be a small buff that would be a huge buff, its worth testing though
---
Haha yeah. And then you realize you played the last 10 games vs Billy.
---
/consolefeels
---
WAZZZZZUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAPPPPP
---
Just to clarify things, im not saying i dislike the image it looks great, i just hate clown as a killer
---
Fail to Load should not be punished. It's a game issue not a player issue to my knowledge.
---
Play with your food on Myers or Leatherface as you only waste 1 stack per hit
---
Yes there are other languages, but I assume you were trying to speak english, weren't you?
---
colour blind mode would be ok by me
---
No. You're using your collision to line up a hit. You're not stalling gameplay with it.
---
they can't handle the fact that he can injure you no matter what, it's impossible for them to play like that they must not get injured nonono
---
actually, i don't know what the fuck goes through their heads, this is Dead By Daylight we're talking about. 
---
i even got a mask that has an X instead of the smile so now i can play Legion and they will see that X and they'll be like "hey thats not the usual mask" and itll be cool yo
---
No, you can't be banned for that. 
---
I say Surveillance.
---
And yet I bet you you'll be the one to get banned, Much easier than fixing the game
---
The buff we need
---
I have the same ! We should be friends :)
---
when they wake up right in front of you
---
friends are spooky
---
They‚Äôd have to give huntress hair though, even if it was short
---
"camping isn't cheating" "screenshotting that for reddit" HOLY SHIT THE CRINGE IS REAL! Are you seriously 10yo????
---
*The Entity‚Äôs a bitch ass motherfucker he pissed on my fucking life*
---
All the gens don't get blocked from the hatch opening when you're the last survivor. The gens get blocked when the killer closes the hatch and the EGC starts
---
‚ÄúA good survivor doesn‚Äôt get found‚Äù
---
Imagine having only two places to go, and if you get found in the very limited window you have, you‚Äôre now bad at the game. 
---
Have a nice day, this conversation is over after that comment.
---
To quote Matthew "the skins will be pay to lose"
---
Why do you feel that way?
---
You should talk about slugging and map pressure
---
We ran a 4 squad sabo and 4 of those oaks.  And the hooks were so close.
---
"Bonus skin if you buy from steam"
---
Literally every console player: "no"
---
Whatever happened to "no more exclusives"
---
It's Nea tbh
---
Eh I disagree, these changes were more significant than rebalancing. It's a pretty markedly different Legion now than before patch in more than just balancing, it's a rework of his power in several fundamentally distinct ways.
---
Um...he cant down you in his power so all it is is a first time waster..and you can dodge the 1 HIT he has. 
---
They are an M1 killer now.
---
there are a few issues with a colorblind mode. Given the fact that there are so many types and degrees of colorblindness, a single mode wouldn't help unless it changes textures as well as colors.  
---
The other being, if things are made easier to see, for whatever reason, why wouldn't everyone use it?
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary to call strangers dipshits
---
Lol i doubt this.
---
You know what that is? Inflated ego. These survivors should have left the match, realizing that Blood Warden was still a possibility. This Killer was able to rightfully turn this match around because the survivors*refused* to leave, not because they *couldn't*, **got it?!**
---
That‚Äôs the internet culture in a nutshell tbh.
---
Issue with with the Pig being maskless is that she would definitely be confused with survivors more then she already is
---
Wtf is up with your FOV? Why‚Äôs it‚Äôs so wide?
---
Ranking is at its hardest for both sides, which sounds good but for survivors this has resulted more people playing in a toxic way (ps4) cause Ive seen much more farming and tunneling in rank 8-4 games. It was never this bad before this new system.
---
I don‚Äôt recall the name of the perk, but if you use the one that doesn‚Äôt let you see down survivors until in range, you can be deadly as Freddy. 
---
He doesn‚Äôt need to be balanced, people need to learn how to play as him and stop trying to have his unique style dumbed down to theirs.
---
*swoooshj* and he's sucked back in
---
I‚Äôve read legions description but I‚Äôve never played him since I don‚Äôt but the dlcs, how exactly does his power work?
---
Put Lisa's wig back on
---
Yeah u was trying to make it part of the set
---
I often just DC or kill myself on the hook since there's no point in continuing. Hope it gets fixed. I currently use a VPN to avoid it.
---
Hey could be anyone of us
---
I can appreciate that
---
Whenever a killer plays any add-ons, the add-ons last the entire game &amp; will be consumed when the game has finished.
---
The only way to retain the add-ons that were used in a match is to offer a black ward which will save the items.
---
Listen to music.
---
What is that format
---
How could this possibly be considered crying on Reddit?
---
 It as I said, I‚Äôve had many of times where they don‚Äôt disappear, it really doesn‚Äôt make sense to have them dissolve after one match, when survivors are keeping add ons until they lose the item
---
The face a Freddy main makes when all survivors have adrenaline.
---
Poor excuses for poor gameplay.
---
Sorry the hatch isn't a guaranteed escape anymore. You'll live.
---
They don't have to lose you and heal. Take 2 hits, get downed, rescued, healed by others, get hit again, the 4th hit is free and you get the exhaustion-free speed boost to boot.
---
That's very nice!
---
in the comment section, where a comment would be
---
Holy shit shut the fuck up with your political comments on a post of you complaining about a video game because the killer was playing smart
---
another autist!
---
again i didnt know what perks i had on her, it was prob when i sucked ass at nurse
---
True and agreed, the actual effect would need a bit of tuning to not be so borderline broken, but I feel that Freddy should be more a playstyle about getting more people into the dream world to toy with, yeah?
---
THE HOFFINATOR!
---
That about sums it up
---
Crapper is overrated, we need the Fapper
---
I‚Äôm feeling a lil woozy here...
---
This dude hasn't played since the clown was released lmao I'm just tryna get him caught up
---
Yes but the light is on
---
Thank you so much!
---
Because they don't know how to deal with it yet. But it's no rocket science really. Harder to pull off as survivor than avoid as killer
---
Sinners greed is like inverted bbq and chili, it‚Äôs weird and I like it.
---
The ability sounds like a shittier billy
---
But the oozing walls were a normal occurrence in the krusty krab
---
The lights are dimly lit on them when unfinished in game on occasion
---
You know, I could definitely see consuming the red tier add ons that way you don‚Äôt get trapper mains with auto setting traps or anything but the others I‚Äôd like to see them disappear after 2 games, that way you‚Äôre not burning through them as fast but I see what you‚Äôre saying how it‚Äôs a give and take
---
Lots of people seem to want this combo... fuck it, I'll give it a go
---
Am a Wraith main, can confirm this is accurate.
---
And i oop- who cut up all of Lisa's wigs?
---
Flashes of light.Not a bright stream like the one in the cinematic
---
But it did change the power itself
---
That slug race at the end had me laughing so hard.
---
