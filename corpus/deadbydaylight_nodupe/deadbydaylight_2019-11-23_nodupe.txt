Yeah he has definitely changed like I said I‚Äôve really only seen videos so I have no clue what he is like on stream he‚Äôs like a super mixed bag it‚Äôs very strange
---
what if killer but with gun
---
+1 for Otzdarva, spend any amount of time on this sub and you'll soon find out he's the golden boy around here, and for good reason. Keeps a positive attitude, stays down to earth, does a really good job explaining his plays, and messes around with a lot of different builds+characters, even tho we all know his true love is Trapper with Save the Best For Last. 
---

---
You can learn a lot quickly watching his stuff
---
But the oni killed the spirit
---
There.
---
America, but I‚Äôm almost half German. Not only that, but I‚Äôm learning to speak German. And I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not offended by nazi jokes, because a lot of them are pretty funny if you‚Äôre into dark humor.
---
It‚Äôs not something you should do because of some made up obligation. If you don‚Äôt want to, don‚Äôt. Some people do because it‚Äôs just a nice gesture that can maybe even help keep people enjoying the game and coming back to it. It‚Äôs a small community, and even if it weren‚Äôt, I‚Äôd just rather people have fun playing against me. 
---
(Alternatively, it‚Äôs a lowkey powertrip to make the last survivor do what you want them to and then let them go because you‚Äôre so good you don‚Äôt even need the 4th kill. Theoretically.)
---
he looks jewish
---
scott jund,  otzdarva and scorpionz are always good! also i‚Äôve watched panda since he was in the yogscast, so I still appreciate his content.
---
I see no one's gonna mention the perk icon of someone sucking on a dick
---
Lmao I would love to get mori‚Äôd by Andrew Jackson.
---
Contrary to what you might think I don't want SWF to be abolished at all. I just think they need to split up the queues or give you the option to only play vs solo/duo queues as a killer. Though I think your solution would work as well.
---
I love Urban Evasion.  I've ran random builds without it, and suffered. Not saying it's a "great" perk, but it's benefitted me.
---
Wraith was driven to murder by the evil of others, just like Eric. 
---
Nurse had her husband die and had memories replaying in her head of the evils of others that she was driven to kill people. 
---
The Spirit lore starts with her witnessing a murder, trying to stop it, only to be overcame. As she knew she was going to die, she vowed revenge in this life or the next surrounded by glass shards.
---
To quote: 
---
"The ground shook with her father's footsteps. She knew she was not going to make it, but she no longer cared. She would make him pay, in this life or the next.
---
A dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She would not rest--not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.
---
An oath was made and Rin closed her eyes."
---
Eric was thrown out of a window while trying to stop a murder he walked in on.  He was surrounded by glass and couldn't rest until he got revenge. The opening scenes of the Crow talk about how a soul cannot rest until it comes back to right the wrongs. 
---
I'm not really seeing how Draven wouldn't fit. 
---
You can take your pick of characters to relate to.
---
I was playing with a 3 man swf stack &amp; one rando. The rando was a Jake. It came down to me and him at the end.
---
I had done the only 2 gens done, 3 totems (one a lit hex totem) and searched 2 chests. Found a key and needed to do one more gen to find hatch.
---
I almost died 10 times trying to do gens (against a Freddy). &amp; Finally I was like WTF IS JAKE DOING?! &amp; One of my swf spectated him: he was in a locker and every so often would get out, drop his medkit and pick it back up, then get back in the locker.
---
I was so peeved. I went to his locker (upstairs yellow house on Springwood) and fast vaulted the other lockers til Freddy came and found him. I didn't even care if it died at that point.
---
It was just a point that HE died. I was livid. Freddy tried to thank me for ratting him out, but I insisted he kill me too, so I didn't get reported for 'working with the killer.' Randos can be assholes sometimes...

I see you haven‚Äôt met Ashley J. Williams yet.
---
I hate how people worship streamers on this sub. 
---
That being said, Spirit is OP
---
Yeah, I often run it with sticky soda bottle.
---
Or Oni, at least for the PTB
---
I play both surv and killer. Some killers give me hatch, so I give some surv hatch.
---
Are these issues mainly just survivor side? I‚Äôve played like 120 hours on dedicated servers and only had a couple games with a couple survivors teleporting around.
---
This is very realistic
---
I'll do that then. Wish me luck!
---
She sounds cute, I'll look her up on /r/dbdgonewild
---
I think she is still the best killer in the game as she ignores nearly everything that a survivor could usually do to survive - but she is now slightly harder. Lots of people say she is trash because she is hard to learn, but any good nurse player could get a 4k in most games. If you‚Äôre willing to put the effort in- go ahead! But if you‚Äôre looking for someone who is strong but more simple, go for spirit, huntress or ghostface. Perhaps Oni when he is released.
---
Oh I just was too fast, wasn‚Äòt even on purpose lol
---
As a gaymer, I can confirm I will never do this.

---
Depends on how much you play. It‚Äôs easier to get them 40 when they‚Äôre not prestiged. I personally don‚Äôt think it takes THAT long. Especially if you always put your bloodpoints into that specific character and use offerings that give you bonus bloodpoints. 
---
If you plan on prestiging one of the characters then you can go for 3,000-4000 items rather than the ones that are 6,000+. I do that when I prestige someone because I see no point in getting ultra rare stuff when I‚Äôm prestiging them. I prefer to go through it quickly.
---
At that point I'd DC on the spot. 1 OoO is annoying, any more and I'm out.
---
I'm a relatively new player so I haven't had much chance to buy other perks, so for the majority of the time, I've been using: 
---
Lithe 
---
Resilience
---
Spine Chill/Alert
---
We'll Make It 
---
Found that Lithe gives me distance to get to pallets if and when I need to. 
---
If I take a hit, resilience helps me to loop pallets if the killer decides not to break them. Means I can just vault them over and over without being hit over the pallet as often.
---
Spine Chill helps me to avoid chances altogether because I am definitely not the greatest at running the killer around. I'm okay, but not great. 
---
Alert helps me to spend my time more crucially. I can stay on my gen if I see the killer breaking pallets elsewhere or kicking gens.
---
I like to heal faster after unhooking people.
---
I was thinking about that and thats a great point ill leave those add ons alone. Does she have many others that don't change her blink time?
---
Had this happen when I was playing Myers, there were no hooks near any exit gates. I just said fuck it and let the Jake crawl too the exit.
---
If you like looking at the ground for half of the game, go for it..
---
This man speaks truth
---
Lol ok
---
&gt; If this is the standard we are at then you are just looking for this sub to be riddled with low quality memes in exchange for upvotes.
---
A fair explanation! But yea, this quote here is about how I rate this sub as far as game subs go - like, 90% reposts and shit posts, 10% funny or helpful / interesting.
---
You can unlock any survivor perk for all survivors by leveling them up to 35. I recommend going thru each survivor‚Äôs perks and figuring out which ones you‚Äôd like, then leveling up those survivors to get them. If you want to get a feel for which perks you like the most, then try them out! Almost any perk will be considered a ‚Äúwaste of a perk slot‚Äù by somebody, but you might find it to fit your play style very well. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to do your research either. You should make sure what you‚Äôre looking up is current tho. Lots of perks have changed a lot since they came out.
---
Heh. Nice.
---
Ay, thanks lad.
---
This is the content I live for.  
---
Oni being protective of his great-great-great-grandchild or whatever generations are in between.
---
Nancy picking up Ash and then collapsing under his weight is one of the funniest images that comes to mind.
---
I only play solo survivor and I'm pretty sure my escape rate is around 40%.
---
He's right
---
Cowboy Jake ü§†
---
I forgot too put the flair it will be back up soon
---
ONIons
---
Im gonna be honest - I never run ruin on legion and it for some reason it works, but I have to use it on higher tier killers. Idktf why
---
But you‚Äôre missing the point that those are people who mentally snapped and who‚Äôs mind went to insanity, only further corrupted by The Entity afterwards. Eric did not go insane. In all actuality, Spirit is definitely a better example of what you‚Äôre trying to say, and to a certain extent I agree. 
---
However, Eric already completed his mission. The Crow only lets you rest once you have completed what you were supposed to do (hence him dying peacefully at the end). The Spirit has been manipulated by The Entity in hopes of revenge on her father. Eric is not only not insane like the others, but he already achieved his revenge. There isn‚Äôt anything for The Entity to trick him into believing. 
---
Lastly, Eric just isn‚Äôt a villain. Him being the killer when he is objectively the good guy in his story would be stupid. If you really want a Crow killer, it should be based on the concept of the Crow, but not Eric. Others have taken the mantle in the books and movies. Take someone else or even just make your own character similar to how BHVR made a new Ghostface. Eric is not a killer of innocent people. I don‚Äôt care what crap you could spew about The Entity manipulating him, it would not make sense whatsoever in regards to literally everything we know about Draven.
---
Yes, since a gameplan changes how team games work.
---
I bet you are the same kind of person that complains about everyone running ‚Äúop meta‚Äù (ruin/pop/bbq/adrenaline/Bt/ds/whatever) but you ignore that that meta is born from people canceling perks and builds and mocking people for them because you don‚Äôt like them, and although yeah, the reliability of some perks is doubtful, who are you to mock them for how they choose to play?
---
Let people play how they fucking want, oh-god-of-playing-dbd, it works for them, even if you don‚Äôt like it or it doesn‚Äôt work for you. Ffs, people like you annoy the crap out of me, telling complete strangers how YOU think they should play THEIR games.
---
Oh god

He's got the look, but [Jon's got the look and the swagger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nw0PqVrIcQ)

TOO. CUTE. AAAAAHHH
---
No one I know of has recieved a reward yet. I sent a message to DbD Support, and they said to contact Rover directly for help. I wonder if what Rover meant was that they sent out the list of who would get rewards, and BHVR now is actually responsible for assigning them to players?
---
That guy must‚Äôve been on some serious smack.
---
this is fucking incredible!
---
His screams are hilarious!
---
No
---
Usually its Claudettes for me. When I see them wearing dark clothing. They are the first to go.
---
Lol unlike me when my husband plays killer. I always pick one survivor for him to get the hatch
---
lol k
---
&gt; Win against Trapper *IN THE END GAME COLLAPSE*
---
Completely different than what your title indicates.
---
Regardless, at the point that the EGC is even active in the scenario your describing, the survivor isn't supposed to have a 'fair' shot of winning. They had the chance to do generators, they failed. They had the chance of finding the hatch first, they failed. 
---
We're talking about a 3rd chance of survival, it shouldn't be easy or feasible.
---
Alright, that's a sigh of relief for me if that is the case. If nobody has gotten a reward yet then I don't need to be afraid that I might have gotten overlooked somehow. 
---
Thanks.
---
The second half of that is the single scariest DBD image I have ever seen. I think I need to change my pants.
---
Replace yuri with sprint
---
At first I missed the shitpost flair, and was about to be upset that BHVR reworked Clown‚Äôs mori while ignoring Trapper‚Äôs, Wraith‚Äôs, and Billy‚Äôs really lame moris.
---
Not even a competition
---
Excuse me? Have you ever seen Clown?
---
one time me and this Claudette were at the gates giving the killer free hits who had only gotten like 1 person injured but she accidentally turned at the last second so she didn't fall over the line. Neither of us were teabagging or anything, we were both just standing over the line so he could get a bit of points. She got face camped and repeatably hit on the hook. 
---
Another time, I was versing a Myers that got looped most of the game and he played pretty bad. Me and this other person were at the line about to give a few free hits, turns out it was tombstone piece that he didnt get to use all game. Alot of killers will take advantage if survivors try to be nice and give them hits.
---
It would be sadly hilarious if all our rewards were sent to the now-shut-down test server, I have to say.
---
You're 4 people against 1. Perks are only tools of efficiency, not a necessity.
---
Why you maybe you just wanna get in a match faster
---
I was scrolling pretty fast and thought that was Micheal Jackson for a second
---
Freddy would be good if you aren't too bothered about him having bad teachables
---
Nice ebony
---
The Game
---
That, and this also means that Behavior will have fallen behind on the reward deadline they had set for themselves. Not to say they aren't busy, but it makes me giggle.
---
We need a DbD solitaire deck. I need oni as king and hag as queen of hearts
---
The reason I stopped playing it was because it was even more repetitive than dbd. You just jump down, collect blood, ammo and that shit. Then you hide from the hunter and collect more while occassionally helping teammates with your special ability. When you're done you just make a run for it and hope you survive.
---
Id still think its unfair tho, before the last rank reset i was against 11, 10, and 9s with the occasional variance but afterwards its been way higher, consistent 8+
---
Yeah, I tend to stick with the add-ons that decrease her recharge time and fatigue time.
---
Whats the other cosmetic? I only know of the Meg mask
---
LOL I was thinking it‚Äôd be more of him eating someone‚Äôs face and then blasting his horn
---
I havent received mine yet either. :(  It might take awhile to credit to everyone's account.
---
It's not the news, it's the russians screaming at us on voice comms in every other game.
---
So i played today in a lobby where there was 3 survivors only. I thought the game would stop as soon as  it started but it didnt. and then i saw 2 myers. I guess the bug with multiple killers in 1 lobby is back again.
---
The screen shot is from todays game. 23/11/2019
---
Is this a couples joke im too reddit to understand??
---
This is so bad and I love it so much lol
---
New oni would be for you in two weeks, but past him, you would likely like freddy or plague. Freddys addons make him actually cancer to play against in terms of slowdown, and because of how people play against plague if you run thanat, you basically have perma 16% slowdown, not to mention her corrupt intervention perk
---
You also get a Trapper mask.
---
People thinking they'll let this interaction go live must be gray ranks.
---
Slugging provides pressure and is a better option if another survivor is nearby, begin chase with the other person and that's two people not doing gens. Slugging isn't fun but it's a valid tactic and it doesn't really work if the survivors are actually decent and are on top of healing/saving. Many times I have slugged and the people are up pretty quick. I tend not to slug myself since I know how un-fun it can be at times but if the game is going too fast you know I'm going to do what I can to slow the game down just a little bit. I want as many bloodpoints as possible, even if that causes me to lose the match. What's toxic is if you repeatedly slug the same person as soon as they get up until they bleed out.
---
fong
---
Mending doesn't require self heal or anything, he's not bad with nurses calling since he can apply a lot of pressure but he could be better
---
Nice
---
&gt; top streamers agree she's OP
---
The same 'top streamers' that want to be able to 1v1 every killer for gens on end.
---
Ooooohhhh
---
What did they change after the reboot? Only change I saw before I quit was that the hunters had to down a runner twice to execute them instead of once
---
Mind games. What I do, and it usually works, I wait at one exit gate and let the killer come check it out. Once the killer turns around, open the exit gate for 3 seconds (enough to not light up the first light) let killer come back and turn around, you should be able to open it all the way.
---
You're assuming I'm talking about only streamers that play survivors?
---
Nurse never died. The ambulance transporting her after her mental breakdown crashed and they never found her body.
---
Lol they can tell on their screen if they already touched a generator then it'll stay up their screen until it goes away
---
*Laughts in haunted grounds*
---
gotcha.  phew, that gives me a little more hope.  thanks for the response.
---
See, that‚Äôs the catch-22. Most people aren‚Äôt going to give you the hatch so you‚Äôre just throwing away wiggle points. It isn‚Äôt until the Killer walks past a hook that I even begin to consider they might give me the hatch.
---
on the contrary, healing is the worst thing you can do vs a legion, cause he can do 2 health states in 1 hit, just on a delay, so its better to be injured so his power is useless.
---
Where the survivor pudding 
---
WHERE IS THE FUCKING PUDDING
---
It was funnier than expected, we need more
---
Watching Ohmwrecker play dbd is what got me interested in playing dbd.
---
ohmwrecker camped me back when hag was first released lol it was on the house map on coldwind, he put me in the basement and stood in front of the stairs so my teammates couldn't walk past him
---
not out of malice, but out of not wanting to deal with blendette
---
Map pressure has been killed because of tokens. Everyone thinks tokens are stupid and better ideas have been suggested. People hate blinking and not having a second blink. You have to constantly look at Nurse's power to know when you can MOVE because they didn't buff her movement speed. LoS is also TOO easy to break now.
---
Add-ons deserved to go but they nerfed her in the wrong direction.
---
How is it annoying? The overcharge skillcheck gets easy after missing it a couple times and in my experience unnerving presence makes it easier to hit great skillchecks
---
I was thinking of Freddy, but I can't really tell if he's fun from just watching the gameplay. From the survivor's perspective I agree that he's a pain in the ass when it comes to slowing the game.
---
2 things: oni is getting to know legion and how annoing they are,and legion is going to know oni-chan's wrath
---
Received the email today \~3 hours ago, haven't seen any update to my shard or BP count though.
---
Pig has immense slowdown, **if** she can get the down on multiple survivors.
---
This is where the c tier comes into play, her ability has nothing to do with getting downs, it doesn't help in a chase, but it can help the first hit if survivors are braindead or first hit of the game when they don't know its pig.
---
Its about causing damage and not caring about receiving it
---
He will almost certainly keep the teachables unlocked. I personally disabled my freddy/clown DLCs for a while because I didn't want the game to roll dailies for them. It didn't affect the perks at all. I was still able to get all the teachables on any killer I leveled. I would be very surprised if this was treated any differently with family sharing.
---
You have a key or die, They have to spawn relatively far to have a chance and certain killers can completely shut you out such as a trapper who simply resets his traps on a gate before looking for the survivor or billy whom can reach both relatively fast. The only time I've really seen someone escape is when you start your escape while they set up or they start to look for you for whatever reason. Personally i use whispers as a killer so unless you have a key there is legitimately no way you're escaping which sucks for the survivor
---
Oh weird! I was playing Freddy last night and someone used one of these against me. I kept chasing him and he just dropped randomly mid chase. It all makes sense now.
---
It‚Äôs like fatalities in MK11 online, people think you wanna see something you‚Äôve seen a thousand times already. Nobody cares, first few times seeing it is cool, after that it‚Äôs the most boring shit ever.
---
Yeah, I talk about this game a lot to my brother who has never played it. The other day he asked me if I thought he should get it. I straight up told him, ‚Äúdo yourself a favor and never buy this game.‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt know what it is about this game that makes me love it and hate it with a burning passion at the same time
---
Ok so power doesn't help her chases, got that, but I don't think you have to be braindead to get hit by her even after you realize it's pig (which should be really quick because of the saw things around the map).
---
"activating cloak Mode"
---
I can't believe you've done this
---
Can we get an iron cross too pls? They look pretty sick.
---
Little bit scared about Oni. People say that he's op right now, so he'll probably get nerfed in the future. This, or people will learn how to play against him.
---
Jane has the worst ass in the game imo... it looks like two beanbags

Pig is only able to sneak right up on you if you aren't paying attention, but she can use her stealth to get close and score a hit if you arent close to a loop. As someone who favours pig/ghostface, just run to a loop, either they'll stop the chase or waste so much time that even if they catch you it'll be a loss for them. You don't even have to be super skillful, just throw down a pallet. The only time you're truly fucked is if you can't heal and you don't know where she is, but even then you've still got 3 lives and she's got to go find someone else or lose the match facecamping (aka auto depip)
---
If it's their first hook when everyone else is dead, I'm gonna kill them. If I don't know, and they loop me decently at the end then I give hatch. 
---
Honestly if the killer cant find you cause your hiding your just gonna get your other teammates killed early. As a survivor, you want to try and keep as many of your team alive for as long as possible because you get much more done even if that means you getting put on a hook.
---
So you open up by confirming that he's only strong in the very scenario I put forth.  We're in aggreeance.  You then go into an encyclopedia length description of a ton of scenarios I was never once referring to.
---
You then go on to frame the long-winded reply as if I was complaining about the mechanic or asking for a change of any kind.  I was simply stating a fact with no further agenda man.  You took it to like 100 places I was never looking to travel.  This was never a statement against EGC or talking about an "OP" killer or mechanic.  You read way too much into this comment man.
---
I vote Quentin because he's getting a Speedo outfit once his face rework happens. I know he will because I don't know what I'm going to do if he doesn't.
---
No, I'm fairly certain I know the streamers you're talking about.
---
I don‚Äôt mind swf but swf with comms is bs.
---
Speedo Quentin after the visual rework.
---
Lol when is his face rework because he needs it bad
---
Just give Billy an addon to load the shotgun cosmetic and each shot instantly kills a survivor and sends them flying like a ragdoll.

Do I need to apologise for being more well equipped at birth than others? Samination‚Äôs name was literally mentioned in the original comment, it‚Äôs not my fault people didn‚Äôt use their initiative to search him up? The reason I even ended up finding him was because I saw his content being talked about, and clearly did something 300iq otherwise known as ‚Äúgoogling‚Äù. I‚Äôm so sorry dude.
---
It's not even confirmed that it will happen yet. They are trying to work on getting it though.
---
People who get the hatch: 
---
In my mind : 
---
Any ash 
---
Non-toxic players
---
People who had two disconnects. 
---
In reality:
---
Oh shit I found the hatch on the way to the final hook. Here ya go.
---
If it's an indoor map a pig can easily sneak up, they just crouch around a corner and then jump out, but ok it sounds like her main drawback is she's bad at chases fine, she still has massive slowdown when she downs you, at that point you're basically down a survivor, and once she gets two I feel like progress is significantly halted and this lets her gain even more ground the longer the match goes on.
---
That's the cutest fucking thing I've ever seen in my entire life...
---
Then why does she have a rope around her neck and she's floating side to side with her head looking down suggesting she's dangling from this  rope?
---
Cool I‚Äôll try that
---
Huh, which one?
---
I mean at this point, they should just give killers guns and have  survivors spawned tethered to poles.
---
Free 30000 bps for both.
---
Damn nice drawing.
---
so basically no one should be playing dbd? understood
---
Iron maiden is the mindgame of perks
---
Imagine if the Killers were slower than the Survivors.
---
your friend is a scrub
---
I always end up playing with them bc we both forget the next day
---
Yeah tried going in basement for possibility of finding a key in a chest and no luck. I sometimes just hide till the EGC ends to spite the killer and let the entity take me that way
---
GOT 'EM
---
I do a "come on" before I crouch spam if I'm being friendly to the killer
---
BC it parallels how she strangled her patients to death and is #aesthetic. Her lore literally states *Only Sally had survived the night*.

My favourite is Fungoose and ZubatLel. Both are amazing at the game and fun to watch. I also watch Tru3 as well and Ussylis.
---
Of the licensed Killers, especially those with tracking perks, Ghostface is probably your best bet. Pig and Leatherface are just weak, Michael is an inferior version of GF, and Freddy is powerful...actually, Forever Freddy is probably up your alley.
---
you have to be braindead to get hit by her stealth form unless you aren't looking around at all. Her ambush is delayed and makes huge ass oink.
---
She moves slower in stealth and cannot freely attack without standing up for 1~ second
---
Otz almost never plays survivor my guy. But it humor your response, them complaining about Spirit doesn't mean they enjoy running killers around forever. 
---
Many streamers will note how quick gens get done regardless of which side they play.
---
This is Robert England freddy. Looks great üëç
---
What the actual fuck
---
Oh you right my b
---
Oh, TIL. Never knew that.
---
Honestly i was so uninterested in doing that trapper challenge that I did this too. Let them all go if they stepped into my traps, pretty good game not gonna lie. Got some bp and finished a challenge that most likely would've pissed me off, though i still had to suffer through that 200,000 BP challenge which took forever because of the fucking bug on it :(
---
oof, also yeah its pretty common dedicated servers didn't really help. I mean you got that previously if killer (on pc) had a potato PC and was playing anything that caused GPU hammering like clown gas, or nurse blinks cos the server part of the game couldn't keep up.... but lol.... thats all offboarded now and its horrible.
---
ive missed people as killer quit a bit because they're not where my client shows the when i attack. and no its not dead hard or lag.
---
You *FOOL*!
---
Now you'll always have a friend.
---
That doesnt contradict what he said, lol.
---
You can leave if you offer me an item.
---
I actually wasn't talking about Otz. Moreso certain other Huntress main streamers.
---
&gt;them complaining about Spirit doesn't mean they enjoy running killers around forever. 
---
Not the impression I get when I see them stream or watch their video where they complain that they could *only* run a Spirit around for 30 seconds to 1 minute on average.
---
I love how quick it is. Good shit.
---
Haven't heara caramelldansen in such a long time!
---
Thanks OP.

Wdym how do nurse and wraith have a thing if they never met the devs confirmed they do

I like using tenacity flip flop unbreakable and whatever random 3rd perk I want. Usually a exhaustion perk or bt. When you run with a group it's good. Solo not so much. If I get even the smallest distraction I can slide away so quickly all while healing myself to get back up. Believe it or not the killers always start looking in the wrong place because they dont assume I'm going to slide away with my slither build. If they do catch me sliding the flip flop helps me wiggle free.
---
So they gave eachother outfits for Valentines day?

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, neato

No they confirmed it in a stream a while back not sure which one it was but I remember it

That was pretty major, it made runners all but immortal combined with all their other evasion and hiding abilities.  I'd have to go back through the forums and patch notes but basically just giving runners everything they wanted, buffing them constantly while ignoring / nerfing hunter *exactly as they did before*.  Same procedures = same results.
---
Spirit makes the game play out different than most games. Legion has the same effect, except without the 4k. No one likes when any one character in any game shakes up the meta with no real response to that change.
---
See old Lion in Rainbow 6 Siege.
---
I hope so. It would be nice, but I'd be more than happy to pay for it. Maybe I should try to download it just in case there 's ever cross-progression. I think I have an old busted laptop I can plug into my TV! ü§£

---
Should not be to long
---
They‚Äôve said it‚Äôs something they‚Äôve wanted to do so maybe.
---
As a killer main, I‚Äôm triggered. But also impressed.
---
I'm confused why they even made Deathgarden to  begin with. It seems like the target audience is ALMOST in direct conflict with their own game, DBD, except with guns. I felt like Deathgarden was inevitably going to die like the rest of the DBD clones. 
---
The thing is, i liked the beta, and thought it might have a chance after all. But after release... they drastically changed things. 
---
However, there is ONE thing I do like about Deathgarden, alternative objectives. In Deathgarden, players didn't immediately start capping objectives or killing survivors. You also had to upgrade your abilities, collect ammo, health, etc. too. 
---
I wish DBD also had a more improved secondary objectives in the game, instead of just gen-rushing 24/7 or face-camping.
---
Spine Chill
---
that wouldn't work on a good nurse tho. you can just look at the ground to reduce distance
---
If a SWF is T-bagging and waiting at the exit for the Killer, they're toxic. Unfortunately, that's very common.
---
How does David keep that physique in the entity's realm? Is he doing like 500 pushups by the campfire?
---
This is very true, I just think it would make the game scarier ( at least for me). Idk how I would feel if I'm working on a gen and a dude is killing some chips on his mic lol having the killer come right to us. 
---
I just think  proximity chat would weakin the marjor strengths SWF has. Hearing is a big part in those I see as good killers cause can notice people in grass and walking to left or right. So I agree with you but what's the ratio of people who would go through all that vs. Those who would just use the proximity chat? See what I mean bro
---
True story! But a good pig will know not to trigger it.
---
Well, the Killer is at a fundamental disadvantage when facing SWF. That's why I don't even get mad about it anymore.
---
Well it would probably depend on what role your more suited to, killer or survivor?
---
I think, it was more a combination of having too much and too less overlap. The DbD demography aren't necessarly shooter players or used to the fast pacing of the original game. On the other hand you can't expect people to grind for another gaas title by the same company.
---
It definitely needed a nerf. Against a large amount of killers it was completely guaranteed unless they tunneled you off the hook, which meant 4 people adding 4 extra hits to every match against the killers who least needed that massive nerf.
---
It was cancer.
---
MoM was one of the most broken perks released. It deserved to be nerfed, but not as bad as it did
---
You‚Äòve forgotten why the devs haven‚Äôt nerfed team communication yet.
---
It was op.
---
Did it get any publicity at all? I don't remember seeing any big streamers playing it, ever.
---
I mean, yeah...that much is certain, even just from the post lol
---
TydeTyme‚Äôs prediction that DG would kill DBD has come true...wait...wut?
---
If healthy big boy legion is going to come up to you with frenzy and smack you. Now you're injured and in deep wound. He ends his frenzy, and hit you down. 
---
If injured, you still go into the injured state. Then you still go down either way.
---
:/
---
Yes, Self Care against Legion is the best.
---
Actually I dont know the answer to this lol I got the game when it first came out but haven't played it until last year. So please fill your boy in....details, details.
---
When using balanced landing while not exhausted you no longer make any noise when falling or landing
---
It‚Äôs just for entertainment lmao. If you want more in depth gameplay Monto ain‚Äôt it. Now Fungoose? That‚Äôs some 400IQ entertainment.
---
What do you think they should had done added more hits rather than just protection hits. What would you want the dev's to do to make it better.
---
That Mikey is legally deaf lol
---
First thing i saw when reading the Onis story is he definitely has an undefined mental illness, gives him rage. Its obviously genetic
---
The entity doesnt see that way, sees them as ripe humans lol
---
It most definitely needed a nerf.  It didn't need to get turned into dog shit do.
---
Lmao he was hard tunneling. It didnt help that I actually couldnt be healed lol
---
omg... what a nightmare
---
I love how cute the Spirit is omg it‚Äôs adorable
---
&gt;ego problem 
---
It‚Äôs dbd, this game is meant to have fun with it. The horror genre is so niche, you can literally all be my friends in real life. Not a lot of people really like this stuff, to find anyone is into the same stuff as me is a great thing. People also always ask ‚Äúhow do you play this game and not be toxic‚Äù etc etc. well, you‚Äôre all into the same stuff I am and find enjoyment in this, we really could be friends irl. That‚Äôs how I have a good time playing this game. Sorry I‚Äôm drunk.
---
Pretty sure the skull rings weren't a thing till WW2 but otherwise solid
---
Yes he is.
---
While he was not in the right for being so, well, unpleasant neither are you for breaking the rules and including his name in the post which breaks the rules of this reddit.
---
If you play Xbox: people tend to play survivor more at night, therefore demand is higher for killers. Vice versa with day. Or if it‚Äôs backwards for you then backwards
---
There seems to be a glitch in the matrix.
---
Make them weaker
---
This is onis father, actually.
---
I do this too, it doesn‚Äôt always work but when it does it‚Äôs so satisfying
---
Your friend needs to throw his opinion down a set of stairs, stab it with a dull knife, and light it on fire.
---
Pig is one of the easier killers to face.
---
Her crouch is mostly map dependent and her dash is super telegraphed when the user isn't using add-ons for it. Her reverse bar trap only really functions as a slow down and has zero kill potential against swf groups.
---
&gt;!Still better than Legion after they get their nerf!&lt;
---
I actually get a little grossed out by the puss covered skin; I usually tab out or try to ignore it
---
(I was going to write puss-y skin, but that sounds totally fucked)
---
i agree, good =/= toxic, it's obnoxious clickbait. that said, my issue is that people using comms gives survivors an unfair advantage. survivors are balanced around being deprived of information, so negating that makes them nigh-unbeatable. this is particularly evident at red ranks just after rank reset.
---
i don't fault people for taking any advantage they can, i'm just frustrated that the playing field isn't even.
---
i wish we had the real Freddy
---
I like it it sounds hard to counter because not many legions run through pallets maybe he can‚Äôt vault pallets but can break them quickly and can‚Äôt vault windows as fast?
---
Check to make sure your mouse isn't multiple clicking. This happens very frequently with Razer mice.

---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* **If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)**
---
 
---
&gt;* **If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.**
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019
---
](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
That's the thing though, you don't have to loop killers for minutes on end to win if you remember that it's a 4v1, not a 1v1. If you can duke or loop a Spirit for 30 seconds to 1 minute then that's more than enough time to do all the gens if the survivors are playing optimally. 
---
So it's still on the Spirit to catch the survivors quicker than that, which is really only possible consistently against top-tier survivors with Nurse or Spirit. With those killers you always have a chance to win, no matter how optimal a SWF squad you face. With a lot of other killers there's literally nothing you can do to shut loops down faster. Which means there's nothing you can do to stop gens being done extremely quickly if the survivors are half competent.
---
I know but like... *why?* why would anyone do this? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Internet, duh‚Äù
---
So people here wank to animated corpses? oof
---
dunno wtf he was doing but it could've been devour hope.
---
I TOLD YOU NO TEETH DAMNIT
---
No, the Spirit‚Äôs father killed the spirit. The Oni was her ancestor.
---
Before it was actually released. ptb MOM was op as shit
---
yeah. one game i hooked someone right away, then when they got unhooked, they stayed at the hook and so i rehooked them and every survivor left saying "we aren't going to play against a toxic camping killer" like bruh. am i not even allowed to try to win? is that the only way to not get bitched at by the entitled ass survivor community?
---
That's when you start crawling towards a door
---
Maybe get better at running away from an M1 killer then, because mending and healing takes less than 40 seconds, if not even less time, and is also getting nerfed in the next patch to take even less time.
---
Stares
---
A SWF build. Object of Obsession, Decisive Strike (All), Sprint Burst (All), Unbreakable (All)
---
The original? Yes, it was. OP making this post during PTB time spooked me though as the perk is fine as is now
---
I play on console. What's a nurse?
---
I've been on fire and can confirm that fire causes survivors to instantly be downed and then rolled. With the right add-ons it can even cause you to give away your location by screaming.
---
[removed]

"New player"
---
In red ranks
---
How?!?! I'm 400 hours in and my highest survivor rank was 6.
---
I play on xbox.... weird
---
If Legion Frenzy stabs you then you get a speed burst to run away, if he tries to end Frenzy right behind you then he's stunned for 5 seconds, you have a ton of leeway, it's why he's considered one of the worst killers, they're easy to run from.
---
I remember going against a prayer bead spirit and well everyone gave up but after she killed the first two she realize how fucking stupid prayer beads were and let me and my friend get hatch with my friends key.

Yes, or when your trying to three gen, finish your traps, and see someone almost done with one of the gens.

There are a few reasons why we‚Äôve decided to unlock these cosmetics for everyone. To start, most these cosmetics were unlocked using Steam codes and could not be unlocked on the console versions of the game, meaning we couldn‚Äôt give these codes to console players. Given this limitation, we have moved away from exclusive items in recent years and want to continue the trend of making cosmetics available to all PC and console players equally.
---
Most importantly, the codes for these cosmetics were also being sold by code resellers for exorbitant amounts of money. Others were taking advantage of this by creating fake listings to scam people out of their money. This is not something we endorse, and not something we are able to support if someone does fall victim to one of these scams.
---
By giving these cosmetics to all PC and console players, we hope to put an end to shady resellers and scams while also including everyone, regardless of the platform they play on.
---
also I've only been ayung for a couple days, but so far almost every survivor i play against is over the top dick headish and every killer has been cool as fuck
---
Who's the conspicuous asian shemale talking to Kate
---
We can help that
---
Guy, that's a bit of a buzzkill
---
Take your fucking updoot
---
The problem with the Perk is that withstanding a free hit is something that could potentially be very powerful especially if multiple survivors could do it.
---
The problem with the old version of MoM is that it was so easy to get with little to no counterplay for most of the killer roster that it wasn't even funny.
---
The ease of its access had nothing to do with with the amount of hits but the fact that you had to do almost nothing and you still earned it. 
---
As Wraith or Amanda for example you kind of just had to deal with it. Unless you just didn't hit the survivor there was no way you could avoid MoM
---
While I would absolutely love to play as dean, I doubt this will happen. Dont have any particular reason to why, just dont see it happening.
---
I feel like we're on the same page but just reaching different conclusions. You just explained how the core of this game is busted, which is why Nurse and Spirit are seem as outliers.
---
I just feel the rest of the game needs to be looked at to fix these issues. Bringing killers to Spirit or Nurse level is not an answer I want. Plus, SWF are more common at high ranks but still not the predominant playerbase. Optimal solo survivors will always make mistakes that allow a killer to capitalize off them. The problem is Spirit/Nurse gains way more results from these mistakes.
---
Survivor on console will, without fail, run at you when you charge your blink so I usually get more hits with short blinks.
---
Also
---
I'm all ears is a great perk when you start trying her out.
---
This is coming from somebody that usually only gets 2 sometimes 3 kills with her on switch so my advice might be hot garbage.
---
I'm thinking it's more possible than we think, because the show is ending and it probably isn't too expensive of a license. They would probably be open to expanding their community
---
They nerfed the shit out of that instaheal, even the purple instaheal is better than the pink one now,
---
Since you just got gf, you should get stbfl because it's good on all M1 killers and nurses calling because it's good on all stealth killers. Then just throw on bbq and ruin because they're essentiels
---
A quick way to buff solo survivor would be emotes and voice commands.
---
'Don't save me yet'
---
'It's the Hag'
---
'Gen's almost done'
---
Didn't expect a SW meme in DBD Sub, a suprise to be sure but a welcome one
---
Damn. I hope they dont nerf oni but we‚Äôll have to wait and see. Hopefully if they fuck up and see killers start leaving the game theyll come to their senses but, hopefully it doesnt come to that.
---
Feng has some great abilities. Once you get her character to level 40, you might want to consider playing as her but putting bloodpoints in other characters for their teachable abilities.
---
See, was that so hard? Lol Despite your condescending response "Like, I think the idea itself is clearly ridiculous enough to not need further explanation..." at least you put some thought into it.
---
If they haven‚Äôt played toxic, played well, had a trash team, and they don‚Äôt wiggle, they‚Äôll get it. Any of those boxes aren‚Äôt checked though and to the hook you go.

I don't understand....the logic...

Yep, sadly

---
Before it didn't require protection hits it was just three regular hits.
---
Basically meaning that the killer had to hit you three times to activate it.
---
This meant that a large majority of the killer roster had no way to actually counter the perk Also considering this was before the secondary vs basic attack split, you couldn't just ambush as pig to avoid it your ambush would also count towards it.
---
This meant that with combinations like dead hard you could practically extend the chase for ridiculous a ridiculous amount of time with next to no skill on your card. 
---
Tl:dr It worked off just being hit rather than protection hits meaning it punished the killer for doing their job
---
* Meg getting Moried*
---
Bill: Y'all hear sumn?
---
I remember doing this challenge.
---
My only trap all game was with the final survivor after I downed her friend. With a series of stepping into my own traps and swinging at the air I was able to get her to step on four traps. She and her friend then gave friendly teabags and allowed me to get some extra deviousness points at the exit gate.
---
The community can be so amazing sometimes.
---
Yeah, I remember the broken original version. OP posting this during PTB times spooked me though.
---
I've never sen a Pig moonwalk to a gen from 36 meters away. Premonition also exists.
---
thank you! and hey, can i put other characters perks in frng?
---
you can't heal up yourselfh unless you finish heiling the deep wound debuff,it works more like an,stop! rather than an marking move,so try to use it mostly to have the people scattered arround the map,so they can't help eachother,making chases,andzoning more easy
---
I suggest watching Otzdarva, he helped my trapper gameplay a lot.
---
I do appreciate it! Drive by disagreement guy says it was too ridiculous to need an explanation like a typical stranger on the internet. Lol
---
Yeah maybe, or obvious loop points like pallets and windows, then the trapper can pick them up and move them. At least they'd be close
---
HE'S SMILING!   
---
How can we not pet him?
---
Ok please explain to me why being unpleasant is an acceptable response to unpleasantness.
---
Swf instaheal gangs
---
Yeah I get it now because before I thought if you healed the deep wound you came out of injured aswell but that‚Äôs not the case
---
WHY THE FUCK ARE SO MANY SURVIVOR MAINS BIG DUMB QUITTERS? I'VE BEEN PLAYING A LOT FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS AND I THINK I CAN COUNT THE MATCHES WHERE NOBODY EITHER DISCONNECTED OR GAVE UP WAY EARLY WHILE ON THE HOOK ON ONE HAND. JUST PLAYED A MATCH WHERE TWO TEAMMATES STOPPED STRUGGLING AS I WAS SECONDS AWAY FROM UNHOOKING THEM, THEN THE THIRD LED THE KILLER DIRECTLY TO THE GENERATOR I WAS WORKING ON AND GOT US BOTH KILLED. THING IS I WAS USING "BETTER TOGETHER," SO I KNOW THAT IT WAS 100% INTENTIONAL. FUCK YOU!
---
Almost every non-licensed skin available in Iridescent Shards.
---
I'm shocked... and hyped.
---
titties
---
*I thought i was the only one...*
---
Quentin or Tapp
---
Tapp because he is my precious boy
---
Quentin because his P3 makes him look like a drug dealer that just had to bust some heads on the most violent way possible.
---
What?
---
&gt; best exhaustion perk in the game
---
Not by far.
---
What streamer do you watch that you're parroting? How mad did he get because he failed to catch someone in a loop?
---
No that's definitely what im looking for, I'm playing on Switch as well. Just curious, why is that specific to survivors on console?
---
I agree. I think the best way forward would be to show on Killer side whether a lobby is SWF or not, so they can plan ahead with their build. Right now it's just safe to assume they are, but that leaves the game in a state that's balanced poorly for Killers and solo Survivors to keep SWF from being too OP.
---
Nurse main here................LMAO
---
Is there hope for us???
---
there's a reason why is so good legion on mid-low elos,when ppl start plaing more together,but still not organizased yet
---
Old freddy was super easy to 2K with. Not using NOED.
---
I actually never played her once
---
Rofl
---
I miss end game freddy builds :( remember the toxic synergy that was running dying light and remember me on freddy using class photo?
---
The pig would have to know you have it most people who played pig don't intentionally go in with the knowledge that a survivor has spine chill it's not that meta for them to start walking backwards for the most part.
---
Hello even some of the best pig players will play to avoid it. 
---
Same goes for most stealth Killers it doesn't give anywhere near enough information for you to go out of your way to counter it.
---
You sure can! This works for all characters, survivors and killers, that once you level up each character to their teachable levels (30, 35, and 40) that ability is able to be used by other characters of their genre (killers cant learn survivor perks, and so on).
---
So once Feng hits 40, her perks are able to be in other character's bloodwebs. Like her Alert perk or Lithe can be learned by anyone after you unlock the teachable.
---
Ideally I agree that all the killers shouldn't be Nurse/Spirit level, but at the moment I see them as necessary evils. I absolutely also agree that the rest of the game needs looking at, fix those things, then I'd have far less of a problem really changing the way Spirit works, or even buffing survivors and their perks. I just think they should do that *before* they take away one of the only consistently viable killers at red ranks.
---
He‚Äôs not toxic at all. He‚Äôs crass at times, sure but he‚Äôs an entertainer.
---
I meant based off the tv show called "supernatural"
---
Very interesting find
---
Oh
---
They should give current freddy an addon that just straight up makes him old freddy
---
Didn‚Äôt say it was far above Adrenaline or DH but doesn‚Äôt extend loops by much and or have a passive on top of it. 
---
What streamer? Why is this even being brought up? BL extended all loops even while exhausted. It needed changing and it‚Äôs still very good but not as good as DH or Adrenaline anymore.
---
He's just a skinny legend
---
Little dude moaned on NNN, had to happen
---
I understand I'm in the wrong here, but there are 5380 results for redneck on steam so I'd say it will be very hard to find the exact one from this game
---
He‚Äôs just funny to listen to and it‚Äôs funny to watch him play silly builds. I don‚Äôt need to explain how entertainment works. If it‚Äôs not funny for you then just go about your business lmao.
---
Don't you mean Freddy's Bitches?
---
I'd love to have old freddy back now that survivors dont run self care anymore, it used to be heavy meta when you played him
---
Pretty sure this is less about catering to killers and moreso that instaheals were just like... kinda lame before, you push a button and *whoop* health is back, very little engagement there. Now you can't just kinda slap your tummy mid-chase and become unkillable. The purple one kinda fills that purpose now but if the killer decides to just not hit you then you don't get permanent benefit.
---
I know, that doesn't make him try hard at all. He uploads videos of himself losing
---
Damn Claudette‚Äôs new perk looking nice
---
feng is arguably the best starter character. 
---
lithe is good for getting out of chases, alert is nice for keeping track of the killer and technician can help if you miss skill checks. 
---
after getting to around rank 10, however, her perks aren‚Äôt very helpful (except lithe paired with dance with me &amp; lightweight) so i‚Äôd consider leveling up claudette for self care or dwight for bond, whichever you prefer.
---
Can't tell if you're joking but it was the episode where spongebob's house was eaten by those worms "nemotodes" or something like that. Can't tell yah the title or episode number though
---
There's a first time for everything
---
Hand it over. That thing. Your blood.
---
If it glows, it goes.
---
PC Nurses can just instantly twirl around to hit people while console Nurses have much more difficulty doing this. Console players also don't really have to learn more effective methods of facing Nurse due to most people playing her either being hot garbage or just doing dailies.
---
This has just been my personal experience with Nurse and my tips may be proven wrong by a more experienced Nurse player.
---
Oh nvm I just realized I got r/wooshed
---
I saw icons on an actual photo and thought it was a terroristn survival meme
---
Xbox player. Ranking up on PC is harder if you're on there, as killers are way better. 
---
Also, my playstyle is incredibly suited to pipping up. It involves all 4 of the different types of points. I basically evade the killer as much as possible as I'm pretty bad at running the killer around. So I get lots of objective points. Eventually the killer does come for me so I get the boldness/survival points. Then, using we'll make it, if the killer doesn't come for me, I'll get hook rescues and heal them up. 
---
Correct me if you think this is an incorrect statement, but I genuinely don't think the ranking system is very accurate in reflecting ones skill level. Not in DbD at least. I'm currently in Rank 1. But I am under no illusions - I am seriously NOT rank 1 material. I just trick the game into thinking I am good at everything so I pip up a lot ...
---
How could I be joking?
---
There were a few people on dbd forums that thought of some pretty good ones, I'll try and find them and post them here
---
I forget but its where spongebobs house gets eaten i think so he tries to live with patrick, and patrick is always hogging the rock, and drooling while hes asleep.
---
Franklin says hi
---
It's pretty sad that the only reason I died is because I dropped my toolbox for the killer. Also I would've died even sooner if I didn't have Spine Chill for the increased action speed.
---
Dwight's elf costume isn't named "Dwelf on the shelf"
---
:(
---
You know, whenever I see this meme like this people always seem to forget that she completely kicks his ass right after saying that.
---
"You will" indeed.
---
Well you're wrong in either case so
---
That was exactly what they said I believe, but you never know
---
Thanks! I was really surprised to see naked textures, especially after devs' decision to make shorts instead of thongs. I have recreated full bodies of some other female survivors (Meg, Nea and Jane) and now I can make them fully naked! Maybe. At least, I'll try and maybe even publish it here
---
Let's hope that elden ring doesnt have... the multiplayer dark souls 3 had
---
Somehow I knew you would.
---
1436 hours and I'm still terrible at it.  Kudos, must've felt good. Can't wait for the first time that happens to me
---
They way I see it, they‚Äôve constantly gone at perks/items/add-ons to nerf survivor to cater for killers
---
i feel like this kinda ruins the whole point of the perk imo its a chase perk not a stealth one tho it is broken as hell on haddonfield
---
I'm like, congratulations, you just created a toxic killer main
---
Your missing out üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
That's some tough titties right there
---
I beg for this. Its simplest way to bring teams coordinated without the power of swf. They dont have to put "trap here!" but a simple "dont save me" or "i'll go for the unhook" types of preset comms would be damn sweet
---
I completely understand. I'm glad we had this discussion. I been in red ranks before and trust me, I know the pain of not playing a killer besides Spirit/Nurse (I tried Billy but I just can't get the hang of him). 
---
But I would prefer seeing changes made to the game itself but I understand how risky that is and in the meantime I get killers wanting to not raise their blood pressure every match.
---
And they will just farm you anyway
---
Update the console and/or restart it.
---
Agreed. Freddy's unique-ness is gone.
---
u kno they do that shit in-between trials, exchanging clothes. billy's the crossdresser
---
I'm sorry I'm confused somebody please break it down.
---
Should be base kit.
---
All the devs had to do was have bear traps slow down the EGC greatly.
---
Honestly, they both look legit to me. First hit looks a little sketchy but is within the hit box. Second hit, he clearly got hit through the window before he had a chance to move but looks like the Clown was out of position because he was already backing up and turning before the camera turned. 
---
Hit boxes are bigger than people think they are. Windows are not force fields.
---
Dark Souls is less painful than learning Nurse on console. As someone who has Platinum on Ds3/Bb/Sekiro. I do think she is easier for newer players to pick up, but at purple/red ranks and maybe even green ranks, you're going to get totally shit on at the start.
---
idk man i think she is just cute
---
Ah thay actially makes sense. I havent gone crazy into the Switch's settings much yet but maybe theres a sensitivity setting where we could get more PC like reactions
---
It's really not that hard, I did it at rank 3 on my 3rd try
---
You don't have to fix them completely. Just be there at the very end of completion. So if you come up on 3 gens that are 99% you could technically do 3% gen work that game and get it. Try running bond and just jumping on gens with others. Its a pain, but its not unmanageable.
---
It'ss raww! This has made my day. I still watch him here and there
---
Oh man... shes pretty great. Nurse feels incredible to play as, would highly recommend. She sucks at generic chases tho. 
---
(Yes im a nurse main.. but i dont run hex ruin... and if i cant blink twice before i hit you i don't even try it)
---
Servers down homes.
---
Which is weird cuz the killer is supposed to be the powerhouse
---
I thought you meant you knew what the episode was but was asking because it had Oni. Like seeing a girl with pink hair drinking beer and asking "what episode is lazy town is this?" Basically just being sarcastic.
---
I enjoy
---
Even the non PTB servers?
---
Wait dbd has a tutorial
---
same here
---
#nice
---
Oh oops my bad sorry.
---
Yup.  Down for me as well.
---
Same! The only dbd player I enjoy watching. Know any others like him?
---
Same, thought it was just my internet but it's working fine for everything else.
---
What if they took a perk slot away from each player in a swf to make up for them getting similar effects of kindred or bond or whatever.
---
Shit, thanks for the heads up.
---
Same here
---
Almost every perk in the game has changed in some way, but I'll give you what ds used to be if you were the obsession ds was always active and if you were not the obsession you had to wiggle to 25% for ds
---
I mean, that's basically the Plague's whole thing. She spews stuff at you that makes a timer that injures you and she can spew it on windows and pallets and stuff so that if you touch em you get affected by the time. Not sure exactly how you'd make a killer that does that in a different enough and fun way.
---
So when is Oni-chan going to avenge the spirit by hurting those that nerfed her
---
same for me damn
---
Self care, urban evade, empathy, and WGLF, plus a key with obsession ring and holder. The clade build of teamwork
---
Basically this
---
You can turn the sensitivity to 100% which helps a little but would definietky benefit from being higher.
---
I think I remember reading somewhere that the devs are interested on increasing the max sensitivity.
---
I've posted at least 10 star wars memes on this sub. It just has so many useful templates!
---
It literally says ‚Äúpress m1 to attempt escape‚Äù.
---
The noobs are blameless here. Frogs 100% at fault.
---
Nice excuse.
---
Yellow eyed demon as the killer?
---
Fungoose is my favorite, hes a really cool dude and I always learn something when I watch him
---
So you're ignoring the nerfs to Spirit and Nurse that are being done and also the fact that it was universally agreed that Survivors were much stronger than Killers for a longggg long time.
---
This is such a great fucking idea.
---
Adam just vibing
---
On my first hook ever I thought it would get me off, then I thought pushing the struggle button faster would get me off tooüòÇ I was thinking it was like test your might in mortal kombat
---
Fredwart, billy bob, or myers.
---
We need somebody to release Google translated perk descriptions that work similar to the icon changes unless that's bannable.
---
I'll have to try upping the sensitivity 
---
I'm only rank 15 as survivor and killer but feel free to add me on Switch
---
Sw-3506-5456-0509
---
Billy as pig pls
---
im getting the same thing
---
Did you restart the game or anything?
---
Same, I just verified my game files and it let me in, so not sure if it's that or they're back up.
---
The Wiki shows how each perk has changed.
---
Yikes, I feel like there are several other good reasons for youtubers only uploading good clips.
---
For example, their viewers may not be good people and may downvote/leave bad comments/unfollow if the channel uploads losing gameplay.
---
I don't understand why anyone would let someone else win anything ever. Even kids need to "get gud" (or, more seriously, playing honestly teaches them integrity, and also gives them a legitimate end goal for improvement. It's acceptable to take a formal handicap, but losing on purpose by playing like shit is bullshit).
---
Literally, the only people in the entire world who should ever be given a win are Make a Wish kids. John Cena can throw the wrestling match against the 10 year old with terminal cancer, but that's it.
---
Seems like it just came back up for me. I've been trying for twenty minutes glad to know I wasn't the only one.
---
I usually go solo but I'll definietly make sure to add you.
---
they're back up
---
Hag's not the only one with nipples anymore
---
I mean in any case, id love to see it
---
It's working again for me now too. Had to kill the game with the task manager and restart it.
---
if you‚Äôre curious, you can go to the official dead by daylight wiki. select a perk you want to see and look at ‚Äúchange log‚Äù if it is there. if it‚Äôs still confusing i think you can search up the perk and add ‚Äúchanges‚Äù after it. probably will find it!
---
Nurse could‚Äôve been dealt with, Spirit was mindgames, you Can counter both of them by just playing smart, same goes for insta heals, if you‚Äôre good enough you should be able to catch a survivor that instahealed. Never said I ignored it. And realistically, if you have a good killer than understands the killer they play, and is good with juggling, theyre bound to beat the best of teams, survivors are only at their strongest when it‚Äôs a swf. And the nerfs to those two killers still make them top tier killers. Pink insta heals aren‚Äôt entirely viable anymore.
---
Old Freddy was literally m1 too. You're delusional.
---
Same. People in this community will shit ALL over you though for thinking this way. They love their made up rules and hand-holding. I stopped playing this game for a long time because I was getting reported and getting hate messages every time I would win.
---
We‚Äôll Make It, WGLF, Botany Knowledge, and BT/Deliverance
---
Full unhooking build
---
You act like they don't hear survivors moaning as well
---
The problem isn‚Äôt even that it shows people the escape button, it presents it as if it‚Äôs the only option to get off the hook. The tutorials are so fucking bad man
---
Im on ps4 and having no issues
---
Except otz everyone loves otz
---
Playing right now and have been for about 30 minutes [pc]
---
She holds more traps and even if triggered or used it stays there forever
---
Then have other killers be viable and not repeatedly nerfed
---
Isn't that just vommy mommy but you know, fire?
---
Didn't they change it awhile ago so nurses doesn't work with mending?
---
You can counter it by running iron will. If they decide to run stridor is up to them
---
Myers is still badass. Nothing beats tier 1 mirror myers on the game. He's jumpscare shit storm I take as much pleasure in using as aussie with a 16 pound cannon aimed at a emu.
---
It'd stay on the ground and zone out. Its a mix of clown, legion, and plague. Plague for the physics, Legion for the timer, and Clown for the zoning
---
add-ons were harder to learn but were significantly better when you learned the quirks (ie: omegablink), blinks didn't have charges and you could use all of your blinks, fatigue, then do it again
---
her base gameplay remains approximately the same though
---
i love playing this game, but god do i hate PLAYING this game.
---
How the hell did you even do that
---
*Spits out survivor head during mori*
---
"ITS...F*CKING...RAAAWWWW
---
her abs &lt;3
---
That just worked for me as well.
---
I've done it a handful of times. I'm awful at it.
---
That being said, I've never had one as awesome as popping up with unbreakable to do it. That's fucking awesome!
---
NERFS are when something is made weaker, like increasing cooldowns on abilities or reducing the charges you have of something. 
---
Alternatively, a BUFF is when something is increased to make an aspect stronger. Such as more charges of an item, or shorter cooldowns. 
---
Its all a part of balancing a player vs player type game. Updates bring buffs/nerfs to killers/perks/items. It keeps some killers/items/perks from overperforming. I'm sure either in this game or another you've come across something that was just too strong with little or no counterplay and thought, "Man, thats just so strong its not even fun to play against." Thats where nerfs come in. Or buffs for when stuff is just completely useless or not as strong as intended
---
People are wondering why I was using those perks. So I recently watched this monto video and decided to try it out. Let me clarify, I did NOT camp people on the hook. I used insidious after kicking a gen then waiting for them to come back and I would sometimes pull them of a gen. [vid ](https://youtu.be/apcH3A_ReTs)
---
my mum calls it "stupid game" because she always walks in when I throw someone on a hook, and she can hear the screaming through my head set
---
thanks! i have the same build but i‚Äôve been meaning to add something. now i‚Äôll be adding botany knowledge, how big is the speed difference with adding botany to we‚Äôll make it?
---
What about Billy as Leatherface but it's such a good costume that you can't tell until you see his chainsaw take off towards you?

Great job!

Nah, keep projecting tho
---
Thanks, will hope that save the best for last appears in shrine and will level up nurse for nurses calling, cheers :).
---
didnt the devs say they werent allowing the legion thing in the game?
---
We all will someday
---
Like one wise man once said "Compassion is the enemy, mercy defeats us".
---
Alert - Great to know the killer's location and sometimes even find about gens that you didn't know about.
---
Spine chill - If not a Tier 1 Myers, will tell when the killer maybe coming in your direction. Great to counter Pig, Ghostface and Spirit.
---
Calm Spirit - Trauma with the doctor. Haven't played much against him, but the few times were traumatazing. Will change it for "Bond" or "Empathy" as soon I learn to counter him.
---
Bothany Knowledge - Healing teamates at higher speed. I preffer "We will make it". But sometimes I am not the one who unhooks or my teamate will run away before i can heal them.
---
Get guud kid. 
---
Honestly practice with friends in private servers. It‚Äôs a feeling, like riding a bike, use the force, Luke.
---
so... nude cosmetics?
---
Why would you want to?
---
Wait is this Tumblr?
---
Too good to be true :)
---
Turn on the setting in PS4 to make it where your friends are the only people that can message you and the toxicity drops like crazy
---
WGLF?
---
Wait could it activate more than once?
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs through the patch notes and there are hundreds of them.
---
I just logged in fine, didn't play so maybe it's still down but it's weird if I could log in and work everything like normal if they were
---
What about the double tbag to thank a survivor for healing you. Is that acceptable?
---
I've had 2 matches in a row disconnect on PC.
---
Because I love the way it looks I already know this game by heart and I can tell what's going on it just looks soo cool
---
Wait, her model has nipples? 
---
*What the hell is going on*
---
Where gonna live forever.
---
Oh okay, I‚Äôll try that! Thank you for letting me know!
---
We are gonna live forever. A david king perk.
---
Something similar with me against a Wraith too
---
Fair enough, if you don't find an actual way to do that I guess you could always just squint hard while you play
---
Personally, i dont care about teabagging. It hasn't bothered me since COD4 and it's not about to start now. But that's not what this comment is about.
---
This is a comment that's a PSA about teabagging on the PTB right now. I've seen a lot of Oni's getting triggered about survivors teabagging them out in the open. The thing is, survivors aren't trying to be toxic by doing this. It's not crouching to taunt you; crouching while injured releases more blood orbs which gives you your power more. Survivors aren't trying to be disrespectful by this. We just want you to get your power more frequently so we can experience more power interactions for testing. So if a survivor is teabagging you in the open and waving come here, they probably aren't trying to be toxic, they're just trying to leave a phat pool of blood for you.
---
We're gonna live forever. 
---
The survivor's BBQ. For each SAFE unhook you do your end game BP is multiplied by 25%
---
boobs steve is cursed steve
---
Yep. The real low-poly nipples. More edgy and pointy, than all other edgy edges of her tits
---
I tried to save someone and I used an entire rare flashlight battery and couldn't get it to work üò≠
---
üòÇüòÇ fair enough
---
Go right then not super fast but fast and smooth turn and loop
---
Prove thyself, Leader, Vigil, Streetwise.
---
You are only allowed heal, unhook, and point at people that are doing gens.
---
This was obviously screenshotted immediately after the game started as there is a small window (3 seconds or so) before it kicks you and cancels the game. Nice try though but this won‚Äôt happen without it kicking you.
---
Oh forgot about david thanks
---
Yep: toxic survivors make themselves an easier target by standing there being toxic. Makes it easier to get the muscle memory developed before going into a proper chase
---
wait what? what happened to dg now lol?
---
Np mate!

Works fine for me and I played a few hours ago. Try uninstalling?

Tried that and I don‚Äôt want to delete it and then reinstall it that way because then I‚Äôll lose my saved data if it does work

Also, if you have it you should totally use I'm All Ears. I'm finding it super helpful, but if you don't then Stridor is almost as good
---
Lmaooo I don‚Äôt have friends

I‚Äôll try

I love getting this bug as it makes the game significantly harder. Great challenge and also a guessing game for skill checks as you can only hear them but can‚Äôt see them. It‚Äôs like a reverse huntress Lullaby

Hey, don't worry!I was just a fun little joke so you don't need to feel bad about it, besides I know you're just trying to make it more visible and I appreciate that!
---
Ok I‚Äôm going to try it
---
Dot focus just on survivors. Learn how to play killer as well. Even if you do main survivor, you‚Äôll learn how they act in the eyes on the killer. That way situations, you‚Äôll know how to get out of them better
---
Dance with thyself.
---
I've been running Detective's Hunch, Small Game,  Distortion and Stake out a bit lately. It's good when the killer is running Ruin and BBQ (Ranks 1-15 this is 90% of the time.)
---
Hope it works!
---
The only 360 you actually need is dodging a Billy chainsaw out in the open. You can do this one just by making a circle with the left stick. No camera movement required, just good timing and you'll dodge it every time. I usually look straight forward and do it off of sound cues, but this takes a bit better understanding of Billy's speed and timings.
---
Unless you're making highlight videos you don't really need to learn to 360 to be useful. It can extend some chases, but often you need to make them whiff 2-3 times before you can even make a pallet. If you want to improve Id work on optimizing looping and gen pressure.
---
Ok I just need to finish this game first
---
You forgot the part with
---
#SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I can semi loop but I get tricked by the short killers
---
Bruh if the killers were slower than the survivors there would be no threat from them unless you potato hard or play stupid. Imagine playing nurse and just running at everyone instead of blinking and that's how that would turn out.
---
Tru3
---
I‚Äôm off for the night but just add me, I‚Äôll be on this weekend.
---
Ok sounds good
---
And some want to play with their toxic red rank swf group and cry when they lose to one of the weakest killers. I'm trash, but the swf that lost to wraith is amazing lmao. No mercy!
---
I love these so much
---
D strike, head on, balanced landing, unbreakable
---
The kids that complain about Tbagging wouldnt have lasted 15 seconds in an old school MW2 lobby, y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know shit about toxicity
---
Because being able to walk up to a Survivor that the Killer just chased and hit twice to down and instantly pick them up to the Healthy State within a split second wasn't exactly what any sane person would call "balanced."
---
The pixels don't move, egg head, getattaheeee! 
---
"If a few pixels changing colour disturbs you, maybe you shouldn't be playing."
---
Shit, I feel like this could be less verbose.
---
Did you miss the part where i said if it got more content? And that the reason why I play DBD now is only because they get more content? Or did you just skip that part entirely?
---
It is getting Undetectable in the next patch.
---
People are worried it's going to break Legion.
---
One of my unique gen builds. Iron will, poised, dark sense, adrenaline. Works best when you're getting chased.
---
Would still be fine if it didn‚Äôt deplete the medkit on use imo
---
I know. But I guess I just wanted official confirmation
---
Ooh, hadn't seen that in the notes. Cool beans - perhaps that was the reason for some of the Legion changes that had people shouting "*ANOTHER* nerf?!"
---
He ain't even stressin ngl
---
Pull a ghostface and just get the likeness so they can write their own character as him, problem solved
---
I love it! I also am obsessed with Laurie's face reflecting on his knife
---
Rank 7 my first!
---
Weird cause I just played a match, 3 survivors 4 gens done and couldn't find hatch until another survivor was killed.
---
I hate to say it but it should be 3 most the time and ends up being 2 because  Even though they have ample opportunity people don't get you off the hook fast enough so you reach the 2nd phase which essencially takes away your 2nd hook
---
So they gave a survivor that they intentionally made to look "pretty" nipples. Do they just WANT to feed the SFM porn part of the DBD community?
---
this sounds really cool! i‚Äôll have to try this one day, hopefully my team does gens.
---
Let me check your vibe
---
Yeah. I get more toxicity than anything else in my messages, but getting stuff like this even when the survivor loses may be one of the things that keeps me playing and caring. He had no hard feelings about the loss, knew he made a mistake, and we could both talk without ego swelling. He was civil, kind, and I hope I see him up there in red ranks with me in the future.
---
i‚Äôve been meaning to try a small game &amp; distortion build, thanks!
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
I‚Äôm honestly wondering if this affects the potential for a 2v8 mode in DBD, I know they tested it at one point in DG but idk if the fact that that game died makes it more or less likely we‚Äôll get it in DBD. 
---
Also, I‚Äôm glad they found new positions within BHVR for the DG team.
---
In addition to what someone else said, consider using wake-up.  It may not seem like a lot in the description, but that increase in gate opening speed is amazing.

Your data is account based on the console you use. You won't lose any data of in game progression or cosmetics, at the very worst you'd lose achievements but I don't think the switch even has those
---
I read it wrong it says it doesn‚Äôt delete your data
---
I'd love to see them
---
this sounds really funny, thanks!

I feel so close to you two..........

Nope once per game it didn't swap obsession back then

Lol I thought so

This is absolutely amazing. You are truly an amazing artist.

wdym? you literally got outplayed and outsmarted

They're officially pulling the plug on it. Servers will stay up at least through the end of the year.

This is the content i come here for

Oh shit 100 wiggle points :(

this is so cool! i‚Äôll try swapping quick &amp; quiet for dance with me so that i can dash away after the head on stun. hopefully i‚Äôll have enough time to slowly get in the locker. this would be awesome for basement hooks!

---
People subbed to the newsletter got a good bye email today.
---
&gt; Today, it is with a heavy heart that we‚Äôre announcing the end of Deathgarden‚Äôs development.
---
The game will be playable till the end of the year.
---
this is cool
---
If you try all these tips and still can't 360 don't worry. A lot of killers got used to 360s even on console, and 360'ing can actually make you lose distance. Just running in a straight line after being hit or running straight to a loop is probably the most optimal method of wasting as much time as possible, at least against non braindead killers. A lot of people underestimate the power of running in a straight line when in a dead area.
---
Huntress more OP than Spirit
---
Pls nerf
---
i understand the need to nerf if completely but i feel there could have been a better way to do that than the one they chose.
---
It‚Äôs never directly stated taht the Entity was the one to do that even the. In the lore it said the entity saw potential in Rins anger
---
i respect your opinion but i don‚Äôt think it is that serious.  
---
t-bagging has gotten a new connotation and you can‚Äôt really blame people for being insensitive if they press a button. a lot of the time it is being silly with the killer or your teammates, very rarely in dead by daylight does someone t-bag over your body. most of the time it‚Äôs just a ‚Äúthanks for the heal.‚Äù and most of all, it‚Äôs a game. i come from a military family and i can say for sure it‚Äôs not so serious. people who have served really could not care less about what the hell steve harrington is doing on dead by daylight at the exit.
---
Other than report them after game, you could try to get their attention via the forums to get some attention... or even you could try to email them.
---
Never had this happen so I'm not sure what I would do or how I would react
---
It‚Äôs for more human accurate cosmetics. Pretty weird the they actually modeled the nipples, but my guess for proper breast placement for shirts and other clothes.
---
Just played a game where the hatch was right next to a hook. As one survivor died it opened and I shut it in the face of the last one as he bled out. 10/10 fun game
---
All 5 people farming isn't bannable. Working with the killer to kill other survivors is.
---
A power with rng like that wouldn‚Äôt really be fun for either side. Sometimes you just get fucked as survivor, and sometimes they literally can never hit you. It‚Äôs why Pig is pretty bad, rng is never a good addition to a killers kit unless it heavily favors them.
---
You know that there are more than one oni in japanese folklore, right?
---
you are doing god's work, keep the innocent souls out of this hell
---
MEGGG PLS, OR HUNTRESS!!!!
---
The problem is that when they're brand new they think the 'attempt to escape' thing is what will get them free.  Then they might not also quite understand the context clues for mashing their spacebar/controller button.
---
Oh hell no, I wasn't pressing is THAT fast. Just tapping the A button normally. I've pressed it as fast as I could before and nothing happened. 
---
Unless it lagged hard on the hosts end, and suddenly read my inputs all together. Which would mean you could kill people with a lagswitch.üò±
---
Nah hes pretty average but very nice guy
---
Eh, death hook, last survivor, might as well not wiggle. Don't know how the killer acts, might be better for ya.
---
it's obviously not farming
---
Yes that‚Äôs what I want but there are better ways to buff solo q like making bond/kindred/empathy part of the survivor base kit
---
Huh. That's neat.
---
Got called a sweaty killer and I don‚Äôt even know what that means. Can someone explain what does sweaty killer mean?
---
Did you report them after the game? One of the options is "Refusing to partake in normal gameplay." Other than that, good luck.
---
Nuuuuu! üò± They'll kill me! They always kill me! I don wanna die! üò≠
---
Yeah I was. I know how to get it for PC, I just wish there was a way to get it on PS4, as that's where most of my friends play dbd. I'm the only one who also owns it for PC unfortunately.
---
BUT, other days, it was working fine, what happened now?
---
Ah ok I doubt they'll release it for console but there is hopes of deathgarden coming to console so the mask might also come
---
So everybody starts to only play one or two of the characters because their passives are much better than the others.
---
No.
---
Still keeps you off of a hook for a minute, bring unbreakable and you punish them for leaving you on the ground
---
Oh I thought it was a consistent issue. Could be server maintenance or something?
---
The reboot wasn't enough to bring in folks and keep them playing.
---
I believe this is a good effort.
---
Think of it like this: They added in 2 new instant heal perks, both were not OP, and in some cases it was really a cool interaction with both. Players could use them like insta heals, but with a process to trigger it.
---
I think they wanted to go that way with the add ons.
---
Thanks. I thought I‚Äôd try sending BHVR an email (if possible) since these guys have clips of themselves doing this to multiple people. I reported them all to Xbox, but don‚Äôt know if that will actually do anything.
---
Previously, In my draft, I did list Pig with Bubba, Spirit, and Doctor, but I had to watch her Mori and idk I just thought her Mori wasn't that interesting.
---
But, I guess it's a useful Mori - it's quick and straight to the point.
---
its happening to you?
---
Holy shit! Great fucking job. The best peice of dbd art I've seen by far, I've been playing for a year
---
It‚Äôs a red container the says vampire blood on it. Is there a way to private message? I could send you a picture, I‚Äôm really not good with reddit lol just started using it
---
Listen here smart guy... you see more fucking ghostface, and wraith player then you see nurses at red ranks. In fact it's been a week since I last versed a nurse so the idea that people only play the strongest is idiotic and clearly a unthought out statement...
---
Huh
---
In reality, they‚Äôre Joe and Susi
---
I feel bad for you straight guys. Girls and gays get beautifully-drawn porn and all y'all get is shitty SFM. :(
---
Do you have any verification of this? This does *not* seem like something BHVR would do. 
---
If it is real, do you have a link to the OG survivor underwear models?
---
I mean... Rancor exists
---
Ah, a Man of Culture I see.
---
Just an obsession version of alert with more strength behind it and a little set back my dude.
---
Not really they just shut down deathgarden
---
Don't get used to it.
---

---
Honestly, rather than this it'd be better if we had more perks that punsihed people for being the Obsession. Right now being the Obsession means you're the safest person in the trial (STBFL, PWYF, Dying Light) since no one uses the Obsession Bad perks (Rancor and Remember Me).
---
Nemesis and Furtive Chase are cool ideas, but we seriously need some perks that cause you to load into the game, see the Entity Marker, and not know if you're fucked or not.
---
Thank you that fixed it
---
No Mither really should be a counter to Oni tbh
---
Chill bro it aint that deep
---
I literally have irrefutable evidence that the survivor was abusing the Glitch
---
ur survivor suffers from depression
---
wew these are cute
---
Art by me. I‚Äôm still waiting for Pinhead and Goth cosmetic collection.
---
You've already made one Survivor drastically better with a universal passive as opposed to two who only have that passive against one of the total number of Killers....
---
Claudette's passive would be great against any killer, even if there were 20 in the game. The other two don't even factor in the majority of time.

Well no it wouldnt prock pop, but theres no way you dont run pop with it.
---
Good dead hard at the end!
---
Before matchmaking, I had a really bad game as trapper against a team that was a SWF and definitely above my skill level. I also just began playing trapper and so I had brown tier add-ons and maybe one perk. 
---
I was slammed so hard that they pitied me and one let me hook and then they sacrificed themselves on hook, while another remained until timer ran out and killed them.
---
Post-game they said I had good trap placements. I just got screwed in terms of experience (they knew where to look for traps) and the traps being bright yellow didn't help either.
---
It was the kindest thing anybody has done for me when I've been playing killer.
---
But how many Bubba's in high rank do you see?
---
The question wasn't if it's possible to 4k in Red Ranks. The question wasn't if those Killers can beat Scot/Tofu/Otz/Tru3. The question is how many of them do you see.
---
And you don't see a lot of low tier killers in red ranks. The big difference is that Survivors are all the same and can be carried by perk choices (A survivor with Lithe/Dead Hard, Adrenaline, DS, and Unbreakable/Borrowed Time will do a shit ton better than the same survivor without them), a low tier Killer requires you to be good at the game to cover up their weaknesses.
---
And I'm not saying you can't be good at Survivor without those perks. I'm also not saying that the only difference between Green and Red rank survivors is perk choices. But I am saying that Survivors have a lot more crutches than killers do for the players who can't actually play the game.
---
Plz BHVR, goth Spirit and goth Nurse skin!!!!
---
Not really, that's a huge waste of bloodpoints if they want all perks on Feng now.
---
yEs!!!!!!!
---
They weren‚Äôt farming.
---
Honestly my day has been shitty. The girl I fell in love with since 7th grade has her birthday in 2 days now. For several years I've gotten her a gift for her birthday and Christmas, never missing a single day. This year though, I can't afford a gift for her. So I wrote her a letter which is pretty lame, because I'm pretty sure I've said everything I could say to her in those letters and I've probably repeated what is now a cliche to her. She never really shared the same feelings as I did, but I couldn't care less. Just knowing I was doing something good for her made me happy. Despite all the sadness I feel not being able to be with her, those moments are worth all the pain. So you can imagine how I felt when I knew I couldn't do anything for her, and I knew it was the last year we would ever be in the same continent. Whenever I see her smile, where I felt happiness, I feel jealousy and despair. Because I know that I'm not the reason for that, and it's something I'll never see ever again. btw this is a shitpost

Working with the killer is bannable. Don't respond if you don't know what you're talking about
---
Dumbass, all killers are m1.
---
Should we tell them?
---
These are so cute. I love Plague! It makes me wish that next Halloween we get some ‚Äúcheesy‚Äù cosmetics similar in style for survivors. Like Halloween costumes or party outfits. I love this style.
---
I just don't even with trapper so always reach out to the survivors
---
By playing. Maybe watching streamers or looking at some of the guides that have been posted here. Windows of Opportunity is a godsend and it helped me hit rank 1.
---
Maybe leave him at 60% charge when he picks people up so the pick up isn't so damaging?
---
Two things will happen in a match:
---
1) You slow down to destroy all the totems, a secondary objective, to make sure NOED doesn't pop
---
2) You rush generators with no regard or respect to the killer's prospective strategy (maybe they're going for a late game build) and boom, Blood Warden + NOED. Ruin is essential because it DOES slow the game down (Great Checks don't grant bonuses, Good Checks regress slightly, or survivors are hunting down the totem).
---
no, seriously, lets assume I'm clueless:
---
now please explain to me how what I just spent 3 minutes (which I wouldn't mind having back) helps either the survivors or the killer?
---
maybe the survivors got some chase points?
---
I don't need to break pallet. I need hook and I need more hatchets. 
---
Me get more hatchets now.
---
Calm Spirit isn't Killer specific, it's main point is being able to walk around without disturbing the crows, the doctor bit is just a bonus. Likewise, Slippery Meat and Saboteur are for hooks, not Trapper's traps.
---
On top of that, everyone has been saying since at *least* Legion (when I started playing) that we desperately need a ton of perk reworks to bring the more useless ones (Technician, Territorial Imperative to name two) up to "actually usable" status.
---
The problem with giving Survivors universal abilities is that it just comes down to who has the best universal perk, and suddenly a character is complete trash tier because their perk is the worst. Why would I play as Dwight when Nancy does something better?
---
The problem with killer specific perks is A) everyone has to level up and get every perk on a brand new survivor the moment a specific Killer becomes meta, which is annoying as hell and B) They've already shown with Stranger Things that they're willing to break the 1:1 ratio of Survivors and Killers. Does Demogorgon just have to tough it out because he's got two Survivors? What if we get a chapter with one Survivor but two Killers?
---
Tell you what; if you can make 20 passive abilities, one for each survivor including Yui, and one or two aren't strictly stronger than the rest, I'll concede that passive abilities on survivors are a good idea.
---
I did this except without the messaging. Eventually the two survivors left got the hint after I kept downing them and carrying them to my traps. Once they caught on they deliberately stepped in them repeatedly until I carried them to a gen and opened the gates for them and let them go.
---
Dropping items at the end of the game can be a sign of respect to a killer. It's like the opposite of a t-bag at the exit gates.
---
Im high right now and can say its pretty funny
---
This is fucking great
---
Well no, I wouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôd leave. Being faster than the killer isn‚Äôt fun, it ruins the game. 
---
He may not have meant to intentionally abuse a broken game mechanic, however, when he decided to be a clicky clicky teabagging cunt, I assumed he did it purposely. 
---
Clearly though, you‚Äôre one of the type of knobheads that would also happily accept the cheat.
---
I don't see how it's that different from you getting mad about me calling it a mace.
---
If you thought a Monster slashing you was scary, wait till that Monster starts making you make a ravioli
---
I like the pig, but I rarely play killer.
---
Ohhhh, even the demogorgon got one! I love it! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Farmer John is my favorite, when I first started playing this game I watched a lot of slow the game down just a little bit videos but when I finally got good enough to be in matches with him you know we have differences in opinions. Most of the yt dudes dc on videos and I honestly think it sets a bad example. Farmer John is the best win lose or draw he‚Äôs funny never tilted and just kinda does the damn thing.
---
Hey can I catch a hatchet with my face plz?
---
Thank you! I think even he needs some nice clothes‚ú®
---
Hello! :D

They have cheap servers
---
I said it happens randomly. If my controller was busted this would happen to me all the time. I've seen other people fail the struggle all month but this is the 1st time it's happened to me since I got  back to DBD.
---
And there's no way I suddenly missed 3 inputs in a row to trigger the fail.
---
Spirit mains be like

Ruining the gameplay for others is why it's funny to them. It gives them some sort of satisfaction to make others upset.
---
But... *why?* Why did BHVR model her nipples? Is there a reason?
---
"I am looking away"
---
Dude, I've played for over 1,000 hours and just hit rank 1 last reset lmao it's all good. And it's the same for me. I'm either a god looper or a potato. No inbetween lol
---
What's the order in first row, second row, third row, and fourth row?
---
I'm just now getting better at it with 875 hours or so. I can only really ever do it at pallets tho
---
Shit.. Lol, are you on PC? Might have to change my Claudette skins now. Haha
---
They‚Äôve gotten lazy with bloody cosmetics as of late. Ghostfaces mask has like no actual blood and just some red veins here and there and all his alt weapons are bloodier than his actual bloody knife.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

Aura readings, and you can get addons for keys that allow you to open the hatch
---
The optimization is really weird. The actual game itself runs better than DbD on my computer, but the MENUS lag immensely. The game nearly crashes changing characters.

I keep forgetting Nurse's vault animation looks so hilarious because she never does it.

Now any plans for Oni? Straight , Gay , Bi?
---
Any plans to incorporate his giant bonk hammer?
---
Anything on the table at this time?
---
Happened to me thought it was because I was running fixated and sprint burst since the game before didn‚Äôt run those, but it‚Äôs just random
---
Sae Nijima Plague, even if that wasnt who you were going for I love it! Youre so talented!!
---
I would love to be able to play Pig or Legion and not suffer every patch.
---
Windows and doorways. Don't just place them in random spots in the open. Most survivors, when found, are going to immediately head towards the closest loop/pallet. Trapping those areas before you target a survivor give you a better chance at capturing the survivor.
---
On their post about it, they said that they relocated the Deathgarden team to other projects, both announced and unnanounced. So maybe something good will come out of that game's death.
---
I took a red Mori to this twitch streamer and his friends as Spirit and it felt as good as morning sex.
---
My experience as well, my killer queues at rank 13 are instant, but the ranks are a little mismatched. I regularly get 10-8s. Survivor queues at 9 hae been really bad for me.
---
That's fair! Maybe you'll kill me someday : D Though if you do please make it quick
---
set messages to friends only
---
When teleporting to a generator, if it‚Äôs running, look around for a bit. Often people will know when you are teleporting and try to walk away as to not leave scratchmarks, and will hide behind objects to not get chased
---
Yes they did change some textures on haddonfield to be brighter apparently. I also changed the brightness myself though.
---
That plague outfit reminds me of Shadow Sae from Persona 5
---
''how to get face camped''
---
I mean that‚Äôs a solution sure, but the fact I‚Äôd need to do that just to avoid people being toxic is saddening. I also like when randoms message me in other games, or after the rare amazing DbD game. I get your opinion though, thank you for sharing it
---
I‚Äôm still new but I manage to kill all 4 sometimes. Basically just play with them around pallets. They always think I‚Äôm going to blink and I just circle back for them or blink to the other side of the pallet. Don‚Äôt forget to check lockers. I recommend at least getting her to level 5or 10 before starting her tho.
---
You‚Äôre the kind of brain dead player that runs around doing anything but a gen while a competent survivor loops the killer
---
You probably heard the crickets during the offering screen, yes?
---
Yeah, the game is drunk, like, all the time.
---
Yes to all of these. Especially the dapper demo.
---
I'll check him out, thank you!!
---
Sad deathgarden died but it is free to play now on steam until it shuts down by the end of the year. I played two rounds before stopping. Worth the download because I obtained the meg mask and trapper mask cosmetics for Dead by Daylight.

As for women I'm thinking Plague and Huntress.

There's an add-on that shows you where the blinks will put you. I don't remember what exact it is called but it is called a plaid flannel or something.

you realize his mask is literally apart of the map right? and also the oni is not originated from dbd lmao
---
Yep, definitely PC. I don't tunnel them. But if I am in a chase and I see one, I usually switch. Most times they just blend in so well and are annoying to find. Especially lobbies of 4 blendettes. Those are the worst lol.

what is even happening here

dex is for the weak

ur cool man. do u have more cool stories to share?

Honest to god I lose the will to play when I go up against navy seals. Like sometime when I chase some dude for less then 40 seconds and 2-3 gens pop without gen perks or toolboxes I just afk or quit out. Its completely unfun and bullshit and shows just how terrible human nature is. "But its fun.........for me" yeah fuck you SWF on comms.

I‚Äôve only briefly watched some of his videos, but he seems very entertaining while not being uber competitive (like True, for example). This is a moronic reason to get banned. Can it get appealed? I doubt it since it‚Äôs only three days, but what a load of bs.

Replying to their emails is the only option that I am aware of. If I discover another way I will post it in a reply here.

The other keys can naturally open the hatch, the broken key can‚Äôt
---
Legion has cool perks its just a shame that two are based on mechanics that arent really used. Stuff like lockers or bodyblocking arent really things most survivors utilize so bringing an entire perk on the off chance they do just feels bad. 
---
Maybe we‚Äôll see an increase in Mad Grit gamers after people start using that new Yui perk and things like MoM.
---
I‚Äôd definitely trap some key loops/vaults but not all of them. Don‚Äôt spend the beginning of the map directly heading towards loops to block off. I play Freddy at least a few times a day, I‚Äôve found way more success just tossing down my snares mid chase. Have a few set down, but save some for yourself to use on a loop. Can cut the loop down in no time if you use it mid chase. 
---
Also, Dream Pallets are tons of fun! Snares are better, but if you‚Äôre looking to just have fun, they‚Äôre totally great to just fuck around with.
---
I tried for a galaxy effect but it didn't really work
---
Yeah. I play on PS4 and get messages all the time. Two days ago I actually got a message from a survivor telling me that he reported me for using exploits to win the game. When I asked him what ‚Äúexploits‚Äù I used he said that moonwalking was exploiting the game. He said that the red stain existed to give survivors time to react, and that by hiding my red stain I was abusing the game somehow.
---
I‚Äôm rank 1 btw and they were all also red ranks
---
I literally looked up "dbd generator" to get an image.
---
what
---
Upvote JUST for Myers.
---
Can't
---
Wow that‚Äôs next level ridiculous
---
If every competitive multiplayer dev team balanced on what was easier, pvp games would look a loooooooot more different right now

You can't. It's a guessing game
---
IM SO SICK OF TEAMMATES PANICKING AT THE SLIGHTEST HINT OF A HEARTBEAT JUST WORK ON THE GEN STOP RUNNING IF THEY COME YOU CAN RUN BUT STOP PANICKING SO EARLY, SIDE RANT IF IM RUNNING THE KILLER PLEASE FOR THE LOVE IF GOD JUST WORK ON A GEN IM SICK OF WASTING THE KILLERS YOME ONLY TO FIND OUT MY TEAM WAS BUSY HUGGING LOCKERS!
---
Too much effort chief
---
I wished they'd give people who bought the game originally more cosmetics, especially since you can play Deathgarden free now to get them for free. At the very least they could make Legacy versions of the Trapper and Meg masks.
---
But I mean they cucked people out of $500 cosmetics I doubt they'll be nice to people who spent $30.
---
You can still have a memey match and have all of the survivors dead, since I‚Äôm sure none of them would have cared to living if they were there to f around. It also goes for being a survivor, playing against a killer who sweats massively.
---
the messaging interface is so laggy and unintuitive that by the time they load up your profile they forget why they were mad
---
Pretty much everyone in my game had no mither, saboteur, and a tool box, and prevented me from hooking anyone a majority of the game
---
Nope, all totems are randomized so you have no idea which Hex perk is where.
---
Yes, but THOTs bring in good viewership and money for Twitch, so they'll only ever ban them if the pushback is extreme.
---
It‚Äôs also horrible for killers like billy and trapper
---
yeah Meg‚Äôs mask is sick
---
Am I the only survivor who actually enjoys the map and has escaped plenty on it?
---
old as hell. dating back to haddonfield
---
Holy shit that's amazing, you have some serious talent!
---
‚ÄúDodging‚Äù aka in this instance as dcing. 
---
Cool you are a awesome guy by letting your team down! 
---
Say HOORAH to selfishness!
---
that's pretty annoying
---
I‚Äôm a Plague Main if that skin comes into the game. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Optimal
---
Ok thats fucking hilarious. I hope this meme never dies
---
Joker clown is the only one that I personally wouldn‚Äôt want.  I especially love Plague, Spirit and Bubba! Very cool!!!!
---
Can we also get rid of farm maps?
---
Imagine dedicating a game to be ur reddit username
---
????
---
Just played with a guy that had that name. I chuckled a bit
---
Can I opt out of haddonfield and the game?
---
Trappers an old design, he needs a rework his ability doesn't apply enough pressure to keep up with gen speeds.
---
Balanced Landing is easily the worst exhaustion perk after this change. Lol at ‚Äúit got a fucking buff too‚Äù. Yeah, remove the stagger penalty when exhausted but your character doesnt go ‚ÄúWOAH‚Äù when falling so it got ‚Äúbuffed‚Äù. y dont even believe that bullshit so why are you even saying it lol
---
By the way, downvoting someone who doesnt agree with you doesnt make you right. I know you‚Äôre a kid so you feel good pressing the blue arrow button but damn thats sad man.
---
wow, you must be a really fun survivor to play with and against
---
Weakens survivor‚Äôs health bars to red so he can use a poke ball to catch them.
---
Wow that amazing and I love nnn
---
Should have added BONK.mp3
---
To be honest if indoor maps exist the survivors can have one map that is very open. (Or two considering haddonfield)
---
Some maps inherently benefit killers while others survivors. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with that AS LONG as it exists for both. 
---
Wanna nerf cold win?? Sure go ahead. But be sure to add more balance to ALL the indoor maps then.
---
So gothic I like it.
---
...Nice
---
Thank youüñ§
---
spirit
---
You can do a pseudo Goth nurse with her black wedding dress and the red hair blindfold
---
I only play killer and I despise all indoor maps
---
I got one just one question why does the legion get sweater but the other killer don‚Äôt imagine Michael Stalking you in a Christmas sweater or ghostface or even huntress having a sweater
---
Oh yeah for sure. I play 50/50 I know what its like with indoor maps. The only acceptable one is Hawkins. The other ones suck dick for survivors
---
Nice.
---
he is surprisingly bad dude, he is no Monto or Tru3
---
There is? I haven't been instahealed yet. I've watched monto get instahealed and there was nothing.
---
Joker clown would be so cool
---
I actually enjoyed it, it was fun.
---
It seems a very small amount of blendettes know what to do when they get found lol.
---
For survivors, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, and Borrowed Time.
---
For killer, it depends because every killer is different and different perks have synergy with each killer‚Äôs power. However, the most commonly used perks are Hex: Ruin, BBQ and Chilli,  Nurse‚Äôs Calling and Pop Goes The Weasel.
---
It also takes an hour for you to die on the hook due to your life being slow and painful.
---
They know they couldn‚Äôt prevent the comms completely so they just allow it.
---
hey, I‚Äôve seen this meme concept before. I made a ‚ÄúNo Mother‚Äù meme like a month ago and you did it.. just way better
---
Huntress üëÄ I see you, Anna üëÄ
---
Mori's suck because they usually remove 2/3 of someones game:
---
Killer hooks survivor 1. 
---
Survivor 1 gets unhooked.
---
Killer goes straight for survivor 1 and downs him
---
Killer mories
---
What did he do to deserve punishment
---
Puked their brains out, missed opportunity
---
God has nothing to do with this.
---
We play because we have to
---
I love Ohmwrecker. He isn't godly, but he is fun to watch. I don't see the same stuff with him every game, which I like!
---
Are you 3rd grade
---
Yw
---
Not as much as you do.
---
As much as I love watching Monto sometimes he seems kinda like a dick and I don't think I would enjoy playing against him
---
Then he could be nerfed first week of release like every other killer!
---
the only issue with that argument is there are currently 3 indoor maps in the game, Gideon, Lerys, and Hakwins. 
---
Out of those three, Gideon is a ridiculously strong survivor map with probably the highest density of ultra safe pallets of any map in the entire game. Lerys is a complete crapshoot with RNG so you can either end up with 18 windows connected into each other with no possible way for a Killer even with Bloodlust 3 to catch up or it can just spawn 2 super unsafe pallets and that's all you get as a Survivor. And Hawkins, while I will say is Killer sided, isn't terribly so and a good Survivor team can still mop the floor with any low tier killer on it.
---
I only read the opening sentence... you do realise how long it takes to find the hatch most times right? Especially when you're looking before it opens... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah. 
---
And with the recent instaheal nerf too I'm certain he'd be a lot better to play. The Spine Chill meta might be a bit of a problem though, but new Dying Light on him would have been great.
---
It's interesting to think about how he'd interact with the current state of the game.
---
Lol first this, then his starship blew up during a pressure test! But it was the mark 1 which was never going to fly and his vehicle looks more like a concept vehicle than a production vehicle. 
---
Looks like someone put the wrong glass in...
---
That Huntress is pretty waifu.
---
Egg Meg
---
You cant, but you can deliberately defend one of them in hopes that its haunted ground.
---
Using title as caption...
---
Me when bloodlust kicks in or a survivor dead hards
---
It‚Äôs simple, Ghostface takes steroids.
---
Meanwhile, I'm sitting here with my shitty nurse hoping for the day I get an ebony mori in my bloodweb
---
Well the survivors seem to think killers arent supossed to be strong so...
---
i love that you call it humping LMFAO
---
OkBoomer.
---
Tell me how you walked in the snow, uphill both ways.
---
Dapper Trapper. Right fucking now.
---
Hey if they want that hatch, they‚Äôve gotta earn it fair and square.
---
If I just hand it to them, they‚Äôll never learn how to get it on their own.
---
Haha it's all good. Dont die on us man
---
I'm so confused, aren't you supposed to help your teammate you just unhooked? Lol
---
BOTTOM TEXT
---
Some of these would fit perfectly into some kind of "Valentines Day Massacre" DLC. Nice job
---
I don‚Äôt care how much It would cost, I would absolutely buy that joker clown cosmetic.
---
That was indeed the joke
---
Gonna take a lot more than that to take me out, I‚Äôm far too stubborn.
---
(record scratch) (freeze frame) Yup, that‚Äôs me. You‚Äôre probably wondering how I got into this situation.
---
10/10 best idea
---
Just gals bein' pals
---
what is this deviant art junk......
---
Well, because I'm a solo survivor and the game seems to be balanced around SWF and comms so at least let me get the comms part.
---
I ship Julie x Susie. Hardcore.
---
These are all incredible!
---
But the (Wraith?) one next to Ghostface is probably my favorite. So sinister. It gives me Deathgarden's Stalker vibes too.
---
Amazing art as always. &lt;3
---
hey the perk isn‚Äôt working properly for me what do i do
---
Yes, hence why I included add-on changes/additions that would also make it more easy to find
---
balanced to make distance
---
 self care to heal myself 
---
adreniline no need to explain 
---
prove thyself gen rushing
---
Kinda has a gothic feel to it, I like em‚Äô
---
They say that because every single killer thats been released has gotten a unnecessary nerf because of people whining.
---
I bet you that when he goes into his blood rage that the prestige cosmetics look WAY more badass, like with glowing veins running across his body and stuff, because with his base cosmetic he gets a ton of glowy bits on his body and armor and his horns and teeth grow to be bigger whenever he enters blood rage. I'm certain the prestige outfits follow this pattern.
---
It‚Äôs annoying as fuck since the blind duration lasts forever and I have no idea where they went since I don‚Äôt have headphones.
---
Who is bottom left?
---
On the ptb yes, so we'll have it fixed December 3rd
---
It would be cool but it wouldn't be all that fair
---
That‚Äôs kinda the point of blinding at pallets... and it‚Äôs not the survivor‚Äôs faults that you don‚Äôt have headphones.
---
Always had fun for an hour or two when I booted DGBH. The problem boiled down to getting bored of Runner, switching over to Hunter and getting absolutely steamrolled when I just couldn't find anyone.
---
Hunter always seemed underpowered, then every 5 or so matches you'd get a godlike Hunter that executes your entire team in under 30 bloods.
---
A stomping game with very little to do, too similar maps and a gameplay that hooks for an hour at a time, then you forget to play for a month. Sad to see it go though, hope BHVR's next outing will be as fun while also being retentive.
---
realtable
---
I didn't give a single idea for its balance. How are you already saying it's unfair?
---
Yes the moris do need some type of rework to them. I like button combos, but they shouldn't be a challenge at all. Once you get to kill someone you've already earned it. So just pay attention and you'll do fine. I love the idea of multiple animations for the killers as well. The moris can really capture the killer's true properties and personality in some cases we need more of that.
---
I was already running a one blink nurse because I refused to play killer, but now that I am finally putting bloodpoints there I take the add-on that makes her movement speed insane and just APPEAR and then wreck faces. I'm a baby killer, but I'm getting a lot of mileage out of it
---
I am absolute ass at tracking. Old Freddy filled that weakness of mine pretty well so I did good with him. I kinda miss him but new Freddy ain‚Äôt bad either.
---
Its necrophilia if im dead inside tho?
---
Not good, unclear as to whether the initial landing is effected by the stagger reduction (it does), makes it sound like the noise reduction is a constant passive (I don't think it is).
---
I have this exact problem wtf
---
Susies and Micheals are the ones i really need
---
Thank you very much!
---
It feels more dynamic than DBD with better stealth options for Runners than Survivors and the Hunters feeling more powerful than Killers.
---
The gameplay loop is ultimately too shallow to hold your interest for more than an hour at a time.
---
Idk if it‚Äôs just me but I feel like the basement hatch never spawns anymore.
---
Yo when the fuck did the entity pull a hot topic into his realm. Awesome art and designs btw. Wraith looks fucking metal and I love it.
---
The wraith is straight up amazing and far creepier than his normal skin
---
That was a prop made for the movie the ‚Äúfather death‚Äù costume shown in scream 1 is not the same as the fun world costume
---
Plague is like the rarest killer I see right above clown. I respect it, plague was hard for me to use, she's got kind of an awkward playstyle that somehow works for everyone but myself
---
I like exactly 4 of these.
---
Joker clown may or may not be one of them.
---
Your loss.
---
&gt;:( perhaps
---
The # of kills dont matter, the point is that memey matches aren't fun after 30 seconds, because nobody is playing the game.
---
That obviously hit wdym
---
That Leatherface looks really cool. Good job, mate
---
I love the goth look.
---
I FORGOT TO BRING BBQ AND CHILI AND HAD TO PLAY A GAME WITHOUT IT  
---
THAT'S IT
---
Oh, well either way I‚Äôm glad it got changed.
---
[Nice]
---
Hillbilly I think
---
I like all but the entity blocking for 15 seconds flat rate. I'd say if you're in the killer's terror radius it blocks for 5 seconds enough to get another hit at least, or get them down if they're injured.
---
That's just the famous "Tier 4 Myers Stalking" add-on. It shows an afterimage of you, and if he hits that, you take the damage, duh.
---
Apparently jakes perk counteracts the screaming but i do think it's pretty stupid for the build up to be nigh unstoppable. Especially if he has the addon to increase its range (I'm actually a doc main because i've had games held hostage, Whispers and Doc now hook their mori'd corpses (I don't actually mori). But it could use some type of weakness. I also disagree with the hag traps pulling your camera.
---
Legion is excellent at having survivors waste time by mending and then healing. Especially if you run Sloppy Butcher and have good routes, he's good at wasting time. Compared to someone like Trapper, who is more of a territorial killer and generally sticks to a small area, he needs ruin to slow down the game as much as possible.
---
At least let me whack down the fucking corn
---
SWF would make the killer useless. Also using an offering where all survivors start together would make him useless.
---
Ea, pay 10 dollars for the *get hooked more than once and live* package
---
I use Nvidia shadowplay. Don't really notice any issues in performance but may depend on the settings you choose. I have mine set to record up to the past 5 minutes.
---
I was going to comment that. I'm pretty sure he was trying to close in on the injured survivors, and hitting Claudette would waste too much time.
---
I'm in love with all of these, especially Susie's and Rin's.
---
What maps do you consider bad for survivor?
---
Huh neat
---
Used to go a hell of a lot further than that let me tell you.
---
What did we have originally, 5? 6 blinks?
---
**üÖ±Ô∏èonk **
---
Is that not literally impossible
---
Adding more visuals without better optimization would turn consoles into flamethrowers.
---
ENDURING, ENDURING, ENDURING
---
**BECOME** ***UNSTOPPABLE***
---
Azezeal
---
did he dc after that
---
Simple answer is to just *not*, as non-lunge killer attacks have natural auto-aim, which means if a killer is smart enough, and they see you trying to 360, they'll just trail your ass and tap you out cold. 360s only work against newer killer players.
---
Today i gave the last survivor hatch and they DCed, just a sad story of the day
---
I actually cant identify some of these for some reason
---
THANK YOU. Someone see's my point.
---
Spewing casino coins, cashing into mini roulette tables where she gets her jackpots.
---
These are perfect, I love how Bubba is the Pretty Lady costume from the end of the og movie! Also, bottom text Clown
---
You ok buddy?
---
You can thank the dedicated servers
---
So i looked it up and the costume was made before the movie. I always thought it was created for the movie and then after they acted like it was a generic costume already being sold.

I remember my very first game where I got hooked, tried to escape (because of the prompt) and died since I wasn‚Äôt ready for the struggle phase. Whenever I‚Äôm in a lobby and everyone‚Äôs ranks are lower than 17, I bring a key with Left Behind to find the hatch since they usually all die pretty fast and accidentally kill themselves or disconnect as soon as they get hooked.
---
I love watching puppers, almost always has a great attitude and is the kindest person I've ever seen. He's a surv main
---
Boomer isn't just an age-range, Boomer is a state of mind.
---
I'll admit, I've got my own Boomer inside too. It's not about never being a Boomer, it's about correcting your Boomer moments.
---
Also - I remember the MW2 days (Command OP). While you're not wrong, we can all be better than the toxicity. Just cause we went through it doesn't mean others should have to.
---
&lt;3
---
What
---
I would love to see a modern outfit for The Plague. This is so cool.
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how many will just dunk on you in higher ranks and run you for 3 gens. 
---
*PTSD flashbacks*
---
I didn‚Äôt get the meme until read you comment! üòÅ
---
Anyway my point is its close enough to the movie compared to the base costume DbD. Idk if that is supposed to be the MTV show version or what. I did notice the flavor text describes someone other than the original killers.
---
Go back to the menu, come back in, should have them
---
If not, play one game
---
Hahahaha yeah that‚Äôs what I thought you were mentioning. Personally I‚Äôd love the red jacket he wore in the first ep of ash vs evil dead
---
wait i thought it was doctor
---
Some of these are really good and should be in the game cause they would sell like hot cakes. And the others all remind me of anime. None the less all great Designs
---
Hm, thank you.  
---
Didn't think about it this way. Didn't take too long to change my mind. :D
---
Look at this üòÇüéÆüôè https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RHsXEQjrtfw&amp;t=2s
---
Body blocking is a helpful tactic and benefits the team.
---
Camping benefits no one (That's not strictly true, if survivors know the killer is camping then they'll power through the gens).
---
I want underwear huntress
---
I played in alpha. Last I remember was the sniper load out for hunter, one shooting you even if it hit the foot.
---
Oh and also BHVR sucks and can't seem to work around 'let's just let the one side of players bleed out to death and crawl absolutely fucking slowly because gameplay'
---
By either it or haunted being broken
---
And runs away instead of picking her up or else he loses his power instantly.
---
Honestly?The chase mechanics are way,way better than dbd's chases,you feel like you're actually doing something to evade the hunter and the fast pace really helps that.Kinda sad it's going to go,I always played it time to time.
---
i think in the AMA they did a few days ago, there was mention of trying to balance the game around comms, in the sense that you would be able to convey the same amount of information without using comms. extensions of the point and beckon, i guess.
---
KILLERS RISE UP
---
There is an effect similar to what you see when doc zaps you
---
it's actually probably decent practice, just doodling your Killers/Survivors while waiting.
---
*yall he just came out n he already apparently gay*
---
wait no he's not even fuckin out yet lmao
---
If you have fun with a skillcap, buy clown. If you have fun without a skillcap, Myers. (Myers is more fun than ghostface imo)
---
You know what.
---
Me like
---
Lol!!!!!
---
Bought Myers, don‚Äôt play him.
---
Bought Ghost Face, I don‚Äôt use him properly. I barely stalk. 
---
Bought clown, one of my favorites. Can you not handle the thickness? People tremble when they see this luscious solid of a man.
---
I play on ps4, hitting share and save video clip will clip the last 30 minutes. Not sure how it works on Xbox and PC
---
Ghostface
---
Nice I'll check it out, thanks mate
---
Indoor maps are my favorite survivor maps
---
Coldwind is where I consider leaving as the killer. It‚Äôs usually 20 minutes of trying to find someone to chase through the corn with no gens being done like ever.
---
I feel this in my soul. Takes forever for survivor.
---
yeah and the survivor introduced in their chapter should have a gun too. also the map takes place in the middle east, and everyone only picks deagles and AWPs and holy shit dust 2 for the millionth time kill me now
---
That's not my point but go off. The game is tailed in favor to the killer. Killers have powers survivors have items. That's the point.
---
The Game and Lerys have to be played differently. They are both map-wide infinites when played correctly. You need Balanced Landing for The Game tho, so rip this map next patch
---
Yui*
---
Don‚Äôt worry , DC are gonna get punished now . Now the next thing you‚Äôll see will be survivors just killing themselves on first hook. Idk why people do such thing , try to play normally even though the game isn‚Äôt going for you.it can be the same for the killer but DC or killing in first hook isn‚Äôt the right thing.
---
Yeah you can all get sanctimonious and downvote me and pretend you are holier than though by talking about how great the map is but it's fing trash. Streamers dc on it all the time. It's a horrible map. If the killer finds you, you are as good as dead. There is no looping on it. Do you really need me to explain why I hate it? How about this, you explain to the community why you LIKE it???? If the map wasn't garbage, they wouldn't have surveyed players recently about how they feel about it.
---
wait he got banned
---
^no
---
New Freddy is great IMO; I'm just getting all nostalgiac because I really liked Old Freddy too.
---
He was just so different from every other Killer.
---
Same , what u usually is is play their game and slugg them for the majority of the game . They wanted me not to hook them fine I‚Äôll make your experience extra fun with extra slugging
---
I mean no but ok
---
dead hard finally working ?? pog
---
Punctuation, dude.
---
Is Mathew Cote holding you hostage?
---
Dude is flat out a manchild and his GF is literally only with him so long as that youtube channel keeps afloat. I'm amazed he asks "Why am I not a fog whisperer?" Yet he says the most childish shit in every video. I mean he even said in numberious videos Demo looks like a ball sack. I mean seriously have the "professionalism" to keep that shit to yourself if you're trying to be noticed by "professional" people. Also, Monto doesn't show the videos where he gets his shit punched in. 1 time he banned a dude on discord for 4 gen running him. He was the first Youtuber I watched for DBD and after awhile some of his videos look flat out staged. I mean come on, who puts down a trap wide open space and some random dude walks in it moments later right in front of you?
---
love love love!!!
---
Are you interested in making and selling them?
---
I miss Goth culture/fashion.
---
&gt;Reduced charges for increased speed can be overrun if the killer has a perk that reduces item efficiency. I rather have charges then speed.
---
Nobody uses Overwhelming Presence...
---
while we r nerfing everything on survivors how about removing bloodlust from killers now that most of the pallets are unsafe....ijs...im just saying
---
Pp
---
It's free on PC now until the servers are shut down.
---
ouu huntress and plague can step on me ,, both look very good 10/10 would take hatchet to head .
---
All of these are really good, but I'm not really sure about the bottom left, is that hillbilly?
---
FUCK THIS FUCKING DARK SENSES MISSION.
---
I HAVE DONE IT 4 (FOUR) TIMES AND IT WONT FUCKING CONPLETE I DONT FUCKING GET IT BHVR MAKES THE MISSIONS EASIER OR MAKE THEM FUCKING WORK YOU SHIT BRAIN FUCKING COMPANY.
---
IT SHOULDNT TAKE ME 5 GAMES TO GET ONE ELIGIBLE TO FINISH THE MISSION ONLY TO HAVE BULLSHIT HAG MAGIC SAY I DIDNT AVTUALLY FUCKING DO IT.
---
They likely just dumped it into Google translate like I did and this is what it spat out. Which is stupid because while when I reverse translate via Google it looks fine, but native speakers will probably be confused.
---
We had this discussion mamy times.
---
If you add something to everyone, you‚Äôd probably need to nerf survivors base kit.
---
Imagine having your main ace P3 with all the perks and cool cosmetics for him to get bonus luck when meg runs at 101% speed.
---
I saw only one decent suggestion where all survivors had a positive and a negative passive
---
Countless stories, I could tell you about the birds and the bees even! Or that one time at band camp!
---
Did you mean wendigo
---
b0p
---
It's also required for multiple achievements and I believe for the "Mettle of Man" perk. Survivors have very few defences, body blocking is a high risk delaying tactic at best, it won't even help unless there's multiple survivors helping.
---
You only need the equivalent of 3 gens worth. I only popped 2 but I bounced around on the other 3 and still got it.
---

Too many hits to be accurate

What‚Äôs the achievement ?

the most common is Pops and Sloppy because killers want the game to last 10thousand years and we commit suicide from boredom instead...

5 yr old kindergarten, slow down breathe and communicate what you trying to say. Why do I have to decipher your shitty comment. Also savage shit? I'm embarrassed for you, how are you not embarassed.
---
Soo why is it still a mechanic in the game? It doesn‚Äôt make much sense theme-wise. Being the obsession should have passive negatives associated with it. You shouldn‚Äôt WANT to be the obsession cuz it MAKES YOU SAFER.
---
Well considering this dude was a samurai in like the 1400s hes 99.9% straight
---
keep in mind, you‚Äôre playing on controller so It‚Äôs much harder
---
Yeah, I wonder why they didn't put the "equivalent of 3 gens" into the description. They use it in dailies, so you know that you don't have to repair 3 whole gens, but only the equivalent of them.

I don‚Äôt think the base is too low! I don‚Äôt have the steam statistics . But if a game has a Nsfw subreddit , I‚Äôd say it has a pretty decent player base.

Not sell, but I made a thingiverse page with a the models I've made so far

Problem is the game is not balanced at all. There‚Äôs no point in taking this game seriously. If the devs start taking balancing seriously (Removing moris, broken addons, toolboxes, balancing perks, etc...) then we can start taking the game seriously. You winning or losing does not indicate your skill level at all and my opinion is that the game will become so stale if they make it super serious.
---
&gt;God forbid a niche perk having a use

He is trying to say devs trading charges for speed was a bad thing because of Overwhelming Presence, a perk that you see once every 100 matches if that.

About a month or 2 it might take

not sure what you are talking about.
---
Ah, classic Dwights
---
Think its 7k shards to buy, last I saw. Obviously will depend on if they change the cost now. However only took me about 2 months with the change to get that much and that is with playing on and off, few hours a day if that.

That's the one downside to this game. The toxic sore winners. I've tried to get a couple of friends into the game on Xbox since it's on the Gamepass, and these kinds of people really pushed them away badly. I've been playing months and it still kinda gets to me. There's no need for people to be such a-holes, beyond they just need that satisfaction of that win because they clearly must not have anything else good in life. This game would be way more fun imo if people just stopped being so damn tryhard in every single match and just enjoyed the game for the fun of it.
---
I didn't know I needed that plague skin until now.
---
It‚Äôs not a season pass.
---
My life will never be complete without this Ghostface.
---
I didn‚Äôt know I found the trapper so attractive until now uh oh
---
I wish survivors had more dynamic facial expressions lol
---
Hide in a locker or run Distortion to make BBQ worthless. Do gens through Ruin. Lower your rank and you'll have more fun. Killers can win without those perks and increasingly other perks have better success. Thanatophia Dying Light Pop Goes the Weasel and Infectious Fright get a lot of use now and are for more worse than ruin and bbq
---
I love the facial animations from killer PoV when there's a locker grab, lol
---
Eh bbq is used more for BP then anything.
---
Damn that‚Äôs really good
---
Downing survivors or doing gens = incredibly toxic/s

They announced they are stopping development on the game due to the low population

---

Yeah, agree.  It's not so much BBQ and Chili, but hunting for TOTEMS every god damn match because nobody can do gens with HEX RUIN on is getting really old.

Never is a bold statement, especially when you can theoretically be held hostage in a corner indefinitely

That's sad. I thought that game would had took off
---
No wait 2 weeks and get Oni for really real
---
&gt;You just never see anyone talk about it because we kind of forget that she exists.
---
This is also a problem on:
---
Trapper if you catch too many survivors with your traps. 
---
Hillbilly if you use his chainsaw to end chases.
---
Leatherface if you use his chainsaw to end chases.
---
Myers if you use your EW3 to end chases.
---
Ghost Face if you expose a survivor to down him. 
---
And yes, people talk / talked about this but it is easier to just use your basic attack to get the achievement than expect the devs to fix something fast enough.

Clown since he gets bamboozle and pop while legion only has discordance
---
Honestly it isn't BBQ and CHili that bothers me, it's when killers are running HEX RUIN EVERY GAME.  Nobody knows how to gen when it is on.  A match of idiots running all over the map and saving each other int oblivion.  Three triples, one double, and four gens left. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
Yes, you can navigate between pages.
---
Using 100% of your brain right there.
---
I somehow think Oni could manage if he was Plague. Plague manages a lot of the time.
---
Plus, wouldn't hitting still charge his skill?
---
Plague as Jessica Bunny when BHVR?
---
Thx!
---
I don't know if you play a lot of killer, but if you don't then I seriously encourage you to experience playing it for awhile and getting to the higher ranks. I hear you that it can get a bit boring to deal with as a survivor, but without it at high ranks it can feel like the gens get done so early in the round that you didn't even have a chance to start applying pressure to the survivors.
---
As for BBQ, that has a ton of counters. If someone goes down then you can just get in a locker for a few seconds and they won't be able to see you. A lot of killers (myself included) more use it for the extra BP anyway and constantly forgot to even look for the auras of other survivors after hooking someone.
---
I'm not sure Jason could save it.
---
Playing a game worked! Thank you!!!!
---
 I almost never get +rep. Even when i play nice, like when i demolish the team, getting them all slugged. I can finish the game right then and there, but i decide to let them do gens and leave, spare them, so to speak. Or when i give the last person a hatch.
---
 The point is - these people never see fit to go to my profile and say a good thing in return. 
---
 But when they lose... Oh boy.. They're all chatterboxes - cursing me in the comments at steam. Leaving -reps etc. 
---
People demand a good behavior from killers, but never bother to be good in return.  Sure they might type GG in the post game chat, but leaving a positive comment in steam would be more welcoming.
---

---
*last gen pops* wait *adrenaline activates*
---
And THEN
---
‚ÄúgG Ez BAbY KIlleR‚Äù
---
Adrenaline is one of the most toxic perks change my mind
---
This. It's the most annoying thing to see 3 gens just boom out of nowhere within the first 2 mins of a match. At that point, as Killer, I'm pretty much done and know I've lost. I like a match that's an actual challenge to do, even if I lose it, not a rush-fest just to prove they can beat some world record for winning
---
I love playing as and against Mikey boi, simply because he has so much variety. You never know if you‚Äôll play against a perma Mikey, tombstone Mikey or maybe even scratched mirror Mikey. Though if the Mikey uses a map offering for Larry‚Äôs you already know what‚Äôs going to happen.
---
&gt;I got one just one question why does the legion get sweaters but the other killer don‚Äôt imagine Michael Stalking you in a Christmas sweater or ghostface wearing his over his cloak or even the huntress having a sweater
---
The answer is quite obvious, licensing. I imagine they have to go through the same process with every cosmetic they intend to release for a licensed character (unless they get permission to do whatever they want). 
---
Wouldn't know the answer for Huntress not having one tho.
---
Edgy...
---
Ok Boomer
---
I pre-ordered it because I believe in these devs and wanted to support them. Never actually got to play it very much as my computer wasn't strong enough. Computer's strong enough now but it's too late.
---
You kind of answered your own question. There's literally nothing stopping them from being awful, so awful people love the game for how easy it is to bully others.
---
All we can do is hope it's true that they're all absolutely miserible and will stay that way for the rest of their lives, localized to just ruining DbD.

Doctor: Unnerving Presence Overcharge distressing and Pop goes the weasel. You want to force the survivors to do all the gens except 3 really close gens the closest stack of gens so the last gen is nearly impossible for them to do and hopefully get some downs or a kill by then

Who the hell is mass downvoting comments on this post?

Oh ok

While I do think you're right, you gotta admit that the obsession mechanic, and the potential mechanics it can bring into the game, are pretty damn cool.
---
Hate to do this but older bro is with an extra i. As in "Onii" instead of "Oni" (demon).
---
I love 4King groups with ‚Äúunderpowered‚Äù killers just for the salt.
---
The stupid dark senses one took me 22 games in total. 7 games it should have worked. I felt like such an asshole for only doing Gens and avoiding the killer super hard but I finally did it.
---
He's actually Hillbilly but better with his steering and lack of collision stun.
---
But he's still Hillbilly.
---
Yes you can complete the level and then go back and finish the other challenges. That's what I am currently doing.
---
Ohhh yeah, I forgot he was getting one
---
Wow. There are some seriously sensitive people out there if they got offended by socks under a shirt. I fear for the future of this planet some days!
---
Thanks bro xD
---
There isnt always an obsession though so that doesn't work. If nobody brings Decisive Strike OoO or MoM then there wont be an obsession generally if the killer doesnt use obsession perks either. It happens
---
Hide or Die is just a battle royale though. You'd be better off looking at Project Resistance, Identity V, or even hoping Last Year launches on Steam.
---
I fully support the legion the hunters and especially the trapper ideas.

For killer I find ruin, spirit fury, enduring and pop goes the weasel is a solid go to build. Sloppy, whispers, bbq are common and good picks too. Save the best for last, infectious fright and corrupt intervention are pretty popular too these days, depending on the killer.
---
For survivor I have builds with Decisive, borrowed time, dead hard and iron will or adrenaline but also builds with inner strength, quick and quiet, head on etc.
---
That‚Äôs a rich and respected pizza sandwich though.

The stagger reduction isn't 100%, means part of the speed boost is eaten up by the fall required to activate it. Makes it bad compared to the other two flat out if you want that distance. Besides that, it was, and still is, a nearly dead perk on some maps whereas Lithe and Sprint Burst are always available. Yes, it caused some new infinites to be available on some maps, but infinites already exist on certain maps so, since maps like that need a redesign anyway, why not just work on maps that BL opens infinites on instead of making the perk the objectively worst exhaustion perk in the game. Or, heck, add a timer to the passive that helps ruin the created infinites but still allows the perk to be useful. This change just kills the perk outright rather than fixing any of its problems. Anyway, have a good day, sorry so many people downvoted you.
---
Can you give us more Content ?
---
This games rank doesnt depend on how your allies play until high ranks. If you unhook heal and do at least 1.5 Generators you will always pip up until like rank 13.
---
Mmm, no. Bloodlust activating and lagging the game is client side. Disliking dedicated servers is reasonable but don't blame everything on them.
---
When you give someone $5.99 a month you can say whateverthefuck you want to them! /s
---
Thank you for the criticism!
---
I would consider either Sarah Conner or Kyle Reese as survivors - im not certain what perks they would have but maybe something related to being hard to find? To mirror the terminator‚Äôs purpose.
---
Don't forget you can get a survivor adept by literally urban evading around the map/hiding in a locker jacking off waiting for your friends to all die, yeet into the hatch "GGEZ BABY KILLER" and get the adept. 
---
Killers however can get a perfect 32k and still not get the adept.
---
When shit like that happens to me while I am killer I will walk them to the gate and let them go.
---
They probably shit themselves,  got super unlucky, and now I feel bad.
---
Thread seems to be very killer dominated haha.
---
High level play aka Basically level 8 upwards is just killers running Ruin, Bbq+C, NOED and either Nurse's calling or Endurance most often on a Mr Myers. Nothing wrong with the build inherently, its just that its every game. Kind of hoping that Oni brings something spicy but not stupid.
---
Yeah. It's really dumb. The achievement should pop if you get the 4k, regardless. It's a really inconsistent system of evaluation.
---
Meyers has cool shirt lol
---
Used more for* key words I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs completely useless it just has many counters to it that makes it a useless perk quite a bit. 
---
Bbq is above the curve rank 20-10 other then that most survivors know how to play around it from rank 1-9. 
---
It also gives more bps then any of the perks you‚Äôve mentioned mate. Also it has a good enough effect that could help you more then the other perks.
---
&gt; Also if players used it "just for bloodpoints", then we'd see Distressing, Thrill of Hunt and Bloodhound as common choices but they are easily low tier perks.
---
This doesn't make any sense since unlike BBQ, these perks only make it so you reach the cap quicker, it doesn't double your BP in that category at the end of the match. Playing killer without these perks you already walk out at 6k ~ 8k in every category, why would you ever run these perks only to see yourself playing most of the match without gaining any BP at the expense of perk slots. 
---
&gt;There is no way BBQ is for survivors, it's an above the curve killer perk for the pure benefit of the killer, that's why every killer uses it.
---
Yes, BBQ is a killer perk that was basically made for survivors as an healthy attempt to reduce camping. Just like Devour Hope, Make Your Choice among other perks.
---
Groovy
---
No, nobody has tested it and you are the first person to think about it.
---
Even though I‚Äôm kinda biased as they‚Äôre my mains, I love what you did with Myers, Ghostface and Freddy. Ghostface genuinely looks pretty badass, Freddy looks dapper as hell, and Myers is too funny not to love. I‚Äôd instabuy all of those if they were actual outfits.
---
Entered his stream after I saw this clips, he was still ranting about this ‚Äú1 year sub‚Äù-guy. Wtf did this person do/say to enrage him? Like how ‚Äúannoying‚Äù must the question be until I get banned for example
---
another generic answer. 
---
You should understand that the game generously rewards killers regarding BP. Survivors need to work really hard getting those BP and by hard i dont mean, NOT ONLY  DO GENS AND ESCAPE!
---
don't underestimate the spazness of our species
---
It's almost as if losing isn't fun....
---
Literally banned the guy for asking what‚Äôs wrong with having ttv in your name on dbd while pug was complaining because he just got rekt.  Same self entitled pug from years ago.
---
Totally looking forward to this lol, these renders are top tier
---
Von = how im guessing
---
See there we go that‚Äôs information other then that all I had to go off of was this streamer talking about his perspective!
---
Hes on the stout, legend
---
I think Michael anddemogorgen are a bit to much!
---
But I think it‚Äôs great work!
---
&gt; Get better at the game. 
---
Yep its totally about getting better when a teammate sandbagges you, nice logic.
---
Who stole his twinkie?
---
Nothing worse than overestimating your opponent lol. Expect decent mind game, get someone who runs in a straight line.
---
More like emo/BDSM.
---
So you've basically confirmed it's better than the rest of the options out there... if it was a bad perk, people wouldn't use it, it's obviously better than the other perks with numerous advantages.
---
Like many people, I'm one of those disatisfied by the many cookie cutter meta perks. The amount of survivors who run Adrenline, Dead Hard, Decisive and the rest are god damn boring as well.
---
I remember practically shitting myself during the Demogorgon‚Äôs PTB the first few times it tried the Shred Attack on me.
---
Now it‚Äôs just really cute and I want to pet it.
---
Rank 16 is still noob level dude. That‚Äôs like 8 games, since you can‚Äôt depip. And it‚Äôs not genrush, what else are they supposed to do, twiddle their thumbs? Generator times need looked at I know, I‚Äôm a killer main, but don‚Äôt blame the survivors for it.
---
My opinion good because I use meme to present it
---
Clicking his flashlight is now "irrefutable proof" of a persons intent?
---
It‚Äôs pug, that‚Äôs his only build
---
I get killer games instantly and survivor takes 5 minutes
---
I want the pretty lady leatherface
---
This, funeral Ash and asylum Ash would be instabuys for me. I know there‚Äôs the question of ‚Äúwhat would they do with the hand?‚Äù, but if Myers has shown us anything, it‚Äôs that you can have a full outfit with one slot missing.
---
No no no no better then the perks you said for bp gain don‚Äôt get that confused. 
---
I mean every game has a meta. I just wish they would buff or rework weak or unused perks and killers. I think that would bring more life to the game and have diversity. Be interesting for others and the change of strategies. 
---
Like let‚Äôs say the killer pool for good killers at rank 1 is 7 that would be awesome.
---
Consoles don't have servers yet.
---
I've had this same issue lately. I'll start mashing A and boom, suddenly the game fails to register the button. My friend had it happen to him as well, where it just outright killed him and didn't register. And I could hear him through my headset practically smashing that A button to make it work. So, it's not out controllers, seems the game is a little bugged on the mashing side.
---
I know, which is why they need them badly.
---
"The killer should be able to mori the obsession"
---
"BUT WHAT IF THERES NO IBSESSION, THIS DOESNT WORK"
---
.....
---
With pug it kinda depends on his mood. He‚Äôs a loud and quick tempered guy so people do piss him off pretty easily. If he‚Äôs having an off day it only takes one misconstrued comment to get banned and chewed out for an hour. On other days I‚Äôve seen him put up with one guy (net even a follower) repeatedly insult him for running basement bubba and he just ignored it for a bit, then told the guy to stop, then asked again, then said he‚Äôll run what he wants, and then just put chat in follower only mode for an hour.
---
when it happened to me i was against a billy. thankfully he didn‚Äôt get mad after and even let me go.
---
Seems a little unfair that survivors who are the final one just have to lie down and take it. I don't agree with that at all. You might as well just tell them to DC because it's the same thing. You wanna mori the final one, bring the mori.
---
this is such a cool idea!
---
Yeah, sounds like pug. Entertaining guy a lot of the time, but I can‚Äôt handle him in large doses. He‚Äôs the kind of guy that‚Äôs good to watch for five minutes at a time
---
can‚Äôt hook me build
---
The huntress looks like a bunny h- interesting person
---
&gt;I know, which is why they need them badly.
---
Well, on PC they certainly were a step backwards for survivors and as expected, made the killer experience annoying.
---
I was going to say the addition of servers completely got rid of lag switching (which it did) but it introduced desync where your character continues running in a straight line or you see the killer running in a straight line and then suddenly you get hit. 
---
Windows vaults and Dead Hard rarely seem to work even at 30ms ~ 70ms. 
---
This has been a brief summary of the experience on servers. Mine and from a lot of people.
---
if you r an 1 year sub to Pug u should already know exactly how he plays and what exactly is pissing him off....thank you for enjoying the emotes for a year, next!
---
I always encourage people to play both sides. Gens can go super fast making killer super stressful and unfun so I always hate when survivors complain about ruin, especially when quite often it's the same survivor with a toolbox. But at the same time having idiot teammates and servers/hitboxes can make survivor really frustrating. There's shit on both sides and more people need to understand that.
---
Wait this all sounds just stupid considering the fact you can ban someone from chat or suspend someone from chatting for a certain amount of time. 
---
I don‚Äôt agree with this.
---
My favourites would have to be Spirit, Hag and Joey here.
---
Thankfully... Black metal Billy is not real, he can't hurt you!
---
If ‚Äúhigh rank play‚Äù in your region involves NOED frequently then you live in a weird place my friend. I haven‚Äôt seen NOED since rank 12 because people run perks to help throughout the match.
---
As a clown main, I respect the joker cosmetic
---
I would unironically wear most of these.
---
Entitled Selfosh pos. 
---
That‚Äôs it.
---
I don‚Äôt think either of those things have a correlation with one another.
---
It depends, what killer are you playing?
---
Yeah, those perks need to be reworded. Way too many people think that it‚Äôs bonus bp above the cap rather than just bonus TOWARDS the cap.
---
These cosmetics are as beautiful as Bunny Feng.
---
In other words they're never coming.
---
Murray, Can you introduce me as Finger Likkin good
---
DBD is simply a rage inducing game. There's no big punishments yet for leaving said game so people leave when they feel they don't stand a chance, get upset, etc. I understand how you feel with people who dc. Take a break if and when you need to, and hop back on when you feel better. We just gotta let the developers do their thing in the meantime.
---
It's sort of both, isn't it?
---
This guy is a complete asshole.
---
What are you even talking about? I'm talking about yellow mori being in the base kit, cuz you know
---
You will get hooked anyway. There's next to no chance in the world you'll wiggle off and when the killer sees there are no hooks nearby, they'll just slug you until you crawl closer to them. Why don't just give the killer an option to mori you instead cutting most of the time and making mori animations a part of the game instead of being an offering/perk exclusive thing
---
It‚Äôs about 50 hours. It takes roughly 110 hours to get devotion 1, by which point you‚Äôve earned enough shards for 2.7 characters. So it‚Äôs about 50 hours per character of time ingame. That‚Äôs not counting time in bloodweb or lobby/queue.
---
Then they could fix it to let read the signals and test and let the best connection host. So that it‚Äôs at least semi fair. It‚Äôs just frustrating. Last match that made me post this, I tried to unhook my friend, froze mid animation, then she started struggling. Go to unhook her again, freeze mid animation, and then the wraith comes through a wall and hits me. Go to run away, freeze, come to against a tree with the wraith hitting me from behind again. Honestly it‚Äôs almost unplayable as a survivor. 5 matches, only one with a semi decent connection, and I got lucky that we both lagged and I escaped.
---
Thanks for calling ne a noob then man :|
---
Relax
---
Ace is known for his finger guns so I wish we had those, but other than that, DBD is meant to be a horror game and while we're quite far from it now, seeing survivors taunting eachother or dancing would only make me quit the game
---
I found myself in the same predicament, and as of almost 12 hours after receiving that e-mail, I still haven't received anything. Let's hope it's there within 24 hours, heaven forbid something might've happened, causing them to postpone it further.
---
9k shards. Roughly 50 hours of game time. Had a debate yesterday on another thread where I had to do the match a few times
---
First is subjective and depends if you slug or hook him immediately, since I believe in fair chances for the downed guy (not his fault), but the second one is definitely true
---
You make the assumption EVERY survivor who's final will die. Not the case. I've won a fair few matches simply sneaking to an exit and making progress on the exit. I've even had survivors who've done it to me when I play killer. So no, not every single final survivor will die, because they can, if skilled, outplay you easily
---
I need the susie one, i love it
---
GOD i need this in my life
---
:O
---
Hey, shut up.
---
Ehhhh, rule 34 doesn‚Äôt have a minimum population count to take effect. Either way, the population region to region isn‚Äôt large enough to do this. Super cool concept that might have potential further down the line, but not really feasible right now.
---
Wasn't it somehow like that before the sprint got added, and nobody used it? Then again, the percentage of maps it was useless on / too situational was a lot higher...
---
OK Bommer
---
The playerbase as of 30 minutes ago was over 20,000.
---
Take this information however you will.
---
Who‚Äôs the one with the goat skull on their face?!
---
You are using periods instead of commas, why?
---
Big tiddy goth gf Adiris and cute nurse asap.
---
Who's the guy on bottom left
---
When you have horror games like Resident Evil, Evil Within, Alan Wake, etc. People kind of expect to be able to escape the challenging situation.
---
I also kind of blame this mindset on the videos of people like noob3(no offense to him) that show "oh look how easy it is to juke a killer and win the game!"
---
And then when you play the game yourself as a Baby survivor you see that you don't have any perks or consumables. You have nothing.
---
Susies and juiles looks very nice.
---
And that's a fact
---
Hey, I don‚Äôt mean it as an insult. We all started right where you are, but rank 16 is still noob ranks. The more you play (especially if it‚Äôs both sides) the more you‚Äôll understand different parts of this game and how they mesh. Generators need some tweaks for sure but it‚Äôs not survivors being toxic.
---
why can't we get that prestiege version? it covers everything.
---
So, the rankdoesntmatter 19 had We'll Make It active before getting hooked, still had like 10 seconds left on it, knows someone is getting chased at the other end of the map, you were injured when unhooking him, he is *desperately* trying to communicate that he has We'll Make It, you continue running away...
---
I'll leave games for a few reasons. 
---
1.) If some asshole unhooks me while being chased and they aren't running borrowed time so I instantly get downed and placed on a hook. 
---
2.) If it's obvious that the killer is modding by knowing exactly where people are. I.E. turning a corner already swinging their weapon at me despite never having seen me, or placed a person on hook for BBQ and chili. 
---
3.) The game is severely lagging. 
---
That's it.
---
HiT BoXeS ArE FiNE
---
1. Yes I have and it didn't make the game any more fun or change anything. Rewards for it are crappy as well.
---
2. Yup it is dead for now but they are going to overhaul the game and improve it after feedback so we will see if it gets better.
---
The joker or Ronald McDonald 50/50
---
I once got a comment saying some dumb shit like "-rep tunneler"
---
Im like a rank 17 killer.
---
They were a rank 8 survivor.
---
do you hear the DC sound when it happens? sometimes survivors leave out of nowhere and if there's no sound then that means that dedicated servers decided to poop out and just disconnect that particular player for no reason
---
At number 2, if your injured they‚Äôll know where you are by sound not sight.
---
It would be a neat switch up, I agree. Maybe a cop or someone else inherently evil
---
No mither + Iron Will + Resilience + This Is not Happening(?)or Dead hard
---
Hillbilly has more map pressure and has access to his ability all the time, he doesn't have to collect blood. It is also easier to steer with him during dash and add ons to help steer become even better.
---
Onis power is also removed after picking up a survivor, meaning you have to choose to hook or leave survivor and go for someone else. Meaning someone will heal the other survivor.
---
You are objectly wrong and should be ashamed.
---
Not if Hillbilly has add ons to help that. A decent hillbilly rarely gets stunned.
---
I was talking about an option to mori them once you down them.
---
83% upvoted, this has trigger some.
---
MANIAC COP!!!
---
the statement is clear but the point is lost.
---
&gt; 2.) If it's obvious that the killer is modding by knowing exactly where people are. I.E. turning a corner already swinging their weapon at me despite never having seen me, or placed a person on hook for BBQ and chili.
---
&gt; 
---
You know killers can hear breathing, grass moving, foot steps or maybe he saw you from the distance while approaching your location?
---
I've been playing DBD for over 2 years and never encountered a cheater. Well, at least blatant one. Many killers could've been cheating but if they were, they were terrible at it.
---
first: leaving one person on the ground is not slugging.
---
I do understand how a good part of this game works and interacts. I'm rank 16 but I have had the game for a good while, but yeah, rank 16 is just a good achievement for me since in the past year and a half, the highest rank I've gotten was 17 since I didn't play it that often
---
S H U T
---
for the second one, i could see it being balanced if he couldnt move while spraying.  Just have him stand still and shoot ~10 times, and then reload as a stun animation.  
---
  
---
As long as its balanced Im game for just about anything tbh.
---
You make good points and especially in higher ranks it's very true. The only thing for me personally (why I feel its subjective and said for you personally as well, again, subjective) is the fair aspect. It's just not fun for the downed guy to get fucked over. Then again I fully see where you are coming for pressure-wise. Would you do the same in lower ranks? I'm mostly referring to a fun experience, in terms of strategy I fully agree with you.
---
He is my favorite killer, i play both sides
---
Yeah but we‚Äôre talking about base kits here, and the fact remains that Oni has tracking in his base kit, and Billy does not
---
Clowns is best
---
I want the death garden skins on Xbox I would pay 20 dollars for it
---
I‚Äôm not sure why people are confused. This is all stuff that should have been expected right off the bat, it‚Äôs all logical. Without servers there was a single connection to worry about, that of the survivor to the killer. In the new system you need to worry about the killers connection to the server and the survivors connection to the server. This means that there are double the possibilities of something going wrong. For example, window hits are an obvious one. The reason they‚Äôre so weird now is that if a killer is lagging then on their end it looks fine, and it‚Äôs probably set up to give killer the final say. Killer was the host previously so code was laid that gave killer the final verdict in what happened. I doubt that that code is gone
---
ok kiddo
---
Sad. When we all really wanna play different survivors but we've been hardcore playing that one survivor this entire time.. and now it's just like, I don't want to leave my collection of items on that one person just to go and play Nancy who has literally nothing. It doesn't matter that I P-3'd here, she has nothing for items compared to my original survivor choice. This also makes me not want to purpose other articles of clothing for other survivors. I find my favorite based on personal likes and preferences, and so I only buy for that character. I would most likely buy for a lot more, if I could share my inventory with my other P-3 survivors.
---
So less periods and not commas ok thanks for the helpful advice
---
He does but its not necessary if you played game for a while.
---
How about another joke, Surrrrrrvivor
---
Playing both sides really helps you become a better player as well. I started playing this game when it was crazy broken for survivor (infinites, no hook respawns, issues with healing perks stacking, etc.) so for the longest time I only played survivor. Not because I abused these mechanics for easy wins, but because I had zero interest in dealing with that BS as a killer.
---
Once they fixed a lot of the straight up broken stuff and I started playing killer, I already knew a lot of what I should be doing just from understanding the survivor POV so well. Once I started playing a lot of killer I feel like it helped me become an even better survivor.
---
There is the exact same option in the privacy settings on Xbox
---
Its a videogame series, pretty good one , i recommend you play 5 first

Whats wrong with having ttv in your name?

Disgusting human being that deserved permaban.

Clearly we need a killer with a mortar that has a cartoon shadow where it‚Äôs gonna land.

Imagine being this snotty while gatekeeping the game and telling others how to play a game they bought with their own money.
---
Got em

Holy shit this is actually go**HOLY FUCKING SHIT TUXEDO DOCTOR!**
---
Yuin trouble
---
Trapper looks like the tough bad guy who will take off his shirt and the hero has to fist fight in old 80-90s movies. I like it.
---
It depends on the early game for me. If a person DCs or kills themselves early because I found them quickly and downed, I'll give whoever is the last person alive. If they wiggle then I just chase them, acting like a total dipshit until they find it. If I find it first/know where it is already, I'll actually down them and carry them over.
---
If a person happens to just be doing super poorly, as in literally always being in the wrong place at the wrong time, I'll give them hatch too. 
---
Once, I was walking by a gen and this dude threw a pallet down right behind me. I didn't even know he was there until he did that. I kind of just stared at him and went on my way to the actual person I saw, a Blendette hiding behind a hill. (Killed them dead. Hatched the goofball by the pallet.)
---
offerings
---
I love being called a "trash camper" when I can literally see scratch marks around the hook right after hooking and I find a Claudette crouching behind something, or when I just downright see people running to the hook, no shame, expecting me to just ignore them and let them unhook while I am there.

These are offerings. You unlock them in your character blood webs and they modify the game, by either tremendously increasing the choice of map (the key) or more blood points or creating more mist on the map

Hooking them slows the game down a lot

Holy shit Billy

Not looking for any advantage. I‚Äôve won just as many as I‚Äôve lost. Just the last week, it‚Äôs been borderline unplayable due to killers with bad connections. I‚Äôve played online multiplayer games with dedicated servers for years. They have them for pc. Just switch it. I love this game. I have fun playing with friends. That‚Äôs why I have it. It‚Äôs just frustrating when we can‚Äôt do anything but lag and die.
---
at least he didnt level vit
---
Just to make sure, I'll not only call him, but also the Nurse.
---
I did. A lot.
---
I don‚Äôt know if this is a coincidence or not, but both these names come from the game Town of Salem. You‚Äôve got a great idea with the characters, the melee weapons work but the ranged weapons would need some work. 
---
For the pirate, he could instead have a cannon and he has to load in a cannonball before firing. He is stuck in the spot while placing it down and loading it and maybe even while shooting it. Or maybe he can move the cannon a bit before shooting. His aim horizontally could be either 360 degrees or 180 (more preferred) and the cannon ball could have a similar trajectory to the huntress‚Äô hatchets. So it would be large but slow enough and curves so that survivors can dodge and the pirate has to actually aim to hit their target. Obviously the planting and loading gives survivors the time to find obstacles or escape. 
---
The veteran could have a limited capacity in his ak (I‚Äôm not a weapons expert so idk how much there should be). To balance it out, he could be immobilised while firing and either deal in bursts or shoot the whole thing in one long animation. Recoil would have to be intense (so fighting on the vertical, maybe some horizontal). Killers could eventually adjust to the recoil so maybe double AKs or a single AK in hip fire with terrible accuracy. More likely to work in close range but would probably take some charge up (or initial reload).
---
Yess we're finally gonna see some gender equality when it comes to shirtless cosmetics.

I dont even want to joke about it anymore.. When I go down its like 50/50 that dedicated servers will play its part.. And dont let me start about Dead Hard..

Makes me laugh, if this person were to write this out in text you wouldn't give two shits
---
I completely agree. There are always multiple factors in play. Good points all around.
---
agreed
---
I didn't mean slug in a bad way. I understand the phrasing is subjective, but I actually just meant letting him lie on the ground instead of picking him up.
---
Thanks for the discussion mate. It was good and I enjoyed it. I originally labeled this post as a discussion, but the mods changed it to shitpost/meme. I used the meme to stimulate debates and or chats. ü§ôüèº

On Xbox you have the option of saving from preset timings: previous 30s, 1m, 2m, 5m.

Or record the next 10m of gameplay.

Most people don't write reviews on products, it's usually people who have had a horrible time with and and people who had an amazing experience. even if your nice most people won't leave you a positive rep unless you standout. To be fair I only have 3-4 positive reps to my 5-6 negative reps but in my opinion I see it as equal as more people will leave a bad review over a good one.
---
I want that joker skin NOW üòÇ
---
I know, except the game I played last night nobody had been injured in yet. Perhaps it was sheer dumb luck, but I was behind the killer shack and was watching around the corner the killer coming towards me. Before he even rounded the corner, he was already lunging at me, despite me not running to leave marks or being injured to cry in pain.

And if they're any good, lose the game. Lol.
---
Probably re-used the sound file for some reason
---
You can win without perks, its just a LOT harder at red ranks since as killer you have to do everything yourself while as survivor you can rely on your teammates more
---
We full rust now bois.

Ah ok thx

The S doesn‚Äôt play games in 4K it‚Äôs just 4K video streaming and 4K movies, also dbd doesn‚Äôt play in 4K even on the Xbox one x it‚Äôs just not supported

Evolve all over again.

I am absolutely down for more formal clothing for Doctor.

I mean, the *Urban Evasion* part can only be done with one of them, but I agree.

The match was a while ago though but there is a funny clip from it: [https://www.twitch.tv/otzdarva/clip/YawningSmoggyHedgehogOhMyDog](https://www.twitch.tv/otzdarva/clip/YawningSmoggyHedgehogOhMyDog)

I think ‚Äúvery hard‚Äù difficulty for a challenge is totally fine for an achievement you can get at any time. I think for time-sensitive challenges (especially those meant to incentivize people to spend on microtransactions) ought to be easier, *especially* with BHVR‚Äôs ‚Äúone challenge at a time‚Äù model (as opposed to allowing you to get credit for any challenge at any point like most other games that use a similar model). 
---
However, I‚Äôm starting to think there might be some market research floating around the industry to suggest a really difficult first battlepass might actually help sales for later battlepasses, based on how many games seem to be doing this sort of thing. 
---
Basically I think the top tier rewards of the first ‚Äúbattlepass‚Äù in a game being super difficult/grindy to get means that few people will get them, which makes them more exclusive, which incentivized people to buy the next one bc scarcity/exclusivity. That‚Äôs pure theorizing tho
---
From what I found there‚Äôs very minimal difference between the original and the S, They both have the exact same CPU and the gpu in the S is clocked at 914 MHz while the original in 853 MHz. From what I can tell I‚Äôd say if you already have a Xbox it‚Äôs not worth it unless you have some need for a second Xbox because performance would be minimal if at all.

Poor Nea is just in the back having to stick with Parkour despite being the original street girl.

Lol I got a 360 and just discovered Dbd but I want high fps and I'm hoping the S has that and just overall better performance than the 360 and so it looks good on my tv lol

wow when they said that they were going to start making the characters "naked" so creating cosmetics could be easier, I thought something like everyone being like the spirit, but not this...

You would have three by default, and you could get a maximum of seven with add-ons.

Now I believe it's two by default and a maximum of five.

This post is seriously such a mood

Ah ok, just work on sentence structure and punctuation i guess :)

Or, Y'know, we could not get upset because it's irrelevant to the post
---
Xbox one S is fine to play Dbd yes. Probably is the best choice because of price. But no it won't be better than regular xbo or Ps4 in this game regarding graphics. 
---
In this game there's no console optimization. One S = regular xbo = One X = regular Ps4 = Ps4 pro.
---
If it interests you for other games, from a technical point of view, the consoles rank this way: One X &gt; PS4 Pro &gt; regular Ps4 &gt; One S &gt; regular Xbox one.
---
Fantastic
---
Wraith needs to calm the fuck down.
---
Well in those situations the add-on would work
---
I‚Äôm just saying that they could flashlight you from range so coming closer would be less effective then a flashlight.
---
Just gonna point out that if you don't have enough encouragement to ignore your obsession with the current obsession perks, the added mori probably won't make you want to either
---
W a h
---
I play as both. I hate it when I get unhooked in front of the killer, immediately get downed, and get put back on the same hook. As a killer if I see someone trying to unhook in front of me, I try to punish the "savior." If I'm on them far enough out, I'll hit them once, let them finish the unhook, and then hit them again as soon as the animation finishes. If I'm really close, I go for the grab
---
The last one should be you with distortion ignoring the aura reading of nemesis and using dance with me to disappear
---
I dont know about you but im rank 11 and im too slow to use 60k bloodpoints (estimated value from last game) to level up during
---
You can also look straight up as a killer to avoid being flashlight blinded, but it only works on tall killers as far as I know, I don't play the average height ones too much
---
New mori leaked

Lowkey, that was dope

Tell me then when was last hag you saw. at the moment i daily play 5 hpurs at least dbd and last hag was in monday so its week  now and you know what she didnt killed any even tho i suck as surv so they can perform well but at the same time there are people giving a fck about that
---
His hat's lookin like a spread butt cheek
---
Well, I don't find killer really attractive..
---
I just played once the huntress cause of the lullaby, else I'm a survivor main (and even playing survivors, I don't have a main)

Happy cake day :)

It totally would and I totally forgot to mention this.

Yes.

Offerings \^\^ If you hover your cursor over them it will reveal what effect they will have on the specific survivor/killer or the match as a whole. The final offering burnt will almost always be the killers unless they never burn one. You unlock them in the bloodweb and equip them in the top right of the loadout menu. Check the wikipedia for all offerings and their effects! :D

Thanks so much :3

Damn, the attention to detail is amazing. Great art piece.

There‚Äôs a certain range where the killer can m1 around the generator and get a teleport yank. It‚Äôs pretty dumb and I‚Äôm surprised more haven‚Äôt said anything.
---
I remember first starting the game, not realizing the blinks needed to be charged. I figured nurse was just absolute ass
---
Noed+old remember me+blood warden+class photo+pill bottle was nasty

Lets be real... Deathgarden was never a good game.

If they ever made that skin and I had to debate buying it, I think I'd uh, Give In To Temptation.

I'll never forget you, my baby. We had some good times on Haddonshit

I always swing at the unhooked person first if I can't down or grab the unhooker instead. Either the unhooked person gets downed, or they have to go mend away their BT. Both scenarios buy you time and I am definitely going to take advantage of a bad teammate's error.
---
Is that Sharp Hand Joe?

Whats so hard about it? Just point it in the killer's face
---
Ok.

nice

That little emo hag is so cute!!

Had someone complain on my profile for ‚Äúcamping gens‚Äù when there was one gen left. Like srs? Y‚Äôall 3 gen ur selves and then complain when I start patrolling it?

Sometimes the entitlement survivor mains have is insane.

Huntress being a rabbit themed mafiya boss is a cool aesthetic

Flashlight saves at pallets?

I think that's Nurse.

Ok but who is the deer skeleton

Your art style is so amazing! If any of these cosmetics were added, I‚Äôd buy them in a heartbeat.

Not really, as the slug one cannot do anything till picked up, while two injured can heal each other and still do genis

Evolve was way worse bro, all the micro transactions were insane. Deathgarden wasn‚Äôt like that.

I'd throw down for this whole set.

People are having all sorts of glitches after they revert to base DBD. One friend got both the killer and the survivor, they could not find a game at all though as they would get errors when they tried to play.

Tunneling is a tactic, which is considered to be strong by some people(like the spirit, you were playing against), and it is very easy to counter with perks. Maybe it is unfun for you, to be tunnelled, but it is not killers job to entertain, his job is to kill, by any means, even with tunnelling and camping.
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Only 4/5 games are like this so it isnt *so* bad...
---
And 90% of your lobbies are SWF xD
---
Thanks Jeff
---
Tunneling isn't reportable because it is not against the rules, rhe higher you get the less you will see hard camping and tunneling because most survivors have learned to do gens somewhere in high purple. And if killers keep those practices they'll not rank up any further.
---
The killer did nothing wrong. The survivor was being an idiot by hanging around the hook when the killer knew he was there. I would rather say "learn what camping is". Hardly about getting better and more "become less entitled".
---
That's why I said what I said.
---
Freddy lookin' stylish
---
Leatherface looks fresh out of a jojo meme
---
Noob3 is Greame, I know that much.
---
Are you sure about that? I am rank 5 and killer was rank 8.
---
Cause I did not play in swf and was not toxic?
---
 every killer is like this...
---
 Welcome, small intruder. I've been sound asleep in here for some time...Some, time? Ah. Yes. Yes. Well now you've gone and woken me up. It's no matter, I suppose. I might even be able to help you. .
---
But he also tends to ignore the ones that could hurt him politically. If the fake news media were so fake... he'd be quids in when it comes to law suits.
---
Are you the guy de-pipping as wraith?
---
The worst thing in this game besides camping/ tunneling killers are teammates who unhook you without borrowed time while the killer is still there.
---
I once got called a monkey n***a for winning. Good times :)
---
*Surely* the optimization patch is on its way!
---
I just want to use Hallowed Blight cosmetics without the game turning in to a picture show
---
BHVR flips shit and runs away if they hear the words "rank" and "fix" in the same sentence.
---
Completly agree, until about rank 5 I just tunnel the shit out of the unhooker until hes hooked, just because I know I can afford that in high ranks, if you are still doing that shit in red and purple ranks tho though shit, none of us are in our first game and you just killed your mate.
---
Ay I might be wrong and being an idiot. But since when couldn‚Äôt you grab heathy survivors from windows? I may have missed something there
---
I truly admire survivors who can pull off flashlight when the perfect situation presents itself like in this video. I see so many survivors, primarily as killer, who will follow the chase around as a spectator, just waiting for the survivor to go down so they rush in and fail a flashlight save. When they really should spend every second of that chase working on a gen. I mean kudos if they pull off the flashlight save, and one might say "you miss every shot you don't take", but knowing when to go for that shot and when not to is truly an incredible skill.

Oh we can only hope. I thought I was seeing some kind of magic trick
---
That trapper tho! I would love to see those cosmetics for him &lt;3
---
I always slug or activate bt on the unhooked player. Punishes bad survivors by losing them benevolence points
---
I check in ps4... Nothing :(
---
Well it is a lack of skill. If a survivor is making plays like that, expecting the killer to follow their bullshit logic, then they in for a sad surprise. If they had skill, they'd make proper moves like playing the game intelligently.
---
No worries hun, I assumed you weren't going for a judgy tone. Internet conversations are hard lacking voice tone lol.
---
Sucks but that's ok , thanks for checking though
---
The TTV brightly colored nea with a flashlight tends to be pretty easy to kill, I‚Äôm infinitely more afraid of the P3 Steve, Jeff, or Quentin with an all lowercase Latin name
---
But why? I get it the guy unhooking on front of the killer is an asshole, but it killer's job is well, to kill all survivors. And survivors have to work together to escape. Yeah it, sucks for the unhooked survivor trust me I've played plenty of survivor games too where this happened, but you can get shitty teammates in the almost every online game. It's not the killer's fault your teammates suck and it's not written anywhere you have to go for the other guy.
---
Only 2 angry comments? That's cute.

Here's my steam profile containing over 5 pages of angry survivor comments https://steamcommunity.com/id/Defenestration6145/

Looking at Pyramid head freaks me out with his weird,sharp angles and overly large head *Shudders*.

These are pretty amazing, I'd have to say Wraith is my favorite on these

Amazing af

Tell me about it....

Cant see the clip lol

We, the PS4 players, never get stuffs :/
---
Seems like it
---
You know what, Quentin mains are cute in their own way.
---
I agree with that at least, but I doubt that they would completely take it away since it has been so heavily used and helpful, if anything they would keep I but drastically decrease the numbers so the speed boost is not really significant

Did they have NOED?

Go away
---
And they're all here for the MCR reunion tour.
---
exavtly, whats so hard at flashing the killer while hes breaking pallet? Dont downvote for no reason, its way more easier that flashlight saving someone.
---
Yes, Not all of them
---
Yes and still didn't get anybody else as they were at the exits already.
---
He‚Äôs not a fog whisperer because he‚Äôs been given a short ban at one point for a video where noob3 and him were playing around with a glitch in a public match. Fog whisperers supposedly have to never have served a ban
---
Rank 17 detected.
---
No hard tunneling ruins the game. The survivor being tunneled has a miserable time, the other survivors are left to just hold M1 on gens all game.
---
Now you‚Äôre right its not the killers job to entertain, however it is the job to make the game fun for everyone and they should be doing more than just adding DS to give players more of an incentive to not tunnel
---
What do you mean tunneled? 
---
Like it was one long chase? Or something else?
---
 November 27th
---
Been playing on it the past few weeks when at work, usually survivor is 20-60 seconds, killer is like up to 5-10 mins
---
Ok buyer of an ebay acc
---
That's weird I never got it until they came in, hopefully they figure it out soon!
---
You're still a scummy cunt though.
---
For the ruining experiences part, if they considered tunneling as ruining someone else‚Äôs experience then so much stuff would get banned. Other things fall under that category and it‚Äôs called gameplay sabotage.  
---
You being/not being in a SWF isn‚Äôt really relevant. It‚Äôs not like the killer knows.
---
had to remove please edit names out thank you
---
He literally said to me in a message. That others were is a swf group as a reason why he tunneled.
---
I never had to wait this long. Fastest was 1 day and longest was 4 days. Maybe something went wrong? I would send a new ticket by this point
---
Why? Because I like it!
---
Nope.
---
People dc vs literally anything now. Just got a game as trapper and someone Dc'd vs him to.
---
It‚Äôs a common outfit, they lack head pieces for most survivors, and are recolors of the originals.
---
I'm 100% down for that Wraith.
---
Yeah they've pushed it with a couple moris (Hag, Clown, and now Oni) having dismemberment but others are definitely toned down (Demogorgon, Hillbilly/Leatherface).
---
Susie, nurse, pig, huntress.... Yes, yes, YES
---
In my experience as a killer main, survivors leave very early for 2 reasons. The first is that they are found very quickly by the killer at the start of the match, and thus start the chasing/hitting/hooking sequence before they can do anything at all. Sometimes this is their fault, like sprinting into an open area willy nilly. Other times it's kind of the game's fault, like if the killer has spawned too close to a survivor.
---
The other reason is the survivor bails when they see which killer it is and don't care for that killer. Whenever I play doctor, almost without fail someone disconnects when the first survivor does their crazy scream. The doctor isn't top tier but he is super annoying to play against. The spirit also inspires a lot of disconnects.
---
That being said, willfully disconnecting is shitty.
---
Noed on spirit no less
---
I don't even want to know what kind of games you are playing in 2019
---
Looks good
---
I‚Äôll believe you. But that sounds a little outlandish and I‚Äôve never heard of that happening to anyone. 
---
Just move onto the next game. This game really isn‚Äôt worth getting mad over.
---
God you are just a special type of stupid huh
---
Michael was probably near the gen, and out of youre sight but he could pull you making it seem as he teleported. I only know this as it has happend to me on both sides
---
And I usually do, unless the game is nearing end, most time I end up getting both
---
Ffs, moments away...
---
Very true. However, when someone unhooks in front if me, I always try to focus on the guy farming rather than the one being farmed. After all, I want to punish the idiot, not the victim.

"‚ÄúWhere is she?‚Äù he demanded"

It's a pretty loose definition to begin with. I'd say once you're requesting the moderators to remove it, you're asking in an authoritative way.
---
The eye is just a part of any oni's mask. By oni I mean a creature appearing in japanese folklore.
---
As a killer main, I don't go for the person that got unhooked right in front of me. They can't do anything about it and it isn't their fault there was nothing they could do about it. I always go after the dildo-licker that dives the hook.

Me too

I often only get 1 stack because I'm ass and I don't see any extra BPs for that. Feels bad
---
It is boring as hell to play against. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the new Legion.
---
There‚Äôs no reason for Freddy to even have gen slowdown add ons anymore. Old Freddy had to at least walk across the map and get close to a survivor to put them to sleep. New Freddy can go afk and the survivors will still receive a gen slowdown for free. It‚Äôs bs.
---
Dude you cant play Jane her ass is the biggest hitbox
---
*unhooks ally right in front of the killer causing them to immediately be downed again, hooked, and sacrificed* ‚Äú...who killed Dwight?‚Äù
---
No. Farming your teammate off the hook is scummy.
---
2- How could you know they're cheating, I mean many times I pretend I haven't seen a surv to get closer so I can hit them easily
---
Well I honestly can't wait to see how you depect the oni.
---
After the rework it's 3 max now
---
Are you trying to make me broke? I've already spent a few hundred dollars on this game.
---
Got me again
---
Chains also applies the speed debuff for awake survivors. At least one survivor will be in the dream world so it's a 3% for everyone. In that period, ruin and thanathophobia will do their job (because that survivor will be probably injured). He gets hooked and it's a 3% of Dying Light plus a 25% for Pop. If someone else is in the dream world they have two counters: or lose time by waking up with the clock, or fail a skill check and losing progress, which means killer will have more time to injuring and hooking someone else and repeating the process. Jump Rope also applies 9% to sleeping survivors. Thanathophobia decrease healing speed, and injured survivors will be asleep so it's at least a 6% everytime you are healing.
---
I‚Äôll usually tell them they did something like this when they complain, explain why I didn‚Äôt run across the map and instead attack the Nea standing right there out in the open. If they continue, then I just roll my eyes and tell them to keep feeding me their salt, it gives me power.
---
Regardless of the new narrative that ‚Äúanyone can pick up spirit and 4k‚Äù, the fact is she isn‚Äôt that easy to use. Less experienced players aren‚Äôt as good at predicting survivor movement, they hass less confidence in phasing and so they often get looped. Which is why many low rank spirits rely on tunnel and NOED to win. They‚Äôll get one hook, walk away then phase walk back to try and catch a survivor unhooking. If nobody is there they‚Äôll keep repeating this until they catch the unhook happening then go for the tunnel.
---
Also goes to show you can give players a really strong killer but it still wont stop them resorting to cheap tactics to win.
---
Very smart. There's also always the chance the unhookee has Borrowed Time, so it's always worth going for the unhooker.
---
Absolute power play, good stuff lol
---
People sometimes think I‚Äôm being friendly when I run play with your food, lol.
---
Does no mither completely counter oni? Would running all 4 survivors as oni neutralize his power. I know monto mentioned that and how it would be too op to do that.
---
"Why didnt you get up"
---
i actually cant anymore. i quit
---
They sell reasonable facsimiles of BDSM gear. Don't use "BDSM" gear you get from the mall.
---
Nice. Now you can give Bill flashbacks.
---
Yeah idk. You don‚Äôt leave any blood at all, so I don‚Äôt think his power would work. It wouldn‚Äôt really matter anyways, since his power is an insta down.
---
Exposed
---
Its boring for sure, especilly as freddy is fine without that crappy build. Hopefully people get bored of it soon
---
Playing her is now even more frustrating now, though she's still viable
---
I‚Äôve learned to dodge lobby‚Äôs if more than one TTV is in the room. Usually it‚Äôs a broadcast SWF, and the killer runs a Mori and NOED every single time. I guess just to tunnel and Mori them on their stream. The match turns into a shit show real fast üòÇ
---
I hope you showed no mercy
---
Are these pc issues?  Iv never seen 2 killers in a game.
---
Instead of pharmacy inner strength
---
No, second wind
---
I think its ok tbh. Its nice playing a trial that doesn't last 4 mins.
---
I hope you did what must be done. Did not hesitate and showed no mercy
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true you‚Äôre kind of countering his ability with a perk that allows you to get instantly downed with just m1. It‚Äôs not very balanced in terms of new killer ability but it does kind of sort itself out
---
Really? I've even seen it happen to popular streamers quite awhile back.
---
You don‚Äòt leave blood trails, but the orbs should still spawn, shouldn‚Äòt they?
---
Lmao if I played survivor I would definitely do that.
---
If I come across TTV players, I like to run NOED and Franklin‚Äôs. You have no idea how many people I‚Äôve seen literally run right back to me to pick up their item and then run away again ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it‚Äôs shameful really.
---
Sounds toxic mate. Better to just end their suffering fast imo.
---
No they need to fix that damn framrate
---
It‚Äôs not clear if the orbs are generated when you leave blood or not. I think it is, hence why lucky break is a perk, to counter his ability.
---
It seems some survivors underestimate how long the scratch marks stay so they don‚Äôt realise how visible they actually are
---
The spirit pretty much killed everyone while I was standing still in awe.
---
No no I think all killer should get sweater trapper clown you know
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
I did read it. You are complaining about a green+purple add-on combo that can be countered by waking up, plus two perks where one requires most of your team to be injured and the second that takes at least half a game worth of hooks to actually make any noticeable effect. 
---
Wanna heal fast and completely bypass healing speeds? Run Inner Strength. Ruin can be found easily so no idea what the problem with it is, Thana can also be bypassed once you heal quickly with perks like the above mentioned IS. Dying Light takes ages to actually make a difference and is only really good when Thana kicks in too. 
---
Jump Rope+Swing Chains? Wake up. There are many add-ons that are "impossible to counter" in the sense that you cannot simply do anything about them and that does not make them OP. This is a combo of green+purple add-ons, it¬¥s not like every Freddy will have it every game.
---
Yes, thank you! I knew I couldn‚Äôt be the only one!
---
It‚Äôs treason, then
---
You should create a concept card for him. 
---
I don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôd do a mine map.
---
I haven't played it, but have watched a few videos, and you're right. It doesn't look like anything I'd be interested in, but I want that mask. It alone is worth the $24.95. ü§£
---
Lol that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying.
---
It's better you learn that fact this way then by surprise. It will be okay.
---
LMFAO
---
Killers get enough free kills from rank 20s
---
It is clear, blood orbs are not linked to blood pools. Even without testing its clear from the addon that increases frequency of blood orb drops.
---
From no mither, to hemorrhage nothing increases or decreases the amount of blood orbs other then addons.
---
why'd you stop moving after
---
As a console player. RIP

How cute. Who else will chase them out and get hit bloodpoints but you?

Seriously? Haha, I didn't notice them before
---
Just fail one skillcheck you dumbass
---
Too wholesome for this subreddit bucko
---
Good times
---
Guess I should have put more info huh
---
Legacy is a cosmetic. Hence, OK groomer
---
Interrupt so many survivors by grabbing them mid action, think it‚Äôs 25 times
---
Very nice play aswell. Nice job.
---
Why does Billy have a choker?
---
There's hardly any blood because he absorbed it all
---
The community wanted this
---
How is it toxic?
---
I‚Äôm going to assume they will sooner or later just give these masks for free since the devs are trying to give everyone all the exclusive stuff
---
Yeah sorry should of mentioned that
---
2 ppl healing is 2 people not on gens. If you‚Äôre still chasing one person and the first doesn‚Äôt have SC 1or2 teammates will help him heal. Aka not doing gens. If you catch the unhooker, which you should quickly if they unsafely hooked and you hit them, you restart the cycle and less people are on gens.
---
I hope so too actually. We should all have the same content.
---
How else will you down the guy unhooked in front of you if you werent facecamping. This post is irrelevant
---
Not your fault lol. Hoping they make some way to earn them. Dont really care for the fact they were exclusive I just like that trapper mask lol
---
They're giving it away for free? LUL
---
Ok dad
---
I feel the same way
---
Me as survivor: fuck, it's a doctor
---
Me as killer: fuck yeah, doctor
---
I‚Äôd honestly be shocked and disappointed if we did not. Since the devs are giving us every other exclusive cosmetic it would be weird not to give us this
---
Why is Quentin only the one who's not getting a Christmas cosmetic?
---
*Cries in Quentin main*
---
Okay captain obvious
---
r/dbdgonewild would have a great and glorious field day
---
or in the basement for some reason on mobile
---
Since the game is going to shutdown very soon ya
---
this just seemed rude not intimidating and I bet all 5 people in this vid nows that
---
Deddobai aka dbd in Katakana.
---
Wait where is billy boy?
---
but at what cost?
---
Nothing in this game is worse than bad survivor teammates. Sweaty perks and annoying mechanics and anything else annoying in this game can't compare to the infuriating experience of a bad survivor either ignoring you on hook altogether (letting you die on first hook is the worst) or people farming or mindlessly leading the killer to you.
---
Yeah but then SWF queues would take forever because who the hell would want to play against a SWF
---
Moris are harder to pip noob
---
Its me I failed the check sorry
---
since no one answered you yet, you most likely started blinding too soon. if you start blinding as soon as he starts lifting your blind will hit during invuln frames. You need to start the flashlight roughly when the surv is just going on his shoulder, about ~2.5 seconds after he started lifting. Then your blind will trigger just as soon as hes out of invuln animation and he will drop the surv and get stunned.
---
Woah, I never knew Deathgarden was developed by Behaviour. I always thought it was a competitor title to Dead By Daylight, lol.
---
Makes sense.
---
F for all the poor fuckers who bought it for Meg/Trapper cosmetic.
---
You either don‚Äôt play often or not at all if you think dedicated works fine. I have 9 ping and my dead hard only works like 25% of the time. I get hit through windows after I‚Äôm running two feet away. Get slapped mid fall through a window.
---
That's the risk you take when you buy a game with a player base that isn't super huge. Do feel bad for them though, but I don't think they really need to be reimbursed, unless they bought the game like a week before they announced the "plug pulling".
---
The day they add a gun to this game is the day it dies.
---
&gt;:(
---
On console too?
---
You act like this is a bad thing
---
i mean, it wasnt really  there all along. the oni is just a japanese folklore
---
Its a Pretty Cool Killer and Mechanics! Sadly, i don't actually know if the devs will ever add a Terminator, as they already added it in his other game Deathgarden,  but despite that i would love to see a Futurist like killer for a Change!
---
This game came out on console? I bever even heard of a release date wtf.
---
Dad-rolls!?
---
Nah. Just saying since I play dbd on console I cant get the cosmetics lol
---
That‚Äôs the guy lol
---
Tf is this? Downvote city it is
---
It isn‚Äôt more strategic. BT and DS exist, there‚Äôs no point in taking the chance and tunneling like that when you could easily just down the guy who unhooked instead.
---
But it's the only way to make him a decent killer again
---
If it makes you feel any better, the dedicated server bullshittery goes both ways.
---
Feck eff
---
Give into TEMPTATION!
---
True
---
I'm personally fond of current No Mither because it's supposed to be a challenge perk. I just wish it gave a bonus to bloodpoints. Preferably like BBQ where taking risks give you stacks to promote a more aggressive playstyle instead of a "hide in a corner into deadhard" that most people do with it.
---
But your text is bs lmao
---
Sorry. That was implied, of course!
---
diaper?
---
Underrated
---
I get so pissed when someone immediately unhooks me while the dude is right there
---
16
---
Those things are tame compared with people telling you to kill yourself, calling you trash, homophobic or sexist slurs etc.
---
Student in 3d modeling and animation here. The reason is probably because the artist was bored and thought it would be funny to add nipples as it takes literal seconds to add. You have no idea the amount of stupid bullshit me and my class like to add to models, animations, and textures just because we can. Mighy be another reason but it's a probable one from my perspective.
---
It's just frequently a giveaway when straight people's response to a gay thing is 'oh, I don't care about vulgar, flamboyant fucking!' given that vulgar, flamboyant fucking is often a homophobe's perception of gayness.
---
Yr response doesn't offend me, but we're very aware things can result in harassment. "Oh, you can't express yourself because you might get harrassed!" is something you hear from yr transphobic mom as a 14 year old who wants to wear a dress, it's much more frequently deployed as an excuse than anything. We are the most aware of the extent of harassment towards us, as we live it.
---
Well clearly they're a pro Myers
---
Imagine watching otz

r/BoneAppleTea
---
I‚Äôve had a couple tickets now. The longest wait I‚Äôve had is 5ish hours.
---
I did the exact same thing last night. I did 3/5 gens and the mfs abandoned me as soon as the door was open. I got out on the last attempt too üòÇ
---
And then losing:
---
Lol what
---
Playing solo surv on Xbox is like watching an informational slideshow on toxic players in dbd
---
His name is AngryPug! What kind of person did you expect?
---
Noob killer exposed hehe
---
Larry, I thought you were being executed by samurais, since when were you succed into a pocket dimension by an eldritch spider entity?
---
Holy cow, my boy Wraith lookin' like Stalker from Deathgarden:Bloodharvest (F for the game btw)
---
Definitely a must-have
---
A killer who hooks someone and doesn't leave the map is camping~
---
If you have STBFL, you should still hit the guy unhooking first because then you could get a potential 4 stacks instead of 2, and you get 2 downs instead of 1 because the guy on the hook can‚Äôt get away fast enough. In any case, being forced to slug the guy who got unhooked for an entire minute is pointless when you can down the unhooker for free and then target the guy you only need to hit once.
---
Noob killer spotted üôÉ
---
We do actually. Clown has no third eye but got plenty of maggots there.
---
IM A KILLER MAIN
---
Not reading the rest of the sentence
---
While this is cool, I really don't want any good looking killers. I want all the gnarliest shit out there
---
Trust me, so many times I‚Äôve been leaving the hook following a BBQ lead, only for some brazen Claudette who thinks she‚Äôs actually invisible to SPRINT past me for the unhook. I‚Äôm not just going to cover my eyes and ignore her, she could have waited maybe 3 seconds for me to continue my search on the other side of the map
---
I don‚Äôt know. I heard Shugpki‚Äôs cousin is here.
---
I'm curious what would happen if we did a little social experiment. For just one day, all the killers in the game throw out all the unwritten "nice" rules. Just pure no mercy mode for a full day for every single killer.
---
Edgy Myers
---
well, now you have to deal with shugoki‚Äôs descendant blue-looking ghosty bitch.
---
It's because if you start when they start picking up, they pretty much have flashlight invincibility frames, so you have to time it right, pallets are different because they don't get invinc frames at the start of breaking the pallet
---
Nope your out of luck. Sooner or later the devs will prob give it away since deathgarden is dead and the devs did want to get ride of the exclusive shit
---
My Dad is a boomer and is one of the most nicest and chill guys. So are his boomer Bros and sisters. I'm glad I'm not part of gen dipshit.

DC time

As someone who loved Scavenger gameplay, Deathgarden was *not* balanced. In the slightest.
---
Every single Hunter had the same base kit, which was Nurses' blink, Huntress' hatchets, Doctor's aoe reveal, and Pre-rework Freddy's aura revealing *baseline*. Then you started adding onto that where Inquisitor could drop turrets that could auto find you in a 30m radius, Stalker cut off your ammo supply, and Veteran cut you off from the Objective.
---
Add to this that Hunters could power up Drones which you either had to shoot to blow up (alerting the Hunter your location) or walk through (alerting the Hunter to your location) with Veteran and Stalker both getting two Drones for the price of one, and if the match went on long enough Scavengers had no room to move and no ammo to move there.
---
Add to the fact that each character had their own perk choices (Each Scavenger had two Power choices, two of six Perk choices and then two standard passives), and often a character would only have two Perks worth using (Fog had Speed on Reveal, Speed on Blood pickup, bonus ammo, bonus ammo, Urban Evasion, and shield on blood deposit, the two speed ones were his only good build) and that certain Scavengers didn't even have that (There was no point to take Switch since everything she did, someone else did better).
---
Add to all that, where progression was directly tied to how much damage you did; a Level 10 Gun may have reloaded 80% faster or did 20% more damage per bullet. The Poacher's Minigun had 50 more rounds in it after leveling it up, and Scavengers who could heal were healing double at max level. With no matchmaking, you'd run a brand new Hunter into a bunch of max rank Scavengers and just not be able to out damage the healing.
---
Honestly, the Devs kind of panicked after the reboot when the playerbase started dropping. It's a damn shame because it *could have been* **better** than DBD by a long shot. It just wasn't meant to be.
---
" WHAT DO YOU GET WHEN YOU CROSS A TEABAGGING SURVIVOR AND A DESTROYED RUIN"
---
Shiet I meant in general not just leigon. I just added leigon in there as an example cuz the video has leigon
---
Lol real Chads use Diversion. We don‚Äôt no adrenaline perk
---
Hiding in a locker to do all of these
---
Scott Jund is not a dude worth listening to.
---
I don't think it fits in Halloween ,but more of a "What if The Entity had Hot Topic"
---
Keep trying. 
---
If it happens again, take a screenshot and put in a bug report. Sometimes it is just a bug when challenges are not awarded. 
---
You can also run Windows of opportunity to help find pallets easier. It is what I did.
---
Other Survivor: Please, don‚Äôt mori me! I wasn‚Äôt anywhere near your ruin 
---
Killer: I missed the part where that‚Äôs my problem.
---
[This](https://imgur.com/a/vz04tkY)

However, what should you do when you just got to the hook (particularly if they're in struggle already) and the killer comes back around a corner from a different direction? Unhook and split up, or leave them for somebody else to realize it and hopefully run across half or more of the map in time? Because usually that seems to end up in the hooked guy dying and the unhooker getting downed as well.
---
Save the babies. Its funnier that way
---
Dwight looks like no ever told him of the beards and the bees
---
Is this a joke, right? -\_- next will be the legacy
---
Nah I've seen some musket ideas that work like huntress' hatchet that sounded viable. Ie: 1 bullet with a really long cool down and extremely short range, bullets that dont actually injure you they just mark you in some way, or you have no bullets and you litterly walk around bashing people in the head with the butt  or stab them with the sword attachment.
---
Demogorgon is too cute
---
Ok ty
---
Wow, that was really educational. Thank you so much!
---
It's very interesting that they even give survs different bra models and that the guy's torsos are fully textured with hair and all. So basically they give nipples to everyone without a bra, and since some of Yui's cosmetics are bustier-like it makes sense to not give her a bra. That really explains it. I'm assuming her legs are like everyone else's, right?
---
I'm hooked on those sweet sweet extra bp stacks. The best way I find to keep ruin up is to hit any survivors you see. Injure as many as you can at the beginning of match. They will be to busy healing or risk running around looking for ruin getting downed easy because they chose to look instead of heal. I go no where near ruin at the beginning and kind of chase and injure in the same area of the map. Tricks them in to thinking it's in that area. Ruin is a good perk because the slowdown and the mindgame you could use to snowball them. If killers did not have to run BBQ or ruin then they would run other perks that would kill you easier or make pallets useless. Keep that in mind. I run small game in solo so I find ruin and do any totems I come across. I go weeks before I get downed by NOED because I love the extra bp from totems. So for my play style ruin does not bother me. Lastly. You can find skill check trainers in the app stores. I mess around with the trainer in lobbies or waiting for lobbies then I would hit great skill checks consistently. The skill check trainers really help with your timing. Try it out. I'm using one I found built into a DBD app on Android.
---
BTW, can you also see maskless characters with that method?
---
I mean BT and DS exist, so while its not written anywhere to go for other guy, its better to go for other guy If you are playing for win. As a a guy who play mostly survivor, i can t tell you how many times did killer try to tunnel me after i got unhooked and at that moment lost the whole game, because he wanted to turn it in 3v1 or less.
---
You People don t understand how easy it is to waste killer time for 3 gens. Here is example:
---
Survivor unhook me in terror radius, i get BT, killer hits me, i get speedboost and use it to get to a loop, killer is rushing to kill me, i get happy because in this moment i know i won us the game, i loop him till endgame collapse, get caught and facecamped, gg nice tunnel. In red ranks rarely do i see killer going for the unhooked,and going more for the People who unhook, because its the smartest thing. Just want to add one more thing, If killer finds me at begginning of a game i can loop him for minimun 4 gens If they are m1 killers like bubba or legion. I will never know how other survivors get caught in less then minute, like at 1 jungle gym i can waste 1 minute of your time and no thing you can do.
---
Not sure. This one clearly isn't but I don't remember hearing anything about it being a pc exclusive problem. Never happened to me anyway. I'm on xbox and ps4.
---
Streamers, Youtubers, the entire community. All talking about how since the dedicated servers. Killers cannot grab action anymore. Yes. Clearly the top ranked players are all using bad connections.
---
Game on bitch. The sequel
---
Gimmie Lolita Susie and I'm good!
---
It's toxic to give the hatch?
---
This is why I slam the hatch on 'em and let them open the gate. Gives them a nice scare, too :)
---
YES
---
I mean I watch otz but I haven‚Äôt seen him toxic unless for a joke. Like the most toxic I‚Äôve seen him is the survivor approved build and he jokingly  writes ‚Äòyou dumb piece of shit‚Äô. I just want evidence of you can.
---
I absolutely adore the hag outfit and the clown one gave me a good chuckle
---
someone else in the comments is gonna put "this is why i play on Ps4"
---
Well, she got no legs textures. But, maybe, it will be somewhere in the future. On the release of Demise of the Unfaithful Jane also had no legs textures, but then devs added them with summer skin
---
D strike with locker is so fking anooying
---
Damn thats sad, it actually looked good
---
STBFL + Unrelenting = easy game for killer
---
It's typical of BHVR to go overboard when trying to nerf something, they gutted Freddy and left him pathetic for years, they gutted Legion and are only just trying to fix that now.  
---
They went too far with the Nurse nerfs, and they are about to go too far with Spirit,  
---
But yes, I'm sure it's just "killer mains bitching" and not people who want to see the game healthy and balanced because they enjoy being competitive and having fair games.
---
O
---
I will kill for that spirit cosmetic to exist.
---
Yep. I want to make a post somewhere in the future with maskless killers ;3
---
That's why I always play pig. Amanda may not be the strongest killer by far, but I fucking love the saw movies and how she plays, so I'm a pig Boi *oinks*
---
Good one
---
I personally do this to rank 20's to spook em. If you want to have a ton of fun, while cloaked hold the uncloak button until it bing bongs a singular time. It won't decloak you but it'll make the survivors hear it ans your terror radius slightly and make them go "What the fuck is going on!" And get spooked. It's very fun to see immersed rank 20's get spooked.
---
Yay! &lt;3
---
If I may, would you kindly start with Amanda? We really haven't got a decent unmasked render of her yet, they all look weird.
---
ThIs Is WhY i PlAy On Ps4
---
I dont even have one
---
The freddy nerf was part of a bigger problem: His design. Now that his design has been changed he's in a better place.
---
As for killer mains bitching, yeah. They do. They don't play the other side, so they don't have any other perspective than their own. Same goes for survivor mains.
---
Nurse and Spirit are problematic. Nobody except idiots are calling them OP. They are just incredibly unfun for many to go against. And you have to realize BHVR never intended this game to be competitive. It's assymetric, it'll never happen.
---
Don't forget the amount of nerfs on Survivors lately either. Killers downright have it easy now unless they're facing SWF but that's another issue. Solo is unplayable at this point.
---
I got SOOOO lucky...
---
I did 2 gens and this stupid fucking Wraith kept coming to my 3rd one. It was around 90% when I saw him coming in the distance I was literally screaming at my TV "CMOOOOOOON!!!". He downed me at the gen... but I JUST did it. Fuck, I was so happy lmao
---
This is true. A shitty teammate is worse than a toxic killer Imho. But on the flip side of this gen rushing isn‚Äôt toxic. Doing gens is literally a survivors only goal. Doing them fast just means we are good at the o my thing we have.
---
I mean, Stalker would be easy since you could just say that the power armor and her guns won't work anymore due to not being able to be maintained, but the Entity let her keep the invisibility and (actually fair, fun, and not bullshit) drone revealers so she has decent tracking capabilities.
---
Fog could easily just have a perk that gives 5% bonus speed for 10/15/20 seconds after a gen pops or something.
---
the oni isn't spirit's dad
---
Its better to do that anyway, you have to juggle to apply pressure in this game, if you chase one survivor in the higher ranks its 99% of the time a automatic loss for you.
---
It's not. In every PVP game once you start playing for a long time, you realise there might be a better way of playing, to play in a more optimal way. Many pros do this in other games. Now, this is not an esport game nor a competitive one, but the idea of playing more optimally it's the same. Wheter it gives an advantage or not it's up to you, someone else might find advantageous another setting, and everyone can use it, therefore it's not cheating by any means.
---
I already have one :)
---
The last image in the post with renders of the last Amanda's outfit. You can find that post in my profile
---
Hopefully they add cross progression so I can play on PC
---
People actually thought luck offerings applied to chests? Weird.
---
I'd cry if I had two right hands, too.
---
Always a bad time
---
I'm really loving the new challenges but I have better shit to read than DBD lore lol.
---
Always check if they're SWF in the lobby, if possible.
---
If they turn out to be one, then I'll gladly """"""tunnel"""""" the unhooked in those situations, to ensure they're extra-salty when they get sacrificed to the entity. Plus, denies altruism points to the dipshit who unhooked him in the first place, and saves me the time having to chase someone.
---
jeez, i'm just saying it's weird that he knows what it is but didn't spell it because he didn't know how to do ≈ç
---
I haven't been buying skins much before (Legion's Joey &amp; Susie were the only ones), but I'd buy the hell out of these. Great job)
---
In most of the games I play solo I have time to finish A gen before things go south.
---
Me: *follows scratchmarks by the hook and opens a nearby locker*
---
Teabagging, trashtalking, DCing Claudette mains: ‚ÄúThis is not the law of equivalent exchange.‚Äù
---
I feel like the way you worded it shouldve been an indicator that it was sarcasm. But I guess people can't pick up on it. Eirher way instantly downvoting people when they're not even sure of the intent of the post/comment makes no sense.
---
Huntress and Plague are making me feel some things. I like it. 
---
gimme Society Clown too
---
Those options dont give bonus bloodpoints, they stack that score event up to the cap significantly faster meaning you‚Äôd still be stuck at 32k.
---
But, anyway, I want to make renders of all her skins

I'm a "survivor main" (900h survivor and 30h killer). :D

Just started playing killer recently and thought about it.

And after the people pointing it out, I agree that I shouldn't feel bad for bodyblocking killers. :)

##The Keeper
---
*Music: [Chase](https://youtu.be/3bK01Oxqv9A)*
---
###Primary Weapon: Tenderizer Hammer (lunge attacks use the meat sack The Keeper carries in his right hand)
---
###Power: Teleport
---
The Keeper can plant a safe by **holding down the Actions button**. Up to **5** safes can be present at a time. If the number exceeds this limit, subsequent safes **replace** old ones, starting with the oldest. Once a safe is planted, it's visible to The Keeper through surfaces. The Keeper can teleport to it by hovering his cursor over it, and **holding down the Power Button** (an animation will player where The Keeper breaks his own neck). After using Teleport, The Keeper must wait for his **power gauge** to recharge over **30 seconds** before being able to do so again.
---
###Power: The Evil Within
---
The Keeper gains a **token** each time a Survivor is rescued from a hook. *Abilities like this discourage face-camping.*
---
- 1 Token: The Keeper's lunge distance is increased by **1 meter**.
---
- 2 Tokens: Injured and Dying Survivors are afflicted with **Hemorrhage**. Additionally, **10%** of all bloodstains become portals, from which **Laura** (spider form) can ambush Survivors. If a Survivor is attacked by Laura, their position is revealed to The Keeper. After freeing themselves from Laura's clutches, the Survivor is left in the Injured state. *These traps function just like The Trapper's.*
---
- 3 Tokens: All Survivors are afflicted with **Madness** for **60 seconds**. **Ruvik** periodically appears near Survivors, causing them to scream, revealing their auras to The Keeper. *Survivors can snap out of it.*
---
Once the effects of the final token end, all tokens **reset**.
---
###Perks
---
**Ceaseless Pursuit**
---
An insatiable thirst for blood compels you. While in a chase, your movement speed is increased by **2%** every **24/20/16 seconds**, stackable to a maximum of **6%**. This effect resets when the chase ends.
---
**No Salvation**
---
You refuse to accept failure. If all Survivors are alive when the final generator is activated, the Entity seals off one of the exit gates for **40/60/80 seconds**.
---
**Acute Senses**
---
Unlocks the potential in one's **Aura-reading** ability.
---
Your senses are specially attuned to distress. Whenever a Survivor fails a skill check, their aura is revealed to you for **2/3/4 seconds**, as well as the auras of any Survivors standing within **8** meters of them.
---
##Sebastian Castellanos
---
*Music: [Lobby](https://youtu.be/L9Ku28S-fpI)*
---
**Experienced Detective**
---
You notice things that others don't. You can see highlighted footprints left by the Killer. Each footprint disappears after **60 seconds**.
---
**Strong Mind**
---
Years of challenges in your life have granted you heightened mental tolerance. The durations of **Blindness**, **Broken**, **Madness**, and **Oblivious** are reduced by **20/30/40%**.
---
**Fortune**
---
You have an uncanny ability to beat crippling odds. Your Luck is increased by **10/15/20%**.
---
&gt;Ready to don't
---
Love it
---
You forgot inner strength
---
Dude you‚Äôre reaching at this point. It‚Äôs fine to have a head canon, but Sally hanging herself (or even committing suicide) isn‚Äôt mentioned or even implied in her lore at all.
---
This would both be trapper
---
You could try using a compressor. My sound card came with a software one.
---
I wish I was playing in these days
---
XD  
---
Thanks, I had a good laugh) And the drawing style is very cute and expressive)
---
New map: The Mall, except every store is a Hot Topic and one candy store.
---
The crossplay is between pc and pc, queue times get better for killer when you get higher rank wise but it can still take 5-10 minutes at times.
---
I mean seems just like a wraith with a copied over dg thing. I‚Äôm not opposed to it. Honestly I play both but I thought dg was way better and more fun. Guess they couldn‚Äôt secure a stranger things contract for dg. Like they even tried. This kinda pisses me off man I like this game. Way more then that mess they hold so high dbd.
---
Also, I assume you‚Äôre on PC, correct? Just like blinking with nurse on console, it‚Äôs a bit more difficult to execute, genuinely speaking
---
the 1 metre increased lunge is p dumb and broken
---
I swear dude, sabo squads not only sabotage hooks, they sabotage their own fucking game.
---
Who said anything about getting pips?
---
 Huntress looks like a total sugar mama, I want this so bad.  Great work. &lt;3
---
Before Dedicated servers: Lag hits happen every third to fourth game
---
Everyone hates it.
---
After Dedicated servers: Lag hits happen barely at all.
---
People shit on dedicated servers. 
---
Fucking toxic assholes.
---
The 5R
---
Honestly though I‚Äôm not too much a fan of the lore from the chronicles. 
---
They have so many. Short sentences. Like this. With only a few words. To each of them.
---
And that goes from dull to agitating for me to read very quickly. So much potential to make these backstories really good, but for me, the writing simply isn‚Äôt there anymore.
---
Yeah. Because it's such a long read, right?
---
I'm running noed and mori everytime. That's the risk you run with TTV.
---
Is it? It's basically what Michael Myers gets with his third token, minus the increased speed.
---
Mori's are pre-rendered animations that just play out, the prestige is adding another layer ontop of an existing model, the model has to be able to move in multiple directions often quickly.
---
The blood has to remain static on the body at all times, with a mori the blood just appears on the model briefly then dissapears.
---
How to not look like killer. Clean clothes
---
Boy are you asbestos because you just gave me mesothelioma
---
Man deathgarden is terrible.
---
I could see a killer with a  gun being possible, the only issue is that it may end up being to close to Huntress, and the outcome will either be 1 makes the other obsolete or they are to similar as it will fundamentally have to play like how she does.
---
Obviously Myers is the capricorn golden saint and have the excalibur on his hands
---
I got the sarcasm. Because this is humorous post .... right EVERYONE?
---
A nerf gun on a midget killer that shoots darts at your knee caps/shoes and makes you squeak for 15 seconds sounds about right.
---
The memes man! Live by the memes! Lol
---
So Keeper is just a Jag.
---
The most interesting part is to recreate their faces "before their death". I have already made Trapper and Clown, because they got some really natural-like faces, that are pretty easy to modify
---
Inb4 trying it out myself and teleporting myself to the basement by accident
---
Well my money was wasted...
---
Wait which one is the plague
---
Essentially the only comment in your post history that isn't downvoted. Good job.
---
Plague really looks like Sae Nijima from P5 &lt;3
---
r/redditsings
---
Next level mind games. It's definitely possible to outplay yourself.
---
I hate when teammates unhook in front of the killer
---
Yeah I guess. Idk man I‚Äôm not opposed to copying over but I think it will just feel like the characters got a huge down grade without all those abilities and guns/vambrace.
---
Idk man this hits me in a way. I‚Äôve been on console for a long time and finally got a new pc because my friend showed me dg and wanted me to play. It was the first pc game I played in like 7 years.
---
Yes, this is called the battle bong build. You spam your bell until you hit a survivor. You use the add on that gives you map wide bong bong and the add on that increases the speed of bing bong.
---
Tbf it would cost them development time and a whole chapter of which they‚Äôd get nothing of interest
---
Are you a fan of  "Joker"? üòÇ
---
Btw, Trapper before death is really looks a lot alike Brezhnev XD
---
Idk why I laughed so hard at this
---
It's an iconic ability he has. Not including it would be blasphemous.
---
I personally prefer playing on The Game more than Lery's with the Scratched Mirror.
---
Simply because your assaults are almost as good while you receive so much more information from the aura reading thanks to how the map itself is designed. Due to the 2 floors being of almost identical size, you'll not just know who's within 32 metres of range, but also who's within 32 metres of range on BOTH floors at the same time.
---
Once you also know how to make use of drop downs and you low terror radius, this map is just as good, if not maybe even a bit better for Scratched Mirror. Atleast in my opinion.
---
But after all the years that one's still my favorite Michael build. Besides of Perma EW 3 + Dead Rabbit, going for the gen zone of doom with Distressing, Unnerving and Overcharge.
---
Michael's probably the most interesting character in terms of gameplay design. Simply because his abillity is blunt as hell, while you're one of the most flexibile mofo's around.
---
I get that you get extra bp but there's not really a lot of counters for it like you're making it seem bbq is a win win perk for killers . you get one hook you either know exactly where someone else is or the area to look in. Playing survivor you'll assume every killers running bbq and adjust how you would play and they don't even have it. only thing i could say if your playing swf it makes you predictable because the guy you just hooked knows who the killers going for next. Other then that you pretty much smash anyone without communication. Im sure most ppl would disagree but i would like it if bbq showed the killers aura to all survivors as well . seeing how most survivor perks arent super one sided like that one. Ruin i think is fine imo im still pretty new and i can hit the ruin skill checks pretty well.
---
I imagine they're going to try their hand at a futuristic killer at some point, and copying someone over from DG would be cheaper than trying to make another brand new character from scratch.
---
Why you do him like that?
---
Cheaper isn‚Äôt always better
---
All of that is true no matter who the killer goes for.  If the person can loop well it will be tough.
---
As much as I love the meme's, I respect Otz so damn much for always having faith in the community. While his expectations and hopes have been absolutely abused and violated several times, he doesn't lose faith that the good part of this community is actually much bigger than many would expect.
---
Killa is that you?
---
Now this is a good idea
---
I like the look of this head piece with that jacket from the rift and the pants from that older chinese jake samurai outfit.
---
To be fair, 90% of Fog's powers weren't used due to being weak, and you could copy him over pretty easily to get the feel of the game. I've got a concept for his perks already, just going to figure out something for Stalker.
---
It's not always worse, either.
---
Myers, Nurse, Hag, and Spirit are my favorite. And I guess that one is Plague? Nice.
---
Ok well can I clarify  something? I meant why didn‚Äôt she get up first because it looked like she had unbreakable and was asking if they didn‚Äôt know you couldn‚Äôt open the hatch while downed
---
You should really do one with Hillbilly in it
---
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about! That would be great! =)
---
By saying charge attack I meant charge attacks in general, not this case. And if you can not find more unique ability for the killer, then why do you propose him anyway? He will be just a reskin.
---
It gets tremendously difficult to complete objectives and goals. Same can be told for Archives challenges. I would like to participate in the games who are experienced. Don't get me wrong, I also do love playing with new people but the amount of knowledge a person has really affects your overall game when they are your teammate.
---
he's so squeaky, you broke him lmao
---
Not only are grabs non-existent, but you have to make an active choice to swing early, so the survivor doesn't Sprint Burst away during the grab animation that won't actually work. 
---
D:
---
I call bullshit when I see it. It's nothing personal.
---
Or the one Dwight you hhave to run from because he can't hit a single skill check at rank 11
---
Whispers with monitor makes it easier to know if a survivor is near and to hide when putting down traps. Not saying it's best build. But It's something I'm trying out. Trapper can be hard in red ranks. Place traps in obvious but also less obvious spots that are often traveled.
---
A mori is an animation that always plays out the same way, through walls, through ground and through obstacles, nothing changes how it plays out.
---
Each cosmetic has different parts that move and can even be entirely different, it would have to be custom made for all existing cosmetics, and any future cosmetics. At worst, they would look absolute ass and people would complain, and at best it doubles the time to make the cosmetic but it looks good.
---
IKR? This is my second most-wanted chapter, just behind Silent Hill.
---
Soviet burocrat skin for Trapper when??
---
I don't know how anyone enjoys watching this manchild.
---
 Very true
---
***You, don't touch my totem***
---
Yeah that's true but you wouldn't believe the amount of douchebags who unhook in front of you without borrowed time.
---
I guess that's true, I just have enough bad experiences at high ranks that once I get past rank 10 I basically stop playing until ranks reset because it's just not fun.
---
\*entity gives safety pip\* "Now get out of here" "safety pip? the devs said a tie game is 2 dead 2 escape, i killed 3!" "check it again trap head! The match was for 3 minutes, and you beat'em in 2. You're lucky you got that."
---
You basically need corrupt, probably ruin too but they don't synergize well since those 3 gens blocked gives them a reason to be running around looking for ruin.
---
Other then that, red ranks have been playing a long ass time and usually won't fall for the standard "hurrdurr i placed a trap under window so innovative" trapper playstyle so you need to set them in places that a survivor would run through without thinking about traps.
---
Pig and Plague lookin kinda sekZ üò≥
---
Based on what?
---
Hey buddy I think you got the wrong door, the leather club is two blocks down.
---
That‚Äôs what I was saying on the bar i couldn‚Äôt see it very well and I couldn‚Äôt see the find help on it so I thought she could get up
---
I JUST GOT ON THANKSGIVING BREAK IT‚ÄôS GAMER TIME
---
The pants dont fit. Everything else, A+
---
Killers have powers, survivors have friends.
---
dont watch tru3, only thing you will learn is how to complain and insult your team.
---
I've done this fuck knows how many times. If I hear whispers, OoO, scratch marks or your aura for some reason why do you think I'm just gonna go "ho hum, rule 254 says I can't attack a survivor after hooking someone until 45 seconds have passed, better run away like a dumbass!". Bitch, if I see you then I'm probably coming for your ass.
---
Unbreakable is meta until they nerf DS
---
Why even bother to post this?.. God damn you people can't take a loss
---
R.I.P Deathgarden, you will be missed
---
Hope you weren't the infamous "GG piece of shit"
---
Can we also talk about the long ass backstories for the new characters? It reminds of me of Vigil and Dokkabei in R6 getting mini novellas for their bios.
---
I don't mind extensive lore but the Oni's is basically 10 paragraphs of him murdering people. Did little to develop him at all with much text.
---
that game was doomed from the start, horribly killer sided
---
Who‚Äôs that with the deer skull?
---
Then dont heal ?
---
I need these in my life.
---
I generally want to hit the injured survivor because I know they'll go down, personally. If the unhooked is injured I'll clock him first.
---
10-50 second survivor lobbies at prime times such as 4P.M. to  8 or 9P.M. usually 20seconds to 2minutes after.
---
Killer is usually 30 seconds to 4 minutes but can be inconsistently instantaneous or slow seemingly at random.
---
I will call everyone bad if I get farmed to death.  Survivors who unhooked me: your idiots and should be punished for your stupid bullshit  Killers who make my game last 25 seconds after I get off the hook: Stop condoning this damn bullshit it's not fun to die instantly when I have no control over my damn character.
---
You saying "exploits" and "bugs" to things that used to be game mechanics doesn't seem very rational.
---
The pallet vacuum was dumb, I agree. Instant blinds too. But... all this is history so why is this an argument *now*?
---
It's irrelevant. The matter of fact is that right now, at this very moment, not a year ago; Solo survivor is miserable and the amount of fun for survivor has declined massively. Again, only idiots are complaining about killers being op. The majority of us are concerned about the health of the game as it gets less and less fun.
---
I mostly play killer now unless I have friends to SWF with.
---
They've made plenty of games (Fallout Shelter being one of the big ones), it's just that DBD is their first huge mainstream hit.
---

---

---
Didn't know they made fallout shelter never noticed that's strange
---
I try to stick to the nobody left behind but when the killer has me backed up into an exit gate then that's all I can do, give you time.
---
Feel bad for the guy lol
---
On PC, Dead Hard is still broken. Dunno if it has to do with latency but it has become really hard to use, more to gain distance than to dodge a hit.

Ohh, okay.  That one is probably my favorite, but they‚Äôre all really interesting!
---
It's no longer the neck man and I really wish people would stop saying that. They moved the hit box to the face strictly tons of patches ago
---
She literally has a noose around her neck and is dangling like a person hanging from a noose. I really doubt that its just for the looks
---
It's between windows store and steam
---
until first nemesis
---
Otz has much more patience than me, kudos to him
---
Ha hahahaha hahahaha no
---
&gt;No. This doesn't fit the theme in any way, shape or form.
---
Silly cosmetics, Christmas cosmetics, BBQ event cosmetics, Chinese New year cosmetics, charms.
---
&gt;There's nothing in the game involving sexuality at all. Nothing. 
---
Spirit, Myers, Huntress and so on are heavily sexualized in the community and some in game (spirit). Even cosmetics for survivors to show more skin is a form of sexuality so idk what are you talking about
---
&gt;I'm not against the community, but bright pink and blue pride icons don't fit amongst the backdrop of dark murders and flashlight teabagging.
---
You just contradict yourself. No need to explain further
---
This is far too much work in the devs eyes, I really like this idea but it isnt something they would focus on. They have bugs to fix, dlc to drop and an angry community that never seems to be happy, they wont have the time to do something like this which is a shame
---
I don't even get why people complain about tunneling/camping. Yes it's annoying for the person getting tunnels/camped but it's not a viable tactic, because if they don't try to be altruistic, the killer is just wasting a fuckton of time and pressure on a singular person
---
[deleted]
---
I‚Äôm suggesting nothing because Nurse‚Äôs lore suggests nothing about her outfit. I‚Äôm literally just using canon, and you‚Äôre assuming that canon supports your claim. Until there is any canon or official lore that confirms Nurse somehow survived the the ambulance crash, escaped, found a rope, hung herself, and then was taken by the entity you can‚Äôt definitively say ‚ÄúNurse died‚Äù. You‚Äôre literally adding to lore with your own interpretation which is fine, but it‚Äôs not canon.
---
Legion has a power that doesn't actually down anyone.  It at best slows the game but that's all.
---
I can't wait for his buff
---
As cool as it would be to have that joker in dbd I just don‚Äôt think his character fits. I think a different version of joker would be better suited it just doesn‚Äôt seem like Arthur fleck would kill innocent people he really just seems like he wants to punish the bourgeoisie and the people who don‚Äôt care about him. He is very much a for the weak kinda person. I think a more classic version of the joker or the joker from the Arkham games would be best suited for dbd.
---
I mean, I know he‚Äôs more a skin for an in game character, but BHVR has a Terminator license, we should definitely have it in DBD! They may as well use it now that DeathGarden is sadly no longer with us :(
---
I‚Äôd play that fighting game.

What's wrong with that? Then let's get rid of every cosmetics that show skin, like David. Any cosmetics from Christmas events and Chinese lunar events, any charms related to specific characters and I can keep going with the list
---
You just don't like it for some internal bias which makes it very sad. It's just a charm, why would bother you? Unless...
---
Why do players like Nea do that
---
He's actually right in this instance though.
---
Killers need to be balanced around both 1v4 (How well the Killer can handle every survivor in the match at the same time), and be balanced around 1v1 (How much fun the Killer is to go against for the Survivors). Spirit, Nurse, and now Oni are the best at 1v4, but are too overbearing for 1v1. Pig is great at 1v4 since the traps can keep Survivors busy, but fails pretty hard at 1v1. Pre-rework Legion was stupid strong 1v1, but failed hard 1v4.
---
The Survivors need to have fun 1v1 (or 1v2), but the Killer needs to be able to handle the entire group of Survivors (hence why Ruin is such a good perk, it's map wide and it keeps the others slowed down while you chase the one). Both are absolutely required to keep both sides happy and have an actual balance in the game.
---
Personally, I blame Gen speed. Killers aren't granted enough breathing room to be balanced to give Survivors a chance if 3/5's of the objective can pop in the first minute and a half.

god damn
---
Ikr, funny thing is they are totally fine with David having shirtless cosmetics or any cosmetics that isn't even close related to the lore. Like Christmas or Chinese New year
---
Those people are laughable tbh
---
Ohh thanks
---
I think there is far to much going on with his power for them to do anything like that , the appearance of two other entities aswell as the kill seems a bit much for the coding . All in all an interesting killer just need changes to his power
---
Tomaeto Tomaato
---
You do realize slugging doesn‚Äôt work when the survivors has no mither since they can pick themselves up again?
---
*THANK YOU*
---
I tend do down the ones that get unhooked bur dont hook them again. Like idc if i lose the chance for a merciless but whenever i play suev and that happens to me or my friends it downright sucks to get prohibitted from playing
---
They lied.
---
Are you okay or you just wanna be dramatic like a school girl in a Justin Bieber concert for just a charm?.. wow..
---
lovely designs!!
---
not all of us have the attention span of a 2 year old
---
You mean the homophobic movement? Like white pride which is a very racist one? No thanks. I'd rather accept others than be an actual bigot
---
Dashing forward is literally a mechanic for everybody.
---
What the point of belt if you already have suspenders? Talking about Trapper.
---
I'm new, so i haven't talked to a lot of people, but almost every killer I've talked to has said they won't facecamp or tunnel until the survivors start bming(teabagging for an exampme), so once again the root of your issue is with survivor mains not the killer
---
Oh... when half of the gens get done while he is chasing me does not say that he should move to a next one? No map preassure at all. Does this mean I need to join sfw and be as toxic as possable?
---
You put rank 20 so now I‚Äôm wondering what your rank is lmfaoooo
---
Everybody gangsta till legion pulls out *Nemesis perk*
---
Legit just thought Hag was a R64 Freddy for a sec.
---
I do feel the backstories (excluding chronicles) got better as they went on, with the exception of spirit. Haven‚Äôt read Oni‚Äôs, but I guess it‚Äôs also just a gore story like spirit‚Äôs was.
---
Fuck your Ruin.
---
It's just a charm...
---
Then let's remove everything about Christmas and other events like Chinese New year since nobody cares about what you believe in
---
Just delete everything that's not just horror related
---
Why even bother to comment?
---
No, It‚Äôs not an internal bias, I don‚Äôt like people dragging things with real-world tension into a video game for absolutely no reason. DBD has nothing to do with sexual pride.
---
I‚Äôm gay, for the record. Fuck off trying to dismiss others‚Äô opinions by writing them off as bias.
---
I don't mean lunge.
---
I played a lot of trapper in red ranks and the only viable strategy for him right now is setting smart 3 gen traps and sticking to them, preferably around the basement, dont go for long chases because its just not worth it, trapper is also heavily map dependant, i would say go for hag right now, she is much better then trapper and greatly rewarding
---
Ok flaming kitty 2.0

* Having an unintentional or passing resemblance to Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; news articles that mention Dead by Daylight in passing, ‚Ä¶).

Yeah but I prefer Otz and this post is about Otz, no need to leak your fandom.
---
Do you ever just spend quality time with your father to flex on Vigil?
---
She's got a key. Maybe he wanted the better lunge to ensure getting rid of her.
---
Found the tumblr snowflake
---
I play Cod, battlefield, fortnite, and have never had these problems with butt hurt players messaging crazy shit to me. It‚Äôs just funny.  Why is it they call you a camper for trying to guard your victim once you hook them?  I run around and look for others but when I hear whisper, I‚Äôm not going to run out of my victims range knowing someone is about to free him/her. How stupid would that be?  I‚Äôm in it to win it, so if I want to sit my ass right in front of you that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do. Pitch my tent and laugh as I know your crying about me watching you die lol
---
u/Kevmaaan I had a lot of good games before that so I was too confident. Losing wasn't a slap to the face it was more how they were acting towards me and going out of their way to not do the objective.
---
Good luck when the patch drops and you will start getting progressively longer queues
---
Glad to see Legion is getting sweaters. Devs would have screwed up not giving them any tbh.
---
2nd power is bullshit
---
But by your your own logic you want more skillchecks the more people are on your gen. Your forgetting a lot of people hit greats a decent amount of the time, with that boost to gen completion it would end up making it harder for a killer not easier. Up in higher ranks people ignore ruin because they can land greats 90% of the time.
---
I just said she is counterable and Scott is full of shit, and i also agree with the changes
---
Dude it's alright all the hooks are sabotaged.
---
The ideas are there, the execution of it is just poor. They need to have better writers making the lore sections, because as it stands it's more painful to read than what it's worth. I love the story behind this stuff, I just wish it was fleshed out in a better way
---
Twitch is a Clown Fiesta.
---
Thing is, I absolutely LOVE playing double engravings billy and getting flicks, and he‚Äôs also a very strong killer so it‚Äôs a win-win.
---
When I get farmed, it's right back on the hook for me. Killer ignores the other survivor who farmed me, downs me, and then I'm on to my next hook stage. And then it happens again and I'm dead. I blame everyone in that exchange for letting that happen.
---
Or they just mori me sometimes. Makes my death quicker so whatever.
---
[All three of the other survivors barely obscured by debris, waiting to hook-bomb]
---
‚ÄúOMg Stop CAmpiNg!!!‚Äù
---
Because his idea of balanced is to suit him. The community thinks they know best but if the devs implement most of what the community says the game dies
---
Survivors are mostly shitty people, relax and just try again
---
Coming from someone that plays killer most of the time I get what you mean, but if someone is skilled enough to hit skill checks that progressively get hard then I think the reward of faster completion is justified
---
He's right and there's nothing we can do about it.
---
Holy crap, that billy skin looks good.
---
Also, since the black friday sale is coming up I'm planning to get Ash for 250 cells and then buy his sweater for 250 cells.
---
I definitely agree with you that billy is better
---
I agree with that. I don‚Äôt know why this same type of post gets regurgitated every couple of weeks on here. Going after the unhooked is a bad idea most of the time because he likely has Borrowed Time plus DS, especially at higher ranks. The guy farming is literally offering you a free hit or even a free hook sometimes. 
---
At lower ranks sure you might capitalize on this. At higher ranks you‚Äôre pretty much shooting yourself in the foot.
---
Doctor making the survivors rage quit is the best.
---
Not needed, because then the game will become even more unbalanced, no teachables need extra buffs. Plus it will make it so you only start seeing certain survivors and it will quite honestly just break the survivor side of the game and make it boring.
---
Skemooo! Tell me. Do you fix bone rotations on characters when you work with them?
---
I made a post a while back of him being in the game with perks n stuff I love the idea
---
I never d/c on purpose. But I know for me the game crashes a lot.
---
Eat her face. Do it, and you will be honoured as a god among the survivors.
---
Or name it ‚ÄúPsycho Break‚Äù, which is the Japanese title for the game.
---
It's mostly a nerf
---
Killers that are listed as "Hard" tend to rely heavily on addons, Starting as a new nurse is suicidal
---
They're not worth tunneling, a mori is more amusing
---
is this ironic
---
Oh god I feel the pain, I got disconnected 14 times last night.
---
i'm kinda triggered about it because i started playing like a week after the legacy stuff was dropped for players. D:
---
Nothing wrong with tunneling
---
Sadly you're right. BHVR would never do anything like this because of how many perks you would have to change
---
Devotion increasing your Bloodpoint cap is an interesting idea, but your rank increasing how much BP you get seems backwards and not very well thought out.
---
Lower ranks need more BP since they (probably) have a lot less unlocked and less play time in the game. They're the ones that need more BP to unlock teachables, or level up characters for higher ranks of perks.
---
*this game is whack*. Love it
---
All the time. Father's Day is the GOAT.
---
Try enjoying it. Consider it balance for the shit 5 minute games when you get tunneled or people dc.
---
Why's that?
---
i've only played against nurse once since the rework thing. I came across one yesterday with the ultra rare 1 blink addon with + 4.2m/s bonus to movement speed and it was hilarious. it's a horrible addon
---
New chase themes no other killer has, multiple animations better moris... whatever keeps you dense I guess
---
Hey, you inspired me to fool around with it a little bit and I've just found out you can disable the Plague shining stuff with ctrl+G and change lighting with ctrl+L in case you wanna try it.
---
Of course they want money but I think the DLC usually has a lot of effort put into it for the most part.
---
I love this game to death and I love BHVR. But this is dangerous talk in this sub.
---
I always trap the gates at the beginning of the game when playing Trapper. Nobody expects them there.
---
Also open some chests. I love getting a free item in those games too.
---
That's neat.
---
That's what you get for tapping.
---
What would be boring about healing really fast as a Claudette or being super quiet on gens as Min?
---
The new meta is No Mither, Self Care, Solidarity, and Lucky Break.
---
Agreed but doing it under the pretext "they are usually toxic"  is absurdly dumb, by that logic he too is usually toxic. Tunnel selectively based off playstyle or just play that way, singling people out cause of something you "think" they might do is very small minded imo, but it's a game play however you want I guess.
---
His sabo perk seems a little op to me i  my opinion. Mabye after a time of 60/80/120 seconds before it works imo
---
If you did all the gens yourself, that takes less than 7 minutes, assuming you don't miss a skill check. Add in some time for running between gens and opening the gate, maybe 9 minutes. A normal game where you escape can easily take longer than this unless your team is very efficient or the killer is outmatched.
---
Speaking of ash can we get pablo hes like one of my favorite characters (I havent made it through the all the episodes yet so idk if hes done something bad)
---
I remember when I faced this rank 20 nurse who I was pallet looping and started catching up to her lmao
---
this is!! thank you, i‚Äôm also working on ideas for a Krampus killer, but i figured I‚Äôd try and figure out how good I am at this before tackling that...
---
&gt;Having that kind of disconnect from reality is a bit much even for DBD.
---
Hatchets to the face, getting hit by the chainsaw, walking away after being stuck in the bear trap is not?
---
Like it could be really a really hard gun to aim with and the killer would be much slower than others for example.
---
Woo chinchillas are cool.
---
First of thats stupid and unfair for killers, literally like having 5 perks. Boring in terms of there will be a meta survivor to play and everyone will be playing her/him. Surely you have a favourite survivor that you like to play, imagine if they had a shit buff. Bad idea
---
Yeah you Play killer most of the time and want faster gen progression
---
Get out of here you cheeky cunt
---
Ive ran no mither several times against Oni and you still leave blood orbs. So in a way Oni counters no mither
---
I hope flip flop becomes available in the shrine soon. I want to try running that build for a long time.
---
Yep. ‚ÄúKick the survivor coming for the unsafe unhook‚Äù mechanic can‚Äôt come soon enough
---
Downing the unhooked survivor straight off IS tunneling. Change my mind.
---
It's me, I'm someone
---
Watch "funGoose" stream on twitch , best education for dbd I experienced, he's also answering the questions ppl ask him
---
I think he could have been referring to legions rework that will eventually happen
---
I worked on a concept quite a while ago of him having an inverted Terror Radius and no Red Stain.
---
Basically, after he first enters a chase everyone outside of a certain meter range of him hears eerie music and are effected as if you were in the Terror Radius. However when you're close to him you hear nothing unless you're in chase.     
---
Perks increasing Terror Radius would increase his silent zone and perks decreasing Terror Radius would decrease his zone of silence.
---
Until he enters that first chase he has no Terror Radius at all, so that he doesn't immediately reveal his identity like some Killers do.
---
It'd make him an unconventional Stealth Killer and give him unique perk synergies.
---
He'd also be able to Blind Survivors who look at him to long or too directly (think how flashlights work on Killers) and tamper with chests to remove the item inside and replace it with a human heart.
---
So it‚Äôs not a complete hard counter to oni. Good to know. Plus I doubt even as incompetent as they are, the dbd devs wouldn‚Äôt do that.
---
Agreed! I think that the first Terminator film is a super tense thriller movie with an intimidating villain that would fit nicely into DBD‚Äôs arsenal of killers - but like you said, it‚Äôs probably a pipe dream.
---
Well nobody said killer perks couldn't be buffed for their owners
---
Also, in the post I said with proper balancing and all that that entitles
---
I was attempting to do this challenge the other nice. Had one in the basement and ended up getting three trapped, all of them in the basement. I trapped all the exits and picked one up and dropped them until they could run. Got em.
---
Me and my Bing Bong Boi
---
Not only trespassing, but they're going through all of his lockers and chests to steal things, knocking over everything they can, and messing with his machinery.
---
I love my boi the wraith. I love the doctor, too. It‚Äôs too easy when i play billy, and because of this i always seem to go back to wraith and doctor.
---
You look a little confused but you've got the Spirit :)
---
And that you have to chase across the map after you unhook him (with fucking we‚Äôll make it) because he wants to heal in a corner and will use self care with sloppy and thanatophobia like nothing
---
I mean even if no blood orbs dropped its not like no mither would all of a sudden see this surge in popularity. 
---
Sure you could get a 4 man no mither lobby and that would make Oni powerless but you‚Äôre against a 4 man no mither lobby...
---
So the game is no where near balanced atm and hasnt been for 3 years, so you think we need to add extra values to help fuck it up.Killer perks being buff wont change a thing, just makes some killers even stronger,Enduring would be 90% reduced stun? Nurses calling takes up 48-60m? Agitation would be faster than normal speed. It does work as an idea.
---
So are killers that decide for no reason "fuck this survivor" and remove any sort of enjoyment from the match by tunnelling them :D
---
Fair I geuss but you brought in Noob3 so I thought I could give my opinion on Noob3 my bad.
---
As adorable as this is, he legit went on a killing spree because someone called him an Oni lol
---
do i hve to install the game to get these?
---
Huntress is one of the stronger killers though...
---
BNP used to fully complete a gen on use. Meaning literally right at the start of a match, 4 gens could all be done at the same time within 2 seconds
---
As a Killer: I hate when someone unhook right next to me. I try to hunt down the unhooker, but sometimes I slug the unhooked. I only hook him right again, if he was annoying to me.
---
As a Survivor: I hate it when someone unhooks me and the Killer is hooking me again. Yes it's my teammates fault, but why punishing me and not down him? As a Survivor it's not tunnel, but it's something very similar.. kinda more worse than being tunneled
---
She is not the level of Billy, nurse or spirit, besides what part of ADDONLESS have you not understood?
---
Story? what's that? you can eat those?
---
Your brain is so tiny
---
True, but most killers I play against don't even tunnel, neither do I. But ds locker has no counterlay to it.
---
Huh, thanks for the info. Guess my rep must just be real busy.
---
Not even gonna respond
---
I mean your getting to a rank where you actually are playing half decent survivors. Im not sure what build you have or what you are struggling with? Is it finding people or chasing or what?
---
Oh, thanks a lot!
---
Love the ideia! 
---
My only two issues are that Myers power is also called the evil within, and that the keeper teleport ability is very similiar to the demogorgon
---
Okay bud you need to chill out, it was just a suggestion. It doesn't need to be a buff that big either, nurse's calling gets an extra 3 meters or something enduring an extra 5% it doesn't need to be anything crazy
---
Almost as predicted. I guess the next one is Freddy, I thought was gonna be between GF and Freddy leaning more towards GF. My bad I guess
---
Its unnecessary buffs.
---
I think he said that because it's a bit complicated and it kind of works like a perk. I think I have an idea how to make it more interesting:                           Power: The Evil Inside (an extremely original name, I know):  After a survivor is unhooked the power becomes active for 45 seconds, while the power is active all bloodstains stay on ground for much longer,  press the secondary power button to transform a bloodstain into a portal, when a survivor steps on it Laura will catch them for 5 revealing their location and injuring them... shit, I think I made it more complicated
---
Why would anyone spend $500 on a recolor of her default outfit. 
---
This feels different though, they made the game free for everyone so that people could try it before the game is shut down.
---
The cosmetics feels like an unintended side effect to me personally.
---
I mean i dunno what to say, your learning a killer, your gonna have a tricky time and not get any kills. Id be happy i had more time to practice.
---
What part of she's very strong have you not understood? She's top tier and doesn't rely on add-ons. It's not hard to do well with her.
---
If you want some clown tips, I can offer advice! How do you play him?
---
I agree completely.
---
You have to remember not everyone uses that trash app Facebook
---
Wow, that plague. &lt;3
---
I was wondering about this earlier. I watch Otz a ton, and see him run into pallets all the time, when there was definitely no way for him to get a hit in. So is the stun + break time worth it usually? I tend to back up so I don‚Äôt get stunned.
---
You need to be on the gen when the gen pops. You can do 99% of the gen, someone else finishes it and it won't count. The reverse is also true. If someone else does 99% of a gen and you finish it (even though you haven't worked on it at all), it will count.
---
Only if the old Freddy would still be in the game. Little burnt sausage man.
---
Don‚Äôt think it does anything.
---
From what I've heard it takes the position of one of the survivors. So 4 killers equals 1 survivor and this image seems to support that information as well.
---
If your respecting pallets thats your whole problem right there lol
---
Is it a bug if the killer DCs and I don‚Äôt get my bloodpoints? Or is that the way the game works? I‚Äôm on ps4, just curious
---
Oh, sorry about that.
---
You did not listen then.
---
He said the only counterplay is a guess and varying your reactions. That is counterplay in the strictest sense, but it is not good. You don‚Äôt have the feedback to react. It negates learned skill in evading killers as you are only guessing at what they are doing. Sure, and experienced player can make better guesses and get away from a newer Spirit. However, there is no counterPLAY, meaning interaction where your skill is tested against theirs. It is a guess. Guess wrong and get hit. That is not what people want in a PvP game.

It's weird cause I dont understand the people that try super hard against someone that's new. If I run into baby killers, I try to at least make the match a little fun. I'll take some free hits, maybe run a few loops, make an extra ballsy save. I want to give people chances to learn and earn some points, especially since if survivor destroys the killer and escapes right away you dont get a ton of points either.
---
u/alexior41100 I play both survivor and killer, and it pisses me off when I see my teammates be an asshole to someone. Especially if it's a baby killer.
---
It is pointless in ist's current form because all it does is punish you.
---
that would make more sense. i didn't catch that
---
Thank you so much, literally happened the next game after posting. They should really make it more clear
---
What makes me an asshole? I am saying his ability is like Hag's and it is true. Are you blind? What is the difference? Lower number of traps? Timer? Different range? Different teleporting animation? Different way of working? Those are just details. Concept is still the same.
---
i always find the characters that remove their terror radius way more fun to play against than the normal killers. I don‚Äôt use spine chill so it‚Äôs always way more fun always being aware and sacred of a killer coming
---
&gt;unsportsmanlike conduct 
---
What exactly are you considering as unsportsmanlike? Anyway i dont think reports do anything unless you also submit a ticket with video/picture evidence
---
Dumb question but are you using dark sense?
---
Thanks a ton, they should really fix the wording
---
Waking up is not an escape.
---
Your opinion is stupid hence all the downvotes. Considering that he teleports to his safe and only has 5 as where Hags traps have to be triggered and can be removed by a flashlight. Freddy can teleport to gens so I guess he has hags power too , The concept is nice the perks too and doctor is shit unique sure but he's trash tier.
---
u/KorsiBear I feel like they do it to boost their self esteem.
---
Oh, I didn't notice that all survivors need to be alive. My bad! Still a very good concept!
---
Likely?
---
lmao, yeah. I think I just misinterpreted the challenge
---
I had a game with 4 Petrified Oak offering and 2 no mither with toolboxes jumping in and out of lockers in the corner of the Thompson house map killer shack which is super annoying with the explosion sound. The basement was in the house but i killed the other, 2 slug both of them and wait for the hooks to respawn. Fun for them i guess but not for me

Imagine 6 second DS Laurie
---
Or, as I was proposing, buff when survivors are together via perks, objectives, or other interactions WITH the killer (not just holding M1 on a gen). Get survivors off of gens and working together in a chase. 
---
That makes survivors stronger together and changes the dynamic. It also makes things more interactive and fun for all sides. THEN you can reduce map size and the number of safe loops because there are other ways of survivors combatting the killer together. Right now, they have pallets and loops and delaying the killer while other people hold M1 on a gen.
---
Rush gens, open the gate
---
Yeah and if you were healthy when you got grabbed and were hooked, you would stay healthy when you got unhooked
---
While in a chase break the Pallet as soon as they drop it. Most chases will be shorter, or you will destroy them and they are out a pallet. A build for Freddy could be fire-up, sloppy butcher, (or whispers), remember me, NOED. (Without other killer teachables.) with teachables you can run ruin, enduring, spirit fury, whispers. Dream snares should be placed around pallet loops, jungle gyms, and tall grass.

This happened to me on the switch before playing as a survivor. 3 of us faced off against a Ghostface and Myers. Needless to say there were plenty of holes in us

I seriously think that you can't even read what you've been saying. You're being an asshole by insulting this guy's work. I can think this concept is boring and not be an asshole about it. You just are though
---
Yeah I can see your point
---
Clown is fun. Not super good but fun.
---
Oh absolutely. I'm in the camp of a full rework to be honest. They are easily in the bottom 3 killers for sure.
---
YES. I'm not just going to go away or not look around the area when I just saw scratch marks on the ground and can HEAR people running around.
---
Cool, but they survivors never leave, they get thrown into a pile with other used survivors, and if so that would be years to come
---
u/Dead_Bear_King He -can- be fun but most of the time he's super boring to me..

Me with Clown. I love that damn maniac but goddang is he weak.

Yeah dude, just take the free bp and move on. As far as dbd problems go, this is at the bottom of the pile.

I was going to draw a realistic wraith but im watching my baby sister today and she didn‚Äôt want me to draw something that was too spooky. I‚Äôm not great at cartoon-styled art and some of the details aren‚Äôt the greatest or most accurate, but I tried!

lol flash light clicking yes blinding at pallets how is that toxic that's how u escape and part of the game smh

Spirit fury with enduring is pretty insane. When you are chasing someone with your power, if you can get them to proc spirit fury right after you hit them you can almost insta down them. If you have nurses calling use that too. Their best perks are thatnat, sloppy boogers nurses, discordance, enduring, bbq is always good. I will sometimes take franklins but with how they are reworking how the power interacts with m1 perks im not sure how this will work. Ruin is always good, especially if you are new to a killer
---
I've never seen him so happy.
---
People in this game are going to complain and point fingers at everyone other than themselves no matter what. I guess what I'm trying to say is, if a guy is going to farm his hooked teammate, I'm going for the unhooker. I save myself the risk of Decisive and Borrowed Time and I apply more pressure.
---
You know, I feel like I understand why this community is the way it is now...
---
I automatically love it. Mr.bingbong is my favorite
---
That sandbad tho lmao.
---
That's so random, I too encountered a depipping wraith, but he was just cloaked in the corner of Haddonfield while we finished all the gens
---
Perks like Breakout encourage two survivors to interact at the same time with a killer. It makes them stronger together. Making survivors objectives and strategies more team based would turn the game into a 1v4 for everyone and not just for killers. 
---
Bond and kindred should be base (along with BBQ and WGLF points). However, we need more perks that encourage teamwork when NOT holding M1 on a gen. Breakout is really the first of its kind. 
---
How about a perk where if two survivors are in a chase with a killer within a certain distance from each other, they get a speed boost or it charges the perk with tokens based on the time in the chase.
---
The overall story, sure. But that whole "rock" thing was overdone.
---
1 meter longer lunge aint a reason to complain about dashes
---
I had to make him happy or else my little sister would‚Äôve legitimately cried lmao
---
What did the hud look like?
---
God I would kill for a rework, man. Just hoping it doesn't take as long as Freddy's took. I honestly think a full rework is all that could ever really fix them without breaking them one way or the other.
---
Wait, like, the actual basement? 
---
Not just Freddy's bedroom?
---
Thx
---
I personally use Sloppy butcher, third seal, discordance and spirit fury
---
BBQ is only useful if you are hooking survivors, and Whispers is only useful if you know how it works and are paying attention to it. I would run Ruin if you‚Äôre having trouble with the gens going too fast (As it won‚Äôt be cleansed so quickly at that rank) and focus more on protecting gens  in general. If you don‚Äôt down or land a hit on someone in a short amount of time you need to break chase and just let them go and keep an eye on the generators you can and will down someone else. Get used to the distance and timing of using lunge attacks mid-chase, practice simple mind games like doubling back on a loop when line of sight is broken, vaulting a window while looping a shack etc. Don‚Äôt camp hooks, don‚Äôt camp anything, break every pallet you see thrown etc and in time you‚Äôll get better and better at all of it.
---
Protection bits are becoming more consistent and able to be gotten every 3 seconds when we get the next update.
---
Surveillance will let you know when a gen you hit has started to be worked on again, so you can tell what they're up to.
---
Yeah I've gotten more messages from survivors as well, insulting me for the pettiest stuff sometimes. A guy blamed me for tunneling though he walked right towards me. Every once in a while I do get one or two from killers though. Just yesterday a Myers told me I was toxic b/c I was looping. I don't know, DBD is just this rich salt mine that never runs out.
---
About the unsafe unhook, well I tend to go for the unhooker. I can understand people tunneling though, especially if they're trying to get rid of the weakest links, but at red ranks it's not really viable in my experience.
---
Yes, swing through them. Sometimes you get a hit. 
---
Run enduring if that is your trouble point. It basically negates the stun. 
---
I would also recommend trying to hide your red stain. You do that by walking backwards around jungle gym walls. Survivors can see that light and know which way you are coming around a corner. Try running Beast of Prey if you think it may be the red stain giving you away. If that help a lot, then you will need to practice mind gaming as killer (using your red stain to fake people out). 
---
Also, try using killers that slow loops like Hag, clown, or Freddy. You can set a trap on one side, then rotate the chase the other way by running around the other side on the loop so they get the slowdown for longer before a pallet.
---
Bro, it's casual mockery of straight hypocrisy. If snideness required having hysterics, that reply would land you in the crybaby zone right beside me.
---
No matter who you play, don't forget to bring the meta perks and purple addons! :)))
---
Closest thing I could get from Translate was paperas, mumps in Indonesian
---
Or eat her ass. Either way, it's a win-win.
---
Breaking the pallet is not always the play. If you see the survivor leaving the pallet, you don't need to kick it (unless it's a really safe pallet and will just cause too much of a headache later on). Also if the pallet is really unsafe you don't need to kick it.
---
love to get accused of camping because i turned around and saw your scratchmarks before i even had a chance to leave

---
Well darn
---
I get it, but it should not affect me
---
Where are you setting your traps? Try to hide them in grass of course, and put them around a loop, not directly under a window or pallet if you can help it. Part of the problem also is that trapper's pretty weak, so you're not gonna perform as well as other killers.
---
Your comment seems to imply that you don‚Äôt know that survivors get a progression penalty when there‚Äôs more than 1 survivor on 1 gen.
---

---
I did restart and it got fixed
---
then I guess I agree with your view of dcing as it wouldn't hurt your teammates
---
Something that's a little harder to quantify, but you have to put yourself in their head a bit. One of my favorite things to do when playing killer is to trick a survivor into thinking I'm oblivious or I didn't see them. Early on in the game, if I see someone crouched behind a rock near a pallet, I won't immediately face them and beeline into their pallet stun. Instead I'll continue walking forward as if I haven't seen them, but as soon as I touch the rock I lunge swing and flick into them. A huge chunk of the time it will catch them off guard and boom, you've started your chase with one hit instead of a pallet stun and them running.
---
Little things like that help you snowball. An injured survivor feels pressured to heal at those ranks instead of run straight to a gen and keep working, so when you see a group of them don't just focus on one and take him down - hit one, turn, hit another. More injured survivors is more pressure.
---
I had this error, too until a few weeks ago. (It startet a patch before Ghostface if I remember it right.) But I am honest I don't know when but it got fixed for me a few patches ago.
---
I have surveillance cheers
---
I like the new changes, but would like to see faster perk progression for more gameplay variations. 
---
Also, they really need to change the Rift Tier 4 challenges that are ‚Äúin a single match‚Äù. Most of those will be VERY frustrating as it is luck to get some of them. 
---
For example, as killer, ‚Äúhook 3 people with NOED after the end game collapse‚Äù. That means you basically need to throw the game and keep people alive, hope they don‚Äôt open the gates and more than one person just leaves (especially if they see you have NOED), down someone prior to anyone leaving, use bloodwarden to trap people, hope they don‚Äôt find NOED while Blood warden is active, and hope no one finds the hatch if a hooked person DC‚Äôs. 
---
Even worse is the survivor side of ‚Äúunhook 3 people during the end game collapse‚Äù. That is in one game. How many games does that realistically occur where 3 people get hooked after the gates are powered AND you are the one unhooking them. 
---
I want the game to stay around for a while. I like the path they are going, but they still have work to do.

Let‚Äôs be honest, the whole game Is just a generator simulator
---
I play both killer and survivor killer when I am alone and survivor with my friends I get the whole swf hate but honestly I want to talk with my friends and play the game I enjoy dbd and it's fun playing together but we don't try hard or tbag and waste time half the time we just playing for fun not competitiveness. Even as killer like solo survivors can be just as toxic with the tbagging exit gate waiting I actually have more fun trying to kill swf with comms then bunch of solos that don't even rescue and let a guy die on their first hook.
---
Because I'm a (solo) survivor main. And I know how it feels to play with literal orangutans who farm you off the hook for no good reason and end up basically killing you. If at all possible, I want to prevent screwing someone over for not doing anything wrong and having some bonobo get away with his bad (as in bad for his team) plays. Yeah it might just be a game and a team-based one at that but you gotta remember that there's also someone at the other end of the screen.

These are all shit except wraith

There's probably gonna be a Winter event mid-December, no idea what it would entail though. Probably just extra bloodpoints.

---
Yeah I allow survivors to farm sometimes as a killer. Mostly because I know how crappy it can be as a survivor sometimes. At times you just need a break for the game, can get really frustrating. Plus I doubt it happens all that often so don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that much of an issue.

On the ptb they could basically do what BHVR removed a while back. Originally, you could use Feral Frenzy to give deep wounds to a survivor, and as long you weren't in a chase with them, the deep wounds meter would deplete and they'd go down. This meant that people could simply apply deep wounds, look down and away, and follow the blood trails / scratch marks as the meter depleted. If the survivor stopped to try to mend, it was a free hit. If they didn't, they would go down. BHVR fixed this by making it so that the meter doesn't go down if the survivor is in their terror radius. Now then, onto the ptb.
---
 From what I understand, the new Oni perk, Nemesis, effectively removes your terror radius for a survivor when they stun or blind you. This caused deep wounds to deplete the meter even if the survivor was technically in your terror radius. 
---
 As of right now, due to BHVR "fixing" Legion, they are arguably the weakest killer. Their power can't be used to really down anyone, and the deep wounds status can be mended way quicker than ever. The only thing that looks decent is the changes to add-ons. Used to be, using certain add-ons gave a status effect to a survivor if you hit them with Feral Frenzy while they were already suffering from deep wounds. Now it's applied to a survivor you hit that is marked by the effect that shows where they are when you apply deep wounds in Feral Frenzy. It's definitely not enough, but I'm hoping BHVR can figure out how to make Legion actually viable.

My advice is to think a little less about others i guess. As killer play to win (or what i do is always let everyone escape and just play killer to make points) and as survivor be the best team mate you can be.
---
Maybe set yourself some goals to achieve for fun.
---
Because it's technically a DbD "Original character."
---
They have licensing w FunWorld, the people who make the mask. They don't have licensing w the Scream movies.
---
I really wanted Sidney too üò≠
---
S someone who already did 5 survs, 1 killer in KYF i can tell how the HUD looks like: it looks like normal HUD, but theres just one more slot next to the survivor image saying if they are healthy or not.
---
PC players have no advantage on this game. It's not really an aim-based game, unless you're the killer maybe. There is no downside to console crossplay.
---
I suggest trying to get into more chases as a survivor.
---
This will teach you how to properly run a killer around while also making you aware of simple mistakes survivors can make that you can take advantage of as killer.
---
Wait, Brutal Killer!?
---
"THIS MY TERRITORY, BLUEBERRY"
---
Survivor in console*
---
Nobody steals Todds limelight at E3!
---
Console or PC?
---
I‚Äôd take 100 shards per colour rank
---
Dying on first hook so you never have to wake up anymore.
---
"I'll make myself look stupid so the silly killer gets offended"
---
~Toxic people, probably
---
As a killer you maybe need to look at what killer you are playing. Green ranks gets much harder and it‚Äôs where you start to develop real game sense and mechanical skills. Some killers will struggle, and not running meta perks can hurt. The long and short of it is that the game starts to become much more difficult and competitive and you will literally have to git gud. If you don‚Äôt find fun in that competition and gitting gud process its not going to be fun. You‚Äôre not always going to 4k, a 2k can be a good game. Focusing on improving certain aspects of your game and not worrying about ‚Äòwinning‚Äô whatever that means in this game will help. 
---
On the survivor side it is also a git gud situation. You need to learn how to loop better, how to not be seen, how to deal with perks like ruin, how to mindgame the killer. It‚Äôs where the game actually becomes interesting imo because yellow and grey ranks are such potato ranks the game doesn‚Äôt remotely play the same.
---
There‚Äôs many toxic builds to begin as a template.
---
Basic must have perks
---
1. BBQ
---
2. No-Ed, Bamboozle, or an anti-pallet
---
3. Whispers, Discordance, Surveillance
---
4. Ruin, Pop, or Corrupt Int
---
If they have items, sacrifice BBQ for Franklin‚Äôs. 
---
Whenever I see a SWF Group yeet into my lobby, I just whip out the Gat and clap them with psychological warfare. Why? Because the team that tilts first, loses.
---
 1. Pick perks that play on the altruism
---
Ex: Devour Hope, Dying light, and Make your choice
---
2. Always attempt to hit through pallets. Break it after unless you‚Äôre certain you can circle around
---
3. Don‚Äôt let a chase last longer than 30 seconds.
---
4. When hooking someone, spin in a circle (if your sensitivity is high enough) as you walk to the hook (The Kilker Equivalent to moon-walking)
---
5. Hit the hooked survivor as you walk away
---
6. If it comes to it and the survivors are t-bagging in the exit gate, hit as many as you can. Escaping while injured prevents them from getting Iridescent in Unbroken. 
---
7. Even if you lose, ‚ÄúMad cuz ur bad‚Äù if they message you. Make sure you reply to everything they say, with that message. Toxicity is a double edged sword
---
I spent literally months slowly making this concept, learning everything I could about Amanda's power and backstory to create the ultimate buff &amp; QOL ideas that will not only make all her add-ons useful, but will make the stealth aspect of her power up to par with other stealth Killers. I really, really, hope anyone who takes the time to read this enjoys it. And if anyone has any questions, I will definitely be able to answer them because all changes in this concept have a purpose.
---
please tell me it is
---
The doctor is always a good time no matter badly I lose.
---
I love when killers do this. That‚Äôs 2 stacks and 50% bonus blood points for me.
---
don‚Äôt forget that Oni can turn better than hillbilly even if billy has both of his turning add ons
---
One change especially was brutal to him: his feral frenzy attacks no longer count as normal hits. Legion used to be at least useable because of his synergy with Thanatophobia (slows all action progress like gens and healing based on how many people are hurt) and sloppy butcher (slows healing). Sloppy butcher was especially useful on him as after mending people would take quite a while to heal, whie Legion's power made it incredibly easy to injure people but hard to down them. Sloppy butcher made it so that healing after the injury was slow enough to make him a LOT better, but now unless the survivors are bunched up a lot it's gonna be WAY harder for him to slow down the game, meaning he's a ton weaker than he was overall, even if his feral frenzy speed and duration were buffed slightly.
---
Killer mains show mercy to often.
---
*surv drops item* = killer main lets them live
---
*surv last alive* = killer main gives them hatch
---
*surv wears default dwight outfit* = killer main goes easy on them
---
Killer mains for whatever reason are way to kind and this has lead to them being bullied a lot more because the survs know they can get away with it
---
I read that in tachanka's voice
---
So a doctor, Freddy, and trapper hybrid
---
Favorite? Ghost Face. Best with? Probably Doctor or Wraith. But I usually main Ghost Face, get myself up to green ranks, then throw a pip to let the survivors farm. Keeps the game fun imo
---
Yup, but that was the issue pre-collapse. 
---
Hatch won‚Äôt spawn, killer can‚Äôt close it, game goes forever because survivor won‚Äôt work gens.
---
You bet your sweet booty cheeks son.
---
Cant camp the hatch if no generators were finished, they just got lucky.
---
Am I the only one bothered that the address is on localhost? Does not seem legit, then again I'm a PS4 player, so...
---
Demigorgons rise up!  Only buy monster in game.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e0m49c/real_footage_of_me_chasing_a_good_survivor_with/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
They will be releasing the next 2 tomes one is coming out this week the next is coming out mid december, there will be a winter event with 2x BP event, sweaters and skins for characters, and a returning item to blind the killer.
---
As shitty as wrestling has been lately im pretty excited to see NXT at survivor series. Also this is pretty damn good.
---
You are a good man, thank you
---
OP killer
---
Guess they just got lucky then. Still sucks when they haven't done anything all game and still get to escape tho
---
It‚Äôs faster to do separate gens, but isn‚Äôt the key point of the game securing "important gens‚Äù? like the middle gen in azarov‚Äôs or lery‚Äôs. I guess that‚Äôs when survs repairing together really does damage.
---
Nah this is kyf on console. OP is just playing stupid for karma.
---
I don't think being nice encourages people to be toxic. Being an asshole encourages people to be toxic. While you say that letting them go lets them think they can get away with it, some survivors are actually grateful and will be less inclined to be douchey.
---
you‚Äôre welcome üòÇ
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs BS. But it had to be done because of all the toxic players. 
---
They would hide in a corner and move when the killer came by. Matches would go on for an extra 30 min until someone quit.
---
that idea is pretty bad taste lol. if they added a gun killer it would definitely have to be some kinda old timey musketman. a hunter with a rifle would also work but that might be too close conceptually to the huntress
---
M E A T B A L L M A N
---
Yes ignore the challenges until level 4 comes out and then you can do them all. Other than that not going to happen
---
Granted, but at the same time Oni has to find ‚Äúfuel‚Äù starting out. Further, he has to continue to fuel his ‚Äúchainsaw‚Äù the whole match.
---
Even if you lose, the best is when you put together your favorite cosmetics with a cool perk and see it all come together for even just ONE moment in a trial
---
Even as a pig main I don't agree that the first box you search should automatically not give you a key.
---
That would mean that they would have to make the boxes RNG based
---
I don‚Äôt even tunnel and mori TTVs because I think they‚Äôre toxic, I do it just because of the TTV. Idgaf about ‚Äútoxicity,‚Äù or what this community considers toxic anyway. I‚Äôm a league player, I‚Äôm not a snowflake that‚Äôll complain about spam crouching on a subreddit, I just think shamelessly self promoting is scummy as fuck and it makes the person a sellout. Become popular by getting good at the game, not by forcing your TTV username down everyone‚Äôs throats.
---
Yes, but The Oni has to earn his power. Imo, make it so that he has to hit 3 survivors, instead of 2, to get his power and tone down his turning a bit and he‚Äôll be balanced.
---
Appreciated. I love going against the Pig as a survivor and there aren't enough of them
---
I want a R6 and DBD crossover so bad even though it won‚Äôt ever happen.
---
Because rank matters even less now than before emblem update. 
---
Plus, BP isn‚Äôt an issue for people with maxed characters. I‚Äôve been dumping BP into multiple survivors because I‚Äôve got nothing better to do with it. Lol
---
Xbox One, Ingame. 
---
Escaping out the exit gates frequently makes me lose addons.
---
Escaping just before/at the endgame collapse runs out makes me lose entire items.
---
Who's the girl on the bottom right next to billy.
---
As a nurse main, I think she‚Äôs in a decent spot now. You actually need to be precise with blinks- unlike before, where you had infinite. However, most of her addons are now somewhat useless. You can run 2x charge speed addons to basically have old addon-less nurse, but the others just feel gimmicky and not worth using. I can still regularly 4K without any slowdown perks. (unless I get a corn map, because I‚Äôm cornblind.)
---
The spirit nerfs aren‚Äôt going to destroy her at all. All the nerfs are doing are offering survivors some extra forms of counterplay instead of having to guess all the time. Let‚Äôs be honest, you didn‚Äôt need a window fake or the OP addons to win a chase as spirit. Nor did you need the collision, as anyone with headphones can hear footsteps very easily. She still has some of the best chase potential and above average map pressure. Just like the nurse nerfs, these changes removed things that helped new players, and made little difference to more experienced players.
---
and thats that, Better control = more deadly but needs fuel. Less control = less deadly but no fuel. The gameplay is enough to give a reason to use either.
---
Man I remember when I got hit when I was vaulting a pallet... when he was on the other side of the pallet
---
These are my main games
---
No wonder TydeTyme loved it.
---
Too op
---
Love it.
---
That trapper could trap me any day of the week. &lt;3
---
Same lmao. I love that they both get updates around the same time.
---
Hey this is cinematic genius. So thanks
---
Terminator
---
The devs have put a lot of effort into the game and the dlc for years now.
---
If you don't think so, why are you even here?
---
While I don't specify this, they wouldn't need to make it RNG based to do this. The Survivor could search a Jigsaw Box with their key in it, and if it is their first Jigsaw Box search, then another Jigsaw Box would be selected to contain the key.
---
From the Survivors perspective, they wouldn't know it had contained a key.
---
OP has level 1-2 perks so it isn't kyf
---
Well... How? Give an example or two and I'll elaborate on why I decided to include it.
---
You ever heard the phrase "being a pushover"? Because that's what most killer mains are.
---
I don't like that. I must decide which update to play
---
She's giving you a tour!
---
I love the concept and I find it really interesting but I feel like that could potentially bug and leave the survivor with no boxes that have a key.
---
If they could make it work seamlessly then I would love it
---
That‚Äôs why I main wraith
---
Never respect pallets. During certain loops start mind gaming (moonwalking to hide killers red light). Learn when to chase and when not; there's always that 1 survivor who wants to be chased and ignores the objective. You're getting to the rank where you need to actually start thinking (at least a little bit) and not just mindlessly go through the motions.
---
It's funny to me. Last night there was a clannie 3 stack who just bumrushed basement hook and only worked on the gen right next to basement hook. Yea man just gonna ignore the 3 people I can hear with stridor on a no healing nurse build.
---
I think these are the buffs she needed. Not a big fan of skulking but everything else was really well done. Obviously, she wouldn't become a top tier killer but this would definitely make her better.
---
I bet you jack off to futa porn huh
---
Because weak doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they‚Äôre fun to play against.
---
Doctor, clown, and old Freddy are/were fairly weak killers but by most peoples opinions aren‚Äôt fun to play against. 
---
Legion is similar, he‚Äôs not very good but spending half the match mending and healing is quite boring.
---
I don't stack them and I still win
---
Because I'm a fool.
---
I actually like the staggered release, it really keeps me motivated to keep me coming back.
---
I do wish each level was bigger though.
---
I agree with that.. But I'll never kill a guy who just got farmed... I am not tryhard.. I will go after unhooker to teach him a lesson :)
---
Somewhat agree with both of the comments above me, but fact is some people just love to be toxic regardless of how others act. That won't ever change, those types of people find it to be hilarious.
---
And you cant even save yourself
---
It‚Äôs worth it a lot of the time because you‚Äôre taking away future safety in chases. Forcing them to drop strong pallets like the killer shack early means they can‚Äôt use it later when it really matters.
---
New killer: The Terminator.
---
I miss the lighting offerings. Shook the game up whenever some used them
---
Okay THAT was a mindgame. Super fun to watch
---
Man looks like an Uruk.
---
Concur. The lore is kinda dumb.
---
Loop this fucking casual.
---
Now you're speaking 'Murica!
---
They force you to accept them when they can't accept themselves, they blog about it being transphobic for not wanting to fuck them. They're just like any other group that forces you to accept their ideology or they label you a bigot. Sooooo I say "fuck them and fuck you"
---
TFW you play Spirit because you love Japanese horror, and your eyesight legit sucks and prefer the idea of using sound to echolocate but the community hates you for it. :(
---
Lol thread gets so serious
---
Yeah but there is no current punishment for being toxic.
---
At least as surv there isn't, toxic plays as killer will almost always guarantee that you dont pip meanwhile survs actually get rewarded for it
---
god i REALLY miss the old lighting...
---
Maybe the musket killer would be more focused to long ranges and such, with a hefty reload, and limited reloads.
---
Deathgarden was fun until they made scavenger easy as hell through multiple lives.
---
I agree farming matches are extremely annoying. But at least as a newer player try and make it a learning experience. Become more comfortable in the terror radius, practice great skill checks only, different camera angles etc. Again farming matches aren't fun but at least try to make them a positive for yourself.
---
Legion‚Äôs arguably worse than Bubba. Go for clown. Better perks.
---
Lets be real though, we all pretend it's Billy or Stu under there.
---
Demo is actually pretty strong, people just like to focus on hate for Spirit.
---
As a killer, maybe this is true, but as a survivor though?
---
Many people say that you're throwing and what not, and I'm like, people, I just want to play my underleveled Steve...
---
Like, I get where they are coming from, so I always use my powerful characters, altho it gets boring to always look at my 45 Nancy until I can get a good leveled Steve...
---
Me when everybody thought ghost face was low tier, then getting to red ranks
---
Plague
---
Usually it's just a nea who doesn't know how to use a flashlight
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Not really, as a survivor if the killer is standing around I'm happy, I'll just do gens.
---
Point being, these survivors jot.progressing the game CAN BE KILLED.
---
I love evil within. Great concept op.
---
Nah it's just a MW FaZe clan member with an intervention.
---
Let's you play clown for a match I believe
---
Nothing for my boy David?
---
Lets you play killer you dont own for free but without perks and add-ons. Smoking one is for Freddy i think?
---
Agreed.
---
Let's you play as freddy for free with no perks if you use the offering
---
All I see is evil within 3 üòé
---
how
---
I had this exact same idea lol
---
Pussies dced. He was just farming with them. What else is he supposed to do when farming. You're braindead.
---
I'll have one order of Big Tiddy Goth Plague, with a side order of Mafia Bunny, Attorney at Law, Herman Carter and Mortician Sally Smithson.
---
Based on this science lunge is op :(
---
Same man
---
Imagine being still salty when given hatch.
---
ttv bad
---
Just play how you want if you want to be toxic thats on you ruin somebodys fun its on you
---
Knowing they probably wont add this is sad but these honestly look sick.
---
Being able to start a following is scummy? The directory will keep you buried at the bottom because no one scrolls down to watch new/unknown streamers
---
arent there 6 gens too?
---
How do i end this loop? 
---
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1919331603 
---
It's the temple of purgation map. The gap between the tree and the low wall is small enough for survivors to slip through but not killers. They don't even have to drop the pallet to make this loop infinite. Couldn't even catch them with Bloodlust 3. I know i should've switched targets and i did, until they keep coming back to this place and the whole desperation starts again.
---
you have to just start the Deathgarden install and then cancel it to add it to your Steam library
---
Skulking is like free 10% movement speed and undetectable status basically meaning your a better ghostface and faster, plus with a 1 seeing cool down you can basically get free m1s when you uncrouch or even grabs and the ability practically has no cool down.
---
Your opponent is not responsible for your fun.
---
I'd like Stalker to be in. 
---
Regardless it'll probably be a challenge to balance if they have guns.
---
i got it thanks
---
Imagine youre getting chased by mspaint freddy while his theme plays in the background on kazoo
---
It's definitely noticeable, it'd be good with Mettle of Man.
---
Is it a good perk? Sure. Is it good enough universally to be meta? Probably not.
---
sorry
---
I dont think the playerbase is big enough to punish that lol. Just being real.
---
The bonus movement speed is equivalent to the speed bonus given the The Wraith while cloaked. 
---
And the 1 second transition time is the same as current The Pig when using Combat Straps (Live version) equipped.
---
Wait, theres such a person called depipping wraith? Because I had a game yesterday where the killer was nowhere to be found, so I just started actively searching it with my spine chill active. I never did find him. Probably was him.
---
Dedicated servers doing their work as intended I see.
---
Do not forget the fact of being able to call it oni-chan
---
Anything but prayer beads spirit or forever freddy Im happy to play as or against.  Those two shouldnt be in the game.
---
Nobody cares enough to give the killer a pair of glasses üòî
---
Well, whispers triggers from hook so that wouldn't be the one. But the others, yeah. I've had some groups get ballsy on diving the hook seconds after I hook.
---
While I do believe there is room for a killer with a gun, I don't think it should be anyone from DG. They have enough going on in their kits.
---
How did the rest of that match go?
---
Yes the basement. It happens on every map rn on mobile. It has a chance to spawn there. Bug probs
---
I am on ps4 and I‚Äôve had it happen once a doc and a Hag
---
Good strategy as it ties up one person healing the downed, while I keep another occupied in chase. At most, one is working a gen .
---
*looks back at his perks* literally said out loud "OMFG HE IS"
---
You know you don't need that perk for 0 terror radius anymore right?
---
Yeah, I knew it wouldn't be meta except with the meme SWFs but as long as it's not a waste of a slot, I'm down to try it.
---
Pretty cool, thank you!
---
I have no idea what this was but it definitely made me smile
---
Congratz! No probs!
---
i would actually trow big bucks for a plague skin like that. holyyy mollyyy
---
Imagine all the lobby dodging when survivors see someone who‚Äôs really low or compared to them though
---
Entity: Kill you say? Step into my orifice.
---
Shes just going back to her home, she needs rest aswell you know.
---
splinters are only for licenced characters, not original. Smoking is freddy
---
Yes, theres also 6 gens.
---
I remember this happening to me a while back, I was in a swf back when I had friends who played. I remember one of them being like holy shit it's Michael. But my other friend and I saw traps... In the end the game was so fucking laggy we all dc'd and were like wtf happened. The killer said he used the shard to change him to michael but couldn't even move, and was sad he wasted the shard lol
---
Unlikely if a rank 12 killer is going against 4 rank 6 survivors.
---
100% extra BP for playing the game not terrible lmao your insane.
---
So wraiths bell that makes no sound and 1 second in and out of cloak; and that‚Äôs just a 2nd ability lol. It could use some tweaking but I still like the ideas.
---
Pretty sure they're working on a fix for the ranks
---
They just need to change the hatch all the way like maybe your arua is reviled periodical and you have to survive like 1:30 before it opens and then shown to you so escaping through hatch is actually skillful
---
If someone unhooks the survivor I tend to put the injured survivor down and chase the other one so it stops the others from working gens. Plus I‚Äôm a firm user of deerstalker. Watching them slugs üêå
---
DCing to be awake next game.
---
I've seen enough /r/dbdgonewild to know where this is going.
---
So? Why should people be forced to play with survivors that aren't at their rank?
---
I don't want a random rank 18 fucking up my match.
---
For both things actually
---
"I don't mean lunge."
---
I've had people DC rather than take a hatch when I thoroughly smashed his team.  
---
In the post game chat, he said he wasn't going to take charity from an xsshole. I was like... okay.
---
Thicccc
---
Honestly, it could be cool having these two games crossover at some point. At least aside from the Meg and Trapper cosmetics.
---
Oh my god he‚Äôs so mad. Did he message you after?
---
It really is.
---
The writing is just bad in general. Definitely not professional level.
---
I‚Äôll stop running Ruin and BBQ as soon as survivors stop running DS and Adrenaline.
---
In like, a year
---
It also has strict prerequisites.
---
It's a placeholder.
---
Playing Legion is like seeing Devs giving 1 their mistake at cost of another bunch of nerfs.
---
Hover the curser over the icon....
---
What the shit lmao
---
Oh, really? So she is going to get a new voice?
---
They know that, it's a placeholder
---
That's why I play Ash
---
Oh please.... Gimme Brenda.
---
When the chapter comes onto the live servers, yes.
---
Ty!
---
what the hell is that actually chainsaw arm hillbilly
---
I suspect some of those people have never actually played killer at high ranks, just got a couple 4ks at rank 12 and went back to the safety of their swf team... when I use clown, I usually spam bottles on every gen and hooked survivor to some degree of success. He can be really mean on a 3 gen.
---
I figured it's because the Collector, or whatever his name is, is supposed to be this person who has studied the Fog and is pulling these memories from basically an Elder God's mind/body. Doing that has made him either insane, mentally unstable, too fidgety, or all 3 + more.
---
I actually like how he sounds, but I'm looking at it the way I just described.
---
This is the kind of content we need
---
Ok, that‚Äôs good, thanks for the clarification!
---
This is really cool and all but I think there isnt enough details to distinguish one killer from another
---
That lag tho
---
Right!?
---
Maybe it has. There are a few killer bios without exact dates aren‚Äôt there? Some killers could be from the near future
---
Oh okay. Thanks
---
I‚Äôm feeling a little woozy man!
---
I approve.
---
It's better than peer-to-peer with 9/10 killers purposefully sabotaging their own connection to get free hits.
---
that's actually a very good idea for devotion
---
But softairguns dont kill survivors?
---
That would be a great nod since the original studio seems to be from Japan with a quick google search.
---
The Middle School Art Collection
---
that's for the new balanced landing on the ptb I'm guessing mobile gets changes early
---
They also made a bunch of licensed Disney Channel games
---
There‚Äôs better ways to start a following. If you become one of the best players in the world and completely blow every game you play out of the water, people will be interested and search up your name. Hell, that‚Äôs what a lot of the popular did streamers now did. You don‚Äôt have to self promote
---
thx for info, had no clue.
---
The teleport is iconic to him, like butter and dinner rolls. His power could also be renamed to Psycho Break, the japanese name of the game.
---
Well you don't become almost completely invisible while Skulking and there's a sound to begining and ending Skulking.
---
Seriously? Deathgarden was so fun!
---
I am afraid, good sir, that you mistook this place of residence as a good target for robbery, but it turns out that this was actually a terrible choice. For, you see, I am very upset that you chose this particular habitation for your attempted crime, and shall now proceed to bludgeon your cranium with this heavy piece of wood. I must add, having put yourself in this tricky situation makes you quite the buffoon.
---
Deathgarden is closing its servers at the end of the year, so it's pretty much going to have to be some characters jumping over if it happens.
---
Well you'd be hella wrong
---
I've been seeing ranks for awhile on PS4 and I thought it was a feature. I want it to stay. Occasionally I dodge a lobby because there are 2 survivors at Rank 17 with low level characters (usually around rank reset). I don't see this as bad since I usually hang around purple and red ranks, so if a killer is close to my level, those guys will get crushed probably. 
---
Sometimes I don't dodge and just accept the game might be more potato then usual. 
---
It can also be a sign that the matchmaking is out of whack instead of waiting until you die to figure it out.
---
It's only active if all 4 are alive.
---
It makes it more fun to have a goal other than 'win'. Like it forces me to use builds I like but don't run because it won't necessarily help me win. So games actually feel fun! Lol ü§£
---
Entitled survivor. Wanting a team close to your skill level. Smh.
---
Using your favourite character even though everyone hates them and thinks they're for talentless players üòÇüòÇ
---
They must be minted by now with all the new players
---
Uh... don‚Äôt these two perks still work as they‚Äôre still getting injured? From what I understand the changes are more so dealing with things like STBL.
---
He's doing it wrong. You're supposed to do it without revving the chainsaw. Gives the survivors more hope.
---
Maybe those people should have been smarter with their money
---
Red text is kinda hard to read.  
---
You forgot "did you act like a complete asshole even though the killer played a clean game and 4k'd? yes?"  "Fuck you, kill yourself"
---
It died for a reason
---
The killer's teleport seems the same as Demogorgons. His actual power seems ok, but having to hook people for it to actually work seems like he will be super weak initially.
---
Ceaseless pursuit is literally just the bloodlust mechanic, piecing them together will literally mean a 7% speed boost each time.
---
No Salvation is just a perk that rewards losing, while also feeling to close to Blood Warden.
---
Strong Mind literally just sounds like vigil but for different status effects. Combined together and the little effect Blindness has would be even worse.
---
Fortune literally just makes Up The Ante straight up obsolete. Up the Ante is 12% and that's the condition of all survivors being alive. Whereas Fortune just being a flat 20% no matter what will make it the better option always if you ever do want to run luck builds.
---
While I like the idea of a TEW chapter, a lot of these mechanics sound like mechanics that already exist in the game with no clear thing differentiating it from them.
---
As a solo survivor I‚Äôm so glad that I can see the ranks. Just because a swf bring their rank 18 buddy I shouldn‚Äôt be forced to have a bad game.
---
The agitation helps you to get into the killer mindset!
---
No problem! üòä
---
Yes, NOED‚Äôs exposed status shows up as soon as a survivor is hit with a basic when all the gems are done.
---
*sith scream*
---
I just want a hint of emotion in it, just a bit would make it so much better. Hell, get the one white guy on fiver to do it, he's entertaining.
---
I always try to knock down the farmer as opposed to the poor guy who just got off the hook. But if I'm playing survivor and that happens to me, my frustration is *always* with my teammate üëøüëø
---
What are the chances of that happening to anyone and when it happens, i cant believe killers dont turn this into a fuckin party everyone and instead proceed to kill the survivors. You can do it all the time lads, try having silly fun when you have the chance ffs !
---
also i dont understand the blinks sometimes it will go throught things other times it will get stuck
---
Arent there 7 gens ?
---
I think rewarding higher ranks is fine. Your issue can be addressed with a simple buff to all point gains. 
---
The new blood web change was a step forward but a very small step and honestly I think the perks could start appearing way earlier.

We bought the game around the time where there wa good amount of people playing it (the reboot) and we constantly played it since then. Just a little acknowledgement would be nice, I'm  not expecting any a refund, which you can get if you literally did just bought the game a week ago
---
Oh really?  I like playing him because he‚Äôs one of the few monstrous characters.  I need ruin and Myers perks to complete him though.  Am I far off on those choices?
---
The Entity feeds on Hope/Despair. Adiris never gave up Hope for her people. Until the moment she died she remained faithful to her gods. The Entity is just masquerading as what she thought she worshipped, easily coercing her to comply in the trials as a killer. Some killers do the ritual killings after being forced into it. Some enjoy causing the despair. The Plague remains ever hopeful that her servitude will please the Entity; to her this is just a way to prove herself through worship and obedience.
---
this is weirdly accurate, good job
---
I don't mean the exposed status (or any of the round status HUD ones) but the diamond red-backed perks that appear to the bottom left of the survivors perks like thatanophobia etc

Ashy Slashy + Sweater is elite combo

It it the one at Franklin Mills? (I will never call it Philadelphia Mills)

I keep saying this, over and over and over again.  You're a killer.  Kill them, else they get a big head, think they're awesome and will make everyone else's life miserable.  I get called a toxic piece of shit for daring to suggest people play the game as intended. (And you will too, enjoy)

Wow.Just wow.

You have seen way too much this round, when pushing the activate ability button the entity will spare you for that round
---
There used to be one there, I haven't been inside one for years so I guess I didn't notice it closing.
---
Get bent.
---
Adam's last cosmetic was the desperate arts cosmetic, that has been his 2nd full outfit since release, not counting his Christmas sweater which everyone has gotten. That cosmetic came out around the time Ash did.
---
Since then every other survivor has gotten a cosmetic, some of them have gotten several cosmetics. Every survivor that has come out after Adam has gotten the same or more cosmetics than him already, including 4 of them being licensed with 1 other of the license characters getting a cosmetic as well.
---
This ain't funny BHVR, give Adam new threads! &gt;:(
---
Frank please calm the fuck down
---
I agree with this, I'll stab the guy fresh off the hook and if they go down they go down. Not my fault you took em off in front of me and as a surv main I get pissed at my teammate when i see the killer pretty close by and some bitch is running at me full speed even though the killer is like a a step away and they still take me off.
---
Usually I just down them and chase the other guy who unhooked as a form of mercy to the guy who literally couldn't stop what just happened. As a surv main I just can't bring myself to punish the guy who had no say in it, but the Bitch who unhooked him....that's a different story
---
That's the kinda thinking that lead it to die.
---
hope you kept the receipt for that comment b
---
Damn
---
About that, if your blink end-point is inside the wall, you'll be teleported to the closest to you blinkable place
---
You sound like an extremely unfun person
---
That just makes me miss macho man. He was truly a legend.
---
Un pretty sure Sloppy won't work anymore because it gets directly applied to the survivor, but I think Thana still works since the survivor gets injured when he gets hit in Feral Frenzy, correct me if I'm wrong

I've been longing for a Keeper or Stefano killer forever

They didn't have the voice for her ready and didn't want to delay the PTB so they just gave her Meg's voice. Her real voice will be ready when the Chapter comes out December 3
---
more like the killer congratulating you for have DS after he hooked other person and ""tuneled"" you
---
That man is fucking high and no wonder why he kept that mf mask on god damn
---
I don't kniw how you would use it, it varies on play style but I'd add adrenaline for endgame for a quick getaway
---
There are no updated guides that I know of. Ignore add-ons, go by an old guide, cuz most stuff still applies, just make sure to wait between blinks for your second one to recharge (unless you're sure you'll land a hit with just one)
---
Just needs a perk that you can have a chance boost yourself off the hook when you kick their face.
---
That huntress skin is great, the blood running down the antlers makes me think it ties into her back story.
---
No offence but it reminds me of those virgin vs Chad memes
---
They could add Jensen Ackles as a survivor. Nice
---
I'm so sick of the let the baby Dwight go meme, it's really lame. This is why survivors get salty when a Killer plays serious or tries to get a 4K. If you want to be altruistic just go play Survivor already.
---
such a statement works for both sides
---
Wait I just realised you said theres filters to get "rid" of it... what was the point in this post?
---
All the survivors have the same hit boxes, but we loooooove dedicates servers.
---
Cuz I saw it after I made the post. The point still stands. Isn't it?
---
Very true, can we get one for salty killers?
---
Legion really likes those Cosmic Brownies
---
Just a feeling
---
Someone was bored at work.
---
Lmao
---
no.
---
Huntress would probably eat elk, Hillbilly would eat some beef, and Spirit wouldn‚Äôt eat
---
Yeah but if there is 2 survivors at a jungle gym gen they have less time to react then wraith uncloacking from his bell audio than the pig now.
---
That might be a bit painful
---
Bubba will always hold a special place in my heart. 
---
Unfortunately I have no choice but to break out Billy, Ghostface, or Spirit when I see "ToxicMeg123" in the lobby. Feelsbad.
---
Nice! That‚Äôs awesome! üòÇüëçüèªüëåüèªü§òüèª

That was a great episode
---
No, it‚Äôs an entirely separate save file nothing carries over to live.

No, no it doesn't.  Your point is made null by the solution you found to it post-making this post. Now it's just you whining.
---
The image of the squad chilling in the gas station in auto haven eating a shit ton of cosmic brownies is one that I will cherish forever
---
Nice! I‚Äôm assuming it was a hatch game?
---
I mean when there is 1 more gen left to repair, there are 3 unrepaired gens on the left. Doesnt it mean that there are 7 in total when you add the 4 that you have already repaired to the ones that are left unrepaired ?
---
You never know. Looking at the tomes people probably have tried to escape, once the survivor is not driven by anything, they get thrown into the void
---
I think it‚Äôll get removed eventually. The whole thing is a bandaid to make up for excessive safe loops so once they‚Äôre gone they can take it off. It really doesn‚Äôt need to exist at all on maps like badham it Hawkins.
---
If you know how to use Source Filmmaker you could do that. The posing is extremely simple. I'm working on something else right now for a DBD screenshot and that is the purpose of this post.
---
Lol ikr! Its so great
---
And immediately D/C'd, because of course he did.
---
I see them a surprising amount. I only escaped one of them and then I got close with another but my teammate turned out to be working with them ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Maybe he'd eat that cow leg he has as a weapon on one skin?
---
In the earlier days of DBD, there was a glitch where more than 4 survivors could load in, and it would even increase the amount of generators that needed to be completed before exit gates were powered. Pretty sure that one doesn't exist anymore, only survivors turning into killers now.
---
Add the "camper" and salty DC sections and you're all set
---
Good meme
---
Brutal Strength Intensifies
---
It does though. Just leave them in the locker and go after someone else.
---
My God that game looks horribly unbalanced. No wonder it failed.
---
Yeah, for the most part those maps don't really need it, except for like one or two loops that are fairly safe to loop. But I still think they would keep it in and just drastically decrease how much it gives, like only a 0.1/0.2/0.3%
---
Uh... I don‚Äôt think people are toxic because they know that the killers will let them live... that‚Äôs just kinda weird.
---
I like to think that different outfits are different versions of the same character from different parallel universes. Feng Min‚Äôs Cyber Gamer outfit could be from the future, for example. Not to say stuff that looks like that isn‚Äôt around nowadays, but it could be near future. Yui could be from the near future as well

Why are you getting downvoted for this
---
This post was made by this enduring + spirit fury gang
---
If you want to feel like you're improving and outplaying survivors play spirit or ghostface both have real nice skill caps while both being playable on console
---
Most of the time but lately I‚Äôve been playing a lot and I‚Äôm at 10. I just don‚Äôt like them. I‚Äôd rather be doing anything else than exposing myself to pray the killer stays looking at my bright light. And I‚Äôm a killer main so when I get flashed i just look away. Its so easy to get around.
---
I'm not a voice actor, but I seriously considered doing a better reading of the Archives and posting it up. But it seems like there's actually not too many people that find it that bad, so probably wouldn't be worth it.

Thanataphobia and Freddy's swing addons. I think only effects that slow all actions go down there so there isn't much

Same to be honest. I might end up doing it for shits and giggles at one point as a cosplay type thing.
---
"DRAMATIC READING OF ARCHIVES guest staring Frank who won't get off my lap despite him being 50 pounds too heavy to be a lapdog"
---
Clown players rise up
---
Yeah but the survivors have no warning with the speed, I think that‚Äôs the issue here, even if you didn‚Äôt transition behind a wall the movement speed could easily guarantee a free hit because by the time they started running the pig would already be breathing on them. Another thing too powerful is the ambush, same jungle gym scenario and when the audio sounds the survivors have minimal time to react and the only way to escape a hit is a good sprint burst in the right direction.
---
It is a great addition
---
Note that I didn‚Äôt specify a side.
---
So you‚Äôre correct and I agree with you.
---
Well, here‚Äôs the thing. If you were unhooked like sub 15 or 20 seconds why would the killer do anything other than come right back for you? Longer than that that‚Äôs some odd play that isn‚Äôt very good tbh.
---
What if we're the killer, tho? D:
---
dedicated server type beat
---
Some killer addons will. Otherwise, Coulrophobia is the only other perk.
---
Yup wouldn't expect any less
---
we love getting hit and not getting hit
---
You might want to change the name of the power since Myers‚Äô power is already called the evil within, but this is a fantastic idea! I have quite a few friends that love TEW and would die to see a DBD chapter around it
---
A. As a survivor I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do much
---
2. I‚Äôm a killer main. So I‚Äôm still not able to do much lmao
---
My favourite character is nurse because she's hard to play
---
Well who won? I hate cliff hangers
---
So you think that because of the new increased speed, having the Skulk transition SFX being quiet makes Skulking to powerful?
---
Louder for the survivors in back!

The Haddonfield guy. I was playing Vanity Mirror Myers so it was thematically appropriate, but any one of the other three maps would‚Äôve been jumpscare city.

It comes out the 27th
---
Oh good, it's not just me this is happening to
---
Ghostface is clearly the child of Myers and Pig, so it's a little ... complicated.
---
Yeah no, I don't want to be killed by a hot topic Michael myers.
---
If it glows, it goes
---
Yes it‚Äôs pretty much a no fun uncounterable hit, if the pig is right behind the jungle gym wall or, any wall close to a gen, how would a survivor not get hit by an ambush? They have no time to react because the pig is   150% in their face and they can‚Äôt avoid her unless the player is garbage. Also if the pig didn‚Äôt uncloak they could just run up to them, 1 sec small cool down and bam ez hit. Or if the pig uncloaked at the wall they would still have to panic like a normal pig with straps, but people would realize the power and abuse in mentioned ways. So yes for it just to be a secondary power is too strong, it‚Äôs like spitting on the wraith pm. Explain how you would counter this please?
---
As a Demogorgon main, I can confidently say that I play Ghostface way too much to still call myself a Demo main.
---
right? right? right?
---
i don't own ruin and it hurts
---
This was rendered by u/ezio_bugmaker !

Legion's also good at amassing bloodpoints.

Don't worry, they'll be on here later complaining about hitboxes.
---
I know I just thought it would've been somewhat funny
---
just checking your vibe brother B)
---
Yeah, this has happened to me before, I am not a salty/angry person by nature so I just felt disappointed
---
No, fucking, way
---
It‚Äôs probably devour hope, better just cleanse anyways
---
the thing is that the exhaustion after blink is hard and i lose track of survivors, and if i dont blink enough if they keep running i cant catch them with second blink and rinse the process of exhaustion making me lose them.
---
i know nurse is hard but goddamn no wonder all Nurse players are sweaty i get too many toxic tbaggers and flashlight spammers as nurse
---
Heh heh hahhaha
---
What‚Äôs wrong with DS? Are they changing it?
---
Yes! More sweaters.
---
Sometimes I wish dead by daylight had more in the way of stealth gameplay rather than "waste the killers time so your friends can work on gens"
---
You gotta be kidding me
---
I hope he doesnt more for when i play survivor. Im tired of going against the same 3 killers every match.
---
When he says "HEH HA Ha ha haargh" I FEEL THAT üò§üò§üò§
---
What can I say except delete this
---
I think adding a new louder SFX to The Pig's Skulking transition would be good. And honestly The Wraith needs his own buffs and QOL improvements.
---
This was me yesterday. Ruin spawned up my ass so I cleansed it in the first 10 seconds of the game and I got mori‚Äôd later.
---
Every single one of those deserved to be changed, especially old ds cuz fuck that perk
---
They changed it about 6 months ago. Prior to the change, it could activate when you were picked up, but you didn't have to be recently unhooked first. If you weren't the obsession, you'd have to wiggle to 30% or something first.
---
My bad, I'll fix it
---
I actually would change the name of Myers' power XD
---
the ranking system never made sense to me like. if a tie game is supposed to be 2 dead 2 escape then killing 2 should garuntee no rank loss. killing 3 plus the other bonuses would bring you to 1 rank up. killing 4 should garuntee a rank up then have the bonuses get you to your second
---
And you think that was balanced?
---
So accurate, it hurts.
---
I play Piggie and *played* Legion until they nerfed him and changed his power so much he isn't fun.
---
I agree just saw the chance to make this template work tbh
---
Good idea and maybe make her have a louder movement sound so you could get a small jump on her? I agree about wraith, he sucks lol.
---
Nurse?
---
One more, swf is broken. Only comes to mind cause it happened yesterday yet again.

Of course there's always a few rotten eggs and then people will just focus on that and stereotype.

Orrrrr get matched against me (the asshole) that runs Small Game every match and kiss your crutch goodbye regardless of killer selection.

Anyone getting annoyed by NOED, just run Small Game.  It destroys their only gameplan and then you're just left with a NOED-less NOED gamer which typically makes for ridiculously easy games.

I literally only made the meme. I didn‚Äôt tunnel him at all. I never tunnel. Just thought it‚Äôd be a funny meme

Also his name was ‚ÄòNameIsToxic.TTV‚Äô so I was expecting the worst.
---
Small game survivors scare me deeply. If my NOED gets cleansed, the survivors just devoured my hope.
---
I'm fine with the toning down his turning control a bit but I just hope they keep his flick, it's so good
---
Are you really starting to offend me now? Dude get fuck out of here with your bullcrap alright? You think those shitposts and memes are cool? Good for you. It looks like a garbage can to me.
---
I wouldnt even do that. I would eat the ds if he instantly goes to a locker and then just chase someone else.
---
This is a known issue - I found some reports in the 3.4.0 feedback forums, and it has similar effects for killers viewing survivors as well. Some killer believed it was only killers and didn't observe the same thing playing as survivors.
---
So I wouldn't blame it on lagswitching, and it doesn't seem to only greatly benefit killers. There's a video of Laurie vanishing, then Claudette, Nea teleporting, etc. All with &lt;40ms ping.
---
Shouldn't it be "No-Edd", in this case??
---
I'll see myself out...

I play Ghostface üëª

I've been having a lot of fun lately. Never really used a flashlight before yesterday, but got my two blinds in my third game. I still suck at it, but I think I'll bring a flashlight more often now just to practice.
---
That actually looks really good
---
Yeah if you don't have Borrowed Time then don't be the dingbat who blatantly farms a teammate.
---
At this point I'll just try to kill myself on hook if I see someone beelining for me with the Killer right behind them.
---
Not liking someone isn't a valid reason to report them tho
---
The survivor looks like Adam Francis xD but good job loved the concept
---
I personally feel the flick is necessary
---
Not sure if you are already aware but you don't have to do the entire gen, just be on it when  it to completes to do the challenge.
---
Yeah but not all Killers will do that.  They'll go for the low-hanging fruit instead because that potentially gets a Survivor out of the game faster.
---
Why your optic on backwards tho
---
Surprisingly few invitations for sex and attacks on my sexual orientation.
---
That‚Äôs another option. Regardless, there is definitely counterplay to it.
---
Clown of the day ü§°
---
&gt;wouldn't neither
---
is this on PTB or normal game
---
yea that's exactly how nurse is. You can have a great match where you destroyed everyone, they didn't do a single gen, but you missed 2 blinks and you'll call that a bad match. 
---
Nurse is VERY punishing and they made it even more punishing with the nerf. She's also very rewarding once you put enough practice in.
---
A perk "I'm All Ears" is amazing on Nurse. If you can, try it out. You'll love it.
---
He only thought if he could, but never stopped to think if he should
---
He also breaks pallets much faster.
---
+100 **WAKE UP**
---
Either way, we not seeing this gay shit in dbd :)
---
While Oni has like 100x better mobility and control than Hillbilly with even steering add-ons. I'm not going to argue "Oni is OP nerf" vs. "well Hillbilly is the same so why is he fine!?" but when the argument does arise, it is rather convenient to leave out the things that make them different and the pros/cons between the 2. This goes for any killers who share similarities.
---
At face value, Oni's charge is straight up better than Hillbilly's chainsaw no questions asked. Which is why his is temporary and can be canceled out, as well as needing to be charged. To balance it out.
---
I'm used to it. I say the "unpopular" opinion and take the karma hits so you dont have to
---
Theres no punishment
---
Playing toxic makes you pip and the killers wont retaliate because of some imaginary set of rules
---
Oh god, blendettes
---
So damn accurate. Some people just really want to insult you for petty stuff.
---
Don‚Äôt tunnel
---
Still keeping a tally, I've gotten more hatemail from killers as survivor than the opposite.
---
At least it‚Äôs not like demogorgon. Only got a single paragraph describing it.
---
Sounds pretty accurate to survivors. No killer goes in expecting to win, they expect to black pip at most, maybe single pip if they are lucky
---
Think it‚Äôs more direction. The pauses are too short and he speaks too fast. The text is supposed to be read dramatically.
---
My response to that is your username
---
- Start chasing someone
---
- They run directly to the hook
---
Happens more often then you think, I don't get why people even try doing it without BT
---
Also I've played against people who crouch right behind hooks and then unhook as soon as the hooking animation is finished and I turn around, in those cases I really don't know what they were expecting other than farming.
---
Uninstalling to never play vs Freddy again
---
Dwight's and claudettes are the absolute worst
---
At least blue hair neas are just memeing
---
They can also do the whole "nice &lt;item (with/without addon)/perk&gt;" dismissal.
---
good
---
Sadly, that's not how it works. It's more centered around interactions other than the end result. That's why a perfect game is so damn near impossible to get.
---
Hey there, I watched your video and I think there are a few areas for you to maybe focus on when you next play. I'm by no means an amazing killer, but I've played for quite a while now and I usually end up in the upper purple ranks each season, the plague is also one of my favourite killers!
---
 First things first: you seem to spend a lot of time at the start of the game puking on gens and pallets and stuff, I think this is a little bit of a waste of time since the plague is entirely based on snowballing in my opinion so you want to find and down the first person as soon as you possibly can, you can fairly easily guess where survivors have spawned most of the time since they are usually near far away gens.
---
 Secondly: I would say focusing on target selection is a big deal for you, sometimes in the video, you would start chasing survivors in areas which are generally quite time wasteful - ie. the Badham school, whilst it may have been more time-efficient to simply make them sick and then leave. During these chases you also seemed to not pay a huge amount of attention to your Discordance procs and also even nearby gens being worked on, I think abandoning some of the earlier chases in favour of seeking out the nearby gens with discordance may have been a better choice and was probably the main reason so many gens were done so fast, since you weren't really putting much pressure on them.
---
 Another thing perhaps you could work on is your pathing since you seemed to try and take different routes to the survivors a lot to try and throw them off, which is good, but you ended up losing the trail, probably just keeping the survivor in your sight would be a good way of keeping up the chase for now so you can again get someone on the hook to keep pressure. There was also a point right at the end where you left an injured Jake who you may have been able to catch before he made it to the exit as you took a different path to him.
---
 Also some random plague tips: I don't like running both ruin and corrupt intervention as you kind of give the survivors and excuse to just search for your ruin while the gens are blocked with corrupt intervention. Also you want to avoid hitting non-sick survivors as if you just puke on them until they are broken you can basically keep up with them at all times until you can down them instantly, by doing so you prevent them getting a speed boost from the hit and that helps keep chases shorter as they might not be able to make it to a strong area on the map as easily.
---
Hope this doesn't come across as too harsh but just some areas that maybe you could focus on, I'm happy to help with anything else specifically you don't understand and happy to watch any other videos you have. Don't give up most importantly! Don't get too upset with how many kills you get per game, and think of the fun part as learning all sorts of cool tricks which you can use later down the line. Also, if it's of any consolation, this wasn't really a game at your rank anyway, as you were against 2 greens and 2 purples, not a single yellow rank player there, so all things considered you did pretty well for yourself!
---
No, you always save the baby dwight, even if the killer is face camping
---
who cares, people like fun. if you dont like it use the filters and shut up. You presented a fix to the "problem" then complained about hte problem.
---
That leatherface skin looks pretty good
---
I‚Äôm a Doc main so I might be biased, but he‚Äôs my second favorite killer to play against after Huntress. There‚Äôs a ton of potential for mindgames around the shocks, and he adds more spice to gen repairs than just holding M1.
---
I also admit to being jumpscared by the illusions on more than one occasion.
---
Each and every one of these concepts are amazing. I personally love the ‚ÄúExperienced Detective‚Äù perk concept. It‚Äôs unique and can help survivors locate the killer easier. I also enjoy the idea of the ‚ÄúNo Salvation‚Äù perk concept. With that perk, SWF will be severely crippled.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
yeah, but for killer specifically, it makes way more sense for the end result to be the main factor in ranking as the killers only job is to kill as many people as possible. I've literally gotten a 4 man kill and not ranked up because the game ended too quickly

Someone: I think the new killer just needs, in my opinion, if it's not important, a change in \*random thing\*
---
Everyone in this reddit: OMG HOW DARE YOU HE DOESN'T NEED NERFS DELETE THIS REPORTED BLOCKED KILLED FUCK YOU HE IS BALANCED
---
How does one heal from a locker?
---
Wow this is too good
---
Oh, yes there is
---
I think both killers are fine. Their differences in handling and the availability of their powers is the gap that creates balance for both of them.

What if she was when she was taken? Assuming the entity takes all of the same character as long as they each are where they were (which is why there‚Äôs theoretically cosmetics), wHaTs stopping every single Yui from being high

You leave the otters out of this!

He looks like a deformed Thanos.

He looks like Dave Bautista. Well, more like Drax.

This is a repost because I was notified that I forgot to assign a flair to the original post but didnt see the message until after the 24 hour period. Sorry if anyone who saw the original post before it was taken down sees this as spam.

His paintbrush too.
---
Detective's Hunch is better if you got the memory or a map. Can verify all the totems are clear.
---
Did he even get a cosmetic? I thought he and Freddy were in licensing hell ATM.
---
Huntress, Plague, And Demogorgon are...high fashion

&gt;Either way, we not seeing this gay shit in dbd :)

That's a red flag buddy..

You can apply that filter through NVIDIA overlay. Here is a tutorial: https://youtu.be/qCwMfzVMqmY

I approve immensely

They have lvl 1 and 2 perks it's not kyf

That's just human thinking. No one praises the good but everyone pays attention and hates the bad.

I THINK he did, I'm pretty sure it's some boring reindeer sweater called Red Nose... Or not! But red and black sweater for Quentin would be awesome
---
That's the joke. It's pretty easy.

With one of Nancy's perks, if you break a totem, and get injured, you can go into a locker for a bit and heal

At that point why leave it at all? That's not enough to notice, much less make a difference

You have my condolences

It was just an example, i doubt they would drop it that low
---
You‚Äôve summed up exactly why I stopped playing, but still follow the subreddit and news.
---
He didnt.
---
Don‚Äôt you need to hit a survivor first tho? You can use Billys chainsaw 0 seconds into the match and keep using it even just for mobility,
---
Nah maps are too rare for me to switch to that and I wouldn't find it at all useful without the map.  I've been playing a long time so I've got a good nose for spawns anyway so Small Game ensures I don't miss any of them.  Also I often find their Ruin in the first 30 seconds.  Probably nets me about 3 babyragequits per session if I play for a while.  Some killers feel entitled to have their hexes up lol.
---
Very good üîî
---
You think this is a form of punishment from the entity because I know there‚Äôs no way in hell bill put that on willingly
---
VIBE CHECK TIME
---
it depends on survivors
---
It only cost ¬£5 a while back so it's not too bad a loss.
---
Not a red flag, we don‚Äôt need random ass sexuality/pride Charms in a game that‚Äôs not oriented around it
---
Understandable. I ran Small Game before I got Detective's off the Shrine and SG is way more useful for finding Ruin or any totem early game since DH needs a gen done. Gens popping at the same time can decrease the value too, so SG definitely has it's place.
---
I just think knowing that an area is clear and seeing where gens are make DH the perk for me.
---
Where‚Äôs the option where a survivors genuinely call me a monkey n***a for killing them? No? Just me? *Ah*
---
There‚Äôs a whole show of backstory.
---
Yea It‚Äôs been happening to me I thought the same  thing
---
Love that Bubba
---
Did you just
---
sip y‚Äôall remember the shack with 2 windows no bloodlust and you literally couldn‚Äôt catch up
---
Yeah, but nothing about how it got to the entity. Thought it would be cool to see some mindflayer entity interaction, since they‚Äôve both got ‚Äúrealms‚Äù and ‚Äúkillers‚Äù of their own.
---
yourself and the person blocking. are they a dick? yea. but even so you can still leave the locker
---
yeah, same here, playing mostly with the same people, even.
---
***New Killer perk: Fuck your "Fuck your NOED"***
---
***At the start of the match, any survivors using the perk "Fuck your NOED" will be sacrificed, and be forced to stare at a gif of Trapper pelvic thrusting for 30/45/60 seconds.***
---
well I was the killer, salty survivor chose option A XD
---
Thank you!! :)
---
I love my Trappy.
---
God the game was so scuffed back then y‚Äôall remember the infinite‚Äôs one the game that were impossible to catch a survivors at and remember original BNP also remember fucking self care botany well make it and med kit making it possible to heal before the killer wipes of their weapon
---
I gotta say he is the only killer that I genuinely have fun playing.
---
I appreciate it!!
---
This is an intended feature, but there is a bug that makes it not work. I believe it was in the chapter 13 patch notes.
---
Or the fact that some loops were actually impossible to win as killer ie the shack when it had 2 windows and killer didn‚Äôt have auto aim god this game was omega scuffed
---
Ok boomer

**I Came Out to Have a Good Time and I'm Honestly Feeling So Attacked Right Now**

in that case you‚Äôre definitely not in the wrong. even as a survivor when i play with friends i open lockers they‚Äôre in to fuck with them, it‚Äôs a dick move. you‚Äôre good
---
Myself and the traitor

It pretty good you got the wraith leg on spot he has long feminine leg and that smile that smile is terrifying and look so cute

Some people just love to hate

Why would I want to go into a match as a leveled Rank 12 Survivor and be paired with a Rank 19 level 5 Meg, Rank 18 level 12 Jane, and a Rank 20 brand new player?
---
It's basically asking for frustration.  Especially if the Killer is like some fully perked out tryhard who just happened to get a lucky matchup against baby survivors (or deranked purposely for easier matches).
---
Yeah that sounds fair enough, largely a preference thing by the sounds of it and the buff to Detectives Hunch definitely helped make it more worthwhile for sure.
---
I asked the Meg, who I knew was running QnQ and going into lockers (which is why I checked in the first place), where she jumped out of a locker when I hooked the Nea, and she confirmed she got points while being in the Coal Tower.
---
why should there be a risk for trying to expand your community? how is that a bad thing

Definitely did. Probably wouldn't have snagged it otherwise.

Either way, keep fighting the good fight and save your team from NOED!
---
BHVR want to stop lag switching so they made it base kit
---
I'm actually not sure if he was in front of it or in the corner next to it but it was where the hook was and he just did not run. didnt see her so okay shes in a locker
---
Yui was a cringe tumblr fantasy backstory
---
Everyone looks so edgy and then there is the clown
---
A killer can be balanced but still unfun, let's say you have a thanos killer, his one power is that he snaps his fingers and 2 survivors die, then he can no longer attack for the rest of the game, perfectly balanced in the eyes of bhvr, but really awful design, survivors dont like feeling like there is absolutely nothing they do to survive.
---
Well, he NEEDS ONE. Freddy and him are the ONLY characters without cosmetics.
---
It could and should happen, Scream was also associated with Wes.
---
No, you get the rewards from the end and are good to keep going.
---
Freddy‚Äôs license has reverted back to the Wes Craven estate. There is no issue with licensing. All BHVR has to do is reach out to the Estate and ask for permission. The estate has actively been trying to revive the brand as well. 
---
Considering New Line and WB were pushing the remake as ‚Äú the definitive Freddy‚Äù, which is why MK9, MKX mobile and DBD all feature the remake, you‚Äôd think the Craven Estate would push the original Freddy instead since that‚Äôs the one Craven created. If BHVR asked, I have no doubt they‚Äôd be able to get Classic cosmetics for Freddy and Quentin (have him dressed like Glenn from the original) or even other creative cosmetics.
---
yes please
---
Thanks friend!
---
No problem. Happy stabbing!
---
i tried to make most of his features similar to the original while keeping it cartoony, so I appreciate that! his little smile is my favorite part of him üòÑ
---
YES! I've experienced this before and wondered what it was.
---
Oh really?
---
It cute but terrifying at the same time keep up the good work
---
My compilation of kobe usually ends with the Killer hitting me again right away üòñ
---
thankyou, I will!
---
Yes. So making a b line for the epilogue to get the reward is okay, then you can complete the rest later. Some challenges are hard and can be skippable if you do the others around it
---
Really odd that they haven't negotiated his release on switch and mobile yet. Behaviour is such a weird company.
---
Slug the unhook, chase the farmer. I only consider it tunneling if a killer chases through BT or immediately picks up the unhook.
---
You are the only one Who got my point.
---
It's actually correct as "Yamaoka" btw but the video says "Yamoaka" LOL
---
Eeeehhhhh... The ratio tho is quite different
---
So like for example: 
---
Survivors: distract a killer with a pebble 
---
or 
---
Killers: mori a scoops a hoy steve? 
---
I like bounty hunter style ones. What if we did a contest where a killer has to  hook  the best looking David, and we all hunt for the sexiest outfitted survivor all week? Then we all vote on who bagged the cutest one?
---
Ok toxic season has begun
---
It‚Äôs something that could be very easily negotiated as well. Wish they‚Äôd just reach out. Freddy is the only killer with absolutely no cosmetics outside of prestige. Most fans prefer the original, so it‚Äôs quite annoying not seeing literally anything for him.
---
This is incredibly well made and thought out. The perks and abilities (although some having major similarities to others) seem super fun, and the effort you put into this is developer level.
---
I never played The Evil Within games, but this still look super fun!
---
They just did some trading, now ye mindflayer has the doctor and he's coming for 11
---
Huntress and Plague are really cool, I would pay for those skins
---
&gt; *The gap between the tree and the low wall is small enough for survivors to slip through but not killers.*

That sounds like something you would need to report to BHVR support.

Tachanka confirmed killer?
---
What do you mean "weirdly" accurate?
---
Yes please!
---
Oni dash doesn't hit anything though. He has to stop, stagger, then wind up the attack and hope the lunge hits. It's a significant tradeoff where hillbilly can just backrev you into oblivion.
---
Advantage of playing survivor. Perks can make any character best
---
Oh come on from that movie. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt even make sense for her to be a survivor wtf mate.
---
Dude don't get me started on the resounding juvenility around here.
---
It depends who you speak to. For some people it is synonymous with "try hard", someone who wants to win so badly that they're literally sweating. It is generally meant to be interpreted as a negative thing.
---
What if the most powerful is the most fun for me? (Dont say that im shit im a prestiege 3 bubba)
---
Wraith ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Thank you very much
---
Not against Freddy they don't
---
New cosmetic incoming
---
I mean, first of all nobody ever said that, there are toxic people either side. Survivors are just way more prevalent due to their number
---
Second, we have no idea how was the game, you could've taunted him the whole game as far as we know. Take things out of context is hella easy. Might not be the case but the doubts remains
---
Third, as said in the first point, you meet way more survivors being assholes, especially after the game due to the group reinforcement. Being in a group, random or not, makes you more confident and is easier to be a dick towards somebody that is alone. It's psychology 101 really, they teach that sht in middle school and say that killers can't be toxic is just a lie. More often than not I see that as a consequence of constant harassment tho
---
Happened to me once. I was Plague but I couldn't vomit. It'd charge but wouldn't launch. The Legion was acting just fine, though
---
Oni-chan : I sleep
---
Oni-sama : ***REAL SHIT?!***
---
Oni and billy are at the same level because oni needs to charge his ability, however when oni has his power there is little to no counterplay on the survivor side during chases making him unfun to play against.  Balance wise they should make Oni‚Äôs power easier to charge up but easier (possible) for survivors to juke the swing and deplete some of the Oni‚Äôs meter through pallet stuns.
---
Its supposed to be cut. I guess i could have used a scissors emoji to make it clearer.
---
Maybe he will get a new face for Christmas.
---
I don‚Äôt think either killer needs nerfed. People will learn how to deal with Oni soon enough.
---
Oh? You're approaching me?

I had a game as plague a month or two ago where I killed two people and 3/5 gems got done. After that I patrolled the gens and just puked on them all. Spent 20 minutes doing it because they never would work on the gen lest get found or get sick. Took forever but I got a 4 k and a max bloodpoint score.

Well based on Ur build. It's what u deserve

Great work as always, Skemoo. Thanks for those. Cheers!

---
As a Legion/Pig/Wraith main, I feel this. Very thoroughly.
---
What does DWM do?
---
Balanced landing was the only one that didn‚Äôt need to be hard nerfed/changed. The other perks made the game unplayable for killers while you could argue that balanced landing highlighted balance issues with some of the maps. Not to say balanced landing wasn‚Äôt/isn‚Äôt super strong but height/drops will pretty much always be a hit on survivors now and there really isn‚Äôt much they can do about it.

Thanks a lot! And I HIGHLY recommend TEW 1 and 2. They're basically the spiritual successors to Silent Hill.

Couldn't remember hers off the top of my head, but I remember it dragging on and not being that engaging. I liked the elements of the story but none if it seemed really convincing, which says a lot since it's DBD. Lol

Mandatory Fixated Week might be a good idea.
---
*Fuck mad Grit,I got mad grip*

I try this a lot too but there's only so much you can do.with a group for 4 identical Neas.
---
Right, but sometimes when you're in the process of hooking or take a couple of steps away and whispers procs you frigging know someone's coming for the save. It's worth doing a little lap for a few seconds if you don't have any better information.
---
Pig has a dash forward you bag of jello
---
Pander to the subreddit more.
---
I mean I play both sides and I definitely see it a lot on from both.  Ive had killers completely flip a shit in chat for no reason.  You gotta realize you see 4 times as many survivors if you only play killer, but its definitely rampant on both sides same with DCing
---
She's going to be voiced by Danny Devito.
---
That's just the buff it needed!
---
Hillybilly
---
Yep, it's completely ridiculous that they just ignore Adam like that. He was the first survivor I ever mained (got the game in October last year) but I dropped him for other survivors because they had lots of nice cosmetic options while he doesn't. Right now it's easier getting cosmetics for Tapp (a licensed character!!) than for Adam. It doesn't make any sense.
---
People keep saying that the reason why he's not getting new cosmetics is because few people play as him, but one of the main reasons why few people play as him is because he doesn't have many nice cosmetics and running the same ones gets old. And it's not a DLC paywall thing because Spirit is crazily popular so lots of people bought them.
---
Come on BHVR, stop ignoring our beloved Jamaican prof so that we can play as him for more than a few matches.

You must be kinda Bad at the game if you think that the previous version of ds was better lol

Agitation iron grasp carry survivor to hook near totem camp=profit on console because console survivors cant do ruin skill checks for shit.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not because if you don‚Äôt use a specific killer with a specific build then you will likely have little to no map pressure, especially when survivors decide to repair first the gens that are far from each other, you just need to GiT GuD‚Äù
---
Honestly as a nurse and huntress main on console (PS4) it really sucks that you have quite a bit of limitation due to not being able to flick your mouse to hit a blink or hatchet and successfully aim correctly even.
---
I‚Äôd suggest levelling up other killers first for these killers however, they are heavily perk reliant for stuff like Ruin (Huntress slow mobility) and BBQ for the nurse to help keep up the pressure to prevent gens.
---
You can‚Äôt exactly do much about asshole survivors that try and bully you for being new but if you keep on trying and figure out a strategy you like for both the killers your gonna have a hard time.
---
It‚Äôs up to you if you wanna try and get good for huntress or nurse due to how hard they are on console and the limitations,  but if you spend time to figure them out you can be a lethal powerhouse.
---
For survivors messaging you just disable the messages, you can get to your friends, although there is nothing you can do to toxic survivors other than completely destroy them and not get agitated by flashlights and stuns.
---
*"You'll regret it because he ^is a ^^really* **BIG** *^^^fucker"*

Bhvr would never allow it, the killer teachables arent completely worthless
---
I mean... at the end of the day they can‚Äôt stop you. But people should try to enjoy the game instead of just sweating and playing in ways where they don‚Äôt have fun overall. If you have fun camping, fine. But if you camp to just detract from others fun, it‚Äôs kind of just a waste of time.

Just yesterday I personally discovered gen rushing (it‚Äôs been used against me, since I play killer) and my games have been a fucking nightmare ever since. Now I know what killer I should main and what perks I should run. Thank you.
---
"He gets mad really easily..."
---
This is actually extremely good and accurate, damn.
---
Even at top level, Hillbilly doesn't have the control Oni has, and still needs to charge the saw and not be able to turn after. Oni seems a lot more flexible until maybe top level.
---
Character wise or skill wise?
---
I would pay my left nut for that wraith skin
---
Obviously skill wise. Character means nothing in terms of survivor
---
Discordance, Iron Maiden, whispers, NOED
---
Not a legion player.
---
This will reach hot soon. I might've jinxed it or might not have. Remember me when your post is hot.
---
I'm not so sure about that. Tosse two experiences are supposed to be novel. I feel like some of the charm of dbd would be lost if you went against/played a killer with "practice" from the tutorials. There's better things they could be making, but they'd be setting time for the tutorials. 
---
The only thing I dislike about the tutorials is that it doesn't tell you about saving your teammates by stunning the killer and hex totems.
---
She even got sprintburst...
---
Who? I can‚Äôt see anything
---
It's kind of like how Fight Club thought it was artistic because it cut out "unnecessary details," but was actually just pretentious and incoherent.
---
Ideally, they'd know when to make things fluid and engrossing and when to make them abrupt and distressing.
---
im like 400% sure that when the servers die the game will probably be unable to either be purchased or straight up removed from the store, so yeah, it's not like theyre making any more money off the thing
---
From all the reasons you could make the survivors think you are friendly just to killing them, this is one of the few that nobody would blame you
---
and they still have yet to fix how trapper's woodsman icon is too far back
---
I hate when people do this,both when I'm playing survivor or killer.

RIGHT? The writing style, at least to me, is HORRIBLE. And I guess the reader is doing a great job at reading terrible sentences in a fitting way

I‚Äôve seen 3 survivors in the lobby grouped up, but 1 survivor is pretty far to the right. Idk if that‚Äôs supposed to happen or not

Let's see here. A killer clown that can morph into anything. Nah

A random evolved hairless and faceless dog? Sure why not.

So Billy is better at focusing one person, while Oni's better when spreading out damage, especially with Sloppy Butcher. They're more like stances of the same character than individuals.

Almost all perks that inflict debuffs do.
---
Patch notes from PTB
---
&gt;Debuff perks no longer appear on the Survivors in-game HUD until the debuff is applied. This is true for the following perks: Coulrophobia, Overwhelming Presence and Unnerving Presence. 
---
Implies survivors won't be notified until they're actually affected by the debuff.
---
Anyways the perks I know of that notify are:
---
Dying Light, Coulrophobia, Overwhelming Presence, Unnerving Presence, Thanatophobia, Remember Me (Shown when opening gate)
---
Franklin's Demise doesn't show as a debuff icon, but they do see it pop up on the left side of the screen similar to most status effects for a few seconds when you hit an item out of their hands.
---
Freddy's slow addons, Black Box and Red Paint Brush are also revealed.
---
Trapper's Honing Stone is also shown to survivors when they step in a trap.
---
Do you even Raimi?
---
This.

This is me right now.

I'm currently trying to get BBQ &amp; Chilli as a teachable cuz I can't play well without it

And man. What a pain.

Seriously. I feel like anything about his personal codes or any other relationships would've enhanced all the murdering
---
*Cute ,maniacal giggles*
---
What the hell was he doing
---
This is so true I see it all the time people in the Facebook Community Post in their 4K matches at rank 17 or above. Bragging about how easy it was and don't see how people have such a hard time, saying that the Killer is like Trapper and clown are overpowered. Then they start to hit a little green and purple rank and the sadness kicks in LOL.
---
if you put oni-chan in your name you're getting moried
---
My life will never be the same. I will never get rid of the nightmares. I‚Äôll always remember myself screaming ‚ÄúHOW ARE YOU ALL DOING THIS?!?!?!?!!!!!!‚Äù to the TV.
---
Was playing on the PTB yesterday and a killer said "nice pre-made" since we were coordinated. If he had bothered to check our friends list, he would know we didn't know each other. 
---
But yeah, all good surivors are in swf/s
---
This who y‚Äôall be falling daddy? lol
---
Better then 3

*"He has a 6 foot studded sex paddle so you better leave"*
---
"Git outta mah &lt;estate&gt;."
---
I‚Äôm still at rank 16, mind you... And I already encounter gen rushers in almost every single match I played. I‚Äôve had only one game where I managed to 4K and it took me 20 minutes. Even then, it was a fucking miracle that I got a 4K in the first place. It wasn‚Äôt easy at all though.
---
The problem is you can play in really gross ways to get kills that make the game not fun for anyone, so they want to try to make you at least spread out the hits, make sure people aren't dying on first hook, etc. 
---
It's not just about winning, it's about making the game an enjoyable experience. Hell, that's why they haven't in game tied winning to how many kills you get or escaping vs getting killed.
---
I was able to put down portals but not use them here. Also my perk 'Surge' activated whenever the Spirit downed someone. The game seems to get very confused with multiple killers
---

---
Survivor main over here. I hope he never gets nerfed he's an actual scary killer that doesn't rely on jump scares to scare you. His powers are tons of fun and when you see him demon dash to you I actually get scared I hope they never change him.
---
Plus windows hit Oni more
---
They probably got it early because it's probably easier to update games on mobile markets
---
I can flip that around. I‚Äôve been getting my ass handed to me since rank reset. I usually do well enough to safety pip but otherwise I‚Äôm getting ‚ÄúEntity Displeased‚Äù for every ‚ÄúMerciless Killer‚Äù I get (the latter usually when the game decides I‚Äôve gone on enough of a slump that it deems to throw me a group full of potatoes). In my last game I got bullied for fifteen minutes, got a few hooks but no sacrifices, but somehow I managed to go up a pip. It‚Äôs like, FFS, even when I lose the game won‚Äôt let my rank change.
---
its different for killer and survivor. survivor shouldn't be completely tied to getting out. it should be about how much you did for the team whereas killer doesn't have a team. his sole goal is to kill. so it should be tied to getting kills and tbh if a killer face camps a hook(which i assume is what you're talking about) everyone  else will escape and the killer will lose
---
Ah, the entry level platter.
---
I guess the slurs and demands for suicide are DLC.
---
He's great with STBFL since you can still use Shred on your obsession to not consume stacks. The other 2 are OK but not really needed. Ruin is, well, Ruin and pretty much expected (though on stronger killers I've been using Corrupt Intervention instead lately).
---
*Cries in PS4*
---
Was not aware of noise reduction being passive

Yeah, anyways it does take some skill, you gotta know where the survivor is and how far you have to flick

Wad ya do about the blendettes

Oh boi ,Resident Evil 2 concept? I am interested

He looks dehydrated but then again there‚Äôs fucking nothing in the entity‚Äôs world to drink. Except for blood. And also- actually I won‚Äôt go into it.
---
Turned a 1K into a 4K today because they didn't want to leave the game and kept swarming the hooked survivor. I just run the fuck out when I play survivor and theres no chance for a rescue. Sometimes you gotta know when to quit.
---
Me in purple to red ranks: Aw shit, Here we go again
---
*screaming in the distance*
---
Can anyone explain to me what the thing is with decisive strike and lockers, doesn‚Äòt the perk just stun the killer after you get picked up after being on a hook?
---
He could have at least questioned himself when he killed his own father, or when he got a nickname he hated, or really at any point.
---
That's what I said. My girlfriend was yelling "what are they DOING" the instant Claudette went down. I just sat there after the hatch was closed and told her "they literally would've gotten a 1k win".
---
Thanks for that uh...trip. It was worth a watch.
---
Only if it‚Äôs SWF and still it‚Äôs rare amongst them
---
Thank ya
---
Let‚Äôs not forget that he shouldn‚Äôt lose his Power when he picks Survivors up. And maybe make it so your Gauge Depletes slightly slower when Carrying a Survivor to not promote Slugging. In return slightly increase the amount of Blood Required to Get your Power. Voila. Balanced and Fun
---
I have no idea. I turned off messages a few days ago and now I kinda regret it, wanted to see what they would've said
---
How did you make two people DC as Wraith?
---

---
Damn man, how much did that desktop wallpaper cost you?
---
If I DC on the killer then I win.
---
Damn boy he T H I C C
---
Yeah this game has gotten pretty stressful it has went from a horror Thriller type game to a competitive Death Race. I used to love playing killer and I mainly played it but now it's more of a stressful situation that rewards me more bloodpoints
---
Why you gotta tbag?, Just leave the fucking game guys, you won you don't gotta rub it in their face lmao
---
Honestly, I have a better time farming than playing a good chunk of the time.
---
No idea. This is why I always just book it out as survivor.
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
Demogorgon got me my first win
---
In this case, Tbagging got them from a 1k game to a 3k. Just leave, honestly.
---
It's utterly surreal that they're putting effort into taking away things that people like.
---
I REALLY don‚Äôt wanna give up just yet because I love the concept of DbD. I love playing as iconic serial killers, I love the chapters that keep getting added and all that stuff.
---
But it‚Äôs really, really stressful man. I‚Äôve been raging more than I ever imagined I would in this game, not gonna lie.
---
Your second blink comes at what .25 ms later?   It wasn't really that nerfed.

"High mobility" is an understatement. I've seen this fucker just straight blasting off at times. I just leave the boy alone

I actually do pretty dang good with Myers, he's my favorite and my best! Also the only killer or survivor I've prestiged so far.

This is gold I fight with myself every match that my ruin gets cleansed super early if I could still play mercifully or try my best to beat them by any means. I wish I could give this more upvotes

No. It's just going to be another person that's proven to fight; who we played as who fought, bound to do nothing more than run around and press m1.

Oni sees the Entity and thinks its a really big spider. Hence pummling anything in sight

It‚Äôs glitched tapp is supposed to say something different

Wahh^hhh^^hhh^^^hhh^^^^hhhh

Was about to say I swore I killed this guy the other day in SOW
---
Damn that sucks. Thanks for telling me though
---
Crouching.
---
My goal for most games is 4 stacks of BBQ and maybe 1-2 kills. Not only does this give me and the survivors more enjoyable matches - I can relax at a certain point and just chase survivors around for practice - but it also means I don't rank up too quickly into ranks where I don't belong.
---
4K is exceptional. 2K is average. I wish I'd known this going in.
---
HOLD UP. Shred doesn't take away STBFL stacks? I've been playing Demo completely wrong!
---
No, why would the chat work consistently?
---
Clown made me laugh. The rest are just absolutely awful.
---
Who cares? Nobody talks, aside from Plague's mori line and Ash in menus.

---
I like these a lot. I've thought of a similar build for the keeper in the past, but never got around to posting it. My version of the power had safes spawning near totems and in the basement by default, and whenever you teleported, you left the safe where you were, forcing you to be careful about where you were teleporting from. I also would have had him use the barbed wire mines as an alternate power. 
---
If I had to change anything about yours, while keeping the idea original (and not mine) I'd change ceaseless pursuit to be: whenever you break a pallet, gain a stack of bloodlust. Bloodlust is not removed by breaking pallets.
---
It provides a alternative to enduring spirit fury with brutal and this, and makes for a potentially new style of chase.
---
A wall just ^^breaks in the distance
---
That‚Äôs actually a great way to look at things. I‚Äôm not used to this game yet, so for me a 3k was ‚Äúaverage‚Äù and a 4k was actually ‚Äúgood‚Äù.
---
Lower than that, I always thought the matches were straight up garbage, aka *I* was garbage (unless survivors were being dicks or were actually better than me)
---
It‚Äôs all about the mindset I guess. I need to adapt it
---
Correct. You can Shred the obsession and it won't take away stacks. However if you Shred a non obsession target you don't gain stacks so you want to ideally M1 them until you're full stacks.
---
Yes its on console as well, switch to killer from spectator at the exact same second the survivor readys up
---
Yeah, one free match as Freddy, but with no perks, so you're probably going to get stomped and BMed, as with any Splinter.
---
If you're low rank, it may be fun, though.
---
Skins are made depending on how popular a character is. Lots of skins for Claudette, Dwight, Meg and Nea for obvious reasons

Yeah I didn't think it would end up free, at least any time soon. Oh well

Hopefully they will add some buff to killers or at least the balance the game to where generators take a little longer
---
Well it‚Äòs your own fault for killing the survivors as killer you fucking asshole   /s
---
Had to post this twice because...?
---
That‚Äôs actually a great way to look at things. I‚Äôm not used to this game yet so for me, 3k was average and 4K was actually good. If I got 2k or even lower, I was immediately frustrated because I thought the match went terrible because:
---
-I was garbage
---
-survivors were dicks
---
-I wasn‚Äôt necessarily playing terribly (for a noob‚Äôs standard) but survivors were still better than me 
---
I need to change my mindset. Genuinely, thank you for the advice. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm gonna be able to act like you do anytime soon, but you helped me a lot.
---
Wait, console tells you what they are without mouseover?
---
Survivors: OMG PLS HADDONFIELD
---
Killer: OMG PLS HAWKINS
---
when a survivor runs back into you, look down at the ground and release your blink, you'll stay in place and be able to hit the survivor
---
 It‚Äôs unpopular because it‚Äôs just untrue. Killers do kill survivors. Some killers let survivors live because of their own reasons though.
---
Jokes on you I say the at the end of every match even as a survivor
---
Survivor propaganda
---
I agree. I'm a Quentin main. Those properties are held by different companies though and NOES' is pretty hard to deal with apparently.
---
Happening to me too, takes like 15 seconds as suvivor but 20+ minutes as killer. I've tried restarting and the game and computer but nothing.
---
Was probable a mistake, sometimes reddit makes it seem like the post failed when it's actually just fine
---
I figured. Well it seems its only his shirt thats glitched because the rest of both their outfits are what they should be. I knew something was off the moment i saw jacket when it was a sweater
---
Also how the hell does it stay in his mouth when he‚Äôs getting stabbed, impalled, chainsawed, dead. Does he tape it to his lip?
---
I know, I'm making a joke "Foot age"= age of a foot
---
&gt; tbh if a killer face camps a hook(which i assume is what you're talking about) everyone else will escape and the killer will lose
---
Except this isn't what happens. If the survivors aren't in comms, every one of them has to step off a gen to go check on the survivor because they don't know why the survivor isn't getting unhooked. Even if they do know, that's enough time to get three gens done, not five, and that's assuming ruin isn't up. Now you have three survivors, and the killer gets another down. Do you leave as a survivor to check again that they're getting camped? If you don't, and the killer actually patrols this time around, you only really have one person working on gens and that's not going to get you out. But say killer stays at the hook, and you do get the last two gens done as the second survivor dies. Time to run to the door and suddenly you're one shot because surprise, you didn't have time to do dull totems and the killer has NOED. And a 3k.
---
Also, this all assumes that the survivors in the game decide to just do gens and be bored. Plenty of survivors would rather just get out of this game quickly by trying to rescue and ensuring the face camper gets a 0k, risking the death. That makes the math even harder to "just do five gens and get out." I also haven't even touched the subject of ivory and ebony moris, which in the hands of the majority of the killer player base would end up being an insta-rank up if kills guaranteed pips.
---
Now, I'm not saying having the rank system be the way to combat face camping is the best case scenario for us, as plenty of killers use it to their advantage when deranking. That being said, right now it's survivor's only defense against getting games like this over and over and over again. Until this game gets more ways in the base survivor kit to deal with camping and tunneling, the ranking system can't reward for just getting kills.
---
Honestly, maybe I just need to play more and get better.
---
I know how much it sucks when devs balance a game you play in a way to help the casual players or newcomers and actually hurt the way you, an experienced player who knows the mechanics and knows how to take advantage of them, play.
---
And I don‚Äôt wanna do the ‚Äúveterans‚Äù of this game dirty, because I know that would probably make them frustrated.
---
But then again, maybe there *is* a problem with gen rushing that needs to be fixed. I just feel like my opinion is biased.
---
Best way to play Myers right there! I get Merciless almost every game now with it. DR+Memorial, M&amp;A, STBFL, Ruin, BBQ. I'll sometimes switch out M&amp;A for thanataphobia if I've been running into a lot of sweaty survivors. I do the exact same strategy as you do though. I try to find my obsession first though after I've gotten tier 2 and I can just pop tier 3 so that I don't burn any STBFL stacks early on. That's also 2 less stacks that I'll lose overall and I only have to lose 4 total if I play it right.
---
Yes, it does. But the perk has a timer and when it runs out, you can no longer use it. So to avoid being slugged and having the killer wait out the timer, you can enter a locker. If he doesn't pull you out he:
---
a) wastes time
---
b) risks getting stunned with head-on
---
c) risks you getting healed with Inner Strength
---
and if he does pull you out, you can just use your decisive strike on him. So it's a lose-lose for the killer
---
I mean first impression is that Billy is still better because the saw is on demand and faster.
---
It‚Äôs not a killer game unless every survivor brings a different map offering and it gives you haddonfield
---
Woah. I absolutely need to put that back on the good boi then!
---
Yeah like the new pigs jacket only because it makes her look more like a survivor when crouched
---
They also tend to be the first to DC, in my experience.
---
Nice*
---
This is not a common occurrence by any means. And has happened on pc to me before, too.
---
The previous version of DS was super unbalanced
---
I just like all of her outfits tbh. Tapps too but for his newest one i was only interested in his sweater and pants
---
Thats fair. I also tend to be 10+, but only because I don‚Äôt play as often anymore :/
---
I think he's the most fun in the game when you can place your traps well and the survivors don't know
---
This is dank brother üòÇüê∏
---
Ah alright that makes sense, thank you
---
Cant they just... break a pallet
---
T H X  bro!! üëäüëäüëåü§™üî•
---
But where is the one about wanting to dropkick my pregnant wife? That was my favorite of all the messages I've gotten!
---
Sums up red ranks, survivors queues are so long that they're matched with lower ranks after a point. Not many killers want to bother with red ranks
---
Nah, you don't have to stop, you can trigger an attack during dash anytime. It's just not automatic but requires you to press M1 when you want to hit something. But there's no additional wind-up to it.
---
I've seen people try to run at me and bluff that they have DS. I pick them up and immediately know they are not happy I didn't fall for their bluff.  Honestly people do the I'm going to run at you and bluff a DS gambit. I won games from leaving a person who does have DS and I leave them slugged and hit everyone who rushed to pick them up only to down them then hook the expired DS user last. It's like Damn Bro that gambit just cost you the game. Then again I'm a killer who does not get bothered if people do run DS. I think it's fair to have with all the camping and tunneling killers that I've seen recently. I'm just saying the running at me when you don't have DS will cost you a hook and if I think you do have it I'm just going to use you as free bait.
---
No q&amp;q and the killer still went for it? RIP leatherface
---
Thank you this is exactly perfect and what I was looking for!

Dead by daylight n-word pass dlc now 4.99

Where is ‚Äúdumb ass gay ass killer you should kill your self you trash camper lmao‚Äù that‚Äôs literally a message I got one time.
---
its easier to nerf camping without nerfing killer(like increasing the first/second hook timer for example) than it is to balance killer rankings without making it "kill no matter the cost". tbh i really don't care too much. i ignore the ranking and play "kill as many people as possible no matter the cost" because thats what i find fun. i won't face camp unless the end game collapse is active because its boring as hell, but i will tunnel the shit outta you as getting one person dead asap helps me kill everyone
---
There was a lot of stalking done that day.
---
No, i wish he would have
---
Restart the game, worked for me.
---
Well, it's sort of a hard thing to explain and a "you had to be there." But me and my friend main Kate and Feng respectively, and we occasionally joke about how they are gay for each other. Well, one night we got a homophobic bill. So for whatever reason we just said bill was fengs dad and he was trying to clone her so he could get a straight daughter. Had this sent to me today from them and had a good laugh.
---
&gt; but i will tunnel the shit outta you as getting one person dead asap helps me kill everyone
---
And that's why the game won't reward you for just getting a kill, as it's super fucking easy to do that and snowball it into a 4k.
---
I appreciate you making my point for me.
---
Wow you're a very underrated artist, I absolutely love your art.
---
I genuinely didn't think you could. I remembered trying on the PTB but nothing happened. Well then, that makes it more useful for sure. Kinda excited to try it now.
---
As killer run ruin, it helps a lot, as survivor learn techniques like 360s and window tech, ot makes the game way more fun
---
My accounts fine although I haven't checked to see if I have anymore reports. I'm sure I do but I've mixed other games in so cant say if its solely dbd.
---
I guess it varies, ive been going floating between 6 and 3 for a bit now. Seems people prefer to work with guarantees and want atleast  2 kills, but i might also just be noticing it because i hate "exposed" and im looking out for it. Also im on PS4, if that changes anything.
---
So you're the guy who used to message me when I played as an Xbox killer saying i have bad internet? /s

Perk: "Sacrifices Must Be Made"

Description: "When another survivor unhooks you while the killer is within 6/7/8 meters from the hook, you can press the action button to kick the unhooker in the nuts and heal all health states from them. The unhooker imidiately goes into the dying state and you become healthy"
---
Wait a sec who was the killer and who was the survivor?
---
If i made it all the way to the gate and bloodwarden was up, i would have just dc'ed
---
*trips and ruptures kidney*
---
The age of man has ended. Prepare for the age of the foot.
---
Ds is probably the most used perk right now, even more used than self-care lmao. Definitely Not dead
---
well the game would obvs be balanced differently if it was end result based for killer. but its still easier to balance that than balance a broken ranking system
---
I can't wait to see his big dick in rule34
---
Honestly dude, the power is way too overtuned. Stalling killers like the doctor don't have strong map pressure for a reason. All survivors at madness 3 is the peak of the Doctor's stall potential, so adding invulnerable demogorgon portals to that is win-more at best and broken at worst. 
---
And maybe it's just me, but I don't see how the level 2 Laura bear-trap thing incorporates with the rest of his kit, and just seems to be there to rub salt in the wound.
---
Kinda of brought over legion? So anyone with a mask is from deathgarden now?
---
It cost you $0 to not post this so why did you
---
Thanks! I have all of these but noed. You think pop is worth running?
---
^^^fucking **MEG**
---
Don't disrespect trapper like that
---
where's all my feng skins
---
Lmao. Do people actually do that?!
---
I never thought about this crossover but, damn the theme is super fitting and I would love this.  Though the speed boost perk I could see being very painful on other already speedy killers.  
---
I also think the blood stains could turn into portals if you just stay in one spot too long and the blood pools up too much.  Like how Oni creates orb, if the pool gets too big cause you've been injured on a gen for 30 seconds, you get mangled or blinded.  Forcing you to move/get healed.
---
The game is generally getting better, not worse, but the devs are frequently tone-deaf, condescending, or outright irrational. Putting aside bugs the PTB should be catching, just recently we're looking at a Legion nerf that either didn't account for Nemesis, or didn't consider its effect nearly enough, and the planned removal of seeing teammate ranks in lobby and rotating Killers in custom games.
---
That's on top of standing issues, the least controversial to bring up I would say is their obsession with "the BP Economy," i.e. making the game grindier by denying large amounts of earned rewards, burying players with clutter, and keeping everything as difficult as possible for new players.
---
üëälove the content brother keep it up
---
I don't think new players deserve any more punishment on the BP front than they already get.
---
Well it all started when I was about 2 years old.
---
I think OP was the survivor. I can't think of what pallet camping could possibly be as a killer. Either way, though, this sounds stupid as hell.
---
Just bought ghostface and literally felt like this !
---
Nailed it
---
All I‚Äôm waiting for is the lawnmower killer.
---
I had the same problem when I tried, but I knew you could do that. For some reason I just kept forgetting and i'd cancel the dash instead...
---
Add Rick Sanchez to Dead By Daylight!!!
---
No, because it's just created a different grind, and with a ranked game, creates a lot of conflict with players trying to do the challenges, especially when the challenges can have their progress reset to 0.
---
The core concept of "if Rituals didn't suck" is nice, but the execution is mediocre.
---
Not complaining

The common way for a killer to avoid DS at all is to slug them and wait for the DS window to expire, so survivors counter this counter play by hiding in a locker, forcing the killer to either grab them (so DS will activate) or abandon the chase.
---
Please no more pallet stun shit.. Especially not for a colossal samurai who insta breaks pallets and has a perk which encourages getting stunned.
---
Can't wait for the "hope your family dies in a fire" chapter to come out
---
A little stamp might be nice because it would rat out derankers.
---
Borrowed time can proc more than once?
---
Spine chill meta...?
---
Also new dying light sucks ass, it's a worse perk overall, and now it also doesnt have synergy with remember me (which was also nerfed) which had so much synergy with Freddie's power.
---
Yep
---
Well, for one thing, there are no repercussions for disconnecting. Although we've been promised some Soon.
---
If it glows, it goes...
---
I've seen post on here of survivors who talk about faking they have it to get out of a jam. Like they have no pallet to run to so they try to bluff the killer into leaving them on the ground. Sometimes I'm just going to want to get a DS out of the game anyways. I love to see at the end of the game that they did not have DS and they literally handed me a free hook. Just saying that it's just as common they don't have DS and run at the killer and try to bluff it then they do have DS and run at the killer. It's a win,win for me. I'm getting your DS out of the game or a free hook. The funny thing about all that is that was not going to tunnel when they got unhook I'm one of those killers that will keep looking for the unhooker. Come on though. If you are going to run at me I'm not going to ignore you.
---
Jokes on you I want to be smashed by his mace
---
It was so much fun, it's so sad how almost that entire build has been erased, every addon and perk that was a part of it has been changed drastically
---
Looks like Dave Bautista
---
If you bought the game for the masks, and not to actually play the game.... that‚Äôs on you
---
Sadly true
---
I *highly* doubt the rank and level thing is a bug considering it's on all platforms and the UI design love lines up and doesn't overlap or conflict with anything. I think BHVR saw that people were dodging lobbies after they added it and are trying to cover their asses by calling it a bug.
---
Restarting the game fixes this
---
lol, yeah, the biggest salt I work up is typically "So just out of curiosity, how many of you are on the same SWF?"
---
What's the point in that
---
Played against a spirit the other day that absolutely destroyed two of my team members before a Gen had been popped. The other remaining remember was my friend and the map pressure was ridiculous and the ruin was nowhere to be found. So we decided to just run at the spirit and we spent the next couple of minutes trying to catch her and then farmed out the match. Was a good time
---
Trapper needs intelligence and not skill. Thats why he‚Äôs my main killer. (I suck at the mechanical skill killers)
---
Imagine wanting to play a game and someone wants to record themselves.  That is all well and good if you ask permission first, which most people do not.
---
Careful. Don't give the devs ideas. They might put a censor in the chat and then sell bypassing it.
---
Happens...happens a lot when it‚Äôs u playing
---
Can I get a pre-order on the ethnic slur season pass?
---
I have not received anything yet. There have been a few posts about this since yesterday with many saying the same thing.
---
It's just started for

If only it worked off of proximity instead of terror radius.
---
It used to be like that
---
Boop the snoot.
---
It so be like that
---
Pennywise, I‚Äôm 100% sure. Don‚Äôt @ me
---
Why would they change that?
---
Playing toxic is the punishment though. You‚Äôll either get tunneled or get ignored. If you play toxic, your objective is to get attention. Either way you‚Äôre not going to get what you want. You‚Äôre either going to get out of the game instantly (tunneled) or you don‚Äôt get a chase. Toxic play doesn‚Äôt really reward anyone for killer or survivor, but people do it because they‚Äôre toxic people. It‚Äôs just how they are.
---
I have no idea
---
Just read and saw my mistake sorry guys
---
back when brand new part was really good a long ass time ago
---
What movie is this from? Deadass thats Tachanka.
---
But that would waste 3 whole seconds!!!!
---
Obviously the best choice is to run around in a circle and let them vault it 27 times
---
I‚Äôm thinking the same thing
---
It may be a little late to the punch though since the second chapter has already came and gone out of theaters
---
Thanks man, I am going to farm more people now.
---
There is literally no dodging his charge

I‚Äòm a survivor main. I almost never play killer. lol
---
It's so infuriating. Claudette probably would've gotten out if David tried to block by healing her, but instead he just spins in place like some shitty bugged NPC... *and he just keeps going*.
---
It‚Äôs to flex hard on these survivors.
---
Me too. Shit real tho
---
Balanced wasn't highlighting bad map design, the maps weren't designed around a perk with an exploit built in so of course it made them worse to play for the killer, it was an exploit the devs didn't account for so the maps became significantly worse for it. Yes, Haddonfield is poorly designed, but on nearly every other map the loops the would be a nightmare with BL are perfectly manageable without it. That's how it was meant to be, it's not a highlight of poor map design because the maps become miserable to play because someone was using an exploit.
---
It's mostly just because it let's survivers enjoy the game a little more when facing the killers when they see them with different skins instead of all ways seeing the killer with that one skin every game.
---
Would I rather have alternative challenges that help me reduce the overall blood point grind or would I rather just stick with the broken rituals that disappear? Most challenges - oh wait all the challenges - are objective based. Leveling up faster &gt; leveling up slower
---
Pallet camper u!!!
---
Feelsbad but I think if they did it would be difficult to do since Pennywise is a celestial entity like the entity so that may be weird to work with
---
you're joking right?
---
He's shite, but I still love playing my Bubba boi
---
*Laughs in Rank 4 Killer* 
---
I remember when I was this young
---
Adding onto this: watching your gameplay, you aim too high to actually hit survivors with your puke, try and put them in the center of your screen and just aim up as they get further
---
This is just üëå
---
I got called a tunneler on a 4k specifically by a Steve after I caught him trying to be immersed while injured while chasing a David which was after I slugged him because he ran into me while I was carrying someone. Love your chart though it's still accurate.
---
Frankly, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever get to rank 4 at this point lmao. My matches are all so terrible
---
TTV survs tend to be dickheads in order to entertain their &lt;&lt;audience&gt;&gt;. If they think I am a clown, how about I give 'em a little performance too eh?
---
Yeah that was a bug way back in the day too what is dbd mobile like anyways?
---
Pallet campimg is what you do when instead of playing loops you just drop one palet, run to the next one, and wait the killer just in the palet, dropping it again and repeat. Some killers will just sacrifice a couple of gens but your team will run out of pallets, so the end game for the killer is just W+M1 while survivor cant do anything.
---
Bubba boi time

---
Specs: i7 8750H , Geforce GTX 1060 6GB, RAM 16GB DDR4, game storaged in SSD
---
I've been thinking this myself for a while
---
For the first 3 months I owned the game it wouldnt even ket me press space, I had to press enter.  Being able to press space is such a luxury Ill never forget now.
---
Our lord &amp; savour
---
Damnit Ed!
---
He at least has to build it up and can't spam it like hillbilly
---
My mans straight up looking like an Uruk
---
Exactly! Oni has to build it up
---
Whait for the next chapter coming December 3rd. Legion will be changed and also new perks are coming. Right now we have the ptb but we need to see the final patch notes.
---
Hillbilly is better at overall map control and pressure however
---
Accurate.
---
Don‚Äôt even worry about it, honestly. Worry about enjoying the game and learning, finding the killer that suits your style. Ranking up comes with practice and time. The more you play the more you‚Äôll see how survivors move and think. Soon you‚Äôll learn how to predict them and out think them. There is a lot more pressure on you than on the survivors, for sure, but as long as you try to get a hook before the first gen pops you‚Äôll usually be okay. 
---
Even if you get salty messages, don‚Äôt let it get to you. You can learn something new from every game.
---
I mean, if you pay full price for a game, you probably paid for the game itself and not for an unlockable in another game?
---
Lol didnt even notice the Myers at first
---
Don't forget the tongue
---
Why would I be? You literally have to hope he misses or sucks. People with 3000+ hours share this opinion. There is no dodging the ability. If you do, he just charges up again and catches you 2 seconds later.
---
My second game ever playing as legion and a toxic Kate kept harassing me. I matched with her the next two games and I dedicated myself to making sure she died even if everyone else escaped.
---
Maybe you could make an argument for teaming, but beyond that, neither of them did nothing wrong according to what BHVR lists as reportable offenses.
---
[‚ÄúWhat must be done.‚Äù](https://youtu.be/zpOULjyy-n8)
---
Yeah DBD and TF2 don't have a learning curve, they have a learning cliff. The change of pace from simple fun games to being demolished is so steep it really catches you unprepared.
---
If you really, REALLY want them to be, I guess?
---
I would use legion more often but he‚Äôs so shit. You cant have fun if your getting curbstomped everytime you use a weaker killer.
---
I‚Äôm not opposed to him having a good power, i‚Äôm opposed to the counterplay being nearly non-existent. Your best bet is to jump into a locker so he wastes his power end can‚Äôt down the rest of your teammates. That‚Äôs not very intuitive if you ask me. Or fun.
---
It's just best to ignore ppl like them. They are trying to bait u to reply and get under your skin. They sound like a moron lol
---
it‚Äôs not my opinion. it‚Äôs literally just the definition of these words. lol
---
I don‚Äôt worry about salty messages. Nobody can send me one unless they‚Äôre in my friend‚Äôs list.
---
I‚Äôm genuinely glad to see a lot of people had the same issue I‚Äôm currently having.
---
As I said before, I don‚Äôt wanna give up on this game yet because the core gameplay loop is still fun to me, and I personally have a blast maining Ghostface and using Legion occasionally just because he‚Äôs so edgy. However, it is still really frustrating. I need to learn how to not let it get to me.
---
So make him more like billy but even slower? Lmao what
---
My ten minutes of playtime in Deathgarden would disagree with you\~
---
You‚Äôd imagine that in a game where you play as a serial killer against 4 unarmed survivors the killer would be the one fucking the other players in the ass at least a little bit more easily.
---
Oh boy was I wrong.
---
I know what it looks like and I know what it's like to be a survivor and have this killer with a crazy looking cosmetic come at you
---
I honestly want these. Yes. These are 100000% perfect
---
I get what you're saying, but most of The Keeper's abilities are contingent upon tokens. His teleport is limited to five locations, and he has to manually place the safes down ahead of time. The Madness effect is also less powerful that Doctor's. I'm heavily in favor of a Doctor buff BTW.
---
Now jerk it off
---
I see no reason to farm with a survivor unless like everyone DCed and I need the BPs. My job is to kill you, not to be cute and friendly. NO MERCY.
---
She‚Äôs there, even in spirit
---
Safe head as I like to call him can go to hell. Both him and Laura (bloodied chick who can teleport with blood and has walks on all four) are the reasons I'm always paranoid on Evil Within. Third being "ANIMA"
---
legion trenchcoat skins when
---
If you think DS was balanced and now its dead I don't know what to say.
---
I think personally some of them look cool and add more of an intimidation factor to some survivors
---
They could give him so many kinds of Jamaican or professor themed outfits too. Having mained him since his release, it's annoying seeing literally everyone else both older and newer than him get more stuff.
---
Great feedback! I'll make some adjustments. Check back soon!
---
I love slugging peeps

Platform: ALL

Type of bug: Visual

Description:
---
FIX the damn Ghostface new cosmetic having his robe texture stuck to his knife.
---
There are people that pay $800 (or more) for a skin. I wouldn't be so sure.
---
I honestly can't wait for the doctor rework. Shit is gonna get wacky.
---
How do we know you‚Äôre really him?
---
But the franchise is literally called The Evil Within, and [EXTREMELY MINOR SPOILER] the name of the last chapter of the first game is the game's title.
---
I actually thought it was an intentional joke.
---
&gt; A comfortable jacket to spend free time or chase down pigs in the slaughter bin.
---
Pig is a slang term for a police officer, and Amanda is an actual pig, so if they're chasing each other, it makes sense.
---
I believe I read you are rank 16, yes? If so, boy you haven't seen anything yet. The higher you go the more you will understand why everyone played Nurse and Billy back in the day or whatever the fuck they play now. Survivors only become more and more spoiled little brats who are toxic on purpose and rely on cheap meta second chance perks and their SWF friends. Even if you kill them just the whole experience of having to deal with people treating you like a clown every single match is seriously draining and reeeeeaaally takes away the fun of the game.
---
I love it XD
---
I dissagree can 360 him just like any other killer his hit isn't wide just long and windows/good jungle gyms can easily dodge him speeding at u in a chase unless your literally shit tier rank which at that point u will be facing just as bad tier oni's.
---
Yeah thats what i mean It all made perfect sense until the jacket it just bothers me because hes wearing a sweater literally just change jacket to sweater for his its perfect
---
Good point we need answers
---
Anyone who has played demigorgon and not watched the show
---
Noice.
---
It‚Äôs kinda like Dante‚Äôs Inferno, the deeper you go the more nightmare-ish the thing gets
---
I don‚Äôt wanna blame people for the way they play too much though (I admittedly do sometimes) because at the end they‚Äôre just trying to win, and that‚Äôs kind of the same mindset I‚Äôve had
---
I thought it was a feature got the game on xbox one been seeing it since I got it
---
Pig player thinks you tried to be toxic and rat out the Nea. (Which you did). She doesn‚Äôt understand the reason you did it. So she tried to punish what she thought was a toxic player.
---
It‚Äôs one of those cases where the killer only sees one side of the story.
---
Either way it was excessive. Who can be bothered dragging the game out that long?
---
Doctor or Plague tbh
---
They need to just leave seeing rank. It should be a feature
---
A "fix".
---
Last night I got a 4k with huntress running nurses calling, devour hope, haunted grounds and bbq. The last guy was the only one i killed with devour hope so I just did it for fun and there was no tactical advantage. When I said gg the guy goes " no gg, never with a mori is it gg it's weak to use one." So I went in his stream chat and said to learn the difference between a mori and devour hope. Banned immediately of course. Then he proceeded to say he doesn't know all the stupid killer mechanics but then also how huntress is the easiest killer. How is it that they claim to know what is easiest killer but obviously never play killer? It's kind of like they say whatever angry shut comes to mind without knowing anything.
---
This is not a roleplaying game
---
I've gotten called a camper in games where I get all my devour hope stacks so that's impossible. I don't even "patrol" the hook when I have devour hope because I'm afraid I'll step in the radius of it to not activate.
---
Wait, the Meg mask is still obtainable even if the game is free? Dude!
---
poink
---
So thats what it is. Seen it happen on streams and it happened to me once as well. Its been in a while then.
---
I‚Äôd submit a report ticket.
---
God I fucking hate the doctor feels like such shit though I never disconnect.
---
Maybe they could do a legion thing but a survivor because I really like the designs of all the scavengers.
---
When I saw Legion's "devil may care" knife, I bought it instantly because I'm a huge fan of Devil May Cry [the 3rd one will always be my favourite]. Little things like that which make me want to support the game more.
---
maybe at the start of the trial where Oni literally has no power, but you can definitely have more control and pressure as Oni with a single Demon Dash than you can with Hillbilly w/ multiple chainsaw sprints with spiked boots and moonshine add-ons. Not to even mention how bad Hillbilly becomes on indoor maps or within tight areas, Oni can drift around virtually any loop in the game and doesn't have a bump penalty.
---
Not so much a "classic" but
---
Mandy from Billy &amp; Mandy would be an honest to god terrifying killer.
---
Is holding a game hostage not an offense? Do you know where all the bannable offenses are listed maybe?
---
Can‚Äôt wait for the survivors to whine that oni is op and then he gets nerfed so hard they build him his own grave

BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY
---
The making sure dying not dying on first hook is so bs as a killer u have no control over that,if u get a bunch of solo survivors who don't give a fuck and dont save people cause they will just aim to get hatch. They def need to fix ranking period, killers should be seperate between the character's can be a god awful nurse and a good trapper. Hard for players especially semi newer ones who hit purple using a killer  and decide they want to learn others.
---
Having just started recently running the know Mither generator builds I understand this pain
---
?? His design and perk encourages getting stunned bruh
---
I just like his aesthetic and his power. He's one of the better designed killer imo despite being a "Jason ripoff". I think his swole build also appeal to me in... other ways.
---
So? He‚Äôs a potato.
---
I play both survivor (solo) and killer i have maybe run into one salty killer in endgame chat over many games but if I play 4 games of killer in a night at least 1 will always be shit talkers and that's win or lose. Salty survivors also will say I lose if I didn't get all 4.
---
Silly survivor you pressed the stare at pallet button
---
In the game Left 4 Dead, his cigarette also never goes out, even after being covered with puke and blood. It only goes out when he dies ;-;
---
I personally don‚Äôt have the luxury of lobby dodging because queues are so bad.
---
ur right so i downvoted myself just to support the cause
---
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not
---
For what audience? The game flopped MULTIPLE times in under a year to the point that it's completely been abandoned. Who does this chapter appeal to, the 10 people who played it?
---
It's also just dudes with guns. This is a horror game and until now we've at least stuck to core icons and archetypes of horror. Adding "random dude with a gun" from ~~the hunger games~~ Deathgarden would contribute nothing to that besides the fact that it would be cheap to implement.
---
We got masks from it, that's more than enough for me, just let it die rather than wasting 3 months of content on it.
---
It's deathgarden masks, not legion masks
---
CAN'T WAKE UP

It is like that

I bought a pig and Myers outfit a) because I‚Äôm a pig and Myers main, b) because it makes pig more stealthy and c) I mean myers in a gown with a pipe how could I not
---
It‚Äôs actually hard to aim his charge, in the ptb pro players have a hard time trying to hit it
---
Dead by Daylight is a game where you have to keep playing to get better. It can be extremely frustrating, trust me, and it‚Äôs a game that constantly changes so when you think you get everything down, a perk is nerfed or buffed or an item is added that changes the meta of the game so you have to adapt to it. Honestly, for the longest time I was stuck at Rank 15, it seemed like I couldn‚Äôt get better. Watching some videos, practicing with friends and definitely just playing the game helped get over the curve though. My advice is to play both sides though, there are things you can pick up from both a survivor and a killer that will give you insight into both. If you lose a game, don‚Äôt let it get you down either. You‚Äôll always have good games and bad games, but the important thing is you‚Äôre trying your best to get better.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt think about moris
---
fortnite burger
---
I don't think his dash is the issue people have, I think it's the 180 degree flick he can do at the end of it
---
find it pointless but I do have blight spirit only beacuse shes my favorite other than that only the weapons are worth it
---
They both can tbag survivors
---
You get me ;)
---
Someone waiting on me to die so she can escape isn't someone that is on my team in my book. I would have been fine if the pig would have killed me on the spot I just wanted out of the game. What I expected was the pig to just kill both of us tbh.
---
Can you tell me if what I did is wrong in your opinion? I know sandbagging is a shitty thing most of the time. I honestly just want honesty. If Im actually the bad guy then so be it and I'll just DC the next time the last survivor is waiting on me to die and reward them with the hatch because thats the game were playing I guess.
---
Wtf? Is this a glitch or do you have a problem?
---
Like fornite
---
Buffing the strongest role is needed?
---
you like forn tite?

Yeah well I hate it so much i beat the second game on "Classic Difficulty" and months later and I'm still traumatized lol.

He has a big stun, just like hillbilly, so I don‚Äôt get how ‚Äúhe charges up again and catches u‚Äù applies when his thing is literally harder to aim as well
---
So true
---
Which wouldn't be happening in the first place if the matchmaking wasn't so dogshit.
---
That‚Äôs some good advice.
---
I would practice with friends but none of mine have the game, so I‚Äôm pretty much stuck playing solo.
---
I wanna play survivor more often to see what it feels like, though.
---
I‚Äôm currently watching a video from Tofu (don‚Äôt know if you like him at all) and I‚Äôm learning just a little bit, but his advices are more targeted at a higher rank playerbase, not me.
---
man dbd sure has looked different since that last update.
---
Freddy is the new Huntress. Nothing to see here.
---
I watched the whole thing. Existential crisis confirmed
---
That's like saying why buy cool looking clothes for yourself since you don't really see them much unless you look down. I think it's cool will killers have cool skins as a survivor so it feels good to have cool skins as a killer too.
---
Just bring unnerving presence
---
Wtf
---
ngl I wish end game screen looked like that by default
---
haha sex number lolol XD updoots to the left Keanu Reeves wholesome 100

I hate that she is my highest survivor lol. Had to get her high enough for empathy and botany to get through some of those survivor rifts without specifically using her.

Now I'm back to raising my man chonky jesus Jeff

---
Gen rushing? You mean them doing their sole objective? And 2 kills a game is what the devs consider ideal. 4ks are rare dont expect them often.
---
I think tokens should reset after the Madness ends so he has to work back up to it. It'd just be frustrating to instantly be put into Madness three every unhook
---
 You cannot compare widely celebrated festive events with this SJW cringe rubbish.
---
So no one going to talk about how sleek Mikey looks in that casual shirt and jeans?
---
Can u make one where Oni gets rid of legion? The comics are sooooo amazing!!!
---
I‚Äôve never understood why people face camp unless they really don‚Äôt think they will catch them again but to me getting pressure out on everyone and gens is way more important than getting just one kill I‚Äôd rather take the loss knowing I tried in a decent way to win.
---
Yea? No one wants to be in a match with teammates who are drastically worse than them.
---
üòÇ ffs
---
I can always imagine that those things are surface level damage, but after seeing what happens when a musket ball hits a body, it is hard to picture it any other way. Oh well, this one is on me I guess.
---
If those are the 2 options just stay on gen. There‚Äôs a high chance the level 2 will go running for Ruin.
---
So true :)
---
That would work.
---
It's only a flesh wound!
---
Didn‚Äôt know what devs considered ‚Äúideal‚Äù, really.
---
I come from a completely different gaming background, where you were good if you got the highest number of kills in a match, and that pretty much shaped my current DbD mindset, even though it‚Äôs not the one I should have.
---

---
This. I got into an argument with a Claudett and I said a more cruel version of this and shut her up. I hooked a survivor, saw her, chased her as she unhooked the survivor. I downed the survivor and then her where she killed herself on hook and said she refuses to play with a Tunneler...
---
It's arguably more powerful now since there's zero counterplay other than slugging someone.
---
I originally had that, but then I thought, "Is madness really that big of a nuisance? Survivors can just snap out of it in a few seconds." So, it's basically just a time-waster.
---
My pick was Ghostface and I had an absolute blast just sneaking around, doing gen grabs and kind of jumpscaring people. You don‚Äôt know how much I loved playing as him back then.
---
It‚Äôs still my main, but I‚Äôm starting to believe it‚Äôs not the killer I should use if I wanna deal with ‚Äúgen rushing‚Äù, or maybe I need to level Ghostface up even further. He‚Äôs my highest level killer but he‚Äôs still at just level 27
---
Don't forget about Toxic aka teenage version
---
I've experienced this
---
No it isn't. If 4ks were average surv would be even more miserable. Have you played survivor? You should, you'll understand better if you play both.
---
Its not just DBD. I believe even the MOVIES THEMSELVES stopped using the mask, because of licensing. At least, thats what I heard.
---
Otz on YouTube and twitch is good as well
---
Love your username btw

Go big brain and trap the locker.

10 iq plays sometimes cause 15 iq responses :)

Honestly, I‚Äôve only played like 2 or 3 matches as survivor. I intended to play more, but after I was done with a match as a killer I always thought, whether my match went poorly or not, ‚ÄúI love playing as killer. I‚Äôll do it again‚Äù so I pretty much always skip playing surv.
---
BHVR needs to make some big changes to the game if we're down to blatantly copying other killer's powers, but making it a lil different so the teacher (consumer) doesn't notice.
---
I kinda just watch a bunch of streamers
---
2v6 mode coming soon :0
---
I buy them so survivors have something nice to look at playing against me, I'm not kidding! Often I play friendly killer, or just a chill fair game, and in the chat they go "Wow , you're such a pretty Nurse" and it just feels so nice :D
---
Thanks for sharing but it seems like members of the forum are just speculating what could be categorized as bannable offenses in that post.
---
I remember seeing an actual list somewhere sometime. But it's been a while ago and it probably isn't accurate anymore today if I would even find it right now.
---
There also isn't a way to report people with forms anymore or through mods is there? Just the ingame report system which feels more like a placebo.
---
They really need to make a change that disables certain perks from being used when you have more than one survivor in the party. DS is really only a problem in SWF groups where they can actually capitalize on the time bought by the perk.

What's a n**a
---
BT seems pretty useless on console atm, the timer's gone down immediately after getting hit so you get hit and have to immediately heal or go down anyways. Mend timer also seems to only last like 5 seconds or so, though that might just be my panic when that happens

Thai so really good.
---
TrU3Ta1ent often runs good builds that work well. Although he's a crybaby he's quite interesting to learn tactics from.
---
The demogorgon is otherwordly too.
---
Yup, pretty sure that's the implication of the other guy.
---
I mean, it just sounds like something a new player would do rather than someone who's trolling or trying to break the game. 
---
I know I would often throw down every pallet I came across in a chase when I was new because I didn't know any strategy, or how stupid that was to do.
---
i be gamiiiiiiing
---
Yeah, but why drop it at all? If bloodlust is unnecessary it should just be removed. Or make it a perk with slightly reduced numbers if you REALLY want it to exist. Bloodlust is just a bandaid for poor maps though, so I think it should be gone once they fix maps.
---
Run to a locker. They either have to sit there and wait out the DS or grab you out and eat it. Either way it's better than being slugged and making Thanataphobia give extra penality.
---
**Entity**: Whom do you serve?
---
"The Giggling Guardian" on Classic mode gave me anxiety. Thank God you can run away from every encounter but still *shudders* hearing the stomping as she runs behind you is the worst.
---
Stop, this is trash
---
Dont waste time. Do gens
---
Are we gonna get a release date for the 12 year old on Xbox live dlc
---
for the worse...
---
It helps a lot to understand their POV and also improve your performance as killer. You get a feel for where they hide or their path finding, or what works and what doesn't as a killer.
---
It does make sense.
---
There are apps in your phones app store. The one I use has a encyclopedia about everything .......and a Skill Check trainer. I use it often for perk ideas and use the skill check trainer when I'm waiting in the lobby. I hit great skill checks all the time now.
---
Well, I was, but I was hoping to rescue.  I tried to see for an opening, but that Legion was LOCKED onto that hook.
---
In what sense lol
---
That‚Äôs still weird dude. I play on xbox and I‚Äôve never seen NOED above rank 12. It‚Äôs much better to take a perk that‚Äôs guaranteed to help you throughout the map than it is to take a perk that might help you after you‚Äôve almost lost the game already if the survivors didn‚Äôt counter it. I‚Äôve never heard of a place where NOED is in the high level meta before. I kinda think you‚Äôre lying, because you didn‚Äôt describe the meta properly and mr Meyers is not nearly as common as spirit or billy at high rank anywhere.
---
Also i love the concept. I love good I'm Sebastian Castellanos.
---
I simultaneously love and hate that, but I‚Äôm proud of you nonetheless
---
So good
---
I want the Terminator.
---
The fun part of it is to figure out which perks fit into the particular build you're trying to make. You have to start by deciding what the overall goal of your build is first.
---
If you want to keep people injured, you might run Sloppy Butcher with Nurse's calling. If you want to keep track of survivors, run things like BBQ and Bitter Murmur. If you want to slow gen progress, use ruin/discordance/surveillance.
---
Right now the meta focuses on slowing gen progress, so try and unlock perks that help you patrol gens and control them. My advice would be to leave one slot for a "quality of life" perk. Something that makes up for one of your weaknesses as a new killer. Usually  this will be a chase perk like Endurance or Bamboozle.
---
Fits with the name!!
---
Yeah and the emblems often consider 2 kills a loss. And gen rushing is literally exactly like tunneling. It's not an invalid tactic, but it's fucking boring and annoying to play against, ignoring healing, totems, unhooks, everything just to get gens done results in no points or fun at all for any of the players.
---
Very
---
He's annoying.
---
Cursed
---
It used to. But was a one time use per match. The new changes are very well done IMO
---
real hyped up how about other dbd gamers!!?
---
I had one yesterday where the killer carried my friend to the hatch to mori them and I was standing on it where he couldn't see me. Turned around right after the mori animation just to watch me jump in.
---
We all play like assholes. I'm just surprised it's still so talked about. A surv is always gonna take it personal when someone murders them, and a killer is gonna take it personal when survivors run circles on them. Frustration is understandable on both sides.
---
Reminds me of ps1 hagrid
---
Alien would be sick
---
The new perks along with them look very interesting also ü§î
---
The point of my comment is that a rank 20 wouldn‚Äôt understand No Mither, therefore proving how little you know about the game
---
probably swap IM for pop
---
There is a Youtuber named int3ract. He makes videos based on all killers, how to play them, the best perks for them, etc. I think his videos will definitely help you out
---
BNP?
---
nothing much, what's a n\*\*a with you
---
Ruin Hag.
---
Brand New Part
---
Lol I got a "you're lucky these teammates were noobs, gg lucky killer" but he was the worst one and died instantly to my hatchets so when I called him out and said that "I hoped his dick was longer than the distance covered during the chase because 5cms aren't impressive", he just quit. Feels nice to play killer once in a while.
---
liking the japanese style 9/10üëåüëå oni all round 10/10 killer, survivor maybe 9/10 feling good about it
---
This is why I'm the guy who brings Small Game and gets ruin for the survivors who just can't put down one meta perk for Small Game. I got so sick of seeing DCs because of people hating Ruin. That so common to DC because Ruin that I feel I have to run Small Game so I'm not stuck in 3 man games.......  Also I have not been downed by a NOED in months and I get mad when I read about people complaining on Reddit about not wanting to cleans totems and get killed by NOED. I run Empathy,WAGLF, SG and exhausting perk. I hit red ranks in solo constantly. Please guys give Small Game a chance. You will find Ruin fast and get a shit ton of points cleansing totems and stop NOED in it's tracks. I wish more would run it way underated and the best team helping perk in the game.  All the people who bring SG understand what I'm talking about. Thankless job.
---
yeah you would've gotten blinded, but why didn't you break the pallet?
---
Stfu BOOMER!
---
Unbalanced Landing
---
Some people care more about trying to save their mates than winning the game. Whatever's more fun for them. I can't complain, it's free kills.
---
Why are half of these blank?
---
It used to only be once per match.  Patch 1.9.2 changed that.
---
Forgot 'gg piece of shit'
---
This warms my survivor main heart and pleases my sense of justice,good job dude
---
He's a nice guy, but when it comes to dbd I just don't take him seriously anymore. I got 2500 hours in the game, nothing he says makes any sense anymore to me. I just shudder everytime I watch him play cause he just wastes pallets as survivor doesn't even bother to loop it, and then mind games himself as killer while blaming perks the survivors don't even have. It's a bummer really.
---
Id just hooked a survivor once and thier injured teammate went for tye save right as i backed up. So i downed the 2nd survivor and they crawled under their hooked teammate to where i couldnt grab them (on the doctor map middle hook) i tried from all angles but couldnt grab them so they probably thought they were pretty big brain....untill i didnt leave the area i was willing to sit there and wait since one of them had a shorter timer to die after a bit they gave up on the idea and crawled out. After i picked them up and took em to a hook the other guy got unhooked so i had a person dying and 2 people not doing gens and it felt nice
---
I dunno, honestly. I feel like the Devs are running out of ideas for perks and killer powers, powers especially (meanwhile, the community has churned out dozens of brilliant ideas).
---
Same
---
Console player woes...
---
Eh, it happens so rarely past brown ranks if you're not playing like an ass that I don't think BHVR considers it a problem. And luckily for brown rank players, it only takes 3-4 pips to rank up so dying on first hook isn't as much of an issue.
---
Your here for the memes. You should be enjoying this
---
I once got accused of "Gen Camping" because they put themselves into a 3-gen and i kept sneaking up on them as ghostface XD
---
dead on m8
---
Arent they saying the next update should fix MoM?
---
Honestly couldn‚Äôt have said it better let‚Äôs just see how the game plays out though
---
4 DS borrowed and adrenaline is just disgusting honestly, at least give the killer bonus BP for his troubles lol
---
There's a nice article I read that labels what is and isn't toxic, and it said tunneling and camping aren't toxic, let alone gen rushing or getting 4ks with skill. It's literally a killer's objective to kill a survivor, by any means necessary. If I get camped, great! That's so much time my teammates can spend doing gens. I get genrushed? Amazing! Gg survivors, great map awareness, evasion and immersion. They just can't accept that they got rekt so they instantly go TOXEKK like sis no it ain't it, sit back down and beg for 1$ tips
---
It's not a meme, it's a picture of a screen with no template, joke, or anything close to funny in it
---
Wait until it gets nerfed too
---
Menacing
---
Not gonna lie I thought she was Nancy level flat
---
Omg I hate Irish accents and I'm so sorry but idk why it's just acid to my ears. His is too much to handle.
---
Because it used to be a one-time only thing.  They then adjusted it so it can be used multiple times per match but the requirements are a bit tighter.
---
Great ideas! And thanks for the feedback. I implemented you suggestion ;)
---
It is
---
I want to say they originally had that issue w the TV series on MTV, but the movies should still be in the clear to my understanding.
---
Meg with adrenaline and sprint Burst. Quick and quiet isn‚Äôt bad either. 
---
Also new isn‚Äôt bad.
---
‚ÄúFookin potateoh‚Äù

That‚Äôs his whole stream.

Haha true but omg I'm probably way worse I'm so bad at looping, I'm still relatively new with around 230 hours I guess, can't seem to get the hang of the mechanics hehe
---
You forgot "Were you mori'd after someone farmed you?"

---
You can end a match in a legit way in 2 ways: dying or escaping.
---
I can't die because the pig keeps downing me and running with me without hooking me.
---
I can't escape because the pig keeps downing me and running with me without hooking me.
---
The only way I would have been able to leave that match is if I would have clicked leave game.
---
Sure eventually I got to bleed out but it was not in my controll. That was when the pig and nea decided I was allowed to leave. What does it take before it's called a hostage situation for you?
---
You say neither side but it's not about both sides it's about me not being able to get out of the game other then if I would have just DCed.
---
If a wraith body blocks you in a corner for an hour and then moves out of the way after that hour does that take away that it was a hostage situation as he let you go eventually?

Trap next to hex totems/hooked Survivors, when you get notified teleport and grab them off the totem or smack the rescuer.

Oh right, whichever. Kind of stopped watching Scream after Scream 17
---
What's sad is that he was "promoting less toxic behaviour" for the game. I thought he was legit from Behaviour or something, turns out he was just tryna get cred on Twitch to get an extra buck or two and come off as the "peaceful" player but he's every bit as toxic as the next dbd player.
---
Finally eating not only the face. :))

This whole survivor complaining about op killers thing is so stupid, nurse/spirit got nerfed because THEY WERE op.
