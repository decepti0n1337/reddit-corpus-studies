Start where your comfortable and then slowly increase it until its maxed, faster turn rate in ANY game is beneficial. Once at 100 you'll wish it could go higher.

Even if they are just intermediate in skill, having 3 throws of a long range instant down attack is enough to call her at least close to, if not S tier.
---
Oh nvm just found out greenmangaming has 30% discount for all dlcs atm :D

Tunneling is just doing the objective efficiently, it's the killer's version of gen rush.

I agree with this, Freddy is really good with add ons but still not comparable to other killers though
---
Imagine coming back from a few months break from dbd and you're a killer main and you go into a game with the cannibal and his bitch ass starts humming üòÇ
---
Meg is absolutely a lesbian. Agreed 100%, and Dwight is a bi icon.
---
NOED is annoying and balanced but I have to blame my failures on something other than myself. /s
---
Freddy usually wrecks my ass 9 times out of 10. But then again, I'm shit rank.

Ok but how about huntress with the clowns laugh

Me. She‚Äôs strong, ive got her p3, but her strength is entirely dependent on the framerate

We can agree that more than one killer is OP 
---
I don't remember the name but definitely the purple one (I think it's a Frank one). If I'm desperate enough for BP to play killer I play him. I suck but I'm hot so it's okay, lol.
---
But his 2nd slashes don't do much if he's in his frenzy mode
---
I honestly don't think it's that good on anybody but Doc combined with other terror radius perks/addons/shenanigans. Can't recall the last time it actually screwed me over as a survivor when it was a non-Doc killer.
---
Some of them just wait till you get close and leave. They should leave of their own accord, not force someone to have to force them out.
---
OH NO, BEING EFFICIENT? ANYTHING BUT THAT!
---
Someone can explain to me why she didnt use ds? She was exhausted? Or why didnt she escape?
---
Gen rushing is the equivalent to tunneling. If you‚Äôre ok with one you have to be ok with other, and I‚Äôm fine with both. In both scenarios you are quickly ending your opponents game to make victory easier for you. It‚Äôs literally two sides of the same coin
---
So we just need more money...
---
Reality:
---
‚ÄúKYS noob tunneling killer‚Äù 
---
My unpopular opinion is that "gen rushing" has never actually been a complaint toward survivors, and that the phrase is mostly used to undermine killer's complaints toward BHVR with how fast matches can end. 
---
well fuck that artist's drag
---
Doesn't it still work on gens but with the original values? The 3/6/9% is for gens still but the 15/20/25% is for healing 
---
Very true just one of his many drawbacks plus if they are playing properly against him they will hide as soon as his song starts playing I‚Äôve never lost to someone playing as Freddy but I play as him a bunch also so all you really have to do is take hims seriously like any other killer and he will have a hard time treat him like a joke and the jokes on you 
---
Agree. That was a solid piece of survivor play and not done in a toxic manner either. I feel his pain but at that point in the game it was certainly something that can be recovered from. No worse than a flashlight blind or a DS.
---
It's only ever a complaint toward BHVR with how fast matches can end against a coordinated group, it's almost never directed toward survivors. It's a strawman. 
---
At the end of this video, somewhere, a child smiled, and knew that everything is going to be alright.

In frenzy he can‚Äôt down, he only applies deep wound which starts a bleed out timer that doesn‚Äôt go down while being chased, and is relatively easy to self heal (you don‚Äôt even need self heal) and if you hit someone who already has deep wound you get stunned so hitting twice just drops the timer a little. He is really good at getting the first hit but can‚Äôt down. He is mid tier at best, but not even close to OP.
---

It would help if, you know, Wraith's outline wasn't visible when he moves while cloaked. Even that one ultra-rare add-on he has is made moot if the survivors have working eyeballs.
---
Nurse, then billy, then opinions vary, but any killer will tell you legion isn‚Äôt op. Want to know why? Because they actually know how he works and his ability which you stated you don‚Äôt even know. Legion isn‚Äôt op, you‚Äôre just bad. Let me guess, is Freddy op too?

I'm sorry, but a good nurse will rek survivors far harder than legion ever could
---
... There are other girl gamers in this game?

Oh boy, 600BP!!! Thank you mister!
---
Def not bannable but it is annoying being camped at the very end of the game and as for being "tunneled" it's super fucking annoying to be actually tunneled (doesn't help that BHVR has made perks to promote tunneling) but from what you're saying you're not doing that they're just unlucky 
---
Why am I downvoted and you're upvoted lol
---
God it's like stepping on thin ice around here
---
Dwearder was originally a shaved head which was for some unknown reason changed with 2.0 and returned back to the original look recently. It's better this way.
---
Well generally I refer to a killer as tunnelling when I believe they are intentionally trying to down and re-hook the same survivor they have hooked - and has just been unhooked. 
---
What you are describing is not really tunnelling is it? 
---
Let's say you hooked a survivor and went off patrolling gens, during which time said survivor has been unhooked and gotten away from hook safely and got back in the game. If the next survivor you happen to find is the same survivor you hooked previously, that is not tunnelling. You have not tunnelled them. Equally, if you stumble across two survivors, one of which you have hooked previously, and choose to go after the one you have already hooked, in the same respect, I can't really call that tunnelling either.
---
What do you mean ironic
---
Can be avoided by healing.
---
Agree with the last one not sure about the rest but I'm fine with ds, not sure what noed is

That's how mafia works.

---
The fanarts are gonna be drawing themselves.
---
There's a huge fanbase for DBD among East Asian women who draw a majority of the fanart that gets reposted around here
---
What ? Lag switching is the connection to the killer . You'll be jumping around , randomly teleporting or random things happening to you.  Like you running and immediately put on hook.  This looks like just low frame like your system is having a rough time playing it . It its pc just restart, if its console, try and restart but may be uhhhhh optimization problem. 
---
That is not a lag switch.
---
More pugs need to run this - I try to run it half the time.  Tremendous value when you don't have voice comms, and can often be the difference of an entire gen being done.  Plus if you have rank 3, you can give your teammates and idea of the direction the killer is headed. 
---
Its always a skill check. She had no skill
---
It helps them find hex totems faster too.
---
Shadowborn, 100% sensitivity and trying to improve your spacial awareness mid blink (on console our sensitivity mid blink is much reduced, that was a bug fixed on M&amp;K, but controllers still suffer with it) as much as you can are my biggest tips for you. Is Nurse on console easy? No, it's not that easy on PC and on console it's even tougher, but I've seen pretty good Nurses, so it's not impossible! 
---
As for a cheat (at least imo): Range add ons. If you wanna actually main Nurse and get as good as you can with her, don't run them. But if you're like me and just want to have some fun, then getting used to Nurse with like Omega Blink (Ataxic+Catatonics) or 3 Blinks with Range (Ataxic+Fragile) can make Nurse SO much easier to play. Again, if you intend on becoming the best Nurse possible I wouldn't really recommend, but it's fun!
---
Ah gotcha I agree with that. Believe me I dont like SWF, but comms being cheating is too ridiculous.
---
 Were you saying you thought the crosshairs were cheating or did I misunderstand?
---
WOW EPIC DUDE THANKS !!
---
What does SWF mean?
---
Bing bong sloppy butcher bug in all its glory.
---
Well the reason I said it dropped was because the entire game before I started recording played perfectly fine. It was only when we started getting the advantage that the frame rate started screwing up. The 4-5 other games I played before this no problem what so ever then this game it happened. 
---
As My Wailing Bell Gently Weeps
---
It‚Äôs honestly my top favorite glitches second to the hovering glitch after you drop a pallet while running 
---
The real reason to be mad at NOED is that killers that typically use it are poorly designed and need the perk to secure as many hooks as other higher tier killers. The perk itself is balanced but should strive to never be used by a killer in the game.
---
Nice format
---
I think that‚Äôs a bad idea because of 4 man swf

Also note that before prove thyself was useful for more than just generators.  It was useful for healing or getting others off hooks.  The perk is straight up better at tier 1 and 2, but significantly worse at tier 3 than before the change.  In my opinion, it's only worth running if you're using it to farm blood points.
---
Its not up to the survivor, its up to the Legion. If you get a pallet stun on Legion its because they made the mistake not because you‚Äôre good.
---
Been trying to do the Legion achievement, with the worst description of anything ever, and the SWFs all scatter to do gens while I chase the survivor with 1 hit remaining (you have to down a survivor with deep wounds after putting deep wounds on someone else, all in the same activation period).  
---
Eventually the chased guy realises I'm not actually trying to kill them, so they stop to heal and force me to down them because there is 1 gen remaining and I need some bait.
---
I'd love to get some overly altruistic SWFs.
---
The other achievement is super fun though. Using Mad Grit, Iron Grasp, Agitation and Lightborn then watching the panic as you pick a guy up to chase down their entire team before you hook him.

Turns out if you give a killer a really good upside that he has to work for at the cost of starting out really weak he‚Äôs pretty balanced. Unlike Billy who gets to zoom across the map and have access to an insta down while being 115.

I hate playing with one of my friends but the other two I play with like to. He‚Äôll run decisive every match, and if he misses it... dear god... he‚Äôll disconnect faster than the killer can say toxic Nea. Also he always freaks out that he‚Äôs being tunneled even if he obviously isn‚Äôt.
---
&amp; saving also says ‚Äúhey killer come back over here, there‚Äôs two survivors not on a gen!‚Äù Then I slug the guy that was hooked and chase the other one. Be patient when your on a hook. If you don‚Äôt like being on a hook, get better at evading.
---
That's a better way of putting it, yeah
---
Billy sounds funny when he gets stunned sped up
---
Tahaha I said the same thing
---
4 man swf is a whole other issue that needs to be addressed from a game design perspective, not an ultra rare add on. I think a good starting place is buff solo survivor experience (built in kindred, etc) to bring it closer to swf, then balance around that point. 
---
Well if ur play on ps4 and in na u never got a winter sale üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
The one difference is killers can just go and chase other survivors, while survivors may not have another objective. 
---
You can watch paulies video where he makes it full screen
---
Well, not until closer to Valentine's.
---
noice thanks 
---
Can just take long when you die at the start
---
Would you like the link?
---
Im curious, is it such a sin to want to see the killers stuff? 
---
If killers can see what survivors bring survivors should be able to see what killers bring, even if it is only a mori. I hate DBP events where all the survivors play extra points for everyone only for the killer to bring an ebony.
---
I just recently got the DLC. He's no way OP. His normal speed is slow, His ability is a mix between Pig's Traps and Borrowtime. His status effect that he puts on you is easily healed in 10seconds, and if your in his sight, or in chase the status doesn't hurt you. His ability hit doesn't knock survivors. The best thing about him is his perks. I would rank him right under pig. 
---
Self Preservation is paramount, at any cost!
---
No One Escapes Death, lets you one shot survivors once the exit gates are open. In it's current state it isn't balanced.
---
Or that the players to use it can suck all game, and have their performance drastically changed by a single perk. I like the rework ideas I have heard from streamers giving it a limited amount of oneshots.
---
Because killer can see aura of guy on hook... Right...
---
The question is fundamentally broken. It's very leading and contains an opinion (i.e. "free hits")
---
And then then the yes answer containing more in it than the no answer is a problem
---
This is a textbook example of how to not write a polling question
---
Ur mad
---
What I meant is if ppl think coms are cheating then to me that would be cheating that‚Äôs all I meant really.
---
I mean, wanting to keep people informed is literally counterpoints tho . . .
---
It‚Äôs viewable on mobile as well
---
I want to believe this is a lie.
---
I want to, but I've seen this kind of nonsense before.
---
*sigh*
---
Pretty accurate I think. In fairness, plenty of killers do it to survivors as well, but Killers certainly get hit worse for the double standard of being expected to follow a made up rulebook and then mocked if they are unable to win while following said made up rules because obviously they aren't, the rules are active nerfs to killer's game for the benefit of survivor players.
---
There are many reasons to have to be forced out, though.
---
Do they have a daily that requires them to leave with an item? If a chest is nearby, they're likely waiting for you to leave so they can grab it.
---
Can they take a hit? They probably want the extra BP to level faster.
---
Do you have someone on a hook/is everyone going to make it out? They may try to keep everyone alive.
---
It's not so clear cut as "they are taunting you" dude.
---
And faith!
---
R/quityourbullshit 
---
Oh don‚Äôt get me wrong, she‚Äôs good either way with instadowns but when it comes to landing long distance hatchets you almost entirely have to rely on blind survivors or you have to be an absolute god
---
I'd say Billy and Huntress are what would be considered balanced at top level play.
---
Assuming you have both survivors and a killer who can play absolutely optimally, to the top of the skill ceiling of their characters, these killers are some of the only ones that I think would come out with a "balanced" number of kills/hooks.
---
Nurse and Spirit would still stomp due to how high their skill ceiling with their teleportation abilities.
---
All of the other killers either lack the movement to put on gen pressure, or the damage potential to end chases quickly. And with the killer having to either spend lots of time on chases or traversing the map, survivors who play flawlessly will punish them with gen completion, severely crippling the snowball potential of killers who lack either of these.
---
However, between Billy's movement and Huntress's range, they can essentially be putting damage out as soon as they have line of sight on a survivor, cutting down on their time between chases by either quickly covering distance, or by making distance less meaningful as a defense.
---
Their weapons also give them good damage potential, but they are still forced to tank through loops, unlike Spirit or Nurse, giving them a hard skill ceiling by not allowing them to bypass loops entirely.
---
Problem is that it's so far down the screen that most people won't see it
---
It's **insane,** honestly, how many Asian women play DBD. I was just scrolling through Twitch and it's endless.
---
I feel like they're why we got Rin.
---
You forget the fact that the licensed killers are just that: Licensed. They're not allowed to give them cosmetics without going through a mountain of paperwork and ridiculously stringent screening processes
---
Normal crouching is faster now lol. 
---
That‚Äôs just not what the majority of the community, at least here, uses.  And heartbeat isn‚Äôt a reliable indicator of camping if you‚Äôre against Pig, low terror radius Myers, Wraith, any killer with Insidious, etc.
---
Haha yeah it is hit and miss. i normally spot it late game while chasing or sometime. if they struggle and keep escaping them i may just hook them, but thats a bit lame.
---
8====0~~~~
---
Yeah sure, let me just run into a building on fucking shelter woods.
---
It's not. That's why you can see it after waiting for 5 - 10 minutes.
---
On PS4 I get teabagged by red ranks more than any survivors
---
It would be like a mini Kindred for every player with just one person having it on a team, great for solo playing.
---
I dunno much about this but there are a few discord groups for DBD on pc and there are those LFT websites. If you want you can add me I‚Äôm rank 4 survivor and rank 3 killer. Dm me if you want to.
---
&gt;* Removed the ability for Survivors to view the Killers perks, add-ons and offerings in the tally screen during an on-going match. Killer information will be revealed once all Survivors have exited the match.
---
But the killer can still see who comes into the match, how many people at once (and then probably quit if its 4 at once) and which items they have in their hands.
---
Bollocks.
---
It‚Äôs RNG, devs have no input
---
I‚Äôm out here, minding my own business just levelling people up and then this happens.
---
Dude. The 100% happened to me almost exactly two days ago. Same map, same killer, same path got hit once as I was entering the boat, and the got downed while inside the boat only to be returned to the feet of the killer outside the boat. Wtf. 
---
Haha the reverse troll. when you force the killer to hook you instead
---
They wouldn't, just be part of the game. Temporary solution until alternative objectives are introduced.
---
Idk what to say 
---
Bloodlust should only work on killers who dont have movement speed built into their power at all. (I.E. No Nurse, Billy, Legion)
---
Survivors could get all gene to 95% before finishing any
---
F
---
Holy crap thats beautiful
---
I answered in between, because it's oddly complex; Is think the reason Legion is so fucky is that their game design is based around a marriage of two separate failure state systems. 
---
Most killers operate on the straightforward Wounding system (ie smack once to hurt, smack a second time to down). These killers' abilities generally enhance their ability to get hits within that framework (wraith and nurse sneaking/blinking to people), dish out those same Wound system states in slightly different ways (huntress and trappers' ranged/locational damage), or just blast through both steps (chainsaws). 
---
Some killers do have their own complex systems that run parallel to Wounds (doctor's madness, Freddy's dream world), but those do not directly interact with the Wound system's healthy &gt; wounded &gt; down progression other than essentially making tracking survivors and landing those hits more or less difficult. 
---
The notable pre-Legion exception to this is the Pig, who has an entirely different Bear Trap system. This system also results in sacrifices (if survivors don't find their key in time) but otherwise doesn't really interact with the Wound system. Adding entirely new loss state systems like this, while very complex, can lead to very interesting gameplay and shake up the structure of the game (in fact, this is one of the main reasons I'm a pig main). The Pig, by introducing the RBT system into a match, effectively creates another system the survivors have to worry about killing them on top of wounds (I guess you could argue this was true of hexes when the hag was introduced, but the fact that they can be used by any killer makes them kind of moot here). 
---
Legion is fucky because they attempt to create a new system ala RBTs in the form of Deep Wounds, but WEIRDLY MIX IT it with the already present Wound system. This is where "we don't need to heal against legion" and the PTB wound buffs come from. BHVR, in the interest of cool gameplay, tried to create anothwr killer with their own loss state/system, but, due to the fact that it's stab based, probably felt obligated to tie it into the normal Wound system. As a result, Legion constantly flips back and forth between OP and UP, because the Deep Wound loss state system has to piggyback off of the normal Wound loss state system, which is always gonna be super hard to balance because the only real answers are attempts to get the two to mesh more (PTB buff) which leads to deep wounds feeling even less personal to Legion and less necessary as a mechanic, or decouple the two and end up with a situation where getting stabbed doesn't trigger the normal wound state, which would be silly.
---
TLDR Legion and their balance is broken because the devs tried to create a new loss state for them but made it intermingle with other fixed game loss states in a really hard to balance way.
---
If it said unhook friend then this would be perfect for me because when I'm solo I stay on the gens.
---
When I saw them I instantly knew they were the drawings from the game, just traced. Personally, I didn't really see a problem with it though, they still obviously tried, just not as much as you would if you did original artwork.
---
No. Nobody even plays Legion anymore cause he sucks.
---
nerf let it hit
---
The OP edited the perks function, so my original comment is no longer relevant. 
---
Ps4
---
Haha, well said my friend!^beep boop 
---
Removing survivors from the match as quickly as possible is in your best interest as a killer. Three survivors working generators is better than four on the map.
---
I would prefer if they added a downside to using it, rather than straight up removing the item
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but this is not a good idea. Survivors can just tap gens to avoid skill checks, it‚Äôll take longer but there would be no regression on gens as they wouldn‚Äôt have ruin skill checks. Also, some survivors can‚Äôt hit great skill checks during ruin. Same for me, I sometimes struggle though it depends on frame rate and ping. This can make it so barely gens get done and survivors can‚Äôt escape, almost guaranteeing a win for the killer. Moreover, what happens when you solo queue and survivors who suck at skill checks and don‚Äôt know about tapping just crouch around doing dull totems whilst those who can hit skill checks are getting gens done, how is that fair?
---
Can Spirit see auras in phase mode? Like with Nurses Calling for instance? 
---
&gt; Built in selfcare/ruin

The game would be dead as soon as they announced that.

&gt;gen rushing is the equivalent to tunneling

&gt;plays with flashlight/sabo, runs around trying to make plays, accomplishes nothing, dies, ends game with 6k bp
---
o well 
---
Joking, not to be taken literally, opposite of what's expected. 
---
Most survivors just don't think to move when you hook someone and can see them across the map with BBQ. It is amazing how many free hits you can get with that, usually at least 1 a game.
---
This is a result of the engine update.
---
A lot of bugs happened, most of them were stats being reverted to old values for some reason.
---
Pickup speed was one of them, and I think small killers have slower vaults too, but I have yet to confirm. 
---
Haha wow that's definitely super spooky! RIP to us üò¨üò®
---
Legion rush helps them land 1 hit, but he's really hard to close gaps. His ability helps start a chase, but doesnt help him down survivors. His Rush ability poisons you, but the hits from it doesn't down survivors. The poison he affects you with can be healed in 10seconds(which honestly needs buffed up.) If you use Sprintbrust to run off, his normal movement wont be able to catch up to you.  He has some cool perks that can help against Genrushes, but outside of that I would rank him below the Pig. 
---
There's been a pan sale for going on 5 weeks.....
---
It just hasn't had the DLC.
---
I think this is an interesting idea, I‚Äôm very open to it
---
The stealth symbol from Skyrim. It progresses into the open eye depending on how ‚Äúdetected‚Äù you are.
---
Pretty sure he owns the character so he would
---
The Pig's traps at least lasts longer than 10seconds. 
---
I guess technician would become more popular as well as tool boxes with addons that make skill checks more popular, and I guess gen tapping would become the norm. Never said it would be a good idea, just an idea to "slow the game down just a little bit" -monto. Until an alternative objective could be implemented into regular game play. I understand 4k shouldn't be expected/standard/norm but neither should a 3-4 man escape. Sure there's the standard "git gud" but this usually entails using a select few killers/perks and at red ranks it gets old seeing the same killers over and over when there are so many options because at higher levels of play if its not a meme fest its a 5-8 minute game and just feels unfulfilling on either side. 
---
I almost really wish I had this happen to me instead of the toxic insanity I usually deal with, but if it did I wouldn‚Äôt even feel like I deserved it or know what to do
---
I don't see how shes the most iconic. She was barely in most of the movies and dues pretty quickly. John even after death is incorporated in literally the whole series.
---
The trap she's in is iconic sure, but multiple people wore it and it only killed one person. Both John and Hoffman would've been better killers as they had bigger impacts in the series. Same with Strahm as he was more involved with tracking jigsaw than Tapp
---
I would agree that LF could use some changes, like how he slows down unlike billy when revving his saw. Pig is getting a similar buff to what you are talking about, and Wraith is a better sneak attacker than Mikey because of his windstorm. You could technically buff his base kit and nerf his add ons to make him less reliant on them, but by no means is he in a bad place with them. 
---
The most? Nah. However like any other game community, it can get pretty toxic at times. 
---
yeah purple is the tryhard territory for both teams, oh you got two dcs right at the start? well screw you i am going to tunnel, camp and kill asap, same for survivors with the purple flash and instal heals. For me the most fun i have as both sides is at red and yellow ranks
---
Its up there for sure.Old school halo 2/ gears of war and madden community are all time shitbirds for me
---
Depends on how thin skinned you are, some take the salt to heart while others giggle at it. Some truly mean it while some say it in terms of endearment like the insults/slurs you might call a friend/sibling. 
---
Gears for sure, the moving back and forth after every kill because of the lack of crouching 
---
honestly was there even any surv bug fixes I think i missed em 
---
I recall seeing MCote being asked recently if the license for the Pig allowed for cosmetics and his answer was something like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt comment on this just yet.‚Äù Also her wig was recently changed, and with the buffs it makes me wonder if Pig cosmetics are coming. BHVR pls
---
Its supposed to have the DLC but they just said they are trying to resolve the issue but never did ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò≠
---
this, during the x2 event at new year as soon as i reached red ranks i noticed that the amount of farming survivors and killers that actually tried to get stuff from the event increased like x5, really chill games too, way more enjoyable even now that the event is over than purple
---
I love receiving the messages, I just know they‚Äôre toxic and some people would get upset by them 
---
Mango farming&gt;bloodpoints
---
That sucks, I'm sorry. The other half of survivor mains who aren't pieces of shit don't associate with them lmaooo

---
That's so dumb if they were really that petty. If you outplayed them you deserve the achievement. Bunch of sore losers.
---
What‚Äôs better than three survivors on gens, no survivors on gens.
---
Actually I mostly play swf but I play killer around 30% or so. I see a lot of arguments saying rank is an indicator of how much you play and while that has a good amount of truth, the more you play generally, the better you are. Ill be rank 8 killer and play a match at the end of the season and get destroyed by SWF obviously smurfing their ranks. Im not saying SWF is the problem but just because i dont main killer doesnt mean i should get bullied by deranked survivors coming in to be toxic. Not everyone plays one side.
---
I didn't forget that. Thats the reason they havent added cosmetics, so until thats figured out I wont be buying them. 
---
Knowing that information doesn't change the reason I won't be buying the licensed killers...
---
*opens wallet and moths come out*...I'm a little short. Can you spot me?
---
Did that happen to your art?
---
Oh, definitely. Post game chat is a lot healthier too. I only see hate in purple+ ranks and I always defend killers in that situation.
---
Cute, but you could've just grabbed her as she came out for twice the brutality and you wouldn't have had to waste time on the wipe or pickup.
---
Ah, never watched Ochido. I'll check it out. 
---
I figured Noob was a stretch to be banned.
---
You just listed 2 of my aliases, have I played you before? &lt;3
---
Agreed.
---
Thank u, hook. 
---
I feel like people who say dbd is toxic haven‚Äôt played competitive games. In LoL overwatch and csgo being told you should have been aborted is basically a mechanic 
---
Exactly, make it 300 for all levels(no 50 and such for low levels) or even increase 75-100 to 400-500 per level.
---
For Devotion, either make a 10-25 bonus for each level per devotion, or give a bonus of 500-1000 for reaching 100.
---
You could also throw in some BPs as well. 300-500k for Resetting your level.
---
Camping (or at least being semi-near the hook usually works because of altruism. It is a rare day that I leave the hook for 30 seconds and they aren't already unhooked.
---
Yes, and every woman who accuses a man of rape is telling the truth and totally not lying!!!!111!!! hastag believewhamen
---
I play doc to be super aggressive early and mid game. Late game he can be pretty average
---
You have to DC more games than you complete. So even those who screw over the whole team by suiciding their first hook one minute into the game it still counts as a completed game. 
---
For me it depends on the addons. Insta-saw Billy or prayer bead spirit is a lot scarier than their base form. 
---
You sounded like a p3 immersed claudette main tbh
---
yeah.. english isnt my first language so I can sometimes mess up the spelling, specially when I'm mad or angry.
---
thanks tho
---
FIFA is worse. Much worse.
---
yeah i had that situation today when i was playing against a myers that was going for the jumpscare factor (he never stalked anyone and went t1 the entire match) when we left the swf group that joined the the lobby trashtalked the poor guy so much he left before i could even say "gg dude i almost shit my pants the entire game"
---
You can buy some killers and survivors with shards
---
Its all good my man. Didnt mean any negativity :)
---
Would it be too big? Lol
---
If you want killers to play sub-optimally on purpose, you're missing the point.
---
I just ship Julie and Susie, i like 'em both. But honestly? Everyone in the Legion is good for me, i'd play everyone if i could but the damn skin costs 
---
I do it. And usually end up either escaping or dying last/caught and camped last.
---
Dunno how his shock thing works.
---
I'm currently rank 6 as killer. I have no idea how because I get slapped every goddamn game I play now. This is mostly because of how fast gens get done. Does anyone have any tips on how to actually get kills, stop having 3 gens done in 2 minutes, and end chases? Seriously I have no idea how I'm rank 6... 
---
I'm pretty sure your third and fourth one are commonly accepted as fact.
---
Anyways:
---
* Tapp is unironically the (second) best Survivor for stealth due to how quiet his voice is. He has built in Iron Will.
---
* Claudette's overrated. Yes her Prestige cosmetic is probably the most stealthy due to the color pallet but almost every other Survivor is equally stealthy with Prestige cosmetics. Meg's prestige outfit in particular is actually pretty dark with the exception of her red hair.
---
* Clown isn't good he's inherently worse than Huntress on most maps and even worse than Doctor or Pig on certain matches. ~~Primarily because he's buggy as hell and no one will awknowledge his bugs because they're too busy praising him as high tier.~~
---
* Flashlights aren't skillful you literally just point at the Killer's face when they're in an inescapable animation. It's all timing and muscle memory which isn't skill it's just blind memorization.
---
* Toolboxes are overpowered but that's mostly because of how fast generators are done.
---
* The Brand New Part nerf was overkill. They did need a nerf but now they're virtually useless and Uncommon Socket Swivels do what they do as well if not better.
---
* Most maps could be 10% - 30% smaller and it would make the game much more fun overall. Just look at how shrinking the Swamp maps turned them from "the worst maps in the game" to "vaguely tolerable."
---
* Pig is a more balanced Wraith.
---
* Spirit is a more balanced Nurse.
---
* Hillbilly should be 110%. If he was released in the current state of the game he'd be 110% or possibly even less.
---
* You should Wake Up against Freddy after doing a *successful* skill check, not a failed one. ~~I honestly think that Waking Up should work similarly to Snapping Out of It but I can talk about Freddy reworks later.~~
---
* Glass Bead is the best Survivor ~~addon~~ item: it's perfectly balanced and is perfectly designed to bring the right degree of coordination into a group of players who are supposed to be uncoordinated.
---
* Diversion is the best Survivor perk added in some time and Behavior should add more perks to outplay the Killer as opposed to flat out outrun/outdodge the Killer.
---
* Jeff has the three best Survivor perks added in some time and I'm astounded none of these were added earlier. (Though Breakdown is a bit on the too strong side.)
---
* If Behavior added Self Care to the base Survivor kit the game would be more fun for both sides.
---
* Ace needs cosmetics that don't make him look like a pedofile.
---
* Jake needs cosmetics that don't make him either look badass or like a meme. #SaboLife isn't a good meme and no one wants to buy neon pink clothing in a stealth game.
---
* Feng and Kate are the two worst Survivors in the game don't @ me.
---
Not really unpopular. 
---
new killer Donald Trump revealed
---
It really do be like that sometimes :( sucks
---
Bunny mom got new cosmetics? I have no problem with this
---
Honestly now that I'm thinking about this, I wonder if the solution might just be to have a shorter deep wound timer (15s by default?), have no normal wound on a frenzy stab, then have the timer running out result in a healthy surv being wounded or a wounded surv being down. It seems like that would create the "weird scary fast stabbing teenager" effect without being so damn swingy balance wise and further fleshing out their role as a staller, but I don't really play them enough to know how that would feel...
---
It also is often very out of date.  I've seen it 2-3 weeks out of date a few times.
---
He wasn‚Äôt trash talking, all he literally said was ‚Äúyou have much to learn‚Äù and then ‚Äúbut keep going‚Äù 
---
He was encouraging the killer to keep trying, it may have been a little condescending but he wasn‚Äôt trash talking
---
Its Nerf or nothing.
---
I wish you could see it before the match started.
---

---
Survivor mains are by far sweatier than killer mains.
---
I just do gens now, since no one else is capable of doing so
---
His wig was snatched at the conference today when the democrats told him they‚Äôre not funding the wall e promised republicans Mexico would be paying for.
---
Upvoted because i hate all of these ideas
---
I agree with everything you said, literally everything. I just think the worst part is not that, but its affected by that indirectly.
---
Since Legion has to go through more hits than everyone else, they decided to nuke any skill floor and ceiling he could have. His power is boring, one dimensional and completely voids any possible interaction between Killer and Survivors. Since chases dont have skill involved anymore, the game gets boring and Legion gets stuck in balancement hell. 
---
?
---
There isnt 
---
You too get asphyxiated and must live the rest of your undeath hunting survivors for your new master?
---
Fuck dude
---
How do you know? They put in a timer change and that seems to be affecting exhaustion when hooked. 
---
The counterplay is looping him, he isn‚Äôt a good killer, if he‚Äôs tunneling then your teammates or you should be able to get the gens done easily, he‚Äôs very weak because of how long it takes him to down you without franks mixtape

Clown seems really good without being stupid
---
I think a good Billy with no attachments is just as scary as a Billy with attachments. Zubat makes that pretty clear, he runs nothing anymore on Billy and still destroys. I think your point about spirit is very right though, beads make her a HELL of a lot scarier. 
---
thats callled rubber banding.. what it means is the killer had a not so stable connection. nothing at all to do with the devs 
---
This is on PS4.
---
I would say babysitters, but... why not tennager blonde babysitter being \*\*\*\* in a halloween night, its porn, you can mix everything. 
---
Did you notice all the cat hair that was on the blanket?
---
Are you trolling? Fast vaults, really fast, one hit and you are dead?
---
Megs wearing all black are fast and hard to spot even with whispers. The ones that are suited up like a member of the Bat Family are the scariest Megs. 
---
Don‚Äôt call me out like this..
---
Haha that's very true! It's been a widely debated topic for dedicated servers though which could eliminate this kind of problem üòÖ
---
But yeah you're totally right!:)
---
*Takes off shirt dramatically then oink to the heavens*
---
i just searched that on google and it showed me the first movie.
---
Besides that, I can see why people like to play Legion. His sense of speed is really nice. Vaulting pallets *feels* great. Its just a shame the killer is fundamentally broken and some Legion Mains cant see it (because they are having fun, which is totally fair).
---
Truuuueee. Good ideas
---
I never use noed. Granted, only 1 out of like 30 matches even make it to 5 gens, I just feel its outclassed by most other perks in the match. Running any end game perk is you basically saying "I expect to have the game last til the very end" which is something killers shouldn't strive for.
---
I usually run Brutal Strength, Sloppy Butcherer, Agitation OR Iron Grasp, and with the buff that Spies from the Shadows is getting I‚Äôll probably run that.
---
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre a pretty new player so I would substitute Iron Grasp for Enduring (Hillbilly teachable) or unrelenting (if you tend to miss a lot of hits on survivors) 
---
What I do on trapper is pick the three closest gens, and place my traps near pallets/windows in that general area (trapper excels at protecting one general area) and I try to keep those gens most protected. When the survs get down to 1 gen left they will be left to pick between these three gens to do which will all be close together. This will make patrols really easy and since you‚Äôve trapped that area up your chases should end relatively quickly. 
---
I‚Äôm not a very high rank killer (only around 11-9) but this is what works for me
---
"Complete overhaul"
---
I paid for legion. If they change everything that he is, I'll be wanting my money back xD
---
*thinks I spy a single Quentin main in the bush, but no- it's a Laurie with a piece of fuckin glass*
---
Have I missed something?
---
How have we went from legion being freddy tier to him being a killer that can't be countered.
---
Sounds pretty good. Thanks for the suggestions! Also, is there any way to make a basement build viable? Like hooking survivors in the basement with agitation and iron grasp + Monstrous Shrine?
---
EXACTLY
---
Oh well, fuck him then.
---
Second pebble thing is very agreeable as perks and addons that make the terror radius smaller make the perk a wasted slot.
---
What the actual fuck does it do then
---
People never learned how to play him. I pretty much always pip on Legion, even if I don‚Äôt kill anyone. 
---
Wow, I see you must be a toxic survivor?
---
Its because Legion is pretty terrible at getting 4ks. The fact that every down requires a chase with 3-4 hits in it means there is a long delay between legion finding a target and dropping them. times that by the 8-12 times you'll need to hook a team to finish them and legion usually won't get a 4k. Trouble is, as everyone who cares more about the game in totality than just raw number of kills, legion is basically unavoidable from getting downed once they find you, and that is a real problem. with the core design that can't be fixed with minor numeric buffs. they need a full rework to be reasonable.
---
Lol why is this so complicated for you guys 
---
Freddy is a good Killer.  People like Tyde are playing him wrong and now few people are giving Freddy a chance to shine.
---
DS is fine and barely unfair and NOED is a little less fine but still ok and still a crutch perk
---
r/murderedbywords
---
The maggots on his belly are simply mesmerizing.
---
‚Ä¢ I would rather have the built in bloodhound on Wraith rather than the built in windstorm because it fits better with his character as a "hunter" 
---
‚Ä¢ We need more killers like nurse, i'm not saying we need more super powerful killers but we need more killers that change up the game like nurse does and makes you think more. 
---
‚Ä¢ Spirit it 100% the most overpowerd and annoying killer in the game. She has a power that literally has no counter at all, all she has to do it put on stridor and if she hits you once then the next hit will be super easy and take no effort. There is no counter and her power is so easy that anyone can use her and do super good.
---
‚Ä¢ noed and ds are unfun, unfair, and unbalanced and BHVR knows this but the only reason they haven't been nerfed is because they are scared of the backlash that they will get from all the people who use the perks as a crutch. 
---
I ship Nurse x Wraith x Spirit
---
Dwight x Claudette I imagine their love story started as Dwight went into locker, Claudette tried to open in and saw him in there, since then on they always hide together.
---
Jake x Meg (Jake sabos hooks, since Meg always runs into killer)
---
Feng Min x Quentin (they have sleepless gaming nights &lt;3 ) 
---
Hag x Leatherface (together they make sure nobody leaves hooks)
---
While monstrous shrine seems good for basement builds, it honestly isn‚Äôt lol
---
If you want an effective (albeit could be considered scummy) basement build, I would do Iron Grasp, Agitation, Insidious, and I don‚Äôt remember what the other perk is, if you don‚Äôt wanna camp the basement I would put Territorial Imperative (Huntress teachable) and then leave the basement immediately but stay close enough that you can get back when you get the notification that someone enters
---
I mean I feel like failed skill checks for Freddy both work better thematically (gen blows up in your face and wakes you up) and gameplay wise, because it gives him one last notification of where the survivor is.
---
Reminds me of League of Legends a bit too much
---
[I] sad oin
---
Basically, people learned that if you ignore the dev intended method of playing him (to quick swipes at multiple people and then try and find one to slowly chase and down) and instead play them in a really horrible and unfun way for players (find one person and just tunnel them, dashing in for a swipe every time your power recharges) then legion is completely unavoidable since they can nullify all the survivor chase mechanics. The only hope a survivor has after being found is to pull off the miracle of legion completely losing their trail, and then also not finding them again while the survivor has to spend 10 seconds stood still mending before they just go down anyway.
---
...kinda. I don't think he's that bad, but his playstyle is just anti-fun. Chases last for the amount of time it takes for him to frenzy you down and you could probably end chases faster with Nurse or Billy. I'd say its pretty easy to win chases consistently, and loadouts like Frank's Dirt allows him to really crack down on time spent chasing.
---
?? look im all for opinion posts and everything, but stop being a needy player. the rework will be a rework where he becomes "usable". its not some massive godlike change to fulfill freddy fantasies of players. and cosmetics? really? cosmetics is on your list for a rework? they cant even give him cosmetics as hes copyrighted thats why he quentin laurie michael leatherface bill and other survivors have 0 cosmetics. its not in teh licensing agreement BHVR has with the parent customers. y'all need to chill with the needy consumer stuff and let them do the job they're clearly trying to do
---
Thanks again. And if it doesn't trouble you, would you be able to name the two best traps from each killer that The Trapper could use the best?
---
At this rate of killer buffs were making the game less fun and making the game take less and less skill for killers to end chases
---
because there is a cheap way to play as him so no matter what the survivor does it is impossible to get away 
---
......no it wasnt.....
---
do we have a clip of this??
---
It is lag, could of been you or the killer. How was the killers ping?
---
I don't I just was saying.
---
Alright, thanks
---
But It doesn't even affect luck while in hooks.
---
And It only works one time.
---
Freddy mains are nice to me
---
Knowing BHVR, I expect it to be removed around this time 2020
---
Get bond and that option becomes real easy!
---
what is this casual vs serious debate like this is a game thats based around competition are you not supposed to try and win? like what? survivors t-bagging and spamming how bad you are for not killing them is fine but killing them means your a tryhard?  I dont understand this survivor logic 
---
Breakdown... too strong?  That... That sure is an unpopular opinion.
---
I mean stuff happens, I'm talking about 3 man groups who will leave the random to die or will sandbag them to keep themselves alive
---
That's actually amazing
---
Wraith: the only really good perk for trapper is bloodhound because it will let you track down anyone who was caught in your trap easily
---
Hillbilly: Enduring and Lightborn are just good for every killer in general because it makes DS and loops more bearable as well as stop flashlight saves from SWF groups
---
Nurse: Nurse‚Äôs Calling is good because if anyone escapes from your traps it will be easy to find them healing, ig you could use Stridor too but I would only recommend this if you have a headset and play with your volume pretty loud
---
Hag: Hex Ruin is almost a must-have when you get to higher ranks to stop gen-rushing and Hex: Devour Hope pairs fairly well with Haunted Ground OR Thrill of the Hunt (I would never recommend running more than 2 Hex perks at a time)
---
Doctor: Overcharge, Distressing, and (which ever perk makes your terror radius bigger i forgot what it‚Äôs called) is a very good combo but it works BEST if you actually play doctor with this build. Monitor and Abuse is pretty good if you‚Äôre going for a small- Terror Radius build but that build really only works on Michael and it can kinda-ish combo well but idk what perks really go with it
---
Hook vaccum stopped it
---
Not until you said something! Lol now it's going to be more funny when I look at the Mori photo.
---
I've had that happen to me...wasn't sure if it was 3 man but purposely waiting to unhook me infront of the killer so he could rehook me was rude...
---
Thanks again for all the help.
---
The big thing with trapper is they are the only killer that you kind of need ot be a survivor player as well to really excel at. Trapper primarily relies on you knowing survivor psychology and pathing, so that you can pre-emptively place traps in the places they are likely to go. Get the correct pallets and vaults trapped and it can feel like everywhere you go is trapped to the survivors, but you need to know how they are going to move when you spook them to be able to do that.
---
  
---
Trapper has two major weaknesses, map pressure, and chase. Unfortunately, those are the two categories that killer power is most based on. However, knowing those are your weaknesses means you can deal with them. 
---
NOED isn't a bad pick for trapper. Their lack of map pressure means that it is very common for all 5 gens to be completed even with good trapper players. 
---
Brutal strength is great because you struggle with chases. Every that extra time you would spend breaking a pallet makes a big difference. Ideally you would get enduring from Hillbilly instead, but brutal strength isn't so much worse that you will see much difference so long as you respect the pallets rather than swinging through them.
---
Unnerving and agitation are mistakes in my view. Trapper struggles with aplying map pressure and chasing as I have said, and while it would seem initially that this combo would make harder skill checks, and so cause gens to slow, in reality, players will stop doing gens once they get into your terror radius and either hide or begin to run. In either case, yes you aren't getting gen progress, but it puts you at a big disadvantage in finding and hitting them.
---
I would probably put a whispers on out of those perks you have there, help you to locate the survivors which can hide fairly easy from trapper due to his lack of tracking abilities. It is useful to have at least one survivor locating ability and since you don't have rancor or BBQ&amp;C, this is a good one. You could also go with bitter murmur instead but I just don't like recommending perks that rely on generators being finised (NOED aside).
---
Nice
---
Haha np, just trying to procrastinate my biology hw
---
OMG. 
---
It's the best thing to do.
---
This simple concept is hard for many people to understand. Sucks. 
---
When fire up stays trash D A R N
---
Very nice
---
Thanks my dude, really gave me some insight on how to play Trapper.
---
Miscommunication. I should have said spend 10 seconds otherwise they will go down anyway. As in, even if you escape from legion, unless you do the mend, you still go down, so he has all the time you are mending to pick up your trail again.
---
Nah, but it can be pretty bad sometimes. 
---
There's something about asymmetrical games that seems to amplify toxicity. The "I can do this to you, but you cant do it back."
---
 
---
If I'm playing an FPS, if someone t-bags me I can kill them and do it back. SWF holding the game hostage? Killer going out of his way to tunnel? Not much you can do at that point to retaliate.
---
Lol, yeah. I have sociology and collect. Alg.
---
Haha funny secks number and weed hahaha.
---
If you mean the purple sweater then it's Susie
---
Killers should be slightly faster, but they shouldn't be able to lunge around corners/change direction while lunging. 
---
Fortunately ps4 recently made it way less  convenient to message post game so hate mail has gone down, but yeah, most of the messages I received were from SWF groups being shitty.  
---
I play killer and survivor roughly equally and have literally never gotten hate mail from a killer.  Not saying toxic killers don‚Äôt exist, just my personal experience, but it sure seems like friend groups playing survivors make up a massive portion of the game‚Äôs toxicity.
---
He gave no real chance to survivor, only wasted both time. It wasn't fun to watch. It is like play with rat only to kill it in the end.
---
There's a lot of cat hair on the original pic of the huntress mask lol
---
You darn kids these days don't know what a real pallet town. It's just a term leftover from the olden days *shakes fists violently while remembering Blood Lodge upon release*
---
#LMAO
---
No Ed is surely a perk for noob killers who can't get kills otherwise. 
---
Yellow! Around 200 I think? Could have been either way:)
---
OTHER WAY AROUND NUTMEG.
---
Oh, the pain. I know that pain...
---
I thought Bubba would be ‚Äúalso incest‚Äù since He is both a product and an implied engager.
---
Can we get shirtless pig
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
owo
---
Is the pic I used not the original image?
---
Truly a historic day.
---
I mean, normal timer is 2 1/2 minutes. Even with Ruin it's completely possible to do another gen in that time frame. It's not easy, but if they cleansed ruin (15 seconds), and did another gen (~80 seconds depending on greats) you still have roughly a minute for travel and locating hatch.
---
Again, I won't say it's an easy task, but at least the possibility for an escape existed. 
---
I mean, who doesn't every once in a while?
---
* Freddy is underrated and the only reason why people think he's so awful is because they don't understand his playstyle.
---
* Tunneling and camping are perfectly viable strategies that can have their uses depending on what perks you're using or how the survivors behave.
---
* I'm not a fan of a lot of the cosmetics and I think the store and auric cells are unhealthy for the games integrity.
---
My favorite spirit moment is when I did exactly this and then the survivor DC'd
---
The counter play is not looping him. You might as well stand still if you‚Äôre going to do that
---
nice
---
what's
---
I finally played against Legion and gotta say so far they're the only killer that isn't the slightest bit scary or intimidating to me. Maybe just because they're just random teens with knives but idk.
---
No? What information does the person next to you have that you yourself don't have access to? The major reason SWF is so powerful is because they basically have map wide aura reading.
---
One person finds your hex? now they all know where it is.
---
Chasing someone? the other three don't waste time and do gens.
---
What? You‚Äôre telling me this whole time I‚Äôve been lying to myself. I knew about bear traps &amp; hooks but WHAT no fucking chests? Nani
---
Because disconnecting before dying means you've won, didn't you hear?
---
it happens every now and again, just bad luck really. But yeah I get what you mean if you're the one to miss the great skillcheck because like you said no progress is being made on the gen.
---
It's all about the mind games and anticipating the survivors movements. Yes, chase potential is there but I find myself doing best when I juke the survivors by simply standing still and watching their confusion
---
Freddy maybe be underrated but he‚Äôs still the worst 
---
I agree but I don‚Äôt do those things 
---
The game having cosmetics is good considering the games low price and I don‚Äôt really care because everything is a reasonable price 
---
Do you have a strong stable connection? Are you playing on wifi by any chance?
---
You forgot one.
---
Eating DS with Trapper by setting a trap down then picking up the obsession and positioning yourself so that when they get off your back they fall into the trap
---
Small heartbeats always get me. Michael was the first to make me scream.
---
That is horrible that would get rid of so many killer mind games 360 would work 100% of the time it would literally be impossible to hit survivors survivors would just have to move to the side and BOOM free dodge 
---
[right tho!](https://i.imgur.com/JkFT2LM.jpg)
---
Are you playing on wifi? DBD is host dependent. So if you have bad connection, everyone else is going to have bad connection because YOU as the killer are the host. 
---
I FUCKING HATE BOOSTED SWF DUMBASSES. THEY'RE ANNOYING AS KILLER BUT A HUNDRED GODDAMN FUCKING TIMES WORSE TO HAVE AS TEAMMATES. JUST GOT PAIRED UP WITH A 3 MAN SWF THAT DIDN'T DO A GODDAMN THING EXCEPT BREAK HOOKS **BESIDE THE GODDAMN FUCKING** ***BASEMENT*** AND GET DOWNED AND HOOKED. 
---
I DID HALF A GEN, GOT FOUND BY THE KILLER, CHASED TO THE OTHER END OF THE MAP, ESCAPED, WENT BACK AND FINISHED THE GEN AND THEY GOT FUCK ALL DONE EXCEPT GETTING DOWNED AND HOOKED TOGETHER. SO I RUN DOWN, SAVE THEM, GO DO *ANOTHER* ENTIRE GEN SOLO WHILE THEY DO JACK ALL BUT GET DOWNED AND HOOKED SOME MORE AND ONE OF THEM DIES.
---
I'M 75% DONE WITH A **3RD** GEN AND BOTH OF THEM GET HOOKED **AGAIN** SO I GO AND SAVE THEM **AGAIN.** GET THE FENG FINE BUT THE KILLER'S ON TO ME NOT BEING A GODDAMN POTATOE LIKE THEM AND CHASES ME AS I GO FOR THE CLAUDETTE. IT'S FINE, I THINK, I'LL PULL HER DOWN, GET DOWNED, AND TRADE PLACES WHILE SHE ESCAPES. I'VE GOT MY DELIVERANCE, I'LL JUST WAIT TILL HE GOES LOOKING FOR HER AND KOBE.
---
BUT WHAT DOES CLAUDETTE DO WHEN I SAVE HER? ***CROUCHES NEXT TO THE GODDAMN FUCKING HOOK AND GET FUCKING DOWNED AGAIN.*** KILLER PUTS HER BACK ON THE HOOK AND I GET TAKEN TO THE BASEMENT. FENG GOES OFF AND SELF CARES, THEN RUNS TO THE OTHER END OF THE MAP INSTEAD OF TRYING TO SAVE, AND THE KILLER IS USED TO THE SWF'S HOOK DIVING SO HE STAYS NEAR BY.
---
JUST BEFORE I HIT STRUGGLE I TAKE A CHANCE AND KOBE, HOPING TO SLIP AWAY FOR 40 SECONDS, FIND A NEW MED KIT, AND HEAL. BUT THE KILLER CATCHES ME ON THE STAIRS AND BACK DOWN I GO. WHATEVER, KILLER DOESN'T OWE ME SHIT, IT'S FINE. BUT HEY, LOOK, IT'S THE USELESS FENG ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP POINTING MY WAY AND TEABAGGING.
---
FUCK. YOU. I'M STAYING ON THIS GODDAMN HOOK FOR THE ENTIRE MINUTE. I'M NOT KILLING MYSELF SO YOUR WORTHLESS ASS CAN FIND THE GODDAMN HATCH THAT'S ONLY GOING TO SPAWN BECAUSE ***I*** DID THE FUCKING WORK. SO I WAITED, AND I DIED, AND I SPECTATED, AND I'VE NEVER BEEN SO GODDAMN HAPPY TO WATCH ANOTHER SURVIVOR GET SACRIFICED.
---
He‚Äôs in prison he‚Äôs not getting payed 
---
420 amd 69. 
---
Agreed with the Creeper, the guy who owns him is a convicted pedophile we wouldn‚Äôt be giving him any money, I refuse to watch the third film. 
---
I would love to open an airlock and have it suck all the pallets off the map.
---
How about these blinding hills?https://imgur.com/a/vxgRIRW/
---
Better than getting stalked to tier three lol
---
Been lookin for one to impress me! lol 
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs because BHVR is not buffing them right the main problem is the game is done to fast but BHVR won‚Äôt do anything about it they will just keep adding meaningless buffs 
---
Lolll
---
Great, now I want an MLG ghille suit for Huntress 
---
YEP, STALK'S BUGGED AND WORKS THROUGH VARIOUS WALKS AND OBJECTS EVSR SINCE 2.4. DIDN'T SEE ANY FIX LISTED IN THE 2.5 PATCH NOTES, EITHER.
---
Didn‚Äôt work, I actually googled it and thought maybe I didn‚Äôt do something but here we are
---
i guess math isnt your best at all and what is the problem of only working one time ? also it counters the addons that reduces chance of getting out of a bear trap but if you dont mind being trapped for over 1 hour you can go ahead :)
---
Thats what I meant by MY CONNECTION is completely fine with other games but my host as killer is somehow bad? And no im wired.
---
I think it‚Äôs stupid to exclude anyone on purpose. Excluding Bill was unavoidable. 
---
But those games have dedicated servers or? Because if they have their own server, then you are not the host. You‚Äôre hosting all the 4 survivors connection. 
---
At first I thought you got sniped, then you teleported and I understood why you were angry 
---
REALLY? GOD DAMN IT BEHAVIOR!
---
I really and truly don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but what you believe is wrong in this situation. 
---
Survivors do not get points when the killer does an internet DC. 
---
TOO FUCKIN LOUD
---
Well make it 3 and botany knowledge 3 with a purple med kit 
---
Console has inbuilt screen capture, uses phone. 
---
If your ping is over 200, its probably best to find a different lobby.
---
Unless there the kind of killer who can develop better skills without lag interference. 
---
How does it appear to them? What do you mean juke? I thought it appeared like a teleport 
---
How a bad huntress player feels when they finally hit someone with a throw 
---
The games the most balanced it ever been, unless these ptb changes actually happen. 
---
That's not how you spell "this?" 
---
The build I use at red ranks, I call it "I See You" Doctor:
---
BBQ, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Nurses + Restraint (green or purp) &amp; High Stimulus Electrode.
---
Find a survivor, shock them to lvl 3 and hit them once. If you can easily get the down go for it, otherwise switch targets if another survivor is nearby. Once you shock a survivor to madness tier 3, they cannot drop below tier 2. This means for the rest of the game Restraint will give you regular Doc Illusions letting you know where survivors are (*hint: the illusion always spawns facing the survivor*). Its like Whispers on crack. Restraint also gives an aura whenever a survivor goes up a madness tier, making it very easy to gauge their direction and quickly get a hit.
---
Once in tier 3 and injured, that survivor is occupied for the immediate future while they Snap Out Of It, and Sloppy Butcher makes healing a hassle since you get regular updates on their location. If they make the mistake of healing within your radius, Nurses gives you a free bead on them. 
---
Keep in mind that shocking survivors several times takes time, and you move at 110% in Treatment mode. Ruin helps slow the early game down until you start dishing out madness.
---
Once you get the hang of it, the result is a build that can output a lot of pressure once it gets going. Eventually you'll have someone on hook and get another downed before the pull, and it becomes fairly trivial to end the game at that point, since no one can hide from you.
---
Its not exactly a slugging or 3 gen build, but you should play for those scenarios when they are presented to you. 
---
Also keep in mind a downed survivor in tier 3 is the same as Deerstalker. Playing around the hatch when only 2 survivors are left is very easy.
---
The recent Nurses nerf to Snap Out Of It is a bummer, but the build is still very viable.
---
The toxic people in this community are pretty bad, but you are getting a little too butthurt. Downvote me if you will, karma means nothing, but you aren't suggesting that the toxic people should try to play the game different, or maybe even attempt to stop, but you are insisting that these people should just cut themselves out from the game, I am not toxic myself, and going against these people are indeed a pain in the ass and it may ruin the game, but everybody could change and nobody should be drifted by you kind of people to quit the game, they may make the experience bad for a couple games, but the toxins in this community is really shown by you. Sorry, :/
---
Forgot another one.
---
Throwing a bottle off a ledge with enduring
---
Which one? Hmmmmm 
---
To troll the killer.
---
I guess my internet is trash for hosting then. Some games are crystal clear while others, people say im teleporting. Does the survivors location come into account as well?
---
Finds every survivor guaranteed. After that what happens is up to your skill.
---
SORRY LOL
---
Nah, something with like 2000+ upvotes earlier got outed for just being traced and the person who did that tried to keep saying "oh, it's just a reference, my style is very similar".
---
Someone a few hours later put the official DBD art behind them buit slightly transparent. Exactly the same shape with 0 imperfections.
---
Think of it more like a blind chainsaw run with the hillbilly, the invisible action does make it seem like she would be a sister style to the wraith however in terms of juking and her ability it's a lot like the hillbilly. When you're teleporting they can hear a sort of whisper. The closer you are, the louder it gets. So survivors double back or wait until you're gone since they hear you coming.
---
Oh no oh shit that means i... change absolutely nothing on my playstyle and still take small game :o
---
Yep
---
I don't think it usually matters that much if you unhook immediately, because as you said, it matters if the Killer is near enough to use that hook already. Usually, this means someone got bodied during a rescue attempt.
---
If that's the case, the real reason you wouldn't do that immediately is so that you don't also get hit, farm the hooked guy, or give the killer a chance to immediately hook the failed rescuer on that hook, and follow you both.
---
All said, this isn't basic altruism, and they aren't a hookfarming asshole for doing it. You're mentioning a specific scenario, and your method in most cases wastes more time for everyone, while lowering the chance of healing in time.
---
The spirit is annoying to play against, when she vaults she glitches/disappears and she does it throughout a chase and it really throws me off. I‚Äôm also trash and this certainly doesn‚Äôt help.
---
He‚Äôs a chill dude he just gets frustrated from time to time but he plays super respectful and just gets angry from time to time like everyone does but he‚Äôs allowed to be salty and competitive because he‚Äôs one of the best killers in the game 
---
Yes because its COMPLETELY fair for a killer to get faster and be able to one shot everyone what noed does is it takes whats bad about a killer and makes it godly so what happens is skill is thrown out the window and all you really have to do is hit someone and you get the same gratification as someone who is actually GOOD and doesnt use noed. But use whatever the hell you want im just saying if you want to be known as a SKILLED killer getting 4 mans WITHOUT noed i would consider not using it
---
Nope the only things that affect chests are Plunderer's Instinct and Ace In the Hole
---
That's the point. They want you to chase them. These are usually the runner in my experience. They want you to waste time trying to get them and distracting you from gens.   
---
Killers have bright, glowing skins too with fluorescent ooze coming out of them. You can spot them across the map. Might as well be a beacon. 
---
Thanks üëç
---
There are too many perks and mechanics in this game that reward you for extreme failure. 
---
You only need one pip 56 games in a row to get rank 1. The requirements are so incredibly low that it's easy to do. You literally juat have to exist on the map for however long the game lasts for and as long as you don't sit in a corner with your thumb up your ass you'll get a pip.
---
Before that there was a game. Shitty for survivors, yeah. But after that it was just a torture, not a game.
---
True.  Some of them can teleport 100% of the game.
---
Images the Clown humming and just taking a break to cough and hack midway through
---
One sided much?
---
Then stop playing the game.
---
But you see you also have to remember that it is a FUCKING GAME and when you tunnel your just an asshole not allowing anyone else to have fun and its not very efficient from this statement i can tell your not a very high rank because in rank 5 and below once you finish killing that one person all the gens will be done unless your nurse or spirit thats different if your those 2 then your just a no brain killer
---
Logging off at all this truth 
---
- Hex: Ruin is not necessary to play at Rank 1 and if you can‚Äôt play without it, you need to use a better Killer and improve at the game.
---
- Meg, Nea, Dwight and Adam are gay/not straight (or would be if they had time). So are Trapper and Huntress.
---
- Legion was made for the sole purpose of selling cosmetics, not to add a valuable Killer to the game.
---
- Sloppy Butcher is not as good as people make it out to be. 
---
- DS isn‚Äôt as OP as people say, and Adrenaline is much stronger and should be nerfed first.
---
- Jeff is more of a daddy than David will ever be.
---
In my experience those folks have been the ones that die first lol
---
Yeah because your being an asshole you make the community more toxic when you dont allow people to have fun it doesnt require much skill to go after someone who is injured and on dead hook let them play them game and its not incredibly viable in high ranks
---
That's actually kind of bad ass looking. Now I want an AU where the Russian soldiers managed to capture and recruit the Huntress to fight in WW2. I wonder what a killer taskforce team even look like.
---
Armchair psychologists at their finest lol.
---
I make the person bleed out instead
---
I just hate giving bp when someone has a mori, but there probably isn't a great solution to this.
---
132% is a joke, tbh.
---
Which means the distraction worked. 
---
And yet, you cannot refute the fact that killers also have glowing skins, making their location super obvious. 
---
I do that once I fucked up the gen and the killer hears the noise. I find it's best to take responsibility then dash toward killer so other person could flee.
---
Lol you have to remember that THIS IS A FUCKING GAME and not lose your shit over tunneling like a little fucking baby. 
---
I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE STUPID RNG BULLSHIT BLOODWEBS. HEX:RUIN WON'T APPEAR IN ANY OF MY MAIN KILLERS' BLOODWEBS, BUT I WAS ABLE TO GET HEX:RUIN-TEIR 3 ON LEGION AT LEVEL 6. 
---
Get off Wi-Fi and use an Ethernet cable.
---
Dude that would actually look really cool with her mask
---
The one second blip is worthless for Freddy. He might not be looking in the direction the survivor is having a micronap in when it happens. Also, Freddy does not need Hag's weakness to flashlights.
---
One of the worst gaming communities out there, I don't know what's worse the people who are incredibly toxic because they build their self worth solely around this game or the people who try to sexualize every aspect of it to some freakish extent. 
---
Stockpiled for the year :)
---
&gt;Legion- Orgy
---
FTFY
---
Naw, survivors need some love too.
---
understandable some ppl are shitty but honestly from my experience I always get screwed by randoms way more than a swf group. prob different from platforms 
---
And when everyone's safe and teabagging at the exit? Nobody said anything about "they are taunting you", but people like that need to learn to go out on their own in a timely manner, not sit and wait, wasting the killer's time, until they feel ready to leave.
---
Do you know how the XP points are calculated?
---
lolololol yupppp  i down'ed many survivors doing this
---
It helped me turn 2k games to 4k too many times. I have used it to farm too many points. But I am not going to be a hypocrite, am I? It's a shitty perk and needs to nerfed massively or even be removed. 
---
Who is he talking about? Who tweeted they deranked off stream?
---
If I had sarcasm I would have left a /s like everyone else on the planet. Don't be a douche for misreading my message of sudden realization because you misread it. I don't understand these patch notes whatsoever so don't come at me like you're on that pack
---
Depends on what the legion does or not, if they chase you normally with 110% speed or uses their frenzy to hit you 3 times he is counterable, if they decide to moon walk he has no counter.
---
EVERY TIME I SOLO QUEUE AS SURVIVOR I DO MOST OF THE GENS, GET CAUGHT RIGHT AS THE EXIT GATES OPEN, AND THEN GET CAMPED WHILE MY POTATO TEAMMATES LEAVE. FEELS ONE-HOOKED, MAN.
---
*badum tsss*
---
Until he gets out and gets the money
---
I could just see it right away, 5-10 minutes just take too long tbh. I just wanna know, its nice to see stuff like that
---
As a specified he‚Äôs not getting out any time soon if ever he‚Äôll probably die in there 
---
No no. It‚Äôs rude to DC, stick to toxicity and insulting anyone who doesn‚Äôt like your fave killer.. like people in this subreddit do (: 
---
I REALLY MISS THE DEV STREAM SUMMARY STICKY.
---
cool
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Legion: "Anything you can do, I can do betterrr!"
---
Me: "OK, now please, FUCK OFF!!!" *stabbed*

That‚Äôs two words buddy

Alan wake for Xbox would be pretty cool
---
Doc has infinite magika, plz thu'm
---
Add ons for survivor items stay with you if you escape with the item and don‚Äôt fully use the item
---
You weren‚Äôt trying to kill them well there‚Äôs your first problem XD
---
1: TRY PLAYING SURVIVOR AND SEE HOW FUN THE GAME IS WHEN YOURE NOT ALLOWED A CHANCE TO PLAY IT BECAUSE THE KILLER HAS TO TUNNEL YOU JUST TO GET A KILL. IT TAK S AWAY ALL THE FUN FROM THE GAME AND PEOPLE WHO DO IT ARE JUST ASSHOLES WHO, INSTEAD OF GETTING BETTER AT THE GAME, DECIDE TO RUIN IT FOR ANY UNFORTUNATE SOUL WHO HAPPENS TO PLAY AGAINST THEM. 
---
2: TUNNELLING ISNT EVEN THE BEST WAY TO PLAY 
---
3: HOW DO YOU HAVE FUN IN THIS GAME IF YOU JUST RINSE AND REPEAT GOING AFTER THE SAME PERSON UNTIL THEY DIE? THAT SOUNDS BORING TO ME
---
I really want daddy jake with the sharp mustache they have cool outfits but sadly pc only 
---
It‚Äôs called seizure challenge or something
---
Can't you just stare at her until her hair stands up?
---
Whilst your invis travelling, survivors can hear a constant "whoosh" when you're close. They can retrace their steps and leave you unaware of their location.
---
I'm a Doc main, what you need help with?
---
Lower mid-tier IMO.
---
ITS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME NOT TO RANK UP AND IT SUCKS. RED RANK IS CANCER. 
---
AHAHAHAHAH no
---
I almost made this same post,  but then you just get a bunch of killers calling you butt hurt and whatever else they can think of. Literally just had a match me and one other person popped 3 generators while the other team mate ran from the killer, got hooked,  tunneled and insta killed. Same with the next team mate, except she was face camped till her death. I was then downed, hooked, and face camped till the other survivor saved me as he just watched to immediately tunnel me. Knock me down,  leave me,  down her. Then face camp her as she tried to pull herself off the hook,  once she couldn't he camped the hatch area till he found me near. Then hit me till I died,  ya know because face camping just makes him so "good." 
---
hey, if that means they try to be greedy and i wiggle out, im fine with it
---
I run Sloppy, Enduring, BBQ and Brutal/STBFL, it works vs any type of survs.
---
I'm done with getting MJ'd
---
Yeah I suppose that could work. Honestly hook cosmetics in general could be cool. Either a different type of constraint but that would require a lot of animations for every killer just for cosmetic reasons.
---
Yeah but he ain't though. He's boring as fuck.
---
You want scary, play Michael, stealth doc, or two-blink Nurse. Those either startle me or make me fear for my life.
---
This toxicity is, ironically, what forces many people into SWF. Each slot you fill yourself is one guaranteed non-troll.
---
That‚Äôs extremely dumb. Maybe change it so every hit you take should count. I hope they change it in the next patch, but somehow I doubt it :P
---
Tbf bro, I do this all the time if I survive. It's mostly a distraction for the killer, the idea that I might fuck up.
---
Didn't Hexy advertise and encourage the R-exploit?
---
Also his point on "sweaty survs" is kind of incorrect, because unless you're talking about the fucking depip squad who only try to escape ASAP and nothing else you're probably just facing players above your skill.
---
I do this myself to distract the killer. My reasoning behind it is simple; you wanted to hit me all game now here's your chance.
---
I don't think it should give a token for every single hit, but if I get a protection score, I should get one token. 
---
LMAO
---
I mean, every single killer used to have their own individual hook, but then survivors learned that they could just look at the hooks to see which killer was in the match, effectively robbing stealth killers of any surprise. Now it's just the killer's specific map (if they have one, rip Leatherface) that has their specific hook.
---
The issue is that if survivors want to play fun police they can end games in ~4.5 minutes or less and barely black pip while the killer will depip and have 0 fun.
---
A lot of people cry gen rush about like 8 minute long games though, which I think is ridiculous.
---
Thanks for clearing that up, I was unsure myself what was meant
---
I don't see where it says it is treated as an exhaustion effect.
---
More like I see him immediately and try to stop looting but my character takes 5 years to cancel the action. 
---
You could try not getting hit while NoEd is active you know? You could make sure there are no totems by endgame or cleanse the NoEd totem in endgame. Faced several NoEds and haven‚Äôt had many problems escaping. 
---
WHY THE FUCK IS IT WHEN I RUN DELIVERANCE I'M ALWAYS THE FIRST ONE HOOKED???
---
nope
---
[**YAMAOKA'S ESTATE IS BULLSHIT.**](/intensifies)
---
NO YOU CANNOT CONVINCE ME THIS MAP IS FAIR IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM FOR ANY FUCKING KILLER, EVEN TOP TIER ONES LIKE NURSE.  UNLESS YOU BRING MAXIMUM MOBILITY ITEMS YOU'RE [**FUCKED**](/intensifies) AND HARD AT THAT.
---
WHAT SORT OF GAME STUDIO RELEASES A CONDENSED VERSION OF AN ABSURDLY ENORMOUS MAP LIKE GRIM PANTRY AND *THEN* RELEASES YAMAOKAS LIKE **THAT**????  
---
She rage? How can you tell she raged? 
---
She DCd you know the thing that people do when they get raged 
---
They go all the way through them in the game. You could fix a gen after that tore through your shoulder. 
---
Nice thoughts here as I'm a Legion and Myers main I like your ideas. my only problem with this is Legion is a killer meant to slow the game down therefore a lot of these suggestions would kind of counter his whole purpose right?
---
I disagree. There is rarely toxicity in the end game chat. When it does happen, it stands out to you and you overestimate how often it happens. It is a well known cognative bias. 
---
To be fair, WGLF already seems to have some secondary feature, it's just that not everyone sees it that way. WGLF provides incentive for risky and protective behavior, which further promotes the safety and survivability of other survivors (obvious hook farming is obviously not included).
---
True story. When I first started playing this game, I had no idea about Myers tiers. I played killer first and I knew a lot of people waited at the exit gates and let me hit them once before they ran out. I decide to do this against Myers. I stand there and so does he. I‚Äôm thinking why doesn‚Äôt he hit me. Well he stares at me for a bit and I hear his music. I just assume this is something that plays randomly in chases or whatever. Then the music plays again and he stabs me and I am in the dying state. I‚Äôm so confused. I‚Äôm getting carried to the hook wondering what the hell happened. Then I‚Äôm sacrificed.  It would have been my first time ever escaping. Sadness was real. 
---
nicen't
---
I feel this happens to me a lot I think it can come down to what survivors you face or you're just having a bad day
---
Kowalski never dies. 
---
I seriously do wish that the Wraith couldn't be seen at all while cloaked. It'd make him a truly terrifying killer, one second you are on a gen the other you are being body blocked by a Wraith reappearing behind you.
---
I wish I was lucky enough to never run into a toxic killer. Sounds nice. 
---
You're completely missing the point: None were done to the pivotal points of the game currently, that being Legion's garbage design, Freddy's underpowered status, and Pig trailing right behind Freddy.
---
I tried to make it so that his methods of slowing the game down are engaging to deal with, like the Pig's Reverse Bear Traps. I'm debating whether the Mending duration should be shortened at all, but I still think skill checks would be a huge boon to it.
---
you don't know how many times that horse has scared the crap out of me that horse is scary af‚Ä¶.. I tend to stay away from the gen near that horse lmao
---
Kate‚Äôs PTB sounded like a demonic chewtoy
---
Pro Tip: When you see that, just look up.
---
So stop being shit.
---
I'm sorry for misreading your message.
---
I just assumed you were trying to say it was obvious in the patch notes. 
---
I just had 2 other people on other posts tell me that it was obvious from the patch notes, so I was pretty fed up with those and then saw your post and I guess, I snapped.
---
Stop being such a rude chunt, Jeffery
---
Then we are talking about a bug and not legion being able to double hit
---
implying scratched mirrlr is a good addon
---
Deep Wound is Borrowed Time so change Deep Wound change Borrowed Time honestly the devs were kinda lazy on there part
---
thats why i asked for PC. I know on console is absolutely atrocious.
---
Was it "Daddy!" ?
---
Yeah, it sucks. Im still waiting for the burger king mask for myers. 
---
Yes, we can
---
Stealth Doc? Don't you mean Dr. Myers?
---
There‚Äôs no such thing as gen rushing. It‚Äôs the survivors only objective, what else are they meant to do?
---
WTF you know you can do 3 gens solo and NOT pip right? You're expected to go rescue someone bad and escape the killer at least once.
---
&gt; He gave no real chance to survivor
---
Entirely in character for the Pig.
---
I don't know what you mean with badass but Jake needs to get nicer, but cool outfit. Like police officer outfit with neatly trimmed beard and nice haircut. Not these gangsta looking glasses, weird looking hair, etc. 
---
Play the other killers and upgrade bubba?
---
To be fair, that'd be incredibly overpowered. There's a reason Freddy (who has true invisibility) has his lullaby in the waking world.
---
Bad huntress player here, can confirm
---
They could easily change one or the other. It just so happens that the current deep wound effect functions perfectly fine as borrowed time, I wouldn't say that the devs were lazy on *their* part.
---
Okay keep playimg a game you dont enjoy then
---
Yeah they should but you cant control other people. You can comtrol yourself hit them out
---
I love the zombie horse, he's just so chill while I do the generator haha
---
The current BT is literally just Deep Wounds. They took the original BT, changed the code, and slapped it on a Killer as a power. You literally cannot change one without the other, they're the same lines if code.
---
Yupp
---
You've figured it out!  This game is supposed to be fun!  That means killers too!  We're all playing a game.
---
well there's the downside that getting a 4k with an ebony mori results in less BP and probably no double pip but that's overall a small price to pay
---
The huntress has less cosmetics atm than both spirit and legion
---
David and Jake have great chemistry together whenever I see them running around and saving each other in the game. 
---
Whether it is BroTP or something else, watching them work together is quite a sight. Maybe because both characters are good-looking but also because I feel that they are more or less, each other's equal in terms of survival ability and background story. 
---
It can be hard to tell with killer FOV and hitboxes if you didn't get a hit because of DH or not.
---
Just like with windows, pallets and lockers?
---
I'd think why making a basement for each killer if you can just have purchasable cosmetics that any killer can use? 
---
It's the original Texas chainsaw massacre I think
---
actually laughed at this one
---
Pretty sure that was two words...
---
Still tho I love the edgy teenage murderer aesthetic
---
THEN DONT DO IT IN MY FUCKING GAME WAIT TIL YOU REALLY AREN'T GETTING SAVED. CAUSE GUESS WHAT YOU'RE STAYING ON YOUR SECOND HOOK. YOU FINISHING AN ACHIEVEMENT SHOULDN'T BE AT THE EXPENSE IF YOUR TEAM 
---
BECAUSE YOU WERE JUST GONNA TROLL WITH IT ANYWAY 
---
I am a killer main and also enjoy Legion. I just love their visual design. Also, there is something magical about running with a knife and screaming "GET YO ASS BACK HERE! " 
---
RNG. There's currently 54 Killer perks. Only 2 will appear in the shrine each week. That's a 1:27 chance of a specific perk per shrine. Each week is a unique instance, meaning what appeared before has no effect on the odds. It's still 1:27. Statically, this means there's a less than 50% chance that BBQ will appear in the shrine in a given year. 
---
could you tell what exactly you enjoy about Legion? 
---
Im at rank 7 with 3 pips RN,usually getting 3-4ks and Merciless each round,and not camping(bone clapper for annoyment and windstorm for speed).If its SWF im getting 2ks,and not tunneling.
---
It's just odd seeing a tiny teenage murderer girl lifting a male survivor like it's nothing lol
---
When I face Legion, it's less that they slow the game down and more that they tunnel one person at a time
---
fyi = i know, not i think
---
Idk, just blame the entity
---
Works for me
---
Survivors can break totems/hooks, open chests. They dont have to just sit on a gen all match long.
---
&gt; respect the 4%
---
&gt; ruin is tryhard
---
&gt; bbq is tryhard
---
&gt; noed is bullshit
---
&gt; dont facecamp
---
&gt; dont camp
---
&gt; dont be near the hooked survivor
---
&gt; dont go back if you see someone unhooked
---
&gt; tunneling is unfair
---
&gt; 3 gen strat is sweaty
---
&gt; slugging is toxic
---
&gt; franklins is tryhard
---
&gt; anyone who doesn't farm is a tryhard
---
As I said, mostly visuals. Concept of multiple killers in one, etc. Also, vaulting palleta is cool, but the whole Deep Wound gimmick needs to be changed. 
---
if the killer carries someone to the hook you can go and take a hit. you will definitely get a token. i always do that instead of trying to take a hit for someone during a chase it seems to not work all the time. 
---
What would Myers do breath louder lol
---
I'll fully admit I haven't seen them. I get off playing horror video games. I loathe horror films unfortunately. Except Scream. That was a funny fucking movie. 
---
I live in Russia, but for some reason my lobbies were always full of chinese, japanese people. So i used VPN, it helped. Thanks gods i dont have this problem anymore.
---
Now that spies from the shadows has been buffed, Freddy was deemed too powerful to be kept alive.
---
Sometimes if I'm doing 4man swf we all put on flashlights, then switch off them at the last second to see if we can get the killer to waste 1 or 2 perks slots on lightborne and/or franklins
---
Dpace Esports did some (they sucked)  
---
TydeTyme has multiple on his youtube 
---
Its not a bad addition to the game some of us only pay for the licensed killers
---
But I've gotten it with a mori I'm pretty sure once
---
LITERALLY EVERY SEASON I‚ÄôM RANK 1 AS KILLER, AND I CAN‚ÄôT PASS 5 AS SURVIVOR. ALSO, FUCKING BLOOD POINT DISTRIBUTION HELLO? YES A KILLER DESERVES OVER 40-50K FOR FUCKING BREATHING WHILE SURVIVORS GET 10-20K ON GOOD GAMES? FUCK RIGHT OFF, FIX THIS SHIT SYStEM BHVR YOU KNOW IT‚ÄôS WHY KILLER QUEUES ARE FUCKING YEARS LOG.
---
STOP NERFING SURVIVORS, BUFF KILLERS, ADJUST SURVIVORS, AND FOR THE LOVE OF FUCK GIVE SURVIVORS BLOOD POINTS.
---
Remember, no russian
---
I laughed.
---
I don't think sounding means what you think it means
---
Welcome to the club. I live in an area where 10,4 MB is the best connection possible and I use cable which stabilizes it quite well but it's sad there is nothing more I can do to better my internet. If the survivors got bad ping they'll probably lag. But I've got games where I've asked if I lag or not and got and non-lagging answer.
---
Hail to the holy optical cable I hope I'm getting one day
---
That could have been in a movie haha
---
Better than dying without the points
---
"gg, bruh, no hard feelings"
---
It's not. Even besides the scripted spawns, it cans till happen randomly. 
---
Just did this joke to a friend lmao. 
---
Frank is my favourite personally...
---
-make Legion 115
---
-make Frenzy unable to down survs
---
-make it so that whiffing a hit instantly depletes Frenzy
---
-increase the base duration of the Frenzy.
---
I've literally sprinted away from working on that gen because I see movement out of the corner of my eye and I think it's the killer coming for me, only for me to realize it's just Maurice. 
---
If you think about it, most killers are annoying to play against. Doc, Clown, Hag, Etc
---
She does De-Rank but if you've ever seen one of her "derank" games she spend the entire game playing normally trying to get her teammates out as well as getting hooked and rescued but before she goes out the exit gate she DC's, doesn't harm anything but her rank
---
Someone posted the same bug with freddy some days/weeks ago
---
"Do you know what an artist and a sniper have in common? Details. Like when a touch of color is out of place. When a shadow does not match with its surroundings. Or when a shape is not where it is supposed to be. The only difference is the stakes. Mine are higher."
---
Wait isn‚Äôt hah free?
---
They release a remastered bluray. It amazing how well it holds up. Warning if you never seen it. The movie is debately the first "slasher" movie, and follows no formula. Coming out 1974 beating Halloween(1979) by 5 years. The movie has a slow start, and is meant to be disturbing. 
---
I'm actually a doc main but I actually play him properly not hold M2 and walk around the map ;)
---
And P3 immersed or not nobody can do anything to hide vs him... if you think thats not a problem youre either really bad at the game and need the handicap or just delusional.
---
If any other killer can do fine on tracking survivors than so can the doc.
---
Then by that logic the killer has one objective which is to eliminate the survivors from the match. Why not camp and tunnel then instead of running around playing hide and seek?
---
are you kidding me? the hallowed blight event was easily the worst event so far. the game was literally unplayable for an entire 2 weeks
---
Excellent 
---
Yes
---
I‚Äôve seen it and it was extremely unsettling 
---
same for me the first time on the map haha 
---
She's in the deluxe version, I believe, but I don't have that.
---
Meanwhile pig being a stealth killer has one of the easiest tells
---
Have you ever watched her streams?
---
She spend the first 30 and last 30 talking directly to chat and try to talk to chat as often as possible between and during games even to the extent where the killer catches her while paying attention to chat, Jen also only does SWF maybe 50% of the time? 
---
Look they‚Äôve said it before and we gotta just wait. They‚Äôve had ideas that didn‚Äôt satisfy them. I would rather have a good Freddy than a rushed Freddy 
---
Not feeling either of those at all, they just sound frustrating.
---
But I do know. He's said it on several occasions. Unless, I'm misunderstanding you here.
---
It‚Äôs easy and I feel so bad for some killers stuck in rank 1 cause you can just tell if they belong there or not. 
---
You don't have to own it though, you just get Bill.
---
when theres 1 gen left your cleanding a random dull the gen gets done the totem turns into HEX and you finish it..rip noed.
---
But isn't that pretty op? Aren't gens going to get done pretty much instantly?
---
I tested this really fast when using shroud. 3 of us compete I'm about 20 seconds
---
He is such a cool looking killer c:
---
Rank 1 is a time investment rather than anything. You can be a good killer/survivor and barely play and never make it, and a shitty killer or survivor and get rank 1 eventually.
---
If you're good you just pip faster than normal, but everyone pips eventually. 
---
Dont because sounds are broken.
---
That‚Äôs funny I‚Äôm on mobile and I could downvote your comment just fine üò≥
---
It amazing what it accomplish without any gore. The movie was suppose to be release PG because it techinally qualifies for it. 
---
THE GROWING TREND OF DEV GREED OVER DEV POLISH AND CARE IS REALLY STARTING TO RUFFLE THE FANBASE. WHY IS CONSOLE IN SUCH A POOR STATE. WHY IS LEGION STILL SO DUMB FOR BOTH SIDES, WHERE YOU HAVE TO EXPLOIT HIS POWER TO BE USEFUL.
---
WHY, WHY ARE THEY REDOING THE SAME EVENT AS THE PETALS YET AGAIN, AND PUTTING THE "EXCLUSIVES" INTO THE CELL SHOP. THE EVENT GUARANTEES KILLER WINS OR JUST FARMING IN GENERAL.
---
IF YOU GUYS WOULD WORK ON MAKING YOUR GAME RUN BETTER AND BALANCED, RATHER THAN GET PAID EVEN MORE BANK FOR DOING NOTHING BUT "TESTED" CONTENT AND COSMETICS, THAT'D BE GREAT.
---
This could work with Myers just so I can unlock his perks real quick... I also have like 50 Black splinters (thanks mystery boxes?)
---
Wow. That's insanely fast
---
On the one hand, I agree with that, on the other hand, I think it's ok to give a heads up to survivors when they're against a killer who can literally disable her terror radius at will. I'm on the fence about it.
---
If you click anywhere in the box that isn't arrow, it upvotes. You gotta be ninja aim to hit that fucking thing every time
---
Yea ive watched it moment ago. Dont know what is ur opinion but there are some rules that i dont like so much.  
---
Like perks signed to the character you play that does some of them completely useless. Scoring system stays at the same point of casual game. I could have write an essay about this to be honest ;) but would someone read it?
---
I think they are trying to build a more diverse perk builds while making all perks viable. They added discordance to see two or more people doing a gen. Now there really is a purpose on bringing that perk because prove thyself will be so good.
---
Bare in mind, right now is a hard time to play her since survivor footsteps are, ahem "glitched" making it a bit harder to track them given that they can flat out run in any direction and you won't notice until you come out of phase walk.
---
You probably watched the forfun tournament of Tyde. (The last two were afaik) Go back a bit futher for actual tryhard tournament
---
Yes, but you can get prove thyself for free, most people have it unlocked anyways. You have to either buy legion with 9000 shards or spend real money on him and i'm not too interested in either option, because i'm not interested in playing as the Legion. Most killers aren't even going to make it to that gen if it's far away, only like Hillbilly and Nurse will
---
I'll always advocate for Save the Best for Last, but I wouldn't really recommend it for a killer who has an insta-down or an m2 hit power.
---
That's not quite right. The chance that BBQ will appear in a given year is calculated like this: 
---
There are several cases where BBQ appeared, like 1 time in a year, 2 times in a year, etc, so it's easier if you calculate the chance that it does not appear in the shrine in the entire year. 
---
The chance that it does not appear in a given week is 26/27. This needs to happen every week and as they are independent events, the chance of that is (26/27)^52 which is about 14%.
---
So the chance of BBQ appearing in a given year is about 86%. (Which of course still not guarantee anything and I am not complaining. It's just the math.)
---
Yes, but if only 3 people are able to get a gen in 20 seconds, and those 3 people are in a swf, the match is going to be over in like less than 5 minutes most of the time
---
Was just in a game where i looped legion for 3 gens and by the time i was on hook, there was 1 gen left. Killer left me, last gen popped, and i see 2 teammated opening the 2 exits and one self caring into sloppy butcher. ive got adrenaline and all i need is 1 person to come get me. 
---
No one did. 
---
It was exactly what Piggy needed. Better points and better crouching. 
---
Combat Straps aren‚Äôt that mandatory anymore, such a quality change. 
---
either everyone is on gens and you die or everyone goes for the unhook there is no inbetween
---
It's a competitive game. I'm not going to let someone ~play the game~ when it means me losing.
---
Tunneling is very viable at rank 1. A lot more than camping or trying to pressure gens all game. 
---
Save 1 mil bp and some shards maybe - ‚Äúunlock‚Äù - level to 40~ 
---
Profit. (They should fix that)
---
Yeah I agree people would just run that instead of adrenaline. And i don't understand the killer one?
---
It'd be op if he always had it, but i wouldn't mind it being an ultra rare add-on for him. Most ultra rares are op anyways
---
Don't know this game beyond its name, but of course Hagrid got "Friend of Dog"
---
Like the survivors are wasting their own and the killer's?
---
Entitled for wanting a character fixed lmao. The event thing is not something I'm expecting, of course, that's not happening. What I was saying is that's what would be required for it to be worth the wait.
---
Ahh makes sense
---
everyone has fun until the flash lights start dropping  
---
Tunneling and camping is the most effective* u mean. Just a dick move and bad game design
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
Sure, but how the Killer would know about it?
---
40 levels of bps without bbq and then just never touch him again ever, those 40 levels are worth it because afterwards you will get the equivalent of those 40 way faster thanks to bbq
---
*laughs in cosmetics*
---
They don't! And I'm ok with that.
---
I‚Äôve had about 10 heart attacks with the Pig sneaking up on me while I‚Äôm doing gens no thanks
---
NOED isn‚Äôt a crutch, true. It‚Äôs just a must have for shitty Killers.
---
Good. Start running and stop wasting time
---
Free massage 
---
If you mean the progess bar/repair bar, it's indicate if you either repair faster or slower as normal. Yellow (?) Mean faster, white mean normal, red mean slower.
---
If you mean the skillcheck, red is because of hex:ruin perk of killer.
---
You can use official dead by daylight wiki to lern the perks and more :)
---
They do though. And the fact that now they can do it pretty much twice as fast DOES affect it
---
Ya sorry I was referring to the skill check!! So what does that perk mean then and does he get alerted every time the generator sparks or no??
---
They are called iridescent shards and you earn them trough playtime and can unlock most stuff with enough
---
Yes and no. I see a lot of SWF Group who focus on doing Gens in a lot of Situations. Mainly because they are comfy letting one Guy go to  Hook 2 and hat they can protect him after nearly all gens are done, or they wait till the last second of Hook 1 to deliverance and keep the killer more busy. and so one. I agree however if there are people urban evasion around the map afraid of the killer and helping but usually these people dont do gens at all soooo. 
---
There is a delay between when you can receive tokens 
---
Worse as in worse to play against (as if anyone thought that's possible)
---
Obviously there is soo much for me to learn and just getting the game yesterday with a few wins under my belt I'm officially addicted and want to learn everything ASAP so I appreciate your comment 
---
I was thinking the exact same thing
---
What the actual fuck
---
It also doesn't stack with Botany Knowledge
---
What does SWF means? I looked it up and found this:
---
Single White Female
---
Shock Wave Flash
---
Sovereign Wealth Funds
---
Someone Worth Fucking
---
Snobby White Female
---
 ü§îü§îü§î
---
Aww he overshot it :/
---
100% Billy needs reduced move speed, he can chainsaw sprint with a very low cooldown and can just play as a M1 killer if they want and not be hindered too much.

---
Where could I go to find the best survivors and perks etc to run on them?? I dont see myself ever playing the killer it just seems too damn hard and stressful 
---
Most killers arent really meant to be stealthy however hag has a dirty one for macmillan that makes her all black
---
:(
---
Michael spirit and wraith are the only spooky ones jumpscare wise and two of them need add ons to make it possible
---
Darkness Omong Us
---
Well there is some a lot of perk to day that can suit your playstyle, since different playstyle require different perk I would say you go to dead by daylight gamepedia site and read some so you know the generals ideal of the game. 
---
And because you are new you would have less bloodpoint so pick carefully.
---
No no, it's like this:
---
*#LMAO*
---
Ok idk how blood points work I just go to the blood point tree for claudette and literally click on every one until I level up I'm assuming I'm doing that completely wrong then?
---
Never wait for a perk in the shrine, especially BBQ, the chances of it appearing are pretty low. If you are interested in a perk you should buy the killer and grind its teachable. who knows? maybe you will end up enjoying him
---
Depends on how you play the game, this is the only game I play and I think I can get around 4k shards per week, 2k if I am lazy or 6k if I am grinding
---
I personally use my shards to buy perks from the shrine, even if I already own them so I can get 150k BPs since its faster for me to get 5 dollars to buy a cosmetic or a killer than to wait 3 weeks so I can have enough shards for a new character
---
Also, you are right, buying a character in-game with shards or money is better than buying the DLC bundle since its cheaper and most of the time you won't use the survivor or the killer
---
So TLDR: 
---
Buy the cannibal, bbq hasnt been in the shrine for more than a year and won't be in a long time, plus he is cheap
---
If you buy with shards a perk from the shrine that you already own you get 150k BPs, if you don't care about cosmetics or about buying characters without real money this is the only other way to spend your shards because you can get around 300kBPs per week
---
You can buy any non-licensed-character without spending any money, you will need 9k shards which can take from 2 to 5 weeks
---
Also Myers is fun, consider getting his purple add-ons for a completely different gameplay 
---
‚òÖ Legion is one of the least annoying killers in-game, Doc is the most annoying, and I cannot understand people who hate on legion more than doc. 
---
‚òÖ Susie looks like a generic creepypasta mary sue OC 
---
‚òÖ NOED isn't that bad just fucking do the totems 
---
‚òÖ Ruin is annoying but extremely valid and no one should get hate for it 
---
‚òÖ DS is indeed annoying but it's legit not that difficult to catch the survivor, so stop whining and start chasing. 
---
‚òÖ Killers aren't supposed to get 4K every time, stop calling killers who get 2 hooks or so per match bad. 
---
‚òÖ Swamp should just be removed 
---
‚òÖ Camping is never a valid strategy, tunneling is, but never camping. 
---
Remember when Memes were somewhat well made?
---
This... isn't a big deal. It actually makes Self Care somewhat balanced now.
---
She is the survivor gifted with a cloaking device
---
Thanks! :)
---
The lazy 2k/week is probably more realistic for me then :p - so the rate is more or less constant then if you play a consistent amount? Still, that's not too bad of a rate.
---
150k BP seems like a good increase compared to... whatever it used to be that didn't really seem worthwhile.
---
The thing with Myers is that mine still has a rubbish bunch of perks, although I'm currently leveling him. He *is* fun even at level 1 even though I usually get 2k at most and often lose badly, the killers with mobility-based powers still feel much more powerful and easy.
---
Licenses chars are not actually buyable with 9k then? Either way I guess I will be buying Cannibal then, haha. Should be going on sale for the CNY event?
---
Why not both? Have a stockpile of 2-4k shards in case there are perks you want that week, use the rest of the shards to buy other perks
---
If the killer is patrolling and obviously tunnel hungry Im not going to save my teammate, Im going to let him burn on the hook while we fly through generators. Even if he goes to second phase he wasted the killers time longer than he would have if we just unhooked right in front of him and we got more generators done. 
---
With some killers playstyle thats just the smart thing to do
---
There was this game, where I played bubba and downed a survivor with dc. Because I was too close to a hook, he decided not to use his ability. It was a grave mistake. I only made it look like I am gonna hook him, standing for a second in front of the hook, only then to carry survivor into the basement that was right there. He never left it alive.
---
Doesn't help much after the healing time doubled 
---
Killers can do the same thing for one survivor. Chase them the whole game and stare at them when you hook them while the survivors either do all gens and leave or try and save and you turn a 1k into a 2-4k.
---
It's almost as if you can leave the post game lobby at any time and not have to see what garbage people want to say about you.
---
And killer can't see your PERKS and add-ons untill match is completely over but it's simpler to cry just like after pallet vacuum fix! 
---
&gt;dont facecamp  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;dont camp
---
I have never seen anyone say any of these things apart from \^ this and slugging is toxic.  
---
Facecamp really is toxic. The game wants you to kill 4 Survivors. By facecamping one on purpose (mostly because of super stupid reasons) you just dont even attempt the 4k. Being directly in the face of a hooked survivor even takes points of you when he dies so the devs kinda dont want this camping BS.   
---
" if only dbd was a game where killers were supposed to let survivors win, then everyone might be happy"  
---
Its funny that we Killers are doing SOOO well in the victime role isnt it? All I see the average Killer do is cry cry cry pretend survivors are SO MEAN. After we got every thinkable buff put to our plate?  
---
I am pretty sure we could do the Same list with things Killers would say to survivors. All you have to do is watch Gamma Lunatic or Tru3 for a day and you could really think killers are way to weak. The problem is everybody belives that shit and blames Balance for being trash at the game. 
---
PLEASE READ THIS. I just platinumed the game, and I can explain how adepts work (sorta). 
---
I have multiple screenshots of getting the trophy with a Ruthless (aka a 1 pip game) and also with a Merciless (2 pip) game. Now, when the game first released, a Merciless Victory was attained by getting four kills, not Moris (unless you hooked them twice I believe.)
---
Now, from what I can tell, it bases it off of Four kills. BUT if you mori one, it will base part of it off of emblems. It seems to be wildly inconsistent, but what I have found to work for me is bring an ivory mori (if you really want to mori). The ivory didn't seem to interfere with the trophy too much.
---
Have you ever played LoL or csgo?
---
Breakdown is literally his weakest perk lmao. Its like Alert but only used when you get unhooked...why would you need that. The sabo part is irrelevant and doesnt work on basement hooks. Truly a just straight up bad perk. Its effect is cool and all but like...why? Theres no need for it.
---
Your system was so obnoxious and weird I didn't even read your entire first post. Just because it was that terrible of a suggestion from my viewpoint.  
---
Nothing against your idea, have fun with it... but I personally think it is so garbage I cannot even suggest a change to it, cause its all bad. Rework it fully. 
---
Kinda makes me think of a game I had recently.
---
Wraith with the no sound clapper and 6 second redstain/radius supression addons. Super sneak boi. On Legions map.
---
Grab a Bill off a gen next to the shack. Basement time. I leave the shack to kick Bills gen and I see the shack light up with scratch marks. Run down, its meg with ds. She bodyblocks for him, loops me kn the shack for a bit, gets downed inside.
---
I try to drop her off the stairs when she ds's, i succeed but her othermeg buddy with a flashlight runs in and blinds me. I have LB 2 so it doesn't last long, but this flashlight hero is determined to bodyblock, so I hit, he fucks up the speed boost and runs into a rock, and I down em. Basement time.
---
Come back up, I hear injured meg nearby. Spooky uncloak, i down her. Basement time x2.
---
Now. With two fresh hooks in the basement, I don't really got much reason to leave. So I cloak, go out of the shack and wait. 10 seconds later 2 gens pop.
---
*maybe this was a mistake.jpeg*
---
Oh wait no it wasn't cuz here comes Bill. I uncloak too fast so he doesn't run down the stairs. Smack him, chase for a bit but as I turn around, Adam fancis running in my basement.
---
Going back to the shack after 2 unhooks. Adam doesn't evem try to bodyblock for othermeg. So I down her. DS meg is still in the basement. She gets slapped.
---
Pick up DS meg. DC.
---
Go back up to see Adam outside the window, but I pick up othermeg anyway and basement time her. Go up while spooky, check locker, Adamn pops out the other one. I chase, othermeg DCs on hook.
---
I down Francis eventually, again near the basement cuz they all seem to think a no pallet shack is still very safe. Basement time him, and...come on. Its an Adam that got two unhooks. I go spooky mode, patrol the surrounding area and the main building for a Bill, and lucky for me right on the time I decided to go back towards the basement, Adam unhooks himself.
---
Slap him down on the stairs.
---
He DC's.
---
Look around for bill, find him, get him injured and chase. We reach the hatch but I managed to cut him off and force him in the opposite direction, and eventually down him.
---
He DCs when hooked.
---
So a 4DC game at around rank 8 to a Wraith with rank 2 perks and the only meta one being BBQ.
---
I didn't get any harassment. But a DC is a good indicator to me that they think im sweaty.
---
Or remove the movement speed and it would be a fine perk and not an issue at all.
---
Like Blood Warden afaik.
---
Wait it doesn't?? Why do I even have it when??
---
Want this on a t shirt
---
The true child of the corn.
---
Lol. I am rank 1. I see it all the time. Its ok to be in denial though.
---
Why would you be going back to the hook instead of finishing your chase? I dont get it. When I play Killer I hook someone, see a BBQ aura and go to it and chase that person. When the other person gets unhooked Im already in mid chase with the survivor and they‚Äôre probably injured so why would I go back to tunnel the other guy? The only reason for you to go back to the hook is if you were so bad you couldnt start a chase with someone or you were proxy camping
---
This happened in Evolve too, i was one of the people that loved that game and at high tiers monsters winning was incredibly rare but super exciting 
---
new people that got evolve either played as monster and found the game fun or played as hunter and got massacred by monsters
---
Mid tier was supper balanced as both sides skill level was average but this made the game really fun for both sides
---
High tier monsters struggled to catch a break from the hunters and had trouble getting to the last stage of the game
---
Also fuck Evolve stage two, the game sucked after that
---
I'm literally tilted 24/7 I see her because I want to know the source so bad.
---
Sounding disparaged that they didn't nerf DS and then praising them for making it even easier to cheese people with Legion?
---
Yeah, that's a shitty killer right there. You can tell.
---
And I really think you're in the same boat as Clayfighter.
---
You know why?
---
Because you called Legion a fun when he's designed in a worse way than DS.
---
Yes it does. It's been especially noticeable ever since the universal healing speed nerf 
---
I was playing as the pig after a good amount of eddies, and for some reason I just really like the way the crouching felt so I was doing my little crouch walk through haddonfield, and I actually jumped and screamed when a claudette I didnt know I was stalking threw a palette down on me and I had to take a second to recuperate. I was so high I couldn't even track them down and eventually just let them all go in the end lmao
---
The new prove thyself changes.
---
&gt;WHY, WHY ARE THEY REDOING THE SAME EVENT AS THE PETALS YET AGAIN, AND PUTTING THE "EXCLUSIVES" INTO THE CELL SHOP. THE EVENT GUARANTEES KILLER WINS OR JUST FARMING IN GENERAL.
---
THEY'RE NOT REDOING IT, KILLERS ALSO HAVE TO DO A SIDE OBJECTIVE FOR THE EVENT THIS TIME. AND THE EVENT COSMETICS ARE GOING INTO THE STORE BECAUSE EXCLUSIVES ARE STUPID AND MEANT TO GIVE PEOPLE WITH SMALL DICKS SOMETHING TO BRAG ABOUT.
---
Little reminder: for more you stand in game, more exp you earn
---
Use Play with your food, the reduced movement speed from the tombstone plus reduced speed while stalking can be brutal
---
Freddy isnt the worst. Pig is because her power is reliant on RNG and is trash in the worst way possible based on the map. It isnt like Billy on Lery‚Äôs where oh no you cant go zoom zoom because you still have an insta saw. If you get pig on a map like Asylum instead of Swamp or any map that is shaped like a bowtie, then your main power that is supposed to slow the game down is rendered useless and you‚Äôre left with your terrible crouch. Also even if you get a good map the survivor can still get lucky and get their trap off in one go.
---
Freddy is just really solid at slowing the game down with his power and keeping pressure on everyone. If the survivors dont have self care/bond/medkit its hard to wake up. Monitor and Abuse and Sloppy Butcher are good perks on him because you can take advantage of your aura reading ability to see people in dream world and catch them by surprise and then you make healing super slow so even if they do self care it still slows the game down. Freddy is way better than people make him out to be
---
Cornfield, I cant see shit
---
The Myth The Legend..Claudette
---
You can actually pip up with 0 sacrifices, having hooked 3 people during the game, and some chase score, breaking a pallet or two ...
---
Oh he's fun to play, because I actually play the game to play it, if that makes sense. You've heard of ScottJund, right? When asked why he doesn't play Nurse he replied, "Because I actually enjoy chases." God tier nurses make games boring. Staring at blood as Legion is boring. People who do that are, you guessed it, boring. I am a Rank 1 killer, just got the Platinum trophy, and have all Killers maxed out, and I still enjoy playing Legion. Because he is fun. 
---
And no, he isn't designed worse than DS. The current Legion issue comes from an oversight in design. DS came into the game broken as hell. It's the difference between a gun accidentally firing, and purposely pulling the trigger.
---
Not sure how one person could say Legion is fun but Spirit isnt. The chase with Legion is always the same with no counterplay. At least with the spirit there is some counterplay and the chase is almost never the same.
---
It all depends on the situation. Are you having trouble getting gens done did you gen strays your self? Get gen done first. Is this still the first or second gen ? Get survivor. Is this the last gen ? Get gen done first.  Is he face camping? You got time get gen done. Is he Chan‚Äôs I g after someone else ? Get the unhook. It‚Äôs all dependent on the situation. 
---
Instant healing medkits are the biggest horseshit in the game and no one seems to be talking about it
---
Cleanse before gens
---
Surveillance only starts when a gen is regressing, it doesn't do anything until you kick a gen.
---
THE NEXT PATCH IS FULL OF SURVIVOR BUFFS AND ONLY A COUPLE OVERDUE KILLER BUFFS. MOST KILLER SHIT IS QOL IMPROVEMENTS. AND THE LEGION CHANGE IS UTTERLY IRRELEVANT IF YOU JUST HEAL BECAUSE IT ONLY APPLIES TO ALREADY INJURED SURVIVORS. LEGION IS STILL D TIER AT BEST.
---
I love Legion, and I'm guessing anyone that thinks he's OP has never played against a Rank1 Hillybilly or Nurse with thier best item loadouts. 
---
Just being about to just pallets and windows helps breaks these infinite loops and pallet runs every survivor does. There nothing more satisfying than having a survivor drop a pallet, jumping over it and then downing them.
---
that emote expression is illegal on this land
---
Ah. I was about to c9mment about how your firmatting gave me a stroke, but it was mobile having an aneurysm. Thanks for the info.
---
Well I will get a gate open first just so that if I‚Äôm able to get you off the hook we don‚Äôt have to wait for the gates to be open to escape because you are already hurt and I can take one hit for you but after that it‚Äôs a game of time
---
What is that texture you‚Äôre using?
---
I honestly would love for this game to go F2P, but they would need to redo the bpoints system.
---
Why tf would they need an offering or item? 
---
Buffs for just about all killers minus nurse,billy, huntress. Just a brief and quick callout, didn't really feel like typing out a whole bunch of half thought idea's of buffs at the time.
---
&gt; Diversion is the best Survivor perk added in some time and Behavior should add more perks to outplay the Killer as opposed to flat out outrun/outdodge the Killer.
---
Agree on this one honestly. In my opinion exhaustion perks are a relic of the game's early time when players weren't as good as they are today. Exhaustion perks currently just feel like a free reset on a fuckup.
---
the doctor is stupid and makes no sense, he can just shoot electricity through walls, completely negating hiding from the killer and its just stupid holy shit
---
If he is slowed while revving then it isn't much perhaps its different on PC? I play on xbox and can literally follow small loops revving my chainsaw as billy, while leatherface has a significant and noticeable drop in his movement speed while revving.
---
I like the idea but imo it's kind of nice to see his model without the dream world ambience clouding over it though. 
---
Well it will be if your healing speed is slower than default 100%, but 200% healing speed is a hardcap, which is We'll make it speed exactly.
---
Doc is my least favorite to play against. 
---
Get Enduring unlocked (Hillbilly teachable) as it is legit the best perk in the game for any killer that has to run loops (you can force trade-offs by eating a stun in order to end a loop, very effective with brutal strength for further decreasing the loss of time). 
---
Also both, Enduring and Brutal Strength should be available to you. Same for Whispers, which is a standard perk and pretty nice to check out gens without going the whole way (or checking if someone hides around you to see where you put down your traps). 
---
If you've  played self care with botany knowledge it is absolutely disgusting and imo this change needs to be reverted because self care is fine as it is now.
---
There is a hardcap at 200% healing speed. So probably Botany Knowledge + We'll Make It + Self-Care would stack in the current PTB
---
SWF isn't a problem until it becomes toxic. 
---
That's just an error. Leave the shop and go back in.
---
Watch the grass. Try being out of sight while beginning the phase. Injured survivors usually park themselves at a pallet to heal themselves. Expect that. Try to come around the pallet on the side opposite of where they're expecting you to come from. In other words, take the long way around to the other side of the pallet and smag them.  
---
Stridor hardly helps, and may even be a disadvantage. It doesn't raise the volume, it just makes their hearing distances greater. Avoid. 
---
I was going to go for all achievements but this one seems so ridiculously difficult that I'm not going to bother :/
---
We still don't know. 
---
If you "Gen rush" and get hit with noed it's your fault because totems are also objectives 
---
You cannot break animations in this game. Here the hooking animation already started.
---
Same goes for double stuns, you have to wait for the first stun animation to end in order to stun again (e.g DStriking in a pallet and instantly slamming it won‚Äòt double stun the killer). 
---
Okay but what does respecting mean in this context? 
---
Facecamping so he doesn't unhook himself?
---
No, it‚Äôs not. There aren‚Äôt Auric Cells in PS Asia.
---
Lowkey toxics can change. People who set their names to display their toxicity can not. 
---
I LIKE IT BECUASE MOST KILLER DONT USE RUUN IN THESE EVENTS.
---
Too bad he didn't dc
---
I don't deal with a lot of framedrops on my PS4, however, when I faced a Sloppy Butcher Wraith on Yamaoka Estate the other day, 3 of use were still alive and spouting blood, and the game turned into a literal slideshow until I was the last one alive, by then the FPS went normal again, but I still died because I was already in chase at that point.
---
1. Train to laugh like the Doctor does
---
2. Hit shocks and laugh along with him
---
3. ???
---
4. Profit
---
Nope. You're wrong. The Self Care change is a massive buff.
---
I believe four people on one generator all with Prove Thyself repair in about 22 seconds, whereas four people on one gen without Prove Thyself repairs in about 26 seconds. Question is whether or not the 4 seconds saved time is worth it.
---
SO RUNNING SELF CARE APPLIES THAT PENALTY TO OTHERS HEALING YOU?
---
As I said, albeit less often. Still, it's nice, even if you occasionally get double jugnle gyms with double pallets. That shit gave me cancer, AIDS, and PTSD. 
---
Please stop bitching. Holy shit everything you say has something to do with swf, yet you're toxic as fuck yourself. Are you just salty that other people actually *have* friends to play with? 
---
Mending isnt healing so you cant see it
---
Sure pal.
---
Why, the objective of survivor is to die in the basement of course
---
I gave him the actually fastest way to level up. Just because crying salt lords get triggered as soon as someone picks Legion doesn't mean facts actually become untrue.
---
And here we see someone who blames swf for their lack of skill being a complete hypocrite!

1st update

---
Second and most recent update.
---
What?When did I say that?
---
He can be pallet looped forever if you are good.
---
Only spirit, huntress and Nurse (and Legion to some extent) can counter looping. 
---
This is not true. It used to be this way but now you can.
---
Source: my Adept Legion last week.
---
I think if you use the hemorrhagic syringe that heals 2 health states, it gets rid of deep wound and heals you to full, Downside is it's only effective once and they're hard to come across but thanks to the bloodhunt and winter event I'm chock full of em
---
I've had this happen a few times and the killers never gave two shits about it and often participate in the insults when I called out the toxic swf group (because apparently being salty for getting obviously sandbagged makes me a little bitch or something).
---
The thing that makes NOED scary aren't bad killers, but good killers. Against bad killers you have plenty of time to cleanse totems, search chests, or whatever you want to do. Against good killers you don't have time to waste so you have to get the gens ASAP, and can't waste your time on a 'might have NOED' hunch.
---
I still have nightmares.
---
The killer one notifies you when someone is actively opening the exit gate...I would say that is pretty good.
---
The survivor one puts you in a state of bleed out and one hit...your aura is revealed to the killer...its dangerous game for extra BPs.
---
No I dont see a problem...I only see a suggestion that can be tweaked into something interesting.
---
Imagine facing that as Freddy.
---
"If you're feeling suicidal, you've come to the right place."
---
I thought this was gonna be about his lobby baby hand...but I actually really like this idea.
---
No it formatted badly at first because I posted it from mobile, but I edited it to be a bit better. Sorry about that! 
---
&gt; Hex: Ruin is not necessary to play at Rank 1 and if you can‚Äôt play without it, you need to use a better Killer and/or improve at the game.
---
Here is my problem with Ruin. Against good survivors it doesn't matter, because they can hit the skillchecks, and you are better off using a perk that will help you shorten the chase. Against bad survivors it still doesn't matter and you would have won even if you didn't have it. The only good thing about it is, if people search for it(and can't find it early), instead of doing gens it slows the game down. That's the real time waster.
---
Surveilance is now automatically applied to all gens at the start. Unless survivors anticipate the perk, it will allow you to get a good info on survivor location in the first seconds of the game. Saving that search time, especially on slow killers, is crucial. 
---
So?
---
The killer buffs are getting a little unbalanced
---
oh
---
Welp, im pretty sure this is the best idea and every exisiting one is far away of being even "ok" or avarage.  
---
Some quick notes:
---
\- one-sided game. Whole game depends on survivors and how good they are
---
\- game favors tunneling / camping. As a killer you can do nothing against gen rush. As a killer u have to play around triangle (idk if u know the strat where u defend the area around 3 gens the whole time, forcing runners to destroy there pallets and securing there a hook). No punishment for this and by this you are gonna earn more points than chasing runners like stupid. Im a survivor main and the game is so much easy or often not enjoyable cuz there is 40% games where one of the survivors gets tunneled;
---
\- low-macro game at the current state
---
\- balance doesnt exist. So much unplayable things.
---
\- tbh with my around 8 years "esport career" or just long time gamer this is the worst managed game ive ever seen. Yeah I count Hots, h1z1, csgo and other games. Horrible managment doesnt disqualify game of being enjoyable or playable. At this point im crossing the line of how to not manage your own game instead of showing what could be good to make the game a little bit competitive.  
---
Whole system is a cure to solve the problems.  
---
The game is dead inside her own hearth. The only one thing making it fun is playing with someone else. There is no rank system, no rewards, but this is long story from my view.
---
Good time for some finger guns Ace.
---
It was perfect timing.The only crutch survivors have is ds and thats it.
---
&gt; Gate automatically closes after 20/30 seconds of being open
---
Awful. You remove altruism from end game. 30 seconds is not enough to make a save. And making a save with gates closed is not a very good idea.
---
That's how Mori works. 
---
&gt; I cannot understand people who hate on legion more than doc.
---
Not counter play. I can dodge docs shock, I can evade him even. But with Legion what am I supposed to do? I jump through the window they do the same. Docs strength is tracking, but if you know how to loop it doesn't matter. So his shock can be used to deny me a vault/pallet drop, but at least he is slowed down, and I can evade it. With Legion it's basically you have to pallet stun him if you don't want you to hit you. 
---
A mythical creature. We know it exists, but it has never been seen.
---
Insert witty LOTR reference that ties into DbD.
---
LOTR skins when?
---
Hag seems obvious Golem skin
---
The killer one is rendered ineffective in a situation where there is more than 1 person left alive, especially if they're running your second perk and / or anything for loops.
---
 Good luck capitalizing on the notification when it procs mid-chase, then you chase that person off and realize the other door is opened.
---
Do you mean it gives an aura?
---
The second one makes Adrenaline either redundant or works with it to turn a slug into an immediate mending problem, renders NOED inviable, has no drawbacks that would make people want to avoid it, other than if the killer stops looking at you, in which case you can mend very easily.
---
I know the aura sounds worrying, but the people running this would more likely than not be able to easily mend it or loop you out, leaving you sincerely fucked even if you were to run a chainsaw through them.
---
Body blocking the stairs instead of going for the claudette you knew was up there isn't a decent way to play. And letting Adam bleed out of the floor is stupidly boring for him and rewards you with far less bloodpoints. 
---
"IT'S TIME TO STOP."
---
"WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?!?" 
---
Can be*
---
Depends on pallet spawns and where he initially finds you since he appears on you pretty much instantly. Lets not forget he can chainsaw through windows.
---
So I wanted to share it? Thought that was pretty obvious - guess notü§î
---
&gt; All generators start under the effects of Surveilance at the start of the match.
---
As I see this, all gens are white at the start. The moment survivor touches a gen that gen goes yellow and you get the direction. I might be wrong. 
---
Lol when they brag about juking you but it's because rhey use a character who practically disappears as soon as she runs into the corn.
---
Care to list them? Not trying to be a dick, just curious. 
---
Nope, i Just did 10 kills everyday until i get it (so either i miscalculated or got the trophy 50 kills after the 500th)
---
Makes sense. I don't know what kind of mindgames you can really do with a 14m radius, but I'm sure it's not a huge hindrance.
---
Personally, I really like having the extra slot open in case I want to bring Franklin's, since you can shoot back out and eat them when they go back for their item.
---
Let me just get to a pallet ok?
---
Lol. I dont think you understand how important it is to know which door is getting touched/opened when they are far apart.
---
Thats like saying using NOED and hooking a survivor rather than slugging them and going back to a door...by the time you hook you have wasted time and the door is open...illogical analogy. 
---
You are risking dying for extra bloodpoints...they dont get the BPs unless they have deep wound which makes them one hit....hello?
---
I hope all the PTB changes get pushed through, I was getting bored playing killer and I've gotta catch up on my backlog of unplayed games.
---
Someone has already posted the numbers. Self-healing is MUCH faster, and it's MUCH faster to go run into a bush and self-heal than it is to wait on another survivor to heal you.
---
This puts healing times worse than they were before the healing nerf update.
---
Self-care used to take 24 seconds, it now takes 21.34 seconds.
---
Play the ptb and its amazing how fast the survivor status icons are going from injured to healed. There's no real penalty to being hit anymore, less reason to fear taking a hit.
---
You're playing the nurse and have the best perks in the game you really have no leg to stand on making a thread like this 
---
Or get a back rub.
---
THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME FROM THE HOOK BUT WHY ARE YOU HEALING ME NEXT TO THE HOOK OR IN THE OPEN........ LET ME GET INTO SOME SORT OF COVER FIRST FFS
---
Number 1 - 2 Perks are not even upgraded (i would not run ruin if i had the perks that i'd like but i just prestiged it)
---
Number 2 - Add-ons are weak/mediocre
---
Number 3 - Could switch out almost any of these perks with Noed and would have had a 4man. But for some reason killers are to respect DS and at the same time not use that perk because it's unfair.
---
Not trying to be mean or condescending, I just think that 4 DS swf is pretty BM. The post was meant to be funny because of the fact that if I hadn't played nurse and well, it would be pretty much impossible to play this game (and I really liked how my name looked with 4DS on top of it).
---
YUP do it!
---
It means standing in front of a hook doing nothing but staring at the survivor. It's just bad manners usually unless the survivor is toxic to you first. Camping is actually punishable in end for killers as you lose points for being around a hooked survivor. However, the dev's have made it clear that camping at end game in no way shape or form is against the rules. 
---
Enjoy
---
Back in the days when we had like 30 pallets each game instead of like 6-8

A tip that will get a lot of shit. You are not obligated to save anyone. Until you get the hang of things concentrate on learning how to survive then learn to be a hero. Another tip. Be flexible. Medics, jockeys, and runners are often the ones that survive. If your team needs a medic be a medic, etc. Dont get angry if you lose a pip in a match. It's a temporary setback. If you're good enough to get there once you can do it again. Most importantly. Have fun. It's a game.
---
It's probably because as it currently is it affects the last 3 gens you kicked. That sentence confirms that you don't need to kick a generator to apply the sound range effect.
---
Csgo isn't really asymmetrical. 
---
THERE SEEM TO BE A LOT OF DERANKED SWF TEAMS HANGING AROUND AT RANK 15 EVEN LATER INTO THE MONTH. AS KILLER MY GAMES ACTUALLY BECAME TEN TIMES EASIER ONCE I BROKE FREE OF 15, BUT IT IS A LOT HARDER TO ESCAPE IT AS A SOLO SURVIVOR IF YOUR TEAMMATES FARM YOU. 
---
Legion ain‚Äôt got nothin‚Äô on the wraith 
---
Mine was standing at the shack window looking out, and the Nea urban evaded right up to me so I downed her through it.
---
Ty for clarifying this! 
---
believe it or not this is what all leather-facecampers see when pitching the tent, i prefer to play in cell shaded personally but hey to each there own.
---
yeah at this point I get in the cliche villain role and play along to make them angrier :)
---
r/UnexpectedRainbow6
---
No too scary 
---
For sure dude, it felt like I was teleporting around.
---
Lmao fuck off.You dont like having no counterplay but you like being overpowered.What an entitled whiny piece of shit you are.
---
It's the Exit, where else are you patrolling when it's open? Them sitting there shouldn't be wasting too much time anyway.
---
NO, YOU HEAL OTHERS AS FAST AS YOU HEAL YOURSELF, BUT SELF-CARE SLOWS HEALING!
---
I can agree on that. Hopefully my comment didn‚Äôt sound too rude haha. I just see a lot of players that talks about swf groups like they‚Äôre all godlike players, which isn‚Äôt true (in my experience). 
---
sounds like OP got btfo by better players and would rather cry on reddit than play better
---
You learn something new everyday I guess. That has to be a fairly new change they made then.
---
Noone wants to see legion gameplay.What is there to see from a killer that has no counterplay?
---
According to devs, the lunar new year event will work in a similar manner, except both sides will be going for the same objective. Survivors will have to collect it before the killers destroy it, and vice versa
---
Perks dont rly matter. Here are a few pointers from me.
---
1. If you havent heard a heartbeat after 30 sec into a match then you start working on gens, not before, or if you can see the obsession is in chase.
---
2. Look at your surroundings and memorize your escape while working.
---
3. If your teammate gets hooked you keep working on gen until you can confirm the killer is not camping or is chasing another player. If you dont hear a heartbeat in lets say 30 sec you can stop working. If you still dont hear it you are safe to unhook. Circumstances May differ if you have perks like borrowed time etc.
---
One of the most frusterating things I see when playing survivor is when I get hooked, the killer is camping me, and I am surrounded by 3 survivors thirsting for them unhook bps.
---
These are just a few things to consider, but it should be enough to get higher. You can probably ignore this advice and still rise in ranks too, haha. Just my honest opinion. 
---
&gt; And my point wasn't that Jund loves Legion or some shit.
---
Cool. Not what I was getting at. More of the fact that you mentioned him to back up why you like playing Legion when he fucking hates Legion.
---
&gt;It was that he doesn't play things the most strong and optimal way because it is less fun.
---
No, he doesn't play Nurse because he's shit with her, he doesn't like her power, and he doesn't like that she breaks the game by ignoring all obstacles. Not because she's too strong or optimal.
---
&gt;You see, I don't worry about that, because I play to have fun. I play Legion as intended, and I have a blast.
---
Cool. That still doesn't answer my question of 
---
&gt;So please, for the love of fuck, explain to me how Legion's "little design oversight" isn't worse than DS when there was so much feedback from the community AND FROM OTHER MEMBERS OF THE DEV TEAM, and how Legion didn't come into the game broken as hell.
---
&gt;&gt;Please, tell me how a literal no skill killer that tunnels people to death and makes it literally impossible to get away from them unless they LET YOU LIVE and then are giving them a built-in Frank's mixtape is not designed worse than a perk that makes it so the killer drops you and are ways to work around DS.
---
Sounds like this moonlight event or whatever its called is basically Hallowed Blight.
---
They described collecting an objective and destroying them as killer to earn currency to buy skins that will be $10 after the event.
---
So get ready its coming in a couple weeks.
---
With these times being drastically faster... 3 gen strats are about to become the standard 
---
You can legit just outrun him, feral isn't forever and takes a while to load, just don't run around like an idiot leaving scratch marks and he won't find you. 
---
*Mission failed we get him next time*
---
That's before Sloppy Butcher... 
---
Killer mains: Take the game less seriously, glad to give away hatches to people that deserved them, don't usually get too frustrated, even when all four escape, etc.  
---
Survivor mains: Change their names to mock the killer, constantly teabag and disrespect killers, DC on the first down, scream "camper!" if you don't run to the opposite side of the map after hooking them, play it off like Killer mains are the children. 
---
Devs: Shit mate, we better take care of our survivor mains. 
---
Always know where the next loop is, don‚Äôt just run around hoping to find a pallet or t wall. Iron will is super, super useful. Don‚Äôt use dead hard, I used to love it but it fails more than it works. Don‚Äôt farm team mates, if the killer is camping do gens.

They don't perma for this they just take away your message privileges.

This should probably be tagged NSFW. Since you're also providing sauce.
---
Because it _isn't intended_. It isn't how Legion is _supposed_ to be played. DS is _designed to be the way it is_ whereas the Legion issue is _a side effect of how the game's mechanics work._ Not that hard to comprehend ~~yet you still seem to have some issue~~
---
currently in a live chat with NVidia... they suspect it might actually be a fucked up GPU that needs to be RMA'd
---
I RUN SPINE CHILL CAUSE OF THIS AND YES I KNOW I AM A BABY SURVIVOR BUT AT LEAST NOW I'M NOT FIRST ONE CAUGHT
---
It's a big buff to people using self care. It's a massive nerf to the people on their team who get healed slowly.
---
Yea honestly I thought the same of you until I went for Legion as I was having no luck at rank 1 with his base perks, and looked it up.
---
I was SO UPSET the other day playing survivor. We were against Clown and I spawned right next to the killer shack and basement, so wandered down there to check out the chest before I hopped on a gen. Clown finds and downs another survivor directly above me within about 30 seconds of me entering the basement. No worries, I creep my way to the lockers furthest back and watch as he brings Dwight down, rubbing my hands together and giggling over the knowledge that I will pull off the wildest save once Clown has jiggled further across the map. Clown even brings Dwight to the furthest hook back from the entrance, closest to me. I hold my breath, praying that he fails to notice the open chest in the corner as he lifts Dwight onto the hook. 
---
Dwight disconnects immediately. The second his sweet, saleable body touches that hook, he pulls the plug, long before he can see my dumb ass hiding in a locker a foot away. He is gone. I am alone with the Clown. 
---
Clown stops for a moment in confusion, then waddles his way up the stairs, leaving me alone and weeping in frustration.  
---
 I got a purple toolbox out of the chest and the rest of us escaped. But I fear my heart will never recover. 
---
I play with WiFi 
---
No, it says 'merciless' but uses the OLD definition which used to mean nobody survived.
---
This is probably wifi. Your wifi is not stable enough. Even though I get a 50mbps download speed I sometimes get complaints about my lag. It‚Äôs much better to have a wired connection if you‚Äôre playing killer. Remember your connection is hosting the game for the 4 survivors too.
---
God, you'll jump through any fucking hoop to say Legion isn't shit won't you?
---
Seriously, fuck off.
---
Lol no its the entitled survivors with their d-strikes that like having no counter play. Even better when its d-strike and instaheal right after.
---
Overpowered? Nah. I've said a number of things on the killer side need nerfs.
---
I just find it funny how when something comes along thats broken on the killer side there's a river of tears. You're the entitled one.
---
originally it was M1 but can be triggered once a gate is opened. Mend needs skill checks IMO
---
I only see the issue with SWF most of the time. This game is not balanced around SWF anyway
---
This seems right. In my experience, 1 or 2 moris usually still counts, 3 or 4 will not.
---
Seeing as OP has morid 2 people, and also brought the cuntress build, that'd be an incredibly low emblem game as there's very few chases, very few hits, and little if any hook progression.
---
So the current counterplay to DS is:  
---
1- Not counterplaying it and probably run Enduring to not suffer the whole blunt of the damage.
---
2- Juggle him to near hook if there is. Which means if you hook him 3 times, with hooks conveniently close each time. Imagining only 1 player has DS, knowing pick up =3s, drop=2s, and let's say you walk only twice with maximum distance possible 2s, 3 times = 7\*3 = 24-30s only getting the survivor from where he dropped to the hook. Knowing a gen takes 80s without hitting any great skillchecks or any toolbox and your 4v1, you gave up a whole gen for that perk. (Also this is in a game and scenario with no swf with flashlights or pallets in the way to the hook)  
---
 TL;DR: You sacrificed a whole gen that game to not deal with DS, if you're lucky.
---
3- This happens so very few times and usually only in specific maps, that the likelyhood you get it is dropped even more if you're expecting it to happen 3 times, or even harder if the survivor is actually good and sees what you're doing.
---
Adrenaline as you mentioned is a fantastic perk. Not only can it be extremely clutch during late game chases, but the speed boost also can be extremely useful to open gates even sooner. At no point did I say it's not an amazing perk, I also acknowledge DH and SC around the same category, DH because in proper hands can extend any chase or even help you completely escape, and SC because of the usual case where it can keep you away from inminent death after losing a single chase, without the need for assistance.  
---
Nevertheless, DS would still outrank most of them (maybe not SC ) because the use of it forces killer to use a slot in perks (which in comparison to losing a slot as survivor is devastating), and, even if he does, still prevents a hook and gives you a second opportunity at looping/escaping
---
"Goodnight"
---
a. He didn't seem to even look if Myers was close.
---
b. Not all of us care enough to waste half an hour staring at a screen waiting for the situation to change when it never will.
---
I do that and it works 50% of the time. \^\_\^
---
What is even in the shrine this week?
---
Legion, played as intended, is weak. This is just an oversight, a bug you might say. They will fix it and people will forget. You act like this is 2002 and once something is released then boom thats it. Grow up.
---
Ahh yes rusty shackle hag with grandmas heart to confuse the fuck out of them
---
[Still on the first page of all time top posts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/8q2e43/he_had_been_practicing_that/)
---
One time I got two survivors on hooks right at the start with the Trapped Totems perk and they both quit. 
---
Indeed. I remember buying the game in December 2017 and being all creeped out by the Christmas themed menu music. Too bad it's not the standard version.
---
Thanks for the advice :)  Will try and get Shadowborn for her &amp; up my sensitivity.  I'm a bit hit and miss with her, most of my games are terrible but in those terrible games I've gotten some really good hits that I'm proud of! 
---
Play the game, perks barely make a difference.
---
Same goes for killers
---
Doc definitely I hate him with a passion. Hag isn‚Äôt too bad to deal with and I rarely run into clown.
---
Itd be a cool short game where you just run around and chuck hatchets while they shoot back in fear
---
Hag is annoying when you rescue a teammate and he runs, setting off all the traps
---
it just sucks that some perks become useless when you got a group who are using VC, thats my main issue with SWF, not killers wanting easy mode.  
---
Like you down someone with KO and rush off, but they just tell their buds over VC where to come help them up. 
---
Do you at least understand that point ?
---
The Wraith!
---
Sure especially when they clearly shouldnt hit.
---
It is pretty rare that I voluntarily give the hatch to a survivor. But when someone clearly outplays me like that and makes a chase last basically the entire game, i tend to let them have it. You deserve it after lasting so long that only running out of pallets on the map was what stopped you.
---
This is how all games should be, fun. Not exactly letting them go etc but just not being toxic? And recognizing skill without abusing them 
---
That's pretty much what a crutch is...
---
He literally does none of that, he‚Äôll give hatch rarely.
---
If this is happening consistently and regularly to you, it sounds like it is on your internet and not the game. I play on console and from australia which has notoriously slow internet and it is not a constant problem for me.
---
Sounds good to me, been wanting medieval and pirate style killers forever now.
---
Always go for the perks on the bloodweb. They are diamond shaped, and you can only get one per bloodweb.
---
Well I'm not making it up, maybe you should watch him a little more.
---
I don't think this is fan content
---
you should at least know the killer's abilities to be able to actually survive. 
---
If i'm not wrong this is the skin you can purchase at the lunar event with the gold coins
---
Neither of those things has anything to do with poor development or bad internet pr console. They are both intended aspects of the game
---
ready for your next meltdown? You can hit people over the fence in Haddonfield
---
I want you to try something. Load up a kill your friends lobby. I want you to play killer. find a window with a friend. have them stand on one side of it (don't have them vault though - just stand on one stand). i want you to stand on the other side. swing your weapon at them. they will get it. just because you fault through a window does not mean you are out of range. same for pallets.
---
i am so sick of people who don't understand anything about the game crying about it
---
I'll be uninstalling if that happens, I don't want PTSD IM TOO YOUNG FOR THIS
---
Holy moly, nice! Did you do this in Blender?
---
Legion is an extremely easy killer to beat though.
---
Yes. This reminded me that this was a game. After that not getting a single kill does not annoy me as much it used to be. Now I know it's a game and long as you are having fun the match results does not matter.
---
Freddy shoulda had one where the gf/stepmom/stepsis is sleeping and the guy just pervs on them, leading to fucking
---
Example: What is the range on ((Empathy)) again?
---
I would argue that blue haired Feng Mins are ten times more toxic than either of them
---
rarely had any issues with toxic killers..
---
Except one idiot of a huntress who was running insidious and camping a hook in the basement. spammed like a moron post game , lols and keks etc etc
---
seen far more toxic survivors.
---
last night one of them glitched through the exit and was running around out side the play area. she was teabagging and emotes , she kept the game hostage for a long while, since she was the last one.
---
i alt tabbed and went to watch youtube for a while till she  went to get the hatch after seeing her me not disconnect or move for a while. reported her ofcc
---
Windows are annoying; but for pallets, drop them earlier and stop going for stuns.
---
Comment?
---
Dude, that was a fucking private message you sent to me because I called you incompetent.
---
I hurt your pride and you sent me a pic of an achievement as a "Oh yeah? Well I did this".
---
You also wanna bring up and brag about being red rank too while you're at it?
---
Oh wait, in your second comment you talked about you being a rank 1 so you've already done that.
---
Get out of here.
---
It is. I always go there first and hope the killer comes to me - with BL I can waste so much of his time, it's a very safe spot.
---
i like how your salty ass is alone in downvoting lmfao
---
Just do a few games where you farm and spend a few minutes trying to tell the dumbass survivors what you want them to do (I call them dumbasses cuz most of them were completely clueless no matter how many time I told them to stay in one place, they kept following me)
---
It happens a quite a bit on pc too, sometimes teleporting the killer to your side despite them clearly being on the other side. It definitely a bug. I get it semi-frequently, my friends get it semi-frequently, and quite a few survs in reddit and the discussion board on steam get it.
---
It doesn't get fixed by adrenaline, and it does not heal you after it wears off.
---
This one is pretty neat but not too impressive to me. Good thing I don't play Huntress anyway.
---
Freddy has a ranged attack now, he runs around with a nerf gun
---
((Barbecue and chili))
---
Had this happen yesterday. Someone was on the hook with kindred. I spotted two other people on generators so I made a dash for the save.
---
Somebody else then comes off their generator to steal the save off of me. I was absolutely seething.
---
I highly doubt she'll get anything but it's the *Year* of the pig so there is plenty of time.
---
I have dead hard fuck off
---
IF THE KILLER IS THE HAG, AND I UNHOOK YOU, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HOLD YOUR FRIGGIN' CROUCH BUTTON!
---
This is why even if you are not swf you should still all work as a team... you don‚Äôt need to go ‚Äútotem hunting‚Äù just if you happen to see one cleanse it. That‚Äôs all you have to do. If everyone on the team is playing like this 9 times out of 10 noed will not be an issue.
---
Noed is not a crutch perk. It‚Äôs for players like you who all they want to do is rush gens as fast as they can and not work together to get everyone out.
---
I mean, I think there's always the chance that you've accidentally made the same meme as someone else.  Probably not super likey though.
---
well i'll test it tonight but i'd assume that if your medkit runs out then it would switch to the we'll make it bonus

Good bot. And now ((Hex: Ruin))

**Hex: Ruin:**

* 2/3/4 Survivors are affected by Ruin, which causes the following:

Thank you! I did this in Source Filmmaker.
---
The guy who made Jeepers Creepers is an asshole, yes. 
---
It still doesn‚Äôt devalue the movie or the character though. Those are two separate worlds. 
---
Also Kate‚Äôs screeching was painful, yes...for me.
---
I cannot believe how many people are saying it‚Äôs a waste of time doing totems or saying if ‚Äúthen I‚Äôll just be wandering around not doing gens for a long time.‚Äù 
---
Noed is a perk to counter players like that who just want to get gens done as fast as they can. So if you are one of those players then yes it is your fault you didn‚Äôt cleanse any totems.
---
You don‚Äôt have to go ‚Äútotem hunting‚Äù or try and cleanse all the totems yourself. By all means do gens, that‚Äôs how you escape, but if you happen to see a dull totem on your way to a gen just take out the totem. Even if you are a solo survivor, if everyone takes out any totem they see noed won‚Äôt be an issue. Just throwin that out there. And hey you get blood points if nothing else. 
---
It doesn't even look edited wtf
---
((bond))
---
What if the survivor is simply trying to point out that another survivor is spending the entire match hiding in a locker? With bond I've noticed lots of survivors doing nothing but waiting in lockers for the hatch. 
---
Healing yourself is faster in the PTB and, since everyone runs Self Care, just as fast as other people healing you.

There is no precisely *zero* reason to let other people heal you.

Saw this on AGDQ eh?
---
And all but the Hallowed Blight skin are awful.
---
Could you imagine Billy wearing the butchered carcass of a pig?
---
Derank to 15 right before rank reset. I know its scummy but if its only for one game its not really a big deal. Also it kinda balances out because the survivors do good when you derank.
---
First pig and Micheal stabbing your ass whithout a terror radius now huntess is just sniper wraith
---
Because it won‚Äôt slow down the game nearly as much. Hitting a SC user with SB now means that you‚Äôre significantly inconveniencing them (40 seconds of healing is a long time), which means that injuring survivors has some meaning. If the changes go through as they are, then someone hit with SB and self caring will heal faster than they do just self caring now. Injuring survivors without downing them will be a bigger waste of the killer‚Äôs time than theirs.
---
Hey man, if you want I can post the format without the text. Just say and I‚Äôll do it.
---
Okay. ... And? Encouraging you to split up to maximize efficiency is a bad thing? I don't see the problem here. Just, heal yourself if it matters so much. (Also as a side note, wouldn't it be the same if it is a blanket 25 percent to all healing? So, you SC at 75, and they heal you at 75 (if they are running self care))
---
I wasn't being sarcastic :( I know its perfectly balanced.
---
#ProtectQuentin #GetThisBoiAPillow
---
Sorry. The phrase, "I love how," usually signals sarcasm. 
---
Cool, I guess.
---
Is it not a big difference anymore with combat straps? Maybe I can prestige my pig now after all.
---
I used to think Myers was overpowered as hell because I didn't know the exposed effect just meant you could be downed instantly.
---
I was like "WHAT HE CAN SEE US?!"
---
Its from Dragon Ball Abridged :)
---
I wanna pat his cutie head everytime I walk by
---
Oh, sorry lol guess thats my bad
---
The old crouch time was 2 seconds and combat straps made it 1 second.
---
Now it is 1.3 seconds and combat straps make it 1 second.
---
Lol no I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs up to me. If you miss it‚Äôs cuz you miss timed it. Plain and simple. Same reason it‚Äôs on a killer to aim his swings and not get 360d all day. There are plenty of videos out there showing plenty of ppl pallet slamming him just fine. 
---
Oh my god, it's a man! I thought it was the other half of the skull lazily painted 
---
One of the totems in the map are hexed (you can identify it with a soft fire glowing on the totem). This means that the killed probably has Hex: Ruin. When you figure out that the Killer has Hex: Ruin, stop doing gens and go find the totem and destroy it. You always want to destroy any totem, Hex or dull. Once you destroy the Hex Totem, the perk loses effectivity, and now you can repair gens normally.

---
Haha yeah but they could adjust it  to stay at 600 points even with the skill checks . My thinking is that it‚Äôs to easy to take down such an important tool of the killers kit,  there  should be some challenge towards doing that type of action. You could argue that maybe it‚Äôs to many  skill check required actions or perhaps people won‚Äôt enjoy it, then I believe the best course of action would be to put skill checks on  only hex totems thus increasing the life span and utility of a hex totem for just a little bit longer. 
---
If someone carries me to the exit and people are still in game that see what's happening, you get to hook everyone twice before we leave.  That's just good manners.

The only really infamous perks I remember seeing since the start of summer are Decisive Strike and Ruin.

I‚Äôm on console. I don‚Äôt see him to much. Not nearly as much as I did spirit when she first showed up. 
---
Those were my nice words.
---
That doesn‚Äôt work anymore. Survivors get immunity for a second falling off the killer‚Äôs shoulder, because trappers used to farm by having people fall into the trap 8 times to maximize deviousness at the expense of the survivor‚Äôs time
---
Get him!
---
You sound like a salty survivor boy who got 4kd one too many times 
---
Nice I‚Äôm glad you think so, do you know where exactly is the best place to share this idea that the devs can see it ? I‚Äôm sure plenty of people have shared this idea with them already but one more couldn‚Äôt hurt ! 
---
I play both pretty much equally so I understand I kind of hate playing survivor these days unless my friend I play with is on because randoms can be a pain. We try not to be too toxic when we do swf. 
---
Only one prove thyself can be active at a time, so it doesn't matter that all 4 have it.
---
I unironically kinda dig it, but I can see it burning my retinas when I play at night.
---
Back in June, when the emblem system was first released. It was A LOT harder to rank up. Guess what, everyone complained and cried and they made it easier. I just think we are screwed no matter how it is as some group with complain about it. :(

On my first Myers game ever as a noob survivor he had a Tombstone. Me and my friends were like "Oh it's the Halloween man. Why isn't he attacking? Now the famous tune's pla-" and he just butchered us one by one from full health. I hadn't ever seen a Mori of any kind so it felt confusing and scary.

I'm literally always at rank 1 so I'm running into DS every single game.

It's not a problem to deal with at all.

It's literally just a minor annoyance before they're put on a hook.

As I said, maybe I am just really good at this game because it is no where near as difficult to deal with as you people make it out to be.
---
It's a one time thing.
---
You know who has it.

And you can make them use it before the first gen is done.

Literally the only time it is a problem is if they DS and insta. That's it.

Which leads me to say that, the new STEAM packages ... 1009820 - 1009821 could be 2 killers in coming months, one of them is 100% sure the spring killer.

I mean more along the lines of people missing skill checks . 
---
It should be hard. It should be an achievement. It should be just as punishing as it is rewarding. As of now with how easy it is to rank up, it‚Äôs meaningless.
---
have you seen myers using maurice as cover to stalk you ? 
---
Extra nightmare fuel.
---
just drop them earlier if your lucky you will get the stun if not at least you wont take a bullshit hit
---
Well they won‚Äôt, skills checks are hella easy. Surely you would be punished for something like this when people go through and hit every great? I can do it on a ruin gen, so I would probably do it on a totem.
---
You must be new to the internet!
---
I initially copied the text from the wiki, but just to save myself the headache of writing code to deal with the wiki API and got rid of all the flavor text on there, I'm pulling my version of the perk text from a locally saved .csv file.
---
And indeed, due to the relatively low amount of perks and changes, keeping my own database seemed like the better option.
---
My point on wraith is that his power is almost as much of a handicap as it is useful, by the time you uncloak (so damn slowto uncloak even with the built in windstorm) and catch up to the survivor to hit them, you could have just as easily ran them down with any other 115% movement speed killer, his power doesn't help end a chase and his sneak attack ability is 2nd rate compared to a tier 1 myers or crouching pig.
---
heh after 5 years i think they can wait a little bit longer but still OOF
---
A good survivor wants to be seen. 
---
Oinky oinky .
---
I am with you 100%.  i had no issues with the emblems system when it was first released. I still pipped and ranked up because I was playing the way you need to if you want to rank up.  Chasing, hooking, killing as killer and as survivor, Doing gens, hook saves, and try to last as long as possible in a chase.....ya know, being active in the game.  Not licking walls or derping around :P
---
If it was intended why is it so inconsistent? I can vault a window and be at the other side and there is a 50/50 chance the killer will either hit the window, or swing with such power they send a razor sharp gust of wind into my spine.
---
They are badASS!!!

Haha well I do sometimes especially when a killer is about to hit me. What I mean to say is skill checks have the potential of allowing totems to stay up a little bit longer for example if your cleansing and a killer sees you and you mess up the last skill check you need that would make or break your totem,  before the killer is on top of you then the totem stays up a little longer. I‚Äôm not saying it will make a huge difference but in certain cases it could make a small difference. 
---
Enjoy your internet points, use them wisely.
---
That's not facecamping. Facecamping is for when a killer stands in front of a hook and makes it so survivors cant rescue. It was a bannable offense. Its literally impossible at this point in the game and has been for a year.  
---
This is just regular camping.
---
This one also has dangly bits of tusks.  Probably drop a little frames on console.
---
funny *af*
---
THE PIG whoa there buddy first off her power is one of the best at throwing down the game she has ability that can be used in a chase (at a pallet to trick someone) ALSO SHE DOENST HAVE TO KILL
---
Photos taken seconds before tragedy
---
whatever tunneling biatch
---
Her Terror Radius use to take 6.6 seconds to appear and disappear but its now 4 seconds.
---
So before if you had Combat straps you'd uncrouch in 1 second and have 5.6 seconds of 115% movement speed and no terror radius
---
So you just uncrouched behind a wall and bam
---
Me a billy main- haha sucker
---
((NOED))
---
Even then, you get 3 attempts at base, so the true percentage is more like 11%.  Not that rare.
---
You're really not liked in this sub huh:/ every time i see you comment you somehow piss everyone off.
---
I want the format
---
Why can Detective Tapp and Laurie Strode have like one alternate outfit but not the killers? Some booty. 
---
Hmm, okay. Just... like an experimental kind of thing for shits and grins? Well, could be interesting. I wouldn't want to face this AI at the peak of its learning process, assuming its sufficiently complex to juggle all the moving parts of a DBD game.
---
lagswitch. devs bringing servers so don‚Äôt worry about that
---
What do you think a good Legion does that reliably wins pallet mindgames that a bad legion won't do? I mean besides failing to even play the mindgame, obviously. Like I said, worst case is you tank the first hit and still stun to deny the followup hit or the rest of his Frenzy. In a lot of situations there's not even duration left on Frenzy to play a mindgame and you have to just dive under the pallet trying to get a hit.
---
Pallet Town all the way
---
Yisssss touch me butt. 
---
Which two?
---
I like how you used a tent to cleverly reference camping :)) 
---
Amazing work. Can we please get the same version with previously released outfit? the traditional dress one I mean. 
---
We already have quentin 
---
I MISSED RAGE WEDNESDAY BECAUSE I DIDN‚ÄôT KNOW IT WAS A THING!!!
---
what is ((dying light)) again
---
When they tbag at the gate but realize noed and blood warden are active
---
**Dying Light:**  
---
* You become obsessed with one Survivor.
---
Your Obsession's altruistic action speed is increased by 38/44/50 %.
---
Once the Obsession is killed or sacrificed, every other Survivor gets a penalty of 19/22/25 % to Repair, Healing and Sabotage speed.
---
* Unlocked on Shape at level 40
---
Myers with noed deserves 0 kills. Really not needed on Myers at all.
---
I was sure it doesn't, but McLean answered that there is no healing speed cap, so I guess I was wrong and it should stack
---
Imagine camping someone just because they spammed crouch a few times LMAO 
---
((Hex:Huntress Lullaby)) 
---
don‚Äôt get it then lmao
---
No man :) Mirkwood elves are badass, Nazgul are plain bad
---
I know smh they should 
---
Idk I never noticed haha! Good point my native language is Spanish so my English typing isn‚Äôt the best. I do see the error of my ways and feel quite dumb now. 
---
Wraith and spirit
---
People have a really weird tendency if there is a repost that they have not seen yet. Then they will downboat people into oblivion cause in their head it is "I have not seen it, so it is new and fun. How dare you say anything else!!!"  
---
Have seen that a few times actually. Not just on myself. But when people called out reposts. To be fair this isn't "exactly" a repost, but its a similar deal. Like even /u/anarchy753 who simply posted the original and didn't complain or say anything bad got downvoted for no reason.
---
It's alright, everyone makes a few mistakes every now and then
---
wow the pig got a pretty strong buff huh

---
Don‚Äôt be surprised if I get one hit down due to cleaning totems potentially being a huge waste of time and or detriment to the team due to gens not being done efficiently enough. K.
---
Even if you knew the killer had noed, when the killer is good at the game you are fucking yourself by spending time doing a secondary objective due to how fast paced the game. If matches lasted 12-20 minutes on average maybe you‚Äôd have a point. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to, that‚Äôs the problem. The fact that as survivor in the current meta you basically are required to gen rush to beat the better killers is super annoying and unreasonable imo. 
---
It‚Äôs the same as back at release when tunneling was so used because if you didn‚Äôt tunnel you didn‚Äôt kill.
---
I should mention I do cleanse totems when I come across them and more often then not it creates problems for my team when the killer has an average or higher iq lvl and aren‚Äôt playing like 4 heads. 
---
Wdym by you doubt we‚Äôd end up on the same team? I don‚Äôt get the point here. 
---
Ye, reddit was slow as fuck. Seems to be fixed now.
---
Yeah because survivors already earn too many bloodpoints..
---
Trust me he‚Äôs really not broken. He isn‚Äôt really that good in a chase and his power is weaker. While yes his frenzy is great in a chase it doesn‚Äôt last long enough so he can still get looped. Plus in order to use the power effectively he has to constantly end chases otherwise it doesn‚Äôt work. He‚Äôs probably somewhere in midtier
---
Satisfying 
---
He might be the worst killer(still freddy) but he breaks the game entirely.Just like nurse.But nurse actually is hurt by stealth but legion sees all when he hits one guy.Stealth isnt viable.Looping isnt viable.You are going down when you are in a chase with him.No matter how good you are.Thats a fucking big problem.
---
What's wrong with adrenaline 
---
survivors literally just got some buffs, too. the user base here is delusional
---
I screen recorded the video off YouTube and trimmed it. Then I used Mematic on iOS. You can also use Memes on iOS. Bot are pretty good
---
Please tell me you escaped :o
---
Great, thanks anyway
---
It‚Äôs another word for a rank up point. 
---
I had a fun match like that. I went against 3 (2 or 3, not quite sure anymore) man swf with bming like crazy whilst I was just farming Bloodpoints at the event. (Beast of Prey and Distressing SUPER OP on Legion) After the match I wrote my GG and headed off into the next game...  
---
to be matched with the same exact SWF. Switched to Myers with Infinite Tier 3 and Ebony Mori. I ended up killing 3 of them and gave hatch to the last guy.  
---
You know what was actually the best part about all this? The post game chat of the second game. I mentioned I want to be nice, but just had to mock the bming people from last game back a bit to let them taste their own medicine, all in good fun. I actually made friends with those 3 guys after we both pissed each other of for a match. That was very fucking wholesome.
---
I didn‚Äôt know women could play this game, also that‚Äôs not face camping, kitchen-aid. 
---
I've heard good things about aae.
---
Found the rank 20.
---
**BBQ:**  
---
* (Full name: Barbecue and Chilli) After hooking a Survivor, all other Survivors' Auras are revealed to you for 4 seconds when they are farther than 52/46/40 metres from the Hook .
---
Each time a Survivor is hooked for the first time, gain a 15/20/25 % stackable bonus to all Bloodpoint gains. The bonus Bloodpoints are only awarded post-trial. 
---
* Unlocked on Cannibal at level 35
---
**Wake Up:**  
---
* Once all Generators are powered, Exit Gates are revealed to you when within 24/48/? metres of range.
---
While opening the Exit Gates, reveal your Aura to other Survivors within 24/48/? metres of range.
---
While Wake Up! is active, you open the Exit Gates 5/10/15 % faster. 
---
* Unlocked on Quentin at level 30
---
When everyone is saying that healing speeds don't stack but they do. Trust me, I do run Botany Knowledge, We'll make it, Self Care and Streetwise, with a purple medkit and 2 charge addons. Fun fact, that makes self caring faster then if you let your team mates do it
---
&gt; and be at the other side
---
This means literally nothing. Killers always had the capability to hit through windows, even without you vaulting through first
---
I want you to try something. Load up a kill your friends lobby. I want you to play killer. find a window with a friend. have them stand on one side of it (don't have them vault though - just stand on one stand). i want you to stand on the other side. swing your weapon at them. they will get it. just because you fault through a window does not mean you are out of range.
---
**StakeOut:**  
---
* (Full name: Stake Out) For each 15 seconds you are standing within the Killer's Terror Radius and are not in a Chase, you gain a Token up to a maximum of 2/3/4 Tokens.
---
When Stake Out has at least 1 Token, Good Skill Checks are considered Great Skill Checks and consume 1 Token. 
---
* Unlocked on Tapp at level 40
---
Let's just say prove thyself is stupid broken.  Combined with already existing ways to increase gen speed, toxic SWF got a huge buff.
---
(As Killer) You swap place with a survivor
---
-Secret
---
Would ruin the fun to SWF xD
---
I need to make the swf pay for them having friends damnit. 
---
I had one legion yesterday and I ran him around for like 1 min. I finally went down by the basement then he face camped me for the entire hook. It was v fun gameplay.
---
So you‚Äôre saying they should remove the teachable mechanic and just make every perk purchasable? Sounds boring to me, makes progression in certain characters a bit pointless.
---
Happens to me 24/7
---
I wish I had your faith. I have none lol
---
So goodbye looping?
---
I mean... true, but its also the only way to make that perk viable rn
---
This is Legion we're talking about.
---
100% sure they can open both gates before he downs her again
---
No I'm saying it's pointless for me to buy a dlc and put over a million blood points into a killer that I wont play for one perk. I didnt level hag for ruin because i dont like playing her. Same with huntress or nurse (I'm on console). 
---
Pig mains look hot
---
Honestly simply increasing its rarity won‚Äôt make up for how broken the addon really is....
---
I mean he is pretty broken if people case you backwards. 
---
susie because she‚Äôs thicc
---
The problem with Legion isn't about him being Overpowered or Underpowered, it's about him breaking core gameplay mechanics.
---
Chases happened one way before him, now he's just going to catch you. Pallets and windows used to be a delay for killers, now they speed him up. Stealth was a viable tactic for a few players per game, now it's not. 
---
Whether they make him stronger or weaker, he's just not a well designed killer. 
---
1. Forgot about rank, it means nothing
---
2. Perks are nice but not really needed. I have done a few rank reset challenges where I got from 15 to 1 with no perks and its not really that hard tbh. 
---
3. The main killer is random team mates. They will get you killed for more by doing stupid things or getting down right at the start because they seen far too many montages from Noob3 and think they the shit but end up getting rekt.
---
4. For survival, learn the maps, pallets/windows patterns (Tiles) how to loop and mind game. 
---
5. Learn to not farm team mates, priorities of saving and completing gens. Personally I make sure 2 gens are always done before I rescue anyone, unless they nearby.
---
6. Just play the game, putting in time and learning is the biggest factor in becoming a better survivor
---
Dam
---
some rank 1s ARE the same as rank 20s so yeah, rank doesn‚Äôt equal skill
---
Im going to have to disagree here. Cowboy hat Billy is one of the best cosmetics in the game imo.
---
Man those are killer shots
---
Came to post this lol
---
First of all, it's basically face camping and, second of all, kitchen aid? 
---
I forgot how ((rancor)) works exactly but it's my main killer perk
---
blink to the point where they became hidden, then use the second blink to get them.
---
.
---
**Rancor:**  
---
* Each time a Generator is completed, the Obsession sees your Aura for 5/4/3 seconds.
---
Each time a Generator is completed, all Survivors' locations are revealed to you for 3 seconds.
---
Once all Generators are completed, the Obsession has the Exposed Status Effect and the Killer can kill the Obsession.
---
* Unlocked on Spirit at level 40
---
Uh. I‚Äôm obviously addressing those who do?
---
But you had shit ton of eboni mori and rare addons while all survivors were getting were firecrackers so...
---
((Prove thyself))
---
The best perk in the game
---
**Prove Thyself:**  
---
* Receive an incremental speed bonus to repairing, healing, sabotaging, cleansing, opening Exit Gates and searching Chests when other Survivors are within 8 metres of range.
---
1 nearby Survivor grants 1/2/3 % increased speed. 2 nearby Survivors grant 2/4/6 % increased speed. 3 nearby Survivors grant 3/6/9 % increased speed.  
---
* Unlocked on Dwight at level 35
---
I want new game modes.
---
It‚Äôs the most annoying thing in the game, you almost get some one down and then all of a sudden a gen is done and your back to stage 1 especially if they were on a hook before and they get off at full
---
hope for humanity: #restored#
---
But that would be hilarious
---
I thought he was broken trash ?
---
Yeah you are right. I just don't know how to buff the exit gate opening times so that its fair for killer and survivor. Is opening the exit gate 50% faster too much? Is it worth it?
---
Yes PC players console players can aim. 
---
I feel this way about the surveillance buff.  
---
It will be more common because of the rank reset this Sunday. People are shitty.
---
Legion is pretty weak, but with purple addons, he is pretty strong. His addons need rework
---
Depends on how much you play. The more the faster. And also of what use does it matter?
---
really?
---
&gt; enjoy your DCs for fucking over your remaining survivors
---
&gt; Thanks!
---
Choose your words better, then, to avoid confusion. For example:
---
"Legion players enjoy their DCs for fucking over the remaining survivors"
---
It's much less accusatory than using the article "your", which implies you are directing your comment at me. So, no, it wasn't obvious.
---
I forgot to put a huge dick on him.
---
Even now with the addition of the NOTIFICATION that the person unhooking you has We'll Make It, every rank 20 player will still run away from you until they reach a pallet or the corner of the map. Frustrates me to no end. \~w\~
---
Mori?
---
Does Redtube really need to be called out specifically as NSFW?
---
It‚Äôs not really entirely pointless though. It has a perk you want, which is a reason for levelling him. Otherwise, why would you ask for it in the shrine?
---
If you play for 3 hours a day, about a month I'd suppose
---
And this time, detective... He. Did. Die...
---
Yeah, understanding both sides and knowing what the other sees is very helpful
---
Well I didnt ask for it. That was OP. And i dont level killers i dont play. 
---
Gotcha I didn‚Äôt even think about that. 
---
So what you are saying is BHVR is giving us exactly what we asked for? Its a nerf to SWF who go in and heal each other all the time without penalising solos who might actually need to heal themselves every time. Well played BHVR.
---

---
This would actually be helpful if it were updated when the shrine was. 
---
You'll have to crop the bottom a bit. I left in some white.
---
That would be amazing. Imagine trying to create the worst killer build possible just for this reason.
---
People saying Legion is low tier or trash, no folks. Listen, we were all too quick to judge. The Legion is A tier or better. Legion can slow the game so much, ignore stealth, loops, and basically all mechanics that would normally hinder a killer. Legion has no way to counterplay at all. Legion can literally hit you once and moonwalk chase you with bloodhound until you die and there‚Äôs nothing you can do.
---
What are the buffs?
---
Don‚Äôt complain about it then.
---
Wanted to get enough shards for the future Feng cosmetic
---

---

---
ITS POSSIBLE WITH HUNTRESS. PERSISTENCE MY FRIEND, DONT GIVE UP. NOT NURSE THOUGH. SHES BUGGY AF 
---
How was I complaining? Did you read anything I wrote? Also where do you get off trying to tell me what to do? 
---
Cause that the clothing they wore in the movie.
---
It's a glitch that occasionally happens, at least for ps4
---
Do you reckon this PTB has just broken the game? From what I've read there's a general consensus that the changes are just bad....the only exception I see to this is surveillance but that's now a little broken too...
---
I love when I get that glitch for my bloodweb, it looks so cool
---
THE LEADER CHANGE IS A MASSIVE BUFF TO EVERYTHING ELSE, AND PROVE THY SELF IS AS SITUATIONAL AS LEADER WAS, BUT MORE POWERFUL. THE SELF CARE CHANGE IS JUST STRAIGHT UP A HUGE BUFF. SC+BK IS NOW BETTER THAN FINDING AN ALLY.
---
SURVIVOR ITEMS AND KILLER LOADOUTS ARE NOT COMPARABLE. AND I WOULD RATHER THEY DODGE THE FLASHLIGHT IN LOBBY THAN DC IN THE MATCH. AND THE NEW MATCHMAKING WILL HIDE SWFS. BUT NOW THEY NEED TO ADD THE ABILITY FOR KILLERS TO BLOCK THEM AND GIVE INCENTIVES FOR PLAYING AGAINST THEM. SURVIVORS CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE BECAUSE IT WOULD LITERALLY BREAK THE GAME.
---
LEGION'S NEVER HAD TO WAIT FOR HIS POWER, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
---
Love her streams.
---
Good bot.
---
Upon uncrouching, Pig's terror radius now gradually fades in over a period of a few seconds, whereas before it was being completely suppressed for that transition period. This diminishes Pig's surprise grab and hit possibilities.
---
I haven't really tested around with this, but to me this seems like quite a nerf. The 32m terror radius as opposed to 28m also removed the Whispers interaction where you could crouch as soon as Whispers activated and the survivor it activated on would at no point get a hearbeat.
---
Level 30 perks are green at tier 3. Level 35 and 40 perks are purple at tier 3. For whatever reason.
---
Exactly, would love to watch its progress and how it handles all the different mechanics, would it camp/tunnel? Would it acknowledged BM? How would it spend its blood points, what perks/addons would it decide were the most efficient? As far as facing it at its "peak" I'd give it a shot knowing I'd lose still be curious to see how it reacts to the various scenarios human killers deal with. 
---
((Surveillance))
---
How did a rank 7 get in this match?
---
**Surveillance:**  
---
* All regressing Generators will be highlighted by a white Aura . Once regression ends, Generators will be highlighted by a yellow Aura for 8/12/16 seconds.

---
I honestly don't care, I'm a rank 1 usually but I haven't played in a while
---
Is it like a reskin of the halloween event then
---
Except Laurie, Kate, and Ace, for example lol
---
Last time I got shit-talked for this was when I played silent bell wraith with NOED and ruin. And just like last time, it was from the DS,self-care, dead hard, adrenaline hypocrisy thy name is claudette main. I didn't even get to use NOED and she was complaining.
---
who needs eyes when you have aesthetic 
---
..and that's it. Otherwise , no, he isn't impossible to win against. Although there's no hard counters, there are ways to outplay the legion significantly. 
---
Do gens separately to avoid multiple deep wounds.
---
If you know someone is going to get deep wounded, stay away so they can't track you too, it's that easy.
---
Don't heal. Focus generators. Healing takes too long and they'll probably just deep wound you again anyways. 
---
If you follow these guidelines you'll likely win. 
---
..and about how they apparently 2k constantly.. IF that was the case, it's not a bad thing. Killers SHOULD get kills, that's the whole point, not every survivor is going to escape every game. If every survivor escaped every game that would show major flaws in a killer, like Freddy.
---
Yea pretty much
---
Ohhh lmfao. Whenever I use it I balance it out by not running Self Care. I don't run self care in general though, wastes time and is just a boring way to play imo.
---
UNDER THE HOOK IS FINE IF THE KILLER ISN'T NEAR, AND BEST IF THE UNHOOKER ALSO HAS WE'LL MAKE IT.
---
Fast as fuck boi
---
I think it does too much. Killer reveal is good as is breaking the hook. Tied together it's a bit much.
---
I did actually manage to wiggle out of a Killer's grasp once thanks to breakdown and my SWF ally bodyblocking for me. The Killer was a Twitch Streamer and me and my friend both went to his stream to give him a GG. My friend talked about his bodyblock and the streamer said "yeah I also fucked up a bit at the first because I was going to put your friend on the hook he was just on but I forgot he had breakdown" and I think the Final Fantasy Victory Music played in my head when he said that.
---
This is a click-bait. I was expecting short shorts or something. Having said that, I encourage these people. It would be boring if everyone wore the same dark brown/black clothes all the time to blend in.
---
Oh shit didn‚Äôt even notice and I‚Äôm a Kate main.
---
Very fair. I agree completely. 
---
It just serves to slow the game down to an unnecessary extent, and the idea that you have to do *poorly* to succeed against Freddy is stupid.
---
I have a lot of opinions on how to rework Freddy so I won't go into them here.
---

S E N T I E N C E
---
"Gen Rushing" is fine because it is the survivor's only objective but the term arises from the idea that currently gens get done too fast which is a different argument entirely. I really hope they add another objective within the game like the event pimples that really incentivizes survivors to do something else and maybe killers won't feel like they have to run ruin and gamble on the totem every single game.
---
Now for my actual unpopular opinions
---
Tunneling isn't toxic  99% of the time because it's generally the optimal way to win the game. The sooner survivors are dead the slower gens progress. If I see the recently unhooked injured dude hiding behind a tree self caring and another healthy survivor clicking a flashlight begging me to follow them, I am going to go for a quick down and 1 step closer to a won game as opposed to wasting half the rest of the match chasing and 1 hooking so everyone can take their turns. If you don't want me to hook you then don't stick around and let me catch you.  
---
I actually cannot think of a perk I want to see nerfed right now. Meta perks are fine and there will always be "best" perks that players will slot in if they don't wanna make a build of their own. I'd like to see weaker perks buffed so they can shine in specific builds instead of nerfing either side entirely by making their best perks shittier. 
---
The hatch is fucking garbage and needs to be changed ASAP. I just hate playing as either side, it's just me and you and now we stare at each other until one of us decides winning isn't worth it. If survivor finds it first I have no problem, they won. If killer finds the hatch first then there's nothing to do about it because leaving to find the survivor might be forfeiting the kill so time to wait. If the survivor goes and does a gen then I will still find them and here we are again at the hatch stand off.  Maybe give killers the ability to close it temporarily, a 30 seconds to a minute at a time so they can leave the area and after it opens again there's a cooldown on how long until they can close it? Maybe they can only close it so many times? IDK what to do but the hatch isn't skill-testing or fun for anyone.

((ACE IN THE HOLE))
---
Thats just the way the cookie crumbles.
---
**Ace In The Hole:**  
---
* When retrieving an Item from a Chest, there is a 100 % chance that an Add-on of Very Rare Rarity or lower will be attached to it. 
---
10/25/50 % chance to find a second Add-on of Uncommon Rarity or lower. 
---
* Unlocked on Ace at level 40
---
&gt;Explains the joke
---
I don't recommend hiding in corners like that. Easy way to get yourself bodyblocked
---
Love it, can't wait for the spirit render, my wallet is waiting for that skin.
---
Or just flat out remove them.
---
Everything I've seen has been generally positive, outside of complaints about Legion.
---
It‚Äôs not rank 20 either, if you‚Äôre rank one it usually brings you to about 12-13 I believe
---
Never had a problem with pallets, but windows damn the amount of chainsaws or hits way after was rediculous 
---
Taking a guess, but after studying this picture for 20 minutes I can safely confirm that he is not the Wraith.
---
*wheeze*
---
I wouldn't call it a repost if its got a different title and a different joke 
---
Hmmm... Interesting thought. I don't wanna get my hopes up, but if we did get another crossover "Paragraph DLC," I'd pop off so hard.
---
Oh please tell me you escaped. 
---
Balanced landing?
---
I couldn't give a shit what you think either, at meast the youtubers have experience in the game and aren't huge pricks like yourself.
---
Rank 1 puts you to ten with two pips I believe. 
---
That claudette though.
---
No they new just did not want to take a chance of losing. The other night my friend and I kept getting the worst teammates. One dude would wait so long to pull you off the hook the killer had already come back from being looped and he would attempt to pull you basically with the killer right on you. He waited so long to pull my friend off the hook that while the other random survivor was being chased I had opened a gate and picked up the Random when he got downed while the killer was actually looking for me. He waited until the killer came back to my hooked friend before he tried and got downed. I then had to give it a shot but I was full health and got downed instantly even though the killer did not have noed somehow.
---
The one that survived didn't say much either
---
Thanks!
---
(also for markdown urls the format is [text here](url here) so you got the text&gt;url part right, but it's brackets then parenthesis as well. Hope that helps :) ) 
---
Get over yourself buddy. Sorry for your misguided view on seemingly everything. You seem like the kind of person whos really cool at parties.
---
Do you have an API of some sort that will update your bot when changes are made to perks or will you have to do manual updates?
---
everytime we get this map we fight to see whos going to go pet the horse first
---
You don't even need to do that anymore with Frank's Mixtape. 
---
You don't understand probability.  That is okay.  Most don't.  While each attempt is 4% base, when you have multiple attempts, you have a greater chance of ANY of them succeeding.   
---
.96 * .96 *.96 = ~.885  or an 88.5% chance that you will fail all three attempts. 
---
It is essentially the same as the drop rate calculator for World of Warcraft/any mmo.
---
To clarify with the Self-Care changes, the way I read it means that the Healing Speed Decrease now applies to ALL heals. This speed decrease only applies to people that are actively using Self-Care. I don't have a PC, so if any PTB player could confirm or deny, that would be nice.
---
Random cornfield hits are awesome as everyone. Was playing Billy on Rotten Fields yesterday and Discordance proced alerting me to 2+ Survivors on a gen across the field. So I revved up and Sprinted for it. Only got about 30 meters before there was suddenly screaming and blood. I'd found an invisible Claudette hiding in the corn, lol.
---
My poor little bot's post was actually being downvoted and had a negative score, so of course I had to defend her.
---
Oh, nice!
---
Ok... What does ((Surveillance)) do?
---
Because I saw it in the trigger list and I'm curious what it returns: ((perkybot)) 
---
I almost thought this was a human, good thing it is beep booping
---
Trying to be really positive here.
---
Amazing!
---
I mean the bot, not the perk... Although it will definitely get better in the next patch.
---
Maybe you have to actually go and place the hex in a dull totem spot for it to activate. So instead of Hexes starting off activated the killer needs to find a dull totem and turn it into a hex.
---
Bill is PC exclusive and launches with the game. 
---
because u play swf
---
Python? No problem.
---
Markdown? Fuck that shit, I'm not a rocket scientist.
---
Thanks :D
---
I can at least give my reasoning for not liking most of them but I guess if the only thing you have is an insult then I won the argument.
---
Buffs? Terror radius gets up 2 seconds earlier after uncrouching, so grabs were hard before the update, but are just impossible now.
---
And Jigsaw Boxes now always spawn too far from each other making JB Camping tactics not relevant.
---
Not even talking about terror radius.
---
Is your flair supposed to be legion
---
TIL Laurie was the legions teacher.
---
Number 4, reporting.
---
then people would know to not bother checking places like the corn field, and open spots on the game, which could possibly cause the hex to be found faster.
---
Well i played solo
---
Relevant username. 
---
How does deranking mean jack shit skill-wise, but you have to be braindead to not safety pip?  Those seem to conflict.
---
That said, it's pretty easy to not safety pip on survivor if you happen to get caught early and camped.  That thankfully isn't the norm though.
---
Take my internet point
---
Its totally possible they didnt want to risk it, but I think its also partly bc they were all randos and just thought someone else would go for the unhook (since a lot of survivors drop everything for the unhook points).
---
In-built kindred when??
---
Rip tho those kind of teammates uhhhhh fuckin suck 
---
The audio issues are mostly fixed in the ptb. Playing Spirit isn't terrible anymore and in general it just feels better than it does currently.
---
#OMEGALMAO
---
((NOED)) = (NO ADD) = NOD HEAD 
---
I'm not countering anything, I'm participating in this threat you created. 
---
Abridged version please?  
---
Ya depends on if you want teachable perks or cosmetics. I personally dont ge the cosmetics because they cost alot of shards and they are hard to come by so I buy the teachables
---
No build at all? I don‚Äôt know about any killer perks that are not better than nothing (like no mither for survivors).
---
The 2 seconds are only the slow fading in/out effect of the TR. You should get a grab in about 2-3 seconds to begin with so it's totally unaffected by it (and I saw a lot of streamers who were able to get the grabs just fine too).
---
Camping JB boxes isn't really relevant to begin with. The traps are for wasting time, not for killing (troll camping them is still possible very much). It was never effective in the first place. 
---
The terror radius? They just even the odds. Every 4.6 m/s killer has a 32m terror radius now. Most pigs use M&amp;A+Whispers anyway to see when to sneak and when not to, which is even easier by the faster fading out of the terror radius.
---
The main ability, the dash, received a solid QoL buff (not depending on Combat Straps that much anymore).
---
If you think this was an overall nerf to Pig, I've got bad news for you. 
---
Play both sides, and watch Youtube videos on different killers. Knowing how each killer operates will help you how to counterplay them effectively.
---
I would recommend watching Monto, (For different perk builds for both survivor and killer) Noob3, (For survivor plays) and Ardetha (For learning about how to play both survivor and killer effectively)
---
Using knowledge from both your own experience and from others will help you become a better survivor.
---
They need to be mindful of this with future licensed killers. Cosmetics should be a part of the negotiation process from the beginning. 
---
If they charge for the additional skins, they will make more money. 
---
Uhh, you literally just voiced your disagreements with most of what I posted. 
---
As much as it may be fucked up, this actually looks fucking sick. 
---
I now you can grind shards for some of the cosmetics in the store but I find going for achievements a bit more fun.
---
Oh yah purple windstorm and purple shadowdance with BBQ feels like straight heroin
---
Number 5, so hard. So many games I play solo, where me and maybe one other teammate has been hooked twice already, while the rest havent even been chased. It sucks seeing those teammates crouch nearby as youre getting downed again, waiting to go save but guess what, I'm dead on hook
---
well this screenshot was taken when it went from darker to brighter and I cought it roughly in the middle of that... trust me... you dont wanna see full brightness...
---
Legion mains rise up
---
I want boat gen to be a beautiful meme that lives on
---
we get it, you‚Äôve seen bird box
---
what's normally supposed to summon it?
---
Everyone mistakes the 100% cap on WMI as a healing cap and not a cap to the perk's specific buff. It maxes at 100% but still stacks with everything else.
---
Perks?
---
Not the perk it encourages body blocking which is the most agitating thing in the game it‚Äôs the reason I always carry ((iron grasp)) and ((agitation))
---
I honestly thought it was from the blackout club, since ideas are mildly similar
---
Don't get caught and fucked up
---
While the wraith is cloaked you can shine a flash light anywhere on his cloaked form and "burn" him out of his cloaked state that causes a stun on him.
---
Basically I personally think that the new meta is gonna promote a different playstyle and way more fun both from killer and survivor side, and also it's gonna fix a lot of balance issues like gen rushing and tunneling. Legion's gonna be really good with this meta too IF played like they should be supposed to be played (no tunneling and proxy-chasing)
---
**Iron Grasp:**  
---
* Effects of Survivor struggling are reduced by 25/50/75 %.
---
Time to struggle out of your grasp is increased by 4/8/12 %. 
---
Haha sucker 
---
also you can hear gens from farther away
---
Hybridpanda does a weekly shrine video on his YouTube channel.
---
But then you could have reverse psychology. Nobody ever checks there, so the survivors won't either. 
---
Yeah, there were some perk changes too. Surveillance is actually useful now 
---
*Exchanges detail for neon yellow glow*
---
I like the idea, but I would think the others in the group would team with the killer and go 4v1 against the person who used the offering. 
---
Also you can't even blame YouTubers for being "toxic" most of the tine they use perks that have no corralation to eachother like all exhaustian to keep it interesting for the audience. I cant think of any youtuber except ochido who only posts toxic videos of dbd. 
---
I don't have the account details, so I'll have to wait for my dad to get back and sort it out. I think I'll be getting a vpn for this in the future 
---
 I‚Äôm in, what‚Äôs your PSN Name? 
---
Legion- Yes
---
üòÇ that‚Äôs not even fair! Those poor guys
---
Plot twist: Entity speak is actually the dragon language and the Entity is actually the love-child of Hermaeous Mora and Molag Bal. 
---
Change my mind. 
---
Any one knows what the cosmetic coming out looks like?
---
I think hook rushing is the mild equivalent of what we call "tunneling"
---
Rush that first fucker to death on the hook rather than target anyone else.
---
Maybe not, but nevertheless really cool to me for some reason.
---
true... and all you need is a broken graphics card! PogChamp
---
And then killer finds me is the spilling cereal on myself
---
Slightly = 1%, Moderately = 2%, Considerably = 3%. At least, according to the wiki.
---
Got mine last night against a bot. Goodluck!
---
I‚Äôm down but I can‚Äôt get on until like 8pm EST. Message me if you still need someone by then.
---
Doesn't her hair stand straight up when she's isn't faking it?   
---
That's at least how I can tell when my gf is faking it or not.
---
Pretty good job so far üëåüèº
---
That's the toxic ones. My swf team plays for fun and we don't really care about winning cx just here to have fun. 
---
Body blocking bear traps mega brain 
---
That's like 2o'clock in the morning at my place üòÖ 
---
The best way so far that I‚Äôve found is to put a survivor on the most open hook you can find and then just wait till someone comes to get them and be far as fuck away. Lol
---
With permission you can do anything you want.
---
I wonder if ((BBQ)) works?
---
* (Full name: Barbecue and Chilli) After hooking a Survivor, all other Survivors' Auras are revealed to you for 4 seconds when they are farther than 52/46/40 metres from the Hook.
---
Damn. Good luck then!
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that defeat their purpose tho. Iridescent shards are already the grind currency
---
If you spam Flashlights during Pallet Break and Tbag after you used your shitty DS, you deserve to get facecamped.
---
If you facecamp without being griefed, you deserve to get all the unfun Surv stuff done to you.
---
NOBODY AT RANK 13 KNOWS HOW TO PLAY AGAINST FREDDY. AND I'M NOT TALKING STRATEGY, THEY JUST DON'T KNOW HOW HE FUCKING WORKS. IT TOOK A SURVIVOR A SOLID MINUTE TO FIGURE OUT I WANTED HIM TO WAKE ME UP. ANOTHER SURVIVOR REFUSED TO LET ME WAKE HIM UP, AND INSTEAD BLEW A SKILL CHECK ON MY GEN SLOWING DOWN MY PROGRESS. THEY WOULDN'T WAKE ME UP EITHER, AND HID IN A LOCKER IMMEDIATELY AFTER UNHOOKING. I MANAGED TO ESCAPE, BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE I LOOPED LONG ENOUGH FOR MR. POTATO HEAD TO FINISH THE LAST GEN, THEN OLE FREDERICK WENT FOR THE OTHER GUY BECAUSE IT'D BE EASIER.
---
Woah, that's rough
---
The point was, we‚Äôve all gotten 4 mans before
---
Thank you ^^
---
Wanted to use no mither to challenge myself and ended up getting facecamped in a 3v1 ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ended up being MVP while one of my teammates escaped via the hatch
---
What does ((discordance)) do?
---
**Discordance:**  
---
* Any time two or more Survivors are working on the same Generator, that Generator's Aura is highlighted in yellow for 8/10/12 seconds. 
---
* Unlocked on Legion at level 30
---
Yeah, Nurse is tough, but keep on practicing and I'm sure you'll get more and more consistent with her!
---
How the hell did you get looped for 3 minutes on tires? Were you circling the tires a mile away from their hitbox? Or did you just whiff so many times? 
---
You don't need any skill with Legion in the chase side, but you do for the " making decision" side. I agree that Legion chases has no counterplay, but it usually takes a good amount of time for them to get you EXCEPT if they are running Frank's Mixtape and/or they're proxy chasing. The difference from a bad Legion and a good Legion is that one will tunnel and focus one single survivor, making the game unfun for him and potentially losing the game due to gens, and the other will try to involve everyone doing pressure, and keeping the game way more dynamic, fun and intense
---
^ but originally from skyrim
---
What is the sound now?
---
Definitely this. I wouldn't say it's OP, but it's just in those games where you manage to get a bunch of injuries but not downs, and right before you get a down they finish the last gen three people heal to full. It kicks you when you're down.
---
Technically you are correct, but my idea of "adding cosmetics" would skirt that issue, by adding additional copyrighted designs. i.e. different movie designs.   
---
I.E. - If they added Pennywise - TV movie look and theatrical movie look. Two different skins for one character to choose from.
---
Either way, all thing are negotiable, so even then, going with non-copyrighted looks would be more difficult to agree upon, but not impossible. It's all money driven, which is why a copyright is (typically) created in the first place. 
---
No mither? +1 respect
---
Would have
---
he is broken trash until he kills you, then he becomes OP and the best killer in the game
---
Even as killer the boat gen going off makes me happy.
---
I wish we had hook cosmetics that can be shared so you could have stylish hooks. I would love hooks spray painted with Legion on it or hooks with little mini Freddy‚Äôs on them. 
---
Idk man, keeping your own database updated is a pain in the ass.
---
IT TAKES LIKE FUCKING 5 SECONDS WITH WE'LL MAKE IT. IF THE KILLER GETS HERE IN 5 SECONDS WE WEREN'T MAKING IT TO A PALLET  ANYWAYS.
---
((alert)) ((wglf)) 
---
Don't mind me, just testing stuff.
---
Even with 10FPS
---
I forgot something. Does it have to be a random online match to let the achievement count? I thought that I could just search for 4 people and start a private match like kill your friends
---
You know, the original survivor running animation was *very* similar to this.
---
‚Ä¢Play both sides, as a killer, you‚Äôll know what are the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù gen to go to. As a survivor, don‚Äôt do a gen right away, most killer will check out every gen until they hear/see one that‚Äôs being worked on. 
---
‚Ä¢Pay attention to the obsession if your not it. When the obsession is being chased, the spider legs on the sides will start to move and you‚Äôll be safe to start a gen
---
‚Ä¢At the beginning of the game, don‚Äôt run right away, it will leave scratch marks. Most killers are tall and they will see those scratch mark easily
---
‚Ä¢Survivors are just skins but each one has their different perk, unlock as much as you can. You only need to level them up to level 40 to unlock all 3 perk for all survivors. 
---
‚Ä¢Some perks I recommend is Urban Evasion  which you can find on Nea along with Balance Landing which is also unlockable by Nea. Another one is Self Care which is great because you don‚Äôt have to carry a medic with you in game, you can just heal yourself. Self Care is unlock by getting Claudette to level 40. 
---
That all I got for you right now, I can carry on but I‚Äôll be typing all day and I‚Äôm currently at work. I‚Äôm rank 10 Survivor and rank 5 killer. If you need anymore tips let me know and I‚Äôll see what else I can tell you 
---
ive been at rank 1 for a while and the only time i get face camped is when i run the killer around for a very long time.  Its rare but it happens sometimes
---
SCP 096
---
Yes has happened to me. This is why I hate this mechanic. Just make me hold a button or do skill checks not tap, lag and shit make me lose to often.
---
But I just hit rank 1 just 20 mins ago with bacon boi
---
You don‚Äôt need to see killers to loop they have a red stain for a reason I do it all the time
---
Because that‚Äôs what trolls do.
---
Pretty sure you can get suspended/banned for mori spamming sooo probably shouldn't do that
---
Rank does indicate *something*, I'm just not sure what that thing is. Experience? Game knowledge? I don't know. Whatever it is, a player's skill is only a small portion of what rank communicates.
---
And what is "skill" anyway? Is the survivor skilled at escaping or skilled at pipping? Which one is winning? Well, whatever. Point is: rank represents something other than skill, by and large.
---
I've never played Skyrim so wouldn't have known ¬Ø\_(0~0)_/¬Ø
---
Well idk about survivors because you can get boosted but im mainly talking about killers since they can get boosted 
---
I also don't care about escaping. I care about playing well...
---
But once he hits you twice with Frank's mixtape and you can't see anything because of deepwound VFX, and you know he just has to wait 10s to down you with his power you loose the will to play against him.
---
Even without addons it just takes a while more but it's inevitable.
---
I hope at least they change the moonwalking stuff with a fixed distance within which deepwound doesn't drain.
---
One time I had a pretty toxic Dwight looping me for a bit towards the end of a match, as soon as I got him down, he did a burpee and ran away as I was still cleaning my weapon. I was not able to secure that kill. I don't remember what my kill count was but I know I lost. Felt so shitty. 
---
Yeah everyone can get a little salty, especially when you‚Äôre playing Myers on corn maps against people that are good at looping, you aren‚Äôt gonna have a good game. We all get salty at that stuff, as it feels totally out of your control even though that match wasn‚Äôt particularly a testament of your skill. Tru3 is consistently nice and a good sport to everyone (except Ochido but that‚Äôs bc Ochido is a massive prick to him since tru3 has beat him multiple times) and handles situations where he gets stream snipers that try to piss him off really well. Overall I respect the guy majorly for the way he plays and handles his wins and his losses, even when the odds get unfairly stacked against him.
---
Camping doesn't need any "punishment", but I'm down with more anti-camping incentives. 
---
Myers is evolving his spook game
---
Thanks for the idea.
---
Well its the games fault. it heavily favors altruism over objectives for rank progresssion.  
---
 I have done 3+ gens, a few totems, and even lead a solid chance from the killer. All in one game, and still gotten 0 rank progression because I didnt get a hook save or much healing done.
---
The buff Myers needs
---
I agree , they definitely need to make those changes. I just don't agree that it's IMPOSSIBLE to escape. Sounds like an over exaggerated rant they're making after having one bad game against the legion.
---
I play on ps4 so we don‚Äôt get the PTB but I‚Äôm guessing the sound is back what it was. Hard to describe. Maybe someone can help me with how it sounds 
---
QUENTIN SENT ME
---
Targeting specific players to grief them is banable. So in theory just the act of mori spam would not get you banned. However, since doing that shit is most likely targeted at someone cause you want to piss them off or "punish" them it would usually result in a ban I would assume. 
---
((Dying light))
---
Ruin is the lunch money that gets stolen from you before you even get to school lol
---
Good boy
---
I just confirmed this, spamming a mori animation for more than a few seconds, so around 30s or more, can get you punished in one way or another. Whether it's a ban or a suspension, it can get you punished. 
---
Nord VPN with 3 year subscription is the best deal.
---
I have that and paid 80‚Ç¨ for 3 years of the best VPN (2‚Ç¨/month).
---
I hit Rank 1 on console in less than a month of playing before I started PC. Console is significantly easier for survivor. For killer it‚Äôs harder I‚Äôd say mostly because of optimization. Also since controlling a nurse is garbage on console, I can see why it‚Äôs much more difficult for console killers. 
---
True, but the amount shards you get is too little + you can't even buy everything unless you pay.
---
I think that‚Äôs the idea
---
its a test
---
I wish I could upvote this more then once 
---
It was a 3k beforehand, so I felt the guy should have points. I let him do three gens, then killed him at the end. He was fine with it after chat, surprisingly, so it all ended up well!
---
At first the opinion was that legion sucked, now people have found out you can moon walk cheese. I'm sure the devs will see how this breaks the game in the future and something will be done. 
---
I THOUGHT BT WOULD ACTIVATE 
---
"Fixed an issue" what issue? Nothing is wrong with the way it is now. Being carried off on silence after hearing your character scream for 20 minutes is a blessing. 
---
I disagree. 
---
I was excited for a second thinking that The Pig was getting a huntress skin... now I‚Äôm sad. 
---
It's funny how you're trying to defend this bullshit. Legion can literally down survivors now in one frenzy and you're trying to defend that. There is no counterplay here, the survivors can literally do nothing in "that" situation. Legions state at the release was pure bullshit, since he was so terribly designed, you could counter hsi entire kit by scattering or staying injured. But now he can end a chase in 4 seconds and as a survivors you lyerally "just have to accept the fact that you're going to be downed" 
---
PTB Legion is somehow even more terrible then release Legion. Legion is a terribe killer design overall, there is no inbetween with this killer. Either he literally breaks the game worse then Nurse can or he is downright terrible.
---
Anyone have a link to the Feng cosmetic, I needs it!
---
What trophy?
---
Same happened to me except I‚Äôm only rank 13 which isn‚Äôt as bad 
---
Killers don‚Äôt usually camp in the lower ranks. At least I would think they don‚Äôt.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Pop_Goes_The_Weasel
---
&gt; After hooking a Survivor, the next Generator you break is instantly regressed by 15/20/25 % of its total progression. 
---
&gt; Normal Generator regression applies after the damage is done.
---
&gt; Pop Goes The Weasel is active for 30 seconds after the Survivor is hooked.
---
Do you get any hidden luxuries with it? I see people talking about streaming shows and such, but not sure if there are that many things not in the us
---
Ear rape... Thanks....
---
This so called permission probably means a lot of paper work, so maybe that..
---
Uh yeah it‚Äôs an entity holiday! Did you not get my einvite?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs unpopular doesn‚Äôt mean people can‚Äôt say hey that‚Äôs not a great idea
---
1 looping would be sooo much more of a son of a bitch and 
---
2 no yes it would make 360 a viable option a way to viable option the game would turn to the killer desperately attempting to hit a survivor as they run around like an idiot being faster ain‚Äôt gonna stop the survivors from being able to stomp killers by dodging also in sorry but survivors wouldn‚Äôt need to 360 they‚Äôre only need to walk out of the way like how they do for Hillbilly or dash around a corner 
---
3 imagine how long a survivor could loop you around a t wall killer 
---
4 mind gaming by hiding their red stain wouldn‚Äôt be possible 
---
5 and imagine Nurse what the fuck would we do with her she wouldn‚Äôt be able to hit a single blink unless she perfectly landed next to them and even then it‚Äôs not confirmed she hit so what are we gonna give her the same speed as other killers 
---
6 you would not be able to challenge most pallets because your stuck not being able to round the corner to hit the survivor a survivor could loop you on a pallet and it would be impossible to mind game unless the survivor is stupid 
---
7 any chase in any type of wooded or cluttered area would be a nightmare 
---
8 it would be disorienting as fuck because you go for a lunge and miss because it would be easy ass to dodge and then you lose the survivor and have to regain your composure and locate the survivor again 
---
That is odd. Hexy on the podcast of Tofu said it cannot get you banned by the Devs definition. Did you ask support or what is the source?
---
Son of a bitch I thought it was spam! 
---
https://youtu.be/uMB3Jut1Fks
---
It‚Äôs an inverse relationship: as the number of flashlight Claudettes increases, the amount of killer fun decreases :P
---
It would be nice if it doubled BP in the boldness category.
---
Also she can get hits out of stealth sooooo yeah I‚Äôm sorry but Freddy will aways be the worst unless BHVR actually try‚Äôs to make a worse killer
---
tell that to the level 2 leatherface that rev camped me in the basement last night
---
The day I stopped trying to play by made up survivor/killer rules and play it as a pvp game it is meant to be is the day I started actually enjoying myself.
---
If I pick someone up and you unhook another guy, I will put him on the hook you just freed up and will instantly begin chase with someone nearby, maybe even the guy you were trying to ‚Äúgive time to run.‚Äù In any given scenario it is much better to let the killer move to another hook, especially since the hook changes and after the coming ones, although if there are survivors nearby I will leave the guy on the ground and chase the guy off, or if the hooked guy is approaching the struggle phase or is really close to sacrifice I will wait to hook the guy recently downed until the hooked survivor has hit that mark. If I make a bad play it‚Äôs silly to unhook straight away and reward me for doing something dumb.
---
Also it supports up to 5 devices at the same time so if the cost is too much you can split it with a friend.
---
I hit rank 1 killer yesterday for the first time exclusively using pig. And then I get buffs?! This is great
---
It's worth it
---
They should implement a dark themed one. Something that we can choose in the settings. Probably a darker red instead of white/yellow-ish color like blood clots.
---
It means literally nothing that their weapon is meaningless? That's just bad game design and that is a problem. You should be able to tell if something is going to hit you based on vision.
---
Also, It's still very inconsistent, and it is visbly terrible on half the killers.
---
the only people i've ever seen be insulting so far also don't want to say what you did wrong/what you could do to be better about it.
---
I mean, if you want to say that someone was bad, better to skip the insult phase and go straight into the "you can do X" phase...
---
These are things like, don't unhook if the killer is holding another player nearby, at best it just lets them put the other person on the hook, at worst he'll hit the guy being unhooked and get both of them.
---
Which gpu is it you have to rma?
---
How the fuck does someone even do this in DBD?
---
It can‚Äôt be private it must be a public match. I got this in a match where the killer was not attacking us and one of us had a key that opened the hatch so we all escaped safely.
---
Its like im playing against bots and i dont know why 
---
So my husband is obsessed with making the horn go off. No matter what, that is the first gen he goes to on that map. Even if the killer keeps coming there and hooking him. And then he gets so happy when he sounds the horn.
---
He was shocked when we played KYF on that map and I found and hooked him within 1 minute on that damn boat gen. 
---
Haven‚Äôt had this issue like at all. Seen a few try but I get away and heal just fine. 
---
Oh well isn‚Äôt that lovely. Thanks for telling me lol
---
Doing a speedtest with the nearest VPN server I got:
---
12ms ping, 259Mbps Download and 189Mbps Upload
---
I normally have without VPN:
---
1ms ping ~900Mbps Download ~200 Mbps Upload
---
that would be pretty awesome 
---
That presumed Dwight Jimmy Neutron is making me uncomfortable.

---
If you get hit then the Legion came out on top anyways. A good Legion knows that the lunge is far enough and is fast enough for you to hit someone and back up when they are on a pallet and dont get stunned
---
Actually just yesterday I played against a legion, cold dirt franks mixtape, tunneled a game, 3 Dwight‚Äôs, ( rank 3 ) Dwight‚Äôs did gens, I pallet looped, got hooked end game, no noed, Dwight‚Äôs body blocked, door open, borrowed time. Maybe it‚Äôs just cause they were really altruistic but I pooped the boi the entire game around like 2 pallets.
---
What am I looking at
---
Oh okay, maybe it's possible to convince the killer during the game though
---
Check names when you reply. I didn‚Äôt say I reward those who rat out survivors. If there‚Äôs two survivors left and one‚Äôs trying to do gens and make progress and the other goes super immersed, 10/10 I wanna kill the immersed guy. Can‚Äôt stand those teammates. 
---
Gonna add you! 
---
Killer facecamping for a single kill isn‚Äôt a win. It‚Äôs just one of his 4 objectives. It only becomes a win if the team of survivors fails to do something with it and all die one by one tryin to force a single save
---
I like how you've run out of argument so you've taken to cursing and calling me names.
---
Ok i know you‚Äôre just a little kid but you‚Äôre not making much sense. Freddy‚Äôs power slows the survivors down too, more so than Pigs power. Freddy‚Äôs power applies a massive debuff to survivors. Just putting a survivor to sleep slows them down more than a reverse bear trap
---
Yea, I feel like having it have a boldness bp gain would be great, I think survivors need more things that give them bp gains while also doing something useful. Bbq gives map wide vision pretty much while being a huge bp gain, and WGLF is strictly bp gain. And we all know survivors need more love in this department 
---
It was just supposed to be funny. 
---
If we dont find enough players tonight we will try tomorrow so I could add you anyway
---
I've read posts where the survivors sit there for minutes at a time. They need to leave on their own.
---
The "just cleanse totems" thing for NOED is dumb. You're better off on a solo basis just remembering where totems are, so come endgame you know where to search for one that's been lit - the killer will be too occupied with patrolling gates/hooks to protect the totem anyway. There's also that if you cleanse totems there might be one you don't find, and then come endgame you have a NOED in a difficult to find area and your time cleansing was wasted anyway.
---
Tbh, I‚Äôd play along if I was the killer. I‚Äôm a nice killer :3
---
No problem. Since the account was created today to agree with Panda on his controversial thread that died two days ago, I'm fairly positive it's him or one of his fans. I'm not remotely interested in starting a witch-hunt over a dumb totem argument, though. 
---
Who is he? 
---
In the games current state this is what face camping has become. There's still the traditional standing on your body as much as possible. Before this clip he was on my body hitting me as well. 
---
Evil Within IV: Myers now has the ability to ascend from the mortal realm into an alternate dimension. Allows him to briefly appear next to a generator, which allows him to fake damaging generators or grabs.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they aren‚Äôt allowed to share it on the sub 
---
A survivor tailing you with a flashlight is a survivor not working generators. It's those groups that load in with a map, a key, and two toolboxes that I worry about. 
---
That was already tested in an earlier PTB (sometime in 2016 or 2017). Survivors abused it to death. 
---
what are you trying to tell us 
---
I can‚Äôt name the dog sorry
---
If they made the cosmetics free it would probably be fine though 
---
Honestly I disagree with you thinking killer takes more skill and whatnot but you shouldn‚Äôt be banned for simply giving an opinion... 
---
https://youtu.be/8PzVd_rr54E 
---
You can hear it at the end of this video
---
I think rank does matter I guess I‚Äôm the only one that disagrees with tydetime and these posts ... 
---
Sadly he continued to tunnel me, and one of the randos we had trying to help was unsuccessful :/ but i wasted his time again and got to see his beautiful face until death xD
---
No. 
---
Unfortunately it cant be a private match so I'm not gonna need a killer, my bad. But thanks anyway 
---
Is only boldness gains really worth negging yourself for the entire match? 
---
I feel it could be points for all categories but doesn‚Äôt stack with WGLF perhaps? 
---
It's BHVR. 50%of the things that happen in this game are unintentional
---
Wait til you come across a decent tracker. It‚Äôs an amazing experience and leaves me very glad I chose to play this lovely game.
---
So? OP wanted to share theirs, if you don't like it, don't bother commenting, we don't need more toxic twat waffles like you. 
---
Yeah I literally did nothing wrong but apparently he and his mods will ban you if you don‚Äôt have their views 
---
Doesn‚Äôt the new survivor have a perk that hides your aura? I wonder if that hides you from frenzy
---
Hmmm the dog....could this be a hint?
---
Confusion
---
"I'll have to disagree with just about everything you've posted and I'll tell you why." 
---
- That seemed quite obvious. You could've just went straight into it. 
---
"Ranks don't matter because it doesn't change how someone is going to play the game regardless of skill level of the player." 
---
- That literally could be said for any game. You've argued that ranking has no hold over a persons actions. Literally no game's rank dictates anyones actions. 
---
"as you've actively participated in the match and have done 1 of everything you're guaranteed a pip." 
---
- False. You are required to at least do two saves and two gens.  Saves are worth more points than any other aspect in the game. There are variety of ways to pip, but 1 of everything is a false claim. 
---
"Higher ranks do not mean a "higher caliber of players" as you so put it" - Yes, by definition, it does. And the proof is in the difference in player skill and knowledge of the game from rank 20 compared to 1. 
---
"You still have killers that will tunnel 1 guy the whole match and face camp them until they die." 
---
- A rank 1 player has a more likely chance of looping the killer doing this than a rank 20. Higher rank = higher caliber of player. 
---
"You still have survivors that sit in lockers the whole match, or walk around the map doing absolutely nothing productive. "
---
- More likely to run into this at earlier ranks. It takes more than hiding in lockers to get to rank 1. Thus anyone at rank 1 that hides in lockers is being falsely identified as someone that "just hides in lockers". That game style wont get you to rank 1. 
---
"There are a lot of boosted people in ranks they don't belong."
---
- Boosted players still can't pip because pips are an individual ranking. Not a team ranking. 
---
Possibly ;) lol
---
Well a character that being iconic would make it even less expected to get cosmetics if anything. It would cost so much for an iconic character to get new stuff. 
---
He‚Äôs only weak when it comes to 4k‚Äôs... 
---
in general he‚Äôs the most consistent killer to 2k with but completely removes any aspect of skill from the game to do so. 
---
Legion isn‚Äôt in need of buffs, they need a full on rework.
---
I would be a little scared about no mither getting bp gains bc then more people will start to use it. Then the new meme on this subject will be about having a no mither survivor in every match üòÇ. I do think that survivors need more blood point perks tho. An actual in game use to WGLF would be nice.
---
1,5 gens, 1-2 unhooks and a few chases and you get a pip 100% of the time. For me it works best not worrying about these things and just have fun, don't force yourself to do it and you'll see that your "more relaxed" mind will carry you in higher ranks :)
---
I usually imagine an escape route every time I'm doing a gen so I know where to run if the killer suddenly appears. Check to which pallet and windows you could go. This method goes a long way in helping your chases to last longer.
---
Also, DONT RUSH anything, rush makes everything worse. 
---
I think he was tryna chainsaw and didnt stop revving like an idiot.
---
Nice bruh, just got the plat myself a couple weeks ago
---
Wow thank you for being so helpful. This was not the sub I expected it in lol. I've been looking at getting a VPN for a while but never committed to it. I am going to look into it tonight. Also,I saw express VPN had something that makes your router automatically run through VPN instead of signing in. Does nord have that too?
---
I dont think I've had any problems with firecrackers...maybe im just either too stupid to have them work on me or people are using it wrong against me 
---
Well no wonder nurse is so rare, it also might explain why i encounter myers half of the time, he is probably good in console. 
---
mah boi is finally getting some love on here 
---
2: TRY PLAYING KILLER AND GETTING CONSECUTIVE 0K'S DIP SHIT. GOD DAMNIT I GET MY FIRST DOWN ON MY NEXT GAME AFTER A 90 SECOND CHASE, 2 GENS ARE DONE, AND YOU FUCKING BUDDY **FLASHLIGHT RESCUES YOU?!?!?!111** DAMN RIGHT IM GETTING A FUCKING KILL THIS GAME FUCK YOU ALL!!
---
Please tell me it‚Äôs not puppers 
---
&gt; but doesn‚Äôt stack with WGLF perhaps?  
---
Why the restriction? You could on average gain about 20 to maybe even 30k thousand points after a match; a match that you played **heavily disadvantaged**
---
Adult dog or Puppy?
---
I've always wondered this myself. I couldn't tell you how many thousands of points I lost because the killer decided to screw the survivors üò•
---

---
It is not. 
---
If that's the case then how do you differentiate face camping from regular camping. I can only imagine the amount of mistitled posts that lead to this moment.
---
Good good
---
The man is very ‚Äúangry‚Äù
---
Good. GOOD. LET THE HATE FLOW. 
---
I mean, absolutely. But being the one survivor to get fucked is bullshit. Survivors escape rates are already in the 33% margin, which is ridiculous
---
Is this dog mean? Or nice?
---
Mostly due to the fact that killers don‚Äôt have a second perk to stack points with so it would create even more ruptures in the community. 
---
Outside of that I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with it.
---
Its not that rank doesn't matter, but it just matters so little. If you've pushed high ranks in other competitive games you actively have to get better. Practice with certain characters or methods, learn the meta game etc. In DBD all you really need to do is play the game correctly, more often than not. It's harder to Depip than it is to get a single pip so in time as long as you don't play absolutely god awful over and over you're going to hit rank one, it's just a matter of time, not really skill. This is all from a killer perspective,  
---
That being said playing the game at rank 1 just isn't fun, You get a ton of sweaty sometimes toxic survivors who expect the killer to play a certain way. I don't find this game to be very fun to always play with a competitive mindset, sometimes it's fun but sometimes I want to goof around. With that said I've tried to derank, and its hard unless you AFK matches, so often once I get close to red ranks now I basically just stop playing until reset.
---
The Legion doesn't come out on top from one hit, because he didn't get vision from the power, he has to wait for the power to charge to guarantee a follow up hit, and without that follow up hit it takes too long for the survivor to get downed even when abusing chase mechanics.
---
Also "the lunge is far enough and is fast enough for you to hit someone and back up when they are on a pallet and dont get stunned" is just categorically wrong. If the survivor is on the correct side of a pallet he has plenty of time to drop it even just in reaction to the hit, which happens after the killer was already underneath the pallet during the lunge. You can't hit and back up unless they're centered under the pallet and their reaction time is very slow. I can't imagine how you got this idea in your head.
---
HIDE IN THE CORNER UNTIL YOU SEE THEM WALK BY A GEN AND THEN DO THAT GEN!!!
---
Mostly time invested from my experience
---
Well I feel rather dumb for not guessing that lad the first time... 
---
Oxenfree time loop. 
---
If you start talking shit in a twitch chat its no shock you got banned. 
---
Damn, I kinda wish the chances were higher. It‚Äôs worth it to try but only if you have all salty lips it seems like. Because the penalty for trying and not getting it is you die. I wish it was like closer to 20-30% chance of getting it for one person over 3 attempts. Like if I go into a game with no luck offerings, currently if I try three times, the chance of one working is about 12%. Which is really low, to the point of never wanting to do it. If it was 20-30% I might actually try it every now and then. Only worth right now with luck and slippery meat 
---
I didn‚Äôt talk shit though?
---
Borrowed time now gives the deep wound effect so chasing the survivor won‚Äôt make the timer go down. 
---
The new jeff perk that breaks the hook every time you get rescued 
---
The reduction in bloodpoints 
---
Hitting a survivor shortly after them being unhooked won‚Äôt down them 
---
Does camping really need more changes?
---
I have stream sniped SWF groups and heard this exact phrase.  It's beautiful: go back to where you were 7 seconds ago.
---
Definitely agree that basement/hook cosmetics would be rad.  Plus, if it was a customizable cosmetics slot, killers that really wanted to remain anonymous to surprise survivors could just leave it as the default.
---
She interacts with her chat when someone says something that isn't kissing her ass. She will latch onto something even slightly critical and bitch about it and to the commenter for an uncomfortable length of time. 
---
Do you have 1,000 Sacrifices as well as 1,000 hours? Those are the qualifications for your opinion to mean something in this community
---
Nice!
---
Yes, wanna join? 
---
No, the penalty is you go to second base...
---
Lies, it was just a skunk!
---
This is very relatable
---
It's worth it at 2% chance if you aren't getting rescued.
---
Yeet
---
I have 60 hours and a pebble. 
---
So you mean, I have to intentionally build my survivor just to not get camped? Of course, makes sense.
---
And?
---
paperwork and money, and i guess even after that each new skin probably needs to be approved by the holders of the license 
---
They don‚Äôt, they‚Äôre just being proactive. I never use DS and they do this when grabbing me, especially if I‚Äôm the obsession of course.
---
Angry
---
I mean saying survivor takes no skill and bringing up other streamers sounds like it. 
---
Streamers ban people over bately anything all the time. Its not unusual
---
I said nothing of the sort, as that was my first comment in this discussion. I was simply pointing out that NOED gives a reward to the killer for letting all 5 generators be completed, which doesn't make much sense in the discussion of what each side should be "entitled" to at each point in the game.
---
It‚Äôs a good average until you realize that they are getting 2kills with little to no skill involved and leaves two players in a match where they basically just get facecamped due to how near impossible it is for them to escape. 
---
Knowing that you have a 50% chance of losing a match without being able to even lightly control the outcome is not a good feeling. 
---
It‚Äôs like back when killers would have to play on maps with infinite‚Äôs and just know damn well they were fucked from the get go.
---
Instead of hatchets, huntress just pelts you across the head with a bowl of cereal from across the map. Oh go, not Cap‚Äôn Crunch!
---
It didn't even do anything, this was before the "buff". 
---
My bad, had no idea it was out of date. Don't use the Shrine myself but I just assumed it was the current set on here.
---
That‚Äôs true. I guess if the alternative is dying it‚Äôs always worth it. I‚Äôm usually SWF though so if I‚Äôm not getting saved, I‚Äôm usually on second hook if not dead on hook 
---
When a survivor has ds he wont wiggle right? Because he is waiting/doing the ds skill check. Once that is done he will start wiggling.
---
The camera shake/hit is just to throw the survivor off (or lag him in potato PCs), which rarely may cause them to whiff the ds. 
---
That's a really good point.
---
I clarified that it does have some skill but it isn‚Äôt hard to pick up after you learn the maps and how to counter each individual killer. My point is, I never said he has no skill nor did I attack anyone. I simply disagreed with him but he got all butthurt 
---
I‚Äôve seen a few clips from him and they all make him seem pretty douchey and condescending and that kinda pushes me away from his streams
---
Another thing that has always bothered me is how damn easy it is to DC, like all I have to do is click 1 button (exit match)  Really never understood why they even have that in the game...I mean maybe if the game were super buggy and you got literally stuck in matches but gee on that end, need to fix the bugs not add a escape button lol
---
It confuses me that whoever created it thought it was better with a longer timer.
---
Eating DS but then they miss it and dc
---
The trade-off for running the ace perk vs having the broken status effect is not enough to make it worthwhile.  Just run Deliverance.
---
joey &lt;3
---
Extra points for it would be nice but not too much because i'd rather not have everyone running No Mither for some quick point gains.
---
What time zone are you?  What rank?
---
Anyone else call them flashbangs?
---
That Nea got stone cold denial
---
I hated the clown's theme üòÇ Legion theme for life! 
---
This reminds me of all those times I watch the Killer walk by and then shortly after they've somehow circled around me without knowing and I get slapped.
---
But I mean he is tracking you by not looking at you. Survivors are memeing all the time I‚Äôm having no issues getting away with killers that are looking at them all the time. I get away pretty regularly by managing my scratch marks and misdirecting him and respecting his terror radius when he is chasing. Sure the ultra rare is hard to go against but that‚Äôs what ultra rares are suppose to do 
---
It was on the other streamer's stream and I told him not to watch the VOD. He's about as "nontoxic" as you can get and he has fun playing the game - I don't want their bullshit negativity changing that. 
---
I'm confused.
---
I don't disagree. But they are scared because they don't want to die. As you play more your confidence in your game play and knowing you wont die leads to players not hiding and not saving people. So they get better, by definition. 
---
i got hit :(
---
I didn‚Äôt say you have to use them I just pointed out all the camping nerfs. 
---
A lot of survivors suck at using them.  You need to use them and change directions the moment the blind goes off.
---
You also need to hide the drop of them if you can, so turn behind a corner before dropping them when you know the killer will follow.
---
An easier use case is to bodyblock while the killer tries to hook someone, and drop it as they hit you to make you get out of the way.
---
Oh my, I apologize, Go ahead and share your opinion my good sir, I didn't mean to trouble you.
---
Puny forest hippies can never compare to the chad nazguls
---
Lmao
---
Definetly going to go with what everyone else in this thread has said: contact your ISP and tell them that you suspect that you were DDOSed. Report the guy on Steam and submit a ticket to Behavior's support.
---
And seriously: some people are so fucking low. DDOSing someone because they beat you in a video game? That's like setting someone's house on fire because they beat you at basketball.
---
hol up lemme cosplay as the spirit.
---
4% chance every attempt, goes up with offerings.
---
This was one of 4 kobes that night without any luck variables played
---
New killer: The Shag
---
only do it when necessary. but you must spare the poor quentins and adams. they dont deserve that.
---
&gt;I doubt Jason will be in the game because he already has a game based just for him, so I doubt the copyright holder wants to pass it around like that, especially since his game was a massive flop.
---
Unless Gunn/Illfonic has an exclusivity contract (which I doubt as the cost for licensing would be even higher) no. The judge found the lawsuit in Victor Miller's favor, who knows what's going on behind the scenes but it's not unlikely that deals are being made behind closed doors. 
---
That moment when you hit max bold and decide to pawn the killer off on your teammates while running Bond. 
---
That depends, how close do you linger to the hooked survivor? 
---
&gt; I could have but I was trying to me nice about it because everyone here seems to get butthurt over the dumbest shit and can't hold a conversation to save their lives.
---
I did find this funny. I do wish it to be noted, I'm not butthurt like most peopel get. But I thght your preface was unnecessary. Clearly your comment was a matter of opinion, anyone that doesn't get that shouldn't be catered to. Which is why I said "seemed quite obvious".
---
What would an anti-camping incentive that doesn't punish camping look like?
---
RNGesus smiled upon you and your friends last night, well played.
---
I require enlightenment
---
I'm going off of experience from the platform I play on and am familiar with and familiar with how the players on it behave in game and things I witness constantly. There is no exception to this on ps4. I've gone against some godly survivors and killers being rank 15, 16 and 17. And I've also gone against equal amounts of trash players at those ranks and were carried into red ranks by their friends. There is no exception, that is how it is.
---
I swear I saw another post so similar to this a while ago, anyone else remember it?
---
That seems like an extremely good way to lose hard. How is that a problem?
---
Just because they aren‚Äôt winning doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm having fun
---
I would have to go through the entire podcast just to find the clip. It was a bit in when pug mentions being mori spammed by the same guy over and Hexy mentions that the dev has no problem with that mechanic since you just bleedout in 4min.
---
Perks that have conditions to activate, or get stronger, the further you are from a hooked survivor.
---
from what i remember if you miss a skill check while healing other survivors it would wake him up instead of you, so this healing penalty would only applies to you, right ?
---
Oh god, PS4? I'm sorry for what you have to deal with. 
---
I'm not so certain PS4 is a good judge of DBD. It's riddled with so many issues. Any experience on that platform should be ruled out, lol.
---
I like this too, the clowns theme(2.0 patch) was like a horroristic thing.Loved that one,could have spend hours just ln the menu for the theme
---
That doesn't sound like he actually knows for a fact it's punishable or not. It sounds more like he was misinterpreting something a dev said. 
---
Dang idk how he didn't grab you. 
---
I read it in a Russian accent and the German confused me
---
i heard an XBox Player say the same thing. Next thing u know people are gonna be sending pizzas again
---
I love this analogy, but when it doesn‚Äôt get stolen you can afford a KFC family bucket with it‚Äôs value!
---
Yes &lt;3
---
Free stuff is absolutely still bound by copyright. Just because you are not profiting off of it doesn't mean it isn't violating copyright. Huge misconception these days because of the proliferation of freely created fan projects. It is usually just too much of a legal mess to try and strike down those things, so many companies just don't even care.
---
Oh, I know whats wrong with Legion. Thats why I mentioned "lack of interactivity". 
---
Nice! Feel free to add me peeps!
---
No comments, no chat. Hilarious.
---
Guess people asking about their empty promises is distracting. 
---
70% of my games at rank 1 I get face camped. If anything rank 1 is the worst for it in my experience. 
---
There are dozens of us!
---
They do by a wide margin but people will bitch about it, a lot. 
---
Not adjacent. Far enough away that I am not easily in sight but could get to the hook 2-3 seconds after I see that glint of movement.
---
I already did
---
Did this last night while I got away from a chase. Was laughing cause they couldn't find me and said "you're so dumb". Proceeded to stab myself during self-heal 4 seconds later giving my location away. Guess I'm the dumb bitch now.
---
Those poor souls.
---
Unfortunately I can't play on pc because I don't have a video card. Which is weird because I can play a whole list of games on my pc without one including fortnite. The spaghetti code in this game runs at 7 fps on my pc. So for now I've refunded my dbd purchase on steam and got some DLC for another game that I play until I can get a video card capable of running this game smoothly. 
---
Well, definitely that and the guy talking about hook and totem spawns rn looks so nervous but in a cute way. I don‚Äôt think he needs anymore pressure.
---
Fair point actually. I can see that. I personally don't think it is the main reason for downvotes, but I get that people dislike that. 
---
Getting the Pigs adept will be much easier now, almost wish I didn‚Äôt have it already
---
I don‚Äôt like it. Jeez people just do whatever they want.
---
Answer is tombstone Myers or NOED. Or what I do, not going to the gates if I have a feeling they'll t bag
---
&gt; The new jeff perk that breaks the hook every time you get rescued
---
How is that preventing or punishing camping? If it has any effect on camping it all, it should encourage it, since allowing unhooks punishes you more now.
---
yeah he is the police officer very the cool the epic
---
&gt; "There is no exception, that is how it is." 
---
Per your words "More likely isn't equal to it not ever happening. It still happens. It still fucks the whole team over."
---
That's an exception to the rule. The rule (in terms of the expression) is the common occurrence. So yes, hiding in lockers does happen in rank 1. But not as much. And not for the same reasons. Because good players don't get pips for hiding. Which is why I said they are "falsely identified". B/c by your own words, "they have to participate".
---
I mean, if you make it impossible for them to get someone off the hook without being knocked down and you‚Äôre that close and not moving then I‚Äôd consider it camping. Camping is a strategy after all. 
---
it really does not need any changes and the change that you want would only be a sprint burst but less useful as when getting hooked it removes all debufs that you have so you could use the actual sprint burst again and at any time
---
I had an absolute blast with a super altruistic group the other day as Huntress...one flashlight DS Feng, two that started with Firecrackers, and one with a Medkit.  They'd swarm as soon as I had a hook making it quite the shooting gallery...had one drop a firecracker when I was mid-hook animation, which made me laugh.  Got blinded into a drop once but the one who got dropped ran straight into a wall for an easy re-cap.  In the end, with one dead, one hooked, DS spent and me with another survivor on my shoulder about to auto-die on the hook, the Claudette #2 decides to try to solo bodyblock me.  Instead of saving the other survivor.  I laugh, smack her, get the hook, hatchet her in the back, and take the 4K.
---
Please.  Bring ALL of your Party Starters survivors.  And bring it with DS so you can blow your loads in the first thirty seconds and leave me free to pick people up and break pallets without worrying about a David hiding over in that bush ready to blind me the moment I lean over to pick up Dwight AND IT'S ALWAYS A DAVID HIDING IN THAT BUSH HOW ARE YOU ALWAYS RIGHT THERE DAVID!?
---
I‚Äôm actually having the opposite problem, which I find very odd. I‚Äôll find killer games in no time but often have to wait 10-15 minutes as survivor to find a lobby with 300+ ping.
---
Yes, blocking the command to unhook was never a banable offense. Wiki states that and AFAIK they state that since the Dev said that some time back. They still changed it stimple cause it was toxic as shit. Ironically you can still block the unhook command on survivors in stage 2.
---
On the other hand, the killer can't do shit after the gens are done and he just hooked a person, if he leaves the hooked person someone will save him and will easily escape, if he camps he at least will be able to secure a kill but that's about it
---
And what source says it is punishable?
---
Damn, what's your current card? AMD or NVIDIA? 
---
Unless it never stops. That makes me mad.
---
Well most females can't float and don't have massive shards of glass in them soo
---
Totally! I‚Äôm with you, I get cocky and mess up every damn time. XD
---
It depends on killer's gameplan. If it's about kills, probably you're right. If it's about pipping and blood points, there are still a lot things to do
---
Not with that attitude.
---
I'm confused on the social implications of this. Does this mean the general DBD community would agree that I'm an asshole?

You are always injured and CANNOT become healthy, but you have the ability to heal yourself to healthy.

I actually don't have one. Using the built in one on the mobo. Its an Intel 550 or something. Idr exactly offhand. I play a lot of cities skylines and fallout new Vegas on all high settings or above with absolutely no problems. I get on dbd and it takes 5 minutes to do anything and it's like, shit, I have no idea how to explain it. Maybe this will work, trying to play DBD on my pc is like a visual representation of dial up service. Even on all low settings.
---
I always love the ones coming to unhook me and get seen and chased by the killer and then proceed to continue looping the killer around me as I die
---
Love this format 
---
It's scary, yes, but just imagine the meta being No Mither, Prove Thyself, WGLF, ..... Self Care!

I mean, if that‚Äôs your only method to win and you have to camp always to win, yeah you‚Äôre kinda an ass. But if you do it to select teams because they are super heroic then it‚Äôs fine

As a David main I'm offended.
---
Hm. Interesting.
---
Yeah this is probably it. When I first set up steam (many years ago) I put in my full name and even the county I was from (in UK those two pieces of info would make it very easy to find someone) it wasn‚Äôt until I started playing DBD though that I realised all that stuff was public. Joined a game and had someone call me by my full name and ask if it was me in my profile picture. (It was) swiftly changed everything I could to private after that match!

Oh man, newegg has cheap video cards. Try that one out if you haven't yet.

If you'd actually read the post, you'd see that I like the buffs. I'm trying to get them not changed smh.

Your a bad survivor but good escape
---
He lunged round the corner missed her as she went through the hatch
---
I played this one killer game like 3 days ago where I forgot I burned an iridescent mori. Could of had a 4K. Everyone that escaped was hooked twice.  Feels bad man
---
Really
---
When playing as Myers you can leave the evil whitin tier 2 at 99% so you can activate it directly behind them. But the funest thing I can think of doing in game with myers is using scratched mirror with boyfriends memo and a lery's offering. Leads to being able to scare the shit out of people
---
Awesome. What's the change?
---
Get ready for this.
---
,,doing gens,you?"
---
Well im rank 6 right now because i de-rank before rank reset and they can't even 1 gen done
---
So self-care would be buffed, if that change came through, yes? Granted, your healing speed with med-kits goes down a bit, but your healing action without med-kits goes up rather drastically. And med-kits will still increase the overall speed regardless. 
---
Still, an interesting change to it none the less. Curious to see if it will go through into the main game. 
---
Could just play a piano sting or something for him.

I don't get this.

I love doing that while spamming the bottle reload as clown, it both sound and looks hilarious in the surv pov

Wow yeah i went into to wrong way and have to agree at this point.
---
When i first started i used trapper and would set traps and then stand behind a tree or wall and wait for someone to step in it.. got 1 person out of like 10 games. Then i realised im an idiot 
---
this looks very laggy.
---
Never
---
From what I've heard in the past the Halloween IP owners are absurdly protective of Micheals mask in regards to licensing.
---
I'm honestly amazed we even got a prestige variant.
---
trapper and spirit are the funnest imo
---
Nah the pizza, I was surprised it didn't turn into a meme.
---
We don't know yet, they've released very limited info on it.
---
How dare you go to a place that a pallet is at. You should instead run in a straight line and hope you find one.
---
See the problem with your logic? Idiot.
---
I 4kd with 5 gens while playing like trash as the wraith earlier today. They didn't go a single gen in like 5 minutes+.  
---
Rank 1.
---
Maybe you can make a perk to where you fortify windows and doorways. Then the killer can kick it like a pallet to break it and go through
---
Halloween wraith is still better imo. That hole in his stomach though üéÉ probably Nurse's best skin though! 
---
are you on ps4 by any chance ? i remember doing something like that yesterday
---
Went right over my head üòõ I‚Äôm clearly in need of a written sarcasm sign lol
---
I definitely agree, yeah. Legion has a really strong power, it was just being held back by the time it took to down someone.
---
Because survivors shouldnt save?
---
Killer especially with Legion added. He just kind of... double pips because he can. In my experience.
---
I thought that site was going under because they owe China a shit ton of money?
---
Depends on how you look at it. Certain perks and builds benefit from having a larger terror radius. Also, the terror radius change puts her on par with other 115% movement speed killers like Wraith; another stealth based killer. 
---
I don‚Äôt kinda looks like Freddy to me, idk tho
---
I wanna say that was the Winter of 2017 because I saw it when I just started playing and that was the week Freddy dropped.
---
Memes here have a 1 day shelf life lol
---
THAT WASTES A TON OF TIME, JUST DO THE GEN.
---
I'm not saying they shouldn't save. I'm saying if that it's a competitive game and that if they have an extremely obvious and glaring weak spot in their strategy, maybe I should utilize it.
---
Mikey has a low terror radius and he's 115 tho, also "stealth " based for the most part.
---
I get why they did that, just like the wraith she can hide her TR but unlike him, she's isn't fast while crouching, hence why I feel like it's an unnecessary change and hiders her
---
If you were trapped in an evil realm where you were violently murdered again and again, then why would you want to live forever?

---
I voiced my distaste for legion during his release for approximately these reasons and got down voted to hell. Now I see these posts often enough and many people seem to agree. 
---
Legion is LAME (imo). 10/10 would have waited 3 more months for a real Legion based killer. Not a cash grab noob friendly chase bot.
---
What I hate most of all is when I put up a offering and the killer DC right away, I can‚Äôt tell you how many bloody party streamers I‚Äôve lost like that.
---
Finally, a reason to use the luck offerings I've been forced to buy. 
---
I shit my pants the first time I heard it when I started playing this game, now I love it.
---
EST, rank like 14. I‚Äôm not saying I never get saved, just that I almost never solo queue so my friends usually save me. I‚Äôm almost never in danger of dying on my first hook 
---
I thinks it's Legion but I've got my doubts
---
But at it's simplest form, there is a clear distinction between the skill of a rank 20 player and a rank 1 player. Since you don't play people at rank 1 who play like rank 20's, its safe to assume rank does matter. Or in this sense "works". 
---
I know that all too well. 
---
Yeah remembered that she is Russian after doing the German. Decided to keep the German as its meaning is much easier to understand to an English speaker. True Russian would look like this.

**screams in survivor**
---
It‚Äôs a fun game but there are a lot of bugs and a lot of toxicity from survivors and killers alike. If you get angry easily then maybe not a good idea but it can be fun. 
---
Do you get a stack of wglf if you step in one that someone was about to stand in? 
---
Legion isn't op you just have to manage to stay away from his frenzy yes it's hard but not impossible other than that he has nothing
---
Tbh the best thing u could do is watching some videos where the hatch is or playing a lot, there are always few locations on different maps where the hatch always spawns, but if you want to find the hatch then u need to listen carefully! And first try to look from the outside of the map and if u don't find it there then don't be scared to go in! It's also often in the middle of the map or in the killer shak too
---
Ps: the map (the game) the hatch is only downstairs. You'll never find it upstairs! 
---
nope, i think
---
Damn I thought I could get the new bot to explain it. David has a perk that gives you extra blood points for unhooks and taking hits.
---
He is guaranteed a 2k every time.No counterplay.He is weak and strong at the same time.
---
It definitely is! Some people are toxic, like in any game, but if you can have fun outplaying killers or survivors and enjoying the immersive horror/survival elements, I say go for it. I usually play killer when it‚Äôs just me and SWF with one friend, and even though there is BS and bad luck sometimes, most of the time it‚Äôs fun to play.
---
fuck, even guys are cosplaying her now
---
Toxicity is real in this game, from both sides. Sorry to say but if you can‚Äôt handle it it may not be the game for you. It can be a fun game but gotta look past the toxicity. 
---
It doesn't matter if it is or isn't. Play however you want.
---
Please it is borderline unplayable.
---
((unbreakable))
---
I know the copyright holders didn't make the game, but they wouldn't want to give the license to another company if they couldn't even make a standalone for the franchise itself, never mind a 1 off character for the game.
---
&gt;it's not worth doing because I'll be bagged constantly
---
Not really sure what this means but the game is perfectly fine.  There are bugs but the majority aren't game breaking, some people are toxic but in my experience it's pretty rare.  Biggest issue right now is the new killer is lame, other than that it's fun.
---
I just want to stop constantly bleeding even when healed after getting hit by wraiths. Pretty sure the upcoming patch is supposed to fix that tho. 
---
I read a news article about it a few months ago. They're millions in debt and were caught in some type of scam. I'll see if I can find it. But for now that's all I can remember.
---
Nurse is an option, and there are a handful of great nurse players on console (at least on ps4).  They're exceptionally rare, and BHVR limiting the sensitivity options so much does limit controllers a lot in regards to Nurse but with more calculated aiming/pre-turning you can mitigate the downside of it.  The even more limiting factor is frame rate imo, but neither of those problems is insignificant.  She's even less friendly to pick up and immediately start doing well with on console, but her ability is so fundamentally strong that even if it's not 100% as good as it could be on pc, Nurse can absolutely still be the same kind of beast.  I do think it's fair to say that she's basically strictly worse on console, and significantly harder.  Her bad maps are even worse, with nothing to compensate except for the immense inexperience console players have against competent Nurses.  It's very possible to play the game for many months, possibly more, and barely see even a good nurse player, let alone a great one.  They do exist though, and they are out there.  It is possible.  Realistically is it worth the time/effort/frustration to get to the point of being great as her? I think 99% of players have came to the same conclusion about that.
---
I don't think any other killer on console is even close to as negatively impacted by the platform as Nurse is, so I would be interested in hearing what other killer you think is not viable.
---
Are you an idiot!? it‚Äôs obviously trapper smH!
---
That's toxic.
---
I mained a killer - But, everyone here seems to be saying toxic this and toxic that...How is anything you do in a horror game, toxic?
---
Me lol
---
I mean you just try to hide, use Urban evasion he's not so fast without feral frenzy.
---
And he can't kill you when he uses Feral frenzy, tbh only way I'd see him as extremely broken is if he has Noed as a perk 
---
The confirmed a few dev streams ago it was only to unhook yourself.
---
In other games, skill is more obvious - in a game like CSGO (I'M NOT COMPARING THE TWO, JUST USING IT AS AN ANALOGY), you know a player is good because of his aim. Because of his game sense. Because of his teamplay-coordination. How many smokes/flashes he learned of.
---
While DBD, it's possible to rank up because the other side simply allows you to. If the killer keeps making mistakes, while you as a survivor keep punishing it - you get evader points, but is it 'rightfully' earned? The killer hooks a bunch of people, you run in there, borrowed time them, take a hit for them - you'll rank up. Is that skill? Same with holding M1 on gens long enough - is that skill?
---
That's why I think, at the end of the day, ranks don't always mean "I'm good at this game" but more or less "I've played the game longer."
---
I cringe everytime i see a leatherface facecamping at rank 1. How'd he reach there? Is that skill? No, it isn't. It's because survivors simply ran in there expecting to get the best of both worlds and died - giving him a pip. There were no mindgames - no gameplay involved that had 'skill'.
---
That's why I disagree with your view point that higher ranks = higher caliber of players. Especially when you can choose to de-rank on purpose, I feel like you'll meet any good player at any rank... or any bad player at any rank. I guess it's called smurfing?
---
Except the rank 20s, those are mostly new players since you can't derank there anymore, not unless you used an exploit.
---
Also, unlike other elo games, everyone here (potentially) can reach rank 1 at the same time. Ranks are not based on the playerbase.
---
Another thing is that everyone in one match can pip. I know this because I just played a hillybilly match, got 0 kills, yet pipped by a huge margin.
---
Sorry for the long post, just wanted to add my thoughts on it.
---
So yeah, it's not that they don't matter, they do matter. But how much do they matter? In my opinion, minuscule. A player at rank 15 can be just as good as player at rank 1.

Chests are visible when standing 25/20/15m away from them, but Lady Luck is impatient. A 15/20/25 second timer begins when a chest enters your radius and the longer you wait, the shittier the loot/charge/add-ons are.

&gt; How is anything you do in a horror game, toxic?
---
When you're deliberately making the game unfun for other players.
---
Luck as a mechanic really needs to be expanded to affect more things. It's pretty much useless to buff luck and even the best luck sacrifices give like 4%
---
Yeah I don't think they thought that through, 2 people with SC can heal themselves over **25** seconds, compared to 2 default Survivors needing **40** seconds to do the same.
---
Being scared by a spirit with prayer beads is much much much worse. I actually got scared by dbd for the first time in a while yesterday. That or going against a hag and running into a trap before you realize youre going against a hag

You mean Claudette?
---
*look around to make sure no bbn one saw
---
Who's Claudette? Never seen her before 
---
I don't know if rank matters but for sure there are huge skill discrepancy between players in dbd. It's not because the game has not a lot of mechanics to master ( as in traditional fps or versus fighting games ) that the game is "no skill". 
---
how can people not spot sarcasm? what are you a fucking carrot?
---
now i want the image of a muscular dude cosplaying as the huntress
---
i mean the huntress was already pretty physically buff with kicking generators with her bare foot
---
On that map you can actually Snipe through the windows it's quite fun.. Nice shot! I'm a huntress main I know how exciting it is to hit one! 
---
I really don't understand why they decided to allow Legion to whiff a million attacks while in Frenzy. Maybe not a full missed attack cooldown, but at least a bit more, right now there is no punishment for whiffing attacks, which is just, why?
---
Like for example, there are survivors that when they outplay you, instead of just feeling good about themselves, they want to flaunt and tbag openly waste time trying to show you you are lesser. Every couple of games I play as killer (ranks 12-5 usually) I‚Äôll run into a very toxic swf group or the occasional streamer wannabe. But most games everyone is positive or neutral, just doing their own thing. I tend to avoid end game chat besides the typical ‚Äúgg‚Äù.
---
I had that once too during this last event. I killed a SWF full of flashlight clickers and teabaggers as Clown (playing BPS no less) and they accused me of everything from camping to lagswitching in the postgame lobby. Next game I was matched with them again so I brought a pinky finger and an ebony mori. Needless to say I did the head stomp animation for the mori a few more times than I needed to
---
Same
---
I had a Susie today who barely got 2k with Frank's Mixtape, Ruin and pink Mori.
---
in the end game with this load out they dared to complain about genrush. smh.
---
I don't know how this person got to red ranks. anything apart from chase was impossible to them. no map pressure, no understanding of how the game works overall. maybe they used Legion for the very first time.. I don't know but it was pathetic. I'm on red ranks every season and I haven't seen a player worse so far. 
---
A coffee deprived fucking carrot.
---
ye
---
And I'm having fun in that game :) And everybody who plays with me have it too, cause I'm awesome B-) Well, most of the time ofc, if people think that a good game is only that one where you have an easy victory, then yeah, some may be disappointed)
---
But what exactly are you trying to prove here? I'm fine with my own ways
---
Im going to borrow this strat
---
Everyone plays differently...
---
If a killer wants to camp a hook, how is that un-fun when the survivor got caught in the first place?
---
I clearly left before this was a thing so, I just don't really understand?
---
I mean... 15 minutes is kind of my not so but sort of regular waiting time. pc, EU zone, red ranks. 
---
Who do you check your sacrifice count? 
---
(Me, eating cereal dry out of a beer glass at work while I microwave my lunch)... I would take a bowl of Cap'n. Throw it all over my face.
---
"But but But.... The killers have it wayyy harder.... REEE TOXIC SURVIVORS"
---
But I wasn't arguing whether it's scary or not. The fear inhibits you from learning the game at first, but you don't just instantly know how to 360, or loop, or become aware of mindgames. Those are things you get better at, and when you get better at them you win more games and get more pips and rank up. 
---
Okay - I guess I just don't understand the saltiness in a horror survival game - The goal is to kill them however you can so, any means IMO.
---
The game is not perfectly fine if you play as the killer. And that is an objective fact. Survivors items are op. The Nurse (too op), Freddy and Legion (poorly designed)  need to be  gotten rid of or reworked (which will never happen but the devs are the most toxic members of the community). The runs like at less than 30 fps on console and simply doesn't work on certain maps (like Rotten Fields and Yamako's Residence) and this problem extends to PC if you settings are not balanced perfectly. 
---
The game is unbalanced. Playing the killer is too stressful and playing the survivors is too boring. And RNG plays way too much of a factor at high rank games. 
---
BBQ and Chilli is in a similar vein of being an anti-camping incentive.
---
I know! I'm horrible at gaming. But it's so much fun. 
---
We don't give a shit
---
haha that's crazy!

It's really hard on PS4, but I'm learning. Any tips?

Face camping is hard to fix because if they do it, then they probably don't care about winning or points
---
Same; I play a lot and so I hit a somewhat high rank just because over enough games played, you‚Äôll eventually pip more often than not. I‚Äôm not especially good at the game, just play too much.
---
Higher ranks pretty much only mean more swf.
---
OOOOH he been practicin!!! That is so rad, what a great time!! &lt;3

HELL YES! GAMES FOR FUN! RELAXED AND CHILL! HAVING A GOOD TIME! WOO!!!

Fun fact: Your fucked and have to call the customer support otherwise you can't level up your character.

No?

My wife and I play this together. She isn't that great at playing survivor, but she tries. She will get caught first a lot and camped and her game is pretty much done. Then I can either die with her or she just gets to sit and wait for my game to finish. It can be frustrating, especially for new players. This will in turn make some people not want to play. 
---
I understand it's a strategy, but sometimes it's not needed. There are times you play with a SWF team and they swarm the hook, so why leave.

Or when you grab him....or you play the huntress. Where do you play on ?

oh i do too. and I'm not new, already got through all stages of Reddit acceptance :D couldn't care less for karma either.

I just don't want to waste my words and arguments on people who like being good Samaritans and protecc and say "don't wanna say good job to op cause dis achievement to them - go be salty someplace else". it's always the same so no point.

You are conflating to different things.
---
Its NOT ok to spew vile shit through chats to hurt other people.
---
It IS ok to play a video game using the developer approved mechanics of the game for your amusement even if other people dont like it.
---
The former is abusive behavior, the latter is treating a video game like it is: a waste of time with no importance other than to amuse you.
---
Somebody's still stuck in 2017.
---
I greatly disagree with that mentality.
---
You can get rescued if there's opportunity - If there isn't, you shouldn't have gotten caught in the first place...
---
I get the point you're trying to make but, it's a survival horror game...
---
Gotcha, thank you.
---
I wouldn't want to add to an already good joke :)
---
 Nurse is definitely the outlier with how negatively impacted she is but I would also say the Huntress suffers on console strictly due to the low FPS making hatchets much harder to hit. Again, still playable, and there can be good Huntress‚Äô on console, but it is a limiting factor that is only seen strictly because of the medium used to play.
---
Going back to Nurse, yes she CAN be played, but it doesn‚Äôt mean she should be (from an efficiency standpoint.) Of course that doesn‚Äôt matter if you play just to have fun and don‚Äôt care about any of that, but then again, if that‚Äôs the case you wouldn‚Äôt care about most of the issues console causes outside of FPS issues and disconnects making the game unplayable sometimes. 
---
I think most console players have agreed that the time it would take to master Nurse on console is not worth the result. The best console player Nurse isn‚Äôt even close to a good PC Nurse, so I think that causes a lot of console players to shift towards killers who don‚Äôt have crutches applied to their power (I.e. Myers and Billy).
---
Oh I got that already. Thought there was a way to look past that :c
---
&gt; I greatly disagree with that mentality.
---
Sounds like the game isn't for you then, I guess.
---
Fair enough 
---
The points from them are factored into your emblem score at the end. 
---
I'd think saying "ranks don't matter" means "it doesn't make you a good player if you got to red ranks cause anyone with enough time can do that disregard the skill". from what I've seen people only say ranks don't matter to those who says something about red ones.
---
No sadly, wish there were stats to see your total Moris, sacrifices, escapes, gens completed, best killer/survivor, most used perks, etc
---
He's a survivor main, a bit odd that he would ban you for that
---
Don't disagree one bit. Pallets need to be stronger against him, namely reducing his power gauge to 0 whenever you stun him (not only when he activated frenzy), and I like the idea of whiffed attacks ending his frenzy. Maybe let him have some duration left, but the important part is **ending** his frenzy. Dead Hard would become useable against him. Good 360s can buy you some time if Legion misses. All that stuff would playing against him feel more engaging, like you have a *chance*. At the moment the survivor has pretty much no chance, and it's really stale.
---
Important note regarding the PTB: He is too strong even WITH self care being in its strongest state since 1.0.0. Now if they only go through with his change and not the healing changes, you will only see Legions all day, since he will likely be the most oppressive killer next to Nurse. 15s mending + 32s self care = 47s per survivor hit wasted. Add sloppy butcher and his very rare mend-increase addon, and you're looking at solid 60s. Have fun not getting a single gen finished everyone.
---
It's a free insta-heal. It's a crutch perk, which is why a lot of killers dislike it. 
---
I mean... when I play Spirit without Ruin or any op add-on they barely do 2 gens on rank 1. I also don't camp/tunnel. what's your point? there are too many potatoes on both sides, that's why ranks don't matter. 
---
Will you cut your arms and have a glass katana?
---
Make whiffed attacks decrease Frenzy bar at least so that there's some degree of precision to using his power. Also does anyone know the numbers on their speed add-ons? Doesn't seem like they makes much of a difference, especially when I can just slap on a duration add-on and spam his lunge to cross half a map anyway.
---
Lol nope I just created it because I had to respond. Not a burner, my very first reddit! Sorry if you feel like I‚Äôm trying to disagree I‚Äôm not, I just can‚Äôt believe that so many people think doing totems is a waste of time. What about opening chests? Is that a waste too?
---
&gt;They said they aren't adding it right now
---
And still you complain
---
It's Claudette's job to disappoint or screw you. It's why you never bodyblock or go back for a Claudette.
---
Everyone on the forums likes to exaggerate. People act like it‚Äôs rare to get a nice groups or something but like 99% of people will just say gg or not say anything at all, even if you kill them. 
---
Imagine if they do go to the effort of all the paperwork and legality just to make a cosmetic for just one of the licensed killers. I guarantee you the complaining will never end if they don't do that for all licensed killers. Its not worth the headache for them.
---
The easiest way is with someone to help you, just send them a message. Now if you wanna do it the hard way, I recommend some perks that allow you to get close before they move away from the gen, like Tinkerer and M&amp;A. Also, go after different people, because when survivors see someone gets injured, they tend to be less alert
---
It's fairly easy to track someone's IP on DBD since its p2p, key logger is not needed at all. Network monitoring tools even network monitor build in with windows can track users ips 
---
This community is constantly complaining lol, it never stops
---
I've edited a few other DbD related things too so if you like this then you should can check out my other stuff [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRK4EPqibbQ&amp;list=PLdMsnFJuE6qgwOtB7bnLA9BwNNwstaCMi)
---
Make it so Legion's power is instantly drained if he whiffs an attack and increase the base charge time.
---
If the Laurie was holding the game hostage/purposely waiting for the hatch, that's rude, yes, but if she's waiting to unhook you when you get hooked then why in the world would you snitch? You eliminate all possibility of getting the hatch yourself.
---
Fuck jendenise 
---
i want 2 know the name
---
Update: It fixed itself after a couple of hours and restarts. üëçüëå
---
Good killers apply pressure to as many survivors as possible. While they are healing or performing altruistic actions survivors aren't fixing gens.
---
Tunnelling a single survivor takes the pressure off all the others. Especially if that survivor can loop or distract the killer for a prolonged time. 
---
The miner sounds like a lot of fun, for both survivor and killer
---
And untrap chance 
---
I wouldn't call it a crutch since it's situational. Decisive is a crutch.
---
It's especially egregious when you consider a killer like Freddy has been in such a sorry state for such a long time. The community needs to force higher standards out of the devs by speaking with their wallets. 
---
Sorry... If you want to know I left something. You'll have to figure it out. I might have questionable ethics/morals but I do have a line in the sand
---
honestly, I know that its wrong of me, but clicking / spamming whatever button really aggravates my carpal tunnels so I pretty much give up most of the time. I switched from space bar to the mouse scroll but I don't think it makes it any better. Plus, when I'm scrolling the mouse I can't help but move it around slightly which flicks the camera every which way and it makes it harder to see where the killer / other survivors are. They really should switch to a skill check mechanic...
---
They are, but it matters about what. if it is specific aspects of the game, particularly proposed balance changes it is more likely to be noteable.
---
People don't like it....therefore they aren't adding it.
---
However they may bring it back later...because reasons....even though the dislike for it was overwhelming.
---
Do you not realize how backwards this company is? You need to complain to get things through their thick skulls.
---
Nobody liked Legion either yet the devs still insist they're right.
---
You get a stack of a teammate steps in a trap and you free them. I‚Äôd love to someday start disarming a trap and when a teammate walks over it I would let go for an easy stack. lol
---
SO THE MATCH STARTS AND I GET SPAWNED NEXT TO THE KILLER. THE KILLER'S INTERNET IS GARBAGE AND SHE GETS ME ONE MINUTE LATER AND HOOKS ME AND IS THEN CAMPING ME. A SURVIVOR RUNS IN TO UNHOOK ME AND I JUST GET DOWNED ONE SECOND LATER AND HOOKED AGAIN. KILLER STILL CAMPS ME AND ANOTHER SURVIVOR RUNS IN AND UNHOOKS ME AND I DON'T EVEN BOTHER BECAUSE THE KILLER JUST DOWNS ME AGAIN ONE SECOND LATER AND KILLS ME. 10/10 WOULD PLAY AGAIN, THAT WAS HONEST TO GO THE BEST MOST FUN MATCH I EVER HAD
---
Pls stop playing legion. He's so boring to go up against. 
---
Ye, there we have it. Didn't knew about how it is with p2p, but I assumed it would be problematic.
---
i just dont know the name for a werewolf
---
 4 They're repeating dumb shit streamers say and suffering from confirmation bias. I'm literally watching people spam "ranks matter lel" after every game on twitch because it's nearly the 13th and there are so many bad people in red ranks now. 
---
Wooowwww 
---
you‚Äôre my hero
---
I'm not having real fun in this situation cause though evading flashlight/firecracker is relatively easy, a win against guys who doesn't do gens is usually not that great of an achievement.
---
Though I don't mind smacking them if they are too cocky.
---
I do this constantly.
---
Google it. 
---
It's a situation that arises pretty much every game. It's not as bad as decisive, but to describe it as some situational perk which almost never works is nonsense. 
---
lycanthrope????
---
Removed - Unrelated Content
---
You‚Äôre so riighhhhtt üò≠üò≠
---
... But they are just wasting a flashlight and their time if they are blinding you at pallets, no? I mean, while they are flashlighting you, they are not getting any distance. It's not that hard to find them again after being flashlight anyway, but they are just playing inefficient
---
Is it isolated to the wraith??? Oh shit, I have well deserved hate mail to attend too üò≥üò≥üò≥
---
Playing Legion in Coldwind is torture.
---
The time to set a trap was reduced to 2 seconds from 5. Also, most of her add-ons had their drawbacks removed.
---
Your Warm. Last hint  I'll say on it. Community can do the rest if the please
---
Had that a couple of days ago, a random Kate who wasn't even in the game just T-posed in front of me while I was chasing Meg.
---
yeah haha, I just thought it was cool.
---
I said they weren‚Äôt an option simply because unless someone lives and breathes this game, the time put into Nurse isn‚Äôt worth the outcome, which takes her off the board for most players. But I will agree with you, if someone likes them enough and wants to put in the time, it‚Äôs not like they won‚Äôt win games; it‚Äôll just be a helluva lot harder.
---
Exactly, I play Huntress a lot on console and my hatchets have been reduced to the really easy ones I can get across pallets or if the survivor is a potato in a chase and runs in a straight line. Which is fine for me, but someone may watch a Huntress on PC and be discouraged when they can‚Äôt do what those players can do, and I can understand that frustration. It‚Äôs all about managing expectations with these killers. The life of a console player haha.
---
Yeah but to the point of "kill yourself for using adrenaline" lmao chill guys it's not that bad
---
Nice did you escaped that chase?
---
Francis, from behind: I DIDN'T SAY THAT! I only said my skill checks will no longer actively hurt you
---
What made dwight toxic? Was he t bagging?
---
* They‚Äôre tweaking hooks so they‚Äôll spawn more consistently. Shouldn‚Äôt affect too much, but will be better on Gideon‚Äôs as they‚Äôre factoring in vertical distance. 
---
* They‚Äôre making changes to totem spawns, including making sure they don‚Äôt spawn where a survivor can immediately see them and being able to spawn closer to walls so they can be hidden in nooks and crannies.
---
* Luck will soon affect what you get from chests. 
---
* The PTB changes to Legion and Self Care will not be going live but they‚Äôre considering other options, such as making the PTB version of SC its own perk.
---
I used to play minecraft religiously, was taking my dog out one night and stopped at the door briefly thinking there might be zombies outside and I had no sword
---
Jen
---
OP didn't delete it, the mods removed it. That's the difference between [deleted] and [removed].
---
The description does say "vault *location*" so when Legion released able to vault pallets it was one of the first things many people checked.
---
Why can't any of you see it's clearly the Hag!
---
The Jake is too perfect, and I love you
---
Mislead is kind of what Francis does with his pebble, but without the boom. When the killer backtracks you're screwed, or am I wrong
---
Bahaha. She would be ruthless, but relentless! Lol. Maybe she could remove exhaustion once every couple of minutes or something. 
---
Dewey could take an extra hit before falling lol. 
---
Literally wait/look up/face a wall. Flashlights and firecrackers don't do anything if you're not playing dumb.
---
Myers and huntress are really fun to play.
---
i never said number changes, but yes. legion does need an entire rework to be fun to play against since the whole concept of deep wounds and being able to vault pallets and windows leaves no room for counterplay
---
I don't claim to be the best or even a great chaser. Just some fun with friends, and killers who didn't want me to live :)
---
Ohh, thanks for clarifying. Boooohh mods. Who cares.
---
Survivor mains are CoD gen fucktards who want their easymode. They were coddled with Aim-Assist, SWF is DBD's equivalent. At this point I've got nothing but respect for solo survivors and nothing but contempt for SWF tryhard losers.
---
&gt; **As harmless and ineffective as they are**, having my game replaced with a white screen every pallet is not fun.  
---
As I mentioned before: It is not a good tactic and they make it easier on me. Having my screen change from video game to white shit still is "annoying". Not strong. Not op. Annoying.
---
Pretty stylish.

---
You can't have that opinion here. You need to be on the hate legion bandwagon! If you don't hate him and think he needs a rework you are apparently disturbed and delusional!
---
They can‚Äòt even fix legion without a major rework (or making them bad). 
---
The list is growing. 
---
Idk maybe. I've been low Rank Survivor since the Hallowed Blight. Floating around 10. Rank 1 Killer, usually Freddy or Doc but recently Legion.
---
I usually played Jake when I was a R1 Survivor but now I alternate between Jake, Nea, Dwight, and Kate
---
Oh yes!
---
I'm jk I don't even play wraith.
---
But now you can be her dad
---
I want a pizza from dwights pizza hero's now.
---
Correct. 
---
I play spirit, the wraith is trash anyways.
---
Thats interesting, need to check out how that affects the distance gained from a full frenzy, it never felt like it could be much of a difference. What I was talking about is that if Legion misses a hit against a survivor, there is no real punishment, he just gets to try again near instantly. Biggest punishment is when you run out of power, but that is more in relation to bad power management.
---
Especially when he had a luck boost...
---
Tell us how you really feel
---
Ok don‚Äôt attack legion mains so much some of us are normal people jesus
---
If only those two things stacked
---
I know what Evil Within is, but being at such a low level for killers I don't honestly know what Boyfriend's Memo and Lerys Offering is. I know I'm going to come off as a noob, but I have always just looked at Survivor perks. I see lot of killer perks mentioned, NOED, Thant, BBQ, but I honestly couldn't tell you what anything does or what it's for. I am not well educated on the killer side by any means.
---
115% and force Legion to down survivors with normal M1 while being able to injure with Frenzy.
---
Some SWF like my group are not toxic or even wanting an easy time. We just enjoy the game for what it is and are bad at it. I do aggree though there are many who are like you are describing.
---
Why this sub is determined to have it either everyone from a group or no one blows my mind.
---
The only buff Legion is getting is the ability to bank his unused power. Just FYI.

I loaded into a game and spawned right next to a totem while the map was spinning, in my head i‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúscore!‚Äù Then i go into first person mode and realize ‚Äúwait- i‚Äôm the killer‚Äù...  
---
And yes it was cleansed within the first minute anyway. 
---
Why are you so salty?
---
Sorry, should have included that heals are fast af off the unhook or fast af anytime till the medkit runs low
---
Yeah, i know. He his still broken as shit for not having counterplay
---
Yeah he was doing the usual stuff, if you got the impression that I called him toxic from the looping alone; know that I play survivor too, it's split pretty even and I loop killers too, it's just how the game is unfortunately. 
---
The worst is when your toolbox is poking out from cover and they see you but pretend not to. Overconfident thanks to your false sense of security, you get caught out with your pants down when they turn around and dive for you like a heat seeking rocket. Especially scary when it's the nurse.
---
Hey man, Van Gogh wasn't appreciated in his time either.
---
Well I like the idea of Plot Twist because it incentivizes survivors to play the map instead of gen rush, and I think it would be better to buff it to Action Speed so like healing and unhooking as well as Gens and boxes. 
---
But the other two already exist to a degree, with Distraction being like Mislead and Lightweight mimicking My Turn. 
---
All good ideas, just a little bit of tweaking. 
---
I won't really have to worry about it since I use urban evasion.
---
Scratch marks are those "red things survivors leave behind them as they sprint". I was confused too when I started playing because I thought those were the blood stains. Only killers can see them though.
---
Yes and fresh stratch marks glow red and slowly fading to orange and disappear
---
This is the most upsetting thing to me. I played one last night. All 4 alive. But he's tunneling one person. They are injured, I'm David and it is my duty to step up. I leave one person at the door opening it as I leave, and I body block, take a hit and pull him. He out plays me on a dash and I get downed. I wiggle to freedom, and dash for the door, it's closed and my team is running around doing god knows what. I get caught, hooked and nobody comes for the save. 
---
Honestly in legions case I have very little room for understanding. Literally has no counterplay and that‚Äôs why most people say they main him. For the easy downs. I can‚Äôt respect people who main a killer simply because they don‚Äôt want to actually get better at the game so yes, I think the attacks are justified for probably over 90% of legion players.
---
Do I see them on the walls or floors or both?
---
I was wondering what that was.  I saw that happen and it was extremely annoying. 
---
Use another account 
---
Man i guess but i really never see survivors stick near paletts they have already used unless they are looping.
---
But granted i main Clown and Huntress so its also rare to see a loop when it just means eating an axe or a cloud of smog. I've just always thought of it as the 'anti shack window strat' perk.
---
Nothing you just listed off is on the same level as insidious camping though....
---
Edit: a much better example would be survivors that wait at the gates to t bag
---
You can't wait, look up, or face a wall at a pallet.
---
Both
---
I like to just ignore the person with a flashlight. Don't even bother chasing. Just nod at them every so often.
---
It infuriates them so much they chase me the entire map. It's like hooking someone for free. So great.
---
Ye boi
---
Both, they are visible for only few seconds.
---
Damn are those mid roll ads at the bottom?
---
Who is the last one? I don‚Äôt see the name anywhere 
---
Happy 13th birthday btw
---
Oooo Hype Nea t-shirt 
---
Were you just waiting up there to camp? 
---
Rep 3 Legion main here too! nerf them, buff them, i don't care just wanna play them.
---
Im going to assume that this is only a ptb thing like the close hatch mechanic
---
Not every swf is "tryhard losers". Some of us just want to play with our friends and muck around while doing it. Hell most of the time if we're in a winning situation my friends and I will try to troll each other to get caught. Plus most swf are just about having fun and most are overly altruistic which a killer can capitalize on.
---
It's rare to find those sweaty tryhard SWF, unless you're constantly going up against the same team. 
---
lol, because a thinly veiled puzzle really demarcates those morals.
---
You should remove the name "hint", it violates rule 3.
---
So basically a faster self care with slower healing others as a perk instead of self care with botany knowledge. Interesting idea. Running solo might make me want this perk but in swf I think I‚Äôll stick to botany knowledge with self care. 
---
Id like to see patty bates. Only so I can do his "hip to be square" dance.
---
Sorry, but I didn't see anything in the rules on this subreddit about self-promotion. I'm proud of the content I made and wanted to share it.
---
Some killers don't like playing against survive with friends or maybe you live in Alaska and have 500 ping or both of you bring toolboxes . I mean who knows why the killer DC's plenty of reasons 
---
What buffs mate
---
i like miner
---
Griefing, not winning. The issue with camping isn't that it wins, it's that its unfun.
---
It atleast makes it so Legion has counterplay and the ability gets changed into the actual tool of injuring (preferably as many people as you can). Instead of being a tunneling tool.  
---
Doctor can find people for free. Myers gets a free hit by having the 1 IQ needed to press Stalk before hitting someone at 95% stalk meter. NOED and MYC give you a free hit. There is a bunch of examples where you can get some value for no skill investment required. 
---
How long have you been playing?
---
Simple, you sprint, you leave marks. Not trying to be a dick but how have you played so long and not known?
---
I think Ghostface could be cool too. 
---
Confirmation bias is a thing
---
Meh not that I want to get kicked or anything but I'm not gonna die if I lose access. Here for stories and memes really, but sure
---
Its not meant to be difficult
---
It's not white tho
---
Does the pizza come in pizza sized lockers?
---
So much made up statistics in this thread lol
---
There's no real good way to punish camping that won't open up abuse or punish defending a hook.
---
A key is an automatic Franklin's. Have fun finding that in the weeds/corn
---
Couldn't you just kobe your way to the second stage if you wanted to end it? That doesn't sound worse than the current state of camping.
---
0 terror radius
---
But damn, screw the actual insta heals if they did. You could just build for maximum charges and done.
---
And no red stain. 
---
I don‚Äôt entirely disagree with you but in the current state of the game solo survivors is without a doubt the hardest of the roles.
---
Because of this more people play SWF to actually give themselves a decent chance. 
---
SWF really isn‚Äôt even a big deal anymore as even the depip squads of dbd will lose a few against a decent player using almost any killer. 
---
Well don't run to reddit because you got your feelings hurt and need other people to fight your fights for you.
---
I've noticed I'm about 100x less pissed about getting blinded now that it doesn't give me a literal migraine.
---
A warewolf would be cool, maybe he can like smell blood(?). He can jump attack(?). Climb things(??) 
---
Highly unlikely they will ever do another licensed killer or survivor for that matter.
---
Its harsh but true. Who fucking cares?
---
my ping is fine, and are you saying survivors can't use toolboxes now?
---
Wasn‚Äôt it like every place that it was possible for a pallet to spawn it could? Yet people would still die if they didn‚Äôt get to an infinite fast enough lol.
---
&gt; Legion can be played by my grandma and with the right perks she would get 3k-4ks every single game.  
---
Unless he has the godtier addon he is shit and will stay medicore at best. You are right about his design being awful, but unless you use franks mixtape he is not a strong killer. live or ptb.
---
Good, dont support their shit business practices.
---
From a financial standpoint it's probably better to do original killers. No license fees and more money from cosmetics. That's probably why they don't do it anymore 
---
He's trash compared to spirit
---
"Shutup and do as i say Susie"
---
My feelings aren't hurt. Its a game
---
Lol this isn't a call to arms. People can do what they want. Just like I will when I run into this survivor again
---
They don't really, at least not recently, and then for like a year and a half before a recent patch made them better.
---
That actually should have been an easy grab! WP though.
---
It‚Äôs very easy to get to rank 1 by playing and learning the game, rank 20‚Äôs are not the same as rank 1, not at all but around rank 1-10 most people are similar.
---
Saying that not all rank 1‚Äôs are created equal, it‚Äôs just the game has an purely cosmetic rank system under rank 10.
---
I got R1 killer achievement in August 2016 and people still tell me I'm a salty r20 survivor main. 
---
No I was climbing up the stairs to check for a survivor who made a sound up there when I looked back at the hook and noticed Kate crouching behind a rock so I just randomly aimed and it actually hit lol
---
You say SWF is DVD‚Äôs equivalent to aim assist when the killing role LITERALLY HAS AIM ASSIST. 
---
You also need to keep in mind that less than 1% of SWF groups play the game and just rush gens every game... 
---
Solo survivors are fucked in the current state of dbd and because of that SWF is nearly required if you intend on doing well.
---
Franklin's + Overwhelming Presence + Lightborn = maniacal laughter every time you hear the click of a flashlight.
---
How the fuck do you get to rank 7 killer not knowing what scratch marks do?
---
Still, he may not be good, but not fun to play against. Also with enough time spent on grinding add ons being scarce isn't the proplem 
---
are u from the discord lmao
---
avn is kinda well known for being toxic and very 1 dimensional oh most op is on the sub so I think it‚Äôs just certain people who cause the divide.
---
Straight up! You have a lot of skill if you've been playing this long without scratch mark knowledge. Especially in the killers role, it's hard to track survivors down without them so cudos homie! I hope that now that you know more about them you become an unstoppable killing machine... or an unreachable survivor
---
&gt;My feelings aren't hurt.
---
So not hurt you needed a good vent.
---
&gt;So for Killers on PS4, particularly those who choose to be toxic, I'm not gonna tell you to do anything to this guy in DBD.
---
So full of shit.
---
I mean I wouldn‚Äôt say trash but definitely weaker.
---
Bless
---
No Mither + Decisive Strike = No Strike
---
When picked up by the Killer a Consideraby difficult Skill Check appears, Successfully hitting this Skill Check allows you to stun them for 3 seconds and escape their grasp and enter the Dying state with 5/3/1% of your Bleedout bar remaining.
---
Fair enough then, videos don‚Äôt show everything and if you had been just camping it woulda been a lot less impressive lol
---
[Only Hex Totems do, not regular totems.](https://i.imgur.com/j6e4Cpm.png)
---
What you said can be misleading as you said "A totem or two".
---
&gt; not fun to play against  
---
Agree on that. He removes the interaction between surv and killer and ruins the fun for atleast the survivor if not both survivor and killer. People might still find playing him fun for the reason that "the gang is stylish" and vaulting shit as killer is weird and fun.  
---
&gt; Also with enough time spent on grinding add ons being scarce isn't the proplem  
---
The biggest cancer possible would be someone who plays one killer with BBQ and switches to Legion every time he gets a Franks mixtape. That item should be changed to movespeed or something as soon as possible. It singlehandedly makes a garbage killer that is antifun pretty decent and UBER anti fun.
---
Yes, because going into every game with no mither is the answer to one specific killer.
---
I mean what if the vaults were on a cooldown? What if the power needed to be charged before it could be activated? There's a lot more design space than "legion vaults windows and pallets".
---
Or, if they take off their blind folds, they kill themselves. Oh wait....
---
Oh believe me if i was playing in PC i will consistently be able to hit great skill checks while rarley failing and i will probably start using descisive strike, so yeah i think i will be performing much better. 
---
Sweet massage
---
The person being chased gets right of way chum. If that means its leading near you then relocate or wait for them to run the jungle gym and come back. 
---
Sorry not sorry buddy 
---
Squadette with flashlights is an easy game. If they all bring flashlights, they wanna use them. They will ALWAYS come up to be the hero when you down one and probably bodyblock too. All you have to do is look at a wall when pick one up and if possible get to a different hook, afterwords all the other clauds are right there with no gen progress. What's really scary is toolboxes, because those survivors are there to win, not make montage clips.
---
Plus brown med kit
---
Thats nice. Yea I vented from frustration and again everyone can do as they please. 
---
Not telling anyone to do anything. The post can be completely ignored. 
---
You're the one attacking it. You're irrelevant to me. 
---
Idc about your opinion. I vented thats all I needed. 
---
I didn't ask a keyboard warrior troll like yourself to say anything to me. 
---
insta-downs still require at least some degree of brain activity since you still need to chase them and get a hit whereas with legion they get faster during frenzy and not even pallets or windows stop them so they get a free hit that you literally cannot avoid

Try using a vpn.

Ghostface is always a possibility. The guy who own the mask rights has expressed interest, it's just an issue of the character rights.
---
yeah even if the vaults were on a cooldown then they already vaulted it and already got a free hit
---
Not picking the nurse and dying of suffocation cause you didn‚Äôt cosplay Purple Bride 4head
---
Thanks for the support! 
---
Does it really matter if the enemy used 0% brain or 5% brain activity to gain value from a certain aspect? Both are basically free value. 
---
&gt;I didn't ask a keyboard warrior troll like yourself to say anything to me. 
---
Says the guy who posts PS names to reddit to get people to fight for him. If all you needed was to vent you wouldn't have posted his name.  You aren't fooling anyone, not everyone is as naive as you.
---
This is another point of contention. It doesn't have to be a 4-Man MLG group to have a very noticeable impact on the game. Of course the effects are less dramatic, but even two-man groups play very differently than your average solo survivor. Having someone there you know you can rely on makes people quite a bit more bold and lot more efficient.   
---
Also that guy might literally be 12. You might not want to waste your breath.
---
I couldn't, it was the first time I've ever witnessed that and I was laughing too much to be toxic about it
---
Tons of people complain about not being able to wiggle off more. Granted they're probably rank 15s but still.
---
I'm not a fan of him.
---
I see my fellow PS4 players don't know how to DVR still. 
---
That would be really op and game breaking
---
Both, and occasionally the ceiling in some maps and areas.
---
At least, when they spawn. 2.4 totally fucked them up and they barely work now.
---
I‚Äôve tried, on PSN your region can‚Äôt be changed without making a new account.
---
After you hit rank one for the first time, it gets easier every time after. Congrats man!
---
wat
---
I really love Legion but he needs a lot of changes. I know people people say that 115 movement speed isn't a good fix but be needs to not rely on his power so much and chasing at 110 is really bad for the killer. 
---
Someone should do a meme like
---
"Insert a pro thing here"  |   when you reached rank 1 as killer
---
"Insert a noob thing here"  | but with Noed
---
Damn that sucks
---
DVR? First time I've heard of that, what is it?
---
thank god
---
Doctor finding you for free or M1 killer downing you from full health because of NOED doesn't require much more skill input than Legion hitting you with their power.
---
The depip squad literally only "lost" a few, out of hundreds of games. The base game mechanics are still pretty busted, we just got emblems as a bandaid.
---
That‚Äôs what I like about him, he‚Äôs more calm, and he‚Äôs the only killer that‚Äôs just normal. I admit he fucking sucks but I love playing him
---
it seems like you just don't enjoy dead by daylight. i feel like the majority of the playerbase has fun with it despite there being some annoying bugs.
---
Ya damn right ;D
---
yes it does because you as a survivor can use your skill and knowledge to avoid the killer with windows and pallets but legion deletes windows and pallets so there's no counter and it's a free hit
---
I think that they should nerf legion so that if he misses an attack in his frenzy he instantly loses all frenzy and is therefore stunned.
---
While that is really nothing in the bigger scheme of things, it would actually allow people to try and use dh or 360 to try and make the chases last longer. I've seen so many legions just constantly swing until they hit the person, because he has no drawback on a missed attack. 
---
You cant really extrapolate your experience to the community as a whole, and I'd be willing to wager good money you're heavily downplaying how much use you get out of a swf group communicating. Yes I'm sure there are meme games, but I bet when you're not overwhelmingly smashing the killer you fully utilize your advantages to escape.
---
I know this is going to be a horribly unpopular opinion but.....
---
This vid probably highlights my biggest problem with this game, 360ing should not be a thing. For me it violates the spirit of the game and should not be tolerated. 
---
Like, in what world would a killer like Michael Myers or Leatherface fail to stab/bash someone just because the people they tried to hit did a twirl??? Like I said unpopular opinion, but am I wrong? 
---
Multiple toolboxes loading in together has a high probability of being a sabo squad, which is perhaps the least fun a Killer can have in a game. Some would understandably just rather not deal with it.
---
I mostly agree. I think the stronger killers have a definite edge over solo survivors. It's starting to border on unfair with the buffs some killers have gotten recently. What I'm not gonna agree with is the fact that SWF is not a big deal. As I mentioned to someone below, even just a two-man group is going play a lot bolder and lot more efficient than their solo counterparts, and the effects get more dramatic the more people you have in your group. An advantage is an advantage, even when you still lose.
---
i saw it the other day and i think it is and it‚Äôs my favorite thing ever 
---
Thanks :D I‚Äôve been grinding since double bloodpoints and I finally made it :D
---
oh wow im hurt lol absolutely, otherwise your gamertag wouldn't sound familiar to me. 
---
I believe self care buff was in the brainstorming phase and was not actually planned for next patch, they just wanted the community‚Äôs reaction. As a survivor main I believe this would be a step in the wrong direction as it nerfs coordination and buffs the idea of playing selfishly. If the speed of survivor‚Äôs self heal was the same as others healing them, no one would try to work together.
---
Plus it would make those blood dance missions much harder
---
I don‚Äôt know what you mean..
---
Are you guys really still going on about this? üò∂
---
I STAY IN THE PURPLE RANKS BECAUSE RED RANKS TAKE SO LONG TO FIND A GAME IM SO SORRY 
---
I would play the hell out of this killer 
---
..... Erm again I don't need anyone to fight for me.  Not asking that. Specifically implied not to do anything aside from show their own kindness if they choose too.
---
I also didn't post his name. Which in case you didn't know, there is a thing called google where you can see quite a bit of posts of salt from survivors and nothing is blanked out. 
---
Even on youtube I've only seen one person actually do this so what little I did do is actually provide more cover than it would seem the majority would do.
---
If nothing happens, then IDC. That's fine. Its not like I'll be able to watch any of the karmic justice. 
---
I'm just letting other killers now about a possible individual, they themselves may have already met, who will take it upom themselved to harrass them. 
---
But I suppose your fine with that behavior since yknow reporting doesn't work at all and I'm guessing you're a (toxic?) Survivor yourself that plays swf and it would be offly bothersome if killers started communicating about survivors who like to harrass them. Then they would know who not to play and that would obviously ruin toxic swf teams because we as killers would know who to avoid. 
---
Regardless, thats my piece and I won't be replying to you anymore. 
---
Have a blessed day though.
---
Custom icons are an EAC risk. If it detects the changed files EAC will permanently auto ban you. IMO, not worth the risk, small as it may be.
---
What in the completely broken and overpowered creation pool is that
---
I dont understand why he jumped letting himself get grabbed when he could have taken a hit and then get the hatch.
---
Best? Decisive Adrenaline - When picked up by the killer, complete a skill check to escape and stun the killer. Then heal one health state and run at 150% speed for 5s
---
Worst? No One Left Behind... But Me (NOLB and Left Behind) - When you are the last remaining survivor in the trail, altruistic actions are performed 12% faster and grant 100% more BP
---
Quirkiest? Insidious Maiden - While a survivor is in a locker, your terror radius is reduced to 0.
---
Update: Finished it yeasterday
---
This guy has it right. There are some pretty awesome level headed people on here who are great to talk about DBD with even if the two of you don't necessarily agree on some aspects of the game, then there's other people who complain 24/7 about everything they don't like and they get pretty toxic about it. 
---
Kinda like how the game itself plays out really. Some people are pretty toxic and make the game not so fun, and some people are great to play with/against. 
---
Do you remember the name or have a link?
---
I realize this makes me part of the problem, but I'm just curious what they said about him.
---
It‚Äôs an important topic imo.
---
We shouldn‚Äôt normalize bypassing the games way of trying to make fair matches. If we do, and deranking is ok, then the whole ranking system is pointless and we should just match based on ping and nothing else.
---
He's just so bland to play against. I feel like as a survivor, you have to change you gameplay every game depending on the killer. But legion you just do gens and if he sees you just wait to get hooked then saved. 
---
I've noticed my Bloodletting and Weekend/Brazil exclusives get me mori'd/camped a fair lot more than usual at higher ranks. It's fun. 
---
Alright, thanks, I've heard some people say EAC won't dtect changed png's, but I'm not sure
---
Camping behind something? I mean i think it's normal for a survivor to hide behind something when the killer is nearby no?
---
Oh so in other words you are saying that every swf is sweaty tryhards? That is completely wrong and anyone worth their salt knows that. My friends and I play games for fun, not to be competitive, so no you can't assume that I'm lying about my own experience. It seems more like you are quite biased and nothing I say will change your mind anyway, so I don't see the point in further explaining when my first comment was sufficient enough. 
---
This is console? Why does it only happen on wraith?
---
But solo isn't even that hard as long as at least 1 other person is good.
---
You sound like a preteen trying to shirk any responsibility with the most broken logic. "They do it so why shouldn't I?"  Brilliant.
---
&gt;..... Erm again I don't need anyone to fight for me.
---
..... Erm again, of course not, that's why you posted his name.
---
&gt;I also didn't post his name.
---
lol
---
&gt; But I suppose your fine with that behavior since yknow reporting doesn't work at all and I'm guessing you're a (toxic?) Survivor yourself that plays swf and it would be offly bothersome if killers started communicating about survivors who like to harrass them. Then they would know who not to play and that would obviously ruin toxic swf teams because we as killers would know who to avoid. 
---
I'm a killer main, so I suppose you're wrong.  Your piss poor logic fails you again.
---
New character. Retired football player can throw a metal ball to down killers like the huntress but more range 2 shots 2 down. Then within 5 meters of a hook he can toss people‚Äôs on. Mori could be tossing people up and breaking their backs as they fall down.  
---
Was he tier 1 or have insideous?
---
THIS IS THE SAME REASON I USE SPINE CHILL SO I NEVER RUN INTO THE KILLER  UNLESS I DO A STUPID MOVE OR ITS A MYERS CUZ I GET TOO SCARED TO RUN OFF 
---
This might be good as a Killer perk,

---
Everyone's given great advice on how to respond to the DDOS, but I'm curious.
---
What pissed this dude off so much?
---
You also have no drawback. Every other killer has a drawback on a missed attack. Legion's can constantly attack without being slowed or stunned from a missed attack, nor do they have a recovery time to enable the next attack (if they are in frenzy). 
---
Ah, of course. It's always because the killer was a potato
---
My mistake then, I‚Äôve heard from multiple sources that it doesn‚Äôt but if McLean says so.
---
Mind you, McLean has also said in the past that billy moved at 150% speed with his chainsaw.  Not the most reliable sometimes... 
---
Thats what he and i said... 
---
Okay, on all of that we're agreed.
---
I like this comment üòÇüòÇüòÇ look at you trying to respect the OPs feelings 
---
Get ready for Susie to become the L from death note of low effort DBD cosplays now!
---
When people get so salty that their IQ actually decreases. 
---
Given the scenario xyex gave, yes. The killer was not playing optimally and seemingly not applying map pressure. 
---
Are you going to message me on everything with childish messages? Please do if that‚Äôs what you feel like but damn does it look petty from where I‚Äôm standing.
---
No, it really hasn't. There have been a lot of tweaks, but aside from map changed to stop near infinites the game still heavily favors survivors in that it's too easy to get 5 gens done before the killer can stop it. Time is still very much against the killer, and the only thing mitigating that is survivors won't pip if they just gen rush and leave.
---
I've been through several events now, and I've never seen one full set of cosmetics that could be earned in a day.
---
1). It's obviously enough of an issue for the devs to mention it on today's stream.
---
2). The O/P has done nothing wrong, so please stop attacking them.
---
3). As a "sponsored" player, her in-game actions and comments on stream (including de-ranking) carry far more weight than the average player and represent the devs - Yeah, it's a job/source of income, so do it right, follow the rules, and be professional.
---
3). Please take some Logic and Public Speaking/Debate classes - It will probably help you develop some better conversational skills than Ad Hominem attacks and actually let you bring something of worth to the conversation.
---
anyone ever has 3k's but this person that survived you didnt even hook? I always get really triggered because i want my bbq stacks
---
Yay for made up statistics!
---
Is he? I know he has the little boost after he uncloaks. I leveled him up for his perks, maybe I should play him...
---
Oh yeah, I understand. I told my friends something similar when he came out. My impression was that he was overall weak, but if he wanted to, he could easily demolish or grief a single survivor like no other.
---
...that's not at all what I was saying. You don't have to be sweaty try hard to gain massive advantages from swf. I'm sorry I upset you man, I didnt realise you were so sensitive. My bad. 
---
I was just genuinely confused. Was thinking that I must be missing some glitch in the background or something rather than a pretty ordinary event that is bound to happen if you run the RNG enough.
---
I mean, most of the time they run bloodhound anyways so it wouldn‚Äôt change much. 
---
Cool idea though.
---
And then they miss the skillcheck and immediately sprint away from you.
---
*three Dwight‚Äôs with leader
---
That's one way to fail a trust fall
---
*stealth increased to 100*
---
Well I‚Äôve yet to do an actual test on this but let me ask you this, how many times have you played against people like the depip squad in your entire DBD experience? 
---
Yes, all 5 of them
---
Why is pressing l1 a bother? You can run and still move the camera freely
---
Uhm I'm using the default button layout. That's left thumstick to walk and L1 to run .L2 for crouch. Have zero problems 
---
It's super ironic that you made a pithy petty reply and are now upset that I responded to it. Didnt mean to upset you bud, I'm sorry.
---
Legion doesn't need that setup to be able to track you backwards, I was just explaining that is common. Even if they don't have that perk set, they can track you with scratchmarks or blood trails. Because unless you are running away, even if they are going backwards, legion will still catch you. But the point is, a specific teachable perk, especially no mither should not be a requirement to have even a hope of countering a killer's base power.
---
What?
---
You can crouch, walk, and run. Then there's exhaustion perks that give you 150 percent speed for 3 seconds when activated
---
what is medium running and when has L3 ever been used for anything 
---
My first thought exactly.
---
Who needs to hook when you can watch them panic as they try to simultaneously loop and pick up the lost flashlight.
---
There is now 1/3 pallet spawns on most maps. If that isn‚Äôt enough to show that there has been at least a decent amount of change your a lost cause. 
---
It‚Äôs a part of the killers job to apply pressure so gens don‚Äôt get done fast. It‚Äôs a learning curve, you can‚Äôt come into the game playing like tru3, zubatlel, etc.
---
How about no? Survivor is easy enough - _-
---
That is some next level salt
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it as it‚Äôs not my play style, that‚Äôs for sure, but I have a friend who enjoys playing wraith so who knows, maybe you‚Äôll enjoy it.
---
REEEEEREEE

---
THE KILLER DCD AFTER LIKE 5 - 10 MINUTES OF THAT BULLSHIT
---
Well I'd believe you didn't use the exact words "isn't even a big deal anymore." 
---
That's very doubtful, regardless. If they act overly altruistic, maybe. If they're just messing around with meme builds, maybe. If they're doing gens like they should and actually trying to get out, not a chance. Not unless you're a strong killer (Nurse, Billy, etc,) you don't get unlucky with pallet/gen placement (which is completely out of your hands,) and you don't make mistakes. If you actually want some variety and play some weaker killers, then only one of these things is in your control, and it's just not enough sometimes.
---
It's so cool looking! I respect Huntress mains as I'm horrible with her.
---
I just rotate the camera to look behind me, I don't know if there's a car game-esque look in reverse button...

but that‚Äôs exactly my point lol

You got to rotate the camera behind you too

Did you edit the post? I don‚Äôt remember much of it but whatever, I‚Äôll just respond to the comment.
---
I think many people will agree that the healing nerf that came with recent patches was too far. The fact that sloppy butcher went from being c tier at best to a tier or even s tier was wild. The healing took way too long, and a small self care buff or mangled nerf was much needed. I don‚Äôt think crybaby survivors had much say in this. The fact that self caring with mangled took more than half the time it takes to finish a whole gen is crazy.
---
I don‚Äôt like self care, I only run it if I need to, and I am against it becoming more meta than it already is, however I was fine with the increased healing speed. What I‚Äôm not fine with is self caring taking the same amount of time as healing others. I think the self care speeds should be 55/60/65% with no nerf to healing others, and if they don‚Äôt want to do that, NERF MANGLED EFFECT. I think self care is in an ok spot, but I also think perks and addons that apply mangled effect are overpowered right now.
---
Wtf I wrote "I created this momster" instead of monster.
---
Outside of Jason, which is in limbo and no-brainer there's Universal's Monsters ‚Ä¶ However, there isn't that many licensed killers left. Pinhead was brought up a few days ago and he would actually work quite well with the entity. It would also make sense financially as the IP is no where near as valued as it once was. 
---
What's left? Chucky?  I'd rather they work on new locations and maps ‚Ä¶ There's plenty to play as, but not enough to play on and there are times when I play the same maps back-to-back-to-back-to-back. 
---
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt even that big a deal anymore,‚Äù 
---
Because compared to the past, it‚Äôs not. Not in the slightest.
---
Any killer beyond clown (including clown) can handle 4 mans with relative ease. The main reason SWF is looked at as op is the groups like marth88‚Äôs depip squad (which hardly exist) and they weren‚Äôt playing for anything but the escape. 
---
Cold wind is actually my fav map as killer. You can stalk through the corn as Myers so even if I don‚Äôt even see the survivor I just stand there and happily watch my stalk bar fill up
---
 B E  H A V  I O R
---
It would be the Devs part to actually address these issues, it‚Äôs been 7 months, and with a massive Asia based following, DBD‚Äôs state is under a lot of heat.
---
I still think that would be op. Imo if they were to add a killer like that it would be an activated power, but either 5 seconds long or 10 seconds but he has a 105% move speed
---
Datamined from the recent ptb, check the pinned topic
---
someone said the devs said they'd never do a non-humanoid killer. Although I don't know what that means, because it could be argued that the wraith and hag are like spirits and werewolves are human and the entity itself certainly doesn't seem human. I think they don't want to have to model more complex creatures or something...
---
Thanks mate :)

Cool!

yeah haha it does make it hard ot hear injured survivors though
---
Holy shit this was well made
---
Probably not. I'll try him though.
---
Inb4 someone makes a fan theory.... The Entity is from Darkest Dungeon.
---
You dont even need to punish people who derank. Just reward whoever finishes a month in reds/r1. 
---
That's not how it works for me everytime a killer literally catches me even a nurse manages to catch me without blinking when I press L1 not when I press L1 and L3 to sprint 
---
I‚Äôm poor tho
---
There‚Äôs only walking and running there‚Äôs no in between 
---
China doesn't like to export money if it can avoid it (and there are other countries in Asia that may have their own issues as well, obviously Japan got by, but it helped by being separate). Behavior may not want to give them the cut they want. It's clearly not solely on the devs if it's a negotiation between the company and an entire continent.
---
You must‚Äôve been in swf with someone
---
Oooooooh, true that. I'll eventually do that if I get more clips in the future.
---
Not like you can heat them anyway this patch.
---
Didn't use NOED tho. Got to Rank 1 with some silly Wraith builds. Ranking up is stupidily easy right now.
---
Got here with a mix of Wraith and Legion with varying degrees of tryhardiness.
---
That‚Äôs not impossible to rule out, it does happen, but if that was the case, why would the Devs bury it under new DLC and mini events? They could‚Äôve addressed the problem instead of leaving the Asian community to speculate/have no access to the stores content without going through an excessive grind.
---
Thats nice. Bless you little keyboard warrior troll

Lastly, I didn't post their name. Nowhere in that thread is the name typed. Implied? Sure but not typed nor stated.

Again, it is up to an individual to decide what to do Ignoring me is an option 
---
Since you seem slightly illiterate, It wasn't "they did it so why can't I?"
---
It was me, endeavoring to show that this doesn't seem to be a very big deal like you are implying. I could have just posted, with name, the prior messages from each encounter somewhere else like twitter maybe but didn't
---
And sure you're a "killer" for this engagement just for a rather poorly formed insult to be used
---
Good for you though. You did earn a cookie.
---
It's not often I give that to KBW trolls but since you have some sand in your orificies I felt you deserved one. 
---
Have a nice day in the fog. Laters.
---
I always play solo so that's false 
---
Deranking on purpose should be punished. If you want easier games play something else. It‚Äôs bs when your rank 10 towards the end of season and you‚Äôre playing against p3 nurse who destroys all the noobs. You play the next game and the same p3 nurse who dc when game starts without any addons. I‚Äôve had this happen many many times and it‚Äôs obvious what‚Äôs going on. 
---
The suggestion goes against the lore of the perk. Mechanically it isn't terrible (though it does remove several of the synergy perks you can use with no mither that are based on you being injured), but the entire basis of the perk is that the character is already injured before the trial started and is just too proud to admit it and let themself be patched up. that is why it is the broken status effect.
---
most people drop them too close and you just walk over them

---
You think you¬†‚Äòre slick trying to sneak in that Birdbox reference past me. Not today!
---
Super interesting concept but I‚Äôm still not sure this killer would be that effective against swf unfortunately. 
---
I messaged the killer to ask if he was seeing the same ranks as I was and he confirmed it
---
Precisely because reaching red ranks is easy, most players that have not managed to do so - especially this late into the season - are bad. Being unable to pip consistently enough to climb ranks even over a multiple-week span simply means you are bad at this game.
---
The average red rank player is not particularly good at the game either, mind you, but the average purple-and-below rank player is outright bad at the game. There are exceptions, of course, such as good players that only play the game very scarcely, but this is about the majority of players that can be expected to populate the respective ranks, i. e. the players you will generally go up against in your matches at these ranks.
---
But why remove the ability to get up? That defeats the entire purpose of the perk.
---
In all honesty making it an instadown instead of making you Broken for the entire trial could be interesting. It could present unique counterplay against the likes of Michael Myers and Hillbilly while still retaining the niche use it has against Legion and other such killers who track injured Survivors.
---
I second u/JustForGames0612 comment. I play Hag on console. It's amazing. I get stomped every couple of matches once I hit red ranks. With M&amp;A, her stature, and black cosmetics; she is jump scare queen. Aside from Michael who has no terror radius at some points and wraith, who goes invisible. But on top of that you have nice map pressure with your traps. And it is SO satisfying when you place a single trap under a hooked survivor then someone trips it before they unhook, you teleport and grab them right away. It can feel like chess with survivors rather than cat and mouse when you play against coordinated survivors.  
---
Totally, it can be dangerous to put those offerings up in the first for exactly that reason. That's why I would never get to overly excited to see them because it entices teammates to recklessly throw away time on the hook that downplays facecampers. 
---
Rank rewards would go a long way to discourage deranking.
---
If you tunnel everyone, aren‚Äôt you really tunnelling no one? ü§î
---
Stop that
---
When you're sick of constantly facing the same Killer.
---
My point is, if they give Red ranks a good enough reward, most people wont derank. 
---
More like egging someone's house because they beat you at basketball
---
80% of my survivor games are SWF because it is just more fun. I'm not talking about taking try hard broken loadouts or taunting the killer the whole game, but playing with competent players. This game is so much more enjoyable when you are playing with people who know what they are doing and don't farm others or kill themselves. I'm a killer main and couldnt care less if you are a SWF group, people need to understand both sides of the argument. Not all SWF are toxic, some just want to play a game with their friends.

When the killer repeatedly goes after the same survivor instead of anybody else. It usually happens right after an unhook, and then the killer goes right after the previously hooked survivor 
---
I hate that lol. You are keenly watching a direction because that's where the killer was then all of a sudden they appear right behind you.
---
Agreed but I meant chasing an injured survivor over a healthy survivor especially when the injured one is close to dying on the hook e.g. chasing the unhooked survivor if you were close enough when they got unhooked.
---
I think that's what survivors think of as tunneling.
---
Okay I gotta test this 
---
Scary is a a jake jumping from a locker at you when you are chainsawing at some other person
---
While that's true that flashlights can be annoying I prefer players who are more altruistic rather than 4 Blendettes urban evading on the edge of the map. Especially if I'm huntress.
---
Damn, such a good reply. I didn't think about David's lore and the synergy with Dead Hard. Unless dead hard is changed too, I guess. Good points all around. David sounds like a stubborn brute.

Dude don't ya know? Killing people is tunneling.
---
Man, I was gonna answer shortly, but then listening to Dark Cello music, I started writing more and more. So I made a post for the Claudette Mask, in regards to why not Jake Mask:
---
I don't have a lot of hours playing leatherface, I have much more experience with Freddy, Hillbilly, Trapper, so I took Leatherface just a couple weeks ago, I am almost sure I need not more than 5 masks to get him, and can not get Jakes in my lobbies, and when I get one they are usually pretty good and escape. Jake Survivor Mask for me is becoming the hardest one to get. And I don't like to spend all match trying to find that one Jake when I alredy found other three survivors. But plan to get it eventually.
---
And why Claudette:

Omg thank you!
---
1. You're an idiot you can't give rewards fur rank 1s because all you have to do is play the game for 3 days and you're rank 1.
---
2. The devs are not  gonna give away  cosmetics or auric cells  every month.
---
3.  bad behavior lobbies. They can all play against each other, people who dc are already playing against each other are you stupid.
---
4.  swf bonus please every killer cry every lobby is swf.
---
5.  "player purposely kill themselves they should keep their current rank since they didn‚Äôt do anything to make their rank better or worse" except for die instantly and if this was a thing every rank 1 who gets caught would just kill them self to keep there rank.
---
THIS GAME IS WAY TOO FUN BUT UNFORTUNATELY MY POTATO PC LAGS WHEN I PLAY SURVIVOR
---
I think she's definitely one of the less common killers in general. She can be a little tricky to use, and the offerings without a doubt effect how you  play her (proxy trap, long range, etc) 
---
Rank 1 killer here.
---
Just patrol gens. Its by far the easiest way to find survivors. You could also utilise perks like BBQ&amp;Chilli or Whispers to help you find people
---
Urban Evasion + Calm Spirit
---
Urban Spirit
---
While inside of buildings, move 1/2/3% faster, vault 10/15/20% faster, and gain 50/75/100 more blood points in all categories while inside buildings 
---
I usually just back into a wall so they have one way to run after DS
---
The op is saying he cannot get players in lobby, not that he cannot find or kill them in game.
---
The whole ranking system is already pointless
---
Oh shit my bad lol
---
I‚Äôm talking about being the killer in that scenario. I go after the unproductive locker monkey and treat the person who gave them up more fairly. Because in that scenario as a survivor, I‚Äôm usually the one on gens who gets killed while the other person does nothing. I have no pity for the worthless survivor hiding and waiting for their free win and ditching their teammate. 
---
it's called self care not heal team
---
Well, her costume is comparatively easier to do and more practical to wear in comparison to the other female killers.
---
But still, where the fuck are the Hag cosplays?????
---
Nope. Played Amnesia The Dark Descent. Don't even know that movie.
---
That story was beautiful. Brought a tear to my eyes. 
---
And I play leatherface only so finding jakes isn‚Äôt too hard a task for me, but it was the last mask I got (well second to last, P3 was the last only got it a day ago). 
---
That‚Äôs alright, just wanted you to know. Killers don‚Äôt like it because it is pretty powerful. Nothing‚Äôs better than No Mither though...
---
The lowest ranks always have horrible queues.  Only advice I can give is to try and queue up when the player count spikes in the evening and just prepare yourself for the wait.  it WILL get better, but it takes a few ranks.
---
So, tier 1 Myers?
---
PS4, normal random game, and I think I was downed in 1 hit without the chainsaw too.
---
Red Forest is a rather bright map though, if you compare it to a map like MacMillan.
---
By now I'm practically a Legion main, but I think he's kind of a mess.
---
Your options are to basically tunnel people one by one with Frank's and moonwalking, which isn't how it's meant to be played and is boring af. Or, you run yellow addons and basically fuck around all game, get a lot of 0ks, and still get salty survivors and DCrs.
---
Playing as him ends up being lame no matter what you do.
---
No it would be really op if he was 100% invisible. He‚Äôs balanced. He get a really nice Lunge attack when coming out of invisibility so if he was completely invisible it would be wayyyyy too easy to land that hit especially with good add ons. Additionally he can body block survivors on certain generator spots so that would be another thing that would be exploited.
---
This means at least one rank 20 is SWF with a rank 1.
---
Either it's underhanded or it's a case of a die hard convincing a buddy to play, so the low rank hosts so that they dont have to play against a rank 1 killer.
---
GAME STILL RUNS LIKE A POTATO ON PS4, I TOOK A 2 WEEK BREAK BECAUSE I WAS TIRED OF IT AND IT'S STILL FUCKING GARBAGE. ALSO THE PLAYERBASE IS LIKELY DISSOLVING??? OR IF NOT, PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY I, A SOLOQUEUE SURVIVOR AT RANK 8, KEEP GETTING PUT AGAINST FUCKING RANK 1 AND 2 KILLERS
---
Lul miss information on this reddit from clueless people. He is saying the truth, it drains part of thx bar. Mask addons reduce cost of swings.
---
NOED is so toxic though :/
---
Sounds like a ddos attack on your router/modem. To prevent these types of attacks I would suggest securing your network/ip address with a professional vpn. They're generally pretty cheap per year and the benefits that come them are multiple. I would recommend [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/?gclid=CjwKCAiA99vhBRBnEiwAwpk-uCuMdAscG6y3TbK6UDx49sYvjm1pgBw0yWR6bCSQtXmh7UoQyg00vhoCz6QQAvD_BwE) 
---
And that affects me how?
---
Why should I be forced to abide by fake rules that other people set? If I want to run noed, blood killers at pallets, use dstrike, run instaheals, op addons, moris, play in a sweaty swf, why shouldn‚Äôt I?
---
Who‚Äôd did I tunnel ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù wait a minute I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how it works 
---
But some people at rank 1 do in fact play pretty much like how a rank 20, or at least 15, would play. Rank does matter, but it matters very little.
---
Rank 16 logic
---
Stop treating survivor mains like shit pls
---
The cornfield.. as if the FPS wasn‚Äôt sub-par enough, the corn is very very hard to track through. And since there are 3 corn maps you get the more than usually
---
I end up blinking into nothing half the time and losing whoever I was chasing 
---
Ahh! Makes sense :P Guess people don't like that? Been playing survivor most of the time, seems the most common thing  to do since the killer is trying to finish us off :P
---
I just can‚Äôt believe it. If it‚Äôs true I‚Äôm sorry for doubting you but there‚Äôs no way everyone in your lobby was rank 20 while you were rank 1
---
That‚Äôs not nurse being bad that‚Äôs just you playing against claudettes
---
Has someone already posted that? I made that in paint lol :/
---
I‚Äôve notice I get less pissed if I just play survivor instead and do it to another person instead.. 
---
The funny thing is that the heavy bleeding exploit is a pretty big deal and the devs put it in the patch notes as a known issue and explained when it happens so now everyone can do it 
---
Theres not enough time to tunnel. Ruin will give them more time to tunnelüëç
