That’s kinda sadistic. A very Freddy thing to do.
---
---
---
I agree that DS has needed a change for a while now, and the change is for countering tunneling, but if a killer really just wants to tunnel someone, couldn't they just slug them for a minute and then avoid DS? I feel that if you go down within a minute of being unhooked then the perk should stay active regardless of how long you are on the ground(deactivates if picked up). That way even if they just ride your a@%, you still have a chance to get away.
---

---
True true true my b that guy just has it happen a lot to him, not a big deal on a subreddit but ig and fb pages have stolen/edited his stuff without credit all the time
---
I have actually noticed that it's nowhere near as bad for killers as it used to be. Also, you get shitloads more bloodpoints which is always nice.
---
Okay lol I'm done with you. Go on with your ignorance XD 
---
I’ve just stopped using it cause 3/5 games i massacre the team before the gens are done
---
I Honestly kind of like the idea that if you've been hooked twice you're exposed, would reward hooking and looking for other survivors. I never use noed because its such a crutch and vs-ing it just cheapens the killers skill, but this would depend on killer actively hooking survivors.
---
 I used to suggest definitely buffing the points for cleansing totems (motivation) or then along the lines that if you found a totem it would light up on your hud until it was destroyed and grey out, so you'd know how many left if say on solo. Noed is counterable but not naturally, it should feel earned for doing extra or on you for not getting all the totems, which is sorta the 2nd objective.
---
Hope there is a change like the ds, which i think i think is actually cool, because like anything the problem is how they're abused, 4 ds is ridiculous, but facing a good killer to only then get hit with noed, is just garbage. Both kill the game's replay-ability. Need to change perks for more situational and earned benefit, not just given regardless of skill or active planning.
---
lmao
---
all I'm saying to you is that you're cowardly for not engaging with the comment you had an issue with.
---
but keep on projecting man. peace 
---
The objective is to do gens. There's no timer to get gens done by, especially with a good looper wasting the killer's time.
---
So is DS still going to make you an auto obsession unless someone else has more or higher tier obsession perks or will it no longer auto start an someone as obsession until they use DS?
---
No. The problem is you're awful at this game as killer if you find gens are being done too fast. You are either unobservant to audio and visual cues that indicates survivors whereabouts or awful at chases. 
---
I only use it because I don’t have surveillance. It basically notifies me at lower ranks when a gen is being touched.
---
You are downvoted for no reason my friend. If everyone would try to do one or two totems each match, that perk wouldn‘t be a problem. 
---
A totem takes only 10 seconds to clear. It‘s not even hard. 
---
And you felt the need to reply with that, why? To have the last word? Pathetic. 
---
It's not meaningless to you because you're still dribbling your obsession. Even if that's all Decisive Strike did, make the killer waste time on every hook and fill up the survivor's struggle meter, it would *still* be a strong perk worth running in a lot of builds. I understand where you're coming from, that a lot of players are freaking out over very little, but it's still going to be a generally less-effective perk than before. 
---
Lol you too bud. 
---
i read it as being that you won't auto start as obsession while using DS and will only get it after using DS
---
Yey I can now hook farm and it isn't a problem 
---
For the obsession, probably. For every other survivor in the game for now on, it's a buff. 
---
Its not licensed this time. Also its going to be the oldest killer in a timeline standpoint.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Eh I play console and honestly once you know to expect it Overcharge becomes less of a threat. The only killer I bother using it with is doctor and that’s because I run his distressing/ overwhelming presence build. 
---
Yep, that’s one of Myers’ best parts
---
The perk is now fucking useless
---
Thats impossible to consistently do if you play solo. I do agree, just cleanse the totems but if you are playing solo, it makes it nearly impossible to find all of the totems and to make sure they are all gone before it pops. 
---
Pretty good art.  
---
also the blood looks pinkish...  
---
is that a mother fricking danganronpa reference?! sorry i had to
---
Well, it is a strategy that works, yes, but it's not exactly "fair" to that survivor that has zero control over when they get unhooked. It's a game so I like to make it fun for everyone involved.
---
Obviously some people don't care about the fun of others though, I understand that. It's best just to ignore them.
---
I actually like it a lot, thumbs up!.
---
I think though that if they stick around to heal then that should be punished.
---
DS can now be completely taken out of the game, and NOED can be completely taken out of the game. One promotes not tunneling, and the other promotes spending time off of gens to cleanse totems. They're both fine.
---
Only after u unhook tho :/
---
You know better than to try logic, it never works. He doesn’t want to hear real answers, he wants to hear his answer parroted back for self gratification.
---
Dear god I’m hoping it’s the first
---
They probably should go for NOED next. I personally never really had a problem with either perk, but I understand why most people do. I like one idea someone posted where NOED lost the instadown but gained 40% cooldown reduction on both successful and unsuccessful hits. Still quite strong, but still gives survs a chance to escape it.
---
Hopefully. I’m definitely taking Unbreakable all the time.
---
I really do think though that QOL would be much better for both sides if the clock stopped. For that person who uses the new DS, gets tunnelled off hook, but does well enough in chase that their perk can’t even activate after being downed...it’s going to feel bad. An anti tunneling perk that doesn’t activate despite the fact you were tunneled...sounds like BHVR lol.
---
If DS is a problem to you, maybe you should follow your own advice LOL baby killer ez
---
Without haste, hope would most likely become meta which would mean that a nrw perk would be needed and killers dont have the room for that kind of situational perk ontop of Noed
---
Without, exposed or limited exposure you have a perk thats really active for about 5% of the game which probably wouldn't be worth even looking at
---
Online disinhibition effect. Goodnight.
---
Getting wooshed already sucks for a person e
---
The problem is gens are literally the only objective survivors have beyond cleansing the occasional totems and rescuing their teammates. They need other objectives that offer a big enough reward to make them stop humping generators throughout the game. Hallowed blight was a great example of this. You didn’t need to run ruin because throughout the match, survivors would see a flower and go do that for a minute. 
---
It doesn’t reward the killer for losing, it punishes the survivors for not playing the other objective, the totems. One of the few perks that can be completely invalidated before it can come into play.
---
Then what is the correct answer?
---
Hmm makes sense, ty!
---
I wouldn‘t mind it having more since I‘m not a silly tunneling twat.
---
It‘s a great change. Killers are cured of a plague while survivors get a counter for tunneling. 
---
I love how, even with the snout and the pig ears in clear view, he still mistook her for a survivor.
---
Sorry for changing the topic here but it would help me come to an understanding with you if you told me what changes you would like to see with noed. And yeah I do agree it is kinda bs sometimes but nonetheless it is counterable
---
If you are a filthy tunneler it is a buff...
---
Someone said the devs said it's a one time use on Twitter.
---
Ok let's fuck up adrenaline, balanced landing and self-care too because killers are too sensible for playing against barely usable perks
---
No, they cater to killers
---

It says you have to get grabbed by the killer. Wont that mean you have to get yoinked?

You know you're not guaranteed to win right?
---
*cough* Kate wears a wig *cough*
---
I unhooked a Meg against a Wraith with MYC, Meg follows me while crying and bleeding everywhere and so the Wraith goes for me, she then sprints off
---
:)
---
Or maybe Diversion and Deliverance?
---
Most likely. A good number of killers have already complained about Adrenaline, citing it as the reason they use NOED without shame.
---
i agree but it still doesn’t counter it. it will always depend on where a pallet is, where a window is, etc..
---
If you m get 3-4k's consistently with camping, you're doing your job. Might not be fun for survivor, but killing is the literal point of the killer. As well I don't believe in tunneling. If the killer sees you they're going for you, shouldn't matter if you were just on the hook or not.
---
Killer's get what they want yet again
---
Oboi I love how you made this comment biased af. It was almost coherent. 
---
D-strike 4v1 was awful. For you to not acknowledge that is why you don't understand why the team thinks NOED is fine. And the dev team is survivor main lmao.
---
Ah, god you need to send me this, I laughed so hard.
---
Run small game, then cleanse the totems
---
Will DS proc if the survivor runs into one of trapper's traps and gets picked up that way?  In that case trapper didnt tunnel, survivor is just dumb
---
Its about getting the kill at that point, if you didnt camp then you should have close to max chase points
---
Nearest Totem &gt; Chest (as long as it isn't too far) &gt; Gen
---
There is no reason why trapper shouldn't be able to carry more than one trap without addons
---
Or just remove the exposed effect from tier 1 and 2 ;) 
---
Well then hopefully [another of my posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/at8oep/ds_is_gone/egzn5yj/) can help change your mind, tbh I'm not sure what they have in common besides being the most annoying perk to interact with on each side. 
---
i do NOT like doctor without his cheek and eye straps it makes me uncomfortable 
---
My my argument is that the devs always do stuff for killers but never fix the real problems with the game
---
Honestly, eventhough I went to play a lot of killer recently, I love when these little fuckers think they can escape with that shit. Like, bitch, I've got Enduring, the chase is gonna be over in 3 seconds again.
---
all other comments i point out non obsession DS is the only part that's scary about DS
---
I don't get what you're trying to say at all in your second sentence
---
I always apologize even though they can't hear me ;(
---
Killers get more bp because they need it for addons (which they lose every match) survivors dont need it (because they dont lose items after every match)
---
Or buff the speed boost and take away the 1hko
---
Taking away the speed boost would kill scratched mirror Myers, and I love playing scratched mirror myers
---
Similar to how make your choice punishes survivors for rescuing teammates off the hook? Or how NOED punishes survivors for doing gens?
---
Non-obsession DS requires you to reach 35% struggle and doesn’t stun as long. 
---
I hope all bees go extinct so we can all go extinct faster too 
---
The hatch game play mechanic is no fun, even as survivor, i dislike sneaking around at the end. Should be something skill based because otherwise killer will slug to 4 man, and if they just hide the whole time, boring for both. 
---
Maybe like an occasional notification, like small game, that killer is looking in survivor's direction that increases refresh time and refines as the match goes on.
---
Not even a little.  Free anti tunneling perk
---
Oh snap I hadn’t even considered this til now. LOL
---
&gt;Dribbling/Slugging the obsession was toxic behavior
---
Lmfuckingao 
---
wraith has awesome add-on variety though they all affect his ability, but doesn't every add-on? he should be at least in A tier for variety
---
get good loser
---
&gt;Taking away the speed boost would kill scratched mirror Myers, and I love playing scratched mirror myers
---
lol what?
---
With scratched mirror you are not supposed to chase as a regular M1 killer. You hit, drop chase and catch the survivor off guard in another opportunity. 
---
Don’t u dare
---
Mmmmmmm
---
Exactly.
---
Can you please tell me what exactly the changes are? I can’t seem to find it anywhere on the internet. Thank you so much!
---
I mean, he is high A tier. My spreadsheets have better documentation if you want my reasoning for my decisions.
---
Oh shit you people are still bitching over BBQ, huh
---
Discussion? Sure, just cause he is a co-creator of the game doesn't mean he is good, he has a job and a family that he values, maybe he doesn't feel like playing it as much since he works on it. Maybe he plays other games like CIV.
---
If you don't use it it deactivates forever btw.
---
Should it be a shit post you think?
---
Dstrike needed to be removed which is good. Now what about fucking noed
---
Oh man, breakdown + DS  + dead hard, maximum terrible teammate insurance
---
Depends on what they were all playing for. All I know is when you compare teabagging to facecamping, 1 of those has absolutely no effect or bearing on the game and the other physically walls a person from even playing the game or ultimately deleting them from the match.
---
I like this one
---
&gt; A Hex rooting its power on hope. You are animated by the power of your Hex Totem when the Survivors are on the verge of escaping.
---
Once the Exit Gate are powered, if there is a Dull Totem remaining on the Map, this Hex is applied to it.
---
While this Hex is active, Survivors suffer from the Exposed Status Effect and your movement speed is increased by 2/3/4 %.
---
The Hex effects persist as long as the related Hex Totem is standing.
---
Salty popcorn!  Butter makes the salt stick better 😉
---
Reread what I said. If someone cleanses a totem, how will you know? Small game won't tell you that they cleansed it. Small game won't tell you what the others are doing. And thats my point. You can't reliably tell what other's are doing. It feels pretty awful to get 4 of the totems and being unable to find the last one before the last gen pops. So you just have to hope your teammates did something besides just sitting on gens the entire game. 
---
I don't find it post worthy to begin with TBH, but it is your post not mine.
---
Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is Decisive Strike getting nerfed? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Decisive Strike to fix this broken game. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought it was polling well in the forums???? This is so fucked.
---
I like this change a lot. Now you at least have to get tunneled to use it, wgich can really save your ass if the gates are open
---
Well theoretically they would playtest it first right?
---
Lol already thinking of ways to be scummy hahaha this will be a dead game 
---
Like how NOED punishes survivors for doing the objective?
---
The post said "nope, there's more than enough counterplay" so I guess it's time to crunch those totems
---
It’s not less than 1s. Its 1.7 seconds. Still incredibly short but you don’t need to hyperbolise. 
---
*laughs in killer*
---
Oh I get that. The speed buff is minimal, but still doesn't change the fact that this perk can literally turn the tide of the game. Thats why I strongly think that if they gave you a notification that you are exposed, like it does with Rancor, it would be perfectly fine. I think changing that small detail would make NOED more bearable to play against without really taking any power away from it. 
---
Yeah I can agree with that. 
---
That's why I think they should buff "the other objective" in b points or something, or let you see the progress in some way, just because time wise, each person would have to check all totems which isn't always feasible, - swf.
---
 bad killers its easier time wise to get all totems but not as much with good/pressure killers. Noed is not that bad its just cheap, especially vs good killers who don't need it.
---
Make it so you have to do 3 dull totems instead of 5
---

*laughs in enduring*
---
Nor.
---
real shit?
---
Strong perks are supposed to be conditional.
---
I see more teams like this as a killer at rank 20-15 than i do at rank 1-5. And im usually here just doing dailies.
---
I think the Entity and a certain other person would certainly enjoy bonding over such despair...
---
BBQ is fine, but yes WGLF should have an additional use to match. That is fair, especially considering the BP survivors get.
---
NOED having both haste and exposed is too much. Either put a timer on the exposed or keep it as is and get rid of haste, I don’t know, just something. Also give a totem counter so it’s no longer a mystery whether the totems are all done. That’s enough for me.
---
Wow. I never knew. Every time I try to use lullaby it gets destroyed before the third stack 
---
Usually whatever is closest to me.. I will cleanse a totem or open a chest if one is near me, otherwise start on a nearby gen.
---
Even as a surv main DS has needed a nerf for a while, it’s a get out of jail free card. There’s a lot of other stuff that needs changes badly but DS needed a change
---
then the meme build of hallowed grounds ruin thrill of the hunt and devour hope wouldnt work
---
I want everyone running it until anti-tunneling habits gets permanently imbedded into every killer's brain so that it doesn't happen anymore regardless of whether it was brought into the match
---
Just play on high gamma 4Head
---
&gt;:(
---
Noed is dumb, but I don’t mind it that much because anyone running it is just admitting they know they aren’t good enough to stop the gens going up before they get a kill
---
No one can agree what perks are weak or what is fun? Does anyone seriously think that No one left behind is good for example? Does anyone think getting tunnelled by a franks mixtape legion is fun? I don't see your point since we actually can agree on whats weak and whats unfun, and the guy did list some specifics
---
Decisive Strike was only a big problem in SWF groups. 1 Decisive is only a minor inconvenience. If you follow one guy the WHOLE game, the problem is on you and not the perk. 4 Decisives IS goddamn awful. That is a mess. Other than that it's uncommon to face multiple decisives from solo survivor games.
---
Decisive Strike is pretty useless now with this change. I can only see it being useful when you're getting camped and have to be rescued before 50% or something like that. Even then the killer can slug you just in case (Unbreakable comes in???). If he got a mori then its a GG for you. Also Good survivors who get tunneled after being unhooked are likely going to last more than 60 seconds against a killer, so it's like running with only 3 perks. They have to let themselves get downed before the timer ends if they want to use it.
---
Surely we need to address some things for killers now. Like how Legion has no counterplay. Frank's Mixtape. Iri Heads and Infantry belt. Spirit's prayer beads. NOED, Dying Light, things like that.
---
With these recent survivor nerfs, its making me think that the devs are balancing the game around SWF. But the problem is: SWF is still very powerful, OVERpowered. And solo queue is getting fucked more with each update. As a solo survivor I have had to become more self-sufficient these last few weeks. I have to take perks that help myself, because most of the time I have potato teammates, and they sure as hell are not going to help me get out alive.
---
I don't know maybe its just me. But this change to Decisive Strike does nothing to address the SWF problem, and it fucks solo survivors over.
---
It still only works once.
---
No, no it does not. This is categorically false, and addressed in the article. Stop fearmongering.
---
Am survivor, I concur
---
Totem counter in base game when? Seriously tho, if we’re gonna pretend cleansing totems is an actual counterplay we need to make it so running swf isn’t mandatory to get them don’t vs any killer who isn’t a complete scrub 
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Decisive_Strike
---
&gt;If you are not the Obsession, once per trial, while in the Killer's grasp, once the wiggle meter has reached 45/40/35 %, succeed a Skill Check to automatically fill the rest of the wiggle meter and escape from the Killer's grasp.
---
Having knowledge that the killer has NOED defeats it's purpose. The idea is that every killer benefits from this perk existing and benefits from matches being slowed on average from totem cleansing, whether they're running the perk or not. 
---
No one ever said NOED was fine here man, you cant use NOED as a reason to defend DS, they are both bad for the game and one terribly designed perk doesnt justify the other.
---
The fact that it garuntees even the worst of killers a kill
---
I laughed harder at this than I should have.
---
NOED honestly isn't that powerful unless you go against lower ranks. Most of the time at the end of the game, survivors either leave or get the totem(after they realize you have it). It doesn't guarantee kills. I'd rather go against a killer with NOED as survivor than play killer against a SWF with 3-4 decisive strikes.
---
People complain about flashlights arent really upset at the item, flashlights just usually come from a group of swf bullying them with 3 flash lights.
---
One design flaw doesnt justify another design flaw
---
Death plagiarism the un-wise. 
---
It's all pasta
---
I’m surprised I even read this but it’s not as op as No Mither
---
Yeah
---
I like how this sub is pretending human beings aren’t capable of waiting 60 seconds to down someone, entirely negating the perk and allowing killers to still tunnel off the hook
---
How about just making decisive strike an ultra rare item? That way you waste an item slot and its not going to be an every game thing?
---
Out of curiosity did you take models out of the game or make them yourself?
---
You are a **bold** one. 
---
I got the achievement 
---
Lol survivor nerf again, salty killers seeing that rank 12 on the horizon, just a few more nerfs babe and we'll be cruising with the big boys.
---
*Sniffles* spoken like a true R15 ;(
---
In all seriousness tho they don’t cater to anyone, but definitely not the 1/5 portion of their playerbase. If you gotta go one way or the other, from a business standpoint you want to make the most people happy.
---
Where does that say the killer takes a reduced stun?
---
Its quite good 
---
&gt; If you are not the Obsession, once per trial, while in the Killer's grasp, once the wiggle meter has reached 45/40/35 %, succeed a Skill Check to automatically fill the rest of the wiggle meter and escape from the Killer's grasp.
---
I don't think that's Huntress lullaby. It's a rare glitch where the skillchecks are invisible. Had it happen to me one game. Quick restart of the game fixed it
---
They're downloadable from the workshop. Most of the models I use are from Mark2580. Some of the higher quality character models (I have Dwight and Meg) are from omgwtfbbq.

---
Not really. They are both perks that reward players for bad gameplay. Decisive Strike gives you a second chance when you get downed. And NOED gives you a second chance when you were not good enough to apply gen pressure in the game.
---
When I heard about that here’s what immediately came to mind:
---
Hey dying light, fuck off!
---
Maybe he is swf with the last guy? Last guy prob found hatch and the 3rd guy wants him to have it asap.
---
True, I just had a game held hostage for 45 minutes because of this perk. Adrenaline can be a pain n the ass but I ind some other perks to be more annoying more often. 
---
Also poor Freddy with this perk kills when I play him. Also, does it heal you out of Deep Wounds into healthy or just out of deep wounds?
---
I hate you
---
Definitely good news! I like that it will actively discourage tunneling, too. 
---
As a survivor that never uses DS and a killer that doesn't care for NOED these "discussions" always keep me entertained
---
The issue that made killers tunnel the obsession could have been fixed, easily, without absolutely ruining DS. DS was fine as is, it didn’t even need a buff.
---
Fair, I think it would have to be hook progression based cause people who play this way care much more about kills than BP. Bp punishment alone would never deter someone. I just brought it up cause rarely do I ever see someone who wants survivors slowed down acknowledge the fact it would benefit the campers. Didn’t mean to single you out.
---
:D
---
Dying Lightest
---
So, where are the NOED changes?
---
To add in. Why is it a game like Magic: the Gathering, somewhat, still popular? Because it shifts meta a lot. Take Modern format, bans and unbans keep it smooth so no one deck is "win button". 
---
Yup!
---
I didn't say anything about my mom
---
I wonder what the upvote rate of this comment is
---
Lol @ people saying do totems. If you have time to get all totems and all gens in anything under a 3 man swf there was no point in doing the totems because the killer was dogshit and probably couldn’t get you with noed anyways. Totem counter or noed nerf needs to happen soon. 
---
Noed has plenty of ways to be countered.
---
I’m a solo survivor and tbh I’m excited for the change
---
And for the people that complain about NOED or compare the two, I always make the effort to cleanse totems even against killers you wouldn’t expect to have NOED. Maybe it’s the bloodpoints or maybe it’s OCD but either way, totem cleansing isn’t hard and makes one of the killers perk slots useless 
---
Oh shit you people are still bitching over Decisive strike, huh
---
Depends on the situation and the map to be honest. If NOED is involved and I’m the one on the hook I personally want my teammates to leave if they can’t find the totem within 20-30 seconds.

---
Is it bad if the only thing this meme does is make me wonder if thats ellen degeneris or gordon ramsey?  
---
Soon 
---
in the Q&amp;A below this announcement, the devs said they think that NOED has plenty of counters and is in a good place now, so I don't think they will.
---
The stun is during pickup, so no chance to dribble. But I do agree, I do think the nerf was a little too strong. The fact that the timer goes down on the ground is absolutely stupid. 
---
DS gets nerfed but NOED is still ok. Fuck off devs
---
That was very contributive to this actual conversation! No but really, i have no problem with being wrong, but you gotta prove me wrong with facts &amp; examples, not just your insult lol. 
---
Yep, totem counter please. Such a simple thing to add that would really improve things.

I only corrected the dribble part. Which you are still wrong about. So not only am I the only one of us who read the post it seems I'm also the only one between us who read your own comment.
---
But thats fucking stupid so no
---
Me neither. I don’t use it myself, but when I play surv, I make sure the killer won’t have it.
---
Good killers vs non 3-4 mans will 4k almost every time in the current state of the game, and if you’re good at nurse it’s like impossible not to 4k vs randoms. 
---
That said swf and low teir killers make the odds more like 50%
---
Im saying those are factors that prove this game is becoming killer bias. Before this ds nerf, it was really heavy survivor bias. This game cant be balanced. Devs don’t know how to. 
---
Lol. Fucking dumb as hell. And I say that as someone who rarely if ever uses it. How does this affect killer obsession perks? Remember Me? Save The Best For Last?
---
Dribbling is to exploit a mechanic, it's to prevent the DS user from ever having the opportunity to hit their DS.  It doesn't work all the time if there's no hook nearby anyways.  
---
Cleansing totems is something you do because it's an intended game design choice.  If you fear NOED, you do the five totems around the map.  If there are no dull totems, there is no more fear of NOED.  
---
SAVAGE!!!!!
---
Make NOED 1 minute of exposed with infinite time of increased speed.
---
nice meme
---
Especially considering it's pretty universally despised and you will get flack for it.
---
You're cute when you're dismissive and disingenuous 
---
In what way has DS every been healthy for the game?
---
[removed]
---
There's 0 point in running the current DS if you don't get tunneled other than it being a crutch extra life for survivors to have is the point I'm trying to make.
---
Mid to low tier? Probably Freddy then
---
D-Strike won't do much its only a 3-second stun and if they run enduring that's only .75 seconds. They'll be back down in no time.
---
THIS is exactly the problem.  The devs have a serious issue with balance in this game.  Lower ranks is a shit show.  You need to 1. raise the killer skill floor, and 2. institute an MMR system based entirely on W/L.  You escape, go up in rank.  You die, go down.  For killers: 2k go nowhere, 3k and 4k are your pip/double pip (minus for 0k and 1k).
---
"cunts" -Noob3
---
I mean.. I'm saying this as a survivor main who used to use DS a lot.. but now if play killer and down someone recently to do with a hook - I'm slugging them for 60 seconds so they don't have DS available.  Gjob devs - you made the game so much more fun now  🙄
---
Lol and people here say that this sub does not have a killer bias.
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Thats where your choice of killer and play-style comes into play. For example, a nurse is a lot scarier to play against then a Freddy or a trapper or a legion ( imo ) but if the nurse just face-camps &amp; the Freddy, trapper, or legion two hook everyone, then of course the nurse looks a lot less scary. 
---
Thanks Alot, OP!
---
You are going to want the killer to catch you in order to help your team then.
---
Ez 
---
I said what I said
---
A good killer usually won't let the gens get finished, so you usually don't want late game perks. Good player won't need NOED to get kills, while a bad player will get to use it as a crutch to get a kill despite messing up and losing the game.
---
DS doesn't give you Deep Wounds.  DS doesn't require an ally to be running the perk.  DS Triggers off of Deliverance and Self unhooks.  If you'd rather just hope the person that rescues you is running BT, then be my guest.  You're guaranteed to have DS, but you don't know what your team is running.
---
Dear God, shut the fuck up.  Now you're all going on about "BROKEN HITBOXES QQ" when Noob3 just released a video showing him, a Canadian that lives in some prairie wasteland, having the most fucked hitboxes that I've never seen in my life in any P2P game.  
---
If NOED goes off, you're at fault for letting it go off.  Cleanse the totems you fucking snowflake.  
---
The only perk I know here is DS.
---
Which, conveniently enough, would pair extremely well with the changes they just made to DS :)
---
I’m calling it right now Dying Light will break and stack it’s effect each time you kill someone who has the obsession (Ex: u get D striked, mori them, boom dying light. Someone else D strikes you later and you hook/kill them and now dying light gives 50% reduction bc it’s gonna glitch) 
---
I’m calling it right here right now
---
I mean, I usually run perk builds that help me in chases/win chases and tend to have a play style of being the bait so that’s not really a big deal for me. If I can distract the killer for long enough for the rest of the team to complete gens and escape then I’m fine with dying 
---
people have been complaining about broken hitboxes since before no0b3 but got off! xD
---
Community - Complains about DS and wants it fixed/nerfed.
---
Behavior - Buffs DS and calls it a fix/nerf.
---
Not to mention making Dying Light even more of a joke of perk than it was. This is the worst fucking idea they've ever had, what the fuck have they been smoking to think this is in any way good?
---
It's insane that people don't get this
---
You get to clench your teeth and embrace the balance.
---
[That is false.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/48455/upcoming-ds-changes-q-a#latest)
---
I don't run DS ever, cause I don't like one time perks, but I am mad about the devs deciding to change it.
---
I'm mad because for all the "meta" perks survivors get, killers get similar (if not better) perks, and they don't get theirs nerfed.
---
I just hate to see what looks like, imo, the devs pandering to one side of the community.
---
Not that the killers complaints aren't justified.
---
But survivors have been complaining about NOED, or BBQ+C or whatever other skill is the current meta, and it doesn't change.
---
Their meta hasn't changed in so long BBQ has been off the shrine for years.
---
That's what I'm mad about.
---
Your last sentence completely misses the point. GG
---
*Diversion needs another buff* 
---
No changes to those. Makes Dying Light complete fucking garbage, though.
---
While true, I do believe it says in the Bible "If thou art not at the head of the table, expect a colder plate".
---
Meaning don't you dare take my Fredboi's rework spot from me, dammit 
---
Doesn't say anything about a reduced stun kiddo.
---
Probably because once they start going against killers with skill, their toxicity gets them killed. They feel invincible against new killers.
---
NOED is ok because it's already weak AF.
---
And this is a DS buff, not a nerf.
---
IT'S ONE OF HIS ULTRA RARES, SO UNFORTUNATELY RELYING ON THAT IS OFF THE MENU
---
Never happening because they're unnecessary m
---
He lives in BC, not the prairies.
---
No, it means you're getting slugged for 30 seconds or so 
---
NOED counters Adrenaline not DS
---
Idk why I read this but, cool!
---
You're using words wrong to frame a narrative. Its super disingenuous. 
---
And how many counters are there to the current DS? And how many that also help the Killer in his only objective of sacrificing someone?
---
Yeah that's true, in my case I always have to clean the 5 totems because my teammates just want to gen rush
---
You cannot even formally define such thing as tunneling. How can you fix it without reversing the problem? 
---
Oh they'll always find something to complain about instead of learning how to counter map tile looping and other stuff. With the Self-Care nerf and Exhausted nerf, gutting Vigil indirectly, Borrowed Time nerf and now DS they'll probably conplain about Adrenaline and keys.
---
It helped survivors run the Killers for longer that way gens could be done faster and if the guy that runs ds had adrenaline he could be fine the perk helped the games to go faster
---
Yeah, how dare those people play survivor. 
---
It was garbage yesterday too lol
---
DS is a bandaid for lack of survivor skill
---
They largely sucked anyway
---
That’s not even accurate. They just changed it to perk that is ONLY good to counter tunneling, it already had that quality.
---
Killers who take DL are going to have to take an Ebony now just to make sure it still fucking works as designed.
---
Honestly, I see a massive increase in Ebony use in general as it's now the ultimate DS counter. RIP Survivors.
---
Yes, but the point is that the USAGE of it is not nearly so ez. It's not like you can whip this out any time you want and reset the chase. It's like a way to prevent tunneling and camping. I wish they'd actually fix those things rather than introducing perks (breakdown, borrowed time, deliverance) or changing old ones (DS, STBFL) to be different. Plus, the big question is: How would things like Dying Light work now? They're changing so much but not at the heart of the problem.
---
How so?
---
There's a faq, you don't need to speculate wildly. Just go read it
---
See Rockstars got the right idea, wish people would learn. 
---
Replace Hope with Adrenaline 
---
Son, this is captain castle you're talking to.him and salty Jim are our residential dick cheese peddlers lol.  He was born in the fires of flame wars and raised by the ashes.
---
Actually, hes probably a nice guy and im just talking out my ass

That's an awesome postcard!
---
And makes the perk even more ridiculous. They didn't fix anything. This is worse.
---
It really is. If you dont tunnel mori or tunnel facecamp the obsession immediately then you wasted it. If you play normally and 3hook that bad boi then chances are gens are done and they got the gate already. 
---
&gt; Succeeding or failing the Decisive Strike skill-check will disable the perk.
---
See, that's where you're wrong. Why would they put them together like that? Because if you succeed the skill check, you can't use the perk. And, based on this information, the same applies for failing the skill check. Not fearmongering, just actually using my brain.
---
What's wrong with NOED?
---
Multiple counters to NOED? Did I miss a counter beyond cleansing totems?
---
I actually think this'd be a half decent nerf to DS. 
---
If he's still on the ground a minute later then you just lost 2 gens minimum lol
---
The feels :( 
---
This is in no way a buff. It is clearly updated to nerf the effect of DS.
---
It might help with save the best for last and play with your food. 
---
yeah but rip legacy and event exclusives :(
---
So he runs the killer for 5 minutes and should still get ds? Nah
---
So what is different about DS?
---
Someone is mad about DS changes i see.
---
What happens when you get tunneled then slugged 
---
He's specifically referring to noed being active so you're kind of missing his point.
---
Yeah, maybe for two seconds.
---
Seriously! Thats what you say. 
---
There's the outplay of getting generators done as last survivor; I found and camped hatch as Myers; was considering the good ol AFK bluff, but then survivor popped the last Genny. Downed them, but still they could have crept around for the hatch as I went to go check exit gates.
---
I actually think Exit Gates should either be auto-opened on being last survivor with all gens done; makes the hatch standoff more interesting and dynamic, even though it does skew it in Player's favor. Maybe it will encourage more last hour gen plays.

XD
---
The picture in the bottom left!
---
Saddly it does change. So if you tunneled and killed the first obbession. Then someone uses ds you and becomes obbession dying light will reset. And you gotta mori the new obbession to get it back on. I used to only bring a green mori with dying light. Now if I run it... itll be eboni. 
---
Well now you do. Basically at the launch of the game noed was so unbelievably op that people that get upset about it now, and didn’t go through all that at launch, have it easy and don’t realize it.
---
I just use the shards for cosmetics. I use the real money on killers.
---
Neat. Didn't see that. Will update my post above:
---
&gt;Dying Light
---
&gt;
---
&gt;- The active Obsession has the altruistic action speed bonus while they &gt;are alive.
---
&gt;- If the active Obsession is killed, Dying Light's de-buff is applied to all remaining survivors.
---
&gt;- If, at some point in the trial, another player becomes the Obsession, Dying Lights de-buff will be removed as the Obsession is considered alive again.
---
Wasn't it buffed though? Now you don't have to be the obsession to use it. What am I missing?
---
I'm surprised I had to go far this down to see someone disagreeing. I think DS is kinda useless now especially with borrowed time where I don't even need to hit a skill check. Also, what's stopping the killer from slugging? I think it was kind of an unnecessary nerf. Yeah its annoying but so are a lot of "meta" killer perks like ruin, noed, bbq, etc. 
---
I mean you can see the post where he did 6 hours ago dummy
---
You do realise the whole idea of the killer being obsessed with you is not meant something super positive for survivors, a deranged serial killer is **obsessed** with you. Its either meant to be dangerous for you, or benefiting the killer. The fact that Dstrike is being changed so the Obsession is a downside of using it, is good.
---
NOED is fine. Just destroy totems!
---
I edited the post, let me know what you think of the changes
---
The FAQ says they have no plans to change NOED. 
---
edited the post let me know what you think of the changes
---
Don't stand there hide from a distance so the other survivors fall for the bait. Works evrytime lol
---
Face camping usually goes away after ranking up for awhile. Killers realize they will do better by not camping. This is always 100% though.
---
wah wah please nerf the scary DS and make NOED better - crappy killer mains
---
probably. He is in a weird spot where he is a literal nightmare for newer/Bad Players and a Joke against skilled Players 
---
In US (and Canadian) English they're used interchangeably with (and more frequently than) they/them as single subject gender neutral pronouns when the gender is unknown.
---
Ah that would explain it. I didn't see the FAQ, I'm on mobile.
---
1 person can't effectively cover all totems, and on top of that I shouldn't have to invest time into a "mabye". Killers shouldn't also get rewarded for losing. PLS think.
---
Ohhh... you meant is healthier for *survivors*... now i understand.... (like if survivors needed DS to run the killer for the entire game)
---
By that logic youre gonna get facecamped for having adrenaline. Nobody knows if you have either perk but hey, the potential is there, better assume the worst.
---
Awful logic.
---
It only removes the deep wounds status and you stay injured which makes the heal + wake up even more sad for freddy.
---
Ruined they nerfed it too much imo 
---
Or they run to you and sit at your feet till you get into struggle.. y u do dis. 
---
Way too often lol
---
Adrenaline ist meta and most of the time ds users already run it. That's why i didnt include it. I guess you could almost say the same for hope but whatsevs. :)
---
Oh Boy, you are missing out on fun!
---
Claudette with self care 
---
Take my burrowed time son. My time has come- hooked salutes as you run out gate and dies-
---
What's proxy camping??? 
---
Yes, but now it's even *more* garbage. 
---
It’s always claudette or jake for me
---
It’s not hard to just find the survivor again once you get DS 
---
This is absolutely correct.
---
Too many killers start to resort to slugging, camping, tunnel, when 2 or 3 gens pop. It's not fun, and I would rather play for fun than kills. 
---
Not the obsession from the start - Buff.  
---
Easier check to activate - Buff.  
---
Check procs on pick-up - Buff.  
---
Successful DS completely negates active Dying Light - Buff.  
---
Only available after unhook - Nerf.  
---
Only available for 60s - Nerf.  
---
4 buffs, 2 nerfs, net gain is a buff.
---
and deliverance
---
I love playing either side, and this change is cool. I love any new meta shifts as a moba player.
---
Try not to shame every person for disagreeing with you as bias. Thats.... bias.
---
Huh, TIL. We just use the singular they here for unknowns (except for situations where someone guesses), I've never heard of any cultures where you're meant to use he/him
---
Is this it how we progress in the game?
---
Wierd flex but ok
---
Why not just make him not be of Italian descent then and just make him born in Argentina? Why go out of there way to make him Italian? Think about it.
---
Candyman 
---
Yep they don’t know how to balance stuff so they just kill perks but leave stuff like noed as is
---
whats your player+devotion level??
---
&gt; Killer's win games by stalling the game out long enough to kill the Survivors
---
More or less, and fewer things can stall the game easier than one less survivor on the map.
---
&gt; and while Tunneling certainly helps them (via eliminating one of the players and drastically slowing it down), it's not always the most efficient way of doing things.
---
It depends on the context of the game. If you have the freshly unhooked survivor and the full HP one side by side, then smacking the injured one and putting them back on the hook again is a swing in your favor; however, if you have to go on an ill-advised extended chase to catch them, you're better off not wasting the time.
---
&gt; Allowing a survivor to leave to heal (or just slugging them) and then chasing after the second survivor who is full health forces three survivors off of generators, which also drastically slows the game down.
---
Not at high ranks it doesn't, at least not the "leave them to heal" portion. Red rank survivors that aren't completely boosted will stay injured and finish the generators and not waste time healing. Those that are good enough at looping a killer for extended periods of time will often elect to stay injured. 
---
I am, how about you?
---
They're not equivalent, NOED is way more OP.
---
Noo way. Whenever I play killer and there are so many hits that should NOT connect (and every so often some that should but don’t for unknown reasons). Hitboxes are definitely fucked and I notice it way more playing killer (particularly huntress). I can’t aim for shit yet I have god like aim playing her and my hatchets magically curve corners! 
---
It’s worthless at red ranks. Unless you’re doctor with unnerving. 
---
🦀 🦀🦀🦀
---
That's BS i have watched and played hundreds of hours of huntress
---
cursed video
---
Well d strike is now utterly useless, what killer is going to pick up an obsession after getting saved, hes still going to tunnel, and then slug and rotate until the 60s are up.
---
You lose a token once every 10 seconds every time OoO is active.  Basically you’ll waste all your distortion tokens within 1 minute of the start of the game.  Absolutely never take the 2 perks together unless you’re just meme-ing around.
---
The irony is he still destroys low rank players, which is hilarious
---
It would burn through the stacks crazy quick
---
So basically ebony mori counters it completely
---
I don't really play survivor. I know a few of the perks but Idk about how the icon for most of them look.
---
It would be at the level of No Mither+Self Care
---
I didn't until now
---
Thanks
---
this is a buff for the perk...
---
Lol nice copypasta theft
---
That AND OoO with Distortion.
---
Completely false statement from the killer side.  
---
The optimal way to win for killer is to down someone and be good enough at scouting or have high enough mobility that you can find another survivor to immediately get into a chase, and ideally down them before or as that first survivor is unhooked.
---
What meta shifts are you talking about? With the exhaustion nerf about 6 months back and to the nerf/change to BT only the survivors meta has changed not the killers.  Hex:Ruin, BBQ&amp;Chilli, NOED, Enduring, and nurse's calling are still amongst the top perks for killers and they haven't been changed much (Save from NC in which the range was reduced a bit and NOED which lets be honest is powerful against a team of solo players vs SWF)
---
Also this game is not a moba it's a asymmetrical survival horror. If you are gonna try and call out someone without putting all the cards on the table that is just plain disingenuous.
---
That's a fair concern. Lets say there are 3 generators left to get for the last survivor, as a killer you should be able to patrol that effectively. But they also have opportunity to be stealthy and smart. But one little mistake on there part could lead to death.
---
I'm a killer main, but I feel like the hatch is good as is. I think it's a pretty fair system except for hatch standoffs.
---
Been common place since I was a kid. "He/him" is just a general default when gender is unknown. You do see some who make an effort to be more specific, especially in context of writing in books/movies/games to avoid confusion, but in basic conversation? Meh.
---
Self care does have a negative consequence, it's at a very slow speed, which wastes possible gen time therefore slowing the game down. 
---
But I think they mean it's good for survivors as it's a perk that helps against tunneling but I agree that it isn't the greatest perk anymore and I don't think I'll even think about using (not that I ever really did)
---
Yes, they say so in the FAQ. Up to 4 survivor could be moried by rancor if all the cards are right.
---
It benefits survivor quality of life. 
---
Ahh so feng dress wasn't bugged and she really is a trap
---
I can't find this thread right now but a while back someone posted the 4 most popular perks for the survivors with the highest escape %. Premonition was one of those perks. It's literally useful with all killers except Michael in tier 1 since it lets you know 1-2 seconds in advance before terror radios does. 
---
It can be, those most killers will be able to see you (especially a bright Laurie) before they drop down. However, a Vest Tapp or Dwight with Iron Will would blend in perfectly...
---
He’s been playing different games before the DS changes.
---
Why does this remind me of those "if train a left the station" math questions 
---
If your high lvl you can run the Killer the entire game but it helps lower levels like me
---
BBQ did get hit-&gt; lockers hide peoples auras, only reason I run it is for the bp, I like fleshing out every character in a game and well BBQ gives me the opportunity for a quicker grind, otherwise imo discordance (I think that's it? Legion perk for gens) is a bit better imo for the instant knowledge of 2+ people doing gens 
---
b0osted
---
I agree. I use make your choice often and obviously half the time I find the freshly unhooked. Am I just supposed to walk away because salty survivors call that tunneling? Like the point is to win not make sure everyone has their turns. I'm a killer not a babysitter. Old DS isnt fun either though so I'll have to wait and see.
---
The only change i think it should get is giving you the 1000bp and cleansing before its active if you do the last totem
---
You like getting face camped? Because this is how you get face camped.... They could take DS out of they picture completely, just face camping you or camping the area. If you don't get unhooked you can't use it..... "I think we've done a pretty good.....JJOOBBB .. so far"
---
Dying Light can be deactivated if someone uses D strike after the first guy dies. Holy Fuck
---
Mlga op
---
&gt; forces killers to run another perk as counter(enduring) 
---
Enduring is a best in slot, except in a few instances where brutal strength would be better (clown, wraith with the uncloak on break add-on)
---
It making DS weaker is just a bonus
---
DS (on obsession) is counter-able and never a game changer unless all 4 survivors are rushing gens in a correct order and the dropped survivor is next to a nasty setup. (Which in that case you'd just go apply map pressure instead, or have slugged DS user to create it)
---
It REALLY only is good at putting a killer in a weak spot into a weaker one under certain circumstances. (And good when survivors are communicating and a non-obsession survivor has DS)
---
Isn't it f1?
---
that makes dl so obsolete wtf
---
Get a job there and fix it yourself... It's not like their not trying
---
It depends upon what time you're on really, if its around 5 or 6 PM then its survivor bias, 8 or 9 PM? Killer bias.
---
Everyone says vigil isn’t a good perk. Would you rather have someone run decisive or vigil with this buff?
---
They just want to unlock bbq :(
---
i am aware. im saying that after you get unhooked. if you dont use it. you can use it the next time you get unhooked. that is my understanding of it.
---
Tired of people claiming this will make the game a slugfest.
---
You dont know who has it. You think any killer is really gonna sit around after each down for a MINUTE to avoid a 3 second stun you are out of your mind. You imply slugging for a minute but the killer is taking a huge gamble in that case, another survivor is not guaranteed, and by the end of the minute that revive bar will be full and ready for a drive-by heal.
---
And as if, as fucking if the original DS didnt encourage a slug more: You knew its coming, why even argue like this new version encourages it when before you fucking knew they had it. It will be less slugging if anything, where do these people keep coming from?!
---
Self Care takes a lengthy amount of time and then the killer can run Nurse's to find you so taking the time out to heal might not matter. Even NoEd has a heavy risk to it, since it can be taken out before it's ever even in use by a slighly competent survivor(s).
---
Honestly, DS wasn't that great of a perk. If the killer was decent then maybe you got another fifteen second chase. It's like Deadhard to me, overrated and buys a very minimal amount of time for you. Most killers won't be completely blind and will be able to guess or just see where you ran to.
---
Claudette. Every. Single. Time
---
Im liking this meme way too hard.
---
&gt;As an aside, I think most people who rage at NOED don't play killer because if they did they would know that it's pretty useless unless survivors make the decision to play like potatoes
---
I assume you meant "not like potatoes"
---
Yeah, NOED is useless if you're at all a decent killer. NOED is basically admitting to the fact that you can't win chases/ can't apply map pressure, so a perk that activates when all 5 gens are done seems viable.
---
The problem survivors have with it is that their experience is just "I did gens/ ran killer all game without getting downed, and now I'm one tapped, face camped, and no one can find the totem and leaves instead"
---
Ding ding ding, this meeting is called to order!
---
Dont think of it on a personal level. DS can be ran by 4 people now, so its not just 1 stun and done. The entire team could potentially punish the killer for the tunnel, thus discouraging the style.
---
Noed and bbq are not an issue. Noed adds excitement to a chase after sitting through 5 boring gens. Adds a little thrill.  And if you don't like noed then cleanse boy. And bbq is fun, what's the point of playing survivor of you're too scared to get chased. Killers should be stronger than survivor. And DS didn't need nerfing either in my opinion. 
---
Surviving a match has almost zero correlation to your skill level though
---
Shouldn't get a get out of jail free card for losing a chase. A good survivor even without it can loop for 3 gens so with it you can loop the whole game. That's the biggest reason it needed changed. A "low level survivor" as you put it shouldn't be given a free pass when they are playing (more than likely) an equally skilled killer 
---
Listen bub, Decisive Strike is one use only. It always has been. The language clarifies this. If you hit the action button during the skill check, it means you've used DS, and the perk deactivates. If you get it, the killer is stunned and you are freed and injured. If you miss, you miss, and nothing happens. If you do not hit the action button, DS is preserved, and can be used again on a different pickup. It's really simple.
---
I dont teabag killers, I teabag to say hello to my survivor buds. 
---
The highest correlation is this formula:
---
length of chase/ # of pallets used, as long as the chase lasted at least 30 seconds.
---
Additionally doing gens closer to the center/ gens close to proximity of another to deny an easy 3 gen patrol
---
Noed tweaks/nerfs, hit boxes, legion  
---
Tbh any counter for BBQ is a pain in the ass, I spend more of my game in a locker than I should if my randos won't stop getting downed, OR I can spend my game chasing the killer down to avoid it that way, OR I can hope that the killer isn't looking too hard behind a gen. No matter what it's still absolutely obnoxious and for that kind of bloodpoint gain it's really unneccesary.
---
In my opinion, anyways. Honestly take what I say with a grain of salt lol
---
Killers will still tunnel.  Make a notification that the killer has noed prior to activation or the debuff last so long.  
---
You had people who thought DS was fine as is, you had other who were super salty about the perk. Do you really think people are all agreeding? 
---
I cannot upvote this enough. My job is to control my fun . If you wanna have fun then have fun but it's not my job to do that for you or to ensure it for you. My job is to kill you and Imma do that however I see fit. 
---
The point was that the killer can slug you and wait out the time, oh yeah "super anti- tunnel" perk. 
---
Cause the other 3 aren't good at the game then. When this comes up, let the chase bait run around you/ try to bodyblock while you clean up the gen monkeys.
---
I don't really get the point you're trying to make, because getting the doors open are what allow survivors to start being cheeky/ making altruistic plays with an escape.
---
Killer mains don’t realize 2k is a win. They think every round they should have is a 4k. And they think killers are underpowered because they can’t get 4Ks. 
---
Nope. You could just be good and have them dead by 2 or 3 gens 
---
No, I actually have no idea what you're trying to say, you were talking to another redditor who complained about the issues I'm also upset about, but you told him it was latency on the survivors part. Then you posted saying that the killer issues you're experiencing aren't latency. 
---
I did! Got me my adept lorie as well!
---
Uhhh... Can't they still dribble with this?
---
Yes to DH and DS. No to breakdown. Since the hook rework they spawn way too close to each other to ever free you at old 35% wiggle let alone 100%
---
Did you ignore the comment I made literally 2 up about having to deal with ruin because you can't find it?
---
I'll tell you what, buff Small Game to show auras of totems within 12m and I'll stop complaining. It is shit as is (but I still run it because of ruin and noed every game) and a buff would bring it to relevancy and diversity survivor builds while also leaving noed alone. 
---
I'm not complaining just to complain but I know you will never see it that way. 
---
&gt;far to difficult to defend as a killer
---
Don't defend hatch as a killer. 4k's aren't important; you're gonna double pip if you killed 3 people without tunnelling/ camping. You earn barely any extra bp. Let em have it and move onto the next game asap.
---
I'm talking about the killer slugging you. OP was talking about the killer juggling or slugging to wait out the timer. He was wrong about the juggling, but the timer wait out is still a viable option unless they tweak it. Making it NOT an anti-tunneling perk, but just fucking useless. 
---
Survivors with an IQ higher than 10 huh? Then you'll be fine.
---
What's to stop the killer from slugging for 60 seconds?
---
Dont you understand, as a killer I AM entitled to a 4k as a 110% movement speed killer without using my power or add ons while on a survivor favored map. I also need to be able to brainlessly do this without thinking or else the game is survivor sided.
---
I had a match where the 4th person didn't load in so I did my daily requirement and then made sure all survs knew we were going to farm. Started to do the 2 hooks per surv thing so they could rack up points too and one guy dc'd during his turn. I was completely baffled. 
---
The Bee- Uninstall game forever
---
Can we just appreciate Freddy's mori? I am a survivor main and I love that shit.
---
You’re standing around the general proximity of the hook
---
Shaggy is good idea for DBD haha
---
Only if there is another DS user. chances are there will be, imo it should stack.
---
Decisive strike saves you from OTHER survivors from being unsuccessful. You shouldn't want perks that stop the hunter from being successful. Hunter having perks that do so isn't a valid argument since you're literally saying that a perk stopping someone from being unsuccessful is bad. Not only that make your choice can easily be counted by doing the main part of the game, hiding.
---
Oh and noed.. cleanse totems.
---
Thanks for the update, there wasn't this FAQ before. They didn't really specify in the case of STBFL when you kill your obsession, but following the pattern is safe to assume you can continue to gain stacks if another survivor assumes the dead obssession place. I just find it kinda unfair that you can't use DS more times on a match, you could use up to two times anyway. Deliverance you can only use once by design, when you actually have it active on your first hook, this looks ristring just for the sake of it
---
Person with half a brain\* My bad
---
Its hilarious. NOED is such a stupid perk. Its the equivalent of enabling cheat codes, thats how strong it makes you. Play poorly, get insanely buffed. But its got so many counters btw :\^) . 
---
The survivor equivalent of NOED would be like when you get hooked for a third time you instantly jump off, move 10% faster, blind the killer and all exit gates immediately get opened. The killer can counter this by not hooking you 3 times :).
---
Good luck catching a competent survivor without a hatchet. You can catch one without a bottle as the clown though. 
---
Because it forces you to waste a ton of time doing totems. Which means the killer is doing their objective and you are not 
---
If you teabag at the gate after you’ve already won.... your mom is a whore. 
---
Sure, of course. I hold no doubt that Mcote is putting a lot of efforr into dbd, but I feel like if they actually played they might be able to fix actually issues instead of listening to salty killers and toxic survivors. 
---
Haha
---
I REALLY HATE GOING AGAINST SWF AS A TRAPPER
---
PART OF THE WHOLE POINT OF PLAYING TRAPPER IS BEING ABLE TO LOCK DOWN A SMALL AREA, BUT THE ISSUE COMES WHEN SURVIVORS GET COMMUNICATION. GO ON A CHASE FOR 20 SECONDS AT MOST? PREPARE TO HAVE ALL YOUR TRAPS DISABLED BECAUSE IT WAS A SWF. GOD PLAYING AGAINST THEM MAKES ME SO FUCKING SALTY AND I END UP TAKING IT OUT ON THE NEXT GAME SWF OR NOT BY BEING RIDICULOUSLY MEAN AND AGGRESSIVE.
---
I KNOW REDDIT PEOPLE CLAIM TO HAVE ONLY SEEN LIKE "ONE OR TWO TRYHARD SWFS" BUT I'M SORRY I'M NOT AS FUCKING LUCKY AS YOU ARE. NEARLY EVERY SWF I'VE GONE AGAINST IS EITHER EXTREMELY COORDINATED OR RIDICULOUSLY TOXIC.
---
GOD JUST LET ME BE COMPENSATED FOR GOING AGAINST AN OBVIOUSLY UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.
---
Mhm ❤
---
I would recommend Adam, all his perks are at the very least decent for one reason or another.
---
You keep thinking that. That's 3 survivors off of gens in my game. No one is hung to slug you and just stand there. 
---
That's the point, it's an anti-tunneling perk now, instead of just a free escape.
---
And then afk and go eat some food while the other 3 survivors are waiting at the exit to butt dance.
---
Love it! Nice job😊
---
If I'm correct, someone has done the research and said most of the Entity's language is bogus, but has a little bit of something legitimate in there. 
---
Could be something like Dead Space where they've made their own language.
---
Survivors can’t  get rid of noed solo if the killer is good because they’ll 4K with their eyes closed while one person contributes nothing until they find 5 totems. Ruin isn’t even close to necessary until like rank 7. NOED is a crutch to get a free kill after you play shitty and get gen rushed with 0 kills 
---
Damn, I want them to at least give us something. Even an image like with what they did with the Clown would please me. 
---
They’re not “listening to killers” tho
---
They’re adjusting perks to promote healthier gameplay, DS is now going to be anti tunnel and NOED is anti genrush. They both are perks that have total counters so long as you play in a way that makes the game a little more fun for the other side.
---
But STBFL gets indirectly buffed, which is much better for Freddy than RM. 👌
---
I'm new, what is swf? I see it all the time
---
Legacy actually isn't that cool though it's only cool because it's exclusive I don't think it looks that cool also people that played in that era deserved it I had it but my account got reset those days were dark times. Perma sabo'd hooks, super speedy heals, instant bnp, infinities, and so forth long story short they earned that.
---
Because adrenaline can turn a 1-2k into a 0k and noed directly counters it
---
Lol what?? Deliverance is garbage and borrowed time makes it so that you will probably go down after the 60 second timer. The old DS is way better than this reworked one, theres no question about it. Even the stun time is shorter
---
Fuck that. I demand a greater speed boost. If I'm not constantly running into walls because I can barely control my speed it isn't nearly fast enough
---
Survive with friends 
---
DS CHANGE HAPPENED, HOW ABOUT NOED CHANGES?
---
We aren't planning to change NOED at the moment. We consider that NOED has multiple gameplay counters and is currently in a good place. We do not think of NOED as an equivalent to DS.
---
Fucking exactly, they completely ruin ds but buff noed to the point your an idiot for not bringing it. I honestly can't believe behaviour.
---
Ah ok. The guy that did it to me only did it for ~10 seconds so it didn’t bother me. 
---
And yet one is getting reworked while the other one isnt. 
---
I mean, at that point it was worth the perk, that's enough time to get over 1 gen done by the other 3 players, all for 1 hook.
---
Even if it works with rancor, by the time you have finished the mori animation, the gates sould be open. Unless you run remember me, but then you are contradicting the strong effect of rancor which is leaving the opsession for late game.
---
Once either reaching level 30, 35 or level 40 you can unlock that survivors teachable perk or you can buy it from the shrine of secrets which has 4 random perks in it each week. 
---
It is also a form of BM similar to tbagging, so that was probably it. Some people do just do it to mess around those, but I feel those are far and few in between. 
---
Sure, that works, then all the gens get done and the game is mostly over.  
---
  
---
BEST PERK EVER FOR SURVIVORS!
---
I’m pretty sure this is bannable. You need to report them in the endgame screen and then send in the report and evidence to the support page on deadbydaylight.com
---
I've never touched Bill and I haven't bought it from the shrine.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
this is why i run a shroud of separation as much as possible. To weed out the weak and the cowardly.
---
Wow nice
---
“I’d rather go against a trash killer that uses a crutch perk to maybe secure a kill than go against 3-4 survivors communicating with each other and using DS”.
---
Yeah no shit.
---
I did this with a wraith. I didn’t know it was a “thing” someone had to show lol
---
If you get facecamped and the rest of your team doesn't escape, they are bad.
---
Yeah, most of the time you had to be very tactical on how you would level up through P1 and P2 and trying to get the entity to eat half of your bloodweb Dx Leveling up back then was awful
---
2k go nowhere when the devs had said 2k is a win. Hmmm
---
And DS is for shit survivors.
---
I mean, I don't agree with this at all but are you trying to get crucified alive here...? lol
---
Was this some kinda troll post?
---
Couldnt record it :/
---
Dumb question: you are on PC, right? 
---
You know the game is totally survivor sided if the survivors work together with voice chat right?
---
No. The skill check procs on pick-up. So the Survivor will DS out instantly, no time for the Killer to do anything.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/48381/decisive-strike-upcoming-changes
---
Something like this would also be helpful.  Not hard to balance the game... The devs just don't see the point.  But they also aren't looking at the data: look at the median number of hours played vs the mean and you'll see how unfriendly the game is to noobs.
---
Yup yup, I've run across groups where everyone was running it and borrowed time-&gt; which makes sense to buddy those up in case you do unhook in radius 
---
Except if a killer is worth their salt you should be glad you even got to end game and more than one got out.
---
"they need to have a perk that enables cheat codes to barely secure a kill" That right there tells me your entire argument is laughable. Cheat codes, lmfao.
---
No. It means everyone's DS is the same, they all work the same, and each time it's used the Obsession changes.
---
Ok well if the killer is good then yah? I get having bad teammates is frustrating but if the killer is better than y’all as a whole no dice he’s gonna win.
---
Don't forget the pallet vacuum that pulled survivors 8 meters across the pallet area, and not being able to kick gens. 
---
Always the megs and Claudettes. Source: am cuntdette main
---
NOED already sucks, it doesn't need changed.
---
Survivor mains:"Tunnelling is a big problem and needs to be addressed."  
---
*Devs change a perk to not only punish tunnelling, but also mindgames every killer to not tunnel.*  
---
Survivor mains: "OMG that perk is useless!"  
---
Like the idiot complaining about BBQ, they are too dumb to realize it's an anti-camping perk right?
---
Dbds community is a toxic mess of killers who passively aggressively hate survivors and survivors who passive aggressively hate killers 
---
no I’m just an FPS slut so I play on low or medium
---
I guess I must have missed that option I'll double check.  Thank you again 
---
My bets are on the salty people got downvoted into the void
---
I think I heard tru3 talk about a new endgame instead of Hatch the survivors aura gets shown to the killer like Freddy and the survivor has to run the killer around for a set amount of time depending on how many gens are done and then the exit gates opening so if you become last survivor it's an intense 1 on 1 with the killer always knowing where you are instead of the boring sneaky shit the hatch makes people do
---
My Dwight is P3 with some old brown and yellow map offerings.
---
I started a month before Huntress came out. 
---
Orr you coyld literally sctoll down like 2 lines and see more information. But whatever bub
---
That’s one way to punish a killer. Lol. But considering this “nerf”, good killers won’t fall for it. 
---
But new killers... RIP
---
When I was leveling Ace and I had no better perks I ran it with Deliverence and borrowed time, better chance for a safe unhook
---
Hahah that would be fucking amazing 
---
You realize the fact that NOED is in the game buffs good killers who dont need the buff more so than the garbage ones that actually do run NOED? 
---
Maybe make the dull totems actually make an effect on the game rather than have them tied to a sumb crutch perk bad killers slap on to feel good about themselves. 
---
I suggest that dull totems have a “Remember Me” effect. For every dull totem still active, the gates open X seconds slower. Now survivors actually have a secondary objective that slows them down if they dont do it, but also slows down their early game where most pallets are up. NOED doesnt deserve to be in the game.
---
Pharmacy and Diversion.
---
In hindsight I should have clarified. :P
---
You know it!
---
Never stops being funny 
---
Except you need to be good and be able to run the killer to make use out of the perk. Unlike NOED.
---
NOED exists because when the exit gates are open the probability of landing two hits is much lower. 
---
Can someone eli5 why this change is so big? So what, I’m the obsession. 9 times out of 10 I already am when using DS
---
Neither. Things I don't have an issue with can be issues in the community I'm a part of.   
---
I personally  don't think either of DS or NOED were or are particularly overpowered (or, in my experience, pervasive), but both are perks that have divided an already-caustic player-base and it makes sense to try and change that dynamic by making these pervasive perks more situational. I think the DS fix is probably good -- it will steer players who thought it was very good away from it and likely lead those players to player Survivor better overall, and it will also *increase* the perk's situational power because killers will expect it less and less. But the dirty secret is that DS is basically a waste of a perk slot in the vast majority of situations, and probably would be at the highest levels even if you truly run at 100% on the skill check.   
---
The same isn't actually true of NOED -- it's obviously a powerful endgame perk, to the point where it's seen as cheesy on certain killers due to their overall power. But the longterm frustration of playing against NOED is that countering it requires either the time to go find all the Totems or your teammates to reliably be doing the same. It's a perk that disproportionately punishes players in a game where rank is meaningless, and, well.   
---
There are a lot of people relieved about the DS tweak already on the killer side, and the counterplay there was just waiting a couple of seconds and learning to chase more effectively. I think we could create a lot of additional goodwill -- and, gradually, a lot of better players -- by slightly tweaking NOED, too.
---
Honestly I'm tired of the timer being brought up. We all damn well know it's going to work like pigs RBT where if they stick it on and leave you on the ground/hook/tunnel you it wont start losing time. So can we drop the time arguement and bring something to the table that's actually worth discussing 
---
In my opinion the only problem with noed is the extra movement speed 
---
Except if you’re good enough to run a tunneling killer for more than 60 seconds (which isnt very hard especially when factoring their skill and exhaustion perks) then the perk doesnt even activate. Its only use is when you get farmed, even then it doesnt get you far and you just get farmed again.
---
I had a few games in a row where I brought ultra rare addons as killers and it ended up 3 man where I couldn’t “play a normal game”
---
then it should still be 4 seconds.
---
Eh?
---
The perk only goes up while you are in the terror radius and you will hear the heartbeat while in range. If the bar is moving and you don't hear anything, then the you are on the absolute edge of the range and the heartbeat is just very quiet. 
---
Unless this is some rare bug on console or something, I've noticed terror radius perks stop working once the Wraith cloaks or pig crouches. 
---
You can see his addons 🤦‍♂️ there's always that one guy.. PlAy A rEaL kIlLeR 
---
it should still be 4 seconds
---
I don't think there are any updates on the new killer. And baby face looks like he would fit in very well. Idk what his power would be. What does he have in the movie?
---
Holy shit rancor is gonna be fucking dope now 
---
Don’t get me wrong STBFL is good but may I ask why it’s better on him than remember me? I mean I’m the total other way, I’d hardly run RM normally unless I’m running NOED but Freddy is the one killer that I sometimes run RM with no perk synergy because if they’re asleep it’s gonna take them 80/90/100 seconds to open the gate assuming you have 4/5/6 stacks. 
---
That’s equivalent to or longer than doing a gen solo, so I’d personally say RM is one of the perks that he benefits the most from, even more than STBFL.
---
Ok. Google translate says "Telugu Detected." So there must be some real language in it.
---
So we should nerf something for people who are bad because good people might also be affected? Well then we have to nerf something for solo queue because swf might benefit from it.
---
i think dying light should trigger once per match once the first obsession dies, then nothing different after that
---
That makes sense, honestly dont see why people who aren't trying to get BP dont use these if they prefer survivor 
---
Using NOED doesn't always mean the killer is outright bad at the game. So, survivors aren't trash for using a crutch but killers are? What point are you trying to make?
---
What does BM mean in this context?
---
By your logic, a survivor worth their salt wouldn't think to use DS. Why do they need an extra chance to get away if they're that good?
---
It's supposed to punish tunneling, not be a free escape.  
---
If you get tunneled off a hook, you get a chance at escaping. Add in BT and you will waste a ton of killer time, making the tunneling not worth it, making it a deterrent.  
---
And if you read the post by the devs, they said that they will adjust the stun time in the PTB if needed.  
---
Also, they said this:  DS CHANGE HAPPENED, HOW ABOUT NOED CHANGES?
---
It’s okay we won’t have to deal with him much longer. Now that DS is gone these brainless players will flock to a new game.
---
I like.
---
Omg... how has this game lasted so long? We’ll make it use to work on self care? 
---
Wait, is this actually an image from the show?
---
But wasting time early on slows gen progress and could end up getting early deaths. Then theres 1 less person to open the doors. People would just ignore totems because there would be no point in doing them. Losing time to gain time is pointless. 
---
The entire game was pretty awful back then.
---
EVERY loop had at least two pallets, infinite loops were basically everywhere, hooks didn't respawn after being sabotaged, Ivory and Ebony Moris could be used the moment you downed someone, BNPs completed generators, there were like 500 crows every 5 feet (which made lag and latency issues the norm), and level 30+ bloodwebs took 4 games to complete.
---
There's a reason everyone who played a lot during that sucky time got rewarded with Legacy outfits.
---
myers definitely ! i might be biased though bc i love him, but he’s really fun to play and with all the cool add-ons he has, it makes for a good game. besides, jump scare myers is best myers.
---
I'm getting downvoted for quoting the devs LMAO
---
Your approval is noticed. 
---
LOL, no outright saying so, but they came with downvotes
---
I've actually never used Spirit Fury. Probably because I only have it on Spirit.
---
Who's that cute Jeff?
---
Nah, survivors just want a change to stuff they don't like (tunneling) without having to give up any of their strengths (old DS). That's not how balancing in games work.
---
I mostly play survivor and I don't think I ever saw someone get all the totems in a match except me. It would be easy to get rid of totems if people actually tried to get the totems. There are so many times when I get tunnelled to death and I can't get rhe totems.  When I say that we should get the totems in chat, people just laugh and don't really care. Even a totem counter would be great against NOED.
---
Yeah I read that, I just think it will be more blanched that way. BTW it can be used however you see fit, free escape, tunnel punish, whatever. NOED is just a crutch for shitty killers tbh. At least once DS is used it's gone Noed however doesn't share the same punishment, it should have a timer or certain obligation to be met before use to be balanced. Imo of course.
---
I dont think you understand what a hyperbole is. Its to poke fun at how ridiculous the effect NOED gives a killer that played poorly. It doesnt show anything about the rest of my post because the rest of my post is about offering an alternative to NOED that is always active in every match, an alternative that will actually make survivors want to do the secondary objective (unlike NOED does) while also removing a toxic perk that shouldnt be in the game. Maybe actually read for once instead of cherry pickinng a sentence (and completely missing the point of that sentence) and then instantly downvoting the person you are replying to thinking that makes them “wrong” and makes you “right”.
---
&gt;God forbid you have to cleanse a few totems. 
---
Yes, with the change I suggested survivors will actually have to cleanse totems in every match to prevent an effect that is always active, not only when a killer is awful enough that you think that NOED might actually be a perk they consider worth running. And the killers who run NOED have an extra perk slot at their disposal to help them actually get better at the game instead of relying on the game enabling god mode when they play poorly
---
Got a real laugh out of this. I finally broke down and bought him. Completely stopped spending BP on him after the teachable. Forever lvl 36
---
The people that do cosmetics don't work on game mechanics. Those things happen independently from each other
---
At least the devs are competent in that regard
---
\-150% progression to all action speeds for the last Survivor. That'll show 'em.
---
Except a survivor worth their salt would want to run DS because they are confident in their ability to continue to run the killer for even longer, using less resources than if someone else got chased by the killer. A bad survivor that throws down 3 pallets immediately then goes down, uses DS and immediately runs to the next 3 pallets and throws them down didnt have good usage of DS. Actually, them using DS made it worse for their survivors because they have less resources to work with now
---
Plenty of games are balanced around voice comm, lol are you fucking dense?? 
---
Ik it’s a joke but he barely has been using ds lately
---
But the option is there, you can take it if you can and want, you just don't want to, or can't.  
---
Also I don't think taking people hostage is how friends are made, but I'm not good at making friends, so I may be wrong...
---
So what exactly are you upset about? 
---
I find pig to be a very fun killer to face (if they don't use their ability to camp). Getting a ticking rbt off your head with not a lot of time left is really exciting. 
---
Dude what are you talking about???? One guy is on the ground slugged, one guy is in a chase, one guy is saving the slug, that is THREE people off of gens for a little while. I have much more experience and I can tell you that you do not sit near someone slugged because they're going to get picked up. OFC they're going to be picked up. The point is not to stop them from getting up it is too waste one of their teammates time to go pick them up. You obviously do not understand this game as much as you try to seem and I'm not trying to be rude. 
---
literally who said i was upset about anything? all im saying is that it’s not really making that big of a change to decisive. &amp; i feel more people will begin to use decisive. wtf? 🤣
---
Is season 3 out? I don't recall this scene.
---
I'm only 27! 
---
This is a good idea (to improve BP overall) but won't be implemented unless you like long, long waits in lobbies. Killers wouldn't get played enough without those incentives, which is why it's balanced as it currently is, and killers always have to play the full game (they can't play half a game and get killed). Still, I approve of any change that encourages keeping the team alive more, punishing d-bags who make troll plays. Not the ones who do it on accident like me-- the people who really go out of their way to fuck up their team.
---
It works even better when you combine it with Spirit Fury (since they work sooo well together), but the idea is that when you're looping behind the survivor, if they stop at the pallet or you think you're close you can swing and try to get the hit, which sometimes works. This is an even better strategy with Enduring because you're barely stunned at all afterwards so you can just break the pallet and move on. Not to mention Enduring lowers the stun duration from Decisive Strike as well
---
So it’s like solo borrowed time-ish?
---
Mix that with the old Mori and it was a truly dark time.
---
&amp; the reason why i feel like its not that big of a change is because of my previous and first statement is that i think more people will begin to run ds. 
---
I mean, those are bad survivors you should be winning against anyways lol. If they do that you'll have every pallet on the map down within a couple minutes
---
It seems like everybody that plays meg is as simple as she looks
---
I'll agree with the hatch, you should have to run something to have the availability for it. But at the same time just down the last 2 towards the end then hook or let bleed out, solved. You should be focusing on the doors and evading the killer after the gens are done and not dealing with some nonsense punishment after you've accomplished the main premise of the game. As a killer you can camp then get rewarded with NOED at the end of a match, which is why %90 of killers use that strategy. We could argue about it all night. Tomatoes, potatoes. Gotta sleep, good discussion bud. We will just have to deal with it and see how it evolves.
---
Ok here's an idea to need NOED.
---
The survivors get a visual notification of the totems location.
---
Thoughts? 
---
I don’t even see that as a bad thing, really. I think people really overestimate how good the average player is in this game and their ability to run tiles effectively. Honestly I hope more people start running this new DS because they’ll be wasting perk slots on a second chance only to get downed immediately again. 
---
Big mood. 
---
Myers, no question. Pig is still fun though and has better teachables.
---
Blood on your face is bugged for me :(
---
Oh, I might actually return to DbD again soon.
---
Against a competent killer it is borderline impossible for 1 survivor to complete a generator. No matter how stealthy or smart a survivor plays they will eventually be caught unless the killer just gives up on patrolling.
---
I think what they’re getting at is they know they don’t need it, but they want it because since they are so good at running the killer around that the get out of jail free card wastes so much more of the killers time because they are good at running the killer around so that extra hit goes a long ways before they get hit again.
---
Bill main and I’m 18 rofl
---
Shouldn't getting a 4k be a maximum of 12 hooks, it would actually be a minimum of 4 hooks
---
I can imagine Dying Light will lead to a lot of timers being set for 60 seconds to avoid a new obsession.
---
Why are they balancing the perk around a skill check? It’s a crutch for actually good development 
---
Thanks for your response! Is the team considering doing anything new with prestige in the future, to incentivize players to go through with it? I have noticed in all the player studies the odds seem way too low to be reasonable, but I also understand how terrifying games with reds can be.
---
Are you talking about me? I haven't downvoted you at all.
---
i don’t think people overestimate the average player because at medium-higher ranks there are a lot of good players, let alone a lot of swf. i still think even if more people do begin to run ds with the new change, it will take up a perk slot as a “useless” perk as it always has but it’s still going to have the same effect, just later on in the game and a shorter stun. killers facing a swf with a lower rank in the swf most likely won’t know how to counter ds and most likely still end up getting “bullied” etc.. and most lower rank killers dont run enduring unless they have intentionally deranked. 
---
No tf it isn't. It's great design to have counters to other perks. How about not using a perk that can be countered? It's a layer of strategy which is very good for the game. Don't use ds and you don't have to worry about enduring. You wouldn't need ds if you learned how to loop anyways
---
Yeah, more than they already are. 
---
You're right, fixed.
---
You 100 percent would not pip by doing that
---
If you actually think that you have never played killer because that is not how rank progress works on killer **at all**
---
Lol never played that game but man I’ve heard some horror story’s from people about that game!
---
True! I guess only the clown addon would counter that but that’s very situational.
---
Now to get rid of NOED.
---
I bet you think so baby surv. It takes 2 and a half mins max, if even that, to find the totems with small game by yourself. You guys whine so much about a Perk you didn't need to be using anyways
---
If 1K is going to downpip you then a lot of mechanics would have to be changed. Like, keys would have to be taken out
---
Wow I'm really sad about the Object Of Obsession change. 
---
NOED's a pain in the ass for survivors (though they need more of those honestly) and barely helps. Try running it at Rank 1--it's never going to activate. 
---
Besides... Professionals have *standards*.

blah blah blah Nea’s a killer, blah blah blah, whoever designed her arm with the band designed it the same as a coat, blah blah blah thought this wasn’t that diffy blah blah blah it’s like The Thing blah blah blah please hava good one.
---
yeah
---
But, totems are also an objective. Not the main one, sure, but an objective nonetheless. I do think they should somehow signify how many totems have been cleansed.
---
How to spot a noob
---
I actually love your idea for Left Behind. I get how the perk is currently a direct reference to L4D, but it's also hardly useful. 
---
The devs say a lot of shit, doesn't mean they're right.
---
NOED was a band-aid attempt to balance out the early days of gen rushing, but then they nerfed it to being a hex perk, and then they buffed it to being worth using at all levels, so now they need to nerf it by making it the rarest perk to get in the webs.
---
Yeah, but let's be honest. The perk being taken away somehow makes it better. 
---
Close that damn hatch if they're the last one alive. If you find it first they hardly deserve it.
---
You must have missed the first part of my reply here let me point it out for you "i don't give a fuck how strong the original was."
---
It was the longest process. I had to separate the yarn (it was 4 strands wrapped together) and loop each strand around a long piece. Then I had to comb it out. After I sewed it to the cap I made, I used my hair straightener on it! It’s so freaking soft, I’m really amazed. It was my first time doing it. 
---
Dont only blame the killer. Blame your teammates for not devising some kind of plan to get you off. Even when i play with randoms, I’ll let myself get caught so someone else can get the survivor on the hook because he’s at a greater risk of getting sacrificed than I am. They do that, fix gens here and there, and then come back and do the same for me.
---
My husband said I can’t keep him, he said it was too creepy!
---
It punishes survivors for not cleansing totems, don't act like there's nothing you can do to counter it.

---
My god, how did people play this?!
---
You're right, I worded that wrong. But you get what I'm saying. 
---
Only one obsession per match rule still applies. It just changes who you can kill based on who used DS the last time around. 
---
"bUt it OnLY eFfEctS caMpeRs Or TunNeleRS" I swear half the community has never played killer, if you as the killer can effectly predict when an unhook is about to happen or see the notification and go over there, you shouldnt be punished, neither should hookrushing be rewarded, survivors will literally run half way across the map to a hook if you're chasing them and unhook someone in your face.
---
you what?
---
The post sounds like you are calling No0b3 out for relying on DS. 
---
So pretty much exactly what i just said. Destroy all the totems.
---
&gt;on top of that I shouldn't have to invest time into a "mabye"
---
Welcome to Dead by Daylight, where a huge part of this game is risk and "maybes". 
---
Not if you’re the Michael...
---
This is only a problem if killers tunnel. You don't tunnel, this problem doesn't exist for you.
---
I don't know, i always found the idea of object kinda flawed. You can see them and they can see you. But it seems the game struggles with pin pointing exactly where you're looking at as I've has moments where I'm looking purposely away from anywhere the killer could be, just to have object glow up like hey, they can see you now. 
---
I get that being able to always see the killer is powerful. But I find the perk falls into the no mither category of placing a target on your back. 
---
lets get this straight, it is optimal NOW, but with this new DS, it wont be optimal anymore, but the way you have to play because of the change is weaker overall, its a buff to survivors and it DOES effect stbfl players
---
you heard me boi
---
then the last surv is hiding somewhere self caring while having the mangled effect + Coulrophobia and distressing. 
---
pips and points are not true win conditions, just stop
---
They should increase the timer atleast to 1 min and 15 seconds max, 60 seconds is not good enough tbh. This makes ds so conditional, even i dont use ds, but this makes it superhard to use. A 1 min,15 seconds seems good enough for max tier, 60 for 2nd, 45 for first. That should be the timer. Besides the killer can still burn it easily, and it trigfers on second hook not first hook.
---
I’d rather have this than wait half an hour for a game... smh you people complain about everything
---
LoL has some of the worst balance in any game lol. There’s permanently 4-5 must ban champs in high elo and one role is constantly useless. 
---
It is optimal. You've always had to not tunnel with STBFL. This new change doesn't do shit to STBFL players but ensure that, with the way they've always been playing, they never have to see DS ever again. 
---
And then some would lose said legacy outfits in a random profile deletion bug that always keeps coming back.
---
Game went from pretty awful to awful.
---
its their fault for playing optimally\* optimal strategies are being nerfed, this is a huge buff to survivors in general. 
---
what's the context for the original image?
---
Somebody being good at the game doesn't mean they'll make a good game.  
---
Possibly; it's unclear if this is an official change that will happen outside of the PTB.
---
Cool. &lt;3
---
That’s why I picked her, she has such a fun mechanic!
---
no you haven't, that's not how "stbfl players" play to play optimally? did you get this from the stbfl council or something? optimal tunneling with stbfl is still better than chasing two stacks rn. you only refuse to tunnel because you think its more "honorable", admit it, its not about being optimal.
---
Enjoyed this. Still want an ' I'm Gay, ' one.
---
Exactly this, the anti tunnel is nice but I've needwd something to combat sand bagging for the longest time
---
Recently unhooked Survivors are extremely easy to find, even if the Killer isn't tunneling. They're more likely to run from the hook, thus more likely to leave scratches. They leave a blood trail that can be very easy to follow, especially with certain builds. They're louder, making them easier  to detect, especially with Stridor. They can be found by Nurse's when trying to heal after being saved. 
---
The nerfs are minor, completely overcome by the buffs. The end result is an objectively more powerful DS.
---
Nah, your assumption's wrong, buddy. It is common sense, lmfao. It has nothing to do with me being one person. Wanna get the most stacks the fastest way possible? Don't tunnel. End of story. Nobody said anything about multiple killers, either.
---
Oh I dunno. Either way it's not true now, so what bearing does it have on the game?
---
Personally, I think BBQ &amp; Chili is more toxic than NOED.
---
Why wouldn’t you camp when the gates are open what else is the killer suppose to do they can’t get everyone at once unless the survivors are bad
---
Again, that's only if the killer decides to tunnel you. You're also completely ignoring all the times the killer's either chasing someone else when you get hooked, comes back to the hook and chases the unhooker, etc. etc. Don't bring up a few scenarios and pretend the opposite doesn't happen.
---
Maybe you play way more than me dude but i have like.. 3 killers perks all unlocked. I want more. So i play for points. I wanna unlock bbq next, then ruin. Then i can get more perks easier, as well as those that come out in the future. You play your way I'll play mine, I just take solace in the fact that I'm not making newer survs that end up in my lobby not wanna play the game.
---
Doing dull totems is the most boring aspect in the game and having to do that in every game just to be sure that the killer doesnt use noed is a pain in the ass. Especially when you dont do totems and you only realise that the killer has noed after he already one hit a survivor and theb you have to search the entire map for one totem because its really easy to counter.
---
Lmao. Can you imagine calling a person a coward over the internet?
---
killing survivors &gt; getting stacks  
---
If you never played optimally yeah sure the new DS wont effect you sure
---
9/10 if I go back to a hook after a save, typically because I've got MYC and want to make use of it, the person I find is the one who was just on the hook, not the rescuer. The unhooked person is considerably easier to locate, being more likely to be running, to be the one leaving a blood trail, to be healing to proc Nurse's, or just to be more audible in their breathing. A Killer doesn't remotely have to be tunneling to end up chasing an unhooked Survivor within 60 seconds of the rescue.
---
If you think tunneling is you playing optimally, *especially* with STBFL on, you're just bad. I'm not gonna respond to your bullshit anymore.
---
Dont even do that, just have premonition and UE equipped so you know when to hide when the killer starts getting close to the exit gate you’re opening.
---
Ironic.
---
Fine then, your experience and knowledge of moba is worthless when it comes to this particular situation and game. Ever wonder why both survivors and killers run so any of the same perks? its because at least 80% of the perks are either terrible or way too situational to be of any use.
---
Why would a survivor choose no mither over self-care? or urban evasion?
---
Why would a killer choose monstrous shrine over monitor &amp; abuse? or discordance?
---
The point I'm trying to make is the fact you seem to be enjoying that the "meta" is getting changed when it's one again only the survivors getting changed and/or nerfed and not the killers.
---
We were having a half-decent conservation until you decided to get defensive and started acting rude.
---
Newsflash!!! 
---
*Just because you like this change does not mean everyone else does .
---
*I would love if this game did not have a meta and actually buffed all perks accordingly. Would love to see no mither, dejavu, hangman's trick and territorial imperative used more often.
---
This conversation is over, Tried to be decent but I can tell from your post you just want to be angry. Thank you for your time and have a wonderful day.
---
Of course, crochet is alien to anyone who doesn’t know. [This should help](http://sols-crew.tumblr.com/post/43975156663/tutorial-making-a-brushed-yarn-wig) , it has step by step pictures. The only thing different is I sewed it all around before straightening it. 
---
And thanks so much! That really does mean a lot to me! I always try to make things as nice as I can, we are our own worst critic. 
---
Are there any funny salt messages 
---
(All though not always effective and accessible, just like it’s not always effective to cleanse all 5 totems without being in SFW) 
---
Dribbling is a counter to DS. Like I said, it’s not always going to be effective but with the hook distance rework it seems to be a lot more manageable. While yes, NOED does have counter-play with cleansing totems, it’s extremely hard to keep track of the amount done if you’re not running a SWF group. 
---
Both perks have counter plays to them if you have the right circumstances. DS being near a hook and NOED being that you’re able to find all the totems. I feel like both perks can be argued to be “crutch” perks. 
---
You bringing up a few scenarios and pretending the opposite doesn't happen? Yeah, it is.
---
This. 
---
Downvotes are salty killers who can’t face the facts. 
---
Cleanse the fucking totems, mate.

Hope is such an underrated perk

---
That's the whole risk of survivor, though. 
---
I was gonna say isn’t this just wannabe borrowed time 
---
What is the change pls? 
---
Idk what the fuss is all about DS. It was fine to begin with. I still encounter and watch some YouTubers who kill the quad even when 2-4 of them have DS.
---
Nah, that's what we are for.
---
Yup. I tried recently had a dude being a complete dick and when I called him out he said he was just trying to practice 360s. Whenever I'd leave him he'd just walk right behind me and tea bag. He apologized but then told me to "step away and breath" like I was raging (i wasnt) which then made me want to rage.
---
Wait so when survivors have a toxic OP perk it makes us toxic assholes but when killers have a toxic OP perk its just a survivor risk?
---
Okay. Sure. 
---
Nah, that's not it at all. People assume that NOED is only used by "bad" killers because they're salty they died to it, rather than thinking of it the other way around and saying that NOED only kills "bad" survivors who didn't cleanse all the totems. Inb4 "I gotta serch 4 all da totuhms"; yeah, you gotta make that decision as a survivor. Speed through gens and risk faceplanting into NOED, or take the time to search out all five totems and cleanse them. Killers and their perks are supposed to be stronger than survivors. This game is asymmetrical, after all. 
---
So, I have noticed the chainsaw sound not looping correctly. The initial rev up makes noise, but it goes silent during the looping phase. 
---
As for no terror radius? I have not yet noticed that for him or any other killer. Must be rare
---
Thank you for the link! It does make a lot more sense to me now.
---
And of course! I know how easy it can be to over-critique ourselves. :p 
---
Just rest assured that you did really well with this.
---
Rip to your game. What type of people are you listening to? Jesus fucking Christ man. There's no such thing as 5 man DS using teams. On the off chance it happens, killers dribble the obsession anyways. When they grab someone who isn't the obsession, the hook placement on the map is so disgustingly close and the amount of hooks on the map are so obscene to begin with the only way you're going to get hit with DS from the non obsession is if you want to get greedy and take them to the basement. At which point you're wasting more of your own time as the killer. 
---
So about noed, you gonna do something about that? You made an OP perk that was niche into an every day part of the majority of killers' loadouts. These same crybaby ass killers say to just do totems waaaaah. Which wastes time for survivors just the same as DS wasted the killers time. It's risk/reward and you're taking all the reward of playing survivor away. 
---
What about punishing camping killers harder? It Isn't fun for anyone to still ve facecamped because the point loss for killers that do is so miniscule as it is.
---
"We did a pretty good job so far" of killing your game. No survivors means no games and a lot of people who do use DS was fun and rewarding to use. You've basically made it a worse borrowed time now. You need to make the game fun for everyone and not just about low skilled baby killers' hyperbole over a perk that you either hit and it was gone for the entire match or you missed and it was, wait for it............... Still gone for the entire match or you get dribbled to the hook that's a whopping 10 fucking feet apart from each other. It doesn't take that long. Or you could just slug them.
---
Your so out of touch with your own game It's disgusting.
---
If they're not equivalent, why are we talking about NOED at all? The sentence "If you're gonna nerf DS then also nerf NOED" implies equivalence, and its a false one in my opinion.
---
I'd be all for a nerf or a rework of NOED, if we can get a change to Adrenaline as well at the same time. Those two perks are far too tied together. Killers don't run NOED to counter DS, they run NOED to counter Adrenaline.
---
And even then, only one of the three perks as it is right now, is entirely possible to disable. No way to disable DS or Adrenaline, but if the group of survivors are doing their job, NOED doesn't even go off half the time at the higher ranks. 
---
People cleanse totems at higher ranks. They're pretty good at it.
---
I missed the skill check quite often. 
---
Best part was she left a no mither on the ground to come to the totem
---
I've seen this too many times as killer where people want to save someone on the hook, but they don't wait for me to leave the hook. And then chase me around RIGHT NEXT TO THE HOOKED PERSON.
---
I want to bop you someplace else and let the hooked person go at the very least to pass by other generators and scare people off. Please do the right thing and let me do that so I don't feel bad about you ruining any chance of survival for the person I just hooked :(
---
Then after I down that silly survivor, other survivors try to body block me 5 feet from the hook instead of saving that *one survivor almost in the struggle phase*. With no one on a generator. 
---
I missed the check quite often.
---
I take out every dull I see randoms don't.  I shouldn't have to take out 5 totems myself every game to avoid baby crutch instadown.  And yes I am telling you that as a killer if you need to rely on a gimme instadown when you played inefficient and shitty and gave up all the objectives that you are a bad killer.  Playing without NOED forces you to play more optimally and make  better decisions during chases and applying map pressure.  A lot of killers don't bother tightening up their game and simply rely on mindless instadowns instead.  
---
I went off the basis that it would act like RBT where you didnt have a timer decrease if you got tunneled or downed, now I feel it may be a bit too far
---
True I honestly forgot to add that part--
---
Thank you. I probably could have clarified that a little better. :p
---
It's a Valentine's day special that came out last week.
---
Complains about get out of jail free card. Vociferously defends NOED (probably). Narrowly avoids irony whooshing overhead.
---
Then maybe those randoms need to get better, instead of the perk being changed? And I'm gonna say it again: "People assume that NOED is only used by "bad" killers because they're salty they died to it, rather than thinking of it the other way around and saying that NOED only kills "bad" survivors who didn't cleanse all the totems." It goes both ways.
---
Okay so lets do some math here okay? Each totem takes 14 seconds to cleanse, with no Thrill. 5 totems spawn on the map. 5x14= 70 seconds, for all totems if you do them one by one. A generator takes 80 seconds to do. So its basically doing another gen, this also doesn't include the time it takes to find the totems in the first place. So it takes LONGER than a gen to "sweep the entire map".

---
Dont even try to argue with the guy. Hes just gonna downvote you and claim that survivors are toxic and that noed is not OP because "ez 5 totems".
---
I've always known that shit was fucking worthless.
---
"What does it do?"
---
"It slightly increases your chance of getting ultra rare items."
---
"Don't you have 100 of everything already and all the perks?"
---
"Yes, but it also gives you bloody cosmetics."
---
"Ooh, so I get to spatter blood all over my favorite stealth gear?"
---
"Um, no, it's the default clothes, and for killer you get bloody weapons!" \*presents the shitty excuse of a "bloody" prestige weapon\*
---
"Get that stupid shit out of my face, fuck your prestige levels, I'm keeping my shit!"
---
Lmao! Me too. I troll the basement and saw them on the hooks. Great fun man
---
If you can 100% nail a great skill check every single time while the screen is bouncing, you've played a hell of a lot more of this game than I have. NOED required zero skill to activate.
---
I remember the killer *was* a pig, and  she was almost right next to me. Hmmm...
---
It hapoened to me with freddy just today, didn't hear the lullaby until I was lut in dream
---
So surv are salty noobs when they get hit by noed but killers who get hit by ds are not salty noobs because you cant dribble? Im just trying to figure out your logic?
---
So I havent played in a while. And cool that DS is gone, but isnt noed still in...? And that somehow is okay?
---
I’ve landed more DS skill checks than I’ve gotten NOED kills. Survivors do totems all the time to the point it’s not even worth running. 
---
I need answers
---
Use Small Game and you'll never have to worry about NOED ever again.
---
Then why do you give a shit about noed if you dont use it?
---
"Oh no lets cleanse all the totems just to be assured that the baby killers doesnt get to use the most OP noob perk in the game that the devs are too ignorant of to nerf"
---
What kind of mindset is that? In what world is that fair?
---
Is that game sabotage?
---
I had this exact thing happen to me. I was laurie against trapper and even the same mask

It comes from a stream in which Demi used it against Rhyaree.

Dont act like theres no counters.
---
1 second immunity my ass - Huntress
---
As a killer main I never had a problem with DS, the only time I've ever actually gotten mad at DS is when 3-4 had it. Other than that I never cared. I think only bad killers sit here and complain about DS, if you're a good killer it doesn't matter unless they saved it for a good time. 
---
I can barely hit people 10 feet in front of me with her damn hatchets haha. I'm terrible with huntress
---
Autodidact is pretty shit tbh. 
---
Isn't that like saying wearing a life jacket is punishing you for not swimming? Why is NOED activating not considered the fuck up for survivors for not clearing totems?
---
i guess if you're into that sort of thing
---
Clown
---
Ohh I see thanks. 
---
Because I'm tired of people bitching about it because they don't understand how this game is set up? 
---
One that understands the game and doesn't want everything handed to me on a silver platter? It's literally fair, especially for a hex perk.
---
That is honestly my issue with the perk. It becomes mandatory every game to do the totems becuase most people run it and you have no communication if it is in the game until it is too late. Atleast DS would have someone be an obsession so the killer had an idea if it is in the game or not. In addition, it is very hard to counter unless you are SWF. You do not know how many totems everyone else has done. In games that the killer does not run the perk they gain the benefit of its existence because someone is likely to be totem searching, especially against the likely suspects like wraith.
---
Very much so but don't call him a thing
---
The "Anti-Tunneling and Anti-useless-teammates" build?
---
&gt;DS have counters too. Enduring, unnerving
---
Those are perks and thus use up a perk slot
---
&gt;dribling, slugging
---
Can both be countered by other survivors helping out
---
NOED has a counter (destroying all dull totems) that completely disables it (something DS does not have) and does not require the use of a specific perk. The counter itself can't reliably be counter-countered either (Hex:Thrill Of The Hunt being the closest thing, but again, that's a perk).
---
So I need to SWF and bring a perk to counter NOED while managing to do all 5 gens as well. Seems reasonable. Killers freak out when someone says dribble, slug or use enduring to counter DS yet list all of these insanely unreasonable counters in order to defend their NOED crutch.
---
Let’s get this to the front page
---
Noed doesn't need a Nerf and DS didn't need the Nerf, stop complaining and learn to play
---
Why did you make it like this
---
The counters to NOED do not require any perk slots being taken up. Simply cleanse totems, that’s literally it
---
That is exactly how it works. Read the perks description. I quote.
---
"Each time you hit your Obsession, you increase the opening time of the Exit Gates by 5 seconds up to a maximum of 20 additional/25 additional/30 additional seconds.
---
**The Obsession is not affected by Remember Me**"
---
Don’t play as Legion then
---
Oh it probably had it's moments. 
---
Chainsaw Myers, Nea with a Wailing Bell, Michael Myers joining the lobby as a Survivor (complete with Survivor perks like Bond or Empathy). 
---
There were tons of absolutely hilarious bugs, but it also made it hard for people to actually play the game. That combined with how frustrating of a grind progression was and how unfair matches could be to either side would probably keep it from being fun for an extended period of time.
---
^(It might be fun as an alternate mode; being able to Sabo every hook on the map because 4 gens got done in the first minute, until a pissed off Myers starts Mori'ing everyone after slugging them with a Chainsaw.)

---
Okay, killer downs the hooked guy and goes for the one unhooked. That's 60 seconds for the survivor to be picked up by another survivor or to crawl somewhere safe while the killer is gone. 
---
Citing Self Care as if that perk was balanced is silly, Self Care should definitely be on the radar for a potential rework. 
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Exactly!
---
Now, if only Borrowed Time could proc on Self Unhooks.
---
This literally happened two hours ago
---
Yeah because being slugged for a quarter of your bleed out timer screams fun for the playerbase and overall health of the game right.
---
Okay?
---
The dev addressed that. If the killet has dying light and someone uses DS after the obsession has died, the effect starts over and the new obsession has to die as well for the debuff to be reapplied. 
---
That DS change is also a nerf to Dying Light. 
---
If I have to guess, either Dying Light deactivates until the new obsession dies, or the DS won't mark you as the obsession. 
---
dying light deactivates when there's new obessesion and so it weakens dying light. 
---
Its not and it should be reworked. Im done arguing with you because obviously its pointless for both sides
---
Why would you unhook in front though :/
---
You’ve ignored the fact that survivors are working against time just as much as the killer is. That means there is a real tangible limit to how long you can spend looking for/ cleansing full totems without shooting yourself in the foot. 
---
who tf leaves when they hear a billy?
---
like...pls let me play against billy more often!😢
---
I think that'd be a bit too unfair on the poor killer :(
---
As a killer main DS was an issue. Even if it one time per game it promoted slugging and tunneling and was unfun for both side.
---
R/wooosh
---
You must be a bad killer
---
They said they don't consider it an equivalent and that they have no plan to change it at the time. 
---
As much as I hate NOED, you can just cleanse totems and prevent it from even taking effect. 
---
One of the main killer complaints is that gens are done too fast but with the possibility of NOED, survs also have an important secondary objective. 
---
I totally agree with you. But tbh your opinion has no meaning here. The sub is mostly a killer hive mind and it doesn’t matter what you say. 
---
So scott and zubat that complained about it on stream are too.
---
Bold statement dude.
---
It'll still be good on Infinite Tombstone Myers, since he doesn't actually have to injure anyone, but besides him it'll be worthless. 
---
Kind of like Play With Your Food actually.
---
Same thing happened to my friend today while we played. He said “lol I wanna go get a palette on him before I leave” and ended up dying to a 3 Myers
---
They'll only see the 1 totem lit up at a time because the chances of them spawning right next to each other is minuscule. So they'll greed it. People are very totem hungry.
---
changes are currently on the pbe... they make it easy to counter with adding little skulls on the map, you need tapping  them and noed is gone !
---
If the devs had any creativity they could rework noed into a much more interesting perk. I like the idea of them taking The Speed boost of Noed and all the increased action speed of fire up and combining them. Maybe the killer goes 7% faster and does all actions At double speed. More interesting than getting one hooked and abandoned by your team because the killer brought a crutch.
---
Honestly DS most bullshit and crutch thing I have seen developed so when it go nerfed my 3 eye awoke 
---
Ask Jeff 
---
What I wanna know is where’s the ruin totem
---
As they said, that counter only works if you're relatively close to a hook to begin with. 
---
If you down someone at the exit gate and they have DS, they're basically guaranteed to escape. 
---
Dude I remember those dark days. Sprint Burst is one of the most busted shit ever.
---
The problem with noed is that i can be doing just fine running the killer, getting a gen, and some dull totems, but when dipshit McGee over here can kill me because he’s terrible at the game and can only get kills because of noed it’s just discouraging to me. Same for DS. I can kick these guys asses as killer, get down to the last survivor, and the fucker has ds and we’re by the hatch. If this incompetent shit stain can hit an easy skill check, then I lose the kill because I did my job. So in my opinion and many others this crutch of a perk needs to be reworked or nerfed in some way, shape, or form. I shouldn’t be punished because bad players used a good perk to achieve their goals when I worked my ass off without using these crutches. If noed gets nerfed, you bet your ass you won’t see these terrible killers at rank 1.
---
NOED is a completely different breed of broken than DS. I think DS is more unhealthy for the game as a whole. There is more to say but I am far too tired to write out a lengthy speech about NOED versus DS. What I will say is that I am not defending NOED's existence, as I still think it's an extremely unfair and unbalanced perk that needs significant changes.
---
Will be honest: not my meme.
---
People: Michael Myers isn't cute.
---
*Sends them this masterpiece*
---
Me: Bet you feel stupid right now.
---
My feet hadn’t even hit the ground lmao
---
Killer mains dont understand the downsides of a survivor perk and only know that it hurts them, even if its less than a better perk would have
---
Survivor mains dont understand the downsides of a  killerperk  and only know that it hurts them, even if its less than a better perk would have
---
My boys game crashed from too many status effects
---
legion player still as toxic as legion mains
---
How in Davey Jones locker food you not get hit during that pallet slam.
---
Honestly, I'm expecting the Skyrim intro transition 
---
The jokes on them, I run Michael with Iron Maiden, NOED, Haunted Grounds, and MYC, and although my Tier 3 is gone they're still Exposed from all four of perks!
---
^(I'm not joking, I've actually done this to someone and it was the best thing ever.)
---
Put graphics to low to remove anti aliasing. AA is very intense and blurs details a lot in this game.
---
Also if you have an Nvidia card look up how to install Nvidia Freestyle, with that you can change shadows, contrast, gamma, vibrance, etc.
---
The setup I prefer is:
---
Contrast: +18
---
Shadows: -80
---
Highlights: -15
---
Gamma: +20
---
Vibrance: +30
---
But my monitor has 1000:1 contrast ratio, if yours is lower I would reduce gamma and increase shadows.
---
Lol I still main Meg (and Kate).
---
epic
---
Holy shit you are ignorant 
---
But I've heard that Freddy is literally the worst killer
---
Well to be honest in my case its more like sympathy for the person playing Killer because I know how painful it is sometimes at Rank 1
---
Awful change, solves nothing. Game is still trash with the hits through windows and pallets.
---
This rework is probably going to drastically increase the amount of people running DS. I always used it because I hate being tunneled, and since thats what they reworked it to do, A lot of people are going to be using it now.
---
Ok
---
Holding the game hostage. Bannable offense 
---
This one really hurts when you paid full price at launch. 
---
True, but, that's not too big a change, since most times, especially in higher ranks, their's usually someone who's ready to open the gate right as the last gen pops.
---
I personally would choose the Spirit just because I like her play style more
---
They're the two most unfair perks in the game, and NOED was recently buffed so all three tiers have one hit downs in a game meta that's already shifted balance to favor killers. They're not equivalent, but if they're going to rework/nerf DS because it rewards survivors for losing a chase, NOED should get the same treatment because it rewards killers for letting all 5 gens get finished.
---
It's a cheap trick, but it isn't holding the game hostage. The poor guy on hook is going to die eventually.
---
They're both high tier Killers in the meta rn and they're both crazy fun to play as IMO. 
---
The Shape is all about being sneaky and jumpscaring people until you've stalked them enough to either instantly down them or straight up murder them. He's easy to pick up but hard to master.
---
The Spirit is all about mindgames and mobility. You can jumpscare people like you can with Myers, but the way you do it is totally different. She's hard to pick up and decently difficult to master, but incredibly easy to play as once you've done so.
---
Personally, I'd pick Michael, but that's because I'm a fan of those old slasher films.
---
However, if you plan on playing other Killers besides Spirit or Michael; Spirit might be better because her perks (Spirit Fury, Haunted Grounds, and Rancor) are more useful than Myer's perks (Play With Your Food, Save The Best For Last, and Dying Light) are.
---
In the end it's up to you, but I hope I could help you make an informed decision.
---
2,000 hours in the game. This game is trash, and you know it. This change does nothing. 
---
“It smells tight, dawg”
---
Totems are not an objective. If each totem cleansed meant exit gates opened faster, then you could say its a side objective, but they literally contribute nothing to the state of the game UNLESS the killer is running a certain perk that you have literally no way to know about until it's too late.
---
I understanf your frustration. You should take a break until mqjor improvment then.
---
Got fixed.
---
They reworked noed. Now it works just as well at tier 1 so every killer can use it. Because outplaying the killer all game and getting one shotted and camped in the end game because the killer clicked on a perk is fun and interesting game play, right?
---
They should just remove the exits and hatches! Let them survivors claw their way out. Just make it that killers shoot lasers from their eyes and down survivors with one look. Why they gotta make it so hard for killers?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aqv12x/just_clean_totems_to_avoid_noed/eglkvue/?context=3
---
I post this everytime someone says just clean totems.
---
Switch botany for borrowed time
---
Maybe if you weren't playing sweater boi you wouldn't be so salty. New DS is a solid nerf unless you're camping and tunneling. Which, given your flair, I guess it is another buff, since that's all Freddy does.
---
The real shame is he can't 360 in Minecraft, what a scrub
---
So killer had to bring a perk, exploit pickup mechanic to reset DS proc ( and only able to do it with obsession you can't figure out if others have it and when to drop them to counter it) or slug and not do his objective to KILL survivors.
---
And you HAD to clear that one totem even before it proc in chance that you manage to fix all 5 generators it really it "the same" how delusional you people are...
---
he's just fucking around freddy and fire up are both ass
---
And carry a medkit to compensate
---
Really cool ideas!
---
Ace needs to be a skin tho. 
---
Some ideas- add Dead Hard as side-B, make the pallet drop the forward smash instead. Down B could work like Mewtwo's. Neutral B could also swap between survivor items, and Down B could use them. 
---
No idea what else I'd do for attacks though. Love the stage idea! Imagine having to dodge a hillbilly charging from offscreen or else you'd get KO'd!
---
No fucking clue
---
Jumping through the hatch takes slightly longer than it does for the Killer to wipe their weapon.
---
I was thinking that too until I rewatched it. Doesnt look like he swung or that clearly would have connected
---
And solo gen point gains are so weak ;_;
---
Nice
---
It'd probably be balanced even if it was regenerative in a chase. Burning 2 perk slots (3 with vigil) to be able to play with an already nerfed sprint burst is a high price to pay.
---
Mori just got x100 better...
---
This is actually amazing! For one, it punishes tunneling a fair bit, since there's a chance the unhooked survivor has DS active. For two, it makes perks like Dying Light better, since the target becomes injured and is therefore easier to kill. And finally, it actually makes the game feel fair for once!
---
I absolutely love it!
---
Usually when the Ranks are off by that, it usually means a SWF
---
Why am I getting matched with those levels when I’m not in a SWFs though?
---
She's as plain as the nose on Meg's face
---
or just cleanse totems?? 
---
You almost had me there for a second, and I damn near spit out my drink. Well played. 
---
I assume the other 3 are SWF. Which one was you?
---
#MOTHER OF GOD
---
Same as my username.
---
Rewatch it. It looks like he didnt swing or swung way too late. Otherwise, yes that would have connected.
---
Back in the old days when trapper could trap a hooked survivor and moris didn't require a hook before you got ganked. Infinites existed on every map and you could heal before the killer finished wiping his weapon.
---
We complain a lot, but the game has come a long way from the shit show it was at release.
---
The spirit is the third best killer in the game, depending on her add-ons she may even be second best.
---
She’s tough to master but once you have she’ll be almost as strong as the nurse.
---
Myers for me gets repetitive and boring really fast, not to mention he’s much weaker at higher ranks. I only use him for his fun add-ons but other than that he gets boring quickly. Just my opinion, some people like him a lot.
---
I mean nothing wrong with doing both
---
Tunneling is limiting yourself from ever getting better at this game and is by no means optimal.
---
Putting out map pressure by hunting different survivors is what I call optimal as I exactly know what the injured person is doing (healing). 
---
NOED deadass needs removing from the game. If this idea angers you, you're not a good Killer and are too reliant on that PoS perk.
---
BBQ's aura reading has a whole bunch of counters: Be in the Killer's terror radius, hide in a locker, hide behind a gen, Distortion, head one way for a few seconds before changing direction, etc.
---
"Michael's Funballs"
---
True. Let‘s see how long it takes to see the first clip where exactly that happens xD
---
Just means 'short sighted', it's a word I myself use often. Not because I wish to sound smart, it's just easier to type 'myopic' rather than 'short-sighted'.
---
Then you you probably matched with the Rank 14, who brought his 2 SWF. Either way, unfortunately 
---
Alright thay makes sense. 
---
Except the two changes that have already occurred with NOED? 
---
It used to be a permanent buff when all the generators were powered - everyone agrees that was broken.
---
Then it was a buff for 90-120 seconds (can’t quite remember the exact timing) - Killer’s complained as Survivors would all just go hide behind trees in random corners of the map for the time limit, wasting time and making the perk practically useless. 
---
Then it was changed to a Hex perk - Survivors now complain because instead of removing a secondary threat, they blast through the generators and take the risk, ultimately being punished. 
---
It’s in a decent state right now, there is actual counter play and the threat of the perk does help slow the game down a tad. If every survivor went into the game with the mindset of ‘Oh, i’ll break the dull totems as and when I see them for the extra points and risk of NOED’ - then it wouldn’t activate all that often. 
---
Enough Survivors don’t think like that though - so everyone gets punished because of that selfish behaviour. 
---
I often break 2-4 per game, and still it activates. That’s how I know others are ignoring them. 
---
I'd switch out WGLF for We'll Make It.
---
NOED is a fix until they make Totem reveland again. Right now they are too much of a gamble. NOED is also a gamble.  
---
I don't think NOED needs a nerf. Totem needs a rework.
---
It's a buff I'd say. Gj
---
[Does a youtube link work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X39nXDRNnOs)
---
Did you even read what the devs wrote? They won't be changing NOED anytime soon.
---
Fuck Yha, now I have a new perk spot for a really good perk
---
Sprint Burst, NOED, And bbq arent niche. No one is even arguing that. Niche perks allow you a strong advantage for very specific or very rare situations. Sprinting happens all the time in the game, so Sprint Burst isn’t niche. BBQ is a result of doing your objective of hooking so unless you’re intentionally not booking people, that’s going to happen, NOED is only niche if you don’t make it to end game consistently and that’s more of a mixed combination of killer pressure and survivor generator efficiency vs altruism but if we were to assume the exit gates get powered every game, that’d be a bit silly and NOED is a semi-niche cause it’s the cornerstone of endgame builds. 
---
Iron Will is a bit different. It’s kinda niche cause depending on the killer and their ability to chase, track, focus and your ability to evade, Iron Will can be super powerful. If you just run out in the open like a lemming then it’s defintely less useful, but for people trying out stealthier or mor evasive loves, Iron Will is the go to perk. 
---
Onto the second part of your reply: being a niche and being a problem solver are two totally different things. A niche perk is like Autodidact. It’s great, isn’t nessicary, but pays off immensely when it works. It doesn’t solve any problem. Comparatively, look at Borrowed Time. I’m not implying in any way that BT is bad but it exists to solve a problem: Heavy Camping. That’s it’s only purpose. A perk to solve a problem is not inherently bad. It’s dependent on how often you run into that specific situation. 
---
If you want to look at a bad niche perk, look at Iron Maiden, Mad Grit, Slippery Meat, Left Behind, Up The Ante, Insidious, Hex: Third Seal. They do things, sure, but the situation in which it occurs is already wild to begin with or you don’t ever need that situation to occur more than once in a blue moon. 
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Just clean the totems. It's really not that hard.
---
I did misread a bit, you never claimed that it happens every game. Regardless, my point stands. Both sides have expensive items or add-ons that tilt the game in their favor, and aren't meant to be completely fair. Complaining that a survivor can waste a few seconds in a chase to use up an expensive item and tank one extra hit seems a bit silly given all the powerful perks and add-ons that killers can use, DS is on the way out, and flashlights are on their (fourth?) nerf to functionality and require excellent positioning and timing, and waste time that a survivor could otherwise be completing objectives with. Also, lightborn. Where's the counter to Iridescent Head/Infantry Belt?
---
Are we seriously comparing a perk that only can be used once per match to a perk that lasts forever if you don't break all the totems and can put down instantly 4 players?
---
They are totally different and I can't see why both things are being compared, when 
---
1. DS requires skill (maybe not anymore with the new changes, who knows) and only can be used once, as I said before.
---
2. NOED does not require any skill, in fact is one of the most used HEX by the bad players, and to counter it all you can do is break totems (waste your time finding them or use a shitty perk as Small Game / use a map instead of doing gens).
---
I don't mean I'm against NOED but there is no way to compare these perks. I would compare them if DS was a perk that you can use +4 times, for exemple.
---
I had this yesterday but instead of me being hooked, it was me being healed. Instead of speeding up the heal they hopped on a totem
---
Oh 100% agree. If you’re playing in a SWF get someone to run small game and then that counters NOED completely. 
---
JuST cLeaNSe tHe TOtEmS
---
I mean in a kill your friends game, anything goes. Ideally the killer needs to have either an already built in instant down or everyone needs to be injured already. 
---
I didn't saw a stream of dbd in a month where he didn't use ds.
---
So you mean ‘No Mither’ and ‘Object of Obsession’ has no downside and all just good?? I don’t buy that. Cuz some survivor perk has huge drawbacks while killer perks never harm them.
---
I wonder what other ways to counter NOED are. Probably "Don't do gens" and "Play something else for aa week or two"
---
IIRC it still has the bonus regression for failed skill checks even if you have no tokens and IMO, because of that, it should retain that ability even when the hex is destroyed.

Ugh. I'm a rank 5 surv and the other day I had a match with two other rank 5s survs and a single rank 14 surv, and the killer was rank 14. Thanks DbD very cool
---
Only if I hold them there... I’d hit the injured player as soon as they came up lol not bannable
---
No it’s not... unless you hold them there all game
---
well, that escalatec quickly
---
Killer main and I agree. I mean if the gates are open and you hook a guy, you have to camp him because you need a kill for more bloodpoints. If the survivors are stupid enough to try and save him, and they get hooked instead of escaping, its their fault. (If the killer is stupid enough to take the bait and leave the hooked guy then he should probably not play killer, or try to walk out the damn gate with them...)
---
Why Doctor for Dio?
---
cause no mither and OoO is even above the "not crap" line
---
Totem is stronger than 120s 
---
Thanks man I will try this out the game does look very blurry 
---
Throw more garbage on the garbage heap.
---
You're still going on the hook, my friend. The powers of spite compel me. 
---
at this point 
---
When there was no bloodlust or window blockings and you could fastvault from literally any angle and you could infinite the killer in the big house in McMillan or in the cows in Coldwind.
---
Good I fucking hated using DS anyways.
---
Signed, bad at skill checks.
---
thanks
---
Now hopefully they'll do something about Legion
---
Sure, fine. Nerf a bit overpowered perk and ignore the fact that NOED is literally just as bad and it was buffed not too long ago as well? Just another reason I probably won’t be coming back to this game. 
---
Average killer on ps4
---
Bethesda bad.
---
Geraldo good.
---
Or just cleanse totems. But when I say that people are all like "Its unrealistic because some maps are hard to find totems on".
---
Where is this from anyway?
---
DS change makes it harder for potatoes to play survivor.
---
NOED existing makes it harder for potatoes to play survivor.
---
It's obvious! 
---
No, it can still only ve used once, and if you miss it will be wasted, however they are making skillcheck zone larger so it's easier to hit
---
&gt;Well for one thing the killer cant tell if you have DS or not
---
Focus boy.
---
IM SO SICK OF LEGION, PLEASE FIX HIM BHVR I BEG YOU. 
---
All that means is you never met good survivors who know how to properly loop.
---
&gt; Behavior - Buffs DS and calls it a fix/nerf.
---
Its a nerf. = Most survivors are proficient enough to loop the killers at the 60 seconds minimum. 
---
The only way its buffing a survivor is if the killer is tunneling the survivor or once the gates are powered.
---
 Even then the killer could potentially just leave the survivor on the ground until they pass the 60 seconds.  
---
You havent said how though. Can you?
---
It’s an absolute shit show isn’t it. You can’t enter a thread anymore without a killer vs survivor autism fight. This community deserves itself. 
---
Just hide 4Head
---
Dyingest light.
---
yea no, a swf will always abuse whats weak about a killer and stuff that the killer cant prevent. there is a limit to how good you can play a killer whereas with survivor, dont make mistakes and loop them for a while early game and its basically a guaranteed win if you genrush properly after that.
---
(obv not against a really good billy or nurse)
---
Oh no a killer main that is garbage and wants to justify his crutch perk he uses to get 2k games. It’s almost like the game is long enough as it is and if you want to slow the game down there’s perks like hex ruin or huntress lullaby or both. 
---
It makes dying light worse.
---
Consider you already killed your obsession. So they have the penalty. Next person you grab uses new DS. You now have a new obsession and thus dying light deactivates till you kill the new one.
---
"DS CHANGE HAPPENED, HOW ABOUT NOED CHANGES?"
---
"We do not think of NOED as an equivalent to DS."
---
The fact that you're addressing this issue directly implies that they are, if not equivalent, at least comparable.
---
But it is true though. One perk was countered by in game mechanics that anybody can do, and decisive was countered by exploiting pickup animations which wasn’t even reliable if you didn’t down them 5 can away from the hook. They aren’t equivalent, just run small game if you hate NOED so much 
---
7 minutes feels on the slow side tbh ahaha. Had a few sub 5 minute escapes the other day, felt bad for the killers.
---
“Just waste one of your four perk slots on a non viable perk if you hate it so much” Lmao get fucked your argument is trash and so is NOED. 
---
Right you could self care and finish it behind like 2 pallets also back when every item had one rarity and flashlights were trash dark times
---
Sweet, thank you!
---
1) It's a meme. 2) You're oversensitive about yourself. 3) You're bad at the game, and don't want to get better.
---
In summary, rethink what you're doing.
---
Is it really non viable if it counters the perk you hate the most though? NOED is healthy for the game because it gives the survivors a second objective and a reason to make games last longer than 5 minutes
---
Small game took a low blow 
---
that doesn't look like it should have hit though
---
That is not a solution...lol they just reworded it to make it sound new. DS is the same thing with the condition you have to be hooked and unhooked to use it....its a nerf all around essentially.
---
I'm no killer main, and perks like ruin or lullaby aren't very fun to play against either. I'm real sick of people whining about how noed 'has no counter' when what they really mean is 'countering noed means updating my play style and I refuse to do so'. Survivors can have the gates open in under 10 minutes, and having a secondary objective is necessary, since the game needs a speed limiter that's not perk-based. Nobody argues about that. That's what totems are. The other option is just making gens take longer, but the current system is risk/reward. Sure, you can save time by not cleansing totems, but then you're leaving yourself open to the possibility of noed. That's 100% intentional.
---
Most people will probably say Myers but I personally prefer the Pig. I prefer her play style and I like how her traps affects the game (even though RNG can fuck her over).
---
I feel like my joke went right past you
---
Small Game. Any anti-slugging perk. The fact that the killer has 1 dead perk for most of the match. Not being a moron and taking hits for no reason.
---
This is a perk which you can COMPLETELY prevent from coming into play, and you still complain? You're a baby.
---
I'll use it quite alot, great way to punish tunneling killers . Hell probably combo well with deliverance. 
---
I really thought exposed meant the killer can see an aura of the survivor, damn.
---
I don't play killer anymore because of survivors like you.
---
It’s not like killers don’t already have enough going in their favor 
---
New ds is designed as an anti tunneling perk but it's not good at it. Killer can just slug you and go after someone else, then once your timer is off come back and finish you off. 
---
If you manage to run them around then the perk is useless. You are getting punished for doing well in a chase. If the timer was to pause when  you are in the terror radius (minus when you are on the ground) then it would be much better at its job, being a situational perk that is strong in its niche.
---
The reason people bring up noed when talking about ds change isn't because they think that those perks have the same purpose, it's because they both reward doing badly (letting 5 gens get done/going down too fast).
---
Personally I don't have anything against noed and it's current state while not really well designed isn't beyond awful. What I wish they'd implement is any sort of an indicator that the killer has noed prior to getting hit by it. 
---
Having to assume every game that every killer you go against has noed and having to do all of the totems yourself in most situations isn't good design. 
---
For example, once 1/2/3 generators are done (based on perk level) killer's hands start to glow faintly, or all dull totems give off entity's eerie smoke to show that they can become lit soon. Now survivors know that they need to stop doing generators and get on totems, delaying the game and giving the kill ample time to regain footing and pressure the map. That seems much healthier in design to me.
---
oh Boi.. 
---
Could you hear her humming from 40m away? 
---
Unbreakable or no mither and they can't lol , and if they really want to waste that much time, then they can hook you again , you get unhooked and they are dealing  with the same issue again.   
---
I got Spine Chill tho, so I'll make you waste some time
---
I remember when this perk first dropped, and getting 4 stabbies in a lobby was typical. *shudder*
---
3 ranks better or worse doesnt really define anything...
---
That change was months ago, we're  talking about recent changes. 
---
I thought this was intended I could be wrong tho. The same thing can happen with Billy's chainsaw btw. Just wish they stop doing things without telling us or if this is a bug then they better fix it asap. 
---
It's still once per match and the stun is looking like its getting reduced. In addition it now has to be used in a specific circumstance that has a time limit,  what part of that isn't a nerf? 
---
&gt; If DS is best for countering bad killers then why do you always see it in high ranks?
---
Cause it doesn't matter how bad you are as killer, pipping is too damn easy.
---
Why is anyone hating on noed? Its not really that good of a perk and so easily countered...
---
Love this
---
The counterplay is to not tunnel the guy of the hook
---
cause a fade to black would be uneventful
---
megHEAD
---
Smol Huntress is adorable.
---
Bill was my first main and I'm 20, still play a lot of Bill.
---
I don’t even run DS so you must not ever play the game.
---
That might as well be cheating... instant gen... like... -_-
---
😧....That’s FUCKED up😂🤬
---
***THEN YOU REALISE YOU’RE INJURED***
---
Did any killer perks get nerfed as well?
---
Yeah, the rework or DS will change it in a way so that it won’t annoy killers as much and has counterplay while countering another aspect many complain about which is tunelling. I think the rework of DS sounds really good for both survivors and killers and I hope that if they rework NOED it makes it more fun for survivors while remaining fun for killers.
---
I know what you mean! \^\^
---
They changed it from a perk that resets a chase to a anti-tunneling perk. It can only be used 60 after an unhook. Now the killer can avoid the perk completely by just ignoring that unhooked survivor for a while. In short, it became extremely situational. There are some other small changes to it in respect to the obsession status, but those are rather unimpactful imo.
---
Hey just a quick question. How do you use/ setup the Nvidia filters?
---
While Im not mega opposed to a fair balance  change for DS, but this change is honestly concerning, since its completely invalidated if the killer has a mori. The two effects have the same requirements, yet the killer is unlikely to pick up the survivor if they have the ability to mori them. Thus DS and its purpose is completely nulled im such circumstances.
---
Not to speak of the lingering ability to dribble a survivor.. DS didnt get a slot in my loadout before, and it most certainly wont now.
---
I really just wish that this balance pass could've made DS a bit more fun or otherwise consistent. But alas, not today.
---
Exactly, having a totem score and making it clear it is another objective would really help the game counter broken totem perks while making it easier for new players to realise how much of a danger totem perks can be.
---
If you mean like NOED, no, the Devs feel NOED is a different case because survivors actually have options to counter it (taking out the totems etc).
---
The reason for the DS change was that killers had no real counter play options against it, (except juggling I guess for really short range carry). 
---
In terms of other perks, I'm honestly not too sure, the main discussion I've seen had been over this change.
---
That’s not fair at all. They should’ve at least boosted survivor run speed or slowed the killers walk speed or something. 
---
I’ll never be tired of iCarly memes 
---
Without offerings the absolute Max is 64k, more realistically around 50k unless you're running beast of prey and distressing (killer dependent)
---
Not that I agree with the rest of the list but... bamboozle is a great perk, why is it "unfun"? Because you can't mindlessly loop jungle gyms when the killer uses it?
---
Do you mean in general? Or from the perk?? 
---
r/youcandoitmobilehejustdidnotcapitalizether
---
I still have no idea how you did not got hit through that first pallet
---
Ship time
---
How are you still alive on Reddit with that kind of logical and reasoning attitude?
---
The solution is so simple and many just choose to ignore it.  
---
Ill grab the lube
---
Grab -&gt; Jab: Stabbing a shard of metal into the enemy characters back (Decisive Strike) 
---
Has massice deatruction weapon
---
I don’t even know why there is a discussion, Noed can be completely prevented, DS can only be stopped if your near a hook, they aren’t even in the same league, and the devs feel the same.  
---
I don't see how this is going to kill the perk or make people not want to run it. It can only be triggered in a specific window and not right away, sure, but it's still going to be an effective tool against tunnelling campers and will enable survivors to still be effective diversions for a short time period as well. 
---
Sure, it's been de-powered and made overall less effective, but it's still more useful than any number of other perks survivors can have access to...
---
Well if NOED activates, the ones outplayed are the survivors, because they didn't clense the totems.
---
Top priority is pushing this game on as many platforms as they can and bundling every new killer/survivor DLC with as many cosmetics they can churn out before the game dies.
---
No, you talk about this changes. I talk about all updates
---
He is only going to be reworked when he devs fix the end game. Because in the end game without noed the killer has no fighting chance.
---
haha get it guys because everyone who SWFs is some toxic death squad all constantly being as efficient as humanly possible in order to make the killers life a living hell and all killers are poor victims who cant be toxic in any way :(.
---
Lol the killer outplayed them by equipping NOED?  Jesus christ the way some of you guys try to rationalize the use of micropenis crutch.  You're just as bad as the decisive survivors defending their scrub perk.
---
What filters do you use on Freestyle? 
---
I love Deliverance so much. It is so damn satisfying to use.
---
Just lose the killer that moves 4% quicker 4Head
---
*Fucking p3 claudettes are so invisible I cant fucking see them why is this a thing!!!*
---
yup, exactly. killers don't knkw the TRUE grind haha. 
---
Just SWF and have someone run a trash meme perk to counter a perk that shouldnt be in the game in the first place!
---
What? You want me to use a good perk like Enduring to help counter DS? Thats so unfair!
---
K 
---
Rather have a useless perk than a broken one. Maybe we'll see some other perks. Also would trade a bit of slugging for tunnel any day imo.
---
Always makes me smile when a Legion has a bad time 
---
Yeah I have a good feeling that combo will be annoying for the killer. 
---
It’s definitely a nerf as well though. I don’t know how you can even contest that. It’s a far less useful perk than it was before, if somebody would like to counter argue against that I’d love to hear a reasonable argument. 
---
Aaaand it\`s gone
---
I guess the upside is you can't be dribbled, plus the skill check is going to be bigger.
---
But at the same time DS only rewards good players for NOED only exists to help bad killers.
---
So I feel like they are both equally unfun. 
---
You are talking to reddit killers. They do not understand the game and think that double L walls are infinites and bloodlust them, they dont attempt any mindgames or simple killer tricks like hiding your red light. They even still think flashlights are “toxic” and OP. There is no point in even trying to argue with them.
---
I saw someone that said the Spirit Fury+Enduring combo was a *meme combo*. I think that says enough.
---
I started playing this game end of last year, and I really like the game itself (although it has really glaring issues and I'm not particularly great at it either) but the community is horrible. I've been an active and involved member of so many communities, some of which are largely considered to be super toxic (Overwatch, For Honor, LoL) and absolutely none of them come even close to the constant toxicity of DbD tbh.
---
The counters to DS doesnt require any perk slots being taken up. Simple just dribble the survivor or slug them, thats literally it.
---
The survivors who let it actively are equally as bad. 
---
What's with the snowflake warning sign? Are you supposed to cover slippery ice with it or something?
---
"Just waste a perk slot on this bullshit perk with a 60 second timer, and you, too, will have up to two opportunities a match to counter Leatherface!
---
Unless it's a leatherface that can count up to 60, obviously."
---
Sounds like a good idea until you realize that’s longer than a hook state and you’d be better off just eating the DS. Also, they’re not marked obsession until they perform the strike. So you’d have to slug everyone for 60 seconds. So no lol
---
It reduces the DS stun time, the stun time that actually lets the survivor gain meaningful distance to make use of the perk. That is the definition of a counter. 
---
He gets paid to play it dumb fuck 
---
And he wasn't using pharmacy... What a noob 
---
NOED isn't even close to being as broken as DS. I don't use either because they are unfun to play against, and i don't use things that i personally would dread to go against. However NOED has preventive counters, counterplay and is only endgame. If you're a killer, you just have to pray that a hook is nearby, and even dribbling has counters if the survivors work together.
---
Wanting to nerf B&amp;C in its current state is pretty moronic.
---
NOED can be totally prevented from even triggering. There are only 5 Totems to cleanse and 4 Survivors. It's not that hard. Slap on Small Game, Detective's Hunch or the Red Twine Map add-on if you're struggling.
---
A Totem counter would be neat for Small Game. Just like Killers get a Totem count with Thrill Of The Hunt.
---
It's clear that many people don't understand that as every time one side gets something changed they feel the other side *must* get a change too.
---
What was the hex?
---
Knock Out would like a word with Deliverstrike.
---
The new perk is trash. You can only use it 60seconds after being hooked. What a fantastic way to have you burn a perk slot. 
---
Because the complaints are justified.
---
It pretty much was, If people think matches today are brutal, then they never had to have a match where 4 gens ding in the literal first 10 seconds.
---
Unless they're those toxic bald Dwights
---
Bubba
---
Yeah, or they could put a timer on how long the exposed status effect lasts after the last generator is completed, so that way the killer can still get good usage out of it without having it be completely broken and able to wipe out a whole team. So, like Haunted Grounds, but probably make it a bit longer than that. 
---
Confusing how?
---
"This person just stabbed me, better go hit someone else"
---
You should make more of these and sell 'em! I'd be the first one to buy one, amazing job!
---
Someone showed me this on another post https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0K3uvG6b4k
---
You're not gonna have everyone in a full random lobby clear 2 totems each consistently, SWF is different and killers love to complain about that too.   
---
There are complaints about having to run Enduring to counter DS. (Which also lets you tank pallets.) But also tell survivors to run Small Game which is a far less effective perk as a whole to counter NOED / spend less time running for Ruin which is still a massive waste of time.
---
thank u Worge105, very cool
---
Welcome to the cult of Dwight my child. Learn the ropes of lockers to find your true power
---
Ok. Without using exploits how do you counter old DS before the survivor is able to get to another pallet and start an entirely new chase?
---
Dribbling is for better or worse an exploit in how the timing of the skill check happens.
---
Enduring doesnt even properly reduce the stun time of the move and they never bothered to fix that.
---
What makes DS ok in your eyes where if you happen to find the obsession first you need to IMMEDIATELY leave them alone bc downing the obsession as your first down means you usually get D striked and lead on another chase which can last anywhere from a really short time of the survivor is bad or until the last gen pops if they know what to do.
---
DS currently forces the killer to give a free escape to the obsession so long as they still have D strike because picking them up could ruin your momentum. Leaving them on the ground isnt even a great option bc of unbreakable. It just happens to be marginally better than picking them up immediately and getting hit with D strike.
---
i remember when these used to suck u in before u threw it down 😔
---
Because the same people who say “just cleanse the dull totems” actually want you to cleanse the dull totems, knowing damn well that’s an extra generator of time spent doing damn near diddly squat for objective progress. NOED needs a nerf for the same reason DS did. It was unsatisfying and frustrating to be punished for succeeding. In the case of DS, being punished for catching a survivor. In the case if NOED, being punished for completing the objective, generators. And the people who say “well than take the time to destroy all the dulls” also gasp and clutch their pearls when you suggest that they just eat the DS and resume the chase, because they don’t want to admit that time is an important thing and survivors don’t always have the luxury of time to waste on totems, the same way they can’t afford to waste time with DS. 
---
I've been playing this game since it came out and I agree. One of my friends run DS and they only get to use it once in about 4 games because if they're the obsession they just get juggled to the hook because that was never fixed and hooks are stupidly close. I'm wondering what's the point of the wiggling mechanic anymore. You use to be able to get hooks spaced enough you could wiggle off but I think recently I haven't been able to wiggle off even with a body block in along time.
---
Not knowing doesn't make a difference. Most killers now don't know if more than 1 survivor is using DS and they don't need to know because they already never get to use it unless they want to get greedy and walk past 20 hooks to take them to the basement. A slugged survivor is doing the same as a hooked survivor being facecamped. They aren't doing anything and isn't fun. Use unbreakable they'll say. You know that can only be used once though right? What's the excuse going to be used next? Everyone should just use no mither? That's cool and all until every killer is using a mori and thanatophobia. 
---
The only useful change I see that they could have implemented to begin with from this upcoming update would be to let the skill check pop when the killer picks them up. That's it. That's literally the only thing that they needed to do since they're so concerned about the rank 13 baby killer getting hit with DS and wasting his precious time. A whopping 5 seconds longer at most because the amount of hooks and they're proximity to each other is obscene already. Let's take the 3 second time nerf that is being introduced. Using enduring drops that to a hard 1 second stun time. Which still makes DS effectively useless now.
---
Now survivors have to waste a huge amount of time finding totems, healing, mending, and squeezing in time to do a gen or try to escape a tunneling killer on top of the fact that pallets, loops and vaults were nerfed to fuck already. I don't want a super easy game but that's what the killers have. A blind man can 4k at this point. 
---
Do you really think the killer not knowing something makes any difference at all now? DS is the saving grace for someone who has been chased for 7 minutes because the killer doesn't care about anyone other than that person. There was nothing wrong with the perk and anyone that thinks there was is just bad at the game in general. 
---
What is the actual logic behind this other than "you changed one of our things so you *need* to change on of theirs" ?
---
An actual reason would be nice.
---
Agreed. But nobody ever said killers make the smartest plays in the interest of getting someone on the hook.
---
Enduring, Spirit Fury, and Whispers have downsides? Excuse me sir? As far as I know, those perks never harm killers at all and I really mean it. Well, unless you are really suck at finding a survivor even Whispers has been triggered. 
---
I insist to confirm that NM and OoO are more drawbacks rather than benefit. Let me make it clear, some perks that doesn’t have effect, AKA Hex when it destroyed or some perks that have never been used, are not considered as drawbacks. But some survivor perks do. Those literally harm survivors for equipping those and the effect are permanent. Unlike single use perks that has no effect at all after used.
---
You know what, killer used to have drawback perks before. It called Shadowborn, which is very weak against flashlight and now Dev already removed the side effect. So, this perk will no longer harm killers at all.
---
And now you may see the different. 
---
David please no ;-;
---
I love the nice killers :,)
---
Christ, that shit was hell. 4 people with instant DS was crazy.
---
DS has no solid counters.
---
NOED can be prevented from triggering.
---
Yes, but then you’re running freaking small game, which spends most of the game being a dead perk and wasting time on dull totems that should be spent on generators. Maybe you’re the baby who won’t admit that NOED should never have been in the game in the first place. 
---
It's a very strong nerf, I don't get how you consider this a fucking buff.
---
Here's a counter argument.  If it was ruin then the amount of rage about it being nerfed would ironically prove it needs to be nerfed.  Using your logic.  So lets nerf ruin next to shake the meta to a more gen pressure strat to keep the game healthy.  
---
Hhh so with your chicken brain you can't understand that sometimes hooks are "spent" due to killing previous survivor/s you can down player in corner of map far enough from hook or get body blocked by SWF teams so they can struggle to proc it. Struggle does not take millennia to complete and killer can't know if you do or don't have DS to "juggle" you. Perk was OP and provided 4 resets of chase if survivor had mediocre skill to hit that skillcheck. Will you admit that? NO Will you keep bitching about it? YES just like you bitch after any game you die in.
---
I don't want "anything more" from it I'm just providing counter argument for your bitching that it is OP when it isn't.
---
As I said you can negate it by clearing totems, you WILL clear totem quite fast once you realise it is up and most matches  end without it even activating (unlike DS)  Situation where survors are together and you taking them all out with NOED (slugged them) is slim to NONE! 99% of time you will take one guy down and by the time you hook him up POOP it is gone! 
---
And again do not forget that once NOED wasn't HEX and they nerfed it into it, to provide chance for you to get rid of it by clearing totems/destroying it in end game phase and to provide additional objectives to eliviate gen rush.
---
Now keep on bitchiN ;)
---
The past few teachable perks for the newest survivors have been trash, withthe only decent one being deliverance which you have to do something to activate it first and if you get hooked first well say goodbye to a whole perk slot, whereas killers teachables have been great and extremely strong, like spirit fury or even haunted grounds 
---
Explain why they're wrong.
---
To be honest, it's only been a pain when more than one survivor ran this perk. If they would have kept it like that but only allow a max of one DS user per match, it would have been fine too.
---
We'll see how it works out when we get to play with and against it. 
---
So why can’t killers do the same with DS? you just make my point. Juggle me to the hook, let me bleed out, hit the wall and hope you get that glitch that makes DS useless, hope the survivor misses it which actually happens from time to time. There are counters to DS Too. In your words:
---
So many ways to deal with it.
---
I can't believe people feel like this isn't a good and well balanced change.
---
That isn’t a counter-argument; that’s a continuation of my logic. It doesn’t rebuke what I said at all.
---
If everyone agrees that Ruin was “necessary”, I’d feel the same way.
---
You got to stay with the big boys
---
They wont know for sure if you have DS, and 60 seconds its alot of time. If he leaves you, you crawl away and heal. If he stays there with you 60 secs, a generator will probably already pop while he wasted time.
---
The difference with perk counters is that Enduring is an actual meta perk that killers would still use without DS being in the game. While the NOED “counters” are trash meme tier perks that wouldnt even be considered if NOED wasnt in the game.
---
What needs to happen is to actually give the dull totems some significance in the match to encourage survivors to take apart in completing their “secondary objective”. Something not as stupid and ridiculous as “maybe the killer is bad enough to unironically consider using NOED”.
---
Also lol at dribbling and slugging being “countered” by “other survivors helping out”. What kind of counter is that? 
---
The reality is that Both DS and NOED have counters that dont require perk slots AND the perk that counters DS (Enduring) is an actual meta perk while the perk that counters NOED is a meme tier perk (Small Game) that wouldnt get used if NOED didnt exist.
---
And yet one is getting reworked into a band-aid fix for tunneling killers while one still gets to exist in its same oppressive state. These perks are a lot more similar than people (and BHVR) wants to admit.
---
Holy fuck do you honestly believe this? I'm eager to know why you think a Perk that can be removed before it has a chance to even trigger is somehow more "broken" than a Perk with no solid counters at all.
---
You'd fit right in with the devs of call of duty of fifa. There a massive problem with the game? ahhhh just fix it next year. Just let the consumers have a bad experience for 6 months. It will totally be worth it.
---
Maybe in a swf game when its bubba with gate block when you hook someone or noed. 
---
NOED next? Maybe? Pleeeeeeease? 
---
If it’s so bad to dedicate a perk to countering it, please consider telling that to all the killer mains on this thread who keep saying “jUsT ruN sMaLL gaME”
---
Survivor main here (yes, despite my post history, I play survivor most of the time). 
---
The main issue of DS was always the non-obsession DS, at least to me. As a killer, you can somewhat attempt to play around your actual obsession. The other 3 that may or may not run DS as well? Good luck trying to counter that. A change was needed, and I think the devs did a good job at reworking the perk to be a situational perk with high risk, high reward that also counters a common killer tactic (tunneling). We'll have to see how it works obviously, but I'm very optimistic.
---
Also, they nerfed moris to require a hook before you can kill a survivor. I wouldn't mind them completely removing offering based moris (this would buff Devour Hope and Rancor) - actually I'd really prefer if they got rid of offering moris. It's a stupid mechanic, and I think that might be up for discussion next (after NOED was nerfed, BNPs were nerfed, DS was nerfed). 
---
So its same, but different.
---
That's a rough watermark
---
This is where the killers should dance xD
---
Like killers can  talk, they go on and on about ruin and how it’s mandatory to play the game. They all depend on this one perk to help them win
---
&gt; How can you become obsession if so many perks already require an obsession from the start of the match?
---
On survivor side? Name one that is used more frequently than DS.
---
On killer side? It was basically a lottery between survivors with DS (and a rare OoO) who will be an obsession. So the only change is that now you can "win" the lottery during the trial.
---
NOED is fine. The first suggestion is trash, cause you use NOED for the instadown not the speed boost. The second one is opk I guess but NOED is fine as it is.
---
Give a good reason why they're wrong.
---
Its called sarcasm.
---
Full of raging homos bruh
---
It's not in the PTB for testing. It's going live.
---
It literally used to be just like that before it was turned into a hex dude. It was on like a 2 minute timer or something. It was changed to give survivors a change to remove it from the playing field early if they could find it. 
---
Why are y’all downvoting a question
---
Toxic killer mains
---
I expected stronk big slavic woman but ok
---
Yeah you're right not really a counter argument I suppose.  But a thought more so, Sorry about that.  Unfortunately almost everyone agrees ruin is necessary (even though it gets destroyed in the first 10 seconds and many still 3-4K).  Its more of a waste of a perk slot.  There are a lot of really interesting perks in the game that I believe could be given really great buffs to make them more interesting.  I do feel like its nerf was needed, but I also feel like there should be a little more to it.  Since there isn't anything preventing the killer from just camping the obsession.
---
What if the killer leaves you on the ground for 60 seconds
---
I never understood the whole “mah NOED vs their DS” argument. Sure, both are annoying as hell but easily circumvented. You can almost always tell two gens in if a killer has NOED or not and DS only stuns for a very short time. It’s silly. I am fine with the change and will continue to play regardless. NOED me or stab my face off with DS. I still have fun.
---
I've never ran DS and this is a stupid change. Saying NOED doesn't need a nerf is stupid. I hate that they're just nerfing survivors more and more with every update and buffing killers more and more. Killers get aura reading/notification perks for everything, even for survivors just doing their job and survivors get nothing to counter it. There's 1 perk in the game to hide your aura from killers which only happens 3 times and is stupidly used up against most killers it's not even worth running. If killers want survivors dead they'll just slug them if they've hooked them already and wait for DS to go away and moris just outright counter it. Survivors need some perks buffed, most of the perks for survivors are trash where almost every killer perk is good. Stop holding killers hands, if they're bad they're bad and they don't need help for every little thing in the game.
---
No I don't. The free kill is consequence of you being bad at the game.
---
Not my fault.
---
this thread turned into r/woosh real quick
---
I don’t even use DS, as a survivor main, but I’m still a little salty and I don’t know why. Herd mentality? Yikes, brain. Stop that.
---
It's their new algorithm. It tells the game that hooks can't be less than 20m apart. So now the game thinks ok cool, spawn the maximum amount of hooks allowed and place them all 20.1m apart from each other. It's broke as fuck. It was supposed to eliminate hooks spawning in 2 feet apart and survivors staring at each other while on them. Now we just stare at each other 20.1m apart from each other. 
---
My opinion on wiggle is the only reason wiggle is in the game is to deter the killer from just walking around the map or to the basement with you on their shoulder. It's absolutely useless otherwise.
---
Yeah those are some great ideas hopefully the devs do something similar 
---
Tunneling is a part of the game, nothing to do with being good or bad.
---
If you play optimally, you will find situations where it is the good choice to tunnel. That is nothing to do with your bad statement.
---
If they keep the timer and the stun is reduced than its definitely a nerf. I'd say that only being activated if you get tunneled is definitely a nerf compared to being able to use it all the time, but this could at least be a good anti tunneling perk. If the timer stays and the stun is reduced, and only 1 person can use ds then I'd consider it dead on arrival.
---
Lol.  Noed makes you good at the game?  Getting rekt applying no map pressure, losing all your chases and giving up the objectives makes you good at the game?  This would be so much funnier if I wasn't positive you were trolling.
---
*writes down fiascotje*
---
I'll keep a mixtape for you :(
---
If only there was some sort of way of getting rid of NOED, like an action of some sort that would disable the perk, much like Hex:Ruin. 
---
Aghh, well, what can you do.
---
If it sells, why change? 
---
You want to wait for dedicated servers for a lot longer? I doubt BHVR has two network teams to work on both tasks simultaneously.
---
Yeah, I used to have an utter infatuation with Ruin, but now it sort of just drives me batty how inconsistently it performs.
---
They could definitely try to buff or rebalance other perks to try and encourage a more shifting meta. Surveillance and Spies from the Shadows were great examples.
---
I wonder if Ruin will expose itself to be a fad/trend or if it’s solidly locked in as “necessary” by common belief. I really thought it was the big bucks for several weeks...
---
Anyway, thanks for your thoughts! I’m about to get some rest, so I’ll see any other replies in the morning. Be well!
---
Same, DS usally ends up a wasted perk slot in my opinion same for NOED, they're both peeks that work some games and most games never get's used. 
---
Except for the times you down them in an area with no hooks left, or with survivors waiting to body-block or flashlight save.

DS, DELIVERANCE, BREAKDOWN and SP 
---
Hey, at least those perks have no downside. They are just useless for some reason.
---
Imagine when you equip both Objects Of Obsession and No Mither and you will see that using those E-tier perks or perkless are better lol

Kobe or move on to next game for optimal results
---
If they add a time limit to exposed then they need to make it like it used to be and remove the totem part. It wouldent be fair if the survivors could remove the totem AND it's limited in time.

---
What is that title and flair?
---
Oh thank you! I'm actually transferring this power to a new killer post I'm making because Freddy has a lot of fans who don't want a full rework. I still think it sounds like a really fun idea!
---
True to a degree, but if your option is healing slow or not at all its not really that hard of a choice. Relying on others to heal you is more risky than being able to do it yourself at a decreased speed.
---
Bye bye
---
If an entire fucking team gets down by NOED, they deserve it. 
---
List of things that invalidate/ weaken NOED: 
---
1) destroying dull totems. If randoms dont do it, try it yourself. Not that bad, although not the most viable counter.
---
2) try and remember totem locations during match so you can go look. Best way if you make it a habit.
---
3) A team only gets all 4 downed if they are dumb enough to stay together at endgame. The only times as survivor NOED cost me the game is when 2 or 3 teammates stick together. Of course the killer will be able the blitz them that way. If you see NOED, search for totems and avoid teammates. Its the same thing as ruin that way, on average, by the time one survivor is downed, someone will have found the totem.
---
4) killer runs around with 3 perks before endgame. 
---
5)Killer isn't omnipotent. If someone is on each exit gate, he won't be fast enough. Not everyone needs to make it out alive.
---
My noed counter doesn't only work on SWF. I exclusively play solo (haha no friends), and when i spot a dribble, i rush over there to wait untill he is nearly at the hook, then block, and then wait untill DS or wiggle(after 2-3 drops doable). DS also isn't a single down, as 4 persons can have 16 perks total , while the killer has only 4. So for each NOED a team can potentialy have 4 chase resets. Saying its just a single down is downplaying its effects.
---
Yes, I mention in my post that this could make unbreakable and no mither more of a thing. 
---
Someone might *steal* their *original content.*
---
It's the best ♡
---
Ok I didn't know that playing with Bloodwarden / Remember Me would make me shit at the game.
---
You are such a cunt dude, stop showing how little knowledge in the game you have, crybaby.
---
Bring a map with the addon that lets you see totems. 
---
Use unbreakable then ? 
---
The comment they responded to didn't even mention the new movie. The person you responded to was asking about Get Out.
---
It’s called ‘counter played’, not an intentionally downside of perk effect. And we are not talking about item and add-on at all.
---
Again, the comment mention that ‘every’ survivor perks has no drawbacks and I just disagreed with that. Am I wrong on something?
---
This is pure slapstick comedy.
---
K.
---
Lol who the fuck said anything about Bloodwarden or Remember Me?  We were talking about the lone micropenis killer perk NOED and the premature baby killers that use ie you.  Noone mentioned either of those perks.
---
I mean I play both and I thought it was kinda lame what they did to NOED making it a OHKO at every level. Like I get you can just cleanse totems, but sometimes you don’t have the luxury of going all around the map cleansing them before popping the last generator. And some of these totems can be in shifty places as well. Kinda one that you can suck dick all game but then break out ol reliable at the end of the game and start downing people.
---
But my biggest beef is with Rancor. Forget how it shows the survivors’ locations, I think it’s stupid how it enables a OHKO and a Mori at all tiers. Can’t even count how many times I’ve gone the whole game without getting downed or even found and all it takes is one swing to take me out the game like that without even a chance at getting rescued or an attempt to wiggle. 
---
But does it? Because you could still tunnel that person, slug him and then go after someone else which is a benefit for the killer due to one survivor slugged and not doing gens and wasting his ds perk, one person getting chased, again not doing gens, another person then or 2 if not on coms then have to come off gens to go for rescue of slugged person.  
---
That guy is the Man, nay the Legend Ainsley Harriott I'll have you know sir.   
---
Put some ree-spec on that man's name.
---
I am glad I did not play back then. Probably I would've quit and not played ever again. 
---
Not many game devs are good at their own game
---
Wait does this DS issue fix graphic bugs, framerate issues, random DCs, and the shitstorm of other console-related bugs?   
---
It was Decisive all along?   Well good on the devs for finding out that's why the game was broke, good on them for *FINALLY* fixing the issues we've all, killer and survivors, been complaining about incessantly...  
---
/s
---
Myers approves
---
oh no I take it back please no
---
Thats true. Thanks for the reply
---
&gt; empathy requires an item
---
what?
---
Thats true
---
Underated comment on a thread with so much crying over lack of skill sets to deal with Ds really. Rank 1 Killer main here , so much stuff that needs fixing and none of those things is DS. People get mad at ds because they blame ds for their poor decision making mid game. If you are over commiting to chases you are not getting, you are going to be pissed when that person uses ds when you really shoud be mad at your decision of commiting over gen pressure. 
---
The spirit. And maybe Baba Yaga 
---
Well, here in Sweden it is still snowing, tho I don't know why they put the sign on a pallet on the opposite side of the entrence
---
Rank 1 on both. If those are trash what are the high IQ perks?
---
The wiggle mechanic is not so the you can wiggle free on your own.  If it was it would be stupid, as it would just be luck if a killer could actually hook you after winning the chase.  Wiggle is to stop the killer always using the basement, and to allow teammates to try and save you with altruistic bodyblocking.  Anybody who thinks that you should be giving a free escape from the killers grasp without even having to invest a perk into it shouldn't really be weighing in on balance discussions.
---
Every perk is a safety net. That delusive as its best. 
---
Noed is nowhere a safety net more or else than Ruin. You are too bad to the game if you run Ruin because you can't win quick enough. Oh you need bbq to find me ? How lame.
---
Stop that dude. Either you play with nothing either you stop that non sense.a
---
Here is the juicy truth
---
Ds just got reworked, meaning all time before now it was broken/unhealthy etc
---
honestly speaking, i really love the new DS, it doesnt feel like a crutch perk anymore, more so as a means to deny tunneling and unsafe hooks.. that being said, a lot of killer's crutch perks arent yet to be touched, which in my opinion is causing the DS fiasco to be a bit touchy in some survivor's eyes... that and also the plethora of nerfs and bugs that ruins the solo survivor experience on top of the NOED wont be touched coz its BALANCED /s news , kinda triggers a bit of a saltiness...
---
*DS counter
---
I could see that, especially since this would be the anniversary of their roadmap maybe they want to go with a bigger update than usual.
---
Lol what a stretch bro.  There is no logic to that train of thought and it's basically just a sad deflection to hide the shame that you're incapable of playing killer without the failure instadown blanket to wrap yourself up all nice and warm in when the survivors toss your salad.
---
new killer in the back" the behemoth"
---
So very true, it's the scrubs making the rest of us look bad.
---
So annoying having a group of people ruining the experience for everyone.
---
Don't get me wrong there's definitely asshole survivors, and really hard to catch survivors out there. 
---
But people has to realize that the game does not evolve around your 4k every game, sometimes people are just better than you and that's okey. Someone looping, 360'ing, using flashlights and so on is not toxic, there is no infinites anymore like there used to be, the game is as easy for killer as it has ever been. All of those things is easily counterable, if you took the time learning how to instead of raging towards the survivors and just put on noed/ruin/mori's..
---
Excuse me, Michael.... Could you please maybe just keep walking and pretend this never happened. 
---
Everyone can use it, but only once per match and it makes them the obsession 
---
They wouldnt know you had ds. And thats 60 seconds theyre wasting
---
Something something DOOM DOOOOOOM I SAY!
---
The edges have always had a weird hitbox. But I also think that it's because Legion's model is smaller, and every killer has the same hitbox. 
---
Hmm, if i remember correctly there have been multiple experiments done with perkless killers abd survivors, and every time the survivors come out on top, almost as if they are better or something 
---
Then you can point at them and laugh for wasting time. But in a more serious note, yeah petty killers will do that to not get stunned. Maybe have the perk allow you to use it next time you are picked up if you are downed within the time limit.
---
If its me, its also the first one found and tunneled. xD
---
I like getting dribbled, what can I say
---
Unlucky for the first survivor that gets found. But a profit for the best survivor or a killer that gets a 4K
---
You aren’t forced into doing a daily. You can also exchange a daily once a day. You choose to play Legion, just like I choose to be toxic to said Legion. 
---
I would 100% buy one of these from you
---
Hex ruin: to slow the game down just a little bit
---
Basement build for me and 50k+ BPs after the game for me :)
---
That is called opportunity cost, you invest time for the chance to completely shut down a perk on the killer side.
---
Ruin is the same way, you use the perk while being aware that they could find the totem in 10 seconds, still worth it. 
---
Holy shit thank you for this great idea. Self, botany, resilience, pharmacy
---
Yeah I do say in my post that this may make perks like unbreakable and No Mither more useful :-)
---
I agree with what you said, but I believe that a positive change to noed would be getting the notifications when gates are powered
---
So playing it smart is now being petty?
---
You can lookup his game he played while on stream and he was playing as the hag... I think that says enough..
---
If you then proceed not to tell me or any other surv in the lobby chat you brought them I will be very sad and lose some of that respect :c let me stack it
---
Yeah I totally missed it in the shrine, currently leveling up Hag and Bubba for that BBQ and Ruin 
---
Eh, Survivors deserve it for the tea-bagging at every pallet and all kinds of shit like that they pull.
---
1) Cleansing totems is the one thing you can do to be 100% sure that you won't have to deal with NOED. Small Game helps with that, but you don't need it.  
---
2) If a killer tries to slug with NOED, you can use a perk to get out of that. If not, then you can get saved, which ties to my next point.   
---
3) People take hits/bodyblock the killer when someone's being carried to give them more time to wiggle out. People also do this against NOED, which is dumb.  
---
4) No, you can't prevent DS, because even if you dribble (which is still a significant waste of time for the killer), you need to be close to a hook. Preventing NOED is unconditional - you do the totems, you don't get hit with it.
---
Think about it this way, hooking survivors is the only objective a killer has. DS directly interferes with that. Meanwhile, all survivors have to do is complete gens, open gates, and escape. NOED does not interfere with that, but it threatens them with a more difficult endgame. It's a lot like Ruin, as it attempts to slow the game down by giving you secondary objectives.  That's all it does - and it's really hard for me to take complaining about this seriously. 
---
what if i got rid of a mori quest, on a killer i didnt have a mori for? what if i dont see an issue with playing one round as a killer i dont normally play, just for one game, for easy bloodpoints? 
---
Time to make perk builds specifically for cleansing totems.
---
Balanced as all things should be.
---
I think a better solution (as survivors getting a notification makes no logical sense, since they don't get notifications for anything else) would be to have 1 totem pre-selected at the start of the match to become NOED, then when all the gens are done, the pre-selected totem lights up.  If the survivors did not clense that specific totem, then it becomes NOED.  This would eliminate the need for survivors to hunt for every single totem on the map.  They could clense 2 or 3, and that would give them a solid chance of NOED not becoming active.
---
Anyone have a source for that picture?? I need it for... reasons.
---
When do i say that i have bloody party streamers?...*Alan Rickman* Always.
---
Im not encouraging or advising you on how to play toxic nurse 
---
I saw a lot of killers slug when they assumed DS,  anyway. Hell, I did it myself if I thought said surv was a douche or I knew someone was close by. 
---
Lol ok dude, keep slamming your penis all around the place and assuming shit.
---
I hope you can do better with your life kid.
---
I wish I could downvote this more than once. The "you are the one purposefully queuing for solo and putting yourself at a disadvantage" really made me want to throw up. 
---
Red rank killers play Nurse, Billy, and Huntress; Survivors can go ahead and stay injured so they go down faster when one of them pops out of the woodwork.
---
BBQ + Bloody Party Streamers = Blood Point Shower
---
I mean its a 5 rank difference and you have 4 perks from different charachters wich means you are obviously better than rank 17 so it didnt mean anything
---
I think NOED is fine, After being a survivor main and switching to a killer main I've changed my opinion on NOED considering I've finally how fucked you are without it if the survivors know what their doing, and even then a good portion of the time all the totems will be gone by the time the gens get done, or the totem will get cleansed nearly as soon as it spawns. 
---
1 perk from a different character. I main Jake.
---
It encourages you not to tunnel, there are already loads of things that encourage you not to though so plenty of killer still will. Really though a 3 second stun is meh, I dont see it having much of an impact. I might slug deliverance users more now though
---
Killer was wraith had: Franklin's, Sloppy, Nurses, and Pop Goes the Weasel
---
My "Meta POS" friend had:  DS, Dead Hard, resilience, and Distortion
---
Poor build, poor gameplay, gets DSd once, now he's gonna hook camp with leatherface all night.
---
Im glad he's gonna punish other survivors in future games because one person in one game escaped him.
---
New ds with deliverance? In case the killer slugs, go unbreakable or no mither with deadhard
---
Thats fair, thanks
---
Not as cool as your story, bro.
---
I was not referring to a 3 gen strat. I was referring to the fact that you only lose the game as killer when the door is open and the survivors escape. As long as even one generator needs to be done, the survivors can't escape.
---
Surprisingly, this is actually a decent change and indirectly nerfed and buffed other perks like rancor, dying light, save the best for last and play with your food, now change even if the origibal obsession is dead.
---
Yeah people often use steam, discord, teamspeak or another program to chat with friends when playing on PC.
---
Nah survivors dont think about that destroying totems would help them even if it takes 10 seconds to do so and they are in obvious spots
---
Red mori, noed , ruin, nurses calling , and another perk of your choosing. Either have omega blinks( pinecone and ataxia respiration) or 4 blink nurse with no downsides.( campbells last breath and whatever addon that counters its drawback)
---
Urban allows you to basically reduce your visible model by half when not running, did someone say stealth ? Empathy is awesome to know where the killer and your team is. Just think about why BBQ is so good (exept the bps ofc). It gives you information about ALL remaining survivors, and so is the role of empathy. I dont think I need to argue about selfcare, if you think this perk is trash you didnt play the game
---
It's basically borrowed time but for the person being "saved"
---
You don't even have to do them all at once, you could just do one every gen or so, hell it even serves as a good distraction to keep the killer away from gens.
---
Also encourages running mori to just not deal with it
---
I play both, why anyone restricts them selves to one I don’t know, and I think DS needed this. 
---
Damn that'll be nasty 
---
That is true actually, it could encourage that
---
Technically it's "let me out "but good meme
---
It takes like 10 seconds to cleanse a dull and they are in really obvious spots even with no small game its easy to find them
---
Your ability to realize what is a win fails by the time you realize that "Winning" is Pipping up in this game, so one/two kills is a win.
---
You don't need to occupy every survivor; how many times on this very subreddit do you see survivors complaining about how "We lost because I was the only one on Gens"? 
---
The longer the game goes on, the more mistakes survivors make.
---
I'm not saying that killing a survivor and making it a 1v3 isn't beneficial, but tunneling isn't always the correct answer.
---
This is probably the best worded of these that I've seen so far! A lot of people forget some of the best perks are situational or have high risk/high reward. Excellent summation!
---
But if you leave the person on the ground while you go to do other things you run the risk of them being healed. You also have the fact that unless they’ve been hooked once already you won’t know if they have D-strike, it just seems more logical to me to either take the d-strike or not tunnel the person just unhooked
---
Or what if, god forbid, you actually enjoy Legion? It's mind boogling that people will DC against X killer just because they don't like them.
---
&gt;Tir Optic
---
&gt;Bond
---
Checks out ✅ typical reddit user 
---
What does it look like 
---
Thats bc players are sheeps and dont know the game
---
If someone else runs to heal them, then that's at least 2 people not doing gens.
---
“Original”
---
It's not really a change to DL, all they have to do is not tunnel someone off the hook after the obsession is dead. DL buys a huge amount of time so it's not like they need to.
---
I disagree. I’ve played killer at rank 1 and I do plenty fine without it. Usually the game is over when endgame rolls around, but playing Pig is a bit different. However, noed could be any other perk you could use the entire game, rather than getting a couple kills in the endgame because of an OP perk.
---
Occasionally I like to play mediocre all game--maybe get a hook, mostly smack people, kick some gens. But then you bring the NoEd and scare the shit out of them!
---
And then I walk them to an exit gate, usually, as long as I didn't get t-bagged. I mainly like it for the panic. 
---
I allways aim for the 5 totems per game, thats why noed doasn't affect me at all. And i normally use noed on end game builds only with blood warden. Otherwise i just have a ruin and with that the game doasn't get to the end game.
---
Just because a ton of people use them doesn't necessarily mean they're good. Urban evasion is good, but learning to not need stealth to survive negates it. Self care was good, and if you run dead hard you can be more productive just doing a gen until you find another person. And empathy is okay, but bond and the Jeff perk are better. All 3 aren't worth bringing imo. 
---
Killer mains will cry
---
I saw someone else comment somewhere about a totem counter and honestly I think that could be the change that would make people happy. At least then you know if the totems are done and if you want to spend time looking for them it's your own choice. 
---
I‘m sorry i didn‘t read through completly :( i hope a couple upvotes on older posts will make up for that
---
I don't even play DbD that much anymore, but I must say that this change seems to be pretty decent compared to how it was.
---
Issue is all of those things you mention WHERE broken..., how deluded are you?!? Pallet vacuum, flashlights in its OP state (did you even see video of them "playing" with developer and instantly blinding him) pallet next to pallet that is next to vindow etc...
---
Apex is a BR shooter and has different crowd going for it..., it does not compete in ANY sense with isometric hide and seek horror game that is DBD. Now keep on bitchiN!
---
It feels very similar to noed in a way. Do all the totems and buy the killer time because you don't KNOW if they have noed coming, don't tunnel and let the survivors play the game reasonably because you don't KNOW if DS is around so tunnelling could be less efficient than not.
---
PLAY ON MT. ORMOND AND GET BACK TO ME!
---
A number of possible aura perks (empathy, bond, etc) or some make it their life mission to blind killer and just follow them. It's hilarious when I'm surv and maddening when I'm killer.
---
You just described the very definition of tunnelling.  Weather it's intentional or not, it's still tunnelling... lol
---
That seems to be the general mentality 
---
I’m not saying you can’t play him, hell you can even main him if you wanted. I’m just saying this is most survivors reaction including myself as the killer has very little counter play. 
---
It’s all good man
---
That's actually an amazing idea.
---
I'd say that if the killer can make that happen with dying light and 3+ DS users killed in the appropriate order, it is fully earned. And the last survivor is likely still able to escape through hatch.
---
HONING STONE, SO MUCH FUN!
---
Yeah well, Devour hope, rancor, franklin, dead hard, deliverance...
---
In my opinion, ofc.
---
Same difference.
---
No, you werent even off the hook completely yet. 
---
You’re talking about the green perk when he shows the screenshot of the changes? It’s diversion, Adam’s unique perk. 
---
Possibly, but it relies on the killer choosing to tunnel, and even then you're probably just feeding them 2 hooks for a strat that could easily just get you killed instead.
---
While I see where you’re coming from on the variables of NOED, I also still see the parallel of them being obstacles to both sides. 
---
NOED runs the possibility of being face camped after being the first to go down. All though this is not something that’s a guarantee, I can usually say a killer that struggled through the game without any kills usually does result to this to help him “pip up.” (I’m basing that assumption of face camping off streamer, my own experiences, and my friends experiences.)  Due to this, a “hunt” isn’t always guaranteed or effective when a teammate is already dying. If the killer doesn’t opt for the face camping route, dealing with a killer that has a faster base movement speed AND can one hit you is a devastating end game perk that punishes survivors for completing the objective and trying to escape. 
---
I’ve played both sides. Using both decisive strike and NOED and I can personally say that in my OPINION I much rather be stunned for a few seconds and continue the chase (most times I’m able to catch up right after it and down them.) than have to do a “hunt” due to a perk that is punishing the team for playing more effectively than the killer. I’d much rather have that stun than a possible face camp which makes me feel like Decisive Strikes rework didn’t feel too needed. 
---
Baby huntress
---
Dude I haven’t played in a while and even I know DS is overpowered, the killer is supposed to have the edge and this nerf doesn’t make the perk useless it just means there’s a risk to using it now as there should be because there was no downside to using it before
---
Just by looking at the last 50 posts made in the last 12 hours you'd have everything explained. I like the updates but 5000 reiterations on the subreddit gets tiring haha, good on you for somehow avoiding all that
---
Me too, primarily though because of the increased hit zone. I was awful at hitting the old one. xD
---
You do not need to be a bad killer for gens to get powered.
---
If you die by a NOED, you either had the bad luck of being in a chase when gens got powered or you got outplayed. don't get caught. Plain and simple. 
---
Ewww Bald Dwight is a dead one. They need to stay in the locker and never come backout
---
. Everyone else is welcome.
---
True, but it seems like you are forgetting the fact that they didnt have perks. Sure swf is more powerfull than perks, but that still doesnt make it into killer favor. And tru3 has recently done an experiment of his own where he played killer perkless and got stomped every single time
---
But isn't that what you're doing anyway against any killer? Waking each other up or waiting for (and failing) a skill check takes time, too, so putting multiple survivors to sleep still gives me more time to down a survivor.
---
Slug is like the easiest thing to counter.
---
I also dont run it.
---
Seriously, as someone who plays both Survivor&amp;Killer.  
---
     
---
This is a cycle that ain't ending well, ohh. Survivor got nerfed? Now we want a nerf on killer, Killer then wants another nerf for survivor. and around we go.  
---
That's how dbd works though. Nerf survivors because bad killers cry while also saying "just do totems" with tears in their hypocritical eyes.
---
It's the no mither/object of obsession version of dbd 
---
I believe it was a mix of swinging too far left and too late
---
It's true tho, playing SWF or even with one person makes the game very easy compared to solo. In solo don't get any info on where the killer is or what perks they have cause you have no one to communicate, this puts you at a disadvantage, so what you are saying is you want to downvote facts?
---
They are used in top tier builds
---
This is the reason the the game is dying. They change fair and balanced perks (DS), but aren't touching op perks (NOED) 
---
I think he swung too far left
---
Spine Chill and Premonition is an easy counter to Freddy. You know where he is and get 10% more skill checks when he’s looking in your direction.
---
Can say as a survivor who runs Small Game and is always in solo queue I have had games where I cleanse all five by myself. 
---
Nobody expects BLOOD WARDEN.
---
Yeah that is very true I'm not trying to say every killer needs it, certain killers don't need it, pig is great at slowing the game down with her traps so she can do enough damage to last in the end game, and if you can level up certain killers like Freddy there are perks like remember me. And obviously there is more. But NOED is available to all killers in the blood web from the start, it's good for people who don't have the money for killers with the best perks and abilitys or people who just don't have the time to get good enough to counter high rank endgame and just play casual. 
---
A perkless killer should lose to 4 fully perked out survivors, is that not the case? 
---
But on Tru3, I collected stats out of one of his streams at random for 12 straight games alternating killer and survivor. Only 9 out of 48 survivors escaped,  and only 1 out of 48 survivors made more points than the killer. 
---
20 pips
---
I agree most killers will use it to guarantee one kill and guard/face camp that one survivor. If you are SWF "hunt is ON" if not you can only hope that randoes are good enough to figure it out instead of staying at gates like twats without Ng for Tbag or two before stepping into safety....
---
I do get that you feel "punished for beign good at your job" (fixing generator) but honestly current NOED was designed to prolong said gen rush and force survivors into clearing totems out of fear of it 
---
I still stay with my opinion that previous iteration of DS was far more useful since you had chance to use it at any point in match to reset chase and NOED well no point to repeat myself....
---
And I really have to commend you and I am glad that I can agree to disagree with you as an adult and not have shout/insult fest ..., Like it usually happens here or in post match. Twas a pleasure!
---
Hopefully this means that Obsession perks will receive either a buff, a rework, or both. I love the changes for Dstrike, and while I've seen some survivors complain about it, I think we can all agree that something had to be done about just how powerful the perk was. This change will, as others pointed out, make perks like Dying Light potentially useless, depending on how many others use Dstrike.
---
Regardless of that, I still say that overall this is a positive change for the game, and it shows that the devs are really starting to listen to both killer and survivor mains, and that they're trying to please both sides with necessary changes. 
---
Granted, if the Killer is face camping in the basement this will complicate matters.  
---
But with BT and a some decent timing you can counter persistent face campers.  
---
Why go for the unhook... why would the Killer face camp? Rhetorical questions I'm afraid.
---
Don’t get caught? Oh, it was that easy huh? Guys, win every match with this one simple trick: don’t get caught. 
---
What happened? Joshie Cherry? 
---
Or is he screaming it?
---
I think the problem is that the core mechanics of DS is just inherently not fun for killers. I think now they need to fix NOED which is the perk that I think is the closest on terms of frustration. 
---
LIPSTICK IN MY WHITE VALENTINO WHITE BAG? *gargling*
---
Well lets say you dont kill the obsession and you tunnel someone else who has DS. Now you get free dying light from that person.
---
So according to the situation it can be a benefit
---
That still doesnt mean the research is invalid, just not as effective as it is today. Im going to trust martha and other pros judgement much more than some rando on the internet, unless of course you actually manage to come up with some actual counterevidence of your own. And i wont accept just a stateme t without facts!
---
You ARE a bad killer if you chase a survivor for the entire game, fail to catch him, gates get powered and then NOED rewards you with kills for failing to do your objective and being a bad killer.
---
The Myers one is pretty funny,  it's literally the shape doing the moonwalk and it doesn't benefit him in anyway, unless the survivor drops the controller/keyboard laughing. 
---
I thought the explosion would read dribbling, slugging, enduring, rancor and putrid oak..
---
I agree. But that is not the only scenario possible.
---
Oh, I though you mean that he is able to stalk you and tier up while doing that hahaha
---
I saw one doing it once, but did not know it was an xploit 
---
Now you're getting it.
---
Thank you very much for that FAQ. It also talks about having no plans of changing Noed, which is alright, but does the possibility exist of adding a totem counter somewhere on the screen? SWF groups have it very easy to track how many dull totems are gone, solo survivors not, so Noed is a lot more frustrating to deal with, and having a counter somewhere would make it more tolerable.
---
Just leave them on the ground for 60 seconds lmao.
---
Even though I hate legion, this is amazing 
---
rng
---
&gt;!The old guy survives and kills the guy shooting him!&lt;
---
Really? I thought my option was pretty clear. I'm implying that those perks are overrated and nowhere near as close to useful as those other perks are. 
---
Nah, usually have 3 in my swf, so everyone is responsible for 2 totems.
---
I think it is a buff
---
Facts: those groups were swf WITH MICS, which is not what most players are. They were all unusually experienced veterans of the game. They used tactics that are no longer viable (flashlights no longer instablind and killers pick up faster, just one example). That research is invalid.
---
No, no, you're just heavily implying that people shouldn't play him, and that people who do play him, even if they're bad, deserve to be bullied by survivors. I wonder if you're the kind of person who defend SWF even though they have little to no counter play... 🤔 
---
NOED can be countered. If you take out all the hex totems on the map (can be done easily with Small Game) instead of just rushing the gens, it won't activate. You can also cleanse the totem that becomes a burning totem for NOED.  
---
Facing a 4 man squad all with DS is incomparable to NOED, although it's also a crutch perk.

Just have 3 man swf and everyone is responsible for 2 totems throughout the game, no need to use small game.
---
I'm going to get completely downvoted. Isn't it possible SWF just tells the others where I am at?
---
I find it an slot waste...
---
If I can hook the survivors before they do all the gens and I win, fine.
---
If they manage to open the gates and scape, I face the defeat, even it is not a complete defeat since you still get some bp. 
---
Moon light boque: existed
---
Micheal with scratches mirror with monitor and abuse on lerrys: real shit homie
---
Oh no, I watched some of those streams. They definitely used flashlight saves and reverse pallet jukes, and easier fast vaults to get to safety. 
---
I think the biggest point you're not seeing is that,  what they built was the DbD equivalent of FaZe COD squads, especially in terms of communicating. How common is that? Definitely not 75-80% of players. 
---
Im confused and insulted 
---
Not a bad build tho, I’d replace Franklins for ruin though
---
I main DS as a survivor and I main DL as killer. THANKS for ruining TWO of my favorite perks. Witch are now garbage. For the people saying "oh its better cus it got a bigger skill check" well no shit it has a bigger skill check because the perk is fucking trash now ofc they're gonna give you a bigger skill check for a useless perk. You guys that bored over there? Not other shit to fix? I'm uninstalling the game. Fucking trash Devs. Git fucking Good. 
---
Only time autodidact gives me skill checks is if I’m trying to rapid heal someone in the killer’s terror radius and don’t have any tokens yet. Sure guarantee that I’m not getting the head off lol
---
I never thought voice comms should be used SWF or not, assuming that’s what you are referring to. I’ve done the SWF thing a few times and didn’t really like the experience. It’s a horror game, you should still be surprised even after countless hours and SWF ruins that. 
---
I like to think I’m a fair survivor when I play. No DS, tea bagging, camping the gates, etc. but Legion is a whole different level. I think all things that don’t have a counter shouldn’t be used, including but not limited to The Legion. Hell, I think NOED is fine too, but I enjoy looking for totems. 
---
It should be balanced around the top though. Imagine if riot were forced to balance each champ around lcs, buffing yi so he had a 50% wr in the lcs and challenger
---
Because unless Killer is blind or literally went the opposite way they're *mostly* not helpful even in Top Tier Builds. Plus all of them as of now have Counter Perks on the Killer side (kinda).
---
i mean, isn't the killer supposed to be powerful?
---
maybe we have been looking at NOED the wrong way, maybe it's not a crutch perk but instead it's a powerful perk? either way i don't use it because it makes me feel icky.
---
You haven't been tunneled yet, have u? 
---
how does it make me petty?  I play a game to have fun, I dont have fun when i get instadowned.  Why would I waste my time playing that game then?
---
More of an animation glitch than an exploit as he doesn't gain anything from it. 
---
Of course not, but i still dont think NOED should be nerfed due to survivors being weak, especially when the game devs (who hopefully has stats on this shit) decide that noed is in a good place
---
Bet they feel like a fool now!!!! 
---
And thanks for saying it’s a masterpiece!
---
Yeah thats probably why the hex totems get find 20 seconds into the game because they are well hid
---
Yeah, looks like anything that has to do with hit boxes is fucked, this is not limited to killer hits.
---
The toxic Squadettes need to keep themselves hydrated with all that salt.
---
They're used by some top tier players, but I don't agree with them deserving the title of "top tier" 
---
Because you’re fucking up the match for the other survivors by leaving, and denying the killer potential bloodpoints. Part of the fun in Dbd is being scared of the killer and them having good addons amplifies that feeling
---
[No](https://youtu.be/Q74Ej1uEl6Q) 
---
You probably missed the epic shitpost.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/apsu5o/we_know_who_the_new_killer_is/
---
I'd say urban does but not bond or quick and quiet
---
Bloodlust was unfun and broken, they changed it. DS was unfun and broken, they changed.
---
Its called balancing. 
---
*Haunting Ground noises\
---
Y’all love your meta perks don’t you?
---
Id call this a full rework, but i think if anyone deserves a full rework its freddy.
---
Don't even need to comment on the counterplay available for NOED because the other thinkers of the group already did 
---
We've gotten to the point where if you even kill someone, you're toxic cancer garbage and you're getting -rep and reported.
---
Still even Rancor is a rather bad comparison as you can tell if the killer has rancor or not,so you can anticipate it and try to build a plan against it.
---
NOED comes out of nowhere and literally smacks you in the face
---
"fucking cock sucker survivors. using an addon! HOW DARE THEY!"
---
nobody cares
---
Thats assuming there was a dull totem on the map when they were opened. 
---
I don’t run NOED because I don’t want the game to last that long. That and it takes the space of more important perks.
---
I believe that's why they first put "borrowed time doesn't work", to let us people with reading comprehension assume that they wait out borrowed time and then smack the person down. Not wait 30 minutes like that. 
---
There’s only 5 totems per match, so I imagine someone is a lazy-bones if they only break 1. 😂
---
Plus you never know - sometimes the random can break totems! 
---
Yeah that pen is something else man!!
---
And thanks, I based it off [of this picture ](https://imgur.com/gallery/Kg6C77i) so the eyebrows were a must. Without them, it looked like he was happy 
---
I personally don't run it because i think that it's using a perk slot expecting to lose, so pretty accurate i suppose.
---
DS is an overpowered perk that is being nerfed because a Killer cannot stop it with any kind of skill, it’s based on luck alone whether or not DS is preventable. There HAS to be a hook 3 or 4 dribbles away for you to stop it and just by dribbling you are wasting time. Since it’s luck based to prevent, surely it should be luck based to stop right? Nope, it’s a skill check you can practise and eventually never miss 100% of the time. A downed Survivor with DS actually punishes the Killer for outplaying and picking them up. A chase lasting 30 seconds turns into a chase lasting 60. Or a chase against a really good Survivor lasts a minute and a half, which after the DS, ends with them looping the killer for another 2 minutes and possibly escaping. A Killer could potentially down someone, yet not be able to hook them despite 3 and a half minutes of investment. And while extremely unlikely, multiple people with DS makes it so that you can’t even properly prepare for it. When the obsession uses DS, you are ready to track where they go, but a regular Survivor? You’re more than likely to lose sight of them briefly after the stun because you aren’t ready for the DS, wasting yet more time before you find them soo  after and begin the chase again. On the flip-side, NOED is entirely preventable, If everyone clears totems, then it becomes a perk that wasted maybe anywhere from around 32 seconds to around a minute and a half of your teams time. Now, in my opinion, I still think NOED needs a patch or two. The second a Killer gets level 1 NOED in their bloodweb they have no need to level it up further, it’s just as good as level 3 for downing Survivors so what’s the point? I would feel that if they had the exposed effect have a timer and if level 1 NOED only exposed say, one survivor (but have level 2 NOED expose 3 and level 3 expose all) that would be a decent rework that’s more fair towards Survivors and yet it still provides the comeback potential for Killers. But looking at both perks, I can understand why they nerfed DS before even thinking about NOED since the latter is preventable in it’s entirety.
---
Same. I'm usually in red ranks every season and NOED is almost never activates because the doors never get powered. Every game usually 1-2 gens are left and the last survivor gets out through the hatch because I hate hatch standoffs and just let them go. I used to slug the third survivor and use deerstalker while I hunted the fourth but I hated using a perk just to secure the 4k. My favorite default killer build: BBQ, Whispers, Ruin, Nurse's Calling.
---
As far as perk builds go, I love BBQ/Monitor/Ruin/Discordance.
---
I dunno, I feel like while devour hope takes a while to build. You can only guess the killer has noed until endgame
---
Why is that impressive?
---
The game won't die bc of killer mains, really. Well maybe directly. But please remember you guys can get the gens done in 4 mins flat as an SWF. 
---
That noone talks about it
---
Totems are objectives.
---
That’s what your team is there for. They take a hit you get away. If you can’t get away even after they take a hit....
---
The statistics I believe were that most players are swfs.
---
And I'm almost certain near all swf are mics. 
---
Mate its perfect for rank 1 as well
---
Hahaha I love this. The ability to change your name to fit the game you play is one thing I wish PS4 had. 
---
Another counter, but if it's less meta then balanced landing, it's unusable trash don't you know.
---
I really play with good teammates then, my teammates never block for me :) 
---
It's a shit add-on
---
Of course you would 
---
My idea:
---
Killer can close the hatch,but it slows the killer down by 5% and to reopen the hatch, a survivor must complete a generator. If a killer closes the hatch, all generators automatically turn to 70% and can't regress less than 70%. I think this change gives a chance to both sides. Not a perfect solution though. I'm not sure what must exactly be done 
---
Oof i see I've got a nerve there, enough for a downvote. What's the problem?
---
you ever think theres more to life than crying about what addon people are using? because nobody cares except for you
---
See, I agree this combo would be a lot of fun to run. In the right situation this will waste a lot of the killers' time. On top of this, cleanse totems like the killers that run NOED say. If you're safe in a moment and have a choice between cleansing a totem and starting a gen, make the totem a quick priority. Then when the exit gates are ready to be opened and killers start seeing NOED isn't available, they can start moaning about the work around for NOED being too easy.
---
You don't necessarily pip if you kill one or two guys, so its not a win. Also killing off one guy is not always the correct answer, its just 99.99% of the times... means one less person to work on gens and it makes it insanely easier to control the game.
---
You are **UNEQUIVOCALLY** not a ‘Killer Main’ - i’ve seen your myriad of biased and uninformed posts. 
---
Don’t try to lie to justify your weak position. 
---
I find that hard to believe,  so forgive my skepticism but I'm open if you've got a reliable source that says most players are swf.
---
If there isn’t more The Bee fan lore than is there really anything in life worth living for?
---
Wait, is that shit still a thing? Haven't been keeping up with the patch notes.
---
I see your point, and I raise you dead hard. If they know what they are doing, they can sometimes make another pallet and reset the chase.
---
Welcome to Dwight Priviledge™
---
Yes, but the totem should only get lit after reaching those 3 tokens.
---
Yeah, they only care about nerfing perks and adding terrible events. 
---
There are a lot of "wasted" perks.  That's what a meta even means, most used perks.
---
oh those darn r exploiters doing their taco penis chicken burger 😡
---
But I want to just do the gens and immediately get to the gate to teabag until the killer pushes me out.
---
not sure if its correct here...dbd reddit is weird sometimes 
---
this hit too hard 😔
---
Good. Go play something else. 
---
does is kill everybody
---
I always chuckle when i see what people put in end game chat.  Camper, tunnelers, trash killer, baby killer....yeah thats such a insult oooooo no please stop LOL
---
I never said it'll die of Killer Mains only. There's just as many entitled Survivor. 
---
I never play SWF so I wasn't aware and I admit 4 Minutes is damn little time but I'm sure there's still counterplay. I do understand it a little better now but so far I've, and I can speak from personal experience only so I don't want to claim it's for everyone. But even in Red Ranks I barely got more than a duo SWF.
---
Ah i see my opinion is wrong ok thanks for clarifying why you downvoted instead of making a case of why you think I'm wrong. Such a divine person as yourself could never strike a nerve your holiness just please look down on my humble opinion and educate me with your infinite wisdom.
---
A slug on the floor or hook them once more? A riddle for the age.
---
New cosmetic confirmed 
---
Look, I agree with you that noed needs to be changed too but I think you went too far.
---
You're comparing bbq to ds. Seriously? Bbq is far from op. There's soo many counters to it. You can hide behind a generator, you can hide in a locker. You can get within 40 meters of the killer or run distortion. I agree it's pretty ominous that they added the 100% bloodpoints bonus on top of an already good perk, but saying that it needs to be changed if ds is changed is just ridiculous. 
---
I agree wglf needs to add something like 20% faster unhooking but it seems like you don't understand the fact that killer perks need to be slightly stronger than survivor perks. Survivors are 4 and there's only one killer. If survivors perks were equally as strong as killer perks then this game would be super unbalanced. 
---
Noed has a counter. I know it's not a perfect counter because if you play solo let's be honest, randoms won't cleanse totems and if they do you don't know+it wastes time you could have used to heal or do gens.But you're straight up saying that there is absolutely no counter to it which is absolutely false.
---
Overall I agree with some of what you're saying but you exaggerated in some areas and your post just reinforces the "us vs them" mentality. If you didn't play killer, I suggest you do so you understand both sides and what it feels like. 
---
Yeah, no. Juggling wastes time in of itself, and doesn’t always work. After 4-5 juggles they escape and while juggling anyone can come and blind you so it’s not always a counter, not to mention the fact that it’s an exploit in of itself. Telling people to just use Doc to counter DS isn’t a solution either. And unless they’ve only just got DS or are new, Overwhelming Presence isn’t going to stop them at all and they aren’t going to miss. I agree that NOED needs a nerf but the argument that DS has counters isn’t a good one when the only two decent ways to stop it are play as one specific Killer forever and always use this one perk forever.
---
No, I agree. It's a solid idea to think of some beneficial perk that has to do with dead survivors. 
---
I'll have you know that Ebony Moris are perfectly fine and balanced, all they do is remove upwards of 2 health states + a hook state per survivor.
---
Meanwhile, DS is broken OP because it gives one survivor one extra health state. I am very intelligent.
---
And survivors with brains cleanse totems.  Shows where you stand huh.
---
"The survivors paranoia that you are secretly Thanos feels them with existential dread. Whenever a player thinks of you being Thanos they get a 20% action speed debuff until they stop thinking about it. If the though happens to be sexual for whatever reason, the survivor dies instantly."
---
But if it turns out to be wasted time...
---
It's funny because it's so damn true
---
we know all the addons got nerfed ages ago. they still help performance in one way or another.
---
BBQ was nerfed like a month ago and it is easily top 3 killer perks.
---
Also only need 15 or 20 seconds to open a gate lol.
---
4 man swf with 4 flashlights. Swapped to a LF toxic build (Nurses, ruin, insidious, agitation) I downed one and faced the wall and took him to the basement. I left the basement and hid behind some boxes in McMillan's map. When one went down to save his friend I went down after he had unhooked. I then hooked then again. I repeated this until all but one of them were in the basement. I let him unhook his friend the while the other guy was on the hook I repeatedly pressed Mori key so that my LF kept whacking the guy on the head over and over. When the hooked guy was just about to die I Morid his friend I front of him.
---
I read through this a few times to try and understand what you meant considering it was written so horribly but I think get the gist of it. No problem! 
---
Bye
---
There is counterplay I'll admit. Ruin, but that's gone so fast.
---
Overcharge or some other Gen slowdown perk like Discordance.
---
But even then, you need to be a killer with the chase and map pressure to utilize that stuff. 
---
But did you know if you think that NOED is a bad perk for the game you're automatically defending DS!?!?!? Because only filthy survivor mains think that NOED is an issue! /s
---
I never use the perk, do whatever with it
---
Worst thing I’ve done? I played leatherdaddy and there was 4 streamers, so I pretended to farm for a bit! Once I got them all to go to the basement I chainsawed all 4 and killed them! EZ 25k BP
---
I look forward to this for two reasons:
---
*The first reason is that giving us actual info on the totems, brings us closer to them being a more fleshed out secondary objective.
---
*The seconds reason is.....well i can't wait to see what new bugs this creates.
---
U basically made it already ;) 
---
😂
---
You won't be a true dwight until someone tries to dodge bbq and chilli by hopping in random locker but can't because you have already been there for the last 5 minutes. 
---
I don't think it should be free at all. By all means add it to either small game or detectives hunch. I just waste so much time when not in SWF matches trying to make sure my (half the time) brain dead team mates have cleansed that 1 last totem against a Freddy that is almost definitely going to have NOED.
---
First thing I noticed lmao 
---
You lucky bastard if you get totems that arent out in the open.
---
Yeah but then my point still stands about making it too situational, now that it’s only good for stunning. IMO they should’ve left it the same and reduced the stun time  
---
\*all 4 survivors die instantly\*
---
No, not "all" of them. Batteries and the filament amp are still useful. The nerfed add-ons hinder your performance because they drain the charge at a stupid rate and aren't worth running in the slightest. Any people who are good with flashlights I've seen in game understand this and only use batteries and the filament amp, and when you see a prestige 0 Nea or a P1 Claudette missing flashlight saves or trying to blind while injured mid-chase, you can be guaranteed they'll be running those shitty nerfed add-ons. 
---
When killers are already pressured to run BBQ and Ruin, slotting another perk (e.g., unnerving presence, enduring), doesn't make a whole lot of sense and speaks to how broken DS really is. I mean, up until this balance drops, killers had to use unintended game mechanics to maybe work around it.
---
Not to mention how luck based "herding" and dribbling is. Do you know how common it is for survivors to run into a map corner so that they have the best chance to use DS?
---
And it's still top tier. Go figure. Just face it they know killers are a majority and don't like to mess around with their balance because of potential backlash. Survivors have been getting nerfs all of last year and STILL this year. I mean I really don't care if that's how they see balance then that's how they see it. I just wish there was actually balance in this game on both sides.
---
Thought someone as intelligent as yourself would understand perfectly. If it needs explaining i was being sarcastic because you're clearly an arrogant person to "look down on" me. And my other point is I'd like you to explain your opinion because that's what normal people do when they disagree intead of downvoting and repeating that it's wrong. 
---
This game can be so painful even before the match starts 
---
They have present spawn zones lol, they are the easiest thing to find topped only by the killer and the basement.
---
I don't see how it would create bugs. I mean the counter would work in parallel to the one for TOTH. It would literally just be a number in the corner of the perk to tell you how many are remaining. The programming is done you just need to add it to a different perk.
---
The most fun games are when absolutely no one gets hooked and I literally don't have to do anything but skill checks. #SO FUN
---
Do I hear a rat? 
---
All perks have their pros and their cons. What I mean es that there are a lot of "broken" perks which each side (surv/killer) can moan about.
---
Plus, the change to DS and obsession makes rancor infinite, you can kill the 4 survivors while being the obsession each one. I find that an important and interesting "collateral" buff (if I am not mistaken). 
---
What i do is when i load in i do a totem to see if the killer checks the nearest gen, if they do it shows no signs of work so i jump on it after the dull. Then squeeze the others in defending on how the game is going.
---
WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD WISH TO NOT QUEUE VS ME, BECAUSE OBJECT OF OBSESSION IS ALWAYS DYING FIRST WHEN I GET A SAY IN THAT.
---
ITS USUALLY USED BY SWFS SO ALL SURVIVORS ALWAYS KNOW WHERE I AM, FEELS LIKE DAMN CHEATING SO I'M DOING MY PART IN TEACHING SURVIVOR COMMUNITY THAT YOU CAN EITHER RUN OoO OR ESCAPE, NEVER BOTH
---
Ah you cant back up your point no problem I'll just move on now. 🙂
---
That's what I meant, the survivors wasting time by cleansing totems with you as the killer.
---
Well killers with more than one chromosome will realize leaving you downed, with or without deerstalker, is a bad move; You can get yourself up with unbreakable or get healed back up swiftly after recovering for a bit, in which case they have to return to down you again, this alleviates so much pressure from he other survivors. But yeah, Unbreakable will be sued due to the fear of a killer doing that.
---
A similar argument can be made for lullaby, but I think that's a different discussion.
---
lmao, thats awesome :-)
---
"I'm not gonna play this game, cause BHVR nerfed a perk with no 100% counter and did not nerf a perk that can easily be countered"
---
Are you dumb? This is not discussion worthy TBH you are just dumb and one sided. I myself play both killer and survivors, DS isn't OP it is just annoying and cannot be 100% countered, NOED can easily be countered you are just a baby survivor who doesn't cleanse totems.
---
Or the killer could just: 
---
Not tunnel
---
Have enduring.
---
Seriously tho, now that the stun time is 3 seconds on all tiers enduring just eliminates DS if the killer decides to risk the hit.
---
Yeah, even wiki confirmes the change from Enduring is not 75%. But wow i never knew it was 4.8, it always felt pretty damn long and now i know why.
---
lately that was my experience with bloodwarden. I used it 5 times and never got to use it, I feel like having a perk for entire game instead of the one last chance for a kill if I lose is more productive. I'm not going into the game with an expectation to lose anyway
---
Because it takes away victory for who has earned it much like ds does.
---
That was a joke on BHVR being kings at creating mind boggling bugs with minor changes in the past.
---
How is NOED broken? If it can easily be countered like you said doesn't it fall on the survivors for it activating? NOED isn't broken and isn't a baby perk, it is survivors who are the babies who won't cleanse the totems.
---
DS activates if you're getting tunneled. What you're saying is "lets punish people for being tunneled even more". Great idea, 10/10
---
Why don’t people realize that it’s a joke 
---
&gt;DS is a get out of jail free card.
---
Can only be used once.
---
Wasted if missed.
---
Wasted on use.
---
DS in itself counters itself. 
---
Killers dribble and slug or let the survivor waste it in the beginning. 
---
That's 4 counters already. After this update goes through DS becomes completely useless. There is no reward and there is no risk to using it.
---
As it stand now, across all platforms, there's less than a 20% escape rate for sutvivors or somewhere near there. (Devs did a live stream about it a few months ago.) Which means there's nothing wrong with the perk to begin with. 20% of those escapes aren't even because of DS anyways.
---
But then i won't know who likes me so much :/
---
lul, I just commented the exact same thing on other comment here, before reading yours. 
---
Preach brother, we're going into the game for a win, not for a 'not complete defeat'
---
The only exception is pig with both NOED and Bloodwarden, in these games I just go in for a fun endgame 
---
Don't forget the 4% rules. Some survivors are like "you gotta respect the 4%"
---
Ok Adam but the 4% isn't 4% with deliverance.
---
&gt; I just wish there was actually balance in this game on both sides.
---
You know what "asymmetrical" means?
---
Stealth, small game, cleansing, pallets and windows, adrenaline, dark sense, premonition kinda, decisive strike kinda.
---
I should've stated it yeah. It affects people who tunnel focus gens only/bad players. 
---
? New nurse skin 
---
I still argue that Franklin's, and Rancor are the 2 perks that should have never been placed in the game. None of them really give much noticeable benefit to the person using them, but feel TOTALLY shit to play against. 
---
The points (bloodpoints AND ranking) you get from Rancor are so small, they may as well not exist, but denies the survivor god knows how many points with almost 0 counterplay.
---
Franklin's can literally waste up to 18000 bloodpoints for a survivor if they're using the best item with best add ons (but let's be real, the average is probably ~7k) and the counterplay is "don't get hit". Great. And the usual benefit the killer gets is one that isn't likely to be noticed. If someone heals with a medkit, you won't realistically KNOW that over them getting healed by someone else, and if it's flashlights you're worried about, then the person you're chasing isn't the one who was going to blind you, anyway.
---
Like, most other perks that feel crap to play against actually have a noticeable effect for the other player (Bamboozle, NOED, DS, Adrenaline), but those two don't feel rewarding to use, but feel gross to play against.
---
I was attempting to be funny looks exactly like a character from the Witcher 3 name Phillipa Eilhart
---
you can go into nomenclature, but a general rule are most of them are bad. including the filament amp. you're just assmad over nobody enabling your annoying whining over anybody not playing the game exactly how you want to play, quite sad really. :^)
---
My biggest gripe playing killer, isnt SWF (which i prefer to face), perks or killers abilities.  Its the map designs, some have absolute shit loops and others have loops which are damn near unmind gameable.  Some of the tiles need to be changed ASAP, looking at the maps with the see thru T walls!  
---
I really wish they would add a mechanic where if you hug a wall it slows you down.  Tired of seeing survivor nut hugging loops and my big hulky killer self gets stuck on everything :(
---
Yeah so NOED is no no way a bad perk, it has a big upside and 2 major downsides which are only playing with three perks and it can be destroyed before it even takes effect.
---
Honestly the only problem with SWF is that the gens are going way too fast that it’s not even fun for killers, we don’t get to even kill before 3 gens are popped, if you don’t tunnel one person to death from the beginning of the trial, you already lost.
---
Ohh. Haven't played that game 
---
IM LATE BUT FREDDY IS A FUCKING ASSHOLE !!!!! I CANT FUCKING RUN FROM  WHAT I CANT FUCKING SEE !!!!! LITERALLY ALMOST NEVER SURVIVE WITH THAT FUCK

Missing out man. Best game I’ve ever played
---
i can get behind the timer being 90 sec but i want this change
---
I mean they could copy and paste the code for TOTH and still manage to introduce 8 new bugs.
---
Lullaby needs something like that the hardest. 
---
It's your attitude that sucks the fun out of the game.
---
Goodbye Dying Light.
---
Ah, fellow Kingfield shipper. Greetings
---
Which Meg skin is that?
---
Do you know what wishing for something means? Just cause you wish doesn't mean it's possible. I wish we could just breathe in space is that possible? Ok then.
---
We can only theorise how the obsession status will interact with these perks. Until then, nothing is confirmed unless the devs say so. 
---
Huntress. They always have that op one shot hatchet add on or they tunnel you the entire game ):
---
Just a lil bit
---
The filament amp acts the same as a battery. It gives you 1/3 of a second more flashlight duration than the yellow battery, with the yellow battery being the second most powerful battery. The best flashlight combo is a green battery and a filament, so I have no idea where you're getting the idea that the filament amp is bad. My whole point was that the tir optic is bad because it, along with lenses and bulbs got nerfed. Batteries and the amp didn't, therefore they are not bad. Also note, something can be nerfed and still be good, but the lenses, bulbs, and the tir optic are no longer good. If you can't understand that then I can't help you any further. 
---
Keep being shit with flashlights (if you use them), because it's hilarious going against people like you. It's basically a free kill when someone is desperate to use their flashlight but has no idea how they work.
---
rAnK 1 dOeSn'T mEaN yOu'Re gOoD
---
Probably Nea. Her perks are very good for everyday use, rather than Bill's niche perks, like you said. Balanced Landing is probably one of my favorite perks. 
---
Also, I'd suggest getting We're Gonna Live Forever from the shrine this week if you're not going to level David any time soon, since it helps with farming bloodpoints on survivor. 
---
Not enough killers, plus this apex game seems pretty popular(most of my friends list is on this game) as a 50/50 survivor killer I only play on weekends due to work. And honestly this game has been clinging to a string for awhile on xbox red ranks is really only the same 50 or so people.
---
I'll have to check it out then :)
---
You're wrong bro
---
"Does this look dangerous?
---
Someone did the math a while back. I wish I could find the thread, but IIRC, the situation:
---
Self care next to a gen while someone works it (situation 1) VS heal next to a gen and then both work it (situation 2). No efficiency perks added to either situations (BK, PT, Leader, etc.)
---
IIRC, the results showed that the time savings were minuscule. Compound that with time spent finding/travelling to the injured/healer, no self care would be worse overall.
---
Plus, that was also back when the co-op efficiency reduction was not working properly. 
---
unbreakabill isnt really good unless you have tenacity . you should be getting davids for WGLF  because it shortens the grind
---
cry some more about dstrike scrub
---
Yeah, but what if you *haven't* killed your obsession yet, wouldn't the rework make it easier to get the kill?
---
Yeah, part of it may be I'm red rank. It's depressing, for now I'm just not going to play. Not because I'm salty at the game or anything but because it's literally not worth waiting so long to get a game (where I might get dodged mind you, happens a lot).
---
What am I wrong about? What I find fun about dead by daylight or the fact that leaving a game fucks up the people who are decent enough to not leave?
---
So dirty but so gd funny
---
It's weird, but I don't have the same issue. I run solo and SWF and don't have many issues until like 4am EST. Maybe it's partially your internet? I have a really good internet, maybe it connects faster or something. Or I'm just lucky.
---
It's killer lobbies that take forever to fill up for me. I always end up with three people and wait for ages for either a fourth or one to leave so that two can fill the spot. 
---
I just saw the changes for it and I am a bit mad. I tend to get hooked a lot and DS was my way out but now I might just not use it and switch to borrowed time, and some other perk. With the new changes I don't see it being helpful with my play style.
---
I’m thinking about it! I’m going to make another character from DBD next. And I’ll let you know about this one :)
---
you’re not wrong lmao
---
I usually use it to get my RPG fix and the DbD and other multiplayer games to get my social fix. You play Xbox or Ps?
---
🥴
---
BBQ and survivor pudding are enough, but if you want to minmax I guess you could add Distressing and Thrill of the Hunt
---
My internet is fine. Funny that my killer lobbies actually fill up extremely fast. I should've made the title something like "the survivor experience is awful on Xbox". My longest killer ques are about 1-2minutes. What rank are you? 
---
down to a T
---
Did you get to see vacuum pallets?
---
Also for fun look up the old bramd mew part amd the older one before that. Then laugh and laugh when arguements in this sub break out sahing "the devs give the killers so much attention this games fucked its just nerf after nerf for us survivors"
---
BNP literally would complete a gen instantly by right clicking.
---
You could type this exact same thing out and replace ds with noed. Crutch perks that are THIS crutch shouldn’t exist in the game 
---
I think playing with mica defeats the whole purpose and challenge of the game personally as a survivor. I always solo queue, it's way more fun 
---
Some dude used DS on me, killed him 5 seconds later and he dc’d with 4 gens left ruining the game for his team. I met him again the next game and brought a mori, tunnelled him and mori spammed him for 10 minutes, let the other survivors escape.
---
Nea all the way
---
LMAOOO baby survivor LMAOOO
---
*Laughs in distortion*
---
DS isn’t that great with killers pulling the drop bull shit.
---
I play both, and yeah, survivors usually have it easier. This was really well written. There's problems on both sides, but I do believe, in general, the game has been improving over time (*slowly*.) The only major gripe I have is hitboxes, especially going through windows. I feel like them adding the medium vault messed with window hitboxes and now I always get hit through them when I never did before.
---
Personally, I don't have a problem with NOED, but that's because I know the totem spawns and can usually cleanse them in the course of a game. And if I don't manage to get them all, I let altruism go and just escape to leave the hooked person to die. So many people don't want to do that, but it's honestly the most effective way to go about things, unless you think you know where the totem is. 
---
Game gets kinda dead when no events/ new killers are about
---
He is saying change the rng, do we really have to spell it out for you?
---
Gotta love salty survivors who are mad about the DS nerf even though it’s still usable :D
---
I actually agree with you, but the community is just drooling with madness over a perk that (imo) isn't really a big deal if you know how to counter it
---
Go troll somewhere else
---
Not to be trashing your video montage and effort, but good addons make all killers competent killing machines, even if this was to be released sooner, it would not show much.
---
To add to this play a character that has an add on that increases bp gains like wraith or michael maybe
---
No, this is a recent thing. I've been red rank survivor since Freddy release and it's never been this bad in my experience.
---
If you wasted those chicken nuggets I will have to throw you in Gamer Jail (aka the Nether). 
---
Go suck dick somewhere else
---
Should be default next to the gen counter, its literally only counter NOED for solo survivor. They need to make this change if they refuse to nerf NOED
---
Yeah thats true, but you can spot every person on here who uses NOED. They all always say "cleanse totems", which is pretty much everyone on this reddit
---
I saw it’s a win for the survivors who escape and killer. The only losers are the two survivors who died.
---
that would defeat the point of ruin.
---
Change the % on autodidact, fine, but you must be stupid to lower the Chances on ruin
---
Honestly, not many people do run DS anymore anyways. I don’t myself. But the thing is, people who tunnel are still gonna tunnel anyways. Imo, I wish they’d put priority in fixing the current bugs in game. It’s ridiculous that we have to wait a month or two for a hotfix for game breaking bugs. 
---
I tried to do something like this and they got to the hatch. Sad life.
---
Hillbilly has an add on that gives you extra bloodpoints for chainsaw hits but it stops it from being an instadown. I think Cannibal also has one? But I'm not sure on that. Hag has an add on that gives her 300% deviousness points but doesn't let her teleport to her traps anymore, though it's ultra rare. Others also have these types of add ons that give extra bloodpoints, but these are the first three that come to mind. 
---
As others mentioned, BBQ+Chili, Distressing, and Thrill of the Hunt (though I wouldn't bother with all three.) BBQ is the best of the bunch.
---
Best killer to farm on is probably Doctor or Legion. They rack up points super fast. Doctor + Distressing has fantastic synergy and it's what I usually run when I want to farm. Doctor + Distressing + BBQ + some other perk. 
---
And survivor pudding/bloody party streamers are obviously the best offerings. 
---
Let me add to this friend. 
---
Before someone screams at this person that Enduring was suggested to killers to counter DS, that perk actually HAD an impact on a "crutch" perk that was used and had an use for pallets and synergized with spirit furry. Small game is legit meme tier perk.
---
Mind you that your internet connect effects performance. So while it may be 60 fps a bad ping gets choppy. 
---
sounds cool. Though I don't think my laptop can do 8k atm
---
The Game was practically made for the Doctor. I hate to face him on it as a surv and love to play him on it when I'm killer. I usually see Ruin as the last perk but that Huntress Lullaby... mm, perfection! Great choice.
---
Definitely should have brought that mori, though! :P
---
I love slugging on Nurse, even if I'm not good enough to be consistently killing people. I even run Deerstalker just so I can be more bold. I see some nurses run the knockdown perk from Bubba as well
---
Meh. If survivors can have ds and self care then we can have noed
---
I mean, I could just remake this... it's not that hard plastering the ingame icons on an image. He also could have taken the time to reedit the subtitles to say, "Let Me Out". The meme police is here.
---
You spelled grammar wrong.
---
You also forgot this -&gt; 4head
---
Is 20-30 mbps good? 
---
Good stuff, my guy
---
Yrs
---
So a selection of meme perk, perk that relies on map and it's addons or a (sadly) under powered item. Thanks friend.
---
Honestly, the Game was made for most killers. It's such a small map. Have you ever played a Nurse on that map? *Oof*. 
---
I usually don't run a hex with that build if it's any map but the Game. The Game has amazing hex hiding spots. I usually pick up Pop Goes the Weasel if I don't have a map offering and I'm running a Mori instead. 
---
*Your gens will* ***never*** *be finished!!!*
---
This. I actually like the DS change. Anti-tunneling is nice.
---
I did see that after the fact, I stand corrected. 
---
&gt; won't be the obsession until you use DS, so the killer will have no reason to slug you
---
Unless slugging everyone except the Obsession becomes a thing. lol
---
If you fear NOED, cleanse the totems. If the totem's aren't cleansed, be careful when you open the exit gates. NOED is only powerful when survivors run for the exit gates like a horde of frightened chickens and give the killer a free hit. The lack of pallets also only is an issue if you don't hide and just make a run for it.
---
I play about 40/60 survivor/killer and have been struck down by NOED but also escaped a killer with NOED lots of times, the secret is to be stealthy, take your time and don't do the usual running/circling around and instead GTFO.
---
I am a survivor main and know that it sucks on your side as well with the old ds and everything. But let me say, it is the worst goddamn feeling when you get 3 hook saves do 2 and 1/2 gens, cleanse a couple totems be chased for ages and don’t get downed, (I pallet looped once but this doc refused to break it) to have the gens finished and some one open I hate while I’m being chased, I run towards it and boom noed, then luckily I spotted the totem and someone else did too but it didn’t matter because he face camped me, it’s just infuriating.
---
claiming you destroyed me, have we? all you're doing is explaining what addons do even though everyone has known for a billion years, and you're just ignoring me because you've lost and you know replying with "UHHH BATTERIES ARE GOOD TOO" is just going to prove me right. you have nothing else to say, you're strawmanning and being hypocritical, you've said most flashlight addons were bad yourself. it's sad to see an eating disorder do this to a person. so, if you've accepted you've lost, don't respond. it's not worth the trouble. 
---
Something something gates take time something hooks at agtes are a think and killers with map pressure can also run this perk.
---
If they know you have DS and don't tunnel you, that's a good thing. You can get away for free while the other person gets chased with Make Your Choice
---
No but as said u/Mollyneonfox, there the pink addon that allows to one shot survivor in case of direct hit.
---
Also its good to mention that direct hit on survivors with bottles also slightly extend the hindered effect.
---
I did see that after the fact, I stand corrected.
---
Never know :/ some people are worse against certain killers 
---
^ This, a thousand times this. Especially the part about "not wanting to change my playstyle".
---
This was funny at first, but now that i think about yeah, this could have easily been buried under with dislikes and mocking comments.
---
The disparity between the number of people playing survivor and people playing killer is really high right now.
---
"I don't want to offend but I want to offend you."
---
I want more The Bee posts!
---
I have over 400 hours but I said the perk wrong so sure I'm new to this game.
---
Besides, I never said DS wasn't overpowered. It's being changed for a reason
---
I think I ran NOED once in like my second month of having the game when I was grinding out Leatherface teachables.
---
I hate having it used against me and I hate the sort of “consolation prize” feeling it gives me. Now, Devour Hope on the other hand, that’s getting a treat for a job well done.
---
Agree with all of the above, just wanted to add on: trapper is one of those that has a bonus bloodpoint add on, I think it's the one where Survs don't get hurt if they get caught in a trap.
---
You monster
---
Also a very good tactic. But most survivor players don't want to take the totems into account *at all* unless it's Hex:Ruin.
---
Stopped to take a drink after hooking someone....camper HAHAHA
---
I wouldn't say "most" people but definitely a higher volume, just by default: 4v1, after all.
---
What do you mean rely on slugging? It's not toxic and easy like tunnelling (which is a valid strat anyway). It's a risky tactic that applies a lot of pressure while also giving the survivors a chance to not lose a hook state. 
---
Daddy
---
I love playing with peoples emotions. I’m a survivor main so I know the feeling as well. When the hook spawns beside hatch if they don’t wiggle, I look at the hook then hatch then hook then hatch, I drop them to give them hatch, then grab them one ce they go in walk up to hook , then turn around and drop them, I always let them go.
---
&gt; the perk will remain active indefinitely until picked up 
---
I dont see how that's different from how it works already. It doesnt matter if it activates on pick up, or on down and waits for you to be picked up, the end result is you cant do anything until the killer picks you up. 
---
Enduring is also A percent based perk. Meaning that since the time of the stun is reduced so too is the amount shaved off by Enduring. Killers aren't being rewarded any more or less for running Enduring.
---
If it is too powerful it can always become a hex perk.
---
I am looking forward to the day NOED gets a hard nerf you will see a lot of streamers crying then as well lol

Some megs make me sad, one unhooked me without BT when Wraith was damaging a gen 5 feet away. I was on death hook.
---
Oh yeah definitely. 
---
What you and the devs fail to see if that people cried about DS because it was a free survivor crutch for sucking and getting downed in a chase. That is correct.
---
NOED is a free killer crutch for killers who had a bad match before the end game and allows them to one hit anyone. It's DEFINITELY equal to DS. 
---
the perk says one obsession per match. read
---
The devs think NOED is fine where it is, so that's probably not going to happen.
---
T.TV = DS   But but what about the youtube  DBD jukes montage!  
---
can the devs buff wiggle please? it's just to worthless to even have in the game
---
MY BEST STRAT IS TO SLUG AND SNIPE GRAB PEOPLE WITH NURSE. ONLY WORKS AGAINST BAD PLAYERS THOUGH
---
Well what i hate in that scenario is those survivors get mad, complain, then killers see this and think the entire survivors base is like this and then both sides are at each others throats. Wish we could just separate the bad yolk from these discussions honestly.
---
Franklin's might be not-so-nice from the individual survivor's view, but with the regular occurence of 4 toolboxes in the lobby screen, the perk is very useful for a killer. It also creates an interesting dynamic in the whole "reclaiming the item" process. Especially as trapper or hag.
---
I generally put .tv in my name because I don't stream often or have a fanbase, but I play legit and use all killers and survs and don't use ds or noed
---
Dying Light
---
The active Obsession has the altruistic action speed bonus while they are alive.
---
If the active Obsession is killed, Dying Light's de-buff is applied to all remaining survivors.
---
If, at some point in the trial, another player becomes the Obsession, Dying Lights de-buff will be removed as the Obsession is considered alive again.
---
Posted by devs
---
No trust me I've been shit on before
---
Which streamers are mad?
---
As a totem goblin, I enjoy that free 600 bp without a worry of skill checks. I also like the way my characters moan and grunt because of how they finger some skulls.
---
I don't want to call people out here, but if you look hard enough you can find them. 
---
DS is annoying whether you're a good killer or a bad one. I play both roles often (survivor more often than killer) and everyone I play with agrees that DS is a scummy perk so none of us use it. Same with NOED but at least that can be countered pretty easily if you're not rushing generators.
---
You are the 1%, every TTV ive ran across are usually deuchebags
---
Dev stream!
---
I like it simply because it's a better Bitter Murmur, which is a perk I love. Why not basically add a Mori to my fave perk? I'm down for it. 
---
Yeah that's why it sucks for the rest of us lol. 
---
Just use No Mither 
---
Actually, I complained about it way more as a surv. I hated bringing it occasionally and having someone else get obsession; most of the time I couldn't even get it to proc before I got to the hook, so I just stopped bringing it. Makes it more fair to all survs because it pops right away now.
---
busting a skully!!! HAHA...if you are old enough to get that one ::D
---
This completely goes against my old steam name: Purge the Dwights
---
It's good with play with your food. Works on all killers. You can max your stacks out fast by repeatedly moonwalking during a chase with the obsession. That's the only time I've moonwalked a survivor. It's kinda cheap but it isn't super broken to the point you're just waiting for someone to bleedout while their screen turns black. Get my stacks then go find another survivor. 
---
Killer obsession perks are going to be pretty useless after this update unless you camp the hook and force them to become the obsession.
---
This new update is really going to hurt the game in more than just 1 way. It hurts the survivors more though.
---
I agree about the timer, it should be 90 second at least, or if they leave it at 60, have the countdown stop if you’re in chase or are downed. If you get downed too easily, the killer may slug you until they’re sure the timer has run out. But this does come with two buffs I like, one that’s intentional and one unintentional (I’m assuming)
---
First, no more dribbling. The skill check happens during pick up, meaning that if the killer fucks up and picks you up, they can’t avoid DS (and the skill check will be easier from now on). 
---
Second, it’s given survivors a protection that killers have had advantage of for a long time. Even if I killer isn’t running NOED, the ‘threat’ that they may have it meant that survivors HAVE to spend time on totems to ensure NOED never activates. Well now survivors have a nice anti-tunnel threat to keep killers from going after the person immediately unhooked, because there’s a ‘threat’ that they’ll have DS. So that’s nice, I think. 
---
&gt;  I think either they should have no timer 
---
One of the reasons they stated for changing DS was that there was no counter play. Making an infinite timer basically puts DS back at square one, except you need to get hooked first so I dont think this is a viable change.
---
That's... Really good, actually, and I never disliked DS in the first place.
---
I just always thought survivors were wasting it every time they used is it right away rather than wait until after they got hooked at least once. 
---
i like to think that the killers do nice things for the survivors when out of a round. trapper, getting crows and lighting fires, huntress, getting wood for the fires and stitching up apparel while the survivors are sleeping, maybe nurse and doctor patch up any real wounds the survivors sustain, and pig adding parts to the toolboxes, maybe the leigon's doing teamwork to do various things around the trial grounds, like adding items to chests and repairing all the pallettes. who knows, maybe the survivors and killers shoot the shit around the campfire.
---
This, although it is worth keeping in mind that 60 seconds starts the moment you get unhooked. So if you manage to loop for an extra minute against the tunneling killer, your DS becomes unusable. I like the change because it's added a lot of variability, the killer won't really know (unless they are actively counting the seconds for EVERY single surv unhooked) whether or not you have DS, or if you can even use it.
---
To add another note, 60 seconds should be enough time to get healed up, or get damn close to healed, so that's nice.
---
Slugging doesn't counter DS. The guy who's down still has it, and you haven't hooked him. Which means another survivor will immediately pick him back up, especially at Rank 1.
---
Dribbling wastes too much time and it still doesn't disable the DS. By the time you've dribbled him to the hook 3 other gens would have popped. Not a viable strategy at Rank 1.
---
And just taking the perk is not a counter. The whole point of a counter is to nullify what you are countering. This is like saying the best counter to being punched is to let the guy punch you. Ridiculous.
---
As it stands, the only killer who can stand up to a 4 man SWF who all run DS is Nurse. And that's if you are rocking your A game.
---
I was skeptic about it being overly political, but it was a nice surprise that it ended up being a nice body horror thriller bit
---
Uh huh.. fair in what context? 
---
Thanks, man.
---
Oh btw if you were wondering, Cannibal also has that same addon, it's "Speed Limiter", which makes chainsaw hits grant 25% more bloodpoints but the hit doesnt instadown.
---
NOED can DEFINITELY affect the outcome of a match as well though.  More often than not survivors? They're not cleansing those totems unless Ruin is up or they have a reason to. They're just pointless skull sticks to most survivors and there's the problem.
---
The counter needs more incentive for you cleansing dull totems. 
---
But to say DS can effective the outcome of a match and then say that NOED doesn't? You'd be lying. I've seen many really really really bad killers use it and get at least a 1k out of it or a 2k. 
---
Any kills with NOED is handing a free kill to a player. It also puts the now hooked person's team in danger by having to look for the totem to cleanse and pull off the rescue.
---
It's just as effective as DS was at changing the flow of a match. It doesn't matter that it only kicks in at endgame.
---
Ok, so you’re a child. Glad we established that.
---
A bad player would go down in the next 15 seconds. It's only worth it in decent players that actually know how to run the killer around. 
---
Perfectly balanced
---
wow ormond is looking nice
---
Whenever I have Rancor and I play spirit the survivor always knows and just plays really stealthy by the last gen. How do you get this perk to work for you?
---
Yeah, you know this changing of the obsession thing is going to end up being a disaster somehow!
---
LMAO. Going after the target that presents themselves rather than looking for someone you can't find isn't tunneling. It's just not being an idiot. Tunneling is exclusively focusing on one person to the point of ignoring other, often more viable, targets. It is **not** going after a target of opportunity that presents itself when no other does. Claiming otherwise is entitled AF.
---
Now I want thanoed
---
" aren't design flaws, the devs encourage them with their perk design. "
---
did you say this about the survivors perks tho? or bnp? or before the flashlight nerf? okay.
---
Your response to my first comment was childish.
---
&gt; The only major gripe I have is hitboxes, especially going through windows. I feel like them adding the medium vault messed with window hitboxes and now I always get hit through them when I never did before.
---
This is exactly why devs added that - so that survivors can't fast vault through everything. It made certain structures too strong for survivors and it didn't matter what route killers forced survivors run. Adding the medium vault allows killers to have some ability to end loops
---
And devs fixed it so that survivors keep their momentum after a fast vault. The number of fast vault window hits have decreased a lot
---
Why is adding it to the default game broken? This only hurts killers who rely on NOED and does nothing but benefit the killers who don’t.
---
Naw you good 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL8e2ujXe8g
---
No you will be fine. Happened to me as a killer a few times. It's just a bug you can't do anything about.
---
I hate farming it’s so damn boring
---
I usually just tried to eat the ds as soon as possible in the game to get it out of the way. I never saw dribbling as a good option just down them again shouldn't take too long unless theres like perfect situations.
---
Yes, because it’s a tunneling counter perk. The length of the chase should not matter, you can be tunneled whether it’s 5 seconds or 3 minutes. That should be the downside of the killer choosing to tunnel.
---
Exactly, I feel like it’s a Crutch that if you’re good enough you won’t ever need to rely on
---
Depends how you do it and which killer you play.
---
Nice, was applying your meme but to adrenaline pops when the killer swingin’ 
---
I understand this but I can’t blame my teammates when I get facecamped.
---
Ecactly
---
I don't think I've ever seen someone mad about Bond before. that's weird
---
Either that, or split b and c into 2 perks
---
I mean even with fast vaults. It's weird. It's seems like the killer has stretch arms lol. Might just be me not used to the new vaults yet, idk. But hey, hitboxes in general are still broken. 
---
RELATABLE
---
They're both perks that bad players use as a crutch, but to say noed is as strong as or even stronger than ds is a joke
---
Thank you for this new accurate justice
---
Dribbling still wastes a lot of time and only works if you get slugged close enough to a hook. New ds is more consistent for both of us thankfully
---
The skill check will appear during pick up to prevent dribbling.
---
&gt; I probably play more survivor than killer
---
yeah we know
---
&gt; though not by much.
---
x for doubt 
---
Dribbling would need to be done up to 3 times on a Survivor. That alone isn't very reliable, even less so against a non-obsession with DS.
---
Bleeding out takes 4 minutes and the person can be healed.
---
Hitting the wall to cause a bug is nothing more than a bug and obviously shouldn't exist.
---
So none of those are solid counters.
---
Yet again isn't that like that with any killer? 
---
I kind of disagree. It is the same for Nurse's Calling, sometimes I don't need it because I don't lose a single chase.  
---
The good think with NOED is it will stall the game as they will cleanse totem to counter it. If they don't and you end the game before, then it is up to you. If they go for the 5 gens, well you probably win if NOED is active.  
---
For me, NOED is a super Ruin. Ruin often does not stand for more than 30 sec per game while NOED will keep them busy for way longer.
---
A suggestion like that MUST be a troll, or are you very new to the game? I apologise, genuinely. It just seemed, absurd, and I’ve already seen loads of killers and survivors making outlandish balance suggestions that would utterly ruin the game. 
---
Again, doubt all you like lmao. What purpose do I have in lying? 
---
You keep using that word... I dont think you know what it means.
---
It's really not that much time for 4 people to cleanse 5 Totems. Less time when you learn the possible spawn points. People just don't bother with them at all.
---
They answered. DL is reset when a new obsession appear,
---
\#DwightLivesMatter
---
Small game perk could possibilty have the count added onto it. It would force survivors to make a choice, run 1 perk that guarantees totem hunting success or try to find it on your own. 
---
Which Perk?
---
I dunno. I can't guess other peoples' motivations. But it's pretty obvious when someone has very, very little killer experience 
---
I’ve been playing since 2017, and a slightly faster run speed wouldn’t ruin the game at all. 
---
It is very boring, which is why I like to spice it up! I only actually do it when there's a lot of bloody party streamers or one or more people dc.
---
Someone clearly doesn't know the history of this game.
---
Hex : Ruin for killers and maybe sprint busrt or Borrowed time for Survivors
---
I'm guessing the updated auras we got a little while back didn't happen on Ormond.
---
I honestly really enjoy it, i'm just a little worried about Dying Light knowing how obsession can change
---
I honestly think i do better not running tombstone. You fuck over 1 or 2 survivors, but it takes the whole game to get to that point.
---
Hmm, imo? Survivor: best is Dead Hard/worst is Deja Vu. Killer: best is Enduring/worst is Predator.
---
Bamboozle, sprint burst
---
You don't need to escape? The killers don't need to kill either to pip so it's both ways
---
Those Survivors sure do like to flunk a lotta skill checks don't they?  
---
That regression was painful.
---
Ok to make it clear to you let's take the suggested perk counters to NOED and DS as it is right now.
---
For DS people sugegst Enduring, a perk that actually has a noticable effect on a perk the survivors use and doubles as a disrespect pallet perk, also it has synergy with Spirit Furry.
---
As for NOED we have small game, it can track killer belongings at a small range and then goes on cooldown....thrilling. Also i don't say this without trying the perks out, because everyone seems to have this stupid idea, i tried them both, Enduring is great even if DS gets changed, small game is awkward and offers nothing other than minimal info on totem locations and on certain maps like the game, it's wasted perk.
---
Maps are not extremely bad as items, but considering my other choices it's the least solid by far.
---
No one left behind is the weakest survivor perk.
---
Monstrous shrine is the weakest killer perk
---
How *dare* the 1 in a 1v4 have the advantage.
---
NOED Should not be nerfed because he reward bad killer killing bad surv.
---
Lol you should never worry about getting reported in this game
---
Lazy but true. Anything that involves the tunneling and removal of one player as quickly as possible should not exist. However, if it’s kept as is, after you are done tunneling the guy now you have every reason to no longer tunnel anyone else to keep the perk alive and going. I believe the devs would view that as a positive thing. So a simple answer is to just not tunnel after the obsession is killed, easy! Obsession never changes due to DS not being used.
---
If you say so, my dude lol
---
ok cool :)
---
Just because someone is in purple rank doesn't mean they know what all of the killer perks do, my very first season I made to rank 1 and I had no clue what I was doing. 
---
Lmaooooo. 
---
Did you miss our intentionally ignore the part where I said if they're bad you shouldn't need it and yet everybody still runs it. The short would be better spent with literally anything else if the only use was against bad killers.
---
If anything your point of view seems flawed.
---
Current DS being saved for endgame? Congrats you lost a chase. You passed a skill check and your home free.  You've won when you should've lost. This was a point that came up with current DS as well, because people would save it for their last hook or when they were by the exit gate and all that time you put into chasing them?  Wasted.
---
A perk should not win you a game. For either side. DS can win games for survivors. NOED can win games for killers.  And thus they are equal.
---
This is how I see it too, but when ever I say that ppl down vote me :c
---
"Bird Heavy is going to lay egg. Down your throat!"
---
You've got nothing to worry about. That report isn't going to do shit.
---
It's on PC, the aura's on ormond are almost invisble to me. Maybe I should change some settings or maybe it's because I'm a little colour blind, but I swear that the ormond aura's are way less vissibme than on other maps to me
---
Decisive Strike
---
*When bubba uses speed limiter*
---
I think NOED should be baseline, but totem count should appear on the HUD from the beginning of the match. Making totems appear more like an optional sub-objective to make the last part of the match 100% more stress free.
---
And, since this slows down the game, nerf Ruin, because this change plus Ruin would be over-doing it.
---
I do have to agree that perks should be influenced by the strength and the fun in using it, such as bbq. It promotes leaving the hooked person and gives more fun to the hooked player. Im just wondering on how they could do the same with a perk such as this without angering the player. Such as noed
---
BBQ is not op... wtf
---
One report isnt going to do anything, especially from a bug that they know about. 
---
I feel like you barely play killer and you use your 5 matches at rank 15 as proof that you are an expert. The toxic swf stigma comes from the fact that you will often find 4 stacks with flashlights and toolboxes that will try their darndest to shit on you, then be toxic in postgame, I see it so often. Here I'm just going to take apart each of your points one by one starting from the top.
---
&gt; I wasn't talking about vacuums. I was specifically talking about the number of pallets as opposed to before is down to almost nothing and the distance between them is absurdly high compared to the new hook algorithm.
---
Absurdly high, this is unspecific and can mean many different things based on your interpretation so it effectively means nothing, however I will comment on it and say that pallets should not be close enough to where a survivor can run from pallet to pallet not getting hit without doing some sort of juke or mindgame, so spacing them out more is good.
---
&gt; Infinites still exist on specific maps with the right loadout. Anyone with a brain that sees a survivor going for an infinite needs to break chase immediately unless that survivor is clueless and has no idea how to run infinites or the majority of loops to begin with. If they don't then that's on them.
---
Man people these days are such babies, diluting the true meaning of infinites. Infinites used to mean a spot where it is impossible for the killer to catch you. There are no more of these in the game unless there is a map gen glitch causing a fat shame spot. What does exist are long loops and efficient survivors, not infinites. If you really can't take it, run bamboozle. Finally, I will add that there shouldn't be places like this in the game where great survivors can take up minutes of your time without using pallets. There should be places like the shack where a good survivor can waste your time but a good killer can shut it down, and it becomes less effective once the pallet is gone. 
---
&gt; Insta blinds sucked. Was it abused by the majority? No. Was it abused by the minority? Yes. Was it abused on Mr. "Play civilization" yeah. The add-ons needed was ultra rare to begin with so it wasn't common to come across in an actual match.
---
Instablinds had no counter and no place in the game, you had no time to react to them. Additionally, many people devoted themselves to camping and tunneling these survivors to death to remove their flashlights. While they may not have been that common, the advantage they give you makes it tough to kill them. Additionally there were so many screen shots of people with dozens of odd bulbs in their inventory at the time.
---
&gt; The point loss in emblem scoring for face camping is so low that it doesn't matter. People still do it because the point loss is a total fucking joke.
---
People still do it because it is an effective and often only strategy against lemmings or after the gates are open. I rarely see killer past rank 10 camp for no reason. It honestly not even an issue, the killer should be able to defend their hook, and they can't even against multiple survivors with borrowed time.
---
&gt; If you think legion is the only killer that can moonwalk exploit then I've got news for you for those borrowed time saves.
---
LOL, since borrowed time was nerfed to be balanced no one runs it, now that it's not op everyone ditched it. I haven't seen borrowed time in so long that it isn't even an issue. But who actually moonwalks people with borrowed time, like what? Just hit them again, go for the rescuer, or don't camp if you can't help it.
---
&gt; Vault nerfs. I wasn't talking about the indicator on the bottom of the screen to ensure you get a fast vault. Again, the same as the pallets. They've removed a lot of the window vaults from the game to make it easier for thr killer.
---
What you mean making the requirements for a fast vault consistent and readily apparent to the survivors when they can perform it? OH DEAR SO HORRIBLE. Grow up, are you actually bitching about quality of life changes? That specifically wasnt even a nerf. Now as far as removing vaults this is so important. The old house in mothers dwelling was horrible, cowshed double window anyone??? closing windows is such an important change they started making a while back that introduced more unpredictability so that survivors can just use the same strats every game on one map.
---
&gt; They didn't nerf hook spawns. The maximum allowable hooks spawn in every hook location available and are all 20m apart. The only thing the fixed was the proximity of hooks throughout the gidions meat plant because of the basement. Hook placement is still the same otherwise.
---
Hooks aren't event hat close anymore, sometimes youll get rng patches of hooks which are kinda close but overall theres no real inbalance.
---
&gt; Every update so far has in some way nerfed the survivor either directly or indirectly with perk nerfs. Meanwhile killers are seeing obscene buffs. I'm not bad at the game at all. I have adapted to the changes. I can and more often than not, run the killer for 4 gens at a time. As a killer, everyone is dead before or right after the first gen is done. And that's with people using DS. Playing killer is already boring for me as it is. Even against swf. It must suck to suck but I personally don't have a problem against swf. Swf doesn't mean an automatic win. The larger majority of them just wanna have a good time and move onto the next match while talking to their friends. This bullshit made up stigma about "all swf are 'toxic'" has got to fucking stop because it simply isn't true in the slightest. It's about as true as Dwights always being in lockers or all Claudettes are flashlight carrying griefers. It isn't true but it won't stop the memes. 😉
---
The main reason for all of the survivor nerfs and killer buffs is that in the beginning of the game, killer was easy to play and survivors had no idea what they were doing so everyone thought killer was op. At that time, the game was massively unbalanced for the killer,window cheesing because there was no medium vault, holding shift would give you the fast vault even if you werent moving, infinites, 20s cooldown sprint burst which came back while running, selfcare with no slowdown, permanent saboing hooks. For a long time the devs were favoring the larger audience, survivors, and so that why it took so long to see nerfs for them to make the game more balanced. Survivors play the game and get used to the unbalance, aren't very good and rely on the broken mechanics to survive and when they are removed, they don't know how to play the game properly.
---
Bitter murmur
---
Tf are you on about? The old bt used to protect both people, so you could save against a camper, now you basically swap places if you’re solo and the killer is camping hard, how is that a buff sir?
---
I play killer a lot. 60/40 survivor and killer respectively. And like i said no one plays hook distance every game. Its rare to not be able to dribble to a hook. And you have like 2 seconds before they can hit the skill check and can dribble 3-4 times. You can almost always get them on a hook
---
I'm starting to think DBD has some weird meme trifecta of iCarly, Spongebob, and Rupaul
---
~~Now stop taking pictures of my closet~~
---
Not gonna lie, the Cannibal's mori used to be really fun to spam when you could cancel it right after the first strike with the hammer. You could smack them around for a bit if they reaaaaaally deserved it. But yeah, anything more than a few seconds is just toxic and potentially holding the game hostage if it's for a really long time.
---
who said anyone was afraid of the change???? it’s just a fucking stupid suggestion lmfao no one has said it was broken it’s just so oddly specific and completely unnecessary and the fact that you’re missing that point consistently is amazing. 
---
if you’re gonna claim a nerf to one of the most annoying perks in the game is not fair, maybe YOU shouldn’t be playing this game bud
---
there lies the balance, you can stop NOED from happening but by doing so you are chancing not getting all the gens done as quickly as you could have, imo that is a good balance, there is no need for a counter of totems if that was the case then NOED would probably never activate because survivors would slowly adapt to doing matches where all the totems are destroyed and gens get done. Maybe there should be a perk that gives you a Totem Counter? that way its up to the survivor if they wanna use up one of their 4 perk slots to have their totem counter that way the option is there but depending on survivor load outs it doesnt completely negate NOED being a perk at all.
---
It’s very situational yeah, It can still be useful but meh it was better before.
---
Shitpost flair not needed, this is Official
---
that was perhaps the funniest thing i've ever read, take my upvote sir
---
So what do ya want to talk about?  
---
Whatever you say, man.
---
**Tenacity XXIV**
---
There is nothing stopping you. 
---
Your ferocious tenacity in dire situations allows you to crawl **260**% faster and recover at the same time.
---
So if you are crawling, you move 2.31 meters per second, or at 63% the speed of running... and 6.5% faster than the speed of walking...
---
***You gotta love that tenacity.***
---
the fact that 9 times out of ten if i'm facing a huntress in low ranks she camps
---
Meme aside, Best to ya Reggie.
---
Are you saying sprint burst is good or bad? I'll assume good since the other is.
---
I agree with you. DS can be missed or denied by dribbling or the survivor could just be unlucky and go down right underneath a hook. Sure, NOED can be denied as well if all of the totems are gone... But too little survivors actually cleanse all 5 and too many times I’ve been hooked next to the NOED totem and the killer has just camped me to secure their single kill. My teammates are too scared to save me and they can’t cleanse the totem because it’s in view of the killer, so I often end up dying on my first hook to pretty unskilled killers.
---
rip reggie
---
No... It doesn't.
---
I’m kinda confused as how dying light will actually work anymore. 
---
If dying light is just gonna stop working the next time you get DS then what’s the point?
---
I dont use dying light because it’s a hard perk to pull off sometimes. You gotta find the obsession and tunnel them to hell. If you don’t find them early game then it’s a waste... now it won’t even be permanent 
---
If you are trying to say that survs are waiting until they have a safe fall back to start doing 'interesting' things then you just proved their point that they more concerned with having no consequences 
---
Best killer perks has to be Enduring
---
I think this change is good for a number of reasons:
---
1.) DS is no longer a "get out of screw-up free" card and now more of an anti-tunneling/camping perk with the right build.
---
2.) The full benefit of DS can now be used by all the survivors instead of just hoping you're the obsession.
---
3.) It's not up all the time until you use it. Meaning you can go the entire match without ever having to use it. 
---
This is probably the best change DS could have received that changed how annoying it was without making it useless. 
---
That would be freaking amazing, holy entity. 
---
F
---
Thats why we want to change it so that it wont be a useless perk sitting one of our perk pages.
---
There's 4 Infinites I can name right off the bat and 2 of them are on the same location.
---
1 is the haddonfield infinite and the other is the house on swamp. 
---
And the last 2 are on crotus prenn asylum with the 2 large buildings. The rectangle building and the round building.
---
Even with bloodlust tier 3 you'll never catch a survivor running it. I do it constantly on those maps and the gates are usually open by the time the killer knows what the fuck happened. You can't seriously sit here and tell me there's no such things as infinites. All you need is balanced landing. 
---
No one ever said BW and bloodlust was op you fucking tard.
---
too op, the killer has no possible way of ever picking you up
---
plz nerf devs lol
---
yea i think this is a good adjustment to the perk and maybe rank 10-20 killers may leave survivors on the ground for 60 seconds and not think twice about it but rank 1-9 or at the very least rank 1-5 killers know better than to waste 60 seconds lol 60 seconds in rank 1-5 or so  might as well be 15 minutes, so i don't see this being an issue in the expert ranks at all.
---
Tbh, I might slug, but *only* because I run STBFL. I'll let survivors go, I just want my extra stack first if I can hit them relatively quickly before I let them go.
---
You’re entitled to your own opinions of course, but it’d be a good suggestion. They made it harder to escape a killer’s grasp, so it should be harder for the killers to catch us. And there are A LOT of other annoying perks killers have that haven’t been nerfed which is why I said its unfair. 
---
Myers stalk will save you from the evil P3 Claudettes. Myers is also dumb fun and rewarding as hell.
---
People don't realise how little the reports actually do. People who cheat can get away with their shit for god knows how long and you are telling me they're gonna ban some random case?
---
good to get some quick clearance on that
---
T h e  b e e
---
Someone update me on the changes please? 
---
Not really. It’s actually going to get used a lot less now since it only works if the killer tunnels you. So if you go against a killer who doesn’t tunnel, you will probably never use the perk.
---
Yeah, I’m definitely in favor of a perk like bbq. I think there’s few perks they put in the game where now the devs are probably like “what the hell were we thinking?!” Lol.  Dying Light is one, another would be Insidious. I really do think Dying Light being left as is makes a perk not as bad. Still sucks for the one guy, but as soon as users start seeing their obsession change, hopefully they will learn to just not tunnel anyone further. I can’t see them reworking the perk to accommodate further tunneling, it really would go against what they are trying to do for the game.
---
That's not gonna happen. They're not going to make a killer ability that relies on survivors playing certain perks or forces the killer to play certain perks and an ability that changes the obsession is contrary to how killer abilities are designed 
---
Daveed
---
I don’t know... Not everyone runs BT, at least in a lot of my games (rank 5-8), and everyone seems too scared to even go for an unhook. Especially when the NOED totem is right next to the hooked survivor and the killer is camping.
---
I'd imagine that *if* they did that, the power would have a secondary effect regarding the Obsession.
---
&gt;every killer has the same hitbox
---
Am I the only one the think that this is wrong? Surely Hag and Freddy should have smaller hitboxes. It would buff them up both a bit, and I think this could be a really nice change.
---
It even states in-game if the killer is small, average or large. Perhaps that should affect hitboxes.... 
---
The animation makes it look like you're too much on his right, but it's just the animation of the character leaning on the left. A lot of the time I've swung right into the face of survivors and they didn't get hit because they dropped the palet and it completly cancels the hit. 
---
Yeah, thats why I didnt like it. I found the bird notifications more distracting than anything else
---
I saw Geistra's meltdown yesterday. I imagine everyone in that group except Jen herself is going to be sucking on sour grapes over the DS nerf. 
---
These "Content Creators" can't seem to handle it when patch notes don't go their way.
---
'Non-viable perk' my ass, small game is mandatory in all my builds. Fucks NOED, fucks ruin, fucks devour, and get a bonus against trapper and hag to boot. Quit being a baby and adapt.

The health of a 65 dollar controller will beg to differ with your opinion there chief. Even if I rotate it in circles constantly over time it ruins the controller faster by having to do so multiple times over the course of a fee hours. Compound that by days, weeks and months and it renders the analog stick useless. 3 of my team mates shouldn't be needed to help me off the killer. That's what iron grasp was intended for. To stop people from filling their meter and getting off. It was such a rewarding feeling being able to. Now it's just a waste of time and life out of my controller just to not go to the basement.
---
Like what? It would have to be useful somehow and I cannot conceive of a single way this would be useful on any level
---
And, again, it's not going to happen because it's perk reliant
---
0k can be a win and 4k can be a loss. Depends how you define winning.
---
I don't know, I didn't think much about it. 
---
I always get hit a couple of seconds BEFORE he goes back into tier 2... Yeah, I’m pretty unlucky.
---
Smells like rank 20 in here, yeah.
---
Dead By Daylight, with ranking systems more fair and balanced than fox news
---
The basement is one of the most fundamentally broken parts of this game and I've said that since day one. It shocks me that nothing has been done to them, but the usual argument for it is that Killers have such a rough time that the basement is kind of all they have going for them? Personally I don't think balancing one issue by making another solves anything. Just makes a cheesy unfun experience.
---
Though it probably shouldn't be a huge surprise with some of the maps in this game. The Thompson House is one of the biggest culprits I think.
---
Would it really be that big of a deal to just make two entrances into the basement? Maybe the second one is a secret entrance that needs to be opened by the survivors from the top, and it requires a short amount of time to do so. A key could let you open it instantly, or a toolbox could let you break it open faster.
---
Either way, there is nothing you can do to save a Survivor once they are in the basement as long as the killer remains within 20 to 30 m of the basement entrance. Incredibly lame gameplay.
---
Freddy is the worst killer in the game
---
There is a visual bug my brother and I have both encountered on Xbox 1 playing survivor. When unhooked it still appears like we are hanging in mid air(it still looks like we are hooked), I've had it happen to me and to the survivors I'm playing with on multiple accounts. I've never purposefully tried to recreate it, it seems to happen pretty often.
---
Or perhaps this killers power always creates an obsession every game like when the killer brings an obsession perk?  Is it likely? No. But is it possible? Definitely.

was being a gen jockey then someone dies on hook, then someone is hooked for the 2nd time, "okay i'll just finish this gen..." killer finds other survivor &amp; knocks'em down when they where going for the save at about 10%, "huh... hatch it is"(this was their first hook btw(&amp; they didn't want to die)). i wait for both of 'em to die(couldn't even make it to the first guy if i tried) got to the hatch then stood with the huntress for about 5-10 mins. after i got out i found out that all the survs remained &amp; i got to feed of the salt.

I was gonna ask if you had tried killer lol i usually hop on it after like 15 mins

I demand a Michael Jackson cosmetic for The Huntress now.
---
I almost never see streamers using NOED. Whereas shitloads of people use DS. 
---
Or the perk works like normal and you kill your obsession,  it activates,  then stays active regardless of if someone d strikes you or not.  
---
Why does everyone assume it will inactivate? 
---
So what you are saying is that every match in DbD has a finite amount of 'fun' in it and the game is really just trying to snatch up as much of said 'fun' from the opposing player as you can before the match ends. Interesting concept. 
---
yea i can't understand how anyone can say the killers are getting all the advantages lol up until  about 6 months ago this game was extremely survivor sided and then the devs started making changes to balance it out so they made changes that helped the killers, they didn't make these changes to make the killers have the better advantage they did it balance it out and imo as a Survivor Main myself it still is not balanced enough for the killers, it is far to easy to gen rush killers even if the killer runs ruin and stuff it still is far to easy to gen rush and to loop a killer for several minutes if they don't give up and move on to another survivor. Before people start attacking my comment here and calling me a salty killer main, i play survivor 90% of the time and really only play killer when doing daily rituals and i am not saying that all killers get their butts kicked that is not what i am saying at all, i still get 4ks here and there but when you get down to rank 1-5 or so not only do all these killers pretty much HAVE to run ruin to buy themselves even a couple minutes but they end up having to waste other perk slots with other things to slow up gen progression because 9/10 your ruin totem is destroyed in the first few minutes of the game and because of how fast gens get done most killers have to run NOED as well to even have a chance at getting 1 or 2k, there is a reason that when you get down to rank 1-5 as a survivor that 9 out of 10 matches the killer has RUIN AND NOED and it isn't because 9/10 rank 1-5 killers suck and need to git gud it is because the game is unbalanced and without running RUIN and/or NOED then their chances at 3 or 4k are slim. I mostly play solo queue with people i am not in party chat with and we still are able to finish our objectives way too quickly, and when i got in with a 2, 3 or 4 man swf fugetaboutit! so people saying the killer's are getting all the advantages are full of it, us survivors are actually quite OP now adays and if we didn't have stuff like the building in crotus prenn asylum and so man pallets or if Hex Totems took longer to destroy or had overcharge type skill checks then we would get our butts kicked more often but as it is right now in the game we have it way to easy as survivors. Come on Devs make this game intense again, give me a reason to worry when i play survivor. I mean unless there is a face camping killer then even getting hooked 2x doesn't worry anyone, Hell even if you do have a face camper and the gates are open you don't really have anything to worry about unless its a leatherface.....I am fine with the stuff that is "buffing" the killers because I want a challenge, i want to be scared, i want to be worried about being able to escape. Survivors are so bold cuz you can literally run up to a killer let them hit you and as long as you are close to a jungle gym or the killer shack then you can still waste about 5 minutes or so of the killers time looping them if you do it right. anyways sorry for rambling but as a survivor main i am all for the difficulty of surviving getting harder. bring it on! :)
---
P.S. : I Know there will be at least 1 or 2 DBD Masters that will reply saying that "THEY ARE SO GOOD THEY DON'T NEED TO RUN RUIN AND NOED AT THE GOOD RANKS TO WIN AND THAT ANY KILLER THAT DOES IS JUST USING THEM AS A CRUTCH AND NEEDS TO JUST GET BETTER AT THE GAME" YADA YADA YADA, ok we get it there are some of you that are just THE BEST in the world at killing in this game and we all should bow at your feet....smh.
---
Maybe we were all the Feng Min... 
---
Plus small game. 
---
Not necessarily, Your obsession might be dead on next hook, while the new obsession has only been hooked once.
---
Here some situations:
---
1) In most cases you probably want to tunnel the obsession to activate DL, it works. But if at least one of the remaining survivors has DS, a living survivor can become the new obsession thus deactivating DL.
---
2) If you try hooking different people to waste their DS before you kill the last obsession you will waste too much time and might berely get any use out of it at the end. People might also save their DS for after a second hook.
---
The most optimal way to use dying light with new DS would be to tunnel the obsession, while NOT tunneling the others. (Hook and leave or hook and slug).
---
Anyone beside the obsession will be hooked once then ignored for 60s or slugged so that you don't get a new obsession. This really is an anti-tunneling perk except if you are the obsession.
---
It might also promote more slugging if the 60 second timer can be waited out when they are dying. We might even see deer stalker more.
---
ok you are an awesome person lol :)
---
Weird. I’ve never ended up with less than a 3k when running tombstone or tombstone piece. Same with all the Myers I’ve played against who ran it.
---
Yes, the bee itself.
---
I still don't see what the use could be
---
Had to retire after the saw the abysmal graphics on the dead by daylight switch trailer
---
That’s not tall grass, that’s Claudette.
---
Weird.
---
Legion. I don’t think I’ve ever survived.
---
Because they said it themselves: 
---
If you get chased for like 45 seconds after getting unhooked, why shouldn't the killer just wait 15 seconds or so just to make sure? 
---
The thing is if I have decisive strike, I want to use it. No point trying my hardest to loop the killer for over a minute when I could loop him for half a minute, then stun him with DS and gain some more distance. It only makes sense. 
---
But with this update it's like you HAVE to basically kill yourself in order to use it but even then the killer can just assume you have it since you're killing yourself.
---
They either need to raise the time that it's active to infinite or 80/100/120 seconds. OR simply have it so if you get downed &lt;40/60/80 seconds after getting unhooked, it's activated permanently. 
---
&gt; Enduring already make the perk laughable before
---
Yeah and now it's a 3 seconds stun at max level, it's literally not going to phase the killer whatsoever. 
---
This perk has simply become a counter to dumb killers that just facecamp. But even it's like... borrowed time man... that's what that is there for. 
---
It was originally supposed to show that the people in the community everyone looks up to, isn't always right. I would've had more clips at the starts of popular figures in the DBD community claiming that The Legion was extremely weak, or even "the worst killer in the game".
---
I guess my timing was WAY off though...
---
The only reason Myers gets tier three early on in the game is because of survivors, so... yeah.
---
Also know what I'm thinking, knock out might actually become meta perk, just slugging people. Tried this build few times and had a great success with it, most of the time you get 3k-4k, as survivors just run around search for others, instead of doing gens.
---
But you don’t have to leave every survivor on the ground for 60 seconds, this is only in cases where the person is immediately downed upon getting unhooked. There’s going to be a lot of instances where someone is tunneled, but had a little distance to delay getting downed, and ends up getting screwed out of the perk. I think that’s the part of this perk change that is stupid.
---
Playing solo? I get tunneled no matter what. It's kind of great 
---
The ultimate second chance build, you can escape every situation by yourself
---
Not sure why I need a -5 for trying to understand their wording but thanks guys :D
---
I agree about DS but NOED doesn't win games. NOED gets 1 kill, if it activates, and if you happen to be in a chase and secure the kill after they've been hooked, I can only justify running NOED on freddy since most other killers don't make it to endgame plus I run RM on freddy for an endgame punish build. Haunted Ground punishes survivors for doing what they're supposed to do, in almost exactly the same way as NOED. Except with NOED, there's an easy counter. Just leave. I get if you're in a chase or get unlucky and are the first person found but okay, lets say the situation works out and you get 1 kill. Congrats, you used a situationally powerful perk. HG could've done the exact same. DS however rewards something that happens no matter what, you will get chased in a match and probably downed. Tbh, current DS is p much like Huntress running Instahatchets every match, and the fix looks like a weird, uncomfortable solution that ruins rancor and messes with a ton of other perks and addons and ugh, idk, just wish they'd rework it in a less silly convoluted way. I'd be okay with a NOED rework it just doesnt seem neccesary, its already been reworked and is a situationally powerful perk that has a number of counters.
---
Can't wait for this indirect rancor buff, because yeah, that free kill perk needs to work on more than one person
---
I've only seen it affect gens, it might affect healing too, but other than that I'm not sure.
---
Killers dont know if you have the perk. They waste time still if slugging. But you running them and it still runs out is bad. I think the timer for it needs to be just a bit longer. Like 15 more secs each tier. Also not sure how i feel about the shorter stun timer since sometimes the nearest pallet/window after a stun is like 5 football fields away.
---
&gt; I would want "diversity" of the perk metagame to stem from them all doing worthwhile things, not from all being more or less equally underwhelming. 
---
Yup. Ideally this is true. Unfortunately theres always a number cruncher somewhere that comes up with the best or most efficient build which leads to the top 10 perk pool situation again. I dont think theres a way to make every perk (or even a large number of perks) viable, especially since theres so many.
---
Any female character 💦
---
OK, I know my flair is "just another rank 20 claudette main" but because of this post I think you're more deserving of the title. Well done, you've earned it. 
---
Wow, you should get that framed. That's gorgeous. 
---
Ds and noed are both in my opinion not the strongest perk anyway
---
For survivor, I think its tied between "left behind" and "no one left behind" for weakest. I think strongest perk may be balanced landing
---
For killer, I think weakest perk may be play with your food, while strongest is bbq and chili (just cause it's consistent and provides good benefits)
---
Perhaps if they made it so if you’re downed within 60 seconds, DS would be active, and not if you’re picked up within 60 seconds. 
---
Haven't played dbd in a long time but am still subbed. Had to do a bit of research to get wtf was going on here.  I am glad i did. 
---
Man, remember me is going to be garbage if the stacks get reset when the obsession changes. If it doesn't reset, it may become better for getting more stacks of you killed your obsession too early 
---
&gt;2.1%  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Everyone
---
:Thinking:
---
That’s not tall grass, that’s Claudette
---
I have, for 5 years actually. 
---
i had wglf and am very altruistic, died by noed but hey ya gurl got 170k nevertheless. 
---
watch killers start juggling every single survivor now rofl
---
I just think noed shouldnt also give the haste. The exposed is strong enough. That said the only times I can think of it being too strong is when the doors spawn too close together or the totem is somewhere very hidden. One person could look the killer while the doors are being opened but 4% haste makes that quite a bit harder 
---
Oh shit, I almost forgot every single person who plays DBD does so on PS4! Silly me🤦🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
---
So no argument then 
---
I was running it a lot when I first started playing killer and wasn't very good and didnt have too many options. My issue with it is that I simply want a perk that has an effect during the first 5 gens. With NOED I can maybe get one more kill, but it doesn't promote the type of gameplay where you try and improve. Unless I'm doing the blood warden, and NOED troll, then fuck you survivors :P hahahahahah
---
The description says it affects repair, healing and sabotage speed. I'm not sure, but I don't think mending etc. are counted as healing since other things like medkits don't work with that, so it probably doesn't affect those.
---
Freddy does have a smaller hit box that is why his lunges seem so stupidly fast around corners and stuff. And why the hits always seem like they shouldn't hit but do.
---
I genuinely think Jen is good at the game, the problem is she's suffering from severe burnout like so many other people so she does things to "spice up" her stream.
---
Unfortunately this typically means making life as miserable as possible for the killer with her squad because that's what the crowd wants to see. 
---
The rest of them are really nothing special. Honestly the entirety of DbD streamers really suffer from 'big fish in a small pond' syndrome. I see the same thing happen when I worked security for the convention circuit. People get huge egos because within a super niche circle they're well known, but outside of that they'd be literal nobodies. 
---
Absolutely. Lower the timer significantly, like 30 seconds or even a little less, but make it so the clock stops on chase. Now it is truly a tunnel counter. The way it is now, it only comes into play if you aren’t good in chases or the killer is right at the hook and instantly downs you. 
---
Since they nerfed DS they may just delete the game off of every platform
---
Had a game where 3 of us popped one and I was killer, maxed out everyone's chase and stuff then had to get them sacrafices
---
Yeah and that's how the game was meant to be played. The way you put it was just shitty dude. That's all. 
---
Maybe stay outta his line of sight?
---
So I need to invest into a perk as a killer to ensure that when I down someone they can go on a hook?  I'm sorry that you don't get your 'rewarding feeling' of getting a free escape,  sorry not free, you had to invest all that analog stick rotation into it.  If you found that rewarding, God alone knows how rewarding hitting the DS SC is for you.  Then all the gen checks as well... it must be orgasmic.
---
Never stand in the open against a billy after a hook. Especially not on rotten fields. 9/10 times he got bbq lol
---
At least killers no longer have to worry about killing an obsession too early before getting maximum stacks of remember me... then again, having someone DS at the endgame and suddenly have the power to open gates at a normal rate will be irritating. 
---
Its annoying, but not game breaking and there are ways around it. I stand by my statement that bad killers that can't adapt complain about it. Im a killer main and DS dont bother me at all. 
---
rank 14 im not that good lmao
---
Who’s  mich mayors
---
Ok.
---
Did I accidentally make a joke?
---
I played against a swf while my friend watched them on twitch. (I asked her not to tell me what was going on). Since I knew they were swf and would rather waste time than do gens I hooked the streamer and would fake out the guy who thought he was “tanking” by running dead hard, object of obsession, and a few other perks for him to be a distraction. 
---
I simply ignored his flashlight clicks because if he wasn’t doing gens he wasn’t worth my time. I killed his friends and girlfriend first before killing him and my friend who was watching told me after that I started a legit fight between him and his girlfriend when she was screaming at him because he didn’t help her.
---
I was wraith btw.
---
As hag, I yoinked someone off the hatch after killing her friends.  
---
*The Entity is especially amused by hatch interrupts*
---
yes
---
Fuck. Now I want the bee as a killer. It would make so much sense, they could change their handles to beehav10ur for a bit and it would distract us from the shitty hitboxes
---
It rarely bothers me too but I can agree that it's a BS perk and I'm very happy with the changes. I might even use it myself now that it's not a crutch perk. 
---
Honestly they should just get rid of one of the effects 
---
Yeah totally fair, 4% doesn't really do anything noticable for me most of the time but thats a reasonable nerf I think nobody would have a problem with. My one question would be, "why level it?" Or like, what will the levelling thing be? Maybe an increased TR once gates are open? Then level 1 2 and 3 will have increased or decreased depending on whats seen as better?
---
no im actually the best dbd player 
---
ty senpai
---
Hmm I thought I did that multiple times....maybe it didnt Register 
---
just checked, I already have it
---
git gud
---
understandable, however this killer was a camper and tunneler. obviously didn't care much for points, just sacrifices. 
---
I feel like the lantern to the moths when I realize I'm with a team of Davids using WGLF. Go into the [light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYk56jemsbU) after you've done a gen...plz.
---
i been done that
---
You're taking shit way out of context but I wouldn't expect much else on this sub Reddit to be honest. It seems that the majority of the people here live in some fantasy land where if you don't agree with the noobs or their hyperbole they mass downvote you without even reading what was said. They all jump on the popular opinion bandwagon for those "cool" points instead of thinking for themselves.
---
It depends on how fast you wanna move while crouching. 
---
Oh man I wanna upvote your comment but it's at 69 right now, I'm sorry.. I can't.
---
Don't look at Twitter then.
---
And I have too. But like I said, you can't tell what your team is doing. So if you can't find one for whatever reason, you either just have to really hope your team cleansed it or just have to take the risk. It feels pretty shitty to get 4 totems and be unable to find the last one, so you assume your team got it just to get insta downed because of NOED. 
---
Placing my bets on adrenaline. 
---
That said. Sometimes perks to lose you games. Calm spirit shits on doctor, self care is particularly useful against freddy, etc. But those are all situational, ds was too universal is the issue. 
---
On the other hand though, it's not like ds would completely ruin a game. A bad survivor would just go down a few seconds later. Especially if the killer ran enduring. And there was counter play, such as dribbling or slugging. 
---
All in all, I dont really see dead by daylight as an overly competitive game. I just wish that there was a point somewhere on the balance scale where everyone would agree the game is "fun" and a single perk doesnt ruin it. 
---
That was my reaction lol to think he is saying killer is easy but yet BBQ, which got a nerf in that you can jump in a locker now, is op haha.
---
Yeah best advice is to try and stay out of his line of sight and when doing gens to keep turning the camera round. You'll probably shit yourself cause you'll spin the camera round, he isn't there, you'll spin it back round and he's looking right at you haha 
---
Myers can be frustrating but he's the only killer IMO that keeps the game scary. 
---
Nope. Chainsaw. On his foot 
---
You on xbox?
---
I thought we could have a discussion and then you throw in a smug comment at the end, bravo elite player.Never said anything about my totem knowledge, but if it makes you feel better mention it all you like.
---
Now for your other comments:
---
 Counters Trapper and Hag: On the Trapper part his traps are rately an issue, for Hag, well i gotta say kindly you are delusional, knowing traps helps little if you don't have a flashlight to rid of it bud, it will stay there for the next guy to trip it and in a chase your choice is to try and ignore the trapped area, and if the Hag is half competent that trap would be on a vital loop, so ignoring it is almost as good as the trap having worked already.This can also work in the Trapper scenario but not as often since you could have disarmed them.
---
okay i am old as shit and not in the "know" could someone please educate me what all this "bee" stuff is?
---
I'm sorry, what? I don't know how you made the jump from what I said to that conclusion.
---
Anyone else suspicious that the real reason they are making this change to DS is because the next killer is gonna have some seriously nasty obsession perks? Perks that will make you want the obsession title to jump to other survivors asap? Or perhaps the new survivor has an obsession perk that is godlike and you don't want others taking the obsession status from you? 
---
Just speculating, but I have this nagging feeling that this is likely the case.
---
Never heard of her.  
---
Play Nea Karlson
---
This is incorrect imo, Pig should be at least two ranks up
---
I mainly didn't want DS or NOED just because talking about them is kinda boring.
---
I won’t. My gripe with it before was it changed the entire dynamic of my gameplay. I hated slugging, dribbling or losing the hook. at least I can get my BBQ stack now.
---
I used to use d strike, haven't in a long time unless I'm lvling a new surv up...um, this almost seems like a buff? Idk I'm super curious to see how this plays out. As killer I'd find it annoying that I have to slug or risk picking up every surv up now only to get surprise d strike. Guess we'll see!
---
Thano-Stop-Hobia how does a Thano Stop Hobia and wtf is HOBIA? lol seriously though cool post :) love it.
---
&gt;That’s not tall grass, that’s Claudette
---
Hang on. How does this affect slugging? There is the countdown of 60 seconds, but does it keep going down even in the down state? If it does, this isn't going to really solve tunnelling. Instead it will make it worse because smart killers will tunnel, then slug the unhooked survivor for a minute before trying to pick them up. Although that may introduce no mither as an actual meta perk now.
---
Don't get me wrong though, the new DS looks like a viable anti-tunneling perk with downsides to consider (Rankor)
---
I might consider running it now.
---
nope PC
---
I'll let you know how many tears it causes. 
---
&gt; Clown's tonic isn't even that great against DS. Just run enduring instead on whatever killer you want. 
---
&gt; Source: I main clown.
---
# Source: I main clown.
---
Claims to be a Clown main. Doesn't realize that you can just throw down a tonic on top of the DS user, pick them up, wait in the gas cloud, and with Enduring pretty much 100% counters the perk unless there is a pallet or window within 10 meters. 
---
Face palm. 
---
Pretty sure the only people that are salty about it are the people that relied on it. I think majority of survivors are apathetic about it.
---
When a tier 3 Michael has been in tier 3 for 5 minutes and you are still holding out hope that it might end.
---
Well great, now every match is gonna be all four survivors falling dead instantly
---
You almost made me spit out my drink
---
Slugging isn't a waste of time. 2+ people aren't doing generators, it gives you a lot of map pressure. 
---
It shouldn't go down while in the killer's terror radius, that way even if you manage to drop the chase you aren't getting punished for playing well.
---
Yes balance is needed.
---
The flashlight nerf was necessary and the hag rework as well. 
---
Meanwhile major Surv-sided problems are completely ignored.
---
Fair enough, in the sense that it would indeed be a challenge to make a perk like, say, Iron Will (which is actually a fine perk in its own right) actually-equally as impactful as something like Balanced Landing.
---
Still, there are a bunch of just awfully subpar perks, and a variety of rather obvious and simple improvements that could be made to both them and other more mediocre perks, to make them, if not meta-tier, at least something you see in "competitive" play more often.
---
Iron Will for example could also apply in Dying State, as well as suppress the noises made upon landing from a fall.
---
It will only be ~0.5 seconds shorter if the amount it’s reduced by doesn’t change 
---
And that is exactly why I stay still or slowly walk away as opposed to run when I see the killer. 
---
Wasn't NOED originally a timer based perk? I wasn't around when it was but I'd be curious to hear why it got changed back then.
---
Don't move and a Meg won't loop you.
---
Yeah they kind of killed D-strike...At this point I feel like it’s a mediocre Borrowed Time
---
You must not be a killer main/decent killer at all.  It's 100% opinion. You could argue with his power, disadvantages, etc make him bottom tier.. but in the right hands with the right add ons, play style, and skill he's great.  I honestly consider Freddy a B tier with my play style and I've steamrolled SWF groups of all caliber. How we look at him is different and all opinion based. I'm just telling you he's great in my hands and an absolute nightmare ( get it? ) in the hands of killers who put me to complete shame. Elites absolutely wreck with him.   
---
Best perk for Michael.
---
I agree BT is way better. People are selfish solo and I see them still using DS over BT.
---
It  runs out while you are in chase. You get punished for playing well and running the killer around. It is not a good anti-tunneling perk.
---
Has it been confirmed yet how the new DS rework will affect other obsession based perks like dying light or rancor? Even if rancor does re-activate when DS is used that is very situational as the gens have to be done, you would of needed to kill your obsession, then hook the DS user, they then need to be saved, then you need to down them and they hit DS for rancor to activate and all the while survivors just need to open the gates. I can't see this issue coming up that often other then the killer can now gamble and kill the obsession early in the game, ds is used and creates new obsession so by endgame the killer can mori the new obsession.   
---
As for NOED it's a poop perk but it wasn't as bad as DS. If people actually destroy totems it it easy to avoid, you can also leave a dull in an obvious place and destroy the others so if NOED pops your chances of locating it are better. On top of that you also have a few perks to help locate the totems. 
---
Hi, I'm also autistic. Don't have a problem with the joke. If you do, fine. 
---
Other survivors need to do the same thing. Start running perks that allow you to move faster while crouched. Do generators while behind an object. Keep spinning your camera to keep an eye on your surroundings. There's ways to beat any killer. 
---
yep, you are definitley biased.
---
Multiple Dead hards in a chase? sure thing.
---
Dude the clown gets THE SUCK!
---
Well they did back when swf could see the killer's perks. ;-P
---
Healing just seems important to me because teammates are unreliable and it gives you a second chance with the killer
---
"After the gates are powered the killer clicks their fingers and half of the remaining survivors are instantly sacrificed (rounded up)."
---
And you thought NOED was bad!
---
Quick and quiet saved my ass so many times, what a hell are you talking about? Killer not knowing you fast vault is one of the most useful thing. You just have to know how to use the perk.
---
Insofar as it's clearly meant to be an anti-tunnel perk now, I think it should be 30 secs but freeze in chase or when downed. If you get tunneled off the hook you really shouldn't lose it just because the tunneling lasted longer than minute.
---
At the same time, if you get unhooked and I leave and come back a full 60 seconds later and you're *still* dicking around at the hook? That's not tunneling. You just got found a second time, had plenty of time to get away.
---
A lot of people here on Reddit have been playing the game on PC a whole year before it even came to playstation 4, meaning that despite the 2.6% chance of getting the trophy, most people here have already played so many matches for so long, they likely already have it.
---
youre actually really helpful compared to some of these other comments thank you
---
r/alwaysexpectedthanosatthispoint
---
I only found DS to be “unfair” when non-obsession could use it. If I down the obsession near a hook, dribble. If not, just slug.  It doesn’t always work but that’s just how it goes.
---
can i buy one of these from you? my daughter loves this picture she is 9 and is my little horror buddy :) she asked a mall santa for all the chucky movies when she was 4! :) her last 2 birthday cakes were a Sackhead Jason Cake for her 8th bday and a Huntress cake for her 9th birthday :) the huntress cake actually got shown during a dead by daylight live stream back in october or november :)
---
If my preset is still there (it gets deleted every once in a while for some reason), it's not much. I just adjust contrast, vibrance, brightness, that kind of stuff. No actual 'filters' are used, but there are some cool ones available :)
---
*Strongest*
---
Killer: BBQ &amp; Chili
---
reasons: practical use, helps every killer regardless of skill level/character, helps reduce the grind, rewards active playstyles.
---
Survivor: Self Care
---
reasons: useful application no matter the killer/surv playstyle, allows greater independence for individuals in the team.
---
*Weakest*
---
Killer: Beast of Prey
---
reason: it's a perk that only activates during a chase but fails to aid in said chase
---
Survivor: No Mither
---
reason: this perk puts a target on the user since they're already softened, the indicator makes it so obvious that no killer in their right mind will slug, making the perks *ONE* benefit redundant.
---
For me it’s basically gone. I try not to tunnel in the first place already so this will stop me from catching some prick just for them to disappear in a jungle gym after their strike. Though body lock your savior after getting unhooked could be thing but someone with borrowed time could already do that.
---
It was changed because survs cried about it
---
so every single little league team should get a trophy even if they didn't win?
---
It’s funny how the devs literally said in the post that DS and NOED weren’t comparable. But people continue on with this argument as if it is.
---
I don't know the times for everything but putting it that way it does sound pointless. I play both sides but I mainly play killer. But I'm still gonna take self care cause of teammates
---
The way you pointed it out lol. You act as if survivors are totally screwed just because very powerful, arguably OP, perks were nerfed, when they're really not. In my games, I usually end up with the killer only getting 2, maybe 3 kills, which seems fair. You can't expect everyone to survive. 
---
Yes it has. They broke down how the new DS affects both survivor and killer obsession perks
---
Its a little better than DBD. At least you can actually fight back. Only downside is that you can be killed at any moment.
---
Completely agree with that, or a much shorter timer but it stops in chase. As it is now, it’s a situational perk (requires tunneling) that requires a specific situation of that situation! (downed relatively quickly so killer has to pick you up)
---
If you are tunneled off the unhook, but manage to reach a pallet....the odds of you actually getting to use your “anti-tunneling” perk go way down. I just think that’s kinda dumb
---
Alexa play despacito
---
Claudette because she's covered in moss and moisture from studying plants
---
The only thing I'm still on the fence about regarding the changes is the final point and becoming the obsession after successfully using it. 
---
Do you understand that I'm not complaining about the changes, right?
---
The post is about BIAS: Killer-mains problems are currently being fixed, meanwhile survivor-mains problems are utterly ignored.  As I stated in the title " **DS nerf isn't the problem, bias is the problem.** "
---
His lunge hitbox is larger than the actual model so that it can have a normal lunge distance. Yes it looks like it shouldn't hit due to sizes but it is a standard lunge distance.
---
There's nothing free about it. Apparently you're new to the game. It was a race to get off or get hooked. Beating your opponent is rewarding. It must suck being you where assuming everything that anyone says must mean they want free shit. Fuck all the way off soy boy.
---
They both exert the same energy
---
Congratulations on using logic and facts to prove your point. 
---
Awesome.
---
Not sure if you knew this, but there’s plenty of other perks you can choose from. If you relied on one perk this hard for this long after it was announced months ago it was getting changed, that’s your own fault.
---
I don’t think we’ll be seeing a ton of people run DS anymore (I don’t and never really did except for adept Laurie), but in the bright side, those that do get tunneled right off the hook (by a camper or otherwise) at least have a chance if they are running it. I’ll probably try it in a few games while it’s on the PTB before I make any official decisions on whether or not I love it lol.
---
Better times, now
---
*THANK YOU*
---
But now you dont know if they have DS. We probably not gonna remember to use the tonic before picking a survivor. It is safer to use enduring tho.
---
imo id go for spirit, i really like her power and her perks are pretty good imo, spirit fury is my favorite perk for her when paired up with enduring.
---
You can argue as much as you like that NOED is balanced and has easy counterplay but that doesn’t solve the issue. Also, assuming you play killer mostly, even if a hook is nearby and you knocked down the obsession, are you happy about dribbling them? Even if you know there is only a chance that they have DS? I don’t think so. And say they do go to cleanse a totem even if it is one person. Another is presumably in a chase and the other two are in gens. You have lost one player from cleansing the totem and you have lost another from the chase. With the main objective to do gens and do them fast, the longer you take the better the killer will do. That is why Ruin is so effective, because it can slow the game down long enough for the killer to make a big impact. Losing one person from generator progress to cleansing every totem because there is the possibility that the killer might have NOED. I was not relating DS and NOED’s ‘solutions’ for them both being game exploits. I was comparing them because they both waste valuable time for either killer or survivor. Finally, my suggestion shouldn’t effect you, assuming you use NOED often, if you actually are doing well already. To follow a previous analogy you have used about a life vest, the life vest is helping the swimmer win the race even if they can’t stay afloat. Why should NOED make you win the game if you only hit people once throughout the whole thing?
---
DS and NOED aren't even the strongest perks tho.
---
Killer
---
Strongest: BBQ and Chili (even Ruin, Bamboozle, Enduring, Spirit Fury, and Sloppy Butcher are better than NOED)
---
Weakest: Any of the 25% of perks that are trash, like, idk, Hangman's Trick or Fire Up or Monstrous Shrine.
---
Survivor
---
Strongest: Balanced Landing (probably only perk I hate playing against more than DS, very strong and on some maps it's basically gg from the start if they have balanced. Sprint Burst is also a strong option, for the number of stealth killers it negates)
---
Weakest: Again, any number or basically useless perks. Wake Up and Technician come to mind.
---
But this isn't a bias issue. You compared too entirely unequivocal things. And not only that, but the stuff on the left was fixing dev bias while the stuff on the right has nothing to do with the devs. Expecting them to fix broken things **they** put in the game is fine. Expecting them to fix individual player behavior is absurd
---
All this salt from these crutch DS players is so satisfying,
---
Rancor you might have a point with. If they changed DS because it was felt that there was no killer counter play then Rancor would be the same for survs. 
---
NOED an DS though are nothing alike, people who say that need to learn to cleanse totems. NOED has plenty of counter play, and also only takes effect at the end of the match. NOED would be less powerful if ppl just left instead of being overly altruistic. 
---
The DS skill check will be larger now, so i dont think unnerving presence will be effective.
---
Sorry I keep forgetting your a God at this game, who lasts for 4 gens in a chase as survivor and then gets a 4-man 5-gen as killer.  I wonder what would happen if we pitted a team of you against yourself?   Alas, we can never know...  
---
I do find it odd however that you continue to decry a nerf to a perk that you never get to use, because obviously there is always a hook nearby that you get put on before you can use it.  Infact, why is this perk ever taken, if it can't ever be used, and why would anyone be upset about a nerf to such a useless perk?  Intriguing...
---
My mortal tongue cannot begin to pronounce that.
---
The hag now can place traps mid-chase, specially during palletloops. 
---
It made her a viable killer instead of useless one (she was Freedy-tier back then, I'd say she is a Trapper/Clown-tier now).  
---
They're devs, they created they game. They don't realize anything is broken till we harp on it. Just because they don't consider them to be the same doesn't mean we should shut up. NOED os close yo being balanced but it needs a final push must like DS did. 
---
Yeah, I played it a bit in the past. Wasn't the biggest fan of it, but then I didn't really give it that much of a chance. 
---
I feel like small game should add a totem counter aha 
---
Spies is the worst??? Fight me bro, that shit is disgustingly good on Spirit, Nurse, and Huntress.
---
Killer powers are 100% individual opinion and experience. Even though Nurse is the best, if you gave her to a Hillbilly main who's never touched her, I'd doubt they'd do well. Likewise, Freddy, Wraith, and Leatherface are all decently strong Killers who often get derided as weak or ineffective because few people learn how to play them.
---
IMO, and this is 100% opinion, I'd say Pig is worse than Freddy. 
---
Freddy can use his power to see auras, slow down the game, and keep pressure on multiple Survivors at a time thanks to knowing their exact locations. It also allows him to secure a 4k if he wants to, since he just needs to sleep both Survivors until he has the both asleep at the same time. Dream Demon is useful as long as he has someone asleep, sure he suffers if he can't find anyone, but EVERY Killer does. In fact he's better equipped to FIND Survivors than most by virtue of his small lullaby and invisibility.
---
Meanwhile Pig's power is divided into a nearly useless surprise attack (thanks to Premonition, Spine Chill, and Sprint Burst) that can be used to mindgame certain loops, and a power that has a chance to help her establish pressure if she was already doing well anyway (it's a toss up whether Survivors can find the key in the first box and you have to down them first). Her power does very little to help her except at the end game and even that can be countered if the Survivors are not altruistic or let a trapped Survivor get the Hatch.
---
To put it simply and shortly; Freddy requires you to have multiple people asleep at any given moment. Alternatively, if you have a short dream transition, you can build and keep up pressure without having multiple people asleep, but his goal is to have 2+ asleep at any given time. If you can do that, generally you'll do well with Freddy.
---
Isn't this noob3..? Link to actual vid?
---
But BBQ can be figured out during the game if you are smart and pay attention. It rewards survivors for noticing details. NOED has no such indication during normal play. 
---
That's not what asymmetrical means. At all. Asymmetrical implies only the 1v4 aspect of the game. The goal of the devs SHOULD BE to balance the game so the advantages the killer has over a single survivor are mitigated by the advantages of having four survivors in play. Obviously the killer should be stronger than one single survivor.
---
A killer can be powerful without being broken, and survivors can have strong tools without being oppressive. Taking all the tools away from a survivor while consistently buffing killers isn't justified by "lol but killer should be stronger." There needs to be a balance.
---
TLDR: 27 killer buffs over the last year vs 10 to survivors. 
---
Instead, over the last year or so, we've had:
---
Faster killer animations across the board (pick up speed, power use times
---
Killer add-on reworks, namely clown, hag, and trapper, to make them more effective
---
Hiding killer perks until the game ends (which is absolutely fair)
---
Heavy reduction in pallet numbers (twice)
---
Borrowed time nerf, removing almost all functionality against camping killers (the whole point of the perk)
---
Reduced light burn stun
---
Map adjustments to eliminate infinites (fair), create more distance between objects, and increase hook spawns
---
Buffed stun reduction to balanced landing (survivor favored)
---
Hook auras are now always revealed when carrying a survivor
---
Exhaustion no longer works while running, limiting survivors to one perk usage even in very long chases
---
Buffs to several previously useless perks, and brutal strength. Of the buffed perks, only BS and bitter murmur are useful. Tinkerer received a rework that makes it useful on every killer, regardless of add-ons
---
Trapper and hag global buffs, making them more viable killers overall
---
Second nerf to brand new part, solidly reducing it from very rare quality to uncommon, with no change in rarity or cost.
---
Buff to tier 1 Myers move and carry speed, mainly affecting scratched mirror Myers
---
Nerf to babushka huntress, 33% slower hatchet throws overall (survivor favored)
---
More map reworks, with the primary purpose of removing jungle gyms and pallets that were "too close"
---
Added more lockers (lol)
---
Sped up pallet drop animation (survivor favored, later removed and applied only to stationary drops)
---
Temporary invulnerability for an unhooked survivor (survivor favored when the killer is playing poorly)
---
Bloodlust speed boost nerf (survivor favored)
---
Wraith add-on rework and general buffs
---
Increased lunge speed for slower killers
---
Shortened animations for killer interrupts on vaults and grabs
---
Buff to spirit's power charge time
---
Sped up hook animation time
---
Reduced chances for a survivor to spawn too close to a killer (indirect survivor buff)
---
Changed fast vaults to severely restrict the angles at which a fast vault are possible
---
Reworked totem spawns (they're still garbage, this one doesn't count)
---
Increased the minimum distance at which pallets and hooks can spawn (minor killer buff, there are few cases where a killer can't make it to a hook in time, pallet changes affect chase lengths)
---
Corrected flashlight aiming zones (minor buff to inexperienced survivors. Everyone else that used flashlights knew where to point)
---
Increased healing times for all survivors
---
Rework to sabotage, reduced charge cost to toolboxes (survivor buff, sort of. Do people still sabo hooks anymore except for dailies?)
---
Increased recovery speed and threshold when slugged (survivor buff)
---
More perk reworks, namely NOED buff
---
Buffed spirit's mind-game potential when using her power
---
Added legion
---
Reworked the bleedout timer to no longer affect survivors in chases, unless the killer walks backwards (survivor buff, I guess?)
---
Added scratch marks to the diversion perk (survivor buff, or something)
---
Hiding in a locker removes aura reading while hidden (survivor buff)
---
Snap out of it no longer revealed by nurses calling (survivor buff)
---
Hiding in a locker to avoid bleeding out during deep wound removed
---
Because you’re a rational player. People that are upset are people that relied on a meta fotm perks for so long. 
---
3) Remove the altruistic speed bonus.
---
Though in this case, it would end up being buffed in the end
---
If you don't have a flashlight you wait for the hag to pick up a player, run across the traps and trigger all of them. Or just avoid it/crouchwalk through which can be a very important piece of information for successfully unhooking a player. Did the hag place down a trap next to the hook or didn't she? It even works rather well on traps placed to protect generators as the Hag will be less suspecting of someone finishing the generator while not triggering that trap. As for trapper, while in many cases their traps are disabled some traps, by windows or in tall grass are not going to be so and allows you useful information on what loop to run and how best to run it if these traps are present. It also removes much of the mindgame potential on loops that trappers usually trap, as trappers that do not trap them as an attempt to use the common location to have an expected trap and use the actual trap elsewhere will fail in their execution. 
---
Also Hags often times like to place traps on loops or fake out placing a trap on a loop mid chase. Using this perk they are unable to fake you out, and you are able to know with certainty what loops are safe. Allowing you to keep moving on to another safe loop during the chase requiring the hag to slowly remove their traps placed in important areas or face being looped with a slower killer and less counterplay.
---
(TL:DR) Running Small Game allows for a large amount of information to be streamed to the player if they are playing against a Trapper or Hag allowing for at the least a soft counter to their killer powers. It removes one of the more essential aspects of using their power correctly ie, the information of their trap locations being hard to discover for survivors while being known by them. While other survivors can fall for these traps you have much more power to disable their options and know their trap placements when being chased providing an advantage over survivors that are not running small game.
---
T-bagging ingame and telling me to kill myself post game isn't exactly passive aggressive behavior.
---
Congrats, you just repeated everything I said, and managed to entirely miss the point. Let me spell it out for you then. 
---
The reduced cooldown from enduring is just as good, and more reliable than using the tonic on a DS user. Using both is overkill, but if you lack confidence that much, go for it. 
---
Fuck this and fuck ochido, dude is a whitless troll who did nothing but bully noob killers for his own immature amusement! 
---
That would just be unfair for survivors
---
autism speaks
---
Both have good perk sets. So basically it comes down to whose gameplay you like best. I'd suggest looking up videos of people playing them, just to see what it's like.
---
Personally, Spirit is one of my fave killers. I love the totem protector build where you run all hexes and snag people off them. It's great.
---
If that's true then the survivors who did cry must be kicking themselves. 
---
I would like to see NOED return to being the killer equivalent of Hope but ultimately it's up to behaviour, at least we now know for certain that they are starting to address things the community are upset about.
---
Honestly, I’m almost in the same boat as you, been saving up shards again for awhile. I got the clown awhile back with sheds, he’s been a lot of fun!
---
You could also wait until the devs reveal the next killer, and pick it up if it interests you. Otherwise, spirit is a good pick! Legion, while super divisive, has some pretty good teachables, so those would be worth it IMO even if you don’t want to play as him/her.
---
But you aren't doing anything to beat your opponent.  You are just hoping they fail, that means that if you win you didn't invest anything into, and thus it is free.  
---
I agree that camping hasn't been addressed and that it's probably the biggest problem with this game still, but dude, the DS change is ludicrous? Are you joking? It can't be countered by dribbling and no one has to wait for the wiggle bar to fill to use it. It got nerfed as a whole, but that is absolutely a buff for anti-tunneling. The perk isn't just a "get out of tunneling free" card, but it discourages killers from using the tactic because they might get an unavoidable D-Strike for doing so, which, as any skilled killer knows, can absolutely murder your momentum and ruin the match.
---
I’ll take the stun resistance from having pallets smashed on my face all trial, thanks. 
---
this clip was taken about 5 days ago lmao
---
So how is that unfair?
---
Its good if you make something useless useful
---
...
---
I'm calling the police
---
Nah, just dont tunnel a guy that just got unhooked and it will never proc and even if it procs its one second less stun than the last verion. I could not care less that it nerfs dying light because comparing dying light to old Decisive strike is ridiculous.
---
I've nodded at survivors after I caught them. 
---
I'm not trying to say NOED is broken or anything, for the same reasons the devs have already explained. DS was clearly broken, and needed to be changed. Self care I've never really had a problem with. I just think NOED is bad for the game, both for the survivors and for the killers. It just seems like a big source of frustration. Ultimately I agree with the devs here in that it has reasonable counterplay available.
---
Dead hard has counterplay though. You can bait out the dead hard which isnt hard to do. Once you know they have dead hard you will never prematurely swing when you can barely reach and theyll get to a pallet.
---
Plus you can run enduring and spirit fury which might give you enough to just take that pallet and waste their perk bc you insta destroyed the pallet and get a pretty much free hit.
---
i so wish i had been streaming last night, i went in a survivor round on ps4 and i decided i was going to just yolo the match and try to be the protector of the other players, when the first player got downed and picked up i dropped a fire cracker and they got loose, then i go the leatherface to chase me for 2 gens and he lost me then he downed someone else and hooked them and after he walked off i unhooked the survivor and saw leatherface coming from the distance so i ran straight to him so he had no choice but to hit me with his hammer and start chasing me again again 2 more gens get turned on during this chase, after i get healed up i get on a gen with meg and we pop it on right as leatherface downed another survivor and hooks them, meg opens the door and i coulda left but instead i decide i am going to at least give this survivor on the hook a fighting chance and I'll just take their place if i have to, well leatherface is face camping her so i get him to rev up his chainsaw and chase me around the hook and after he messes up and hits the player on the hook with the chainsaw i unhook them but the game glitches slightly and kinda slingshots me and saved survivor back to next to the hook and leatherface downs us both and the notification for NOED pops up , anyways i start crawling away towards the exit gate which is on the complete other side of the map and i see the other 2 survivors in the gate motioning me over but i spin in circles cuz i dont wanna get them killed i keep crawling but in a different direction so the people in gate got the hint and they left and right as leatherface is about to death hook the survivor i had unhooked the survivor dcs so its just me on the ground and i look back and leatherface is looking all around the hook area for me, i hide right next to one of the trailers by the big barn (on the corn field map of course) and as soon as the person dc'd i hear the hatch open on a hill that is about 16 meters in game from where im at on the ground the hill is on the right side of the barn and leatherface is currently on the left side of the barn looking for me thinking i was crawling that way towards the exit i guess so i am crawling towards this hill wishing i had tenacity lol and the whole time i hear that heart beat sometimes really loud sometimes quieter and im crawling up the hill and i start hearing the heart beat loud and steady and i dont look back i keep crawling im like 4 meters from the hatch lid and all of a sudden the heart beat is almost gone, i look over and  leatherface had been in the barn looking for me, didn't see me on the hill and had come out the back side heading for the open exit gate :) so i crawl the last couple meters into the hatch :) that was the first match in a while that had my heart racing and the sweat pouring down my face :) i went into the match not caring if i lived and only trying to make sure the other 3 got out but once i was on the ground and was slow crawling towards that hatch it was intense!  btw loved this clip you shared with us, i felt the intensity of it and thats just watching it, i bet it was amazing as hell to actually play it with that intensity :) moments like that and my story are what make this game so much fun!
---
I disagree. The best games are the ones where you actually have to put in effort to juke/not get juked, have to actually try to strategize, where there's a perfect balance between not getting rolled, or rolling. Where the tensions are high for both sides because they both have to do their best, those are the most satisfying games. When you lose an almost finished generator and you know it's your fault, or when you manage to get an escape after an arduous chase: the satisfaction comes from giving the game your all and feeling like it was a fair, balanced match. Those games don't happen often in dbd, but when they do it does not matter if I die or get a 0k. The fun really is in the gameplay section, and it's WAY better and more satisfying than rolling the other side.
---
If u camp the downed survivor for 60 seconds, some gens gonna be poped. If u leave him on the ground he will be healed by other survivor. So, leaving on the ground will not be a good strategy.
---
Idk, my Ps4’s a brick right now🧱
---
Sign me up for a pint of Daddy Myers' premium world famous hand-churned throat gravy :)
---
wow then they are doing a pretty good job so far don't ya think!? lol :)
---
Claudette is a fucking ninja I love it. Her brown cosmetic items and her hair make you look like a fuckin tree.
---
no, it's a fucking term to say something is heavily changed, will no longer be used, or is gone. not everything is trolling, fucking twat
---
oh yeah totally just splendid! XD
---
Why would any killer want to waste 60 seconds of their game so they could avoid DS? They don't even know if a survivor have it or not. There's not indication.
---
Its unfair now for the killer. Every new obsession gaining that speed boost.
---
Freddy has to waste time before he can pressure the survivor. Pig is rng based but her traps are a kind of built in ruin and her crouch can get her a free hit if you dont use that charge. Freddy has nothing, no stealth (la,la,la gives him away and the dream transition lets survivor get to a pallet), no chase ability and theonly killer who cant defend hooks or even hit survivors without his power. 
---
The tag and leave em method is a worse version of 3 gen doc
---
This guy's post is very flawed but why bring autism into this?
---
They aren’t getting rid of it lul 
---
If that’s the case, then sure. I don’t have a problem with survivors asking for a NOED rework. But comparing the two perks is apple to oranges is my point. A better comparison is comparing the hatch to NOED. Just saying.
---
Got a sweet that rolled me as Freddy, next game I got them again and played spirit with prayer beads on the game with ruin, devour hope, thrill of the hunt and haunted ground.
---
They didn't escape.
---
Change doesn't need to mean nerf nor buff, but you can expect either. Change can be either positive or negative.
---
Your comment implies that it had to be a negative change.
---
&gt; At least you can actually fight back
---
That's why a lot of people here don't like it. Almost all games are people fighting back against the bad guy. DbD is unique in that aspect where besting the killer is more like a puzzle rather than rock em sock em robots
---
Any killer can do well. Point is freddy and his power is the worst in the game. No killer has a worse power. Freddy is shit
---
You say you're not biased but this post sounds biased to me. Both sides honestly need to stop with these half arsed arguments.
---
I already regret replying seriously considering how stupid your points were but here we go...
---
How is camping not addressed? They added punishment for emblem (even if not enough its there). They added smoother unhooks which means you can juke around the hooked guy to try and bait a wrong hit from the killer. They added unhook protection even if it isn't working 100% yet.
---
**Borrowed Time** GOT BUFFED, not nerfed. You can save as many people as you want which means if the killer is camping everybody, you can easily go for multiple saves throughout the match. They recently changed the BT effect to Deep Wound which means if the killer decides to tunnel he is screwed since the bleedout bar will stop, you no longer need self-care to heal the bleedout, no skill checks and Nurse's Calling no longer affects it.
---
God it hurts to read what you said. 
---
More of this "just don't tunnel" nonsense, when no tunneling is necessary.
---

Cleanse the totems you big cry baby
---
r/subsididntfallfor
---
What did they say? 
---
I can agree. I've never used DS other for Laurie's adept achievement and I only used NOED back in 2016.. but back then you kinda had too.
---
Yeah, I actually see it as more of a camping thing than tunneling. I don’t think we will see it much either.  Unbreakable use will go up a ton I think. I don’t use DS either so it being changed doesn’t effect me at all, I like the idea of the change but I just don’t feel like it’s any good as it stands. I’m hoping they do something with the clock during the PTB
---
Balancing for SWF just kills solo survivors, and creating a game that only supports solo play as killer is a good way to lose most of your player base. There's not an easy answer, but nerfing solo survivors into oblivion isn't the answer.
---
Additionally, the myth that all SWF squads are organized, skilled teams of gen rushers is ridiculous. Everybody always points to the organized squadettes as the norm, while the majority of the player base is playing casually with friends, and more often than not the killer can capitalize on the die-hard altruism. If comms make that much of a difference, add them to the base game and balance accordingly. If the issue is that highly skilled players tend to team up and bully killers, fix matchmaking and implement a ranking system that pairs these survivors against highly skilled killers. As is, the main issue is that rank 1 is reachable just by playing somewhat consistently, deranking is easy and goes unpunished, and there's no real way to separate the wheat from the chaff. 
---
Its not but its the most OP toxic noob perk the killers have so why leave it.
---
Glad to see a fellow Doctor around here!
---
But still though, taking screenshots with your phone is unexcusable. F12 or PrtSc, both do the job.
---
But that isn't "gone". You can't subjectively re-define a word in language just because you want. It's "changed" or "fixed", but not gone. 
---
Example: You can't go to the store and say "oh god, the brand of food I like is gone!" when in reality the packaging it comes in was just changed. DS is still a perk in the game; it isn't "gone". 
---
Top 3? How? You havnt said how hes not the worst yet let alone how hes top 3?
---
"I play by survivor's rules so it must mean I'm better somehow" 
---
I would love this but I want it to be like Friday the 13th does it tbh. 
---
The pallet stun has a wind-up. It has inactive frames before the stun's active frames. The stun doesn't happen until part way through the animation. It is not a bug when a survivor gets hit during a pallet stun. That is normal and expected game behavior. It is behavior that is adequately telegraphed to you by the game's presentation, as you can clearly see the survivor reaching for the pallet before throwing it down, and should not be surprised that those are inactive frames. There is nothing to fix. The game is working as intended and as you should expect it to work.
---
If you want to get to better at stunning the killer without getting smacked in the face, **throw the pallet earlier.** Just assume the killer will hold W and walk under it, because what else are they gonna do, respect the pallet like a goddamn madman? No, they're going to walk under it and you're going to get the stun and because you threw it early they won't have time to smack you in the face. This will solve 90% of your problems. The remaining 10% are lag-related and may not even be solvable by dedicated servers - ping is a cruel mistress that guarantees different players see the same events happen slightly differently and there's nothing anyone can do about it.
---
I basically use how early survivors throw pallets to tell how good they are. If the pallet is so early it misses me entirely, they're a scared baby survivor learning the game. If they bring it down on my head or shoulders, they've learned how to play the game but I already know I'm going to get some hits off them at pallets during the game. If they bring it down on my little tippy toes - so early it leaves me thinking "WTF game how was that a stun?!" - they're a god and it's going to be a rough chase.
---
lol even more ironic is the new president of NOA Last name is Bowser! lmao......MARIO WE NEED YOUR HELP! Bowser said hell with the princess he is just kidnapping the entire company! :)
---
When some killers burn BPS, they play efficiently to make sure they maximise the return from their offering. When others do it, it's to compensate for the shitty score their poor tactics give them.
---
Seriously, they should make it work multiple times (still can only be used twice, once per unhook) OR increase the stun back to what it was before.
---
Since the drop animation takes around 1 second before the survivor can start running, 3 seconds is nothing. 
---
I'm on ps4 
---
Meyers and Freddy both have add-ons that interact with their obsession so while you might say that, it's not impossible.
---
This was at about 3 PM
---
That was my thought, too. I think it actually makes DS a useful tool that isn't just a get out of jail free card. 
---
I agree, too, about NOED. It's another 'get some free kills' at the end card. 
---
Sounds like Amanda. 
---
Oh shit, I didn't realize you know me so well. I define "everything as trolling"? 
---
You really are fucking stupid and crazy. Stop trying to incite anger because you lack the ability to discern logic from emotions. 
---
Also, to prove my point further you state "you're actually incapable of understanding that you're the one that doesn't understand the meaning of "gone""
---
Gone's definition is - Gone - adjective -  "no longer present; departed."
---
Your semantic argument doesn't hold water.
---
I recored it with my graphic card because my computer is sh\*t. Maybe when people likes my posts i will buy that editor.
---
&gt; First of all Camping/tunneling isn't an erratic or individual behavior. It is massively found in gameplay
---
Someone here ran data on 1000 games and only about 10 percent had camping in it. That's quite a low rate.
---
And it objectively is individual behavior, regardless of whether or not it's common. 
---
&gt; and the reason why is because it pays off. Sitting around a hooked survivor usually means getting the guy who comes to rescue him or at least a having one guaranteed kill. Solo players (usually 2 of hem) waste their time trying to find a chance to unhook the survivor, this means less gens done. If a surv is rescued in front of the killer he WILL be insta-downed. So camping is incredibly beneficial for the killer, that's why it is massively done. 
---
Do gens. You can get 3 gens done and still have plenty of time to attempt a rescue, even if a couple of players waste a little bit of time going over to see if the killer is camping or not. That is not success for the killer. And now you're saying that devs need to intervene on poor survivor play with this argument. That is absurd.
---
&gt; If you think tunneling/camping is not a problem then you should pay more attention to the amount of DCs following it.
---
Number of DCs is meaningless. Survivors DC if it's a killer they don't like. They DC if they get mad at a teammate. They DC if they go down first.
---
&gt; except they are choosing not to do it when it comes to tunneling/camping. 
---
Numerous people have explained to you how this is not the case and you're just ignoring it
---
&gt; Second: of course it is their jobs to interfere and create a fun environment/game experience.
---
Their job is to balance the game and make it playable. It is not to intervene on every single thing. 
---
As you yourself said, there have been multiple additions to the game to discourage camping. Some people do it anyway. And they're going to do it no matter what.
---
So, what exactly do you think should be done?
---
\*Read title\*
---
\*Look at picture\*
---
\*Wait for gif to play\*
---
\*Read title again\*
---
I'm an idiot.
---
the only criticism i can give is that you shouldn't have tried to kolby right away. in case things went differently you could still have a chance to be unhooked if downed again if your partner somehow got free again. other than that...good on you making it to the hatch :) very intense and fun, and i am not against killers that slug the last 2 people when hatch can come into play, their goal is to kill everyone your goal is to escape, the tactic totally backfired on him this round lol :) good job! :)
---
But who takes who in the poo-poo?
---
That's completely different than having an ability totally centered around the obsession 
---
I don't think new DS is that bad, I think there is a lot of strawmanning about people complaining about it rn though.
---
That being said you're fucked if you think Lithe, Empathy, Urban Evasion, Sprint Burst, or Self-Care are still good perks. In fact if I see teammates using UE or SC it tilts me harder than anything the enemy killer could do. Like "holy shit can you please stop spending 30 fucking seconds healing yourself in the corner and do literally anything else instead" or "oh cool my teammate is coming to me on the hook, he's urban evasioning at me from across the fucking map while the killer chases someone else".
---
This guy gets it
---
The difference between wraith and huntress is only 5% so 4% is definitely not a negligible amount of movement speed 
---
how about instead of instadowning them it puts them in deep wound. i feel this would be a very fun mechanic as you get hit multiple times and have to mend. /s
---
3pm where? Xd
---
what time were you playing? this happens alot when traffic is low on the game between like 1a.m-6a.m for me i will get put with people 5 ranks or more lower or higher than me
---
That’s what got us into this whole mess.
---
r/expectedthanos
---
Od just 2ait to see who the new killer is when they reveal him within the next week or so anf ptb should be in 2 weeks or less so
---
Out of those 2 the Spirit would be the better choice. Spirit Fury is a really good perk when comboed with Enduring. However if you want a better information perk, Legion has Discordance. In terms of gameplay you might like Spirit as you can mindgame people.
---
PS: If you only bought Clown then i'm gonna assume you don't have Ruin since you don't own the Hag.
---
&gt;So what's stopping the killer from waiting at your dying body? 
---
I mean, other than the fact that that's a terrible decision that will cost them the game and a bunch of BP? Nothing, I guess.
---
Seriously, what's the complaint here? If the killer is squatting on top of your slug, he's throwing the game to troll you. If the killer slugs you and wanders off to chase someone else, it's no different than being slugged any other time. The killer gave up a hook state for more pressure, and that happened to counter a perk they didn't even know you were running because DS no longer makes you the obsession. So now someone has to come tap your 95% recovered slug to pick you up. And if you have unbreakable, which they also don't know whether or not you have, you'll counter being slugged.
---
its like reversed borrowed time because borrowed needs to be on the person unhooking but ds is for the person on hook. but think of having borrowed and ds
---
Dunno if this serious or ironic. I am too confused at this point.
---
Just in case OP is legit worried about bias. Funny how killer-sided section contains specific problematic perks, but survivor-sided section is made of concepts that can hardly be defined. You included tunneling and camping, but didn't bother to add gen rushing. 
---
If it is not the bee I better commit uninstall game
---
Ok, now you're fucking with me. 
---
Arguing over the definition or application of a word is textbook semantics. 
---
DS is still in DBD, so not gone. Goodbye. 
---
Hi
---
😄😄😄
---
Honestly I swear michael promotes more toxic gameplay than any other killer
---
"whoops I fucked up and now this dude has us all exposed, better dump him on someone else"
---
The argument isn't that it doesn't work, it's that it's a bullshit way to play the game and completely 1 sided. You can do it all you want but it's something that completely ruins the game for the one slugged. But of course we're gonna see a lot more of that now with the DS "buffs" that so many claim it got. Enjoy laying on the ground everyone and make sure you bring your unbreakable or else you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Awesome, thanks! No idea if I'll ever get around to doing it, but if I do, this should help :3
---
Thanks anything else ?
---
I don't understand why it's toxic.
---
I really doubt this obsession swapping will actually go through. It messes up so many perks for no clear reason
---
Troll.  
---
It's certainly going to be interesting to see how it plays out.
---
&gt; NOED will always be a useful trump card
---
The overall success of NOED is entirely dependent on survivor behavior 
---
Probably not what you want to hear but I think thats fine. Dying Light is one of the few perks in the game that I don't really understand the Devs intentions when it came to creating it. It just fully punishes one player for existing if you try to use it to the best of its abilities. Its a perk specifically made for tunneling one random (before you could argue that they were the DS user so its fair, not so much now) who might have got fucked by RNG and preventing them from playing the game. Rancor is almost on the same level IMO but I guess it makes mori dailies easier so I dunno. It still doesn't feel any better getting hit with a Rancor mori while using no obsession perks because there really wasn't much counterplay to the game randomly choosing me to be the obsession. At least new DS sorta changes that so I'm not the target though.
---
Lol u literally can ruin his power by crouching behind the random ass walls or trees which are placed ALL around EVERY map because god awful map design. U probably just haven’t hit rank red ranks where reaching tier 2 before a gen pops is rare as fuck. If playing against a Myers is that hard for you idk what to tell you. I feel as though you’re the type of player who can’t play without Ds and doesn’t look around you,
---
It’s not that hard to cleanse totems.  Normally survivors who die from NOED are the ones who stick around farming.
---
Go to the wiki for dbd and read what kind of negative effects Judith’s Tombstone gives to Myers and read on his stats with how that addon affects him. If you’re not trolling, then I do apologize for putting your comment in jest but if you see the irony in your post, you’ll understand why I was laughing before. 
---
also a killer main, i won’t feel like shit using decisive and i hate getting randomly tunneled
---
it’s a great change that i’m excited to see
---
I've been running it a lot ONLY because I've been sort of leveling most killers equally since i just love switching around a lot and for whatever reason NOED is one of the first perks I got for every single one.  And level 1 NOED is strictly better then most perks I have access to so...  Uh, sorry guys.

I don't want to be THAT guy but... you can just not get hit. I know it sounds really condesending but stealth is a part of the game. Yes it's a part of the game that gets nuked every fucking patch but it's still a part of the game. I don't see NOED as equal to DS because of two main reasons:
---
1. Decisive Strike is always active. If the late game is never reached then NOED is never activated. Decisive Strike however constantly wastes time during the early game which is arguably much more important than the late game.
---
2. Decisive Strike counters something that the Killer HAS to do. (Hook Survivors) NOED makes it easier to do something the Survivors SHOULDN'T be doing. (Getting hit and getting down) NOED punishes the opposing team for doing poorly (getting spotted and not cleansing totems) while DS rewards the player for doing poorly (getting downed). Know a fuck load of people are going to downvote me for that.
---
There are other aspects as well (such as cleansing dull totems) that make it so I don't view DS and NOED as equals. I still think NOED is a major problem and the perk needs reworking as well (instadowns as a whole are very unfun and when you put it on Killers who are designed to get surprise hits [Wraith, Freddy, Hag, Nurse] the balance mechanics set in place for these Killers get thrown out the window) but if I had the choice of shooting Decisive or NOED I'd shoot Decisive and then throw the gun at the dead body.
---
&gt; At least you can actually fight back. 
---
They buffed Jason's Rage recently, so that he's immune to stuns while in Rage. Love it or hate it, in the current version of the game fighting back is worthless and a bad idea.
---
Just attempting debate here
---
Why are survivors so annoyed by tunnelling? It almost ALWAYS works in favor of the survivors. 
---
Time to play my 5 Hex Totem Spirit and nyoom to anyone touching my totems with Thrill of The Hunt.
---
😄😄😄😄
---
if a survivor dcs then i am inclined to just let someone have hatch it isnt their fault that their team mate dc'd like that...unless they dc'd cuz you face camped them on the hook then i can understand why you hooked this last girl to.
---
OH YOU MEAN HADDONFIELD 2.0?
---
Oh. But if he starts chasing the unhooked survivor it's tunneling? And if he doesn't the dstrike will never be used. I still don't get it.
---
Its at the bottom
---
Aight, Ill 1v1 you.
---
What's your Spirit build?
---
Maybe Trapper makes all the toolboxes. He is an Engineer and Ironworker, after all 
---
Yes because it's SO hard to survive without DS.
---
to all the ppl talking about the watermark, this is my first reddit post so idk the watermark-to-meme ratio, and for this being my first post ~420 upvotes in ~12 hours in noice
---
I still fucking love Iron Maiden after using it on Huntress. The perk cucks Survivors over so hard when they don't expect it. They get out of the locker the moment you walk past and then proceede to freak the fuck out and die.
---
ok then there is no excuse for this
---
Lol are you sure it’s the same girl?! This was 2017 youmacon. But if it is her then tell her 100% she is amazing!
---
Some games sure, I play plenty of matches where the killer might only hook a couple or just one if tunneling the whole match. Killers are more prone to tunneling when they have NOED.
---
Are other killers really so afraid of DS that they just juggle all surv. I mean if they manage to land the skill check good now they used it and down them 10 seconds later. They still leaves marks and trails to follow. I think knowing how surv work/think gives you a massive upper hands. I used to be a shit killer then I started playing surv a lot and learned about scratch marks and blood it's amazing how well you can do with just that. 
---
DS was a decent perk a lot of killers whine and get anything surv nerfed into the ground if it's halfway decent. DS isn't some god tier perk everyone makes it out to be, it's not like they run it and suddenly the match just wins for them, I can get it may be annoying and I feel that's where most killers hate it just because it's annoying. I don't tend to rank up my killers most of them are lvl 1 just basic stuff in game goes a long way to finding them without needing to tunnel, camp, etc.
---
I didn't have an issue with it as killer if they hit it oh well it never really made a big difference in the match most of the surv still died. I didn't even run it barely at all as a surv it wasn't a be all end all perk there are other perks that are just as good that I much preferred. I didn't even see it ran as much as all the same killers perks most surv had a mix when I play vs most killers have similar loadouts with a few outliers.
---
If you know how to track and how to chase DS shouldn't give you much trouble like everyone makes it out to be, stop chasing players around pallets for 3 minutes you don't need to hook every chase. You don't need to to get 4k every match as a killer, I'm not expecting to escape every time as a surv or get 4k as a killer, but between my matches my killers matches go way better as the basic mechanics are really good themselves when you know how to use them or you know how surv think when it comes to chases. I am starting to drop the game tbh as being a surv isn't really fun anymore even with swf if I was a killer main it wouldn't be so bad but I like to do both and it's stopped being fun with surv it just sucks now anything decent for surv get's nerfed into oblivion eventually.
---
NOED is a crutch for bad killers
---
i completely agree with you
---
thats not very nice
---
Top right is actually holding 4 Claudettes though let's be real.
---
I'VE SAID THE SAME THING 
---
Except those aren't solid counters. Missing the skill check is down to a mistake on the Survivor, people can get used to it and nail it the majority of the time. Dribbling needs to be done up to 3 times per Survivor which isn't reliable and less so against non-obsession Survivors. So you basically just save their DS for the end game. Having to wiggle when you're not the Obsession certainly makes it harder to use but when you do use it you end up wasting more of the Killers time.
---
Cleansing the Totems is a solid counter and can even prevent NOED from activating. There are 4 people to cleanse only 5 Totems which have spawn points you can remember. There are also various ways to help find Totems easier like Small Game, Detective's Hunch and the Red Twine Map add-on.
---
They're simply not on the same level.
---
3pm in Bulgarian time. The US is 7 hours ahead so it was 10 PM in burger
---
maybe. i would think with all those tools, mechanical skills (courtesy of john kramer) and bags of gears would be put into the toolboxes.
---
THANOS PERK 
---
THANOS PERK
---
Made some edits. I really do have bad formatting lol.
---
Opposite for me tbh, I can't tell you how many moronic killers will chase me for 5 minutes just to down me with one hit with NOED and facecamp me.
---
thats not very nice, i’ll be speaking to your mother about this rude tone young man
---
I mean it's not like the killer is pulling out his stopwatch and staring at the slug for a whole minute, right? Guy gets unhooked in front of you so you down him and go do something else for a bit. If he has DS then you're not hooking him either way, but by downing him you are wasting his and probably another survivor's time. Three if you're chasing one. Of course it's probably better to go after the guy who unhooked if you see him but that's not always the case.
---
i could get behind alot of those ideas but i can see the respawning idea getting thrashed by salty survivors, i am a survivor main and i would be okay with it but others i can see tearing it to shreds. I mean i look at it like this, as a survivor main it would suck if a killer had a way to completely negate one of my perks, in fact wouldnt that be a neat perk for a killer where a killer could use a hex or something that each token gained during the match negates a random perk from a random survivor?
---
Funny because I use Enduring on other Killers and they're still going to get away. Not unless there's absolutely no pallets or windows or anything in a good 30 meter radius. 
---
Assholes always insist "Oh, Enduring counters DS!" And I don't think you've even tried it Mr. I Use Killer 50% of the time. I don't even believe that. I'll make a bet that you use Killer only if there's a daily and you hide in the lower ranks where DS isn't as prevalent. 
---
I’m actually a killer main &amp; i do understand your point but for argument’s sake you can’t honestly tell me every game you’ve played as Surv is a co-operators paradise? I loved the idea of having some form of defense vs the killer thats not a glitchy flashlight or relying on chases &amp; pallets. Hiding or fighting have always been valid strategies in horror movies and theres no real locker boosting perks to speak of so decisive strike has been the only real non-item defense a survivor has. I agree with the changes to dissuade slugging and not allowing 4 survivors to have it, but making it a hook based perk directly implies people consistently unhook surivors &amp; / or the killer will be around for 60 seconds after the unhooking, both of which in my experience are unlikely. 
---
To be fair new DS really doesn't help against tunneling, especially when compared to old DS. It's just Decisive Strike with a timer.
---
Yes, and that is exactly my point!!
---
As a survivor, the games I enjoy the most are where I barely escape the match. Where I managed to escape the killer's grasp over and over again. Where my teammate saved me from dying on the hook. 
---
However, those are the games that I enjoy the LEAST when playing killer. If I manage to get a kill or two then yeah, whatever happens next is fine for me since it is most likely that I've secured my pip. But if that's the case, then my fun is taken from those that I killed. If everyone manages to escape, I personally can't say that I had fun on that match. 
---
This is just my personal point of view and by no means it must be correct and/or the only one. 
---
If you see the Obsession symbol then 9.9 times out of 10 they're using DS. This isn't hard, breh. 
---
The servers are still up, and although you won't find games if you're on PC it runs better than DBD does.
---
That said, you'll experience a lot of bad teammates, obnoxious players, weird bugs, and annoying hitboxes. It's also not the most fun it's ever been IMO, due to a recent buff to Jason which makes fighting back a bad idea.
---
All new content was cancelled due to a legal dispute between Victor Miller, the original writer of Friday the 13th and Sean Cunningham, who owns the franchise, so EVERYTHING related to Friday the 13th is in a legal bind for the foreseeable future, not just the game.
---
Secretly working with the Killer 4head
---
Tunneling is targeting one Survivor even when other, more viable, targets are available. You getting unhooked, running directly at the Killer, and getting downed again isn't tunneling. It's you making a bad play and the Killer capitalizing on it, as they should.
---
When the killer cant get a kill for 5 gens then he shouldnt be rewarded by even one hitting just one survivor. Its a noob baby killer perk which is the most easy to use perk in the whole game and it has no downsides besides the chance that the survivors did 5 totems and if they did not. Time for some easy skill kills.
---
The balance with your suggestion is that if killers opt to have several end game totems, some may have been cleansed already.
---
yes, it is original, this happened to me in game right after i was looking at “LET ME IIIN” memes and spent 20 minutes in photoshop afterwards making this
---
&gt;every killer has the same hitbox.
---
(Laughs in Clown)
---
(Cries in Clown)
---
Gotta loop the killer with hope but dying state
---
Hahaha it really is. Kudos to your team mate for the save. Sucks when it’s cannibal and you can’t really do much bc of chainsaw :/
---
Thanks! Much appreciated :) 
---
I guarantee you run noed. Lol.
---
To be fair potato play on the Killer's part, and he was a real big crybaby for DCing there.
---
As long as you have Pamela’s dirty ass sweater, a flare gun, swiss army knives and health spray, along with bear traps planted outside of barricaded Cabin doors so you slow Jason down as much as possible, the sky’s the limit.
---
i strategically tunnel if i need someone dead or if i know someone is dead hook 
---
speaking from my own experience whenever i play survivor being randomly tunneled gets rid of any chance of me getting more points and/or defending myself
---
now there’s accidental tunneling where you go back to the hook and run into the unhooked person or you just happened to find them instead—which typically warrants a down from me because i’m not going to waste my time looking for the other guy
---
it ESPECIALLY sucks when you weren’t being toxic or annoying (having ds or teabagging) 
---
but if the killer comes back and actively ignores the unhooker it ruins the experience for the survivor because they’re getting robbed of points (and survivors get an unequal amount to killers most games already)
---
tl;dr not enjoyable
---
I was a single player and the Entity made this bullshit
---
I'm well aware of the negative effects of the tombstone add-ons. I've played Myers for hundreds of games now. The tombstone piece doesn't slow Myers down, and even the full tombstone doesn't slow T3 Myers down enough to the point that he can be infinite looped. Every time I run either of the tombstone add-ons, it's a guaranteed 3k at a minimum without breaking a sweat. The tombstone add-ons are OP.
---
Always a fan of ditty.it memes
---
You little shit :) thanks! 
---
its ok, red,purple,green ranks are the same, i always see the same shenanigans in those ranks
---
Let me into the exit gate? boi i wanted to make this meme and get on with my day, not spend 20 minutes clone stamping out the subtitles and matching fonts
---
Not yet that we know of but ptb is coming and after new killer/survivor comes out more than likely 
---
Enduring isn't what i'd call a good counter to Decisive Strike considering you've still been hit with it. With the way most maps are they more than likely have time to get to a pallet or window, meaning Enduring did practically nothing as a counter.
---
The cooldown on Small Game is short and is not only helpful for finding the Totems but also at teaching you the spawn points. Meaning you'll be able to find Totems more reliably when you aren't using it.
---
Bringing up two perks that no one uses dismisses the initial messages point, it's not about downsides EXISTING for survivors, it's about how they don't really exist in perks we ACTUALLY use. 
---
In that case just let the perks come up in the order that they were on the perk loadout (from left to right.) So as an example if I have BBQ, Ruin, NOED, and Bloodwarden and all but one totem is cleansed then I'd have NOED but not Bloodwarden.
---
Honestly, if the devs have made the nurse/wraith thing official why not make Kingfield happen eh? eh? 
---
Okay, (1) I'm talking about the current DS. We're all waiting for the cancer to be nerfed. (2) Unnerving Presence doesn't counter it. I've used Doctor, got the bastard(s) up to Madness 3, and used Unnerving Presence and the sons of bitches can still hit the skill check. So you should really shut the fuck up, thanks. 
---
Not true, I play plenty of matches where only one or two get hooked. Mainly because of tunneling or camping. Why reward that behavior with a one shot ability that has no timer and no obligations to be met?...
---
That plays a role but not entirely. Survivors can be very focused on cleansing totems but if RNG grants you a godlike totem spot or spots then they are going to spend too much time trying to find them. So totem placement is also a factor
---
I didn’t even think of that lol. This is why more brains = more good ideas.
---
When a wooosh gets deleted.
---
Unfortunately you aren't every killer lol
---
yea, but too much effort for a quick meme
---
That's not Jeff. Where's the flowing locks, the mighty beard, the large, bear-like frame? 
---
imagine being so incompetent the word "gone" is too advanced for you to understand.
---
if you already know you've lost, don't respond, it's not worth the trouble your small brain will have comprehending this.
---
&gt; There was NO counter play with the exception of enduring and unnerving presence
---
Also dribbling, which didn't require a perk slot, it traded time for a higher chance to hook
---
If they're not going to change it they should at least add a totem counter and give more points for cleansing dull totems.
---
I'm a survivor main but when I play killer (rank 9) I always run thrill of the hunt. When I'm playing against a 4 man swf, all my dull totems get cleansed pretty quickly but when I'm playing against solos maybe 1 or 2 get cleansed in total. I don't even run NOED but my findings as killer confirm the struggles of solo survivors. If your random teammates don't also look for dull totems, you are pretty much SOL.
---
Didnt see that! I hope at least thats true. 
---
Yep! That’s me. I cosplayed The Huntress for a few cons in 2017 and 2018, it was too much fun :D 
---
It isn't true. They changed it because, ironically, killers cried about it. As soon as survivors realized it was active, they would just fully immerse themselves in the game for 2 minutes (aka hide like little bitches) and just wait it out. Killers didn't like nothing happening for 2 minutes after the gates were powered so they changed it back to infinite duration but at this point hexes had come out so they tied it to a hex as a counterplay.
---
If he means the original, it was infinite duration, no way to counter it, instadown, and speed boost. Survivors DID cry about that one because it was fucking cancerous. 
---
I agree.  I consistently fuck dudes up before the gates open when I use Billy.  I rather use the perks to help tracking.
---
I wouldnt saw survivors are OP at all, its SWF that is OP for sure and needs to be addressed but its been made clear thats never going to happen.  The real problem is how do you balance SWF without nerfing solo survivors...
---
Pop Goes The Weasel
---
no
---
That was some quality blocks on those stairs. 
---
Oh ok I think I just misread what it meant then. Thanks!
---
I’m crying tears of happiness!!! Like omg I loved your cosplay at youma! I’ve been trying to get people together this year to do a group DBD thing! Are you from Michigan? Or do you travel to youma?
---
Thank you
---
The Loading Screen tip heh. "Survivors are trying to Survive, so as Killer you should Kill the Survivors so they don't Survive."
---
Where do they stream? And how do you fallow them to know when?
---
Be polite, be efficient, have a plan to kill everyone who teabags
---
He said he would be taking a break from DBD, but still the timing is pretty meme.
---
Killers that say 'just cleanse totems' need to play survivor some time. New better hidden spawns and it takes fucking forever. Seriously, go into a game and try to cleanse all totems before starting to help your team do gens. You will almost never get to late game anyway!
---
Good team play!
---
Okay idk how you wouldn't farm this game??? If i was killer im definitely farming
---
hex totems should have skill checks and take longer than dull totems. getting notifications for hex totems being worked at base is potentially too powerfull. imagine devour hope on nurse at the mori stage. anyone who touches it is dead
---
Why would any killer run a perk that makes sacrifice times longer?
---
At this point, I cannot tell which game is worse.
---
*you don't rely on a hand-holding perk to secure yourself kills so you probably are better
---
Yeah, I bring Borrowed Time every game specifically for this...it really is my favorite thing in the game probably. 
---
Of course, someone is probably going to say “but the gates were open, what else is he supposed to do”....and completely ignore him being toxic.
---
:) your welcome hope it works out for you  see ya in the fog, i'll be the david with assless chaps for easy kissability :) take care.

The new DS only show the obsession after using the perk, breh.
---
All sounds about right except for MYC. IIRC you have to be a certain radius away from the hook for it proc, but with Range add-ons you could probably just snag both Survivors from outside the radius.
---
Almost everyone who says Freddy's bad does so because of either point A or the memes. 
---
Point C is just an issue in having a constructive argument that unfortunately also applies to most discussion about Freddy.
---
I see that point. 
---
I've never thought a survivor having DS was toxic tho. Tbagging is kind of annoying for sure.
---
This sounds like a complete strawman, I never hear people simply say " rank doesn't matter". People do however say the ranking system is shit, as well as the fact that the skill difference between a lot of rank ones is massive due to how easy it is to rank up.
---
Wow, I didn't realize that cleansing totems and wasting half the match looking for them was 'fun and healthy'.
---
The only change I disagree with is changing the stun from 4 seconds to 3. If the change was meant to make it less likely to tunnel, reducing the stun will only make it more easy to go for the same survivor.
---
&gt;As soon as survivors realized it was active, they would just fully immerse themselves in the game for 2 minutes
---
Yeah, I can see that being really annoying. Don't really know what they can do to fix that, maybe add a penalty for staying in the game longer than you need to (penalty would pause if there's a hooked survivor, though)? Kinda like how staying near a hook has a penalty now.
---
I personally never use NOED or the current iteration of DS because I find them to be too much of a crutch. I do think NOED needs a rework, people hate the hatch, what if NOED was the perk that allows you to close it as well as giving you the haste status effect instead of exposing all survivors? Probably a bad idea, I'm just spitballing at this point lol
---
I think this is a repost but I haven't seen any of these in awhile.
---
The reason it sucks is it promotes camping. If it had big numbers it would be a quick and easy kill just for camping a basement hook.
---
How
---
How? Now I want to see both of the original pictures
---
It's amazing on Huntress and I find it crazy how many times it continues to catch people off-guard.
---
Personally I love using it with BBQ + Chili, hearing 3 people scream and knowing where they all are despite their best efforts really makes my day as Killer.
---
Thanks for the comment,when is the new killer/survivor or we dont know yet 
---
Doesn't KYF allow these addons? 
---
yea that could definitely be OP, but regardless they need to do something and you are right skill checks and taking longer should have been the norm from the time the first hex was introduced.
---
I just wish more teammates would let me know before they burn them. I have some too! Let me help stack'em!
---
Remember me new meta
---
This seems to happen if you pick Legion, but it usually takes about 15 seconds after the match has started. 
---
True, but it's not really a bad thing because for most cases if you lose it's your fault which in turn is a good incentive to improve at the game. The game is basically telling you: improve and you'll have more fun. It's pretty much the case with all video games but it's even stronger in dbd. In a game like let's say call of duty, everyone pretty much in the lobby can have fun regardless of who wins or loses or who gets more kills. This can be the case in dbd however if you just messing around not taking the game too seriously
---
(I know you didn't say it's a bad thing but I just wanted to point this out, I thought you'd find it interesting!) 
---
He's the worst 😵
---
i got my darn ass slapped with a 🅱️OED 🅱️nife on the gate :(
---
I believe this perk is good for people that are starting to play as killer since you don't need level up any other killer to use it, and it's in a good state
---
Oh God I can hear this
---
I always feel kind of bad when I Tier 3 on someone who I haven't stalked yet, but that's just the way the game goes.
---
It doesn't? Lol
---
I didn't really mind NOED until most of the killers I go against have it. But what truly makes me sad (But mostly mad) is when Billies, Nurses, and even fucking huntresses run it.
---
I believe dying light now gets kinda fucked over by new DS
---
I just used 2 and both times spammed others to stack them and i got escape cakes xd
---
Awww thank you! Yes I’m from Michigan, and having a group would be awesome! 
---
lol, selfish teammates!
---
No, I think you misunderstand. 
---
That was v2, they already changed it by making it infinite but tied to a hex. We are on v3 of NOED lol. It has been very controversial. 
---
It happened so often I thought it was a bug assigned to the offering
---
Someone found out that the new 100% real killer is a Bee. So BHVR decided not to release it soon because we all knew about it. So itll be out april 1st.
---
I mostly only play solo when I want to practice running the killer for 5 minutes while no gens get done. It's about all it's good for, since most randos are trash.
---
"Maybe he just combined Lock of Hair and Hair Bow for the big brain mindgame!?" - Meg Thomas facing a Infinite Tier 3 Myers, probably
---
I don’t think you can run bloodpoint offerings in KYF, only offerings that affect the gameplay like reagents and moris.
---
I do understand, I'm just terrible at explaining my position lol.
---
I'd like a revert to the old NOED but with changes that would encourage survivors to not be immersed when exit gates are powered. I think that would be better than the current state of the perk.
---
More of a rework than a nerf or buff I guess
---
I never want to lose the killer to begin with( expect legion, fuck that), that's why i always wear the brightest clothes and never hide. Them leaving me means he will chase someone else, most probably weaker, that will fall fast and drag the game down
---
The gameplay it promotes is in the survivors, not the killer, just as new DS can now be avoided if the killer doesn’t tunnel. 
---
The idea is that survivors stop to cleanse totems instead of genrushing, and as a reward they don’t have to worry about NOED. Is it the best way they could’ve addressed the “gens getting done too fast” issue? No, but it was their attempt to extend matches without making the survivors main task more difficult.
---
My build is bbq, endurance, nurse’s, and because I have nothing better to put in, noed
---
Killers:
---
Weakest:monstrous shrine
---
Strongest: hex ruin
---
Survivors:

Weakest: left behind
---
Strongest: sprint burst 
---
Me as a Survivor: *\*instantly downed while the tier-down music is playing\** "Excuse me, I'd like a second opinion."
---
Not enough killers? There's currently 14. That's plenty.
---
Thanks for your input. I appreciate a good discussion! 
---
Even if NOED never procs, it's bought you 70 seconds of survivors not being on gens, basically extending the game by one full gen. It works even when it doesn't, and when it does work, it's basically free kills.
---
we could give it the blood points bonus then instead of taking longer because basement hooks are a bitch give it at max rank 15% faster sacrifice progression if the killer is not within lets say 30 meters. and the bloodpoint bonus could apply to every hook but make it in game bloodpoints so it caps at 8k
---
It was more so that genrushing the killer out of the match wasn’t healthy, just like tunneling some poor guy out of the match isn’t healthy either. 
---
Both things needed to be addressed, and this is their way of trying to fix things. 
---
Eh, it's all just delaying stuff. Unless you're playing Vanessa or Buggzy Jason can wear down your stamina pretty quickly and then just melee attack/knife throw you to death.
---
Point is, it's usually a bad idea to fight Jason for the first 10 minutes of the game, and after that point it becomes impossible.
---
Ah, I see. I was the one who misunderstood all along!
---
Honestly, I would rather keep NOED as is and buff survivor tools to counter it, namely Detective's Hunch and Small Game. Survivors are already being forced into fewer and fewer builds because they keep getting nerfed/killers are being buffed.
---
So long, my trusty old friend. Was good while it lasted. So very, very good
---
❤❤RIP DECISIVE STRIKE 2018 ❤❤
---
Okay the thing about self care though, is even if you are spending 30 seconds doing it, if its a killer that can't one hit down you, or even if they can, the amount of time it takes the killer to down you can far exceed the 30 seconds it takes to heal.
---
Also id rather someone unhook me when the killer is clearly not near me, and not right as soon as i get hooked, or preoccupied, so... yeah \^\_\^
---
That's a high quality meme right there.
---
tbh if you have already killed you obsession with dying light just dont tunnel and your obsession will never change. Its just a bigger reason not to tunnel
---
Faster speed if the killer isn't within range?
---
Sounds epic
---
What do you mean?
---
You don't even need to cleanse in most cases, I don't . It's just being more intelligent during end game. Don't go for the door right away, hide nearby and wait to see if the killer comes first. When he leaves or you know he is chasing someone else, then go for the door.
---
Once the last gen is done run in one direction for a few moments, then switch it up in case he has bitter murmer. 
---
NOED is only useful against cocky/sloppy survivors imo, at least DS saves you from instant tunneling.
---
mainly so it doesnt promote basement camping
---
["Oh thank god!"](https://youtu.be/P1XXeAG-0VI?t=94)
---
make your choice becomes new meta
---
I see t bagging as strategy. Teammate being camped? Take a hit and then t bag the shit out of the killer and they might leave the hook to come kill your toxic ass lol.
---
That movie was creepy as hell
---
Likewise. &lt;3
---
I like it. 
---
I think the one thing that really gets under my skin is when you're getting looped and every time you miss a hit, they spam their flashlight at you. Hahaha
---
LIKE DUDE I KNOW I SUCK ALREADY! I'm fragile pls spare what little self confidence I have 
---
Yeah admittedly there are some situations where you need to get healed but there are no teammates around (ex: making a save but ur injured, last man standing, some other situations) and self care is great in those moments, but it’s the people who just self care anytime they’re injured bc they want to be healed that help the killer gain hella momentum.
---
IIRC the camera pans down from his face to his tummy
---
2 survivors die immediately at the start of the game. *"Perfectly balanced as all things should be." - Thanos*
---
It's just one of those DBD things that happens from time to time. Heck my first Huntress game ever (back in Feb. of 2018) was me versus all Rank 4s (only one of whom was nice and didn't tbag incessantly).
---
Now that they've made it so the killer can be stunned by DS during the pick-up animation, could they add back pallet stuns at any time during pick-up? I don't understand why you have to time it perfectly or it'll fail, it makes no sense and killers shouldn't be carelessly picking up survivors in a pallet without checking around for allies.
---
The purple and I were 2 man swf. This poor hag. We didn't know she was rank 18. We just thought she was an inexperienced hag with low rank perks. I felt bad. But that's probably nothing compared to how she felt. 
---
I got a few rank 8s on pc. After in chat they were friendly 
---
Share button (hold for menu by default iirc).
---
Congrats on surviving.
---
Share button is your friend
---
Using .01% of his power
---
This is incredible work!
---
While it's better on some maps, i wouldn't say it's worthless, even on the most incompatible maps. It's overall perfomance is the best of all perks to me.
---
nice save. you did a good job.
---
My favourite survivor perk has to be Adrenaline. For killer probably BBQ or Ruin
---
And memento mori...
---
I sure as hell did!!! 🙃 Last time Ill correct the masses. 😑
---
You will probably think I am trash but with the new updated placements, I have literally spent 2 minutes looking for just 1 totem. I just couldn't find it, the area covered by small game and the cooldown was just too rough to use. Granted, that was the worst scenario and it is generally faster. 
---
I think a buff to the BP given by totems with small game would be good. Nah, jk, I am just a survivor starving for BP. On a serious note, change it to aura reading like it was before. That would actually make it powerful enough that I think some more people would use it. 
---
This happened to me just now. On PS4, too. The one time I decide to practice Nurse without a daily, and The Entity gives me a team way out of my league.
---
You must have not read many posts/comments on this sub then.
---
ahhahaha I know man, but I have no other perks that are any better too on huntress so whispers 1 it is! 
---
Thanks for letting me know 
---
April 1st you say hmm
---
Trapper could have 2 different base moris. 1 if he is holding a trap and other one if he is not.
---
That's not tall grass, that's Claudette
---
To be fair I think survivor bloodpoint gains in general need a buff.
---
I agree with SG being aura reading, at least for totems, maybe not traps. Make the radius for it pretty tight though so it's not too powerful and doesn't completely nullify maps (although who uses maps unless they find them in a chest?)
---
I run NOED on SWF to mindgame people and the feeling over the power to decide whether survivors live is amazing. Shouldnt that be the case if you are a killer? Just imagine the sweetness and hope of them thinking they will escape and teabag me only to be filled with salt and despair as they see me one shot them with Blood Warden on. I only run it on SWF cause SWF deserves no mercy or lenience and I expect games with SWF to bd either Super Gen Run or Super Toxic Body Blocking Flashlight or Sabotage Putrid Oak Hooks. So when I get SWF, I run NOED Blood Warden and if possible an Ivory Mori to kill the most annoying one of them. 
---
It's not just that. Survivors cry and moan way too loud because unless you have iron will you are basically giving away your position if the killer is even somewhat close. 
---
I think they're coining it as a rework, which seems pretty fitting to me.
---
Evil Pizza Dwight and Shirtless David vs Shirtless Michael. My god. Insta nut
---
Did anyone actually get angry at this change
---
Eric Andre is an icon 
---
*half of the survivors die instantly*
---
HALLELUJAH 
---
That’s why I clarified that I was talking about the new movie. 
---
Dwight best boi, I let most Dwight's get the hatch... most.
---
Maybe learn to play without a get out of jail free card shithead
---
Agreed
---
Cleansing the totems is not viable as the game is clearly balanced around the time it takes to repair five gems and open the gates. Adding in a secondary objective decidedly stacks the odds in the killers favor even 1v4. You clearly don’t have much time spent in this game...
---
I always looked at noed as more of a counter to adrenaline. Since you get the speed burst and it doesn't matter if that survivor you were about to down suddenly pops up to healthy state and takes off. 
---
Survivors just need to open the gates and leave and if you see someone get one hit downed and hooked you gotta make that choice do you risk going for the save or just leave. If you go for the save then you are doing exactly what the killer wants but if you all just leave he got 1k 
---
Get on some of that urban evasion shit and you are a ghost
---
Big Daddy Myers has the best mori. That's what's keeping me going forward in life.
---
The reason for the change is because of the new dstrike change. Whenever dstrike is used, they become the new obsession.
---
I love huntress 
---
Or.. just increase natural BP gain so perks like bbq and WGLF aren't needed for BP farming. Just a thought though
---
OR, once you tunnel the obsession just don’t tunnel anyone else and you’re golden 
---
Yea wglf sucks unless you build specifically around it and even then your probably not going to get all stacks especially if your the first one found
---
Your comment made me very sad even tho i love bloodborne but its pyramid head
---
Mr. MacMillan, I don't feel so good
---
In my experiences playing as and against Tombstone Myers, Purple or Pink variant, it’s about reading his movements and also his model. The biggest giveaway is his open hand when stalking. If you see his hands open when stalking he’s going to be stalking for the instant kill. The only other forsure way is to see how they react to LoS breaking. If your teammates are just letting him go off, pray you’ve been doing generators and get the hatch ready. If it’s purple, use lockers, if it’s pink, cry. 
---
yea and that would be fresh and awesome, :)
---
Smol Axe. 
---
I can't upvote this enough everyone acts as if DS if a be all end all like the person running it 100% escapes and their friends too. I think it was fair (especially with how shit the p2p is and hit boxes vaulting has been lately, etc). I never have an issue with DS as a killer ok now they used their perk now it's gone they are out a perk since I down them 10 seconds later. I tend to level my surv more or my main killer I do lvl 1 nurse or huntress, etc just fine. 
---
I hate to be the guy to say git gud but well, I'm not having issue with DS I don't even run it as a surv because it's not important enough to me I like my loadout better because it isn't a *needed* perk. Playing surv goes a very long way to being a better killer simply knowing how to chase better gives you an advantage. It's ok to not get a down that chase or call it off after 4 minutes, it's fine to not insta chase and kick that genny instead or patrol if you lost them. I found I do a lot better as a killer when I just pressure gens instead of only focus on hooking. 
---
I've some of my friends and I are losing interest in playing because being a surv ins't really fun anymore tbh. Tunneling, camping, etc really make the matches suck when you spend half of it spectating because the killer ignored everyone else and would only go for you. As a killer I owe a lot of success to knowing how the other side works since I play that side too. I still get a lot of kills not tunneling, camping, etc. I try to extend matches by slugging to avoid getting some poor farmed bastard 2 hooks in a minute, I go after another person instead of the one I ma chasing (I purposely take the bate). If I run into someone working a gen I just hooked I'll walk past them, and I generally don't get flamed in the chat and most people are in the match till the end everyone walks away with a fair amount of BP, I like to think it was at least a better match for them. What is the point in getting 4k if I get no BP and it wasn't very fun, I'd rather all my surv escape than get 4k because my ego is so fragile. I admit I've gotten worked over pretty well sometimes but it was completely my fault in those matches and I know what I did wrong, because I fell into a bad habit.
---
Yea because guessing at how many totems are left on the map and wandering around looking for them just in case noed is in the game is totally not a waste of time 
---
hold up. 
---
It works in favor of the survivors not being tunneled, if I play a match with you and you get tunneled to death you aren’t getting any decent points. The reason survivors including myself hate it is because you queued into a match and didn’t even get to play or at least get some form of points
---
Which I don't believe. It could be countered by slugging or dribbling, or if you're in madness it doesn't appear normally or fucking SPINNING IN A CIRCLE while attacking in most case for players unless you're monto or super man DS isn't going to break a game because you aren't going to save the entire game and all teammates for jumping off the killer, running 6 feet only to be slugged again. 
---
It wasn't game breaking or unhealthy. It was as it says on the tin, a second chance without bullshit filler like a time limit after being unhooked. 
---
Now you won't not be tunneled, you'll be tunneled and slugged till the time expires, then rehooked. Woohoo! 
---
That's 3 useless perks just to delay a camping tunneling slugging toxic pos who should be banned instead of having the game completely balanced around his toxic camping boring as fuck 0 gameplay playstyle.
---
Dying light is not a crutch, it's the opposite of a crutch. If you kill a survivor early you don't even need dying light to benefit hugely from it. That's why so few people are using it, it actually does nothing a lot of the time.
---
PSN is down. It says it’s up and working but you can’t get access to your friends list at all, so definitely something is happening. 
---
&gt; For those against it being included without being perk based, I have to ask why. What reasons do you have to be against it?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; If you are a killer who doesn’t use or rely on NOED, this does nothing but benefit you as more people will become motivated to do totems if there’s a counter. This takes up time and helps you.
---
&gt; If you are a killer who relies on NOED, well, you shouldn’t and probably need to get better.
---
Having the totem counter tied to a perk instead of being for free means survivors will have to sacrifice one of their crutches in order to be 100% sure that NOED won't happen. Even if you aren't a NOED killer this would benefit you. 
---
Same reason killers don't get Whispers, Deerstalker or TOTH for free. If killers want that additional info, they need to sacrifice a perk slot. 
---
Can you tell that to all the killers on Xbox One? Because it shows up 75-85% of the time that I play.
---
He already exists in the game. Keep in mind he can't run so fast for long. Yes you guessed it, usain bolt = sprint burst
---
I read the “totem counter” as a counter to the totem mechanic and was like WTF IS THE COUNTER FOR TOTEMS, then I realized you meant a counter on the screen for totems lmao
---
If you think breaking all the dull totems is viable as solo survivor you’re high. There is no possible situation where a group of randoms should get all totems and all gens until they add a totem counter. If they manage that the killer just needs to uninstall because they didn’t kill anyone in like a 20 min game 
---
The counterplay is IF the survivor hits it then you get back on their trail and tunnel them again until you catch them. I see it happen quite frequently. You all act like survivors can do it every time they're caught and you're stunned for five minutes at a time.
---
Sometimes it’s because the host closed the game during the loading screen, I do it when I see someone bringing a haddonfield offering when I use the huntress, it’s a way of dodging without losing pips.
---
thanks y’all 🙌
---
Dont be toxic? Thats a pretty good idea
---
Link the template please :)
---
Hey, I saw what you did there. You took what I said and you said the same thing but turned it AGAINST me. Well done sir.
---
&gt;the entire sub
---
FTFY
---
Problem with that is it makes it nearly impossible for 1 person to get full stacks, let alone the full team. 
---
Dribbling is an alright example, the only issue is that survivors can use the same precautions against dribbling as they do with not being the obsession: careful planning and going down away from a hook. I see where you're coming from though, as that's not always doable.
---
I don't use ruin so you see it's just a circle jerk of perk complaints
---
Not sure why it’s so hard for people to understand slugging isn’t wasting time. If you go chase someone that’s at least two survivors doing nothing, and if someone goes to heal the one you slugged that’s 3 survivors not on gens 
---
Roast legion all you want, but leave my Jeff alone 
---
Yeah, except for the endgame Freddy build, Bloodwarden is just for the memes. The survivors realizing they're trapped in there with you is pretty funny
---
I can only judge what I see.  You mentioned toxic behaviour and I am trying to show you the other side of the coin. You saw 42 seconds and start trashing and bashing the killer while the survivor, in the same timeframe,  is playing as toxic as the killer.  
---
And to answer your question. No I don't. Usually I don't care enough about such behaviour to comment. 
---
I think I pointed it out in your comment because you started out good enough. Saying why you bring a specificspecific perk but then you devolved your comment in something so blind. Kind of reminds me a bit of this prozd scatch [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJX4ytfqw6k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJX4ytfqw6k) 
---
I mean, he's toxic as hell for the repeated stabbings and tossing bottles at the dude on the hook. He's not toxic for sitting in the basement next to the open exit gate. Literally no reason to leave at that point, but sit at the top of the stairs so that nobody can come down and make the save.
---
Prepare to get downvoted my man
---
hmm, maybe make it so every survivor gets it once a get is done? though i feel if it's like that then it will be too good but i'm not sure
---
We need bee flair so much
---
bruh don't edit. I don't refresh that much :D Now your second comment has a way better ring to it and you don't feel so one sided! 
---
Not if you're good at ambush.
---
Somebody had the bright idea that if you’ve been hooked twice you’ll be instantly alerted of NOED’s presence when it activates. 
---
That has nothing to do with the Mori 
---
B-but you have to spend an hour on a meme! You judt have to!!
---
This sub yikes. No totem counter = no viable counterplay for non swf. People either need to accept ds was fine, or accept noed isn’t because neither one is a crutch they’re both full blown wheelchairs 
---
That’s an ouch
---
Kingfield is my OTP
---
No.
---
You deserved the smacks and face camp because u used DS but other than that good play
---
I main survivor, have maybe a quarter of my play time on killer if that, I just understand that having an ability to heal yourself when the point of the game is to work together to survive is stupid. Also adrenaline overriding exhaustion and pretty much ensures your escape from a chase. And ds is ds.
---
It seems unfair that your rank 9 with red circles
---
at the end of the day, the real goal is to gain as much BP as you can. If you pip then that's a win, regardless if you died (survivor) or got a 2k (killer). There is no technical draw, you depip, you lost. You pip, you won. You don't do either? You lost, especially if you brought items and lost them as they didn't get you anywhere.
---
Yeah but then you have no mither xD
---
This would be nice!
---
I feel like you should be able to use it after being slugged, or at the very least right after you're flashlight or pallet saved, particularly since it seems like it's supposed to be used to combat tunneling.
---
Sounds like my sprint burst 
---
That’s pretty gay
---
Yeah sorry about that, I’m the type of person whos just too quick to post and then two seconds later thinks of something else to add! 
---
I don’t think a couple clicks though is anywhere near the level of the Clown here. But at the same time, I’m of the belief “giving it back” is totally justified. Yeah we don’t know what happened earlier, but I’m just taking the video for what it’s showing, no point in speculating. No one does that when survivors teabag in a killers video, they are just always the bad guy so why shouldn’t the killer here be judged the same. That’s all I’m saying. 
---
I do not BM at all in normal games, but something like this I’m definitely doing something on the way out..not gonna lie. Campers always get the bags even if it’s not me who’s camped!
---
The dbd movement speed is still 100% and 115% - 110%. nothing has changed. you just played too much shooters.
---
r/mydbdperks 
---
I know haha. I was looking through the subreddit for any news on the outfit and saw your post and was like ‘yeah gonna reply 🤷🏻‍♀️’ 
---
Perfectly balanced, as all perks should be
---
Yeah but look at it from this point of view, killers have so many benefits going for them, they can hit through pallets and depending on the killer they have far lunges and it’s ridiculous cause we have huge hit boxes. I’m not gonna dent I’m toxic but it just depends on the killers play style honestly. I know that ds is toxic but when you think about it but there’s killers that strictly proxy camp or face camp and it’s annoying. I get boosted teammates most of the time so this is my only means of surviving and that’s why I don’t swf cause people call that toxic as well
---
Is it really??
---
How is it not toxic? Are you stupid? If he downs you and slugs you staying in the area of you and not picking you up while still keeping the pressure on the other randoms to stay away from you and let you bleed out. That’s a perfectly ok way to play this game? 
---
[Template for others that need to see a dentist](https://i.imgur.com/XVWmdLW.png)
---
Yea even atleast with perk totem counter would be great
---
Blind fury
---
For every 20 seconds you aren’t in a chase you gain a 5% speed increase but you spot survivors at twice the distance and you gain a hindered status effect once you spot them and all speed increases disappear
---
For killer
---
All I hear is cries and moans over NOED, sorry I didn't read what you said. 
---
DS is still a good perk guys, calm down.
---
I agree that it’s good.  Punishing tunneling without punishing generator repair speed however is not good.
---
Why not just make each unhook give 50% with the same maximum of 100%? It makes it more reasonable to achieve and will likely lessen farming off of the hook.
---
Well, there is always next week.
---
You probably did you sweaty trapper
---
I expected "Finally awake."  I'm happy with this.
---
How much more of an advantage do you want?
---
If there's now a delay before the killer can drop a survivor that they just picked up that means that the R exploit shouldn't work anymore, right?
---
Survivors: "Waaaaah NOED isn't fair, waaaaaahhh" 
---
You shouldn't bully anyone, low rank or not it still feels beyond shitty.
---
Wtfffff how are you gonna confuse pyramid head with some forgettable bloodborne character
---
You're complaining that you want to be able to rush your opponent out of the match, and that you don't want there to be any possibility of downsides for it. I'm sorry but that's not how multiplayer games work. You're not always going to have made the right decision here, cleanse totems or rush gens, and that's not unintentional. 
---
Its a lot better than I remember, it didn't used to be that way.
---
Entity bless this subreddit, i'm so proud of all of us.
---
The game is balanced around SWF anyways since most players play in SWF groups with voice comms
---
Yes the skillcheck appears while the killer is in pick up animation, so no dribble possible now.
---
As a survivor main ever since i started this game in august I just feel like I am constantly getting punished
---
Hope is honestly one of my favorite perks
---
Shaggy as the killer.
---
His Mori is "Let's unmask this guy!" And then pulls their face off or head off or something
---
NOED’s been essentially unchanged since Nurse was released, right? Why has it only just come into vogue? I don’t disagree that it’s powerful, I just feel like it’s always been powerful, but I’ve only heard complaints about it in the last 4-5 months.
---
I guess it could be like ruin where it affects 2/3/4 people but honestly that seems kinda bad, and I dont want to gut it. Maybe it increases time it takes to open exit gates by 5/10/15. 
---
Or it reveals you to 2/3/4 survivors and reveals 2/3/4 of their auras to you for a few seconds. 
---
Nope, no trolling here. I'm not big on internet lingo.   
---
The more I learn about it; the less I like it. Most of it derives from lack of education and misuse of words, only perpetuated by those who hear it and also lack understanding of etymology and application.   
---
I understand language is fluid, but the internet is an odd direction in terms of lingo (to me).
---
Every time a gen is completed, you obtain an Infinity Stone. When you receive all 5, snap your fingers and completely eliminate all the survivors.
---
I get where you're coming from on this, but don't agree 100%. In some cases, the survivor has their team to help them out. I've been bodyblocked after a DS, or even just distracted enough by a survivor who is closer (or brighter coloured) than the DS'er. Also, if you get DS'ed near the exit gate, you're probably not going to get to them in time.
---
There are also newer and lesser skilled killers (like me) who struggle with tracking even without the stun. And the Entity help me if I get DS'ed by a Claudette wearing a hat. I'm just not going to find her. I don't think that using DS is unfair (although I wouldn't waste a slot on it as a survivor), but I'm sure it would be less frustrating if I was a bit better at the game.
---
&gt;half the survivors
---
Yeah idk why this would be balanced at all. Was a pretty dumb question imho
---
They made it so all tiers have instant down for some unknown reason 
---
150 is the highest I tend to go.
---
Just bring ebony mori 4Head
---
Different, I like it
---
Yeah its ridiculous. Just bring an anti slugging perk to counter NOED! Literally he just used terms he saw other people using and mashed them all up together
---
I'm proud to be your friend mr. Famous
---
The crows count as part of the population so 4 of them are alive
---
&gt; and a perk that hides the gen aura from the killer. 
---
oh yeah a perk that allows a survivor to do a gen completely unimpeded is totally not broken no sir
---
Is that really a buff? It’s a buff if you don’t have Rank 3, but in the context of balance is that something that really matters?
---
says the one playing a killer that ruins the fun for every other player
---
So half the crows die and half the survivors die, perfectly balanced
---
I get their initial confusion, other timers like Deep Wounds and RBT won't decrease when you're in a chase, but the gameplay implications if the new Decisive Strike was similar would be extreme. 
---
it sorta does cause at least with it being 3 it took some work but now ppl will just get it right off the bat for something that is super powerful and is one of the reasons why so many really bad killers are getting into low rank 
---
This would be fine as long as the perk stopped working if the killer is in a chase within that range
---
Precisely. This is why I got clown lmfao
---
Yes I get that but I'm not talking about dribbling the ds person, what I meant is that the new delay before being able to drop a recently picked up survivor should now prevent killers from mashing R in order to cancel flashlight saves.
---
OP is the hero we don't deserve. Thanks for this very clear summary!
---
i mori spammed someone who was instadowned from myc because i was mad that they were a 4 man swf who all put yellow fog offerings up
---
Those are some loose standards for the word. I will concede that the general function on here, clearly has changed, and I guess squabbling over a definition is pointless; but I just wanted to make sure there wasn't some sort of hidden motive behind "DS is gone" (like intention trolling). 
---
Thanks for lending insight. I definitely would use other appropriate words instead of changing "gone's" general function. But that's me, and I understand that everyone is different.
---
or the stick
---
A perk that you’re guaranteed only flashlights from chests.
---
.....no.
---
It's great on Clown, tho.
---
i don't get this, took what perk?
---
No, it starts as soon as the killer picks up the survivor. It will immediately drop the survivor before they can do anything.
---
Well the gate is open, you can’t blame him. 
---
&gt;2) If a killer tries to slug with NOED, you can use a perk to get out of that. If not, then you can get saved, which ties to my next point.   
---
&gt;3) People take hits/bodyblock the killer when someone's being carried to give them more time to wiggle out. People also do this against NOED, which is dumb.  
---
These points make literally no sense at all. These have nothing to do with NOED in the slightest. 
---
But I’m the host in this game 
---
I love how your flashlight just burns out rip 
---
How dare you not know pyramid head !
---
The difference is their version now is a 60 second timer from the unhook. If you aren't picked up by then you have no perk, meaning if the killer downs you after a ~45 second chase they can avoid DS by not picking you up for 15 seconds. I feel like there are already enough conditions to make the new DS situational, it doesn't need such easy counterplay on top of that.
---
What I mean with Enduring is that it's a relatively commonly used perk for pallet stuns, and playing against current un-nerfed DS Enduring already makes it very difficult to get away. By lowering the stun by a second you're making a very situational perk a really low shot at actually getting away when it does go off, making it very underwhelming to run.
---
In my opinion, almost every killer has that one combo that really tilts the play in their favor to kill an entire team that’s outside of the standard addon combos for that killer. Nurse has omega blink, Wraith has silent bell/suppressed TR &amp; Red Stain, Trapper has Iri Stone and Honed Stone, Spirit has Prayer Beads and Yakuyoke; Legion has Franks and SWS, Clown has Redhead’s Pinky and Ether 15, Huntress has Iri-Infantry Belt. These combos are rarely seen, this is also anecdotal so it means much less to your experiences, and sometimes the killer brings a combo that just dicks you. Not every game is gonna be the same or fair, I’ve learned. If the killer has to bring double UR and go 110% in a match to get a double pip, let them. I’m not concerned about going that hard ever. 
---
Definitely what this felt like
---
At least you know stuff is getting done, the worst part is when people without urban evasion slowly crouch walk towards you when you are moments away from death.
---
Most players def don’t swf, especially in more than a duo
---
Absolutely. The killer was the Hag and she was the scariest Hag in my life.
---
Oh okay, sorry I was confused.
---
do you teabag in front of her?
---
Im coming to reddit every 10 minutes and Im losing my hope :(
---
...and they have NOED
---
No idea...
---
Yes I get that but I'm not talking about dribbling the ds person, what I meant is that the new delay before being able to drop a recently picked up survivor should now prevent killers from mashing R in order to cancel flashlight saves, even if they don't have ds. 
---
Exactly i can take 4 man DS as a killer and still 4k but ever since I started as a survivor main its like im being punished all the time with constant nerfs and its sickening bc then I come back on here and hear about the next new thing that needs to be nerfed for survivors when's it going to end and the devs learn that its just bad killers complaining. I wish i could see the stats of games and see just how OP survivors are, like how many escapes to kills per game etc.
---
Yeah it's obviously meant to punish tunneling; I don't see why reducing the stun would be necessary.
---
That was awesome. 
---
Yeah I get that and like I said the implementation is a little shaky, but the idea was that totem cleansing becomes meta and everyone does it as they pass by, making it so that you’re not the only one doing them.
---
Facecamping is a little weird, but the whole change was based upon the more common scenario where both sides try to achieve their goal as efficiently as possible, and in that case survivors have the upper hand. Like I said, the way they went about it was weird, but this game isn’t easy to balance so at least they’re trying to do something to address the issue.
---
*Pull the lever to unlock a Claudette*
---
Shaggy’s the killer
---
I can't tell you how many times I've seen survivors still try to run out past the spikes.
---
That flashlight bming in the end was the icing on the cake 
---
Yum yum loved it 
---
no no no that's not what i meant. see those games dont necessarily have to be the ones where i BARELY survive or get by. I can die, and it can still be one of those great games! What makes it great is counterplaying each other, with neither side doing toxic shit or unfun strats, and whoever wins wins but it's ok because getting there was fun anyway. If I'm playing survivor and barely escape that's awesome! If I'm playing killer and someone just barely escapes me, kudos to them. What matters is HOW that came about. 
---
Yes but there are many situations where its much better to not heal for times sake, especially if your playing efficiently and gen rushing.
---
I don't see why people think this is bad, You could literally save someone on hook with deliverance, if you get hooked, pull yourself off, and even if the killer is camping, if they pick you up you can DS them, you could also use unbreakable to make it so they can't slug you.
---
Don't be salty 
---
That's a lot of tbagging for the amount of escape, their rank and escape info tells me they get tunneled a lot and can't really loop. 
---
Wait, so if you're on the hook - while the gates open - when you get unhooked your adrenaline starts up? 
---
If so, I'm gunna start using it. I always thought it was wasted.
---
I agree systematically with all your comments. Especially the aura reading not applying to traps and keeping it tight, maybe ~8m?
---
Enough of an advantage that the Gates dont get opened in 5-6 minutes cause gens get done and ludecris speeds.
---
didn't decisive strike prevent tunneling before?
---
So, so satisfying 
---
Crows are people too so there's a chance that they'd still be alive while the survivors die. And ofc this is thaNOED so it has to weigh heavily in the killer's favor
---
I feel attacked /s
---
I hope so. I love the idea of Obsession but the killer perks for it now are kind of boring. 
---
So fucking toxic
---
Maybe you should start now...
---
Strongest perk for killer is Save the best for last. Period. Everything else has a counter. 
---
If you really care about memes getting "stolen", then you probably shouldn't be making memes.
---
honestly the pallet hit boxes being giant is the only way i can reliably do pallet saves without accidently doing it too early
---
having to time it is so arbitrary I hate it. Flashlights make sense to me because I always imagine it as the killer is looking away until the right moment, but for pallets its like bitch you got hit with a piece of wood the fuck
---
i like the idea of noed having a max amount of hits. maybe hooking a survivor grants you a token up to a max of 1/2/3 and hitting someone with noed uses a token. or add 5 tokens to small game and you lose a token every time someone cleanses a totem.
---
Premonition is bae
---
That’s because it’s five nights at freddys 
---
Shh he is dumb that he doesnt know it works well with Dance with me and Luthe. keept it a sercret
---
throw back to when Mcote would show soft-core porn on stream during the fan art section
---
When I hide in the back corner of a map, and the nearest gen is 20 meters away, and the gen is being worked on by the other 3 survivors, but the killer walks to me even if they get stalled by bumping into the others...
---
And it is hillbilly or Leatherface.
---
When the killer hits someone, then they get juked so bad they come looking for them where I was a million miles away.
---
And it's nurse...
---
I should have a YouTube channel called "Hooked first". I would have 200k subs, and found first montages where the killer has to make the dumbest decision to end up finding me. 
---
No Claudette is Velma, she even has a cosmetic to match Velma.
---
This is literally me playing with my rank 1 friend. It's always 1,1,2,2 and me, the green one. 
---
It’s a big nerf but not much we can do to stop it, and idrc bc I don’t use the perk. What will be funny though is killers on here still complaining about the game being survivor sided when yet again survivor gets nerfed and killer doesn’t get touched at all. 
---
I finally see a bhvr employee.
---
Thank you for the pig buff
---
Honestly, I'm a little bit concerned about this change. I never use ds, but...what if your teammates think you have ds? Doesn't this kind of give the okay to farm with just the simple thought of "oh sorry, thought you may have had ds". There isn't any way of knowing someone has it because they don't get the claws until they use it. People already get farm happy for their stacks, so this kind of just promotes it unless you are in a swf that can communicate what perks you have.
---
Idk why you’re being downvoted but you bet your ass that Dwight is the top in the relationship; and he demands that David refers to him as “The Manager” during intercourse.
---
As a killer main that always runs enduring I’m pretty upset with the DS change, normally I get hit by DS then down them within a couple seconds, DS players rely on it really hard so it’s never been a problem dealing with them, but for all the shitty killer’s that cry about it, good for you...
---
I am found first almost every game I feel your pain 
---
Give it 2 more uses and I'll call it fair since effectively all you are doing is giving yourself borrowed time.
---
VS Huntress
---
Game was going okay, by the time we'd got the gens done there was me and a Claudette left. Claud got downed and was plopped on a hook near the gate that was open. Huntress then stood near the gate exit, keeping an eye on hooked Claud while I hid behind a tree next to Huntress.
---
I was on full health and could've easily dashed out the exit, which is what I think Huntress was expecting me to do. But Claud was struggling and she was so close.. so like a true immersed survivor main, I crept behind a couple of trees up to Claud, unhooked her, and ran on the side between her and Huntress. I ate a hatchet for Claud, but we both got out.
---
I felt like such a hero lol
---
Lol the all knowing devs said it's not a crutch guys discussion over.  You funny man
---
Is this a Max Payne 2 reference to *Lords and Ladies*?
---
Dude has a vibrator on his desk 
---
I remember that too!
---
Let it pass, don't fail it
---
NOED doesn't need to be changed, there are already ways to counter it, survivors just doesnt like to do it, they want to rush gens and run to the door while the killer plays with 3 perks. But in it current state  you can even stop NOED from being activated at all.
---
If both sides played a solid game then the killer already has nearly maxed points and the survs are at 15-20k. If people are running WGLF the stacks could be worth more than escaping. 
---
Plus it feels better to try to find NOED and free the camped survivor then take your 5k and have a boring escape. 
---
&gt;Except it would be a flat out buff to DS if they changed it that way.
---
Only if the Killer tunnels you and downs you within 60s of being unhooked. Old DS is much better than the proposed changes because you can use it at any point. New DS is only a buff in the sense that you can't get dribbled.
---
Plus, you can still tunnel with the new DS if the counter goes down while in dying state. Just insta-down the unhooked Survivor and slug him for at least 60s and chase the other Survivor.
---
The only way this DS is even usable is if Killers don't play around it.
---
I think it should be a separate mode. Almost every match I play against them on PC and it would kill the player base if it was removed. 
---
Oh god, “bloody nightmare” is angsty. Everyone run.
---
Yeah.
---
I kinda like Piggy's because it just feels fast and efficient.
---
An asymmetrical game still has balance. By your logic that means if Survivors spawn in and the Killer instantly moris all 4 of them then that's ok because the Killer is stronger.
---
Regardless of what they do right now, Survivors will still be a stronger side until they change the total time the game takes. If Survivors play properly and do generators then the Killer will lose the vast majority of the time. But, since the balance team is stupid, they're going to nerf other things of Survivors (like pallets, perks, vaults) to make them worse in a chase instead of the *actual* problem, the speed of the game.
---
Sure, you can make Survivors lose chases nearly instantly and that'll speed up the game, but that ruins the fun of the game. Just add side objectives or slow Gen progress. (Toolboxes really shouldn't be a thing tbh).
---
Strongest Survivor - Dead Hard
---
Weakest Survivor - De Ja Vu
---
Strongest Killer - Ruin
---
Weakest Killer - Monstrous Shrine
---
Reworked it. 
---
It’s not 
---
hahhaha that's awesome I'm gonna do something similar as killer xD
---
DS is being changed. Survivor mains are mad.
---
Wave your arms up and down on the hook is the universal "I'm being camped do a fucking gen" sign
---
Just cleanse totems - billy/nurse/huntress player using ruin 
---
Seriously tho, if anything less than a 3-4 man can do 5 totems and get all the gens done against you as a mid teir plus killer it’s time to find a new game. 
---
Where did I state that it was BHVR's fault? I'm just stating that it may have the effect of making those who normally wouldn't farm, actually do so. It would also make those who are jerks and do it have a way of justifying it. Sure you can sandbag and leave people on the hook hoping they have specific perks, but personally I just hate the thought of there being another thing people use to screw you over. We will have to just wait and see once it's in the game.
---
Thrill of the Hunt
---
That's correct
---
I think it would barely reach the other floor if the totem was directly above/below you so I wouldn't think it would nullify that map hardly at all. 
---
Ooof
---
I play both sides at rank one, noed is a bs crutch perk for bad killers to safety pip after they get dicked and is way stronger than ds unless there are like 3 of them in a game 
---
Well, yeah if they have ds.
---
"Some bloodpoints" lol. I don't get the ratios in this game.
---
I played as the Doctor the other day (going for Trophy) so only shocked people the entire game. Not one hook.
---
I end 2nd for BP at 15K when 1st place got 17K. Why do survivors get such shit amounts? 
---
No perk should be game changing, DS is now an anti-tunnel perk in a way
---
I think it's to balance the fact it's instant now. For all 4 Survivors.
---
He literally just looked it up, why would you feel it necessary to tell him what it means?
---
Implying gen rushing isn’t the only way to get out vs a good billy/nurse/huntress
---
I wasn't arguing against most perks, only the 2 that are related to the current conversation. BBQ and NOED.
---
I do Huntress but that's just for the stupid fucking trophy. 
---
Not sure why they thought 100 range downs was necessary. 
---
You forgot the Salt/Rant flair my man. Hell, this isn't a rant, this is an angery tweet.
---
Lol
---
That sounds perfect then. Let's hope behaviour come to the same conclusion
---
It takes one tap to heal someone from being slugged.
---
CLEANSE THE FUCKING TOTEM, JESUS CHRIST IT TAKES TWELVE FUCKING SECONDS.
---
I can't upvote this enough.
---
JOSHIE CHERRY 
---
This right here. Behaviour is trying to balance itself between two entirely different games. One is a game where you're working with a group of 4 people you can't communicate with, another is a game where you're working as a coordinated team who can be on comms. The balance necessary for these two games to work are *vastly* different from each other, yet they're trying to somehow meet in the middle, and it just doesn't work.   
---
If we balance more in favor of the Killer to counter SWF, we completely unbalance the solo survivor experience. There isn't a truly viable medium between these two modes. So I think the most elegant solution at this point is just to add comms into the game (taking responsibility for banning people who use it for abuse) and make Killers stronger to counter coordinated play. I think it would make the entire game more balanced but also more challenging, and thus rewarding, for everyone.
---
I’d put Legion’s at the top too. I really like how they like stab and drag the person back it’s actually really freaky to me.
---
Imagine thinking NOED is as crutch as DS
---
I like that opening exit gate time idea, but dont want to infringe on RM. Crazy idea, what if it increases time it takes to cleanse totems by 2/3/4% or 1/2/3% or something, just a really tiny buff. Oh maybe increases hook speed progression by 2/3/4%. Man I kinda really like that one, makes it less boring since the game is supposed to be over, and provides a little buff that makes them kinda panic. Because I agree, I don't want to gut that ability but I can totally see how it can allow a killer to patrol both gates very easily. While we're speaking of removing haste from NOED, what if we gave it to Fire Up? Right now its literally just a way worse Brutal Strength and seriously needs some real buffage.
---
I'd rather my teammate take 30 seconds to heal and not get downed and hooked on their next hit than not. And as long as they don't take so long getting to me that I hit tier 2/die I'd rather they take their time so the Killer isn't up my ass instantly.
---
Did you forget that there are four survivors? Or did you purposely forget that to make your argument even remotely valid
---
That's not tall grass, That's Claudette
---
Back when the Lunar event started and SWF queues took centuries to find any games we ended up not playing survivor at all. It really highlighted how the only reason I'm playing the game is because it's so much fun playing with friends. Playing killer is fine and fun, but if it's the only thing to do then I would've stopped playing weeks after buying the game. 
---
You can’t dribble. It happens during the pick up animation 
---
Nah I'd rather escape. Thats more fun for me.
---
Sometimes I swear I hear a Huntress before I see the killer and it’s not even her. 
---
I need the source of the artist....for science. 
---
Fair point. I think he should take the moral high ground, especially when he wants to post it online, but that is just my opinion. And I always speculate :D But thats just me again :D   
---
Well that's pretty extreme. I certainly see the downside of joining a game just to be 1 hooked and then you've done nothing, gotten practically zero BP.
---
It's almost like they are nerfing the side that's OP. As a survivor main, I think it's a great change
---
What if small game had a counter like Thrill of the hunt does?
---
You just said assuming no one spawns on top of a totem, and then immediately used it for your analogy anyway. Also, if survivors only cleanse totems based on stumbling upon them, 9/10 all totems won’t be cleansed and then the NOED is very well hidden. If they want to guarantee it to not work, they have to dedicate much, much more time to seeking it out. But hey, congrats on your “I’m a survivor main but. . .” argument. I’m a killer main and still hate NOED. 
---
beautiful
---
They might be running Distressing 
---
🤷
---
good, escape now bitch.
---
Yeah, console killers don't always have the best internet connection, and the game is based off of the killers servers, at least for the time being fingers crossed for dedicated servers. Ill typically get a brief lag spike the first time i run near the killer, but its not too big of an issue. As for the pallet lag, you might be extending the loop a little to far and when your'e spamming to throw the pallet down the killer is swinging through the pallet, the pallet is not instantaneous and is a part of the game where killers can hit through pallets being thrown down.
---
INB4 toxic survivors come through bitching and moaning
---
Damn if he wants to be Ochido he should be looking for that sick hardware ban 
---
You sound so whiny, holy smokes, yeah I forgot to divide a sentence, you literally provide 0 argument against NOED except “wahh an extra minute.” Also say a killer runs it, it doesn’t do jack shit except maybe get them an extra hook. Maybe. It also prevents people from being toxic and butt dancing.
---
&gt;Survivors screamed and screamed and screamed about tunneling and now something was done about that and you still scream and scream and scream
---
Doesn't counter tunnelling. You'll just get slugged instead. They'll slug you then chase the other Survivor. The only way this counters tunnelling is if the Killer doesn't play around it. If they at least make it so the timer doesn't go down while in the dying state then it'll be a pretty good change.
---
If they keep this change I'll probably try running DS+Unbreakable and see if it's worth 2 perk slots.
---
Also, the timer length itself could be a problem but that's what PTR will find out.
---
I get the same thing, I honestly reckon they put them in the background ambience really quietly just to trick people
---
thats so dumb, we have hillbilly and leatherface...
---
Vodka!
---
#CRITICAL *NUT*
---
And at least he got his, what, 6 times blood points?
---
&gt; It works in favor of the survivors not being tunneled,
---
wrong, being tunneled allows the other 3 to do gens freely which means exit gate powered faster letting survivors escape and the killer loses
---
&gt;get tunneled to death you aren’t getting any decent points
---
Ding ding ding.. Survivors hate getting tunneled because they are selfish players. You don't care if your team wins or that the killer loses. You're just upset because YOU didn't get points. You don't give a shit about the team or winning\losing. Just what impacts your ability of grinding out some carrot on a stick shit. 
---
Punishment for not taking those dishes to the kitchen 
---
lol if you think as a killer that survs using self care is bad for you...you're absolute garbo at the game. The space and time you get from some idiot healing himself in a corner not doing a gen is game changing. Make that two survs self caring and its pretty much game losing. 
---
It’s a buff for lower tiers of the perk, since before rank one and two of noed were essentially useless since only rank 3 noed had the insta down. 
---
Check the perk's text; it says that if it activates while you're disabled for some reason, it waits. Frickin' cool, that one. :)
---
Sometimes I hear Huntress Lullaby and I'm not even playing
---
Oof
---
I'd only be fine with it if only Small Game had a counter. It would prolly get some people to use small game. I'd even replace UE wtih small game (Yes i fail a skill check then ue away)
---
Yeah and that’s what makes it “toxic” 
---
Are you playing in a swf?  My one friends mic replays their lullabys whenever they're in a chase.  
---
Haha...PORN
---
Oh yeah he deserved it, guy was hitting me and beating one off in front of me, when I got downed he shook his head for 30 seconds I kid you not.
---
If Monstrous Shrine effected all the hooks on the map it could be worth running, but just the basement hooks is pretty useless.
---
I like the idea of deafness and a mental patient, but I don’t like that he’s related to the Doctor. 
---
So far all the killers are unrelated to each other and I think it should stay that way. 
---
That said I really like deafness as a game mechanic. 
---
He was rank 6 so I guess that could maybe be the case but that’s a big ass maybe, he just thought that my teammates wouldn’t save me I reckon 
---
Mcote won't disappoint us. Don't you worry.

Nah, that was no need, that was a logical gameplay extension. Since they introduced a new perk against people which goes into the lockers (here is your "buff"), they added a neat new gameplay mechanic to BBQ for the survivors. But not many people use that or have the time to do that anyway, that's more like an extension of gameplay mechanics which is good. The strike nerf just killed the perk.
---
It was supposed to be an agreement to my flair, The Kingfield &amp; I, but it's not showing up for some reason.
---
Laurie Strode because she actually likes to fight back
---
Omg, I’m such trash lmao... just finished cleaning those dishes tho :P
---
I mean, I noticed you were playing on console, but my brain did a bruh moment.
---
Favor survivors? To me it seems like survivors keep getting nerfed
---
&gt;Can only be used once.
---
&gt;Wasted if missed.
---
&gt;Wasted on use.
---
Those aren't goddamn counters, those are balance limitations.  The killer has no control over those aspects at all.  Do you even know what game balance is?
---
Thank you supreme. I got down-voted for sarcasm lololol these damn kids.  
---
God, you’re an assuming moron.  Nice situation that favors your opinion. Please put down the keyboard. 🤦‍♂️
---
I still don’t really get this meme but it’s still funny 
---
Oink.
---
Congrats. Decisive only worked once during a match. Doesn’t mean it didn’t have massive payoff. NOED needs to be changed because it’s equally frustrating sweetheart. You spend 9-10 minutes doing generators, unhooking teammates and running the killers just to get hit once at the end of the match and it’s GG. And how? Literally any way. Use your imagination. 3k with NOED by slugging. Ez Pz rewarding little skill. 
---
If you have played rainbow 6, they really need a operation health type of thing
---
Lol you’ve been complaining about DS on your account quite a bit so I say to you:
---
# no u 
---
Amanda all the way, that’s bae 🐷🐷🐷
---
Now that's the essay I was looking for
---
Obligatory: Leatherface for BBQ and chili!
---
That said it depends on what platform you’re on. If you’re PC I’d say huntress but if you’re on console I’d say Wraith if you like his ability. 
---
That said I have a lot of fun playing as Amanda so that alone gives my vote to her. 
---
Thanoed: very time a generator is completed, gain a token.At 5 tokens you can snap at any point in he match hurting survivors for 1/2/ giving them the DEAD status effect for the rest of the trial.Also gain a 25%/50%/100% move speed bonus.For every token the exit gates take 60/120/200 seconds longer to open
---
I hardly ever promote toxic behavior. But that flashlight clicking was just amazing and he deserved it. Not for face camping but for bming on the hook. Sadly you lost your flashlight
---
I can relate to the UE stuff lol
---
When you get hooked your sprint burst is instantly recharged. Sprint burst actually helps counter tunneling a lot!
---
....so what is this exactly?
---
Yeah they are favoriting killers quite a bit 
---
9% entity progression might be a bit too broken on every single hook. Maybe have it be 25%, 50%, or 75% of hooks on map based on perk level, they could differentiate them by design or aura color too.
---
Well, it will work the exact same way. Get the guy down, hook him, and when he gets back on his feet mori him. Doesn't change anything for tombstone myers.
---
Have to admit that it fuck DL a lot. I guess you just need to wait the 60s and go on someone else when it happens so your DL stay active.
---
If people leave because SWF is removed, you’ll have almost no survivors left, and endless killer queues, even worse than now. As the guy above said, it would kill the game. 
---
If a few killers quit, it’s no big deal. There will always be survivors willing to play as killers, even against a SWF team. 
---
So.... bye Felicia!
---
Omg, and here we go. You can cleanse totems *wow what a concept* to completely get rid of Noed BEFORE it can even activate, what do you do for DS? Dribble? Which is frustrating for everyone involved. 
---
Please stop, just because you taunt the killer at the end and die doesn’t mean it’s frustrating. 💚
---
Without SWF this game will die much quicker than it already is, yes the constant voice comms is an unfair advantage and take the place of multiple perks. But thats just the nature of the beast an Asymmetrical game will never be balanced the best we can hope for is an ever changing meta where each side enjoys being OP for a time before it reverts for the other side being OP. There have been multiple stages in this games life were killer was stupid strong and when survivor(s) have been stupid strong, just roll with it your preferred side will be the stronger one at some point.
---
Yeah, with perks like Remember Me and Dying Light the killer will now have an extra incentive to continue chasing you after the stun. Rancor as well, assuming the exit gates are opened. Now the killer can kill you, why would he stop tunneling you?
---
It feels like you were just looking for something to get offended about, but okay. I know farmers will farm anyway. If you read what I wrote, I am saying people who wouldn't normally do that may take the risk now. Like I said, we will just have to wait and see. I will be happy for it not to be an issue hope it isn't. 
---
It's always been a bad perk imho since it actively encouraged tunnling. Hopefully it will also get a rework at some point.
---
finally I'm not alone
---
When I first played this game I was a Feng main just for technician
---
Is this ironic or?
---
And how long did that take again? From a much larger studio. It would be great if they did that for this game but I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
That would be cool! I can imagine them all over the survivor digging through their eye socket lmao
---
Around a year ago the killers were regularly getting nerfed and the game leaned pretty heavily toward survivors.
---
What this game needs is a third role so that the percentage of people who freak out when their role is weakened during balancing decreases from 50% to 33%.
---
I'd go for a totem counter.. in small game-&gt; killers have to use a perk to know when you are touching active totems, survivors should have to use a perk to know how many there are. Ofc swf will just have 1 person run it and find totems so on that same note all totems should give a break notification (dull ones dont) and have hard skill checks added to them. Not easy ones with large zones but tiny zones that you have to pay attention to the screen to get them. 
---
As for the speed removal iirc NOED doesnt work with only the killers weapon ie the knife or hammer. So killers like freddy who are pretty much just an M1 killer lose a boost in speed while gaining the ability to maybe smack 1-2 survivors down (depends on the group not all solo ques are altruistic after that last gen is done) 
---
On that same note certain killers need reworked completely. NOED isnt a problem if a killer is shit and you get your shit and GTFO of the match, while a good nurse can do nothing all game and sit there waiting for NOED to activate then kill everyone. 
---
Dont hate me pointing out the obvious
---
Thats the situation you gave me LMAO
---
All I know is he's really brutal and also he's smart. A girl hid in a barrel and he pretended he couldn't find her but really he was on top of the roof waiting for her to walk out xD
---
Lol sorry the entity was displeased 
---
Hitting people on the hook is BMing.
---
The game is in a better place than it's ever been IMO, crazy that people still have so many issues with balance especially. 
---
3 month old son for me, can wake up as soon as a match starts and needs a diaper change as well as to be fed
---
Nope you're dead on, I'm a cunt
---
Nobody has to do anything friendo
---
I guess you could say they were DISHpleased
---
“I THINK WERE DOING A GOOD JOB SO FAR” quoted from MCote during a interview! 
---
TAKE MY ENERGY!!!!
---
It’s definitely a step in the right direction but it’s still doesn’t fix the problem. I think if they limited it to once per match rather than once per survivor would be good. 
---
Nah that’s how HE plays pig. Not how she is played but yea I’ve ran into a few of those and it sucks.  My pig is lvl 1 so if I play her it’s because I got a mission and don’t even bother camping.
---
What change did they make?
---
If you dont have BBQ that should be your priority after that figure out which is your most comfortable. Cause it's not fun being uncomfortable the entire time 
---
This isnt true. I am almost just as good solo bc i observe and learn things that way. I play swf because I enjoy playing the game with my friends and I dont think it ruins the game, I think people just complain about too much shit in this game. I've played my fair share of killer against swf and its not really that bad and I am saying this as a killer who has been red ranks every season since I started
---
It's amazing how much misinformation gets spread on this subreddit.
---
All Killers have the exact same hitbox, regardless of model size. Different model sizes and weapons look strange because of this. Confirmed several times by dev streams.
---
BHVR: Please use Territorial Imperative. It took a long time to code... Please?
---
They explicitly said this isn't like the self care change. This is happening. They might tweak it after ptb, but this is happening.
---
Might want to be careful my man.  That's an exploit you're promoting.  They ban for that kind of stuff if the killer recorded game.
---
Then you're open to being fooled. They might as well not drop the pallet and take you for another spin.
---
Never respect the pallet
---
I meant by default. I know the bag's around, but base Trapper's a little weak, and I think two traps at default would considerably speed up his placements.
---
I guess kinda. The masks are very similar and they're both smart with catching victims. I think he's inbred too but I could be wrong. I mean he's a cool killer but that part is just ew lol He also cut his own face off or something
---
Yeah just the way he worded it "That's how pig is played"
---
*Runs NOED and Blood Warden together like a boss*
---
so? Don't nickel and dime your games. You should be looking at your score and BP over a time period of games. You really going to get salty because you don't get to max out points in 1 match?  You're not entitled to a certain amount of points per match.  Yeah, it sucks.. oh well part of playing a PvP game. Move on to the next match and try to do better. 
---
 And if you got 1 hooked and died, that's on your shitty team for not coming to unhook you and if they couldn't because you're going to say "but i got caaaaamped".. oh well.. why can't you be happy that you caused a shitty killer to get no points and your team to escape. If you're a good player.. 1 or 2 matches aren't going to stop you from advancing through the ranks to face better killers who won't tunnel as much or less often and the shitty killers who do will stay at the bottom because they're never going to get good playing like that. 
---
10 lashings in the public square!
---
No, I wanna play with my brother and friends I've moved away from
---
&gt; rank is a showing of how much you play the game, not how good you are.
---
rekt
---
I already have BBQ and I main Myers and Hag, but I want to branch out and understand every killer, amd since I have those BP I thought it would be fun if the community chose who I'd level.
---
Agreed. 
---
Yeah, but Leatherface, Pig, and Myers don't have a competing licensed game in the same genre. It's a shame, especially since F13 was a mixed bag, and died out pretty quick.
---
Congrats you'll earn a DC as a reward or a ban for-&gt; exploiting or holding the cane hostage 
---
&gt; I’m on console as well so connection is also an issue. Explain to me what I’m supposed to do
---
start by putting on your big boy pants and building a PC so you have a real gaming rig and getting some summer's eve for your vagina maybe?
---
Brave one. I would have used those two pallet And looped them a few times before throwing them down and running to the exit. I hate trapper because the risk/reward is so high with them. One second you’re king of the hill looping this dumb dumb across the map and SNAP! Its over and now you’re the dumb dumb!
---
* Can only be activated if you got of the hook within the last 60 seconds.
---
*  Shorter stun.
---
* Easier skill check.
---
* No longer causes the obsession mechanic at game start, has the same interaction for everybody.
---
* Occurs during pickup animation (dribbling is no longer a thing)
---
* Makes you the obsession when you use it.
---
Obviously your correct. It's impossible that they wanted to play with their friends and have a fun time. That's crazy. They must all be bad and don't know how to play this game alone.
---
Ok I will do another one
---
Oof I think it's him just turning as he clicks his flashlight
---
r/2redditors1cup
---
I already have all the "meta" perks, including BBQ and Ruin. I main Myers and Hag, I just want to understand all killers since there's not a single killer I dislike playing aside from Legion (I'm very bad with Nurse if that counts).
---
More than advice I wanted just the community to make the case for their mains as a fun way to spend my BP. 
---
PS4 btw.
---
That doesnt make any sense. Generators need to be finished to leave. Dying light halts gen progress. When the obsession is dead, gen progress gets stopped, no matter how far into the match you are. Its a crutch.
---
You don’t know pain until you try to swing at the last second in tier three and Michael changes form mid lunge.
---
Huntress because it takes skill to use her and she is a fun killer to learn. She is rewarding to play and when you get a long range hatchet it feels good.
---
I was thinking more like this
---
Once all the generators are completed and NO ONE has died or been sacrificed, it activates.
---
Once activated, you will have 15/20/25 seconds to hit someone to instantly put them in the Dying state. Once you hit someone, the timer will refresh itself. The timer will pause when stunned or when hooking a Survivor. Once the timer has concluded and no one has been hit, the perk will immediately deactivate itself. 
---
Playing against this NOED would be just to loop or hide. Either become the entirety of the Default Dwight or run a marathon around the killer shack.
---
I read that you hate DS and upvoted. Didn’t need to read the rest
---
That's what I like about Wraith actually. A vote for the Jumpscare Squad then.
---
Goddamn Pig mains justify your answer
---
Jokes on you, I already main The Myers
---
"soon" just after hatch standoff fix..., and before Freddy overhaul and Legion being deleted from game xD
---
thats a good point, but this is a nerf to freddy + dying light combo, he never had that problem, he could always find the obsession with class photo
---
Yeah can we please get the template 
---
Don't remember the rank but she was P3 so I expect better.
---
(I'm rank 11 currently)
---
That's because survivors have been the stronger side since the beginning pretty much, especially at high ranks. So to balance the game they needed to nerd survivors or buff killers. 
---
Oh you proved a great point, I don’t expect dbd to do something like that, they just want money like you said. Operation health was very needed, just like dbd needs it.
---
I think it's hard. I feel like NOED is both a crutch and too strong and I also feel like it is needed. If the survivors don't bother cleansing totems and just gen rush, they kind of deserve to be hit by NOED. However, most of the time, NOED is pretty unfair to survivors. I always look for totems as a survivor and it's so frustrating to cleanae 4 totems and still get hit by NOED. Or the killer camping the hatch when you're survivor, so you complete all generators to put pressure on the killer and he just hits you with the NOED
---
DAMN STRAIGHT YOU DO
---
I am actually slightly excited that DS is being reworked in the way it is. The rework deals with Tunneling and Camping while also making it a new staple in Kobe Builds due to how has been reworked. It also means that I can play Kobe Meg like I used to and fuck with somebody something fierce. Run them around the block until the final gen pops, and if I get caught, just wait for a door to be opened because I will generally caught with right before or after last gen pops. Kobe off then run away. 
---
NOED is not the problem, the whole totem system is whack.
---
Look it's token the DS=NOED false equivalency guy
---
All killers are trash /S
---
Agreed. Wish they had a good survivor main and a good killer main; who’re both unbiased so they can better judge how the game actually works instead of nerfing in bad spots and always taking the killers side 
---
OP is talking about the time played right now BEFORE the perk goes live.
---
he can't even camp correctly. He could have just gone up the stairs and have gotten a 100% kill
---
hehe bwai
---
A much simpler fix would be to increase gen repair speed for every few seconds a killer is camping and not in a chase. 
---
&gt;I deliberately ran to the killer and was downed/ picked up to just get my DS off 
---
This won't be a problem if the killer isn't a potato, recognizes the obvious bait, and leaves the recently unhooked person alone.
---
Oh, I didn't know you lost points for it! Damn! Good thing I haven't done it then, I don't think you can get negative points in this game! LOL!
---
👉👆👉👆👉
---
Actually? And are you a killer oriented player? Because it’s a huge step for Devs to here from GOOD EXPERIENCED UNBIASED PLAYERS BEFORE DECIDING TO CHANGE THINGS THAT DONT NEED TO BE 
---
I don't even use lithe and technician now 
---
I equip devour hope for the occasional free mori's. I don't care if the perk is only tier 1, I can't pass the posibility to mori a survivor
---
if by "hunt" they mean "chase" and by "progress" they mean "go down" then it sounds like they're suggesting the opposite to me? 
---
"why doesn't the timer only **count down** when you're in a **chase**?"
---
idk which is a worse idea tbh
---
Yeah, you have to get sneakier at higher ranks to keep managing it, but it's still entirely possible to sneak up on people!
---
As does Save the Best for Last. Slap them to slug and get another stack before leaving them alone to go to another person.
---
if they nerf NOED they would have to nerf Adrenaline though, especially because Freddy exists
---
Face Camp saves, getting clowns and cannibals off of their fat asses and out of their mothers' basements since 1998.
---
Ludicrous* if that’s the case then don’t ever do anything again, not everything In the world has to go in your favor or make you have an advantage 
---
yup, huntress axes ignore iframes.... for some reason! I've heard that it also ignores dead hard, but the little boost might make you miss anyways
---
Isn't small game technically a totem counter, since it tells you where the totems are? The only real issue is not knowing how many are done
---
Yes they're obviously a part of it, you can't escape if no generators are finished. But if you find yourself on the business end of a one-shot, it wasn't punishment for *completing* the objective(its still incomplete...), it's 'punishment' for taking shortcuts trying to complete it. 
---
No, I'd just like to see more effort put into some of the posts on here. I don't really enjoy mediocrity.
---
I see nothing special
---
Clown because *THICC*
---
Lol, people who were around for the asylum exploit (and those who got banned for it) would very much disagree with you.
---
Agreed. Personally I think the effect is ridiculous in entire at times but yes, as a noob I was very confused when myers would oneshot me, granted my expected alternative was that he could see where i was and beeline towards me.
---
Indirectly it does, you wiggle free faster as well as struggle a lot more 
---
LOL!  That feeling when you want to play with your friends but they are complete potatoes.  Completely know where you're coming from and that comment made me laugh my ass off.  
---
Yeah I um worded that really shittily. I did not mean to dig at you lmao, I meant it’s a big step for someone who is experienced at killer to agree that the perk is fine because it kinda seems like the devs are salty r15 killer mains 
---
i've had a few friends die because they thought the killer could see them so they ran in a panic, only to have the killer find them because they're running around like a maniac
---
A perk that adds a second great skill check. It would be randomly placed in the good range. It couldn’t touch the normal. It would be OP if the great was too big, I’m thinking a tremendously difficult skill check. Idk for each tier but perhaps adding a rng mechanic or making it slightly bigger.
---
I’m still an idiot
---
Nobody who has a "fursona" has any chance of being in a perfect couple.
---
The gates were open, he either camps you and gets one kill of doesn't and gets none. He chose to kill the guy with a flashlight and DS. Can you really blame him?
---
You have 23 downvotes, think about it.
---
&gt;the strongest option killers have rn
---
Nope.
---
I don’t really understand this point. The problem with DS is (was)the fact when a killer spends chase time on someone, THEN that person uses DS and continues on. If what you are saying is that upon being unhooked, a person with DS is going to stand there and taunt the killer saying “haha you can’t do anything to me I have DS!”,  the killler will have spent zero time chasing them. Why wouldn’t they just down them and either leave them on the ground, or just eat the DS and get rid of it? Hardly any time would’ve been wasted in this scenario. Maybe I’m not understanding exactly what you mean by kite the killer...
---
The timer should be much shorter, like even just 25 sec, but the clock should definitely stop with chase. Does it make sense that a person is tunnelled off hook, maybe reaches a pallet to extend chase, and ends up running themselves out of thier own window? Was this person NOT tunneled? They were. Yet they have an anti tunneling perk and can’t use it, it’s just dumb...as is the fact you could be slug countered. 
---
Yeah, it's pretty sad. They could easily just reverse the nerfs they made to him and it would be fine but nooooo. There has to be a re-work that will take an untold amount of time which is just like the long awaited Wraith Cube last year or so where the Wraith really got nothing that improved his game aside from being able to break pallets, kick gens, and use lockers while invisible. 
---
I'm glad other people are asking pointed and fair questions about the time aspect of the DS changes. A comment I made about removing it yesterday got downvoted like 7 times and I was wondering if other people were questioning that aspect of it. I'm very pleased to see their reasoning for the time and how they came to the conclusion of putting one in.
---
Because it’s very much a crutch perk, and it enrages a lot of people that decisive strike (which has a much higher skill gap) is a crutch perk but completely ignore noed because it’s a perk for their main. 
---
Back to what you
---
We’re asking. A lot of people wish it was on a timer, and or showed up immediately instead of after someone got hit. It’s not AS great against SWF but it’s super powerful against solos and sometimes duos because of a lack of coordination
---
Hahahahaha sounds about right 
---
btw i’m only joking. i don’t actually think it’s needs taken out. i just hate these types of survivors (i didn’t stay, im the kate &amp; i left after i took the pic)
---
You don’t wiggle faster with BO (best acronym ever) the struggle thing doesn’t affect me at all. I’ve been stunned out of a BO like 2 times once in the Swamp with a sabo Jake and once in the Game but I had killed 2 people in one spot so I probably couldn’t have made it to a hook anyway.
---
Will being that survivors can spawn right next to a Hex totem, I say it’s fair.
---
Just p3 50d my Jake. Started working on other survivors and also got Meyers to 50 for the first time
---
*Survivors who don’t use DS but think it’s bullshit* = Complaining about changes to DS = *Killers who think DS is annoying but get that it’s just part of the game just like NOED*
---
Lol, karma is a bitch xD
---
Spirit was continuously slugging Ace in cornfield and trying to find me, I 1UP’d (Mario) Ace 5x and she continued slugging and patrolling for me.
---
The 6x I got Ace up he found the hatch and I DC’d so he could have it since he was getting slug tunneled, his timer had a quarter left and she was literally going to let him bleed out to find me.
---
Moral of the story don’t get greedy when there is only 40% DC ban currently cause the actual good survivors save their DC’s for these moments.
---
Just fucking hook and move on 
---
I used to be like this. When myers popped T3 i didnt know he could hit me 1 hit. I thought it meant he could see me thru out the map no matter where i went. They really need to change it 
---
It’s a shitpost. If there were no killers the game would’ve died, same with survivors.
---
Can someone clue me in on The Bee?
---
Was the killer just afk farming? You'd think he'd find em eh?
---
The only thing I recommend is that Killers should be able to close the hatch.
---
I don’t blame him at all it was just the fact that he shook his head and was being cocky that made him deserve not to get any kills. 
---
JOSHIE CHERRY
---
Got to use beautiful DS for a decent amount of time before it's useless. RIP 
---
I like receiving them as well but Iv only gotten 1 of those from a player, Iv told 6-8 GG and they message it back but only 1 sent from an opponent. 
---
I feel like it’s misworded. I think the question is supposed to mean the opposite (shouldn’t the timer not progress while in chase)
---
lol seems to me like I’m the idiot. Everytime I try to comment today it comes out wrong and rude. 
---
👀👌👏👊
---
Woah, woah, woah, Bond is fooling gud perk.
---
A lot of those changes are for one specific killer, not to mention for 2 ½ years most killers were in the dumpster in terms of balance. All of these killer buffs actually made every killer somewhat viable (yes, even Freddy). Survivors can still escape, easily so in swf, and killers can actually kill. 
---
Every single change you've mentioned (except Legion and noed buff, that's just goofy) has brought the balance gap closer and closer. I think the only thing that needs changing now (besides noed, swf, and bugs) is the big buildings on maps. Some need better windows so survivors can actually maybe extend a chase (cough cough Yamaoka) and some need better ways for killers to get through it (cough cough Ironworks). 
---
The only thing proven by you listing all of the buffs to both sides is just how far some killers were in the shitter just a year ago. 
---
It doesn’t matter if it’s true lol
---
No. I'm sick of survivors getting nerfed again and again. 
---
Why don't the development fix Rancor as it often applies the deadly sentence in someone who doesn't have any obsession perk grenadier no survivor has any.
---
Went should the killer get free kill via a perk when survivors can't even get free second attempt at freedom? 
---
Doesn’t make them good
---
That doggo face scared the shit out of me. 10/10 mem 
---
Perk wise? Yes I think so. 
---
Did you not see me say hundreds of hours? Have you even read it? If not don’t comment, thanks!
---
Did u poke anyone? 
---
Congratulations, you can read.
---
I love you &lt;3
---
Nope
---
The downside is that it takes forever to heal, making you waste time healing yourself and risking exposing yourself to the killer (especially if they have A Nurse's Calling or perks like it).
---
Did they remove that? I thought at one point you wiggled faster
---
Hell yeah!
---
Woah I didn’t check my mistakes and there’s a lot... sorry guys I’m tired (and British if someone’s wants to know so badly)
---
nope, toxic killer mains dont like it when you want the game to be fair
---
This. They must've forgotten that this game is sold as an asymmetrical 4v1. What they don't seem to realize is, the four aren't meant to be the ones in power, but the weak ones. The 1 is supposed to be the powerful one.
---
Damn cheap ways to get blood points (or irredescent shards?)
---
I don’t think the game will ever be balanced...and I also think it shouldn’t be. The survivors should be the underdogs but not by a huge margin and they need to buff their BP gain for sure. This isn’t an esports game and it never will be its hide-and-go seek with serial killers and they should focus more on making it a fun, team oriented, and challenging(mostly for survivors) vs game instead of a balanced, esports wannabe vs game. I’ve been more and more discouraged from playing lately because everyone takes it so seriously. The devs also don’t seem to want to make the game fun...just competitive for whatever reason. Also they seem way too scared to release fun, innovative maps deciding to stick with bland and boring to make it balanced...But that’s just my opinion.
---
Trick question, Asymmetrical games can and never will be balanced, the best we can hope for is an ever changing meta (updates are to few and far between for this)
---
If he wanted to block you off he should’ve blocked up the stairs
---
NOED does have counters. However, all of them make for really boring game play. 
---
I do love spending the match hunting around for dull totems and then NOED still triggering because my teammates weren't destroying any.
---
« Phew, finally made it to the exit gate. Now lemme take 14 minutes to open it »
---
With the original obsession. Now, focusing on other people besides them risks changing the obsession back and forth, making the killer waste time leaving the new obsession to go to someone else.
---
"came up before I'd ever been hooked"
---
That's the old way it worked, and does right now.  The upcoming change will make it so you can only use it if you have been saved from a hooked and downed again within 60 seconds.  Turns it from a stupid get out of jail free card to an anti-tunnel perk
---
Am I missing something?
---
I mean it is counterplay, I think eating it is much better and easier as a killer, and even if a killer eats it I’m much less salty then if I get juggled to hook lol. Tbh just run enduring or something and hit the survivor again.
---
&gt;The problem with noed is that i can be doing just fine running the killer, getting a gen, and some dull totems, but when dipshit McGee over here can kill me because he’s terrible at the game and can only get kills because of noed it’s just discouraging to me.
---
Sounds like you're just salty NOED exists. Just because you did the fifth gen and are good at running the killer, doesn't mean the game is over. 
---
At what point in this game's history has Dead by Daylight ever had more active streamers and viewers?
---
if your watermark detracts from the art or meme, it’s a bad watermark. 
---
 Some time I can't even hear the huntress lullaby just her terror radius
---
Well she didn’t not on the game but on the dev stream I watched she did they didn’t implement it ;-; 
---
Freddy is getting reworked anyways so there’s no reason to leave perks overtuned because of one bad killer
---
People only consider NOED a crutch because they're too lazy to cleanse all the totems.
---
Wait what the fuck I thought I was the only person? 
---
His perks have the problem of the Hex and V.O.I. each doing half of what OfA/AfO do, while that perk itself doesn't last very long or could only affect 2 at a time. Also his power might help locate survivors, but it doesn't really help in chase or to slow the game down. 
---
If his gimmick is audio based and he has a relation to the Doctor, add auditory hallucinations to his power like how the Doctor has visual tricks (ie fake survivor moans/screams, random skillcheck noises, vaulting/pallet drop noises). It can be triggered by when using his power he uses a bell or tuning fork-like apparatus that can send a projection of sound (like the Doc's shocks) that can inflict Tinnitus and each stage causes more random sounds.
---
As for his perks, I like the Hex but possibly change it to how it sounds like when the Hag uses Disfigured Ear (overall sound decrease instead of just affecting terror radius). As for Verge, tying it back to the Doc again where he has Overcharge, maybe have it where if when you kick a gen that the next survivor repairing gets a silent skillcheck. Lastly OfA/AfO, it's effects only last for a few seconds and only get applied to 3, maybe 2 survivors. Maybe have it so when in a chase with the Obsession or not the Obsession (whichever), it will lower the volume of the chase music and persists for 1/2/3 seconds after losing chase. So now you can hear survivors a bit easier if one is following for a flashlight/pallet save, if you get juked, or are near noisy objects such as rustling corn or a repaired gen.
---
Just a few thoughts, take them as you will.
---
[Insert burn]
---
I actually like the idea that the amount of dull Totems left is the amount of survivors exposed. That way it punishes survivors for not cleansing all totems but if someone cleansed half of them it wouldn’t punish the whole team. 
---
And I think it does.
---
It seems we have come to an impasse. 
---
Step 1: Play killer since release, know that noed is a crutch for bad players
---
Step 2: Some random who apparently needs that crutch disagrees
---
Step 3: ???
---
He’s on top of the rock and the killer can’t get him.

I think your high, have you not heard them complain about hit boxes and so on and how this game is terrible in it’s state, have you not heard them say they are so used to apex. It’s pretty obvious these people are turning from dead by daylight right now, not forever, but no since it’s bad state. The player count has been lower as well if you’ve been paying attention. Some streamers are streaming it just because that is their main area of people watching. Do I need to clip them talking shit about this game?
---
Wait wait wait, does that mean Nicolas Cage is the next survivor with the bee!??!?!??!??????!!?!!! Best chapter ever!!!!!!!!
---
Is there not a path way up or am I Just being stupid?
---
Well for one it’s bannable, and two the killer can get up there too
---
This will also stop DS stabs to get the hatch. Devs, please hurry with the DS change.
---
It’s just a karambit 
---
Very true. When I first started playing I thought exposed meant the killer could see where I was 
---
That’s Claudette, not tall grass

NuH Uh hE'S oP aS hEcC

It’s probably shroud of separation :P

I can’t wait I love how the devs are sorta listening to the community now

Strongest Survivor: Balanced Landing

Weakest Survivor: No One Left Behind
---
Strongest Killer : Ruin
---
Weakest Killer: Third Seal
---
I honestly feel really stupud right now
---
I love going super altruistic in a group fast paced fun, had a game with a Michael like that earlier!
---
Ignoring the shitty hitboxes and other issues that fuck survivors it’s pretty decently balanced. ATM tho is favors killers a lot because of issues with how the game runs 
---
But should every game be noob friendly ? I mean let's take a over used example, Dark Souls isn't noob friendly at all yet people like it. A LOT of management games aren't noob friendly, they push you to understand the game and discover it on your own. I think it's really debatable, I understand why you would want to change it, but I think there are also arguments for it to stay this way.
---
Can't really complain since it'll stop a lot of tunneling :v
---
I spoke from a survivor POV to help OP understand. If we're talking as a killer I personally used to really like NOED on myers but I like having other perks more now.
---
Being on the other end of these things before, I try to avoid tunnelling playing as killer.
---
Think about what day April 1st is.
---
Having two shitty mechanics instead of actually fixing the problems sounds like an awful idea.

---
I don't know how productive it is to debate NOED's strength anymore, I'm sure we both know all the talking points by now, but more importantly it isn't going anywhere. Not while there's still no secondary objectives that can slow matches down. BHVR clearly sees it as a necessary evil right now.
---
&gt;Say you find 4/5 totems and it still spawns, you now have the hardest to find totem holding NOED.
---
​There's no "hardest to find" totem; you're no more likely to run into the flaming hex when 4 dull totems were cleansed, than you are when none of them were. In fact, you know where *not* to waste time searching if you were cleansing them in the first place.
---
Play Civilisation.
---
Enjoy my low effort meme.
---
If you get ds'd when gates are open it's already game over for the killer anyway. You lose a lot of distance and chances are small you catch up quick enough.
---
Are the status effects explained anywhere in-game? I looked them up on the wiki, and that was when I started to notice and understand the in-game effects. It always seemed strange to me to not have them explained anywhere in-game, but I may have missed them.
---
So a killer did their job using their balanced kit and sacrificed you so you blame it on the killer being OP and not... *user error*
---
;^)
---
Absolutely. I really don’t understand how people can be against this just being baseline. I guess it pretty much is a giveaway as to who the people who rely on NOED are! Cause if a killer doesn’t use NOED, all this does is benefit them as survivors would become more interested in doing totems. Any time spent by survivors trying to prevent a perk the killer doesn’t even have is a big win for them.
---
I’d like to see this in one of my games one day, most I’ve ever seen is 3....maybe 4 once, can’t recall.
---
Nope boil over only makes the wiggle effect (left/right) more
---
Alright I am sending this to my friend who basically said this today. Thank you sir
---
Juggle.
---
Or burn it and chase them around for a second because they are still hurt and exhausted(if they have an exhausted perk) 
---
I'm no killer main but when i do play killer for a daily ritual and see an obsession I just stand there for them to  DS
---
Man I wish I could draw, some of you are so talented, this is adorable
---
You can't really earn bloodpoints or iridescent shards any faster aside from just playing the game more. Certain survivor and killer offerings will get you more bloodpoints for actions completed in the map, but that's really it.
---
There are two perks in the game, one for killer and one for survivor, that grant a small bloodpoint multiplier, but obviously you need to grind for the BP to earn them from their respective characters (and the superior perk - BBQ and Chili - is from a paid DLC, so rip).
---
**DISCLAIMER:** New-ish player so this has probably been suggested a million times before.
---
Maybe incorporate Dull Totems so the amount of 1HKO's depends on the amount of dull totems left?. \[IE: If there's only 2 totems left at the end of the match (one dull, one NOED hex) the killer gets two 1 hit knock downs etc.\]
---
Killer could see all totems throughout the match to be able to defend and survivors get a perk or item that allows to them to see the amount of totems left. 
---
This way the Killer can defend and have a decent chance at swaying the game to their favour but if Survivors ruled the match, they still have a decent chance at escaping too.
---
I remember back in the day I had my first game against Myers. I saw exposed pop up thought he could see me and got confused why I went down in one hit. Needless to say I started reading about status effects immediately. 
---
...?
---
Same goes for hatch.
---
But juggle isnt an effective counter cause its still wasting the killers time which is huge in a game like this. Where as with NOED one person can cleanse totems while the others are doing gens.
---
Repairing generators is the only way survivors can have a chance at getting out alive. Gates need 5 repaired gens to be powered, and powered gates need to be opened to escape. The objective is a step by step process where Step 2 can't be done without Step 1. Even if you're trying to get the hatch to spawn to escape, you need to repair at least a couple of gens. 
---
Something that I said in another thread: survivors can be very focused on cleansing totems, but if RNJesus decides to be generous, they can waste a lot of time just finding totems, as some of them are in really great spots. That's fine for other hex perks like Ruin and DH, but for an instadown like NOED, it's an issue. 
---
Imagine doing everything well in a survivor game: safe rescues, doing gens, cleansing a couple of totems, wasting the killer's time, only to be killed at the end because he can one shot you. What did I as a survivor do wrong? Pretty much nothing.
---
It's like downing a survivor as killer because you made a smart play and got him good. But then you get stunned by Decisive. What did you do wrong? Nothing either. You did everything right actually. Yet you get punished severely.
---
NOED, like Decisive Strike, rewards bad gameplay. Decisive gives you a second chance for making a mistake during a chase, and NOED gives you a second chance for not putting enough pressure on gens. Perks that rely on that should not even be a thing in this game anymore.
---
It all depends on what killer you play. If I play billy I don't use NOED because the chances of getting gates powered are much lower but if I play wraith then I'm definitely sticking NOED on.
---
Makes me sad knowing that some people will downvote this just because they don't like the legion ingame. 
---
Perfect
---
4 DS squads happen with relative frequency.
---
Well that wastes time for a survivor because they could be doing gens instead of searching for dull totems 
---
True but you still have 3 other survivors working on gens.
---
This is BHVR we talking about, might not be a bad idea to them lol
---
I agree with you, only exception imo would be if you t-bagged him and blinded him on every pallet, which a lot if DS users love to do.
---
The counter play is to go find the totem, or personally see to the destruction of all 5 totems yourself.
---
Totem counters are a no go, survivors do not need a buff to there overall efficiency while nerfing hex perks in the process. 
---
Frankly, I have never really seen NOED get complained about on its own without the thread having a hidden agenda to also talk about DS, if DS is finally balanced and the dust settles I don't see NOED being brought up much again. 
---
I imagine because most survivors reach a point where they cleanse totems they come across, and since 4 survivors are almost always going to spawn next to a totem and have the same idea to cleanse it, getting all totems is a cakewalk in the high ranks.
---
I had an idea in mind that all remaining dull totems in the trial will become a hex totem at end game and for every hit the killer does a totem will automaticly become dull again.
---
Certainly deserved. They've nerfed us Killers into the ground with really understanding what that can do to a game. 
---

If you NEED Decisive Strike to survive, you're not a very good survivor. 
---
Maybe I'm wrong? I'm sure the wiki has them all, very well explained too, maybe I'm confused and mixed the two.
---
If they don't have it ingame, they should. Actually it should've been explained mid-tutorial, not in a separate section anyway.
---
If me getting tunneled helps my team to win then I should receive points for that, no?
---
False, go to thier forum. Unless you have other obsession perk, or killer obsession perk, the obsession will not appear until ds have been used.
---
Lol if survivors are dumb enough to loop you on the vicinity of their hooked teammate it’s their own fault
---
Players debated DS for forever and it finally got changed.
---
As a killer main I'm fully on board with adding some sort of totem counter next to the gen counter. Or even just add it as a perk perhaps, and have the counter exist on the perk itself.
---
So you're upset that they changed a crutch into an anti-tunnel perk which also nerfs a poorly designed perk that encourages tunneling? 
---
I only see good things about this change and I play both survivors and killers (admittedly I play survivor quite a lot more).
---
Oh, the good old mind-numbing stupid survivor. I get many messages like this from this kind of people - they actually expect you to leave the hooked survivor when you clearly see 2 or all of them crouching around him for a save. 
---
That, or yell at me for  'camping' the ruin totem when I see them roaming around. Like, do you really expect me to close my eyes to your attempts to make me lose the game? Fuck no, I might not be a great killer but I'm not that stupid.
---
And... I think it's deserved. I usually use Teabagging as a way to greet other survivors, personally, but I will not the shit outta someone who behaves like this. Maybe an extra hit on the hook while I'm at it. 
---
Yeah I hate that. I like playing killer the most but play both sides quite equally, but I'm still a bit more biased towards killer. That's been changing though cuz of stories like yours as well as my own experience with really toxic killers who just make the game completely unfun or very frustrating
---
Get. the fuck. out of here.
---
The Killer is SUPPOSED to stronger than the survivor. This is an asymmetrical game where the killer should have power over survivrors. Of course it should be in a fair in a skillful way. If you want to counter NOED you can either break all totems you see or just look around a bit before going straight to the gate. DS had no counter except slugging or juggling (which is honestly an oversight the devs didn't see and said, "fuck it, leave it in"). And if you commit to chasing obsession and eat that DS, you'll end up with 1 hook and 2-3 gens left. 
---
Is there no way to edit the key binds?
---
Well, you could always look at it this way: a lot of people have been saying they wished for a second objective for the survs; now you can say that finding all the totems to get rid of NOED is that objective

DEEP WOUND INFLICTED
---
"all killers share the same lunge hit box and speed." I don't claim to be an expert on DbD mechanics, but I'm like 95% sure this is just an incorrect claim, or at the very least a misleading one. Maybe the hitboxes on lunges are technically the same size, but there are pretty large variations in lunge distance between killers. Try comparing spirit and hag's lunge distances, for example. Hag's lunge blatantly covers a lot more distance, and if you try to lunge with spirit at distances that would get you a hit on hag, you will whiff extremely frequently. Like I said, I'm not an expert, so maybe you're correct that the hitbox and lunge speed specifically are general between killers, but, practically speaking, when people talk about the "lunge hitbox," they are talking about the lunge's ability to connect with a survivor, which definitely varies between killers.
---
You've seen some shit
---
Doesn't really matter what you believe about NOED. The devs think its balanced. 
---
lol he 4ked us and still had the audacity to message me that shit at the end ahahaha 
---
I feel like if you're a SWF, you'll have the major advantage against most killers, (barring nurse or certain maps) and that the match is effectively yours to lose. 
---
If it's four random survivors I feel it becomes a lot more balanced as the lack of communication means more wasted time and less gen rushing, which also gives killers that don't run something like Ruin a much better chance. 
---
I don't think this is the type of game that will ever have perfect balance between the two sides, but I appreciate that the Devs do try their best with it. 
---
I still remember when it was so heavily survivor favoured that I basically stopped playing killer for awhile (I will never forget when they could self heal back to full before the killer attack recovery animation finished) 
---
Rank 1 means nothing, my cat could make it to rank 1 its easy as fuck.
---
There's other options and deeper one to resolve tunneling, get to the core to solve the tunneling, they're just scratching the surface to fix a problem, not digging deep to solve a problem or going to the core to solve it. 
---
That probably centers around the fact that most contentious issues have been sorted for so long that no one is bothered about them anymore. Pallet vacuums were a big issue for killers, then when the issue was fixed survivors were upset for a while, but eventually either left out of frustration or simply realized it was a net improvement.
---
The only truly divisive things now are NOED and DS.(as well a minority of people who stand by Legion as their problematic^TM fave) There will be little to rage and rant about once devs find a way to either incentivize cleansing dull totems, or change NOED in a way that makes it more interesting to play against than just: "oh, surprise, you got downed because you didn't have adrenaline/lose the killer/become immersed as soon as the late gen popped, and your team wasn't cleansing dull totems while you got chased, so now you're going to get camped and die"
---
Where did you get that picture? It looks high quality, like, from a video or something :)
---
I noticed that too, I think it has to do with rank reset cuz I noticed at red ranks I much more rarely get salty messages, but at mid ranks I'll get very salty or aggressive messages
---
Dying Light is completely unchanged if you don't aggressively tunnel after it's active.
---
Obs is free
---
Careful what you wish for. I'm seeing more late-game totems in your future. 
---
But seriously, expect NOED. Pretty much everyone runs it.
---
Or, how about go play fortnite instead since you clearly don't know what makes this game popular in the first place.
---
I was wondering that too initially but he said in another comment that it was for him using ds and that he didn't bm 
---
Yeah camping once the gates are powered, shit hut i suppose we cant ask for more.
---
BM'ing, totally unecessary.
---
I don't expect the match to get 4kills every match. But decent survivors can stall killer for a minute and you get DS'd and you get looped for another 30 seconds then you get 3 gens done while you hook one. Unless you have some kind of degree on human psychology and can win every mindgame and predect every survivor movement you always have to be stalled at least minute with decent survivors who have some skill. But if they have DS then killer will have to waste precious time again to chase them down and get them again. DS is a crutch perk because it uses up so much of killer's time. For every second you lose by the DS that's every second of gens progressing. Yes I know how to track and I know how to chase but as a human I can't always predict every survivor movement and even then they will always try to mindgame me and try to use up my time. You are saying that basic mechanics are good enough but unless you are some omnipotent killer player that can see every survivor movement DS will use a lot of your time and that usually marks diffrence between 2 gens done and 3 gens done.
