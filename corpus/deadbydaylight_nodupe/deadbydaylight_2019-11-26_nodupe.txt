Exactly. Idk if you were gaming at this time, but Billy mains remind me of the dicks on MW2 who would run One Man Army, Danger Close, and M203. Basically, they gave themselves infinite ammo + grenade launcher + increased explosive damage.
---
---
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right, at my rate he will be gone at 5 gens, I should stretch it out over the course of the game
---
Uh huh.
---
this is true but it still really sucks when you‚Äôre the one kill every single game you‚Äôre in.
---
its better than them licking your feet or insulting that you are a woman and you shouldnt be playing i guesd
---
I'm gonna assume noed.  Every survivor main on here shits on it whole running every crutch perk they can find.
---
So we are buffing nurse right? /s
---
I swear to God if more people start picking Freddy now because of this...
---
True
---
I did go into how, it was the next sentence. I outlined two major problems with sabotaging.
---
I got survivor rank 1 in 2 days of playing. Wanna know how to counter Corrupt Intervention? Walk to the nearest Gen you can work on, and watch your back in the opposite direction corruption occurred. I'm always so happy when I see killers take Corrupt over Ruin, because it's a survivor perk that killers can take to tell the survivors where the killer started on the map - which is a huge game advantage.
---

---
If you kill quickly the only survivor that makes the game interesting, you‚Äôll get bored with the other 3 until the game ends. Might as well enjoy the moan!

---
nah i think ill let you hang, maybe you can spend your time on the hook to figure out how to be less of a dickhead
---
Almost as if their in red ranks so they will try harder and 60% isn‚Äôt much that‚Äôs less than 3 survivors (assuming hook stages affect this)
---
Dunno lol, I hardly had like 6 perks to choose from in the first place haha, even though I come up against near full team swf‚Äôs who teabag and heal each other within a second, and I don‚Äôt use ruin. I‚Äôm supposed to further hinder myself haha, people have no logicüòÇüòÇ.
---
That's definitely a step in the right direction.
---
1. Hits are decided by what's seen on the killer's screen. Outside of bugs, if a hit connects on the killer's side, then the server considers it to have connected. Killer is unaffected by latency for this reason -- if you have an unusual whiff, it's not because of latency.
---

---
2. In order to get the information on where a killer is from the server, the server has to *have* that information first. The time it takes for the server to get that information is whatever the killer's ping is. Because there's a delay equal to the killer's ping for the server to get the information, and then a delay equal to the survivor's ping for it to be relayed to them, the actual latency a survivor is experiencing is *both* their ping to the server and the killer's ping to the server, which is always going to be greater than just their ping to each other.
---
I saw that and I feel like its big doubt especially for someone like wraith.
---
Shit, I have failed all of you
---
I was expecting a little lower like a Baron.
---
Oh definitely because of his sounds, not because he is shirtless...
---
Its good for my stress when I get decent teams, instead all I get is stupid people that look like they never played before
---
But yea maybe I should take a break but zi dont have anything else to play
---
I don‚Äôt know why BHVR decided to nerf Nurse and Spirit, obviously they needed buffs.
---
No she's there. Her back is facing the camera, you can slightly make out her brown jacket and blue beret
---
Not saving people off the hook is what creates dickheads
---
Soo maybe save them or they become dickheads
---
Team of four David‚Äôs üôÇ
---
They all have no mither ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I can listen to four David‚Äôs at once üôÇ
---
Hes sayinv that the situation that doesnt allow killers to have a chance at winning is a good swf
---
Since I don't see it anywhere on the stats page itself, I'm left wondering the following:
---
* What factor Disconnects played into these numbers
---
* Even if disconnects were not included, what factor people suiciding on hook within the first minute or so of the game has? Or maybe to calculate it better, people who just suicide on their first hook. I know both scenarios can be different but it's effectively a disconnect in terms of the impact it has on the rest of the game, with the exception it eats little bit more of the killer's time and destroys a hook. 
---
* Seeing when the kills occurred would also be interesting to know. Someone else mentions tying in generator stats and I'm all for that. Like, for example, when deaths are happening pre-5th generator completion, or when a 0k turns into a 4k because of people doing stupidly altruistic plays to mess with the killer.  
---
I could keep going on and on but stuff like this when they mention "stats aren't everything".
---
It doesn't and if you think dropping from a hill to gain some distance to get to another loop is an exploit then oh boy, I've got some bad news for you. The sad thing is that you actually think that it's the perk when the same loops you cry about can be run without balanced landing. The problem itself is the loop and not the perk. Killers vault animation takes to long to complete. Giving the survivors enough time to drop chase and you lose bloodlust and the loop continues. Your argument is a fallacy.
---
blendettes are hardly ever good players. they just hide until hatch spawns. I‚Äôll always let nice dwights go over a blendette who did no gens or saves.
---
damn i don‚Äôt know maybe contact xbox support?
---
No they don‚Äôt, the moderators of this sub aren‚Äôt the devs. They even specify in description, if you want to reach them go forums
---
#long fingers üòñ
---
Edit: everything else is great but I can‚Äôt unsee it
---
I was talking about you not the comment
---
And now that the perk Kindred reveals the killer if he's near the hook, these decisions can be made much easier.
---
right now. Always attack into it. You will get a weird inside a pallet hit with dedicated servers, and then the pallet stun will remove the recovery timer from hitting a survivor.
---
I used to always play David when I started. I ran no mither and dead hard because I liked how they sounded but I couldn't figure out how dead hard actually worked. I would end up using it thinking the exhaustion was my invincibility. I also thought being able to recover myself was the best thing ever and I wouldn't part with it for a very long time.
---
nah cuz see i dont believe in that type of argument. you were a dickhead before you got hooked. dont try and blame "oh well this person didnt do this so im a dickhead over it" like no dude. youre just a dick. if anything trying to shift the blame to someone else only illustrates this point better
---
It's difficult to really articulate what does and doesn't work because people are so different. However, one major thing is the mindset people carry into an experience. 
---
People who go into something with a negative mindset [what's the point, i'll fail anyways], end up accomplishing that exact thought process. There are different reasons why, such as due to stereotypes or, classically, the 'looking-glass self' where we make something come true that would otherwise not occur.
---
Understanding that this is, at the end of the day, just a game really helps to put into perspective what is and isn't important. Is it really worth getting riled up over a loss if rank reset is gonna happen anyways? Is it worth getting this emotional over something as simple as tea bagging? No, it isn't, but people out there have a difficult time making this distinction because it's a skill that takes practice to perfect. Survivor teabags me? Good for him, not going to let him affect me. Survivors are being toxic throughout the match and post game chat? GG WP, move onto the next one.
---
Mindset is a big part of what can push someone to succeed or anchor someone to fail.
---
My dream team. One can only hope.
---
Cow Tree, as well as the machinery, makes it really good for survivors who have balanced, or lithe, as well as the amount of pallets that spawn. 8-20, makes it a really good thing, as well as the only spots to truly catch survivors is in the corn, where a good hider could stay until the killer would be there. And the fact that most everyone runs some form of exhaustion perk, meaning once they're hit they can go zipping back to a great loop point.
---
if you mean on this sub I think you are seeing me removing posts since im a mod lol
---
I get what your saying but if we went by exactly what the statistics said then we should buff nurse for example. Thats why people are sceptical. Its good info sure, but statistics are always to general and include stuff that as a whole create a falshe picture
---
Ahem.
---
Nineteen.
---
I rest my case.
---
It is a great perk. You don‚Äôt have to use it all the time. It is like windows of opportunity. You can use it to learn points. Just use it every other game.
---
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting angry. If you took an introductory level Statistics class in college they would tell you the same thing
---
If my bbq doesnt go off you bet your damn ass that im looking around
---
I‚Äôve been on the internet long enough I genuinely couldn‚Äôt care less if they want to insult me. I do get annoyed when people try to suck up to me or hand me everything cause like... I don‚Äôt have a dick, I‚Äôm not handicapped lmao. Never understood that.
---
Blood warden is great when two downed survivors are crawling towards the exit and they think you're gonna have to choose between them. Hehe, fools. I can have everything.
---
Downvote simulator 2019
---
Not that much of a cliffhanger. Fox canceled Firefly, Starz canceled Ash vs Evil Dead.
---
LOOK OUT GUYS THE HUNTRESS HAS ANOTHER GUN
---
He still has strong pressure compared to most killers, who have a power that does not help in chases, where as he does. Using mind-games with teleporting is advance tips. Anybody can pick up Freddy without having trouble having to play him is what I mean.
---
You posted the same thing 27 minutes ago. It's time to do anything else besides play this game. Nothing in this game matters enough to be this upset about it.
---
its bc ranking up as survivor is so fucking easy anyone can do it. if they fix the ranking system higher ranks wont be so bad
---
I never run NOED. I find it useless. Sure it can "confirm 1 more kill". That's **IF** you can out mindgame the team of survivors that **already beat you**, **OR** the survivors were stupid enough to stay in the game after they've already won.
---
When there are so many other perks that are much more consistent to take instead. That you utilize from the beginning of the game instead of only the end.
---
Spirit is the killer everyone cry‚Äôs and disconnects against, she is the strongest but she‚Äôs also getting nerfed this coming patch so it‚Äôs tuff to really recommend her
---
That‚Äôs cause gens go to fast. Not enough time and maps are too big
---
You are in purple ranks too. If they‚Äôre all like you then I feel sorry for everyone who gets any purple rank.
---
Hawkins does have other benefits to it, of course.
---
The gates are always on opposite sides, traversing from one side to the other or from top to bottom takes a decent amount of time, the moving doors when someone passes by don't really aid the killer (they're near generators which the killer can hear already without needing the door moving) but do aid the survivors.
---
While ground-level loops are mostly unsafe, the pallet density makes it easy to move between them unless the killer does break them all, and the loops on the catwalks are generally pretty decent since those rooms tend to have 2 pallets inside and 2 immediately outside, with non-pallet vault points for Lithe and drops for BL.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's just a pain to navigate and enough of the generators (including the portal room IMO) aren't safe, so it makes up for the looping potential and the door locations, some of them make you run through 3+ rooms to even reach a pallet if you're repairing.
---
Freddy next killer?
---
Mate! In Australia I get minimum of 80-90ms and most case 120ms+ haha! That‚Äôs on cable connection not wifi and with the new network Australian government is laying out! I miss japan internet üòÇ

Most logical killer mains ive seen only complain for genspeeds anymore. Keep in mind i said LOGICAL.
---
For honor?
---
Well "always" except for all the times when you shouldn't lol.
---
Nobody;
---
People talking about the people talking about servers being down
---
Yeah pallet stand offs is a thing that happens in green ranks. Lol don't attack into them.
---
Oh wow! I didn‚Äôt know they were getting back together. Might have to join on listening again. Thanks :)
---
You will start with a cooldown. You will have two things that can both be used once before the reload. The things will be shot in a straight and will bounce from wall to wall for 20 seconds. If a survivor is hit by a thing, killer instinct will follow them for 5 seconds and they will be injured. Has a 20 second cooldown.
---
I was hoping he‚Äôd hook the last place.
---
Ok disgusting hetero
---
The broken should only be visible to killer after you‚Äôve recovered from dying state, then it‚Äôs just a knowledge game on killers side, you seen the no blood pools so you know it‚Äôs a no mither, or you wait until they recover then realise you done fucked up
---
Remembered this picture while being carried by Meyers today and couldn't stop laughing :D
---
So many shards!!! Haha
---
He wants a shirtless cosmetic as much as we all do, he is just venting.
---
Hell yeah
---
Honestly this makes so much sense especially in the last week I've noticed killers seem to have a halo 3 sword lunge(how I see it lol). It might also be just me but I feel like killers lately are super fast and that might have explained by what you're saying about the servers.
---
I tried it my first time and kobed
---
Have you ever played against a killer without ruin and the gens went flying and you thought, ‚Äúthis is kinda easy‚Äù? Exactly. Everyone knows gen speeds are broken, especially so for killers without mobility. On top of that add a swf group who can talk to each other and knows how to play just a decent amount to waste the killers time and you have a situation that‚Äôs almost impossible to win. Not to mention huge map sizes, toolboxes, keys... there are some games where you literally can‚Äôt do anything to win and it‚Äôs a problem.
---
Nani?!
---
It's not how it comes across. If anything I think emoting and t-bagging when you drop a pallet in a killer's face is rage baiting. Thinking the times it's been done to me I have to commend it for its effectiveness, think about the player's that do it they've either got the skills to pay the looping bills or the perks to make up for it (\*cough\* me \*cough\*). So if you can keep the killer on you while your gen dedicated survivors get to work you can save the team a lot of grief and beat the killer all the easier.
---
That being said I still hate it, I still think it's toxic, I can admit it works, even works well, but I still hate it and it still feels toxic whether it is or isn't by the community at large, even more so when it's levied vs my baby killer brother. I don't know maybe it's one of those scenarios where the survivor intends one thing, the killer sees one thing, and the game of telephone in-between completely distorts it. However above all else I can say with certainty the spamming of the t-bag is toxic. 
---
Sorry for the secondary rant, especially if it comes off incoherent.
---
Hi, red rank Freddy here. My favorite map is Hawkin's Laboratory and I don't know why people keep trying to tell me that "killers are bad in it".... I mean... The map spawns almost the exact same every single match - it's so easy to remember. Which is a huge home advantage for a killer imo.
---
Nice generalisation over a few bad games you had. Have my down vote kid.
---
You are right but playing against bubba is so rare this days ( especially face camping once) that I won‚Äôt use up 2 perk sluts just for him.
---
Lery's is pretty awful, so many windows.
---
I feel like I do indeed average more than 2 kills a game, it's just the 4-mans that really throw this trend out the window and remind me that how balanced the game is in my favor seems mostly a matter of skill (and I don't think red ranks = skill), it's pretty hard to even get one kill against a 4-stack without breaking out all the dirty addons and a mori.
---
I watched so much gameplay before I actually started playing. Noob3, tru3, and not Otzdarva taught me a lot so I had a rough idea on how the game went when I started playing.
---
Still doesn‚Äôt help me with getting looped though.

Also, start the pre match character camera swirl thing with jaws flopping, then fill the level up.

All the better. Then you've lost control and I've found your rage button.

You cant expose killers!

I mean, anything can happen later in the season, and with such a large sample size of matches and players, it's no surprise that high rank games can have frequent potato survivors.

My team called me a pussy for waiting at hatch while there was a noed lether face on the loose. Am I the bad guy?
---
Discordance I is my city.
---
'Trying to fix the problem'?
---
U mean, doing what they'r paid for in a job that they've chosen? Wow. They'r literally saints for doing that. 
---
In gaming industry situations like that just occur, every1 working in this field knows that. It's not like they sacrificed the most important day of their life to get servers going in some hero-ass style, they simply did their job.
---
I saw a good video about this. To Gamers, "political" is not in the common sense of the word. Rather, "political" refers to anything that is controversial. Therefore, LGBT people in my game? Well LGBT is controversial, so politics. Minorities, well they're controversial. 
---
Basically, anything gamers find controversial is politics.
---
You'd lose the way I described though. What I'm saying is when the killer only see's one person near a hook, goes after enough to make them run away, then goes back to the hook to camp with no reason to believe anyone is going after it. Camping will definitely fuck over an overly altruistic team, but doing it with a smarter team will fuck the killer over.
---
Oh no my job is to create animations for characters in a video game, let me just copy paste and call it a day even though our players pay us to do better.
---
See what he means? BHVR is too lazy to even resurrect him for the part, there really is no excuse.
---
I mean, there's only one kind of overtuned set of addons for billy for the most part, so it makes sense that he's done fine.
---
Aaand u won't see like 80% of them anyway cuz they'r garbage.
---
Playing for a couple years now. I still don‚Äôt know most of them by name.
---
[removed]
---
Lately I've been running both, as I test small game out. So far, small game is harder to find totems when it's a trap killer or in a 2 story map like meat packer
---
Damn BHVR tell entity hes fucking lacking.
---
Some say Otzdarva still looks at perks like that to this very day
---
why not hang around and force the killer to watch over you, giving others time to escape?
---
Something robotic or something with dolls.
---
Dunkeyyyyyyyy
---
Don‚Äôt be scared, be proud of the masterpiece that is your body. Show it to everyone, and to me. Being shirtless will make you better immediately.
---
Well aren't you just Satan I fucking wish I never learned about this game *insert nervous laughter*
---
I agree that Survs have more things to be rewarded in the pip system. 
---
You know the players would be more inclined to pip if there was some reward for ranking. 
---
At this point for someone like me. Kills and pints and how I feel about the match are all that matter. Depip, no pip or double pip means nothing. And that's a problem in my eye.
---
One time I was in an Xbox party that I had found via group post. I was playing wraith and I hooked a guy in the basement and as I‚Äôm leaving someone passes right by me towards the guy I hooked so I downed him, then the other two come in so I start hitting them, once they were all down they started screaming that I‚Äôm a camper.
---
So satisfying as survivor, so discouraging as killer haha
---
Stats released by Behaviour indicate the Freddy is the best performing killer at the moment. I would recommend watching videos of the killers' playstyles, and choosing the one you think you'd like the most.
---
The Automation, maybe the entity plucked some faulty robot from an alternate dimension or the future. Time isn‚Äôt really relevant in whatever world DBD takes place in. Nice idea.
---
Twitter was flooded with this crap as well. Yeah it sucked but shit happens sometimes. I think people were annoyed as a whole tho, because on a normal day, it takes a good chunk of time to get a match. (It's taken me 25 minutes to search for a match once.) I can see being slightly annoyed or irritated but just because a game is down a day I don't think equates to us getting free stuff. Just my opinion: I just wanna play.
---
This happened within a matter of like 30seconds
---
A *very* slight difference, it's hard to call seeking employment 'voluntary' in those countries considering they're just barely avoiding starvation and would probably die otherwise; it's like the difference between cooperation and consent (something that really fits into DbD discussions considering the nature of the killers).
---
People can be broken and downtrodden into doing things out of desperation, suffering abuses of all sorts, you can torture someone to the point they'll kill their own family for relief, but it doesn't make the employment in those countries something they would choose if they had an alternative.
---
If you want a fast game you bring NOED instead of Ruin. Survivors can‚Äôt help themselves but to get gens done as fast as they can. Sure they will be trying to cleanse dull totems but chances are they‚Äôll miss a couple because they‚Äôre in a hurry. 
---
All the better if they open the gates because all actions during endgame are worth more BP. If you don‚Äôt camp and just continue to down people and swap hooks you rack up all your BBQ (if you haven‚Äôt already) super fast. 
---
Really I think sometimes survivors would prefer NOED instead of going on yet another Ruin hunt. The saves and chases are more intense and more gratifying during endgame IMO.
---
Stop with the ‚Äúnerf this killer because they have the potential to win‚Äù it‚Äôs getting annoying af
---
"The cycle continues" mob of the dead
---
Wrong. It has to be xbox game store. If you plan on sharing dlcs, get the xbox game store dlc. Dont use cells.
---
Behavior literally released the map stats not too long ago with survivors not having really any favored maps. Maybe a little over 50% but not too far half.
---
Killer tho? EXTREMELY high win rates on the indoor maps.
---
But they also included the average of all ranks combined. Everyone is still nearly 60%, with the exception of Nurse being below 50%.
---
Well Im a music student so I hear a lot of thinks. Im always been more on metal/prog metal/post rock but also I eat a lot of classical music, specially Takemitsu and ravel. Also Im a classical guitarist so take that on account.
---
A real butt-clenching moment
---
You just described Oni.
---
Adrenaline. It's saved my life at least five seperate times, and to have run the killer around for the last two gens, and finally getting hit at the end, just to see that last gen pop, and sprint away at max speed.
---
What, you mean like three people on your team that can unhook you once the killer leaves or distract them/use borrowed time/take hits for you when your DS can activate out of a locker if the killer decides to tunnel anyway?
---
And then they unhook you without BT before the killer even gets a chance to leave? That's called the survivors making mistakes and forfeiting their counterplay, getting a chance to counterplay their surrendering of counterplay isn't fair to the killer.
---
Freddy is hands down the 3rd best character in the game. Imo of course
---
Yea man because if I disagree with you it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm bad at the game
---
So just don't farm people off the hook? Ez.
---
I primarily play as Survivor, but I‚Äôm also relatively new to the game on Xbox and looking for friends to play with. Feel free to hit me up GT mom3nt0fzen

Wholesome
---
With trapper all you really need to finish trap all the safe loops, you don't need a bag for that, it certainly helps but a map only has like 4 MAYBE 5 100% safe loops and trapper starts with 10 traps I think base kit
---
But servers priotize survivors in hatch escape and grabbing cases \^\_\^ You can't no longer spam space on hatch, survivor jumps in first and there's nothing you can do about it. With grabs, they are getting worse and worse every patch and they are super trash since dedicated. How many times have you done a grab animation but instead hit survivor? What's worse sometimes you do the animation, grab doesn't work AND you don;t even get a hit and stay for a second completely confused.
---
You completely dodged the comment with basically just saying you‚Äôre just salty that you‚Äôre bad at the game.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it take longer to cleanse 5 totems than to have ruin cleansed immediately?
---
Oh please no not my zappy boi... They're gonna rework his "addons" :(
---
You‚Äôre literally the best thanks man :)
---
I thought - and really I can't quote why - that consoles/'smart' TVs accepted bluetooth keyboards and mice for input by default now, I know someone who used their TV like a low-powered computer in this way for basic web browsing and business work, as strange as that sounds.
---
Of course while I own a console myself, I still question their popularity since the games for them are a huge budget sink compared to PC (I mean yes you can spend more on PC because we have a broader library, but game for game...)

Thank you I found it, it is background YouTube music people use. My life has been secured once more and am not left with another mystery.

What scene and movie I‚Äôm curious?
---
THE KILLERS POWER:  
---
The killers power is called *Mistaken Hunt*. The killer can let out a call that creates the illusion of crows into humans. However, the aura of the crows is revealed to you, aswell as the survivors aura. When in a chase, use your second ability, *Slice,* too instantly break a pallete with your sharp nails. This ability, when used on survivors, applies a deep wound effect. (its lame but we can change it as time goes on :D)

New Survivor: Jenna Reed.  
---
Jenna Reed is a photographer from Brazil. She is fluently bilingual in english with a slight accent. She was always introverted. She never liked talking to people, and was usually considered a 'lone wolf'. Jenna loved postcards, and wherever she went she took a postcard and would admire it endlessly. Beauty was her 'forte'. She was gorgeous, and everyone loved her, but her introverted personality held her back from the fame of being a model. So she did the next best thing, become a photographer. One faithful day, however, Jenna went on a trip that would change her life. She was taking pictures of mountains, when she strayed off into the darkness,  being consumed by it.
---
Perks:  
---
Fluency: You go with the flow, and understand everything. When the exit gates are powered, the killers aura is revealed to you for (10, 20, 35) seconds. This perk increases your chances of becoming the obsession.
---
Beauty: When the killer comes into line of sight with you in the match, the killer is stunned for (0.5, 1, 1.5) seconds. 
---
Photography: You bring perseverance or whatever you want for the goal. When the killer hits you next to a generator, that generator is highlighted for (1, 5, permanent) minute(s). 
---
New Item: Camera  
---
The Camera allows you to take a quick photo with flash on, stunning the killer quickly. The flash takes a total of 0.5 seconds to charge up, and has a cooldown of 1 minute. This consumes one of (2, 3, 4, 6) charges.

You are literally saying your anecdotal evidence is better than their raw data. That is just impressive.
---
Right. Which you're maximizing the likelihood of by tapping.
---
Mike only gives hatch to Shirtless David. Then you get Daddy comments.
---
Love this! I absolutely adore her fingers for some reason. They‚Äôre perfectly her and subtly creepy.
---
Did you get a word of the day calendar or something? Why is everything a fallacy?
---
It‚Äôs cute lol. Nice meme
---
It's really not. Monitor allows you to get into stealth modes as both pig and ghostface before the survivors hear you are all if you pair it with whispers.
---
when i first started i was just hugging the exit gate in fear for my life
---
One "bug" which was present was for Pig sometimes picking up survivor made her "slightly" if even faster. And then some stealth tweaks which increased her crouch time etc.
---
Top 5 V I B E S
---
#1: Clown, he just be vibin
---
Stop being a low rank bad. Stop thinking you know everything. There‚Äôs a new ghostface meta that makes him top tier now whether you believe it or not. Try the build and you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs much better than the stupid shit you are proposing.
---
The statistics don't show the game is killer favoured, they show killer have more than 50% kill rate.   
---
That includes NOED kills, alrtruistic suicides at the end etc etc. I don't wanna say that the game is survivor sided but you can't state that the game is killer favoured just because of those statistics.
---
I have my team died a lot of times because everyone wanted to rescue that one guy facecamped during the EGC and I killer a lot of teams by facecamping one survivor after all the gens were done. It's not a fun way to play but what ur gonna do. Usually Entity Displeased or barely black pip tho while 2-4 survivors pip up.
---
O H M Y G O D
---
So anyway I started blasting
---
Bing bong your opinion is wrong
---
Statistics like this are never a tell on their own, it's really important to how the data is collected and what might lay underneath. In this case it's so high in red ranks because it's only people who can maintain that kill rate, meaning everyone who can't drops out of red ranks.
---
Would be a lot of work to do, but good idea
---
Not possible, it‚Äôs a cypress mori
---
If the broken thing make weak killer like pig slightly stronger then yes its kinda nerf
---
First of all, Im not discussing if billi deserves nerfs or not. If you read your own post, the hole point is that Billy needs changes because he has been always on the top 3. Your hole point is "billi is doing as well as freddy but due to the long time hes being top tier he needs nerfs". If we talk exclusively about balance (wich is what we should do) then this comparison is wrong. And that was what I was answering.
---
Now you can say that Freddy takes more skill tham billi, and then I would say:
---
1. By this logic, the old nurse was OK.
---
2. My fucking ass. Billi is easily looped. You can do some tricks for loops, like curving or fake rev, but it also takes skill. Is not just pointing your chainsaw and killing, you need to be really good at mindgames and curving if you wanna catch up the better survivors. Otherwise, you are only a M1 killer. I know billi can kill you super easy, but its just because you are bad.
---
So my point was that you can not argue for a billis nerf according to this graphic without doing the same for Freddy. But because you like Freddy you used a stupid argument about "always being in the top" in order to defend your bad logic because you didn't want to say "nerf billi but oh ok nerf Freddy too because hes doing just like him".
---
And that was my point. I didnt say anything about if he's balanced or not.
---
Also, in your last post, you didn't have an argument. You just described what billi can do and compared them to other killers. This doesn't mean anything. This could mean that the other killers should be buffed to the billis level, and not the opposite, because describing him you are not making any point.
---
Also, just because a killer does pretty well with bad survivors, doesn't mean hes op. Doc can DESTROY any team at grey ranks. Just because billi does the same at green doesnt mean hes op.
---
We need to take a closer look at the top level of playing. And then maybe
---
Well, it's fine to mention something you feel ameliorates the problem, but the concern is definitely more about the feel of the game in general than my personal profit.
---
A lot of people clearly feel there's a win/lose binary present, and escaping being worth a massive amount of points with no in-between likely contributes to that a lot. Even if people can farm BP as Survivor, that won't go away.
---
I think it's cuz the survivor was as close to it as they were. If you're both on the hatch like that you can't close it but they can't jump in because you body block each other from it
---
Yeah, some of the Moris in the game are really boring and some killers like Oni, Hag, and Demo have really good moris it‚Äôs boring seeing the same thing over and over again
---
But only 5 seconds of light
---
I‚Äôve been reading comments here and elsewhere recently and it seems that is most peoples experience also.
---
In general he seems to be the most toxic of all killers. Not surprising though that toxic players gravitate towards the killer that can tbag. Pig doesnt really count since hers is too slow
---
Borrowed Time, most of the time I‚Äôm always super altruistic so normally the killer tunnels the survivor I saved but they have endurance so they could loop them another gen.
---
This game is so difficult to be a new player in that I‚Äôm surprised anyone still gets it and sticks around anymore honestly.
---
I came in blind too, didn't even notice there was a tutorial, and it's still one of my favorite horror experiences ever. I had no idea what the hell I was supposed to do, didn't even know what the goal was, and I was so fucking scared. I remember it fondly, but in retrospect my teammates were probably *furious* at me.
---
It's from the 2007 remake directed by rob zombie it's essentially a retelling of the original movie with the exception of the fact that it offers a little bit more into Michael having an abusive family rather than just him being the embodiment of evil that the original film was going for.
---
 It's not as good as the original but if you like the Halloween franchise I honestly recommend still checking it out because it has its own merits.
---
 One of which being that it explains Michael being a killer instead of just trying to justify it by saying he was possessed The original franchise went for after 3 movies
---
Nobody was talking about the hills. We‚Äôre talking specific structures, good example being Myers house.
---
Yes they can be run without Balanced too but balanced makes them even stronger.
---
Not saying this as a ‚ÄúHAHA I TOLD YOU‚Äù just thought youd want to see this. 
---
New stats are out and the Game is still the 2nd deadliest map for survivors.  [This is from November 22nd](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/106566/)
---
Was still worse with p2p connection. Now killers can't purposely throttle their internet for free kills, and survivors can't lag switch to teleport away. And, oh yeah, less cheating.
---
Hag. She can teleport to traps and can be really S Tier if used correctly. Every time I versus her it‚Äôs honestly a game over already cause almost all hag players are good in high ranks.
---
A  good survivor perk would be
---
Suicide is badass. As soon as you die on hook/Mori, a random gen will go up by 50%
---
For real? How is it working now? Sorry must of missed that.
---
I guess people just hate the facts
---
Legion is fun.
---
Everyone only truly cares for themselves lol he woulda thought you were an idiot for saving and wouldn‚Äôt even think twice about going back to rescue you
---
This is the reason. Idk why the license holders wouldn't want a company to promote their films, especially if they're old.
---
Maybe thing 1 can be used for damage in chase as you said and thing 2 could be used to debuff survivors. Maybe thing 2 could annoy survivors and slow their gen/heal speed etc and to get rid of it they have to put the thing back in a box? (Kinda like freddy/pig)
---
This is so fuckin good.
---
So they've existed for a long time but just very rare. Strange how after 2 years of playing I'm only seeing my first one.
---
\*Giorno's theme starts playing\*
---
"I, Dwight Fairfield, have Adrenaline."
---
Mmm, whatcha saay~
---
Oh it's just a meme? Okay, it's fine that it is blatantly incorrect and definitely does not represent the opinion of the poster at all. Can't wait to see this exact same epic joke tommorow!!!
---
I usually run spinechill, so stealth killers aren't too bad for me, but the plague and legion can be annoying. Healing for the majority of the match or just staying injured since you'll either be broken or get deep wounds anyways can get repetitive pretty quickly.
---
because people that make a single post on a forum for a video game are supposed to be useful
---
A fix for moris and keys would be that you can only mori people on their death hook and that the hatch only spawns when 5 gens are done or 1 survivor's left.
---
Animations take way too long to do 3 for each killer based on perks for free. 9 could definitely see mori's being something you can purchase in the store to customize your killer some.
---
Yes these two things definitely balance out. :)
---
Its funnier when bubba has his chainsaw revved
---
If you‚Äôre straight you aren‚Äôt political and if you‚Äôre gay, you are. How hard is that to understand. People these days.
---
Lmao I love that graph. ‚ÄúAnnoying twat‚Äù sums him up.
---
Hopefully people go after this twat next now that nurse and spirit have been nerfed. Hes needed the changes more than spirit ever did.
---
wait, did the original release not have the wall of texts tutorials? Thats been there as long as i remember, before the playable tutorial was added.
---
This is the high quality content I look for here on /r/deadbydaylight
---
Idk who that is but she‚Äôs ugly as fuck in both pictures. No disrespect ü§™
---
Yeah. I thought that you could purchase them with iri shards or bloodpoints and they would appear in the store. But some killers really do need a new mori as their current one is really bad
---
The jump boost animation fuckin killed me 
---
*just like NOED*
---
It really do be that way
---
Ive faced and played Billy in lerys. Granted his mobility is hindered, but his chainsaw sure as hell isn‚Äôt.
---
üëÄüëÄ
---
Of course as of now I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs that good of a killer the only good thing about him is his lunge
---
If they were always on opposing sides, it would favor the survivor on big maps though. And I'm not sure if that's a good thing. Don't get me wrong, I play both sides and know how frustrating it is if you have to go through these last minutes without any chance to escape. On the other hand, at that point the killer sucessfully killed 3 people and found the hatch first. Both sides get an equal chance to find it. If the killer gets there first, he should be at an advantage. 
---
The way it's now, it's problematic on the survivor side. But if it's too easy to still escape, killers will often feel cheated out off 4ks. It's hard to do both sides justice there :/.
---
I actually think mechanic David is hotter üëÄ the rolled sleeves, the open shirt... I‚Äôm melting
---
Maybe, just MAYBE the base kit changes to nurse were not fucking necessary BHVR. No one asked for them.
---
Wait did Natalia Dyer actually get something with her DBD character on it?
---
He doesn‚Äôt even need the gas cand. Just a cooldown so he cant sprint from one gen to the next. No other mobility killer can do it so why can he? Especially since unlike the rest he has unlimited instadowns all game every game
---
Thanks! I googled it after I read your comment and I feel like a real dummy. I just chalked the Shape's one-hit killing up to the double damage he also gets at Tier III Evil Within....
---
The worst is trapper and wraith.
---
And you can't attack them with it, just shine it
---
See I disagree, on Michael I run NOED for it's movement speed buff more than anything. That, along with STBFL and PWYF, gets me almost always a 4k. Not having Ruin or Corrupt Intervention to slow down gens, I know that most teams will get all five gens done. But having a strong endgame as Michael is what wins me the trial in the end.
---
Lol hello again. Yeah, it seems that all these clowns care about is "CaN i LoOp ThEm? YeS? THEN THEY'RE BALANCEDREEEEEEE!!!!11"
---
If you want to get her prestige cosmetics then you‚Äôll have to prestige her
---
Most people dont know either. Behaviour just hate piggies? Playing too much of angry birds
---
&gt;hugely skilled killers 
---
Yeah that's not it chief.
---
I personally think the effeciency penalty is overblown. While yes it's technically more efficient to all work in separate generators I think it's more complicated than that. If you look at the numbers the time "wasted" is very small less than 20 seconds. The effeciency penalty really only impacts the game when there's more than 2 people on one gen. 
---
I think the important thing to note is that while technically less efficient, 2 survivors working on the same gen is faster, giving the killer less time to potentially inturrupt them, and if they are inturrupted, the killer can't stop both of them unless they manage to down one quickly and chase the other. Outside of that scenario the gen is guaranteed to be worked on when the killer commits to one survivor. Whereas when working on a gen alone, that lone survivor is forced off and the gen won't be completed, especially not if the killer kicks it before committing to the chase. The only thing preventing that gen from being wasted is if the survivor that's chased away is in a swf
---
Um, the reasoning behind it is irrelevant, its still camping.  However, camping is still a valid strategy unless its done to troll.
---
He's currently the best Killer in the game, based on BHVR's graphs lol.
---
You can play claudette with bright clothes. Then she is just as visible as others. Nobody forces you using dark clothes.
---
I'm in the complete opposite boat. The memes here are absolute garbage most of the time, but I think the game is actually pretty decent!
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
;)
---
Well i feel like games in red ranks are very situational.It is effected alot by the map you get and also the pallet and loop spawn rng.there are actually alot of maps in the game that has very inconsistent pallet spawns and loops which makes alot easier for the killer.However it could also spawn so much pallet and jungle gyms which will make alot easier for the survivor.Thats why all the indoor maps are the deadliest,especially the hospital map since there are no consistency in the loop location on that map at all.except for the centre area of the map and the library room.Also apart from the game map the other indoor maps tend to have alot of unsafe pallets  apart from few god pallets.which i don't know if its intended theme by BHVR but thats the case.
---
I am uncomfy with this xD but good job
---
slenderman be like
---
It isn‚Äôt utilised all that much which is a shame
---
Yeah. I thought that maybe it could be like FT13 where the kills are right next to each other like perks and you can choose which kill you wanted to perform on the survivor
---
Thank you!
---
üíú
---
I did my job
---
mmf
---
I cant speak to all survivors but heres my thinking when i see it
---
"Oh a secret offering, probably a shroud"
---
"Damn that guy got 2 hook- wait why is he standing up. OH SHIT"
---
"Its ok, probably a weaker mori, not red"
---
*sees 2nd survivors get killed after 1st hook* " Fuck this shit im out"
---
And then this happen 800 more times u came to conclusion that Killers only use Enony mori when they want to be a dick to relieve theirn
---
Who hurt u
---
Did my job then. Wanted him to look m o i s t
---
You get bloody skins and better items at lower levels the higher your prestige. If only worry about prestiging your main if you want the bloody skins otherwise don't worry about it. Once you get everyone to 40 and have all teachables unlocked just keep rolling your main to get all perks
---
Nurse and spirits get stomped in green ranks.
---
Billys dominate and often 4 man 4/5 gens remaining in green ranks.
---
But no its spirit thats the one that people pick up and win with apparently...
---
I‚Äôve played a hell of a lot of this game at all ranks and Billy is consistently the most ‚Äúoverperforming‚Äù. You NEED good survivors to beat Billy. A medicore billy will crush a survivor team of the same skill level. Hes too easy to use given the strength he has.
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Very unique. I love listening to legend of Zelda music :)
---
Ok, no *smart* Killer is going to do that at least.
---
I only prestige because the character feels complete to me when I get them to prestige 3 and then I started getting every perk on them once reaching prestige 3. It‚Äôs also cool to get the bloody cosmetic outfit as well.
---
Wym by interact with gens ? Those things do something ?
---
WutFace nooooooo
---
You could only have these popups happen for people with less than 20 games on Killer or something like that. They already do it with loading screens and giving warnings about killers to new survivors after all.
---
Legends say he is still opening Lockers upstairs to this very day
---
Well considering that hormonal therapy can (but doesn't always) render someone's sperm sterile (sometimes permanently even if they stop the therapy) and the use of their relevant-to-breeding body parts in genital changes, I was assuming that whether one was trans wasn't really relevant.
---
Sure you can use a sperm bank before starting to transition, but then you're talking about artificial insemination, which kind of makes the point of personal procreation rather abstract since anyone with a functioning womb can make use of artificial insemination regardless of gender identity or relationship status ;)
---
Also that seems a lot more technical than just saying one has a dick. :P ~~And I think about this.~~
---
Yee! She loves it and being in the game, apparently.
---
Freddy is fine. L2P.
---
It‚Äôs both but seems to be more survivors as you literally just proved
---
They already tried this, led to a new form of griefing of just keeping someone on the hook indefinitely.
---
Yeah, it must be really hard for new players nowadays, i started in 1.3 and we didnt have that many maps, killers or any status effects, now the game is way more complex
---
There's really no reason to, most prestige skins are trash.
---
If you have a decent amount of good items/addons on her I wouldn't prestige.
---
That's a nice Blendette suit.
---
This just happened to me in my last match, while running alongside her. Spooked me at first lol
---
Most of the windows are painfully useless for survivor ever since they reworked the window spawns in that map like 2 years ago.  Most windows have wide open doorways next to them allowing for easy cutoffs without skipping a beat.  The office area is good and the middle room has potential if you know what you're doing but that's about it.  On top of shitty defenses for survivor they have to deal with difficult to find totem and gen spawns.  I assume a 3K or better on Lery's in my games.
---
You are factually wrong. Post nerf nurse is the third worst killer.
---
Hey, it's just a concept lol. This is my personal vision for the character.
---
Why can't ya'll do this when im killer?
---
But you cant say that the doors position attribute to kill rates like this.
---
It could be the entire map causing the numbers instead of just the doors
---
So do you get a better grade in math class if there are more questions on the test?
---
As a p3 Nancy main, I'm proud to represent on the battlefield
---
i‚Äôm gonna get the cosmetic asap, he went off
---
You can literally run the Myers house without balanced landing the same way as if you did have it. Your point is moot.
---
Sometimes its weird that survivors jump out fast once you arrive at their locker ready to open it.
---
Like okay? ill just grap you that way then. Also it denies that ABSOLUT GLORIOUS szene where the survivor is totally in shock over being found whilst you pull em out, so i am slightly dissapointed to miss that now, especially since the result, as states, stays the same
---
Closing in on 1000 hours, had to look up the Oblivious status a few days ago.
---
legend says ghost face is still opening the lockers up to this moment
---
Though it is surprising that kill rates are over 50% on all three of these maps.
---
Strange, that doesn¬¥t look like Sloppy Butcher at all
---
It's definitely interesting. Unfortunately hes probably a top 4 or 5 killer so its likely they wont ever touch him again
---
absolutely not, i would only recommend it on survivors/killers that only have one cosmetic (bloody version looks interesting). otherwise there‚Äôs no point, it‚Äôs just another way to show off and have expensive bloodwebs.
---
I mean he can technically be looped, his broken chainsaw hitbox permitting but not every survivor is going to be able to do that for so long.
---
Now sure a killer shouldn‚Äôt be nerfed due to shit survivors, but in all these cases the hillbillys aren‚Äôt pros and are on the same skill level as the survivors. The survivors all need to be of a higher skill level than the hillbilly, which goes back to what we were saying about him being too easy to use for how strong he is. A killer that strong needs to be harder to play. Noobs struggle with nurse, spirit, huntress etc because they‚Äôre slow as shit.
---
https://youtu.be/_8wajXYC5kU
---
This Otzdarva video is a good example of why Billy is busted. He gets destroyed all game...yet within like a minute had all 4 ko‚Äôd on the ground. The only other killer capable of turning a game around on a dime like that is Nurse, and I‚Äôm not sure new Nurse could even do it.
---
Survivors SHOULD be punished for their mistakes but with Hillbilly one or two minor mistakes can cost the entire game no matter how well survivors were doing before. Again one side making mistakes should indeed swing the momentum to the other side but in Hillbillys case it swings that pendulum far too hard and his snowball is like hitting a brick wall for survivors.
---
You're either trolling or painfully ignorant about the game, the metas, and its mechanics if you actually believe Nurse is among the worst killers.  If you aren't trolling play the game more man before you take to reddit to comment about things you don't understand yet.  This screams yellow rank X Box player all over it.
---
But he really do be lookin fresh doe üò≥üò≥üò≥
---
His chainsaw isn't hindered? What are you even talking about? Lerys has a million windows so even with bamboozle a good survivor can usually make a window severely limited billys chainsaw. Of course I said good survivor and people who want billy nerfed aren't good.
---
I got salted yesterday for not saving when no Ed was up. 2 were on the floor and one on hook.
---
Saved one from the floor and looked for the totem.
---
I was just like, ‚Äúwhy? So we can all die?‚Äù
---
Holy Fuck this was gold I love you
---
Doing God's work, OP
---
So almost every killer is over performing compared to the devs stated 50% kill rate goal, and people still bitch about survivors being underpowered.  Even the safest map has a 54% kill rate.  You're practically guaranteed two kills per game.
---
*Let me preface this by saying that Freddy is perfectly functional now. This is just my take on the character. I feel it's a bit closer to the source material, and offers a fun experience for both Survivors and the Killer.*
---
##The Nightmare
---
*The Nightmare is completely invisible to awake Survivors, and cannot harm them.*
---
*Music: [Lobby](https://youtu.be/CXF7x1D77-Y?t=5)*
---
###Primary Weapon: Clawed Glove
---
###Power: Dream Demon
---
The Nightmare casts a spell that surrounds him. Dream Demon can be activated by **holding down the Power button**. When activated, any Survivor within an **18 meter radius** will **fall asleep** after **5 seconds**. A [music cue](https://youtu.be/CXF7x1D77-Y?t=86) notifies awake Survivors when The Nightmare is nearby, but invisible. While Survivors are **asleep**:
---
- They leave their bodies, and enter the **Dream World**.
---
- They can see The Nightmare and other dreaming Survivors, but not ones who are **awake**.
---
- They cannot repair generators or sabotage hooks.
---
- Their auras are **revealed** to The Nightmare for **3 seconds** every **15 seconds**.
---
If a Survivor is put into the Injured or Dying states in the Dream World, they'll be put into the Injured state once awake. When The Nightmare places a Survivor on a hook, they automatically **wake up**, and their dream body becomes their real body. Dream Demon lasts for **60 seconds**, and cannot be activated again until either the **power gauge** fills (20 seconds), or no Survivors are dreaming. Survivors can wake up by:
---
- Using the **Wake Up recovery action**. *This functions just like curing Madness.*
---
- Being woken up by another Survivor. While dreaming, Survivors' bodies are left on the ground where they fell asleep. **Awake** Survivors can perform the Wake Up recovery action on sleeping Survivors, which pulls them back to their bodies.
---
Every time a Survivor completes the Wake Up recovery action, it becomes **10%** harder to do so the next time they fall asleep, stacking to a maximum of **50%.**
---
###Power: Dream Projection
---
*Remains unchanged, except awake Survivors cannot see the blood spewing out of the generators.*
---
###Perks
---
*Remain unchanged.*
---
*If a Survivor is last alive, the classic "Freddy's coming for you" song plays.*
---
**I was really trying to stay loyal to the source material with this concept, since it bugs me that Freddy can be seen while Survivors are awake. I believe this rework would make him viable, whilst still honoring to the lore.**
---
And a good Billy can get those chainsaw hits.
---
See how that works?
---
I once played against someone named "First Hit I DC".
---
He actually DC¬¥ed once he got hit. After all that time (ca. 3 weeks), i still don¬¥t know how to feel about that
---
I SWEAR I KNEW I WASNT CRAZY WHEN I SAID IM GETTING WAY TO MUCH TRAPPERS.
---
Nope unless you're a completionist, have too much time on your hand and/or want the bloody outfit.
---
That's why I bothered to play through the tutorials.
---
Killer main btw- does nothing but propose nerfs to killers. I'm starting to think killer main btw means about the same thing as it's ok I have a black friend.
---
Pretty sure rank 16-20 can get matched up with rank 1-20 otherwise three‚Äôll have insane queue times
---
I can hear him going boink-y boink-y boink
---
There are literally thousands of killers on this sub (including myself) that play in purple or red ranks and regularly get 4 kills. Until I start turning purple/red getting less then 3 kills is an exeption for me, and I'm nowhere near as good as the best players in the game, regularly getting stomped by swf groups and beeing unable to play killers other then freddy,spirit, hag or myers since I simply dont understand how to best utilise the other toolkits.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm a trapper main so that might help as to why I like that map so much :)
---
true, but it‚Äôs the fact there‚Äôs 3 of them
---
You savin‚Äô them bps for oni and yui? üòä
---
Again, he's asking how lol
---
Lol thats pretty funny that the killer was right there.
---
You can record on console.  
---
Xbox one - press big X in the middle of your controller then press x button
---
Platstation 4 - press share on your controller then press square.
---
Switch - No idea if you can. Some games block recording
---
yup! mostly yui tho
---
Pulls plug
---
Just wait till you see school uniform claud in the Game freezer
---
SWF
---
how are they nerfing balanced??????
---
Freddy has the highest kill rate in red ranks, uwu. If people are complaining about him it might be for good reason.
---
Your last comment proves your exactly the type of person I assumed you were. So many parasites like you are skulking the internet these days, sucking the fun out of everything like fucking dementors.
---
Such is life in a game of wits, I don't use ruin because it's a waste of my time and perk slot as a killer I can be more efficient without it
---
they weren‚Äôt
---
The bloody cosmetics man!! I main Nea but dislike her prestige cosmetics so I‚Äôm just keeping her normal and have bought skins for her. Claudette and Nancy on the other hand, bloody them up! Bruh!
---
Not to mention this Michael was pretty fuckin jacked
---
If you try to blind while they are kicking a pallet it should be pretty easy to get two blinds and as for the addons I think it‚Äôs the accuracy and brightness addons that‚Äôll help
---
Imagine thinking that a 4K is what qualifies as a good game lol
---
Beyond
---
Bing bong your legs are long
---
If it did, I don't remember taking much from it, if I even found it.
---
Yeah, I'll say that, every game was actually kinda scary back then.
---
It's a bit different without the perk and you'll get extra loops out of it with Balanced Landing thanks to the stagger reduction. Also some other houses turn into (at least semi) infinites with the correct RNG in Haddonfield as well as the main house of Clown's map for example. 
---
&gt; literally
---
Also, since you tipped your fedora in an earlier comment i must point out you used this word incorrectly :)
---
It‚Äôs enough to make a grown man cry
---
I think you need to launch it if I‚Äôm not mistaken
---
That would mean survivors win 60% of the time since they have 3 conditions to win and the killer only has 2.
---
It's free with gamepass lmao
---
I bet she face camps first hook.
---
Dude why do you ask instead of literally just trying? Add it to your library and then start Dead by daylight and see if you have the mask, it takes 10 seconds.
---
Yep announced it on Halloween with a show coming up Dec. 20th. Hopefully new music to follow ü§ûNo problem! :)

---
Omg lol, you're right
---
I love the Legion because of how realistic they are. They are just a group of angsty teens who took it too far.
---
How do you fuck up KYF?
---
I just honestly think the gas cans would be kind of fun and a little more Interactive. But yeah you're right also.
---
Nope it got nerfed, now you only see survivors in range of the hooked person with kindred
---
So less than half of the survivors getting out per match is survivor favoured? I‚Äôm afraid you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
It's not racist if you have a black friend. Sucking the fun out of everything? I'm not the one advocating for gutting killers because I'm garbage at a game. That's on you. You want to ruin people's fun to make it easier and more fun for you. I don't give a shit what you think baby survivor.
---
Wow wrong on all 3 fronts üòÇ
---
Nope. Only because you see four survivors and one killer it seems like more.
---
I love how 'proof' is one person raising the point. Grow a brain.
---
Is this a shit post or what? Because clown is absolutely low teir.
---
Still waiting for a voice acted Francis
---
Can't wait to try to rush through the 4th tome before new rift arrives with the "*you'll get this if stars align*" challenges :)
---
Exactly lmao. And I'm not a Survivor main lol.
---
It's okay, butthurt Billy main. You can sit down. Nobody will challenge you anymore.
---
I bet she wants him to tea bag her exit gate if you know what i mean.
---
ruin is honestly not that good.
---
You complain until survivor is brain dead easy to play? Ya I think I get it. Spirit was fine, billy is op. Fucking hilarious.
---
Its what happens when you nerf the killers stronger than them. People just go down the list to the next best thing.
---
Couldn't agree more
---
Nope didnt really care too much about it.
---
Lmfao those must be the only three killers he‚Äôs played against üòÇ
---
&gt; No ma‚Äôam, no ham, no turkey, no jam. 
---
I'm just gonna take that for later
---
Ignore the facts and insult me all you want. At least I don't cry for nerfs everytime I make a mistake. I also have to say I just love how people like you non stop say rank doesn't matter, And then first insult that comes to mind is you must be yellow rank lmao. Hypocrite all the way huh?
---
We don't have him on console yet, so I wouldn't know lol.
---
Some nancy on nancy action
---
Perhaps.
---
I was climbing up from rank 12, got to rank 8 and played with a rank 19
---
Almost every pallet on the game is excessively safe. There‚Äôs only a select few unsafe pallets and even they aren‚Äôt so unsafe that you have to get a stun to continue looping.
---
Good work, could've been about 14ish seconds shorter however
---
The Meyers achievement takes forever. I think I‚Äôm only half way. Seriously...you need to play around 100 or so games as him.
---
I wish the Legion was top 3 üò•
---
If survivors have their way hillbilly won't be around much longer. After that I would assume they will begin crying for nerfs to either ghostface or freddy.
---
......... Very misinformed person or just a stubborn idiot.
---
Why? Playing against mori‚Äôs every once in awhile is fun imo, at least you get to watch a sweet animation rather than another game of the same old
---
Because she looks down at the ground when fatigued meaning you can‚Äôt see the survivor.
---
With shadowborn her FOV is wider, so as her head sways when shes fatigued you can see the survivors legs at the edges of your screen. Which lets you track them visually.
---
SCP-1471-A lookin fresh tho
---
I did record it, just don't feel like bothering with sending to my phone
---
Pam:What‚Äôs the scariest thing about prison?
---
Michael: The dementors! They are flying everywhere!
---
in in real life
---
You want to lower the stun time at the end of FF but also remove it?
---
Ah, okay gotcha - thanks!
---
idk what's sadder the two dcs or the dude that got left to bleed out, presumably while you try to find the last guy to prevent hatch escape
---
I got facecamped by a Freddy today, his excuse? One of my teammates across the map that I had no correlation with tbagged him, so I got the punishment. Fun.
---
I see now, thanks!
---
Bing bong where's his ding dong
---
FUCK YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
It should be a guy with a mutated shark head. His speed builds up as the  longer you're in his terror radius and can down you when it's full.
---
Yes. It's fine. If you don't like it, don't look at it
---
Oh, so that‚Äôs what it was. I thought it was something to do with my Internet connection. I then went to go play Battlefield: Hardline and that worked just fine.
---
That was all i had left, by the way why their store was working 100%.
---
I'm just putting it out there;
---
For Trapper, if you have a trap in hand then the Mori should be setup, drop, enjoy.
---
Thanks for the reply. I'm not really familiar with battle passes in general, this is basically the only online game I play.
---
No, please. I'll take blendettes every game over having to face another neon skateboard nea.
---
Low ranks not knowing that Legion is countable probably.  Side note though play Bubba rn so you don‚Äôt have to at high ranks
---
You don't have to if you have the xbox and reddit app.
---
Found another thread that answered this as soon as I posted, doi. Thanks everyone!
---
Kinda terrifying.
---
All we did in this match was 99% hooks and look out for each other. We played smart and got a rage quit for it. Lol still had a good time but felt this shouldn‚Äôt go unseen.
---
you misread. lower the stun time, remove the blackout. When I say the Blackout, i refer to the visual effect on Legion's screen that obstructs everything but your hands while you look at them in disappointment with the knowledge you won't 4k.
---
Looks nothing like her imo. But alrighty :p
---
Yes but this isn‚Äôt a slasher movie, its an a-sym game in which one team would not want to play if the odds were that against them.
---
We got egc in the meantime.
---
Not new, but I play a lot more killer than survivor. I probably have 200 hours with survivor, if that.
---
Thank you for contributing to the greater good. David is a whole MEAL for the entity
---
I'm also ps4 and I queue nearly instantly for killer and as survivor it goes the whole 5 minutes before the matchmaking does that thing where it goes "heck with it" and gives you a lobby with anyone available, and I therefore wind up with rank 15-20 baby teammates.
---
So uh idk. It could be an issue based on what rank you are? I'm currently 6 survivor, 9 killer, if that helps.
---
It helps Nurse in chase keeping track of survivors and opens your view to finding survivors that are hidden.
---
I play with 4:3 stretched resolution and Shadowborn and keeping track of them after fatigue is a lot easier.
---
Survivors wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave‚Äù to do anything. They‚Äôd could hold the game hostage until your dumb shark ass quit. ‚ÄúSafe spaces‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt work period and if you think for a second survivors wouldn‚Äôt abuse safe spaces are we all forgetting about hatch standoffs that lasted half an hour because neither side wanted to make the first move. This is the same as that except the survivor can physically walk away from the game and there‚Äôs nothing the killer could do. What are you gonna do ... make it so the water rises as the game goes on ...cause that leaves my issue of can survivors just breathe underwater now ? Am I going to drown if someone was hooked in the basement and I try to save them ? They‚Äôll balance it isn‚Äôt even possible because they‚Äôve already designed the game ... they‚Äôre not going to rework and redesign the ENTIRE game to add a $15 dlc. It‚Äôs not cost efficient or a productive use of their time when we already have enough problems they‚Äôre trying to fix. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to be that guy that stops all creativity but we got the dema because it‚Äôs humanoid in design. It‚Äôs got arms and legs...they won‚Äôt add a shark to the game because it literally doesn‚Äôt make sense.  Your only bet at a Jaws themed dlc is a survivor and a map ... no killer.
---
But elf costumes definitely fit in DBD.
---
I always hit the unhooked guy and chase the saviour so now there‚Äôs 2 people not doing gens or 3 if someone comes to heal the downed guy.
---
Dcs are not included, which means the overall deathrate is much higher(because the chance that the other 3 will escape is low)
---
I sorta agree with lowering the stun time, but I think the blackout is good, kinda like how it is on the nurse, giving survivors a chance to maybe hide
---
I need you to draw Adiris for me please.
---
Story had a happy ending though. Immediately after I was hooked and got real dead. This is just what the media wants you to see ;)
---
You can see it's signed by the DbD dev team
---
Most survivors find legion not fun to play against especially in the low ranks
---
They could make a killer instant kill a survivor after the first down and you guys would still be ‚Äûsurvivors just don‚Äòt want to adapt‚Äú.
---
Who got all the buffs in the last 2 years? ;)
---
Not even close
---
I get it, but the difference being that Nurse's power is significantly more oppressive than Legion's power XD
---
People really be sleeping on hag smh
---
Mori‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt give someone the benefit of ignoring two full hooks and a down. Allowing you to kill on death hook is purely to watch the animation as well as for the dailies requiring you kill a survivor by your own hands.
---
Keep crying little survivor main.
---
THANK YOU! I literally say the same hit, "just play enough games and you'll eventually make it to rank 1". That being said compared to some of the survivors in rank 1 (e.g. the crouching tiger hidden blendettes who never come out of the grass), I feel I should be higher than rank 1 ü§£. But calculating where my skill should put me, i should go green-purple ranks and the blendettes should be in yellows üòÇ. 
---
On a side note, now that the stats are here, I feel like the entitled killer mains can go suck it! They wanna move the decimal place over from my already measly 10% survival rate to 1.0%? So they can get their 4K just a little bit more often than they already get it (which is almost all of my games at red ranks, and mostly because of the survivors I get matched with wasting pallets and dying straight away, leaving me on the hook...)
---
On another side note, lately in red ranks, CONSISTENTLY I am being left on the hook! It'll be my first time on the hook, and I'll either be left till the last second with the killer already around, or just left to die even though the killer left me ages ago and they've had all the time in the world to get me). Honestly thinking about running kindred because of these brainless red rank allies I get...
---
This is not normal, it is not possible to finish all of the challenges. This is done on purpose to make you buy progress. Imagine if you spend 10$ and you realize you won't make it to level 70, but wait after we sucked you in for 10$ and you realize you won't get 1000 cells back if you don't hit level 70 you can buy rift fragments.
---
I knew people regressing at an alarming rate, but I'm surprised it is happening this fast that game developers can get away with it.
---
Verbally abusive hahahahaha. Go to church motherfucker! Nerf all killers so I can act like I'm good!
---
~~you could have let it be :(~~
---
well, it usually gets found in the first few minutes of the match unless you‚Äôre running thrill of the hunt or you trap the totem. it is countered by toolboxes and rainbow maps as well. plus, it‚Äôs not hard to hit great skill checks (it is for me, my vision is pretty bad but you get my point). however, i see what you are saying. i feel like there are just better perks.
---
Ebony moris are most definitely not the only way to handle these teams. That is a ridiculous claim that honestly holds zero validity.
---
Or you could've left instead of tbag at a door
---
What if they were a set of add one to lower the effect instead of just removing it?
---
üî•
---
How have you just figured that out?
---
Freddy, for some reason i thought freddy have a larger hitbox than other killers.  XD
---
xboxdvr.com
---
Very defensive for someone who thinks those perks are totally fine
---
Gone, reduced to atoms
---
The only hex perks I see people rely on is ruin, I dunno what you mean, things like devour and lullaby are pretty memey perks, they're not really good, and it's not even that they're BAD by themselves, they're just indirectly nerfed by the necessity of ruin, if you have ruin survivors will look for totems, if you dont then well... you dont have ruin Inherent disadvantage there, I usually only run devour hope if I'm on THE GAME map, using corrupt intervention on a trapper build, or am using spirit who doesnt need ruin too much and survivors think its haunted grounds.
---
What am I even watching
---
Unless your playing as a licensed killer with no other cosmetic option, there‚Äôs no point.
---
you might want to reconsider your approach if your goal is to get ‚Äúuseless‚Äù and ‚Äústupid af‚Äù survivors to come to your aid when you need them to.
---
perhaps try asking, in general, if people are unaware of what kindred does and how they can use it to make a smart play. 
---
shit if anything, be rhetorical and maybe some people will wonder.
---
but that‚Äôs like calling a girl you really like a dumb cunt because she‚Äôs not getting signals you‚Äôre throwing at her. she‚Äôs either not interested or ‚Äústupid af‚Äù either way, you ain‚Äôt hittin skins with that type of attitude
---
You only find meta perks boring because you have to run them every game.
---
You'd think that they'd figured out what the error is by now lmao
---
My original message clearly said both sides whine, yet you somehow deduct that I'm a survivor main. Nice detective skills there genius.
---
I tunneled a claudette once cause she kept THWARTIN MAH PLANS!! Her plans were: 
---
1. Fuck shit up 
---
2. Get hit 
---
3. Self heal 
---
4. Repeat till killer is agitated
---
Soo I broke the cycle and tunneled that pest
---
I don't know, man, no one's more disappointed in me than I am. I guess "Exposed" seemed so self-explanatory, I never really thought to question it. And running into it with the Shape more often than not, the few times I was insta-downed I just figured it was because he gets the double damage when he hits tier III.
---
Had no idea this was a skin. Then again I don‚Äôt see a lot of clowns.
---
I like indoor maps because they all look so different. I didn‚Äôt like The Game initially but now I love it Because it‚Äôs so unlike all the other maps.
---
Okay kid.
---
Agreed
---
oh my god this is perfect lmaoo
---
Okay douche.
---
You are easily going to have to wait for over a year for that
---
True.
---
 Although the 2018 movie was  Phenomenal a complete reboot of the franchise after the 1st movie. Its really good and I heard rumor theres already a green light for another
---
I was playing ps4 and not two minutes in one by one my teammates were going down and DCing and I was like WTF, why?? I didn't know who the killer was until the very end. So I started running looking for the hatch I jumped in and at the last moment a Billy with a chainsaw came running right behind me. I made it.
---
Reminder that the devs count dcs as kills and any kills that come from a game where one survivor dced, I feel like this really skews the data with how many baby ragers there are in this game
---
trans rights are human rights
---
Wow that gave me anxiety and cancer in one swoop.
---
I was going to respond with quotes from my comment because you seem to have a tough time reading, but I looked at your history and you seem to have serious anger management issues. Someone as mentally unstable as that is not worth discussing any topic with, because, eventually, their anger will creep up and ruin it all. Your first comment and the second are the starting points.
---
I hope you seek therapy soon. Be well.
---
No, because you don‚Äôt know how time works at high ranks
---
Then if you ever repost this, might want to edit that in. It would make a good \*sad trombone\* moment.
---
Wow, that is so adorable!!
---
Cause it's always taken personally when someone throws you on a hook or 4 people tbag and rape eachother while you watch and cant catch them.
---
I guess my phone refuses to even recognize Mettle XD
---
Kettle of Khan for pre-nerf MoM?
---
Buff it by being a counter to the strongest offering in the game? Yes please
---
I play killer and survivor equally and I'm rank 5 as both survivor and killer.
---
I think you might have become a bit tilted by my statement, and I apologize for that.  
---
But when measuring success as a killer or a survivor for myself it's important for me to consider more than just if I lived or died or how many kills I got.  It's more common for games to go heavily one way or the other. For example, I may have one game where I 4k and the next game all 4 escape.  For me to improve as both survivor or killer I need to be able to understand at a more progressive scale how well I've done and how I could improve.  Which is why I grade myself on that 9 point scale listed above.
---
why do survivors deserve to escape? If you get 0 gens done you shouldn't even have a chance at the hatch spawning.
---
U/Vredditdownloader
---
Players win and lose individually.
---
If half your team died, that doesn't mean you drew.
---
It means half your team won and half your team lost.
---
Why you hate it? Just curious.
---
I told people this over and over and fucking over again. And people just downvote me and call me a "lagswitching killer main" it's so annoying to people scream for a change to the game when they have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what they're talking about, people still say "fix hitboxes" whenever a scuffed hit occurs, it has absolutely nothing to do with hitboxes, it's latency, and dedicated servers increase latency. It literally PHYSICALLY cannot make the game better because the information has to travel GREATER PHYSICAL DISTANCES. God why did the devs ever listen to the community.
---
Yeah, 5 blink and mega blink had to go, just like prayer beads had to go.

Ahhh, I‚Äôm transported back to this subreddit in 2017.
---
I refuse to believe we live in a world where that would happen. 
---
Pig and Legion's nerfs were mostly just for consistency; Doctor will probably lose a common addon to a useless extra BP effect (probably his Knight addon), but otherwise I can't see them nerfing him. Especially with all the negative outcry about nerfing Legion.
---
I mean, it'd just be madness to nerf Doctor.
---
Are you new to dbd?
---
Becaise players cannot lose...
---
nevertheless he always looks more or less like me
---
Respect my Authority!
---
I mean the second one is kinda ugly I guess but the first one goes way more into uncanny valley territory for me
---
I'm spectating now and we'll he's doing it to everyone.
---
Oh no, i have nothing against Mori. It' s killers that want to be a dick with Ebony mori
---
Also, the lockers echo so it already sounds like two lockers are closing - its easy to tune that out.
---
In my opinion, not really. If two people get out with a key, then the game is still considered a win (to BHVR, at least), and I'm not bothered really. If 3 or 4 people get out with a key, you've not done your job as a killer. 4 people means all gens are done and you haven't killed anyone, and unless you have the biggest blood warden play of the century, you're losing the game anyway. And with 3 people alive, there's only one gen left, with at least one player devoting their time to not doing a gen and looking for the hatch instead. If that player instead was on a gen, then exit gates likely get powered anyway. Both scenarios are not kills that were "stolen" from me, but ones that I frankly hadn't earned with the level of control I had in game.
---
First time?
---
Slugging is the risky high skill strategy. If you can‚Äôt down a survivor quickly, everyone will get picked up and you‚Äôll get left with nothing. It‚Äôs a high risk high reward thing.
---
People also want to avoid DS cuz everyone having a minute of immunity after being unhooked takes away up to 8 minutes from the game when most games don‚Äôt even last 8 minutes
---
They‚Äôve actually already announced the sequels! Halloween Kills releases October 16, 2020 and Halloween Ends releases October 15, 2021.
---
Sometimes I specifically target Steve just to hear his angelic cry when he gets hooked
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main but when I do play killer, I can‚Äôt stand it when people lull at the exit gate waiting for me to turn around the corner so they can tea bag me. I just don‚Äôt even go to the exit gates anymore if I know they are already there at the edge of escape. Just leave the game?
---
It‚Äôs fuckin raw
---
I‚Äôm white. Jennifer Anniston is white. Yet I look nothing like her. Shocking :O
---
PRESENTS &lt;3
---
No, but it's irritating when Billy and Bubba's do this. I'm at least thankful I'm the only kill he got.
---
The only problem with that video is that that can happen with just about ANY killer. That type of snowball effect is not just exclusive to Billy.
---
Video games in general cause a lot of rage. I forget the name of the paper, but someone did some great research, explaining that many social recluses and unsuccessfully social people, aka most gamers, do not find success in the real world with other people and opportunities, so they vent that much harder when they lose the only thing they‚Äôre good at, video games. If I find it again, I‚Äôll link it.
---
Do you never play killer? Or read perk descriptions?

go watch Otz. Any game where he stomps the survivor ends up in either a safety pip or a depip.

Haddonfield is actually the 3rd safest map. You're reading the percentages wrong. 56.73% is the average amount of survivors who die, the 2 farm maps have a lower kill rate, making them safer for survivors.
---
too bad she probably won't love playing it
---
No because unlike survivor, killer takes dedication just to reach rank 1.
---
Now I'm imagining a special toolbox called "The kettle of Khan" that is just a kettle
---
Quentin for Survivor, Ghost Face for Killer.
---
I never camp hooks either
---
just got done with mine ill add

IKR

It is but apparently she wasn‚Äôt aware the picture was taken, and didn‚Äôt want it spread around the internet.

I would like to point you into the direction of OtzDarva I site him specifically becuase he has 2 videos that are fairly up to date about what perks, killers and survivors to go for when starting. 
---
https://youtu.be/7_yixIT0p58 - killers
---
https://youtu.be/Goi0knDvpGI - survivors 
---
For me personally if you don't have the time to look at the videos cause both are kinda long this is the tldr
---
Killers:
---
The Cannible  for bbq and chili
---
The hag for hex ruin 
---
These two perks will help you immensely when playing killer not to mention BBQ doubles your blood points you get so long as you hook everyone once atleast 
---
Survivors have alot more options:
---
Meg - adrenaline or sprint burst 
---
Feng min - all of her perks are great for new players. 
---
Bill - unbreakable and borrowed time
---
Lori - Decisive strike 
---
These will help you when starting out. The biggest problem I've had though and I have 300 hours in the game is the grind sucks and no perks or addons make the game really hard. I'd say don't get too frustrated and focus on knowing loops.
---
Thanks, I appreciate the answer. How easily are you guys completing the rifts each season? I took a break from the game after they added it, so I'm not really sure yet.
---
Nope....it can slightly mess with spirit and other killers tracking you if you run across map but for the most part its trash and needs a buff. It doesnt even lighten the sound of footsteps despite saying "your running is light and soft"
---
thanks, it was that!
---
This is the first one they have done.
---
I play this game almost daily and am currently at tier 38 with 43 more days to get to tier 70.
---
Please note that I play on switch version and we got the rift 2 weeks later than everyone else.
---
I enjoyed it.  I thought it was a good new take on the franchise that wasn't just bent on referencing the original movie.  And in this era we are getting up trashy woke reboots it was certainly a stand out
---
I sure do! My username is : !!danny!!2248
---
Funny how you didnt include iridescent hatchets or 3 gen Doc or Mint Rag and Rusty Shackle MYC Hag, or Infinite T3 Myers, or Flickbilly, Plague with the full gen stall setup with wall hacks, there are so many sweaty builds that just GIVE you a 4k if you even have a tiny bit of skill, and then theres just certain things that do require skill, but just shouldn't be in the game because it can be done consistently with practice.
---
That‚Äôs reasonable though, it was only introduced a few months back.
---
All bad Ideas tbh
---
There was one gen left, and if Otz had stuck to that chase with the Meg he would've lost, He only snowballed the fuck out of them because they fucked up by revealing an opportunity for him to down everyone
---
i‚Äôm very bad at sensing sarcasm. is this?
---
well, being an antisocial person that plays about ~2 video games, i can for sure say that this is why.

survivors should need to find parts around the map before they can fix gens, and they can also pick up weapons across the map to stun the killer with

They‚Äôre not, but there‚Äôs no other game I‚Äôve played where your opponent can completely your experience by singlehanded negated all of your perks, experience with looping and dealing with situations. You can camp, you bought the game just like everyone else. Just don‚Äôt be surprised when your queue times are forever.
---
detective tapp for survivor, ghost face and huntress for killer
---
Never got into Kate or Jake, i‚Äôm a David King Survivor, and my killer is pig and spirit
---
i guess i‚Äôm just being dramatic.
---
bc pride month is something many people celebrate so why not
---
Your opponent is not responsible for your fun.
---
I feel like they should extend that timeframe it doesn't seem like a long enough to make 2 movies of good quality
---
Indeed
---
Not judging you or putting you on a pedestal, but maybe it‚Äôs time to do something about it? Video games are fun, but consumerist hobbies don‚Äôt produce anything for you.
---
Freddy plays the pallet game exactly like clown with his snares. The difference is freddy doesn't slow down to place a snare and he can teleport as well as built in slow down with the dream world.
---
N E R F  T I M E
---
The French said Cosmetics = Skill
---
Houses. 0 mind game. Stand on top of the stairs. When the killer comes, vault the window, go back inside, repeat
---
There are so many windows in each of the buildings that if you have balanced landing, killer won‚Äôt ever catch you
---
For one thing console is still working under a peer 2 peer connection system. And while i have a 300 mega bit wired connection when going against survivors (a luxury i‚Äôm sure they relish and are grateful for), i am usually at the mercy of a killer who is connected via wireless (wifi) from across their house/living space due to the nature of consoles being inside either a living room or bedroom. This results in a lot of frustrating hits as well as rubber banding as survivor (which becomes all the more frustrating when survivor lobbies are few and far between due to the ridiculous survivor queue times on console)  
---
For another it becomes extremely deflating, disappointing, and frustrating not being able to play certain killers on certain maps because environments and objects start jumping around because frames drop below 10fps. I can‚Äôt play Hag, Demogorgon, and sometimes GhostFace and Spirit on maps like the Underground Complex and Badham preschool. Other killers like the Nurse and soon Oni just don‚Äôt work the same (and let me tell you i put in a lot of work to be a good console Nurse). Proper camera control is so important and you miss a lot of unnecessary hits without it.  
---
Console simply cannot handle the ever growing stress that dbd adds to the game. Every time i even open the rift/archives the console stalls for 5-10 seconds before it finally loads everything, and by the time it does it feels like its going to catch fire. So i can‚Äôt enjoy the game to the best of it‚Äôs ability and that‚Äôs ok because eventually i‚Äôll be able to move everything, but for now i‚Äôm just accumulating points.
---
How is it a win when the killer didn't essentially didn't play? Nobody enjoys games where everyone sits on gens and then instantly leaves.
---
I guess because I always run Balanced landing, I love the game. Yeah it sucks if your team isn‚Äôt smart enough to get one of the middle gens first before Pop and Dying light can really become an issue. 
---
Lots of safe pallets downstairs though, and predictably safe areas like near the basement, the massive drop down and above the washroom (room from the movie, idk what to call it)
---
You can see the scratch marks above chief
---
Lmfao!
---
I prefer the doctor to play and his perks are great for other killers. Monitor and abuse is good to be stealthy and overcharge can be fun but hex ruin is better. Have you leveled up any other killers? BBQ and chilli which is on leatherface is a great perk to have as well as hex ruin which is on hag. I‚Äôd recommend getting those first!
---
Must be a new perk,  denies bp for killer if your sacrificed.
---
You can see her left ear. From the hole in the wall to the right and about a foot below the break the in two paints.
---
It tends to be survivor sided. Survivors have lots of time to get away when hearing the killer's heartbeat because getting upstairs or downstairs requires some backtracking. If survivors are running Balanced Landing, it can extend loops for a very long time. The gen layout also encourages split pressure, which makes things more difficult for the killer.
---
Stealth killers can excel on Haddonfield because they use the tight corridors to sneak up on survivors.
---
It‚Äôs already up to date, thanks for the suggestion tho
---
Alright I guess your right because that‚Äôs exactly what I do every single time
---
BL is getting nerfed so the infinite looping on Haddonfield won‚Äôt be anymore.
---
Killer might have Dced... or it is a bug lol
---
All that glitters is not gold.
---
You cant shock them if they're too close, they're out of your shock field
---
I remember this one Laurie nailed her old DS when I was playing Unnerving Doctor. Absolute legend.
---
now THIS is tunneling
---
When i get urban evasion on my Blendette its over for yall
---
Give em a whack when they do that.
---
Odd, most people just need to update the game
---
Have you already tried resetting? That's what helped in my case.
---
Yep, Doctor's shock for some fucking reason has a dead zone directly in front of him. The best thing to do to Survivors who do this is just fake the shock at 99% them switch to Punishment for a ezpz hit
---
it makes it less fun for the killer too...
---
God, I want this to happen to me so badly lmao. As killer though I wouldn‚Äôt even know how to convey to the survivors that I want this lol
---
Anytime I see someone start doing that, just switch and M1. Suddenly they'll stop running at you when they're wounded.
---
You can tell what kinda of players you're going against by how hideous the Nea's cosmetics are
---
Yeah, I actually love when they do that.  I get a free hit and they usually stop running at me.
---
I was using the horse and it didnt show any empty space in front of me.
---
If they do that, just switch to punishment mode and well... punish them. They may have dodged the shock but they just moved themselves closer to you. Free hit most of the time.
---
Oh my god you're a genius dude!!!, But I think I have a better Idea, its simple, Legion now is a survivor and the game is just for getting points
---
Balanced landing house escapes tend to make the Killer lose a majority of the time. The only people that excel for the most part are stealth killers and a smart trapper.
---
You are joking right? As long as you can aim hatchets well Huntress is a beast no matter what. If you know what you are doing stopping survivors from looping is the easiest thing in the world.
---
The horse is hard to read, If they get too close you cant shock em, instead if you see them.getting close go into punishment mode
---
The Tonic can result in downs on certain loops.
---
But Freddy can also teleport, it's not better "everything". But he's better. So you're right

But damn that red glow you see when you at 99% on a Gen is probably the scariest thing you or I will ever see

Better Idea:

Her hatchets are able to be pick up off walls and palates of certain materials. Basically she able to collect her thrown hatchets to use again from the environment.
---
Maybe your system memory is almost full?
---
thanks bro
---
.... So basically when they all get slugged/onehooked
---
I watch him play I know how it goes down
---
that‚Äôs a good mention
---
LOL I was playing on Hawkins and everyone was so confused.   I killed people just because I ran into them nearly accidentally!
---
Aren't dream snares essentially tonics with no punishment for being used?
---
We get it you hate hillbilly, you can stop now.
---
Just add salt. It was a joke, honey.
---
They will WITH ONLY NEMISIS.
---
He will be able to do bold actions and get kills due to no heartbeat.
---
But without it he's a solid low tier. And almost the worst with the incoming nerf.
---
I'm in too deep!
---
can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre letting bubba go hungry. god, at least give him some s‚Äômores.
---
Whenever these statistics are posted I always have the same reply: numbers are deflated massively by a variety of factors. Be it derankers, people memeing, or streamers who are asked to throw rank for cash there are tons of people who lose just for the sake of losing.
---
Are there Killers who do this too? Yes, but there are 4 Survivors which leads to 4 times the chance to throw. I'm not saying that the stats are inaccurate: just that I'd like to see them with all the matches taken out where someone was running No Mither + Self Care + Inner Strength + Second Wind.
---
That last part "Nurse has been dealt with and now its Billy's turn." ...scary
---
Boy this is hollywood quality ain't a requirement.
---
If you see gens popping left and eight as a survivor and want the game to last longer, tip the killer off to where you are. Stop doing gens and focus on totems. It may be betraying your fellow survivors, but no one actually has fun in matches that last less than 8 minutes. Its lame.
---
Honestly the only adjustment he needs is his add ons.
---
But like can we start buffing low tiers now?
---
Only the slow down part, Clown also gives visual blurs and can clog more space. Freddies snares aren't the best for chases, but are hella good at defending gens.
---
Clowns are designed for chases, I have too many hours with him and will tell you this, he still sucks. But he's fun atleast
---
 I hate when I cleanse 4 totems in a game, but then NOED activates on the one i couldn't find.
---
Let's start by giving Bill some facial reconstructive surgery.
---
they wants ta hugs joo
---
Youre really over stating how good billy is. Hes an m1 killer that has good map pressure and can punish bad positioning with an insta down. Thats all.
---
Anyone know since when the data was recorded? Cuz I notice that the survs I play against now are a lot more potato than the ones I've played against in the past
---
Hey, I've been asking for buffs for the longest time, but BHVR only seems to care about nerfs, so I've been focusing on those. Billy has been a tumor on this game since launch. It's time for treatment.
---
Wait...I named myself "Welcome to DbD :D" when Demogorgon first came out.... Hmm...
---
Thanks for the info, Freddy dream snares always just seemed redundant to me due to Clown's tonic but I guess there is at least some variance.
---
I'll add you, but I play weird times and I might be there for three or four matches or I might be down for one and split lol
---
Just put yourself in the survivor's place. You start a game, the killer catches you in 2 - 3 minutes, and you die 2 minutes later on the hook with the killer standing in front of you. Now imagine this happens 5 times in an evening. If everyone does this, we have a much smaller playerbase because no one will want to play if they're just hanging on a hook half the night.
---
A killer can play the way they want to, but they'll stop progressing if they continue playing this way because better players will be able to deal with campers, and they'll get gens done and escape. You also won't get better at chases, because you're not really chasing people to get your downs.
---
If you're having a good time getting a down and standing in front of the hook, that's completely within the rules. Just don't be surprised if people get upset.
---
You're still crying over billy?
---
Hey it's not his fault he looks the way he looks!, Did you not see how his damn parents treated em, The poor thing
---
I always say in lobbies, if you do a gen look for a totem, since it slow at least a little bit games and make we don‚Äôt have to deal with noed.

---
Anger management coming from you is rich when you're seething so much you have to go into my history for an ad-hominem.
---
Yeah I'm the exact same. The other game I main is Rocket League, and I've got almost 900 hours there. Still shit at it, dont know half the mechanics of the game...
---
killers too op. need a nerf
---
Just because a few people can do impressive things with a killer doesn't mean that applies to everyone, you gotta realize these people play dbd as their job, this is their source of income, then being good is pretty much how they live, of COURSE Otz can punish how absolute garbage these survivors were, I'm a P3lvl50 Billy on bbth PS4 and PC, this stuff does just happen, you have to work at it, it takes lods of practice, I could take a clip of someone doing super good with Clown's bottles and say that Clown needs a nerf. It just doesn't work, stop complaining, you got Nurse changes and Spirit changes, let's stop making killers weaker just because they can sometimes do shit.
---
This game is NOT a 1v1. The point is to loop any killer for a bit then go down. If you escape the chase, good for you but the killer is suppose to catch who he is chasing.
---
Dude, you should be willing to listen to others and keep an open mind, because it looks like you are plugging your ears screaming "BILLY OP PLS NERF" again and again...
---
He is totally balanced, you can fake windows and juke to dodge his chainsaw... and use a lot of advantages to know when his chainsaw is coming (Spine Chill)
---
I recommend you to learn HOW to actually survive instead of hitting the "nerf button" when literally every smart person agrees Billy is balanced.
---
Interesting lol
---
Lol I try do totems,  took me forever to locate 8. By time I find one or two it‚Äôs time to exit.  I just don‚Äôt get why the gens don‚Äôt have more checks smaller window or something as you get in better groups.  Or why people don‚Äôt just enjoy taunting the killer.  Feel like I spend more time loading then actually playing the game.
---
This movie freaking scared me so much
---
u/digikaii Posted just Clowning around
---
This is obviously a baby Clown. He threw the tonic at a horrible spot.
---
If he threw it at the tree, that entire area would be covered. Let not even mention the countless ToD's on Thompson's House or any farm map, ceilings are what Clown looks for.
---
Lmao, the dude didnt even elaborate on why pig is OP.
---
This. Silly survivors go down quick. Good survivors can run billy around for stupid amouts of time before going down.
---
I agree with you besides Trapper, he needs a big buff in my opinion, I rarely go against a good Trapper, unless they ise the basement efficiently, that's also the only way I can really play Trapper, then again, I main Billy (Though I play whatever killer I feel like at that time, Billy is usually that killer), so naturally I find him better, I know more about him and less about others.
---
This... sounds unfun and like a nerf... Is this a bait thread..?
---
I just got it yesterday. Thanks though!
---
The worst part are the status effects. Like sloppy butcher: Apply haemorrage and mangled. Gee, thanks, sounds great... if I knew what those were 5 minutes into the game.
---
Heaven
---
Well, according to the most recent stats, Freddy is the only Killer above Billy. Oh, and FYI: Billy hasn't left the top 3 top-tier Killers since launch.
---
This made my evening, I wish I could vibe as much as Clown doe üòî
---
Ah, yes ;)
---
Nah, we talked after the game and he said that he couldn't believe he whiffed the two stabs like that, he stood at the pallet for a few seconds after that happened to reflect on it. He was nice about it though. And I got killed in the end :)
---
My easiest upvote to agree with you that it was my easiest upvote as well
---
most popular red rank perk self care? must be an old article?
---
Yes, 99% of Survivors get wrecked, but that 1% can deal with Billy. Definitely balanced.
---
Also, these were red rank Survivors.
---
I've seen Billys pull this shit several times.
---
Yeah, not as fast as Billy does on average.
---
What if I‚Äôm on a different state of mind where I like both the memes and the game? :ooooo
---
Lmao they are probably just calling you that regardless
---
I feel bad for Steve whenever he goes down :( his scream just sounds so shocked and surprised
---
Had a game the other day where the last two gens were next to each other and the third was upstairs in the Thompson house.
---
If I put a trap on the stairs, they literally couldnt do anything without me immediately knowing.
---
Yeah but I get like fully kicked to the menu screen, and I‚Äôm not sure why? Honestly with all the server problems yesterday I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs cause of that
---
When spirit tunnels you off hook but you run her for 5 gens before being rehooked - Then saved by team mates and hit her with the DS on your way to the exit.
---
Almost always a insta dc and surprisingly is not that uncommon.
---
Part of the fun is learning all the strange little details.
---
Wait they changed the vault animation is different, what was her previous like?
---
They‚Äôre shooting them back to back.
---
As opposed to your own data that you pull out of your own butt?
---
Same story on the PTB, a guy was trying to expose someone in a locker, but he got downed and DCed.
---
Even with 3 people, we managed to get down to 2 gens before we all died against Oni, but guess what? Guy's name was "Hit\_me\_ill\_dc". He really did live up to his name, so in a group effort we all reported him :)
---
Can confirm this. I‚Äôm rank 5 and my friend is rank 15. :( She always carries decisive and boil over so she doesn‚Äôt get downed too quickly.
---
Im a legion main so this thread is a whoop dee doo! From my perspective hes fun cause hes a run and gun, always on the chase with the information and is rewarded for split pressure
---
But, what about the ones that are kinda just undead or sickly looking?
---
Which one?
---
Always worth it.
---
Nothing better than cleansing all five totems and then seeing the killer brought NOED after the escape.
---
Good point!
---
I snuck right in there as T1 Mikey and stalked the heck out of some poor soul the other day. Slash him and he can run right through you. Stalk him and you can take your time. You just have to take care if he hides behind the gen and tries to juke your slow T1 ass.
---
Non-metas are best like a distressing wraith with add on that doesn‚Äôt suppress terror radius.
---
I...I really like this
---
Teabagging usually
---
No u
---
Hell no, this game needs any sense of progression it can get
---
How about a land shark?
---
I dont understand...
---
She didn‚Äôt have one, she just stood there and then popped on the other side. Now she just looks like a skinny blue Freddy standing on the rail for a moment before monkey-jumping down, it‚Äôs weird as fuck
---
Its the 8 different doors gag they did youre thinking of.
---
Survivor is meg and killer is doctor/trapper
---
It specifically does not include DCs.
---
Alright, I'll do that tonorrow, gonna hit the hay now tuough, good night
---
Great job on the shading, really brings the spooky on
---
Buffing killers?! 
---
Are you out of your mind?
---
All we do on this sub is complain until any decent killer is needed to the ground and move on to the next lol
---
Your only option is to just take the L and jump in a locker once you're in that room against a killer that can 1 shot. Feels like shit lol
---
Lmao
---
It's clearly the other way around. Killers whine and get survivor insta heals nerfed, while the moves that countered them remain untouched.
---
jesus, can memes reach a higher shitpost tier than this? im inclined to say no, but i have seen some mighty ones here before.
---
It isn't though and generally results in everyone depipping, no one having fun, the 2 people that are guaranteed to die because of this isn't having a good time and with queue times as long as they are this game is cancerous. There is no cure for this shit. You can do gens all you want to. Bubba will 100% get 2 to 3 kills out of this shit because the majority of the people who play this will go for the save on the second hooked person instead of just leaving because "muh gate is at 99% bro and I have borrowed time." Bt isn't even a counter to this especially with double charge time reduction add ons and especially more for those doing this with insidious. 
---
There is no cure for this behavior.
---
Why were you downvoted?
---
[https://imgur.com/a/ey1ugrY](https://imgur.com/a/ey1ugrY)  
---
They do exclude any matches with a DC in them, soooo...
---
Ghost Face is very popular because of Tru3 I‚Äôm pretty sure. Hillbilly is a strong killer, so that‚Äôs why.
---
When I first started playing I was like the too. I'd just say practice and make sure you look behind yourself.
---
Come on dude you gotta pretend like its hard.
---
The bulging eyes and agape mouth always make me chuckle.
---
I "camp" when it's an swf match and they're all perched to unhook but I do my best not to tunnel and go after either the rescuer or someone working a gen. Again unless its swf with all blendettes then how am I supposed to know?
---
Honestly, if the killer doesn't have ruin, (even with frankly) its typically a much easier game. 
---
Should always do totems when you blow through gens that fast because bad killers usually fluff themselves with noed . The higher ranks you get the better it gets but if people gen rush before the killer gets momentum, its all over.
---
Just stay calm and think about when they get bloodlust and if you can do another run around the loop or if it‚Äôs too much. 
---
It sounds like you don‚Äôt know when to stop until it‚Äôs too late. 
---
If they go for a hit and you know even if you drop it you could either deadhard or take the hit and keep running the loop. 
---
Just learn how long there swing is.
---
Hey i saw a stat that says bubba is over performing wheres my bubba nerf?
---
gold
---
The snares and the gas bottles are both area of effect slowdown, and both are used to shorten loops by dropping them down during them. Clown can obviously use his outside of loops to slow down survivors where Freddy really can't, but in the loop they get used to the same effect.
---
I'm thinking of some Scooby-Doo scenario where you just stall him by explaining how it works then blind him at the end and go past him
---
In that patch survivors got the red insta heal nerfed, the purple one i would argue got buffed but ill play along with the narrative and call it a nerf, and a buff to medkit healing on teammates. Killers got the strongest killer absolutely gutted. I see a whole lot of posts and comments of people still complaining about insta heals being nerfed but killers seem to have made peace with the loss of nurse.
---
We were but then you brought it up, so it's ruined

Whispers on killer, BT on surv
---
I'm constantly debating if I want my Feng Min to wear her blue hair or not. Good luck hiding anywhere with that.
---
If that's true then great. Doesnt change literally any of my other 3 points. The 2k = balanced metric is stupid and doesnt account for game time, pips, hooks and of course fun. Not to mention that rank 1 means nothing other than playtime. You can have players who are fried potatoes, players who are gods and everyone in between.
---
I admit I have my doubts about whether that is completely true. Oboy cause they flipped the switch from "we can't differentiate from DCs and kills" from the last stats to "We can guarantee there are no DCs  counted." Dedicated servers havent been around that long. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
---
Level Hag first for her Ruin, after that it depends on your playstyle and preferred killers. Nurse + Michael have slowdown perks. Doctor has a sneaky perk. LF has an information perk.
---
wtf is this streaming window
---
Mirror trick?
---
Like a human version would not be that hard.
---
This is a parody of a parody...
---
Hey man i said id consider it a nerf just to push the narrative. Though i figure youd actually like it better since you mentioned insta downs and a one button press on demand endurance that also allows you to hold up dead hard would seem like something youd be into. My point however was that you are lamenting the loss of two add ons that was traded for a buff to medkits and a nerf to the strongest killer in the game as well as all of her addons. That sounds like a net positive to me. Do you disagree?
---
This simple chart confirms my long held beliefs that the game is totally Killer sided. It has nothing to do with my skill as a survivor, I'm just always in a losing battle.There are definitely no variables other than number of kills per match.  
---
Confirmation bias is unfortunately a real thing.
---
Spirits perks are nice, but it does feel like it‚Äôs too easy to end loops and sneak up to people by just exiting phase before getting too close to trigger vacuum sound. I often find that killers never seem to be playing her for fun, they just want an easy win
---
Davinci Resolve for editing
---
Gameplay recorded on dbd
---
Mocapped in VRChat
---
Im just so confused by her so after huntress im doing leatherface and btw im looking at huntress's model, she has short hair
---
OP got into a locker in order to avoid a hit from Ghostface. When the killer noticed it attempted to open the locker, but was sucked into the wrong one and he kept trying to open the locker even when OP already escapdd
---
imagine using white on white
---
Oh I see, you cropped the hud in post? I was thinking about writing a Red Vs Blue style show in DBD and was interested.
---
he rootin' n' tootin'
---
 i love how they understood and humbly obliged lmaooooo
---
Well this is BhVR we are talking about... probably the easiest thing for them to do so they can keep dumping out those cosmetics and DLCs! Plus won‚Äôt get a ton of bugs to go with it! 
---
I love how BhVR Interactive with their nice cash infusion and shitty coding went so low as to take megs voice lines and slap them on the new survivor yui and then to top it when you purchase the pipe weapon for Michael it sounds just like his knife. 
---
BhVR Interactive is getting really cheap and sloppy, like a drug dealer who is doing to much of his own shit, they get sloppy and get caught...
---
Does anyone else get angery when posts get tons of likes on this sub despite them having nothing to do with the actual game just because it has one of the licensed killers in it
---
Clown cookin, what he gonna make?
---
No it don‚Äôt, not in PS4 land, you get hooked camped! Asshole to asshole...
---
It was survivor sided, DbD has been balanced for quite a while now, thought it was unanimous..
---
i wish they would give her more cute hair instead of undercuts and fucking ponytails
---
&gt;to take megs voice lines and slap them on the new survivor yui
---
Are you sure this is not just a placeholder ? I could swear that they did this before.
---
I have a great feeling that a toxic surv main would insult you in 50 ways due to the fact you main two of the most annoying killers in-game
---
What I wouldn‚Äôt give for franklins in the shrine for a week
---
this is HIGH QUALITY
---
So uhhh... whens Clown getting a gun to bring him up to the rest of the cast?
---
Uh Laurie for Survivor and Pig for Killer
---
I wanted an animation similar to "Ring girl coming out of the TV" style animation
---
I like the idea of the perk, I will  try it with the Nancy perk that shows your scratch marks if/when I get around to leveling her up.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs just that spirit is over performing so they need to nerf Pig
---
He has:
---
&gt;A passive, global effect that gives him information (failed checks) or slows survivors
---
&gt;Adds an objective to the game (waking up)
---
&gt;Snares that slow you considerably
---
&gt;Passive phasing
---
&gt;A teleport
---
And that's not even getting into the ways those various things are bullshit like the lack of a slow when placing snares, the fact that his teleport can be cancelled and faked out, etc. His kit is bullshit and no other killer in the game has that much built into their killer power.
---
That's bigot-thinking, say he startles you consecutively
---
not if u take a hit after saving;)
---
Lol use noed cuz u know u get no kills
---
There has already been plenty of violence, even murder because of online gaming, don't worry.
---
Combine it with fixated, that's my only advice
---
I kept getting a nat type error which is weird since I'm fine on other games
---
My bt didn't activate against a camping gf of course last match, a Kate and myself both took protection hits and he still tunneled down the team mate. :/ So I get if taking hits,  but IF you can get a safe save just WAIT the extra 10 seconds for them to leave.
---
Leaving everyone slugged and one-hooking them is not the intended way to play.
---
Otherwise there wouldn't be this many hook-related perks and the sacrifice category would just get filled by killing Survivors.
---
I‚Äôve seen clowns aim that shit perfectly actually. I know it‚Äôs not on the same tier level but I feel like that would be the equivalent of giving the huntress a crosshair, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd be down with free aim assistance instead of practice like w huntress or nurse
---
If you're not familiar yet, this is how supposedly you counter Doctor's power. This is purely used to waste the shock and to force you get less points.
---
Which map is it? I can‚Äôt remember
---
Try the addon that makes her move faster after a blink hit.
---
Weeeeeeeeeee
---
Guess I'll de-rank.
---
This goes on for WAAAYYYY too long...
---
its all situational imo
---
Bruh just check the number of available players 4:SWF, 6:KYF. Honestly that's how I evaded a few fake lobbys for lug when its actually swf
---
There are some extremely safe pallets on the map but you'll never find two anywhere near each other.
---
Yes, just dont get revealed
---
Only some perks need to be activated via keys like dead hard you have to press e or whatever your bind for it is other perks like spine chill activate when the killer looks at you most perks are ok depending on your style of gameplay technician isn't the best unless you suck at skill checks I recommend trying spine chill it's good for more of a hiding approach to the game most dlc characters are great and fun you can buy then to get the perks or save up blood crystals and buy the perks in the shop when black circle pops up it means the killer is alerted to that position
---
Calling Kenneth low tier and not realizing what his power is meant to be for? *laughs in coughing*
---
Imagine starting playing league of legemds now
---
140 champions all the runes keystones 200 items jesus
---
Next time will be better,thank you
---
entity wanted another wifu and was just like "yea you will do"
---
I always assume it's stealth Killer first then other ones with terror radiuses.
---
As a Legion main since their launch this honestly hurts to watch
---
Oh my lord :)))
---
Yeet. Hat trick.
---
I'd hope not. Seeing how you agreed.
---
You're a monster, leaving ace on read like that. üòÜ

God this would make me so happy, I'd love to run these &lt;3
---
Same on PS4
---
Can confirm am shirtless David, has happened
---
Why not?
---
People hate on true, for some valid reasons, but they usually come off as way too angry toward him, hateboner and all.
---
Hes just another streamer who streams DBD about everyday, all week. He comes off with an ego and complains about the game mechanics but considering how much he plays and posts its not too crazy.
---
 I feel a lot of his views on the game have validity as hes definitly not bad and likes to play the game most days, but people automatically judge him,in reddit, which i mean whatever, 
---
Hes just another streamer tho I do like him because he is good (obviously not the best) and posts content everyday but i fully understand why people wouldnt wanna watch him.
---
Not sure, just really weird and odd. Maybe someone can enlighten us...
---
Just give painkiller a try I met the dude in overwatch and he's really nice and helpful
---
Yeetus teleportus.
---
So yur so bad at using his power u rely on noed
---
Lol, I‚Äôve never liked using him, he feels clunky while playing him.
---
who cares about interner points anyway lolololol
---
I can‚Äôt remember where I heard this but I think I heard that she was pretending to not be sick and covering up her illness which in turn spread the disease more. Not 100% though. So she wasn‚Äôt a killer by intent I believe
---
Idk, why are there so many straight relationships in games? We get it, you are straight, stop shoving it down my throat.
---
I have no idea, I don't keep up on the mobile dbd I just know what I mentioned.
---
&gt;Just.. reward him some more for stabbing everyone.
---
The reward is people spending huge amounts of time healing, unless they are smart and repair gens while injured which still leaves Legion a reward, being able to 1-shot survivors.
---
Run full sfw with adept david 
---
Shits funny as hell
---
I mean depending on what killer you play you can make an easy excuse for tunneling a OoO and most people are fine with it in red ranks because they know the perk can be annoying at best and game ruining at worst
---
‚ÄúWahhh, survivors are SO strong!!‚Äù Yeah lmao, this graph proves otherwise. Every killer has OVER a 50% kill rate at red ranks.
---
She's ten billion percent invested in her religion. The entity just happened to take her during her darkest hour while she was praying. I always assumed that the plague thought the entity wad her god due to this reason.
---
How is DS a "FiX mY mIsTaKe PeRk?" It literally was reworked so that IF a killer tunnels you off the hook,  you have a chance to extend and do SURVIVIOR objectives because surviviors have them too. Adrenaline literally rewards survivors for doing THEIR objective. Wanna talk about fix my mistake what about NOED,  or hell even nurses. Why should killers be able to see a survivior they "lost" healing? Hmm. Weird points huh? 
---
BOTH sides have second chance perks,  or perks to HELP their side which is perfectly okay. Both sides deserve a fighting chance. I don't know what games you're playing,  but I'm rank 5,  almost 4 and 90% of our matches only ONE person gets out.. I wish I had more games where we all get out,  hell even just a few times a night but it's rare. Do I complain? Sometimes yes. But NOT if I get to do my objectives as well,  surviving isn't my goal every match. I just wanna have fun, and get some bloodpoints. 
---
I believe it's rare to find a killer not sweating for a 4k,  or pissy that even ONE person got out.
---
Oh yeah, but red ranks probably got the challenges done quickly so it didn't change it in red ranks too much, however, it definitely skewed the results in lower ranks.
---
Upvoted just for the song
---
Same issue for me and my friends also on ps4
---
Hell yes
---
It sucked not to play for a whole day but its better than not playing for 2 days
---
Spirit is performing on par with Billy and is performing worse than Freddy.
---
Didnt nea blow it up 1st? Rude lol
---
What kind of old gameplay did you watch. Self care isn't worth running. Takes to much time to heal.
---
So obviously Demogorgin deserves a buff.
---
Haddonfield is a fairly balanced map (though it is survivor sided)  However at red ranks , with balanced landing Haddonfield is brokenly survivor sided.  There aren't stats on it, but I'd bet in that scenario it is the most survivor sided map.
---
Yeah super bloody helpful mate. It takes zero effort to not be a miserable twat.
---
Same. I have been watching dbd content for 3 years before I actually got to play it.
---
What rank are you?
---
Sounds like rank 15-20
---
Kochi wo miro~
---
Would've been neat if it muffled footsteps and the sound of falling.
---
Not a brown jacket. I'm on mobile and I can zoom in. There is a very small part of a bloody outfit in the grass.
---
8, I seem to keep running into potatoes though.
---
Play how you want but if your gonna camp expect these type of messages
---
I thought I was the only p3 Nancy main. Only other p3 Nancy I‚Äôve seen wasn‚Äôt even using the outfit.
---
well deserved L
---
It's both Jane and ashley
---
I can't watch the clip, says it's not there any more
---
Was it Fungoose? He was keeping a tally at some point and it was up around that number.
---
I get people get kind of tired of playing against the same hand full of killers all the time but the remedy for this should be to bring low tier killers up to the level of the viable killers not try and nerf the few viable killers into obscurity
---
Wow really. Thanks for telling us. We would have never known
---
Downing everyone who's near each other IS slugging because you're not instantly hooking everyone you down.
---
He always sounds like he gets penetrated when he's injured:
---
https://youtu.be/orUvsxQ4zf8
---
Garbage ugly ass devs
---
I'm a red rank GF main and a 3k always nets me AT LEAST a safety, I've never depipped in that scenario unless people DC on their first down
---
This
---
No way, it's gotta be a seperate item. Blinds the killer for the duration of one carry. (Doesn't hide auras)
---
Reveals auras of survivors who get too close.
---
I see your point with those 2 perks (Deerstalker and Hex: The Third Seal to an extent as well) but following that logic Insidious would mean camping is the intended way to play.
---
Compare this to Agitation, Barbecue &amp; Chili, Blood Warden, Dying Light, Furtive Chase, Hex: Devour Hope, Hex: Huntress Lullaby, Iron Grasp, Mad Grit, Make Your Choice, Monstrous Shrine, Thrilling Tremors, Aftercare, Babysitter, Boil Over, Borrowed Time, Breakdown, Camaraderie, Decisive Strike, Deliverance, Kindred, Second Wind, Slippery Meat, We'll Make It and We're Gonna Live Forever which are all useless if you just slug everyone.

I watched the original Dunkey video ages ago and found it hilarious and this has had me laughing for like 2 minutes.
---
Good edit
---
&gt;I'm a Pig main
---
I'm sorry for your loss
---
Maybe it isn't the killers fault, but instead the map is busted as fuck? Have you ever had to chase around Wretched Shop, Haddonfield House with BL, Iron Works or Suffocation pit?

I'm the trash Mann is sloppy butcher in disguise
---
goddamn mate you got sat down real the fuck quick. always the meg
---
Yes I have. But what I don't do is chase the same muppet around for 5 minutes. If I know they're at a strong loop, I go and look for someone else. There's a million things killer can do to perform well. Chasing the same strong looper isn't one of them.
---
115 killer with a decent ranged ability? lol no.
---
If there was an addon or a buff that made her slightly faster depending on the number of hatchets, I'd say thats fine.
---
Vibe checked
---
No..... no it not O_O
---
Everyone knows that. It's still one of the best perks
---
You do realise that you can tank any hit with the purple instaheal addon right? You can take an exposed hit, Chainsaw, T3 Myers ect.
---
It is definitely better especially when used in chase.
---
oh my gosh, I was the pig! ty for the snoot boops again &lt;3
---
Fellow legion main ayy, I love playing him right now because of how much fun it is to run around like a maniac stabbing people Willy nilly. Also Sloppy Butcher+Thanato helps with game speed just soooo much
---
Sorry m8, gens before friends.

Yo devs go fuck yourselves you bunch of ugly morons
---
Fucking bunch of dumb idiots
---
u/rufrtho can you add me on discord? there's something extremely important about dedicated servers that only a few people know about it. and I cannot show it publicly. ( Heroiq#1723 ).
---
Yes, it is slightly bigger.
---
Awesome.
---
Literally if it didint show you as broken i'd immiedeately run No Mither more
---
*unzips pants*
---
That‚Äôs awesome!
---
Not only does it heal faster than a classic heal, but you also don't rely on anybody to heal you!
---
%100 agree, low tier needs buffing for variety!
---
Everyone is toxic. Survivor or killer dosent mather. Ecsept they who let bby dwit out and the bby dwit. They get free non toxsic passes
---
Otz's recent Doctor game is a terrible example. Someone posted it here the other day and I made this point in that thread, but I'll share it here as well. 
---
Doctor is definitely one of the weakest killers in the game and he was playing him in red ranks with basically no perks and no add-ons (and Doctor is one of the most add-on reliant killers in the game). He also said himself that hes not very good at playing Doctor in general. 
---
Its not fair to take a low tier killer that you know you're not that great at playing, not use any decent perks, not use any add-ons, and then go against red rank survivors running meta perks to show off how unbalanced the game is. He severely handicapped himself before that game even started.
---
Campers/tunnelers and long queue times
---
Thanks for creating this, I've been struggling to find the words when explaining to my friends about how hits have changed.
---
DS is 100% a "fix my mistake" perk because the survivor got downed. That's the mistake. Or the survivor was unhooked too close to the killer. That's the mistake.
---
And yes, Noed is a "fix my mistake" perk. Killers have them too. Nurses is an info perk like Empathy, but you're not wrong that Killers have "Fix my mistake" perks. 
---
But you see 4 survivors running these perks compared to 1 killer running them. Dealing with 4x DS and 4x Dead Hards and 4x Borrowed Times is 16 mistakes that get fixed.
---
Imagine chasing a survivor and completing the chase (1x complete). Survivor is wounded.
---
Completing another chase and getting Dead Hard'd (2x complete). Survivor still wounded.
---
Complete the chase again and down the survivor (3x complete).
---
Survivor gets unhooked right in front of you. You chase and go to hit only to trigger Borrowed Time (4x complete).
---
You continue chase and complete again (5x complete). You get Decisive Strike'd.
---
You continue chase and complete again (6x complete). Dead Hard used again.
---
You finally complete again and down the survivor (7x complete).
---
You finally down and rehook the survivor. What should've been 3 completed chases/hits is actually 7. You completed 7 chases and have a single survivor at struggle phase. Two other survivors have been on Generators the whole time, while the third survivor has mostly been on generators but stopped to save off hook when needed.
---
Now imagine you need to do that shit with all 4 survivors. We aren't even talking about killing a survivor. It's another 3 completed chases to kill the survivor. An extra chase if they use a Styptic Agent or Anti-Haemorrhagic Syringe, but we won't even count those.
---
Yes, both sides have "Fix my mistake" perks. Facing off against 4x "Fix my mistake" perks x4 Survivors is obviously a bit more difficult than "The Killer 1 or 2 Fix my Mistake perks"
---
You want to talk about both sides having a fighting chance? Go watch [Otz's doctor game from yesterday](https://youtu.be/eS7nn1B03YQ). He played Killer damned near perfectly. He completed chases quickly, he injured and downed survivors within the first minute of the game. He pressured and punished. The survivors made mistake after mistake.
---
The game ended 0 kills at 6 minutes.
---
You want to say both sides deserve a fighting chance? When one side falters and makes mistakes while the other side plays well, the side playing well shouldn't lose to such a dominating extent.
---
If you're at a point at low ranks while having only 1 person escaping, that's on you. People are out there doing the shit in that video, and *that's* why killers can't understand when survivors bitch and cry about everything.
---

Level 1&amp;2 Noed instadown was a mistake.
---
Aye i‚Äôm a david main but come on, Legion? that‚Äôs the worst killer ever ü§£
---
Must depend on the killer then. A trapper cornered me so emoted at him but ultimately got killer
---
I extracted files to the Icons folder, but when I started up the game it‚Äôs still the original icons. How do I change it?
---
You can pip on a 2k. There's a lot of permutations in a game. Winning a lot of chases, holding off gens, hitting people and getting 10/12 hooks is a lot of emblems.
---
thankyou!! I‚Äôll definitely be drawing more killers, I want to attempt to draw all of them in this style but I‚Äôm not sure who to do next. After I‚Äôm done with the killers, I‚Äôll be moving onto the survivors!
---
Really weirdly condescending. Are you like... in your 40s or 50s?
---
Yea I don‚Äôt think so. If you see the blue shell incoming in the map, you can avoid it by letting second place pass you so it hits them instead. I‚Äôve done it plenty of times so I have no idea why you said that. If however, it‚Äôs already in your proximity and you try to avoid it by stopping it WILL lock into you.

But hey, cuddos to the fact that your teammate still made it out of his grasp. I guess it's the thought that counts even though it didn't go as planned.

---
First off, the LGBT community isn‚Äôt a fad. Even if they‚Äôre trying to profit off of it, showing support for a community through some sort of monetization isn‚Äôt automatically terrible. It‚Äôs better than being ambivalent towards it. 
---
If you really didn‚Äôt care about what gay people are, then it wouldn‚Äôt matter if they added these to the game. Just because you‚Äôre okay with it doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone is just as neutral as you. In fact I‚Äôd say the majority of the population on Earth is homophobic in one way or another, subtly and ingrained or violent and outwards. Putting flags in a game like this shows support for people who may not have an outlet for support. It‚Äôs tiny, sure, but it‚Äôs nice. And *you* don‚Äôt even have to buy it! But it‚Äôs there, and it‚Äôs nice.

i'd like to introduce you to [shirtless mechanic david](https://twitter.com/AvoidedDrowning/status/1198545663233069056?s=20)

yesterday I was hooked in the basement and the killer was obviously very nearby, but one of my teammates unhooked me anyway. The killer just stood at the top of the stairs, let the other guy run right by him without even hitting him, waited for me to run up then downed me and hooked me in the basement again. I understand trying to make sure you get the kill but bruh why you gotta do me like that
---
Still better then p2p
---
relatable
---
wise words
---
Lol It‚Äôs always the Meg‚Äôs.
---
you
---
god i wish
---
This literally made my morning. Nothing better than to wake up and laugh.
---
Thank you so so much
---
Was his mouse button broken?
---
&gt;that could be true what about other games that run with dedicated servers
---
I don't know which games you are thinking specifically but I know this is also a problem in shooters Rainbow Six, Counter Strike, etc and even Rocket League (from the top of my head). In shooters if you try to take cover in the very last second, in your screen you'll get shot behind the cover. 
---
Also, other games didn't start as P2P and have a spaghetti code to top it off.
---
This and the nurse cosplay a month or two back are the best female cosplays I've seen in awhile, Huntress and Susie are a bit overdone.
---
You're the kind of passionate cosplayers  the scene needs, keep on rockin' on  ü§ò
---
Too many killers overperforming‚Ñ¢
---
so stupid right
---
You can still get the perks on ghost face after you unlocked them but i would get nurse, bubba if you got him and hag to 40 first.
---
Scott Jund has an amazing video explaining what i mean.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOHy-NA2qaY
---
Maybe he has 1mil BP already and just waits for patch
---
NOOO
---
A lot of people seem to be stuck in 2017 where the survivor side of the game was stupid strong and playing any killer besides Nurse or Billy was setting yourself up for failure.
---
I mean mate it's just a cosmetic. Its not gonna impact you any more than the other cosmetics you might see as "outlandish". Your talking about us being "snowflakes" but your crying about a little badge in a video game. Its not that we think your bigots, only the majority of you, it's just that there is no good reason to not include these. A nice cosmetic that represents some of the playerbase whilst not affecting the game and possibly helping out charities sounds like a nice idea. Stop elevating yourself by writing off other people's opinions because your gay.

It just sucks because the sketched hand looked great and proportionate and then you look at it now with the black ink and it‚Äôs a big wonky dumbo hand

I didnt mean the comment. The comment is clearly a joke. I'm talking about the ops title.
---
Can killers still get other perks after level 50
---
Trying to be nice and wholesome and say gg or I liked your cosmetic and being told I‚Äôm trash at the game and should uninstall just let me be nice to you please
---
This is so wholesome, good job :D
---
Huntress is already a top tier killer
---
I was referring to the title from the poster. Not the youtube comment. I know the comment is a joke. Lol I'm just making sure the op isnt an idiot lol
---
If they do that just hit them. It's boring not being able to use your power but oh well
---
Obviously. But that doesn't stop the killer from coming for you still,  and causing them to camp the rest of the game. You don't have to insta save JUST because you have bt. Let them leave the hook,  especially if the person on the hook just ran the killer for 2/3 gens.. Idk about you,  but I like to do more than just run the ENTIRE game. I like to get saves,  and do gens too.
---
I think you need to get on the phone asap to get rid of all the studies based on statistics.
---
The entire map us just broken two story buildings and annoying windows. Survivors just brain dead loop them
---
3000IQ
---
 what does bm ing mean
---
Tell that to the multiple grab animations that led to nothing, not even an hit.
---
I almost never dc but that was one rare occasion where I did. I was never tunneled so blatantly like that before and I just wasn‚Äôt having it.
---
&gt;red ranks killers will be over perform
---
It's not really overperforming though. The pip system at red ranks demands a kill rate that high or else you drop out of red ranks. 
---
It's like saying "Rank x requires 100% kill rate" then saying killers are overperforming because at rank x they have 100% kill rate. Well no kidding, it's literally the requirement.
---
If the killer wants you bad enough to where they continue to chase you after triggering borrowed time; they were gonna tunnel you anyways.
---
Okay. Be better than him and just leave dude.
---
&gt;despite the **weakest** killer having a 60% kill rate at red ranks.
---
*By definition* red ranks contains only killers that can maintain that kill rate. Anything less *and you drop out of red ranks*, so it doesn't tell you anything about balance other than "there is a group of players that can maintain that kill rate".
---
Yeah it's generally a 50/50 split for me. I don't mind either way anyway though

All they did was add more common lag/latency issues and sometimes the whole servers go down. I wish they'd revert it honestly
---
&gt; Turns out if you view anything other than a 4k 5 gens left no add ons as a ‚Äúloss‚Äù, you‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre losing most of your games. 
---
Well,  the *game* sets that standard. At red ranks if you don't 4k you probably aren't pipping.
---
I think it's so great when people can say "hey, that's me!" 
---
You're a friendly pig, you deserve all the boops!
---
I think I played the same guy, same shit, he actually dc'd.
---
I feel like he's an epic gamer, he delivered on his promise and is playing on hard mode.
---
Plenty has changed. 
---
Insta blinds, pallet amounts, pallet vacuums, insta heals, BNP's, healing speeds, exhaustion, a lot of loops were fixed like cow tree, end game collapse, SWF MM, vaulting, DS, MoM, and so on.. 
---
Some killers are still too weak and need help, but a lot of them are in a pretty good spot as is. The nerfs to Nurse and Spirit didn't even hurt them all that much.
---
Look who's shitting in the tall grass
---
Head on could save your ass in this situation
---
Besides new killer, map, perks, nothing. And I believe servers are yet to come
---
oh you mean that problems that go unattended for literal years? they're not trying to fix them don't lie to me
---
Deceit
---
You said [Camping is less fun **for the killer**].
---
I asked who said that.
---
You now say [Survivors on this thread say camping isn't fun].
---
Yeah.. I know survivors cry about camping. We see it everyday. I'm asking what KILLERS say it's less fun. Who says the guy sitting at the hook and pitching a tent isn't giggling to himself and enjoying his s'mores?
---
If he's having fun, who are you to tell him he shouldn't?
---
The reason I tend to parrot the same phrase over and over is because some people are so damned dense that they need things repeated. Try keeping up...
---
Then you play meta killers with meta perks and get the same experience, but without the t bagging
---
The game is no where near as bad, a good killer player playing a good killer can get at least a 2k against good survivors.
---
gen speed is ridiculous but no one likes doing gens, so adding another objective would be the best idea. also most of the issues are not with survivors themselves but with map design.
---
Survivors have been nerfed wayyyy more recently then killers have, which is shocking bc survivors got legit a year of dog shit perks before the stranger things chapter compared to killers getting at least one meta perk per chapter (possibly excluding Im all ears since its only really THAT good on nurse)
---
People freak out over the slightest nerfs, screaming that they are doing another freddy or legion. Freddy was legit 2 fucking years ago. and legion, even though he was made into a dogshit killer, is muchhhhh better then he was before. it wasnt the best change, but it was a quick one.
---
Good thing the latest data provided by the developers showed that Clown is one of the worst killers at all ranks and THE worst killer at red ranks.

We did that before, hope we q into you the next time.
---
This image is oozing with Sam's voice going, "Hi." 10/10 love it my dude.
---
We can argue about the minute details of how he played and where it ranks in terms of perfection, but at the end of the day you have to admit he played **very** well.
---
The fact that he was so thoroughly shit on despite that is the issue.
---
And yes, I admitted and agreed with you that tiers play some role in that. But to the extent that a Killer playing as well as Otz did in that game compared to survivors who made as many mistakes as those 4 did, it should not have been that one-sided, even accounting for the tier differences.
---
Just move on to your next match.
---
Oh ok. Thanks for the info!
---
They buffed Freddy and nerfed Nurse. And they nerfed insta heals for survivors as well
---
I never got it to work, even with strong addons, the killer always manage to look away. Meanwhile I can't escape no matter what. Oh well
---
I‚Äôm glad you like it!! :D
---
Yeah no problem. If you have any more questions feel free to ask.
---
Killer will use tunneling and camping, maybe one survivor would be sacrificed before all gens done.
---
Then use NOED for sacrifice one more survivor and survivors left has escaped, perfect 2k game that devs are aiming for.
---
Haha "nigga", funneh.
---
I like prove thyself for gens, dark sense or alert for knowing where the killer is, borrowed time or empathy for helping teammates
---
Only because someone sexualize something it doesnt mean the game have anything related to sex wtf???
---
I'm a potato but I don't potato that much like what the fuck
---
Which again, was a continuation of the joke itself as you can see OP even put the "Shitpost/meme" tag
---
How did they nerf Nurse? How did they nerf instaheals?
---
Yep! But sloppy interaction is going away so i dont run sloppy anymore. Adjusting before the changes come in which I really like!
---
Don't do the butt dance
---
I stacked on random gens
---
dont think it matters tbh.
---
Yep
---
When you'r the last survivor you instantly die on hook.
---
Honestly, what bothers me the most is her hair. Seriously, a fake blond Japanese? Is this Street Fighter now?
---
She was gorgeous in the banner with dark hair, so. I was hoping it was just weird lighting on the trailer. Total bummer. At least we are getting a black hair cosmetic for her.
---
No. Just no
---
Impressive that most of the time all gens get done but you still manage such a strong kill rate. I think people underestimate how much game is left to play when gens are completed.
---
i enjoy deceit, it has a similar feel and can honestly be labeled as an alternate mode, its free.
---
I wouldnt suggest looking for a game with as active of a community though. DBD is a ruthless dog. it destroys anything that trys to steal its glory, or the thing ends up destroying itself like f13
---
Dedicated servers are live.
---
He passed the vibe check üòêüëç
---
They need to fix DCing
---
Not so original but yeah
---
I watched this movie first and I remember being surprised that he didn't show even a moment of remorse or hesitation.
---
You're probably right though, it was my first halloween movie after all.
---
There is no set build that will do everything you‚Äôre asking for. If you want to focus on gens then prove thy self with better together is great as well as spine chill if you want to know if killer is coming. Last perk should be an exhaustion perk like dead hard or lithe even balanced before it gets nerfed. If you want to keep your teammates safe then you have to take on the Agro route which is the opposite of focusing on gens. You could run object of obsession with dead hard, adrenaline and decisive strike. Main goal is to make the killer chase you the entire map so your team mates have time to do gens. 
---
But if you want a balance between the two play styles I‚Äôd suggest spine chill, bond, dead hard and borrowed time. Spine chill is great to know when to stop doing gens and take cover while bond lets you know what your team mates are doing in general so you can help with a gen they‚Äôre doing or if they‚Äôre getting chased you can see where they‚Äôre going to and take a hit or even if you‚Äôre getting chased you can see where you‚Äôre
---
Team mates are and avoid leading the killer there. Borrowed time is great for unhooking and face camping so it can save team mates many times. And dead hard is just a good exhaustion perk. Great for chases and getting to pallets. You can switch it with sprint burst to get a head start on those chases if the killer happens to catch you or to get an unhook faster.
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: Ingame
---
Description: When using Sprint Burst, there is a chance that you will get your initial burst of speed, and then retain that speed with intermittent blinking backward ever so slightly. Even with the blinking, the speed retained was enough to outmaneuver any killer.
---
Well ds should be implemented mechanic against tunneling and being farmed. The end
---
Yeah they should just go back to her old animation
---
At least at my current rank if I get to that point Idgaf if I die since I've likely pipped.
---
I think it's Kate and Meg. Yeah, Meg. She is a beautiful red, it's just that the expression they usually give her heads is weird.
---
I would love to see the full concept!!!
---
Dweet is such a funny term, it makes me think of them like a bird that runs away scared if you get close to it and it‚Äôs super hard to befriend. They can be found walking around aimlessly or resting in a locker, gaining their trust is hard to do but it‚Äôs worth it
---
Yea Freddy was a long time ago and people need to let it go already. Legion was a terrible concept that was full of exploits from moon walking to infinite mending so he kinda had to be drastically changed.
---
I wouldn't mind another objective, but they would have to nerf killers like Spirit, Nurse, Billy, Freddy, and probably some others in exchange. As it is now those killers can wipe most teams out if you're good enough.
---
I mean BT should guarantee a safe unhook even against a facecamper if the unhooked guy isn't brain dead. A full speedboost should get you some decent distance.
---
What would be the power and the perks of the Xenomorph?
---
Last night I was doing a generator, and turning left and right keeping a lookout for the killer(I didn't know who it was). So at one point I was looking behind me, move the camera in front of me, and bam I see the red light on my generator. So I start panicking and run away. Turns out, it wasn't a red *light*. The generators have a part that's red, and that scared me. Yup, I got scared by a freaking *generator*.
---
You auto die if your the last guy to save everyones time
---
We already have a black haired japanese. Also fake-blond japanese perfectly suits her background since it's seen kind of rebellious to dye their hair in Japan.
---
Np mate
---
Yes but now I can't be blamed for other people's shitty internet so i see this as an absolute win.
---
Vibe check
---
Like almost every fucking charm you twat Omega lul
---
Umm, Quentin?
---
u/GearbusterX I'm guessing you're a survivor main?
---
Most of them are dead games though
---
Have you tried Peggle?
---
Because it would be op of course.
---
They used to be, but that would just heavily encourage face camping
---
Since she had an extremely low pick rate, we could say that probably the only ones playing her are those who are really "loyal" to her. The people who don't rely on the top tier killers to get wins are likely to be the ones with thousands of hours, and these people are likely to be good with any character.
---
So I think it's more likely that it's just a result of the factors that are common to all killers and really good players skewing her stats up rather than something with the character.
---
u/Angry__German Why are you getting downvoted?
---
You realise Survivors don't have to escape to win, right?
---
If we consider gaining 1 pip a win; Survivors don't have to escape, but Killers need at least 3 kills.
---
And then you realise how unbalanced they are .
---
Agreed. These stats seem like BS but I find killer to be way easier. 
---
I'm a little shocked Huntress kill rate is so low. I think she's fucking amazing.
---
According to survivors rule book section C, subsection 2.5: Nurse killers must adhere to fabricated expectations on how to play the game and are forbidden from enjoying themselves. Furthermore, you must allow obscenities and or ‚Äútrash‚Äù talk in end game chat (private messenger if console) and dedicate at least 15minutes of reflection if subsection 2.5 is broken.
---
Way to early with that flashlight, watch the right timing on youtube etc üòä
---
I would say you start to blind the killer right before he puts the survivor on the shoulder.
---
That the fucking point.
---
I want all the advantages when going against killer.
---
Yea i love the combination of spine chill, sprint burst lightweight and iron will. I often even lose the killer completely in a chase
---
Decisive cause I always need it and ruin because its mandatory
---
You don't seem like a Nazi from this limited interaction, but you are definitely not left of centre either.  Centre at best.
---
Oh ! Alright sorry then ahahaha I thought we were speaking about survivors only ;)
---
Unmasked nurse! She has a skin that may help you get her look down.
---
Yeah it was just a joke meant to lure someone into saying exactly what you said no worries :)
---
it's still more interesting than killer players givin' their 2cents about balance just after being bullied by an organized swf
---
you can do 8K BP as survivor and pip actually.
---
It's an argument because it isnt reflective of real matches.
---
I played DBD for almost all my spare time yesterday, and not once did I witness anything like the video above, nor even have more than 1 match where all 4 survivors lived.
---
When I did my killer games, there was only two matches where a single survivor survived, the rest were all 4k's.
---
The day that this game is only balanced and optimized for rank 1's is the day that the casuel survivor playerbase quits, and the killers have noone to kill in lower ranks.
---
Yeah, aslong as there is at least 1 totem NOED will activate
---
This is the way
---
1. Freddy got reworked completely. Now he can teleport to gens and, depending on add-ons, can place either Dream Snares (Hag Traps crossed with Clown Gas) or Dream Pallets (fake pallets that explode and don't stun the Killer when dropped)
---
2. Badham got reworked. There are now 5 versions with new layouts and loop designs.
---
3. Stranger Things Chapter was released with Demogorgon, Nancy Wheeler, Steve Harrington and the Hawkins Research Centre map.
---
4. Archives and Rift were added. The Archives are challenges that award lore, bloodpoints and Rift Fragments. The Rift is a battlepass that gives cosmetic rewards and is progressed by earning Rift Fragments, either by playing the game (1 RF per 800XP) or completing Archive Challenges.
---
5. 2 new status effects were added. Oblivious: Survivors can't here the terror radius and are immune to all TR-based perks (currently on triggered by Demogorgon portals and being in Freddy's Dream World). Undetectable: Killer has no terror radius and is immune to all aura reading perks (currently applies to Ghostface's Night Shroud, Cloaked Wraith, Demogorgon after teleporting, EW1 Myers and crouching Pig).
---
6. Nurse got nerfed. All her add-ons were reworked and omega-blink is gone. Blinks now have a brief cooldown.
---
7. Insta-heals got changed. Styptic now applies Enduring for 8 seconds and Anti-Haemorrhagic now heals 1 health state passively over 8 seconds.
---
8. Dedicated Servers are enabled on PC, but only as a test.
---
I certainly don't complain about indoor maps, I've been telling people the Game is one the best killer maps ever since it came out
---
That's just not true. People who know exactly what theyre doing with her dont ever have to camp, half the time I don't even trap hooks. I really think shes misunderstood by a lot people in the community.
---
Oh, we already have one with black hair, so let's give her an European color or else they'll look the same. Let's also give her double eyelid surgery while we're at it.
---
I think there should be one more gen at the top floor to put more pressure on the killer.
---
Nevermind, I'm dumb just watched too old videos. My bad sorry
---
Im not agaisnt but you guys are literally saying to everyone that doesnt agree with you that they are basically shit people
---
In older mario karts it worked liked that so i understand the confusion
---
Alright , what perks do you use on her?
---
I mean there are some survivors who blink with their bottom part of their eye, don't know if Yui's the same but I kinda doubt just a tiny bit that it's intended.
---
they are. just didnt expect them to actually have a decent pick rate even in red ranks.
---
TBF since reset killers seem to be on point. I've been in 20 minute games where survivors have failed at doing the gens and just been like bees around honey trying to get people out of basement. It's a fly trap... don't go down there.
---
I've also been in unfun games where hooks get camped. One trapper and leather face did literally use the basement as a trap and body blocked people on stairs. In those cases... let them camp and get as many points as you can doing totems and gens cause they ain't gonna chase ya.
---
Fooool. Real legion mains like the changes
---
Watch painkiller real nice dude with lots of tips
---
Was really hard to tell without those proof :/
---
Tunneling is chasing the same guy over and over again. Essentially ignoring everyone else. Most people view it as chasing the guy who just got unhooked. Most players view it as good etiquette to not tunnel if possible 
---
With this said obviously there's limits some survivors are just entitled and expect the killer to just ignore them. 
---
Swf is survive with friends. So people playing with there friends. Gets a bad reputation as most sweaty survivors play in 4 man squads. But for the most part swf is just average people playing with friends
---
If there really gonna waste time chasing a borrowed time person w/decisive then let em have it, you‚Äôll win the game for your team.
---
I‚Äôll be a pant less Myers, so we can all have fun ü§™
---
Because both sides have different ways define winning. Normally a match will have 5 results based on the number of death: 0,1,2,3,4. Survivor believed they win only when there are 0,1 death and they survived, or when all member of their swf survived. Killer believed they win when they got 3,4 kills. Which mean there are many case they all think they lose unfairly. Of course there are few player think like this at first, but it is spearing fast.
---
Even without grass you can hear survivor's breathing so yeah, headphones are killer's 5th perk.
---
Yeah but that's all ranks. It has already been said, but low ranks tend to be total shit with Nurse. In red ranks, you see a more accurate depiction. 
---
These stats are not very useful anyway, especially the map stats, because the deadliest/safest are very predictable. The in-between would be better, but they're not there.
---
Perhaps don‚Äôt tunnel? Why are you ‚Äúscooby-doo‚Äôing‚Äù (da fuq) around a pallet loop.  Eat a pallet or get an m1 and rotate.  Or, take a break from dbd, no shame.  But, whining? Eww

As a Ghost Face main, I can safely say that I absolutely HATE how most people are playing with him now. I play for map pressure, and so far every gf I've gone up against has just been a camping pos
---
&gt;Why even waste your time to bookmark/find all of these?
---
Who says I waste time? 
---
I don't have to find anything because this shit gets posted twice a day if not more. It gets tiring to see it while browsing by "new" but I can't call people out because "its rude" so I just have fun with my wall of links. 
---
I don't bookmark anything (lol, imagine doing all this work to save reposts). Browsing on reddit is as simple as it gets so I just open my profile, grab my last comment and add the new thread to the top. 
---
Barely 10 seconds every time I need to update the list. People probably take longer just to repost this screenshot.
---
Also, these posts are against sub rules but unfortunately mods aren't fast enough or care enough to take them down.
---
How fid f13 destroy itself?
---
Perfectly fair and balanced.
---
Those stats inaccurate therefore they are not facts and you got downvoted because you don't know what you're talking about. By your logic of "too easy" the wraith must be the most broken killer in the game
---
Hi, Trapper! You look nice today. üòç
---
lol
---
Or run whisper and never lose 1v1 EGC
---
They‚Äôre literally either tied to Claudette‚Äôs story, or things from the game we already know.
---
If only there was a way to correct someone's writing for them to learn and not to be an asshole
---
Michelle Myers? I didn‚Äôt know I needed that till today. But on a serious note, you did fantastic!!!
---
Killers don't complain about indoor maps, they complain about outdoor maps like Haddonfield, Blood Lodge, Coldwind, etc.
---
Yeah bitch!
---
Neither are interesting in my eyes. Don't get me wrong, I like seeing statistics. But without context the stats are useless. Someone just looking at this would think that murse needed a buff, when in all actuality she doesn't. Her performance is always dragged down by console nurses, and she's (nearly) impossible to use well on console.
---
Lmao do all Dead by Daylight players watch Caleb?
---
I‚Äòd recommend you go into the custom game mode and read through all the perks yourself, just to get a first impression.(they are all available in custom game). If you have a friend, you can jump into a game and test them out as well.
---
When picking perks, it is important to keep a few things in mind:
---
‚Ä¢synergies with other perks and with the killers power
---
‚Ä¢viability (is this worth a perk slot?)
---
‚Ä¢does it slot in well with the way you enjoy playing the game?
---
Since there‚Äôs a lot to cover in that regard, I recommend checking out [int3r4ct](https://m.youtube.com/user/int3r4ct) on YouTube. He has made several very informative videos, including guides on every killer, which feature desirable perk loadouts, general tips on how to play and discussion about the games mechanics in general.
---
If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!
---
Perks didn't confuse me when I first started but rather the whole talk of 'blood on the ground' and 'scratchmarks' did instead.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love the 'hardcore' mode of no mither, but it is very rare to be able to get yourself up - because the killer knows you have no mither. 
---
Also the one hit isn't irrelevant if they know that they don't need to stalk you or rev up a chainsaw.
---
It has potential, but the killer has too much knowledge on you imo. Especially at high ranks, you get treated like you're trying to pull a fast one, and can be an easy target.
---
I also find it a shame that to get the most out of it you have to run iron will - when no mither reduces sound by like 50% which is pointless. There are some changes that could be made, but my no means do I want it to be a really good popular perk. It just needs to be a viable risk/reward.
---
Stbfl with clown is the best thing ever, just watching the knife being flipped at such high speeds
---
If the tier list is comprised of S+, S, A+, and A I agree.
---
Nah. Just means you waste less time in the match. I'm gonna go back to matchmaking ASAP taking a 1 depip rather than 2. Not gonna waste my time playing against a mori.
---
I want to hope, but odds are that the next map rework wikl be L√©ry's, along with a Doctor buff/rework.
---
you can pip with only one kill at red ranks as killer.
---
Sacrifice only affect one out of your 4 emblems and 9 hooks + 1 kill gives you silver in this emblem. 
---
You always get iridescent in chaser emblem if you don't camp hook. Same for malicious if you do 9 hooks and M1 a lot. 
---
Need gold Gatekeeper to assure the pip.
---
The downvotes show the community believes something to be true. They aren't related to what's actually true or not. And when the community is 4 survivors for every 1 killer, you'll have a whole bunch of entitled survivors that think the killer daring to try to win is "toxic."
---
A unit, you might say

My easiest upvote to agree with you that it was the eas- ah fuck it I can't be arsed
---
I get solo queues almost instantly ü§î

too late it's done. Tomorrow we'll get a hotfix with big nerf to every killers.
---
??? swf EXISTING is ridiculous. Im not complaining but its like saying taking away one of the infinity stones from thanos and saying he is weak now.
---
Insta heals were hardly changed, and their issues were never solved while medkits were insanely buffed
---
It'a very true ive been practicing her for like 3 months straight at red ranks and it's defeat after defeat it got to a point where survivors wanted to give me hooks, which - imo is even worse the just being bullied and made fun of.
---
My initial solution was to not make it so you're injured, but instead always exposed. But that goes against the core idea of the perk where you're always injured, and get the benefits of Resilience and such as I said above. 
---
I honestly have no idea how they could change the perk to make it good.
---
It's okay cuz stats say you get 2 kills (I mean sure it's most likely first hooks in endgame with noed and you still derank) but hey you got kills woooee
---
For everyone saying DCs skewed the kill rates, they specifically said games with DCs were discounted from the data, if they had been included, kill rates would likely be much higher
---
Honestly is kind of funny how bad this pisses you off. Dude has some negative views. So what, we all have some negative views.

---
Nah he should have to do the GRE
---
"So the last shall be first, and the first shall be last."
---
You go, sexy beast!
---
I think a start would be to hide the information from the killer. I've seen suggestions to start of healthy and just not be able to heal, without being seen as broken.
---
This would also require the killer to be more aware if they want to catch people out for using it.
---
You mean his doctor game where he complained about DS and he didn't get DS-ed even once?
---
When you use a pride flag you always get matched against the trapper

I mean, she is bugged right now.

When it gets fixed, she gets nerfed.

It was just an example \^\^

she spent like $1000 on the mask, not even joking, its a legit silicon mask.

You got balls, I admit. Usually it's the other person posting these clips.
---
That‚Äôs a very surprising way to end 2019.
---
Imagine Hillbilly and 2 gates close to each other. No chance to open for last survivor. Pretty good job so far BHVR.
---
Last "nerf" she receive that I can remember where the change to bear trap change for EGC. Since then it's been a meme, and the "nerf" was more to adapt the mechanics of the bear trap so that it work with EGC and doesn't just become busted
---
u idiot if u kill 2 survivors its not a win
---
its a draw
---
this rate should be 75% to consider the game is balanced
---
New to Reddit sorry
---
Looks like you need an adblocker my dude
---
If u want 1k hour killers to respond I'd just give up and look at videos from Otzdrava or OhTofu and such bc the other 1k killer mains are just over it
---
Imagine showing this shit to someone in 2018 XD
---
&gt; Nurse before the nerf
---
And survivors aren't allowed to complain about mori, insta-down add ons, or some other crazy combos most killers use at high rank... that makes them die on the hook... through not fault of their own.

I don‚Äôt agree but that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs saying.

This would kill the perk

It counters:

Bubba, Billy, Plague, Legion, Myers, Ghost Face, Trapper's pink add-on, Iri Head Huntress, NOED, MYC, Haunted Ground, Iron Maiden, Devour, Sloppy, Stridor, Coulrophobia, A Nurse's Calling, and Remember Me.
---
It also makes it so you don't have to be healed after an unhook, makes many perks always active and makes it so the killer can't slug you for the 4k.
---
&gt; most of the time all gens get done
---
Actually looking at that chart, all gens get done *less than half the time*.  It's the single most common outcome, but the others add up to more in total.  The kill rate becomes a lot more intuitive when you factor that in.
---
literally for the most time (around 40 hours of game time when I first started) I thought when I was "exposed" the killer could see wherever I wentüò≠üò≠
---
I didn't watch it, but I assume he was trying really hard to avoid DS because it'd kill his momentum a bit. It's one of those perks where just the existence of it is threatening, sorta like how we need to do bones just because NOED exists.
---
Jk I doubt
---
I think balanced landing is still a solid perk. Especially since they're silent now.
---
2 days ago there was a big problem where it wouldn‚Äôt find matches, dbd tweeted about it.. I haven‚Äôt checked or logged in but I would assume by now it should be fixed.. but Maby not if your having issues
---
Lmao the killer just watched thanks for letting people have fun killerü§£‚ù§Ô∏è

The nurse kill rate at red ranks isn't looking too great either. Actually worse than most other survivors.
---
It's basically useless now
---
you stagger when you‚Äôre exhausted now
---
That's the best build for him. Nurse's, Sloppy, ruin and CI. His stalk sucks, so you may as well use him as a zero TR on demand killer

Just because someone is playing Nurse at red ranks doesn¬¥t mean he is good with her though. Rank system in this game is dumb as fuck, I can play a killer I know or a pubstomp killer and easily get to red ranks, and then if I want to try and learn a different one I still basically am a "red rank killer" even though I completely suck with the new one.
---
Rank should really be killer-adjusted. If I get to red ranks with Spirit or Billy I should not be in red ranks when playing Wraith or Clown.
---
My point is that no one else gets to dictate how the other side has fun. 
---
How is that even something you want to argue against? When you say "People get to tell their opponents how to play" people are going to start telling YOU how to play.
---
And when your rationale is "Because I'm not having fun" everyone else can use that same rationale for their benefit.
---
You don't get to use pallets because I don't have fun when I'm pallet stunned.
---
You don't get to use flashlights because I don't have fun when I'm blinded.
---
You don't get to use DS because I don't have fun when I get DS'd.
---
You don't get to hit me off the hook because I don't have fun when I'm tunneled.
---
You don't get to be near the hook because I don't have fun when I'm camped.
---
&gt; You don't get to [x] because I don't have fun when [x].
---
If your statement fits into that form, you're wrong. You don't get to dictate how your opponent plays just because you don't have fun playing against it.
---
And yeah, anyone who does try and argue "My opponent shouldn't do [x] because I don't have fun when [x]" is an idiot whose opinion shouldn't matter.
---
It was great, maybe you're just garbage
---
Badham is tough against newer survivors for sure. It‚Äôs not that the loops are safe, it‚Äôs that there‚Äôs just a ton of unsafe pallet loops, which rewards bad survivor play/poor pallet conservation. The trouble with it for newer killers is that eating the pallets doesn‚Äôt really make a dent in Badham‚Äôs pallet total unless you just get really lucky with the map spawn or something. 
---
I think some better killers/players could give you some better advice, but here‚Äôs my pretty general tips, which have worked well enough for me as someone who does consistently well in low-level games: 
---
-Do your best to remember individual survivors‚Äô habits. 
---
-Don‚Äôt respect pallets unless you‚Äôre playing someone like Myers (in which case, respect the pallet and go into stalk while you do it to get free charge). Expect them to expect you to avoid the stun; most low-level players will assume this and charging past the pallet without stopping will get you a free hit as often as it gets you a mouthful of splinters. 
---
-Create dead zones and remember them. If someone‚Äôs running through the big field dropping pallets left and right, just go through and eat all the pallets as they drop them. They think they‚Äôre a god looper, the teammate unfortunate enough to go through there after them will think otherwise. Once you have a dead-zone established with very few pallets left, prioritize survivors who seem to be heading in that direction. 
---
-Decide which gens you‚Äôre willing to defend and which you would rather give up. The generators up or down stairs (e.g. badham basement) are usually not worth the trouble in my experience; you can try to defend them, but if you notice survivors slipping away from you in and around the preschool, just give it up and wait for them to work a more unsafe gen. Trying to defend generators like that will usually just mean you waste a ton of time in a narrow hallway/staircasw where you have no idea what‚Äôs going on in the rest of the map. 
---
-If they try to play around the pallet, you have a couple options: if it‚Äôs a short loop, it‚Äôs unsafe (and a good number of badham‚Äôs are), and you have a good chance of getting a hit if you can just bait them into vaulting the pallet 2-3 times. When you‚Äôre positioned on one end of the loop while they‚Äôre at the pallet, you go left, they vault, go right, they vault, then you know if you‚Äôre going to go left again they‚Äôre most likely going to vault again, so feint left instead of committing but instantly go right, they‚Äôll vault almost out of habit, and you get an easy hit.
---
What I recommend you to do in this scenario is to aim at your feet. If you see a survivor running close/towards you while you charge your power, just aim straight down. 
---
It is still possible that you can miss, but 95% of the time you will be able to shock them.
---
Iron Will doesn't affect sounds you make when you get hit
---
Calm Spirit does
---
What new stats?
---
Calm Spirit counter tunneling confirmed
---
The only thing that scares me about hag is when they don't use make your choice with cicada and place 5 traps around the hook. I always make sure to tell hag players that don't play that way that I love them afterwards. 
---
It's the main reason I hate playing hag. It's basically encouraging you to face camp while being able to patrol gens at the same time. I think if they just bumped her up to a 115 killer and made any traps within 15 meters of an unhook go inactive for 10 seconds I'd like playing her a lot more.
---
As it is now with how short and slow she is, it's really hard to play her in a non scummy way at high ranks.
---
If you're not having fun as a new player, leave now. It gets much worse.
---
I for one finally bit the bullet and deleted the game from my Steam library so that I no longer own it. Honestly felt like a huge relief. It feels like the balance in the game got better after infinites were removed, then steadily went back downhill to the point where I almost miss infinites. The game may as well be back in early access at this point.
---
I find it hilarious that the Pig is consistently one of the strongest.
---
If all 4 survivors stand still and die, does it mean the game is killer favoured?
---
Fair enough. Just to be clear, that day was actually my "revelation day" as you say. I played a bunch of Ghostface running Thrill Tremors and Corrupt Intervention. That seemed to work for me, been running it since then.
---
Your first second of your chainsaw sprint has a super high sensitivity, which allows you to do curves. After that second it evens out and his turns become a lot slower. Try binding turn right and turn left to q and e and using those to steer instead of the mouse.
---
Eventually that initial turning sensitivity is what will allow you to get chainsaws around corners(curving). That's what really separates the really good billy players from your run of the mill instasaw or bloodlusting M1 billys. That and learning which loops are possible to curve, and which you're better off getting the M1 hit and making them drop the pallet.
---
Yeah I've already seen worse cases tbh. I was just surprised that this scenario happened to me aswell now.
---
Wait, surely /u/consultantdetective is actually correct.  Spirit is picked in ~11.5% of red rank matches.  That's certainly a high enough pickrate to call her overrepresented, but you should still only see her in slightly more than 1 in 9 of those games.
---
I was told to use Claudette for Self-Care and I ended up developing my build which I always used for a good while.
---
Self Care, Deja Vu, Kindred, and Dark Sense.
---
Deadass three eye perks.
---
To be fair, the nurse has never had the stats that people act like she should. The hag was previously the most efficient killer at all ranks. The nurse has poor performance even when you just isolate the red ranks.
---
However.. previous stats were isolating different platforms, and I feel like all of these have been brought together for this set.
---
PC Nurse has a lot more viability than console nurse, and therefore gets played more.
---
Based on the stats they just released, the nerfs were due to ridiculously high kill rates, not whining.
---
Everyone is just completely ignoring the red rank stats lmao.
---
It's not only Haddonfield. Ormond, Badham, Father Campbell's Chapel, Ironworks of Infinites... Also calling them lazy is kinda shitty of you, the game is changing a lot and we have new content every 3 months.
---
And it certainly didn't bother you in the game it seems...
---
I think you'd have to be a pretty competent nurse to feel comfortable playing her at red ranks. You don't get many potato's up there or they just get demolished.
---
This is Dead By Daylight. It's all about repairing generators so you and your comrades can escape while a bloodthirsty killer is always around, hunting you. The best way to survive is to work as a team, to be as efficient as possible with the tools you are given and the skills you possess. 
---
But wait, because none of that matters because if three of your teammates die the hatch opens, which is the game's way of saying "Fuck doing the objective, fuck the tension, this is now a gambling game. You either find the hatch before the killer or you don't and it comes down to chance and nothing more. Sure, the killer may be quite mobile which decreases your chance of finding the hatch, but it's still about chance. Find the hatch and you can say I win, bye bye." 
---
Now what happens, the killer closes the hatch. That's it, you fucked up helping your team escape by not having the generators repaired in time and now you fucked up saving yourself by not winning this coin flip of finding the hatch. The killer has beaten you, twice! You lose! You should have, anyway. Because you're still alive. Why are you still alive? Oh, that's right, this is your third chance the game is giving you to escape. This time you just have to stand around and press M1 for a minute and you win. What's that? You complain the gates are too close together? How is that unfair? You've had 2 previous chances to escape that you've managed to waste. 
---
Wait, there's a secret 4th chance to escape! Bring a key. It has 0 counterplay. Talk to me again about fair.
---
But the Most of your point are nothing that the dev can do to prevent it. Because it is the freedom of how people play that affects it.
---
Facecamp : the dev made it that you get less bloodpoint/emblem point for stay close to hook. How will you punish facecamper and what justified the punishment , because people can say : "I did not camp because I saw survivor near the hook"
---
Teamfarm: dev did the :Less points for unsafe hook. But people still do it because sometimes you need to , and sometimes just farm, but there is no way to know for sure if you are not in the game and observed from bothside.
---
Farming as/with killer: I don't know man. There is no way to regulated this, since every change can be justified as "I am bad at this game"
---
&gt;I mean shouldn't be the distance a bit further?
---
It depends. If the minimum amount of pallets isn't filled by the time all pallet spawns with the proper distance have been taken, it starts overriding the distance rule. 
---
This is why you can still see double pallet jungle gyms in some maps.
---
But is it fun? If I want a simple M1 killer with stealth I can play Wraith
---

Orrrrrr when I play clown for fun. Don‚Äôt gen rush me
---
Classic meta build :
---
Dead hard (David), Decisive Strike (Laurie), Borrowed time (Bill), Adrenaline (Meg)
---
Michaela Myers ? Michelle Myers ?
---
Most would need a perk and a lot of luck i.e NOED or Haunted grounds. Myers etc can do it but hes on a time limit and survivors normally scatter.
---
Nobody can do it as effectively as Billy since he has unlimited instadowns, map crossing mobility and doesn‚Äôt rely on perks to do it.
---
Honestly while it would be a better daily it would probably make survivors run around dropping all the pallets just screwing their team in the long run
---
I can't say I disagree with anything you've said. Good points.
---
It's easy to look at these statistics and say that thins are imbalanced in favor of killers, but I think they actually reflect other problems:
---
1) The red rank statistics show the disparity in ranking up between survivors and killers. When the developers implemented the most recent iteration of the emblem system, there was outcry among survivors that it was too difficult to rank up. In response, the requirements to earn certain emblem tiers was lowered for survivors *but not for killers.* Consequently, this means that in order for a killer to stay in red ranks, their inherent skill has to be greater than survivors in those ranks, because the killer emblem system is inherently more punitive for bad play at those ranks. Simply put, it is easier for survivors to reach (and stay) at red ranks while it is an order of magnitude more difficult for killers, so it's obvious that the killers who are able to stay there would display a higher kill rate, because such a kill rate is required. 
---
2) Piggybacking off point number one, these statistics show (at least to me) that there is a strong disparity in the overall skill level of survivors. If these kill rates represent the mean, then the difference between the mean and the (apparently) outlier high-level survivors is quite large. Upon reflection, I think this skill gap is pretty discernible, at least on my part. Between playing the game myself and watching other streamers/YouTube content, I probably observe anywhere from 30-35 matches a day (I know, I'm lame) and this phenomenon, in my experience, is quite observable. 
---
3) Balancing the game around kill rates is inherently flawed. Survivors can die and rank up. Killers can kill four people and depip. If you're going to have a ranking system, and more importantly if you have any aspirations of this game being competitive, then balancing the game around *ranking* is the only true metric to measure success. If you really want to have a 50/50 balance, then you have to tune the game in such a way that a killer/survivor pips in 50 percent of matches. I wouldn't go so far as to say that you should make that curve linear, though. You probably don't want to scale it in such a way that a killer/survivor has a 25 percent chance of two-pipping in matches. Personally, I would suggest that two-pipping should occur around 10-15 percent of the time in order to truly reward exceptional level play.
---
bad bot

The name is enough in this case.

I-I‚Äôm a girl LMAO

---
For those of you who are bored with x10 nurses, i like playing clown. You can loop me all you want but please don't gen rush me. Lets have fun
---
he finger lickin'
---
I mean yeah. But fyi the game was already over as you can see and I just found this right at the end as i was trying to find the last person. So I can say that I was somewhat lucky there.
---
Give this man silver
---
Agreed, lets reverse The hatch closing so The survivors only have 2 chances instead of 3.
---
This is incorrect in a couple of respects.
---
First of all, it is not impossible to safety pip or even pip without at least 2 sacrifices in red ranks.
---
Red ranks are ranks 1-4, and you cannot depip more than 1 rank at a time. In fact, you only regularly downrank from a depip at rank 1. This means even if you did need two kills in order not to depip, you would not derank out of red ranks with those depips. These less-than-two-kills games would be and are still counted toward red ranks.
---
The kill rate is above 50% for all ranks, so the survivorship bias argument makes little sense. Red rank stats do not noticably deviate from global stats to even assume biases are at play to begin with, rather the most sensible interpretation is that the numbers scale with player experience and skill in expected fashion.
---
And to use this post to clarify on some other points I've seen people make to try and invalidate these stats:
---
Anecdotes. People have no good grasp of the sheer size of this data set. They talk about their games and things that happen in them such as survivors being afk as if they matter statistically. Say you are a reasonably active player and have a thousand hours in this game. There are some twenty-thousand players playing this game at any moment. This means that *every 3 minutes*, a thousand hours of your game experience is matched. These stats cover a period of 3 months. Do I even need to show the math on how many minutes there are in 3 months? It takes these stats mere minutes to account for the equivalent of a player's entire game experience, every game they have ever played, and that times a hundred thousand. Any individual experience is but a dust particle in this room of data.
---
"It doesn't account for things like perks and add-ons or offerings and items used." - It does. Perks and add-ons and offerings and items are things both sides can *and do* use at any time, and they affect the outcome of matches. These stats include all of those outcomes. The idea of balance is naturally a hollistic view of the game, including all of these perks and add-ons and items and offerings, and since the only logical statistical assumption is that both sides use these things, the use of these things does not skew the stats in any biased fashion, but in a way that is completely valid to say things about balance. For instance, let's make even the most outlandish assumption and say all killers used an Ebony Mori in every single game for these whole three months. Now people would say "but killers are only performing so well because they use Ebonies all the time" - but they *did* use Ebonies all the time: they are something killers have access to and can use, and any way in which they affect the outcome is still a valid result to be used to argue there could be an imbalance there, because if in actuality killers do use them often enough to affect the outcome, they are necessarily part of the game balance concern. Just like insta-heals would be (did I mention that there has most likely been a significant increase in insta-heal usage before the nerf, and that that period falls within the bounds of this data set? How does that affect survival rates, I wonder‚Ä¶)
---
Bias. This point is related to the previous one: People bring up ways in which things would inflate kill rate, such as survivors that mess around and don't even try all that much to do gens, but they fail to realize that there are also things that inflate survival rates, such as likewise killers that mess around and don't even try hard to kill people, or even let them go intentionally. Things that skew results in such a way have to be assumed to skew them equally in both ways, evening or cancelling each other out, so to speak.
---
Similarly, there's the idea that survivors are worse survivor players than killers are killer players in red ranks, and this would skew the results. But apart again from the fact that the trend holds true throughout all ranks, even if it is that way, it still means the status quo, the actual reality of matches being played, sees killer players do more than well enough including in red ranks. So what if the ranking system is more lenient and allows worse survivors to enter red ranks while the threshold for killers is higher by whatever amount? It still means that playing killer, you can do well in red ranks on average. That that is because you get worse opponents might be the case, but you *do* get them, you don't get 4 good survivor players often, not even often enough to make you fall below an average of more than 2 kills per match. If they were to change the ranking system to make it more tough for players to reach red ranks (and if the results would noticably change then, because they of course might not), then other approaches to game balance could be in order, such as a rank-specific balancing. The same can be said for SWF. But until then, it doesn't matter if that is actually the reason why kill rates are so high in red ranks, because they simply are so high.
---
Disconnects. I'm not even sure disconnects are factored into these stats, and either way, while Peanits has stated before that taking disconnects out of the equation does not actually change too too much about the rates (within the realm of 5%, I think), there are two things to consider: 1. disconnects typcially happen in games survivors are already losing, taking them out would skew results unfairly for survivors as well; 2. disconnects do happen and they lose survivors games and ruin their experience. That's not to say disconnects should be considered for game balance, but they also cannot be excluded categorically; they are part of the game experience as it stands and thus have to at least be a concern tangential to game balance because ultimately, game balance is also a lot about creating a good game experience.
---
Something to maybe make some people reflect on their attitude towards these stats: Imagine if roles were reversed, and survivors would have a survival rate of at least 60% against the strongest killers, and up to 70+% against the weaker ones. How would you view those stats, and would you likewise feel compelled to look for things that might have artifically inflated or unfairly skewed those results? Ironically enough, it's the opposite from what Ive seen: when presented with the fact that last time's 80% survival rate at rank 1 was a technical mistake in their method to take stats, and that in actuality the rates were closer to 40%, there appeared to be not few people that held onto those 80% and argued vaguely there must be some truth to them.
---
I don't think killers are unreasonably overpowered. I know that the game at its core more-so favours survivors to escape. I am actually glad to see killers do well statistically. What I mostly don't like is the narrative that killers are immensely underpowered and have to play their hearts out to get a kill or two, and that we'd need more and more survivor nerfs. The reality of actual matches being played is a very different one, and yes, this is also because many survivor players are bad the game, albeit not only does that tell us something about how easy the game really is (it very obviously isn't, most people are not good at the game, particularly so on the survivor side), but it also shows that if you are a good killer player, you can do well in and even win the majority of your matches, that you get rewarded for practicing and improving in the game. What's there to complain about? The one-in-a-hundred 4-SWF composed of actually good players that give you a handful of long chases and hooks, maybe 1 kill and a 6 minute match? That experience is over in 6 minutes, and you can move on to the next games most of which will most likely be an a lot better experience. Just like even a good 4-SWF sometimes gets beaten in a handful of minutes.
---
Some pallets are way closer than these. Like ones on certain cold wind locations.
---
How so?  
---
A balanced game would have the average game be a draw, not the killer kill 3 out of 4 survivors.

I'm not saying it's not his best build, I'm saying it's boring as shit. That's why I don't play him or forever freddy. If your optimal build revolves around making the game take longer, I'd rather just play someone else that's more fun for me and the four other players in the game.

What is happening

Meg has 3 noob friendly perks. Or claudette
---
It is ? I ve never got it as daily
---
This was on Xbox I don‚Äôt think his controller was broken.
---
I think that the biggest problem rn is that ranking up isn't actually a reward, but a punishment in a way (harder opponents). People have been asking for rank reset rewards for months to have some upside to facing sweaty swf and tryhard killers, but apparently that would be too much of a reward for playing well.
---
The chase one?

Seems a bit shit.

In the asylum 2 pallets can spawn in the entrance it's quite stupid ngl

I like the artwork although I‚Äôm not a fan of the question. That‚Äôs just my opinion, the whole piece is great.
---
Dead hard
---
Don't worry about it.

I mean the game is designed to be frustrating to begin with.

That‚Äôs actually wholesome.

That will most likely be due to the archives

Infinites were removed???
---
In a game where sounds is so important, having the sound "Lie" to you is not a great thing.  it is in fact bad.    A blind man could be able to play this game with sounds only....    
---
I agree about the screwing dynamics on certain maps.  Which is why the walking distance mechanic could/should be only active while killer and survivor are on **Different floor**.
---
Only clown and demodoggo are worse in red ranks now.
---
Oh, but the nerf was very minor, say otherwise and everyone will scream at you.
---
totally agree
---
So heartbreaking. 
---
Also that movie death is sad.
---
automatic scroll levels are more annoying imo
---
Yeah but most common doesn‚Äôt mean the strongest.
---
If you have [Feng Min](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Feng_Min) unlocked, you should level her since she has nice noob-friendly perks to help get you started
---
* Technician: Helps you get started with learning how to hit skillchecks
---
* Lithe: Straightforward exhaustion perk to help you make distance from killer
---
* Alert: Helps you build game sense, see where the killer is and act accordingly from what it shows you (hide/do gens/go for save)
---
If you don't have Feng, go for [Dwight](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dwight_Fairfield) for his bond (see survivors within 36m), which is especially invaluable for solo queue survivors, helping you know what to do in the trial, similar to Feng's alert.
---
Of course the point is to show he‚Äôs evil to the bone.
---
Meg is prob the only charakter giving you 3 good perks
---
So you need no mither and dead hard or else you are fucked?
---
Oh shoot, I though that landing would be silent as well.
---
You say that, but Ruin is the most optimal perk in the game solely because it makes the game take longer.
---
Hell, I decided to do some Killer games yesterday, played the Doctor and the game lasted 12 minutes with a DC and a 3k, played Wraith and the game was over in 4 minutes because my Wraith is level 10 with Sloppy Butcher being his only slowdown perk.
---
The game doesn't last long enough to be fun for Killer if you aren't either playing the characters who can be everywhere (Freddy, Nurse, Spirit, Oni, Billy) or are slowing the game down to a snails pace (Trapper, Plague, Ghostface, Pig, Wraith, anyone else, really).
---
This is why people say gens get done too quickly. You either have to slow the game down (just a little bit) or you're stuck playing a quarter of the killer roster.
---
I loved how on the 2nd he keeps stabbing well after they‚Äôre dead, like he‚Äôs got anger issues he‚Äôs got to work out. That was scary.
---
No with the pallets suggestion is to add those daily
---
But the pipping part is not completely true, even if you do very well as killer, when 3 survivors escape, you can be happy if you get a black pip on higher ranks.
---
But how else do people let other drivers know they are mad? If I don't fishtail in my dually coming out of the Tim Horton's parking lot then other drivers may not be aware that they have run out of hash browns.
---
Who tf wants to be exposed all game?
---
There is a point in that sense they could still be saved by bodyblocking teammates, flashlight or pallet saves, hook sabotage, etc. A mori would completely negate that.
---
Otaku survivor when?
---
because u idiot a killer will always get a draw and 2 survivors will always win
---
Of course we're playing them wrong. The right way would be not to play them at all.
---
*"Exposed? Does that mean the killer can see my genitals?"*
---
And even the chase is underwhelming. Throw the pallet early and there's nothing he can do about it.
---
I think he‚Äôs talking about how DC punishments won‚Äôt work because instead of DCing the survivor can just off themselves on their first hook?
---
Not really sure
---
Keep saying that when The Oni releases.
---
I'm working on trying to ignore toxicity too. I just noticed your user flair, fellow Trapper.
---
Oh I see, I don't think that will be a skin available in game though will it?
---
You need to work on that anger issue of yours.  
---
Why always? Average means average. Good killers would most likely get at least 3 most of the time.
---
Probably a Dwight
---
Survivorship bias. The stats reflect only killers that maintain that kill ratio in red ranks and does not include the ones that depip and drop out of red. So of course the players strong enough to stay red will have a better ratio because they have to.
---
I remember arguing about clown being the weakest, and some people actually had the tutaj to fight to their fuckin death that clown is good because he counters looping
---
Or nurse nerfs - i could understand recharging blinks in a chase, but outside of it? You just killed the nurse entire map pressure
---
Trapper is amazingly fun just bc of the fact he is low tier and barely enough people know how to effectively play him makes traps that much stronger
---
Love your name dude üòÇ
---
Accurate.
---
It‚Äôs because of the new vault shit. They are just doing there challenges.
---
The only reason you see streamers bitch about "Optimal Teams" is because they play the game for 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, without realizing more than half of their games in-stream consist of 3ks and 4ks. Then they get 1 SWF game and bitch about it like the end of the world and that SWF is op and ruins all their games. DBD has to have the worst content creators by-far for this reason. Most dbd streamers just push their own fucking agenda on their viewers causing a circle jerk of opinions to happen. (Except for a few people like Monto and Otz, they're cool)
---
All good, man
---
Awww, that was really cute!
---
This gave me aids
---
Could be interesting w/ dead hard, resilience and something else
---
But they couldn't use, like, Feng's? Meg's seems like almost the worst choice relative to appearance, is all I'm saying. It feels... dissonant.
---
I saw one two pallets like 2 metres next to each ither in front of that big mac millan building
---
She is still the most picked killer in red ranks at rate of 11.5%, which is roughly 1 in 9 games, which is still a lot all things considered and the variety of killers we have these days.
---
Yeah but it was twice hence 360 !
---
It's a point I been making if u can't DC just kys and don't struggle
---
I can‚Äôt finish the flashlight challenge :(
---
There's been a placeholder sound for almost every single ptb for a new chapter (except stranger things) I'm surprised I've seen so many people confused about this, but i guess there are a lot of new players
---
The most cursed.... Jesus what did they do to her XD
---
Has an apple as a profile pic ?
---
Facques?
---
I didn‚Äôt ask for you to sell. I was only criticizing your work.
---
The 1v4 nature of this game makes it much harder on the killer from a psychological standpoint. Survivors in the post-game chat are always together, so it is easy to gang up on the killer, who is "alone" against multiple people. 
---
Sure, killers can be toxic too, but it is much easier to shake off as a survivor, especially in a SWF where you get validation for your feelings from fellow survivors. "Yeah bro, forget it, that killer was an asshole". As killer, you usually have multiple people to gang up on you and nobody to support you.
---
Uuh.... its still possible right? Survivors fall asleep?
---
A hit brings survivors into the dream world.... The timer brings survivors into the dream world....
---
It Requires You To "Pull" People Into The Dream World
---
What it be then?
---
Wait plague can infect exit switches? didn't know that
---
Ohhh ok
---
Hot
---
"Syntax error"
---
Same can be said for No Mither. Who wants to be injured all game.
---
Its A Possibility, But Im Not So Sure
---
No it literally is how he works
---
Ok. What happens when you hit an awake survivor. Tell me.
---
Yeah, but with nm you can atleast use dead hard and never be slugged.
---
Yes Thank You For Telling Me That He Works Like This, But It Requires You To Bring Survivors Into The Dream World By Using His Power
---
I‚Äôm not meaning like the asshole way of taunting the killer. But giving the killer some game time. My hole point is the matches are to short. Sometimes the gens are completed without a single chase.  Or one person loops a killer while the 3 of us knock gens out.  I just want more time in game vs watching my loading screen.
---
Just run no Mither, damn.
---
See, this can be comboed with dead hard.
---
Everyone seems to think I said most teams are optimal. This is not the case.
---
I would say maybe 10-15% of the teams i face are optimal (at rank 1) but i think the point went right over your head. The complaint is NOT that most teams are optimal and that's unfair.
---
The real complaint is that in those 10-15% of matches, you literally cannot win unless you play one of the strongest killers with a good build. Now while that may not seem like a lot, its generally enough to cause many killer mains to write off half the cast. Nobody wants to be in a match where they can make zero mistakes and still lose.
---
So, this leads killers to only play the best few and use generic, strong builds. That way they can potentially win against any givin team. Even an incredibly optimal one. Then this basically ruins the game for any solo que etc
---
Also fyi I was not referring to any streamers. Nor sure where you got that from.  I was speaking as a rank 1 killer main, from my own experience
---
They Go Into The ‚ÄúDream‚Äù State
---
Okay. Now wouldnt that count as pulling them into the dream?
---
Ehhh... I Guess
---
I‚Äôve done this achievement since his update. By people falling asleep or you hitting them into the dream world counts
---
Thank you someone had to say it
---
Oh... Well Im Dumb
---
What you mean imagine? Thats every billy game for me and its bs
---
8v2 is happening
---
I already have dream demon and I can tell u for a fact I didn't touch the old Freddy
---
8 survivors. Sometimes there are games with 2 killers in it. Community has wanted 2vs8 for a long time. Coincidence? I think not lol
---
Maybe,  prolly not though.  Anyways I'm a good boy so here's the [sauce](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e0b2mx/some_unusual_survivor_renders_yui_kimura/)
---
No worries. I double checked the date I got the trophy. It was early September. So by just playing him, you should eventually get it
---
I don't agree with nor feel that these statistics are honest, personally.
---
Please show me killer win rates without ruin vs win rates with ruin.
---
As a Pig main who does not use Ruin, I can attest that at purple to red ranks, the game becomes VERY stressful to the point that if I am unlucky and do not find a survivor within the first 20-30 seconds, I then have to rely on them making mistakes to give me the opportunity to make quick downs and secure a kill.
---
Too many games are spent with me actually having to consider tunneling and killing 1 survivor as quickly as possible because if I don't, the last couple gens are going to pop and I am going to have zero chance at pressuring an exit gate. Especially when most survivors run Adren, Dead Hard and/or exhaustion perks in general that extend chases for an incredibly long time that hurts killers with low mobility like the Pig.
---
I want to clarify that I play much more survivor than I do killer and I still feel this way because almost every single match in high ranks has a killer running Ruin or an entire slowdown build. I would like to think I am not a bad killer either. I am not fantastic, but I am not garbage and know plenty of tricks for ending chases quickly and pressuring gens. But even so, me choosing to not Ruin in my build for Pig hurts so much when I play in high ranks. 
---
It is very occasional that I come across total potatoes that can't seem to sit and hold M1 for the first minute for a free gen.
---
......I know.
---
well it's not ^^
---
OH HOW THE TABLES HAVE BEEN TURNED EVER IN FREDDY MAINS FAVOR!
---
you can't.
---
Is that true? I haven't played for months lol
---
So the game started as normal. But starting after a few minutes, ever 60 seconds or so, someone new was added to the player list. There were never any survivors actually added in the game, but it just reached the point where there were 10 survivors.
---
thank you for the advices ! i'll try that :)
---
This is really cute. :3
---
Looks pretty broken for huntress tbh lol
---
Simple fix. Make it to where struggle phase is forced. Inb4 "I DoNt WaNt To Be oN HoOk ThE WhOlE tImE". It's like 30 seconds people.
---
No there werent actually 8 survivors. And it started off as just 4. But reached 10 by the end of the game. And the other survivors said they saw it happening too, so it wasn't just on my side.
---
If I don't see 1/3 survivors with chilly after I hook someone up I will patrol around close enough so I can if possible slug hooked guy up and chase saver..., is that fair? Possibly no, do I get more out of it? Fuc* yea and I will do it no matter how much salt you will throw at me in post game chat..., DC will be dealt with next patch that was long time coming...
---
The main problem I have with the hatch spawn is that you have more chance of escaping when 2 or less generators were activated. If more were done, the killer might have already spotted the hatch and when both survivor and killer wait for the hatch, it's the killer that wins.
---
Basically why I don't like this:
---
Doing bad -&gt; more chance of escape
---
Doing good -&gt; less chance to escape
---
This perk makes you immune to the killers abilities like aura reading, the doctors static field when you cant do important objectives like vaulting or dropping a pallet, blindness, myers stalking you doesn't mean he sees you will still increase his tier does same with the ghost face, and "i forgot that perk where your item falls when hit" will be immune to you. Enduring still works on the killer since it just reduces the killers stun effect, SF wont work on you.
---
the thing is there is a missing stat to understand the balance as a whole : the pipping rate weither the survivor is escaping or dying. Right now even if you die as survivor you are likely to pip. So a survivor that should normally be in rank 10 is rank 3 and is versing killers that belongs here and are experienced with the killer they play, making the killer rate higher.
---
Plus evidence-provides 0 evidence
---
If you go out of your way not to stalk you're only half a killer. His stalking works just fine.
---
It is because stalking is really buggy right now on dedicated servers.
---
Level up Meg af
---
This exactly DOESN'T make sense.  
---
The harder to learn, the easier it should be to get kills when u master playing her. 
---
Currently Nurse is in TOP3 lowest kill% in red ranks, where the only people playing her right now are players that have already player Nurse before. 
---
Nurse should've her kill% low in all ranks combined and high kill% in red ranks. The whole point of nerfing her was making it harder for a random nobody to pick her up for the first time and get 4k, not killing her entirely.
---
I struggle to see the point of DC punishments in a casual game that already suffers from queue time but unfortunately its happening whether people like it or not. 
---
All we can do now is adapt to this new reality and I can already see people complaining about survivors trolling the game after being unhooked while trying to leave the game through suicide or people demanding punishments for suicide and whatnot.
---
but 50% = 2 Kills doesn't let you pip in most cases which is not a win.
---
Does it work? 
---
I think not XD
---
well considering the nurse is only the weakest when the stats are for those of every rank and not red ranks, nurse is only in that position because those in the lower ranks dont know how to play her.
---
Point is, you don't go against Swf as often as everyone claims they do. Goes for streamers too. Solo survivors make up for over 50% of matches.
---
Which means, if it takes the strongest killer perk build to deal with the strongest swf teams, it seems pretty balanced. It's like going to overwatch and complaining you can't use X hero in Y meta. There is simply things in games that are stronger than some things and won't stand a chance, and vice versa.
---
Also, before anyone goes up in flames, achknowledge there is problems with balance regardless of stats. 
---
I pulled streamers comment from the fact the most vocal people about SWF are some streamers, and they seem to use that as part of their agenda in arguments and swaying their audience into thinking SWF is massively Op lol
---
Yeah,you basically cannot escape unless the switches are really far away.
---
thats all ranks. and that means the data includes the lower ranks that dont know how to play her.
---
Surviving is consider as a win for survivors which is stupid as you are more likely to pip (win) when you die, since you spend more time in the game gettingmore emblem points.
---
Nurse has probably the highest learning curve, but Huntress is the hardest killer to be good at.
---
I love how Demo purrs a little bit when you pick a survivor up. It‚Äôs like... aww... now go on the hook you pos
---
Only if they throw a pebble in your face lol
---
What about the original and H20?
---
Well if someone wants to ruin the game for everyone, I'll ruin game for him
---
Any killer can defend this by just walking back and forth between the switches
---
Sooo.... is it impossible now?
---
This explains it perfectly
---
That's because Rob Zombie has a habit of making characters that are generally impossible to relate to and irredeemable, which is why I don't think I have found a single one of his movies enjoyable, because all of the irredeemable, uninteresting pieces of shit are the ones that win and never get what they deserve.
---
Like...c'mon, if you are gonna have an irredeemable character, at least make them interesting or have some sort of relatable or understandable motivation like Joker.
---
Everyone in Rob Zombie's movies are just soulless, rehashed psychos usually played by wife who can't act for shit.
---
And the other perk. Cause no mither is kinds the same.
---
Who won? Seems to me everyone crossed the line at same time...
---
There is going to be new archives ever 3 months if I remember correctly new stories with new characters and new prizes
---
8v2 will happen.
---
no mither players i come across are wicked suicidally involved from my experience. fun all around.
---
what the heck
---
Could you see the other 6?
---
Devs said they cannot do anything about that because the exit tiles have few spaces in which they can spawn or something like this. The only maps in which survivors can easily escape are the closed maps because they are in completely opposite sites
---
I feel like the question doesn‚Äôt quite go with the huntress personality imo seems more of an uwu huntress thing to say
---
Welcome to RNG. I feel the same way about gen spacing on large maps. You learn to get over it.
---
Not guaranteed but likely. Its also possible to escape and depip
---
need 13 emblem points to pip at red ranks :
---
Silver in Devout = 2
---
Iridescent in chaser = 4
---
Iridescent in Malicious = 4
---
Gold in Gatekeeper = 3
---
13 points with only one kill. Until purple ranks it's easier so you don't even need to kill one dude.
---
Nope. There were only 4 survivors in game.
---
A big spider is not really a killer it‚Äôs more of a big spider
---
I feel like this data is more because they made Nurse harder to play, so now you have to have at least 30% of your brain functioning in order to get kills with her, as opposed to old Nurse where your brain could be dribbling out your ass and you could still get a 4k against a toxic SWF on Haddonfield.
---
‚ÄúElectro Cabello‚Äù
---
Killrate went down by less than 10% for the nurse after the nerf. So yeah, it's very minor and people are right to scream at you. Well not screaming per se, we're not savages.
---
Not to mention the statistics are always biased because she's a very high skill-cap killer and people need to lose a lot before they start winning.
---
It's like Demogorgon, since it's the most recent killer, I would take his stats with a pinch of salt. In a few months when people have mastered him his killrate will probably get a nice bump.
---
Tbh killers benefit from it more than just that, more points, pop, etc
---
people just dont know how to play her nurse is still broken but even harder for new nurse players to learn
---
Damn. What a shame.
---
I see your point but if you just assume the enemy is going to tryhard then you can either bring the best build and match them or play suboptimally and not complain when you‚Äôre at a disadvantage.
---
A team of survivors with the best build isn‚Äôt screwed against a iri/mori huntress ‚Äî they both have the best stuff so it‚Äôs even.
---
The problem I think comes with the availability of builds.  Unlike in league of legends where your set-up is always available to you, in DbD it‚Äôs RNG whether you get the good stuff in your blood web.  So you as a survivor might not even have access to a good toolbox when the killer has a mori and then, yeah, you‚Äôre in a bad way.  Changing this feature is how I think the game can become more competitive.
---
This reminds me of that infamous page called "Offended?" in Encyclopedia Dramatica.
---
Mind if I ask for the perk texture pack?
---
First time I'm happy to see Prayer Beads in action.
---
^This.
---
I don't understand the extreme hatred against SWF in this sub.Once someone gets hit by the seal team 6 swf squad people start to cry about swf while these people are like 5% of the total survivor population.I literally bought this game because I wanted to play with my friends and GF
---
You don't have a clue what you're trying to talk about.   
---
Camping Leatherface can't do shit against Borrowed Time Deliverance and Decisive Strike working against camping.   
---
Those three perks \*destroy\* camping, and \*everybody\* knows it.   
---
Try again lol
---
They just need to buff it by starting healthy and removing the broken symbol. You get hit and you are broken forever.
---
Wraith don't even need to use his power, he just need to do the walk.
---
Is anybody going to talk about the legion having a higher kill rank than the nurse hag demo and clown
---
Except some red ranks killers can also decide to switch and start playing Nurse, and they bring the stats down because it's an even harder environment to learn to play her. Not to mention dailies, achievement hunting, etc. Anyway, point is, noob nurses exists to skew the stats even in red ranks.
---
Weird. I remember a similar bug happening in like 1.0 or 1.1 or something. Early days. Never thought I‚Äôd see this again.
---
"Of course the players who play well enough to stay in red ranks stay at red ranks."
---
It doesn't change the fact that killers who play in red ranks average those stats. They play well enough to maintain it and these are what they pull for results.
---
rare moments.
---
Usually when I do party up with a friend or two, we play terribly because we're too busy laughing about everything. We're there to have fun, not to tryhard, and I think that's probably true for most instances.
---
She looks like a female Quentin
---
Overperforming ‚Ñ¢
---
WTF this game actually got an Update?
---
I still don't think you understand what I'm saying. Yes I agree that the best killers with their best builds against the best survivors with their best builds is pretty balanced. That's the point I'm trying to make tho lol
---
As a survivor, you have to use meta perks and play with a team (or get really lucky as far as teammates) in order to have a chance against the top killers.  If you dont do these things, you will simply sometimes face a killer that you and your whole team can do nothing but die against. Becuase of this, most survivors run meta perks, and most would prefer SWF over solo que.
---
Similarly, killers need to use top tier killers with meta perks in order to have a chance against the top survivors. If they dont do these things, they will simply sometimes face a group they cannot kill no matter how flawlessly they play. Because of this, most killers run meta killers and perks.
---
You see, facing a top opponent is not the majority result for either side, but becuase of the risk of it, it causes most people to use meta things. I believe the huge disparity between solo que and optimal 4man swf along with the disparity between killers (compare clown to freddy and give me one reason someone would ever use clown) is the reason we see very little diversity in this gane.
---
That was my point. I am not some activist trying to fight for one side and say the other is oppressive or op. I'm trying to state factual reasons why it seems so many killers (and survivors) go full tryhard, when in fact they just want a chance.
---
Yeah even at high ranks I usually don‚Äôt get swf kill squad. I‚Äôll get one occasionally but I just move on and get a better game next time
---
I think we have the same point
---
But the emblem system is not related to the kill rate and popularity. Only if you want to talk exclusively about red rank data, and the invalidate that data because ‚Äúrank doesn‚Äôt meant anything‚Äù is this anything other than a non sequitur.
---
&gt;  a shit timer mechanic
---
that give survivors some counter play possibilities.
---
Hmm, I searched one of them throught Steam and they had Dbd as one of their games
---
He slaughtered the Inmates. But not only them but the Co-Workers and his Prot√©g√©, too
---
Ever since end game collapse came out 90% of my games as survivor are like this. It's like anything else in the game. Gotta give killers that one last break or chance to do something worth while.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, yeah I've tried that but most the stuff is just backpacks/mugs and I was kinda hoping for something a bit cooler (E.g Poster/canvas or figurines)
---
Highest skill floor = less kills on average because the average Nurse sucks. Then you have Spirit who's really easy to p√∏ay and what do you know? She has the most kills on average.
---
That was tintin right?
---
I read the books before!
---
The emblem system doesn't reward survivors who preform well, so the kinds of people who wouldnt escape vs those killers because they lack the game knowledge  and looping skills do end up in those games.
---
I guarantee if we went back to the victory system rather than this crappy chores based system, some more relevant data would show up.
---
Yeah, you can juke a shitty Nurse really easily. No one's talking about potato Nurses. It is nearly impossible to juke a good one. That's the point. She teleports through objects, in case you weren't aware, so anytime you do anything that animation locks you, you get hit for free. 
---
New Nurse is still very good. Every single good streamer shares this opinion with me. Otz, Tofu, Tru3, Zubat, etc. If you suck with current Nurse, you sucked with old Nurse.
---
If I don‚Äôt slug I get genrushed. I or I just want to chase the other guy that is sandbagging me. Not sure why it is a requirement now to pick survivors up after downing them
---
If solo kindred. If SWF prove thyself and BT
---
Honestly good. I finally got my adept legion today and i never wanna play them again
---
He's easily top 4 right now
---
U could higher a artist to make u a poster that u can print
---
sorry, I forgot about survivor rule #436678
---
Yea BAD killer we all know that Survivors rulebook number 354 say "After hooking survivors killer MUST go to the opposite side of map and count to 10 before even turning in direction of hooked survivor" there is no proxy camping there is patroling, outside of killer beign s cun* and standing in front of hooked person face camping you really have no excuse and even then..., just go do gens to punish him...
---
Let people like them have something to bitch about, keeps them out of the game longer, meanwhile i'll go have fun on both sides and can take part in discusions with fair and well informed viewpoints.
---
Just because someone streams doesn't mean they know everything.
---
Nurse was always the worst killer. Her teleport was incredibly janky and it only worked like half the time, and now it's even worse.
---
Iron will on Jane? What a waste :(
---
For real, I haven't seen this many trappers since the dark "traps under hook" days
---
Yeah, depends on how much that would cost, but that's a great idea. If someone on here makes posters/figures and doesn't charge extreme costs then I'd definitely rather support someone smaller.
---
nobody says this
---
I love Freddy a lot, but it‚Äôs hard to stop playing ghostface so much.
---
Been meaning to try spirit for ages
---
Okay, now I know you're either a troll or don't know what you're talking about. Nurse has always been the best killer, per consensus of the entire DbD community. The only killer that can beat a cream of the crop, full meta perk on comms swf team is Nurse.
---
Are you sure ? Look deez arms, those spooky, beautiful juicy arms (not as much as Herman tho but still):https://external-preview.redd.it/aSSB6W9QRjO0qI56Qh8E38PJ4RvXMo5SxGndOvJLmSg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e736140e80ad9342670140df3900e0648d5eb722

Also myers is actually smaller than both of them if you look at their in game model. Doctor doesn't look as imposing because he's leaning a bit when run, unless he's in treatment mode, in that case he stand perfectly still and you can see how tall he actually is. He is the 2nde tallest killer after Oni and before Huntress.
---
Balanced was a problem perk and the devs would require to limit map design to allow less abusable spots for it. Say what you want, id rather they nerf a perk than potentionaly limiting maps in their design.
---
Almost every perk has counterplay, except whispers and survivor perks that don't interact directly with the killer.
---
The fact you think perks play the game for you is all I need to know honestly.
---
This idea of nurse "being the best killer" didn't exist prior to a couple months ago. Literally no one complained prior to chapter 13.
---
I do the same. My issue is when the killer goes and slugs every survivor and looking all over the map. It makes for boring games to be just left there dying
---
U should find a artist u like if u wanna higher them I would imagine a poster would cost around 50-60 bucks depending on the amount of detail
---
Bruh what
---
Even if I grant your premise, which I don‚Äôt, but even if I did the overall across all ranks. It literally doesn‚Äôt matter how accurately the emblems reflect skill if you‚Äôre analyzing the total set of data.
---
Also, there is no way you can possibly guaranteed what you just did.
---
I believe it was intentional but now they are playing it off as a bug.  Too many people would leave a lobby when they were paired with someone they shouldn't have been.
---
We have a containment breach SCP-049 has escaped
---
Not really.  In most cases red rank players don't play Nurse there if they hadn't before due to tough start  and just prefer to go for killers like Billy, Freddy or Spirit that mostly require basic game knowledge or nothing at all to play decent. Especially after her nerfs, if u haven't been playing her before then there's no reason to learn her now after she's been nerfed.
---
Can't even remember if I ever saw 1st time Nurse in rank 1 before, ofc I haven't.
---
We found the rank 12 Blendette boys!
---
This has been a popular opinion at least since I started last year. Probably longer, considering her strength. You're just wrong. Not much else to say. 
---
Also lol at the notion no one complained before 13, people have been bitching about Omega Blink forever, as well as multi-blink Nurse.
---
I love this template and the use you make of it. Take my upvote sir.
---
I just think it‚Äôs hilarious they added a new ‚Äúwow unique healing perk‚Äù in the same chapter as the killer who absolutely makes any healing either unusable or obsolete.
---
all of a sudden red rank survivors are bad potatoes? What happened to the 4 man SWF on comms with DS/DH/BT/Adrenaline everyone on reddit had apprently went against every match?
---
That would only work if you made it so you don't start the game injured, but just can't heal.
---
If they just remove the broken icon, you started injured, so killer knows you have it anyway
---
If they made it look like you're healthy on the UI they'd find you injured, so killer knows you have it anyway
---
If they made you look healthy on the out-side but go down in one hit, the killer would down you in one hit, so killer knows you have it anyway
---
making it start you as healthy would
---
1. Destroy the memes or running it with OoO. As you're a simple asshole in killer eyes now
---
2. Take the challenge away, as it makes early-game easier and makes you play like a puss until you get hit once
---
3. not have the start game injured "bonus"
---
All we need is a bloodpoint bonus.
---
you screw yourself over, make the game boring for 3 other survivors, and make it unwinnable for one. Stop justifying a scrub tactic and learn to apply pressure so you can actually have a 4K before the game is done. You won't get better at the game if you just confirm one kill and let the other survivors plow through the gens.
---
That was Philip Ojomo, or the Wraith.
---
Yup. Pretty much.
---
Imagine a gamemode like the scarecrow mission from Batman arkham asylum
---
It's been like this for months since EGC was added. There's no limitations for door spawns except a minimum distance of four tiles and only one exit per slot. Killers are so overwhelmingly favored to win end-game stalemates now that they can close the hatch and watch both doors - against mobility orientated Killers, there's no way in hell you can get out by nearby doors, even on bigger maps.
---
I've always thought a survivor should have an equal chance of escaping as the Killer has of killing them. That makes it fair. That makes it tense for both sides. As it stands now, Killers just find a hill to sit on, watching both gates, while the Survivor curses the Entity for spawning the exits too close together to actually do anything. I'm sorry, but there's nothing interesting to me about EGC when I'm just standing around, either waiting for the Survivor to hopelessly throw themselves at a switch, or go hide in a locker for three minutes. It's the lamest shit in this game right now - it's absolutely no fun for either side.
---
In my opinion, Exit Gates should absolutely always spawn opposite one another approximately. At the least, never on the same side, never close together on adjacent sides, and never on the same end of parallel sides.
---
At least kindred is being somewhat buffed to help that problem though
---
So trapper actually has counter play to doors plus u can just disarm the trap alerting the survivor
---
NECA makes really high quality action figures based on horror characters like Michael Myers, Leatherface, Freddy, etc. They‚Äôre only around $30 and they‚Äôre pretty awesome.
---
Y‚Äôall should play leatherface, his insane map pressure is op :)
---
iTs rNg pRoCedurLLy gENuRAted

She's just incredibly unfun to play now. I say this as an ex nurse main that spent years playing her. I actually just can not have fun, even if I do 4k.
---
r/TheCouncilOfAsh
---
It‚Äôs not that Kate‚Äôs not pretty but when it comes to the face model Janes is just gorgeous compared to any other survivor.
---
It's the old one but improved
---
I already said I don't know about Huntress b/c I don't play her. 
---
Also, the mobility is as big of a part of Billy's kit as his saw. Idk about you, but I haven't had a ton of problems traversing Hawkins as Billy or getting saws. Let's not forget about trapping people in the isolation room. 
---
Hawkins is a good map because 1) Narrow halls make it hard to lose and easy to find survivors 2) Mostly unsafe pallets 3) No true God loops(even the BL room in the middle). It's very unsurprising that Hawkins is the deadliest map for survivors. 
---
I read someone say that Trapper is good on Hawkins, because you can bottleneck people through certain areas easily, but Trapper has his own issues. 
---
Plague is hit or miss. She lacks map pressure, which is a problem if the team is organized, but the one time I played Hawkins with her I 4k'd. But that's just anecdotal, so it doesn't mean anything.
---
Agreed, though the fact I can't walk 2 feet without bumping into a hook is rediculas. And I don't even play survivor! Too many hooks it never made sense to me. Why should there be a hook literaly everywhere?
---
To me it‚Äôs because of how little of the game is in your control. You have to put your faith in your teammates (if you have them) *and* your opponents to play a certain way in order to have a fun experience. That‚Äôs why, in spite of people complaining about it all the time, the pipping and score systems are set up the way they are; to punish unfun playstyles (hook camping, full immersion) and reward fun, fair-ish play. 
---
Idk if you‚Äôve ever played Overwatch, but it feels kind of similar to me; you‚Äôre super reliant on your teammates playing as an actual team except in some very niche circumstances, and you‚Äôre reliant on the enemy team not playing the insanely-sweaty-and-super-unfun pseudo-meta in order for you to actually be able to enjoy your match, win or lose. 
---
Lack of control over the experience = more frustration over bad experiences happening in spite of your own best efforts = anger/rage. 
---
TL;DR - even if you play optimally *and* go out of your way to be a ‚Äúfun‚Äù person to play with/against, you can still lose because of things you have absolutely no control over.
---
No

'I'm pretty sure' a small group of ppl playing Nurse like crap doesn't make her the 3rd worst killer %wise.  If u play her once a week and get 0k, it's not gonna take down her kill% that much given that most of her matches are played by either Nurse mains or ppl feeling generally confident with her. 
---
If 1 match in 100 is played by a newbie, there will be a small difference in results (1%) but definitely not that high to make her fall 7-10% down.
---
Scr√∂dinger's survivor. Somehow, the survivors are all gods and OP and killers stand no chance, but when any statistics come out, most survivors are apparently not good at all but still OP?
---
Literally the same spawning pattern for gates. not sure what he's on about
---
There's tons of cool stuff on Etsy
---
My idea is that she may seem like a saint, but isn't one. The sign that inspired her was an opulent statue, covered in jewelry and wealth... For a priestess, that's a bit hypocritical: Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual. Adiris coveted status, and when she finally had an opportunity to establish herself she took it. It's possible she did what she did not out of altruism or compassion, but merely because she wanted to be *seen* as altruistic and compassionate: The perfect priestess, idolized by everyone, worshiped in her own way. Perhaps she was motivated by more corruptible values like pride, vanity, and jealousy. 
---
Those could be easily twisted: When she was seemingly abandoned, maybe the Entity came to her. As desperate as she was to believe she was special, she may have readily accepted any pact, devoting herself to the Entity so long as it meant she would live, while validating the notions she had about herself. 
---
Of course, that's just me speculating and attempting to connect the dots. I agree that she, more so than perhaps any other killer, doesn't have an obvious reason to be a Killer in the trials. From the looks of it, she doesn't appear directly tortured (Like the Trapper), so we can rule that out. Perhaps some kind of bargain was struck, similar to Rin's promise of vengeance, and she was promised the sickness will eventually be cured through devotion to the entity? We don't know. Let's hope BHVR actually has something planned and didn't just introduce her because she looks cool and is a unique character lol.
---
If bhvr fixed it, this would be a survivor buff. We can't have those, killers are doing so badly!
---
Weakest, more like as in underplayed and thrown away by the bad Nurse "mains" who don't like playing with limits.
---
üßê

The tables have turned

With almost no complaints at all, which means he's a balanced and fun top tier killer just like Billy, BHVR should get more praise for this

You can stop saying "Your opponent is not responsible for your fun" 5x... I mean, with that logic, you're probably okay with Survivors suiciding on hook/DCing and ending your killer game in 5 minutes after an equally long queue. Or just maybe, play the game in a healthier way and adopt a less selfish "I don't care about your experience at all" attitude? It just seems logical to me that creating such a negative experience for Survivors (AFK on hook, then carpal tunnel button mashing) isn't fun, which will lead to players leaving, which will lead to longer boring games and hurt everyone in the end. 
---
 "The downvotes show the community believes something to be true.  They aren't related to what's actually true or not. " oh boy that is so arrogant.

Chromatic aberration on text, bruh.

being someone who has prestiged multiple characters on pc throughout the years and my first one on console recently i can tell you that this is a lie. you normally dont get purple items early in the bloodweb when none prestiged but the more you prestige the better chance you have at getting higher rarity items on the bloodweb at earlier tiers
---
Yeah, a lot of it isn't great. I really like the Welsh girl though. A cat-girl stereotype that I presume in Japanese is the standard cute cat-girl voice actually being a gruff Welsh voice is much more refreshing.
---
The best way to learn how to play as a survivor, is to play killer. Even a little bit. Fully serious. Playing as the killer will help you understand their exact feel and range of motion, how scratch marks look, and how quickly they get bloodlust and lunge. You can also learn from any survivors that you are chasing. What tricks are they doing that catch you off guard? If you have a full understanding of how the killer works, they are far easier to loop, and it's easier to know your limits.
---
Lmao dude who u think you're talking to? 1st of all, a blendette is not a bloody claud, it's a claud with the brown shirt/pants combo by definition. 2nd, the only thing u get with p3 is the bloody head, which is totally irrelevant to your whole 'dark outfit' argument, it doesn't mean shit if we're talking about mimetization. The 'joke' doesn't make any sense at all.
---
But when you run No Mither you dont bleed
---
The only changes I'd like to see with him are some add-on adjustments. It's like how no one complains about just spirit, it's her add-ons that can make her a pain in the ass. Every freddy runs the exact same add-ons which is pretty much where I see all the complaints about him. Otherwise BHVR did a really good job so far on Freddy Freaker.
---
&gt;Survivors arent supposed to be on equal footing with killers
---
yup, otherwise it would be too easy to win as a survivor.
---
Clearly needs a nerf
---
My Boy Legion outperforming Nurse, Huntress
---
Yes, exactly. If the killer is proxy camping SWF can just say "let me save, I have borrowed" but it's not possible for solo survivors.  You either risk waiting for someone that does have borrowed to run over or unhook and hope the survivor has DS or something
---
One can learn, but one cannot harness
---
As a killer main, I think they should.
---
I'm going to say that's spoilers and not cool for those waiting to watch it.
---
So, not cool.
---
In general ranks, in red ranks Clownerino is the weakest.
---
This kid omfg.
---
My stridor Spirit would like to talk with you :)
---
As it stands, if Killers don't slug then survivors can easily escape even with no generators done. That's not reasonable. If they've completely failed their primary objectives they shouldn't get an easy out IMO.
---
It still is, it's a bit luck based and a great bit skill based.
---
I love how ghost face goes into night shroud at the end. That was a nice little touch. :)
---
Seems lefty inspired.
---
I certainly wasnt ignoring him at the time since I was talking to him LMAO
---
Actually hiding in a locker is pretty weak. Using it against bbq is the best/most common legitimate play, and there‚Äôs some memey stuff you can do mid-chase/with the right addons. 
---
Usually it‚Äôs not that hard to guess which locker somebody‚Äôs in. If you run to a jungle gym and hop in a locker, they‚Äôre going to know; they can see your scratch marks and most killers will assume you‚Äôre hiding in the area, and then guessing the right locker is going to be a 50/50 chance most of the time. If you‚Äôre injured, bloodstains give you away like a lighthouse beacon. If you stay too long, a crow comes and sits on top. 
---
If you really need to hide in a locker and the killer‚Äôs on your tail, try to run past the area with lockers (or towards a window) then double back to the locker itself. Running nancy‚Äôs scratchmark perk can help you get a handle on a convincing fake.
---
He used Deadhard. Dont know if your being sarcastic or not but that's why he didnt get hit.
---
Was it just a deadhard.
---
I mean if the hatch spawns you can also search for it yourself, but especially with perks like Left Behind I do agree that the less gens you do does sometimes equal an easier escape.
---
As much as people meme about Tru3Ta1ent his "IDEA TO REPLACE THE HATCH (100% legit) (not clickbait)" video was pretty good.
---
Bit stupid tbh, but it'll also stop DC's
---
Another thing that is completely missing from these is matchmaking. 
---
Let's say I am a rank 10 killer. My first game I go against a red rank SWF with one green player. I get my ass handed to me and maybe get 1 kill. The next game, I get matched against much lower group with yellow ranks and easily steamroll them all, but thanks to killing them too quickly I don't even get good BPs because the rank 15 Dwight decided to kill himself on the first hook and massively fucked his entire team by lowering their chances to escape by a huge amount, and they get 4K'd easily. 
---
According to these stats, balance is fine and I am above the 50% curve, so everything is cool! In reality, both matches were not fun and stats don't reflect it at all. 
---
We need much, much more than kill/pick rates to actually make a fair assesment about how the game is balanced, you cannot really make any real conclusions from these.
---
Honestly think it‚Äôs fine, just like when they‚Äôre on opposite sides of the map and impossible for killer to defend. RNG plays a part in DBD and it has a tendency to fuck up both sides of the equation.
---
Archive points. It's a best build to farm archive points.
---
When you get a Billy or Huntress with shit gate spawns like this you should really just give up. The other day a friend was the last Survivor alive against a Plague and she just alternated between gates puking on them. He eventually just found the closed hatch (no he didn't have a key) and crouched on top of it and span around.
---
There is a Black Friday sale incoming, everything released before Stranger Things should be 50% off
---
Meme or not this is so fucking on point it hurts.
---
I mean the entire point of Whispers is that it becomes really good the less Survivors there are.
---
This shouldn‚Äôt be a thing and totems spawning next to survivors or out in the open shouldn‚Äôt be a thing. 
---
BHVR pls fix rng
---
I‚Äôm probably going to be down voted for this, but these are times when literally the only way out is a key, and this happens very often. I seriously believe that the killer shouldn‚Äôt be able to immediately close hatch, or if the hatch closes then 1 of the exit gates are at half progress.  Give the last survivor something to work with because end game collapse as it is now is literally a 99% win situation for killer and the exit gate spawns don‚Äôt make it any easier. It also makes these scenarios kind of boring because you know what‚Äôs going to happen already.
---
Nah, they were just memeing and being funny. Entity is super tryhard and plays like a saltlord.
---
Do you play killer?
---
I love lefty he‚Äôs a good player and I think his aesthetic is unique and fun.
---
Wtf is up with this guy
---
Welcome...to the true man's world....
---
Dunno about you but "standing in one spot holding down M2" is not my definition of fun.
---
WARNING HAG SPEECH: ONLY PROCEED IF YOU CARE TO PLAY HAG! (i think she's pretty fun)
---
If you have hag, you're set. She makes ruin teachable on all killers once she hits level 35 or 40. I'm best with Hag, like good enough that i play her to win, not nurse or spirit. You also have doctor, who eventually gives Monitor and Abuse. Use monitor and abuse and ruin on hag, if you enjoy playing her, and then if you have it, sloppy butcher and Nurse's calling. Hag, by default has a 24 meter terror radius, with Monitor, it drops to 16. Nurse's works in a range of 28, and sloppy slows healing. You can very easily sneak up on gens and healing with hag. The trick to playing hag is to place traps everywhere. Place them at generators, in spots that you know the survivors will run through, like important doors or paths, and never place them in a pallet, place them on one side of it. If you are chasing someone, see where the trap is, and if it's on the same side as the survivor, spam teleport so you go instantly and it blocks them from going. If it's on the opposite side, wait and see, they might run back into you thinking you will teleport. Never chase people if there are no traps around, because hag is slower than most killers. And don't be afraid to leave someone and hop around. Especially if you get sloppy or nurses, because it will slow the game down more, and if they stay injured, chases will be easier.
---
I mean, I'm glad you find him entertaining and whatnot, but he's not very good, played against him before a few times, he's not... good. But to each their own!
---
Overcharge is obnoxious when combined with Unnerving on Doctor.
---
But yes besides RNG placement from doc and unnerving making the success zone smaller, it's not that hard to hit if the survivor is expecting it.
---
This makes me want a gender bent Michael as a cosmetic haha
---
Well I think you‚Äôre wrong &lt;o/
---
Give a move/action speed bonus to solo queue players that you don't get when in SWF. Not a massive one mind you, maybe 1% for each solo player in the lobby.
---
That was fine when you could unhook, and the unhooker could hold m1 to disarm the trap under your feet.
---
It was even OKAY when you could unhook first, then get trapped afterwards and get untrapped by the person you just saved. 
---
It was when they nerfed BOTH of those that made it a nightmare.
---
You shouldnt be able to get out on your own at any point. Buff trapper
---
No, your meant to kill so its just being nice
---
I agree. Killers don‚Äôt have an out like a hatch of everything goes wrong for them.
---
A Doctor with max range beam addons might be able to just stand at one Exit lever and then zap the other one from there.
---
Plague is best designed Killer because her power disables half the perks in the game with zero counterplay. :)
---
Ah, ok, thanks. On a different note, how did you get it to say "kate Denson / Legion" after tour username?
---
Alright
---
‚ÄúCamped‚Äù you
---
User flair. On your post tap your name. Or go to the sub and top right is 3 dots
---
Just to be sure, you‚Äôve gone to the actual rift page and opened it up, right? For some reason the game doesn‚Äôt give you rewards for reaching another tier unless you actually go to look at the battlepass. If that doesn‚Äôt work try pulling up the store page.
---
That means I'll get a gen done.
---
Hag, while having one of highest kill rates, also has one of the lowers pick rates. She's literally the last one picked in a red rank. No one plays her, so usually it's just a surprise factor that affects her kill rate (no one knows, how to properly play against her, and people that play her know her very well).
---
It helps that he has the Batman Utility Belt of killer abilities.
---
Why 4v1 game should be balanced around 2k? Taking in account everything I said above balancing around 2k will make power role which should be Killer too weak. When you balance game you always need to consider optimal play from both sides.
---
Now, if survivor does no mistakes - chase will continue for 5 gens easily. That is not balance. Chases should be faster or game should be longer by adding another mandatory objective for survivors.
---
I see how survivor mains downvoting my post, cause they like to feel themselves power role in game where they shouldnt.
---
Now Killer side of game way more stressful and require a lot of attention, while as survivor you can literally pick your nose for 70% of trial.
---
You can see it in every streamer game, when they play Killer they dont even interact with chat, cause they cant afford to waste even a couple of seconds of time.
---
So far devs are trying to balance game not by fixing issue, but by applying band-aids which are hardly work.
---
Games are too short? Slap new emblem system which punishes you for playing good on both sides, so you forced to play bad.
---
Infinite windows? Slap perk instead of fixing maps.
---
And so on.
---
How can you unironically Main Legion. No Offense but I‚Äôm genuinely interested because bin my Opinion they have one of the Most boring Playstyles in the Game.

Thanks dude
---
Don't mind that she used to be the hardest killer in the game even at the start. Where do you come from with that kind of conclusions?
---
Ok I‚Äôve thought, still no answer. Mind elaborating?
---
Also known as ‚ÄúWhy overall win rates are not always helpful stats, especially when evaluating high-skillcap characters‚Äù

---
It's poster on /leakbydaylight
---
which were made easy by body collision
---
Honestly if the killer doesn't let me finish all the generators and escape without being hit and atleast stunning him 4 times he is toxic.
---
/s
---
I think they could also buff certain solo queue centric perks. 
---
Self-Care for example, basically sandbags your team if you use it right now but there isn't a reliable way to self heal without a medkit or an expensive DLC perk that few players have (Inner Strength). Maybe switch it back to 75% of grey medkit healing speed but only if you are queuing solo.
---
Kindred buff was a good idea but it should really be a baseline effect for anyone queueing solo.
---
Timetraveler from the future still rank 20 unfortunate
---
Really? I heard the game is being balanced around SWF
---
Missing a dash doesn't break bloodlust
---
yeah submit a ticket to bhvr I guess idk
---
They are working on matchmaking tho
---
this mf sees people being good with nurse and automatically assume it is easy like what
---
It was sarcasm.
---
Yes
---
I think that would be fair. It would even be lore-fitting - when the survivors are getting close to a win, the Entity throws a curveball at them to try to extinguish their hope.

Are people actually taking those "statistics" at any value at all, there are so many random factors that come in every single game that those stats are more or less worthless...
---
&gt; to do 3 gens
---
The fuck? Thats pre hatch change friend its now 5-survivors dead to spawn the hatch, barring final survivor.
---
Imagine havin blood warden on top of this.
---
Yes. There are far more variables here than the stats we currently see, for sure. It would be nice to see those placed in here. I'd love some escape rates vs Ruin and no Ruin, or % of 50% kills based on NOED
---
Archives / Otz hype
---
that's a pretty thicc frog
---
Against really good SWF groups there are only 2-3 killers viable at red ranks. That doesn't mean that, on average, a good killer can still do really well with any killer.
---
At least his power doesnt specify the survivor has to bleed, it just says "he absorbs blood energy(the blood orbs not the bleeding), from injured survivors.
---
If it was this way, if all the survivors used no mither, The Oni would only get his power at half of the game by his passive recharge.
---
that's the hatch, it doesn't have anything to do with gates
---
Ruin is borderline mandatory though, with how fast gens go
---
yeah man, the ticking noise when you get a new blink was such a hard hitting nerf. She just sucks to play now.
---
They addressed this at some point during one of the dev streams a couple weeks ago when they were asked, apparently some of the lower tier killers are down at sub 25% killrate vs 4man swf at red ranks even
---
I was joking dude. The reason I called her braindead is because she was ridiculously overpowered. I wasn‚Äôt being serious, I fully understand that Nurse was and is hard to play.
---
Wrong flair dude
---
I agree completely
---
it‚Äôs called a funi jokke
---
Not really fun to play and to play against. 
---
When you play against goods survivors they'll never use the fountains until the last gen pop, hence reinforcing the no heal, do gen meta. 
---
I also think the overall design of the character isn't appealing, would have preferred an ugly fat beast instead of a corrupted lady. Looks better in my mind for something having vomiting issues lol.

Honestly, Freddy is just overstacked. He's straight up OP, it just doesn't FEEL like it (either to play OR play against) because he's got loads of little elements that don't seem like much on their own, but add up.
---
- Passive phasing when survivors are awake + totally invisible from outside TR range
---
- Is VERY small, + red stain is CONSIDERABLY harder to see when asleep, meaning some loops + mindgames are much easier to play on than with most other killers (bar GF, or Pig in some cases)
---
- No TR related perks when survivors are asleep, biggest issue is it HARD counters BT (either doesn't apply at all, or survivor bleeds out)
---
- Straight up stronger snares than Clown's slow (more consistent, can be preplaced, doesn't slow Freddy)
---
- Across map teleport
---
- Can BAIT teleports to force no-win situations for survivors in some cases (much like Hag traps can force those situations)
---
- Alarm clocks + waking gives inherent slowdown, usually only found with Pig and Doctor 
---
- Has some of the strongest add ons in the game
---
Literally none of those on their own are issues at all (except snares being straight up stronger than Clown's power, like, what gives?), but together gives you a killer who's not got any weaknesses.
---
At that point you already lost 2, do you really think you deserve a third chance?
---
I love how she still tried to bm after getting screwed but you know the killer was laughing
---
Just to play devil's advocate here... I could play killer every game at red ranks and use NOED, and guarantee 2 kills, every single game.
---
First of all, I'm not making an argument. I'm pointing out where your argument fails. Second of all, rank is supposed to be a sorting algorithm, but you are arguing that it is not, making the data meaningless. My reponse is to point out that we have data from all ranks, which makes your argument invalid becuase it no longer sorts based on the flawed algorithm. Third of all, there were nothing but complaints about nurse at low ranks. 
---
If you don't understand that complaints about the flawed ranking system don't apply when you have the aggregate data set, then there's nothing more to say.
---
It's hilarious when killers just insta-break dropped pallets. Equally hilarious as killer when you don't break a dropped pallet and the survivor you caught and sacrificed calls you a sweaty tryhard for not doing them the luxury of breaking the pallet.
---
My main complaint with hatch is that survivors can repair one gen, I kill 3, and last one has a chance at escaping even though they didn't do jack shit. I earned that 4k so let me have it. They should bring back the 3 gen hatch rule.
---
That was Nurse.
---
Doc killed his handler and dipped. Phil killed a ton of people in cars and then killed his boss. Nurse went crazy.
---
Makes sense for 3 of those. Nurse and Huntress are WAY harder to play (say what you will about Legion but they're super easy to play), and Clown has been one of the worst killers for a long time. I'm honestly shocked (lol) that Doctor is as high up as he is.
---
I don't know how Demo has such a low winrate, though. I assume it's also to do with difficulty to learn, combined with him being the newest killer, but I don't think his Shred is a bad ability at all.
---
Before end game colllapse the game would go on forever and hatch could not be close. So killer had 3 possible escape to defend.
---
Considering that over 50% of survivors find a way to die on Haddonfield during a Balanced Landing  meta, yeah that doesn't say much for the average skill level.
---
Literally if I‚Äôm not with my brother playing this game I‚Äôd just be that guy farming bloodpoints.. sorry not sorry, but everyone thinks about themselves in solo.. just think about it.. every survivor in solo at least carrying 2 team perks can probably make a huge difference.. but instead we have 4 survivors running 3 exhaust perks and a tier 1 DS.. (No tilt btw just sayin)
---
Well, you gotta excuse me, the statistics presented are pretty poorly readable - we can't see how many players are dogshit, we don't see how top players affect this.
---
Inconsistent, too. Either the kill/pick charts are cross-platform, or there is an inconsistency in the charts - pick chart clearly shows nurse around 47.5% kill rate. I'd love to have a more comprehensive over-time trend chart to clearly see the effects of nerfs and buffs, but all we get is semi-obfuscated information and have to fill in blanks with our own experience. No wonder all opinions get biased as a result.
---
Dude, add an /s quickly before some moron  takes it seriously and asks for evidence
---
Original is ok, H2O is meh
---
Franklins baby, that happened to me once and now i always bring Franklins. Now they either give me a good chase before they die or they dc.
---
I was followed slugging to death because someone else sent killer to the haddonfield. For some reason I couldn't get mad at a killer.
---
I'd argue ruin is absolutely not the optimal perk to make the game take longer. So much so that I don't even run it on huntress anymore, one of the killers that it benefits most. I'd say a good 70% of games it's found within a minute, and you're basically playing with 3 perks because of it. Also, good survivors are going to hit the skill checks more often than not. I wouldn't even consider myself that good of survivor (I go back and forth between 3-4, sometimes hitting 2) and even I hit almost every ruin skillcheck.
---
Corrupt intervention is a lot more consistent. You have a guaranteed two minutes where all survivors are forced to work on four gens, making your map pressure exponentially better early game. The other option is a couple of survivors wait out corrupt intervention, and in that case they aren't working on gens while you pressure the ones that are.
---
I'm not trying to say that gen speed early game isn't a problem, because it absolutely is if you have a team of 3 or 4 survivors that can communicate with each other for killer position, who's going to save, who should distract a killer to pull them away from a gen, etc. That level of coordination is a fraction of games though, and the problem most people run into is not ending the first chase quickly enough. Or they get so focused on one thing early game (protecting ruin totem, trying to keep a gen that's at 70% from popping instead of giving it up, not giving up a chase when they get to the main building) that by the time they get their first down one gen is done and two are at 80%.
---
I really think there are a couple things to blame. First is the shitty ranking system. It's way too easy for someone with like 100 hours to make it to red ranks where they are absolutely not prepared for not only optimal rank 1 survivor SWF groups, but 4 good survivors in general. They can't really mind game, they don't have the tile or map knowledge to know when to chase, and they get tilted too easily and lose sight of everything but downing the one survivor who can tell these things and click a flashlight at them to keep them chasing. They get up to these high ranks because ruin has carried them through enough games and they've gone up against enough mediocre survivor teams that when they do get a group of good survivors they don't have the skill to respond.
---
It's become clear from the stats that were released yesterday that killer has been in its strongest state in a long time in DbD, with the lowest kill rate in red ranks being 60%. If you're consistently getting 0 kills in game, or scraping by with 2 kills running NOED, you probably need to watch some videos from the best killers that play the killer you main. That or just the basic videos on how to run tiles and what tiles you should try to get a pallet out of and give up on. I know I was pissed starting out playing huntress because I felt like no matter what I did I had 2 gens pop by my first hook. Then I started watching Umbra, Ralph, and Scott Jund play huntress and it blew my mind the things they would do. Umbra especially who doesn't run ruin or any addons. It then gave me things to practice on and improved my play a fuck ton. If anyone wants to know any streamers that are really good at a specific killer let me know, because I watch a lot of streams while working from home.
---
I know this was way too long of a rant for the comment you left, but I just had my energy drink and I'm hyped for my day off, so sorry about that. To end though I do agree that they should do something about early game gen speed for SWF groups that doesn't punish solo survivors. I think that a scaling gen completion time increase based on the amount of people in a party would be fair. Two in a group and two solo? 5% increase in time. 3 people and one random, or two groups of 2? 12% increase. 4 man swf? 20%. Maybe halve the penalty for each death until there are two left and it gets set to 0% penalty. I think that is basically the only option that would reasonably work that won't ruin the game for people who just play by themselves.
---
His kit is so fucking overloaded it‚Äôs incredible. Seriously. Look at what wraith or Leatherface or trapper can do and then compare them to Freddy.
---
She‚Äôs picked more than any other killer, yeah. But not more than all other killers. Considering the odds of you not encountering a Spirit are eight times higher than the odds of getting one, it‚Äôs my own opinion this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthat often‚Äù or ‚Äúa lot‚Äù. 
---
Think of it like this. The odds of unhooking yourself on any one attempt are 4%. Three attempts is 1 minus 0.96 cubed which is almost equal to the chances of you having to play against spirit. We don‚Äôt describe self unhooks without bonus luck, even with three attempts, as happening ‚Äúa lot‚Äù or ‚Äúthat often‚Äù, so why Spirit?
---
lol sure you are rank 1, fuck this subreddit
---
But then where would we put them? On different walls?! That‚Äôs simply preposterous
---
How is freddy braindead? His entire toolkit is about mind gaming and catching survivors off guard. Knowing which way they will be running and which way they will be looking.
---
Give every survivor stamina so they slow down the more they run. After 20 seconds of running if they couldnt "skillfully" evade and hide from the killer, their running speed is reduced to walking speed for 30s until their stamina builds up.
---
Yeah nurses on console are trash
---
Trap gets destroyed, but the Hag is notified about that. So it's the same consequence as disarming a trap against the Trapper: no trap, but your location is revealed.
---
Oh fuck pallets are a thing. Yeah fair play actually
---
What will stop the DC's is ACTUAL PUNISHMENT for doing so.    Give the assholes an hour ban for their first DC, and if they do it again in 24 hours, give them a week.
---
Structural Perfection seems to end all chases pretty quickly. This might even replace Save The Best For Last, since it probably nullifies the small sprint survivors get. _Combined_ with STBFL, chases probably don't happen.
---
No absolute way you'd let the killer be able to hear the proxy chat. Like you said survivors would just use it to be even more toxic. Survivor only proxy chat with an option to mute people would definitely be the way to go.
---
She is top tier killer on certain maps (small maps but open ones ) but huge maps totally gut her and she‚Äôll get gen rushed , I‚Äôve seen and it painful to play . Making her 115 would be a buff to her , I would be okay if they compensated it with more cool down after a hachet throw or something else  .
---
Must have been me if this was ps4. The mangled or hemorraged ability is an addon. Trapper mains usually have like 30+ of these in our addons inventory.
---
Actually I read the *percentages* right, but I read the *title* wrong, haha.
---
Git gud or git ded, scrub
---
Haddonfield is my favorite map too
---
Do you know how to run cow tree? I know it's a strong spot for survivors, but I just cant seem to make it work. I need an ELI5 YouTube channel on running as survivor it seems.
---
It'll be interesting to see what happens when the Balanced Landing changes hit live.
---
This is why I like Hawkins so much. They always spawn at opposite ends of the map. I am a killer main, but I like actually having a challenge in the end game - if it comes to that point of the game.
---
Well if you want me to be precise, I'm a rank 4 survivor and a rank 2 killer currently standing. No need to be so hostile, dude.
---
ok boomer
---
*most annoying
---
You aren‚Äôt meant to give them anything, punish them
---
The Plague is the least popular because a 4K is about the easiest to achieve, and you get the least amount of BP for it since everyone's taking 1/2 or even 1/3 as many hits as they normally would.
---
Do you not think those two could possibly be linked? Or do you think the lack of reliable counterplay could in no way lead to an abnormally high kill rate?
---
r/thanksihateit
---
Exit gates on the opposite sides of Mother's = the killer can't even make it from one exit to the other before it's opened.  Essentially you never want to lose as survivor once the gates are powered.  
---
When I'm the last survivor and the gates are right next to each other, I go hunting for chests and hope one has a key.  You almost always have free range while the killer stares at the two exits.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
---
Ok a lil bit much on that week of not being able to play, what if someone does it once then has to leave, and they are working on timeout punishments
---
Would you look at that, Nurse is now statistically the WEAKEST killer. Good job BHVR, can't wait to see what you do to Spirit and every other viable killer.
---
Probably because everyone dcs to the fucking annoying killer that legion is.
---
That is ok, but she is popping out of the trap is what im saying, something i ve never seen happen.
---
People need to start playing killer, placing a trap that wastes time for killer, isn‚Äôt a guaranteed down, pretty hard getting a survivor in it, all for them to escape within 5-10 seconds and it not doing anything. Shouldn‚Äôt be able to escape by yourself that quick simple, should take at least 15-20 seconds or not at all
---
Yeah Omega Blink and 5 blink Nurse needed nerfs, but an extra fatigue mechanic was not needed.
---
Hatch should t spawn at 5 gens. It's a weird world we live in.
---
The way that the game can be survivor sided (which it is) and killers still average 2-3 kills a game is if most survivors aren't good at the game. If you solo queue you might be able to share your thoughts on this conjecture.
---
Its pretty BS if you're a solo survivor and your team just sucks though. If the killer gets hatch and the doors dont spawn on opposite sides of the map you're fucked 99% of the time. Especially against trapper, demogorgon, and every mobility killer.
---

Good thing I always used Lithe
---
Lithe, dance with me, windows of opportunities, and resilience is the best for vaulting plays
---
I dont get it
---
They literally just buffed kindred to make it one of the best solo survivor perks. Pretty ironic you complain about balance but don‚Äôt keep up with it.
---
Was the killer the Wraith?
---
MegHead
---
tried to use an offering to play as the pig and then as the nightmare.
---
In game 2, the entity ate my offering and gave me nothing.
---
Facehuggers seem op. Survivors get a bunch of negative status effects and then die with no way to counter it.
---
Blendette has been a term since launch, long before the brown shirt was even released. Chill the fuck out, if you don‚Äôt like the post then keep scrolling lol
---
You're just bad at killer if you think survivors need to be nerfed like that.
---
I saw someone mention that the match itself is discounted if someone dcs
---
I guess because Whispers is good and Distressing for points
---
True, I never use them in like I said was just doing it for the challenge in the archives.
---
EGC is loud, and this map is loud, hard to hear survivors just by their breath. Switch didn't have his progress lights on, so he assumed there's no one here.
---
Would a survivor give you a hook at 5 gens?
---
I just found it funny that I managed to smack the Demogorgon so many times before getting downed but it's okay if anyone else doesn't find it funny lmao
---
Exhaustion perks ruin the game. Please remove them all. (Not even joking have seen streamers say this).
---
Killers: Time to nerf Survivors more. That number should be 70%
---
I mean yeah
---
Idk if im more disappointed that you clearly don't play Trapper or that you are actually using Slippery meat.
---
I agree. I play both killer and survivor around same amount of time, but holy crap the long waits, from 5 to 15min to get a game going, to then a 50/50 chance of someone disconnecting cause you downed them once, which has a 50/50 chance of causing a domino effect of disconnects...the few times I actually get a good group of survivors  that wont bitch out and have at least decent skill then I don't want last survivor to get an easy out if I got to hatch first. After an hour of waiting for a good round,  I want my kills.
---
Those pallets make me RAGE, which means they are good! I‚Äôm only purple rank survivor though, this is my first season
---
You have to try and guess if Fred is respecting a pallet mid chase to know if it‚Äôs real or not. And the good Freddys know you‚Äôre watching them so they‚Äôll fake you out. So scary!
---
Adds some spice, doesn‚Äôt it?
---
But no one can save him if Bubba uses his chain saw

tRy aGAin lOL
---
Nuh uh. Clearly I failed statistics and am a shame to my family
---
And it's a start, sure, but just one good solo perk isn't going to bring solo players up to par with SWF
---
I think I love you
---
Thank you SO MUCH!
---
What I got from the graphics:
---
Here you can see how we fucked up the nurse and nobody plays her anymore.
---
[laughs in Nurse with rope and Fragile Wheeze]
---
Every good nurse player is completely unaffected by the "nerf". The rework just made bad nurses worse. If you actually understand how to play her she pretty much plays exactly the same, and is just as good.
---
glad they are still posting artwork with the new survivors and killers lore. hyped to see oni's as well!
---
Sabotaging takes time though and that time is usually better spent on gens... Also if chase starts at a gen then it will probably end far from it, unless the survivor is already injured.
---
True that.
---
Swap windows or resilience for Quick and Quiet
---
Oh i see. But smack a nurse or spirit will be super funny
---
I love it!
---
How about make it harder to rank up when in a SWF vs solo queue?
---
How the fuck did the entity just snatch her in the middle of a street race? Wouldn't people see that?
---
Always a Jane ime.
---
Just give us voice chat like every modern game has, of course with the option to mute people, and balance the game around that.  
---
I get it, voice chat reduces the "horror flavor" of the game but id rather the game be more balanced than immersive.
---
At least it's much better now, going up against SWFs of rank 2s and rank 15-20s game after game after game made me want to quit playing killer, because they were all clearly red ranks, just abusing matchmaking.
---
Still, I think SWFs have major advantages over solo. If we assume they have perfect communication, they essentially have shared vision. Put one of them monitoring the killer from afar and the first two gens can be done without killer interference.
---
So unless BHVR were willing to nerf SWFs, I don't think buffing solo survivors is going to make the game any better.
---
Except things like seeing loadouts in the lobby, makes no sense not to let survivors see eachothers' loadouts.
---
This is what I love about this game lol
---
It's because 99% of killer mains that complain still haven't gotten over the strength survivors had at launch.
---
I think the same
---
It really depends on the genre. Slasher movies, specially the kind of slasher movies like Halloween that don‚Äôt use a lot of special effects, can be made relatively quickly and will turn out to be good if the script, the actors and the editors are up to the task.
---
Probably windows because resilience increases vaulting speed while injured
---
I agree. I used to love Micheal but on some indoor maps he literally doesn't have a terror radius if he looks down while walking.
---
This saying applies to haunted ground only.

---
Kinda true now
---
What about Halloween 3?
---
You're thinking old Freddy.
---
New Freddy just kinda spams traps, becoming impossible to loop on most tiles.
---
He's strong, but he does feel basic/generic.
---
I don't know, I don't play survivor often
---
Their own published stats say otherwise.
---
its worse than monstrous shrine
---
It would benefit this community to play both sides.
---
Where is this from? Looks the same as the cutscenes from the archives
---
Yeah, it's called "No One Escapes Death" not "Most People Escape Death"
---
It's basically Killer Hatch.
---
You don‚Äôt need a perk, although Hangman‚Äôs trick makes it to where if a hook is sabotaged, it only stays broken for 10 seconds instead of 2 minutes. I never see killers run them because there are literally hooks around every corner.
---
No, I just meant there being one totem you just can't find,  and them just happening to have NOED in that situation.
---
If someone is facing camping, if the other survivors did gens, they would be able to escape. You are the only one be affected by the face camp. The reason why it always works is because people get too altruistic.
---
Oh yea for sure. It would be cool if proxy chat had farther survivors sound ‚Äúfarther away‚Äù and as the got closer louder and more audible. Kinda what like dayz has. It was always funny to hear a really low and muffled ‚Äúhello friend‚Äù get closer and get clearer.
---
Found the survivor main
---
&lt;3
---
Its ultimately up to you how to play the game. Usually I'll go for the hook but if I'm feeling nice every once in a while I'll let the last one go, usually if they're down right in front of hatch or something like that.
---
In the words of Rosa Diaz ‚ÄúFear is a power aphrodisiac‚Äù
---
I mean. No? All it takes is the survivors having even the slightest bit of cooperation.
---
That is some stupid ass logic
---
This is why I quit the game a while back. Solo survivor is fucking miserable to play as, and every nerf survivors get only really affects solo players. Swf has always been infinitely stronger than solo players. When you add spirit and other incredibly unfun stuff into the game it just ruins it.
---
There was a special fog, she drives through it, nobody sees her, she disappeared, everybody is wondering where she is... My imagination lol
---
Well Trapper is the best killer to defend any exit gate imo
---
Not related, just wish I can finally reach the lightbulb moment of how people do flashlights. Thanks for suggestions
---
Bubba sends me into a blind rage tbh fuck that guy and his chainsaw
---
https://deadbydaylight.com/en/news/yui-kimura-lore
---
Why does the survivor deserve to get out at this point? They already had the chance to get hatch and lost it, and had the chance to possibly open the door before the Huntress got there, and lost that. Being the last one alive doesn't somehow entitle you to an escape, especially if you've already missed your two other options.
---
They are buffing killers because organised SWF teams have the advantage. Hence spitting in the face of solo survivors.
---
You have to give power and fun to someone in a 1v4 scenario, and to keep this role appealing. If there's no more killer, the game is dead. 
---
But when the game was released, swf was not possible. They made it available because otherwise the game would be dead too, but since then, they never balanced around this crucial difference between teams and solo guys. The most fun in survivor side relies upon informations and other things you don't have in solo.
---
As long as they don't understand that they need to implement buff or nerf between solo and SWF, we'll never get something good. But Peanuts once replied directly to me, saying that when he plays a game with a friend, it doesnt give him any advantages because he's just playing for fun... I don't know what to say really.
---
Yeah same here.
---
Pretty easy to guess that one
---
Am I missing the part where you get rid of this facehugger infection or whatever?
---
Distressing doesn't add real bloodpoints. Youre still capped at 8k deviousness and if you actually use your power you will get it.
---
This subreddit really loves sucking the devs dick as hard as possible. Especially when they fuck up and fail to deliver, which they constantly do.
---
how is that fair for killer again?
---
‚ÄúJust cleanse totems‚Äù is my go to answer. I haven‚Äôt used NOED in quite a while, but I might start using it again.
---
The only 30 times I've ever played trapper is trying to get the archives challenges done.  28 of those were trying to get the hungry jaws challenge.  I ended up "friending" some survivors and farming my 4 traps and then letting them escape.
---
Or in other words, every Red Forest map formation.
---
Alternatively, doors should spawn. Had a game a month ago against a Bubba where the second door didn't spawn at all and hatch was right in front of the only open door, which he camped. He got a 1k off of me because the game is so broken.
---
I mean when you're the last survivor. If you go against basically any of the good killers that most people play, then you're fucked.
---
Not a fan of him and he deserves to be banned so, I care. :)
---
Repeating your unsupported opinion does not make it more factlike. But since you didn't understand how your point fails, we're done. Go ahead and take last word and be well.
---
üòÇ
---
This is amazing! I need to see more haha
---
This game should not be balanced around 4 man SWFs. Behavior checked their statistics and SWFs don‚Äôt perform marginally better than solo, and solo players make up the biggest player base. 
---
If you‚Äôre losing games and blaming SWFs you probably aren‚Äôt a great killer. Playing against a coordinated teams means you have to keep track of the survivors throughout the game. 
---
If one survivor is in the hook, you should know 2 are probably on gens and 1 coming for the save. If you slug the player going for the save, then both teammates will probably have to leave their gens to help. 
---
Stop complaining about SWFs and learn to apply pressure across the board and you will win more games. If you just sit and complain that SWFs are ruining the game then, you‚Äôre going to be complaining for awhile.
---
Theres a difference between expecting someone to be nice and expecting someone to follow your made up rules.
---
Only for solo queue. SWFs don't get access to the bonus.
---
Killers are already running anti-healing builds and right now Inner Strength gives you a full heal in a fraction of the time of being healed by someone else. It's to the point where it's almost a meme perk right now with no use whatsoever and most survivors will ragequit if they see anyone using it at higher ranks.
---
Look at hag, she isn't hard to play, neither on console or on PC, has disgustingly high kill rate, but the most awful pick rate. Nurse was picked more often in october because her rework was still fresh, and people tried her new add-ons. I expect her to drop in popularity. There is no more any lure for people to pick her up. Before it was "she is very hard to play, but she also a red rank stomper". Now "she's very hard to play  (even harder than before) and you can perfrom okay with her if you sink 100h in playing her".
---
While this gate spawn is shit overall the gate spawns feel fine both as killer as well as survivor. It's pretty random if you get out as the last survivor with the gates powered but that's fine. I don't think it really needs changing especially considering games in which gates are powered by 5 gens completed.
---
Imho currently survivors are the power role, at least on red ranks. yeah sure the killer has the weapons but playing killer is a lot more stressful while 3 of 4 survivors have a chill game at a time. And that's the case because survivors hold the cards, they decide how quick the game goes. The killer is always against the clock and survivors losing is more about survivors fucking up than it is about the killer playing well. The game is balanced more towards survivors than killers imho. Playing feels so much easier as survivor that I made the switch a short time ago to playing mainly solo survivor while I had been killer main since I started DbD.
---
Killer on rank 1 just isn't fun anymore. Yeah rank reset makes it fun for a short period because you don't have to tryhard almost every game but once you are back to red ranks it's playing the 3-4 same killers and tryharding just so you don't get completely stomped by survivors.
---
Then it does exactly what it‚Äôs supposed to do, stop survivors from body blocking
---
Well, those perks are perks that doesn‚Äòt really has something to do with a survivor, getting stunned by a pallet isn‚Äòt a negative effect on the survivor, so that would probably still work
---
i mean, i don't get the point of your video. I see no karma involved in this.
---
Sure, but still for some killers it will give you a boost of 2k or such
---
Damn that's dope. Can I hit u up in the dms?
---
That's just unlucky, if the gates spawn on opposite sides of the map or they have a key, the survivor gets a free escape.
---
Interesting topics. There are situations where you cannot defend the exitgates, like in Hawkins, and then there are spawns like this ehere the killer can overlook something very easily and give no one the chance to leave. How should it be?
---
All of that totally makes sense.   
---
In my defense, I play freddy exclusively with pallet addons because I find them a lot more fun than the snares. So i rely heavily on mindgames with getting behind them with gen teleports in chases and such like that. I never try to get in situations where I can be looped.   
---
BT is basically not an issue for me because i don't camp.   
---
I only have one addon to use cause i always run pallets. So never tried the double slowdown ones.   
---
I think the model complaint is BS honestly. All killers are the same (with some notable exceptions). It may  not feel good, but there is no solution there. Freddy is designed the way he has to be (its a liscened character.) and him having a shorter lunge to 'make sense' is a huge nerf and not fair.  
---
So I play freddy in a non braindead way that i find very fun, but i see what you mean for other ways to play him.
---
No. I am just saying have fun with it. Try to loop me. Flashlight me. Save your friends before hook. Etc
---
Any luck last night?
---
You obviously haven't watched Otz's  sweat mode Freddy vs actual swf .  Freddy is incredibly powerful against a full meta perk on comms swf team.  Really, he's incredibly powerful against anyone if you're a good killer.  
---
That said, the dude saying nurse was always the worst killer is insane.  Nurse is one of the hardest killers to play, I'll agree with that, but once you figure out her ranges and timing she's insane.
---
Find a key
---
This is incredible holy shit!!!
---
I felt the same at first to be completely honest, connections just connection nothing to be defensive about üòÅ but I never get disconnected from parties, comms never lag, I never have any issues in the match with rubberbanding or anything and it just randomly dc's
---
Everybody gangsta until SWF exists
---
Rotten Fields.
---
Bro survivors really are the power role man.
---
If they add the Xenomorph and no Ripley... I'm uninstalling
---
Balance change.
---
Survivors can‚Äôt fast vault when lithe is active.
---
Yeah but theyre going to escape having done nothing and wont pip. You'll have 3kills and probably another hook or two on him so you'll pip. You still win who needs the 4k
---
ah ok. it was just incase you were misinformed
---
When feral frenzy is activated, all perks are deactivated. Now it's balanced.
---
"Bring a key" aka "yes I want the killer to tunnel me all match and ignore everyone else."
---
I remember when they reworked freddy. As a freddy main I dug into him asap and stated in this sub ‚Äúhe‚Äôs pretty damn strong‚Äù basically got people scoffing at me for the sake of the meme of ‚Äúhurr hurr bad survivors want nerf‚Äù like no you dumbass he is strong as hell. Still miss my wall hacks though. Probably the best killer for a newbie prior to his rework.
---

---
Yes, but look at how those killers perform compared to freddy. As the game currently stands, those 3 killers underperform because they lack other tools. A better comparasion is someone like nurse who can only blink, but is still the strongest. But how many killers can be made with one singular power that provides mobility and anti looping potiental? Not really easy to do.
---
Nothing wrong with solo, it's the players that suck and are toxic. I quit killer because I was tired of getting tbagged and shit by toxic SWF's just to have the same happen to me in solo queues. Survivors are a survivor's worst enemy and I hate it. Most toxic community ever no matter what anyone says. Pointing in my direction for killer, leading killer to me with bond while I've almost done my gen, unhook spamming and then running off to get hatch,... I've seen it all in the 4 weeks I've started playing survivor almist exclusively. By far the worst experience I've had in this game and it is not due to killers or balance but due to teammates.
---
New kindred will be one of the best solo survivor perks in the game.
---
Red ranks represent the smallest subset of players, how are they at all useful for making conclusions?  Most players are only going to be playing casually with no real concern for rank.
---
Y'all are Good, Don't Come to Work Tommorow
---
The only reason there weren‚Äôt complaints is because everyone was sleeping on Fred boy. Fast forward months later and people just get slapped in the face by the realization. Its kind of funny what a perception of a meme will do.
---
There's two killers who transcend beyond the bounds of the game, and that's Trapper and Huntress. If you get the Huntress for one game, you will hear the humming in your head for 3 more. If I get a Trapper once, I will now automatically assume every killer after that has bear traps in addition to their normal power.
---
So it is my fault because I play solo and thus shouldn\`t complain that my teammates can farm me and the killer can mori me straight away... And how is a red offering by a perk countered when the perk is only active for 60 seconds after beeing unhooked. My suggestion was to disencourage tunneling with this change and you say this is unfair (so you think tunnelling is fair btw). 
---
@FelicitousJuliet What you are saying isn\`t even related to my comment and you are just commplaying about toxic swf groups.  Only 5% of all games are 4 man swf and even less of these groups are super toxic. So you are saying the game should be balanced around those 0,1% super toxic swf groups and not around the 90%+ playing solo?!
---
Bonk
---
I keep hearing about forever Freddy quite a lot but I wasn't able to find much. Is it the annoying combo of Swing Chains/Red Paint Brush with... what perks?
---
That‚Äôs really damn cool, props to the cosplayer
---
You have a point that statistics aren't the only thing the changes are based on. If that were the case then legion would be a better killer than huntress. That said, is it really so bad that they take the community's opinion into account for changes? Especially when you have an overwhelming majority of both the survivor and killer player base saying the same thing? 
---
Do you remember how broken Mettle of Man was? Would you have preferred it if they just said: "We know most of the community say this is way too strong and making people quit playing. Instead of fixing it, however, we are going to focus on bringing other perks up to the level that they'd rather run them instead."? Probably not. 
---
Community feedback is an important part of game development, and if an overwhelming majority of the community say that something needs to be looked at, it would probably be smart of them to look at. Especially when the killer players that they bring on as fog whisperers also say the same things. It would be like if the survivor mains that they bring on that have 10k hours in the game say "This perk is absolutely unfair to killers. It needs to be changed ASAP."
---
If 70% of people are happy because of a change, 25% don't care, and 5% get angry because of it, they're probably going to make the change.
---
That would still be bond.
---
#please 
---
Just imagine mori survivor with tongue through their head ü§§ü§§
---
I'm finding this one really weird.
---
Like dotn get me wrong, Yui is a FANTASTIC character and God damn I want a movie about her life.
---
But it feels so random that she was snatched in the middle of a race. Most back stories seem to lend to the idea of the survivors being lonely, isolated people who were snatched and then forgotten by the world. Most have tragedy one could say the Entity engineered to capture them.
---
But with Yui there's nothing leading up to her taking that can connect her to the Entity. No whispers, depression, isolation, extreme past trauma. She's had a rough run with the stalker situation but she survived and thrived, so I cant see her as being weak enough to be preyed on by The Entity.
---
This backstory just seems.....out of place to the others.
---
To be fair.... based on the stats from May or so, SWF appears in about 50% of games (if you include 3-man and 2-man). It's only the 4-man SWF that's around 4-6 % depending on what platform you're on.   
---
But I agree that the number is too low for people to be constantly using the "4-man swf" argument to justify their claims. Because when people say "swf", they usually mean the 4-man version. The truth is, just because all 4 escaped, doesn't mean it was a 4-man SWF. Sometimes it's just good solo players, or even solo players who constantly BM. It's no reason to constantly punish solo players who still make up a vast majority of the game.
---
Billy?? Hell no.
---
Oh no, you don't understand. The trapper used to be able to literally trap under the feet of the hooked person, and because unhooking always put you directly in front (instead of the swivel they have now), you got trapped when you tried to save them 100% of the time.
---
That meant you had to disarm the trap first, THEN save the survivor (and IIRC, unhooks were slower than they are now), meaning that if a Trapper camped, it was LITERALLY impossible to unhook someone.
---
He had the highest kill rate for a while until they nerfed that (and added in the swivel later to avoid facecamping)
---
True, but having two perks dedicated to one purpose seems wasteful.
---
good iea
---
You might need to add some kind of surgical chamber like the jigsaw boxes where the chestburster can be removed, kind of like in Prometheus.  And structural perfection just sounds like a less effective stridor to me. From my understanding stridor actually makes survivors louder, not hear them more effectively, and the values are much higher with stridor. I'd probably change it so that the Xenomorph has to actually place the ovomorphs near a dying survivor for it to take effect, like the pigs traps. Overall I'd love to see the Alien make it into the game, but there has to be counterplay and good perks to make it worthwhile.
---
Every time I try to learn nurse I get stomped like 95% of the time, and then 5% of the time I'll have a good start and people just DC - a portent of the nurse main experience.
---
If the Killer has already killed 3 people they've already proven they have enough skill to kill that last one. And a 1v1 between the Killer and a Survivor should definitely be in the Killer's favor.
---
Killers have already been buffed with being able to close the hatch and EGC. Now 90% of times the last survivor dies as soon as the hatvh closes, unless they get lucky door spawns and/or have wake up, resilience etc to open gates faster.
---
Maybe you just need to understand once and for all that ranks do not give you any rewards.
---
Hence complaining about a ranking system or pips isn't what should be considered a priority to balance the game.
---
This is not ELO, nor a competitive game in its core.
---
easy to play, guaranteed to not depip, easy bloodpoints. Also while difficult to use effectively due to the overall power being lackluster, it is fun when your Frenzy actually works out well and you keep multiple survivors pressured at once.
---
I have high hopes for crossplay with consoles and cross progression soon. Im hoping next mid chapter patch it'll be a huge crossplay themed update
---
He was definitely shadow boxing the air after this one
---
Okay? If you're the last survivor alive and the hatch is closed you _should_ be dead. It's now a 1v1 with a Killer, who is much more powerful.
---
I think with the right balancing, it'd be a fun killer to play and go against.
---
But brave enough to clenease totems
---
Nope
---
What are you saying its a nice cosplay. I could not be better.
---
I made one correct point about survivorship bias who were you replying to?
---
Red ranks requires a higher kill rate, hence you see a higher kill rate. None of what you said contradicts that, and it was my only point.
---
Not always. It's very possible to get fucked by the door spawns. Last night I had a game as Plague where I closed the hatch and though both doors were somewhat close to each other, one was on the exact opposite side of the level. By the time I was able to walk there, they had already opened it.

What platform are you playing on?

&gt;no-one complains about the spirit, just her add on's
---
i need to go and lie down after reading that
---
As survivor coldwind and autohaven, as killer probably autohaven, idk why I just seem to do better on it as killer
---
More likely than not streamers are using add-ons to increase the amount that they can turn. They also have more practice and have a better feel for movement
---
I mean it‚Äôs just the way red ranks and some purple and others play, get gens done as fast as possible
---
You get a flick of heavy control right before you release at full charge, you can use that to fine tune your angle.
---
Tougher in terms of rank? Like rank 5 swf gets a rank 1 killer?
---
You know on the show the 'Good Place' ?  
---
where Michael asks for something and he always gets a cactus instead?

Janet: Nope!

---
Boom another hitbox complain
---
More customization is great. Even better if there are options to disable it on your end so while you're playing everything is vanilla/original and the other guys can have their cosmetics.
---
To be fair, killers complain about a lot, considering all killers in all ranks have a high success rate, regardless of map.
---
And they died because the killer have noed and blood warden.
---
[Yes rank 3?](https://imgur.com/undefined)
---
Anyway where was I, balanced has been debuffed so I'm using SB, and Dead hard has been unrealiable often giving me exhausted effect but still downing me.
---
Have you seen this comment section? Might wanna rethink that first part
---
Thought it was only me, but apparently everyone does it, and I've even noticed some of the better streamers flinching in that direction.
---
I blame the Wii for teaching us bad habits.
---
I can live with playing Huntress on console, the challenges specific to her will probably just be hitting X hatchets in a match. What I'm not looking forward to is the Nurse's archive.
---
It was still a 7% nerf.
---
Also she is not an Invoker/Lee Sin/Akali level of difficulty.
---
&gt; faceplanted into every pallet
---
It always cracks me up when survivor mains talk about getting stunned like it's a killer mistake.
---
The question is:
---
Is Solo Que too weak or SWF too strong?
---
Most people view SWF as baseline at this point but maybe SWF has just never been balanced?
---
Just telling you cause if you think that solo que will ever be buffed you are deluding yourself. If anything SWF will start handicapping grouped players, like every other fucking teamgame out there.
---
How do i prevent the stage 4 as a survivor tho
---
The post has 3k upvotes. And its 96% upvotes.

Nigg@ you blind. XD

1) I said one of the best, not the best

2) new kindred is better than bond

I don't know what that means

They were animals, and he slaughtered them like animals

Yeah no signal for the entity to take her. The race doesn't even seem to raise emotions out of her.
---
&gt; Every killer is nothing without a mask

RIP Hag, Freddy, Demogorgon, Spirit and Clown
---
It's literally impossible for a survivor to 1v1 the killer...
---
Bubba for BBQ.
---
If you want to learn how to chase and not rely on your power, play wraith. he's good for teaching fundamentals.
---
So they designed the maps to only have same wall exit gates? Then redesign the fuckin map...
---
I haven't been able to get into a single KYF match since that update.
---
Well said.
---
Some people clearly don't get that the killer is on the opposite team, sure it's fun to have a nice killer every now and then, absolutely, but I don't understand why people get to such an raw level of butthurt. Like of course you have the right to get upset but  people like that astonish me.
---
They aren't saying anything because they DC as soon as you grab someone.
---
he's right tho
---
Its sure because low rank don't know help your teamate like unhook so they think: oh to bad he got hooked, i  will not unhook him because i want to survive this game but there is 4 gen remaining. So people died on the first hook. 
---
Killer do facecamping or camping with noed. For ez kill.
---
Killer tunneling.
---
Player ragequit.
---
Killer play cancer like the cannibal with basement insidious camping. With tunneling.
---
Player kill herself because teamate are noob but i understand when you are rank 8 and you find a game with 2 20 rank and one 15 rank.
---
All of this make survivor died in such horrible method and they are mad because you need to play teamwork when you are solo but they leave you behind. Teamwork is needed in this game. Its not the game but survivor still don't play teamwork. But if its a cannibal basement insidious camping. Leave him behind because its useless to try free him. If you know how to counter this, plz tell me, and all survivor need to escape the basement without one behind, just the basement
---
"BuT yOu LoSt TwIcE!"
---
-BHVR, forgetting that you have to open the gates after the last gen, as well.
---
Getting one kill from face camping wouldn't pip you past brown ranks.
---
It is easy to look at this stuff on paper, because that's the point of it. You look at it, think about it, then determine potential reasoning which is exactly what I did when talking about which killers have the most killers and which have the least.
---
regarding 2k being balanced I'm not necessarily saying it is, I'm saying it's the goal BHVR aims for as the average if I'm not mistaken. They are overshooting that goal on all killers at red ranks and even all ranks aside from Nurse though just by a little bit for some killers.
---
At the end of the day statistically speaking, killers on average get closer to a 3k then a 2k and when they play well it's even more likely.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e1zrbb/sprint_burst_urban_bug_what_is_this_dbd_looool/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I'm in rank 12 atm and went on a 3 game streak of 4 iridescent emblems before I went to bed. I dont even play him much, and am not a great killer by far. He just has insane map pressure and with BBQ and Pop he has probably the strongest pressure in the game along with his thanataphobia esq add ons if you added a discordance or fuck it, even tinkerer you could probably give the survivors a hell of a time trying to complete gens. And he can end chases pretty fast with his whole kit.
---
I agree but then game with last person could be taken hostage
---
Nah. This dudes definitely one of those borderline alt right guys that pretends to use satire and subjective doubt to say they aren‚Äôt
---
I understand that he should definitely have all the advantage. That being said standing and looking at both doors is a little much
---
If he's the strongest, he's "overperforming" so they actually need to nerf him now.
---
At least from the logic we've seen so far.
---
Noed is a necessary evil because of generators being completed so fast. The other day I had 3 games where a survivor spawned right next to my ruin totem. In a row!
---
It depends if I slug for the 4k or not (I rarely do) But I'd say I lose about five escapes per day to hatches at five gens. I had three games in a row yesterday where I was chasing the 4th survivor and the hatch either spawned in front of them, or their speed burst from the hit propelled them to where it would spawn.
---
He‚Äôd be one of my mains if I could get bbq for him
---
Im just gunna say that if they are a somewhat good survivor, they prob told their teammate ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm getting chased, go for save‚Äù and the hooked one got saved while u are still chasing the survivor, cuz I‚Äôm assuming the survivor is not trash, it‚Äôs not as easy as ‚ÄúOh lemme down this player... oh done I downed him, oh look they saving... lemme down them‚Äù no, u have to prioritize something, once you do, u see the mistakes survivor make around that something and u kill them through their mistakes while still having a good match, if they are good this takes a long time since they rarely do any mistakes, stop acting like solo and swf is the same, a solo player wouldn‚Äôt have gotten the unhook in that situation, the swf would have
---
IMO the game should get harder for the winning team, much like Pool. A 4 man escape or a 4k should mean absolute victory, not just an easy steamroll.
---
I'm Battlefield the losing team gets a behemoth for a chance at retribution, if the opposing team still wins it means without a doubt that they got out matched.
---
I think 3k going on 4k should be very much survivor-sided, and reversely, a 4 man escape should be very unlikely and the killer should be able to easily kill at least one survivor if they're about to get a 4 man escape.
---
This kind of gameplay keeps games interesting and let's there be a "win" and an "absolute win". Currently, most games seems to be decided within the first few minutes of the game and it's just a steamroll from there from either side
---
This is why I just leave at egc if  they on the hook even if you did a chase that lasted 5 mins
---
If survivors want to not worry about the hatch being closed then they can bring keys. Also survivors can just 99 the doors to not deal with EGC.
---
This is the list of killers in red ranks. You don\`t usually try to learn nurse in red ranks because she is hard to play. So i would say this shows quite good how well nurse performs. 
---
If you want to count in the people learning nurse you should look at all ranks
---
It depends. I'm on Xbox, our rank 1 survivors are hella immersed. Slugging for a 4k very often leads to the match taking 30+ minutes. It isn't worth it to me to do that unless it's a toxic swf.
---
I hate it when this happens.
---
Sorry, but that was a DS escape. You get the resuce point reward for a successful grasp escape.
---
I'm just spitting facts
---
Damn, That‚Äôs annoying, the only reason I thought it somehow worked was because in the looking for group page on Xbox a lot of people are asking for people to join their KYF, maybe they don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs broken until they tryü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
As I blind myers*: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry daddy!‚Äù
---
I know but coop action give more rank point. But if you have potato teamate, i understand. When you keep the killer ALL the game and you died when exit gate are open because of rancor. I use decisive strike in the game and got hook one time and teamate don't heal me
---
Been saying ever since I came back how powerful this dude is with the most overloaded base kit in the game.
---
Which is weird, because Freddy seems really annoying to me. Annoying screen effect all game, immune to BT, RNG to wake up, and a ton of slowdown.
---
But at least Survivors aren't 100% safe if their teammate tells them he's far away like over half the cast gets.
---
Man Freddy really went and hit Nurse with the uno reverse card huh?
---
It isn't. Hesitating at pallets will give good survivors extra loops, or it will cause a time-wasting pallet standoff against bad survivors. All the while you're not making them expend their main defensive resource: the pallets. There are a few exceptions, but generally speaking the optimal play is to walk or attack through the pallet so the survivor has to drop it as soon as possible.
---
I think plague is the most annoying and unfun killer to play against. I strongly believe that dbd would be a better game if bhvr removed her from the game (but kept her perks).
---
I shit you not. I was watching this muted, and right as the axe landed, my stomach made a sound similar to the squelch the hit makes. 
---
Was rightfully confused
---
There are things BHVR sets as reportable and things that aren‚Äôt reportable.
---
If it‚Äôs not on the reportable list, and within the mechanics of the game, it‚Äôs fair game.
---
Stop thinking you get to dictate how anyone else plays this game. How selfish and entitled are you that you would look at your opponent and say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do what you want because I‚Äôm more important than you.‚Äù
---
It is fucking absurd that anyone would think they can control how their opponent in a competitive game plays.
---
One guy said SWFs should have to take exclusive perks from one another and honestly I like where that idea's going.
---
It clearly states clown is the weakest but ok
---
I main survivor and when I played my first few killer games after rank reset, my god... 3 gens done in 1 minute.
---
How to invert your karma fast.
---
Uhm... not when the suvivor hides, waits and opens the gate when the killer leaves.
---
Does this graph only show info post dedicated? Cause dedicated  servers definitely  affects players with not the greatest connection
---
This is GENIUS!!!
---
&gt; protecting gens should also count for pips.
---
they do, technically.
---
So having bad teammates in a team based game will make it harder to win?
---
Dedicated Servers
---
Imagine that, we‚Äôll I did not have to.
---
I was a milly waiting between the two gates, the siren goes off and the doors aren‚Äôt opening. I can‚Äôt even see the survivors open the door. The survivors got away. 
---
This isn‚Äôt unfair.
---
okay bud
---
Otz approves.
---
No but seriously, Killer Add-Ons are overall messed up. There are SO many that people won't even touch simply because they're either absolutely unnecessary (like the meme Add-Ons that handicap you and grant bonus BP) or simply because they lack synergy. Like, dafuq am I supposed to use reduced fatigue on Nurse for now that her blinks start recovering at the beginning of the fatigue anyway? The only niche reduced fatigue on Nurse has, is to punish locker jukes (which are really seldom against good Nurses anyway) and to cover more distance faster in case you're using the M1 Nurse Add-On.
---
But the same goes for lots of Killers. Movement speed increased during Corrupt Purge for Plague? High Rank Plagues that get into CP without apples are a myth anyway.
---
For what damn reason do we still have sabotage time Add-Ons on Trappers bear traps? Or the ones that increase disarm time by an absolutely amazing second.
---
Same goes for Wraith, why would I ever use "Blink" when it doesn't come up to Shadow Dance?
---
Pig, why the hell does she have skillcheck fail penalty increasing Add-Ons on boxes? If her crouch would be faster and not conceal the TR...Okay, maybe some random niche with Unnerving Presence, but that's obviously not the case.
---
Freddy, 60 seconds of Haemorrage or Blindness once interacting with a dream trap? WHY?!
---
It's just so lame that almost about 33% (on average) of the Add-Ons for each Killer are either useless or requieres too much dedication in order to make them useful. Like, sure, Haemorrage Add-Ons COULD be useful if I was an absolute potato and run Bloodhound...? Maybe?
---
And then we don't just have bad Add-Ons but also these unnecessary bitch-ass meme'y wonkey donkey dick Add-Ons that are like "Ayy, gotta make your power almost useless, but here are 100% more BP DURING the trial, not at the end :^)"
---
God I hate Add-Ons so damn much, everytime I think about it, it makes me so damn sad and angry. Especially as someone who was actually quite riled up for the Nurse rework.
---
Just put small game in your perk lineup permanently.  It has a use in every single match. 90% of the time killers are running a hex of some kind.
---
2k was considered a "win" for killers though.
---
Not necessarily, if a killer is the strongest, it just means he is the strongest.
---
Let's suppose he gets a slight nerf and then Billy becomes the strongest. If Billy is the strongest, this means he is overperforming? No. It just means he is the strongest. The way you are saying doesn't make sense, It's like saying that will have to nerf all killer until all killers become low tier.
---
You had zero chance to find the hatch first? Or beat the killer in the first case so you don‚Äôt need hatch?
---
You do you, Rambo.  Respect.
---
Well, BHVR's rationale is that you failed to do gens/protect your team and then failed to find the hatch, so you don't deserve accomodating exit gates, and TBH I agree, but not with the precedent of a single early death/DC creating an unwinnable situation. If hatch opened earlier after DCs or remaining Survivors increased in action speed when someone DCs early, then it'd sound more fair.
---
Lol Oh dweet.
---
When he activates his power I just let him hit me twice then cya late m8
---
I support universal healthcare, I have a little bit of an older attitude towards abortions but still "support" them (safe, legal, and seldom), I'm an egalitarian, and I support increased regulations against corporations, especially those to help the enviorment.
---
Billy is the perfect example of a very balanced killer. He's the most balanced killer in the entire game.
---
He's extremely strong in the right hands, but at the same time he has weaknesses that can be exploited.
---
He's fun to play as and he's fun to play against.
---
He's the perfect killer. I wish all killers were on Billy's power level.
---
The forum threads about these stats are way worse than anything I've seen in this subreddit, I feel really bad for the moderators there having to read those comments every day.
---
And Ruin shouldn't spawn on gens. Welcome to Dead By Daylight's awful RNG.
---
**Screeches in Coldwind Farm**
---
Not but seriously, especially the "Classic Maps" like Autohaven, Coldwind and MacMillan still have these extreme oldschool exit gate positionings none ever asked for.
---
I wish the exit gate positioning had like, a minimum of half the map of distance to each other. Making exit gates on every map similar to the ones on the The Game would be a bit too heavy, since they're almost always across the entire map from each other.
---
But there should never ever be exit gates that are less than half the map next to each other. Simply because EGC is already Killer sided to begin with.
---
It‚Äôs kind of bullshit though that a killer has to worry about watching two gates (if they actually spawn apart) plus a hatch at the end of the game.
---
I don't want to play her because I couldn't care less about trying on maps like Lery's when there's Spirit to pick.
---
But the Survivor had the chance to do all 5 gens.
---
And then the chance to find the hatch.
---
And then opposite exit gates would be a free escape against Killers who don't have a way of knowing which one you're on to chase you until EGC runs out.
---
I'm not a lore guy for the most part but that was just awful imo. Feels like it was written by a teenager.
---
I think also if they allow keyboard/mouse on console as well it'd be even. Im already seeing where keyboard and mouse has advantage over controller, and im not even entirely used to it yet.
---
High floor means it's really hard to do even a little bit of work with her. High floor is hard to learn, low floor is easy. Nurse has a high floor and high ceiling. 
---
An example of killer with a low skill floor is Wraith. His power is very basic and isn't skill based. Just cloak and uncloak. 
---
To put this in terms of OW characters, which is easier to understand, Genji or Widow has a high skill floor, Orisa has a low one.
---
Still whats the difference of letting 1 escape vs getting a 4k thats the mentality thats the problem. 4k should not be the outcome of every "win"
---
I know right lol.
---
But seriously, give M&amp;A / Distressing Spirit in addition with ms Add-Ons a shot. It's quite hillarious once you know what you're doing.
---
Honestly i dont understand how nurse is bad now, i have played her and she is still incredibly fucking easy, especially with add ons that benefit her now.
---
The closest I‚Äôve had was last night at Lerys. Walked in and found a gen and saw a hex totem next to it.
---
I remember a match where the Nurse was using those two 4.2 move speed addons of 1 blink and no blink after a hit and it was actually kinda terrifying as well as surprisingly effective. Maybe that'll be her new meta with maybe PWYF and other movement speed perks?
---
Any killer played right is essentially the best killer in the right eyes
---
True, but they should also mitigate the snowball effect to compensate. EGC means one side has already won, and it's an opportunity to cheat them out of what they've earned, but 3 Survivors will almost never get to finish 3 or more gens.
---
Actually 3 minutes. Only faster with pigs perk hangman's trick but nobody plays that perk, except people going for the adept pig achievement
---
I don't have a problem eith perks that let you recover from some faults, but i have a problem eith perks thst make survivers do super stupid things ehich they usually wouldn't do if ds wasn't active. Like going into a locker in the while the killer is chasing and seeing you, or working on a gen into the killers face that's not even doable in the next few seconds, because you know that the killer has to be cautious to not grab you. Because, you know, you have ds so you better use it, right? 
---
Well, it's in the game so it's totally fine to use without any reprecussions right? Just let me use my mori for a second, would you...
---
Funny enough I've had this with Demo like 2 or 3 times, por last guy didn't have a chance
---
Trapper spends time putting traps down, most of which a smart survivor can find easily. This means the early game, at least 1 gen is lost, because he has to spend it on setting traps in his territory. So by you taking forever to escape a trap that YOU made the mistake of stepping into, he has earned the right to smite you down. YOU stepped into his trap, YOU weren‚Äôt cautious, YOU are at fault here.
---
This is coming from a trapper main who hates going against trappers.
---
Never show mercy, the survivors will show you nothing close it.
---
Okay even though these gate spawns are shitty what is he supposed to do? Walk to the other side of the map and let him escape?
---
My only complaints are his design and dream pallets, and not because i think either are op.
---
His design i dislike because it feels like a mashup of several other killers, hag traps, clown slow, doctor pallets, pig interactable that survivors have to periodically interact with, it just feels very uninspired compared to his original design
---
Dream pallets i hate because it takes any thought process out of his power, theres no setting time for pallets and getting more doesn‚Äôt require anything at all. Because of this theres no decision making on where to best place them, you just drop one where you can. Compare this to hag or trapper who have to carefully think about where to place them.
---
No way anyone can open those
---
No I don‚Äôt think he does.
---
Nurse base kit didn't need nerfs, what other major changes made the game "healthier"? Upcoming legion changes were unnecessary, the spirit changes are hamfisted, bad killers keep getting nerfed (pig(various nerfs), trapper(steps in his own fresh traps))... 
---
Please explain your reasoning
---
I wasnt saying one should be equal. Sorry I misunderstood your comment. I thought you were saying the killer is the power role and therefore should have an easier time winning at all times because survivors are supposed to be afraid of the killer and the killer is supposed to always have an advantage which is what some players believe. My fault.
---
*laughs in brutal strength*
---
Ok that‚Äôs one pallet down... half a dozen more to go... oh right I forgot not to count the ones I trapped! Heh!
---
Que tal
---
Really? I never saw it as that way, interesting.
---
I always saw it as a graph, where the Y axis was performance Having a high ‚Äúfloor‚Äù puts the minimum performance higher, but usually have a low skill ceiling which makes them only able to get so much value out of a character.
---
Ex. Genji or widow have low skill floors, meaning with worse skill, their performance is much lower, but mercy has a much higher skill floor, meaning their minimum performance for being low skill is much higher than that of a low skill widow or genji.
---
If they only had 20 seconds of run they would need to be way faster or killer slower ,to actually break los
---
playing dwight is praxis
---
I love this art style on wraith.
---
When the ptb goes live balanced landing will mute the sound of falling so lightweight just needs to get that footstep muffle
---
So avg gens completed, gens/minute on average per rank, I notice we don't have perk or item stats this time around to see the impact of Ruin, Corrupt, or Toolboxes...
---
I‚Äôve actually been planning on it for a while cuz I‚Äôve had great success with surveillance during chases. They assume you‚Äôre chasing so they ignore your terror radius and you can just grab them with less effort and time wasted than you‚Äôd expend on the chase. I‚Äôm just afraid to give up stridor bbq and ruin
---
I usually find totems when I run plunderers. I find their proximity to chests to be closer than gens and survivor spawn locations.
---
&gt; killer goes around whole map
---
Not necessarily (Trapper) and also much of the killer‚Äôs survey happens while the hatch has not spawned. Which side has the advantage depends on how many gens have been done. If no gens were done then killer will tend to have the advantage because of movespeed. If 4 gens were done then the remaining survivors typically have plenty of time to find the hatch. Especially if they‚Äôve been 3 gen‚Äôd. 
---
I bet it‚Äôs more likely than you think, even without comms. If there are 3 survivors left with 1 gen to go, that‚Äôs three survivors who could find the hatch in their travels. If hatch spawns away from the last couple gens, a survivor that runs to an area without gens when chased will be more likely to find the hatch because killers don‚Äôt like taking chases far from the last couple gens.
---
Pretty much.
---
Personally I'd rather keep the two fun and interesting items in the game than remove both of them and make the game more boring. But that's just me.
---
At all ranks sure. Not surprising low ranks suck ass as nurse
---
Watching so many pallets being wasted *hurts my soul*
---
This game isnt the most toxic...in my opinion and experience that award goes to cod
---
Honestly got the idea to make this because of the meme Otz made.
---
But yeah, I agree. A lot of add ons are pretty bad or useless. Some of them even make the game easier / better for the survivors which just makes no sense. I hope eventually the bad add ons can get a rework.
---
Another thing I kinda dislike about add ons are the words like moderately, considerably, etc. I wish they could instead say exactly how much, either in percent or seconds. Like for darkening traps, I wish it could say the percent of how much darker they become. Imo "moderately" doesn't help or mean anything at all
---
While true it‚Äôs not a fair comparison as Nurse has a very high learning curve i believe nurse was higher at red ranks than most other killers.
---
And clown doesn‚Äôt surprise me i‚Äôve been saying clown is the worst killer in the game for a while and nobody believes me.
---
I totally do it. And then I start yoga breathing lmao
---
It was pure horror
---
I‚Äôve never seen someone edit comments so much, just.... damn
---
It's the Geistra Obsession pack. I'll link it for you.
---
This just gave BHVR an idea for the next TIV tome challenge.
---
Why does this sound like a cringe ending to a 2004 kids movie..
---
The lithe dance with me combo is definitely underrated
---
Sounds like the 4th guy had a blast
---
I understand that. But it‚Äôs an average across all players. An average means some people will hit above that mark and some will hit below, it‚Äôs not that they want a 50% for individual players. It‚Äôs across all. Like most competitive games, the top players should be hitting above that mark.
---
Yeah, but I am a shit survivor, they'd be better off without me I promise
---
&gt;are even moderately competent at killer in red ranks then you know that most survivors are bad, even at red ranks.
---
nope, you gotta get rid of your superiority complex
---
&gt;All I'll say about your strawmen and ad hominems and poor grammar is that I acknowledge you wrote that.
---
ah yes i concur my good fellow
---
color me fucking amazing but I could
---
Are you sure about that?
---
See the issue in this instance is that the killer didn't play optimally. Hooking everyone twice before any kills is a class act move, but a class act way to lose the game.
---
As an example - https://youtu.be/NKFK7fGy4u0
---
Hope I was able to help!
---
Oh I know it doesn‚Äôt effect whispers. But it does freak out survivors trying to open an exit gate. Plus it‚Äôs bonus BP
---
I usually use edit if something comes to my mind and I‚Äôm a person who thinks way too much so I usually find something to say
---
Big doubt
---
Bonus BP and it puts stress on survivors trying to open exit gates
---
Please don‚Äôt edit this
---
Not at all surprising considering the fact he's very overtuned right now, he's got the best map pressure (especially combined with ruin/pop), gen speeds are slowed to a halt if he brings addons or runs DL/thana, his snares and pallets combined with no terror radius, disappearing at range, being short and hard to see on loops,  these all make him end chases quickly. Don't get me started on how BT is completely useless against him. Its gotten to the point where I don't think any other killer will ever be as boring to play against as Freddy with slowdown perks and addons stacked.  
---
About the Nurse stats, this is taking into account console and it's across all ranks, Nurse is the hardest killer to learn so the lower ranked and newer players are struggling, which brings the percentage down.
---
WHAT
---
I‚Äôm not gonna cuz I had nothing else to say about that subject.
---
it's all ranks so it includes all the new players who don't know how to read the obvious red text that says "Difficulty: Hard" and play nurse when they suck at the game
---
I guess but i usually if i hear a terror radius and over halfway dont ill jist stay on the gate as a best bet so you should only run it on the lower ranks (13 and above)
---
Because of console players and low rank players who don‚Äôt know how to use her inflating the chat. She had over a 70% kill rate in red ranks before the nerf, and it weeded out all the dogshit addon abusers.
---
Simple fix: Don't tunnel and slug them if you think they have DS.
---
Can I ask you a question? Were you literally never hit while healthy and exposed (against anyone besides Myers, I guess)? I understand why people think it means the killer can see you, but I do not understand at all how that belief can persist for years
---
Then you aren't really making a point. The kill rates are high across the board, if your point is just "there are less killers in red ranks because it is to whatever extent more difficult than non-red ranks", well, that much is obvious. But the killers that are red rank are killing 2 or more of the survivors they get matched with there, the 60+% is not a statistical "mistake", but the reality of killers in red ranks. 
---
How many there are is another question, but "red ranks" encompasses a lot more players than your post made it out to, since it takes not one depip, but 16 to drop out of red ranks. And (safety-)pipping as killer in red ranks is neither hard nor strictly requires 2 or more kills. It's on the contrary possible to depip with a 3-4k, and that would then skew red rank kill rates downwards (but it doesn't, because killers that get to red rank do not regularly leave it again as the pipping requirements in this game are not hard and you have to depip a lot and consistently to derank).
---
I‚Äôm not sure I would call this build fun, but I find it very strong. What I generally use is Ruin, BBQ, POP goes the weasel and discordance.
---
BBQ is good for the points but is also exceptional on Freddy for the ability to immediately jump to your next target after a hook.
---
Pop is good for the same reason, especially paired with bbq. It is so powerful to be able to stop a generator at 95%.
---
Discordance is a good one for many reasons. Because you can see what gens are getting gunned down, you can spam your teleport in a chase to slow them down. They will get off of it for at least a little bit. Then, if your chase isn‚Äôt going well, after faking a couple times you can jump to it and hope they stayed close for a free hit.
---
Ruin is ruin. I run I because Freddy‚Äôs greatest strength in my hands is the teleport and every gen done is less power I have.
---
Look at the stats again. In all ranks the Nurse is the weakest. The Clown is the weakest killer only in red ranks
---
In my experience Stridor might be really damn good on her, but with that build in particular you won't need it. Simply because the chases you initiate are abandoned most of the time anyway. This build is literally about initiating a chase and immediately abandon with your phase to get either a free grab or free hit on a Survivor sitting on a generator. Thanks your increased phasing speed, you can also use the collision to identify the positioning of the the Survivor on the generator. Even when this won't work with the nerf anymore.
---
But if you really want that backup-tool, go for Ruin / Stridor / M&amp;A / Distressing. BBQ is the weakest out of those 3, simply because it can be negated quite easily. And once you're a Killer with some sort of experience, you can predict the gen they're currently working on anyway. Most of the time that is.
---
So yeah, Stridor / Ruin / Distressing / M&amp;A should do the trick for you. If you're really sceptical and want to min-max, toss a Jigsaw Piece in aswell, it's by far the best map for this build. Just because of how Terror Radius works. In addition not using Stridor is a bit more forgiving on this map because stains are easier to track whilst not being in the phase.
---
This can't possibly be a repost. It must just be a time traveler confused about what year we're in.
---
Pgtw, tinkerer, bbq, ruin
---
So I main Legion and Huntress and Legion is slowly overtaking her as my favorite. 
---
Legion is very fun for me because she (Julie gang for life) has high mobility and easy access to information. I look at it like this. 
---
You walk in with an information perk or two and the rest to do whatever you want. I like Discordance and will explain why shortly. You start the game and, ideally, will have an information perk firing off pretty quick. You might have to hunt someone down, doesn't really matter. When you find your first survivor, you Feral Frenzy them. You now now where every other survivor in your terror radius is. Discordance helps this because you're almost guaranteed at least one other survivor in the area. Now you pinball around, stabbing everyone you can. Feral Frenzy runs out. You chase whoever you hit last, down them, and hook them. 
---
Now the game gets interesting. You've got between one and three survivors that are probably still injured. Maybe your information perk fires again and you can run people down. If so, maybe Feral Frenzy if you think you'll get good information. If not, just chase and down them. Otherwise, just patrol gens until you find someone. Then rinse and repeat. It sounds dull, and can be for the first few gens, but once you get a few left you become a terror. It's very easy to move between the gens and your excellent chase potential, combined with your information perks and Frenzy, mean you can get solid control over the engame in a very satisfying way. 
---
Reading over it, this isn't communicating the fun of it as well, but it is really enjoyable when you start looking at Frenzy as a source of information rather than an offensive ability. The trick for me to figure out Legion was to learn when to chase and when to Frenzy -- I basically only Frenzy when I know there are more survivors in the area or am having trouble finding one of the two remaining survivors. You'd be surprised how, after you slug someone once or twice, their invisible buddy will stick around in Killer Instinct radius to prepare for next time.
---
All I want is Borrowed Time, is that too much to ask?!?!
---
Technically no, if other survivors have unbreakable then they'll keep them. Since it's one of Bill's teachables bill will start with unbreakable as one of his three starting perks. (Assuming of course unbreakable is the perk I'm thinking of.)
---
All of these comments are good and right, but I'm gonna go ahead and just plug that you should play a killer you like and think is interesting. So long as you practice with an open mind and don't get discouraged by the normal process of learning, you can surely improve into any killer you think is interesting
---
so the world really did end in 2012 cause i don't remember cod being like that
---
But in 1v1 you have 0 chance of escape
---
It's not about winning. It's about a killer camping someone and essentially ruining the game for them.
---
Call it strategy if you want, I don't give a fuck, it ruins the enjoyment of the game.
---
Hell, I'm not even blaming killers for doing it. I put blame squarely on the developers for not figuring out a way to minimize camping while also creating a balanced game. If they are going to allow camping then they should make it harder to down or hook survivors. If they do that then they should make repairing gens and other things harder for the survivors.
---
It's been pretty clear for a while now that mobility is #1 for Killers, followed by stealth. Spirit, Nurse, Freddy and Billy are the Big 4 because they can move quickly, followed by Ghostface because he can move without being detected. Freddy's probably the top because he also gains some stealth vs. sleeping Survivors (and has slowdown, the third most valuable attribute).
---
Clown in particular is the greatest example of an M1 Killer, though. No matter how much else he can do with his power, his fundamental movement is just too weak.
---
This sounds delicious yet disgusting....I‚Äôll take one of each please
---
And that‚Äôs saying a lot...
---
*insert long, elaborate transformation sequence*
---
Shit guys, he hit tier III!
---
Look at all those wasted pallets
---
Of all the games I play or have played this is the only one.
---
Top reason i dont stream killer
---
"Have all 4 survivors trapped in bear traps at the same time"
---
Visionary
---
How would it make dbd die off deathgarden has rich cast of characters that would go to waste
---
Funny because there is plenty of counterplay to no add-on spirit. Double back, iron will which isn't a  niche perk, etc...
---
‚ÄúQuality over quality‚Äù
---
You can do whatever you want. I'll say survivors don't like if you let the last person get the hatch, and he/she was a bad player, which I kinda adapted to my gameplay. If I notice someone camping the hatch and the other person is on last gen, I would rather get the person near the hatch and let the other guy get away.
---
Thanks grammar nazi
---
You‚Äôre entire scenario could happen the same with with a group of random survivors. If someone is on the hook and another player gets injured you don‚Äôt need comms to tell you to go in for the save. Plus running kindred would remove the entire need for comms in this situation. 
---
In that last scenario you described would be beneficial for a killer. You know at most one survivor is working on objectives so you have done you‚Äôre job by applying map pressure. If you don‚Äôt keep up that pressure, it‚Äôs not the SWFs fault, it‚Äôs ours. 
---
Also being in a SWF doesn‚Äôt make you any better at looping a killer. If you find a god tier looping survivor it‚Äôs your fault for investing too much time into a chase.
---
 The thing about good SWFs is that they force you to play your best. You have to continually apply pressure across the map and you will get punished if you don‚Äôt. Maybe use these games at learning experiences on how to be a good killer instead of whining that SWFs are too strong. And if you don‚Äôt like playing high tier killers, then you have to understand there are some games that are not winnable because killers like huntress, trapper, and wraith struggle with map pressure.
---
Or making a second alarm clock per person functional.
---
If you're the last survivor and don't have the gate open, then you're not really meant to win. If the killer got 3/4 and then closed the hatch, you're supposed to die. If you get away, cool, you got lucky, it happens. But don't expect a fair shot to escape in this situation.
---
I actually soft disagree that Legion is easy to play. I have huge amounts of success with her in low green/high purple (I know I'm not a top tier killer or anything), and I think that the people who say Legion is bad just aren't good at playing Legion. My friend likens it to Old Freddy: very good if you knew how to use him and had the playstyle down, but difficult otherwise. I wouldn't know, I never played old Freddy.
---
I think he means that he doesn‚Äôt have the teachable for unbreakable, and got it before it was a teachable on console.  If that‚Äôs the case, I do believe if you prestige her you won‚Äôt be able to get unbreakable on her bloodweb unless you level up bill first.
---
Dwight's tear
---
Feels like so much less.
---
Especially since it doesn't take long to find 1 more person.
---
Ha pc player
---
Same. Literally the only teachable I dont have and I am too stubborn and cheap to buy Adam.
---
I do do that, but differently, if I haven't seen the player for the whole game, all the others are dead and I've found the hatch, I just close it and start the hunt for the other guy, because it's really just 50/50 whether they were being an ass or just really good at the game, so if they get our through a door it's all fair
---
Take them all. I never use them
---
I accidentally posted this twice because the post button bugged out fuck.
---
Most Nurse mains with thousands of hours that I've talked to complain about her feeling very clunky on dedicated servers and said she's unfun to play. I assume that's where the percentage drop mostly comes from.   
---
Also, technically speaking, she is the Invoker/Lee Sin/Akali of DbD in terms of difficulty.
---
One time to turn my lunge more I legit turned sideways and picked my leg up. I still hit the wall.
---
I mean, it‚Äôs probably just because I can‚Äôt counter her to save my life, but I too hate playing against her. Whenever I go against a Plague it‚Äôs just not fun for me :(
---
That's a totally tone-deaf take on it, though. Matches snowball immensely, so Killers often 4k off of a DC, AFK, or potato. They would then need to lose the majority of their matches to achieve a 50% average.
---
2k and 2 escape in a match is on the rare side, and often comes from things like NOED or camping.
---
And I end up committing to hunting them and chase them until adrenaline triggers.
---
Sure, blaming the website instead of admitting your fault.
---
Well putting both exit doors on the same wall is stupid and there's nothing you or anyone else can say to justify it...
---
I've been called a thorough person by several folks throughout my days.  Pattern recognition comes along with the territory.
---
In the recent weeks I have said aloud to my friends, on at least two occasions, that I believe there must be issue with map tile shuffling specifically regarding exit gate tile placements.
---
Though I haven't collected any measurable data to support it, in thousands of hours of play I have observed enough maps to make a speculation with confidence;
---
(Knowing that the number of outer wall tiles are a static constant value unique per each map, and that there must be 2 of said value designated as exit gate tiles..
---
.. and filtering out any tiles that must always be an outer wall and therefore may not ever be allowed to be anything other than a basic outer wall tile..)
---
The exit gates are consistently spawning with the minimum threshold number of outer wall tiles between them 
---
Or conversely.. the exit gates are consistently spawning with the maximum threshold number of outer wall tiles between them
---
You are correct sir.
---
Hey not_Queen, hope to see more posts like this! Would be neat to see even more stats, like a breakdown of perks, and maybe even certain combos that standout to you guys (ex. a killer that synergizes heavily with two specific perks).
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e20bcv/out_of_all_the_dead_by_daylight_glitches_getting/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Same fam. Especially when swinging through a pallet. It feels &lt;9000% better when it connects too.
---
Those stats are awful at determining anything. I have had so many games where a 1K turned into more for the killer only because everyone decided to suicide mission because fuck it. I have had many games as killer where I got no one and several people just let themselves be entity-ed.
---
sorry yeah probably wasn‚Äôt too clear but this answers it thank you! Wanted to check it was the same where you need to buy auric cells and then buy the in game content
---
Humans are as ants to the elder god that is the Entity, it does not care if people see it happen, what could humans possibly do to stop it? It does these things with impunity because it is a God.
---
Lmao got it only now?
---
Was that burn necessary, lad? I‚Äôm already screaming from this aching bear trap on my leg :(
---
About as stupid as putting them at opposite ends of a huge map, I guess. It happens.
---
The big issue is that cleansing is punished, making her power uncounterable except for genrush. Seeking out and using fountains already takes time, and they become unavailable to others once used, so building Corrupt Purge from either every fountain being used as normal, or from Survivor time spent fully infected would actually create a choice in priorities, vs. the one correct answer here.
---
It's Resolution scale that makes this happen especially if you have a 1440p or higher res, it can be fixed but it will make the game look like ass
---
yeah using the left and right keys probably would help a lot, thx
---
Apparently not according to the developers own stats. Clown's the overall worst killer and THE worst killer in the red ranks.
---
Its latency, not hit boxes. Just another person who doesn't know what they're talking about.
---
I see the survivors are rising up after those stats got released. Keep it coming
---
And that is where I'm worried about them shooting them together.  They had over 2 years to work on the 2018 movie  And it was clear they put a lot of love and care into its shooting multiple movies together or worse  Just shooting them quickly causes a lot of confliction and a lot of problems that ends up with messages like Halloween 3 and h20
---
Malicious dedicated server noises
---
Did anyone say that? What I saw was "Of course people pick Spirit; everyone else is getting stomped now that Nurse has been nerfed."
---
Monto: pathetic.
---
Usually when I'm in a chase, I start leaning forward the closer I get, until I notice I'm doing that then I stop
---
Because keys are kinda ‚Äúoh well we got enough gens done we just auto win now‚Äù
---
Always liked Friday the 13th, would be very fun to play as him, especially on a cabin map, the original filmüòÅüòÅ.
---
This is the killer equivalent of the hatch spawning in front of you as survivor.
---
I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just the easiest example I can come up with. Invoked also isn‚Äôt from league.
---
This is both really dumb and really clever.

*laughs in friendly mode on this community server being a thing*

Make it so there's an indicator for everyone when they're being chased, not just the obsession.

i still think nurse is hella good and that freddy is still rubbish
---
I love how y'all cry and bitch about camping then go and destroy campers with borrowed time decisive strike and deliverance every single time,   
---
y'all don't know what the hell y'all are trying to talk about lol   
---
Those three perks DESTROY camping every single time,   
---
you know it,   
---
I know it,   
---
everybody knows it,   
---
so stop lying, crying, and wasting everyone's time.
---
Yes that what i mean because i don't want to lost my time for up my bill lvl1 for unbreakable. But if its necessairy i will because i need it for anti tunneling, with decisive strike.
---
They need to make survival less binary. Right now the game is extremely win/lose, which is ridiculous because as you mentioned, hook distribution changes everything.
---
It's not too late for them to make Survival BP come at an increasing rate per gen culminating in an escape bonus and balance around 3k so that Killers feel like a threat and escaping is gratifying, but you still make significant BP as Survivor.
---
Moris would have to not instantly depip you though.
---
What the hecc happened here
---
Wow this map format would be cancer as nurse.
---
I usually refer to people by their character's gender. So a pig is she. People don't have a gender for me online until they tell me or act like a girl/boy, though.
---
But what with you coming out has to do with it.
---
Because it's easier to scam people on mobile
---
I do this when it's my second time on a hook lol
---
but git gud tho
---
I mean i have the perk on feng min but not teachable. Because its been a while i don't play this survivor. I been 1 years and more. Or 2 year. Where bill perk was on every survivor
---
I can't acess it, I'm at work :( Dead by Daylight's forum is blocked here.
---
You: This community is friendly! 
---
Also you: *kills the shirtless David*
---
Whether or not its true that more killers win, thats just because the mass majority of pre Purple rank Survivors never use items. 4 brown toolboxs is still OP, cuttong gens from 80 to roughly 60 seconds solo. Just because a lot of people are bad doesnt mean killers are better, it just means they feel safe often enough to stay bad. Notice how immersed the last 2 ppl get in pretty much every match the killer iswinning, when survivors do that all game and run straight away from the killer at pallet you win if your team is on gens no problem no skill, god loops just embarrass the killer for little progress.
---
Without the teachable perk?
---
The only counter arguement I have is Iron Will counters all killers, as it is a pretty good perk for loosing chases.  Other than that, yea you got me on those.
---
Where will you be when period strikes?
---
Found the Survivor main.
---
this thread really took a turn
---
Agreed 100%. Now I only use it for solo queuing when I keep getting selfish randoms. So I in turn play selfish too. But if I can I try to run Inner strength instead. Or for her archive challenge where I‚Äôm you have to heal yourself with self care.
---
I'd level Feng first.
---
Alert provides great information about the killer's location
---
Lithe is an amazing exhaustion perk that will see use on any map, except the game because fuck vaults I guess.
---
Technician will provide moral support while you completely ignore it.
---
Yeah 9 chests are soooooo common. I'd like to see how many keys he'd get from the basic 3 chests a game...
---
They are but it does nothing for the rare green perks which i think should be brought up to purple as a nice Qol change to make finding them easier.
---
It is a good feeling if you manage to pop NOED and save teammates before someone dies on the hook. I'm not saying it happens often. But when it does. Feels good.
---
Why should the last survivor be able to escape anyway? The hatch is already a crappy mechanic, forcing slugging (which is no fun for anyone) for a 4K
---
Yes, after 800 hours - Better late than never I guess
---
I'm in that posture right now, how the fuck did you know, weird
---
People can‚Äôt try new killers in red ranks? They‚Äôre normally players who are just really fucking good. They can still try new killers, they‚Äôre allowed. Plus, only like the top 10% or so of nurses are actually good
---
You can also try turning less for the first second. That‚Äôs what I do unless I need to navigate I don‚Äôt move my mouse much
---
Depends on the map, on large maps if someone disarms one of the traps and starts opening the gate they can easily open it before the Trapper can come over *cough* Ormound *cough*
---
Also from my experience I have rarely seen a Trapper trap both exit gates (if they even do it at all, it's just one), this might just be my experience though.
---
This is only true if you are talking about ebony moris. If you go into a game with a yellow mori by the time you satisfy the requirements to use it that surv would be dead anyway. It basically just saves you the walk over to the hook and probably has little to no impact on kill rate.
---
Cross your fingers and hope for the bloodweb later today. Who knows?
---
I don't think they were talking about lore. They might've meant that it feels really bad to get bullied because it's common to get nigh-unwinnable matches due to how bad the ranking system is.
---
Jasons ability just sounds like Spirit 2.
---
Bitch i made a post about doing drawing for fun its not like im trying to be the best artist no im just drawing dumb shit for random people
---
I actually had ruin and haunted grounds spawn within a few tiles of me going one direction the other day. Felt bad until I got face camped.
---
It's broken for any killer with some type of fast movement, hag, nurse, oni, wraith
---
Really trying to figure out how he got me on my last animation frame
---
Shirtless Myers skin when
---
The don‚Äôt call it terrible your just fishing for compliments patheticü§£
---
Utterly adorable.
---
All im say is im not surprised you make memes for facebook and that you main spirit
---
I'm actually super against tunneling, but i hate players that sprint into my face after they get unhooked because they have borrowed + ds and they start body blocking me until i hit them.
---
Simple fix: Use a mori.
---
Its just example more more daily also chase says need to play x surviors while pallets you can do with any so there is need for some challange
---
It is MA'AM!
---
Yea it makes sense. I‚Äôve been using a different idea of skill floor, rather than comparing the minimum point to be considered ‚Äúskilled‚Äù I measured it as skill as a whole. Funny enough this is the first time I‚Äôve heard of skill floor in this context , it‚Äôs interesting
---
And by the way, it's _A_ Nurse's Calling. Not Nurse's Calling.
---
Consider [the following.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS7nn1B03YQ)
---
Of course, stats include moris.
---
No.  They said everyone will keep bill teachables on console even if they are level 1.  You can check if you go to Bill they will be ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù
---
You know what also shouldn‚Äôt be a thing hatch escapes at 5 gens left because of lucky spawn
---
How am i fishing for compliments i just know its bad (like you said) but i think like one or two people might enjoy it
---
You're certainly at a disadvantage when your the last survivor - but isn't that the whole design of the game though? That you're against a murderer who is significantly stronger than yourself individually, so you need to work with your fellow survivors to escape?
---
Getting fixed next patch
---
That's the EGC for you. A real roll of the dice as to whether the last Survivor gets out or not.
---
I‚Äôm just saying that i‚Äôve read every comment that‚Äôs come through, and over half have been negative towards Behaviour
---
How else would they sort them?
---
Meh, this doesn't show strongest and weakest.
---
It quite literally shows who has the highest ratio of power to skill required.
---
Freddy is by no means the strongest killer in the game (top 5 for sure) but rather he is one of the easiest to use at least somewhat effectively, while still being quite strong. Similarly, nurse is by no means the weakest. In fact nurse is the strongest killer in the game when played perfectly. The problem is that she is also by far the hardest killer to play with any level of effectiveness. A Billy still has mobility if you cant land saws, a huntress can still punish bad vaults or pallet throws if you cant aim hatchets, but a nurse who cant blink is lucky to get a single hook all game.
---
Yhea i was trying to draw maskless killers and leatherface is next
---
So you're saying the worst killer should be able to beat an absolutely optimal team without their best addons? Why? That's like saying a 4 man swf running non-meta perks should be able to beat an iri head huntress with infantry belt and ebony mori. There is literally 0 chance. Hell, there's literally 0 chance even if they do run meta perks.
---
You can literally make builds on killer that would make it impossible to win as an optimal SWF. I'm talking 0 out of 100 times. That isn't possible for survivor players. If you want to make it fair, why shouldn't there be builds that would make getting even a 1k impossible? 
---
Do I think that there are killers that need buffs? Absolutely yes. Do I think literally every killer should be able to beat an optimal 4 man SWF without their best addons? Absolutely not.
---
It‚Äôs not fully rng since you litterally have an interactible to wake up that is a guarantee til a set time
---
Im complaining from a survivor point of solo queueing being a bad experience, which was the original thread viewpoint, which killer I main shouldn‚Äôt matter since it‚Äôs for a survivor‚Äôs viewpoint, I never said it was overpowered, I‚Äôm just saying that solo queue is way weaker and need a buff of some kind like a proxy chat, now shut up about legion before I make the Holocaust look like a fucking tea party
---
Thank you, fam.
---
And you don't have to open the gate in one shot. Unlike gens, gates don't display progress, so you can 50% it, hide, wait, then finish it after they leave again.
---
Ghostface is simply very popular and decently strong.
---
Billy is (speaking as a billymain) incredibly fun to use and pretty good in every scenario except for some very few maps.
---
**^(J U S T G E T O U T O F T H E W A Y)**
---
Its okay i know its bad but after looking at her unmasked in game she doesnt have eyes and she has a crew cut so it was confusing for me too
---
Then I have been wooshed.
---
So why are there so many SWF bullies? Or maybe it's that solo survivors comprise the majority of players and SWFs 0king don't make a large enough impact to show what the game's like in practice.
---
Maybe it's that the game FEELS shitty in general because every loss as Killer is as egregious as possible.
---
Okay after leatherface nurse is next
---
I play most of the killers but usually gravitate toward Freddy because it feels like he's just got everything and is so easy to play. I would be sad if he got nerfed  but I wouldn't be surprised.
---
half a minute of constant blind. if only she knew to look up
---
I run the same build as you but swap discordance for whispers because I've noticed a lot of higher ranked survivors know not to double up on gens
---
DBD Jup
---
That's an average. Killers snowballs, so 1k generally = 3/4k.
---
0k bully matches are offsetting that.
---
YEA! NOW NOED DOESN'T AFFECT ME
---
Thank you.
---
That is some Aimbot type shit dear fuck
---
I personally haven‚Äôt even used surveillance since it get reworked,  but I could see the benefit of it. It wouldn‚Äôt work on gens you have no idea survivors have touched yet, since you wouldn‚Äôt have kicked them
---
+1! It pains me whenever I see a Hag not using traps much. Use those things! They are such helpful tools. Hell even if you are outside of the teleport range it still tells you where someone is.
---
If killers cant close the hatch and can't pull survivors out of it, survivors are guaranteed a win every time. As it is now, both sides have a chance of winning depending on the spawns (which is honestly more than survivors should get)
---
I don‚Äôt have ideas just criticism that‚Äôs what you asked for but I will say it‚Äôs very hard to come up with perks for killers and survivors that don‚Äôt exist so don‚Äôt feel bad your ideas aren‚Äôt the best because there have definitely been worse
---
You could make so many pipe myers either really uncomfortable or really horny
---
True, true. I also actually run thrilling tremors sometimes because fungoose one of the streamers I watch uses it for Gen blocking and info!
---
Mercy
---
True, but nurse especially so. 
---
She ignores the rules of the game.
---
Considering you failed twice I think it's pretty clear that the killer should have the most power in endgame collapse
---
I don't think it should spawn this close because that's oppressive to survivors.
---
You should be at a disadvantage if you were the last person in endgame collapse.
---
Your team failed to complete the generators
---
You failed to get to hatch
---
After failing twice why do you think it should be easier for you to escape.
---
As a killer if you fail 2 to stop the generators from being powered
---
Then fail to to stop the gates from being opened
---
Getting a kill is extremely difficult it would be completely hypocritical for me to claim that it should be easier for me after failing twice
---
come on man at least time stamp it =P https://youtu.be/9U_k7BAYc2Y?t=832
---
That doesn't belong on a perk either way.  Look at all the hoops you have to jump through for play with your food.
---
I mean literally a main part of the game is sprinting back and forth with the killer, love it or hate it. If that‚Äôs not fun you probably shouldn‚Äôt be playing survivor.  In addition is mint rag really an op addon for hag? I mean she‚Äôs such a slow character that relies on constantly teleporting to traps to get cheaky hits, maybe it works to get a grab early on in the game and then exit gate camp in the end but other than that it seems like it just makes her significantly worse.
---
Have you ever heard of dead hard? That‚Äôs what it does except you also get distance this is just an alternate version of dead hard
---
And when is this skin coming out?
---
Proximity chat is what made PUBG so fun imo. Being able to talk to the people you're up against can def be toxic, but I can guarantee it would make for interesting lobbies
---
I didnt say i like the idea/perks lul
---
I won‚Äôt kink shame but keep it down on the drooling please
---
Unless the game is balanced around red ranks, it doesn't tell you anything about balance.  All it's showing you is who the players with the highest skill ceiling choose to play.  That's not at all indicative of the outcome of a majority of the matches in the game.
---
If you want to balance the game around red ranks, with ~70% kill rate across all killers, you're talking major killer nerfs to get that down to the 50% the devs want.  And frankly that would just make the lower ranks way too freaking easy for survivors.
---
This has to be one of the worst ideas I‚Äôve seen.
---
Yea I think it‚Äôs only ps4 having these issues rn
---
These statistics aren‚Äôt very good at telling how good a killer is as it‚Äôs literally dependent on the player playing them and most of which are bad at playing those killers
---
"I'm not running No Mither... I always spawn in injured like this!"
---
Yeah OK buddy.
---
"Just make good map for me lol not hard to do"
---
Ok obviously I've heard of Dead Hard and I kept that in mind. This perk is meant as a bodyblock or last ditch effort perk. You dont use it to "dodge" an attack, you use it to "withstand" one. It's most effective use could be bodyblocking the killer, as he has to hit you, or wait 2 seconds. You could also use it to save a pallet if he decides to swing at you, as you will absorb a hit even when healthy
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
You seem to be the one that doesnt recognize the advantage of a swf. If you hook someone, the other three can communicate. Person A gets the hook, B and C work gens. That is immediate coordination.
---
In a non-swf situation, you dont necessarily know if anyone is going to the hook. If you've ever played this game, I'm sure you have experienced times when 2 people arrive at the hook simultaneously. All that time traversing the map is wasted for one of those survivors. Unless you want to argue that the double heal speed is worth one person working a gen . . .
---
Of course, this whole situation ignores the fact that swf can tell their teammates where the killer is, where they are, where a nearly completed gen is at, where a killer totem is at . . .
---
It's not a hard concept to grasp.  Seems odd you are insulting the intelligence of u/VenusInsideUranus.
---
I could see that one being very good too. Thinking about whispers though, I could see it being very useful in freddy's weakest point, EGC. I almost exclusively 3K as freddy because of how weak he is once the gems are gone after closing the hatch
---
Im not red rank but my survivor queue time is usually about a minute and killer takes 5-10 so yeah...
---
Apparently you‚Äôve never played against a good nurse
---
I've been hitting 100% greats through ruin recently, At one point i hit like 8 and finished it as a spirit came around the corner. 
---
She D/C'd immediately
---
I'd say trapper is worse, especially if you pre-emptively set up your traps.
---
Wraith is good for learning how to track and win normal chases, so I'd reccomend him.
---
Ok

Thanks! its looking great
---
Sure mate. Nothing pleases me more than seeing amazing Huntress shots.
---
" Structual perfection makes screams 45% louder, not hinder, so its just like an upgraded sloppy butcher "  
---
So what the perk does as written is apply like a 5% movement speed debuff on strike and gives you only 5% less injured sound volume than stridor.  
---
Even with just a weak hindered effect it would still be busted strong on killers like The Huntress or the Spirit.
---
What a gamer you are
---
those texture seems tho....
---
hatch doesn‚Äôt spawn at 5 gens unless you killed 3 survivors so nothing to complain about, i smell üß¢
---
But that‚Äôs the things people highly doubt they‚Äôll do either of those things, especially the framerate
---
Depends on if it's a safe pallet or not. There's a lot of pallets you can outright ignore or mind game, especially on maps like Hawkins.
---
Now, if you're running Enduring and Spirit Fury, then by all means, pepega that shit all day fam.
---
Hell no lol
---
I rather have this then pennywise or pinhead. Finally, someone wanting a popular killer that isn't bland
---
That's sadly true
---
Shame my capture didn't get the early game. 4 gens were gone like nothing. Thought it was 100% a 4 man escape
---
Sexist misogynistic female woman spreading
---
The problem is that if you need 4 kills for the archive challenge. Or for a trophy/achievement. It might not 'matter' but it does matter then. It's all well and good saying it doesn't matter but if I have to waste more time just to get that trophy/achievement/challenge simply because a survivor happened to accidentally stumble across their undeserved saving grace, it's not really fair. 
---
I do agree though that I do like the idea of the EGC, I don't want to go back to old hatch stand-offs. But there should be a compromise between hatch stand-offs and survivors ALWAYS being able to escape no matter how poorly they did.
---
Flashlight tbagger and mori ritual, perfect combo to end a game
---
Fire up OP plz nerf
---
Honestly I don't mind her gameplay at all as a Survivor ( though having a healing daily and getting 4 plagues in a row is the only time I've killed myself on hook), I just don't want to hear someone vomiting for 12-20 minutes at a time.
---
I usually watch streamers when eating and I just skip any video with her in it.
---
The pallets are fun, but if they're in the dream world, they're not looping you more than once If you have dream snares.
---
Yeah this needs to be fixed. Just had this happen the other day against a demogorgon. He just stood still and could see both gates. I had plunderers and there were no keys, i hadn't been hooked yet either, just a poor solo survivor who had a bad team. The killer already had a method to teleport to the gates but nope had to let him be able to stand there too. Conversely, I played a game as infinite t3 myers and had a situation where I could stand and watch both gates. Saw the last survivor and just let him go. Sent him a gg and told him It was bs he couldnt do anything.

OP said that either he‚Äôll either have Jigsaw Box type setups or that you can‚Äôt get rid of the facehuggers, but have to suppress them as the game goes on.
---
Wow I bet you‚Äôre fun at parties
---
*oinks in no regrets*
---
I used those yesterday. Dude, the logwood dye literally just adds like 3 dark spots on the trap and gives like 1% darkness from the tar bottle. That's it. Rather take an common trapper sack with me.
---
OP said that he wants a Jigsaw Box interaction to remove them.
---
Hes still pretty good without. You just have to use more guesswork on the gens to go to. Or use surveillance or discordance or something.
---
Except a skilled player is good no matter what killer they choose, as evidenced by the chart.  You're looking at a ~70% kill rate average across all killers at high rank.
---
Again, the smallest subset of players doesn't tell you anything about balance just because they're the best.  Unless the game is balanced specifically with red ranks in mind, you're not getting any useful information out of it.
---
Pig is a good killer.
---
Nah bro
---
I‚Äòm not a big fan of crossplay consoles and pc is a good idea either. But cross Progression is something I‚Äôm waiting for :D
---
It was condescending to equate my actions with a ‚Äúyoung person‚Äôs‚Äù. I‚Äôm 30. My bad.
---
Fixated, Deliverance, Hex: The third seal, Tinkerer
---
Trophies or achievements are whatever are irrelevant and should never be factored into balance. I mean people say ranks are meaningless but nothing is more meaningless than those stupid things.
---
I think 3 gens is a good area because that survivor could have done both gens and gotten an unhook so the hatch would still be semi deserving. It wont always work that way but its probably better than the current system
---
Regarding your last point, I really think 800 points per gen completed while you are alive + maybe 2K for gate escape, 4K for hatch escape would be nice for the survival category. It's so stupid to get like 200 points in a category because you died in a 10 minute game to NOED as you ran for the gate.
---
I love doing that on that map lol
---
Lol, there's another comment in this thread suggesting that survivors should die way more often and should give more BP to compensate, and that had like 8 upvotes.
---
It's pretty easy to see which way this sub leans when suggesting the game gets balanced to 50/50 is met with downvotes, and suggesting the game to be completely mismatched is upvotes as long as it's the killers who get power.
---
I mostly mean because I need so many blood points that I don‚Äôt like playing ones without bbq (consistently, I still have fun with random killers too)
---
You kind of inferred it.
---
Now this looks like a hook for me, 
---
so everybody,
---
 stop farming me.
---
No. Honestly she'll still be annoying and have little to no counter play. Shes just losing the more annoying addons thankfully
---
No but ... i wish
---
I've played for about 2 months and I didn't even NOTICE half of the icons and shit that appear or activate or gray out during play until I did a SWF round and got an explanation.
---
There is a serious lack of tutorial knowledge regarding all of this.
---
Omg, this. I swear the last 20 games I have played I have survivors doing unhooks like 1 second after someone is hooked. The killer has barely even turned away. Wth is going on?
---
Whether it's unsafe or not has more to do with whether or not you want to break it. You always want the survivor to drop the pallet, as fast as possible, and the way you do that is by not respecting pallets and eating stuns.
---
Sure, if you're going to pepper in some pallet respect there are better pallets than others for it, but pallet respect is like a seasoning.
---
I usually make some sound effects when I'm going for a really greedy lunge to try to "give me some extra distance" like HU AHHHH
---
Ah yes, Scary Terry's favorite, scary cherry
---
Maybe it's the killers who aren't good enough at the game?
---
I see plenty of streamers do fine at red ranks as killers, but then mediocre Reddit killer mains hit red ranks because it's automatic and start complaining about how they can't keep up.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e21gjk/when_ranking_up_a_new_killer_do_you_just_deal/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Not really, It's just that players will be able to play against her now rather than playing the losing game of Rock-paper-you're down, She'll have to earn her hits and plays instead of literally standing still in front and giving no information whatsoever while gaining all of the information. She can't bump players on gens to see where we are for a gen grab nor can she silently approach the survivors with no information being given. Players can react when she stands at a window as she has an animation now and lastly you can walk through her for a juke, even if the sound will totally give you away unless they were smart enough to remove it during phasing
---
This is correct. If you‚Äôre playing the game in English, you can get it to about the first E in ‚ÄúESCAPE‚Äù before the first lamp illuminates
---
Ive seen that happen more and more. 
---
Depends on how you feel about random chance being fair or not. In poker, you play the hands your played, fair or not....
---
Survivors also gain some counterplay for her with this update.
---
So what did you think happened when you went straight from healthy to dying state?
---
&gt; There is a serious lack of tutorial knowledge regarding all of this.
---
no argument there in general, but the tutorials do talk about being exposed
---
It‚Äôs like that recent video of Otz taking down a Quentin with Billy‚Äôs chainsaw sprint backwards and around a corner.

[Ps4 huntress main] ah I see you're a man of culture as well.

Not a problem.

Its like the new spirit the the oni is the new hillbilly. But he will be like a michael with spirit.
---
Is that frog pooping
---
As a low rank killer (Thanks to being a survivor main) it makes my day when survivors try to BM me at pallets only for it to snowball into a 4K.  
---
Did you expect this was going to be an easy game? Did you not see your teammate get downed in 20 seconds before I came for you? DO YOU NOT REALIZE WHAT HUNTRESS DOES AT PALLETS?
---
Also people that were exclusively using omega blink builds and the likes. Coming from that will make you a worse Nurse, I imagine, because your max range intuition is skewed.
---
ClEAnSe ToTeMs, like the perk doesn‚Äôt fucking carry baby killers like you.
---
An older clip when I wanted to experiment with a basement build on Ghost Face. Turns out survivors got the memo and wanted to race to see who could die first in my dungeon.
---
*Head on has entered the chat.
---
Sprint Burst is still an exhaustion perk. Meaning its still a get our of jail for free card.
---
It's great if you are often punished for being in a deadzone, or want to work on a gen close to the killer.
---
December 3rd
---
Then if you're building for endgame use blood warden, best for last, play with your food, fire up, remember me, or any other endgame perk rather than trying to hold off on endgame as well as planning for it. Like if you want to stop gens run ruin, thanataphobia, and pop goes the weasel or something, it'll always be way stronger to focus your build than try to plan for everything.
---
December 3rd.
---
üòÇ I'm hurt
---
i was gunning for that honestly. I wanted to bring back mechanics that are solid in DBD already, but give them a new twist, so that people can have different experiences with the same mechanic skill, not having to learn tons of new stuff to deal with a killer.
---
Is this so meta that the lack of a joke is the joke?
---
Thx
---
Yea it is something like that. I think many players are just new. They have no good understanding of the game yet. All they know is you have to kill the survivors/escape the killer. They know the basic perks/killer skills and thats it/ You have to play for a while to get the idea on both sides how the game actually works... It is way more complex
---
That‚Äôs such a cool story to have, I like it. The ending does seem a bit abrupt. Kinda feels ‚ÄúRandom Entity OUT OF NOWHERE!‚Äù and just take a hard right turn (pun intended) into entering the fog. I mean having a vague-ish story means when the archive comes out for her 245 years down the line, we will get more detail.

Cool ass artwork tho.

4K at all cost? I never even slug for hatch, I couldn‚Äôt give a fuck about 4ks lmao. If you think the above situation that I mentioned is fair and balanced for the killer then you probably don‚Äôt play killer. 
---
Who cares if 3 people escape when 4 should have died as long as the killer gets a pip he can‚Äôt complain! The level of survivor entitlement here is astounding lmao
---
If I die but my 3 teammates excape I think, "damn i died but at least the Team won." and if im the only one who escapes I think "Damn the team lost but at least I escaped" 
---
So no its not individually especially if you play swf.
---
What do u mean?
---
Unfortunately though I did try to go that route, for some reason I could only find political figures and parodies of female celebrities, but most of these masks, while being not only hard to find, where often exaggerated ( big lips, smiles, etc ) and had sculpted hair instead of wafts. 
---
but while I was searching I came across these types of skin tight, foam latex masks people used for cross dressing, and they were exactly what I was looking for, no big teeth-showing smiles and they could have their own hair added on! The only downfall is that they are HELLA expensive, and my bald one from ebay not only came from Germany but cost me almost 140$!
---
Late to the party, but I just want to say i think SWF defeats the purpose of the game.
---
Ouch, I feel stupid. Thanks for pointing that out.
---
Are you Hand Over the Boops? :O
---
You use your mouse not keys
---
character order
---
I've been playing since launch u baby, the term was born to define immersive clauds but gained actual meaning when people started using the brown mimetic outfit (or the green shirt for autoheaven/yamaoka, some even use blue for mcmillans). I'm chill af but u need to get ur facts right.
---
your just completely wrong, they said if they had it already, they will keep it. No future bloodwebs will contain it though.
---
You are correct. They were pratically scaring me crawling out of the walls to get into the basement
---
That‚Äôs really interesting, thanks for sharing. I think you absolutely nailed the look.
---
"que"
---
I see no issues
---
hes literally free man, just put in the BP.
---
???
---
we literally had him free first tf
---
Or is the lack of the joke being the joke secretly a commentary on the lack of a joke being meta?
---
I hate when someone rescuing me has a stroke.
---
They really need to limit the amount of game stalling perks you can equip at the same time. This type of build is annoying on any killer tbh.
---
[Some concept art to go along](https://i.imgur.com/5kuMjPQ.jpg)
---
Omg I love the slow sprint, I think I know what meme build I‚Äôm going to try when I get home.
---
Not a problem! I love explaining how this mask came to be, especially since I've been working on her concept for almost a year and had one failed attempt before her -- it's been wild but despite the fact that she needs a new paintjob and a velcro strap on the back of the neck she is done, and has gotten more praise than i ever expected!
---
thank you so much!
---
You booped the air above her
---
Well i dont have that right now sadly, but i think we all know what Pinhead looks like
---
I don‚Äôt think it was beads there was a heartbeat
---
would you rather sit there for an hour waiting for a game? its the players there isnt enough your rank trying to play right then
---
lmao xD
---
You have urban evasion and you‚Äôre calling HIM a baby Freddy lmao
---
Check Etsy. Lots and lots of good stuff!

---
yea!!
---
I fucking loathe NOED, but I actually agree with this. If Survivors had a totem counter and knew NOED was a given, rather than maybe a 1-in-10 chance, so that cleansing totems was *actually a secondary objective* rather than a crap shoot more likely to waste your time than save you, it would be a lot better.
---
Oh, I agree. I worded my explaination a little badly so let me try again.
---
Say someone played things like Wraith, Doctor, and Clown. They climb up to purple or even red ranks, and realise that low tier killers like the ones they're used to are a lot harder to work with, and so decide to "upgrade" to a killer that's perceived as higher tier, now they're up against red rank survivors.
---
So they pick up Nurse, whilst in red ranks, and because she plays SO much differently to all the others, they do TERRIBLY, and either give up, or keep at it till they learn it and become the 1 in 10 god nurses that you can't do anything against.
---
Whereas Spirit or Freddy only have 3-4 games where you learn them before you can at least play them to a minimum standard, and only improve from there.
---
And sold at your local Target!
---
I can uderstand Hag but why Demogorgon? Demo is quite weak...
---
i personally think that being able to trap a location that the survivor can vault into and insta get trapped is bull, but thats a trapper issue
---
I don‚Äôt like the perks but other than that looks great
---
I think if you play him right he‚Äôs not only incredibly powerful but frickin scary
---
that‚Äôs probably in part to him working with the cia
---
No, it‚Äôs pretty useless right now. And incredibly useless for SWF since they can just verbally communicate with one another
---
WRRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYY
---
also the little chances to loop a Freddy
---
Is that why I‚Äôve got 10 replies? You are an idiot for being a hypocrite right there. Nice try though.üòÇ
---
solo queues become killer mains
---
This is hard for bhvr as alot of people play swf so a nerf to it might kill them off.
---
I think is is the DBD version of Loss
---
I mean I didn't even smirk, let alone have a sensible chuckle.
---
Exactly this. The best thing BHVR could do is literally enable in game chat and balance the game around the fact.
---
Right now they balance the game as though survivors can‚Äôt communicate when 90% of them do.
---
Most of my solo queue survivor games end up with somebody sending me a party chat invitation.
---
Just because the actor agrees doesn‚Äôt mean it can happen. If they created a new character called Kyle Gallner then sure but they didn‚Äôt. If they want to change Quentin Smith, they still have to get license holder approval
---
i worry that it would fragment the userbase too much. When i queue as killer, it takes way too long to get a match as it is
---
Don't say that. Don't ruin this for me
---
Haha, made me think of that scene in Monty Python and The Holy Grail where Lancelot is running and running but never gets closer to the camera
---
This whole match had me in tears, it just gets better and better
---
Considering how much of the game that I was aware of that I had no knowledge of, I didn't know what to think. I assumed that I just was bad at the game.
---
I knew that I didn't have perfect knowledge of the systems. There's a lot going on, and as a baby survivor I was still in the "horror mode" just trying to not get spooked - ain't got no time for flashing icons and shit.
---
See now a 4 panel of that I could get behind.  Oni rushes into lerys, the nurse is behind the counter, herman looking sad with a clip board, nerfed spirit in the bed, etc
---
Y E S
---
&gt;Currently, most games seems to be decided within the first few minutes  of the game and it's just a steamroll from there from either side.
---
OMG, so much this. Whether I'm playing Killer or Survivor, I often know 2-3 minutes into a 10-15 minute game how it will turn out. After that, the rest of the game isn't fun, because I already know the outcome.
---
Are you even reading what he says?
---
Oh absolutely, the Steve unhooks you to the ground so that he may A S C E N D.
---
He kinda vibing tho ü§≠ü§≠üòØüòâüòç
---
I wouldve loved that helmet in the cosmetic or any of them coming out actually
---
That's hot
---
THIS!!!!!!!!!
---
I would, most of my favorite outfits are the more regular ones. Like Jake‚Äôs in the rift or Nancy‚Äôs last one
---
It‚Äôs just another thing survivors can‚Äôt counter.
---
You didn‚Äôt mention it but what about games where the killer slugs the 2nd to last person cause he is afraid of a hatch game? 
---
Another scenario where you can‚Äôt do shit unless you run the perks no one actually runs.
---
Below and above certain ranks, this is essentially what we already have. It's a grab bag of good/bad killers and good/bad survivors, since you can easily see +/- 6 ranks on everybody. It takes time and effort to get above that, and if you're below that you're either not playing, new, or trying to stay very low.
---
But the problem is that killers can shut the hatch immediately, survivors need to spend 30 seconds vulnerable while cleansing a totem. If they make it spawn in one of the unlit totems still left it would force survivors to go look for totems and do them before the match is done, giving the killer more time to kill.
---
&gt;like a nerf  
---
Is this a bait comment?
---
There's KYF, and although it's not exactly the same, I'm sure you can find people to play KYF with on the DbD discord server.
---
It‚Äôs certainly new, but there are issues with that. 
---
For starters, it‚Äôs a survivor perk, meaning they can rob the killer of.. well, playing killer. Not to mention, once it happens, that‚Äôs it. The killer is stuck playing a role they didn‚Äôt want to play. 
---
As well as most solo survivors who didn‚Äôt run this perk end up having to deal with SWF‚Äôs farming bloodpoints after switching roles with the killer. 
---
This wouldn‚Äôt work as a perk, as it would leave both sides unhappy. 
---
However, as a gamemode, this would be fun as hell. A random survivor become a killer after either a certain amount of time, or after doing a cerain thing, like stunning the killer 5 times. Of course, some things would have to be changed, but not a bad basis for an idea!
---
You used to be able to, now no one can get away cause the end game collapse is completely one sided.
---
Agreed. I was weirdly getting a lot of basement games at the time and I figured I'd screw around a bit outside my usual. Monstrous didn't do much and I'd love to drop it for Agitation (I just got the teachable after leveling up trapper during the Rift) and just take Iron Grasp out and sub in something more fun
---
Agreed that ghostface isn't best for basement but it does seem to catch survivors off guard.
---
That's how he is in the movies. He mostly teleports around until he gets mad then he starts breaking stuff. The best time they show it is the beginning of Jason X. He teleports outside of the room they had him chained up in. He is in the room that only has one door. The girl runs out of the door and Jason is already in the hall lol.
---
I agree, but I'm just saying for the sake of DLC and advertisement, you wouldn't want something super plain unless it helped you camouflage
---
Use steam to verify your game files.
---
This has happened a few times (rank 5/6 on PC atm if that matters), but I am probably the exception to the rule. 1-2 times I've crawled to the hatch even after the killer has slugged everyone.
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt do it when I play ghost face. It wastes so much damn time and you have to commit to the knock down. If you get a survivor who can loop well you‚Äôre basically fucked.
---
You can just enjoy them all?
---
Who said he stuggles there , you haven‚Äôt seen how food he does because of unsafe pallets
---
I play both sides 50/50 and I‚Äôm a legacy 3 Claudette. If you believe that NOED is a balanced and fair perk then you‚Äôre out of your mind. Same with DS in a SWF. Same with Dead Hard. It‚Äôs pretty bold of you to assume how good I am at the game when I‚Äôd bet money I‚Äôm better than you.
---
She‚Äôs a lil cutie that one, the Claudette archive story entries have made me want to spare every Claud I find :(
---
So just because billy happens to do it better than most, he deserves a nerf? There will always be a strongest. Billy just happens to be one of the strongest. If you nerf Billy, you will just move on to whoever the next strongest killer will be. Then they will get nerf and the cycle will repeat.
---
I do like wraith's addons. Most of them are at least fun to play around with. I even use his addon that gives him a terror radius while cloaked to some success. It's a fun mindgame when combined with the shadow addon. Everyone should have the variety that wraith has. Brown addons are unique. Most are useable. Blink is pretty bad but can the time it reduces is pretty large.
---
It's only the 2nd "issue," so we should give it some time at least
---
i‚Äôm a great survivor lol, I just know a crutch and unfair perk when I see one
---
Triple the vision means triple the chance of spotting the killer before they sneak up on you!!
---
Defintely level bubba first for BBQ. Just play legion amd doctor, then dump the BP into Bubba.
---
If you have the teachables for it, I run BBQ, Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel and then Discordance.  I'll swap discordance out for franklins if I see 3+ items and sometimes I'll drop discordance for make your choice if I'm feeling spicy.
---
The dead by daylight wiki has all the lore scattered around it‚Äôs pages.
---
Imagine being the last survivor not downed and all you see is your entire team just dieing at the same time.
---
I don‚Äôt play Legion and I can tell you SWF IS overpowered.
---
They have a huge advantage because the game is balanced around the idea the survivors cannot communicate outside of perks.
---
The very essence of SWF party chat is what makes them OP. The fact they can verbally communicate breaks the way the game is intended and balanced around playing.
---
I‚Äôve said it a hundred times.
---
BHVR needs to enable in game chat and balance the game a around that. That‚Äôs the first step to a proper balance.
---
Freddy uses his dream projection to cut in line while Nurse waits for her blink to recover. Strange days, indeed.
---
It was too strong on other maps too.
---
Phil was tricked into killing, and killed his boss when he found out right?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm sure him knowing there was no counter play was real fun and engaging..
---
Can loop you all game, but the minute you are the last person and hatch is closed GG cause there isn‚Äôt anything you can do and I don‚Äôt think anyone but sweaty killer mains find that guarantee 4K fun.
---
Yeah, but they all die out slowly or pretty quick while DBD continues to stand tall
---
So brave :O
---
Other way around. The skill floor is the level at which you can do reasonably well with a character. Low = easier.
---
They most definitely don‚Äôt.
---
Thanks.
---
This uh... this is a joke right?
---
I wonder how much swaps. Can I be Dwight with a big knife?
---
Maybe all the nurses you‚Äôve played have been bad but a good nurse is hell for survivors
---
this is so stupidly good lol
---
Recovery speed as in recovering from stuns? Even past that, it's a horrible idea, because either you will never get a down, or you're terribly overpowered like you had an old-school ebony mori
---
Survivors would literally be faster than you...
---
This is a joke right?
---
People wouldn‚Äôt use it. They‚Äôd just invite people to a party chat like they already do so they don‚Äôt have to worry about range.
---
Yeah, np. Don‚Äôt let others discourage you from sharing your ideas.
---
Nothing you mentioned is bullshit but completely fair and balanced, being able to just trap the only way out especially if it‚Äôs 1 person left if the cheapest shit possible.
---
Fair enough, thanks.
---
Nah, good as is.
---
I'm not really concerned with NOED. At least you have to do SOMETHING. I'm more concerned with survivors being able to do literally nothing but escape anyway.
---
This was a sad moment not gonna lie, I felt real bad
---
Its not like Billy guys its like bubba with a sprint lol
---
Gotta wait for that sick Doctor/Feng archive eventually.
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
Either it'd be almost worthless on certain killers, or OP as HELL on stealth killers.
---
So yeah possibly a joke
---
No, what is the build?
---
Either this dude is completely serious or is a top fucking tier shitposter
---
All of that work just to sneakily try to counter the new survivor pallet reset and our last and only fun thing do to. Hook blocking. So yes it sounds like it will balance the game. Yes it sounds good. No I dont want it I like trolling.
---
Don't worry, I've been playing this game for awhile now and anything killers don't like gets nerfed. Now thst instaheals have been nerfed its only a matter of time until keys do as well! What I think will happen to keys is that it can still open the hatch, but only for the 1 survivor using the key. I play survivor mostly and the idea of this nerf actually infuriates me but the track record says its only a matter of time so I've already accepted everything I love in this game is bound to be destroyed
---
The best concept for Alien I‚Äôve ever seen. But i just don‚Äôt see him fitting in this game well, he‚Äôd just stick out like a sore thumb. But if they do add him, they should base it of this
---
I mean... there was that video series of an optimal 4 man SWF with no perks absolutely crushing Rank 1 killers with perks. So... 4 man SWF without meta perks is extremely viable
---
Dude I‚Äôll just take an auto safety pip for playing SWF. Anything is better than nothing
---
It's their quality instead of good quality
---
The other big mindblower is that most people don't realize you can easily find generators in indoor maps by tracking flickering lights. Maps like Lery's and Hawkin's Lab help you find them easier by using the environment.
---
U can still max it and run it on someone else #teachables.
---
Okay, so now me and my friends just DC so someone gets hatch....
---
Cause that‚Äôs the only counter play we have to a killer slugging and desperately not wanting anyone to get away. Like they didn‚Äôt just kill 3 people..
---
Doesnt rank not matter?
---
But you can mori.
---
Yes whenever she breathes the fires a shot
---
Just purity. But maybe you need a hook stack token or two or three.
---
Bla Bla Bla survivor entitlement Bla Bla bla! You may not admit that you want to do 4 kill at all cost but at least you accepted the fact that if you pip you are happy! With the key you can do pip, with mor√¨ no! I have finished your honor!
---
That way we keep body blocks. But not forever.
---
The reason standing still worked without it is because you don‚Äôt hear her phasing sound when within the husk‚Äôs terror radius, which means that they don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre using your power or not even without prayer beads.  Going to be the same still, no real indication (yes the shards glow on some skins but only some, and it‚Äôs extremely hard to see at that) whether she‚Äôs using it when you‚Äôre near her.
---
#postsfromyellowranks
---
It does say if you uncheck the crossplay, you will only be matched with other people who have unchecked crossplay, im sure most people do not, try making a ticket with BHVR to check it again, you should be able to, i can
---
You should be at a disadvantage. You shouldn't have a 0% chance at winning. Sure, the killer killed everybody and probably deserves the 4k, but you also survived the whole game. Do you not deserve a chance? The issue is that if the killer has mobility or whispers, or RNG fucks you, you literally have no chance. There's no skill involved for either party.
---
I like Hell on Earth. I don't like pleasure and pain. It would need to be an obsession only perk not a hex. As fast as the gens get done now a swf team would find the hex and just wait to destroy it when the hex takes effect on the slowing part. At that point the damage is already done and most gens would be about done.
---
Well that's what im saying. Only certain killers have a huge advantage with gates being so close together. My point was no matter the distance, Billy can always get from one to another in a matter of seconds. So can nurse.
---
*gets exposed*
---
what do you mean ?
---
This is how far we came
---
... 80-90% of the games I play are as survivor, but ok. Guess I can't dislike a mechanic if it benefits me?
---
You see a cursed image, I see an inspiring success story
---
The red stain looks like a puddle of blood under your character.
---
They should always spawn opposite of each other.
---
I don‚Äôt care what killer you play, you have to make the smart choice it have enough info to guess where they are correctly.
---
If you fail and still get to get a kill cause they are so close how is that fair to the survivor who outplayed you?
---
He's really not
---
Do you mind if I use that joke and give you credit?  It feels too good to pass up.
---
Real talk, when are we getting a non-humanoid killer?
---
He is the one named Michael Moon!
---
I'd agree that he's way more balanced now.
---
My only complaint is his gen teleport, which I think is a little unfair, but that's just my opinion.
---
Yeah I figured he somehow gets repaired or another IG droid shows up later on. MAYBE if we're lucky, a recurring villain along with his manufacturer? That's one thing that makes shows good is a dedicated villain.
---
This is irrelevant. Regardless of what you call it, its been a problem for years, and its completely unacceptable in a multiplayer game like this. The devs have demonstrated that they're just going to milk this game for all its worth with dlc and microtransactions. If they gave a fuck about the game they'd have fixed things like latency years ago.
---
U right
---
Sounds funny as hell. If only alt game modes were a thing
---
WOW things are even worse now
---
your asking for survivors to have 20 perks vs a killers 5. Reask yourself that question with that in mind.
---
You don't even have to give me credit, I'm not drawing comics.
---
Other than the chance from doing the gens as a team, the chance of finding hatch first, and the chance of the exit gates if hatch was far away. The killer is doing well enough to be winning they should have the advantage.
---
idk people always bring up the lore and it makes me sad
---
Exactly, yet I was downvoted for saying this tactic can still be done. Sad times
---
As much as I don‚Äôt like where Nurse stands rn. She‚Äôs not technically the weakest killer. 
---
I mostly look at red rank stats since I don‚Äôt think brown ranks should count. According to the red rank stats Nurse is statistically the 3rd worst killer in the game rn
---
For how shitty everyone says this game is, it actually does a good job as far as 4v1 games go. It's very unique. A lot of others have failed where dbd has succeeded. Cheers!
---
The only reason they can close it in the first place is a bunch of killer mains were crying they couldn‚Äôt get a 4K cause to many that‚Äôs viewed as a win instead of actually having fun or just getting a lot of points.
---
You gotta flex tho
---
B U B B A
---
The whole point of the game is that it is an asymmetrical horror game at its core. Enabling voice chat would eliminate the horror aspect of it. 
---
The fact that it‚Äôs asymmetrical with a variety of player skill levels, the game will never be fully balanced. If you add voice comms red rank survivors will shit on killers and lead to 20 minute queue time for survivors in those ranks because no one will play killer. 
---
And killers destroy above purple ranks because survivors don‚Äôt know how to path or loop. So if you buff killers to compensate for the voice chat, no one will want to play survivor in yellow rank. 
---
Behavior is balancing maps to help red rank killers by eliminating very unsafe loops, and they are buffing perks like kindred to close the SWF and solo gap. Everyone wants these big changes like voice comms but doesn‚Äôt think how it will affect the game as a whole.
---
What the fuck lmao
---
then we will have a real balance problem then
---
He'll grow.
---
true, but isn't it currently 20 v 4 ?
---
I do this as a survivor too and sometimes get the same result lol. I'm a killer main and will show Mercy to ones that do this or shake back and forth saying no lol.
---
But you'll literally never be able to catch them unless you're using a stealth killer cause you have to get within striking distance, with a terror radius. If you're not in that distance when they see you you don't get the hit
---
Spirit phase body collision may be getting removed (listed in PTR changes)
---
No it‚Äôs 16 v 4
---
4x4=20 Pepega.
---
I knew this sub wasn‚Äòt real and i still clicked.
---
Same. Hag on the saw map is amazing. Setting traps on every stair case and under every opening... hard to keep 10 down simultaneously
---
michael myers theme song 10 hour version
---
Yea, idk what it was, but this didn't feel very well written, perhaps because it just describes her life events? they should have focused on the race she dissapeared, then fill inn backstory with tomes at a later date. IMO.
---
what are we trying to force? not to mention the fact that straight-ness is normalized in DBD
---
I did I have bond
---
Lol, this is literally Tru3‚Äôs latest wraith video
---
The amount of people who don‚Äôt know how to interpret/read statistics, or simply choose not to, is outstanding.
---
‚Äúwell guys nurse is the worst killer, game is killer sided, and Freddy&gt;spirit‚Äù
---
she isnt getting nerfed, her addons are. and not even all of them. only OP prayer beads and then some about time
---
I mean yall gonna use the same builds just with one other perk
---
I've noticed that even if the doors arent on the same wall, usually theyre close enough together to just stay in one area with minimal travel time
---
I don‚Äôt disagree, but if ppl couldn‚Äôt do that it‚Äôd kill the game. And plenty of times I‚Äôve gone against a SWF it‚Äôs 1 red rank like me and 3 rank 15s. So it kind of goes in my favor. I just hate the super sweaty SWF groups with keys, maps, BNPs, etc.
---
So give me a free win based on luck as a survivor is what I'm hearing.
---
No. If you don't want a disadvantage for failure then you don't get to trade it for an advantage.
---
A minimum and maximum spawn distance is the closest to even playing field you're going to get.
---
As I said before they spawn too far away it's too easy for the survivors
---
Even though there are straight relationships/coding in DBD
---
He killed himself on second hook lol.
---
My time has come...
---
They already have 4 times as many perks though. Not sure what the issue is there.
---
How so?
---
I mean as it is it almost feels like I only get 3 perk slots as killer unless I'm prepared to really sweat.  
---
Mandatory ruin feels bad man.
---
Sure, but then it could also open up possibilities for more variety too.
---
The survivor pretty much loss at this point the odds should be against them.
---
Yesterday i played wraith for daily
---
The only thing I had to do was climbing the hill and i was able to watch the both door in the same time. And my noed hex was between the doors
---
 Wtf, how are you supposed to have any chance against somethint like that??
---
This is absolutely bullshit
---
I let them go in the end
---
Pretty sure I didn't say that
---
I think I‚Äôm one of the few people who just stands up when playing games lol
---
Or you could just easily make them drop that flashlight with franklin's and still have 3 other perks to play around with but you do you Boo Boo.
---
I first thought gg meant "git gud" and thought everyone was just an asshole
---
Fear not I will send a telegram.
---
or rancor
---
I like her lore, but idk, it feels kinda forced? She is pretty frikin' cool but, idk man.
---
Regardless, I like her perks and design.
---
Yea I main hag and some of the really large maps are impossible if you have survs with urban evasion crouching through every doorway pallet and gen. I can have all my traps set and sometimes one will go off but I'm just too far to teleport to it
---
I cant believe you said bamboozle instead of pgtw when 9/10 killers run pgtw now. And yeah survivors havent had a great perk in awhile most ppl use perks from over a year ago
---
Joey please put shitpost on your ideas
---
Thats so bs, only one survivor can get hatch with 5 gens left.
---
How long have you been playing this game
---
Yes? And it's bullshit that a survivor can escape when they've done 0 percent of their objective.
---
This happened to me, but my friends finished the last gen while I was the obsession being chased. The killer had Rancor.
---
still keeping 4x but increasing the amount is huge and im surpised you need an explanation. At best you get a good combo as killer. Say ghostfaces build but throw in BBQ
---
It's not cross play with console, it's cross play with google store or something like that.
---
Enjoy getting banned for dcing
---
As killer if you fail from stopping gens then you can get NOED as a crutch, explain that
---
I can't help but want to hit Scoops Ahoy Steve everytime
---
Really? I thought it was way worse on Friday. I‚Äôm talking about with other survivors. Especially the team killing. That game was nothing but toxic imo. lol at least that game took out most of the ways to kill each other eventually but I still have to be wary of people driving cars. Never know when they will try to drive over you so sometimes I‚Äôll watching out for Jason and cars on the roads. Lol
---
You definitely aren‚Äôt wrong. Voice chat WILL and HAS taken the horror aspect of the game, it‚Äôs also taken the fun out for the opposite side.
---
The problem with the state of the game is that it is being balanced as though survivors can not communicate VIA voice comms. When in reality, it‚Äôs happening in more games than it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs very obvious to see when a group is SWF or in a party chat from when they aren‚Äôt. 
---
 I specifically hate reaching ranks 7 and lower because at that point it‚Äôs no longer an asymmetrical horror game, I am no longer a ‚Äúkiller‚Äù It‚Äôs game of cat and mouse. And more often than not, the mice are talking to one another, ones got object of obsession so he can relay information at all time.
---
When I play survivor and am in a waiting lobby, More often than not I get invited to a party chat.
---
Why? Because anybody with a mic and a brain knows the best odds of survival is to verbally communicate.
---
I‚Äôve met a lot of friends in DBD just simply because I was invited to a party chat in the pre-game lobby. It happens to me literally all the time.
---
People always complain about the lunges on the shorter killers.  THEY HAVE THE SAME REACH AS EVERYONE ELSE
---
If 0 generators were complete why do you deserve a chance?
---
Keys are a thing and noed isn't reliable
---
That's an assumption, and it's easily dismissed.
---
If a killer is over/under performing, they look into why.
---
If it's addons, they adjust the offending/weak addons with little change to how the killer plays. Like spirit, and doc, and hag. 
---
If it's power, they adjust the power in ways that hardly change how the killer plays, but buff/Nerf numbers where needed. Like wraith.
---
The logic they are using is simple: let the babies cry, and do nothing, and wait until the veterans start to complain. They learned from the Freddy Nerf.
---
That's not to say the Legion stuff is on the same level, because that power is really hard to adjust without it being oppressive.
---
Why should it be fair if the killer just outplayed your team and killed three people? It‚Äôs meant to be in favor of the killer if they outplayed the survivors.
---
And ghostface build is? I'm not sure what your standard ghostface build is.
---
I play on ps4 so I'm immune to this.
---
Maybe as an alternate game mode or something but otherwise this does not work as a perk what so ever.
---
Im gonna have to go and look at my perks because Unbreakable is not currently in my Kit but i should probably consider adding it.
---
It was to prevent game stall.  Theres clips of like hour long hatch standoffs.  Better for both sides
---
LMAO, meanwhile the Killer is standing there confused eating an orange
---
For killers and survivors, or just for survivors?
---
OP;

I am genuinely confused as to what you‚Äôre referring to. Hag‚Äôs kit is akin to trappers? She sets up a web and applies it, a good hag will find survivors falling exactly where she wanted them to. She has no need to camp, yes there are unfortunate games, but how does her not encourage camping? A killer will camp regardless of rank, Hag is not meant to be a chasing killer.
---
How did you create the perk icons and whatnot? Asking for my own project
---
The point is youre saying the ranks are meaningless because theyre chore driven and not skill driven, then in the same breath you say that the data needs to be based off a rank.  Which is flawed. So youre contradicting yourself. Surely, you meant fix the ranking system so that it is actually skill based and THEN get data from it. But thats not what you said and why your argument fails.
---
The longer a game goes, the fewer pallets there are, without pallets you will eventually get caught, unless they are a potatoe, and if they are a spud, then you probably already won and left.
---
Plenty of games don't have awful latency like this one does. The devs clearly just don't give a fuck. The dedicated servers are a joke too. They're buggier and have more lag then the game used to at times. Best case scenario the devs are just really fucking incompetent. 
---
Also acting like criticizing a game is bad is extremely stupid. If nobody complained about this game it would have died years ago.
---
Question for the OGs - didn‚Äôt there used to be 5 perks? I‚Äôve seen old streams where there‚Äôs 5 perks in a line, instead of the diamond shape we have with 4 today.
---
No, sorry :c I‚Äôm snot!
---
Yes.
---
Wrong, it's a suggestion.
---
Yeah, exactly! The stalker bit just felt a little too forced, I think her motorcycle part conveyed it well enough.
---
He killed not just the women and men but the children too
---
Many survivors will DC to rob the killer of points and emblems. Regardless if you‚Äôre running BBQ or not, you will still benefit from it.
---
B L A S P H E M Y
---
Holy crap this looks like it will work great with dark devotion / surveillance combo.
---
Survivors fail to realize how many pallets are on the map. If your teammates aren‚Äôt potato at doing gens with ruin up you can literally play safe with pallets and the killer will either break them all (causing them to lose and not get a kill) or to give up on you (cause gens get popped). Survivors forget that dying light needs at least 4 hooks to be the same slow down as thana. You can wake up to get rid of one of the add on slow downs and Freddy is only an M1 killer. Lmao forever Freddy is definitely escapable and not that strong unless your team are all potatoes
---
A year.
---
‚ÄúYes rank 3?‚Äù If you‚Äôre confused it‚Äôs because rank doesn‚Äôt really mean anything once you played the game enough. So saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm rank 3 and...‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really give any credibility in a lot of people‚Äôs eyes because there‚Äôs not much of a skill gap to get there. And It‚Äôs just hard to find someone who uses SB but doesn‚Äôt walk around like an immersed Claudette. If you don‚Äôt then I‚Äôm sorry I assumed such things. But 80% of people who do use it are generally trying to never be in a chase and urbanely evade everywhere.
---
it took me a while to realize it was me - the whole time I was watching this I was just like ‚Äúhuh, that looks like the Jane that I had on the same map! Oh, she ran behind the tires as well! Haha, I did the same thing as the pig...wait...‚Äù
---
fun fact: pig players are legally required to let everyone live once they get their snoots booped
---
I‚Äôm listening to all star and it suits it
---
Yeah, hopefully it gets better. If it doesn't, hope they have the sense to get rid of it, we already get rewards from the rift.
---
I think emblems would be a better way to rank killers.
---
Makes sense about the Nurse to be honest. She has the highest skill gap. Either you get 0 kills or a 4k and 70% of nurse players aren't masters.
---
Why can‚Äôt you use bond right?
---
Nice bait. What other strawman can you pull out of your ass?
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre getting butthurt over a meme

---
The assholes stand out. There are a lot of cool people playing this game in both roles, they are harder to notice because they are not trying to be noticed.
---
No, that‚Äôs my dad
---
This just happened to me twice in a row I lost my rank
---
and is this a serious post?? Cus otherwise you should know how utterly pointless this perk is. It hurts you wayy way way more then it will help. Yeah sure it's a Mori but survs move faster then you so ya can't even really catch them. And the only way to increase your movements speed really is to be forced to run furitive chase. Just run good perks and a Ebony and ur all good.
---
That was always the case but whatever
---
3 survivor games were awful, let's not bring those back
---
Hmmm sounds like an excuse to not answer the question because you know you don‚Äôt have a good answer.
---
Yeah, if it's not easily found shortly after it activates and you don't have at least two full health Survivors then there's no point wasting time on it.  It sucks but that's just the reality of it.
---
Same except for the rank.
---
MoM?
---
3 survivor games were better than cancelled games
---
[You speaking MAD FAX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIIEVk1WoZk)
---
I've made it to purple as surv and rank 1 as hag... I still dont know most of the addons by name and I am constantly looking up perks mention on this sub lmfao. Been playing over a year. Dont get me started with status effects. The only ones I really know are exposed and exhausted. Like, what's the difference between broken and mangled??
---
A trapper with these kinds of gates also sucks major booty
---
That chase perk is stupid since play with ur food is a thing
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure if you press pause during the game you can see other survivors‚Äô load out.
---
no because you actually have to work for Adrenaline, you‚Äôre not that braindead are you?
---
Another victim of dedicated servers.
---
should be like Freddy's wake up but takes longer depending on what stage the face hugger is in
---
Plus I can never find more then 2 gens as a survivor there
---
I see I triggered you thank you for them morning tears lmfao .
---
Another artwork of her that looks nothing like her. Looks more like Sombra from Overwatch if she had a ponytail.
---
For the record, Billy is one of my least favorite killers to go against.
---
It wouldnt be that extreme, I do think keys will be nerfed, probably to only let the 1 surv using it to go thru and then closing again. Think about every thing that killers have complained about, the latest change being instaheals and now balanced landing. I've seen complaints of keys a lot too. Just you wait and mark my words, keys will get nerfed and I will cry when they do
---
Undetectable and oblivious are 2 different things.  Undetectable means the killer has no TR and whatnot to anyone, but a survivor can be oblivious (think cleansing a demo portal, you can‚Äôt hear the TR, others can) which means that you are the only one affected. Nemesis makes the new obsession oblivious, rather than making the killer undetectable.
---
i think you mean more meta too people already dont run that much variety as it is currently
---
Windows store X steam store
---
Well, that's up to the Killer not to get baited so far from the gates that they're safe to open. It's an annoying standoff in that case.
---
That's absurd. That's not how the game works and they're not a "team" they're just on the same site.
---
This game can be 1v2v2 or 1v1v1v1v1 way more often than it's 1v4. In fact I've never had a "team" while playing solo and they're are always people trying to throw the game or sandbag it feels.
---
Killing them doesn't mean you played well against me. You don't deserve a 4k just because you hooked a couple other people. You deserve a 4k because you play well against all 4 survivors, not because it was handed to you.
---
Yeah, I don't really know how valuable these are across all platforms.
---
She eats the apples obviously
---
You arguments are hurrdurr you're a bad survivor, if ad hominem is your only counter point, no one is going to take you seriously.
---
IMO in any given video game where a character option is a high skill floor, high skill ceiling type deal that character should never have an above 50% "winrate" for a sample size other than truly dedicated players. Nurse SHOULD have sub 50% kill rates because if the entire killer populace is the sample size then it would make sense that some people wouldn't be good at her. If her kill rates are too high its indicative that shes too easy across the board.
---
kinda? he has more mobility with it but he has to charge it up by injuring survivors. It also has multihit which is fucking hilarious because it completely negates borrowed time
---
See that's the problem. Most survivors suck, HARD, and won't be able to last 10 seconds against a half decent killer.
---
GameS are determined before most of them start. Are at least 2 survivors braindead? Congratulations, you get a 4K. Are 2 of them incredibly smart? Maybe you'll get a kill. Right now, 85% of the match is determined by survivor skill. It should be 50%
---
the way I wish add-ons would be balanced is as such: 
---
brown add-ons through green add-ons should affect basic Killer powers stats, such as charge speed, cool down, range, etc.
---
purple add-ons should add an effect to the base power, like healing speed slow down, aura reading, or such.
---
Iridescent add-ons should fundamentally change the way the power works. I think the best example is Myers's Tombstone, instead of an instadown for 60 seconds, you can just straight up murder people.
---
I‚Äôm sorry I speak English. You just spoke gibberish lmao
---
And thanks for the fun match :)
---
The order you get them
---
 "I think his mate saw me."
---
This is very well done! Pretty good job so far. ;) Hope you find time to add the survivors. =)
---
With crossplay, you get matched quicker, with PS4 and XBox players.
---
In my oppinion, have it enabled because not only you find matches faster but also playing against worse players because of the unability of quick moves like 360s with the controller.
---
Also it‚Äôs a 4v1 not a 1v1 baby survivor
---
If the survivors are good yeah you usually are. But otherwise you're fine
---
No legion?
---
Adding just 1 perk could potential severely unbalance the game and create a wide variety of overpowered builds.
---
Remember me, NOED, Bloodwarden, bitter murmur &amp; Rancor would be pretty cool though.
---
I love your comics. They're super adorable and always show the more wholesome part of the game.
---
who's saying that?
---
That's exactly how I read it.
---
Some killers are slower/faster than other but all survivors are same speed. Differences in character sizes might change the speed perspective
---
All characters have differant speeds
---
Agreed. New nurse is still the best killer and a good nurse will wreck people.
---
It wasn‚Äôt fun and was unfair. Starting the game with one less gen did not make up for how unfair the match was.
---
look everyone has suffered this so in the meantime read or watch youtube or play killer because killer matchmaking is faster than survivor and in the future there will be crossplay which will make the matchmaking hopefully faster than before
---
If they weren‚Äôt toxic and just got screwed over by teammates, then usually give them the hatch or exit. 
---
Had one game where a random unhooked me while the killer was chasing them, the killer let me go but took down the other survivor. Sometimes you just have an unspoken bond lol
---
Same speed, same hitbox.  Males have a slightly larger frame, that's literally the only difference.
---
I realized I forgot to draw them a bit too late and I didn't have space to add them in anymore :(
---
Having played DBD on Xbox and PC, the only toxic DMs I get are on Xbox. Why are console players so toxic :(
---
Nice.
---
Try enabling crossplay, more players, faster matchmaking
---
I was thinking discordance.
---
Looping is not and has never been a mindgame.  It is a Scooby-Doo chase around a wall.  I know it‚Äôs the closest thing to fun a survivor has it is brain dead and boring.
---
You want to know my answer? No. I don't think killers should 4k every game and, believe it or not, I do want the game to be balanced; unlike you, who wants the last survivor to have a free hatch escape every game.
---
See how me answering your questions have gotten us nowhere, because your exagerations of my statement mean that the argument slows to a crawl? Having to deny dumbass hyperboles constantly is one of the reasons rules exist in actual debates.
---
Average waiting time is 30s-2mins
---
Project Resistance looks fun, that's coming up fairly soon. It's never gonna have the longevity of DbD though.
---
....except that is exactly what I said.
---
:weirdchamp:
---
why is it that other games with online multiplayer melee don't have these issues?
---
It's simultaneously frustrating while also exciting given that Piggy (who I main) might get similar quality add-ons, which would resolve basically all of my complaints about the cleverest girl.

He‚Äôs my most quotable YouTuber lol. KNACK 2 BAYBEEEEEEE
---
I think he specifically talking about survivors
---
Matchmaking is bad enough as is, the last thing we want is to split the community further. It would be horrible.
---
I‚Äôve had this as Myers before... and my stalk was 99‚Äôd üòà
---
Ah ok so i got confused, so hitting an oblivious survivor doesnt make your TR come back? I guess the question still stands
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what these stats say at all. It‚Äôs just showing that most people who play nurse probably aren‚Äôt that good with her, which makes sense since she‚Äôs one of the hardest killers to get good with.
---
Jane is never ok...
---
So now. Can u say tell me why u said Me to get a life when that kid is the one wrong and toxic here.
---
The FPS limitation console has compared to pc imo
---
Of course its weaker in lower ranks...
---
Yeah it‚Äôs probably this.  I know I‚Äôm not actually slower, but I still can‚Äôt stop myself from feeling slower with someone like David, which is why I tend to use the female survivors.  Same with a tall 115% killer vs a shorter/medium 115%, feels a bit slower sometimes.
---
:( But the one you have drown look mega cute! Great style.
---
No. They would not. Ever.
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
Well im not that good. I would more than likely use it like you said, pop up with Unbreakable, finish Gen, run toward exit and save peeps if im able but head for exit to open.
---
Though this is because of my skill, i could also try and distract the killer but i would end up being sacrificed rather than escape.
---
Sry, I can only provide the video without sound at the moment. Please try again later. 
---
I also work with links sent by PM
---
I haven‚Äôt changed my mind, you just kept replying after the conversation was over and continued editing
---
for me i press ready and 15 seconds pass and i am in a game 
---
what rank are you and how is your internet connection
---
I don‚Äôt see the issue with a 50/50. Open the door until right before the first red light, wait for them to patrol, then finish it. The spawning being too close too each other is the real issue. Other than that, I don‚Äôt have a problem with a 50/50 game.
---
Im not drinking that shit, just stick an IV in me and flow it through me.
---
Planning on it! ^^
---
Well its all opinion.
---
I would have been fine with leaving Spirit as she was and just changing prayer beads. For me Billy feels like the cheapest killer.
---
Calm down satan
---
I love how you focused on that one sentence of "How often are there actually toolboxes?" and not the actual point I made. One, I never said there were never toolboxes. The comment I replied to, you made it seem like a toolbox is the only reason to tunnel. Tell me a real reason.
---
Every time I try to talk about this i get dislike bombed somewhere in the thread like there was this killer/survivor main who said that I said something what I didn‚Äôt even say than I corrected him and now i got 3 downvotes on that comment. Like ffs this game has so many stupid people who can‚Äôt even read before they downvote and stupid people trying to make facts but fail terribly and everyone upvotes that.
---
You can, at least, look at the extremes and see that Clown performs bad on all platforms and Freddy performs very well on all platforms.
---
BaLaNcEd
---
My internet connection is fine I‚Äôve been playing other games and it just downloaded about an hour ago so I‚Äôve only played two matches so still one I‚Äôm assuming? Could the rank be the reason?
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they actually did kind of have that skull..
---
It's 2 years old. Not even the same game at this point
---
Didn't actually read your questions? I fucking *quoted* them word for word. It's clear you just threw up some words you found after googling "logical fallacy," because you clearly have no idea what gaslighting is.
---
I guess the question at this point is how should you play to not be try harding? I understand your point to an extent, but why is out smarting someone and getting them down because of it try harding? What would you recommend be done in that situation? I think i stopped the "try harding" by not using my previous build (Ruin,Sloppy,Thana,Nurses), and used this build for Blood Points.
---
I like seeing other people's view so I'm honestly curious.
---
If Survivors get it, their team gets 4 more perks to Killer's 1.
---
Every survivor who cleanses against plague be like
---
I know how to use bond, but I still think new kindred is better.
---
If a game is going to have a ranking system, it shouldn't have major RNG factors players can't avoid.
---
Yea what do the devs know, it's not like they made the game or anything
---
Are you actually complaining about punishment for DCing? XD holy shit
---
And then we have superstrong add-ons for superstrong killers that don't have a downside, while other weaker killers have the same add-on with a downside like Spirit's increased movement speed and Wraith's that also decrease his postcloack speed.
---
well depending in your rank 
---
rank 20 tend to play a lot of KYF and dont like playing alone
---
but when you are in a higher rank(e.g:8) matchmaking will be faster because people want to play they dont care if they are alone or with a friend they will play
---
I just think it would be odd having it in the game but this pic is still amazing.
---
I would love a spider or a scorpion killer but due to tech limitations I doubt we will ever see one. But hey, never say never.
---
I honestly couldn‚Äôt care less about the counter. Everyone and their grandmother knows what the counter is. The fact of the matter is, it rewards the killer for having a bad game and is simply a substitute for actually learning and trying to get better. If they made it so you need to do something to earn the exposed status effect on every survivor, then sure I‚Äôll use it. But in its current state, it just rewards bad players for sucking dong at the game.
---
You mean Identity V? That's like Identity V, right?
---
There is no real competition. Who wants to start a new game when all the good killers are here already. They never even stood a chance on that alone.
---
Not to mention just because you‚Äôre in a certain rank doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll only face survivors of that rank. As a purple and green rank I‚Äôve gotten survivors yellow and below in my lobby and you can bet it‚Äôs easy to 4 k a team with less experienced survivors.
---
I'm pretty new around here, what's SFW mean?
---
I usually just spin in a circle on the ground if I know mercy is my only way to escape lol
---
I mean you don‚Äôt need either if you can never make it to a hook
---
Move bitch, get out the way
---
always works ....  
---
e pelo idioma no jogo, sinto que √© br
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand the definition of facecamp. Any hag that camps once again, is not killer specific. Sure, you can slap a bunch of traps at hook and around, but most high skilled hags know that to be detrimental. I question the rank of survivors you are queuing with if they are unable to deal with a Hag‚Äôs traps. Crouch. Flashlight. Distract with other actions or straight up chasing. Basement hooks are just as terrible for Trapper or spirit or billy, if you manage to get yourself in the basement, you can consider yourself good as dead‚Äîunless through considerable effort. That‚Äôs just a fact. Why wouldn‚Äôt a killer capitalize on the most advantageous hooks in the game. I will agree her add ons are good and can feel overpowered. But you can certainly counter or play against a Hag. The way you‚Äôre describing her is completely unwarranted as any killer will camp regardless of rank. If her kit encourages ‚Äúcamping‚Äù then punish that particular hag. I am a green rank survivor and I can deal with a Hag.
---
You don‚Äôt have to read to copy and paste. I didn‚Äôt have to google anything, because it‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre doing, again, resorting to ad hominem attacks. Look that one up bud. Go back and read my questions again instead of furiously smashing the downvote button on all of my comments lmao.
---
Nurse need another nerf
---
I'm honestly considering experimenting with just AFKing as Killer, because I'm pretty sure that's what a lot of Survivors want.
---
Boo Berry? Did J-Roc make this?
---
I‚Äôm thinking about making that a subreddit ü§î
---
epic lag switch time
---
It‚Äôs sorted by rarity, right?
---
What is this
---
So the stats actually just rat out that they haven't done a pretty good job so far?
---
God the survivors complaining about not getting the stagger reduction and pretending it‚Äôs a big deal are so annoying god it‚Äôs still a good perk they even added noise muffle to it for you people but nope because you can‚Äôt abuse it to infinite anymore y‚Äôall gotta complain
---
Console and PC stats should be in different tabs. Versions should be balanced differently
---
Look behind you!! Hold w gamer is not the way to go D:
---
Okay thanks makes sense. Guess I‚Äôll have to deal with it until I rank up haha
---
I‚Äôm begging for this to be sarcasm
---
hes dying of engamecollapse on the hatch
---
I mean, the main issue is still how gamebreakingly useful comms are, and that hasn‚Äôt really changed
---
Haha, I came in to say scratched mirror and boyfriend's memo Lololol.  
---
How about the wraith's purple Windstorm Comboed with the purple All Seeing add on?  It allows you to body block on a safe loop, and see which side the survivor is going to use to run you before you reappear.
---
You make some great points, and I think they really want dbd to go back to being more of a horror game. 
---
With the introduction of oblivious, undetectable, and buffs to stealth killers, Behavior definitely want this game to feel like a horror game with more suspense. 
---
I feel like I can count on my hand the time I‚Äôve gone against sweaty 4 man SWFs. I don‚Äôt know why everyone insists that SWF destroy the game.
---
yup that will be a pain in the butt
---
Blocked and reported. :) Maybe you should stop wasting people's time with strawmans, then trying to sound smart by googling?
---
It is already üò≠ i was so excited to play
---
Oh how the turns have tabled
---
You can't compare it to hag or trapper. Hag immediately can show up to her traps, trapper is literally weak af because his traps are so strong. But that's not even the reason why you can't compare them and say "oh his palette are thoughtless". His palettes are the only trap that requires Freddy to be present for them to be useful.
---
I'm not saying it's not winnable or beatable. All I'm simply saying it can get frustrating. More often than most anything else right now. It was a comment, and you're being an asshole. Chill. Lol

Yeah im trying to get him to reply but he probably wont cuz I got all the facts and he got all the bs and he probably understood it and left this convo here. And I‚Äôm angry as well cuz he talked full on bs and got all the upvotes and when I reply to him and talk facts I get downvote bombed. U can see what I mean by the start of this convo with me and him. He said that I said something I didn‚Äôt even say and than said to me that I‚Äôm bad at the game. So at the end of the day I shouldn‚Äôt even have got downvoted but this community now days don‚Äôt accept facts they accept being toxic and talking shit.
---
The literal last thing I want in this game is to have to talk to strangers playing it. Seriously &gt;.&lt; I like not having chat with randos.
---
I didn‚Äôt debate team offered junior varsity.
---
As it stands, whenever I'm last survivor and EGC is active, I just run around a cleanse totems, open chests and sabo hooks for the extra bloodpoints. Ain't no way that I'm going to be able to escape so imma get my bloodpoints.
---
Ghostface is the WORST, because he negates a core mechanic intended to find Killers passively, can get an instant down almost instantly and with no regression, and most infuriatingly, gets told my location for free if I remove that instant down potential.
---
But I also hate Plague. Her power is unavoidable, more or less, especially since it builds over time instead of receding at middling levels of exposure, and cripples gameplay options mostly down to just genrushing.
---
Very nice, great quality work there üëå
---
Still waiting on Pinhead/Hell Priest.
---
Yes, but that does change something pretty massive about the game and turn it into something a bit different than what it has been.
---
"Did we just become best friends?!"
---
Any more pics? Love the built up shoes btw gotta have that Myers Stature. Great touch.
---
He should quickstep when using the chainsaw so you can dash around corners at high levels.
---
Still wish they'd get rid of those nast bright pink fake nails. It makes her much less attractive
---
He collects orb from injured survivors. After he collects a certain amount he goes into a ‚Äúdemon mode‚Äù or something like that. 
---
In this mode, He has the speed of Hillbilly, the multiple instadown capability of Leatherface, the M1 of tier 3 Myers. 
---
When not in demon mode, he has a sword for his normal m1. And the bat thingy is called a Kanab≈ç
---
Eh, I think they could have it like so;
---
The faster the gens are completed the bigger the chance of them spawning closer each other
---
I got to rank 6 playing casually on the weekends and I suck at the game, I would suggest rank does not matter too much unless you‚Äôre hovering around 1-3.
---
I do it 24/7
---
I can only assume it‚Äôs a luck of the cards kind of thing. I run into SWF more often than not. But I usually play at peak evening hours around dinner time after work. Probably when most people are sitting down to play with their friends.
---
Gotta run Spies from the Shadows for maximum hipster BP.
---
I went to the link and checked through quite a few of the games in the spreadsheet. Each one of those they were running meta perks. The guy whose channel it is was mostly running unbreakable, self care, sprint burst, and borrowed time. His team's perks were largely the same.
---
If they do limit it, then it's only fair to make it where no Survivor can equip the same perk as another Survivor, correct?
---
Only one person can have DS, Unbreakable, Dead Hard, Balanced, or Adrenaline.
---
After all, it's annoying to go against 4x of those.
---
Anecdotal evidence is really strong in DBD, that's the problem with people who don't play a very large sampling of killer games.
---
They never get to meet the dream teams who walk all over low tier killers.
---
N O
---
Oh I'm also hyped for it finally coming out on a proper game launcher, been waiting for it since Discord exclusivity has been announced. I'm definitely buying the game. However DbD is clearly the biggest asymmetrical PvP game on the market. I would even say it has a monopoly on this game genre
---
also title is just a piss take on people who say any new game that's similar to DbD will kill it.
---
Your first sentence says otherwise. It's making a claim based on that statistically insignificant and incomplete chart. If the data in May was based on similar metrics it's equally flawed data.
---
It's an easy chart to oversimplify to say "the game is obviously killer sided." But we should be looking further into the data. There's a lot of room for error when the only metric they're  sharing has a 25% variance from each possible outcome. 
---
I'm sure a statistician could go much more in depth at the flaws in the data, but that's unfortunately not my specialty. Number of kills per match might feel like a good metric, but it's very limited in what information it gives us about the state of the game.
---
Gayndalf is right.
---
Skill floor = minimum amount of skill needed to be good with a killer.
---
Low -&gt; easy to access
---
High -&gt; hard to access
---
Skill ceiling = maximum amount of value you can get out of a killer.
---
High -&gt; high potential
---
Low -&gt; low potential
---
The skill floor of spirit is low since anyone can pick her up and do decently, but she still has a high skill ceiling because with more skill you can almost guarantee a 4K.
---
Meanwhile nurse has a high skill floor, because you need some skill to even kill one player, most people won't reach that floor, and she has a very high skill ceiling because the best nurse players in the game end chases within ten seconds.
---
*BHVR Official+do hard fans crying salty tears for this post*
---
B-b-b-bu-buh-but it‚Äôs rng!! Therefore it‚Äôs allowed and theirs nothing we can do about it.
---
this was the first time for me where it actually worked and at that point I didn't even expect it lol
---
I‚Äôm already sick of this image. It‚Äôs flooding reddit with shit memes left and right. 
---
At least the Kraft slice is something new.
---
But I believe that's a problem with perk balancing. Even with 4 perks they still use the same stuff every match.
---
What in tarnation
---
Throwing out DC games, though, so Killers who get fewer kills overall, but are miserible to play against may exist. Probably Plague and Doctor.
---
I'm sure the Survivor Mains will love saying the game is Killer-sided now because of the snowball effect, though.
---
 ‚ñ™Five Nights   
---
There is already brutal strength, enduring, spirit fury and fire it up and none of those have the drawback of having to prolong a chase and THEN get stunned.  
---
Freddy's Tune makes your terror radius decrease but gives you the primary disadvantage of huntress?  That in no way is beneficial to you as the killer.
---
The odds shouldn't be 50%. The survivor should not be able to open these doors the majority of the time. The killer already beat their team in the gen game, AND found hatch before them. Killer shouldn't ALSO have to win a 50/50 or worse just to get their last kill after that.
---
*Laughs in Legion, and Leatherface*
---
It's almost like taking the hardest killer in the game, who plays completely different from anyone else, and looking at their stats at all ranks (including ranks where people legitimately suck) won't give you a correct assessment of their power.
---
Like, her ceiling is so absurdly high that half of her players at red ranks are still far from her full potential. No other killer at this game has this. The only one that comes remotely close imo is Huntress.
---
People juat dont know how to read statistics
---
If exit gates shouldn't spawn on the same wall then gens shouldn't be able to get done in 30 seconds
---
Thank you for the info! Again Im new so theres still a lot for me to learn
---
this has to be before dedicated servers..
---
Usually if I see them spin I think they are just getting ready to try to wiggle free. PS4 so spinning is wiggling lol.
---
&gt; game taking me who‚Äôs in swf groups
---
Would just increase the already high amount of killers who dodge lobbies. I‚Äôm a solo surv, have literally never played a swf game, I always get dodged when me + another solo joins the lobby at the same time.
---
Oooh
---
It has nothing to do with hitboxes
---
Not hit boxes, high latency.
---
I do this and once I knocked my phone across the room because I missed. I feel like I keep lunging when I miss, so I sometimes knock shit over.
---
But the cap. What the shit
---
Why is everyone so salty for urban lmao.
---
*\*starts dancing to Sailor-Mayers intro\**
---
Yeah, it'll probably go down under fast even though it sounds fairly fun
---
I‚Äôd love to play against you someday. Make it to rank 1 and you‚Äôll probably meet me.
---
It‚Äôs the reward from the altruism experiment.
---
It's also good DS insurance. If the killer assumes you have DS and he tunneled you too quickly after a hook,  you'll get left on the ground until DS wears off. If a teammate can't reach you for the pickup, you can pop back up and keep the split pressure going.
---
Entity, right the fuck out of nowhere.
---
I see this as an absolute win.
---
Tunneling is not going against the most valuable survivor tho. It's going for the same one no matter how threatening they are, just to get a quick kill.
---
I would only play killer or 4 man SWF then...
---
agree! im actually a newer player and am so happy this game is going strong. i‚Äôd like to be able to put a few years into it myself
---
Lol
---
Give the man break he‚Äôs been ass since after 1 week of release and now people want him nerfed. He‚Äôs balanced at b or maybe a tier
---
Yep, around 8-9 thousand I believe.
---
The video I sent is involving another game overwatch and perfectly describes floor and ceiling hopefully it will help with your confusion about the topic :).
---
Leadership is often very lonely, so even though she had a group supporting her, I imagine she had plenty of those kinds of feelings. And the entity usually takes very strong people, people who face hardship and keep going. It needs people who will remain hopeful and keep trying, otherwise it can‚Äôt feed off of their strong emotions any more. An altruistic, determined, and independent person provides lots of strong emotions and can inspire other survivors, keeping them hopeful as well. Yui fits this pretty well I think. And it seems the entity is getting bolder and bolder with each chapter, so it‚Äôs probably getting stronger as well.
---
Unless you mind game.
---
They balance each other out.

There's just a bunch of perks I'm not really familiar with, I'm not someone who does a bunch of studying for most games, especially when I'm already doing pretty well. I thought I understood what Exposed did, didn't really feel the need to question it, and any time I was killed from healthy and it wasn't Myers I just figured it was due to some other perk or condition I wasn't aware of. I guess it hasn't happened to me enough from non-Myers killers for me to make the connection.

#New Location: Raccoon City Police Station
---
##The Tyrant
---
*Music: [Chase](https://youtu.be/pFgQRMVraYM)*
---
###Primary Weapon: Fists
---
###Power: Brute Force
---
The Tyant has a **power gauge** that fills up over time. Once this gauge is full, The Tyrant can **break through** certain surfaces. These surfaces include walls made of various materials. To activate the ability, **Brute Force**: approach a wall with highlighted markings, and **hold down the Power button**. Upon activating Brute Force, The Tyrant is granted a **10%** speed boost for **5 seconds**. After using this ability, the power gauge must refill (40 seconds), before Brute Force can be used again.
---
###Power: Evolve
---
Upon completion of the final generator, The Tyrant evolves into an even deadlier weapon. Once **Evolve** is activated, The Tyrant loses his clothing, and grows a large **blade** from his right arm (as well as other mutations). Additionally, the recovery period for attacks is reduced by **50%**, and The Tyrant's movement speed is increased by **5%**.
---
**Persistence**
---
Your tenacity is unmatched. Bloodlust increases **5/10/15%** faster during chases.
---
**Killing Machine**
---
You were bestowed with heightened senses. The sounds of Injured Survivors are amplified, and can be heard from an additional **4/6/8 meters**.
---
**Gonna Give it to Ya**
---
You are determined to obliterate your prey. The Exposed status effect is applied for **10/15/20 seconds** to each Survivor who is on a generator when it's completed.
---
##Claire Redfield
---
*Music: [Lobby](https://youtu.be/tc7vlcXYc1g)*
---
**Mixed Herbs**
---
An assortment of plants capable of curing various ailments. Green, Red, Blue, and Yellow herbs are sparsely scattered throughout the map. You can carry one of each type of herb at a time. **Green Herbs** function identically to Self-Care, and **Blue Herbs** allow you to cure **Infected**, **Mangled**, and **Hemorrhage** (the same as Mending). **Red and Yellow Herbs** can only be used when combined with a Green Herb, and increase healing speed by **10/15/20%** each. If you possess all four types of herbs, you can cure all status effects and restore all health states within **3 seconds**. Additionally, herbs can be used to heal other Survivors.
---
**Resourceful**
---
You are adept at utilizing elements of your surroundings. Once per match, you can cause a generator to erupt in smoke, greatly reducing visibility in a **6/8/10 meter** radius. The smoke screen stays up for **5 seconds**.
---
**Tough as Nails**
---
Pain only strengthens your resolve. The duration of the speed boost applied when hit by the Killer is increased by **1/1.5/2 seconds**.
---
##Leon S. Kennedy
---
*Music: [Lobby](https://youtu.be/zSGPoLCY0xU)*
---
**Rookie Cop**
---
You have above-average athleticism and endurance. You are able to roll **1/1.5/2 meters** in any direction. Using **Rookie Cop** applies the **Exhausted** status effect.
---
**First-Aid Spray**
---
A canister of high-quality disinfectant. Once per match, restore a health state in **4/3/2 seconds**. **First-Aid Spray** can also be used on other Survivors, including ones who are Dying.
---
**Handgun**
---
You carry a firearm with you at all times. Start trials with a **Handgun** loaded with **7/8/9 rounds**. The Handgun has a maximum range of **16 meters**, and can be fired every **.3 seconds**. You cannot move while aiming the Handgun. Shooting a Killer stuns them for **.2 seconds**. Shooting a Killer carrying a Survivor causes the Survivor to be dropped, putting them into the Dying state. If the Killer is shot more than **4** times within **10 seconds**, they become immune to subsequent shots for **5 seconds**. Once the Hangun runs out of ammo, it's discarded.
---
Oh right. Yeah I'm in Australia so didn't get the experiment
---
*Hears the tier up music*
---
"Yes, yes he did!"
---
I always say gg, except for once when a killer camped and was totally unfair.
---
when I charge a carter's spark i always inhale when charging and exhale when releasing. I also find mimicing the hand action makes the range increase
---
Completely disagree. If it‚Äôs coming down to the last survivor, the killer already got a 3K. The game is won. 
---
The game needs to be fun for both sides. As a survivor, if the killer closes the hatch, basically saying ‚Äúwell, that‚Äôs game‚Äù as you wait for Endgame would be boring and stupid. Trying to open the door with the timer is probably some of the most fun/nerve wracking moments of the game. My heart goes 100 mph when I‚Äôm trying to pull of a last chance escape. 
---
Way too many killers think just because they don‚Äôt get a 4K that it‚Äôs suddenly a bad thing, or that because they got the previous 3, they are now entitled to the 4th. The last survivor should have a shot. 50/50 would be fine. Bring Whispers or Trapper to trap the doors if you really want to clinch that last kill so badly. The door spawn locations are the only issue.
---
Say all that as a killer main, so nobody thinks I‚Äôm being some biased chump right now.
---
I mean, you say B or lower, and yet he's the deadliest killer at all ranks and at only red ranks. Doesn't sound B tier to me. 
---
Take out his snares, passive phasing, or his teleport and he'll be balanced again. Having all of those together is obnoxious as shit on top of a global slowdown that gives oblivious and adds objectives to the game.
---
I believe the devs that it is just a latency issue and by the way no they aren't here holding me at gunpoint forcing me to type this.
---
Congrats on getting the game! I've had it for a few years but only really got serious a couple of months ago. I love seeing new players join any game and/or fanbase. GLHF
---
You can't mind game cause the survivor doesn't have to loop you, they literally just run forward and you'll never be able to catch them
---
It‚Äôs the same for every killer
---
I did it yesterday and hit my head on my fuckin lamp. Not only it hit my head hard, but also it was hot af, and I have an interview with the headmaster in like two days. Still got the hit tho. Finished the game nearly crying from pain, but with 2 kills.
---
They really arent even close to the same thing. It's like comparing botany knowledge to we'll make it. Totally different purposes
---
Looking at the recent statistics, it's probably both - kill rates are significantly tilted in killer's favour at this point, but godmode ultra starcraft turbo MLG 1337 hyper genrush SWF are still widely considered too overpowered. So in short, balance is completely fucked both ways.
---
They‚Äôre fucking immature assholes
---
Thanks man
---
They are more similar than any 2  other perks. Stop looking for logical flaws in a shot post kiddo

Nothing wrong with it tbh
---
I'd argue empathy and aftercare are more similar but ok

I've been trying to do this for ages on my ps4 ;-;

my thing i do when playing is:
---
1) look for props, jigsaw boxes, pools, portals
---
2) listen for audio, lulaby, huntress grunts, screams
---
3) if i walk around the map and dont hear a terror radius i freak the fuck out because i might be fighting a ghost face or myers
---
I might do a Tutorial üôà
---
That's fair, I'll admit I was a bit harsh in my language, my apologies if I caused any offense.
---
Even when not saving it, it's still not bad. That's a speed boost off a gen you 50% completed.
---
&gt; (80 seconds / 40 seconds = 2)
---
Fixated is also really good with Sprint Burst if you hate wasting it, but are also impatient.
---
There have been plenty of complaints. They've been drowned out by the obscene Spirit issue, and every time you being it up people downvote you to Oblivion, tell you he's C tier at best, and ask you if you why you want him to be like he was when he was released.
---
It has nothing to do with a good or balanced rework, and everything to do with the timing and this community...

Seems like a safe bet that "yagirlsophie" isn't a "him."
---
I didnt know. Im sry i hate reposts
---
He‚Äôs rank 12, he knows the basics and he‚Äôs getting better at looping and whatnot but he‚Äôs fairly new. I‚Äôm rank 4 so we‚Äôve been matching with killers around my rank, it‚Äôs good practice but obviously a lil more difficult for someone who‚Äôs newer. I‚Äôve done that to someone as ghostface though, hooked someone and jake was just tbagging on the hatch waiting for her to die. When she died and I found him, I stood over the hatch next to him as he was tbagging and closed it as soon as it opened. I also had NOED üòÇ
---
The Game is many terrible things, but I really like how the gates are always a good distance apart there 
---
the doctor's map (not the asylum but something else) also has good gate spawns I think
---
These are things that honestly need fixing though. I don't have any faith in BVHR to make their game make sense though.
---
That's... Something to think about
---
It‚Äôs a cool idea, I like the idea since legion is supposed to be multiple people, and gameplay wise that wouldn‚Äôt be too bad. The only problem would be the queue for playing Legion might have to be separate from other killers
---
[Forever Freddy!](https://i.ibb.co/2ZgP07v/Forever-Freddy.jpg)
---
ahhhhh ok makes sense now. I've been raging when I go up against one but this makes sense.
---
You know misogynistic doesnt mean what you think it means?
---
I don't have fixated, might try it if I get around to it in a few months or so.
---
The real problem obviously is that during those 40 seconds, you're vulnerable. My last game trying SB, I forgot I had it equipped after lobby time was actually over, wasted it and ran into wallhack+silencer Wraith 10 seconds into the game completely off-guard.
---
Maybe in parts it's a repeated-bad-luck-induced superstition / fallacy in this case.
---
Yes. I. Can.
---
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs probably a lot more that struggle to hit 1 survivor in an entire match‚Äù 
---
That hits on a very personal level.
---
Make them a powerless 110 mv speed killer that requires 3 hits to down (1. hit to get from healthy to injured, 2. hit to get from injured to deep wounded, 3. hit to get from deep wounded to downed)
---
Hooking survivors instantly kills them and revives them as Legion members, rewarding them with lots of points to encourage actually playing with the killer (and lets remove their collision and shit like this to reduce griefing options)
---
Just an info, this is a repost, original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/8y64gf/xenomorph_killer_concept_the_alien/
---
Honestly they should fix the spawn place of the exit gates 
---
Imagine you are alone with the hatch shut and both gate are like nearly next to each other. Trapped with Daddy Michael or Silly Billy who need only a second to get from one gate to the other. As soon as you try to open one thats it. And not to mention the endgame timer. Its just..unfair
---
Thats when I give myself to the killer and accept my fate.
---
Sample size isn't as relevant when the data they're gathering doesn't give us enough information to interpret the results. 
---
Does it count disconnects as kills?
---
Why go with escape or die as the only conditions? You can have a great game as a survivor where you carry the team in a hopeless game and two people escape, but you die. Likewise you can get 9 hooks as a killer but only one sacrifice. 
---
The game is more complex than the parameters that they used. There has to be something better.
---
As All Things Should Be.
---
As yes, DS, one of most toxic perks in the game...
---
That is the most ignorant statement I have ever heard anybody say.
---
So you're asking to lay off a bunch of people who probably have families and lives to maintain. 
---
To fix a couple bugs as I said you come off as incredibly entitled.
---
I'm not saying Dead by daylight is perfect I could give you a laundry list of problems.
---
But as a team they are actually doing their best to fix a lot of the broken things that have been in this game compared Dead by daylight to how it was in 2016 and you'll see a massive difference of just broken crap being removed.
---
Give the developer some props and stop making ignorant close-minded statements.
---
Who needs to imagine?
---
*solo queue PTSD intensifies*
---
They are across the map. Also this case seems to be more rapid than the usual pallet jump
---
I just did this challenge in the funniest way. I spawned and just ran until I found the killer, a spirit. We stared at eachother a few seconds and she knew what I needed. She let me blind her twice and then she hooked me and the game proceeded. Worth.
---
Perfectly Balanced As All Things Should Be.
---
Survivors never play optimally. And you cant run forward forever.
---
You're also forgetting about bloodlust.
---
Dead Hard, MoM, DS and maybe unbreakable to give the build that down but not out feeling
---
I‚Äôve always wondered how true this is. Because 4 people spawning on a generator across the map from a killer would be able to potentially complete said generator before the killer can get there and potentially split off in 2+ direction to find the rest of the generators. Even if the killer does find them and manages to wound more than 1, he‚Äôll still have to focus on 1 long term to get them down, while leaving a gen really close to being done since kicking gens at higher ranks is basically meaningless.
---
Losing a generator almost instantly can swing a match depending on where a killer spawns. You potentially lose 1 generator and have 1+ other generators being worked on while you‚Äôre in a chase. It takes about a minute a minute thirty to complete gens at higher ranks. If not less. Also takes about a minute to down a survivor and hook them. So you‚Äôre potentially already down to 1-2 generators within a minute or so.
---
Only a few builds, perks and killers get much value out of hurting people. So hitting multiple people isn‚Äôt that big of a deal, especially with the speed of healing. 
---
The only way for killers to capitalize on multiple people working on a single generator it through a specific perk. But that perk is too situational to be of value, especially at higher ranks, and is totally worthless if survivors don‚Äôt work together.
---
So why is it better to start out spawned apart? You get the same value spawning together, but have one less generator done. Most killers can‚Äôt get insta downs, and unless a killer is running slow down perks, speed of healing makes injuries less of an issue. Takes like 10 seconds to heal an injury at higher ranks.
---
He said ps store though.
---
Only Killer with further lunge is Billy, even then it's rare for a Billy to M1 instead of backrev
---
The distance doesn't matter, and those are the fastest two ways to spam it.  A window would close after 3 jumps, so that's not it, you can't fail skill checks that fast and repeatedly like that, so that's not it.
---
uh console has nothing to do with being able to look behind you at all
---
Every killer other than tier 1 and 3 Myers (and slightly post blink Nurse) have the same lunge, no matter how long their weapon is, which is why it looks BS on short weapons
---
No. I played for 2 months every day and I never saw a single person escape freddy, I'm not fucking kidding.
---
I never bitched on here but damn if it wasn't painfully obvious to me that he is overpowered. I don't play anymore but it's funny to see this
---
David seems like he might be a furry. All that anger, ya know.
---
What's ever floats your boat boss I won't judge
---
*That‚Äôs Ace*

what a 5Head redditor
---
This is how they are fixing Quentin's face. They put him on a makeshift entity rack and are gonna stretch his face until it looks less wrinkled.
---
Killer : *it's free real estate*
---
No I know, I'm just saying in general.
---
i'd argue it's best value is allowing you to find the first survivor faster, potentially getting the snowball started earlier. both good reasons to like the perk though
---
‚ÄúWhy is my heart rate increasing?‚Äù
---
Prime example of how stats can be very misleading and don‚Äôt tell the whole story
---
Next is freddy or billy.
---
Most maps it can be somewhat fair. But think of it as the survivor automatically escapes if they get the hatch, the survivor doesnt automatically die if the killer closes it
---
One joke
---
I guess yeah, it's easier for new players, but it'd be nice if there was an option to change it so it would say the specifics. Or if the add on description switches after you've reached a certain rank and say specifically how much it changes things
---
Nah using the steam version but this seems like DBD developers do an all at once update on all platforms as PS4 exits that close. Still that add-on is a pian and fun tho.
---
Didn‚Äôt it say Clown was the weakest though? (However that was red ranks so..)
---
This... this is bloody fantastic
---
when i was new i was confused by doctor illusions and i didn't realize myers could only suck each survivor so much, so i ended up trying to tier off of survivors already drained. i just thought that the more you sucked one person the slower the gain was lmao
---
Oh, yeah, for sure. I think he‚Äôd probably a lion.
---
Fucking Moron
---
Fantastic job. As someone warming up to Myers himself, I definitely love the concept and the cosplay for Michelle Myers. Especially the mask.
---
People thought Nurse would always be top tier because her power negates all survivor tools. Now look where we are.
---
huh. fair enough. i always just googled whatever i didn't understand right away
---
Trapper with auto-reset traps is hell for survivors who need to open the gate. Won many a game with him that way.
---
Don't mean to come off as mean! I just don't play a lot so I didn't see what was significant.
---
Or you could just not stun them
---
Not a bad idea, I'll try running that. I usually just run unbreakable to get up faster, but unless I can hide with Tenacity I usually end up getting hooked regardless. Tenacity is the primary perk in this build because Killers never expect you to get as far away as you do.
---
A bear of a man.
---
This was supposed to be a joke...
---
I mean, having a 50/50 chance of picking the right door that a survivor is going to shouldn‚Äôt be a determining factor. There‚Äôs usually 0 skill involved when the EGC is happening and a killer has to flip a coin to determine what door to go for. Survivors shouldn‚Äôt have a higher % chance of getting out just because a killer was able to close hatch. If you‚Äôre the lone survivor at egc trying to open doors, the match should favor you less not more.
---
I agree. Ton of grammar errors and missing words as well.
---
RNJesus bud. Sometimes it works in your favor, other times it doesn't. Nature of the beast.
---
Nurse is still the best killer lol
---
&gt;Nurse hardly for nerfed, she is still OP as shit, 
---
Good nurses are still good. Average nurses are not laughable, which is an issue.
---
&gt;legion changes prob won't enter public at all, 
---
Based on?
---
&gt;spirit was hardly changed and her main issues where not touched.
---
Yeah, they ham fisted it
---
&gt;Pig was not nerfed hard (unnecessary like BL) and the thing with trapper Is a bug.
---
They confirmed the trapper change was intended.
---
Imo evolve games tended to swing one way or the other. Either the hunters found you immediately and you could never shake them or you'd hide until tier three and wreck their shit. 
---
I occasionally had good games where that wasn't the case, but it was rare.
---
It's simple. Killers should be rewarded based on how many kills they get, while survivors should be rewarded based on how many others survive with them.
---
There are far to many times I try to stun to get him out of his power and not take a hit that I stun him and still get hit. So you mean to tell me i need to just let him hit me now?
---
Really? Because I've seen many people on her saying she is underpowered totally seriously.
---
Or just blame human nature. Its just an instinct
---
Go for it.
---
*literally no one*
---
I have no idea what u wrote but here‚Äôs an upvote
---
Just like this meme... yawn.
---
Then what speed decrease do you suggest?
---
Can you show me numbers to back up how often doors spawn that a killer can easily monitor both? It‚Äôs anecdotal evidence but from my experience after 240 hours in the game is that doors spawn unfavorably for the killer and I‚Äôm left with flipping a coin in determining what door the survivor is going to be at. And most often if I choose wrong survivor can get out.
---
Lol really?
---
Survivor nerfs?
---
They nerfed one perk that broke Haddonfield, and BHVR is 'nerfing survivors'?
---
Come back when they nerfed eight perks, and a dozen add ons. Until then...
---
Pbbbbbbttttthhhhh
---
If I hit the David and he doesn‚Äôt make noise, I will sit in a corner till gens are done then open the gate
---
Don't you love having haunted and ruin and ruin goes in 30 seconds
---
Me, an absolute troll who runs backpack builds just for the fucking thrill: Cowabunga it is, dude.
---
Wow these perks are trash
---
Stats say killers average 65% kill rate.
---
Gens are done too fast. 
---
okay
---
I mean, compared to the other killers, mrs. piggy and bubba usually are the easiest to go against (this may just me playing at a 12 to 9 rank).
---
Devs: ‚ÄúWe broke the fuck out of our game, guys, but be sure to buy the new outfits for your killer/survivors!  See you all in the fog!‚Äù
---
Because the original franchise is owned by the game, and I doubt they would let DBD to have it. 
---
Also, my favorite version is the remake, 100% the most entretaining and brutal
---
Hey now, don‚Äôt project on me because getting out of rank 15 is hard for you. I didn‚Äôt match make you vs killers who don‚Äôt know how to play.
---
Anyone who didn‚Äôt realize the nightmare is the best killer was being lied to or ignored him after the rework. He teleports straight to generators making him the absolute best for patrolling and his traps make him near impossible to loop while you‚Äôre asleep, combine his extremely good mid game with end game perks (noed, remember me! blood warden, fired up etc) and he‚Äôs basically unbeatable unless you get really lucky and he doesn‚Äôt slug the last 2 for a 4K.
---
Over half her add ons are about nerfing her lol. You can run in a straight line and outpace her blinks. Literally, to mind game her now, you just... run... in a straight line... that's it.
---
When a survivor tells me I'm trash, it only tells me 1 thing.
---
If I killed you, and your team, you got beat by trash. That means you don't think highly of yourself, Mr survivor. You couldn't beat a trash player. 
---
Instead of making it about how the other side did, make it about how you did, and it just makes for a better community. "I did well, but the did very well", is better than "I deserve to win because these rank 1s are trash and use meta perks", especially if the survivors run well.
---
&gt; A window would close after 3 jumps
---
This is only during a single chase, no? If they're across the map, they can vault as often as they see fit.
---
Yeah, that makes sense - it's definitely the more effective way to go. I really enjoy doing well at this game, but I don't tend to approach it from a competitive standpoint. I'm in it for the immersion, I guess, coming to it more as just a big horror fan. I support my teammates and the goal when playing survivor, and I prioritize making games fun when I play as a killer, but I'm not really trying to maximize my win/loss ratio or anything.
---
Why are you mad that they try to win? Is it because you're also trying to win? Fucking try hard smh
---
But Freddy is boss because the statistics say so.
---
Yep.
---
Masks are seperate
---
r/thisaintitchief
---
Yup
---
All of what he said was valid english.
---
Ain't this the truth
---
Wait, I've never heard ggwp. What's that one?
---
At red ranks her slow walking speed makes her useless in a lot of situations. From what I‚Äôve seen, if you spend too much time setting up her traps you lose generators. Then you have to make sure to always pressure survivors towards said traps. So if a survivor goes nowhere near your traps, you‚Äôre just a slow as fuck m1 killer. Then setting up traps during a chase give survivors plenty of time to get distance, and against a slow killer that makes a big deal. I‚Äôve also seen where dedicated servers can mess with her traps making them almost useless.
---
Because this game is spaghetti code.
---
How the heck is clown low tier? I always feel like he is cheating when I play him. If I get somebody into medium distance the gas bombs are undodgeable and the survivor is pretty much boned at that point. Plus he has bamboozle natively which helps the chase.
---
*\*start playing eurodance-piano song\**
---
"Please keep in mind that numbers are not everything; there are a whole bunch of factors that could influence these numbers."
---
I figured I would quote the source for your conclusion about the game being obviously killer sided based on the chart. Even the people with full access to the statistics are telling us to not jump to conclusions based on the chart alone.
---
I'll leave out my response to your disingenuous attempt to discredit my argument by dismissing it  by what side I main while simultaneously trying to use it to add credibility to yours-- other than to say that it doesn't contribute to the discussion at all.
---
I see it too, he veered left when he was already near the left side of the screen and you didn't stop to turn for a while so you missed the scratch marks
---
True tho
---
As an Alien purist that‚Äôs read every single EU; anything that even remotely breaks the rules of the universe/creature would make me salt. But at the same time; I think he could be great for the game. If they don‚Äôt follow the recent trend of terrible perks.
---
"give me a **free win** based on luck as a survivor is what I'm hearing." 
---
Can we not with that? Escaping because they chose the correct door (should I close hatch) does not negate the entire match that they worked up until that point for by calling it a "free luck based win" if the doors are some sort of equal distance apart from each other.
---
Why is the sweat red
---
The part I love the most. she died first. Me and the others survived :)
---
Tfw your alarm goes off and you just went to bed
---
Me too! With the green shirt
---
i doubt i would call being oblivious for 8 less seconds a counter but no it doesn't. Vigil was made before oblivous was a thing so its not introduced. May be added in the future.
---
I'd be happier with EGC if they fixed doors spawning so close and the hatch just popped open right when the 3rd survivor gets final hooked. As it stands almost every game where I'm last survivor the killer has stomped the hatch before it even has a chance to fully open because it takes so long to pop open. At that point I might as well just walk up to the killer and get hooked and end the game, there's no chance of escape.
---
Oof talk about a noob lmfao. Doesn't know what forever Freddy is... Obviously doesn't play survivor at all either or plays at such a low level hes never seen it done right. You don't get hooked and can't do gens against forever Freddy genius...
---
The only nerf he needs is the 2 slowdown addons. Everything else is nearly perfect. But being able to combo the addons with more slowdown perks is obnoxiously easy.
---
PS4. Have fun running from stealth killers every match.
---
This is why i bring double blink charge time with further blinks. Im running low on them quickly though.
---
OC stands for Original Content, signifying that I made it myself and that it's not stolen or a repost
---
DBD is to afraid to add creatures as killers to the game, so Last Year the Nightmare might have something going for them if they make more monster creatures like this .
---
Cheeky bastard. You got me red handed
---
Clever.
---
What happened to nurse? She was good?
---
u/Mitchislove Everyone is different. If it happens a lot especially if you get embarrassed from bad games it's possible to get at least a tiny bit bummed from it. It's just better not saying anything at all if there's nothing nice to say.
---
And? 
---
Just because a survivor escapes because I go to the wrong gate does doesn't mean that the game was easy for them, that they got a "free win" or that I lost with a 3k lol 
---
You got to get rid of that mentality, man.
---
Is this skewed by the Trapper challenges on the Rift?
---
A Meme from my favourite graphic novel series! I approve!
---
Person playing with a killer then all of sudden they're a survivor? That's stupid as all hell.
---
Where can I see the stats? I feel out the loop ever since I started delivering packages for Kojima.
---
A toxic swf already get's a ton of bloodpoints for co-op. If you're playing swf would be dumb not to work on the same gen, especially if you bring prove thy self like you suggested.
---
In my case it does. 
---
Since the hatch changes I‚Äôve escaped 0 times when alone.
---
I dont understand why people feel the need to wait for the killer to come and watch them leave. Its also almost always Claudettes.
---
Almost came here lol I love to see toxic ppl getting fcked, survivor or killer.
---
If you want I can tell you how to feel
---
I miss old freddy
---
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me, and dance with me.
---
Lorewise they make sense. Spirits perks revolve around the idea of revenge, all 3 of her perks promote this idea. Huntress is akin to a feral beast, so being territorial of her domain makes sense and knowing when someone enters it.
---
Michael quite literally mindfucks Laurie all movie and saves her for last when trying to kill her.
---
Sure not Every single perk is like this, but killers and survivors have a general theme to their perks that fit their personality
---
There‚Äôs actually a glossary/index on this subreddit that has almost every acronym you can think of
---
That's exactly my point. It's a double standard because Freddy was the exact same way before his rework. The Nurse should not get special treatment. If you rank those two the same way they're either both terrible or both great when you start to get the hang of it, but the community doesn't treat it that way.
---
Julie and Susie: Are we a joke to you?
---
I never said the game was easy for them what I said was the action of escaping wasn't a challenge there's a massive difference.
---
I've seen survivors pull off some pretty interesting mind games with exit gates but I actually give them props for it wasn't just run to an exit gate and open it because the killer checked the one on the opposite side of the map.
---
If you're going to represent to me try to represent me correctly
---
Then bleed out or I don‚Äôt know out smart him and get out also fuck off really gotta start pulling out insults because of this holy shit god I hate this community get your fucking shit together man because your next level
---
On god what if we get Ripley as a survivor
---
Well, actually, killer already "won" if he killed two survivors. And then there's pipping
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm referring to the killer play itself. Their power. Same as the guy saying you don‚Äôt heal vs. plague
---
The people that perpetuate the killer vs survivor salt are usually people that main one or the other. I have like 1800 hours across both and can tell you the salt is strong on both sides, but survivor mains cry more than killer mains. Mostly due to all the made up rules they have for killers imo
---
Sounds like something a survivor player would say
---
In my last game I spawned on one of those mound things in the red forest. As the camera panned around I could see a hex totem a few meters away. Ran straight to it and started cleansing. Poor Ghostface‚Äôs ruin was gone within the first 30 seconds of the game
---
Your right about gens, sadly I don‚Äôt pick my teammates.
---
The chance to get hatch is almost always removed as I get slugged for a 4K.
---
And I do have a chance if the hatch is closed , it‚Äôs just never happened to me since the update.
---
Definitely PS4.
---
I don't see a single reason why anyone would... Some maps you can't even use BL and BL can only trigger on a small handful of spots on most maps compared to nearly anywhere with Lithe.
---
Repair a gen, vault a window, slam and lift a pallet, and sabotage a hook without chipping a nail and tell me that‚Äôs not hot as fuck.
---
When playing solo,i feel like bond is the only thing i need
---
Real shit? I almost always use mobile so sidebars aren‚Äôt as in-your-face for me. Thanks for the heads up brother.
---
I mean, Billy sprints constantly so maybe that's why he is the go 2.
---
I have lag and framerate problems on my old Xbox One and PS4, sometimes on PS4 Pro but on One X runs smoothly, I can actually enjoy it. But in a lobby the game drops frames on all of those consoles. It wasn't like that few months ago but after some recent update it started.
---
You dont even reply anymore cause you know I am right. And now the new stats confirmed what I was saying. 3K is totally standard.......... Get your entitled killer ass out of here
---
Well, if the huntress wouldnt be a potato, you would have been downed 5 times because you didnt look behind you, also she tried to hatchet when she could have just M1 to get an easy hit.
---
I got you, and I‚Äôm on mobile too exclusively.
---
Nah man, it's huntresses new meme addon where her hatchet throws phase through all survivor hitboxes doing no damage, but any hatchets that would've injured or downed a survivor give her increased 50% blood points for hunting hatchets score events.
---
If you want another example if a Bubba found three survivors crouching in a corner and down them all with his chainsaw I would still call that a free win.
---
Why because it had nothing to do with skill it was just down to luck.
---
My opinion if you win something by sheer dumb luck when I consider it a free win it doesn't matter whether you're a killer or a survivor
---
Not anymore lol, Freddy is king of the killers now.
---
yes
---
just do bones lmao
---
I've read them all, and all I remember are pices from the killers, I can't even remember my main survivos backstory "ace" other then he gambeled I think.
---
LOL legal cheat mode, fucking love it
---
It kinda still promotes altruism.. wich is never a good idea. Why not throw the "indure an extra hit" in favor of something less ridiculous, do we can make it a easier perk to deal eith in both sides?
---
I can‚Äôt even play the game on switch right now. It just gets stuck at the loading screen before the main menu.
---
What the fuck
---
https://youtu.be/zbv-R-QwbUc
---
How lmao, its one chance for the last survivor to escape and its heavily killer sided.
---
What? Are you not able to think properly, and use your eyeballs? I hope you never play against a killer that mind games lol gg
---
You can combine mask, knife and body, the body will change gender depending on which you pick but the mask or knife has no influence over it.
---
You're close minded.
---
HE LITERALLY HAS A TRAPPER MAKS ON HIS HEAD, THAT COULD OF BEEN A SURVIVORS HEAD BUT NOOOOOOOO, U HAD TO PASSIVE AGRESSIVLY ASSERT YOUR DOMINANCE ABOUT WHICH CHARACTERS YOU PLAY WHICH CLEARLY NOONE ASKED FOR!!!!!!
---
My apologies. I'm just going off the words you said in this topic multiple times including:
---
&gt;That's not skill or a challenge **that's giving a survivor an easy win.**
---
Best of luck in your games.
---
Until few weeks ago she was the (probably) the best killer in the game but THEY changed how her ability (and add-on) works.
---
Good im maining legion
---
Yes lol! Nurse got a rework to her add one and other changes that knocked her down the ranks and so now at the top of the food chain is Freddy, Spirit and Hillbilly with Freddy being the king of the red ranks. Crazy times I know.
---
Dedicated servers are why the stats are like that, nurse rubber bands like crazy rn
---
Have you heard of alternate skins?
---
Kinda blind tho
---
What would you propose instead of the 'endure the extra hit'? Depending what it does the set up requirements would have to change.
---
I was expecting the gif of Snoop with a wine goblet and the big coat.
---
I actually hope that‚Äôs the case with how often I see others DC as a survivor.
---
I‚Äôve only done it 3 times this month for different reasons each time. But it‚Äôs still the best way to deal with a slugging for a 4K and I can‚Äôt deny that.
---
I don¬¥t reply because you are not worth replying to. "This game is not fair, it has bullshit, stop trying to make improvements to it". How does that warrant a reply? 
---
The stats they gave us are next to impossible to interpret because they lack so much info, but that would have been apparent to you if you actually knew how to read stats and not just go "hurr durr look number, numbers good numbers right". 
---
You act like I want to "remove" perks like DS, when I never said that, you are insulting me for no reason because that is all you can do, and you cry about "camping" or "tunelling" when those tactics are completely stupid and game-losing. This thread talks about playing as good as you can and still being fucked. 
---
You are the one who is so fixated on my reply but I should "get my entitled ass out of here?" Follow your own advice and GTFO. You said your opinion, whining about not getting a reply will not magically make it more popular. So piss off.
---
cause people are doing gens while you're looping them
---
Except no? Nurse takes much more practice to play well and without being able to properly use her power, you will never hit anyone. 
---
Freddy is just an m1 killer with a different power and, as such, has a much less steep learning curve.
---
Exactly, so drop the chase and apply more pressure
---
Wait, so is it actually sweat?
---
I love when this happens to me  as a trapper too.  Such a fantastic feeling!
---
probably because losing isnt fun?
---
This. Sure, you can place them wherever you want, but they do jack shit if you ain't there.
---
I hate this community too. I hate when people like you who have literally no idea what they are talking about downplay actual problems because youre either terrible or have an extreme bias toward one side.
---
True i havent played this game as long as you. Only about 200 hrs and ive gotten like 5 messages ever from a salty killer but almost every game get one from at least one of the survivors. And honestly i might be a bit biased cuz i play more killer but i can see why theyre so argumentative and defensive lately seeing as 3 killers just got nerfed in rapid succession. Makes them get a bit defensive when they see posts calling for other killers to get nerfed, myself included.
---
from what I‚Äôve seen as killer and survivor, it‚Äôs almost everyone. You have those good survivors who leave as soon as it‚Äôs open, and then the ass ones who tbag and do whatever else before the end game timer is finished. I would say majority of survivors I‚Äôve been in games with as killer tbag at the exit gate, regardless of rank. This is just my experience though.
---
But it‚Äôs their fault. I never do this as killer and win often.
---
We used to make fun of my friend that would get Michael Jordan tongue playing NES
---
It's only RNG if you decide to take the chances and try waking up through a skill check... there are quite a few ways to wake up other than that.
---
Because some killer's don't know how to let go of a chase to get easier prey, and for some reason that's your fault
---
Nah you'll still be able to win some games as killer probably
---
I'm referring to pre rework Freddy not modern. He had a much more difficult learning curve but once you got the hang of it it was easy 4ks every game.
---
Wait wait wait I haven‚Äôt played in forever is nurse bad now???
---
Good thing they are fixing rank reset. Now you only go down one color.
---
Nope killers can have 999+ ping and whatever happens on their screen is what happens since they have hit authority.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox too!
---
..i'll take this at face value and hope you're kidding
---
I hid the whole game so I deserve to escape 4head
---
I don't angry at it either, usually I chase that one survivor who knows how to loop well to see how well we can outwit each other, those chases are the most fun I have in the game. But I think it comes down to the fact that Killers want to FEEL powerful, and when a single survivor can take that power away, they feel like if that one survivor gets away after they catch them, it's game over, or at least would be a worse defeat than a single kill.
---
And there's the punchline. Hilarious.
---
You'll still be able to get easy wins as always with her.
---
great suggestion
---
:o SWF and complain to the killer about tunneling
---
If I had fun in a match and the killer didn‚Äôt manage to get anyone I‚Äôll often let them sacrifice me as a thank you for being a fun killer to go against.
---
So it runs good on the Xbox One X? Cause I was thinking of upgrading but then again the next gen is on the way lol.
---
Dead by Daylight is a "Labor of Love?"
---
I always drop the chase if I see they run good. That usually means the others can't run as well and once it's down to just the good runner and I he either gets the hatch or dies. If I can get him down before we find the hatch and they don't struggle I will give the hatch to them.
---
Have you created your blogspot/tumblr blog yet?  So you can have  a legit compilation of your comics.
---
Half of freddy's kit is counterable by just waking up...
---
Aaand there's the admittance of defeat. Didn't have an argument so you switched to an insult. Cool we're done here. Next.
---
I'm an even split dude with 2000+ hours, although I do play killer more than survivor often but it's not much of a main, and I agree with you wholeheartedly
---
üò≥
---
Why do survivors dc whenever they get outplayed after tbagging?
---
I had a game last night that had almost this exact same setup. It was so weird. I was playing as Freddy and I probably should've ended with only 1 kill but ended up with 3.
---
You don't need a counter argument for someone who thought pre rework freddy was anything better than hot trash.
---
When i tilt forward after lunging and getting hit by the pallet, i recoil in pain
---
Every Vommy Mommy I encounter either has no idea how to use her power correctly or always gets a 4k. There doesn't seem to be an inbetween.
---
Says the asshole who had to start flinging insults out of nowhere who was legitimately whining about dc penalties because sometimes people can keep survivors hostage but god it‚Äôs so clear that me thinking it‚Äôs stupid that some ass is bitching about DC penalties but nope you have to have a panic attack and start shit thanks a lot asshole because you just had to go HUR DUR KILLER MAIN TRYING TO DOWNPLAY MY PROBLEMS I didn‚Äôt hear anyone bring anything up when that No Mither Sabo Build existed that could make a game last an century or even the fact taht an immersed team could take the game hostage so shut the fuck up you started shit out of nowhere
---
True but that may be too much work.
---
Looks like they are some really nice people around. :)
---
He was probably like: "Yo what the fuck ?!"
---
Pallets aren't safe if he is in the Demon mode.
---
I mean, hag does have a skill floor. Trapping around the right loops and maintaining your trap web, knowing when to break chase to reset your web, keeping your traps close enough together to teleport, etc.
---
This is amazing, well done! Side note: holy freaking hair! How long is that!
---
Leatherface and Spirt give some great perks if start there
---
And you've just proven my point too. Thanks for the icing on the cake. Good day then.
---
How good are you with nurse compared to the other 2, if you're good with her then you'll be good for most matches. Nurse was changed to be more punishing to people who messed up on her blinks and  is still best killer in the game. Billy would be 2nd choice if you're looking to win consistently but you should probably just play what's fun or easy for you
---
This is just a much better version of the pig
---
Sabotaging a hook is pointless if your team isn‚Äôt taking hits for you. Even if they are taking hits all you do is drop the survivors unless you were going for a risky basement hook.
---
Not at all the argument that's being discussed, but okay passive aggressive tough guy
---
PLEASE
---
Spirit and Freddy the best killers to choose
---
Leatherface for his perk bbq
---
Been using iron grasp and agitation on my killers for basement hooks
---
I didn't know that the only way to die last is to hide the whole game.
---
They didn't used to however, so oldie players may still think they do due to no change in animation
---
Nurse has never been a "good" killer on console, so you can't really use that as a fair thing.
---
classic blendettes
---
No, xenomorphs don‚Äôt fit in the game and having stupid pallets stop them in their tracks would be disrespectful.  No predator either.
---
Nope, Monitor and Abuse compared to Shadowborn. Why the fuck does Shadowborn even exist you trade all of the best parts of M&amp;A for an extra 4 degrees more FoV than M&amp;A already gives you.
---
His power literally just made him worse than every other killer. It had 0 strengths and stopped him being able to hit survivors without waiting 7 seconds. But sure, go enjoy being salty.
---
The true power of blendettes
---
LOL, must be rank 15. What are you even talking survivor nerfs?? This game is easily survivor favored that I have to assume you are absolute shite or ignorant and cannot tell the difference. Survivors can literally do gens in 3 minutes. One day you might be able to play on a good SWF team and learn reality. Survivor and killers main alike are reading your comment like "KEKW" üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Close minded? How do you think the killer would feel if all of a sudden he became a survivor during the endgame collapse and the survivor just became killer with the hatch closed and the new survivor having no key? That's such a shitty concept and is such a cheap way to win.
---
You know what nah not today I‚Äôm not dealing with an asshole who needs to start shit to feel better about themselves good job on freaking out and insulting someone for no reason and starting shit you are truly a detriment to society
---
The answer to both question is exactly the same: because the game doesn¬¥t go the way the survivor or killer wants. That is the point.
---
That's what they're trying to do. The devs said it at one point
---
Nice seeing this post again. Aliens one of my favourite franchises
---
&gt;When a killer gives them the advantage.
---
Lets be honest here, people bitch but the truth is anything the killer or survivors do without exploiting mechanics is fair game.
---
Or dead hard on a very close call.

Then why not just say that? Why even take the risk of coming across as a douche lmao.

That‚Äôs pretty overkill bringing 2 perks just for that 1 hook. Agitation is all you really need and it‚Äôs better than iron grasp cause you can catch people off guard and catch up to them

I see, he just needed some love &lt;3
---
Yeah, but that's only because he set for them. He had faced them before and knew their strategy already; you won't have that luxury in most matches.
---
Don't get me wrong, Otz is a very good player and beating that SWF was still incredibly impressive, but that doesn't change that the add-on is trash.
---
Dont worry The oni is going to have a nerf 100%
---
No, you can 100% argue that the game is not killer sided even after seeing these stats. To make that conclusion is to throw any sort of interpretation or reason out of the window and make conclusions based solely on the number of kills. Do you think trapper is the most popular character outside of red ranks, by a margin, because he‚Äôs just that strong in all ranks (except 1-4)? No, that can easily be explained by newer players picking him up for their first games since he‚Äôs the poster boy of DBD. Do you think nurse is actually a terrible killer because the numbers say she has a low kill rate? Or that a top tier spirit is less effective than a top tier Freddy? Because if you‚Äôre going to assume that the game is killer sided off of number of kills alone, you also have to admit that nurse is apparently worse than legion/wraith. Is she? No, of course not, but anyone who knows nothing about the game and pays attention to numbers alone would obviously assume that *based solely on these statistics.* 
---
On top of that, kills do not show quality of performance as well as number of hooks. If I make two people die on first hook as leatherface, does that make me a good player? Does it say that leatherface is a perfectly balanced killer, since he hits that 50% mark? No to both of these, for hopefully obvious reasons. 
---
I remember a while back when stats were released, they showed that trapper had the highest kill rate across all ranks and rank 1 survivors had something like an 80% escape rate. If you choose to be blind and look solely at the numbers, trapper is apparently the best killer and rank 1 is ridiculously easy to hold. But when you consider that newer players at lower ranks play much more trapper and have a much easier time even without top tier perks, or that rank 1 was very easy to fall out of if you didn‚Äôt perform well or have a team that performs well, both of these statistics can be easily justified. Exact same thing applies here, but confirmation bias will inevitably result in players bending both of these statistics to fit whatever their opinion of the game is.
---
As plague you can go straight to one gate and vomit on it, infecting the switch, if they cleanse for the end game that switch is corrupted for 35 seconds by default, only infect one switch so you know where they are, watch the other one, then after 30 seconds infect that one and walk to the other.
---
She broke multiple bones and needed a long time to recover from the physical and mental trauma.
---
Do you really think that a woman barely winning a fight is r/thatHappened material?
---
It's the same question, it's not just killers that get salty and angry. Not passive aggressive at all, don't be annoying
---
and have spine chill.
---
You‚Äôre a legend.
---
Same thing I did with a Trapper. I ended up chasing him around at the EGC until I died because the other 3 ran out of the gates. I'm very bad with flashlights.
---
That‚Äôs one her other skins tho
---
what‚Äôs your gamer tag???
---
My boyfriend and I both get so many salty messages when we play killer. I‚Äôve even had one survivor send all the survivors a group message complaining after a game. PS4 is just as bad honestly
---
They should have 60 seconds at the start of the game where hex totems can't get cleansed imo
---
Did they specify if this is PC stats or all platforms? Cause nurse has always been absolute shit on console so that could be dragging her stats downs
---
Logically, it makes sense. But in the essence of gameplay, imagine playing as the survivor. You're caught once, as almost everyone eventually gets caught, and from that point forward you have zero control of your character as you're farmed off the hook, dropped next to the hook, and hooked again. Ten minutes of a game wasted because of shitty teammates and a killer that took advantage of it. Yes, you absolutely can murder one survivor early in the game by giving them no control at all over their gameplay, but don't be surprised if people think you're a dick because of it.
---
The reason why I love Freddy is purely because he is one of the few killers who don't need add ons. His base kit is more than enough to win every match.
---
I‚Äôll pm when I get back to house
---
Yup, she's very similar to the Hag. You can't play them normally and that causes them to be underrated.
---
gotcha
---
It will be even more useful now with new prayer beads rework, it will almost be as dangerous as last time.
---
Sounds like a plan
---
Every minute or so you fall asleep, and he can instantly just put you to sleep by hitting you.
---
If the other 3 people on your team died what makes you so special? You can die and still 2 pip lol playing survivor is no where near as brutal as killer
---
Ahoy ladies
---
Why answer a question with a question that has the same answer.. just like say the answer??
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/XsZe9

Well you can understand why some people feel like that, right? Playing with friends on voice comms gives you much, much more information about the killer than you have normally. You don¬¥t need to spend perk slots on aura reading and you are much more coordinated than with random survivors without voice comms, and if one of your party brings Object of Obsession, every person can easily know where the killer is at every moment of the game, without even having to use a single perk themselves.
---
It is pretty damn strong when compared to regular solo queue.
---
..Clown is good though.
---
Because some people can get the connection without having to have it explained to them.
---
I still miss it. A truly great game but ruined by greed... Loved playing both sides. Never felt unbalanced for either side. I wish they hadnt ruined it with their pricing/dlc culture...
---
If your buying with cells, wait until the Black Friday sale in game on the 28th
---
Yes I can understand why people feel this way. I don‚Äôt play killer myself (at least not much yet), so I don‚Äôt feel particularly strongly about it, but I understand the pain that killers must go through.
---
When you get greedy you get caught! That little bitch deserved it!
---
lil froggy twerking that ass
---
Are we mad? Just a little bit? Stats prove my point. 3K is now how the game is balanced and the only crying I am hearing is from you and your whiny post you little bitch. Grow some and stop posting your whining on reddit so I dont have to read it. Thx
---
You can still get stunned while in demon mode and it denies you of getting a three-man down like in this clip
---
Ghost face for fun, leather face for perks, spirit to win, and demi gorgon to lose
---
You can't stop me
---
You're a demigod.
---
Yes, I'm very familiar with this strategy. I use it a lot. But it wouldn't have prevented the scenario I described here. I immediately went straight to the gate furthest from me after closing the hatch, and they had already opened it.
---
Monitor, Thanta, BBQ and PGTW. This with his slowdown speed add ons is nasty!
---
The first killer you should ever get is Leatherface since BBQ is the best perk since it gives bonus bloodpoints to reduce the grind
---
Yeah, upload all of these to imgur and post a single link or something. They aight tho.
---
This concept is inheritantly imbalanced, its either overpowered because survivors have no counterplay or underpowered because the average killer can never pull it off
---
I used to but I found the game more fun as a survivor, suppose it's more so me enjoying a team rather than being solo. That's until the rank reset happened and i seemed to encounter more toxic players than ever before
---
Thunk
---
Bad Manners
---
Mmm very optimal
---
Then balance using speed decrease.
---
A lot of killer perks become useless on specific maps or against specific perks; it's asymmetrical dude. That means there's no meta because each trial changes constantly
---
I hope we can keep our stuff when we make the jump because if not I‚Äôm done lol there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm grinding from scratch again.
---
It seems you have been body blocked quite a lot
---
Still reads weird.  Ignore my lack of culture.
---
I haven't yet. Maybe I'll make one on tumblr someday since I used to have one already, though I'm a bit apprehensive considering how quickly they mark blog as nsfw these days.  
---
Currently I'm focusing more on a little project I'm doing and figuring out how redbubble works lol
---
You're entitled to your opinion. But, to note, he can break pallets with his power. Also he doesn't have to charge at all/rev to do so. 
---
Either way, the biggest annoyance is his utter lack of a terror radius on pbe.
---
Also, billy is countered by hiding, but you cant really do that versus Oni.
---
Don‚Äôt know what to say besides you‚Äôve probably played a lot of piggy
---
A firearm for survivors? Lol nope In a certain killer it would not make any sense since they are human and directly by logic they would be seriously injured or directly killed by a shooting of the Premades x, d
---
No Ripley. David. New perk, 'I'll Do The Fingering'. Once per match you can enter a locker and a new version of you runs out and runs around the map randomly.
---
...including Deathgarden, lol.
---
The superior English
---
Yeah, you are right. I realised that when I die on hook its mostly my fault doing something boosted(very often), or killer mindgaming good(not so often), or Just DbD Things^(tm)(hitboxes, DH, lags... - very often)
---
That's happened to me many times. I just go in the locker and hope the killer forgets to mori me lol
---
Piggy &lt;3
---
The Entity grants the Killer supernatural strength during the trial.
---
It's hard for me to tell people's intentions and shit irl, let alone on the internet. I needed to at least have some confirmation
---
You're going to have to elaborate on that one.  I play both sides (prefer killer), so I can tell you I my opinion, I have more success as a survivor than a killer.  Most killer perks are... shall we say situational and can be build dependent.  In reverse, there are many more general use perks on the survivor side that are not situational.
---
That's fair, just in my personal experience I tend to see a lot more rounds where killers have more helpful perks. Rounds where the survivor perks have helped more are when killers have had near to no perks on or just some really weird ones, but we all have different experiences with it
---
I used to think killers were op when I only played survivor. Then, as I played more killer, found out that it wasn‚Äôt the case. You might want to try playing killer before making conclusions such as ‚Äúkillers are op.‚Äù 
---
Now, I think that the game is mostly balanced. I say mostly because it‚Äôs an asymmetrical game and asymmetrical games can never truly be 100% balanced. 
---
If you are killer and playing against 4 man swf with thousands of hours in the game, you‚Äôre like 99% gonna lose. If you play solo with potato teammates and a good killer, you‚Äôre like 99% gonna lose.
---
Wait, he got partnered?
---
üêΩüñ§
---
There are lots of killer perks too that can become useless and only help for a bit of a longer chase.
---
The problem is on your side if you cannot use those perks to generate advantage. Learn to loop properly, learn which tiles and map parts are good/how to run them, if you are using Dead Hard in the middle of the field just to get a few seconds worth of burst you are doing it wrong. 
---
It is a completely regular occurence to simply have to drop the chase as killer at high ranks because the survivor is good at looping and knows how to use the map properly and you cannot catch him without losing too much gen time. If you always get "downed anyway" then it is often your fault for not being able to use the environment properly, at least at the first half of the game when most pallets are not used up already.
---
Unfortunate the community is divided into 2 sides and both doesn‚Äôt like the other sadly lmao
---
I can't be the only one who read that at "Perfect Orgasm".... Right??? Guys?
---
I‚Äôm liking the improvements on the lore of the characters in DBD, which is something I‚Äôve wanted for a while. DBD had the same issue Overwatch has- all these interesting characters, but not enough depth to them (Reaper, my main, for instance- he could very easily be a sympathetic villain with a lot of depth, but he‚Äôs just been ignored like most heroes), and I‚Äôm so happy this is being resolved- and not just for the old characters, but for newer ones too.
---
You can see the ping before the game starts
---
All personal experience really, I just tend to find more perks to help killers more than the survivor ones that do, with perks that give Intel on gens, location, better scratch marks, hiding in lockers. Anything to aid a survivor can be something used to expose them which is what I find a lot. I do like the perk allowing us to see a killer when a gen is finished tho, that helps A LOT
---
Jesus the cringe.
---
You have more success as a surv? Wow srsly? You must be N00b3 level then. Honestly when I play killer I 4K or 3K like 95% of the time... not even joking.
---
Complaining about a Hag using her ability is petty. There is a camping mechanic for every character in this game if you want to camp. Insta downs, stealth, just sitting there, proxying what have you. As I stated before, if someone is going to camp; they‚Äôre going to camp. And if your teammates are constantly triggering traps I hardly think they‚Äôre red rank materials. It‚Äôs a well known fact that if you camp you will lose, so ‚Äú90%‚Äù is not backed by anything but your supposed experience. Hag is not overpowered and she‚Äôs not a chasing killer. If you play her like that good for you, but of course you‚Äôre going to do bad.  You have no hard statistics for why she‚Äôs campy and you‚Äôre the one who should be providing such.
---
I understand when it's against hours and levels of skill, it's just perks and add ons I find most biased
---
A passive kindred and every survivor has something akin to the obsession chase thingy. Makes solo que much better whilst not buffing SWF at all.
---
Im seeing Pig,Trapper,Demogorgon,Legion and NOed in one person?
---
*Nah,this ain't it chief*
---
Adorable

It needs to be more visible. It's so out of the way I sometimes dont aee it myself

Not a surprise from BhVR, they copied and pasted Megs voice lines over to Yui and then with Michael and his pipe, you spend $4 and it makes the same noise as his knife slash. BhVR Interactive has gotten extremely lazy and sloppy!!
---
Hence me saying the spawning of the doors is the issue....
---
Cant argue with that, you're right. I understand it takes time to learn looping and maps to get better with chases
---
What rank do you play survivor at?
---
if they are infected however they will leave the switch infected if they touch it, and lockers theyre hiding in, and the coughing.
---
That's the whole point. If the killer closes the hatch before you you should lose. It's asymmetrical, it's not meant to be winnable 1v1.
---
While I agree with you the red bar warriors will never give up.
---
Nurse is still great, just more difficult to learn and play than she used to be. 
---
Trapper is awful, but can have some pretty good snowballing. He just takes a long time to set up and get going but the ability to close off loops can be nasty...if there's not another three loop areas right next to the one you blocked. 
---
Billy is one of the most fun killers and can also snowball pretty well. Probably my overall recommendation. However, if you're wanting to catch up on the Tomes Trapper play is mandatory.
---
Lmfao, can I ask why this was necessary? XD
---
Oh my god. This happens to me all the time as a survivor. üò≠

Happy cake day

It's ok:)

Perhaps we can help you? Which perks are you using, which perks do you think are weak and which perks are you having issues against on killers?

Since rank reset I've only reached 13 so far, but I've encountered a lot of face campers and tunnelers that have made it difficult to rank up. That's on ps4 servers

We have quite different experiences then. There is often at least 1 person on the other team not close to my ranking, if not more. I also get crappy games where I go against much worse survivors than I am.

What if I didn't want to? Is there any kind of punishment for sending different

If you get banned then DBD has issues.  Did you get the footage of him body blocking the switch?  I'm sure there are no grounds for him to stand on if he did the exact same thing to you.
---
Comments?
---
Someone give this man a cookie.
---
It makes me feel better
---
Lmao sry had to do that
---
Hence me not commenting on the spawning at all. I was merely responding to you saying "Open the door until right before the red light...etc." Anyone new to the game will think this works all the time, so it was more for them.
---
all ingame microtransactions are seperate from the dlc of the ps store.
---
Where can I find these statistics at?
---
People actually do this?
---
Lol you're fine.
---
You aren‚Äôt supposed to escape every game it‚Äôs built to be a lucky thing. The killer‚Äôs obj is to literally kill your team why would escaping be a common thing. I keep saying 2 piping while still dying is possible and you STILL want to escape costing the killer a pip for 5k BP lol. 
---
Almost any killer viable at red ranks? No man that‚Äôs complete bullshit. Against survivors that are actually good not just SWF/mic comms only ghost face spirit and wraith are reliable. Anyone else can get punished hard and looped by anyone that understands the game or they lack enough map presence/pressure
---
Damn, I wish I had half your talent. GG.
---
Buying the chapter from the store with money will not warrant a discount. Sorry mate
---
yeah, I got the whole game recorded.
---
Exactly right its an easy way to get kills. Take out the weaker links in the team=less people to repair=better chance on winning/rank ups. 
---
Sorry but it's 100% possible to get away from a tunneler, learn to juke/loop. As someone who tunnels every game a good looper/goodjukes will piss me off and tilt me almost every time. There is always an option. And im definitely not going to give you an advantage because "reasons"
---
They lost and are big mad.
---
Then I would HIGHLY suggest you play killer or at the very least learn every killer side perk.  Perk / killer combos are very important.  You cant really have Agitation with Myers or Ghostface, it basically hinders you.  And back in the pre-rework days of Freddy, you couldn't even use certain perks at all because they actively worked against you.  Hex: Lullabye for ex.  Knowing HOW a killer hunts will only help you in your survivor game.
---
If u are the last survivor remaining you already lose, so why complain about the gates?
---
I will, thanks for continuously being wrong and misinterpreting everything I said.
---
I specifically said I sadly don't have Thanat or Monitor teachable.
---
Reddit killers only consider a win when they 4k at 5 gens. If survivors touched gens, they gen rushed. 
---
Countless times I found myself at 1 gen or even zero gens while still killing 3 or 4 survivors and without any game slowing perks but people out there are stacking at least 3 pseudo game slowing perks (Ruin, PGTW, Dying Light, Sloppy Butcher, Surge, Thanatophobia) to make sure survivors can't complete a single generator.
---
Ah thats brutal. Asking for the coming black friday sale
---
Holding the game hostage like he did is a ban worth offense in bhvrs eyes.
---
Oof brutal. thank you for the help
---
What sort of insane survivor propaganda is this?  Next you'll be saying that grunting like an enraged animal in time with your kicks won't cause them to break pallets any faster!
---
that being said, this form of hag is one of my least favorite killers to go against
---
i understand its one of the easiest ways to get her daily done but fuck is it unfun to play against
---
How does a meg manage to get to rank 5
---
i like the guy who tell people what to do with  a product they paid money for.  
---
dont be that guy
---
yes but it‚Äôs still difficult. just like walking through the corn can be frustrating for a tall killer, i imagine walking through tall grass on many of the maps would get annoying. similar to the corn, after any decent distance you can‚Äôt always stalk through corn (that‚Äôs my understanding anyway, i‚Äôm a survivor main). the idea of him dragging and having unique animations is dope tho.
---
Killer mains:
---
*visible disgust*
---
Yeah that's fair
---
Part of me was hoping they were gonna see it and just dc.
---
Freddy.
---
Freddy is so good.
---
And no one wants to play killer forever so the only thing getting killed is the game.
---
Protect the baby dweet at all costs
---
Person in question wasn't aware of the chapter for some reason by the way
---
nah going on reddit to complain is obviously the solution
---
He's a good killer, you just need to get the hang of his bottles. He's diabolical at stopping loops or making the pallet get thrown down faster to avoid hits, and herding survivors where you want them to go.
---
Yes he immediately breaks out of his power and the gauge loses about 75%. So you are basically hard resetting him.
---
They've reaffirmed they don't plan to touch him and I believed believe them. After all the time they spent reworking him they aren't going to hit us with another one so soon.
---
But the Buff Survivors don‚Äôt want.
---
Totally the correct solution amirite /s
---
Lower quality but better looking.
---
One person getting away must be super frustrating can‚Äôt imagine what that must be like. The humanity, I‚Äôm so sorry you have to experience that
---
There have been several really knowledgeable streamers and killer mains who have said that the "start together" and "start apart" offerings should really be swapped. Its much more beneficial for a killer for everyone to start together. Sure one gen might get done really fast but its better than 3 gens getting popped at roughly the same time just 40 seconds later.
---
I don't know, that flaking skin has me feeling a certain way.
---
&gt;We have quite different experiences then.
---
It probably varies from region to region, time of the day and killer / survivor population, which would be some of the reasons why its tricky for devs to balance it as most people dream, fast queues and "fair" matchmaking. 
---
&gt; I also get crappy games where I go against much worse survivors than I am.
---
Note that I didn't mention going against survivors below me because this could easily because o SWF or simply the fact that ranks 20 to 16 aren't affected by matchmaking at all. Once again, to ensure that they can find a match because too many people complain about queue times.
---
I can live with that, I don't know these people. I'm playing for me, not them. The goal is BP and ranks, not making sure they are happy. If it's that much of an issue then the devs will eventually add more tools to combat tunneling.
---
Well yes but actually yes
---
Tis but a short price to pay for beauty
---
sadly there's no post game chat in console :(
---
SEXIST!!

Billy sounds like my character
---
To be fair, the stats showed nurse as the weakest before the nurse nerf and freddy buff.
---
Their fault for not dropping chase.
---
I'm not going to spend a minute trying to deal with a survivor looping killer shack when I can just grab the Blendette sitting on the gen.

One thing I will always like of the spirit is how her attack coming right of phase looks like a move from Killer Instinct.

---
As a Killer main, the four things that earn mercy for me are: Spinning in place slugged, headshaking while slugged, offering an item, and making my life easy when you are downed. If I've killed 2 people, my whims for further murder mostly are determined by how the survivor acts. I do this when I survive too and have a way higher mercy rate than my friends.
---
Freddy needs tweeking but billy is litteraly perfect, they're nerfing spirit because people play against her literally every game and she's an annoying mess, it's not a "kIlLeR aBlE tO wIn NeEd nErF" situation. The devs are gonna tweek freddy a bit because he's overpreforming and buff the lower tier killers.
---
Ok leather face lol

What's the actual nerf with instaheals? I don't get to play much anymore and noticed they aren't working anymore
---
what game is that?
---
You must admit that sometimes you go against a killer so good you start asking yourself if it was even possible to counter the mf
---
Same
---
It can get even worse, if you buy both characters with cells then you'll have to buy the DLC for full price just to get recolored Kate torso piece.
---
That's kinda difficult when killers vs survivors is the entire game
---
That's fair. I definitely could have done that. I will say that this game is not a good example of the killer making the game unfun as much as the survivors hook diving too hard and killing themselves.
---
Nowadays I've gone up in rank and killing the survivors too fast isn't nearly as much of an issue as their saves are much more consciousness of me still being in the room
---
Looks more like they decreased the hitbox eh?
---
Tyrant should have a smaller terror radius than most killers but loud directional footsteps to make up for it. It'd be cheeky as he could stand still as a sort of mindgame. 
---
Maybe addons giving him limited aura reading on the other side of breakable surfaces. 
---
Head-crush (His instant kill attack in RE2) as his Mori? He could get a different mori animation as the super tyrant once the last gen pops.

Rookie Cop is quite the same as dead hard, that thingy with the colored flowers is way to complicated, and a handgun?? And whats the base movement speed of the killer?

"It's okay, I got t-bagged too..."
---
I admittedly made that mistake today. I wish I didn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm not proud of it, but I was SO salty and I got rightfully reported
---
I feel that the old survivors need a lore rework because of this, Megs lore is like "oh she is a good athlete, one day she was training and the entity kidnapped her"

This was real, I was trying to keep the last 2 alive until I could make sure no one gets hatch
---
This is really cool!
---
What is this spider doing here?
---
He isn't op in my experience, but forever freddy is a bitch
---
I mean, you're welcome to feel that way. But if we're always putting a higher priority on gaining gaming currency over having a good time playing a video game, the toxicity will never end. Now we have entire teams bringing DS to every game, jumping into lockers to ensure they can escape, etc just to combat tunneling
---
I love playing Legion, he‚Äòs my favorite killer^^
---
Run Inner Strength. It is a great perk even outside of Freddy games and completely bypasses Sloppy, healed in 8 seconds. There are enough totems on the map to activate it more than once and if you learn their spawns you can prime it easily anytime. 
---
That at least takes care of the healing part, and reduces Thana. Ruin can be countered at the start, leaving him with add-ons, Pop and Dying Light, and Dying Light takes quite some time to get rolling.
---
This will be down voted but Freddy has too damn much in his kit. I know he sucked ass compared to other killers before but damn they over loaded him with shit.
---
&gt; When the survivor is put into the struggle phase, the egg opens and the facehugger attaches itself.
---
I can already see people camping to get that
---
What about the fast movement with a single blink?
---
I'm not bullying you, bro. I love you, bro.

One of the things I love about characters like Freddy, Pig, and Plague is how they fundamentally alter the formula of a game.

Hitboxes are mostly broken, but that one is quite impressive

Great ideas!
---
I get told to fix my Internet connection by survivors with 400+ ping themselves. But my Internet is fine. The problem is that I'm usually going up against people in America or Asia (I'm in the UK). If you're a survivor and see that the killer has bad ping, then just leave the lobby.
---

Alma wade is a child or is in a child body. They would cause problems especially with religions, because we all know religions get pissy at stupid things.
---
But it‚Äôs just alma is in a kid body.
---
I never said I don‚Äòt believe you, it‚Äòs quite impressive xD

Same with mine lol

Always the butt dancing
---
Iron Will becoming my new favorite perk
---
Brute force would absolutely destroy some loops but also create some great scares if you had Nurses and see a survivor healing on the other side of a wall üòÜ
---
Why you sound prejudiced to casual players
---
You can mindgame the killer in loops with Iron Will. It‚Äôs why IW is arguably the best perk in the game
---
I love playing them too, but against good survivors it can be really tough.  You have to know when to avoid chases in certain areas on certain maps
---
Should after effects that wraith Bing bong appears then hugs... Would be epic!
---
Best we can do is nerf Pig
---
Do it when they break pallets, that seems to be the most consistent
---
ü§£
---
Trust me, if I were the killer in that situation, I would‚Äôve laughed almost maniacally. You don‚Äôt know how much I hate it when some survivors teabag at the exit gates.
---
Most of the time I absolutely destroy all their other teammates yet they‚Äôre still acting like shitbags.
---
I love the idea of Purity. Purity should be a default feature on all killers. I'm tired of getting blocked at the exit gate trying to get at least one more victim. You ever see anyone take a hit of Jason's machete out of the kindness out of their heart in the movies? I wouldn't even make it active all the time, only when the exit doors are open to make it more challenging for survivors to save their friend. Like, Mfin' Trapper is swole boi, he can probably pick up any of those survivors body blocking him and toss them aside.
---
"Wounds inflicted by successful attacks Hinder your target", um, how about no? Considering its any successful attack. That would apply to a Huntress' Hatchet that could already have exhaustion and Hindered add ons for example. And that's already annoying af to come up against.
---
I was actually conflicted about giving my vote to DbD or Project Zomboid. I chose the latter because they just released an HUGE update that improves the game significantly but I feel bad for not voting DBD at the same time.
---
Random kill just goes "Is so quiet OH HI NEA I mean entity me don't know" man I love Trapper
---
XD omg I thought I was so weird for doing this. I though I was the only one.
---
‚Äúgood killers‚Äù
---
*is rank 14*
---
Instead of it being a perk, it could be an actual add on to his ability so instead of taking a perk slot, it takes an add-on slot and you could stack the two. Or have it so the distance you can hear sounds is greater. So weaker Stridor but with more range, or just take Stridor for a shorter range but more accuracy.
---
They could use older alma, my bad I haven‚Äôt played fear sadly but I knew alma was a child I didn‚Äôt know she well I can‚Äôt explain it but she has 3 different forms it seems. 
---
They could use the oldest form.
---
He‚Äôs pretty brain dead to play decently, that‚Äôs very true.
---
Hope is dope
---
Its cool, but mostly useless as there will generall be another hook close by. Distortion on the other hand is A1.
---
Yeah with quick and quiet and perhaps lithe
---
There is a Black friday sale soon. All of them will be pretty cheap
---
112? That's lower than base lol unless u mean 112m/s which I doubt bc regularly it's 4.6m/s
---
Imagine thinking it's killer vs survivor when it's sweaty SWFs fucking game balance for everyone.
---
I 100% do this. It helps with my accuracy somehow.
---
Not if you used bond correctly.
---
‚ÄúAll ranks‚Äù
---
When you wake up right before your alarm goes off
---
They used to be referred as percentages. Meaning 112% of a survivor's 100.
---
see, every time I pallet drop a killer, I completely forget I have a flashlight and try to get distance. And then I remember and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwell shit‚Äù.
---
See https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/106566/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
True, in enough high ranks there is like a 50/50 chance that you will win, because he is a low tier killer. Guess you play with ruin tho? My build right now is STBFL (have to switch that after the next patch), BBQ, ruin and discordance. Works quite well in green ranks/early purple ranks.
---
Red ranks are literally instant, they are instant at most ranks. You‚Äôre kinda in a dead area when hardly anyone at your rank plays
---
This happened to my friend in PS4 and the survivors were a swf so they all put him in a group to bully him and told him to put NOED next time.
---
Poor Vommy Mommy :(
---
Well not really they differ in the fact Billy has a oncommand insta down and movement ability but the Oni is argue is far deadlier once he gets his power
---
The higher you rank up the faster killer queues will get.
---
Ohhhh wow you were implying SB is better than Head On. Thats so wrong that I‚Äôm just now understanding what you meant. Damn that‚Äôs bad man. Head on is 100% better than SB. Absolutely. Lol
---
Oh well, then I take that back lol. Also I don‚Äòt know the range of dh
---
Sorry, Terraria is getting my vote but I love dbd too
---
killers being shorter than loops are also hard to put in
---
Wouldnt spirit still be ‚Äòmost hated‚Äô since the update isnt out yet
---
All survivor perks are ‚Äúviable‚Äù.
---
And his base is 115% that's not very fast in retrospect to all other 115% killers
---
Lol no.
---
She did, and kudos to her for getting it.
---
*no mither has entered the chat*
---
And they became the obsession lol
---
How did she
---
Yeah, sucks when that happens.
---
I mean thats debatable.
---
The people who DC are dead, just like this format :]
---
Coughs in pharmacy
---
Yes they are. Do you know what viable means.
---
he vibin'
---
If the killer doesn‚Äôt play sweaty and they get no kills I‚Äôll let them kill me. Provided they haven‚Äôt tunneled one player to death, tried to facecamp someone or use NOED. It happens
---
Hope isn't a bad perk, it's just that 90% of solo queue games don't even make it that far lately so it's kind of a waste. Same with Adrenaline really.
---
Fair point
---
Get deliverance, an Adam perk
---
My apologies. You are correct its 115% had a moment of stupidity. Either way hes the fastest obtainable.
---
I like playing against nurse bc 90% of them aren't good the 10% are godly
---
what Hits?
---
Myers always receives a "thank you stabbydaddy" after every round from me lol he's my favorite to go up against
---
I agreed and did that early today to a tbaging blendette
---
Huntress. But I play on console so she‚Äôs very rare :(
---
Me
---
Ehh I love being jump scared so I will say ghost face, pig, or the shape. If I get jump scared, and actually freak, then I don‚Äôt care if I win or lose.
---
Do you remember when some maps spawned with only one exit gate?
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers
---
Do you?
---
Not all perks are viable js
---
My mouth literally dropped. Was not expecting that lol
---
They tried that. mm took way longer believe it or not. Only way to save the game imo.
---
Thanks! I think it would work a lot better in practice than theory. Basically:
---
- Green Herbs heal
---
- Blue Herbs cure
---
- Red and Yellow Herbs improve green Herbs
---
- All Herbs together give insta-heal
---
As for the Handgun, I made especially sure that it would be balanced, taking into account that multiple Survivors could run it. That's what the 4 shot limit is there for. It prevents the Killer from being stun-locked. The Handgun is also not at all a freebie to get a Killer to drop a Survivor. It's basically a strategic stalling device. Say you have a gen almost finished, and the Killer is approaching. Those shots could buy the time needed to complete it. The same goes for unhooking someone, or helping an injured Survivor make it to the gate.
---
This looks like when you pick a bubble wrap and twist it to explode everything, instead of popping one by one.
---
He is but his turning radius is shit so unless he comes out of nowhere it's quite easy to find cover he can't curve around
---
Love trapper. Despise wraith.
---
He‚Äôs a bad killer at high ranks so it‚Äôll be hell to play him later and BBQ and Chili is a must have and Franklins Demise and Knockout are both good perks
---
He's still classified as humanoid but just has a flower face.
---
How‚Äôd he get banned?
---
Like: Myers, Trapper, Demogorgon, Huntress, Freddy
---
Depends on specific game details: Doctor, Pig, Ghostface, Hillbilly, Leatherface, Legion, Wraith
---
Dislike: Plague, Spirit, Hag.
---
Not enough experience to say: Nurse, Clown
---
It mostly depends on the killer's behavior. I see too many Plagues immediately slug people, which makes me hate them more, but I've had a few fulfilling games against them though. Same with Hag, I see a lot of them camp or place like 4 traps on 1 hooked person, which affects my of Hag players.
---
Yeah i tried playing piggy for the first time, i was tea bagged, blinded over and over and they finished the gens in like 5 minutes. It sucks trying someone new but theres not much you can do
---
It also let's you see the killer for a bit which is nice so you dont run right into them after getting unhooked, that's mostly why I like it, and yes distortion is good but some killer perks will eat your tokens right up
---
Not a problem ;)
---
Why are you booing my performance when my teammate couldn't even get a gen in that time. Plus there was plenty of audio indication of what the huntress was doing i didnt need to look behind me to dodge.
---
Yeah, sometimes you have to be able to just accept that random things are going to screw you over, like server latency or Huntress's giant hatchet hit box. I get a lot of "pallets are maxxed out so bad, that some pallets that are usually there 100% of the time are not there" maps, and I have to be able to accept that it will be a bit harder, or impossible.
---
I applaud you FishyFlamingo
---
Maybe 4 unhooks if you also still counted protection hits. If its just unhooks, 3 should be enough tbh.
---
I think DBD owes a lot of its survival to the inclusion of licensed characters that other games couldn't get, as well as the fact that the game just kind of works best with the genre.
---
Its not good on its own but with perks like lithe or quick and quiet it can work. The bad thing is that now you're using 3 different perk slots to do 1 thing which is not good
---
You can win with every single perk in the game. Just because some of them are not "Super top tier meta" doesn't mean they are bad. Dare doing something different instead of caring about top tier builds.
---
Thats fair, I forgot about the killer aura reveal.
---
Tough as nails too strong
---
So survivors always get 3 gens before you get 3 sacs?
---
GG ez babykiller /s
---
I was playing surv with a few friends yesterday and I pretty quickly realised the Plague we were up against had the Black Incense addon that let her see where we were at all times when infected. There was no way we were gonna win without cleansing because she made unhooks nearly impossible and had literally full map knowledge. One of the few times I'd fully condone cleansing against Plague.
---
Wait, wheres nea?
---
Originally the idea was to have Medpods similar to the one in Prometheus around, but honestly I never really got around to figuring it out, haha. 
---
Other concepts [here](https://imgur.com/a/fCQMFrb) for anyone interested.
---
The Archives is pretty much the lore rework for what it‚Äôs worth. I‚Äôm actually invested in hearing more about Baby Claud and Evan.
---
That doesn‚Äôt make sense when matchmaking is terrible. After rank reset I‚Äôm rank 12, get 3 rank 17 teammates versus you, a green rank killer. I can loop the shit out of you, and eventually you catch me, because killers are the power role and the game is designed where you eventually get caught. And then I see my teammates just looking around, crouching. That doesn‚Äôt make me trash if I call you trash, it‚Äôs just my team didn‚Äôt capitalize on the time I gave them. So you are trash, but they‚Äôre even worse.
---
easy
---
Leaning while turning in Mario Kart will also not make you turn better.
---
Put them with Michael‚Äôs disturbing bulging eyes under his mask, and we have the holy trinity of DBD‚Äôs creepy gaze society.
---
So you're telling me that if a survivor gets unhooked and has a  toolbox, med kit, or has been a nuisance throughout the match that I should go after the other survivor that unhooked him instead?
---
Somebody told him he needed to show off cleavage to get partnered so he stuffed some socks in his shirt and then did some Pilates sort of moves.
---
Pretty good is different from the ones that u spawn and ur team is already on final hook
---
&gt;No decipherable speech, mouth made for eating, communication with screeching and screaming and clicks, feral, more predator than person. 
---
The Demogorgon is hardly putting anything into the human part of humanoid. Other than the fact it can walk on two legs despite clearly being able to gallop like some Cryptid horror beast, I would barely classify that as human-anything.
---
I always make a weird sound as I lunge when a survivor is right near the pallet.
---
What survivor nerfs? Flashlights, number of pallets, vauilting speed, instaheal, exhaustion, changes to the maps, end game collapse, decisive strike, balanced landing(soon) just to name a few. But i guess since you are aparently such an experienced and skilled player that you knew all this and just ignored it in your ignorance. 
---
Survivors can do gens in 3 minutes? Yeah if the killer is afk. Or are you talking about the infamous gen rush for which you need 4 people who all agree to use a purple toolbox, brand new part, no mither, resilience and prove thyself? Because that shit happens almost never.
---
Also, insulting me and checking my comment history? You are taking this way to personal but i guess you find triggered killer mains in every post here
---
Reply of the DECADE
---
No problem. I‚Äôve never played F.E.A.R. either. I just looked it up and saw the ending as the best result, watched it and thought ‚Äúhey, this might be the next DLC‚Äù. Anyways. I‚Äôve just read about the lore and it seems Alma reaches the age of 26 before her life support gets cut. And she also has an adult form that you get to see in the games. 
---
Just in case that we can‚Äôt get Alma as the new killer we might be able to get one of her sons as the new killer who also possess some of the same psychic powers that she does.
---
That‚Äôs true. Interestingly enough I‚Äôve noticed Freddy Splinters no longer appear in bloodwebs, for me at least. Hmm
---
Looking at the fire diamond, its highly flammable, a dangerous health hazard and unstable.. Would be a sick clown add-on
---
I know that feeling. I have Demogorgon on Level 1 and really like him, but i just don't have the perks to apply a lot of pressure. I still kill people, it's just that i have to tryhard and get sweaty for 1 kill.
---
\*slow clap\*
---
This also includes console nurses
---
Is that Ash in a Lowes vest?
---
Sorry, but the moment you just said the killer can easily catch you from a DS just proves everything you said means fuck all.
---
If you are in a lobby, the servers cannot be down...
---
EGC, closing hatch
---
If that's what you think then sure, not going to argue with you
---
Thx. 
---
I recorded the whole match (20mins) so I need to edit the first 15 mins out. I'll save your comment, so when I do post it I can send you the link. :)
---
I agree with this to a certain extent. I've run into plenty of killers who run NOED on billy, spirit, new Freddy, and even nurse. that's not balanced. Most games escaping vs those killers at red ranks means every second of gen time possible, and cleansing all five totems could literally throw the game. On trapper though idk why people complain. He's weak as shit and needs all the help he can get.
---
In the stats they released in May a 4 man SWF party had a 48% escape rate.
---
Mmmmno, no ya don‚Äôt.
---
Why are you booing him he's right
---
Technical limitations and the like
---
I mean, tough shit, suck it up dandy boy. It happens. It's a team based game even if all 4 survivors play for themselves. Someone being chased down is giving YOU time to repair. Matches last like 10-20 minutes, so you lose one, who cares. Nobody wants to rank up, your Q times go through the roof, people only want Blood points, which you can get a lot of , even if you lose. 
---
Ther'es the other part that happens more frequently. All gens repaired, Killer has 3+ survivors alive, he auto loses. He is NOT getting a 4k no matter what he does. 
---
If you're a solo , and your team sucks, oh well, get 2 gens done, look for the hatch first and pray he doens't find it first. Your scenario sets up your team sucking so bad that all 3 die before 2 gens are done ( i think tha thas to happen for hatch still? Or just one survivor left it spawns I guess, whatever), AND the killer finds the hatch first?? Unlucky game, shit happens. Killers get unlucky games too. 
---
One survivor is really good at looping and juking the killer ability, loops you for enough gens and you lose. SWF happens, one survivor is tracking behind you the entire map to let the other sknow where you are and where your traps are. You're not special lmao
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e26s65/i_think_wglf_is_bugged/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Why is the fact he's an 'm1 killer' a point that matters? He has a versatile tool that can completely nullify perks such as Deadhard with a commonly found addon on the bloodweb, slow down more, and cause a variety of effects - even instadowns. Many other M1 killers are considered 'good' but don't have too much too them - Hag is a 'm1' killer as they have only traps, but they're also a good killer, Doctor could be considered one.
---
Limited mobility is true, but all killers aside from Spirit, Nurse, Hillbilly, and likely soon Oni have that problem. He'll always have generator pressure if you run PGTW. With him being good in chases, if you can end them fast, you can prevent generator progress quickly combined with a Ruin to get a few hits or downs in.
---
ppl said that when end game was anounced and the devs said it hardly happens lol ya right it happens almost every game
---
if you zoom in, there‚Äôs a key
---
Not only forgiven, but thanked
---
Alternative suggestion: Let a fucking key spawn in the God damn basement corner that didn't have a chest prior after the killer kicks the hatch. 
---
You know, that way it's more than just pacing the floor as killer back and forth until you spot the survivor, which is just lacking any kind of possible skill as a factor usually.
---
Some people don't like that, because why should the losing team get a crutch for sucking at the game ?
---
He really is a fun character to play on. I've had good times playing things like Devour hope on him and just in general I love his stealth ability. Definitely one of my favorite Killers to play right now, next to Trapper, Hag, and Freddy.
---
Nurse will awlays be one of the best killers due to her power imo.
---
oooooooooh i see lol
---
Freddy's snares serve the same function as Clown's gas. The only advantage clown has is the ability to strategically throw his bottles so the gas has a wider area of effect.
---
If serious (really serious) I argued with my friend on a crate of beer that I could collect 300 downvotes in one day.
---
All games with a disconnect at any point in them were discarded from the stats entirely.
---
Fair enough.
---
There is sometimes a bug where a lobby can get only 3 survivors
---
Sounds like something a player would say
---
I agree man some of those definitely hit
---
I have over 100 hours and have never seen this before
---
A small price to pay for matchmaking.
---
It's a map addon that you can mark where you are.
---
Any match with a disconnect in them were discarded from the stats entirely.
---
&gt;Im not assuming just based on stats, however &gt;these stats confirm the experience i personaly &gt;made playing as survivor and as killer, as well as &gt;from what i see in streams.
---
Again, confirmation bias. Anecdotal experience and watching people who literally play the game as a source of income cannot back up ANY statistic, significant or not.
---
You missed my point on leatherface entirely. I wasn‚Äôt somehow saying that facecamping bubbas skew the average enough to create these numbers across all killers; rather, it was meant to show that kills alone are not representative of killer performance. If you want to get in to averages and statistics in general, medians are significantly more reliable and substantial compared to averages, which are subject to heavy skew and are seen as much less substantial in real, meaningful statistics.
---
&gt;Statistics do have some meaning. Some need &gt;interpretation while others are pretty &gt;straightforward
---
And this statistic requires interpretation, unless you‚Äôre just using it to confirm whatever bias you have about killer/survivor. You‚Äôre just agreeing with my entire point here.
---
&gt;killer mains seem to interpret every statistic &gt;showing that this game is in their favor as &gt;meaningless and its actually pretty funny to &gt;watch
---
I‚Äôm not going to get in to petty and meaningless survivor/killer main politics because they‚Äôre petty and meaningless. I gotta ask, though; if you‚Äôre so intent on averages and numbers being the end-all and believe this average has enough substance to reinforce your existing views, how many statistics does this happen in? Do you have an average on the amount of data this phenomenon is present in? I‚Äôd assume not, since data like this isn‚Äôt released very often,
---
‚Äúevery‚Äù statistic is not a very high number, and you‚Äôre likely just saying this to stroke your own ego.
---
The Tome will never close, it'll always be there for new players to get lore from. It'll stop spitting out Rift Fragments once the Rift closes, though.
---
Looks like a legendary medkit dropped for you.
---
From my experience stay wherr you are. Red ranks on Xbox are literally filled with survivors just as bad as rank 15's, but instead of a bad killer, you get a killer who always camps, slugs, or tunnels. Its close to making me stop playing for 2 months so I can atleast enjoy this game again. Example: just had a hag who camped the first person, than got looped by me for 2 minutes then put me in the basement and sat in the doorway of the ironworks.
---
I kind of feel like you tunneled that jake...
---
Well, sorry if thats what killers are supposed to do in game, kill survivors
---
Thank you

She just eventually caught her, it was a Laurie, 3 times.

You cant fool me, this is a monster hunter world iceborne promo image with dbd stapled on.

Teach me how to know the direction where the huntress is aiming for just by audio pls.
---
But the huntresse need his rabbit ear on his mask because i don't know how to said that. Weird. I don't know really like to draw but continue to be better.
---
It's latancy
---
I miss sad Freddy memes......
---
\&gt;luck  
---
poggers
---
Yeah, but then he'd only down one person instead of three at once, since after breaking the pallet, the Survivors would (or should, anyway) split up and scatter.
---
Bro it‚Äôs water off your back. I love getting hate messages from survivors it‚Äôs funny. And then you can just shit talk them back. I think more online games should just allow trashtalk
---
That makes more sense. Sometimes killers will go after someone thats out in the open or an easy hit. In that case there isn't too much they can do unless they drop that chase. But I assume you mean going out of there way to hunt down the hooked survivor that is the worst target possible. It is shitty when a killer does that.
---
I'd love some big antlers
---
From my experience, most survivors fucking LOVE Michael. Whether or not they die it‚Äôs always a fun and spooky game.
---
Jesus ppl blow the SWF stuff way outta proportion. There are those super sweaty groups that try and as shit while playing together, but I‚Äôm willing to bet most groups are people just trying to have fun and Dick around with their friends. 
---
This message is from your local killer main that doesn‚Äôt like the SWFs in general, but I understand they aren‚Äôt all sweaty try hards.
---
I literally played a Huntress game 2 days ago where I hit a Steve and I saw a blood splash but he didn't get injured.
---
They have some pretty good stuff on their official site.
---
This makes sense it's so annoying .-.
---
It makes communities more toxic and very unfun. You may be more suited to being toxic and dealing with it but I hate toxic people. Usually I brush off insults and toxic behavior but its just so damn anoying when its 24/7 of toxic cunts.
---
Thanks :)
---
Needs more pustules. 
---
Srsly tho good job.
---
Wow. I can only imagine how good that felt

*Tea bagging at the exit gate then seeing blood warden activate*

What‚Äôs the name of your perk skins?
---
But you don't have to take damage for sprint burst.
---
Yeah.. I've also noticed the return of the teleporting killer. You'll stun them, get hit, it'll knock them on the side you got downed on, they'll do the stun animation, then they'll teleport back to the other side. Complete bs if you ask me.
---
Woah, how did you get your perks to have color?

ngl I‚Äôm just gonna d/c and go on another game. I play this game to have fun and if I can tell the game‚Äôs not gonna be fun because of laggy killer, rubbish teammates or boring killer build etc I‚Äôm gonna get the hell out of that game...
---
I would pour a beer out for Deathgarden at launch but they would just use the can as another hunter skin.
---
It's the same reason when u feel a hit is bullshit
---
I sometimes do this as well, but for some reason, whenever I decide to give the killer a free kill, they end up being the most toxic pieces of shit in end game chat.
---
Last Year.

I think prayerbeads will cancel out her terror radius not showing it tbh or has there been videos? I‚Äôm a console player so I don‚Äôt have ptb
---
I didn't misunderstand anything. I wasn't talking directly to you, as I figured you were aware of it. It was for new players, not you.
---
its literally not that bad. If you whine about NOED out of all things, then well yeah ofc im going you're bad since again, it's fairly easy to counter.
---
While the price seems a bit steep for the product in question, I honestly don't see how this could be considered cringy?

Did the same to a Claudette with Ghost Face.

She and another teammate were waiting at the gate too and I pretended to go away, then I one shot her since she was still marked.

1. Survivors have a lot of pallets, most of which can be looped for a significant amount of time; strong windows on some maps, toolboxes, keys, Lithe, Balanced Landing, Borrowed Time, etc.
---
2. If you are getting hit shortly after using Dead Hard, you're using it wrong. You should be using it to guarantee a window vault/extra pallet loop without getting hit.
