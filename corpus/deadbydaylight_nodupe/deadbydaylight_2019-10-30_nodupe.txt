Quentin is just tired tho.
---
---
---
Never thought about that. I’ll have to try it sometime. Thanks!
---
Yes but wraith is actually usable unlike trapper
---
I only saw the "hit a second time in feral frenzy" part, missed the exposed but i assume it means the bleedout timer
---
I’m happy the devs got it in time for Halloween but I fear the appreciation for that will overshadow the fact they let this happen in the first place.
---

---
Don’t get me wrong, I really do think the devs are great for working to get it out on Halloween, but let’s not forget they made a mistake that got us here. Mistakes happen, it’s understandable, but it happens too much with BHVR imo.
---
I just started 3 days ago and have 8 hours of game play according to steam and have only had one issue, which was a Ghostface tea bagging me. The chat, even post-game chat, seems nice so far. I'm only at rank 16 though, and I'm hoping I don't experience the toxicity everyone is talking about.
---
Are you sure? Do you have a source ? Because Jumpscare Myer is my favorite build in the game but it sucks that I have to take Monitor, you will have a 0 terror radius without monitor?
---
It is, it's just not part of the meta. Most of DbD's meta revolves around self-sufficiency and Killer time wasting. Adrenaline, DS, BT, and DH are all basically the embodiment of those two traits.
---
Its not good on swf thought cause they can just 99 every gen but hey its usefull sometimes
---
I wouldn't even say the other perks are weak on itself, it's just that killers stomp everything that's not helping you in a chase.
---
It’s coming out tomorrow which is a day before Halloween so it’s still a Halloween event technically
---
True, I just wish there was more variety
---
Haha entitled survivors haha funny and original hahahahahha
---
I’ve actually had better luck with not going up against large SWF groups lately
---
My meta perks involve Windows of Opportunity. It’s just a great perk for creating chase paths in your head.
---
I felt this on a spiritual level.
---
Wait, really?
---
Nice
---
yeah, if you just hit a survivor in frenzy two times to down them, legion would just stack frenzy cooldowns ahhaha.
---
I’m on PS4 and Switch so as happy as I am I feel pain too. 
---
On the bright side when we eventually get it it’ll be even less buggy as they’ll have had more time to iron out bugs!
---
2 killers and 8 survivors would be fun, although I feel like the objective should be different from generators
---
aaaaaaAAA archives!! I love the halloween event as much as the next guy, but GOD I have been waiting on the archives for so long! ee!
---
The update will include cake.
---
Ok boomer
---
Yes, playing the game.
---
Grabbed Pop before it changed, thanks for that.
---
IF you’re lucky
---
Grabbed Pop from the shrine, thank you.
---
Same here! I can’t wait for the extra BP opportunities and free cosmetics!!
---
Seems accurate
---
No one fixed your issue because you're still here crying about not being able to play. You just heard someone say what you wanted to hear.
---
Lithe being better than Dead Hard LMAO
---
You crazy Canadian sons of bitches, you’ve done it again!
---
i mean if you drowned you would probably be afraid of water too
---
Lol I'ma get downvoted for this but once I was paired with this annoying survivor team, so at the end of the match I bodyblocked the exit gate handle and was the only one to escape xD. We eventually made up though
---
 For me it’s killer dailies when I’m a survivor main
---
Play Dr with bbq, distressing, unnerving presence, and something of your choice for the fourth. Use a "calm" add on and you get 60k points a game almost guaranteed. It'll take some getting used to but it's crazy points.
---
An xenomorph would make a pretty cool killer too
---
Thank you!
---
For me its survivor or trapper dailies
---
So you’ve gone from saying that I don’t accept help from anyone to saying that I only accept help from people who tell me what I want to hear? My issue isn’t fixed and can’t be fixed but people have given me advice on how I can play the game.
---
No? Where did you get that from?
---
Actual boomer moment
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93849/patch-notes-3-3-0-ptb
---
"Updated certain Killer powers with the Undetectable status effect: The Shape in Tier I of Evil Within, The Pig while in crouch mode, The Wraith while Cloaked, The Ghost Face while in Night Shroud."
---
They release the patch notes the same day?
---
Is it?
---
Nobody nontoxic spends real human money on a Jake cosmetic
---
I had a game against a Spirit (without ads-ons) where two people DCed immediately. She then helped me find chests in the map :))
---
I'm from Australia, it's still not coming out in November for me :(
---
Calm spirit,calm spirit,calm spirit, and calm spirit
---
Now this is an accurate description of legion
---
I am
---
They struggle, but they’re secretly into it
---
Yh ik it’s frustrating, I was playing plague a bit so strong killer against a full swf, got only a 1k get flamed in chat for being “bad”. So I went on spirit to relieves stress and get flamed for being bad for playing spirit. It’s just a joke the killer side of the game.
---
New totally not the entity
---
Or you get screwed because he’s running Class photo add on so you can’t tell what gen he’s going to. I know because I use that add on religiously, and some unlucky group of survivor mains in going to suffer because of you people informing me of Forever Freddy.
---
I play on Switch and there are not many high ranked players that I know of or many players in a certain rank at all. I’ve been playing with the same survivors and killers around rank 10 (I know it’s not that high) and I always cycle through the same 15 or so players. There are a lot more lower ranked Switch players than medium or high ranked which makes the loading times much longer on top of the normal long wait times.
---
Along with ruin, now I have to make my choice and pick one.
---
Thank you BHVR. My faith was not misplaced. Now please stay transparent! If this ever happens again, please just let us know sooner.
---
OMG I was just thinking about how badly I wanted ruin too. Looks like my hag is staying at level 1 for a little longer.
---
 That is only because u've just started using it. The skill check zone seems to have few limited positions. U don't really have to look at the skillcheck to hit it, cuz you memorize those positions over a time.
---
  You pretty soon obtain muscle memory, and will be able to hit the skillcheck even with ur eyes closed.
---
 I know it because i got DS from recent shrine of secret. I used to miss them skillchecks at first too (felt so embaressed LOL). But then i got used to those skillchecks positions, and almost never miss them.
---
test
---
Why did Evolve lose relevance anyway?
---
Ayyy nice pun, also just try to grind this week and snag both! As an aspiring Plague main I had to get both and now grind for Dance With Me
---
It’s okay, I did worse before the rework. I always had Dying Light, Thana on my Freddy and brought a Green Mori. I... was not a very liked Freddy
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm I suspect some glitches
---
But that's specifically what his own perk Monitor &amp; Abuse is for. So he can shoot between a 12m TR and ~50m TR when you combo it with double calm.
---
She's perhaps the strongest killer in the game (after the incoming nurse nerf) so people don't like playing against her. Unlike other killers, who rely on the survivor's to make an error, the Spirit will be able to catch a survivor unless *she* makes an error. All the survivor's can do to counter her is to try and make her make the wrong read. You cannot simply loop her, or drop a pallet on her, or vault windows etc. You have to make her guess wrong, and even if she guesses wrong, it usually only buys the survivor a few more seconds before she has to make another read. And if you're injured, she doesn't even need to guess, she can just listen out for you and down you straight away. All of this is on top of her having fast travel around the map so she's constantly applying pressure on everyone. 
---
Another reason people give her hate is her add on Prayer Beads. This takes away the phasing sound she makes when invisible which essentially allows her to appear instantly next to a survivor and grab them off generators. There is very little counter-play against this. 
---
I don't think spirit is over powered. Personally I wish all of the killers had the strengths she has. But some survivors would rather just DC than learn how to counter a strong killer. Prayer beads is too much though IMO.
---
I checked the price and realized I don’t have enough money for stranger things sadly. It’s left over money from previous purchases. I can afford the other two though so I’ve narrowed it down to them. Thank you though!
---
I’d thought about this too. They do a lot of crossover marketing so it might actually happen, however I feel that if it did they would have to be the ones to approach behavior.
---
I swear this happens more than it needs to.
---
Huntress every day. I hate wraith since I'm really bad at looping so he always get a free hit
---
Not my content, but the guy's YouTube channel is pretty awesome

Thing is penny wise behaves completely different to clown. There’s a lot of cool stuff they could do with him.
---
If he is afraid of clowns, either try and play custom matches with a group of friends or make him play stealthily so he doesn’t see the killer. I understand why you want to implement this change, but I also agree with the fact that it is a horror game and it’s supposed to scare you. I understand the difference between an actual phobia and a quick scare but I seriously doubt that the community would be happy with this change. I personally love being scared by the killers as it’s part of the experience and taking away their main cosmetic designs that make them scary would probably not go down very well as many players would be irritated at having to compromise their experience in order for someone to not be scared.
---
Having We'll make it, it's enough.
---
*Event is coming out October 30*
---
OP: "oMg pOOr mE EvEnt iSN'T uNTiL ThANksgIvInG"
---
Ah yes, living the dream.
---
Inner strength is better. It's faster, you won't get seen with nurse's, and you get totems at the same time!
---
This is why anyone who plays as the killer, is really doing a public service of good 😂
---
No harm. They're just cosmetics in the end. It appeals to a couple types of people.
---
People who enjoy collecting things.
---
People who enjoy making their characters feel more 'theirs'.
---
Probably more that aren't in mind.
---
And I thought Luigi's Mansion 3 launching right on Halloween was disappointing, now they won't have Withered Blight in October?
---
They never said Haddonfield was going to get the next map rework.
---
Tbh I'd say 2-state instaheals but they're going away so....
---
They said the season would be extended. Four seasons a year is 340 days so that gives them 25/26 bonus days to work with for issues like this. 
---
It just means we’ll have a shorter break between this rift and the next one.
---
Botany Knowledge allows yourself and others get back on the fight faster.
---
You don’t have to buy it yet. If you level up on the free one and but premium all the levels from the free one will also be on the paid one. You could get to the final level in the free one, buy premium and instantly unlock everything. Just letting you know.
---
Best fake reason to derank without DC lol
---
We're all in the same boat brothers...F
---
Vigos shroud is useless. As a killer I always go to the farthest gen if I dont know the usual spawn of a map.
---
&gt; Dead by Daylight Nightmare Edition features the original award-winning game and three chapters, including the circus-themed “Curtain Call” chapter, the haunted spirit “Shattered Bloodline” chapter and the new horrifying chapter “Stranger Things,” based on the wildly popular Netflix Original Series, which allows players to utilise Steve, Nancy, and the Demogorgon.
---
&gt; In addition to these three chapters, the physical edition will also include the Headcase Cosmetic Pack, offering players a variety of trendy hairstyles and accessories to style their favourite survivor, the 80’s Suitcase, The Bloodstained Sack, Of Flesh and Mud, and The Spark of Madness add-ons.
---
Swf is needed for high ranks, you either play SWF or you lose a majority of the time.
---
Would you rather have your anti swf mode with no one playing that would eventually kill the game, or suck it up and play the game? like for real, tell me how many swfs you run into that are perfectly coordinated and impossible to beat? bc even though i dont main killer, i consistently 3-4k almost every game in red ranks.
---
I would've preferred Detective's Hunch since it's getting buffed tomorrow tbh.
---
they delayed it so they could add more bugs
---
The legion would just be generally annoying people
---
Kinda weird that it doesn't include Darkness Among Us or Demise of The Faithful (if this is accurate).
---
You have achieved a *pretty good job so far*
---
I saw.
---
Forever Freddy is still much less "oppressive" compared to a decent OG Freddy player. OG addonless Freddy slowed the game way more than New Forever Freddy can.
---
What is a mori?
---
Bond. Aftercare. Iron will. Dead hard. Inner strength. Deliverance. 2nd wind. 
---
You get the point. Absolutely NO need and it hurts your team.
---
"How dare you play spirit" This is great
---
i mean either that or you provoke an ebony mori nurse
---
&gt;To release it with bugs anyway after delaying and saying it was to fix the bugs would be ridiculous.
---
Oh you sweet sweet summer child...
---
Having a lot of fun using plague during the insta heal rush. For those out of the loop, the patch comes out tomorrow which will nerf instaheals pretty hard. With the plague there’s no healing unless you cleanse, which becomes a different problem.
---
They're from Quebec and Quebec doesn't really wanna be a part of Canada, especially politically so they're more like Quebecois Sons of Bitches.
---
Now, if i can only get it to appear in the blood web...
---
Black Box + Dying Light + Mori "Tunnel Freddy" was one of my favorite asshole builds. Usually I used a shroud of separation and if I'm lucky the obsession would DC and proc Dying Light for me.
---
For each hit you get on the obsession holding an uncommon item, gain a token. Gain 1% more BP from sacrifice. Maximum of 5 tokens
---
I’m curious if gamepass will get the nightmare edition or continue with standard. I bought most of the DLCs on sale so I can’t complain too much.
---
I just mean I don’t have the SAW chapter and all the others are from characters I have.
---
Is it just me or does the pc version have all the bugs. I get none of that good shit except lag and that dumbass egc glitch where you couldnt win and go out the map.
---
Ruin was just in the shrine a few weeks ago? Everyone already has it by now.
---
people have the right to be mad. They make empty promises and dont live up to expectations.
---
We didnt have a summer event bc they wanted 2 work on QOL and fixing the game, and they really have not done much. The only thing they actually have on time constantly is their over priced paid cosmetics, which they also pushed out even though the event wasnt done. Interesting how they pushed the cosmetics out that early huh. 
---
I will agree that BHVR not overworking their staff is a great attribute and i can let some shit slide bc of that. But if there was any legit competition then they will actually get fucked.
---
That would be super fun
---
Nah Wraith is worse, a smart Trapper can destroy people even in Red Ranks a Wraith barely works winthout a gimmicky build
---
Happened to me just now on the Switch version. I was the fifth one...
---
Everybody gangsta till No Mither David joins the lobby
---
What's forever freddy
---
Getting useless add ons is on purpose. If you could sell them Back, even for the fraction of the price people could level up way to quickly. Not that this is a problem, but this is what I imagine the devs did it for.
---
For all of you who don’t already own it, Dance With Me is a fantastic perk. It even gets better when you pair it with perks such as windows of opportunity, quick and quiet, and especially lithe to get more distance out of your 3 seconds of no scratch marks.
---
What is taking this picture lol
---
As a killer I can confirm that.
---
Those hits has always pissed me off. And has made me feel bad when I’m killer as well and see this happening lol
---
I prefer them being skins, I dont want to be called sweaty for just playing my main that somehow became super OP bc of a stat update, or have my main have a negative attribute that conflicts with my play style.
---
I say this for everyone of these post, but this would be a decent to pretty good idea if it was like this since launch, but doing it now would disturb 2 much shit.
---
How do you point as a survivor? (Googling is showing me results for points.)
---
It is great for plague, i love it forces them to cleanse or take the speed hit its win win.
---
I hate them too. I was speechless after this happened. 
---
This also happened to Monto. He posted it on Twitter.
---
But it’s coming tomorrow
---
prime time for this meme is over now
---
We need more secret offerings.
---
Yeah this meme has expired. Sorry.

I know queue dodging is bad, but when i see swf who all have over 300 bours and 1 guy with 5 hours i sure as hell am gonna dodge, im a rank 18 killer, bullying is not fun. Not saying all swfs with 1 guy with under 20 hours are bullys but every swfthat i met was like that.
---
Same rip
---
The amount of bitching due to players saying they just levelled up The Hag is horrendous lol.
---
It's how you role play Freddy in DBD.
---
All we need is Jason
---
*stalking intensifies*
---
so let me get this straight..
---
you want her to not collide, to not see scratch marks or any environment change and be deaf..oh and slower too while phasing. you want the fucking freddy treatment.. imagine thinking being able to see the scratch marks is a problem WHEN SHE CANT SEE SURVIVORS IN THE FIRST PLACE WHEN PHASING
---
what a survivor only player, entitled and delusional you are.. if you want to have such an easy game play minecraft.. in creative mode, so you won't even bother to try to survive. God damn..
---
&gt;WHAT THE FUCK I JUST GOT THE HAG TO 35
---
If you have a character, leveling him to unlock his teachables is always a better choice than spending shards. This is why you should never "shrine buy" teachables that belong to free characters.
---
It takes considerably less time to grind 1.000.000 bloodpoints than to grind 2.000 shards.
---
Save your shards for cosmetics or teachables that belong to DLCs you have zero interest in buying.
---
Here is the math for anyone interested:
---
To gain 2.000 Iridescent Shards from level 1 to 17, you need 31.020 XP. Considering you gain an average of 400 XP per match, you'd have to play **77 matches.** If you manage to earn 500 xp per match, thats still **62 matches.** 
---
To gain 2.000 Iridescent Shards from level 50 to 57, you need 29.400 XP. Considering you gain an average of 400 XP per match, you'd have to play **74 matches.**
---
If you start at any level, the total XP to get 2.000 Iridescent Shards is always between 28k to 30k [Player level rewards
---
](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1411397835).
---
Now, playing killer with nothing but BBQ and averaging 25k bloodpoints per match, you get to 1.000.000 bloodpoints in roughly **20 matches**. Even less if you start using 100% bonus offerings or come across survivors using party streamers.
---
Lmao I had a Nurse using NOED and Rancor (prob the most overkill combo I've seen so far in an actual serious match). I was pretty happy looping her and thought “Okay, I think I can afford a hit and escape”
---
Heh.
---
*allegedly.
---
Doesn’t he get detected by spine now though? And premonition?
---
Huntress is annoying af in my opinion. It’s become a meme how messed up the axe throw hit box is. Huntress throws an axe and it’s almost guaranteed to hit the survivor, doesn’t matter where she was aiming. I personally would rather face wraith even though they do camp hooks a lot.
---
How did you escape? If it was through the hatch, it doesn't count towards that ritual. It must be through the exit gate.
---
I did two dailys a few hours ago. Unhook survivors and chase survivors for 180 seconds
---
Huntress since she is a top tier i love to play against... when BHVR doesnt decide to hate me. But personally i would love to play highly skilled billys 24/7. Idk if its just me but billys with good curving abilitys are a test of skill from both the survivor and killer, so much fun :D
---
Because the passive still works even if you're exhausted, making certain parts in certain maps easier to loop.
---
Exactly. Four petrified oaks with purple toolboxes, saboteur, breakdown, flip flop and boil over.
---
I really wish they would hurry up and nerf ruined already because I am so fucking tired of it being in every single game and my whole team getting wiped or worse being the 1st to die while I looked for the dam totem
---
Bring it on
---
&gt;Xx\_Godlooper420\_xX
---
I should use that Username.
---
Yes!! Kinda late to say but check twitter!!!
---
Unforeseen
---
Easier to loop and reduce stun time when falling even when exhausted
---
I would expect this to be a hit given that it was a slow vault.
---
Consider how latency and server side versus client side position works. To the Spirit, you had probably just barely gone through the window, you weren't clear of the normal swing zone through windows.
---
This is common knowledge for people who regularly play killer.
---
For the love of god, please have a fix for the NAT type issue on consoles.
---
There are almost always more than one places to drop off of in the every given map with the exception of like 2. The decreased stun from falls is the main attraction of the perk. Going off a drop is usually a death sentence otherwise and can turn things like building drops and tractors into infinite’s or new loop locations. Even without the first burst of speed it is pretty damn good.
---
Hey I know I'm kinda late, but here are some facts from a Pig main that will make you kinda sad.
---
&gt;unnerving presences, distressing
---
Unnerving Presence ***does not*** work on Jigsaw Boxes. Why? I don't know, but Jigsaw Boxes cannot be affected in any way, including Hex: Third Seal, Thanatophobia, Dying Light etc. (except by maybe Hex: Huntress Lullaby, but I haven't checked that yet, and either way you don't have it :P )
---
&gt;run that on The Game
---
*In my opinion,* I think a larger map would be better for this build, since Survivors would have to walk longer distances to get to boxes. Red Forest or The Swamp are great.
---
Also, remember that Survivors will still be able to remove RBTs with Rule Set 2 when they can't see the auras. I played a match against a Pig with RS2 and was able to remove my RBT really early because I knew were the Boxes were, even without the auras being on yet.
---
&gt;Anyone have a better build?
---
Amanda's Letter + Last Will with as many slowing down gens perks you have (Hex: Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, Pop Goes the Weasel etc.) so you can have time to do it twice with the 2 RBTs you have.
---
Amanda's Letter makes it so that there's only 2 Jigsaw Boxes, so, as soon as the person with the RBT gets unhooked, go and crouch in front of one of the boxes so they can't use it. Now there's a 50% chance of them dying, since they can only search one of the boxes, and if the box you're protecting has the key, then well...💀
---
ALSO DON'T USE ADDONS THAT INCREASE THE TIME IT TAKES TO SEARCH JIGSAW BOXES! Crate of Gears (Very Rare) only increases by 3.6 seconds. Addons that increase the chance of getting skillchecks at boxes only increase by 1% (Workshop Grease) and 2% (Razor Wires).
---
I never liked the idea of a clown killer. its so generic and boring, every time i say that i get met with "bUT hE cAN tRANSfORM" like he will be able to do that in game. 
---
even the current clown we have is super boring, he is just babys first huntress.
---
I'm confused about the insta-heal nerf, whats happening to them?
---
Last week I said that Killer’s were on a roll because they got Pop, Spirit fury, and discordance. I guess they still are.
---
This is a nice welcome for Nintendo Switch players
---
It was so close to perfection
---
But what can you do against toxic survivors who hits you..?
---
Alt Accounts. They probably have every perk they want on each and keep rotating so they stay below rank 15. Even if they win they probably DC just enough so they don’t pass the threshold.
---
I play DBD maybe once a week with friends who play often. So I guess you can call me a noob, what’s the meta for survivors?
---
Same. Yesterday.
---
Wow! I really wish we could all be as skilled and lucky as you!
---
I can't wait to farm Clown's outfit. I've been wanting it since I saw the leaks for it.
---
could be your wifi. i just got done playing a few rounds as killer. check your connection, or restart your router
---
Can confirm. OG Freddy's general strat was to quite literally waste everybody's time. Even though his actual chase boiled down to basic M1 killer, he could drag the game out so long via "Sleep Juggling" and constantly switching targets it didn't matter: Even if he could be looped, EVENTUALLY all the pallets would be dropped and broken, then survivors were fucked.
---
I believe the purple instaheal will grant a BT effect, and the Syringe will grant one health state after a certain amount of time.
---
I forgot please don’t bully me 😭
---
I slow vaulted because I thought it she was phasing. I thought I got away, but obviously not. 
---
I might have froze for a second on her end while in mid vault action, then finished vaulting.
---
When she saw me stop in mid action, she swung.
---
I’m just guessing that’s what happened.
---
And I just got nurse to 35 :(
---
The first time I saw this happen was in an EdgarAlanBRO stream. The Insidious Leatherface was nowhere to be found he was in the basement where he had franklins demise knocked a flashlight on the ground and LF sat there guarding the flashlight. The rest of the game turned into an intense desire for the survivors to escape with the item and it became known as Frankilin's Football. The idea of camping the chest evolved from if no survivor brings an offering you use a cut coin and camp the basement chest as it will be the only item in the game. Its about Franklin's demise
---
It's starting to get a little crowded here.
---
The real MVP. Thanks for the tips man, hopefully I can suck all this info up
---
perk 3 is too op try this
---
Standing Aviation: If a survivor takes three steps, they become exposed for 9999minutes.
---
Depends on the map. On Haddonfield and The Game its awesome, but on some maps like yamaoka estates its pretty meh. 
---
I run too much from gen to gen to want sprint burst, Lithe is cool in certain builds, but for general play it won't be super useful, if I use dead hard one more time, but lay on the ground exhausted anyway I'm going to rage, and while head on is fun to use, I don't find it as useful as balanced.
---
Every time I say I’m using thanata on Freddy people will basically scoff about it on this sub. I’m glad to see it’s getting recognition.
---
Freddy running a slow build. Ruin, Thanatophobia, Dying Light, slow when asleep addons, etc. They all stack and made gens take significantly longer.
---
Be the sponge
---
Its only this game though which is weird, ive been playing rdr2 all day and no problems but when i queue it kicks me from the servers. Ill mess with my wifi anyway though
---
Would have been more unique if it was some form of collage of as many killers as possible.
---
Still really neat.
---
&gt;sloppy nurses
---
😳
---
I can't wait to see how broken sounds are *this* time!
---
I have both and have the same amount of fun with them. I'm a huge halloween fan though, so if I could only buy one it would be michael.
---
Wow! A cornfield juke? Unheard of! /s
---
odd. good luck.
---
Do you mean Pip as in rank up or “get points” like bloodpoints?
---
Yep. Thumbs up clown is still a thing.
---
What are you gonna do?
---
trapper is carrying demogordon to hook him, and demo is like "SAME TEAM SAME TEAM"
---
Great. Only the 1,543,490,355,210,455th time being posted here.
---
The power of the press triumphs
---
I've been meaning to get back into this game but it's been so toxic lately that I've had to hold off. I find it difficult to return to a game that is so draining and stressful
---
YES MASTER BEEEEEEEEEEEEECH
---
I can't believe they will actually release it in time for halloween.
---
First time I've seen it. Oh well.
---
I like the one she has already too...
---
What he did, while being a dick move, was perfectly in line with the rules of the game. Sandbagging your team and targeting players from previous games are both against the rules.
---
Wow! That is literally one of the most stupid arguments I have ever read! Everyone who has read your comment is now worse for it and let me tell you why! 
---
Firstly, you state that you: " dont want to be called sweaty for just playing my main that somehow became super OP bc of a stat update". You realise that people are going to think that you are "sweaty" anyways because meta perks exist and you probably use at least one of them. 
---
Secondly, you state that this idea would be pretty good : " if it was like this since launch, but doing it now would disturb 2 much shit." That is a textbook example of appealing to tradition. If anything, that is a reason to change!
---
I’m pretty sure the new Laurie cosmetics are supposed to come tomorrow, but it’s possible they got pushed back with the event delay and all
---
dbd is on the switch? /s
---
I have a personal hatred for trapper so I’m usually running saboteur just to destroy his traps. I’ll even do them all before I even touch gens just so they understand the extent of my hate
---
On console, it is the waving and pointing are the directional pad by default. On pc, it’s 1 and 2 on the keyboard.
---
Those are the dumb doctors, also, thats annoying  to you?
---
Thank you for the response
---
Hey, that's pretty good. Trapper gazing upon what he's become?
---
Thank you for the link!

You said you'd never forget...

How? When a rank one drops and does not play for months or comes back to play? How when’s killer can wire with friends and farm ? How is it when a good player carries a friend? Please tell me how it’s absurd? I can loop and kill and I’m considered good yet I don’t care about pipping ? I don’t see it absurd when you have so many ways to be red ranked with very little effort. So rethink that. If you don’t know this or aware of it give it time.
---
Yes please!
---
1 person healing an injured person: 2 people using up 16 seconds, for a total to 32 wasted seconds.
---
1 person self-caring with botany and 1 person repairing gens: 24 seconds wasted.
---
Its broken, and I dont know why they dont remove it yet, or fix it properly
---
You've got a lotta spirit, coming out and asking that question.
---
Yep. I should have left the lobby I had last night where the other three team mates were all Claudettes.
---
Was chased by killer for a long time in Gas Heaven, looped him through the building half a dozen times, then over to the car with the pallet, around that several times. There was enough time to do two more gens when I was getting chased.
---
But when I got hooked, I see the silhouette of all three Claudettes crouching on the other side of the map, all together. Not even working on a gen, just hiding when the killer isn't even there. What the fuck?
---
Makes me want to suicide on the hook.
---
[removed]
---
Well I never expected it to include the licensed ones in the first place, same reason you can’t buy with shards. They need you to buy them so they can give a cut of the profits to the license holders
---
Kyf is a great place to learn loops in, just have a friend mess around with you on loops as you go from loop to loop, helped me out a lot.
---
Lol people here are happy for this but it just means we're still gonna get a shit update because BHVR still hasn't gotten their shit together.
---
BHVR kind of get around this now with the Shrine. But yeah, technically it is pay to win
---
It is including them though, apparently.
---
I may need some help over here
---
With each update opinions on them are harsher and harsher and right now I'm honestly fine with calling them downright retarded.
---
The stalking is broken on dedicated servers, and can be bullyied easy if survivors know how to play around it
---
I would argue that would make it too strong. A big part of killer pressure is time wasted healing, especially in calling / thanato builds. The ability for 2 survivors to heal each other 1:1 with no outside help would mean a far stronger heal over time ratio than self care, botany knowledge, and puts it on speed with We’ll Make It, which is on a limited time window.
---
Imo I may be ranked 9 but nobody goes nurse but the people who do go nurse are either farmers or really sweaty
---
I think hag is fun :(
---
Empathy and bond super underrated. Nothing makes me pip harder than teamwork points :^)
---
I seem to have touched a nerve. 
---
The Dick Show is a podcast, not an actual show. You listen to those, not watch it.
---
The Babdook and Heridatary are both considered “lazy” horror movies. Case in point the directors latest project “Midsommer.”
---
Don’t take Reddit comments so seriously. I can also look through your post history and giggle at the fact you take Runescape seriously.
---
*giggles* You would have been ridiculed tremendously at my college had that fact been brought to light.
---
Why do you have to tell him what to do? He is proud let him have his moment. I don’t see why other players need to crush others and gatekeep then tell others how to play a game that needs to be worked on. Be nice and don’t be that survivor who quotes how to play the game to a killer.
---
Nah although his detect seems weird sometimes it works sometimes it does not. Only thing I hate about him is the players that play him honestly so many dick heads
---
Is it confirmed that the patch will be out tomorrow?
---
The most useless combo has to go to devoured hope and make your choice
---
I didn't, I'm very glad it's here now.
---
Yeah, I cant wait to play it with my girlfriend
---
it happens to me all the fucking time. i hate it.
---
of course
---
People find this kinda hard, I think it's actually fun to do. But “Chain Blink Hits”? 
---
Nope. Thanks, I'll pass
---
I used to feel the same. Now after 2 years of playing I think it’s a wasted perk slot. It takes forever to self care. Bring in a med kit if you want to heal. I’ll use plunderers and ace in the hole and pharmacy to farm some good med kits sometimes.
---
What is the "it" you're referring to?
---
I went ahead and bought it now. We only get 2 free outfits from event (besides nurse outfit) so I’m gonna get plague and Jake through event bought Clown Spirit and Hag now.
---
TBH it's strong but you can still work through it. Even with Swing Chains you only get like a 15% slow total, which is no worse than... well, Thanata.
---
It does get a little top heavy when combined with Thanata and Dying Light but even then it's still counterable. I just see too many Survivors that watch Freddy get 1 stack of Dying Light and go "gg game over OP no fun build" and suicide. "Sleeping IRL" Freddy is no worse than Nurse, Instasaw Billy, or Prayer Beads Spirit. At least there's a degree of counterplay, even if that counterplay boils down to "don't go down 4head."
---
IF IT GLOWS, IT GOES!NO EXCEPTIONS
---
I have this frequent issue as well as the one that up and CHANGES my daily between games. Even when I complete them. It also seems to do it between lobby’s such as searching for match and then finding one.
---
Yes this is just how it is.  Unless you're going to squad up, you're not going to get a whole lot of success as survivor how it is now.
---
Oh, sure, it's fine for beginners. But the OP never specified that they were new.
---
Yes.
---
Well. Ty for the imput. I am still kinda noob. I would day you are right. It has been doing next to nothing on my last games. I already have a BP perk and this one seems to waste an other perk slot that could improve my gameplay a bit. I will probably look forward to BT.
---
About the last perk, yes, I realize the smart move would be something to help me in chases but I have yet to find a perk I like for it.
---
Might give it a try. Learning map's layout without pressure must be nice
---
Lol I love how people are framing the issue as this when in reality the issue was not saying anything about problems until 17 hours before event drop and then saying they don't know when it'll be out
---
From rank 16-20, the game will open the search pools as there’s not enough killer/survivors. Once you get to higher ranks you’ll almost always be paired with similar ranks.
---
Nah because none of those perks are as strong as NOED. Many killers rely on NOED and then wonder why they can't keep up with actually good survivors later on. It's because NOED encourages being less aggressive with patrols since "oh well I can just NOED them later".
---
Freddy is fine as is
---
This gives me hope. :D
---
This guy doesn't browse by new.
---
&gt;Yeah I figured that out but still it sucks quite a lot to be killer for the first time only to get survivors who pretty much know what they’re doing against you
---
Is either that or infinite queue time trying to find survivors. A lot of people rather just play and try to improve as fast as they can.
---
Is there a good video somewhere describing The Archives?
---
I’m a little busy!
---
Thanks! Gonna try that out when I play next time. If I have those lol
---
That’s why I leveled the Hag; I figured that Ruin wouldn’t be back in the shrine for a good long while.
---
This didn't age well

[Dev Stream](https://youtu.be/q_fWpF83JEE?t=1168)
---
Dunno who he is, but let me be the killer who quotes how to play the game to a killer. 
---
Bragging about a 4K at rank 15 while using NOED is the equivalent to Kanye bragging about scoring 100 points against a wheelchair basketball team
---
At 16 meters, he is. At 16-32 meters, he appears randomly.
---
Oh yeah, I’m definitely going to get her to 40 for Devour, but I’m annoyed because I spent the last week and a half grinding my ass off for Ruin only for it to appear here.
---
Right if they can’t take any heat or even acknowledge it they aren’t good at their job
---
Freddy is completely fine as he is
---
Well the queue time is still pretty infinite even like that, But i figured that out, my pc would be on fire by the time they’d find someone my level anyways but it’s still a little bit upsetting to lose so much at the start because they know how to juke you by rank 16 already
---
What’s wrong with that, he’s in a good place atm. People are happy and not crying about him being strong or weak
---
Really good if you combo with Lithe
---
I guess this is a bonus for console we dont have chat
---
Use Small Game or a pink map
---
Removed for uncivil
---
What
---
THAT was my only gripe about it. I hated that I came home from work late at night, hours before bed, and reading that it was last-minute delayed.
---
Otherwise I don’t really care. I’m just glad it’s here before Halloween night. It sucks there was a delay, but holy shit people are leaving some hurtful comments.
---
I think BHVR as of recently has been really trying to turn things around. The whole ‘roadmap’ and seeing how excited McCote was to have Stranger Things in DbD shows they really have big things in mind and a ton of passion for the future of the game. People just need to give them time.
---
Really? I didn’t know that
---
Dance With Me is okay-ish with certain perks tho
---
Already do. Ruin still needs a Nerf
---
When your friend says the killers got noed but you’re already dead: I missed the part where that’s my problem
---
But only one survivor is. And all 4 get the information
---
They *might* have put Ruin in the shrine to settle people a little, but it's always a welcome perk. 
---
Especially because Nintendo Switch players need it still, that's probably the reason.
---
I'd really like to see "quirks" added to the survivors. Low impact pseudo-perks that modify gameplay in a way that enhances/emphasizes the Survivor's personality. Your Dwight is a fantastic example: Finding empty lockers isn't strong, nobody is going to pick him JUST for that, but it's nice and reminds you that you are a Dwight.
---
I don't want them to be extreme though: David is a good example of that, "Do What You Do Best" would guarantee every David would have Unbreakable/Decisive/Dead Hard. And losing a perk slot isn't fun... ideally, the negative would pose an interesting challenge, without reducing fun.
---
(btw I did spot "megative" and I did LOL)
---
Not all SWFs are toxic though. The vast majority isnt.
---
It's true my love, go nuts
---
Nah, it's fine.
---
That's why I'm not proposing a hard rework. I'm basically changing how the sleep ability is applied, plus adding a few passives for balancing.
---
No its op
---
Damn, simple yet pretty nice editing
---
Yeah he's super fun to play and play against. Check truetalent to see how to use it in the most efficient way (playstyle) since he's power is kinda meh if used normally
---
Agreed. Freddy's pretty much ok, but it still feels weird that you can see him at a certain distance while awake. If the survivors are really experiencing micro-sleeps, then the survivor's POV needs to look like the dreamworld does when they can see Freddy during the flickering, just like Nancy experienced during the drug store scene in the movie.
---
Usually if I'm playing against a really inexperienced killer, I'll try to drop some advice on the way out.
---
There was a doctor one time that chased me for probably 5 minutes without downing me because he kept shocking at loops that were too long. I told him it's better to just chase through those and that shocking me removed bloodlust and made him slower in general, and he was super appreciative.
---
I try not to be condescending ever, unless they start shit talking and I'll banter a little bit before leaving. Sometimes you just gotta get anger out and I always find banter fun post game.

Thanks for the math breakdown! I’m someone who only buys shrine perks for characters I don’t have or if they’re really good perks (like I’ve only purchased Discordance and Pop since I don’t own those DLCs). That being said, it’s still really frustrating to spend the time and effort grinding a character to a certain level only for the perk to appear on the shrine right after you hit your goal, even if it’s economically better in the long run.
---
No. For a simple thing, people will use only the best one and ignore the rest and I don't wanna play some other survivors to be competitive or seen as a troll just because I wanna pick my Feng, for example
---
Won’t this make Spine Chill and Premonition work on T1 Myers?
---
No /s at all. Unlike the junior high kids running around on this sub, I’m inclined to sack up and welcome challenges. You can continue pushing a bullshit narrative that a killer who doesn’t play by your rules is super op. I get it. It’s a winning strategy. Devs will listen to your whimpering. But I’m not gonna push out the canned responses (insert your favorite streamer) has fed to you.
---
It's both
---
They’re better, still not good. Embarrassing compared to most other dev teams.
---
Oh look, a buff
---
I’ll never understand why people need to go through such lengths to validate themselves through a game.
---
You played really well? Awesome, say gg and move on.
---
You played poorly and died? Dang, sucks, say gg and move on.
---
If people would stop treating every action in game as a personal insult to them, DBD would be a much nicer game to play.
---
Prayer beads are some baloney. Should make no noise while outside terror radius but make the vacuum noise while inside it. Make a trade off between in-chase and out-of-chase strength.
---
Wraith was Johnny bravo in former life
---
When you kill an teammate
---
Two exhaustion perks, meh

Freddy is fine as is give the attention to characters that actually need it. -_-
---
As a killer main, please bring SC and heal yourself in the corner for the equivalent of half a generator. Everyone please do this. All the time.
---
I really don't understand Reddit sometimes. People downvote posts asking for help (experieced it myself)
---
wtf.
---
Sorry, can't trust killers anymore. Lol i've had it happen twice where I crouched to surrender as last survivor, didn't struggle hoping they would take me to the hatch, they did, dropped me at the hatch, closed the hatch, then mori'd me. u_u
---
I'll still never teabag though.
---
Yep
---
What is meta
---
Sorry for scamming poopy drawings today.
---
Dead Hard is only good against new killers, thus medium to low tier
---
Change my mind
---
His massive shoulder span constantly prevents his tiny malnourished ass from absorbing sunlight. His body is essentially at war with its self
---
I really like how you all got cute quotes like your winning a convo. Guys let’s be clear your trying to tell a kid how to play a game and crush his  accomplishment for what? To feel your way is better ?? There in the game stop shaming people for what they do brother killer to killer ;)
---
A more iconic duo? The same people but they BOTH have either ds or ooo
---
Yeah I’ve been having a lot of fun with it lately !
---
"Some rare obscure bug" xD Another one to add to the colection.
---
I always get healed by other players when I need it. It's just a bad perk that wastes a lot of time and it teaches bad habits.
---
The one that hides her aura when she is crouched
---
i mean, if you start with ‘in the real world’ i think your point is already stupid
---
Wait.. what? She already make no noise at base kit while in terror radius, make an add on to do the opposite is kinda dumb
---
I get it change the add on, I'm in for it, but that isn't the way. Just something that's not related with her phasing sound all together would be fine
---
But can you still see ghosty boi while he stalks with object?
---
Quentin isn't real, he's just another dwight skin but dwight is tired

&gt;No /s at all. Unlike the junior high kids running around on this sub, I’m inclined to sack up and welcome challenges.

You dont seem to have a counter argument

please can someone find me this meme template, I've been searching forever trying to find it but nonmatter what I search up it never comes up anywhere. Did you just custom draw this?!
---
r/woosh?
---
the bottom part really isn’t needed lmao
---
As far as game breaking bugs go it's definitely possible to release an update without one. But as far as just small things go like minor audio or visual issues it's impossible to release an update without one.
---
Yes, a perk that can be taken away from you in the first Minute of the game is OP. A perk that literally can be negated by hitting great skill checks is op. As someone who plays both sides I'm confident it's not OP, and if you think it is, you're in the minority.
---
I see everyone call on latency which is what i overall assessed it to, but the reason i call dedicated servers is because it is a different latency then what we would run normally and makes it feel like things are way more off than normal, which overall just makes funny things like this happen. Thanks for all the comments tho!

The grind has already been lowered  again. 3 perks in a blood web = way fewer bloodwebs you have to grind for to 100% a character
---
Welp, people downvotes just for telling them to get good against spirit. I guess the hate boner this sub has against spirit is huge while Nurse is being ignored
---
You guys should get the same treatment that killers had since 2016. **just adapt** as you guys said and would've said in that time until now, follow your own suggestion ;)
---
Freddy is a top 3-4 killer right now.  He doesn't need anything right now.  He's awesome as is.
---
All those times you're on your second hook and they're halfway across the map self caring...no, I'm not salty at all about SC or Urban, why do you ask?
---
This.
---
Yes it can be taken away from you in the 1st man in a game if someone is lucky enough to spawn next to it which never happens it can  Navigated by hitting a perfect skill check which is difficult to do multiple times in a row 
---
Its OP.  I don't care if I'm in the minority sometimes the minority is right and in this case it is.
---
Yeah he was a hard to master but when mastered was really good and slowed down the game when I I got p2 Freddy before the rework
---
I mean yeah, that’s it. Sorry if a killer using their senses irks you. Play unpredictably. Don’t hug corners, make weird ass movements, bring perks that compensate for your playstyle’s weaknesses or augment its strengths. 
---
Play spirit and pay attention to what you’re looking for and you’ll have a good idea of what other spirits are. No, it’s not a guaranteed trick to get those sick/nasty 5-gen chases. But it’ll buy you a minute and change and that’s really enough for a single hook state.
---
It's funny when a survivor says you're bad because you are using "crutch perks" while their running all of the meta perks with an insta heal. Like sorry let me go equip Monstrous Shrine and sit in a corner while you gen rush me.
---
I mean we're honestly talking about the difference between something usable and enjoyable, and completely and utterly broken. Have some respect for the devs. They're taking a lot of heat for this and I'm sure they're not doing it just to torture us.
---
&gt; Yes it can be taken away from you in the 1st man in a game if someone is lucky enough to spawn next to it which **"never happens"**
---
...That proves to me you don't play killer.
---
&gt; *Nagated by hitting a perfect skill check which is difficult to do multiple times in a row
---
A gen taking 21-28 more seconds, whatever shall we do.
---
&gt; Its OP. I don't care if I'm in the minority sometimes the minority is right and in this case it is. 
---
Your mind is clearly not changeable, yep guess it's OP then. very Op indeed.
---
I am, check their Twitter.
---
I had it happen multiple times in one day. It was Doctor, then healing others, then saving others as Nancy, then sacrificing as Wraith. 
---
...and such are the Entity’s demands.
---
When tomorrows update goes out the in game news will have the exact time and dates. 
---
So far we believe it will end around November 13th but we’ll know for sure when the in game news updates tomorrow.
---
A ding ding, baby.
---
I shall
---
Awfully bold of you to think it will last a month. People will forget about this within the week as long as they update and event are good and they're having fun.
---
Trying to play the game as "only support" is awful and you are pulling down your entire team by trying to make this work.
---
So they do move in heards.
---
Youre either or
---
its weird that we dont, but i dont think i want more till moris are nerfed. bc i dont feel like Alt+ f4'ing every other game
---
The stagger reduction works even when exhausted is pretty much the reason. A lot of maps have places where you can loop the killer almost endlessly without even using a pallet.
---
Nah this meme was posted before the announcement and I posted just after the announcement
---
Deadhard and being a buggy PoS that doesn't work when you need it.
---
The event is coming out today...
---
I don't get why the DC. They gonna lose the flashlight, better bring a ward then.
---
Well have I got news for you
---
Right on, thanks.
---
We are watching.
---
If shrine is random each week then maybe not, but if it's somewhat balanced that all perks roll thru each cycle and no dupes then definetly (unless just gold luck and the cycle ended this or last week) cause ruin was there i think 4 weeks ago
---
Servers are testing on pc again
---
You get into lobbies?
---
Ah yes, by saving my teammates from the hook or being hooked I am pulling them down. By willingly putting myself in harm's way so they may get away and do generators I am making it so they cannot escape. Just because I'm playing support doesn't mean I'm not also fixing generators, big brain.
---
...um, ok? OP is under the impression that Haddonfield is *guaranteed* to be the next rework. I am simply telling OP that that was not confirmed. What are you trying to accomplish?
---
Great work. Can we go back and look all the posts complaining about the delay? 
---
Also, thank You for using ET not UTC time.
---
My favorite is when you try to recover after that and in .02 seconds there’s another one as soon as you let go and you just got tagteamed by those failed skill checks.

*sees the p3 blendette squad* *equips noed, franklins, mori and BBQ*
---
It's not insulting to you if you expect me to simply take your word for it. You speak of ignorance but expect strangers to just accept your word for fact. That would also be ignorance.
---
Tomorrow will be a sad day for us switch players
---
I got into one now but switching to killer than survivor
---
I'm not saying he's underpowered. I'm simply proposing they make him more true to the lore.
---
Lol welcome to an online forum.
---
You can, I have glass splinters on the pig.
---
This pleases me greatly
---
Now we watch as the wild Ghostface stalks the herd as they continue to feed on their generators
---
Is this really true?
---
Do people use "only the best"? If that would be true, I'm pretty sure I would only fight against and with Claudettes with super dark clothing. But I'm not, even though it's stealthy and for this would be the "best" choice.
---
already posted bud.
---
Yay! But also going to wait until y'all confirm it works without my PS4 exploding.
---
The team made the deadline, kudos.
---
This template is too good to exist
---
Glad someone spotted it! 
---
But yes, I agree, the quirks should be very minor things. Something that doesn't affect a lot of games but fits the personality of a character. A lot of my examples are way too powerful, I agree.
---
“It's a good map” hit me hard. I'm fighting for Red Ranks and I keep getting those fucking Yamaokas and Pale Roses
---
Hard agree, but that one Deathsquad match can surely destroy your mood enough to quit playing Killer for a week if hit unprepared
---
Said with BBQ&amp;Chilli. That gives you up to 100 % if you hook all 4 survs at least once.
---
*Cries in Jason*
---
I'm bad at looping so I always try sneaking around and doing gens so I guess I'm not a blendette but I still classify myself as a blendette. Also my friend is a Dwight main so I always do gens with him because he runs prove thyself and leader. Any other time I'm not playing with him I bring a tool box and do gens.
---
As far as I know supernatural isnt as bad as dbd and MK11 is in term of age ratings, and was toned down in that episode as well. WB owns Mortal Kombat and scooby doo and didnt even let their own company use it, I doubt theyd let dbd.
---
To be fair if you put her yellow range addon you basically always are
---
When's it scheduled?
---
My batteries ran out mid game and while looking for more my buddy and the other 2 survs died, when i came back the freddy was waiting for me to get into the hatch
---
Yeah trust me I agree. I believe most of the meta perks are mediocre at best and are only held to the level they are because they're fucking amazing as crutches.
---
What do you mean you don't know if it's probably a repost or not you're the one who took it lol
---
You must have lagged. Happens to me sometimes, not something to worry about
---
This is gonna sound dumb but which perk is WMI exactly? lol I'm a bit lost here.
---
Totally forgot about that part of bbq. Never play killer anymore cause of the insane queue times.
---
I prefer Overcharge or Pop goes the weasel.
---
Those feel fair to use for me, and also aren´t tied to RNG
---
Probaly something from the movies as most of their villains are solo appearances in one episode/ direct to dvd movie. 
---
The newer scooby doo series (mystery incorporated I think it was called? Idk the one with crystal cove) does have recurring villains however, the chapter would be best as a solo survivor.

---
I tweeted that they should do a collaboration not to long ago and Crypt Tv liked it... so fingers crossed we get a killer and some cosmetics (PLEASE SUNNY FAMILY CULT LEGION!!!!)
---
Footsteps are louder if they are close enough to blind you.
---
Found it on google
---
Yeah, hatch is too easy. Make it where you have to open it and jump in like half the gate opening time. Instant get away is too easy and people DCing to "give someone the hatch" is ridiculous.
---
They keep that set except for the lips though, when you DC
---
Damn it. Lol
---
What in holy hell is that Twitter font?
---
Just keep practicing and before you know it you'll be hitting the great skill checks everytime even when Ruin is out. A tip though is if you miss a skillcheck, stop repairing the gen for 2-3 seconds, then hop back on if its safe. For those 2-3 seconds after a miss, the gen won't make progress and you risk another back to back skill check. You'll get it! I used to be horrible with them, on top of watching for killers, now I can hit great ones nearly every time.
---
&gt;gives me hope
---
This is the direct opposite of what Hags give you.
---
Since rift arrives tomorrow, i have a question. Can i fully complete rift on the free track, then buy rift pass and get all premium staff instantly since rift is complete?
---
Is this meant more for console players though? Because it costs 9000 iridescent shards to get the plague on PC. At this point, it’s more worth getting the perk in the shrine, rather than buying the killer and grinding for the perk as well.
---
Finally a reason to live!
---
Does the ghostface costume come out with this?
---
I can’t
---
you misspelled Nea´s
---
Its like when the game starts and everyone keeps asking, "who is the killer?", but no one ever asks, "How is the killer?".
---
Lol very good meme, great job
---
If that’s how they want to design the game then yes
---
No one knows for sure yet but I think it’s scheduled for first or second week of November.
---
Or, alternatively, matchmaking is awful and I'm never matched with survivors my rank? (Well, it's gotten way better recently, and instead I, a rank 11 Myers, consistently get matched with purple and red rank survivors)
---
People suggest the Look-See all the time. Usually alongside James A. Janisse as a survivor.
---
Fair enough.
---
That's a little overkill, using the entirety of your 4 perk slots aimed solely for window vaults.
---
Getting a full blendette squad be like
---
yup.. while also de-pipping..
---
they think it is more fun if they depip together with 1-2survivor. especially if he got the 2 sacrifice daily ritual. 3 bird with 1 stone.
---
Ok thanks
---
If anything, killers WANT survivors to run self care because it's so bad
---
Well before no detection worked on T1 Myers. I just hope he gets his own Undetectable because him being so unique is what makes him so fun
---
I dont run it a lot. That being said I've NEVER hit a DS dont @ me
---
“Listen here you little shit, I’m Michael fucking Myers. My franchise is the only horror franchise to have survived since the 70s. You came from a Netflix show and haven’t achieved even an iota of the success that I have. I built modern horror, survived gunshots, took down loads of people, survived getting blown up twice, once by dynamite and once by a gas leak being ignited. I’ve been hit by cars, and survived two remakes, while you got killed by a bald chick with psychic powers, and got your ass whooped by a bunch of kids. My rivalry is legendary. I am legendary. My theme song is iconic enough that all you need to hear is the mention of it to know what’s up. You fought against, and died to, a bunch of kids. Your theme isn’t even your own. I’m one of a kind and pure fucking evil. You? You’re replaceable, so get your flower lookin mouth off me, or so help me Entity, I will fucking rip them off and punt your ass all the way to Stranger Things. I’m Michael fucking Myers, bitch. Compared to me? You are nothing.”
---
Iri heads are only a problem with the infantry belts, chainsaws are arguably balanced, noed's bs and needs a nerf, and devour hope actually requires the killer to do something and probably needs a buff if anything
---
Only if you're in a 4 man SWF
---
Wait, whats that?
---
I actually think hunter is completely OP once you learn the boost mechanics and have decent tracking chases don't last 2 minutes they last 2 seconds. Bit there's a sarcasm flair and it's a DBD Reddit so not the place to discuss balance anyway
---
I wanna know why your mom is cutting your stomach?!?!
---
We'll talk about that little doozie at level 40. ;)
---
happy boi
---
Think the updates live tommorrow they posted it on their twitter
---
Now that I think about it your right. 🤔
---
I'm assuming you're on console, hag isn't free on PC.
---
You will get an actual sweaty 4 man once in 100 games. There really is no reason to overreact so hard.
---
Uhh, Third Seal? Yeah, no. The only killer that can make use of Third Seal before it gets destroyed is legion.
---
Jfc you guys weren’t joking when you said this was really hard
---
Sounds spooky. Perfect for Halloween!
---
But then what's the point of having a key?
---
Imagine if small game just showed you the aura of what it was alarming
---
What the hell have I opened
---
My eyes ughhhhh
---
Wait, it’s getting buffed? Did they say how they’re Buffon it?
---
Last survivor alive can use it to re-open the hatch if the killer has closed it. Still broken tho
---
Would be amazing
---
We'll Make It, you get double healing speed after an unhook. Lasts 80 seconds at tier 3 iirc.
---
A FW (I think Paullie) deduced that the next map was haddonfield based on convos he’s had with the devs. If you look at the roadmap it shows that the next map rework will come after Ch 14
---
Yeah happens to me, too.
---
This is me every time a new killer comes out. Killer mains have to learn entirely new mechanics as well as new perks, while survivors just get new OP perks to add to their collection. It’s nice to hear a “gg” or “nice moves”
---
What a sneaky boi
---
It's more unrealistic to expect people to be talking about it weeks after the event with no further news. 
---
It'll be essentially be viewed as unreasonable or toxic community behavior, which frankly won't do anyone any good since the "outrage" would be easy to dismiss or ignored. 
---
Just because people don't openly express the same level of disapproval from day 1 doesn't mean they accepted it or forgotten about it.
---
Let the sleepy boi have his way with the entit...I mean thuggish chick
---
This is just because their both ugly tbh
---
*fingerguns*
---
^PS ^give ^fingerguns ^emote ^you ^cowards
---
I know how kindred works and in that game someone else already had it so I didn't need to run it he still totally ignored me.
---
 If you are working on a generator alone even if it's past 50 to 60% that's not a reason to totally ignore someone who is hooked especially if you are going to keep fucling it up and setting the progress back
---
Spirit's.
---
Tell me everything
---
 It that makes it cool.
---
Who do you play with and what perks do you run?
---
Everytime, they just insist on running away after I unhook them even though the Killer is on the otherside of the map
---
She chose the best meat too
---
I play various killers, but most matches end up with survivors tbagging me at the exit gates no matter who I play or what build I have. I'm about to uninstall the game, so bored of it.
---
Daddy David’s come pre-tenderized
---
They do need to balance both mories and keys tbh 
---
Atm mories actually punish killers depending on their resources like pop goes the weasel or sbfl etc plus you get less bp in general and most likely to either get brutal or depip depending what ranks you are at , on the other hand keys can make the whole group of survivors a free escape really quick and also reward them with better bp and most likely a pip 
---
My suggest change is that either make mori useable after a specific gen or maybe getting a specific about of hooks like devour but you can’t cleanse the totem  (I don’t like the whole hooking everyone 2 times to use it makes it more bad and useless ) 
---
As for keys I suggest to make it only one person can escape and if the person does use it he can be grabbed (listen to my full idea before starting to downvote without my reasoning ) this way there actually won’t be a standoff rather a smart play of the killer is camping the hatch door and waiting for the survivor the survivor can either play smart and go to exit or loop the killer and lose him to the trap door 
---
Both ways the person can play smart with endgame 
---
I really wish they brought back the requirements to spawn hatch because a lot of the time the killer does really good and gets 3 kills at 4 gens left and it end with survivor either finding hatch or s/he is camping the door for the door to close
---
Well then never mind. But my point about the body blocking still stands. Maybe you just could have done some things to annoy him, but not hinder your team as a whole. Like not unhooking/healing, body-blocking not in chase.
---
Yes. That’s pretty much the “on the fence about buying” option. Play free, see if you get to the end, if you do, buy it and reap your extra rewards.
---
BLOODHUNT HERE WE GO
---
If you use small game regularly and you still think Ruin is OP you're just bad at the game lmao
---
Fuckibg Cowboy Jake that piece of literal shit, akways gotta tunnel, camp, and mori them to put them in their place... oh sorry, just had a sudden rush of rage there.
---
You'll be forgiven if you remove the watermark
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/zDUlCy4](https://imgur.com/a/zDUlCy4) I grabbed basically 100% of the conversation. I played 50/50 piggy (Amanda's letter and last will) trap a survivor then stand in front of a puzzle box. 50% chance they escape, 50% they die. I do it as a meme build just for the lawls as I always let the other survivors go. He was the only one that died during the match and came right now swinging.
---
Yeah don’t uninstall it because when you want to play it again you have to wait hours for it to reinstall. 
---
I’ve took a break from this game multiple time currently right now. Some due to boredom but this time it’s just constant harassment and bam that I don’t want to deal with. 
---
Good thing there’s been good games to play like Borderlands 3 on consoles only until 5 months later when it’s on pc lol. Or however many more months. 
---
Or remnant looks good and I heard some good reviews.
---
I hate being that guy, but this sounds you need to git gud. Not that you're particularly bad, but it definitely seems like you're matched poorly. Survivors making killers their plaything? I don't experience that when I play killer, not do my killer main friends. Maybe 1 in 20 games with a team of really good SWF. As survivor, it sounds like you're in lower ranks. At 20-16 I remember feeling like I mostly survived. At 15+ it really could go either way. 
---
Maybe you've just gotten your use out of the game. That's okay. You can stop enjoying something without it being bad. Tastes change. Whether the case is that you need to get better or move on, I wish you the best of luck!
---
It’s just a fun build. I usually just run dance with me and lithe. The other two just when I feel like it. Not when I want to win.
---
Fuck you. I'm better than you clearly
---
I'm always patient for spooky time
---
Jfc they need to relax
---
The clowns is dank and wish we could select what we wanted!
---
I mean, they both look like goblins tbh. Even if Nea don't need that much work compared to the poor Quentin..
---
It's just that Nea art works make her look waaaaay better than she's in game
---
i can never get the ones at the beginning
---
And would help now that ruins in the shrine again, you already know everyone’s gonna run it
---
depends on your internet, no?
---
Hitting ruin skillchecks isnt impossible.
---
It doesnt make gens unrepairable. (Unless ofcourse youre playing at lower ranks.)
---
Its a huge gamble since when it works it helps to apply pressure early game which for most killers is needed. If it doesnt the killer get hindered and has to play with only three perks.
---
Is ruin necessary. No i dont think it is. But in most cases it does help alot and just like with every perk in this game, be it survivor or killer, unless youre meming you might wanna have atleast one good one in youre loadout since you can bet your ass the people youre facing are using the best ones too.
---
uuh, [this is what it says in the live pc version so pardon my ignorance](https://imgur.com/a/avUTtaP), that being said wtf is with this description then?

Just shows how terrifying and intellegent Hans is. 
---
He *fucking* knows. Why else would he congratulate someone for speaking their own language.
---
Ehm.. ruin is a hag perk and hag can be purchased with shards.. I mean. Would've been a nice speculation if was BBQ and DS but shrine is pretty much random
---
Now that this is in the shrine, I'm gonna try it with my Hag and see how that goes
---
As soon as they even lightly breathe on the wiggle free as the last survivor they're brown bread haha
---
Eh, third seal no. Devour is very much feast or famine. Either you snowball and dominate the game or (very often) it gets cleansed in the first minute by someone randomly finding it, giving you a wasted perk slot.
---
100% doomed, if he gets the trap off, I don't hook/kill him. I see the line of questioning and in my opinion this isn't any different than a killer camping a hook. not only that but the survivors can also still take the hatch if it's spawned so it's not 100% doom anyways.
---
How many MB/GB of download will it be?
---
You're supposed to count to ten first!
---
Trapper is shit enough, no need to castrate him on top of that.
---
That would be overpowered and detectives hunch already does that.
---
LMFAO
---
this is relatable on a spiritual level
---
To be fair, that sounds pretty toxic. That guy's a piece of shit and has issues for sure. But what you did is also reportable tbh.
---
Doesn't matter. Just practice
---
It's like practicing a combo in a fighting game. At first you barely make it with a bit of luck. After a while you do it automatically
---
People finally realised over the past couple of days that crying about the issue on Reddit wont change anything. Massive Chinese conglomerates and their subsidiaries are barely phased by public backlash, no matter how many times you make off topic posts to complain about how bad they are.
---
No idea.
---
Glad that a few people see it in my eyes. But yeah the Get out of Jail for Free perk cards are just annoying as heck like Dead Hard, Dstrike just to name two major ones that I see constantly. And if you keep attention on one or two survivors in a chase you lose half the game by doing so.
---
trapper is one of the top 3 best killers 
---
once the update hits and nurse gets nerfed he'll be bumped up to number 2 on the tier list. He's literally the only killer who can completely block off windows and pallets, too unfaieer
---
If you have a PS Vita you are able to log on remotely as well..... and even play the game on the Vita if you have a good connection on both ends.
---
"Oh yeah, kill me piggy. Momma daddy"
---
But a killer camping a hook is usually worse then this. But you’re purposely ruining one persons experience. Whether or not you let the rest live that’s still rude in general. 
---
Yeah it’s not as rude as camping but it’s still rude lol.
---
Okay, settle down boy. Take a deep breath. It was just a joke. Why are you here on these forums or supporting their game if you despise them so much? Geez dude, you really need to chill. It's just a fucking video game, not life or death.
---
nah, def looks like ash!!! billy would be all slouched over, you nailed the posture! B) great stuff
---
Ahahahah this is too good.
---
Then he'll never be able to trap anyone haha 
---
You know how many times I've been chased and I think I've got a good escape route only to find a trap in my way, if you're able to jump it then they'll be no point of The Trapper haha 
---
If you manage to get trapped even if you've seen it then he's done his job.
---
You forgot the shitpost tag dude
---
not sure i follow you on how that's reportable. It's not reportable to face camp, there is no guarantee the box i'm guarding is the box they need and the survivor can take the hatch.
---
I personally run Corrupt Intervention (because my ruin spawns are always shit), Nurse’s Calling, Franklin’s Demise and Save the Best for Last. Nurse’s helps with finding healing survivors, Franklin’s is dirty on hag because you can trap their item after it drops, and STBFL makes it so that there’s a shorter time between you hitting a survivor and teleporting to the next triggered trap, leading to faster downs. Generally speaking, tracking perks like BBQ, Discordance and Whispers aren’t that great on her since she’s 1) a 110 killer and 2) a territorial one. You don’t want to be chasing survivors outside of your web, and BBQ will more than likely lead you to places outside of it. 
---
Space coconut has a LOT of hag guides on his channel that can greatly help you out too,

it says spirit is a lezbo!!!

---
Nah I usually don’t accuse people of lagswitching but this was extremely bad and very obvious cheating, I can try to post the clip if u guys wanna see lol it looks ridiculous
---
You kinda lost me at the "trapper is stupidly broken" part
---
Zoom through healing instead of taking 2 decades to heal with selfcare under sloppy butcher
---
but traps should only work if they surprise you
---
How dare Jakes want to wear the best head cosmetic.
---
Thats from spectator perspective isnt it? Removing the died, escaped person's icon. And i also dont think they keep staying coz the downed guy and the dc guy are most likely friends playing dwights. They both dc btw. [Here's what happened next](https://www.dropbox.com/s/immzvjxm21x784a/Aftermath.png?dl=0)
---
I browse by my main feed and this is the only stuff i see, so I'll take your words for it, still, I'd have assumed the event would have started a week or 2 ago, doesn't starting on Halloween feel a bit, late to most people?
---
Hell, most stores where i am are promoting Christmas stuff, i kinda dislike it honestly
---
And yes i talk alot, sorry
---
Nice bait. If not then you're the biggest idiot on this sub.
---
Its because you didnt play tue way they wanted you too. Everyone always says camping isnt an issue because you can just do gens and leave the camper with a 1k but then bitch because they throw themselves at him. And why do they do that? Because they cant just sacrifice 1 person and get out they have to get everyone out or else they arent having fun. I say fuck em.
---
For the amount of time I have dedicated to this game and the struggle to reach red rank, I can only imagine other people
---
Dedicated servers have never been on console, they’re currently being tested on PC though. Everyone else on my team was experiencing this lag too it was obvious cheating
---
Dwight’s are the magikarps of dead by daylight
---
Had that happen to me. I don't play killer ever but I was wanting to try new Freddy since I loved old Freddy. Got super bullied because I'm rank 20 killer for a reason, and there was one guy who was being so incredibly abusive. Not only to me, but to the rest of his team. So they all ganged up on him and were like "Wow you looped the rank 20 killer, you're so good dude". Made me feel better that they were nice. 
---
I ended up stopping after that game though because he did ruin my mood. It's people like that that really turn new killers off from the game :/
---
You get points by playing then unlock Perks, Offerings and Addons in the blood web. It’s not that grindy if you’re just playing for fun. There are definitely better perks to start off with, I am not sure what survivor to recommend though. I started out with Nea myself.
---
What do the survivor perks do? Not familiar
---
Survivor basics:
---
I would highly suggest starting as Meg if you like running away from the killer or Dewight if you like doing gens, get one of them to level 40 and then switch to Nea. After getting Nea to 40 switch to Bill, get him to 40. At that point you have most of the “good teachable” which will allow you to progress anyway you want as a survivor.
---
Killer:
---
You are going to want to get Hag to lv 40, than Hillbilly, this will give you two of the best perks when starting out (that are used in most games till you hit red ranks)
---
Choose a killer you like after that point.
---
If you wanna play I’m BotherShawn on steam I’m happy to help ya :)
---
Legion was an A tier killer at release but due to everyone crying about it BHVR nerfed them to shit. Now they're an M1 trash tier killer and even their iridescent add ons barely help.
---
The Mend exploit was fixable BHVR just didn't want to deal with it and the "moonwalking" was fixable by applying *one* of the 5 nerds Legion got.
---
I heard the nurse runs a knitting club with all the other killers
---
Seriously just close chat and don’t ever open it. When the game ends, take a look at your emblems and any shards you earned. Double check if you dodged any DS and just click continue. Chat is not worth it 90% of the time!
---
I’d say they’re on par. I stopped playing over watch competitively because you couldn’t do anything right, even my team won I always got look forward to “constructive”  feedback
---
How would it be overpowered?
---
I shrine bought bbq because I'm not wasting bps on bubba
---
how is that "lag?"
---
1) I literally said I camped, and gave a valid reason. 2) If that's an essay to you, get back in school. But give that you can't even spell 'you're' right, that should be said anyway. 3) It was a killer daily to chainsaw, and I was working on securing my next chainsaw, not my next kill. I was waiting on my next match, and didn't even get into my next match by the time I posted this. 4) 👍👍👍
---
I’m confused can someone explain
---
Wraith is being a little perv lol, but great drawing!!!
---
Joke's on you, you're a handsome (abeit exhausted) motherfucker!
---
Exactly, the best the masses can do is voice their disapproval and move on. You're also supposed to hear less and less of it as people boycott the company or whatnot, it's just how it is.
---
The people who can actually make a dent are not going to be posting on Reddit. Just today there was an article on /r/hearthstone  about Mistubshi pulling their sponsorship from Blizzard.
---
Not triggering the entity blocker...
---
Anything else haha
---
more than likely. I'm just trying to make sure that people are aware of this type of behavior in the game.
---
Unless you're talking about rank 1, talking about map pressure is user dependant.  All killers are completely viable up until you run into skilled/organized teams.  They are highly uncommon outside of red.  Red rank players are often underwhelming.  
---
If you are relying on meta killers you are likely over ranked.  Those survivors are better than you.  I'm not trying to insult you.  This is what I'm gathering from your post.
---
I don't consider myself very skilled.  I do not play nurse/billy/spirt/hag.  I rotate between the other killers.  I can't avoid hitting red ranks.
---
Ruin again? Wasn't it in the shrine like a month ago?
---
that's true, personally i'm not going to cry over it but I just felt that this particular type of salt needed to be reported.
---
laughs in bamboozle
---
how can I send a picture to BHVR?
---
Yeah. That would have been cooler. Though I understand why ST is getting all the attention consider how popular the chapter has been. Nothing else added to the game has gotten the same level of attention. 
---
We'll be interesting to see if Pennywise can top it.
---
Why not
---
I went from Pig to Myers and was like... oh. And then I went from Myers to Hag and was like... oooooh.

Nothing wrong with the 3 gen strat. It's the survivors fault in the first place leaving all 3 gens near each other. Ignore the garbage players. They are going to bitch regardless so just play to win.
---
silly killer dont you know if you dont let all 4 survivors escape without hooking a single one you are a toxic piece of shit
---
Ahhh stake out, finally a perk I actually want in the shrine
---
See if a friend can log in for you
---
Keys are very unbalanced, in my opinion. Not only is the ability to skip the objective very strong, I think that the wallhacks u can get on killer are stupid good.
---
That’s me! Lmao! The most toxic Santa Clown you ever did see
---
some people like the idea of it, considering it's like "playing a game" with the jigsaw killer but others apparently don't think so lol.
---
The uninjured survivor is the little brother hiding in his room.
---
Im on ps4
---
I think this would be funnier if the meme said it was already live
---
Nothing guarantees success, but they sure do help a lot.
---
Ability to jump? What the fuck is this troll dude?
---
Entity Education on youtube does this
---
Any tips for finding survivors? I usually throw on whispers to quickly get into a chase at the start of a game. Its a good perk, but I'm beginning to suspect its a crutch that I need to get away from. That and I want to have a bit more diversity in my perk builds.
---
i'm almost done giving all my killers ruin tier III *evil face*
---
Won’t load for me
---
Remember, spitters are quitters.
---
If you place it and immediately walk forward, you wont step on it. However, if you place it then step back only to walk over it it will trap you. It's been like this for as long as I can remember.
---
It kinda hurts my eyes to look at
---
~~So just me then?~~
---
Leave me alone Tool hater. I don't want to talk to you.
---
Spirit will probably just die even more
---
A Dwight texted me that once, found him in another match and moried them.
---
responded with "only noobs get moried.lol"
---
I think he blocked me.
---
I mean its not autocorrect if its shirtless myers tho
---
Yeah it is. Fuck off.
---
Man, I've rescued all 3 twice before and they didnt come get me on my 1st hook either. Sometimes it doesnt pay to be altruistic. :(
---
Yes. This. Exactly.
---
I'd reverse the killer path tbh. Billy is way easier to use then hag at low ranks in the 20's and allows you to farm the BP while leveling for both characters, barring unlucky never dropping bbq in hags web.
---
I hope your parents are dead or die and you loose a child at birth.
---
Leaving a lobby to avoid certain things
---
Honestly there aren’t balancing issues. Tbh killers are unfair more with Moris than ANYTHING. Also perks like NoED??? But they still Like to complain about dumb shit like insta heals?
---
Devs love to cater to the killers of this game.
---
The game is significantly harder for killers but by no means is it as unbalanced as you make it seem here. Killers have to try way harder to win games. This is true but it should be that way. Its 1v4 after all. Survivors are strong but there are many ways to work around it. Unless you are red ranks, killer shouldn't be all that hard if you are actually good at the game. If not then just practice. I'm red ranks every season, its unavoidable for me, and while it's annoying as fuck getting bullied by ass holes every game, you gotta look at those games for mistakes yku made to improve on them. It's the only way to get better.
---
myy friend that is a completely  false idk if you play killer or not but ive never been able to camp all 8 gens at once its completely imppssible at there is at most 4 close enough meaning its harder for the survs to get the last two gens. But if you do the correct ones first youll always be able to have one on the completely opposite side. Unlesssss The killer was to strictly camp the last three gens and let you get the rest. Which means you should have all 4 of ur survs at the end which is enough ppl to outsmart, distract, or constantly have two gens at a time being repaired. I think you or your team are just doing all the gens closest to each other leaving the last 3/4 right next to each other. I cant recall ever seeing 5 gens close enough for camping but if I did I can promise you ive never seen more than that.
---
r/Jokes
---
i stopped the survivor from going to the puzzle box. that's it lol
---
Always has been, same for sports and all, people over react everywhere.
---
The great others going to be even more killers running around using the most overpowered perk...
---
Well first off I do sneak up on the gens. Second you can’t lure them away they stop chasing you and go back to camp the gens. Also some maps are inherently  smaller than others and small maps with billy is game over no matter what gens you’ve done strategically
---
Trapper isn't really that bad if you know what you're doing. A part of it is setup at the beginning but if you bring Corrupt and Ruin you'll have much more time on your hands. It's all about the perks and how many dirty spots you know. 
---
Wraith, on the other hand...
---
The Demogorgon and Bubba hang out in the basement on weekends. They dormed together back in college. Sorry not sorry.
---
that stings lol
---
This is so sad, i love it
---
It’s called Billy :)
---
r/ink9989
---
Wow.  Referring to someone's ASSUMED age as a way of, what, insulting their credibility or intelligence?
---
Typical libtard move.
---
So, in essence, you're insulting ANYONE young by attempting to be a patronizing ASSHAT over the safety of the internet.
---
Bravo, tough guy.
---
YOU'RE the joke.
---
This assumes you have BBQ unlocked already or aren't a shit tier killer like myself. I average between 9k-10k per game, killer or survivor. It's actually faster in time for me to play as survivor, get killed relatively quickly, then queue up again into a new game to repeat. Having these teachables in the shrine is perfect for me because it's much faster to unlock for me this way than it is to gain BP and level someone up.
---
Kindred is a good/underrated perk, especially when playing solo. Worth keeping at least until you unlock better perks. 
---
Deja vu is kind of a meme. I think at one point some breakdown was done by BHVR showing that the perk was used like 10 times total in an entire month. Don't get me wrong if its helping you right now then use it! You're new, and I really believe in perks that cover your weaknesses. That being said, you will grow out of your need for this one. With some more games under your belt, you'll learn where generators tend to spawn, and you can locate them by looking up and looking for their blinky lights.
---
Dark Sense isn't a perk that I personally like. If you like the utility of having more info on the killer, keep an eye out in your blood webs for spine chill. It's one of my favorite perks and is secretly S-Tier (though it seems everyone here is starting to catch on to that). The way this perk works is that it lights up in your HUD when killer is looking at you within 12/24/36 meters. It takes a little bit of learning to use properly in say a chase and is really only good at level 3 but it's well worth it.
---
Self Care is always going to be a meta perk and for a new player its gonna be indispensable. Keep this one until you have more perks unlocked and you're more comfortable with the game, but I personally feel that it's better to find another team mate so they can heal you, since self care is half speed. Regardless you can't go wrong running it and its probably the best perk you have unlocked.
---
Selfcare/Botany Knowledge/Empathy/Kindred
---
^ if i had your perk pool I'd run that. Be the team medic!
---
u/ink98998
---
No its not. At worst with size, your gonna be on game/hawkins.
---
In either case this is solved by not doing the farthest gens possible.
---
On the [game](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/e/eb/TheGameOutline_UpperFloor.png?version=410167be421056bfacd5dbd6f5c20c05) you can solve this by not solving all the gens on the same floor to make the killer swap floors to protect the gens
---
On [hawkins](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/7/7f/TheUndergroundComplexOutline.png?version=89b9dce66521f218cd665b69a1fb9c92) again, dont do the gen upstairs or glass house and do the ones inbetween. 
---
There is no situation that the  3 gens are close together that is not self inflicted situation dipshit. Now, in a non swf you cant prevent this. You can help prevent it by doing the gens to widen the gap though instead of solving farther safer gens.
---
The worst is when a few people DC, you try to let the last one go and they DC too!  SMH
---
Does “My butthole was clenched specially for you, Stabby Daddy” count?
---
I know :(
---
I only use self-care if I combo it with a beefy Medkit or botany knowledge.
---
Gotta take advantage of that efficiency.
---
Not all the maps are fair in a variety of aspects of the game. Some maps are good for one killer but not another or extremely sided towards killer or survivor. It’s just how it is, it’s not always going to be fair and perfectly balanced.
---
&gt; gen camping 
---
Holy shit lmfao I bet you screech when people use the term gen rushing though
---
Ruin and a perk that decently counters it. Huh.
---
Also the realese of the Halloween Event
---
I was in the process of slowly leveling her up. It took me over a week to get her to level 9. I was convinced I was never going to get ruin. This is perfect for me.
---
What the fuck
---
This isn’t a thing, you’re just trash. Don’t put yourself in that situation.
---
also If you nerfed breaking gens then what would even be the point. You know howneasy late game would be for survivors? If there was 3 gens 4 survs less all you gitta do is have 2 work on one and the other 2 work on another if he chooses to chase someone down and hook assuming theyre good its enough time to escape. The gens only regress a lot if you dont repair them asap and if he is constantly leaving to break the next gen letting the previous gen he broke alone u can go and stop it from doing so. Trust me gen camping is more of in the survs hand then it is the killers. I main surv but play a lot of killer to know what im saying.
---
In spectator mode escaped/dead players don’t appear on the hud
---
Yeah that’s really unfortunate, but the character is locked behind some spicy owners...
---
Ruin isn't that big of a problem for me. It's when my teammates don't know wtf to do. They either stay on the gen and blow it up every 6 seconds, gen-tap, or go around looking for the totem and end up getting caught.
---
Honest to god, they had a power outage and lost a massive amount of data and work. Give the devs a break. They're not doing it to torture you on purpose. They're probably just as frustrated about it as us.
---
how do I go about sending the report though
---
Meta is known as "Most Effective Tactic Available" or just what everyone else is playing.
---
hes maybe the only one who makes shit hard but even then you cant so a whole nerf to the game cause of one killer xD
---
I feel attacked because I run that exact David outfit lol
---
How the instaheal got nerfed ?
---
If anything ruin helps with knowing common totem hiding spots and then helps in learning how to time great skill checks.
---
If u can buy the full dlc the get it, also includes the survivor, the map, and some skins. Is a good deal. 
---
Is Smart getting the perks from the shrine if u don't want to get the full dlc or character.
---
well, if you know how it works.
---
kindred only works if the one using it is on the hook, so in this case, it doesn't really help you. because you are the one who is on the hook and without kindred.
---
--
---
and depends on the case, finishing a generator can become a priority before unhooking someone.
---
it is such a waste of time if you left the generator and rush to the hook survivor just to find out that the killer still patrol there for abit or something like that and then you just sit there looking at the killer while you are suppose to be able to get 10-15+% on the generator and still be able to unhook you
---
I love this style! Are you doing the whole roster?
---
What kind of WHAT?
---
surely there's a way to block messages from people who aren't added as your friends on ps4, right?
---
Open Handed is low-key my favorite survivor perk.
---
What weapon?
---
Check PTB Patch Notes
---
 [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93849/](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93849/)
---
oh ok thanks
---
We'll... someone's salty they keep 3-gen'ing themselves. It can happen just do your best and get on with the next match. If you're raging this hard about it and not learning how to avoid it then maybe dbd is not the game for you. Just enjoy it it is a game after all
---
jUSt A LIttTlE bIt...
---
A hook he picked up from broken/used hook.
---
I've had killers complain I was a bad survivor for using fucking Flink over Bait Har...Dead Hard, or watch-me-walk-the-whole-game Sprint. I assume they didn't know what windows were just because they had seen some streamer say so.
---
Touchy words feel like salt on that burnt skin.
---
It really hurts that hope
---
Seems legit. I would give the killer a try
---
Clown's too!
---
Thank you.
---
Yes I know how it works you don't need to explain it to me like I'm stupid clearly I know better than you what I'm talking about since you are trying to defend someone who literally ignored his hook teammate that he could see who was less than 10 steps away from him to focus on a generator that he didn't path a single skill check!
---
 He was a toxic selfish piece of shit  Who did nothing to try and help the team
---
So am I lol. Just have a friend sign in real quick and get it
---
thank you! i wish the boxes and head traps where more intractable for the pig in some way, i was hoping unnerving presence would do that
---
Seems like something I would do
---
These wholesome shitposts are the only thing keeping me sane after reading posts where people legit want to take away the killers ability to kick gens or slug. God bless you sir
---
Yeah, you're definitely an asshole.
---
Adorable
---
oh FUCK yeah
---
The more I run off meta perks the more I get into situations where I needed them. I don’t use Adrenaline then I get downed by the killer as the last gen pops, they’ll tunnel me down to secure that one pity kill and let the others freely open the gates. I don’t run DS the killer will even go through BT to kill me and won’t even think for a second if I have DS. If I don’t run BT then we get a facecamper, especially late game if they have no kills so that guy dies, and that pisses me off so fucking much. I run BT solely so pity kill facecampers instead get none, especially if they have NOED, most satisfying thing in the game.
---
I’ve only just began learning Huntress and I play PS4 so she’s a lot harder to use than on PC and every other game is an SWF with at least two needles who play a Gideons offering and have Balanced Landing. It’s been awful. Literally all I wanna do is figure out how to aim properly. Fuck me, right?
---
I'm sad that it stacks for everything but Kindred (it can only increase kindred from 16 to 24m, 24m is the cap)
---
Right I was like CLAUDETTE
---
Post this as your own topic, there's alot here to be buried in comments
---
lmao, is that a joke? billy aint op by a long shot.
---
No they left as the killer let us do gens before deciding to kill Claud which is taking long
---
So well said! People keep calling the community entitled but tbh I think it’s fair people are disappointed. Clearly we love this game but it’s super grindy and anything to break up the grind is really nice... which is part of why this update is so exciting and why the community was so disappointed when the update was pushed back and not rescheduled. 
---
I also think it’s a really good point that dedicated and all that was late, because people are kind of forgetting it’s not just this event.
---
Also some of the cosmetics cost more than the DLCs don’t they?
---
Last time i played he was high in the meta. But yeah killers need some TLC and survivors needed some nerfing. I disagree with the insta heal removal but if it was nerfed in a cooldown like way maybe that wouldve helped or something
---
Bruh get a hobby, sitting behind a screen thinking you're tough isnt a healthy mindset
---
ugly ghostface OR perfect derpface?
---
Nurse will still be the best killer, just takes more skill to use
---
probably not but he sure as hell can apply a lot of pressure
---
It's almost like this game was so heavily survivor-sided 2 years ago, it's a miracle anyone even played killer.
---
Killer is really, really fun when you're playing with people who are around your rank. I got my first 4k today playing with other rank 20s and it was a great time!
---
Other times? People are just *mean*.
---
I just would love to see Survivors and killers have secondary objectives for goodness sake.
---
Many high rank killers use NOED too it doesn't mean you're worse at killer i would say it is a good way to rank up and I think it gives the killer a better chance of getting kills. It's a smart killer perk that people shouldn't complain about.
---
Death by snoot snoot
---
The only chapter dlc that cost more then a single cosmetic is the stranger things DLC.
---
I am so sorry for you and your family.
---
I know it doesn't really mean anything from a rando on the internet, but I hope your father finds some comfort and peace saying goodbye.
---
What?
---
Lol. Trash post is trash.
---
I may just be an uninformed Legion but I feel like the more people you hit while in Frenzy, the less time you should have to wait when it ends.
---
So.... you did your job. As a killer. No tunnel no camp?
---
these are only 6 changes throughout the entire history of the game and vacums, exhaustion coming back while running, brand new parts, and DS were all literally gamebreaking. I didn't worry too much about flashlights and instaheals but they're definitely still broken, the real problem is whenever the devs always tag along small or decent killer nerfs with updated un related to them, like pigs traps not going off after EGC update
---
Imagine having to buy the hag *dab*
---
I play PS4 and PC. Rank 1 survivor on each and if I’m playing with friends there is an incredibly high chance we all escape. Any experienced player knows this. 3 weeks doesn’t make you a veteran, and rank 4 is not a representation of skill, just time invested.
---
What if the killer forces a 3-gen from the start? That's my main tactic with my Doctor build and it almost never fails. Once a doctor's 3-genning it's impossible for survivors to win if he's running Overcharge, Distressing, Unnerving, and Pop Goes The Weasel.
---
Stranger Things 100%
---
That would be too over powered. Some of the most horrible vaults are used constantly while in a chase and you can’t do anything about it. Honestly it’s enough to have pallets not use have it. I come from an even side (rank 10 on both and I can’t keep up because my health is shit) to know what’s fair and not.
---
Because none was announced.
---
Not incorrect, bug or not, if he had rescaled through the exit, he would have gotten credit. I know this for a fact because this exact scenario happens to me. Escaped through hatch, no go. Next match educate through exit gate, credit.
---
I've owned the game for 2 years. I've only been grinding it since it's all my girlfriend wants to play she enjoyed it alot and I'm speaking from the standpoint of someone who is simply trying to enjoy the game and not someone who dedicated their entire life to the competitive nature of dead by daylight.
---
Read over it again and tell me where it says these changes **weren't** need
---
What rank are you?
---
She never stays away for too long
---
You’re the one obviously mad since you made a long rant to reddit lol go back to fortnite kid
---
You are playing survivor not killer
---
I have 5 tiers of perks and Botany is firmly in tier 2 for me.
---
The tiers are as follows:
---
* Meta Bullshit that honestly needs a nerf (DS, Adred, Borrowed, DH / Ruin, BBQ, Spiritduring)
---
* Genuinely good alternatives that aren't completely broken (Botany, Leader, Stakeout, Aftercare / M&amp;A, Surveillance, Sloppy, Discordance)
---
* "I'd run this if it was better" (Second Wind, Diversion, Lightweight, Tenacity / Thanatophobia, Fire Up, Coulrophobia, Surge)
---
* Bad perks (Technician, Buckle Up, Wake Up, Solidarity / Monsterous Shrine, Mindbreaker, Unrelenting, Huntress Lullaby)
---
* Perks that actively harm you (Either don't do enough to justify the perk slot, encourage bad playstyles, or do indeed actively harm you) (No Mither, No One Left Behind, Mettle of Man, Camradarie / Insidious, Predator, Beast of Prey, Furtive Chase)
---
It's really easy to fix. Just make it so the perk deactivates when another survivor gets hooked or downed. At that point the killer is clearly not tunneling.
---
Nothing wrong with that either. Is a valid strategy especially with characters like doctor trapper and hag. Territorial killers li e for 3 gen strats.
---
Fuckin Ruin in the shrine again.. mothafuckas!
---
I'm sold. Now i have just 1 more. So i think something like Freddy/Pig/Ghostface. But i read that Pig got nerfed hard and people can just leave with the traps on which is a shame because i would 100% get her.
---
Also why is Leatherface so bad? if he is fun i might actually play him as long as i am a low rank but it does suck that people buy him just for a perk to get more BP
---
More than half is complaining and then there’s the no speed boost one
---
Me: Downs 3 survivors and hooks them  
---
4th Survivor: Doges a gen
---
Me: Reports for genrushing
---
Botany is great if you're playing the dedicated healer and want some self sustain as well. Bring Botany along with a Medkit and a perk like Second Wind and you're honestly gucci for most of the match.
---
Wasn't that patched out?
---
Look at you. Pathetic.
---
Thank you. My uncle (his brother)passed away last week. And now my grandma is so heartbroken that we feel she may not make it. She is 98, buried her husband 33 years ago, and now her son. I figured the best thing I could do was drive him down and make her smile a bit.  I dont get much alone time with my dad, so a road trip with him will be memories forever for me. Even if they are sad, there will be joy as well. 
---
Randos on the internet are much kinder and more personable than most people are face to face.
---
So is the event coming too, or just the update?
---
As for your first point, it might be harder than you think. I think the entire Archives will be in this patch despite the later tiers not unlocking until the upcoming weeks, so dataminers may already have it all weeks before it releases.
---
But as for the reporting, will do.
---
Did I hurt you’re little feelings like daddy myers did?
---
It is from John Carpenters The Thing, AMAZING film, if you love horror and practical effects it is a perfect film.
---
Watch some videos, watch skilled people play. Play killer and learn from the success and mistakes of survivors. Once you have a solid understanding and are consistently able to run the killer, you will be begging for a good killer to actually keep it interesting.
---
Okay but if you're dodging Jakes in general you're the kind of guy who finds a fresh lottery ticket on the ground and then throws it in the trash instead of at least scratching the tiles to see what's under them.
---
Words of wisdom

The lore is one of the things I care about most in the game and is the main reason so many people were hyped for the archives, so I wouldn't say that nobody would care to begin with

Perfectly balanced; as all things should be.

No one in Western Canada gives a shit about Quebec. Instead of voting for a political party they made one that votes exclusively for Quebec, destroying the whole point of federal legislature.
---
I already got it and I prefer to use location and location in a chase (I’m all ears, spies, and thrilling) and as long as you have a backup. Ruin is a great thing with stealth because you could theoretically camp because people will spend forever looking for it. I don’t tho
---
Yea, I saw the game 2 years ago, and I saw funky shit like all of these  [https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1621724915795099897/](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1621724915795099897/)
---
You did nothing wrong and I hope you reported them so they lose their accounts.
---
Oh yeah, I've seen that too, the one where you instantly get banned if you pick spirit, right?
---
Haha nah you were pretty good
---
mori-o my Oreo lmao
---
Idk why you got downvoted, cute font and if you like it, keep it
---
shit u right. This post is cancelled everyone go home.
---
Battle pass for dbd, you get bar separated into levels, you level by playing and get rewards. Rewards are separated into free and premium categories, everyone gets free rewards, only those who purchased rift pass for 1000 auric cells get premium rewards. All rewards are purely cosmetic and if you complete all 100 levels you get your 1000 auric cells back. Rift is reset every several months with new rewards and new rift pass to buy.
---
"killers always get their way", tells me you're either rank 15 or trolling because everybody knows the game is strongly survivor favored in the red ranks.
---
It's not really that OP, yeah it's a pain in the ass to deal with, but not op considering it's a hex that you can break (on top of the other ways of countering it by gen-tapping or just learning to power through and hit great skill checks consistently).
---
you need to not look anywhere except up after hooking someone. Honestly I’m really lucky with who I get. I don’t get as much hate as others do for trivial things like camping when I know someone else is nearby (I don’t use BBQ). The only thing that would be considered close to not doing it is chasing someone after DS
---
Oh cool
---
Instasaw has counterplay, Nurse can at least have its moments, but when you get near 25% slowdown on gen progress, it takes forever to do anything. It just gets boring to play against.
---
Sounds like a jerk
---
Blood web. As you progress through the blood web collecting perks and offerings there will be add ons along the way. You have to get the teachable perks from other killers. Play as cannibal and get bbq unlocked at level 30 (I think it's 30?). Then add more perks as you go. You'll figure it out as you play.
---
FFS stop with those. Killer that turns into a survivor has no power against SWF won't ever work
---
Someone once called out a streamer that deliberately de-pips to play easier killers, and it made so much sense that I hated myself for watching them.

Tea.
---
Dbd’s financial employees hate this one trick
---
Claudette
---
Laurie in the bottom pic is her in the locker with DS active, preparing herself for the stab
---
My boy Bubba (Leatherface) is pretty strong with the right perks. 
---
DLC to get for perks alone, I would always get Leatherface (because with BBQ you will double the amount of bloodpoints you get per game, this is huge, especially if you are new to the game)
---
The Clown has one of the, if not the strongest perk in the game right now, "Pop goes the weasel". It lets you regress a generator by  a flat 25% every time you hook a survivor without cooldown.
---
Ghostface has thrilling tremors, which shows you what generators are being worked on when you pick up a survivor and blocks all other generators from being worked on for 16 seconds.
---
Legion has Discordance, this perk lights up every generator that is being worked on by 2 or more survivors.
---
For the steam sale, I'd say get Leatherface for sure because BBQ is so great for farming, Ghostface and Legion for their perks. And any other Killer that is licensed that you are interested in. Because you are supposed to have fun playing this game.
---
If you want to save some money, you should be able to buy non-licensed character with an ingame currence that you accumulate through time spent in matches (Iridescent Shards). This will take a while, hours if not days, though. You can get Leatherface and Clown this way, for example.

Haha it sounds like it is but it’s actually not. Unfortunately camping is considered a shitty but legal strategy. Typically you’re sacrificing map control, hook progress, points, and metals to camp. I don’t consider this camping but nothing about this is reportable.
---
This happens to me at least once per match, it is not just you.
---
I think it happens mostly when I place traps on steps, stairs or other inclines. 
---
But it's probably just the dedicated servers. \^\^
---
Nurse can go through walls. S tier
---
Spirit doesn't give any info that she starts moving at insane speed, letting her go around the wall unnoticed. S tier
---
Billy has his curves and chainsaw mindgames, but, when the survivor's playing correctly, is as loopable as it gets. He excels in pressure and punishing mistakes. Billy is a strong but balanced killer. Everyone below Billy is underpowered. Everyone above Billy is overpowered. Billy is the representation of the perfect power level
---
this is pure fucking GOLD, thank you for your service
---
It is supposed to count for hatch. Escaping through hatch IS an escape. It’s a bug, hence why you are incorrect. This same bug used to affect the “unhook yourself and escape” trophy. If you’re scared through hatch it would bug and not count and therefore not give you credit for the achievement. The devs acknowledged that it was a bug and fixed it. This is also a bug and will eventually (hopefully) be fixed. 
---
You were probably downvoted for giving incorrect information.
---
Plunders Instinct is a General survivors perk. It’s not a Dwight teachable.
---
To be fair David wasn't shirtless, I think that have swayed the killer.. I mean nea.
---
not listed Nurse. You my friend are either retarded or playing on console where good nurses are rare
---
Both
---
Piping as killer is hard at high ranks. So much easier as a survivor.
---
Which isn’t the worst thing. High rank survivors can be really toxic.
---
She has 110% base walking speed, hope can outrun her if it is utilised. The only thing that should be nerfed is lunging, as an ex spirit main lunge is too long
---
Flashlights were nerfed because the pick-up speed was increased and animations were changed multiple times
---
Micheal, you came!
---
That’s what she said.
---
Are you playing in red ranks ? It gets harder to pip the higher you get. The whole system is pretty complicated.
---
[Check the wiki](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems#Pip_Conditions) , if you got questions, I will try to answer them after I get home in a few hours.
---
But what happens when I complete the bloodweb? Will I not be able to get any more addons/offerings?
---
Hm. Not sure why it rotated like thaT.
---
Version Mismatch - Someone has to update. It might be the other person
---
Bruh just stand still, the survivors cant outrun you if they come to you
---
I hate it when I pick up a survivor and a (Nea or Feng which turned into Steve in scoops) comes out that I didn’t see. I started turning around on the pickup
---
I've got 1200 hours and Sprint Burst is not a bad perk but it compensates for being a weak survivor and you're wrong. Your opinion of this game is gen rush and if you dont do gens fast then that's not good teamwork there's better ways to play and you won't be able to adapt because sprint burst is a perk for people that can't loop. If you could loop you wouldn't need sprint burst lol you'd use balanced landing. You should learn how to play without relying on exhaustion perks to see if you even can. If you can't then sprint burst is just a boosted perk and you probably aren't good at the game either.
---
Freddy: *That's not politically correct, you can't say that!!*
---
Now youre thinking with portals
---
Shhhh it's okay, everything is going to be alright. Just take deep breaths and slowly count to 10 you'll feel much better. Do you need a hug?
---
A baby Billy is a just kinda sad and pathetic to play again, you almost feel bad for escaping
---
A good Billy will scare you, you have about 50/50 chance of getting out alive
---
A great Billy will probably get 4ks most game, some survivors may be smart enough to get away
---
A godlike Billy is almost as mad as Nurse, they can even aomehow find a way to make looping them hard, which different jukes and manuevers, if you aren't a great survivor, you stand 0 chance.
---
Billy is only bad when the people who play him are bad, that with his ability to apply hella map pressure and instadown abilities, he'd probably be A or B tier without the instadown tho, same reason why Cannibal isn't the worst killer, the instadown makes them 10x tougher, because even if you can juke them, the stress of potentially getting instadowned is enough to mess some people up, which ultimarely leads to them getting instadowned
---
This is just my experience, sonlong as you make notes as to tricks the Billy does, you should be fine.  But otherwise, he is a meta killer, no question.

Well massive protests and writing/calling senators/sponsors is probs best that one can do.
---
You seriously got triggered enough to make a reddit post about it? Move on. The games toxic.. same thing at MK11 subreddit. People post a video every time someone t-bags after killing. Who. Cares.
---
Event, Update, Archive, Bloodpoints for wiggling, ALL COMING!
---
Yeah it’s so annoying. But I doubt they would fix it, it’s been there for so long... also “unknown error” should be fixed too, it brings me back to the main menu every fucking time after the game
---
&gt; Randos on the internet are much kinder and more personable than most people are face to face.

I hate how often this is true.
---
If you literally ONLY want the perks, it's technically more cost effective to get the perks on the shrine (3 x 2k = 6k vs 9k for the character). There are two main problems with this. One is that the cost you put into the perks on the shrine does not reduce the cost of the character. This means you can buy all 3 perks for 6k on a character, but then if you want to get the character themselves you have to use another 9k or buy them with cash. This is especially problematic for killers, as they have their own gameplay value and are not just "skins".
---
The other problem is, this will take an eternity to net you every perk in the game as there is simply a random selection of 4 survivor/killer perks every week. They are completely random and can be perks you already own so the MINIMUM number of weeks you would have to spend to get all of them is 34 (already a long time) and the maximum is literally forever, technically, although I'm sure the selection process isn't literally mathematically random. The odds, by the way, of getting 4 unique perks every time and getting them all in 34 weeks is around 8.53×10\^(-57). That's 56 zeros after the decimal. That's 1 in... a number with 589 digits. So you can expect to wait a LOT longer than that. A safe way to use the shrine, if you need to, is to not use it once you own around half the perks in the game (the equivalent of unlocking the teachables from about 14 characters on top of the general perks), this way the odds of seeing new things on the shrine while you are using it are in your favor.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
TLDR; If you think you might ever try to get a lot of the content in the game unlocked, don't use the shine **ever** except for one-off perks that you *really* need ASAP, or at all if you can help it.
---
I can Recommend Bill for Borrowed Time and Unbreakable
---
Laurie for Decisive Strike
---
Dwight mainly for Bond but Prove Thyself can also be effective
---
And I agree with Jake and Nea, Iron will and Balanced are easily my favorite perks. 
---
I usually use this build:
---
Iron Will
---
Decisive Strike
---
Unbreakable
---
It depends on your rank how useful this build is, its the best at red ranks, because killers slug to avoid DS
---
Isn’t huntress’s hitboxes for hatchets like a rectangle? I remember wayyyys back someone was able to show the size of it and it was huge. 
---
Latency is also an issue but huntress has some weird hitboxes
---
There is, though I had mine turned off because I was playing Apex prior and it made it hard for people to add me as friends on there. So I just turned off the pop up notification for now.
---
Oh i thought people can leave thw regular way with the trap on, can't they?
---
Also how is ghostface? Right now i think its either fred or pig
---
Found the patch. [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patch\_Notes\_2.1.0](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patch_Notes_2.1.0) 
---
&gt;Adjusted the Killer pick up (Pick up Survivor from ground) time to 3 seconds, down from 4.3 seconds 
---
Back in the day, exhaustion was recovering while running, which made everyone run Sprint Burst and it was up so often, that there was next to no way to hide from a claudette that sprints in with a flashlight, especially when picking up was so slow.
---
Oh yea I forgot that flashlights got nerfed a long time ago. earlier bulb add-ons and the purple flash-light used 
---
 [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patch\_Notes\_1.8.3](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patch_Notes_1.8.3) 
---
&gt; Removed the quicker blind and burn modifiers from the increased flashlight beam effects against the killer, and from increased the power of the flashlight beam add-ons and items as well as simplified the text to reflect these changes(Utility Flashlight, Focus Lens, High-end Sapphire Lens, Power Bulb, Intense Halogen, Odd Bulb and TIR Optic) 
---
for some reason that's listed in Wraith Changes lol
---
I reported them to PSN. If I remember correctly, they do pretty well with giving punishment to bullies.
---
It's already in samination's new video.
---
After looking at your post history I just feel really bad for you. Rofl
---
You can complain to their sponsors for sure, but senators? Blizzard is a corporation, not a governmental entity. They’re also not breaking any laws here. 
---
You realize one of the main reasons we have this mess is precisely due a certain country’s government decided to flex its power over a corporation?
---
Nah you cant leave through the gates with a trap on. If you pass just past the doorway you will die. Only hatch. 
---
Ghostface is really fun. Hes similar to myers in the sense he is stealthy and can really jump scare survivors. Hes pretty strong too. I'd recommend him for sure.
---
Can you continue buying new perks on the bloodweb if you fully level up a character? And if you fully level someone up, then buy new dlc, can you get those same perks for the leveled character after unlocking them?
---
Also, any ideas who the next character will be?
---
Not if you know where totems generally spawn. If you're that close to a totem you'll probably see it anyway, ive never had much problems running past totems and as a beginner not knowing where totems spawn yeah lvl 1 small game is better. Instead of using a perk like small game you can use a map with the killer belonging add on and increased range add on. Just run around the whole map and you'll get all the totem auras easy. Which is why small game doesn't need to show auras and survivor's complaining to make the game easier is so ridiculous. At what point does the survivor require any skill if everything is made easier? You have to have awareness, it's part of the game.
---
Wait was that not intentional
---
Someone's diaper needs changed
---
Well considering that there are people who can win as killer consistently, you're bad.
---
Play the game. The web goes away and another replaces it. It's infinite. It just gets bigger each level until you hit level 50 then it's the same size every time.
---
Then you can prestige, but that will reset you.
---
How much time is that exactly if you dknt mind me asking?
---
Not hit boxes, its latency! Common mistake, but the hit boxes on some things are very very bad.
---
Okay thanks!
---
??
---
Spine Chill will still work regardless of the update. It never was and never is terror-radius based so it sound not be affected by Oblivious.
---
You're cheating the other team out of altruism points (and wglf stacks, if they're running it). Please hook everyone 2 times. Just be extra careful not to give them the 3rd one ; \^ )
---
they hated me because i told them the truth
---
you try to do one of those three anyway. The killer can't keep track of 4 survivors at once and progress will be made. One of the gens win eventually be done
---
I haven't seen Pop since I've started to want it. That been over 4 months now. Probably more
---
Because it's no fun. It's a waste of time. For those who care about rank, you lose a pip. Better to spend a few minutes farming and getting safety pip and at least a fair amount of BP. I didn't spend 5 minutes in queue just for someone to DC and basically not let me play the game...
---
Awesome
---
u/repostsleuthbot
---
Lmao first of all I play almost exclusively Survivor right now. 
---
Secondly, I run a Medkit (over arguably more useful items) because it allows me to heal if I absolutely need to do so without running a perk slot. Sure, it's not 25% for free on a random gen a la BNP or a get out of jail free card like a key, but it allows me to basically have Self-Care if and when I badly need it without having to sacrifice another perk.
---
I don't know what you're talking about. I can get 4k easily without add-ons or stalking with GF
---
If you have a gaming mouse, I highly recommend switching the skillcheck key to m5. It will making skillcheck hit more accurately and let you scratch your nose. :D
---
I mean that setup is bad anyway, it's obvious they dont play very much.
---
Huntress: Breaks pallet with bare foot

Reminds me of the toilet kill in the F13 game

I would run rancor for the location reveal part if i dont have bbq and ofcoz the mori fun. And noed for same old reasons.
---
Pop was there yesterday
---
This should be way higher
---
I had 2 in basement on hooks and the other 2 trying to save them, game ended within 5 mins. I still deserve to pip from getting the 2 in the basement in the first place
---
No mither for unlimited revives with most of the hooks were sabo'd
---
Pop was there last week

---
Truth. You **have to** play M1 to get to your proper rank.
---
On the other hand, I will point out that there are quite a few pretty good teams out there that include a token deranked 10-20 player to screw up the matchmaking. They're not usually red material, but they are overskilled for the ranks they troll. I'm not saying it's common, but it's frustrating and they are out there, so you need to be able to accept that as well. You can still learn from those games, but if they're too far above you're not going to be able to learn much.
---
Nope.
---
Spine Chill gets buffed. It works on Tier 1 Myers now.
---
Tbf, it's a super strong combo. If you use it at the right places you can lose even the best killers.
---
Aw my first tag
---
The Shape:
---
SWF encounters new killer : “gg ez baby killer git gud” 
---
SWf encounters veteran killer : “sweaty killer. tryhard. Go die of cancer. crutch perks” 
---
You can literally never win.
---
He probably expected a hug lol
---
If you kill everyone too fast you don’t accumulate enough points to pip, at lower ranks it’s even harder. If you were too close to the hook and soft camping you’re going to lose points and not pip. If you don’t regress gens enough you’re not going to pip. It sucks to not pip for totally destroying the other side but it’s how it works at the moment.
---
Yeah playing killers is so stressfull sometimes.
---
I always think like 5 minutes at the beginning of a dbd day if today is a killer day or if I prefer only playing survivors for the moment...
---
Someday I litteraly can’t play Killer if I feel already a little down..
---
I need to be in a very good mood to have the faith playing killer.. always scared of what I could face..
---
Playing survivors on the other side.. I couldn’t care less.. somedays I’ll not care at all if I die or live.. and other day i’m triggered by every ones moves...
---
I don't play Killer often anymore but when I did, here are some of the reasons why I might let someone escape: 
---
1) they got farmed (unsafely unhooked) by their teammates. (Getting farmed tilts tf out of me when it happens to me when I'm playing Survivor so I take pity on those it happens to.) 
---
2) they were the non-toxic one (e.g. no teabag, flashlight spamming, etc) in game with otherwise toxic survivors. 
---
3) I felt they personally played well without being toxic. (basically that they were an even match to me) 
---
Generally though, it depends on the Killer player. Some always give the Hatch, some never do.
---
I'd probably say killer.
---
Yeah they said u can do this
---
15 streamers, each is a group of 5 and everyone plays killer once so 4 games total, supposedly you cant pick the same killer as someone that already used that killer. Nobody is going to take it seriously and the prize won't affect the games at all people are just gonna meme. That's all you really need to know the streamers are US only no EU and so far I think it will be

---
Why should it hurt my progression if the other side sucked? I don't understand why I'm punished for killing the survivors too fast. Isn't that the point?
---
That's why I don't stalk with the Ghosty Boi
---
you seriously got triggered enough to click on the post and reply to it? Move on. See? the same could be said, and we could allow people to be toxic or do something about it. Just because that appears to be the norm doesn't mean we simply allow it.
---
Amanda's traps were rigged and unwinnable, I feel like she fits more and maybe they felt the same. Since the survivors haven't really done anything bad according to their lore that would cause John to go after them.
---
BBQ was in there about a month or two ago so i dont think its coming out anytime soon
---
Survivor Perks: \[\[Stake-Out\]\] and \[\[Dance With Me\]\]   
---
Killer Perks: \[\[Hex: Ruin\]\] and \[\[Thanatophobia\]\] 
---
If you play Killer at all, Hex: Ruin is super meta and definitely worth getting if you don't already have it. Thanatophobia is also pretty solid; not exceptional but absolutely a fine perk to run on most Killers. 
---
Neither of the Survivor perks are that great IMO. Stake-out is, frankly, not worth the perk slot, and Dance with Me isn't super great by itself (it has excellent synergy with \[\[Lithe\]\] if you already have that though).
---
Is there a thing were the killer can DC at the very end of the match so nobody gets BP? I just played a match and this happened. Went in with 110k BP, killer DC’d, BP screen said zero but the scoreboard screen said i got 15k, in lobby still with 110k. Anybody else have this happen? I’m on ps4 btw
---
They've been bugged since the Stranger Things chapter came out.
---
I only started playing this game Nov of last year, but I don't remember ever having these issues (NAT type and unknown error). For me at least, it was a byproduct of the Stranger Things DLC.
---
Oh yeah, this movie was a thing that happened.
---
as I've said previously, i'm sure it will but toxicity like this can't go unchallenged.
---
Way to go devs! Also happy to see the communication has improved.
---
I would say the killer because most killer perks are designed with the intention of making the killer overpowered. With the survivors, there’s not really any clutch perks. Most perks are for convenience.
---
Ability should be the ability to kick completed gens
---
Exhaustion are not mandatory...
---
Survivors relys too much on it.. 
---
I’ll think more of a borrow times for this build
---
Haha the Samination's Wraith lobby dodge pack
---
I'm watching you DC3ZT
---
I'm pretty sure you can't buy new Killers for Shards, only Auric Cells (premium currency). You can use Shards to buy perks in the Shrine of Secrets (reasonably priced) as well as some cosmetic items though.
---
I generally try to be nice to people regardless of what role I am playing in post chat. Usually leave a 'gg,go next game people/killer' or if there's is a person I see that is struggling I usually try to aim my messages towards them with something like 'unlucky this game x, go destroy the next one'
---
Lol you're kidding right? 3 genning is entirely on you.
---
Lightweight, bond, spinechill, babysitter, basically I use these perks most of the time
---
You’re just really lucky then
---
I use self care as an insurance policy and mostly never use it during the match. the combination with spine chill saved my life countless times. I run Deja vu to shorten the time spent looking for a gen to make up for the potential time lost for self care. but will probably replace it with the soon to be buffed detective hunch
---
This didn’t age well
---
This title game is beyond my level
---
When the killer can't find you but you die of dysentary
---
BBQ was up right after that Ruin. Guess you missed it :(
---
Dance with me, nice. Always wanted to try DWM+LITHE+Q&amp;Q.
---
This shit actually annoys me. Meg or Dwight will always run right at me with the killer on their ass and you know what? The killer leaves them and comes straight for me, never leaves me though! I run Ghostface fucking three Gens and he never looks at Dwight again, but I die on first hook.
---
It’s so fucked up 😤
---
I usually put portals near gens so I can teleport to them and also if a survivor is working on that gen, I’ll know cause Killer Instinct will appear. I’d also put a portal near the totem or near an exit gate if all gens get completed. 
---
Make Your Choice on Demo is really fun.
---
Literally the only thing you need to know
---
Inb4 this gets deleted 
---
but i just wanted to say I hope you reported them in-game!Then send an additional request to DBD customer support. They are really good with responses. I’m pretty sure you can find it on their website.
---
Do EVERYTHING in your power to get them banned!
---
Freddy vs Jason was fucking awesome.
---
poor baby dwight learned it from the bad toxic Claudette):
---
I heard Legion is one of the worst in the game. is that true? i prefer getting good killers instead of getting them just for perks. I actually got Leatherface for BBQ and i think that's enough lol. Clown i think is a good one to get for shards, is there anything good in his DLC that i will be missing out?
---
I remember someone posting awhile back about this problem after dedicated servers. It's not just you
---
Ruin again....here we go boys...
---
Top tier killer for that.
---
If you're consistently getting marked hits off you're actually hurting your Malicious and Chaser Catigories because you're getting less hits for Malicious and less chases for Chaser.
---
Man I'm not sure who has warped your mind but perhaps you should take a break from the internet for a while. 
---
I hate to call you out, but trolls like you have been around since racial slurs were common place. The difference between people like you and I, is the fact that regardless of how "oversaturated" these trolls are doesn't make it ok. 
---
Rather than help fix a problem, you prefer to sit behind your computer and shit post to gain fake internet points. At some point and time, you have to say enough is enough.

---
I appreciate it. I reported him everywhere I could
---
I like how you're getting down voted, without anyone asking any sort of questions, even though you're probably speaking from experience, which doesn't make you wrong.
---
and he loses that effect for an undetectable status effect.
---
This will make him have 0 terror radius in tier 1 (currently has 6m) but also make him no longer immune to non-aura detection perks. It was confirmed by one of the devs as an intended consistency change.
---
It's also a giant change for Scratched Mirror. On one hand, no longer immune to Spine Chill, on the other, free perk slot (M&amp;A no longer needed) and no terror radius for others when in chase
---
Well that changes things then, he definitely meant it homophobic. You will find people like that in every game not just dead by daylight unfortunately. Best to report and not respond I guess.
---
Damn boi it worky
---
Inside
---
And what about letting players plays like they want ?
---
I usually get looped the most by neas.
---
The shrine has really been treating killers, Discordance, Pop and now Thana and Ruin, pretty sure BBQ was there bit long ago too.
---
Then the killer has more chances to win in my opinion. Unless the survivors were God loopers or blendettes...
---
For anyone who DOES want to be spoiled, I have a feeling the folks at /r/leaksbydaylight will post all the lore very quickly after the update hits
---
That's still witch-hunting. What you do is: Open a support ticket and send the screenshot there
---
What you don't do: What you just did
---
Yeah. Legion is not that great. You can grab discordance from the shrine if /when it pops up there
---
yeah that’s what i did and it’s not a massive deal i’ve been called that many times but many different people it just made me realise that it’s never happened in all my time playing dbd which is nice
---
I was CERTAIN they put Ruin and BBQ in shrine before Stranger Things DLC came out so Demo players would have to buy DLCs, but I suppose you can always just buy the whole hag for iris if you really want....
---
Laughs in Doctor!
---

or Chad sloppy butcher.
---
No Adrenaline?
---
dwight doesnt give plunderer thats a perk everyone has access too/isnt character specific
---
I was literally about to buy Hag for Ruin lol. Although Dying Light seems like a suitable replacement in the meanwhile. Problem solved regardless!
---
Thats a big OOF RIGHT THERE
---
rules are here for a reason. Post getting popular here won't get them banned. It's just a plain witch-hunting which breaks 2/9 rules
---
Support tickets exist for a reason. That's what **WILL** get them banned no matter if he made this post or not.

If I buy a perk with I-shards, will it be availeble for all characters in the bloodweb?

All joking aside though, very cool illustration. I like the cross hatching and sketchy line art.
---
it's just straight up spamming at this point
---
Previous game I had 3 guys escape with a key and acuse me of tunneling after playing as fair as I could. For this one I brought a mori after seeing another key (which was also used).
---
I'll never shun criticism, but please don't pretend like the context of this doesn't matter.

They use it to insult or attack insecure men and women. More so men really, lesbian or bisexuals aren't really considered as a slur.
---
I used to try to say a simple « gg » at the end of every game, regardless if I play survivor or killer...
---
But the more I’ve played killer, the more I don’t want to say it anymore.. even while playing survivor.. 
---
I don’t know.. I’ve lose the faith.. 
---
When I play fair with killer and say gg, nobody ever answer.. or when I did great anf carried a little in survivor.. and i’m proud of this game.. nobody says « gg »
---
I’m tired of trying to be the happy little girl..
---
So now I just move on without saying anything :(
---
Rarely I will answer a gg if someone say it for once.
---
No let me clarify, you're taking the scope a bit too far out. I was solely talking about Blizzard involvement in all this. Since you know, the original topic was focused on them, and not China's policy as a whole.
---
I do hold the belief that the government should not meddle in the affairs of corporations unless they break the law, no matter they be China or the US. China of course, violates this on a daily basis, nothing new about that. But calling US senators to pressure Blizzard is along the same vein. As it's essentially another form of "governmental entity meddling with the affairs of a private corporation".
---
That of course, does not stop us consumers from refusing to do business with Blizzard, nor does it stop the US from sanctioning China. The former is simply a form of free-market mechanism doing its thing, the latter is a government-to-government political policy. But neither of these have much to do with calling senate on Blizzard itself.

---
Great.. I just started to play in T1 only with M&amp;A for jump scares and I don't care how many I kill, I just want to have fun with that build -,-
---
We need a Perk which kills Spine Chill. I love to use it as survivor, but I hate it as stealth killer
---
Yeah it is. If they close their application/ps4 you won’t get any points
---
just look to the side when approaching the gen. you don't have to move forward.
---
You can also look at and away from the gen multiple times to make them think the killer is being looped and they are safe to keep working on the gen
---
The amount of time this happened to me while I was trying to learn demogorgon is astonishing. You wouldn't think 15 people would go out of their way to shit talk you in the first week of demogorgon's release, but I guess a lot of survivors have a disgusting superiority complex, and need to validate themselves by trying to destroy the other person's self esteem. 
---
That's why I'm slowly moving to spirit. I have the perks I want, now I'm just saving up a lifetime supply of prayer beads and black wards. 
---
Side note, I have a shit ton of strong add ons, and ebony moris on my try hard leatherface build, my friend group has also saved up moris and add ons with their best killers, and we've convinced some other people to do the same. The crusade starts on Halloween, and only baby Dwights and scoops ahoy Steves will be spared. Don't play survivor tomorrow.
---
Fuck ! I just spent everything I had left on Pop goes for my Freddy.
---
*VISIBLE FRUSTRATION*
---
Sneaky stalky boi
---
Oh I get homophobic messages almost daily. I’ve never gotten so many hate messages before I started playing this game. People would say shit in overwatch over coms but now people on PS4 will literally take the time to type out hate mail to me lol. Standard “tunneling and camping” shit.
---
Well it is happening now, so...
---
You can’t. On PC there’s a post-game chat box where survivors and killers can talk to each other. PS4 has direct messaging I believe.
---
But how would you change hatch mechanic? I understand wanting to remain competitive and have survivors and killers on an even playing field but surely you couldn’t lose that many games to the hatch? If you got a 3 man anyway and one sneaks out the hatch and sends you a toxic message I’d say you are the winner anyway. Interested to hear if you would make any changes to the hatch?
---
Ruin is the best perk on the shrine, but Dance With Me is the most fun.
---
DWM, Quick and Quiet, and Lithe. Ooh boy.
---
I'd rather let them kill me than them let me fix 5 gens
---
I want to get to another match, not stick in this one for the next 5+minutes
---
I know about these tricks, but for me this game is not suppose to play like this. Maybe a buff for M&amp;A that when it reduces the heart beat to 0, then it also kills all detection perks of survivors.
---
Or would this too strong for Ghostface when he is in stealth?
---
Finally the instaheals shitshow will end.
---
Well but why would you care about the "whole team"?
---
from DCer's perspective it probably looks like this: "I want to go and find another match"
---
They are not having fun and they don't care about randoms they queued into
---
Ha, I knew it! :D
---
This is strangely adorable.
---
Run anti genrushing perks such as hex ruin thrilling tremmors and overcharge
---
Fix maps and nerf swf. After that it’s honestly on the killer for not applying pressure
---
I agree but I think killers feel really limited in the builds they can create, feels like high ranks ruin, pop and the like are crutch perks
---
mods: WitCH hUntING, seriously, there is a point where getting the name out of the toxic people in our community is needed.
---
Agreed!
---
No doubt, red ranks is a different ball game. However I find competent swf teams at green ranks still able to speed through gens and by the time you’ve finished one chase they are already well on the way to escaping. I think the devs are in a difficult position where the game changes so much between ranks and nerfs to things such as gen speed and the like can really destroy people at lower ranks, or not even affect red ranks
---
Hi Mr X
---
Oh no, trapper with an automail arm and leg would be terrifying
---
Yeah I used to miss them a lot too, but I mained Laurie before scoops ahoy came out, so I had nothing but time training myself to hit the skill check. When scoops ahoy Steve finally dropped I picked him up and grinded him out until I got ds, so now, I miss the skill check with 2 characters. 
---
Although I tend to have more luck if I go for it before it enters the zone.
---
&gt;On the flip side, unless they add in something to counter it, it'll now work against Kindred, so that's nice.
---
That's a cute way of acknowledging silent camping.
---
lol
---
Yeah I know what you’re on about, it encourages a really boring way to play the game. However, if you are fine with getting the 3k why not risk hooking the third and see if you can track down the last survivor before he gets hatch, could result in some really fun moments. I guess that’s all nullified if they are just sitting on hatch and the game ends as soon as you get your third kill :(
---
Agreed, going to miss that terrifying/eerie feeling of "haven't heard a terror radius or spine chill go off... it might be !!!\*HALLOWEEN THEME PLAYS\*!!!

Penalty for what? Wanting to have with your friends? 
---
Killers mains love coming up with stupid ideas on how to make swf extremely weak but don't actually realize that a huge chunk of the playerbase would just quit the game, leading to the death of the game.
---
The pumpkin is trying its best ;-;
---
Exactly, I'm at 800 and I learn new stuff all the time! So much information and so little time haha.
---
And playing solo survivor gives the killers an extremely unfair advantage. What's your point?
---
Precisely because Ruin was in the shrine a few weeks back that I didn't think it was gonna come up again. Picked up Hag during the Halloween sale and already got her to like 25 or so.
---
On the plus side, she's actually pretty fun to play so I guess I'm not that mad about it.
---
I can't recall a time I've had an attack from a slur in end game chat, despite having nasty things said to me. That being said, I don't really put out that I'm gay anywhere on my profile or anything (not that there's anything wrong with being prideful, of course)
---
it doesn't result in fun moments, it's rng, either you or the survivor spawns closer, or they're sitting on it
---
and even if the survivor gets there after you, you generally can't possibly stop them from getting in as there's no hatch grab and survivors always win the standoff now
---
Source?
---
Well have you got any other suggestions? I’m a survivor and I can guarantee even when me and my swf aren’t trying the killer struggles to keep up with the coordination and the original problem of gen rushing. particularly during rank reset when we go back to greens.
---
"Dedicated servers will fix everything... right?"
---
I've experienced it probably four or five time so far in the past 2-3days
---
You're not alone it's kinda weird
---
You leave me confused
---
In my opinion learning how to loop properly and knowing good routing are definitely essential to lengthening your chases. It takes time and hours played but you will learn the maps and what tilesets are safer and where jungle gyms are.
---
What helped me a lot when I was starting out was I would always go scout an area around a gen just to get a lay of the land before starting my gen. 
---
To get a better feeling of it honestly you should just watch red rank youtubers and twitch streamers that helped me out as well. Teaches you good vantage points to stand at at loops when youre not quite sure exactly if the killer is moonwalking or just heading straight.
---
Being afraid of becoming like him is why you won't, you know it was wrong and he probably didn't
---
This is why you need to slug the 2nd last survivor. 
---
A key is your only option then
---
That's awesome, thank you
---
Repost
---
Forbid them to use same perks. They are using voice comms so it would be fair if they couldn't run 4x4 second chance shit
---
that's the problem, with the current mechanics there is nothing for the 4th to do, it's fundamentally a bad mechanic, that's why you can even ask
---
the hatch doesn't reward good play, i'd be perfectly fine with the last person escaping if they actually had to fulfill some sort of requirement for playing well in order to do so, but frankly if you let all of your teammates die, i don't think there should be any special reason why you should get a get out of jail free card
---
I got put up against a leatherface who downed me a minute and a half after I used DS, and he dribbled me until I wiggled out. Keep in mind, I was the only Laurie on the team.
---
Maybe, that’s why I think the hatch should be not such a ‘get out of jail free card’ but a chance at survival. Either way rework would definitely not go astray
---
You and all of us know there will be some type of bug in this event. That's what bhvr doesn't deserve any kind of leniency.
---
How can u guys not talk all this time lol
---
For one spirit can be bought f2p while Myers is only through real money, so if you play enough you can get spirit for free.
---
They play fairly differently though, with Myers having a generally slower start with all his stalking, but grows more powerful. Where spirit is just good from the get go.
---
I'm calling 2010s for stealing their format
---
That's the same thing I say when I see more than one person playing a character, and at least 1 person is bringing a flashlight, before loading 4 rounds into my mori shotgun. 
---
Just can't trust them.
---
I played it for like 30 hours and I gotta say honestly it's chases are way more fun than DBD.I'd like to play it more but the low playerbase makes it hard,you either get a hunter that you can avoid by going into a bush midchase or the god who has 9 billion hours ingame who kills you in 0.0001 seconds
---
Spirit is S rank killer, myer sucks there
---
Killers like Billy, Nurse, Freddy and some others have no issue pressuring gens, and that's because they can actually get across these maps fast. Most killers dont have ANY way of getting across maps fast and have to waste loads of time to even attempt pressuring gens. I think that's one of the main issues.
---
Ghost aren't real ,but it should be said

---
Ill get thanatophobia
---
If the survivors don't make mistakes , and the killer is not a Spirit or a Nurse clearly the survivors , almost any killer punishes mistakes and nothing more .
---
So in frustration I threw a hatchet across the map and that hit someone that I then could not find after trying to follow up.
---
one joke
---
Thanatophobia is currently one of the worst killer perks in the game. Its effects are negligible at best.  
---
If you wanna slow down healing, just use Sloppy Butcher or maybe even Coulrophobia instead.  
---
If you wanna slow down the game in general, just use Ruin or Corrupt Intervention.  
---
And before I hear this counter-argument again, no, Thanatophobia isn't even good on Plague or Legion, because if you wanna capitalise on people being injured all the time, you're far better off with tracking perks such as Bloodhound or Stridor.  
---
Why? Because Thanatophobia's slowdown effects is, at most, a mere 15 seconds on a solo generator. It's pathetic. It's one of the most overrated perks in the game, and I genuinely can't understand why so many people just blindly love it.  
---
Not that I'm accusing you specifically of loving it, I just had to get this off my chest.

tl;dr - pls buff fear of thanos

Racial slurs is a culture issue that requires cultural solutions.  It isn't about whether the person who reported it was upset or hurt by it or not.  You can't change a culture issue by ignoring it.

But she strong momma
---
&gt; personally i'd probably just remove it
---
No
---
&gt;  i am forced to slug for the 4k
---
No you're not
---
&gt; it's not fun for me and it's not fun for the survivors
---
Then why are you doing it if you don't even enjoy it?
---
It used to be that the hatch couldn't be closed by the killer and if they wanted the 4K they either had to slug the last two or stand at the hatch for an hour. Now the killer (who is faster and doesn't have to worry about being killed) can close it and start the end game. 
---
This change was favorable for killers and yet we still have people complaining about the hatch. I don't know why it is that people think they just HAVE to get the 4K. Getting a 3K with the last person needing the hatch to get out is such a clear win for the killer.
---
First of all, when it comes to this post, I don't care what words they used. It's forbidden to post shit like that on this sub either way.
---
When it comes to "racial slurs", if you ban a word, it makes people more likely to use it, as forbidden stuff is more appealing, and at the same time makes people find alternatives, which ends up making the issue worse and worse, as you have more and more people using words close to said word for "fun".
---
on top of that, many black people use the N word, especially rappers in their songs. If it's allowed for them, it should be allowed for everyone. Banning everyone but a specific group based purely on the color of their skin from it is more racist than using it.
---
and on top of that, does the N word affect you in any way? if not, you're triggered for someone else, no matter if they are triggered by it or not. Stop telling people what should trigger them.
---
Whoops it’s from Leatherface - it’s BBQ....omg I was so dead... and Ruin
---
Shares are SUPER quick to get its 300ish per level
---
You do know a 3 generator strategy is not the best thing to run right.
---
If survivors work together I can very easily be destroyed.
---
Also nine times out of ten. Killers don't usually go for three gen strategies, it's the survivors who are usually too busy gen rushing to realise they've completed all the gens on one side and gave the killer one.
---
If you want to avoid the strat I suggest you either learn how to space out generators ( you're working on a generator and you see two gen pop on the same side you're on leave that generator and go to a different area) or just run the perk deja vu
---
unlike banning 6 letters, which only makes the issue worse, rules are here for a reason and stop something from happening
---
Pedophile alert.
---
They just put it into the shrine cause of the delayed event. I'm 100% sure
---
Same, I was going against a demogorgon and he was on me the entire game so when all the gens were done and I went down and got hooked I was really hoping to be rescued, props to the killer though for not camping.  I went into struggle on my first hook and I saw a meg coming to rescue me (or so I thought) she decided to get rid of a portal instead of saving me and I died because of it
---
Personally, I prefer the Shape but both killers are fairly strong. I’m not a very experienced player so I can’t give you many specifics but I’ll give a general overview of what I think are their strengths and weaknesses, without using add ons. 
---
The Shape is good due to his small terror radius and initially he cannot be located by perks such as premonition. He is also strong as you tier him up and can be very fun to play as you can play him stealthily allowing you to scare survivors and grab them off gens or you can play more aggressively and down them in one hit. Some weaknesses are the fact that he is very slow at tier 1 and cannot lunge very far. In order to tier up, you need to stalk survivors which can be a hassle if they run away as you are very slow while stalking. If you play against experienced survivors, they may not run perks that detect killers anyway and may find places to block your stalk so you can’t tier up.
---
The Spirit is also a very good killer but personally, I find her ability difficult to use. She is very good at surprise attacking survivors as she can phase walk and turn invisible which is useful when you either see a survivor in the distance or want to patrol gens. She is very fast while phase walking which helps to monitor gens and the exits later in the match. The only thing is, her ability is very reliant on sound. When she phases, she cannot see survivors but only their scratch marks. In order to properly play her, you need to be very good at listening to audio and following scratch marks as well as knowing survivor’s possible routes and tactics. One other good feature is the fact that even when standing still, she looks like she is phasing which can be used to trick survivors. 
---
Perk wise, I believe it’s fairly balanced between the two. My personal favourites are Hex: Haunted Ground on the spirit and Play With Your Food on the shape.
---
Haunted ground spawns two lit hex totems which when cleaned give everyone the exposed effect so it’s good to use if you plan on running hexes. Play With Your Food is the most helpful with stalking as you receive tokens each time you let your obsession escape which increases your movement speed. It’s useful if you plan on tiering up so if your obsession does get away while stalking, it doesn’t really matter. You can also keep them in your line of sight and stop chasing for a movement to get the speed buff.
---
Obviously there are other perks that are useful but these are my recommendations. To summarise, both killers are strong but the spirit requires more practise as a killer in general to be able to use her ability correctly whereas the shape is easier to get the hang of. Both have good perks but the spirit’s (At least in my opinion) are easier to transfer to other killers whereas the shapes are more specific.
---
Thanks for reading this far, sorry if there are any spelling mistakes, I hope this helps!
---
stop doing that all together then?
---
Hold on. Hows he worse then demo?
---
That's not giving the killer an unfair advantage. Solo survivor is literally what the game is designed for and what it's balanced around. It's the baseline. Any level of SWF is an advantage over solo queuing.

Increase the inefficiency penalty for multiple people repairing a single generator.

---
Because he just got the game and only plays KYF? What are you talking about kid?
---
Wow thanks!
---
Omg this is so accurate, the random thtow always lands the one you aim, pure farts.
---
Dude, killer can be such an amazing time sometimes. Like once, I was Ghostface, playing normally, but I saw this Nancy floating upwards during a chase, and I just stopped and stared. Afterwards, I just downed everyone else, but each time she came around, I'd crouched away and hide, trying my best to look terrified. Everyone ended up having fun, and apparently, their day was stressful and I ended up making them laugh, so it was a load of fun! I also let everyone live too so that kinda helped the mood.
---
And then I have matches where I try a new killer and get teabagged by everyone after each pallet and at the gates, and just like that, the mood is ruined for me :/
---
You can keep it on 16 and dc in exit gates after getting footage. Keep on playing but not gaining pips. Shitty thing to do thou.
---
Meanwhile Tapp isn't getting recognition for also being a sneaky boy. Which means he's doing his job too well.
---
100% agreed
---
Turned out, he don’t see so well, so he missed.
---
I'd probably do Dwight and then Jake and then Claudette unless you have other dlc's already.
---
Nurse is stronger, but less annoying
---
I was like that with Leatherface, missed bbq, so I picked him up and ended up enjoying him a lot.

INTRUDER ALERT: HEX RUIN IN THE SHRINE
---
“The Hex Ruin’s in the shrine?”
---
I feel like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dou52n/name_a_more_iconic_duo/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) was the same match
---
That doesn't change the fact that nothing about hatch has any benefit to the killer. I'd be fine with hatch if keys only let one person in and it went back to spawning after 2 gens have been done.
---
I dunno, it's personnal point of view, but when OoO wasn't showing Old-Freddy when you were out of the dream, it felt unfair to play against (killer knowing where you were thanks to your own perk, but you getting almost nothing out of it was a big bummer)
---
Am I right they skip the Switch?
---
Survivors.
---
Nah, most people I know just don't like running Tapp unless they want to unlock his perks.
---
I literally was just thinking about something like this and I had a perk idea.
---
Betrayal: When a survivor summons the entity during a sacrifice (Tier 2), all survivors who are not healing or being healed have their auras revealed for 3 seconds.
---
I like to think that The Traitor died on the hook due to selfish gen rushing survivors focused on themselves so they have the ability to see those who are betraying their teammates.
---
Well that's saddening.
---
So you're THAT guy. huh?  
---
Jk, at least you aren't using Plague.

Welcome to DBD on the PS4.
---
Idk how he played, but I really liked how the old Freddy played. It made more sense for him to not be able to hit you until you’re stuck in the dream opposed to you being drawn into the dream when you’re smacked. I also just don’t understand the point of being in the dream other then I think it makes it easier for him to hear you.

Does anyone here experience the 'infinite loading' after every game? Not sure if it is caused by my internet or my pc
---
Unnerving presence works on jigsaw boxes.
---
However it's not recommended to use it simply because it only really affects baby survivors.
---
Most competent survivors can hit unnerving presence skill checks because you can't use huntress lullaby to make it more effective it's pointless.
---
The add-ons that affect skill checks workshop Grease, razor wire and interlocking razors are all based on survivor skill making them really bad add-ons
---
For Survivors that can hit skill checks giving them more skill checks doesn't help in fact increases the chance they might get more greats.
---
Interlocking razors only punished survivors who messed up on skill checks if they don't mess up it's a pointless add-on.
---
Instaheals are gonna be reworked in the update
---
Traps do not stop in the terror radius
---
&gt; That doesn't change the fact that nothing about hatch has any benefit to the killer.
---
I just told you why that's not true. When the hatch needed 2 gens done to spawn for the last survivor, games where one survivor was left with less than 2 gens done would take forever because that last survivor would either be too afraid to touch a gen or they would waste your time out of spite. 
---
I'd be fine with the key idea, but I never want to go back to being forced to finding that one dude who is intentionally wasting my time.
---
Hahahaha yesterday a killer did this to me-
---
Do they really loose items when killer DC? Last time it happened I didn't loose mine
---
They only stop in a chase not in the terror radius.

Deep wounds is the only thing that will stop in The Terror radius

T1 Myers already has it

---
I feel like it's too late for that. Imagine having all the perks and multiple skins on Ace and getting something like "bonus 10% luck" when someone else has faster exhaustion recovery.
---
At least for the first time ever someone gave positive and negative effects. Most of the ideas I've seen were "give everyone a slight boost to something and maybe nerf them slightly across the board"
---
I also like it how you made it interesting and didn't just increase base stats, like giving meg bonus movement speed or giving dwight bonus gen repair speed
---
I've never had anything Homophobic messaged to me but I remember someone spammed my best friends steam profile with the N-Word over a hundred times because they were mad.
---
You joke but my friends have broken into my house before. One time I wasn't even informed until he just texted to "turn around"
---
Hag
---
Pretty much the only killer besides scratched mirror Myers to give me a genuine jumpscare
---
The first time I stepped on one of her trap I literally threw my headphones across the room

Couple hundred on PC and I'm not sure about PS4 since it isn't tracked but if estimate around 500 - 600

Haha, 3 spots in the whole map and you think thats good? One that includes dropping into the basement. You're off your rocker
---
I have a suggestion: Learn mind-games and end chases quickly
---
I get a weird bug every time the killers offering doesn’t flip over. Task manager opens and automatically shuts down DBD.
---
fucking COOOOORN
---
if multiple survivors are fixing the same gen, it isn't genrushing
---
Yeah this is true, the only other things that jumpscare me are things that shouldn't (I'm very easily jumpy) like failing a skill check when letting go of the gen
---
Wow, I never knew. I always thought that if you leave the match, you would go back to the main menu, as well as lose any BP you would've gotten.
---
I disagree with the her being "noob friendly" part. If you make a mistake with a Blink it can really hurt her after the nerf. You need to be consistent or else you'll lose lots of pressure.
---
(Hag and mirror Myers for jumpscares) Usually Demogorgon because I've never had one that camps yet so its always fun even if u die but he's terrifying in a chase. Mainly because his VFX and SFX are really good
---
NO LONGER HAS ADD-ONS THAT MAKE HER NOOB-FRIENDLY
---
I know that reading is hard, but holy fuck
---
Trapper makes me afraid to run around
---
I know this is probably wack but Wraith
---
He, to me, is the face of DbD and when i first started playing I would dread hearing that bell. He is the OG stealth killer and it makes me very nervous.
---
But then there's Pig with her dash attack that makes me shit myself. And then theres GF who somehow is always behind me. 
---
So basically what im trying to say is, I hate stealth killers. They make my tummy hurt
---
If they dont wiggle and surrender to me i give them hatch. Makes me feel like I'm a merciful king or something lol.
---
Decisive is as good if not better now, downing a non obsession before didn't make you dread picking them up without being sure a full 60 seconds had passed.
---
Scary Movie 2 made me shit my pants!
---
Yes he does
---
Ib4 its just 4 brown medkits
---
Instead of Lithe I use Head On.
---
Stun then disappear.
---
It's basically Lithe, but less effective and more fun.
---
what do y'all have against cowboy jake?? he just wants to yee some haws and have a good time
---
1 Survivor 80 seconds 
---
2 Survivors 44.44 seconds ---&gt; 60 seconds
---
3 Survivors 33.33 seconds ----&gt; 50 seconds
---
4 Survivors 28.57 seconds ----&gt; 40 seconds
---
OR as someone else suggested, SWF lobbies can't all have the same perks. This can encourage tunneling so i don't think they will ever do it, survivors would go nuts and baby rage (even tho, there is borrowed time, unbreakable, decisive strike)
---
OR you buff Ruin and the other totem perks by turning them ALL On and making it harder to tell which one is the right totem. They will waste time doing totems instead of generators. The problem with this, is that good survivors(i for example, don't look for ruin anymore) can just hit red skillchecks and nothing will change.
---
Oh yeahhh. Wraith for me was definitely a killer that put me on my toes in the early days.

flair checks out
---
the first time i hear the demo's chase music in game i was really scared. He just has such an atmosphere that it's hard not to be atleast a little nervous when he's around
---
It definitely made much more sense to have old Freddy but he was just terrible, so they had to give him a rework
---
Even when he's not near you he's scary, the roar of him portalling
---
Prayer beads spirit. It's the only killer that you really can't see when they are approaching. You can look out for a Myers or ghostface but prayer beads spirit just appears out of thin air.
---
Once you get out of potato ranks, people will stop assuming that you're using their base perks.
---
The NAT type errors hve increased for me since the mid-chapter patch after Ghost Face. I *never* had any problems with this error but since this update I‘m getting it very frequently. 
---
Sometimes I spend more time restarting the game because of infinite queues and NAT type errors than actually playing it.
---
At low ranks yes. It's a terrible perk at high ranks.
---
Who do you play and what rank?
---
Don't put portals at the start (just 1 portal as soon as you spawn), it's a waste of time, they don't guarantee you hits or hooks. 
---
Learn how to use your shred, don't spam it at every pallet
---
Save the best for last is good on him because you can hit with you shred and lose 0 stacks when you find the obsession, but you gotta get used to it
---
What are you talking about lol, you can get rank 1 with this setup if you have half a brain
---
I didn't do the best but yea it's meant to be the dbd logo
---
Claudette, the perk Self care is needed if you are new. Don't listen to the ones that tell you it's an useless perk, they probably have 1k hours and know how to run the killer and all of those things (even tho at rank 1, i see a lot of people going down in one Hit because they refuse to heal)
---
Nice one😂
---
smol dweet hiding in the closet
---
Hallowes blight II: Electric Boogaloo but without pustules and a story.
---
Thats why i have my skillcheck om mouse button 4
---
except the demo's shred is good only on certain loop (shack or bus, for example), while the snares are usable on every loop of the game.
---
lol i am actually working on getting BBQ right now. Hag is amazingly fun holy shit. its kind of sad that so many killers are DLC i wouldn't get them if not for the sale honestly.
---
It's BHVR, you know it's going to be busted.
---
Vomit is stored in the balls
---
Oh look Billy, another "traitor killer idea" who's completly denied by SWF.
---
I'm such a scrub - I saw this and thought "oh, the rift must be out" - booted up the game thinking this was how new objectives are displayed.
---
This Vommy Mommy main salutes tips his tiara to you fellow Vommy Mommy
---
She is definitely the most underrated killer in game. Insta Heals, adrenaline,  We'll Make It, Self Care so many things countered natively.
---
every time i win a game as killer and it's loading the lobby i brace myself for the abuse i'm about to receive  
---
when i get my ass kicked and the survivors teabagged me? *crickets*
---
Quality meme. Good job dude.
---
Little baby dweet
---
whats DS?

---
Now watch, as they deliver it completely broken!
---
YOU’LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE!
---
‘Then he escapes into the forest, never to be seen again’
---
Yes it is.
---
While it is certainly less efficient to team up on a gen, the penalties aren't strong enough. 9 seconds for 2 people, 20 for 3 and 30 for 4. These may *sound* severe; but 3 people can easily 0-100 a gen in the time it takes the Killer to pick up and hook a Survivor, then walk over to the gen.
---
Plus, it's always better to have on fully repaired gen than two half-repaired gens.
---
Spirit with prayer beads
---
Hatch spawning at 5 gens is not to give a free escape for the 4th survivor even though it works that way.
---
Hatch spawning at 5 gens is a way for the killer not to be held hostage by that survivor because he got mad for being destroyed and decided to hide.
---
your pizzeria is located in a forest?I didn't know the huntress was your manager...
---
&gt; We are ALL officers on this great day!
---
Maybe, but I bet not all of them have a license like I do :D.
---
&gt;  this is also technically gender neutral, so you can't sue me for that w For they either DOLT!
---
Wat.jpg
---
&gt; is in complete denial that
---
Eh, I think it's more the "mommy" part. Sounds pretty pedophile tbh.
---
When exactly was it postponed more than once?  As far as I heard there was only the initial postponage.
---
Yesssss! I was hoping for it!
---
Oh yeah, exactly what we need, more people with f'n ruin.
---
There's a hard limit on how long these things can take, which is especially apparent when up against toolboxes.
---
Yes, the hatchets are strong enough to cut pizza, sadly we are only allowed to use them for work.
---
&gt;Why should it hurt my progression if the other side sucked? I don't understand why I'm punished for killing the survivors too fast. Isn't that the point?
---
It goes both ways. Survivors completing stomping on a killer and getting all 5 gens repaired while he chased a single survivor also prevents everyone in that trial from pipping. 
---
Emblem is not perfect but it tries to promote more interaction between both parts.
---
How...?  
---
  
---
These kind of accusations can literally ruin someone's life if the real world, so you shouldn't say that lightly for no reasons.  
---
At best it's a mother fetish thing, which is equally creepy as a pedo thing IMO, but is much more socially accepted... for some reason...
---
I was just leveling up Hag D: although Its not that bad since I will also get Devour Hope and Third Seal. I think I'll buy Dance with me to make a ninja build
---
Well that's too bad,how about borrowing some beartraps from that McMillan guy?it's always fun watching a claudette step in one of those!
---
I’ve realized that every time BHVR has a major screw up either ruin or bbq become available on the shrine
---
Didn’t say they didn’t, calm the duck down dude.
---
Are they removing his terror radius in T1? I just got doctor..
---
ahh yes makes sense I know what DS is havent seen it referred to that before. thanks!
---
It wasn't, it is just a joke.
---
I think movement speed when reloading is better in this situation

---
If you're the last one alive and you haven't felt a terror radius for a while - i'm not lost, i'm stood by the hatch waiting for you to jump in and end the game please come over
---
Well he scares me
---
:D
---
It being transferred makes the perk better than it just disabling your TR. Any survivors within your terror radius when you get the hit would know instantly you have Dark Devotion if it just disappeared like Tinkerer, including the obsession. Currently it will often take the obsession a while to realise that you have it, and even if you're sneaking up on someone who is within the TR of a downed obsession you can still surprise them as they'll be hearing the terror radius at a farther distance. And besides, you can travel way further than 32m in the 30 seconds it gives you.
---
I regularly get a down and some free hits from Dark Devotion every game (on Hag for what it's worth, who I don't even think is the ideal killer for it). Compared to people running Haunted Grounds for an instadown or two every match I think it stacks up.
---
Yeah
---
And?????????
---
Why terrible? What healing perk are u supposed to use at high ranks (in solo que), without adrenaline and steve/nancy's healing perks?
---
Use Ruin, pop goes the weasel and apply good map pressure and be smart in chases and you have bought yourself a lot of time. If you can get that first hook off before ruin is gone then you have already put alot of pressure on the team.
---
Its gonna end up being broken AF.
---
Then Ash sees her and she gets choke slammed
---
Sadly, Waluigi is already in the game
---
Don't forget you now get a BP reward for dying as the obsession.
---
1. Because it's PS4 messages. Nobody with a brain uses that as a way to socialise in the same way one would with e.g. WhatsApp.  
---
2. They seem to not actually be friends. Just two people crossing paths out in the Fog.
---
Please, enlighten me. What does what you want to do in the bed have to do with the game?
---
I used it a lot :(. But simply because I can type messages on my mobile.
---
Darn.
---
so, no head ?
---
I’m not suggesting people should DC, and I used to be much angrier when it happened. Now, since it’s so common, it’s just meh. Personally, i DC when I’ve played the game a lot so my patience is short and the killer is doing something toxic, like tunneling. I’m fine with DCing in that case because it’s not fun anymore, and it’s the only way for me to punish the toxic behavior (since it’ll usually force a black or depip).
---
They're mostly wrong. Can't seem to fathom how anyone can think a longer lunge that doesn't punish you for cancelling it and comes out as fast as an m1 is as bad as a snare
---
Don't think i know how, but if you can give an aproximate date i can dig through tru3's streams.
---
It's a placebo perk in which survivors are forced to heal themselves first to avoid the red progression bar on the generator. So in this case it does stall.
---
at least you can reliably make noed not a thing
---
You can't do shit against DS in the end-game when a gate is open
---
I did to man. Literally just got her to where I unlock the ruin perk yesterday.. All those BPs wasted because I don't like playing her.
---
I said "sounds", and in this context, it's in a place of "mother returning home", denoting children. That's probably why it's interpreted as such.
---
it sighs when uncloaking
---
Unless you want 5 hour queues, this will keep happening. An unbalanced game is better than no game. And if you think no game is better than this the solution is to just stop playing.
---
Roars- BOIIIIIIIIIIII
---
How come that I and many others seem to never have issues with gen speed at any rank even without slow-down perks?
---
Always expect a juke while shredding. Wait out the juke, then shred.
---
I came again.
---
Fun fact, the Demegorgon's sound of when he hits a survivor is the same that my mother makes when me and my brother don't do as we're told.
---
That can’t be a real gun. I don’t think it would be possible to miss that many shots. He practically is touching the guy with the barrel.
---
He was so scared that he turned into his shitty rebooted-self.
---
people on this sub are like:"Matchmaking is fine! GeT gOoD!" when there is a problem and it's evident. I posted about this issue too. seems like memes are more important than real issues.
---
Whispers definitely isn't a crutch - you'll find that virtually every killer build involves some kind of tracking perk. Whispers is great at game start, since you waste less time searching, and great at game end, because you'll know which gate the survivors are trying for.
---
Each killer's power is different, so how you find survivors is going to be different too. Mobile killers can just brute force the issue by searching the map, and some killers have a baked-in tracking ability, but generally you'll want to slot *something* to make the process more efficient.
---
The problem is people are spreading that misinformation as if it's fact, using it as leverage to trash BHVR.
---
Never understood that argument.  I've seen maybe 40 totems in the past 2 years.  I've even started running small game and that only marginally increased my luck finding totems.  I cleanse all the totems I see, but it has never stopped noed.  I don't have a problem with noed tho, I think they ought to build it into the killer role so you know it's coming.
---
I believe 8 out of 10 of the times you are within 8 meters of a totem u will see it without even needing small game. Unless it's on the new school maps.
---
"HE OBVIOUSLY HAD DISCORDANCE CLAUD WTF WERE YOU DOING?"
---
survivors - back at the campfire before being thrown back in the trial
---
One time I was playing as a rank nine killer and I got a rank 19 and once I found out I just felt bad he didn't deserve that now I usually take pity when I feel a survivor is under prepared

I just bought hag rly

Guys should I get Dance With Me for countering spirit or should I get ruin?

Yes please!!!
---
Well i wouldnt, tbh im at rank 5 survivor and get rank 18 teamates most games now. Killer isnt too bad most of the time i get my rank

Let's not forget that Take-Two published WWE 2K20 (that game filled with tremendous bugs), the same company owner of Rockstar and GTA 5.

shes def strong, just not fun for anyone
---
Self care is amazing for begginers
---
It’s real. I believe the guy being shot at actually took a few hits but thankfully they weren’t life threatening.
---
You died for our sins
---
Meanwhile a random Kate/Nea/Claudette is watching nearby, communicating to their SWF mates.
---
Probably not, the same as you can't see OoO survivor as EW1 Myers.
---
But, if it's Blindness on OoO survivor, you can see them while they can't see you
---
im rank 13 too and they take 15 min ..
---
Bruh I justed finished watching the kill counts for candyman
---
I had a game where i patrolled the last 3 gens for 5 mins with no sign of any of the survivors.  
---
They used a key and the 3 remaining survivors all got a free escape.
---
There was no ruin or slow down perks and there was a decent bit of distance between the gens, they just refused to them. Keys are fun :)
---
I'm out of shards...shiiieeeeeeet
---
I have my messages set to private and people will still add me just to send a message along with the invite.
---
I remember this. Guy with gun got caught by police and was proper tackled to the ground. People were surprised the other guy tanked those shots.
---
I am pretty sure that is exactly what happened here honestly as I have gotten good at hatchet dodging and granted I was one hook from death but everyone else was long dead so I walked to her to get it over with but instead we did target practice and it was awesome. Wasn't sure initially of their intentions but doing the shoulder pick up and drop is a great way to get your point across and after playing killer for a few days and holy shit what you have to deal with had given me more empathy for the killers in general, the shit you have to deal with is maddening and the amount of people who auto go to cheating and betraying their team mates if you befriend them who I let lead me to their team mate then slugged cheaty miss claudette and put her on the hook and then gave the remaining two members the door and demanded they do gens. 
---
Also after playing killer I have bought some bright cosmetics cos shit man it's so easy to loose people on a lot of the common maps and feels bad man.
---
I got a 3k almost 4k as hilbilly with a broken mouse (basically my chainsaw was so unreliable that it was better to just be a regular m1 killer because waiting for the chainsaw to rev up only to stop charging immediately after just slows you down) and just going for a chainsaw daily
---
He teabagged me at the exit gate and spammed EZ BABY KILLER so I just responded with "thanks for the daily"

Well Premonition distance is pretty huge. On the other hand, it really gives you no info about which way the killer is going, so you can waste a lot of time if you start hiding but you were actually safe doing a gen
---
What servers you connecting to?
---
The only thing in this meme that wasn’t a nerf is DS. Sure it was bad when it fist got reworked but now that they buffed the stun time it is now the strongest perk in the game. Think about it this way if you think new DS isn’t strong. When you are unhooked you are literally invincible from getting picked up for 60 SECONDS. Old DS I usually only saw one or 2 people run it a game, but now every game seems to be 4 borrowed times and 4 DS, and this was only worse when mettle was strong.
---
True, I wasn't saying you can always do this, I was saying this works and once you get in the habit can nearly always be done the moment Spine chill activates as that always seems to trigger a skill check for me.

Lithe is also map dependent. The newer maps don’t have a lot of vaults.

If a survivor vaults a window too much it will block it off for some time

New Freddy maybe plays better, but he has nothing to do with Freddy Krüger anymore. He plays like anyone else now and everything that made him special is gone.

Wonder just how many times you've missed it in those months

That has nothing to do with what OP said
---
I bet hex huntress lullaby is a pain then
---
I can get 4k easily with all killers using no add-ons at rank 1, what's your point?
---
If you go out of your way to not stalk you are being stupid. If the opportunity to do so you should.
---
You survivors ready for every killer to have hex ruin
---
Prepare for a gigantic grind, like in most Battle Passes.
---
How come?

Also I might have posted this twice on accident, if I did please comment on the second one to delete it

What’s the backstory?
---
Must have had adrenaline
---
im just repeating the facts that drag queens are accomplishing the same things that trans are, therefore are the same. but you need to keep trying to change my mind, because you need to keep your precious dignity. you didn't try you just stood by your "facts" and watched this play out just like i did, and now you are giving up because it probably stresses you that your dignity is in danger. you only provided definitions that say "the guy in the video is accomplishing everything a trans would". 
---
 this is going everywhere. this isn't a little shitshow for me and precious compassion (if that's the first thing you think its about then (you are welcome im not going to insult you because I learned so much)), im slowly and painfully learning how to save the world from trans and drags killing themselves because i called them he on a dead reddit thread on dbds subreddit. one dick will demolish the entire world, and its up to ME to stop it. not you, so get the fuck out of here. im going to make sure every lgbtq person doesnt see my "\*he" and "mental illness" reply, if they do then society will explode. i must now seek out things that trigger me like discrimination against lgbtq, if i dont then that will be fatal for literally everyone. now isnt the time for relaxation, its the time for just me, not you, to save the world
---
it’s happened a second time. seems like every match a survivor DC’s and it crashes, or there’s two killers.
---
Quentin always looks baked out of his mind to me
---
when standing on the ground, your hitbox reaches high enough to be hit from the inside
---
always duck after vaulting this window
---
What level is it? I run it sometimes and noticed that the duration isn't that good
---
Gonna copy and paste from a similar post: 
---
Freddy’s change was absolutely needed, this sub was begging for it, and now everybody looks back on it with rose tinted glasses. He was absolutely awful. Waiting seven seconds to hit a survivor meant nobody feared you. Gens got done and hexes broke right in your face. His time delay meant that he was basically forced to tunnel because not only did he have to wait, but he had no help in chases. I good looper would absolutely destroy him.
---
He was straight up bad. Basic M1 killer with literally no benefits. He was handicapped by his power more than he benefited from it. Having all survivors asleep at once was borderline impossible with how easy it was to wake up, and you could potentially have to wait yet again to hit someone if they self care at a safe pallet.
---
I main Freddy, and have since his release. I understand it wasn’t impossible to do good with him, but it was rage inducing. He genuinely sucked ass. He’s great now. I have no idea how anybody could honestly clamor for old Freddy because he was the worst killer *by far*.
---
David for Dead Hard, Bill for borrowed time and unbreakable, or Jake for iron will. I would go with bill or jake
---
Thanks game loading notes.
---
Oh shiatt, Nea ready to beat mom
---
I try not to dodge because maybe that person just wanted to look cute - and my mercy is always rewarded with nasty matches that end with waiting out the egc tea bagging - BUT I KEEP DOING IT BECAUSE I AM A GOOD PERSON. 
---
But if I see more than 2 toolboxes, it’s a no for me. I’m also not fond of keys since usually those jerks take the hatch in the most obnoxious way possible, but tbh keys are so unnoticeable for my myopic eyes that I don’t dodge since it’s usually a surprise for me anyway. I’ll still play against Neaons and Blendettes, but I’ll use my best perks. Naked David is hot. And I always try to show mercy on Janes (especially cute outfit ones) and Jeffs if they weren’t mean to me. 
---
Oh, if I see OoO tbh I’ll still play because mama didn’t raise no coward, but I’ll be wishing they step on a million legos.
---
right?
---
Oh i read it as Clauddete  vaulted the window and the entity blocked it off :/
---
Lol no worries we all make mistakes :)
---
The lib dems?
---
Doctor I fucking hate needles, going to the doctor and getting shocked sounds awful
---
Yeah it can be insane sometimes. I once had a super shitty game, one hook and all gens done. I managed to hook one of them after and heard his friends so decided to stay. Smacking them and grabbing them lead me to a 4k
---
So never
---
dead perks anyway who cares
---
Oh, I know. The second I saw that you could buy tiers for money, I knew it'd be a horrid grindfest.
---
More or less instantly.  I was also surprised that clown's fat ass didn't body block it.  &gt;.&gt; I play on PS4.
---
This is why I never got too confident post gen power-up as I know things can go so so bad quickly.  Opening the gate is a dangerous business lol.  Freddy is especially dangerous as you'll never know if he has Blood Warden or not.
---
You can oink as the pig?
---
Why is this being downvoted?! It’s so true
---
That rules out the dedicated servers idea. I really don't have any idea sorry. If it happens again I'd send a ticket to the support team
---
Lmaoo now I can’t stop thinking that
---
Of course, I am a trapper and Plague main. 
---
But ofcourse against a boosted SWF a Trapper can be overwhelmed but if you use right addons, even they can be taken down. 
---
Search Not Otzdarva on YouTube that guy has a PhD on Trapper xD
---
Yep pure dick move right here lol! 😂
---
I know he scares me
---
Yeah imo it's better
---
Yeah, blood warden can be a bitch lol. However most people 99 the doors so I think after the gens are done if you get a hook it will wait until you unlock the doors fully before blocking them
---
It's fun when you have urban, but crouch walking is just so slow without it that sometimes I run through an area she already trapped just to have something happen.
---
Uh, yeah most likely and not surprising because it's an absolute headache
---
You do. You spam m1 while crouched
---
I've had this bug too. It's different from the 'infinite window' bug as the entity clearly blocks off the window but it remains usable for the survivors.
---
Actually, she gets fucking yeeted into a tree at mach 2 by Jason’s machete, which apparently hasn’t been sharpened in decades.
---
Don't chase in Tier 1, try to reach tier 2 as fast as possible by stalking far away from survivors. Use M&amp;A on him on every build (best perk for him). Leave tier 2 at 99% until you know you can get at least one down by staying right behind a survivor.
---
D-Strike is a problem you create, you only eat a stun if you pick up the recently unhooked survivor. If you chase the person that unhooked you dont have to worry about D-Strike at all.
---
But Adrenaline and noed should receive a nerf imo, an insta-heal and instadowns for the remainder of the match (if you dont destroy the Totem) shouldnt just be handed to you
---
This aged well
---
As a survivor main nowhere have I ever wanted an unbalanced game. Its completely unfair no matter who it's for. Changes need to happen or the game becomes staid and boring

Why would I play any other way than “gen rush” that’s your only objective as survivor lol. And sprint burst isn’t about necessarily putting distance between you and the killer so the killer can just catch up it’s about putting smart distance so the killer can’t get you because your at an op loop(witch obviously requires knowledge of looping) this isn’t a game of hide and seek, its competitive stop basing “skill” off being able to hide in a locker in basement
---
Yeah that’s what I usually do as killer
---
She's a good killer so I don't see what's there to lose.
---
If this is real it's incredible. This guy is amazing. He clearly gets hit by that second shot but keeps calm, keeps his head and upper chest directly behind the tree. 
---
Truly incredible.
---
Which legion member
---
Empathy for teammates only. That’s why it wasn’t sympathy.
---
New skins droping too?
---
I don't mind the mess that much, but all those loose cords are giving me anxiety. :I
---
I feel we deserve it for some of the shit in the past, like dedicated shitters as they are at the moment from what I’ve heard about them (inconsistent hits that weren’t even the result of the capsule hitboxes but the fact there is a clear ping problem, this from what I’ve been told was meant to be fixed with dedicated servers but ended up enhancing their horrid effects) and ghost face still having reveal being inconsistent as hell. I don’t count the whole Halloween event fiasco because I’m not gonna go into that, my opinion ain’t worth mentioning that.
---
Oh and multi killer matches despite the switch role button being removed on killer/survivor menus. Thanks for making things more inconvenient for us for a good cause that didn’t even work, behavior.
---
Yeah I just feel we deserve the fan made music, we can always have a small option next to each killer slot on killer select menu that says “fan made killer music” and “base game music”
---
When I play her I use range add-ons so I can leave the hook as I please. I also run MYC so I am usually &gt;32M away from the hook. 
---
But I get you.
---
&gt;I had a guy escape into the hatch as I did the hatch close animation. Makes me feel helpless against hatch stand offs
---
Welcome to dedicated servers.
---
So he’s no longer the deadliest son of a bitch in space
---
It would have been in August or early Sep 2019. My twitch name is CaseUK if it helps.  
---
I'm stretching my memory here but if I remember correctly he killed 1 person and 3 people escaped. He's cussing them out and saying they're shit survivors and I see chat chiming in like seals. I felt it was pretty unfair behaviour towards the survivors - so I said 'I don't think they're shit survivors'.  
---
Then he says something like 'you don't think they're shit? that's because you don't know anything about the game'  
---
I never replied but I thought to myself wow fucking thanks man, I'm out.  
---
Also check my chat logs on his channel if you're able to you'll see I've been a supporter for years and was always positive in chat.
---
Wild. I hadn't seen anything about this happening on PS4 so I assumed it was a PC thing.
---
Guess not.
---
is it just me or are survivors really getting shit on recently on shrine of secrets
---
True but I only bought hag for ruin and maybe devour hope
---
This made me laugh more than the actual meme.
---
If it really bothers you the hatch won't open untill they're the last survivor left providing they don't have a key slug the last survivor and go for a wander around you can still get a merciless with a killer with one hatch escape.
---
it still had some kind of use, you could find the killers totem. i think the worst is slippery meat
---
By success,  I mean escape.  Pips are a consolation prize.
---
Is it a taunt teabag or a plea teabag? You should probably actually play survivor and learn to speak butt-dance.
---
dc on hook has a few issues  
---
i had a meg dc on hook yesterday and the whole game i could still hear her crying around the hook
---
How is dc'ing a great play?
---
To protect my rank from devastation 
---
To unite all killers within our nation

A fucking Ruin just before the event. Nice.
---
&gt;If you chase the person that unhooked you dont have to worry about D-Strike at all.
---
I'd rather let someone in red ranks comment on this but from my experience, this is not particularly accurate. One minute is a long time, you can and do get D-struck even if you actively ignore the unhooked survivor and go after someone else first.
---
I feel like her animation should be her chopping the pallet, kinda like what she did to my wood
---
swap Doc and Hillbilly.
---
Also how can you tell its a Trapper, just from a Chase?
---
Well, not exactly a chase but when someone steps into his trap.
---
I shouldn’t have to not kill someone just so another survivor gets a free no skill required escape
---
https://imgur.com/h56UXVY
---
Hang on, it won't be fan made. But what if they go through themselves and make new ones?
---
It’s not fun at all for the killer to be punished for playing too well
---
I guess cause there's no where else to put him unless someone steps in a trap right at the start of a match.
---
Do you believe in “gravity”
---
Be careful, this sub will apparently downvote you to shit for saying locker jukes are pointless.
---
Guess people dont wanna know that their super kewl locker juke was actually just a waste of time
---
Or it could just be removed
---
okay, but Doc and Billy really need to swap.
---
Doc just has to be 30 meters near any Survivor and everyone knows.
---
Billy has to use his saw
---
why are all the comments downvoted lmao
---
Totally agree I am not one of those survivors who point at the exit or tbag deliberately at the killer. I do sometimes wait at the exit for a teammate when playing SWF but that is pretty rare. I think some people take things too seriously when talking about toxicity with this game. We are all going to have different opinions on what is toxic and what is right/wrong. I think the hateful and threatening messages are the worst. They are the main reason I don’t play killer often.
---
Billy usually saws when the match starts so that's why.
---
Their teammate got to escape. Not classy but I would be laughing in the mic if we got an escape like that
---
Only reason why they are less likely to do it is because I'm guessing they make more money from cosmetics on their own characters maybe they have to pay a % to the licence holders for licenced dlc cosmetics and chapters 👍 makes more sense from a business perspective to put resources into the most profitable path. Not sure like but I'm guessing that's why.
---
So cool!
---
Ha! That was incredible lmao well yes, that would actually be incredibly effective lol
---
That is exactly what I'm saying had never happened to me (as r1 killer main) no one has ever done a locker juke and used that time to actually get anywhere. 
---
But that? That was great lol thanks for sharing
---
well i mean. porn !
---
This is real. It was an attempt to kill a lawyer. The lawyer dodged every bullet. haha
---
To be fair, seconds before this he refers to her as "dark meat"
---
Plague is almost noticeable from the jump because I often spawn next to or near one of her fountains.
---
Don't forget about pop goes the weasel. The dbd flavour of the month.
---
The better docs keep they re  shoch therapy for a later free detection. So for this playstile they may be considered stealhier.
---
Bruh, he’s white as hell.
---
Makes sense, it would be cool to see regardless if they did
---
why do all of the males have their hands out like that
---
All kills with props are identified the moment you see their prop. Trapper, Pig &amp; Plague.
---
You mean.. The Entity
---
You want no hatch? What makes you think the last survivor won’t just disconnect in these scenarios? If they have no hope of escaping they have no motivation to continue playing the match.
---
The placement of the gates are also rng that can also play greatly into the killers favor giving a final survivor no chance whatsoever to escape. That also is not a skill based kill. There is plenty that needs tweaking on both sides. But both sides also need a chance in order for the game to be any fun.
---
Shirtless Battle Mullet David King is my go-to
---
and freddy, but you also get the micro-sleep
---
As an r1 killer main you probably time your attacks better to not give enough time but it's definitely something that can work
---
 I had a popsicle, and then I passed out in the snow. And then I woke up, and then I reloaded and I fired, and then I **missed**. I **missed** again, then I fired and I hit something, but it wasn't what I was going for, so I guess I **missed**. I passed out again.
---
Might be wrong, but doesn't Ghost Face's mark show for other survivors?
---

---
Oof, that’s a mood right there.
---
The gates are a much more fair and balanced means of escape. The hatch just punishes the killer for playing well. If the survivor DCed because they “didn’t have a hope of escaping” (which they do) how is that different then the killer DCing when the gates are open?
---
I bet they’re giving Ruin to make up for the delayed Halloween event.
---
God, I love Canadians...
---
Your early game is your weakest point, so things that can help with that are very useful. Your number one job early is to stalk, so addons that increase stalk are very useful. Remember however that stalking two people at a time doesn't build it up faster.  
---
Speaking of two at a time, i find Discordance very, very useful on him. 9/10 games two people will touch a gen instantly, letting you know which corner of the map to head towards. Chances are by the time you are there you will have one or two targets to stalk up to Tier 2/3.  
---
Monitor and Abuse from Doctor is very nice on him, since it lets you get closer in tier 2 to get your stalking off on unaware victims and surprise them with tier 3 for a quick down.  
---
The usual gen regression mandatory perk - Ruin is obviously amazing, but you can also try Corrupt Intervention to funnel survivors to a certain part of the map, making them easier to find early.  
---
Infectious Fright is nice on Michael since you really want to get as much momentum off a tier 3 as possible. You only want to pop tier 3 literally the second you hit someone - then when they go down from this, anyone nearby will scream and you'll have time to chase them down with the rest of your T3 and get two or more downs which can win you the game.  
---
Since lethality is already in his kit via T3 i tend not to like things like Devour Hope, Rancor, Make Your Choice etc so focus on gen regression and information. BBQ is fine for points, Whispers is nice for tracking people down to stalk, and at the end of the day, he is an M1 killer so the old Spirit Fury/Enduring combo is still good on him. I personally dont run his own perks on him very much - he's quick enough in T3 to not need PWYF, you should be aiming for one shot kills, so using STBFL is not very optimal imo and Dying Light is just 'fine' imo.
---
Did a bullet hit him? Where?
---
Yea intentionally costing me a pip, such skill.
---
That’s a hot take from someone who’s so bored of the game.
---
But when you unhook someone, the trap activates so there isn’t really anything you can do. Sure you can crouch to get there, but he moment someone is unhooked she can teleport and even if you run away, the scratch marks and blood are still very fresh.
---
What happens in 3 hours?
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dp629d/flashlight_hackbug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

Ok
---
Thank you! But what perks should i use? I dont have m&amp;a yet. my current build is ruin,dying light, PGTW,nurse's (I unlocked the teachable, but still don't have it on myers)
---
I love it too
---
Stake out is great though
---
&gt;Or it could just be removed
---
No point in removing something that is fine and has loads of ways to play around it. Besides, whats the big deal of having 1 out of 4 survivors escape?
---
Lol, I was worried someone would make it first
---
patch
---
Finally
---
Imagine if iridescent head was changed to break pallets with hatchets
---
Because it punishes the killer for playing well, and rewards the survivor for doing awful. Also they have a perk that lets them see the hatch from a massive range. It’s an entirely survivor biased mechanic with little counter play other then luck on the killers end
---
Enjoy the game dying because that’s what’s going to happen the draw for casuals like me was having some fun running away from killers and maybe escaping every now and again but now every game is the spirit or ghost face with multiple overpowered perks and everybody dead in the first two minutes it’s a waste of time.
---
For those wondering, the other side of this wall is the top of basement stairs.
---
Allright I won't give you sensible advice, you asked for opinions so heres mine I think it's stupid to want to change a game mechanic because your an inexperienced killer there's ample ways to secure the fourth kill. It isn't rng finding the hatch it's rng where it spawns. Play more and learn predictable spawns and go find it before the third survivor is killed if you can't do that you shouldn't be rewarded for being a no skill required killer.
---
On the survivor icons at the bottom of the screen yeah.
---
I should have stated this, Thank you for that!
---
Is it just me or does your heart rate go up when you've got a good feeling that you are going to win and escape
---
Well I actually like running alert for the reason that it gave you a lot of Information on the Killers Position and movement even if they are somehow "cloaked". Guess I wont use it anymore now.  Its a shame.
---
Get fucked. If you think finding a free, guaranteed escape for playing terribly is balanced you’re an idiot.
---
So the entire bottom tier is worthless.
---
GF shows the mark and Myers does the sound when he comes out of tier 1
---
Bruh moment
---
no matter if it glows or not, it goes.
---
That’s what I’m saying
---
Not a fan of horror (ironically I love DBD), but the concept sounds really cool so I’ll probably check it out!
---
I get you. I have some dyslexia, that typeface helps me see any spelling errors and such

---
Thanks for the laugh guys XD
---
Who needs a knife when you have FASHION?!
---
Thanks for the advice! :D
---
I’m so happy Thanatiphobia Nurse and like Doctor are the two killers I don’t the teachables on and I don’t feel like leveling Nurse and now I just need Overwhelming Presence from Doc and Stridor from Nurse 
---
And all the Demogorgons perk but let’s not bring that up
---
I don’t realsie it for months, mainly cause I almost always choose one of them. and I thought it might help other new players out
---
How long have you been playing op?
---
Fuck them
---
Stops people doing gens for 1 minute, that’s dumb.
---
1-2 months after it was free on PS...I only realize cause I recently stack dead hard with sprint burst and I realize dead hard is always off....lol
---
Gates are fair and balanced when there are multiple survivors or when they are far enough apart that the survivor at least has a chance to get the gate open between patrols during end game collapse. Otherwise the killer just can chase them until they run out of time once found.   Hence the no hope of an escape.
---
The hatch is there as a mechanic to keep players engaged until the match is over. Is it perfect? Hell no. But it’s better than the alternative of just removing it without something to replace it.
---
Also I’m not condoning DCs. It sucks and both sides do it. Obviously survivors do it more often. But they will be only more frequent if there is no mechanic in the game giving a reasonable chance to survive.
---
you want to explain how the EGC change wasn’t favorable for killers?
---
You're not punished by getting a 3k youve won, hatch exsists to end the game and for the last survivor to have a chance at escape
---
Hehe, congrats OP. :p
---
To add-on that, you've inadvertently just cottoned on to why killer perks and add-ons that exhaust survivors can be extremely useful.
---
7 minutes,26 days,2 months and 2 years later. Pog
---
I mean, theres a pretty likely chance that something will still be wrong with the patch, so dont get your hopes too high my dude.
---
The doors often spawn on other ends of the map, if you can’t outplay or at least hide from the killer you don’t deserve to escape, hide until they go check the other gate-simple
---
i'd love to hear how it is, i really would
---
Oh boy
---
Frank
---
well it will be in a few hours :)
---
Going straight to EGC and having both doors power ends game faster and gives the last survivor a chance of escape even though they don’t deserve it
---
Did you try to look up? He could've been chain blinding. Unless you actually mean "forever" like it never went away until the match was over.
---
Not all the time, but theoretically
---
yeah 90% of hag players use, but in my end only 10% get to use MYC because they just hang about don't really go anywhere. but again, i dont like to generalise, theres plenty of good hag players out there that dont really play that way, ive been told by really good hag players that the secret is to trap between loops, and thats how they get success on their games, ofc this is all context dependant , rank 20 have to play in a whole different way than rank 1 players. its like running bamboozle on lower levels, its useless since they dont really loop tiles.
---
I see where OP was coming from though cause if a Myers or Ghostface are proper sneaky you won't know till those things happen, you know.
---
When for iOS? America here
---
Yep.
---
That's PR for "It's never happening."
---
Well it looks great
---
A solid build for Myers would be Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel, A Nurse's Calling and Monitor and Abuse. You could go BBQ instead of Nurse's if you want extra bloodpoints.
---
Dude I would seriously probably laugh my ass off if that happened to me lol at myself for being so stupid and them for being so ballsy.
---
Yes it never went away till match is over.. i have a video on it but just on my phone cos i dont have game recorder.
---
Sure, everything should work as simple as “who click the button first”, so there is zero mind game and only competition of internet lag. What I mean is it is an intended in-game mechanism that is totally understandable.
---
You can close the hatch, there. Exit gates are usually too close for the survivor to be able to open one before the killer gets there.
---
Oh... I was newish then. Rank 15 prob
---
This + explode gens if someone is touching it when the axe lands on it would actually be really fun
---
Nice! Did you get that mask on 2019, or is it older? How'd you do it??
---
I’m also a casual gamer. Have you ever tried playing Killer? Maybe that will help you understand why people play those killers. Answer: people enjoy playing as them. And frankly, we don’t want people like you who just complain and complain and complain without offering any solutions. Mindlessly ranting about the game and its flaws will help absolutely nothing in the future.
---
Premonition has a long-ass cooldown and tells you something you should already know (in which direction the killer is)
---
Spine Chill lights up when the killer is looking at you. if it lights up for longer than a second, the killer is probably going to check your generator
---
Spine Chill has many more uses, but I don't want to overwhelm you.
---
You’re taking the piss.
---
Well, at least you have an Exhaustion perk for every situation.
---
I’m talking about when they are not spread far apart obviously. In those instances there is no hope. You can’t say that it doesn’t exist. It’s up to rng.
---
What isn’t up to rng is knowing that the hatch exists. Either plan ahead with the hatch in mind with your play style or suffer the consequences.
---
I'd still go with Balanced Landing tho. While Sprint Burst is better for a stealthy playstyle on paper, it's here for the same reason Balanced Landing is - as an option during a chase
---
Balanced Landing opens more options during the chase and doesn't stop you from running when you know the killer is far away
---
Or remove the bs free escape and make it take some skill. It’s not fair for the killer if they’re punished for killing 3 people, it’s stupid. If the doors are far the survivor will escape either way in the current game.
---
*crickets*
---
Ummm no:
---
1st person gets unhooked, tunnel them, ds
---
2nd preson gets unhooked, tunnel...
---
3rd person...
---
4th...
---
Tunneling is off the hook, not sticking on 1 surv the whole game
---
I have but I find survivor more interesting I play 90 percent of what I consider toxic killers and have seen maybe 5 to 10 shitty survivors teabagging and all that bullshit. Hex totems need to go the killer just camps them and barbecue chili is stupid the maps are small as is.
---
I feel like it's pretty underrated. It can be slow to get going, but once you tag 2 or more people, then you can really start snowballing.
---
- Tag one survivor, it does basically nothing. Survivor on the hook doesn't know who's saving them. Big whoop.
---
- Tag 2, you can hook one, chase a third, and now the last survivor is forced to go for the save since one is occupied and the other doesn't know where the second was hooked. If that survivor is far away from the hook, they often assume someone else is going for the save. Plus the survivor on the hook now doesn't know who's coming to save them.
---
- Tagging 3, if you chase the fourth, you can "steal" a hook state from someone since nobody will know where the hooked survivor is, ESPECIALLY if you hook them somewhere more "hidden" like upstairs in the thompson house or the basement. Sometimes survivors on the hook can even waste a hook state by trying to free themselves with 3 seconds left on first hook state when someone is right around the corner.
---
- Tagging 4 is the same as tagging 3 but you've got more freedom on who to chase.
---
I also hate going against it, personally, and if I get tagged by it, I'll hunt the hex more than when Ruin is active.
---
I know it's not a top tier perk, but it's still one of the stronger ones.
---
Yeah,i have mentioned this as an idea before on this sub because it is unfair for the killer to not tunnel and still get hit
---
No Pebble nor Head On?
---
You are no troll and you aren't even a clown
---
Alright! 5 less levels to level Tapp!
---
The first Killer perks I got were the Hag's so while it's exciting to see Ruin up there, I don't need it. I'm working on leveling Nurse rn, so I don't need Thanatophobia. Dance with Me is a great perk, but I main Kate so...
---
I’ve play this game for hundreds of hours and I’ve never intentionally dced. Time-out alone sounds fair enough but it still feels unfair for the rest people in that match. But if you reward those people without taken away BP, there’s the potential of exploit. Anyway it’s just my idea, any time I talk about this I receive a whole lot of downvotes. I know there’s people who simply disagree but we all know the rest are entitled players thinking they can dc however they want. Yes, a harsh punishment may result in them leave the game, but if then the game environment is better, there’s potential for more new players.
---
I don’t understand what you mean. I also don’t understand why I’m being downvoted. There are a lot of perks that give the killer the advantage. In the situation that it’s not a swf, each survivor would put their survival as primary should other suvivors be hooked, considering make your choice is going to be active. Not to mention discordance and hex ruin? I don’t think survivors stand a chance unless you count a hatch escape as a win.
---
1. It's  **Anti-Hemorrhagic**
---
2. Space when healing someone (don't know the console button)
---
Oh well i think it's a glitch.. found a clip on YT..[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=59&amp;v=dfZTMaW6VyM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=59&amp;v=dfZTMaW6VyM)
---
Hahahahahaha
---
Buff thana
---
I'm shitty with Huntress especially when the survivors juke the hell out.
---
Just close the hatch or slug when you’re on the last two survivors like everyone else. It’s not hard lol
---
The wording is confusing. Secondary action is space bar. So basically you need to hold right click to heal and then space bar to use the syringe.
---
The way you worded it, “most killer perks are designed to be op”,  no just no
---
It's not like you can't counter it, but it's just BORING to play against. I don't suicide vs Forever Freddy, but I can get why people do. You play games to have fun, and if it's not fun, then just don't play.
---
Excellent thana? Hell no
---
...
---
Yeah - you can get them all for free for the most part once you get enough shards
---
Really? I got him for bbq, and really wanted to like him, but I just cannot stand to play him. I always do so bad.
---
Is there even a chance that it gets released before Halloween at this point? I have not been following the updates too much so Idk where it is at, I just hope it gets released soon because if it is after Halloween by more than this weekend I just wont care anymore and will be more invested in the holiday season feel.
---
It’s L1 on PS4
---
I’m not saying the killer perks themselves are op, but the perks make the killer op. Read my comment again. The killer has the advantage even if both killer and survivors have all the perks.
---
That’s people for you in general, to be honest.
---
Yes. I tested it on the ptb. Pwyf however will be a shit perk on that build because you cant enter a chase unless you hit the survivor.
---
What? People can play however they want. But if they try to defend their actions based solely on the killer they play then that’s not really a fair argument.
---
Yeah it's not available in the UK or most other countries for that matter  :(
---
My average que time for killer is under 10secs I'm not even kidding.
---
R1 eastern US on ps4
---
Survivor at r4 takes like 3-5mins tho usually lol
---
Depends on how many gens you did
---
Autohaven, hands down, is one of the best maps in dead by daylight.
---
Am I the only one who thinks we should get some small compensation

That's pretty good
---
i can definitely agree on that &lt;3
---
If you are the last survivor, dont wiggle.
---
Is this ps4?
---
1. We do, it’s only delayed. 
---
2. I fail to see your argument? What are you trying to say?
---
alright good advice
---
Those 6 downvotes must all lack understanding of what you said or you are too incompetent to accept how wrong you are and how poorly written your first paragraph is.
---
Unpopular opinion here, i love Hawkins lab
---
Vibe check
---
Because the last survivor isn’t getting a free escape, if anything the killer is the only person that can guarantee his success by slugging and downing the last guy or just camping hatch if it’s already spawned in.
---
Have you considered that sometimes you get matched with shorty teammates? It’s not fair to that one player if his mates are bots and they throw the game. You should play some survivor sometime, because your post and comments make it very clear you rarely ever play survivor.
---
It literally took me 10 seconds to find it myself. Don't be lazy. That said,
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONVJnkbAm0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONVJnkbAm0I)
---
It’s really bad and clunky you’re not missing anything
---
yeah there is actually a post about it:
---
[https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/69420/](http://youtube.com/watch?v=6n3pFFPSlW4)
---
Huntress: you like some LEG?
---
Lery's annoys me way more than it should. I'm fine with Hawkins and usually enjoy the game but Lery's just doesn't capture my interest.
---
Best map is temple of purgation of Mother's dwelling.
---
Dude , she needs way more buff the undetectable was a start 
---
Her nerfs were really bad , her traps are useless in endgame and really not help the game slow down at all plus her addons don’t do much for her
---
Anyone know what time it’ll be released GMT?
---
Comes from comment section on this official tweet:
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/deadbybhvr/status/1189291721156448256?s=21&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Holy fuck, no need to be rude
---
Yeah go play the game before all these Jeff's as a killer, fucking hell mate it's not even nerfs, it's straight out balancing
---
Kinda yes and no coz u dead when the killer got mori
---
LOL, won two matches last night using this build.
---
Good times!
---
Wait a minute i seen this one before
---
Sure you can work through it, it just takes 10 years and it's not fun.
---
Still more fun than prayer beads though for sure, that's the only thing I d/c against.
---
Smh not even gonna credit me for the meme?
---
I don't, but it's 50/50 I'm just toyed with by some asshole who watches noob3 too.  Is what it is.
---
Luck?
---
Dude, I hate games like this. I'm a killer main and that pisses me off as well. I had a hillbilly game in LERY'S NO LESS. I managed to chainsaw the first survivor i found. which was damn near impossible, they immediately dc'd. I mean at least have some kind of decency for your team.
---
Claudette after dropping 80 pallets on the killer’s face and they down her once.
---
it's bugged in certain windows, it wont work at all
---
But only after you finally give up running after her to heal her
---
I hate the obvious split maps like Azarovs and the one Macmillan estate where its two big areas with a narrow connector with the gens set up in a 3-1-3 I shape.
---
Its too easy for a killer to lock down the half of the map that the middle gen is closer too. The survivors will 3 gen themselves a majority of the time and it just becomes a standoff.
---
This is kind of a hard debate, because as some people have already said, some killers need this perk to have any sort of threat in the game at all, and some killers with this perk is just unfair. I don't like the idea of locking any one perk to specific killers, so I think, personally, that the real way to fix NOED is to buff weaker killers. If all the killers were around B, A and S rank (maybe bump those S ranks to A, because the S rank killers are a little too good) then NOED could reasonably be nerfed or whatever, because with no killers lacking in threat, NOED would no longer be necessary. I personally like Devour Hope much better than NOED. It's actually more powerful when it activates, but it requires more thought and work than NOED, and survivors always have the chance to stumble upon it and cleanse the hex before it becomes an issue.
---
It should be noted that all stealth killers get this. T1 Myers, Ghostface, Wraith, Pig, etc if I forgot one.
---
Stealth killers love that maps, they are so good
---
Honestly, for anyone using Empathy, I'd suggest trying out Bond instead, if only for a few games.
---
- If you're injured, it doesn't require another injured survivor to find someone to heal you, and if a survivor is outside of Bond range, they're probably not worth the time it would take to get to them for healing, anyway
---
- Knowing exactly where the killer is isn't important. All you need to know is if the killer is near you, and if they are, if they're in a chase.
---
- Hear the heartbeat but no survivor? Killer's coming your way. Hear a heartbeat + see a survivor running? Killer's in a chase and you're safe. See a survivor running + no heartbeat? You're safe.
---
- Bond tells you when someone is going for the same unhook as you, and if they're likely to get there before you, letting you save time.
---
But Unbreakable isn't an Ash perk.
---
Honestly, if she had more traps, even 6 - 10, and she's been improved a fair deal. That means you don't have to be "tactical" with the only power she has.
---
Crouching is great, but it's slow and anyone who uses the charge attack is wasting a lot of time with her.
---
"Set your expectations low, so you are never disappointed."
---
Pig is still one of the worst killers. The stealth buff is better, but her power is only situationally helpful in a chase, and it really hurts that you move slowly when you're stealthed. For climbing rank or getting kills, there is no advantage she brings over killers like Ghostface or Myers. She will remain bottom 5 until she gets a better buff.
---
How would it work for wraith and Myers?
---
Probably didn't feel it. Too much adrenaline.
---
Yeah this is just a gif. They do sometimes hide clues and whatnot, this is not such a time.
---
Mothers dwelling can be so unbalanced with window placements some killers experience infinites all over again
---
Ah I play at red ranks. You literally cannot won using only M1 and never using ur power, and no one will be caught in a dead zone. At least very rarely.
---
Have heard pwyf is God tier on him but haven't tried it myself
---
I tip my hat to you. One legend to another.
---
I accept offerings or gifts as killer! One does not dabble in the arts of butt-dance
---
Wraith: Cloak form
---
Myers: Evil Within tiet 1 onlu
---
Keyboard and mouse is way better for the nurse
---
I just found it on google. Maybe that’s why
---
Sorry im about to ruin your post but I can't help it gravity wasn't invented
---
Wraith in cloak and T1 Myers can currently he viewed with OoO. Same with Ghostface in Night Shroud. Undetectable will fix this problem.
---
Demo is far superior to freddy. Your best off waiting for the shrine if you want Freddies perks
---
in quebec
---
I would buy helios 300, but many ppl say that I has a lot of light bleed, which ruins dark games...
---
Don't wanna risk it tho
---
Alright because I have it saved from a while ago
---
I'm even gonna 👇 myself
---
Im trying not to r/woooosh you
---
You don't NEED to heal. I often use Bond as my "healing" perk, and I don't run around the map specifically looking for someone, I do other stuff (gens, totems) and wait until someone gets into my Bond range naturally before I go to them for healing.
---
If you're still reasonably new, though, don't feel pressured to drop Self Care. It legit helped me survive WAY more than any other perk did when I was new, just don't get TOO reliant on it and once you feel like you're getting better, try dropping it.
---
The post was about the Halloween update going live someone said
---
I thought the update was going to be planned for before Christmas.
---
They then posted that gif as that would make the hallowed blight a Nightmare before Christmas.
---
I like you’re idea but I wish her traps didn’t have to active in the end game
---
I think i do also remember this one time i escaped with a toolbox almost completely used (i keep it at 10% in hopes of keeping it if we escape) and i still lost the item
---
What I mean is if there is a hat you can’t leave or you’ll die
---
Try it, it feels so good catching up to survivors who think they can take you for another loop and then LF just stampedes over them.    
---
It's also viable at baiting a survivor to go for another loop. If you have 2 or 3 stacks, rev chainsaw a little bit before a pallet, survivors think you either respect the pallet or that they can create enough distance to dodge the chainsaw, neither of which they shouldn't. They need to drop the pallet or go down in 1 hit.
---
My favourite maps would have to be Hawkins for the atmosphere (and it’s also the map that introduced Greg the Demogorgon), Ironworks for nostalgia of the beta/first release and Haddonfield.
---
Least liked maps are the Backwater swamp maps, the rotten fields because of how boring and annoying it is to play on and The Game
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that when I said that
---
I play him at rank 6 and I have decent success with him, definitely try play with your food on him. It's so good.
---
Indoor maps are full of unsafe pallets and windows. They are meant to be killer favoured as opposed to maps like the asylum and hafdonfeild that are survivor favoured
---
2 more hours and you shall suffer slightly less!
---
I'm actually confused about what you mean about sloppy being not strong at tier 1. 
---
As I understand it, the main benefit of sloppy is it slows down survivor healing (which the mangled effect is not a variable change in the different tiers of the perk). The bleeding effect is nice, but not exactly the reason you run it. If it was, you'd think that Wraith perk that lets you track bloodstains much easier would replace it.
---
Not trying to start anything. Just curious what you mean.
---
Will try it eventually, I dont have pwyf on him so I would need to put God knows how many levels in him to get it
---
Just avoid the newer Dell Inspiron gaming line. Their backlight is trash and you cant see anything at all on certain maps. Even at full brightness and adjusted contrast settings.
---
On another note , reduce the timer greatly , 2 minutes or 2 min 30 seconds is too generous
---
Yeah...
---
This happened to me he brought me to the hatch, dropped me and then closed it. Oh and it gets better he mori’ed my ass.
---
Thank you for the answer, I can now imagine what your view must look like inside those masks :D And holy mother of god your Pyramid Head cosplay is amazing! You really make me wanna create masks/cosplays myself
---
If they changed it, it’s back to zero
---
Well I approve
---
Thanks
---
That’s true
---
Today you learned that this is a boilerplate response.
---
The Neatity
---
I think the Unreal version update probably caused some problems on the switch version. I've got it for the Xbox and switch so I'll probably stick with Xbox till they get it worked out
---
Cheers, I'll use that then
---
Gf it's the only killer when the match starts I always assume it's gf so I'm never too disappointed when it's him the no tr scares for some reason pig doesn't scare me
---
To be honest, Dead Hard is the best "scouting" exhaustion perk for how the killer plays. It lets you play greedier since you can often fish for an extra loop + avoid getting punished by using DH, or dodge if the killer is more aggressive than you expected + swings through pallets.
---
If you use that information to adjust how you play for the rest of the match, even if you don't get to USE Dead Hard again, that can be really beneficial.
---
Damn blendettes ruining our baby dweets
---
&gt; Spirit doesn't even need her power to be effective
---
I'm triggered.
---
What would you replace them with? Theres nothing else that ghostface can do beside existing addons that other kills cant. All i can think of right now is a "Longer time to reveal ghostface" addon.
---
Ruin is a nice one. Although as an adam main I was saving my iridescent for the dread locks but ruin is most definitely needed for most killers. Also thanatophobia, goo shine for killers.
---
Bro dont be annoying about it tho... :/
---
The “Woosh” noise when she is phasing will only play outside of her Terror Radius, unless she is using Prayer Beads.
---
There’s no real 100% way to tell WHEN she is Phasing
---
Tbh, I thought the slightly/moderately/considerably tiers reflected the extended time/harshness of the mangled effect. Looking at it again I see its just the bleedout time. That does slightly change things.
---
Claudette and Nancy. Every time.
---
Double bloodpoints plus the feeling of pride and  accomplishment?
---
I didn’t say it removes ping but fixes the problems associated with it. Anyway, I’m referring to how sometimes pc players get matches where they are grabbed/hit across the map while other times it just doesn’t register a clearly obvious strike at an inch away from the killer. Remember, I’ve only heard of it.
---
Oh, I'm in europe, maybe that's why matchmaking times are different
---
Like I said I'm not saying its OP just saying most killers I get stuck with on ps4 are all the same
---
*not op
---
He phrased it as "***It is not a plan*** *at the moment".*  
---
And I'd at least assume that means; They haven't brought it up at all in the office yet rather than; They've brought it up but postponed it because of priorities. But I'd fucking love custom chase music for all killers. 
---
I want some heavy drums and el-guitar for my Legionnaires!
---
Remove the survivors
---
I had an old Alienware 13 R2 that was able to play it on Low Settings, that cost me about $700-$800.
---
I currently now use an Alienware 15 R3 that can run it on Ultra, and that cost me $1,250. A lot of Dell/Alienware stuff is on sale right now. Try to avoid buying it online, because if anything is wrong with it, you’ll be in a world of hell dealing with the online Customer Support and shipping.
---
New player - what's "face camping"? Is that camping at a hook? Or ..?
---
Yea camping survivors on hooks
---
Today's actual mood
---
Try gen protecter myres with ruin, monitor, surveilence and discordance. This build makes generator defense a joke and myres has good stealth in T2 to sneak up on people and with monitor it becomes even easier. Some good advice would be to 99 T2 and wait until your right behind someone with no nearby pallet before you activate it or T3 might be wasted.
---
Excellent. Wanted to confirm. Thank you!
---
The Nea titties.. Hmmm
---
Deliverance, Dead Hard, Borrowed time, and DS
---
The endgame change is a big one, as it means you can't play to what was her strongest area, but it makes sense from a gameplay point of view. You put a helmet on, you open the door, they're fucked now.
---
Adding more traps is simple but it strengthens her greatly by comparison, means she can have pressure from the get-go, not have to wait until the very end which she now can't even do.
---
Poor trapper.
---
I literally made it and posted it myself a week ago
---
"not"
---
I use Borrowed Time sometimes and every time I do, it is so clutch.
---
go to the subreddit page. top right 3 dots. add user flair
---
Oh! Thanks!
---
What if there was an add-on that made Ghostface’s gameplay like Myers, just to shake things up?
---
Jack wouldn't be a killer, though?
---
Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Spine Chill and Alert
---
therefor 😥
---
GUYS LOOK AT OUR BOX ART WE HAVE **STRANGER THINGS** BUY OUR GAME PLEASE
---
Leatherface: am I a joke to you?
---
Demo is definitely fun to play but freedy is much better as a killer. If u are in high ranks like 1-8, freedy is a better choice but if u like to scare the shit out of people and be loud asf then get demogorgon.
---
"don't touch my tralalala"
---
"Now I don't see so good so I missed. Then they ran away, I ran after em, 'bang!' Tried to shoot em in the back."
---
I think DWM also triggers on a fast locker exit, not sure though
---
Bond and dead hard always. The other two change with the most used being either We’re Gonna Live Forever, We’ll Make it, Self Car, or Alert.
---
Iron will (or kindred), Borrowed time, We’ll make it and Balanced landing.
---
Are the patchnotes out for the update?
---
I was looking at this, and honestly most of this shit is just fixing bugs, like the decisive drop thing wasn’t intended and neither was the facecamping
---
it’s really wrecking my emotions that i’ve only just noticed that.....i can only apologise
---
They do but its barely significant. The true loss killers get from camping or facecamping needs to come from the other 3 survivors, by doing generators and escaping.
---
No, more like the extended event that they confirmed in a tweet which i didnt see until now
---
!unlock
---
It's important to play both sides so you're fluent in both languages. There's a clear difference in let me please get this daily butt dance vs go fuck yourself butt dance XP
---
Yeah they do, its 1 point per sec lost for 16m range of a hooked survivor and 7.5 points per sec lost 8m or closer to a hooked survivor. It kills your rank really quick but doesnt greatly effect BP. You also lose point for not hitting survivors enough, but thats for first hook campers
---
Mirror myres with monitor or ghostface can get some ultra jumpscares in. Although I think we can all agree that nothing spells "your f***ed" like seeing nurse at red ranks
---
Bubba has reasons to get him besides the perks imo. I think he should be the first character new players buy, as he's very easy to play and win with
---
Might just be my experience tho
---
Aww those days
---
Also me as huntress missing every axe
---
Borrowed Time, Deliverance, Babysitter and We’re Gonna Live Forever if I need bloodpoints. 
---
Otherwise I’ll use Fixated, Urban Evasion, Sprint Burst and Vigil, super sneaky build that lets be get away from the killer and recover from exhaustion quickly
---
He is basically Billy with less map pressure. But still strong because this chainsaw can down multiple survivors at once. A good builds.
---
Ruin to slow the game down and let you catch the first survivor before 3 gens pop instantly.
---
Pop goes the Weasel to destroy generator progression.
---
Discordance to find survivors teaming up on generators.
---
Play with your food to catch up to them.
---
The last perk is somewhat difficult to use  and getting them all will take quite a while, but survivors while have a hard time escaping you.
---
Headless Horseman as killer when?! #FeelsStillWaitingMan
---
I was gonna joke and say the answer to solving this is by removing the Leave Match button, but honestly it could help. Obviously, you could still leave by just closing the game, but less people would do it. People would be less willing to DC (unless they’re mad mad) because they would have to start the game up again or just not play it anymore. Then they just GTA it and create servers for toxic players. Ppl DC a lot, they get slapped with toxic prison lol. I do understand they probably couldn’t create toxic servers tho, considering servers fuck up enough as it is
---
Fan made music is never going to be added, it's too legally iffy, even if the person does sign away the rights to it.
---
I checked and you are right, what a shitface, downvoting
---
93 of them have been assigned to cosmetics/"micro"transactions.
---
Dedicated servers indeed will remove lagswitching. But ping itself would stay as well as hits through pallets, windows and miracle hatchets. It's a nature of multiplayer games, the only way to fix it is evolving of internet worldwide. It's just less noticeable in games with much lesser impact of a single hit and much higher hits density (i.e. shooters)
---
If a killer camps someone to death and there aren’t at least 4 generators done already, then you and your team are doing something terribly wrong. Also, why would someone with BBQ camp? The perk was basically made to not only prevent camping, but to reward people for not camping. If someone’s camping, don’t go up to the hook expecting something good to happen, because they will slug you and your team. Again, you need to play Killer more so you can at least partly understand our side, because you’re starting to look like the kind of person the “rule book for killers” joke is about.
---
If you think 4 hex totems are bad then you sir have not faced a spirit with TOTH and prayer beads
---
This. People have to remember that these times are each gen and you need to do 5. 15-25 seconds per gen is 75-100 extra seconds over the game, thats pretty much a 6th gen+ to do.
---
No mither, Object, Fixated, Mettle of Man
---
Thanks buddy
---
Let go of e? Huh?
---
Feedback is welcome
---
Its getting nerfed anyway
---
Thank god
---
Nice!
---
The only way to double pip for killer is to get 4 Iridescent emblems. Which I think is unfair as you don't need 4 Iridescent for survivors
---
So, one more hour then release?
---
Seems like a lot of people like Borrowed Time for those camper killers
---
Myers should still be immune to spine chill at tier 1 and this is from someone who runs spine chill all the time. It fits his theme really well, he’s so silent and stealthy that literally the only way to know he is there is to put eyes on him.
---
Big fan of Fixated.
---
Yeah, I actually run mangled at whatever tier I have it for that reason; it's best effect isnt tied to its rank, so its basically always awesome. Lol
---
Ash as the father drinking beer and "adjusting his hand"
---
Amanda got a huge buff man. And she can stalk now? Sweet, as a pig main this will come in handy. (Sarcastic)
---
It's a shit situation that makes all 5 players feel powerless if the killer doesn't want to ever leave the hook.
---
As a surv, I try to get the killer to leave the hook and once it's clear he isn't ever taking more than 5 steps away from the hook, I leave.
---
As a killer, I'll let myself get "baited" into a chase to give them a chance to unhook.
---
I definitely think killers should let themselves get pulled away from hooks in this situation, because you get very little points from a single guy dying on hook and you usually get as many or more points from chasing another surv, even if you don't down him. Plus, as a killer you usually still get more points than survs have, even if all 4 escape, whereas for survs a big chunk of their bloodpoints depends on them escaping.
---
Well since you are rather friendly and modest about it, i dont mind not giving you crap for advertising
---
Take care
---
now I can have ruin twice
---
While charging shred you recsive killer instinct on survivors near your portals. Put them by gens and occasionally channel abyss to check the gens from afar
---
When the trapper places a trap right in front of the locker.
---
not at all
---
Wait the new update drops today? Aw shiiiii
---
Today
---
Console times are never 100% perfect due to Sony/Microsoft having control, but yes
---
No Mither, Self Care, Second Wind, Object of Obsession
---
God one of the best/worst games I played was when I was rank... 16? I think?
---
3 Claudettes + me. Killer had Ruin 2, and back in those days, Ruin 1 effected 2 survivors and Ruin 2 affected 3. I was the only survivor who wasn't effected by Ruin.
---
That game, I did 4 gens by myself, rescued them all off the hook at least once each, and then got chased by the killer for a good 5ish minutes.
---
And then I got hooked once and died 100-0 whilst they all stayed crouched on the opposite side of the map.
---
I obviously pipped + maxed out Boldness, Objective, and Altruism points, but oh my GOD I've never felt like the game was more 1v1. I'm just glad the killer was as dreadful as my team.
---
It somehow never occurred to me to use my spirit form as a bodyblock for locations I know the survivors will run to
---
That pose makes this so powerful.  Great job!
---
They couldn’t get switch finished in time but didn’t want to hold back Xbox PS4 or PC so here we are. Switch will get the update and the full event time at a later date.
---
This is what bugs me because if i just leave after doing all that work i get bitched at by the killer and my teammates. Even had a stupid streamer get pissy with me for not saving when he was basement camping after i did 3 gens. I dont save people in the end anymore because i get fucked.
---
Why would they add fan music? Was this ever a thing?
---
I liked Object of Obsession but I found I was dying way to quickly. How do you find it useful?
---
David x dwight get this shiz out my face. Nah fr its good artwork. I just dont like david x nea
---
People made fan made specific killer music and due to this, people wanted specific killer music, fan made or not.
---
Dead Hard, Iron Will, Self Care, and Borrowed Time. Depending on how I’m feeling and how my matches are going I occasionally switch Borrowed Time out for Urban Evasion though.
---
I just don’t know if I like that. It essentially renders a decent perk like Object completely useless for 1/4 of the killers in the game. Object already has its downside. The killer can see you. What if there was a survivor add on that automatically hit great skill checks? It would make ruin useless.
---
I play more then enough of both sides I'm fluent if both languages this meme is clearly at the go fuck yourself butt dancers. XP
---
You are correct. We never added each other before. I just added them after they sent the message.
---
I saw those posts and some were really good while others ... but was BHVR ever seriously considering adding that to their game?
---
Itchy nose while working on a gen IT NEVER FAILS!!!
---
inner strength/small game/balanced landing/adrenawin
---
I'm sorry this happened to you.
---
It drops at 4PM no?
---
The icing on the cake would have been if you were running Scratched Mirror. Love when I hear of people being accused of running wallhacks when using that addon.
---
T1 Myers actually can't currently.
---
It nullifies stealth killers, and theyre the ones being changed, imagine there was a perk that didnt let the survivors do gens
---
It doesn't seem to be any problems on your side because there aren't. Sometimes I spend more time being sent back to the main screen then playing the damn game. Especially if I'm trying to play survivor.
---
those people are sub human trash
---

Will this also apply to insidious? Asking for a friend

Sounds interesting, but only if my character actually shouts YEET when I Yeet the survivor
---
PWYF 3 stacks + BloodLust 3 + NOED
---
I mesn it was pretty stupid tho
---
I'm just gonna copy paste my comment from a similar thread: 
---
&gt; To start with, I don't think that old Freddy needed a complete overhaul of his kit. A buff? Hell yes. A complete scrapping of his kit? Hell no. All he needed were some tweaks of how some mechanics related to him worked, some survivor perk nerfs, and maybe a chase mechanic or two added to him, and he'd have been fine. There was a good killer there, the devs just didn't want to take the time to dig him out.
---
With that being said, I like the new Freddy. His teleport game is strong if played right and with the right perks. I'm still learning his snares but I seem to be having trouble with them. Still, I miss the "ping pong" effect old Freddy had and that new Freddy kind of lacks, where if I saw one survivor doing something I didn't want them to be doing, I could just drop the chase/whatever else I was doing and go to them. I can't do that anymore with new Freddy, unless it's with gens specifically.
---
On top of all that, his own kit (especially with his perks) is all over the place now. He used to be a stall/stealth killer, who with his perks was designed to slow the game down for as long as possible. Now Freddy's a: teleport killer, a snare/pallet killer, and a stall killer (at least with his perks). His kit is far too complicated and is all over the place to me. Instead of having one solid concept that he's built around, it's at least three, which is too much to me. He's no longer a real stall killer, but his perks are still built around him being a stall killer. It doesn't make sense to me.
---
Keep In mind I’m rank 19
---
Lithe,alert,spine chill, lightweight
---
good. fuck syringes
---
This was the first time I've seen this happen, think the Spirit was just as surprised as me.
---
I’m happy I was having a good game but it makes me sad when my people are genuinely upset after a game. It’s why I never camp and try to give hatch whenever people let me.
---
Depends on your time zone :D
---
It drops at 11 am ET

he does realise hes playing the loudest and biggest survivor in the game right? lmao
---
Oh. I just assumed he could since all the others could. Fair enough. Still applies to everyone else though.
---
I’ve been running Deliverance, Unbreakable, Decisive Strike and Dead Hard/Head On as of recent times.
---
the funny thing is even without add ons if you have good headphones its not hard to hear survivors. I remember one time a claudette was hiding behind a wall and she was really good at evading my line of sight but I could hear her breathing so I kept following her and she did the same accusatory "hOw cOuLd yOu pOSsIbLy knOw whErE i wAs?"
---
Don’t have any of the good sweaty perks yet. ATM I’m running Sprint Burst (trying to unlock all of Meg’s perks so I figured why not), Urban Evasion, Self-Care, and I’ll use my last slot for new perks but atm I believe I’m using Empathy. I use Urban Evasion to get around the map without having to waste my Sprint Burst. Empathy I use to 1.) know where the killer is 2.) Know where I need to go if I need to be healed or heal 3.) Can go take a hit if they need. I do plan on switching up my build soon, but I just think it has a good versatility. It’s good for staying away from the killer, but it’s also really good for being a team player. It may sound like a kind of immersive build, but my play style is to help out other players if I can. Even if that means having to aggro the killer lol.
---
But Flip-Flop is. Don't worry, I understand that thinking can be difficult.
---
I think it's a matter of taste and playstyle.
---
Ehhhh...
---
tbh i kind of thought it made it a bit funnier
---
How is that plausible deniability? Fans have been asking for them to add character specific chase music long before those posts were made. They are aware we want that.  It's not like they can use what's out there from fans without being sued. 
---
Regardless, that still doesn't answer my question. Was BHVR actually considering using fan made music or not?
---
It’s actually David x Quentin

unpopular opinion: i prefer aftercare over both these perks
---
Survivors on Lery’s when I’m playing killer: safely cranking out four different gens in four separate corners of the map 
---
Me on Lery’s playing survivor: aimlessly running around, screaming internally
---
Literally me.  I leveled her the night before.
---
Oh. Ignore me then. David quentins pretty great too 😅
---
Deliverance, spine chill, bind, and balanced landing
---
Bond adrenaline balanced landing and borrowed time. Boring, but effective
---
Very well done!
---
Upvoting for Ashmore, hahah
---
It'd be like line of sight. So probably the fov of the killer looking at you, within the range of the perk.
---
Ah, yes. Enslaved survivor
---
Except you mentioned base perks and unbreakable isn't a base perk for Ash, and Flip Flop isn't Unbreakable.
---
Way to be a sarcastic cunt when you're wrong, though :)
---
Iron will, Resilience, DS, dead hard or Iron will, sprint burst, DS, BT
---
This is definitely a troll by bhvr to make us think
---
You should check out /r/dbdLFG. It's not horribly popular, but there's some people floating around there. 
---
But hey, I'm Xbox and I'll be on later tonight for the event. My GT is Sekhmettt. :)
---
Jeff is really underrated. Yes Breakdown isn't great but his other two perks are really good
---
I praise the lawd.
---
Eh there are a lot of guys on youtube making chase themes and many of them seem willing to work with or be hired by behaviour so maybe the non license killers
---
Totally fine with the system currently, auric cells are intended as a premium currency for a reason. Making some cosmetics paid only is good for the devs imo.
---

---
she looks to be calling 911 actually lol what makes you think she's doing nothing?
---
Entity blockers have been bugged for a while now, unfortunately.
---
Do you have the option of getting a desktop pc instead, it will last you a lot longer than a laptop.
---
People are way better at healing you in higher ranks, mostly because they want the points, but still.
---
Literally a repost but cropped
---
She's on the phone,  likely calling the police genius.... are you blind?
---
Ruin is on the shrine today, buy it
---
Again, I understand thinking can be hard so I appreciate the opportunity to explain things to you.
---
&gt; Once you get out of potato ranks, people will stop assuming that you're using their base perks.
---
So he's playing Ash. People are assuming that he's using Ash's base perks. Which Flip-Flop is one of. They are then wondering why he isn't using Unbreakable since he's definitely using Flip-Flop.
---
Let me know if you have any further questions!
---
Nah Freddy tops demo for sure
---
34
---
It’s simple if he walks to a hook and don’t hook you just stop wiggiling, I usually don’t give hatch cause that’s a 100% black pip, but sometimes if no one dc I give gate.
---
It's best not to immediately activate your portals. BBQ+Pop Goes is an amazing combo. See someone on a gen, teleport to that generator, and knock it back. You can also hold right click(Channel Abyss) to get killer instinct on any survivors near one of your active portals. It's a good idea to protect them as well as you can.
---
Just admit you fucked up, no shame in it.
---
And again, no need to be a sarcastic cunt when you were the moron in the first place :)
---
Why not both?
---
The “at the moment” could just be a way for the fan base to think the devs are going to do it in the future, just not yet. Even if they aren’t ever going to do it. Which I don’t think they are. Either that or plausible deniability isn’t the right word for this situation. 
---
I’m not BHVR, I don’t know what goes on in their Dev department but I doubt they’re considering fan made music as its legally messy. If they do consider the idea then music made by BHVR will most likely be considered. But right now, it’s all speculation.
---
Bloodlodge OP, but so unfair for killers. I feel bad as there are way too many pallets and jungle gyms
---
The shooter had a trust fund and claimed the trustee in charge of that fund was withholding money he needed for medical bills. The lawyer represented said trustee.
---
Its salty Dwights
---
Well Enduring got nerfed in that case. But it's still easily avoidable. Yeah, you have to slug someone, but that still helps you put pressure unless they brought unbreakable in a swf.
---
Is that a Legion?
---
*takes bite of a sandwich during a skill check*
---
This 100%. I load into Killer matches in less than a minute but it takes 5 mins at most for me to que as a Survivor
---
"At th emoment" is a very polite way of saying no.
---
Yeah, some people are like that, and I understand it. When a DC happens and I want to farm with survivors, sometimes one will get my attention and point at the hook, in which case I will gladly kill them so they can move on with their games.
---
This confused me when I bought solidarity out of the shrine does it mean I heal fast or is this some kind of vampirism?
---
Mobile gets free Auric Cells? Lucky!
---
It’s good to have strong killers I’d just prefer them buffing the lower tier killers. Except nurse she needed a rework, and I do agree that prayer bead spirit is dumb. I just want to seem killers like Bubba get some love from the devs.
---
That's amazing. Can't believe they remembered xD
---
Cool repost.
---
No, I did not fuck up. After 2800 hours, I know who has what base perks. You have my contrite heart though, keep working on your reading comprehension and have a great day!
---
But it can go away many people have gotten over fears. I used to have arachnophobia.
---
The people that complain about people like this are rank 15 or lower.
---
I tend to find the less popular killers more fun to play and honestly I tend to do better with them than I expect. I think some of it is I play more green rank range and the less popular killers are less seen so people don't always know/remember how to counter them.
---
Having to hook someone to mori definitely does not make it useless. The trade off for using a mori is points. It’s an easier game but you get significantly less points. This does need to be reworked though. Make it for fair for both sides. More points and less of an insta win
---
Heh, I might’ve played with you a couple days ago. I was the last survivor and in the chat after the killer said “if you had stopped wiggling I would’ve found you the hatch”
---
Depends on the skill level really
---
Unless you go in a locker, have borrowed time, force a grab, or any of the other things killer can't play around.
---
Fixated is so much fun
---
a lot of people abuse OoO to call out the killer's position when they're playing SWF. i think this will be a healthy change.
---
Yep. Good ol Legion
---
Again, a lot of things legal and a lot of work to get through and other issues with that.
---
It's not an easy thing to say yeah we will hire you or will do a collaboration and work with someone.
---
I don’t think he should but it’s not at all a stretch to say Moris are unfair
---
I remembered some hints to where I am. 
---
\- If you enter the "Upside-Down" area (everything gets blue-ish) you are running towards the big room with the portal crack in the wall. In the other direction you find the stairs.
---
\- Basement is either in the portal room or under one of the stairs to the top level.
---
\- gens are often in the corners on the map, one is upstairs
---
\- Exit gates are on the left and on the right side of the map, near the point where you switch between "Upside-Down" and normal area
---
"The Game" is the map where I still get lost. And I played that much more often. To be precise I just can't find gens on Meat Plant.
---
I doubt they'd do free cosmetics for licensed survivers and killers, but if they did it would probably be some kinda reward for doing a tome, archive, or the battle pass thing, those seem like the only way to get them for "free"
---
Obviously but from what I’ve played as and against Freddy always comes out on top. He’s got anti loop on everything and good pressure. Whereas demos pressure can be destroyed and demo struggles so much on short loops
---
billy boi is best boi
---
I made a decision the last two days to get BBQ on Spirit and Huntress to farm the points to level Hag from 20 to 35 without actually playing Hag.
---
If I had decided to actually play Hag to 35 instead I would be SO PISSED right now.
---
What is this meta? A screen shot of a screen taking a screenshot.
---
I'd actually shit myself if that was the music that played when legion showed up. Like it adds such an intense layer to otherwise boring killers. Imagine a huntress one where her music was a warped version of her humming
---
Please share the clip lol
---
&gt;Then travel to a gen.
---
I'm sure the killer has the same plan
---
&gt;Except it takes zero perks to heal a teammate. Is 8 seconds really worth two perk slots?
---
The day I start letting the math craft portion of this game dictate which perks I run is the day I quit playing.
---
Hell, the OP of this thread runs Head On/ Quick 'n' Quiet for meme-y stun moments and I don't see you giving them shit for it.  
---
To me, being self-sufficient in this game without actually costing my team any time is more than worth it. And for every other person I heal it's like a little bonus. 
---
Does it mean I'll occasionally not have a 3-4 minute game of bust the gens and leave ASAP? Sure, but I'm okay with that. Not everyone enjoys playing like Marth's depip squad.
---
Lol
---
So theres Ruin and a Counter to Ruin which is stake out. I see you bhvr. I see you ;)
---
Boonbandit I'm a baby
---
Get wood pallets around the house and chase her
---
she probably has ptsd from facing too much ghostfaces after he came out
---
Just lunge, don't grab. Borrowed Time isn't decisive. I can't argue locker.
---
Now I don't expect anyone to read the massive document, so here's a TL;DR:
---
         The Tomb is the focus, being the killer. He was a simple Chineseman in life who had obtained riches in some way. 
---
         He wanted to use that money to explore, and in preparing that, had found love. Once he and his wife finally reached the mountains of Mount Everest to search for gold, they found nothing. Outraged, his wife pushed him off the edge, sending him to his death.
---
           Around a year later, she was found horrifically dead, with suggestions of hypothermia.
---
           The Tomb as a Blizzard inside his terror radius, impeding survivor's ability to see exactly where he is.
---
           The Tomb's ability allows him to freeze a up to 2 generators or hooked survivors, created "iced over areas." Inside these areas, survivors slowly build up a condition called 'Snap Freeze.' The Tomb also applies this with his basic attack.
---
           Snap Freeze's condition will slowly get worse, peaking at around 30 seconds. They will act like they're inside a Trapper beartrap for 10 seconds, and can attempt to set themselves free at a low chance of success. Survivors without Frostbite can do the same to that survivor at a massively increase chance of success.
---
His perks Terrifying Gaze, Hex: Hypothermia, and Chilling Grasp all allow him to catch survivors, and never let them go.
---
Chilling Grasp - Your grasp is ice cold. Survivors that successfully wiggle off your shoulders have 4%/10%/18% reduced movement speed for 2 seconds.
---
Terrifying Gaze - Your presence brings fear to those who observe you. Activates when you look in the direction of a survivor inside your terror radius/x1.1/x1.2.
---
Survivors who look at you while active will, over the course of 4/3/2 seconds start to hear your heartbeat in increasing intensity until they scream at the end of that time. The timer is reset when the survivor looks away for 5 seconds.
---
Hex: Hypothermia - 
---
The Entity allows you to inflict severe cold against survivors; enough to freeze the very moisture on their skin.
---
Survivors must pass one slightly/moderately/considerably difficult skill check when performing the healing action on another dying survivor that will complete 30%/40%/45% of their healing bar. If they fail, the bar will be completely reset and the healing survivor must attempt that skill check again.
---
Dying survivors heal themselves 40%/50%/50% slower.
---
Survivors put into the dying state take 30%/45%/50% longer to bleed out.
---
The map related to The Tomb is known as Abandoned Fishing Town, the remote town the Chineseman is originally from. This map is divided into 4 main sections.
---
The West section is a general straight line with a single distant generator on a dock.
---
The North section is the smallest, containing up to to 2 gwnerators and simple looping structures.
---
The East Section contains 2 single story buildings with garunteed vaults.
---
The South section is a randomized mess of structures with whatever hasn't spawned in spawning here.
---
Our survivor is a Turk from the great Ottoman
---
because the devs are at work?
---
Don’t worry I’ll play it for you
---
The hatch isn't perfect, but it's better than no hatch. EGC is killer favored in many scenarios. Ideally, they come up with something that is equally balanced, but for now, if you want the 4k so badly, find the hatch before killing the 3rd survivor or slug the 3rd survivor and find the 4th.
---
Same I really like wraith and the best way to secure a hit is to bodyblock e.g I spawned in and checked on my totem there was a David on it so I bodyblocked him... I didn't even get a chance to uncloak before he dc'd after the game I asked him what he left he replyed with "reported for holding hostage"
---
the killers i mainly play are myers, hillbilly and demogorgen
---
It probably should but the puddle grab thing that’s on the discussion rn just seems disjointed in design. Like what would happen if he’s already carrying someone or is stunned?
---
Well luckily I’m from Europe and the time of the update is 4 PM here. Gaming time right after work 😊
---
That dude is hardcore, I couldn't be in a situation like that since I'd try to serpentine away as if its a video game and just die instantly
---
Needs to cause exhaustion if it's going to be like this.
---
Bruh, the game ain’t going nowhere, people got bills to pay
---
So it can download while you’re at school/work
---
I try out different killers from time to time just to mix it up a bit or get a daily, and I swear almost EVERY TIME I get a swf that is toxic. This absolutely triggers me and causes me to go all "no more mr nice guy" and come armed to the teeth next game. The next game is always a bunch of Casual players and I feel bad:/ There should be  rematch option lol.
---
That jigsaw map
---
OmG I JuSt gOt hAg tO lEvEl 35, ExCuSe mE wHaT tHe FuCk
---
I like Hawkins because it’s refreshing and I never get it. I don’t think it’s necessarily a good or bad map. My favorite map would probably have to be Coldwind tho. Killers rarely check the corn after kicking gens, and they get lost really easily if you just run through the corn kinda randomly.
---
If you took a screenshot why didn’t you just post that
---
Oh shit its A Sheriff Jake
---
cute, both chads against me! I love it! Almost forgot about you appropriatedig, still angry because you couldn't make any decent argument in the past? that's sad
---
Nothing more satisfying than when they do that and run in the opposite direction of the hatch.
---
Not sure how to from xbox directly if theres a way
---
her dropping a pallet would be like “this is too heavy.. can you help me? I can’t do it myself :(“ and id feel bad and end up dropping a wood pallet on myself for her satisfaction.
---
You can take it from Xbox.com or the Xbox app
---
alright chad, maybe you should really not even bother when you are so laughable. Especially when you have to delete a comment which proves how you can't have a real discussion
---
Alert. Lithe. Technician.
---
Ooo ok. Learned something new. Thanks
---
Just be happy the update Is coming out just in time for halloween? My gosh. Relax and just enjoy it later today.
---
there are 3 positions they usually have. top left top bottom and between the two. There was a fourth one but was too difficult so they removed it
---
as far as I know i mean
---
Fixated is dummy useful
---
Oh no
---
Would be nice if BHVR went back to making add-ons that actually give new ways to play as the Killer.  This is why Michael Myers and Hag are two of my favs regarding add-ons.  I've said this before on reddit &amp; the forums, but stuff like Scratch Mirror Myers, Tombstone Myers, Infinite T3, Body Blocking Hag, Silent Hag and the manual Teleport Hag builds add a nuance to the Killers. It also presents more &amp; different ways to play as em that's not solely dependant on Perks.
---
Found him. Can't believe I did without someone pointing it out lol
---
I play on console too and its very easy to hit them anyway. Just set my skillcheck action to L1 and I have no problems
---
It is a typo.
---
https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1189553112048132096
---
&gt;Yep. Good ol Legion
---
Well, this is an easy save then. Legion is one of the worse characters to defend unhooks. Dying because players are sitting at the exit gates instead of trying to do something against ridiculously weak killers is worse than the killer itself.
---
Because its during the same workday as the devs lmao?
---
Billy: Your weak.
---
Bubba: Im you.
---
Glad to see her enjoying a Halloween treat
---
So you're saying there's a chance
---
Clearly you don't since you seem to believe that Ash has Flip-Flop as a base perk, which he doesn't, but you're just too proud to admit it, and instead are lashing out at me and try to make yourself seem smart.
---
It's pretty sad tbh :/
---
Luckily, it was a typo.
---
Finally I can get Ruin
---
Logically, there’s a very VERY small chance.
---
I have a rope and a stool ready if this is true
---
Fixated means you always move faster then urban, but your more visible since your not crouched. Up to you, personally i hate crouching with a passion so i run fixated.
---
It’s only a valid tactic for as long as they’re alive. It’s not abuse. It’s a game mechanic with heavy downsides.
---
Good. It's a bs mechanic.
---
Mose ppl in the uk are on autumn half term yeet
---
I have a desktop pc, but I am rarely at home due to my school... That why I am looking for a laptop
---
Leatherface. He's just so big and imposing, and the chainsaw rattles me. I feel like I can outthink the other killers, but he's just a giant manchild with a chainsaw and it throws me off my game
---
ive seen this around before
---
There is a perk that is effectively doing that. Ruin. You can work through it but the average ruin game is significantly slower. Imagine there was a passive ability survivors had that nullified ruin

To be honest, I do this less and less often for Survivors.... So many I go up against are rude lil shits.  I used to do it way more often when we'd get 3 Survivors games starting out, or early DCs but I jus go easier on em and intend to kill em anyway.
---
It would be funny
---
Thank the entity.
---
Not when you get unlucky and have to search all 4 boxes with the timer on.
---
Oh and then the pig decides to chase you
---
yeah that's true but the excuse "they delay to fix bugs" its very silly. The devs have showed, every time, they can't release a patch without a lot of bugs. Not minor ones, big ones too, that's why I found hilarious seeing people defending a delay for "fixing bugs and glitch" when they fk up pretty often
---
just look up recently with wake up bug in the live server or hag/huntress and sounds problems. It happens every patch. The part "would've have you liked to not even start the game at all?" its dumb, it never happened as far as I know and it would get hotfixed very fast. This, wasn't the case /:
---
cant believe i got caught snoozing by this
---
whats changing about it? i cant find any patch notes, Sorry if silly question mate
---
Thank you! :)
---
Wow.. I thought I wasn’t the only one
---
**ONE HOUR!**
---
Is this camping?
---
Okay, so syringes and styptic agents are actual garbage now, very cool thank you BHVR glad to have more shit to avoid in bloodwebs
---
Is hag not a free character anymore?
---
Patch will drop in 20 minutes, it will have everything written
---
I did this to a Meg one time...she stopped struggling when she knew the hatch was close by and I walked her over there. I was about to drop her before I remembered she ds'd and teabagged me earlier in the match. I looked at the hatch, then the hook, then the hatch, then the hook and hooked her. She immediately dc'd lmao.
---
Because undetectable is new , like how deep wounds took over borrowed time's resilience after being hit. t1 Myers was always undetectable it even says in his power it trumps detection perks. They're just updating it to  have it as a visible status effect .
---
okay kid. If being a millennial is being a boomer, maybe you should check that this game isn't appropriate for you. its pegi 18, just a reminder
---
I *love* when people can't just be nice and say "here's the link" without becoming condescending assholes about it, really adds to the link I'm about to click
---
Yes Yes Yes! Happens so much now HAHA
---
Found the survivor main. A core inbuilt mechanic being hard countered by a single perk does not a balanced perk make. Yes, even as a killer main, I will look warily in the direction of Ruin.
---
Exactly sometimes I’ll switch deliverance for comeradie or babysitter
---
Precious XD
---
Can't wait for all the bugs.
---
I prefer giving tips to giving insults
---
I would love to have the boogie man as a killer.
---
I’ve done that with lithe and sprint burst during my virgin days.
---
Only when I am the one opening the gate lol
---
Im kinda willing to bet you run Ruin and BBQ
---
The lab has landmarks, namely what you stated: on one side the portal and the upside down effect, on the other side the stairs. You can use that to know where you are and where you are going, regardless of where you are.
---
The Game is just the same shit everywhere and it has no landmarks besides the washroom (or bathroom depending on where you live :D) and the doors, which you can't see everywhere.
---
The difference here is counterplay. If you hit greats ruin does nothing, if you break the totem there goes a perk, what do you do as ghostface when some fucker follows you around breaking your stealth always knowing exactly where you are?
---
15-ish minutes from now!
---
He just doesn’t get the option
---
Think of how hag works or demogorgon. You have to press a button to even use it. This is why it’s his “power”.
---
3 weeks of great Killer Perks, I know there's contention whether Spirit Fury is 'good' and 'healthy'. But it's definitely 'strong'.
---
Spirit Fury &gt; Pop Goes &gt; Ruin
---
That's why, even if the killer wasn't good but clearly new, I still say "you did great!"
---
Med-kits and add-ons
---
   &gt;Styptic Agent: To allow more counterplay we've reduced the time that Endurance will be active from 15 seconds to 8 seconds for the Styptic Agent specifically. Borrowed Time's Endurance timing has not changed.
---
    
---
&gt;Anti-Hemorrhagic Syringe: The Heal Over time effect now takes 16 seconds to heal a health state. We've increased the heal over time effect to 16 seconds (up from 8) for the release. As this is an effect that passively heals you while you can do other actions and it can be affected by items/ add-ons and perks we felt that having a timing similar to the regular health state heal made more sense than the 8 seconds that we put on the PTB.
---
Well fuck, there goes the chances of anyone using these lmao.
---
Same here, I love the atmosphere.
---
open a chest for 10 seconds for a 1 time medkit gain for 1 free heal vs permanent slower healing and item healing efficiency
---
Im not saying self care is good anymore but its miles better then  pharmacy still lmao. This requires you to, assuming injured before searching the chest, find the chest, search it without getting caught, then heal yourself. Where u could of just healed yourself by the time you get the medkit with sc
---
For bubba absolutely I actually like the new agent probobly unpopular opinion
---
I thought the changes they had in the PTB were great. I’m referring to the newly doubled nerfs. Did you read the patch notes?
---
Yeah it is weird. The thing is, only survivor rituals seem to be replaced. Strange 🤔
---
Lol hag is incredible. If the survivor team as ONE single potato player, you are going to wreck with her because those players are they kind to keep running around the map, sabotaging themselves and their team even when they know they are playing against a hag because they cant bother to crouch or go slowly because they didnt equip Urban.
---
I think the main reason back then was the prevalence of legion. It was amazing on him back then but not worth using on anyone else, plus Legion had a lot of problems back then.
---
Now
---
Lol, the lady on the payphone who looks like she ends her call to call the police. She is the survivor who stops doing totems to start on a gen when the killer is in chase.
---
WHAT
---
RIGHT NOW
---
Yes, is that not what it was previously? What is the difference?

HOLY SHITTT

That's a neckbeard nest if I've ever seen one.

I wish they did something about forever freddy, his slowdown being boring was one of the reasons for the rework.

theyre not horrible for self healing or anything. idk i think instaheals were definitely not right for the game. we just gotta give it time and see. i think puppers saved like a million instaheals to try them out a bunch
---
You make a *very* good point.
---
I keep hitting "Check for update" on PS4 and nothing :(
---
Also is it just me or are there almost no survivor rituals at all?
---
Syringe heals passively over 16 seconds instead of 8, styptic gives endurance effect for 8 seconds instead of 15.

NGL, I actually laughed out loud at this. Whoever has been running the BHVR twitter for the last 24 hours has been killing it.

Do we suspect that the changes to the engine will help the performance issues, memory leaks, etc.?

Give it about 10 minutes it usually is delayed for some reason on consoles

Waiting for the wave of “I CANT DOWNLOAD THE UPDATE FIX YOUR GARBAGE BHVR” posts when everyone tries to download it at once.
---
Awesome work! Keep practicing! Billy is a great killer to main :)
---
So, honest question.
---
I've been back a couple of weeks now and have noticed that as the third survivor downed there tends to be a lot of slugging.
---
I always assume the killer is being a prick and either run Unbreakable or crawl to the corner of the map and bleed out to annoy the killer, but several say they were planning to give me the hatch.
---
They're bullshitting me, right? Is that a thing now?  Giving the hatch as some kind of rule?
---
Then they should totally hire me. I have a thick skin and will work for Auric Cells :P
---
Ahh. Okay thank you!! :)
---
I had this [crow](https://i.imgur.com/UCy9FV5.png) one time.

Um chill lol i wanted to help but the rest of them team wouldnt come help. I always try and save off hooks. Im prob not as good as you but calm down lol and yes the screenshot was for the face camp not me watching
---
6GB for anyone who wants to know.
---
If only we could put them in the files ourselves like perk and killer icons
---
Like I said, that sounds fine and you can use add-ons to decrease the time.
---
Sorry you can't cheese your way out of chases anymore and instantly take away a killer's down. I know you want EZ mode
---
Anti hem styringe is basically the old purple, heal someone/yourself down to 1 charge remaining then pop the heal when your injured and do a gen now instead
---
Styptic agent seemed balanced at 15 seconds tbh 8 seems really short. Im pretty sure its not even possible to basement dive with it anymore considering the time to get to the hooked person and unhook them.
---
It's funny because at that point it wouldn't even be BHVR... it would be the steam servers lmao.
---
You realize you linked a forum with a guy whining who literally complains that “they made DS stop being consumed when you dropped them before the stun took effect” and a ton of other exploits? Literally the first thing he listed as a nerf was not being able to keep survivors from being unhooked by bodyblocking the unhook spot.
---
I want 2 vs 8
---
It doesn’t take 10 seconds to open a chest with Pharmacy since it makes 80% faster. If you’re trying to be optimal in game, then it is way better than to use self-care, wasting everyone’s time and being a burden to your mates. I stopped counting the number of time the killer got a 4K due to people self-caring when we needed them the most.
---
*cries in console*
---
Thank you!! Tbh, the only reason I picked him was because he had a couple of daily challenges available lol

If you want more advice on it post it a few times for a bit of people to see it

Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

ppl said it hut xbox now come on ps4 hurry up

Hey man! Congrats!! Hope you can improve your game more and more. You will face some challenges and some "obnoxious" people but don't give up and keep playing!!
---
It’s not a rule, most do it to be nice or to avoid a double pip so they don’t rank up so fast, I usually do it just cause it makes someone happy and that’s enough for me. But I’ve definitely seen people who just slug, but not usually if you’re the last person.

And with love :(

---
Oh shit i had no idea, nevermind then.
---
Yeah, I've noticed that too. I hate doing killer rituals because it takes me close to an hour to get a match only for but to get canceled or for me to get trash talked when I let everyone go after completing it.
---
I've been back three weeks, only complained in post game chat once, because there was a clear sandbagger in one of my matches last night, and in the same match, I got bugged and couldn't run and the killer downed me anyway.
---
Those both seem complaint-worthy, but as a prestige 3 Ace with at least 50 of every item, it really doesn't matter if I win my match or not. I lose nothing now.
---
you just pointed out the Joke lol
---
xbox hit live ps4 not yet sadly
---
Lol. I LOVE when people can't just be non-lazy fucks and take 10 seconds to look up a link and instead take 10 seconds to ASK for the same link.
---
Yeah still waiting on ps4
---
It’s out on Xbox
---
just wanna second the recommendations here. I’m new to the game too, and was an old fan of otz’s from his dark souls days. got into his dbd content now that I finally had an excuse, and it’s super helpful. not only is he a wonderfully wholesome and non-toxic guy, but his running commentary as killer is *so* helpful (for my survivor and killer gameplay), *and* on top of *that* he does his absolute best to answer questions in chat when he streams. can’t recommend him enough.
---
I‘ve stumbled across a couple ohtofu vids too (his name gets thrown around a lot), and his stuff has been the most helpful to me for learning advanced-ish survivor stuff like looping and map knowledge/gamesense stuff which can be really hard to teach.
---
there will be a riot if it does not come out soon lol
---
boooo
---
Thanks so much, and will do!!
---
Can confirm still waiting on ps4
---
Yeah I play on switch so lobby’s only take about 10 minutes but that’s still 10 minutes I could be playing survivor you know? Also I really need the BP I prestige’s without knowing what it did and I had a ton of BPS and stuff like that wish I would’ve saved up beforehand 😖
---
*cries in PS4*
---
''Due to unforseen circumstances the PS4 release has been delayed..."
---
I'd feel for not only us, but BHVR.
---
Jeez finally
---
I want to see all the top tier killers get nerfed. Spirit, Nurse, and Billy, and see all the off meta killers get buffed. Wraith, Leatherface, Legion. I want killer selection to be based on what the most interesting power is, 1 of 3 obvious choices blows.
---
WHY PS4 UPDATE NOT LIVE YET
---
Hag is actually good and worth leveling, leatherface is the worst killer in the game, and his important perks should be on waaaay more often.
---
Ok but still am I wrong for thinking the way I do
---
YEAH THAT REALLY SUCKS IM SORRY
---
Bruh I never said they were Kate. I’m literally just telling you what the page said lol. It’s not that unlikely for BHVR to make up a random survivor for a licensed killer.
---
I do too. It really wouldn't be fair if you didn't
---
I think sometimes people just have a hard time with certain killers.  I always get owned by Hillbilly for some reason
---
Well, time for me to get that for Ghost Face

Don't read too much into that - that's just quebecois to english.  "At this moment, it has not been considered"

I got the same message. Cancel and delete then try to update it again. It worked for me and is now updating

It’s for the Ice Cream Theme ;) I’ve gotten Mori’d a lot since I changed it, lol

Ima look for those

It's ok, you've got a friend in me!

Yes
---
I HATE THAT IF I BLOW OUT THE SURVIVORS I AM WAY LESS LIKELY TO PIP UP. THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY TO PUNISH CAMPING AND TUNNELING THAN PUNISHING ME WHEN THE SURVIVORS JUST PLAY STUPID.
---
IT'S LIKE HOW YOU GET PUNISHED AS SURVIVOR IF THE KILLER SUCKS AND NEVER FINDS YOU. NO, STOP PUNISHING PLAYERS WHEN THEIR OPPONENT DOES SOMETHING STUPID.
---
GOOD TO HEAR, MINES ALMOST FINISHED DOWNLOADING
---
FUCKING 12 gb on ps4
---
The legality of it isn't that simple. How do you pay the creator? Do they retain the rights? Can they take their music back, or will they be entitled to royalties? What if it was created using pirated software? How long do the rights last for? 
---
It's the same reason why developers can almost never use fan created concepts in their games - it's just far too messy with creative rights. 
---
Unless you want another Friday the 13th on oht hands.
---
God,bullet 2 actually hit him
---
Well it's bonkers! Like shit, meme is top tier but its over shadowed by fat guy with a gun.
---
I'm pretty sure you can
---
Yeah, I almost made a comment to that effect, but then I thought about it a bit and it's essentially a better Second Wind that pops up in your bloodweb and I decided to just leave it alone. What are totems? 14 seconds? I think that would be a good change. The 2 seconds would be noticeable, in my opinion, and running a syringe with Inner Strength and popping the syringe right before beginning a totem cleanse could be a dope healing play
---
Fair enough, public opinion isn’t bright when it comes to my idea anyway (as the rest of the comments  have show)
---
You do have to admit that the devs are rather good at preventing Killer perks from being too strong or over powered. Normally power creep shows its head and things go to hell.
---
If only they was as good with Survivor perks. MoM was bullshit and DS once was for some time, still is a bit much in opinion. But even there I have to say that the devs are attempting.
---
Boner
---
yeah that 7 year old must have ptsd from playing against ghost face
---
Yes you can
---
Pretty sure you can! The offerings don't expire and they've been updated with the new text so I'm sure you can use any leftovers you had from last year!
---
Which one to get first, BBQ or Haunted Grounds?
---
Keep trying to redownload, it will work.

as a bloody trapper you should know the entire song off by heart

Saving for later because I’m at school using phone and WiFi is agony

Yea sometimes there cunts i was hooked and had adrenaline and was right next to the gate and the meg didnt save she just walked right out

IIRC it doesn't affect spine chill. It ONLY affects aura-reading perks, so Spine Chill is fine.

Had to restart PS4 9 times

Was it the result of a mistake? I thought they suffered a power outage and lost progress?
---
But he’s actually a girl :0
---
Try and get good without ruin
---
Ruin isn’t a stranger to the shrine and honestly past rank 10, item already in every build. It honestly doesn’t see explosive levels of use outside of brand new/yellow ranks.
---
i just dont think its fair while we get free auric cells so easily while PC and other platfroms have to buy it. 10 auric cells per prestige would be a nice reward since prestiging is kind of useless
---
But it is...... and do you believe everything Wikipedia says? 
---
Why would they make a random survivor who hasn’t been in any of leatherfaces movies since they took Leatherface from the movie unlike what they did with Ghostface. 
---
I’m not sure you understand what I’m saying or if you can even process the reality of what I’m saying. 
---
They’ve also never made a random survivor to go with a full on licensed character. 
---
They could have for Ghostface since the mask is licensed but the person is there creation.
---
Most of the time they’re the ones that fuck me over
---
Dem toes tho
---
Try deleting something. I keep getting errors when the drive is nearly full
---
O ok. Hard to help save if rest of team doesnt come help
---
WHEN I LAUNCH THE GAME ON XBOX ONE, IT FREEZES ON THE TITLE SCREEN AND CRASHES WTF
---
Right and the boxes are all right next to each other i forgot! 
---
Oh what's this? You have to run around the entire map to check them all? Well gee, a minute of running around plus a minute of opening boxes doesn't leave much room for anything else! 
---
If you combine bad luck with a well timed ~30 second chase the hat can kill you. Obviously I dont think they're OP at all, but if we as you said significantly reduce the timer then unless you got it in your first 2 searches you would be dead every time if the trap was active.
---
I just don't like her play style personally, and Leatherface isn't an option on the Switch version yet.

Either way. It's nice for the Switch version, but you know...I just don't wait forever to play any killer to get the points to put into Hag because you have to sacrifice a baby goat to get lobbies as killer.
---
BBQ 100%. +100% bloodpoints if you hook every survivor AND it's one of if not the best tracking perk in the game.
---
If there is I expect tons of unforeskin sir cum stances jokes in this subbredit
---
That always happens If he steps in a trap
---
I thought the same thing but I still have 200GB left. A simple restart and a few tries fixed the issue.
---
It could simply be because a lot of people are trying to download I imagine.
---
&gt; They’re also not breaking any laws here.
---
Are you a lawyer by any chance?
---
Will do, stops me from having to grind Leatherface for a while
---
They’re emotes 3Head
---
ARGH!
---
Nintendo Switch still has the old shrine with Ruin. I was hoping this would be my chance to get BBQ on the Switch. Guess you have to have the 3.3.1 update to see the new shrine X_X
---
I don't think any killer addon should instadown. I think the honing stone is fine but as far as Iridescent Heads and the Pinky Finger, no.
---
Interesting. I played a few games against Myers with the Alert perk and it's affect would trigger but I couldn't see his aura in tier 1.
---
How are the 3 unhooked survivors feeling powerless? They have all the agency. You walk out the exit, or you attempt a save. If they stand away from the hook teabagging and flashlight clicking then whine that the killer camped, they're putting the blame in the wrong place.
---
It worked for me but sadly this is a 12.7G update apparently so RIP ever getting to play
---
They're not actually called insta heals in game.. that's just kind of a community thing. So I'm not sure what you're trying to prove lol.
---
is
---
how you say
---
joke
---
Low effort joke*
---
FTFY
---
Before anything I say right now, I'm a killer main
---
My take on this:
---
Rework ebony moris, make it have a higher requirement than just hook once and kill (even though mori animations can look cool).
---
My take on survivors:
---
SWF needs work, I totally get the fact that you want to have fun with friends and that's cool, but most of the time they can get really sweaty to go against.
---
I was going to agree with OP a tiny bit but his response to you shows how valuable his opinion on Spirit is XD
---
That is 100% true. Playing with Rando’s is hard trying to coordinate that. SWF is much easier.
---
yes
---
same just completed the first gen challenge now it not clickable
---
did you try restarting the game
---
At least bbq will double you BP to get hag leveled faster lol
---
Let's hope the Entity didn't add working air vents
---
I have the same issue...I just REALLY wanted to start playing. Guess I'm waiting.
---
Doesn’t show up as emotes. Just words
---
Buy BBQ
---
Well it was good while it lasted
---
Here's my secret to counter legion:
---
1) T-pose
---
2) maintain stance and strong eye contact until subject legion leaves area
---
Same here
---
Thanks. That’s a big one ;)
---
Unfortunately it wasn't intentionally hilarious
---
hasnt this been a thing for ages? and they're just now fixing it? bravo bhvr
---
Oh fuck I thought that was intended
---
I be on solo. Its been face camping for 2 days now lol i cant do anything saving alone
---
Did You let the update finish or did you just launch the game when it said "ready to start"?
---
Duhhhhh because they’re better ttv emotes. Jesus Christ
---
Is it supposed to look platickey? Or is designed that way?
---
it takes a bit over 100mins though
---
Thank God I bought Dance With Me before this
---
I dont have the right perks yet
---
If you say so lol
---
Its ok if you have skillcheck button on the mouse
---
same here can't access at all after multiple restarts
---
same here, hope for some clarification soon from the devs
---
Same thing happened to me. I already have 10 serums available.
---
where did ruin go?
---
Could just remove hooks too?
---
Same here, cannot access at all
---
I assume he's high as balls 24/7
---
also, it's intelligible to have it since avoiding means their nothing intelligent for you to say and have no supporting evidence to help with your theory. But you made your choice :)
---
I FUCKING LOVE WHEN HUNTRESS ACTIVATES HATCHET LOCK ON MODE
---
lol same issue here. The button is greyed out...
---
I think they're after borking it up. I was tier 9 before even playing or buying the pass.
---
It’s not a debate it’s a GC extension for Twitch lmao
---
\*coughs in "I use Haunted Ground but no other Hexs"\*
---
Joke aside I was wondering who the heck was popping those when I don't have Ruin XD
---
As a survivor I always make sure there's a Ruin before popping a Lit Totem
---
Gone, reduced to atoms.
---
Yurr 10/10
---
Glad I got ruin before it changed, I was confused on why it changed tho
---
Mad they're taking your ability to play oracle for your team huh, deal with it.
---
Not every bullet but most
---
I'm sure he let the update play out. I did, bought the pass with the archives working, and now they're not working.
---
Ah just wait for t-bagging gen rushing pink haired flashlight and insta heal neas
---
Thank God I got home 1 hour early today
---
Because you act like she is. To which she’s not so she would be put into a licensed killers dlc.
---
*Seventeen shots*
---
one assist
---
I'm guessing Spine Chill will still work on her, though
---
Finally a reason to crawl under Myers in the dying state :)
---
And I never debated it, man. I just don’t care lol.
---
yup, already broken.
---
Pop, Ruin, and now BBQ? A killer main's dream come true
---
https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1189568236720930817
---
Seems to be unavailable for a bit
---
:(
---
thank god i managed to get ruin before the shrine got updated
---
Wow you still hammering about a mistake I did? You're so sad if you still don't even understand why I did that mistake when I explained it 3 times
---
They just announced on Twitter that they have a progression issue and the feature won’t be available. Are you fucking kidding me?
---
If you say so
---
Better yet, fast BP and deranking, which is kind of what you do when you play legion anyway :P
---
welp
---
I like the bloody idle crows are there clearly telling the killer where you are and they still managed to blunder into their own trap. They had one job haha.
---
Yea kept scrolling and saw this is a common issue. That was just my first guess had this been an isolated incident
---
Controls are re-bindable.
---
I found it hilarious, it almost never happens during games I play, and this guy hit many of his own through the game.
---
Are you fucking kidding me?? COME ON BHVR
---
bruh another power outage
---
Anddddd they should have waited another day
---
Exactly! Lol
---
[[THIS SHIT](https://imgur.com/a/FjQeqQX)](/intensifies)  
---
WHY AM I LOSING RANKING FOR THEM RAGE QUITTING?
---
People were getting free levels. I would like to think they will honor those who got free levels though and just fix the issue.
---
I think we did a pretty good *job* so far.
---
Everyone tends to forget about Sally. She was the final girl of the first Texas Chainsaw. 
---
Really unfortunate that she doesn’t get noticed because she’s actually a good character :/
---
OMG.. it is tho.. are you okay dude? You should Google things before comment on anything
---
someone posted it before you https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dp8hxq/due_to_a_progression_issue_with_the_archives_the/
---
Thicc Callous
---
Unforeseen circumstances.
---
On the bright side, we got the Halloween event before Halloween. The Archives aren't tied to the season at all, so as much as I was looking forward to them, I'm not **too** beat up over it.
---
(I'm still a little bummed though.)
---
Pretty good job so far!
---
So they delayed the update a week, to make Archives unavailable? The reason why they delayed the update was so there wouldn’t be any issues.
---
Oh come onnnnn
---
Embarrassing at this stage
---
https://i.imgur.com/OHSiRxF.jpg
---
Absolutely no one saw this coming. /s
---
Unless you've been injured and\\or the Spirit is running Stridor
---
I agree. Just *wooooooooooooow.*  I just did the first challenge too.
---
WHY RUIN CHANGED WITH BBQ
---
Thing is you don’t go to him but he goes to you. Don’t bother with the apple, he prolly shocked his apple gear away
---
&gt;"Why don't you give me some of that" \[The eyes of the mask glow as she starts to hum her huntress lullaby are you hiding in this red locker?" \[Opens locker to find granny\]  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;"Why don't you gimme... some of that Sugar Crisp, Sugar Crisp..."
---
"Sugar Bear's not gonna sacrifice me this today. I'm gonna hide in my safe red locker." \[Dwight jumps into locker\]  
---
\[The huntress  appears, wearing the broken remains of a sugar bear mascot head, the rabbit ears poking through the top, and part of the head shows her face, clearly her rabbit mask had been partly destroyed underneath.\]
---
"Hello Dwight, Did you lock yourself in this red locker? \[The locker doors fling open, the crack of the doors echo, Dwight stares at the Huntress in terror.\]
---
"Why don't you give me some of that" \[The eyes of the mask glow as she starts to hum her huntress lullaby\] "Sugar Crisp.... Sugar Crisp...\]
---
Who else got free levels as a result? I was tier 9 before even purchasing the pass.
---
weird did not happen to me but so not worry thre devs fucked up and the archive does not work anyway lol
---
If you don't have the archives you can't get the serum to get the Blight cosmetics. Without the Archives the event is useless save for some bloodpoints.
---
Pretty good job so far.. again
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
---
To all the people who said not to get mad at BHVR because they want to release it perfectly without bugs. Here you go. This is why people get annoyed. Everyone knew it would come out with bugs either way.
---
What do you mean? The only way to unlock the skins is via the free track of the rift
---
Thank you so much, but, how am I gonna get new currency to unlock cosmetics? I think it was only available via archives
---
Nah this isn't an issue but the buff Legion got so their power has actual threat
---
Damn you really gotta act this way? There’s really nothing wrong with the hatch. It does sound like your a “no skill killer” and a whiny little bitch. Quit crying
---
Of course.  What happened to those fixes you delayed this for?  Uhhhh.....yeah. 
---
This a colossal clusterfuck of just....amazing proportions.
---
the sub: “RELEASE IT NOW EVEN WITH BUGS WE DONT CARE”
---
also the sub: “wow. They really should have waited”
---
What is hilarious once you get past the crazy. Is when the guy runs out of ammo. He just seems to be like, "welp I tried.." time to go home.
---
“Way to fuck it up and fucking it up”
---
“Fucking fuckers” 
---
I edited it for all the people who aren’t afraid to curse.
---
they have actually, we just dont know when
---
Well we have reasons to talk of they in that form
---
THAT'S NICE, STILL SHIT GAME DESIGN.
---
Something currently broken
---
2 good killer perks.
---
Hahahahaha
---
yeah i didnt realize after the 20th post about it, thanks
---
....
---
Well that was lucky. I literally just bought ruin. I wasn’t going to because I don’t player killer that much, but damn.
---
Getting blood points is going to be hella easy at low rank killer now.
---
And haunted grounds.
---
He can still be annoyed lol
---
The shrine is different now after update
---
I don’t know what else people expected honestly. Did you really expect them to release a bug free event? The fact is that the devs weren’t ready for a Halloween event, in perhaps the most popular horror multiplayer game out there right now. Their priorities were stuck elsewhere. Unfortunate and inexcusable, but I am not surprised at this point and neither should you
---
It does
---
There's a reason they needed the patch for the event, yet they're playing it off on Twitter like it's ok and the event is still available, which is technically true but misleading.
---
I know right? Jesus this was posted like a week ago.
---
Thus devs ass-kisser pretends that the community is responsible for that. LMAO
---
FUCKING ARCHIVES PIECE OF GREYED OUT SHIT. PRETTY FUCKING GOOD JOB SO FAR FUCK
---
:)
---
I mean... seriously
---
Cool concept but I think the guns should maybe just mark survivor
---
Where did they state it ?
---
I made a Jack skellington post like 2 days ago
---
Bing bong boi...OG stealth killer...I like that
---
I got Ruin from yesterday
---
I just want to cry at this point
---
*Oh you...*
---
10/10
---
Yes same. Scares the shit outta me sometimes
---
My mistake then, coulda swore the RBT timers worked the same as Deep Wounds
---
Damn I actually was gonna get Dance With Me as a perk
---
I try! I just try to make sure people have fun and it’s not only me having a good time.
---
Wait what the archives are t working damn I guess I’ll post about it.
---
*April rolls around*
---
April Fools! The event is cancelled.
---
Despite having the max connection when I play any other game this shit happens to me too and my friends tell me I have that good green ping.
---
It’s not my internet that’s the problem m8.
---
It's essentially the same thing... You are giving up either way. It's bullshit and unfair to your team.
---
Spreading themselves too thin by releasing a game no one wanted (Deathgarden) and porting DBD to platforms no one asked for (switch, mobile)
---
What if I had to go diarrhea for 30+ min
---
I seriously don't know what I expected.
---
probably would have had more time to fix it if the community wasnt being so pushy for them to release it in a buggy state :)
---
Lmao my friend wanted Dance With Me, Tanatophobia and Ruin. I'm so sad for him
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1189568626908684288?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf then what this mean? 😂
---
KILLLLLL MEEEEEE!
---
I hate weighting in like this, but as a dude with almost all his hours poured into Killer I gotta agree. It's getting easier and easier to play Killer.
---
Flashlight blinds, non-existent.
---
DS nerfed into the ground, literally because camping and tunneling is so easy
---
Instameds are now garbage.
---
Vaulting doesn't seem to matter because of trash hitboxes
---
Perks like Whispers, Barbecue, etc literally make the game just passively easier.
---
I literally refuse to play survivor unless its with friends FOR FUN on account of how garbage it feels to play survivor. Like maybe I'm coming off as whiny or crass. But I literally love playing killer, and survivor I've tried to enjoy but getting tunneled, moried, or just bs hitboxes make me angry. I don't find difficulty playing killer unless I play politely, like avoiding tunneling, giving players breaks. But I'd rather we all have fun.
---
plz buy 1000 cells pl0x we fix suun mucha charms n shiet
---
Yeah I made it, and I’m surprised it got reposted this fast lol
---
https://twitter.com/deadbybhvr/status/1189568236720930817?s=21
---
Not too sure how to fix it either, if it were me I would try to do an overhaul of some aura perks and make public comms
---
Also I do agree, about %50-%60 of the time SWF is cool and fun for everyone. Although sometimes it can get bad... just for reference https://youtu.be/q5uUUAz7m1U
---
Otz made a video of this and showed how optimal a swf can be which sorta scares me
---
If Dead Silence doesn't become a perk, I'm going to flip out
---
Well that joy was short-lived. Always one step forward and two backwards with BHVR.
---
Unplayable?
---
THE FUCKING ARCHIVES.  THEY WERE OPEN FOR ALL OF TEN MINUTES.  I WAS ALL EXCITED ABOUT THE ARCHIVES AND THEY ARE CLOSED BECAUSE THEY ARE BROKEN.
---
Fuck finally
---
I love it when I get it as Ghost Face
---
It is your internet stop being stupid “m8”
---
&gt;What if it was created using pirated software?
---
LOL
---
That's not what people are saying though.  People are, rightfully, pointing out that BHVR can't fix practically any bug most times and there will ALWAYS BE some horrible bug that people will have to deal with and the fact that in less than 40 minutes a bug happened SO BAD that they had to disable a MAJOR PART of the update.  I don't blame anyone who is upset about the delay nor the new delay for this reason.
---
I don't mind bugs if I can still DO the major part of this update which was the rift I was super hyped for, and I'm just sad that I have to wait longer to actually DO the thing I was really hyped for.  Still though, hopefully it gets hotfixed soon.
---
Yep. They knew they couldn’t fix it in time for Halloween but didn’t want the embarrassment of having to announce a further delay into November, so seems like they said fuck it and just released it anyway, then suspended the Archives and announced that with the premade graphic.
---
Don’t worry, it was just a typo on their behalf
---
Do you want a feature that doesn't progress but it's on time or a working one a bit delayed?
---
I know it's annoying to have delays but that's how it is. At least the update is out and *hopefully* working.
---
I’m sure everyone who defended BHVR saying that they delayed it so the release wasn’t fucked up are going to come through and apologize though, so that’s nice!
---
*angry scratch mirrior noises*
---
there isnt a single time where everyone on earth isnt at work, so some people just have to get lucky/unlucky with when updates are
---
At least we got the Event

Well if a new player has enough shards for both, good for them.
---
Lockers counter BBQ. Just jump into one and count to 5 when a survivor gets hooked. For Ruin, you may as well get used to it. The more you climb in ranks, the more Ruin you see. Eventually, Ruin is in every single game.
---
Nah the archives which is tied into the event is broken so you can play and test new features but its buggy.
---
Hawkins lab is the worst map in the game
---
30/11?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/lkB27ti.png](https://i.imgur.com/lkB27ti.png)
---
I've fucking had it.
---
Fuck you, and fuck your stupid event.
---
lmao
---
It makes sense. Disable it before the entire mass is playing it and save those tiers. I would like to think they'd maybe honour the free tiers for whoever got them as a "you didn't see this" kind of ordeal. They'd lose money if they kept it up.
---
WHY THE FUCK WAS THE ARCHIVES DISABLED HOLY FUCK BHVR!
---
My guess is that the issue was the fact that people already had Rift progress despite not having done anything in the Archives. I’d bet money that that’s the reason why they disabled it: to reset everyone back to zero instead of having people with various levels of progress that they never actually did.
---
great so we can not get the serum now but the event is still active meaning that the event is slowly ticking down before it goes away giving us even less time to get the serum. If they don't extend the event after this I would not even be surprised...
---
What about the Shrine update? Better post it again in case someone miss the other 10 posts.
---
Fax
---
Literally just got Bubba to 40
---
i feel like they won't cuz they'd be upstaged by the already amazing chase music concepts that jon rob and mr envy on youtube do
---
CLAUDETTES MAD (X24)
---
To make things worse, the shrine just changed again to BBQ
---
hey did you onow the archives aren’t working? you should post about it
---
they delayed the update because of an issue, we waited patiently but this is bullshit. Also my bad on the plant thing i did not read but i do read the news
---
I bought Leatherface and suddenly they changed the shrine to BBQ. goddamit
---
All good. I can wait.

Fucking hat that garbage map

Not like I wanted to spend these auric cells I bought last Monday or anything...hopefully fixed by end of day?
---
So you’re claiming that every single killer has awful internet when it’s your connection to theirs.  You’re the variable that stays the same in each one but are just in denial
---
Oh you poor thing this being your first event
---
i just bought shards and in that exact moment it dessapeared lol
---
Didn’t say it was every match bruh.
---
I'm gonna bet that since they turned it off so quickly, fixing the Archives is entirely on their end so releasing the fix won't require going through re-certification.
---
But definitely a bunch of people are holding off until the Archives, myself included. Not a reason not to release the patch, but also yeah unless you're a 24/7 dbd weirdo might as well hold off as a player.
---
yae... yae...
---
Lmao the event has been out for 21 minutes
---
If I am getting it right. They don’t do much but give a little extra bloodpoints? Not like last year when you could grind skins for free?
---
Lmao exactly man. I don’t let myself get bothered about online arguments too much, but I couldn’t express enough to them that this was just speculation and I never said it was true and they couldn’t get that thru their rank 20 brain lmao.

No offense to new players who haven't yet gotten to realize that this is a consistent issue.

I mean being upset doesn’t make them work any faster, what’s the sense in over reacting.

literally a post on the front page of this subreddit

Oh I didn’t realize I guess dead by daylight console is just messed up

What a joke

disabled for now

Aaaaand they fucked it up. Because why wouldn't they.

I’m a constantly terrified survivor main.

Excuse me

I readjusted that comment to add more context read it again real quick for more info
---
You don’t play with me
---
Nah they just made all hooks event hooks in the past so this wouldn't be an issue. Not sure why they didn't just make them unbreakable in this one though.
---
I like the drawing but my main reason for upvoting was for the generator
---
Welp I'm gonna miss the event.
---
Same give me more stories!!
---
I'm still dreaming of being chased by thomas the tank engine with the same theme.
---
will do it
---
No, it's factual
---
You're replying to me Everytime you have the opportunity to
---
What is swf
---
I can see why they did it, and it makes sense.
---
Wait there’s an upstairs??
---
If I remember correctly from a few weeks back, they're discounting all cosmetics before the Chapter 13 update, but I could be wrong.
---
Pretending that there isn't a problem is just an invitation for the whole thing to repeat itself in the future, though.
---
The "battle pass" was the way you got the serum for the Withering Blight skins (the free one of course)
---
They said they needed more time. People bitched, but they got more time. Their time is up - because it's Halloween tomorrow. They release the update, and it's completely bugged enough to need to be taken down.
---
The problem is that people just wanted a Halloween event on Halloween. They did NOT have to tie it to the Archives, which understandably is a big update. They could have just reused the same code from last year, with the rewards just being new skins. Nobody knows why the fuck they have chosen to do it this way. If the Archives were a separate update, and they had to be delayed, nobody would mind. But Halloween is time-sensitive. We don't want a Halloween event mid-November.
---
Oink
---
That feature comes with the Archives/Rift which has been disabled cuz BHVR doesn't know what they are doing.
---
nurse is fine lol
---
They don't create new graphics for each update &gt; except this one has the name of this update :V
---
Same shit! I played on low for lots of other reasons before this!
---
The largest reason there arent cosmetics for licenced characters much is because not only how hard it is to get licencing to add the cosmetics, but they have to give such a large cut to the founding company, they need to charge huge amounts for the cosmetics to make a profit
---
If you think they were fine then you never played killer at red ranks
---
Not the hero we deserved
---
Hmm, I thought that I would be able to take off Hangmans Trick for the event. I guess I'll keep running it.
---
They disabled the because players logged on and were already progressed some levels. They disabled it to locate the source of the problem and to reset everyone
---
the joke is that double bloodpoints and events bring out the toxic people.
---
I'd understand if it was the offerings needed to unlock skins, but that's not how it works this year. the pestula offerings are only for more bloodpoints.
---
Yea I just saw it right after I posted sorry
---
How did you purchase the pass? I don't see it in the store yet.
---
Look for petals in your blood web. They’ll increase blood points for doing the blight generators and more orange hooks for killers. They give you some serum I think? You can unlock skins in the store w the serum. Other than that new archives is here but not available.
---
Should I remind you they cancelled the summer event ( not cosmetics ofc ) to fix things?
---
Archives unavailable for unforseen circumstances btw
---
This is one of those games that you have to play to get better at. Play as the killer some too so you can figure out how they work also.
---
You posted it on YT back in June  
---
Should have posted it here earlier
---
How dare the devs try to be fair to everyone
---
Yeah lol. I’ve never been on the map myself. Entity ate the offering as I saw it. But from videos I’ve watched it looks like 3 levels almost. There’s a lot of stairs
---
what bothers me is it's still going to be unfair for ppl because I doubt they will take away levels
---
No lol.
---
I mean, it make sense, even tho, they fucked up taking so long for giving us a buggy archives
---
Thanks for the info
---
No.
---
should've been dedicated servers but ok
---
This game has enough bugs without Oogie.
---
People want to get into arguments, just for the sake of it. Doesn’t make any sense.
---
You probably could have written, “Kate wasn’t a character in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies.”
---
And he/she still would have been like “REEEE.”

Could be a troll. Just wanted to put a message so you didn’t think everyone reading thought you were a delusional dipshit or something.

But who is the Spider-man
---
Such a bad dev team.
---
I heard that's happening on Friday
---
They said a blood hunt started on Twitter lmao I’d love to know where it’s at
---
Starts tomorrow for Halloween.
---
I'M SO SICK OF PLAYING FUCKING RANK 16 KILLER AND GETTING PLAYED AGAINST RANK 6-8'S! I AM TWICE THEIR RANK WHY AM I BEING PLAYED AGAINST THEM
---
That's an interesting way to look at it, but I honestly don't see the frustration. 1. Because I'd rather save my shards for things that normally cost money (cosmetics), and 2. because you can max a killer bloodweb in a week if you play every day. I could see the frustration growing if you only play 3 matches a day or something though.
---
easy fix just give everyone levels as a sorry for the delay
---
Yeah, I know that’s how you do the killer instinct, I just suck at shredding so I almost never use it.
---
Oh okay im just sayin that everyone of these toxic swf thinks that billy and spirit "op" bc they can get ez downs. I didnt understand your question. Sorry dude.
---
I wasn't going to do the free one. I was planning on paying for it to get the better rewards. But am legit concerned over how it will run now.
---
That's what I'm saying.
---
Ha that's for sure.
---
Yeah, I think we're all starting to realize that. They're a joke. It's embarrassing at this point. Really wish they'd sell the rights to someone who knows what they're doing.
---
I ain't even surprised.
---
Try stuff out for yourself instead of constantly looking to mimic someone else. Especially washed up streamers who don't have a real understanding of a very simplistic game.
---
He gets a new pack every time he wakes up at the bonfire of course. The Entity may want to eternally torture him, but it isn't so heartless to take away his ciggs too.
---
at least its working oh wait it isnt. Honestly glad I went into this with no expectations at all, its been very enjoyable.

r/LeaksByDaylight Banner for a Halloween bloodhunt got leaked.

“Here comes the trapper, better watch out for his traps”
---
I would prefer having this shrine because it’s impossible to get bbq and chili on switch version
---
I understand that, I'm just saying that this would be cool to see if they were able to
---
I haven't found a way... So dispute the 'event' being out, we still get jerked around
---
It's a video game. Who cares. It's not like only the first 500 people to get max level get a prize or something.
---
Please use the pinned Megathread.
---
Did you expect anything else?
---
I know right? They could have added the pustula flowers... so lazy
---
This is the DBD team we're talking about. That graphic likely had over half the team working on it for several months to ensure that it could make it to their twitter page bug free, and we're still lucky it didn't crash the internet.
---
I am a Freddy main, I never played old Freddy, but I do find new Freddy a ton of fun to play. I think either is probably a solid choice. Perks are the one of those things where I don’t think buying either for their perks is all that meaningful. I don’t run any of Freddy’s, I run BBQ, Nurse’s, Ruin and Sloppy Butcher right now. I got Pop on the Shrine but have to wait for it to show up.
---
I don't like face camping for any reason though. Even they were to die I think they would still consider it a win that they were able to tilt me over a video game.
---
Right, but that's why I said *must.* You can still buy the skins with Cells without use of the Rift.
---
As a killer main, all I want is for them to be closer.
---
Spider-man... was a hero. I just couldn't see it. He was... a thief! A criminal! He stole my suit! He's a menace to the entire city!
---
Absolutely. League also does it well, with clearly defined categories and subsections, each with the raw data and a short explanation. This could work well in DBD by giving broad sections like Killer Changes, Survivor Changes, Map Changes, and then explaining each below the header.
---
Hey this is good for me, that means I have a better chance of catching up because school is annoying af
---
&gt;:(
---
Nice started grinding out for ruin and decided to buy the leatherface dlc for bbq based on yesterday shrine, then today this happen, fuck me i guess ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Stop linking that sub.
---
I agree that saying I need time to play idk.. Trapper when you already know how to play killer it’s a bit ridiculous...
---
But if people have fun camping .. idk.. who are we to tell people how to play... and live their life.
---
If you’re against a camper, be patient, do what you can, and go on the next game :) you’ll forget about it in 20 mins^^
---
What is the shrine this week
---
Brah
---
Honestly my biggest complaint about her. I can live with the lackluster perks, but the axe is perfect for chopping pallets. Spirit uses her sword, for crying out loud.
---
Me too wtf
---
You look awesome!!
---
&gt; They would get absolutely torn apart for that.
---
That hasn't stopped them from putting money over common sense before.
---
Except you only got like 150 characters to talk shit on twitter,
---
reddit dont
---
Styptic change was probably necessary, the PTB styptic seemed a bit strong on paper.
---
Syringe is just actively worse than Styptic now I think. Not that much use you can get out of it with a 16 second timeframe. Health state changes cancel it, full use of a medkit if you use it. Bleh.
---
I think they should either make it just consume the syringe on use (not the medkit or other addon) or just rework it again to have old styptics effect. I dont think many people had that much of an issue with old styptic, just old syringe.
---
Just got 2 from 1 web
---
See you tomorrow
---
lol sure you weren't. do you think i'm stupid?
---
I wish they'd just cancel the event and deposit 6 serum in everyone's wallets. Fuck it. They're never going to get it right and even when/if they do it'll hardly matter anymore.
---
Not everything needs to be a part of Dead by Daylight. Just because they posted a gif of Nightmare Before Christmas doesn't mean they are working on a Nightmare Before Christmas chapter.
---
Because it never would have been caught otherwise...
---
You must be new here.
---
can confirm, am DG Meg, am bad.
---
Not a killer but blendettes. Once I was walking over to a gen on pale rose and boom suddenly a Claudette appeared in front of me and I was shook. Happens all the time though so I’ve gotten more used to it.
---
David and Jane look like they’re about to kick Julie and Frank’s asses
---
rooeened
---
And lots of little sub-levels that take you halfway up in a room, and so many places to drop for Balanced Landing. It feels worse than Haddonfield for most killers, but if you manage to three-gen the bottom floor it's not all that bad.
---
Maybe we'll get to play it some time. :D
---
You can’t try them out unless you have the ultra rareoffering that lets you try out the killer for one match. That aside he didn’t actually give you an answer. It was just spite and hate for the streamer and a dick response.
---
WHAT WHY NO
---
By event they mean the menu/hooks and gens.
---
You can't earn serum without the rift.
---
There's one upstairs area with a single person genny, and the weird portal room has an "upstairs" if there's another actual upstairs area I have yet to find it lol
---
The buff legion needs lmao
---
Agree
---
So, like.
---
What are the changes?
---
Splinters let you try licensed killers.
---
And now they have confirmed a bloodhunt on twitter.
---
[" All the gameplay changes, the bug fixes, the event and the bloodhunt are still active! "](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1189568626908684288)
---
And of course there is no bloodhunt active. They probably planned for a bloodhunt later, but because they can't communicate properly they manage to even fuck up what little damage control they could muster.
---
Big sad, this game hates it's player base I swear
---
Why wouldn't they be? What's BHVR's fucking excuse for delaying an event that they waited 'til the ass end of horror month to deliver that still turned out a broken piece of shit after the delay? What's BHVR's fucking excuse for this not even being the first time this has happened? It's inexcusable. This is their *job* that they are *paid* to do.
---
Survive with friends. People who are chatting together and communicating through mics, tend to have flashlights and instaheals, desperately try to stop you from hooking.
---
I've got it. Oh shit, it was Haunted Grounds.
---
Same. I only use moris for daily acheivos and even then I feel grimey as hell using them.
---
It was initially turned on, so I don't think they knew until it came up.
---
The best part is gonna be if it turns out it has to do with letting people buy rift pass stuff in the PTB. Saw some one say they started at level 14, might be that.
---
Are you survivor or killer? IIRC since survivors have the fireworks and lunchbox (medkit reskin) they're not getting the petal offerings as often as killers do.
---
Did you delete their comment? Lmao.
---
Man, I had this whole thing typed up. WHERE DID IT GO?
---
bUt ThEy'Re OnLy HuMaN
---
In that case what is the sense of Block the rift to the people of xbox and ps4?
---
Sneek
---
My shrine is different, is this regional or platform dependent?
---
I have a different shrine, I got haunted grounds, bbq, empathy, and detectives hunch
---
happy cake day tho :3
---
IT'S STILL A LORE THING. THE ENTITY BRINGS THE KILLERS INTO HIS REALM FOR ENTERTAINMENT. ESCAPING SURVIVORS ARE NOT ENTERTAINING, AND NEITHER ARE QUICK MATCHES. BESIDES, RANKING UP IN THIS GAME IS NOT ALL THAT IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE. ENJOY IT WHILE YOU CAN!!
---
Oh cool this answer why i cant open the archives menu lol
---
If it's that much of a problem just get leatherface and camp downed survivor with agitation. Fight bm with bm.
---
Are they fists?
---
getting the hatch to spawn with all four survivors still alive is difficult enough (at certain ranks, i'll grant that) that there's an achievement for getting all four people out through the hatch. you wildin.
---
Disappointed but not surprised
---
Shit happens. The people here look a hell of a lot worse.
---
Lord knows we don't need any more bugged mechanics in this game.
---
I'm glad I can collect the Halloween stuff since I missed it last year, but they've been really disappointing me with all the issues
---
because the glitch will prob happen on ps4 and xbox
---
"Oh no my free content update that I'm not paying for isn't happening when I expected it, damn devs how dare you run into bugs and issues, the nerve! Work overtime next time to get my free update done for me on time! Because the video game industry isn't toxic enough for devs as is and I value my free update over you being to go home to your family for dinner!"
---
*chain smoker laugh intensifies*
---
So the Rift is unavailable as well?
---
🦧🦧🦧
---
Agreed :(
---
Isn't tombstone the automatic mori? How is an instaheal going to counter that?
---
Freddy is way better than Myers mate.
---
The same as always. Never too much enthusiastic but pretty consistently let down.
---
The community manager for the Total War games [gave a great talk about this](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-07-11-fighting-a-toxic-steam-community-and-winning). Long story short, you can make things better for everyone if you just engage, something that BHVR is terrible at doing
---
.-. You raised a half baked concern. Also, not legible? The fuck? You do know what that means right? I don't think you do.
---
This is amazing and one of the greatest things I've seen on this subreddit
---
I honestly feel like it may have been since they weren’t even trying to make sense in their last comment. Also idk where your comment went, but no I didn’t delete their comments. Reddit is just weird lol
---
Played Hawkins with Trapper last night. Brutal 4k. So many trap points. After 'The Game' I thought he would suck on that map but holy hell, it's a Trapper play ground.
---
So many narrow choke points. Every chase ends with a loud snap.
---
*Dark souls boss music starts playing*
---
And then there's the people disconnecting when given hatch
---
Lol there are definitely a lot of people overreacting but it’s definitely a huge let down.
---
The whole point of this being delayed was so they CAN rollback the tiers. If anyone bought them the devs will probably just make them file a support claim if it's not easy to tell who bought what on their end, but tbh they SHOULD have set up an infrastructure to be able to tell who bought what on their end, but who can tell with these guys lmao.
---
Wow Instagram is obnoxious. I wanted to check out the rest of their art but it's trying to force me to login. Don't have an account and don't plan to. Disappointing.
---
Meh.
---
They’ll release it when they release it. It’s disappointing but unfortunately nothing any of us could do about it, or can do.
---
Meme template credits to u/Yosh1kage_K1ra
---
What system you on though?
---
The event is tied to the Archives. Which has been turned offline.
---
So no one can actually do the event, so really, no it isn't out.
---
Yeah there already looking into it
---
Ps4 just like u
---
Freddy as a character is stronger but the perks Myers has will be more helpful in e long run, especially once you start getting them for other characters
---
Shrouds are useless
---
She is strong, she doesn't need a sharp weapon to break wood.
---
OK DUDE.
---
Clearly this was the reason why it was delayed, and they realized that they wouldn't be able to fix this and release before Halloween, so they opted to release without the feature. It's a pretty reasonable decision.
---
I feel it is unfortunate, but not a big deal breaker for me. Still gonna play it. However, I know I generally have a really chill attitude about alot of things in general so my opinion probably isn't good to go on. :)
---
Actually no, was expected they fucked up AGAIN
---
It bothers me that so many people defended the delay in the first place when this was expected to happen
---
Plants were dumb. Killer got vials for just playing the game, survivors had to go out of their way for the plants before the other survivors harvested them all. Most people only worried about themselves so there were many games that I got zero progress towards a vial.
---
Not to mention that it just gave something else for the killer to patrol. So fucking glad that they didn't make a return this year.
---
No one can read i guess lmao. You’re not a clown. You’re the entire circus
---
Is it OK if I ask a question out of curiosity?
---
&gt; running Ruin turns most games into a boring slog as killer.
---
Yeah, I want to see you try not running Ruin (or Corrupt Intervention) at Rank 1 on a killer besides Nurse/Spirit. Why don't you do that and tell me what a boring slog it is? Except it wouldn't be boring.. because gens would be done before you could even blink.. because rank DOES mean something.
---
I like it. Just denied a bubba his noed. But I'm running a map with it so I'm not the only one who can see the totems ;)
---
This aged well.
---
The cosmetic description says its made out of a raincoat
---
The progress for the event is tracked by the rift as far as I can tell. There's no ui in the game for tracking it that I can see. It's a valid criticism. They should have actually held off the update if they weren't ready. It was already delayed.
---
bitch the game costs money to play and releases DLC all the time dont you fucking dare call it a "free update"
---
Yes I am I only have the game for about a month
---
You asked for peoples thoughts, why the fuck you tryna tell them "NO HATCH MUST BE REMOVED"
---
Have you ever even went 1v1 against a killer who closed the hatch with both gates near each other with EGC? If thats the case you are fucking dead dude. Hatch gives a chance to escape and if you remove that chance to escape whats the last guy gonna do? DC?
---
Seriously. Tfw when you leave a safe gen to run halfway across the map to save someone who just suicides or dc’s is terrible too.
---
A date with his sister....
---
There's one. It's really unsafe, but also *really* out of the way. I try to corral a survivor up there to have it done sooner. If it's one of the last three gens, it makes defending ineffective
---
As a new player this is a poor first impression. It seems they wanted to get it out on time not caring about the end product.  It doesn't look pretty at all and makes me wonder what other practices they do. They have the art for it ready to go and all.
---
In the other hand. Maybe it is not a shady thing and it bugged out going live. Such bugs can happen but I'm not sure about this since I don't know much about games. But played test builds that was fine in others and then they go live and it not like didn't go through a test phase. 
---
Making guesses is useless tho. What I wish to have right now is an event that has at least bugs as possible and I wish they take their time because no matter what the reason is, the players are not happy and it looks at best, ironic.
---
Unlucky there's no marv in here
---
Then what's the point of this fucken 12GBA update
---
I mean all they do now is give more points. They dont effect serum now
---
Or they have banners like that ready ahead of time in case something happens and just change the text???
---
low is always the way to go as killer
---
Hopefully not the same thing that happened to people who had proof they had a legacy (aka a big fk off)
---
Are insta-downs in danger?
---
Its part of the rift from what I've heard, which is closed due to a bug
---
Well they didn't hold off the up so I'm sitting here with no and 12GB update that is literally pointless
---
Thank you a lot &lt;33 
---
It was a birthday present for someone who loves the game.
---
Eh still not enough reason to equip Small Game
---
I have no idea as contest rules are specific to each contest. However, in most instances you would give up any rights upon submission. 
---
Regardless, my first point to you addressed the legality which is pretty cut and dry and the second was my opinion based on my licensing experience in the industry. BHVR is fully capable of creating their own music.
---
Bruh, if the dev team is going to repeat this whole thing in the future, then it doesn't matter whether or not the community gets fussy
---
Septic agent lol. I think they're fine as is
---
Wait so Play With Your...
---
OP you kinky bastard.
---
Whenever doing generators your body interacts with you personally to grief you in this game lol. I was playing the game and suddenly had a really bad itch not on the nose and had to get it and boom missed a skill check.
---
I didn’t really care when they chose Quentin for the Nightmare dlc, but it’s only because I preferred Nancy from the original Nightmare on Elmstreet. I didn’t even know who Quentin was at first lmao. Lowkey forgot he existed in the remake
---
NOT LIKE IT REALLY MATTERS ARCHIVES ARE BUSTED ANYWAYS LMAO
---
Ignore him.  He lost all credibility when he claimed Otz as a washed up streamer with no understanding of the game.  5 mins into any of his videos will disprove that horseshit.
---
First off, how is he meant to try them before he buys them?
---
Second off, otz is far better (and more knowledgeable!) at this game than you will ever be. Why you gotta be such a hater?
---
Yeah you’re alone on that one, chief. I don’t know anybody who wants a broken game over one working properly, and this game has had plenty of issues. People are tired of that. The expectation is that things would run smoothly.
---
I'm not able to play at the moment - did they release it and then disable it half an hour later? I'm pretty glad I'm away if that's the case
---
Yeah, but again, everything released *before* chapter 13. Stuff like the biker outfits, ballroom stuff, pizza dwight, etc.
---
Oh wow, all the perks are actually preeetty neat.
---
OF COURSE THERE ISNT.
---
Hopefully it works out and isn't a mess. I'm going to wait and see considering the past few weeks.
---
Why would i want to play a game i have no chance of winning? im fine with losing when i get outskilled, but moris are boring unless a new killer comes out
---
I thought it was a good idea to keep it low for higher fps/less lag/visibility is clearer for low res players and going ultra just makes it look like you’re hidden when you’re not t0 them.
---
You don't seriously expect survivors to do bones now, do you?
---
this is pretty creative my man, thanks for sharing
---
Went against a nurse with NOED and Mori my second game today lmao
---
Dude, I'm not disagreeing with that there are some better players who'eve earned it but i have thousands of hours to and to deny that people don't cheat to rank to read and say red is always right it is like come on man. Have you never see the shitty rank 1 who are like playing early ranks learning? You are assuming I know not all red I said some but to assume that all rank brown bad players and tellin other players how to play is absurd. If the abilities are in the game stop shaming people because you don't like how it ruins your play style or makes you look bad. It is about a challenge and if you don't accept noed and other perks are in it and shame others for playing a killer should then what's the point? so you didn't tunnel that's good on you so you don't camp great but if it works for others then leave them alone and take your hours somewhere else. But as a player from the beta till now I've seen alot brother and I'm not going to insult you because this is going nowhere. I see both sides but to bully tell others how to play then assume your way is the right and nothing is possible is absurd. SO let's end it here I'm not about fighting with someone who's just convinced the same that just because someones a rank means they can be the worse. I just faced three levels 8's at rank 10 and they where terrible dc ed so let's be honest here so let's agree to disagree okay.
---
Where are the 20+ comments this thread is supposed to have right now ?
---
Try and outplay the killer. If the doors spawn close you got unlucky but it’s your own teams fault for dying and failing to accomplish their objective
---
you’re an idiot lol
---
As someone who has mained both freddy is much better right now imo.
---
Myers is strong and has better teachable perks tho but most top players consider freddy to be top 5, and above Myers
---
Yea. Maybe he just finished a really bad match and is still full of salt but... who knows?
---
Are you new to the game? Because they change every week
---
DON'T WORRY NONE OF US ARE PLAYING IT EITHER DUE TO [UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES](/intensifies)
---
It's just sad at this point. Until they can stop hyping the masses for nothing it's just wasted time.
---
does anyone know how to get the serum?
---
Feel free to criticize and play, but don't criticize a company for trying to give you a better product at the cost of it not being convenient for you.
---
 Doom Eternal got delayed a few months because releasing it in the state it was in would have resulted in the game being an absolute disaster. It's the same thing here. Only difference was the doom fans accepted it and thanked the dev's for making sure it was playable on release. You all just piss on them no matter what they do. Had they released it you would have said it was terrible because you couldn't play. They push it back so you can flag and you piss on them because you have to wait a week. They can't win regardless
---
Me \^
---
&gt; are you actually that mad. jesus christ.
---
WELL, I'M GOING TO GO MAKE DINNER AT 11:03AM SO I DON'T HAVE TO DO IT LATER. BIG RIP BHVR
---
You can't until the archives (and rift) is active.
---
You can at least get bonus bloodpoints.
---
So, you only play this game when there's an event? Good, go play RDR2, we don't want you
---
I would personally say Freddy is stronger. He doesn't have Michael's M1 ability or psuedo stealth but he can shut down loops with his pools, make survivor's take dead loops with his pallets and has excellent map pressure thanks to his teleport. He has excellent synergy with a lot of perk builds that'll help you secure skills, especially at higher ranks. 
---
Myers has better snowball potential and is really fun to play as well but if you're looking for the stronger one, I say Freddy. But people will disagree on strength of killers.
---
Aside, apparently all DLC will be on sale next month so you could wait it out and get both.
---
Freddy is a top 3 or 4 killer right now depending on where you have Billy.  I personally think Freddy edges him out these days.  He is absolutely nutty post rework.
---
Intense gen pressure, and the ability to completely destroy loops on the fly with your snares.  He's strong against swf groups too if you know what you're doing.  Get Nightmare you won't be dissapointed.
---
KNOWN ISSUES: 
---
Survivor Shadows can be seen in front of bubble indicators?
---
Y'all.
---
You forgot the smol billy
---
No? There's a bunch of different ways to get insta-down, you'd have to keep an eye out of whatever specific thing you're thinking of. Like iridescent hatches are (probably) going away whenever Huntress gets a review.
---
If you're thinking about moris, not yet but god willing they delete the ebony mori and shift the other two up in tiers.
---
is the flashlight good for freddy's that are just stalking you?  or better to just try to break line of sight?
---
I am actually ashamed.
---
Why are you getting downvoted for literally just saying the truth? You didnt even put in any opinion or anything lmao just a quick, simple, and true fact.
---
Reddit blows my mind some days
---
Legion is fine.
---
No she wasn’t.
---
I think the dude is either serious, and he meme's in the game, or he's trolling you, lol. He said he uses No Mither with two healing perks, Second Wind and Self Care.
---
Because the times i was at rank 5 were almost before the rank resets. So I didn't have much time to rank up to the red ones
---
There's no way you didnt have this prepared before the update 😂
---
Read the edit man
---
Hawkins ain’t that bad
---
It’s disappointing but I feel bad for them, clearly doing the best they can. I imagine they were rushed a lot to get it out by Halloween
---
I’m sure u mean Michael and it’s probably better to just break line of sight
---
It is boring but last year the game was dead due to the event. Everyone just sat on plants
---
so when survivors get 0 safe windows and no pallet spawns on lerys its still survivor sided?
---
If the killer camps everyone and we genrush and theres noed everyone fucking dies, also take into account that in our Singapore dedicated server we keep meeting many speedhackers. Even if I tried I would die, also how does one "outplay" the killer when they've spotted you and its egc and you can't open the gate because they are chasing you? Its basically a dead end if u get spotted trying to open gates especially when they spawn near each other
---
I don’t understand either mentality, it’ll come when it comes as long as the game works I’m satisfied.
---
This is a pretty big nerf to survivor imo
---

It is better to spend BP than Shards

Thats correct

Wazzuuuuuuuuuppp

I’ve been out the loop for a lo(ooooooo)ng time. Is this a battle pass kinda thing? 
---
Also, have I missed the Halloween event?
---
https://youtu.be/MK6TXMsvgQg

Please, please, please!!!!
---
Yeah, he said that in postgame. Was a camping, tunneling, speedhacking and wallhacking ghostface. Had no bbq but was able to pinpoint out exact locations :(
---
Parfait pseudo pour ce genre de message.
---
I’m sure they were rushed but after a week delay... I feel like a few more days would’ve been better then finally getting the event buggy. Maybe just pop out an eta?
---
really?
---
But mommmmmmm
---
I'm in the Singapore dedicated server so... there are many profiles popping up with certain hacks and everything
---
Just uninstall the game. We don't need people like you playing it:)
---
Survive with friends is just a term you say when you are going against a premade team or people who are in a party together
---
This community has always been like that unfortunately. I don't know how the devs are still here to be honest, such an ungrateful fanbase.
---
There are a few times where killers land a bullshit lunge that should never hit but outside of that they've been good. Definitely more reliable connection all around.
---
absolutely nothing. as a killer main, theyre the best things in the game
---
Freddy is a better killer. That being said it depends on your playstyle. If you like stealth killers and slowing the game down, get pig. If you like map control and controlling chases, get Freddy.
---
And pass purchased! I HAS CHARMS NOW WOOOOO
---
Tier 7 for me, although I haven’t done a single quest yet.
---
its an actual question
---
If it takes you a month to get to rank 5, you are farther from red ranks than you think.
---
As a killer with shitty vision and fucktacular geographical awareness Hawkins can go and shit into its throat.
---
The PIG is badass, glad jigsaw is incorporated. 
---
Pizza dwight, love it, made me laugh. 
---
Constructive criticism: too much of the game items like cassette tapes, video cameras take away from your great, creepy idols. Maybe use them but way less, or just small at the bottom. 
---
You seem like a busy artist, keep up the great work!
---
Well already fixed

I can’t help but feel the irony of your last post in your comments.
---
A date with his sister...
---
The map is always free. It is really random. I had an offering, didn’t notice it, and lost it on the bloodweb. So I guess I’ll never get the map 😭
---
I would recommend Freddy, just because he is one of the easiest to learn higher tier killers and, in my opinion, extremly fun to play with basically two different powers via addon, one of them being super good and the other one super fun (and potentially good).
---
Yep!
---
I can has cheezburger?
---
this event has been fucking up and down constantly
---
+ rift gets announced alongside withering blight
---
- event gets delayed for an unknown period of time
---
+ they manage to get it out on time
---
- archives dont work
---
i really hope they make the dream work out here boys
---

Waiting atleast 4 days before co sidering buying the pass but if it's gonna stay up:
---
#NOICE
---
It has been enabled now.
---
Yeah, I try to enjoy fun perks then get facecamped or tunneled like a son of a bitch and then killers wonder why I start running meta perks again. I'd like to mix it up but you get punished for it a lot of the time.
---
Thank you!  👏
---
So much! 👏
---
Behaviour! 👏
---
For adopting a new platform! 👏
---
And then not support it! 👏
---
During the biggest event of the year! 👏
---
Trapper would probably keep the default music
---
That was quick, I love you again BHVR
---
Good choice on killer! Billy is definitely one of the best for his insane map pressure. Once you get down his chainsaw sprint and learn how to hit around corners, you'll unstoppable.
---
Yes, they did remove instant healing.
---
No, they haven't discussed removing Ebony Memento Moris or any one shot potential items.
---
What is This? A non legion cosplay?! Instant 10/10 for me
---
Cowrus do you have like a bot or something cause your always on top to post the bhvr official stuff
---
I’d rather have BBQ than Ruin tbh. Too bad the survivor perks are slightly worse.
---
I'm rank 9, though. I haven't played on the PTB.
---
Tier 20 O-o
---
Yay!
---
Thank god, I was really thinking it would’ve taken another day or a few.
---
I can deal instadown add ons as frustrating as they can be. Ebony mori first would be my priority. It’s easily the most OP thing in the game. You really should not be able to just end the game after 1 hook lol.
---
They usually walk on all 4s in the show.
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
they better roll this back idgaf bout bbq
---
It's back up!
---
Your meme is impressive, you must be very proud
---
Love the design of the map but hate the layout. Everything looks sooooo samey and dark and I usually end up just wandering around searching for gens. Guess I need to just get used to it since I used to feel the same way about Gideon
---
yep, meant michael
---
This, well, toxic and tryhard people.
---
what does that add up to 80% exhaustion cooldown? holy shit
---
If only lol
---
a true memelord
---
&gt;Players who progressed in the game since October 18th have accumulated Rift level progression from our backend. We will not revert this progression,
---
While not ideal, I admit that I prefer reskins to the BS pustula plants that ruined every survivor game for the first week of the event.  Everyone was ignoring the objective, killing themselves whenever they got their serum filled, disconnecting if someone stole their plant, it fucking sucked.  This is lazy, I agree, but it's still better than last year IMO.
---
So far, I think the Chinese New Year had the best event since it had onpy marginal impacts on gameplay and both survivors and killers had an actual unified objective rather than having 1 team hobble themselves while the other played completely normally.  More events should be modeled after that one.
---
Mod had every reason to remove that post
---
Wait they changed that? might as well just completely remove the red stain at this point then since seeing it through walls was the only usefulness of it.
---
Also takes away a HUGE skill factor from the killer side, you don't have to moonwalk anymore to try and mindgame.
---
the archives are back up
---
I posted it 5 minutes earlier :(
---
lmao 
---
I just checked Twitter and saw they posted this 30 seconds ago, so I switched tabs as quickly as possible to win the karma race
---
Oh I didn't see it my bad
---
Considering that at most players completed 1 quest, they could easily just do a full reset and their wouldn't be a problem.
---
It made it easy when the killer only pressed W during the entire chase.
---
Killers that actually mindgamed by hiding the stain didn't have any issues with jungle gyms.
---
Well played, great meme.
---
They tweeted that these are legit progressions from what we played before the update apparently. pretty cool!
---
I wanted thana damn it, the only one I have left lol.
---
Oh come on, not agaaain...
---
28 stab wounds were reported at this event, the suspect's name was Susie
---
I actually have already the perks from the other and 3 of this shrine. It just caught me off guard, Is empathy any good? Is the only one I don't have
---
I posted it to the Sub, it’s pending right now :)
---
That was super fast good job Behavior!
---
I'm already tier 12 lul
---
E TU
---
Is there even a new bloodlust system?
---
You must be new to this game to say something that incorrect
---
Everyone expected this. Delayed **and** with bugs
---
Are you talking about what Malika said or BHVR disabling the rift?
---
I would understand if it was for something else, but unrelated topics? Really?? I don't think so
---
I can see it now. One of these days the clown is gonna chase someone and all of a sudden benny hill music starts playing

I mean it has never canonically been called an 'insta heal' anyway, that was something the community named it

I really like this actually, though adding a nazi character would probably raise some issues, even if he's objectively the villain of the chapter
---
....do I play this game too much? lol
---
Laters, good luck with that Nurse.
---
There is pumpkin on top of gen... enjy ur event
---
Getting points for other survivors DCing is pretty nice too
---
Thats not necessarily true, even if you hit greats that means you're capable of hitting greats without ruin too and its still slowing down the game. And looking for totems also take time.
---
Was just gonna ask if anyone else had them working. Seems fine for me on ps4

&gt; The Archives and The Rift are now enabled. Players who progressed in the game since October 18th have accumulated Rift level progression from our backend. We will not revert this progression, enjoy The Archives! #DeadbyDaylight #DbD
---
Lol disabled everyone “fuck BVHR they suck” 
---
Lol back again “ I’m sorry bvhr do you forgive me” 
---
The fuck.
---
"The Archives and The Rift are now enabled. Players who progressed in the game since October 18th have accumulated Rift level progression from our backend. We will not revert this progression, enjoy The Archives!"
---
Thanks BHVR, very cool!
---
You can't treat customers like that, lol.
---
So, Archives are back.
---
Took them all of 2 hours... Jesus, people were whining like crazy.
---
And you guys are even keeping your free progress.
---
They've made many mistakes before on Twitter, which means they keep contradicting themselves. Just don't listen if it's not an official announcement.
---
So if someone starts off at level 40 by some luck of the bug and I start off at level 3 it's not fair in my opinion because that other player has to worry a lot less about the time period the rift and archive has left while the level 3 dude has to put in a lot more work to complete everything.
---
That wasn't the official BHVR post though.
---
Isn't she his sister....
---
November Days Collection looks sweet
---
but..
---
is that an accurate Ghost Face costume????
---
Mods let all the ragers through but remove a funny meme? Ok.
---
True, but she shouldn't be standing that close to an active shooter lmao.
---
So if you played on the PTB you get to keep the levels?
---
Or is this for the live game too?
---
lmao I didn't play much because I wanted to wait until the patch. Oh well...
---
Can we please stop with this rollercoaster of emotions
---
Yes, get that late save!
---
Yeah they said they don’t want to do any more exclusives
---
Except Trapper on Switch for some reason lol
---
Is it just me or am I literally the only person that actually likes playing as/against leatherface? When a newbie plays him, he's just a Billy but with the Down syndrome, but he can be really deadly if played correctly..
---
I feel the same way I do about the devs I get back in 2017. Love them but they can be straight up frustrating at times. I’d like to say that dbd is the best worst game I’ve ever played.
---
Ok man tbh I shouldn’t have put anything in the description, the real discussion is the title.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dp9ued/already_level_5_on_the_rift_and_i_just_got_on_did/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
But I needed Dance With Me. :(
---
&gt;Damn, this is news to me. Still pretty lazy to just have the same cosmetics.
---
Its not the same cosmetics... We got 5 new ones plus all the old ones, so people can choose from 3 survivors and 9 killers. 
---
I was so happy to find out we would be able to buy old cosmetics with Serum because I don't play any of the characters featured this year.
---
There are new cosmetics and old ones
---
&gt;they already explained why thats happening
---
I remember when they were still owned by Starbreeze and people said the numerous issues are due to Starbreeze forcing them to rush releases.
---
Since they went independent from Starbreeze, we got, among other things:
---
- a killer that was so incredibly fucked that they had to start a rework immediately (Legion)
---
- a map that had to be immediately disabled because it caused people to crash and had horrible performance (Mt. Osmond)
---
- the awful Ghost Face PTB where he was completely unplayable due to being knocked out of stealth immediately and stalk progress resetting super fast
---
- broken dedicated servers that cause a lot of people to have issues (for example ranged attacks such as Huntress and Plague not behaving properly)
---
- that amazing and wonderful new rank system with the emblems combined with new matchmaking that then got reverted a few days after the patch which caused high rank players to be unable to play without waiting 30 minutes+ to get into a game - really the only way to play was to wait forever to get into a game and then disconnect to lose rank so you can actually get games in a reasonable amount of time
---
- this current mess
---
We also notably did not get:
---
- a summer event despite them having everything needed for it (offerings from last year, generator skins from last year, even cosmetics that are summer themed but those were sold instead)
---
- a better way to deal with disconnects, which are still a very common issue 
---
- rank rewards: not even something basic like some bloodpoints 
---
- improved totem placement on Disturbed Ward (the asylum map), there are spots where the totems spawn literally out in the open, they are not even covered by grass and those spots have existed since the totems came out
---
- an incentive to not dodge SWF teams: again not even something basic like additional bloodpoints
---
- any sort of new gamemode, unless you count the pustula nodes from last year's Halloween event, but those are not present for this year's event
---
Tier 9 from the start - yet to do any of the challenges/quests.
---
Thanks for the prompt update.
---
The event currency is tied to the archives, there essentially was no event.
---
They release one or two every week, they never all drop at once. Last I saw they were coming November 6 or something
---
At that point it would be time for a crusade
---
It wasn't even funny
---
And then they take it away the next morning :)
---
whose laughing now?
---
My patch is about to finish downloading too :)
---
Yeah you keep the levels
---
Rule 2: Unrelated Content
---
Putting "Dead by Daylight" in the title isn't good enough.
---
I like going against him and I don’t mind playing as him I just prefer to play and prestige pig or Myers instead. I main those two so now I can get BBQ without having to grind for it is all.
---
It'll give you the unlocks automatically
---
It’s just whatever XP you’ve earned on live servers since Oct 18 were converted into rift feagments
---
The only problem is that I have to go work a 48 starting tomorrow so I’ll already miss out on 2 days of progression
---
and it was fixed in like 30 minutes too, wonder why everyone is so eager to hate on the devs when the problem that caused it was basically impossible to test themselves lol, you all need to calm down
---
Ok thanks for the info
---
Ruin is possible to get without using real money, bbq isnt. Both are top tier perks so id much rather have bbq. Not to mention hag is fairly viable killer so leveling her to get ruin isnt a waste by any means
---
What do you mean the rift and archives aren't available? I thought they were releasing today.
---
Okok
---
Don't follow the leaks there's no confirmed date.
---
This kinda reminds me of the uh oh stinky orangutang
---
I looked at Twitter and there a problem with the shrine of secrets so they updated it just like last time.
---
Although I'm pretty sure with this update, spine chill will now work on t1 myers?
---
I think thats a proffesional way of saying no...  not a maybe
---
The DISGUST I feel is immeasurable
---
She's my main and so much fun. I love the mind games you get to use with her.
---
Using Lerys as an example is hardly a counter argument! That whole map is one big spin of the dice 😂 
---
But no that is fair enough, there are certain maps that will favour certain killers (eg nurse on Gideon Meat Factory) but the number of survivor friendly game factors, vastly outnumber the number of killer friendly factors
---
Everyone who diwnvoted you is the biggest pessimistic buttholes I've ever seen.
---
Flair, and obvious references to the scp, might give you a hint that this was a meme
---
Yeah, I'm a mod for him actually! And for real...been playing almost two years now and there's still stuff to learn haha
---
OH THANK GOD. It was getting out of hand
---
Everytime they see prettygoodjob.gif they take a drink but it never dulls the pain.
---
When your handling nine inches (of knife) do you really need to worry about leg day?
---
Damn those are insanely good
---
It always rains on Halloween
---
This took awhile to upload here due to both the cinematic's file size as well as my shitty uploading speed. I wanna play the event so I won't upload the rest until later, but someone will probably upload the rest by then anyway.
---
If you wanna look at the new cinematics yourself:
---
Right click DBD on Steam -&gt; browse local files -&gt; click DeadByDaylight folder -&gt; Content -&gt; Movies -&gt; Archives -&gt; Rwanda
---
Correct, the date they have listed for the collection release is 2019/11/06
---
*looks at phone and terror radius sound effect intensifies*
---
yessss
---
There is a basement, it's either under the stairs or in the room with the upside down stuff all over it
---
Yeah you would think they could just reset the start time but they probably don't want to break anything else.
---
Stain was only detrimental to you if you had no idea how to moonwalk and fake turns with it to mindgame, and if that was the case then that was your fault.
---
You can still see the stain and the killer through the holes in shack's walls and slits on jungle gyms, that didn't change.
---
I agree. It was really obnoxious esp since I really love playing Ghostface but OoO really can screw him over
---
No. In fact in pretty sure all stealth killers when undetectable are immune to it now
---
Your title doesn't make sense. Nothing was "brought back," it never left, and they relased a bunch of new items. How is it lazy to not remove old items from the store? Timed exclusivity is anti-consumer, why do you want it? Of all the the actual things to shit on BHVR for, this isn't one of them.
---
Also "me trying to find totems in Hawkins lab" works. XD
---
If you prepare to dash the survivor hears a loud noice.
---
That is why it is bad (in high ranks)
---
Withering Blight Event and a lot of patches.
---
Why not? It's 4% slowdown on all actions for each injured survivor that can only go away if they heal. I think it's really underrated.
---
It's back
---
Just hold W, bloodlust, and complain that you can't bloodlust a jungle gym. That's apparently the intended way of playing killer :\
---
As a somewhat new Plague that tried thanto + dying light, I also don't recommend running it. Take too long to build up stacks for the slowdown to be meaningful.
---
u/niitoishere is gonna take this from you and upload it on leaksbydaylight btw
---
Oh wow, now that is unfair.
---
If they would have told me that you already secretly progress in the rift with simply playing from the 18th till now, then I would have played more in the last week.
---
That's even worse than having a bug giving out progression randomly.
---
I have a token for it, if I could give it to you I would lol
---
Yeah, I know. Someone was bound to upload them eventually either way.
---
I remember that one time when me and my friend were having fun on that map, being completely fucking lost. It was especially fun considering the Killer that game seemed to be just as lost as us.
---
Boomer
---
Nice buff
---
Yes, Jack Skellington would never get into a horror game, it's just a joke, but I understand I did not make it obvious so... sorry for the confusion!
---
Killer alt palette break animations when bhvr
---
&gt; Just be happy they're adding free content to the game.
---
"Free" content.
---
its only viable on plague and legion tbh
---
It’s 4 gen and Sabo, seeing as players never can heal against plague, so you miss out on a third of the perk. At least with legion people will heal to go for saves, and so the heal slowdown actually comes up
---
Everyone here in the last 90 minutes: Rollercoaster of emotions.
---
Aww. 
---
Rudolph, you gets the hatch.
---
I knew that knife was compensating for something !
---
Bruh, Evan is such a goddamn cutie, my god. And I love his green eyes too.
---
no homo kinda
---
The syptic agent is still op it does the same thing red is in a better balance state
---
I have nothing more to say.
---
I appreciate the devs getting it back up but how can you continue bootlicking after this whole fiasco. It’s one fucking thing after another with BHVR, it’s an abusive relationship
---
Not bad
---
I love this meme because the background is my uni
---
I HATE FLASHLIGHT SAVES. THEY'RE BULLSHIT
---
This is why I dont play this game anymore to be honest.
---
Not in the sense of the new status effect introduced during the Stranger Things update, before today's patch stealth killers could still have their aura read even when their stealth ability was active. Except T1 michael for him this is more a rewording of an ability he already possessed.
---
How is that fair? If you didn't knew, and nobody knew, and then simply didn't played the last 10+ days then you're out of luck and got nothing.
---
nobody cares
---
I think a 16% slowdown against a team is still good, at least more dependable than Ruin. Ruin can go down in the first 2 minutes as is usually the case, or youre doing your job as a killer right and pressuring them too much for them to find it in which case thanatophobia is also good. It boils down to how good of a killer you are really.
---
Is the rift like any other game's battle pass with a free/paid or is this game's only paid?
---
I started at tier 9 idk :/
---
I spent about 10 hours grinding Bubba.
---
all of the datamined cosmetics are coming on early november
---
you have a new "web" of challenges that you must select and complete one at a time to unlock lore and "points" collect enough points and you level up on a track, the rift, that gives cosmetics, trinkets, and other goodies. The rift technically has two tracks that level up at the same time. A free one and a paid "battle pass" one. Most of the good stuff will be on the paid one including up to 1000 auric cells (so it pays for itself if you finish the whole track.)
---
Plain greed
---
Free and paid :)
---
As a meg main, can confirm. I used to fuck people over when I was a baby bc I was too scared to go back out once the gates were powered lol
---
(I don’t do that anymore I try my best now)
---
Trapper can no longer move over traps he places in front of him, he gets stuck. Yay...
---
It's bbq now lmao
---
The bug was that any games you played since the 18th progressed it
---
🎵Claudette morel....your last name...it rhymes..with hell 🎵
---
Hi claudette :)
---
Well thank god haha
---
So you think killers being able to close the hatch wasn't a favorable change for them? Did you enjoy standing at the hatch for an hour or are you too new to remember what that was like?
---
Eh, the whole thing was resolved in a couple hours. No big deal to the majority of people who weren't waiting to play at release. They compensated for the delay by extending the event as a whole.
---
“Parker, you’re fired”
---
“But sir, the update”
---
“Parker; you’re rehired”
---
Change the survivors objective. Survivor is the most boring role in the universe, all you do is sit on a gen while the killer chase's someone. The problem lies with the fact survivors have nothing to do but gens.
---
prolly xp from this morning while it was turned off but was passively getting xp
---
We should get petals more often in the bloodweb... I've gotten none in two level 50 bloodwebs and I really don't fancy playing without anyperks just so I can level up the "easy" levels.
---
They say that’s the case when you look at the info before you buy. I’ll probably do this at a later date as all I want is Ghostface’s outfit.
---
I get so irritated with people like this. Ruin isn't terrible for survivors, it makes things interesting. Harder, maybe,  but still interesting. It's boring to gen rush imo
---
I think you're being disingenuous, respectfully. I don't want to *buy* blight skins, and I'm not burning my pustula petals for the measly 3k bloodpoints per event hook. The point of the event is to earn serum to spend on cosmetics, and without that the event is essentially...theres pumpkins on generators now enjoy. 
---
Like saying that the event is on because "hey guys you're allowed to give us money now!" Is kind of a big middle finger from bhvr to everyone
---
Haven't played for almost a year now so it's possible.
---
They removed ruin and added BBQ.
---
Ah good to know! I will try the different options then and see what works best for me. Thanks for the tip.
---
Soooo if you didnt play then you start where you should have anyway?
---
And if you're loyal to the game and played regardless than you get rewarded? Yeah. Sounds fair

The thing is, the medkit dissapearing is an important clue to counter it for killers. If I see someone running towards a downed survivor with a medkit, and then see them running away without one, I can assume its an instant heal. Same thing if they drop a pallet or use it midchase.
---
So is Halloween 2 no longer canon?
---
Oh no was he afraid of his dad?
---
Oh I’m not mad about the couple hours, that’s a perfectly reasonable fix time.
---
But if you dig through the replies, the community has to wrench and twist details out of BHVR. Without people asking we would’ve been left with just “Rift is disabled ETA unknown”.
---
That combined with the fact it was A N O T H E R delay is just downright comical.
---
Yeah sadly DBD is literally the only good asymmetrical, every other iteration of the genre is absolutely dogshit or not worth even playing for one reason or another

So crazy frog ringtones

If you can only mori them on death hook then why bring a mori at all? Just hook them and kill them
---
Have you been going against Legion?
---
What happened? I didnt look at it in time. But I guess it must been something about bitching bout the fact there is no archives.
---
The back story behind this one is pretty simple.  The dude was pretty toxic.  When it was down to just him and his friend I was able to find the hatch by chance.
---
 So I planned ahead his friend being on their final hook I decided to hook her right next to the hatch knowing it was her final hook she tried to lure me close to the basements that I would Hook her down there so he could escape.
---
 I was smart enough to see this plan in advance hooked her right next to the hatch walked over and as soon as it opened I closed it. He got what he deserved
---
 
---
I am playing on Xbox One X and my fiance is playing on Xbox One S. We got back from vacation a week ago, and ever since we got back Dead by Daylight has basically been unplayable for both of us. We are constantly stuck on "loading profile" and it will take over 5 minutes to get passed this screen. We never had this issue before and we don't understand why it's happening.
---
I have gig internet and am getting the correct download and upload speeds. I've tested multiplayer connection and it says "all is good". I tried uninstalling the game and reinstalling, but no luck. Power cycled the Xbox. Unplugged Xbox and router/modem over night and still no luck.
---
I even contacted behavior support and all I got back was to power cycle my Xbox and when I replied back, I never heard back from them.
---
Is this the power of Ultra Instinct ?
---
Yeah same with keys
---
yeah, if somebody wants to heal inner strenght is superior
---
Yes I understand that. What I am saying is, it needs to show countdown to better time the locker slam rather than waiting for it to light up.

You don't have to build around Ruin, either. People don't mind that it can be destroyed because it gets them more mileage in the long run because survivors going out of their way to search for Ruin are survivors doing *nothing* to work on escaping. Bad totem spawns aren't the fault of the perk, either, just BHVR's neverending incompetence.
---
Thanatophobia is also easily countered by common items like toolboxes or medkits, as well as common perks like We'll Make It. Totem-hunting perks and items are less common, and you'll generally get more use out of, say, Botany Knowledge than Detective's Hunch.
---
Congratulations on managing to completely ignore the second point of the comment about the abysmal state of the video game industry for devs and people being able to see their families, because the second point of the comment is an entire argument itself whether or not you have paid money.
---
That being said, you have not. And don't act like you have. You paid money once to own the game, and have gotten perpetual free updates from it. (yes free, you are not OWED any update to a game beyond bug fixing). You may have also paid money for extra content, in which case what you paid for was THAT CONTENT. And you got that content, and the only thing you are owed beyond that content is bug fixes to that content. Everything else is bonus free content that the devs are providing in order to keep players around for longer. This is not a subscription game, you are not the centre of the universe, get off your high horse, and learn a little compassion.
---
Using the bootlegged version of the mask when you have the rights to the genuine mask is honestly a power move.
---
I’m tier 34. Damn I play this game too much.
---
It's not really as simple as "Here let me download your mp3 file and I'll be down"
---
Ghostface caught on tape and the iridescent king aren’t even that great of addons, they honestly don’t deserve their ultra rare status, especially ghostface caught on tape
---
I think he means that it has a timer before it glows, like stake out or diversions timer so you know when it's going to activate before it does
---
Now only that but I really hate you have to hit so many buttons to activate it. You have to hold right mouse button and hit space which usually takes time for me and it is really hard to do in a chase without getting hit. It would be really nice if you can use it while you run ...
---
I’m sorry what where is this change? Isn’t this a huge buff to killers and mind gaming
---
Can I ask what’s happening in the new update
---
Haha I didn’t even knew did had similar designs
---
A jigsaw head charm would be perfect.
---
thank you
---
Exactly this.
---
They can't do anything different because of how shitty this community is. They tried Pustula Petals as a different objective but people would just fill up their Vials and suicide. 
---
Get your facts straights before complaining. Unfortunately for the time being gens and hooks is the only thing they can do event wise.
---
When it works, it works
---
November 13th

The huntress
---
True, but I kind of just want to spend money on Ghostface before getting the Rift.
---
I love when I play through the whole match feeling bad for this Baby Dweet, give him the hatch, and find out he’s Rank 6
---
Repost.
---
And it's back now!
---
I'm saying you're complaining over a non-issue. If you were getting mori'd every game then maybe, but I don't think there's an increase in Mori during events.
---
Freddy or legion
---
Disagree I think it’s in a perfect spot to where it’s still really strong to tank a free hit. But also not too strong to where the killer can wait out the timer and then down you normally
---
Already did. I like the battle pass concept and I'm glad to see it in Dead By Daylight.
---
You should make some and submit it on the subreddit. You never know, the devs could pick it up.
---
Know*
---
I might, just to see what it’s like. but cosmetic items have always taken a back seat for me. I’m fairly new so I still need to get some perks on everybody
---
I like her but I am not Good at trowing hatchets
---
most cosmetics are garbage and we can't even buy the next one with the AC we earn, while most others you can buy the next one and even have bonus currency. no for me.
---
Give it an animation for clarity (syringe into thigh) and a small 0.25s use time.
---
The add-ons already have a -25/50% charge penalty so just consuming the add-on seems fair.
---
They do. The penalty only takes effect after 15 secconds of being at the hook with no other survivors there.
---
Could probably add debuffs to the Mark mechanic. Things like a brief Oblivious, Hinder, or Blindness would probably be neat.
---
Perhaps one could reduce Cooldown on Night Shroud when downing a marked survivor?
---
Or how about a Marked Hallucination? Or, to refrain from taking too much from Doctor, a Paranoia debuff? (Paranoia randomly activates Survivor Detection perks like Spine Chill, Premonition, Small Game, etc and may randomly cue a jump scare notification)
---
How about an add-on which, when revealed, adds a small percentage of meter onto the survivor? (Like, at most, 5%? That could be inconvenient at times, though...)
---
How about an Ultra Rare which makes Night Shroud unbreakable, but places it on a lengthy timer a la Myers (still broken via attack)?
---
Micheal myers
---
I like legion, he feels like an actual killer who is chasing someone.
---
Ok great thanks
---
Event starts tomorrow I believe that’s why
---
Spirit is perfectly balanced. So are moris
---
Wow that clown skin is epic, something of nightmares
---
Clown looks sick. Hilarious but really well done.
---
So much salt from OP Spirit mains on here yet they are the first to bitch about survivors being “op” - go ahead and kill yourself on first hook. It’s a game. Reddit is toxic in general, but that is exasperated by the killer mains in this subreddit.
---
You have to remember that they were pushed to release it before Halloween so they probably put it off till the last moment trying to fix everything they could beforehand. The decision to release it is probably one guy that knows they need the profits/hype from Halloween. I understand why they did it this way, plus the bitching of the fans telling them to just hurry up and release it didn't help.
---
Ah ok, got it
---
nice mask,
---
generally nice outfit, but yeah, its a good cosplay
---
They gave him underwear, I’m pissed
---
Welcome to the fog!
---
Thought it was just me, been happening for a few days now on here.
---
I'm thinking about it! I love the charms but the survivor cosmetics aren't that great. The killer ones are amazing though
---
they also said they were planning a halloween event
---
As a Clown main, I’m instantly getting that skin
---
It hurts the killer, yes, I agree. But I disagree when you say it only hurts the killer. It hurts a survivor's enjoyment to be out of the game before they were able to rack up more than 10K in points.
---
Also, I've seen a lot of die hard killer mains call Moris BS, so I'm hoping the community can come together and agree on a change to make the game healthier.
---
Too hopeful? Lol
---
There are still two problems with thanatophobia. Firstly, 16% slowdown is roughly 12 additional seconds to complete a gen. Across 5 gens, that's an additional 60 seconds for gen repairs. On paper that sounds...somewhat decent. But you have to find and injury multiple survivors. By the time you injured 3/4 survivors, you're most likely down a gen or two. (Since this was a plague thread, I'm not going to talk about healing cuz survivors generally don't heal against plague in the first place)
---
Secondly, thanatophobia punishes you for playing well. The killer's job to...well kill survivors. As soon as you kill one survivor, than thanatophobia's 16% slowdown is reduced to 12%, and then 8%, ect. At that point, thanatophobia is pretty much a non-perk and you would be much better off running a different slowdown perk
---
I like him too but not When I’m playing survivor I get scared from him.
---
Honestly I just go to the gen at the back of the map, that's upstairs through a window(don't know the name of the area). Balanced Landing opportunity and an important objective, boom.
---
No, you are the cancer of the game. Your comment is evidence of such. Go back to fortnite, sweetheart.
---
Listen here, you little shit.
---
copyrights are a huuuuuge bitch
---
You are talking like I havent paid for the game or the DLCs. The game is no free, the devs are actively updating the game and are receiving money from auric cells and DLC sales. Stop talking like they're updating it out of the goodness of their hearts. Also bhvr doesnt overwork their people that is a known fact.
---
[deleted]
---
Already bought! Super excited it's finally released
---
Even down to earning back the in-game currency.
---
i see feng i upvote
---
If I get enough Tiers then maybe. Not sure how much I am going to play, but it doesn´t really seem to have much stuff that I am really very interested in grinding for.
---
Where does it state that we can't find the next one with the Auric Cells we earn?
---
And the obsession too because she loves him the most XDXDXDXD
---
How would that work like with the gens i mean
---
I did upload it, hopefully it will be showing up soon!

16% adds about 13 seconds to a gen, ruin adds a little more than 20 on average if there’s no great checks. Thana works mid to late game, ruin works early to mid game. Where plague struggles the most is the early game since she has to spend time getting people sick first. A good plague doesn’t need the mid and late game slow since that is where plague is already at her strongest. Early game slow is much better for plague
---
Already did
---
Oof... You can't? That's a bad move from BHVR. The killers cosmetics are great but damn they didn't even try with the survivor ones
---
Myers or ghost face
---
I just can't get behind your reasoning here. First off, the assumption that the killer stands to gain from initiating a chase with healthy survivors baiting him from a safe distance is very questionable. In a situation where the doors are open, starting a chase against a healthy survivor will generally mean getting one hit in (on most killers without instant-downs or NOED). Just running straight for the door will save them and if that's not enough, other survivors can bodyblock. Taking the bait and chasing someone else is asking to trade a somewhat safe 1k for 0k. On the other hand, camping the hook generally means securing that kill (which is good), getting a hook trade (even better points-wise) or getting even more kills if they botch the rescue attempt. *The logical recourse for the killer is to camp a lone survivor after doors are opened.*
---
The survivors are the ones that 1) have the power to end the game right away, or stall, bait and teabag. 2) have an actual meaningful choice to make still.
---
Now it's always possible for the killer to abandon his kill and chase someone to the gates if that's how he wants to play it. But if he's standing by the hook, he's made his choice, and he's not stalling. The survivors are. The ball is in their court, they make a move or they leave, if they fail to do either and bitch about camping, they're being whiny and entitled: nowhere is it written that the killer **has** to fall for their baiting.
---
Yup, didn't want to burn myself out lmao
---
Why can you buy the next one with the ACs?
---
yes but with 4 petrified oaks it can be pretty hard to even get someone on a hook lol
---
It’s unfair to the team, sure, but it is not bullshit to him. He doesn’t want to play against spirit, so he doesn’t. At least he is presumably helping his teammates until his first down.
---
I'm not really sure I understand the point you're trying to make about self care and time to down, if you have a link to your post and it's a whole big content thing I'll read it over
---
But yeah I'm in agreement about growing out of self care, it's just good for a newer player. I run bond for when I need my heals and generally just work on gens injured when it's safe enough, but it's hard to recommend that to a newbie without any perks
---
If you aim the Will-O-Wisp flashlight at a wall or something, the light is orange and has a ghost in it
---
I like myers but I’m not Good at ghostface.
---
i don't like fortnite sis
---
Lmfao!!! Also people are gen rushing like crazy for them points! Can’t wait to see the cry baby post coming out in the next few hours complaining about all the genrushing! It’s what you people wanted because the plants slowed the game down! So don’t complain!

Ngl legion. I always have the most fun in a legion game.
---
So I bought Thana yesterday, does that mean it was taken away?
---
I was literally in the process of uploading the Alchemist's cinematic, but looks like I was beaten to the punch, along with all the other punches.
---
Ghostface by far.
---
i’m personally happy about the wiggle timer bloodpoints. i’ve always found it annoying, now at least there’s a reason to do it especially if i know i’m getting hooked.
---
If steam then check your steam account transations, it may be pending
---
Or, it's actually trying to torture him even more. Like, this cycle of dying and surviving must be pretty stressful, even for Bill. So, the Entity supplies him with an infinite supply of cigarettes, so he can have a smoke and unstress a bit. And with all the stress he's going through, he's gonna smoke A LOT. Except, as we know, smoking is kind of really bad for your lungs and throat.
---
Therefore, not only Bill has to go through the eternal cycle of the Trials like all other Survivors, but he suffers from breathing problems that just get worse and worse over time because he let the Entity manipulate him into smoking extra-unhealthy amounts of cigs.
---
This will probably go on until Bill cannot endure it anymore and, while he's barely able to breath enough to remain conscious, and even that makes him feels like he's just constantly swallowing and puking acid, he will pledge himself to the Entity, just so it can ease his pain in exchange.
---
And this is how The Vet would join the ranks of the Entity's hounds.
---
I like him too, he looks like an actual killer chasing someone.
---
It's a buff if all you do is hold W and don't use your stain to mindgame.
---
If you actually knew how to use it to fake directions around L and T walls, shack and jungle gyms then it was a very good tool, especially against more experienced survivors.
---
Well that sucks.
---
Did you ever see Crowder?
---
Yeah legion is one of my favourite killers. He just feels like an actual killer chasing someone.
---
Unless you take into account that I played both sides, (mostly killer for more BP), and if I only played 3-4 hours each day in those two days, depending on how long each match was, 2-3 can be a lot to someone. 
---
So yeah i'm incorrect in chalking it up to 2 days (48 hours of playtime), but i'd be very interested to see some data compiled over a longer time span playing as just a survivor to see if there's a spike in moris, and then including how many of those matches I was actually moried vs escaped, or they didnt bring one to begin with.
---
[insert complaint about toxic survivors and insta heals]
---
A GF with this skin let me hatch escape yesterday lmao
---
If you are on console tho, you’re screwed, since the consoles don’t really care that much’
---
Yeah, my friend had told me the Survivors sounds had gottent louder, and as a Killer main, I definetely noticed I've been having an easier time tracking down Survivor through their pain grunts at some point.
---
I’m not Good at huntress but love the spirit, I feel like people are actually scared When They play against her.
---
I am on PC on steam and can't even boot the game up
---
Because Fortnite is the only game with a battlepass
---
Huntress, Trapper, and Ghostface
---
They both fill different roles. Discordance let's you know if the survivors are grouping up (and let's you know at minimum where half the team is) and surveillance tells you when a gen you kicked has been since touched. They work quite well for me (I play Billy) but I would assume they would work together with others
---
I’m not Good at huntress and ghostface but trapper is amazing.
---
Either add more time to the gens to be completed, or
---
increase the amount of gens that need to be completed to power the gates.
---
What's wrong with it now? I haven't hopped on yet and now I'm not sure I want to
---
This is good lol
---
Doctor, i like his laugh and the survivors screams
---
I never saw anyone suicide in hundreds of games last year.
---
Aww i love Jane and David’s Banner. It’d be so much nicer if those edgy teens weren’t second away from stabbing them .
---
That Clown skin is fucking horrifying, 10/10.
---
You were lucky then
---
Increase the time to complete a generator. Increasing the amount of generators would make early game go even quicker cause then killers would have to get more gens and waste a lot of time while survivors flew through gens.
---
I'm stealing the "best worst game" thing. That's the best way I've seen to describe this wonderful dumpster fire.
---
Literally every game. Survivors disconnect to keep me from doing my challenges lmao
---
Myers easily makes me scream the most
---
Cool yeah I might do, I’ve already created a song inspired by the clown, I’ll submit it if I can find it, I think it’s on my sound cloud
---
Been waiting for that Clown skin. I'm definitely going to get it. It has this weird "silly yet fucking terrifying" feeling to it.
---
&gt;3 times in 2 days... I get mori'd more than that out of the events that's really not much.
---
Both of you are not considering the number of games played. 3 games played over 2 days? A lot. 75 games played over 2 days? Meh.
---
Than that ain't a legion boy... he a ghostface wannabe
---
i want archives on mobile as well :(

It's a hex homie. It's already balanced.

I think we can all agree that Evan MacMillan can get it.

F for portable users

Yeah, thanks BHVR. That's totally what the Pig needed. Not actual meaningful shit to her power level. No, why spend time coding that when you can spend time coding her to hold a trap on the load screen. Great use of time and resources.
---
bless, thank you.
---
The battle pass actually made me quit fortnite even though I had a good time playing it with friends. Always had the urge to do all the challenges and dailies to obtain all the newest cosmetics. After a while I burnt out and quit the game completely. 
---
Seeing this added to dbd, a game I could always play for a quick round whenever I felt like doing so, makes me a bit sad. 
---
It might be good for the games economy and therefore health (yes devs need to get paid too) but I see myself going crazy and playing the game without having fun again.
---
Mmm I’m not Good at him for me his power is too weak but if your’e Good at him I understand Why he is your favourite killer.
---
His hairstyle, eyes, manly jawline, cute voice, godddddamn. Literally perfect man material.
---
Obviously it hurts the survivor too if they get killed early in the game. I just meant that from a killers perspective it's just not a smart move to be a dick and kill everyone 5 minutes into the game, everyone loses a pip or best case gets a safety pip, including the killer. I honestly don't understand killers that enjoy playing like that.
---
It's hopeful thinking but I wouldn't be mad about a change like this!
---
Why did you remove your post? It was an interesting proposal/idea.
---
Depth is a really good asymmetrical game. Even tho it's not the same kind of universe than DBD, it's amazing.
---
But the game is slowly dying, and not many players are online anymore.
---
I think the best way to fix gen speeds without forcing the game to be longer would be to make gens regress faster. That would add counterplay and make it so kicking gens doesn't feel completely useless.
---
Damn, rip for console players
---
They should only be awarded post match to prevent disConnect Four
---
So is spine chill now able to detect T1 Myers?
---
They just dc on the loading screen
---
pretty sure it always has
---
Legion. The unique ability really fits my play style. Don't have any idea why people cry about them needing a Nerf, delusion all around this community sometimes.
---
I like this content
---
So is the event not gonna last longer than before? Because I legit have been holding off for the event.
---
My post got removed...?
---
I know it's balanced on its own, but there's also a reason it's probably the most popular killer perk. I'm saying perhaps gens need a bit of fine tuning to take longer, and if they were, *then* it would perhaps need to be changed a bit.
---
(Though, with the way totems spawn, maybe not lmao)
---
If anything, I would need to go out of my way to stalk people. It's easier to just start stabbing people than to be immobile and vulnerable to get a down.
---
In the new timeline, only the first movie and the new reboot movie are canon.
---
However, Halloween has 4 timelines if you include the Rob Zombie films (original timeline that includes films 1-6, H20 timeline, new movies and then rob zombie) so it’s kinda just pick which canon you prefer  at this point.
---
me too, and it motivates u to wiggle, even if ur like “nah wont make it” but start late and realize u would have
---
it can be used in small and medium basic loops, and even then good survivors will know to keep running and watch out to see if she stands back up. It's not useless, just really situational compared to other powers.  A good survivor will be able to treat the pig like an m1 killer in a chase without too much effort. The pig is a pretty shit killer and is treated as such for a reason.
---
BHVR deserve it and anyone working for them should just move on and go work for another company's PR department.
---
I could've added all other games too but then you would've had to scroll down quite a lot.. save yourself the hustle..
---
If they added more gens needed, they would literally need to rework every map to compensate. A lot of maps already have gens that can spawn super close together, we can’t make getting 3 genned even easier.
---
Then I'm just dumb haha
---
https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1189590374546726913?s=09
---
I assume that's how they'll work, killers get the quitter bonus after the game. And you get no blood points if you DC so it's extra incentive to stay in the game.
---
It’d be pretty shitty if it does honestly, it’s already a bitch getting out of T1 sometimes, and with spine chill being so common at high ranks to counter spirit, it’d be a significant Myers nerf if it can
---
Incomprehensible!
---
A couple of the catwalks occasionally have some gen spot, I think. The only reason I know this is because I'll sometimes see gens slightly above me in a room. Almost nobody sees them or does them lol.
---
I love legion too he is just great and feels like an actual killer who js chasing someone. I don’t think he needs a nerf if you know How to handle him as a survivor you can play against him.
---
I think myers is supposed to counter all detection perks, so probably not
---
Because your favorite YouTuber (who’s really a Plague main himself) says so.
---
I think it was a bug I refreshed just as you were editing I think. My bad
---
No need to comment on something this dumb either
---
how do I get the serum?
---
Oh come on
---
Dont blame this on the community.
---
BHVR is fucking lazy. What exactly took them so long to recycle that old summer event? 
---
The problem I am having is, that even right now at the best time possible in the year to play this game, BHVR doesnt give a fuck to say thank you to the community that this game is still alive and not as dead as death garden.
---
Exactly. Every killer is playable if you know how to, I wouldn't necessarily call any killer unviable atm.
---
So it’s not necessarily a buff or a nerf. Interesting, i wonder which killers this might help and how this will effect things
---
Dont use pop in those scenarios.  
---
That's it really, unless you are pretty certain they're going to come right back to it and it's going to finish in like 10 seconds of work, go run your T3 out.   
---
Either you pop T3 and down someone right next to the gen, in which case you've still got time after, or you pop them away from a gen and you can run to it and scare people off, then pop afterward. Level 3 Pop has a 60 second timer. You can do pretty much all of your T3 and still have a little left over.  
---
Pop is nice in those late game 3 gen situations, but the urge to constantly use every stack can be quite detrimental. Pressure wins you games with Myers, he's very snowbally.
---
The event itself is going to end the 13th instead of the 1st. The rift as a whole closes in 69 days
---
BBQ AND CHILLI
---
what a great day. Got ruin from my saved shards earlier and Im gonna grind for that bbq
---
Ironic.
---
There's a reason they don't let you adjust music volume in this game. The sound balance is a part of the game balance, particularly for killers. 
---
If they just let people do whatever song they want, there's going to be specific songs that are better for listening in a Chase.
---
straight up i am willing to do anything to get bhvr to do some map balance. it is sorely needed just in general
---
Through the Rift by completing challenges inside the Tome and earning XP in matches.
---
You mean the post you made an hour ago?
---
To play: Plague
---
To play against: Billy
---
First off, it’s a glitch. Second off, clean your room
---
I had an MSI that I bought for around a thousand that lasted me a while, and I was able to run dbd, smite, R6, things like that on it. I'd just look up MSI gaming laptop and try shopping around those.
---
You know where he is at any time. That’s hardly powerless.
---
Ruin is already inconsistent as fuck but overall it probably is the best early generator slow down perk in the game, higher up there is no way it survives more than 2 generators unless the survivors are god-like and get 3+ gens.
---
There was an idea floating around this sub about instead of making it a hex, make it a perk that lasts about the same as Corrupt Intervention does now, the only problem would be that Corrupt Intervention, which is already being used instead of Ruin for some people, might fall out of favour, so I'd suggest this:
---
Make Ruin a perk that lasts 2 minutes at the start of the game, that should be ample time for Killers to start to apply pressure.
---
Make Corrupt Intervention last 2.5-3 minutes instead of 2 minutes currently. While this perk allows Killers to roam easier at the start of the game, if it goes head to head with Ruin, Ruin will probably win out most of the time, so it'd need a buff to be able to challenge Ruin *at least*.
---
That'd be two things that might help balance ruin and give it real competition for gen slow down early on.
---
the thing about "just make them harder to find" is that by making them more selective in places to spawn, it narrows the places it could be and thus making it easier to find for experienced players. 
---
For example, if it only ever spawned in the little alcoves that need to be entered to cleanse like on preschool or the temple map it means just check those for ruin
---
Nice lol
---
I can’t remember if it does or not because there was a Myers I played against that ran M&amp;A and scared the shit out of me when he was in T1
---
The point of a "free" track is to convince you to pay for the paid track. It's free sure, but it's there to get you to spend money.
---
It's pretty easy to run jungle gyms safely even without the bonus distance from an unhidden stain.
---
Can they add ANY new chase music? For fucks sake, it’s been three years with two for killers and two for survivors, and the demogorgon. I’m 100000% sure bhvr can do more than 5 pieces in three years.
---
Trapper. Strategy, mind games, the satisfaction of a loop / chase being cut short by a loud snap and a scream.
---
Just wish they gave him a better, up to date mori... Much as I like standing on your back and hacking wildly.
---
I laughed SO hard because this is actually me. That place has me confused as survivor and killer lol.
---
Honestly, after going through the grind of leveling him up, he’s one of my favorite killers. The insta Downs are a gamble, and I enjoy trying my luck/skill against the survivors
---
It's on, idk why everyone os crying so much, It was down for like 1 hour and no one losed anything
---
Good change
---
Dont listen to him, theres literally nothing stating you cant, lol
---
Yeah, it hooks you by **giving you free content**
---
Is there some kind of shitty inside joke I'm not getting here?
---
Disappointed. The in game content is super lame. Last years pustual pedals was much better.
---
Why would anyone think they would do this? I am not even slightly interested in someone's fan-made music playing in the game..
---
WTF, in my shrine there is bbq, haunted grounds, detective's hunch and empathy
---
It's actually overrated on plague. You don't heal against her so the penalty to healing doesn't matter. You're only going to get the penalty to doing gens and that still isn't very strong
---
Take a pic of your level and send a report to the devs
---
I would send that issue to bhr support...
---
Who is that sitting next to Mikey?
---
Just for clarification: can you complete ALL challenges in the first tome before completing the epilogue?
---
How big is the update on PS4?

Because of how hook event scoring works. A mori just counts as an automatic kill in the same way hooking someone for the 3rd time gives you the points. Hooking people goes towards points towards your emblems, which is what you'll never get if you just get 4 hooks in the whole match which is where your depip comes from. It's also extremely unfun for the survivors. They wait sometimes up to 15 minutes to get into a match you plan on ending in 3 minutes. That shit ain't fun at all. Campfire simulator sucks.
---
Glad i took dance with me.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dpar4r/anyone_think_there_will_ever_be_crossplay/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Plague is decent but I’m not the biggest fan of her.
---
Freddy boi! Actually I’m sorry wraith has always been my og love. But Freddy is tied
---
Chase music honestly annoys me as a killer. It’s so loud and I can’t really hear if their allies are right behind or what. I get why it is there but dang.
---
Mods are still human and can't monitor the reddit 24/7 which means stuff will slip through, you can always report stuff for unrelated content so they can check it.
---
repost..
---
Unfortunately yeah, Spine Chill will detect Tier 1 Myers. As much as I love Spine Chill, I wish my build of Myers with Monitor and Abuse now gets nerfed because it's detectable. Even though he's given an "undetectable" status.
---
If a perk is mandatory but the killer is punished too much for not running it atleast a form of that perk should be baseline
---
So yeah, remove/ rework ruin and just make gens take more time baseline
---
A nice rework for ruin could be something like making it a direct counter to toolboxes only instead of being the best perk for every killer
---
PS4 user here, no crash so far (5th game since update).
---
If it glows you go
---
Don’t know why you’d think that. Whenever you earn the Auric Cells in the Rift they literally get added to the balance on your account.
---
You get the Words out of my mouth. He is a great killer but his mori is just borring.
---
You really nerd patience within your hatchets, like with Billy if the survivor are juking
---
Rant
---
I has started a few hours ago
---
Can you complete ALL challenges of a tome or are other paths locked if you decide to follow one?
---
Upstairs is just a story older players tell younger players. I've run around long enough to firmly be sure there's no such thing. It's like believing in the tooth fairy or a Meg without sprint burst
---
No I’m just a failure at life
---
Both. I got two on one web as killer and then none the next so I guess it buffed out. My survivor got 3 after a few bloodwebs.
---
A lot of ppl use them because they are cool
---
That's what I was going for too.
---
There’s an end screen bug and it’s even better https://i.imgur.com/4n0OOdW.jpg
---
No, you get the serums in the battle pass. The event is just a bp bonus now.
---
A history lol its cool
---
Eh not really, it's not like they were that bad to begin with
---
Yeah, I just started learning Huntress and she has a really high skill floor. More than any other killer. It's rough but I'm slowly getting better
---
This *really* makes me want to do a full Trapper cosplay when I get the money.
---
How long will it last for?
---
Still no bonus BP when you're getting tunelled, meh, maybe later.
---
I like wraith but I’m not great with Freddy. I cant play with him without getting bullied by survivors.
---
What does his power do?
---
13th November :)
---
Epico
---
That doesnt make sense, killer doesnt get bp when gen rushed
---
13th November
---
I'm fairly certain that the main difference between the two is that TF2's community items are paid cosmetics that can be paid for via keys and item sales, and maps can have map stamps purchased for directly supporting the creators. BHVR has never done such a thing with community content, and you obviously would probably not be purchasing the chase music for a killer you already own. Legality is a big annoying issue, one of the reasons we can't have Hello Zepp as chase music for the Pig is because the composer owns the piece. The reason we can't have Jason or Scream characters is because of rights holders, etc.
---
That is unfortunate, spine chill is now a massive counter to Myers, and a nerf is the last thing he needed right now
---
Mine is still up?
---
Demogorgon :D
---
Why is there too lag in the dedicated servers? :(
---
Talk about daddy issues...
---
Yeah I guess I should just play with her more but I just dont want to rage When I miss hatchets the whole game.
---
just as a PSA, the artist does not want people reposting her art without permission.
---
Yeah I’m out of the loop.
---
Because it would be funny
---
Thanks for you’re reply, really helpful, it’s only the cross play with consoles that I really want. I agree pc and console cross play would be incredibly unfair.
---
I totally disagree with both of you, I know "The Game" like the back of my hand, but The Lab is still a maze to me.
---
If they don’t have crossplay/ backwards compatibility for next gen consoles it could kill pop counts.
---
Pantsless Myers
---
Working fine for me :/
---
The update came out?
---
Okay thank you for the clarification! Sorry if I seemed like a know it all trying to explain what turned out to be wrong. That’s good at least it’s in the free pass.
---
And tbh I feel like that’ll make the whole event less toxic, because with previous events people would sabo special hooks or killers would camp special gens. And for Halloween survivors would grab their serum and just die to get into the next match quicker. 
---
So getting the vials for simply playing is definitely better in most cases
---
Probably an issue with your internet, friend :/
---
Yeah, it's based on how much you played based on their server data for the last week or two, ie your xp from the last few days counts towards it
---
Bold of you to assume she wasn’t stalking you for that one hit
---
Nah, you can finish all of them.
---
This is a video in response to a thread from the meme ‘It was never my strong suit’ by u/NastySmeagolMain (sorry if spelled wrong will correct) so go check that out.
---
This could have been 40 seconds shorter but I commend your efforts. Good throw!
---
I didn’t think of that but yeah good point.
---
Detectives hunch was literally the last perk i needed to complete my feng min
---
In general, I wait and see how many levels I get in battle passes and then if I feel like I've gotten high enough to be worth the rewards, *then* I'll buy it. We'll see how much DBD I play in the next two months, then I'll decide whether I'm going to buy it lol
---
I have no idea and LMAO love this community getting downvotes from people who quit. Obviously.
---
Damn I need to get BBQ
---
It will help those who just hold W and don't really try anything interesting.
---
I doubt there will be any specific killer advantages.
---
If it’s not that’s why your downvoted they said once they fully are here dc will get punished
---
That wasn't a baby dweet... That was a Dwight Supremacist.
---
Tis all good, it's kind of confusing that they are separating the event reward from the event lol.
---
No, he got hit few times.
---
I'm happy the women in the background called the Police.
---
Oh. That’s surprisingly nice.
---
Oh my gosh!  Your goth Plague should be a thing!  I'd totally get the cosmetic and it's giving me MAJOR Morticia Addams vibes!
---
Gonna level with you here man. Your a killer. Your one goal is to hook and kill all 4 of them. Truth be told, a lot of survivors are toxic and complain. If you have one on the hook, the doors open, and one hanging around, ild wait by the hook. Why give up one of your confirmed kills just to let them get out? That’s just me though. I avoid camping and tunneling as much as I can, but once that last gen pops, and I have you on the hook? Yea, I’m not running around. It’s a great way to catch those survivors who are way to eager to rush to their death for some extra points.
---
Keys are nowhere near as powerful as mori's
---
Do it! It's fun.
---
No, it's really not. If you knew how to use your stain to bait people into thinking you were switching directions on jungle gyms, shack and L&amp;T walls then this change hurts you as you can't do that anymore.
---
It only benefits you if you just hold W and don't try to mindgame.
---
So don't use it and STFU rofl
---
I’ve not seen anyone say that her lunge is useless
---
This is a very very good thing. The red stain should never go through walls, destroys mindgames and nerfs killers because they dont know when the game is going to decide to glitch out and get cheaply outplayed because the survivor is on low settings
---
OMG
---
He was in a serious situation and panicked, not everyone can react with a clear mind.
---
It now gives the survivors a small mindgame, though (although there's still a window of 8 seconds that the killer's "safe")
---
If a survivor uses their medkit mid chase, they either have endurance (meaning you shouldn't hit them for 8 seconds) or they're healing in 16 seconds (meaning you SHOULD hit them in the next 16 seconds)
---
It's an interesting change + I can see some ballsy plays of using a syringe in the killer's face to make them think it's a styptic, they avoid hitting you, giving you a window or an extra loops or something, + then you hope to survive the 8 seconds afterwards.
---
It's not rocket science what could you possibly not understand?
---
I remember when endgame collapse and closing the hatch when introduced some survivors started losing their shit thinking it would kill the game.
---
I got my first 4K last night with the pig
---
nah, every gamer and/or developer understands there will inevitably be Production environment bugs. The discourse is amplified because it's been a shitshow of unpredictable bugs in the lower environments leading up to this for weeks. Take the burn. Re-earn the trust.
---
It's rng bullshit but that's basically what this game is based on
---
No bloodhunt was ever announced for this event.
---
Doctor is better than Legion, Legion is just edgey emo teenagers, not like a real killer chasing anybody at all.
---
\_Looks around wondering where the fuck is the killer since I forgot my key\_

Wait really?
---
[Insert entitled killer / survivor post]
---
It works fine for me....
---
Tomorrow at 11am until Monday 11am.
---
i hate to tell you bud but everything you just said doesnt mean anything
---
You see, I am the one that’s always tricked lol. 🤣
---
Wrong, you could see when the killer moonwalked because the stain went through the wall even if they werent looking at the wall because its huge
---
It's been like this since last patch homie
---
she's got trust issues, mayne. Missed skillchecks kill.
---
There definitely was a blood hunt planned. I dont remember the exact date they confirmed it for but everything got fucky with the delay of the mid chapter
---
Yes you do? Your stain still shows around corners
---
Oh yeah, that's totally the issue
---
should i risk it? i need that perk so badly😱 but i'm also scared to waste shards....
---
For me legion is better.
---
Look at the shrine currently, bbq Is apparently in it for just irredesent shards, which you can grind out for free
---
I do and watch videos too
---
Wtf are you talking about? This has always been how it should have been, this doesnt have anything to do with moonwalking, in fact the light going through walls fucks over mind gamers
---
Don’t listen to them.  Play how you want.  Have fun and don’t feel bad.  I recommend playing both sides so you understand both perspectives.  If gates are open all bets are off.  You can try to hook trade for more points. (Down the person unhooking and let the unhooked person run away)
---
Once you understand the game better you can try explaining why it worked out that way.  For now either ignore or reply “gg” “gg sry”. “Gg sry I’m new”.
---
Their Replies will likely be more non sense.
---
I'd rather not play as a literal Nazi. This is despicable and in poor taste.
---
Well, if it was a rule that Hex Totems cannot spawn near gens, that would make Ruin much easier to find: If there's a gen nearby, you know it's definitely not in the area.
---
I was playing with my friend and she have got the same..
---
we are from Spain.
---
And yet it meant enough for a near-instant reply from you.  
---
Enjoy.
---
Sorry, a lot of people wanted to see it and tbh I thought it was only :29 when I uploaded, but it was the longer version.
---
I personally have yet to encounter a reworked Freddy. But.it.is.surprising he's making a comeback.
---
The ps4 playerbase has always been low tbh. That seems pretty standard.
---
You're not being forced to buy the pass
---
This is what I got.  I needed ruin...
---
False alarm, its just an ivory one.
---
Don't say that, I'm just very confused by the post, I just don't get the reference or joke
---
Perhaps
---
&gt;destroys mindgames
---
You could use this TO MINDGAME. If you moved your stain correctly you could make people think you were going in one direction and push them into you. It was very useful at L&amp;T walls, shack and jungle gyms. It's like the basics of moonwalking.
---
&gt;nerfs killers because they dont know when the game is going to decide to glitch out and get cheaply outplayed because the survivor is on low settings
---
It wasn't random, it worked every time and you could rely on it.
---
All I have to say is that pre-rework Freddy I did not like at all, but post-rework Freddy I like playing against
---
I expected spirit tbh but freddy seems about right
---
What’s happening? Did they accidentally release a new Shrine?
---
Impossible to play on ps4. The frame drop is HUGE. If I press run, I walk. Its stupid...
---
I love the game and the devs.  I’m glad to help support them and the support of the game.
---
This is both adorable and accurate!
---
Maybe not alone, but multiple keys can be. They can also be equally as annoying to deal with
---
WHERE'S MY GHOST FACE OUTFIT?!
---
Just wait. Same thing happened. They came back after k restarted game
---
I've been playing before devotion was added. I'm almost devotion 2
---
Alright them, WHERE THE F*** IS THE GENERATOR
---
That girl in the background really didnt want her 25 cent phonecall to go to waste lmao 😂
---
Go for it. The worst they can do is take it away from you and refund you shards, then you buy something else. IMO they will just let you have it if you buy it now, it´s not gamebreaking or anything.
---
When you dont get any archives (switch)
---
You collect serum through the battle pass. Offering the petals is strictly for bonus bp.
---
Honestly I have no idea, but it's either camera turn or delay I think, I don't really know how to fix it other than not lunging, which isn't really a fix. Time to hope it gets fixed soon.
---
You know you don't have to aggressively grind a battle pass system just because it exists, right? Like you can just continue playing the game like normal and nothing bad will happen to you
---
I like the battlepass. Especially since it gives you auric cells back if you play enough
---
 it'll probably be hot fixed
---
Then uh. Play killer
---
At first i thought you were a midget due to the raincoat
---
Lmao
---
I don't need any reason at all to dose anyone.
---
Same. I DCd for no reason.
---
That makes a bit more sense, although I have no idea what the fornite battle pass is.
---
On PC, just had people Dead Hard me in multiple matches, working totally fine.
---
Hmm. There's nothing in the patch notes about them.
---
Yeah fuck BHVR for implementing a way to purchase cosmetics so they can make money to keep the game alive and thriving. Christ you sound dumb. Also there's a cap for it because when there wasn't people would use a glitch/exploit to get millions of bloodpoints without doing shit to earn them, leading to quick prestjging with no effort. Inform yourself before you bitch.
---
Who remembers when games were 200 megabytes and weren’t supported for several years?
---
I would get it, they wouldn’t screw you over and remove the perk from your teachable set. They would just reset the shrine.
---
don’t get 360’d then scrub git gud /s
---
but nah i’ve felt the same thing on xbox. auto aim fucks me once a game if the survivors are trying to 360
---
Sure. Just make sure you nerf keys to only work for the last survivor after the hatch has been shut.
---
c’mon, i’d put my girl plague at the top. besides her vomit, she’s a cutie.
---
dude, hiding the red light WAS the mindgame
---
wtf are you even talking about?
---
Still testing on PC.
---
That is a much more ridiculous comparison, and if you can't see the connection that I made, that sounds like a personal problem. Yes, it is a bit dramatic, but not so much as to completely discredit the argument. There is some truth there, and if you want to deny that it only strengthens my belief in the argument.
---
Monetization &gt; bugfix.  Even more important than dedicated servers., which were important enough to make it a major marketing point last Christmas.  They gotta fund their absolute failure of the game deathgarden somehow, and they will use your wallet to do so.
---
(Insert comment bitching about the devs)
---
Battlepass is just SKINS, you still have the whole mechanical game, no one is stronger than you
---
Anyone else getting an archives error when selecting a challenge?
---
As a Pig main I gotta shout her out. She's a lot of fun and is fulfilling to learn and get good with, but there's no denying that after his rework Freddy is a really strong killer.
---
A tier but I still feel he is underrated or ignored by a lot of the community.  He pairs well with multiple meta perks (pop/make your choice to name a few).  He can fly to ends of the map and is great in chase with bloodpools and fake pallets.
---
[https://soundcloud.com/maia-allen-828307215/curtaincallclown](https://soundcloud.com/maia-allen-828307215/curtaincallclown) here is the track if you want to listen
---
It got reset with the patch
---
No he's right, this is cool don't get me wrong but pig needs a legitimate buff
---
I’m pretty sure David and Jane could handle them
---
you made him look great. gg
---
Also PC, 10 min queue as survivor (rank 6) + every lobby have the 3 man bug
---
Yeah I figured it all out. It's kinda disappointing but still doable.
---
That looks great! You should totally do other survivors as well *cough* Steve *cough*
---
Trapper and Susie are definitely at the top
---
I heard it'll be shards only and limited time.
---
Ah okay. Hopefully thats the case.
---
Look forward to the 2 weeks where I can't play the killer I've been playing the most recently without breaking the game.
---
I know.
---
Thats why im saying i hope they keep bbq in there because you are able to buy it with iri shards. Without this limited time offer though, there is no buying bbq without spending real money. Whereas with Hag, you are always able to unlock ruin without spending money. Regardless of whether or not its in the sheine
---
i still havent gotten a game at hawkins
---
WHY IS IT WHENEVER I PLAY EITHER MYERS OR GHOSTFACE I _ONLY_ GET CORN MAPS.
---
SERIOUSLY. WHAT THE FUCK.
---
Balls Im was looking forward to Thana 😂
---
Hag is so cute though!!
---
Demogorgon s tier change my mind
---
Why am I being downvoted?
---
I had 9 swings miss yesterday in a SINGLE match due to autoaim deciding the pallet to my right was more important to hit than the survivor I was literally ass to ass with.
---
Predatory monetization is the #1 priority for games today.  A fool and his money are soon parted.
---
Nice! Do you play killer often or not?
---
Hahaha, we’ll see. I don’t have Steve yet but his and Nancy’s perks look good so I might have to get them
---
welcome to dbd events
---
No they're not
---
I don't know why they are focusing on that game, they should have never made it and focused on this IP DBD, Ik this game can become bigger
---
I just don’t like in game purchaseable currency at all. I don’t like loot boxes or that kind of shit either. I prefer a battle pass where I can pay X amount to support the game while also getting cool stuff as I play. I’m not against the company making money on their game. I just don’t want to pay what sometimes amounts to ridiculous prices for a single outfit. Some companies are really egregious about it. I’m looking at you Bethesda.
---
How long have you been playing the game for?
---
What event?
---
I saw this change. I don't get it though. Does it mean the 3 of them are swf?
---
Ahh, the ole Donald Trump method.  Classic.
---
I main Bill so that I can't be guilt tripped into buying cosmetics.
---
1k each from what i tested today
---
The people making balance changes and deciding on those changes are not the people doing models/animations/etc.
---
see, everyone says that, but a good survivor runs from the loop if she uses it, they don't try to play it. if you just run you win every time.
---
It depends on if you’re solo or playing with friends, how garbage the matchmaker is being, how good you are, how potato your teammates are...
---
It’s basically a crapshoot. I don’t focus my fun on escaping specifically. Sometimes I will try to do something else like be Captain Save Everyone and run a super altruistic build and try to get lots of sneaky unhooks or whatever.
---
But r/dbdgonewild will so don't you worry!
---
Oh fuck me, I have two hours until I get home and I really really want BBQ. Just leveled up hag last week to unlock ruin. Don't feel like paying $10 to get one perk. God I hope they don't fix it in the next couple hours at least.
---
Welcome to the dbd community
---
Have you not seen Haddonfield.
---
The PS4 player base is not low at all. It’s just that on PS4 lobbies take a long time for survivor because there is a lack of killers to create lobbies.
---
Trapper he's fun and people don't complain if they lose (sometimes)
---
"tryhards" 
---
Sorry that a role which makes a player to be as tryhard as possible against good survivors makes you offended, make sure you reported him for trying to win and posted a clip where he kills you so everyone can shame him for being bad. Don't forget to add bruh sounds effects every time he hits anybody
---
I've been here for awhile but they could give it a day
---
I really enjoy Hawkins on both sides. I don't understand peoples problem with it.
---
Hey,
---
I play Spirit. Similar rank, been having same issue but with survivors. All hiding, doing gens only. Find one dude, everyone else hides and lets them go to stage2 hook. Some advice, most killers during events are just trying to get BBQ stacks. If someone else is getting hooked, make yourself available for a chase / hook / into save.
---
Sometimes ya gonna get sweat shitters that do choose to tunnel, just realize that there is likely a reason something like that is going on. Takes two to tango.
---
If I have to choose between various micro transaction schemes I will always pick the battle pass if the rewards are good. I don’t mind supporting the game, and I don’t want all the DLC anyway.
---
I come from years of Rainbow Six Siege, and I'm a console player, so I know all about toxicity.  Thanks though for the advice
---
XDDDD BASED AND REDPILLED!! Lemme go and buy some more auric cells to buy that cool new Nea ninja cosmetic :&gt;
---
Third Seal IMO is one of the more underrated perks when used correctly. On a slug build it's pretty insanely good, just not many killers can use it that well. Third Seal Nurse is absolutely terrifying
---
Same, I have two hours until I can get home from work so I really hope they don't fix it before then.
---
Laurie got Wolf in Sheep's Clothing and auric cells only 1080 with 10% discount(each piece worth 400). Michael got Escaped patient, also auric only but only 810 with 10%. Didnt get a new mask. The robe is 500 and the knife is 400(the knife he used as 6yr old kid). Weapons as big ass screw driver and a pipe with 400 each. They come separately.
---
So do the patch?
---
I'm sorry you're being down voted for telling the truth, the BHVR bootlickers are out in full force today.
---
No. We don't need more m1 simulator. They should add other objectives that aren't just gens.
---
Great idea! Only there isn’t an option for it so I’m hella confused.
---
I will farm the heck out of that hook if I’m farming. He may be devotion 2 but I’m devotion 7 and I still want them sweet BPs. I’ll make sure he’s dead so he can move on the the next game even quicker #sorrynotsorry
---
I think it might be telling you that a patch is required...
---
And it's not even difficult. The code for holding a trap already existed within the trapper and the model already existed. Guaranteed it took less than a day of code to implement this. It's mostly copy and paste.
---
Battlepass is much cheaper than any other in games like Apex, Dota or Fortnight, so I'm fine with it. Upcoming skins are also awesome
---
Turn your console off and on again and it should be in your updates list
---
You should do a Steve the hair Harrington drawing
---
I have barely had any lobbies dodged since two rank resets ago
---
Counters to tombstone, as a survivor main:
---
- His left hand will be open when he reaches T3, telling you he has it. It does NOT open when he has the tombstone piece, OR if he has PWYF stacked up. If you've noticed him being really determined to stalk and/or it's been a long match without him hitting T3, keep an eye on his hand when he hits it.
---
- His T3 only lasts 60 seconds, you can run him round for that long. It also lowers his movement speed, making this easier. He might try to 99 + then pop it right next to you, but you should be hyper aware of that if he's not gone T3 all game + seems hesitant to lunge at you.
---
- It doesn't work on lunges (only short range quick attacks) so force him to lunge by taking windows + dropping pallets early. Better to be downed than dead.
---
- You can jump in a locker + force him to pull you out, meaning you don't get tombstoned. Again, better downed than dead.
---
- Hilariously you can also do the same on a generator. If you find a "fresh" one, it takes 80 seconds to complete so he HAS to stab you or grab you off of it since his T3 will run out anyway. Worst case if he has tuft or it's not a "fresh" generator, and he's REALLY determined to kill you, he'll waste time watching you complete your objective, and you'll get an extra gen done. Lovely.
---
- If he also takes Tuft, it takes a LONG time to charge up. A LONG time. You should be able to pop out at least 4 gens before he's done, especially since he'll be focused on the SUCC and not on chases (so no need to heal/go for saves, and his movement speed is decreased pretty massively whilst he stalks). And by that point, you can finish the last generator right in his face. If you've got Adrenaline, most of the time you can sweep right past him, keep in mind he's got slow movement speed.
---
Basically by forcing him to down you instead of letting him one shot you, you're basically forcing his ultra rare add on to do nothing but make him stalk + walk slower.
---
Imagine the lucky people who got Ruin and BBQ in one day? I'd go out and buy a lotto ticket if I were them
---
1. Taken out of context: you didnt finish my sentence, kind of invalidates your point right there
---
2. I never said they werent making money and I never said they couldn't do better, I just said the community is beyond toxic here, especially since they held it back specifically to make it more enjoyable. The response to the hold back is a little ridiculous, I mean god forbid they hold it another week or two because they want to get rid of some of the bigger issues they found.
---
Also drawing looks great
---
I main him cuz growing up, left for dead was one of my favorite games
---
Not gonna lie that's how I feel when walking to a trapped survivor
---
Depends on rank/playing with friends/luck.   You seemed to be currently cursed with the "Found First" bug.  The killer seems to walk directly to you in the first 20 seconds of the match and your game is effectively over.  That type of unluckiness can take a while to shake.   Make sure you aren't doing any of the super obvious stuff, like immediately starting a gen, running around making noise.
---
Halloween event is up.
---
Try refreshing it, it's because you dont have today's patch
---
I get that all I'm saying is that he's right in the regard that pig needs a buff
---
Link to it [https://ibb.co/Ln4KFQS](https://ibb.co/Ln4KFQS)
---
Being stalked by ghostface then as soon as you become exposed, trap music starts playing
---
You will always have a spring of good/bad killers. Your team is the other half. If your team sucks then the whole game will go bad. I will win 3/4 games in a row and then lose 6/8 games in a row. Just depends on what killer/survivor I choose. There’s maps where I like to use certain perks but get unlucky and play that map with someone else. All in all it’s just about luck on who you play with, who you go against, perks etc
---
13 games now. Fuck this game.
---
Um Susie and Joey are adorable 😤
---
This post just reeks of survivor main who has never played killer before
---
ET looks like drying pepperoni change my mind
---
Jesus Christ did you come straight from 4chans crusty asscheeks?
---
You shouldn't have even left sight of the hook, should have just stood there and  camped him because as you knew exactly what could happen did. All kinds of camping are fair game when the gates are powered, not just open. There is literally nothing else for the killer to do after the gates are powered other than trying to secure a kill or more.
---
Hollowed blight? I don’t really follow the news stuff that much
---
Sad
---
Eh, don't meet salt with salt. I getcha dude, I play both sides. If he is just wanting to QQ post, let em', otherwise if you had advice to live symbiotically with less salt that we can all enjoy the event, then add it :).
---
I believe they had it back up in half an hour
---
I need to try it but I think it's fine. For example, if a killer blocks a generator intentionally so the survivors can't get progress for the event, they're only losing bp, as they'll still get serum from the battle pass progression. It also goes for killers, if survivors are screwing with hooks so you can't get them to an event hook. I think it'll be fine
---
Sounds like the exact opposite of toxic to me
---
That's exactly why I was wondering why the hell every survivor was burning their instaheals before the new update. Styptic Agent is gonna be pretty good now, and the syringe isn't terrible either lmao.
---
Not sure how having a free pass available is predatory but okay
---
uh i have a completely different shrine than this
---
Ghostface?
---
If the fan agrees to be nice and not suddenly be a huge bitch and file a lawsuit or whatever against the game. You're not even sure if the music the fan makes is 100% original by them or if they have assets from somewhere else. Not to mention they are still entitled to whatever comes along with having your creation bought out. They don't just get sent a cheque and call it a deal.
---
Yeah, the new Archive is up, rift, and event. So bunch of stuff went live today.
---
Elafun isn’t looking too good nowadays.
---
locker
---
Its already on console
---
I understand that thinking but in that situation you'd be hurting your score with safe unhooks lol
---
For sure. Half the time I don't even remember to look for auras with bbq im just running it to get my 2x points.
---
TBH there's no reason to farm right now. When the x2 bloodpoint event starts I'm gonna be farming, but the event hooks and gens are chump change currently.
---
Me seeing this news: "Oh boy, I can't wait to play on Switch and buy the battle pass!"
---
You gain Serum through the rift not gens, special gens reward 1000 bloodpoints.
---
Between the incompetent people that play this game and unlucky try hard that DC after one down, how do you think we can just stop complaining?
---
That’s pretty cool
---
Okay thanks must be on my end somehow. I'll just reinstall
---
Lmao they delay the event by like a full week and a half and they still can't even create a product with no major bugs. I'm starting to think the programmers for this game are straight up untalented.
---
In what way could this possibly be toxic?
---
Yeah, I have played both about evenly.  I have been straight up "stare me in the eyes" camped a couple of times, ruining any kind of fun, which is why I don't do it...thanks for the advice
---
I'm going to guess you don't like DbD.
---
Why are you here?
---
I unironically stopped playing a week ago because of how frustrating this game has become, especially cause at red ranks 2/3 matches are against that broken ass killer, everybody seems so sweaty about getting ez kills nowadays that they apparently only feel gratified when playing spirit; with a decent swf is still manageable (that's cause swf is a broken thing by definition, 3rd party surv communication was never actually meant to exist in asymetrical games like dbd but whtvr this is another story) but on solo (which is how i play surv) most of the games are unplayable. Either it's her (and eventually with a prayer bead as a cherry on top) or it's another killer but with an ebony and top add-ons.
---
No one:
---
Literally no one:
---
You: unplugs ethernet cable to lobby dodge
---
Why not use ctrl+Alt+Del? And yes, I do get this, rarely.
---
Wow a picture of a guy running and a still of the joker running......fascinating!!! lol!
---
its pretty good actually, and not expensive. one $10 payment can last you for life, because you can make the 1000 cells back by doing the challenges
---
yeah, thats what i thought, i mostly play survivor (not to say all of the time) and just now started playing killer for the challenges and such.  
---
I just had a match where i killed 3 survivors, they couldnt do a thing, last one was on his last hook and so i decided to let him do a gen (as i said in the post, he let me kick it from time to time), then when that gen was done, i found the hatch for him and guided him to the escape.  
---
Thing is, one of the survivors that got killed started saying this was toxic and bannable, wanted to see what other people thought
---
11am EST I think as per the twitter, so you good my man. Please someone correct me if I’m wrong
---
I’ll take the small hit to gain more BPs throughout the match.
---
I've gotten 5 so far.
---
My first try at a DbD costume ever. Have mercy :)
---
lol. I don't know how long it would take to get desensitized to the whole being killed thing, but I've played thousands of trails as David King. That's not to mention that he couldn't be mithered in the first place.  
---
I'd be more concerned with what the killer would think. Imagine you're the pig. You hear footsteps, follow the scratch marks, round the corner ... and there stands a Shirtless David King covered in dangle keychain miniatures of *you*. It's like ... am I a joke to you.
---
A clown main? :o I love going against him, love you
---
Always happy to see someone cosplaying best killer!
---
It’s only toxic if you guide the survivor to the hatch and then kill them in front of it or close it in front of them. Intentionally delaying killing them just for the sake of being petty.
---
But you might as well not grab them at all instead of hurting your score with it
---
Beautiful
---
Yeah spank me doctor
---
Yummy yummy repost time
---
It's an ok map. Some killers are good on it some are bad. Just gotta learn the map
---
I got mori'd 3 times in a row yesterday. Stop whining.
---
It's accurate to what FunWorld sells in halloween shops, yes. Not necessarily what's in the movies.
---
I think his portals are fine. They take a decent amount of time to close and injuring them isn’t fair. Closing them is a counter to his portals. Don’t want them closed? Then teleport and stop it from happening
---
Aaaaaah, makes sense now.
---
It’s actually women
---
Not_Queen and Pat run the Twitter
---
Because I love you
---
no
---
FPS are considered infinitely easier to develop and has a much larger market share.   They were chasing $$$ and failed to consider the saturation of the market and that FPS players want to pew pew and don't really give a shit about 1 vs many gameplay.
---
Just as an update I restarted my game and still no cells.
---
So erect
---
Understandable
---
That’s fair too. They could always sit on the hook too and die that works too. I didn’t understand what you meant lol my bad.
---
Technically, it wasn’t actually fixed. It was just broken in a way that benefited the players so they just decided, “F**k it, let them have it.”
---
Aww daddy 🥰
---
I'm ignorant, why would copyright be a problem if the people creating want their music to be in the game?
---
Out of curiosity what rank are you?
---
Nurse still
---
Can we get an update when "the moment" happens
---
There isn’t really any issue with it ppl just don’t learn the map and when they get confused they blame bad balance lol
---
You should have taken a photo in the Mori position.
---
Did you start with 5?
---
Holy Carter, Chinchilla I love your work, thank you for all the inspiration.
---
Ty
---
Nah, it’s still Nurse. Definitely a little bit less better but still at the very top. As long as she has the power to go through stuff, she’s the best.
---
I got riffs for days, who wants to lay down some drum tracks?=$
---
This is dumb for two reasons;
---
-The guys who work on balance do NOT also work on animations or the like. That’s ridiculous to think.
---
-Saying this during the exact same patch that actually buffed her? K
---
It would be cool to get stacks in that situation though lol
---
I woulda probably got it if it was 5
---
I thought the generators and hooks were only for BP? Or do you mean if one of the challenges explicitly asks for the survivor/killer to interact with the gen/hook?
---
Lets be real, killers barely do this. They are always thirsty as fuck for 4ks i've seen this literally once happen to a survivor. Although I hgave had a killer who was bringing me to a hook say he was bringing me to hatch when i wiggled free and ran the opposite way to the hatch and jumped in.
---
&gt;Predatory monetization is the #1 priority for games today. A fool and his money are soon parted.
---
wat
---
Tbh If the Entity gave him some of his Left 4 Dead items like the M16 ans Molotovs he’d probably kill every last killer in the game  (Same goes for ash)
---
Oh boy, here goes my money
---
New cosmetics release every Wednesday. Myers and Laurie got theirs today, and the rest will follow every Wednesday.
---
The events bring out the worst in the community, just get use to it honestly. It happens every event or double bp event.
---
Anything helpful to killers is a game ruining mechanic and if I can’t spend the entire game t bagging and calling the killer a baby it needs to be nerfed immediately.
---
ah yes i forgot the golden rule that i have to wait 10 minutes to reply even if i see the notification instantly im so sorry i will never break that rule again just fucking kill me dude im so sorry
---
Hawkins is like the new Game... it's impossible 🤣
---
This subreddit is full of the biggest piss babies on earth and it will never change. Genuinely hate the people here
---
Oh ok thank you so much c:
---
True that!
---
Nope 0. You get the syrums from the rift, the archives are what they're having an issue with.
---
What did that dc accomplish, really?
---
He still get points for no escapes and a dc, and you get 0 points.  
---
I agree that it was a douchebag move of the killer but still.
---
my power got shut off a while ago, so I won’t be able to play it today :(
---
Ghostface is first, hag and Trapper are my second-favorite. You should try out the hag if you haven't as she has all the benefits of the Trappers mind games but multiplied because she can place her "traps" faster and already comes equipped with all of them.
---
For fuck sake I swear if it got updated to have haunted grounds after I worked my ass off to get haunted grounds on Spirit for my Doctor Im gonna be fucking pissed that I blew my BP’s like that
---
Isnt that unfair for people who didnt?
---
Isn't it 10$?
---
So ur ranting cos it’s good?
---
So if premium costs 1,000 cells and gives you 1,000 cells isn't it essentially free? You just have to have that money tied into the game?
---
It is only for bp. What I said was about why I think having the battle pass to earn serum might work out better than earning serum in trials by hooking/completing generators.
---
I went on my Xbox and looked at the updates even opened the game it doesn’t prompt with a update :/
---
Complaining about something that most people complain about doesn't really accomplish much. What are your ideas on how to handle the endgame? Just getting rid of the hatch would only make things disastrously worse.
---
I really wish they would update his model. This looks amazing, a lot less crackhead-ish
---
I don't know why you are being downvoted. The dash can sometimes be used at unsafe pallet loops, but that only works on bad survivors, because if a good survivor sees you croutch at a loop they are just going to run away.
---
As not a clown main I'm now a clown main.
---
Man mr envy’s wraith music, especially the killer POV chase music, would single handedly make wraith an S tier killer lol
---
Same here. I have no issues with it on either side. I actually enjoy it.
---
"Known Issue:  Survivors cannot back out of the lobby if they ready up while in the Loadout."  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/99318/pc-patch-notes-3-3-1-mid-chapter#latest](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/99318/pc-patch-notes-3-3-1-mid-chapter#latest)
---
Idk what flair to use. 
---
I guess discussion would have been better. Lol
---
That’s strange. I’m wondering why I started with 5 serums and a few rifts fragments..
---
I’m confused: how were people able to “make progress on their backend” when making progress involved completing quests you have to select? Were the quests just auto-completing or something?
---
She is very satisfying. I love trapping the shit out of the last gen I know they're working on, like five or six traps and teleporting back as I hear them all pop at once.
---
Damn the event they held off right?
---
Ahh sorry, wishful thinking I suppose :S
---
More like
---
&gt;DC DC DC DC DC
---
I have this exact same issue, I sent a support ticket just in case. Hopefully they fix this soon.
---
the game definitely isn't dying but it's getting less fun I'd say.
---
Thank you
---
Tomorrow
---
Don’t worry about it
---
I look at this picture and see Daniel Tosh on Purge night! Great job!
---
You earn rift points 2 ways. From completing the quests and from general experience gain from playing. All XP gained between the 18th and today was converted into rift points as if it had been active.
---
They never release all the cosmetics at once. When a batch leaks, it will last until the next patch with one or two releasing per week
---
imagine typing all that shit out and still being wrong. being high tier isnt the same as being op or broken.
---
Excellent!!
---
Ah okay that makes sense. Especially with such a short time frame.
---
Just google it and you’ll see that the devs probably got the design of the rift based on it as you are able to earn cosmetics and stuff via Fortnite’s battle pass. Instead of the Archive, Fortnite has weekly challenges that mostly reward you a lot of XP so that you progress further in to the battle pass. It’s essentially a reason to keep playing the game daily or somewhat consistently.
---
I can't tell you the last time I actually wiggled free without a few body blocks and/or hook drops so I never really did it anymore. Now I at least have a reason to even if I know I won't escape. Good on the devs
---
You gotta get those bomb ass add ons my dude.
---
Weird choice to post it on the internet, then.
---
For me it's the opposite, I think the game is really fun to play, but I was under the impression the player base was getting really small. Maybe I'm wrong about that.
---
I feel like this is an over-exaggeration. The community as a whole really needs to chill with the concept of us vs them, and me vs others. Yeah SWF is broken, sure Spirit is strong, but so are other killers in the right settings. Currently, Spirit doesn't have any requirements to be strong, but honestly she is slow as hell and relies on your ability to travel. The community gives a lot of shit to each other, which creates this toxic environment. 
---
That Spirit who tunneled? Last game they might have played against a SWF lobby who wasted time, played like asses, and then was rude to them in the post-game lobby. Understanding both sides goes a long way.
---
I play Spirit because I find her a lot of fun, especially with BBQ and predicting where uninjured survivors are running to so I can spook em' (doesn't work as well in the red ranks, as I rarely run Beads). Most of the time I am just trying to get chases, to hit survivors and get 4 stacks. Keep that in mind, and the honestly the interactions get a lot easier.
---
I'm sorry you've had rough games, and you're frustrated, but don't let others control your enjoyment. There is no reward to rank, there is nothing you get from it. Just enjoy the game, but if you don't anymore then that's fine too.
---
Hope you have a good day bud,
---
Friendly Neighborhood Spirit Main.
---
Can we use last years?
---
Oh no daddy Myers :(
---
Yes sir/madam, it went live today. One small hiccup, but it's pretty good.
---
It’s fine as it is, from a balance standpoint neither insta heals nor moris should be in the game. They both give an out to bad players.
---
If its one thing the DBD team is good at its postponing things.
---
I love the Survivor disconnect bonus, that was much needed. And I can't wait to see survivors dropping every palette in the map the first time I chase them LOL.
---
Awesome video 
---
Great play on both sides
---
Hit em wit the crying laughing emoji
---
UGH I was hoping for the opportunity to purchase it on the Switch if it was.
---
According to the wiki, generator regression goes at .25 charges per second, taking up to 320 seconds. A survivor can complete a generator by themself in 80 seconds assuming they’re going at base speed and don’t hit any great skill checks. I agree with your idea, but I’m not sure just how much this needs to be tuned. I feel like increasing regression to something like .5 would be unfair in combination with something like pop goes the weasel, but anything under that doesn’t seem like it would help that much.
---
Yes, they stated it would now detect him in Tier 1.
---
So do you gain the serum from repairing the generators?
---
how come
---
Yeah I got 1 petal in 4 bloodwebs even in low levels... &lt;3
---
Activates tomorrow and ends on November 3rd.
---
Wow I soon as I saw this loaded into a game with mori
---
Like I said previous matches influenced me.
---
so youd rather artists never post anything then?
---
I want to earn the 4k, i don't actually care about actually taking it. I will slug survivors for the 4k and still give hatch if the last guy doesn't wiggle.
---
If I get far enough in that it’s worth it/basically free definitely. There wasn’t too much I found interesting in this first pass and right now I’m saving my cells for the new Jane and Steve cosmetics.
---
Why would you use an axe to chop such a small log?
---
I appreciate her desires, but then she shouldn’t post it on the internet.
---
Awww THANK YOU, da_mummy! I really love your doctor cosplay. Hope I could see more of your pictures ♥️✨
---
Sad truth. This community is one of the most cancerous I've had the misfortune of knowing. I feel for the developers who have to put up with it. Nothing they do is good enough, the littlest mistake is shit all over and raged at to no end.
---
i understand that you dislike spirit and being tunneled, but killers also like winning. and spirit and tunneling (tunneling helps depending on the situation) make that chance of winning that bit higher with how fast gens can be etc.
---
YES!
---
How would dbd know if you did though
---
people like you are why artists sick of reposting stop posting their art all together
---
I actually don't get tilted when I play her and don't do well, which I do sometimes with other killers. Especially since I play console, I just recognize I'm not going to get many kills with her
---
You dont get it immediately all you have done is unlocked for it to appear in the bloodweb on other survivors.
---
I do fairly well on both sides, you just need to memorize it.
---
because most likely they used samples from other music, and that other music could have copyright
---
the next 2 games were like this aswel, i guess its just a feature?
---
Huh
---
&gt;at least the event is working
---
Jolly fucking good, the only problem is that this event is the laziest fucking shit they ever managed to pull on us.
---
When I got the game it was when ruin in the shrine so by the time I got to rank 19 I was a GOD at hitting those ruins.
---
Hope we get ghost face soon.
---
Spirit should be at top
---
for maybe 1 hour max of archive downtime? really?
---
If you bought it, it’s unlocked and can be found in survivor bloodwebs. Just gotta spend the BP to find it and tier it up to 3.
---
Right with ya, just try to spread positivity where you can, even if it seems hopeless against the giant wave of negativity. If one person is less toxic because I am silly as a killer, or joke around in the post game lobby as survivor, then it's worth.
---
No, I mean it says I dont have it unlocked, the perk isnt available, I'm aware of how it usually works
---
someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
---
Same here, man! Every since Leaks By Daylight posted it, I've been chomping at the bits to get them! I'm dropping $45 in Auric Cells this Friday! The cosmetic obsession is real!
---
They’re probably leaving after finishing their challenges so they can start the next one quicker
---
Just got home and was going to get Dance with Me. Oh well
---
Yes there was.....it was determined weeks ago
---
Why do detectable perks work on stealth killers now like their whole gimmick is their stealth :/
---
the last second delays they couldnt do anything about? yeah, thats total deception, we just got owned dude wow
---
I dont think crossplay between PC and consoles is fair.
---
if you dont think its worth 10 then dont get it. fucking hell, its not content its skins. id understand if the rift/archive was locked behind this but its skins and charms
---
pc players dont get hag for free, but we get huntress
---
I think the free path is a joke. They shoved the serums on it to mask how barren it is.
---
That said it is entirely cosmetic, so I suppose it doesn't hurt the game.
---
This community never disappoints.

Really? that’s a bit of a bold move
---
unless they changed it, says heals passively over 8 seconds
---
Oh ive been plasying. I just didnt play the PTB
---
&gt;overall game health
---
A lazy ass event that looks like it was put together by an intern in 20 minutes sure is good for game health.
---
Also not to mention that Spirit is one of the best killers in the game and is worth grinding cause all her perks are good, especially with Spirit Fury being meta for M1 killers. She’s also available for free with shards while Bubba is a weak killer and has to be bought with money. Although obvi that last part doesn’t matter if you already own him
---
False alarm, it's just a shroud of separation
---
I agree but I meant consoles with consoles. Maybe only pc in custom matches.
---
Okay, that's more fair i guess. As much as i wish they'd compensate downtime or delays like that with free stuff, itd probably cut into their profits a bit too much.
---
Yeah I’ve had three in a row as well. Hook someone, walk away, wait for unhook, phase back, down unhooked survivor. It’s so goddamn boring.
---
oh then yeah, i totally agree with that. console with console is fair
---
Face your fears is basically Lullaby without having to get stacks and not being a Hex
---
!Remindme 2 days
---
You get serum for doing the free path on the Rift.
---
Just play as whatever you enjoy the most and donate those points to hag. You dont "have" to play her.
---
And if you mean slogging as in just playing the game, well... you should probably stop playing the game if youre not enjoying it.
---
The serum is on the free track from the battle pass so you don’t have to spend money to get it. You can do the challenges for free on unlock rift levels to get serum or you can just gain points for rift levels by playing normally and unlocking them with XP.
---
I hate inside maps as much as I hate reposts
---
I did, still the same thing.
---
The tweaked the numbers in 3.3.3. Syptic now lasts 8 secs, and Syringe takes 16secs to heal.
---
I did, but it's still not working.
---
I play survivor and killer so there's certain killer perks i dont run just because i hate them as a survivor. I dont use ruin but I'll use corrupt intervention. And if im going after someone that was just unhooked it's because they were farmed. And people being gen rushed as a killer will resort to tunneling or camping if they atleast want a 1k. It's not cool but it's how some people choose to play
---
Oh no! You couldn't use the rift for 1 hour :O Did you survive without it?

Good job holding onto dead hard until the moment you needed it. I see a lot of people panic and bust it too early. It's a great perk, but there's a learning curve to using it. There are a million and one uses for dead hard. Learn them, and it will treat you well. I've been using it since I started playing David King many moons ago, and I still have room to improve.  
---
Dead Hard technique #701342: Impossible hook save. Begin unhooking to bait a swing from the killer (make sure not to get pulled off). While he is in the attack animation cooldown, after he's hit you, pull the survivor off with borrowed time. Immediately dead hard as you finish the animation. You will dead hard through the survivor, and the killers second swing will hit them, activating BT and allowing you both to escape. The timing is close, but if you pair this with Resilience you will unhook 9% faster, allowing for more wiggle room. It's a great technique for a last minute save that doesn't have to result in a one for one.
---
hey that’s cool!! i’m just glad the spelling mistake didn’t ruin it ahaha
---
I've been trying to figure out the serum as well, I'm with ya there
---
Umm no cos Fortnite is FREE?
---
If it is just a video game why do you care about the rift being gone for 1 hour?
---
Dead by daylight devs must not have thought this through
---
Yeh I looked at the petal offerings, you only get extra BP
---
Pretty shitty honestly, T1 Myers didn’t need a nerf in my opinion
---
so you get serum for completing the challenges?
---
I get a lot of fps drops on PC as well, I assume we will get a hot fix at some point.
---
You only get it from the rift, but it's in the free track so you don't have to buy premium Pass
---
it doesn't tell you how to get serum, am confusion
---
Send a ticket, they could probably fix it or tell you what to do.
---
True, I get why people get mad at the amount of bugs sometimes but the rift was gone for 1 hour... It's not that the rift is a big game changer or anything.
---
oh, ok
---
One makes people miscalculate, one totally fucks them into fear of preparing for every skillcheck, distracting the survivor
---
More like sharing my mirth than complaining.
---
thanks. I'll come back if I have more questions haha
---
Theyr fine 😂
---
I hope the change doesn’t last, it really doesn’t seem like something we needed
---
Aha I only just found out myself dude no worries
---
no, tier 1 myers was unique in the fact that his aura couldnt be read while in tier 1
---
It’s cause the event.  Switch to other side if you want instant queue times.
---
I activate my trap card "uno reverse"
---
because it wont change the gameplay and it gives money money money

my level would appear to be somewhat bugged
---
Already unlocked it levelling bubba
---
The axe is not the weapon. The Huntress is the weapon.
---
Im so confused, this is my first event. It says in the archive im Tier 39 already? Is this like the ranking system highest level is 1 and 20 lowest?
---
I just pointed out the way your argument can be used against you, its 2 sides of the same coin.
---
But no, i love using Unbreakable, Autodidact and Empathy even if theyre not crutch perks
---
Just played my first game against a doctor in wreckers. Easy win and found a hollow wisp flashlight. I’ve been excited to see this flashlight but is it any better
---
Do you not see the flare? He reposted the meme because to start a discussion which he achieved.
---
New source of BP and game lore pretty much.
---
Complaining about something that is 1.  Completely optional 2.  Adds NO competitive advantage 3.  Supports the devs and will keep the game alive for longer.   What’s so disappointing?
---
Pink Flashlight
---
Still waiting for my Naughty Bear inspired trapper skin.
---
Why NOT a battle pass? Stop complaining about things just to complain.
---
There's 2 - 4 perks that killers always run in high ranks, and 3 - 4 that survivors do. It's getting really, really stale and annoying.
---
It looks like you have a survivor challenge accepted. I think you can only have a single challenge accepted at a time?
---
Okay, well, let’s say low quality then.:P
---
I like the general concept enough may actually draw this out as a comic at some point with the limited art skill I have.
---
So I now have to grind 2000 cells ASAP and then 2000 more before the end of the week.
---
Thanks.
---
what about Urban, AND fixated? I have just transcended the human comprehension, I’m on a new level of existence.
---
Does anyone know what to do if I got DDOS offline?
---
I’ve seen a huge wall of text somebody complaining about Bhvr and DbD once lmao
---
Same thing's happening to me. On Xbox One also.
---
I two dais ago I caved and bought the fucking DLC for Bubba and levelled him for BBQ
---
Ok, im sorry, shoulda known other than to post my opinion
---
Trappers at the top of that list, wait no probably hag, or maybe demigorgon 🤔
---
I mean as you said it is an event and their trying to have fun too plus as the killer their task is to kill everyone so he's just doing the minimum instead of being a try hard
---
Didn't we know this was coming for a while? I feel like this is old news.
---
Fnaf gone fucked
---
What platform are you on?
---
I have a feeling its going to be awhile for switch release considering there's already a bunch of issues for the switch version already. Such as the daily rituals resetting randomly without u even touching it so if u think u completed a daily ritual after a game...nope, it magically transforms into another daily ritual.
---
Quentin needs his rest.
---
On Xbox and this is also an issues I’m facing
---
Honestly it kind of adds to the meme. Not only did they DC, but they can't spell.
---
Does it also lock content behind a paywall, can you still buy Outfits with shards etc.
---
I mean it’s not like it’s a surprise, we’ve known about it for months now lol
---
(Insert insult because u agreed with him)
---
The second half of this.  Any Pig trying that on me is just going to cause me to Usain Bolt away from the loop entirely and to the next safe area.
---
Oh wow, I did not know this, I thought you’d always hear phasing (prayer beads excluded)
---
I think they’re silly too but more financial support for devs = more time devoted to fixing the game up for us
---
Sometimes this happens to me on ps4. You didn't lose bloodpoints, just spend them and you should be about where you were. Sometimes I find if you spend a bunch of points and log off immediately without playing a game or anything it does a soft reset of everything you spent.
---
It's just a joke post, not a theory about Jack getting into the game because of a tweeter gif. I explained it in a comment.
---
While I do understand your point of view we do have paedophile character, freddy so... Idk. Still fiction vs reality sure but still
---
Would it be too cruel to send this to my friend and tell him they added this?
---
Legion.
---
I love debuffing people and their power is perfect for that.
---
I'm sorry to those that have gone against my sloppy, thana, dying light, and discordance combo but using these perks brought me joy.
---
They’ve announced that all outfits will be released eventually, I think they said 6 months.  So all the optional cosmetics that grant 0 gameplay advantage will be able to be bought with hopefully shards
---
This has been known for a long time. The pass only has cosmetics and if you buy the premium track you get your 1000 cells back by leveling up the pass so you can buy the next one with the same 1000 cells you used to get the first. It's one of the better passes I've seen, and if you don't like it you don't need to buy it. The cosmetics will eventually be released in the store for people that didn't buy the pass.
---
There was no plan for mobile, independent servers, etc. 
---
It will happen...just later
---
Shouldn't have ran away so he wouldn't be able to get the safe save points. You're pretty much already guaranteed to lose when playing with farmers
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dpc4uz/just_finished_updating_and_i_already_have/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Its a Heffalump!
---
Nope. Since you get rift fragments to level up the rift through the already existing XP system, all XP you’ve gotten in the last week and a half awarded you with the number of rift fragments you would’ve earned had the update already been live.
---
Yeah, I want a meta shakeup, whether in the form of nerfing/changing popular perks or adding new, strong perks that can be added to the top tier meta.
---
But they had an image ready! They must've known there would be a problem. Otherwise how on earth would they have known to dedicate at least 5 minutes to making a stock copy pasta image?!
---
Okay, thanks!
---
*Cough* BULLSHIT!
---
My complaint is good and warranted. The voice acting for the archives is dog shit. Whoever is reading that lore off is comically bad at it.
---
Really wish we could have gotten the bandage head cosmetic since this seems to be from Halloween 4. But maybe still in the future!
---
Uuuh ok
---
The new system is actually really good at preventing the grind.
---
I'm already tier 45 and only play like 3 games a day sometimes less.
---
But... it is cosplay..
---
I don't understand it either haha
---
That changes my comment how exactly?
---
are you saying you want this because its locked behind the battle pass?
---
I love all of these! Killer and survivor ones 😃 r they real or just a Wishlist?
---
ah, haven't played the new patch yet so /shrug
---
Oh god thats more toxic then 2 killers.
---
they just need to make it "get a 4k"
---
lol, its the patch notes
---
I really like indoor maps as survivor. I know they're geared more towards killer and that's what makes them so fun for me. It adds a lot of fear, all the twists and turns.
---
But like kindred is pretty useless now NGL
---
Also are they survival points or boldness points?
---
Jeff= jesus
---
I’m just wondering what’s so bad about a battle pass that’s completely optional and grants no competitive advantage
---
Imagine complaining about something that is completely optional, lets people have something to work towards, and doesn't harm anyone.
---
You are basically asking for a complete rework of every killer's power and make the game a complete mess that bhvr will have to slowly try to rebalance yet again,but even then there will be always meta killers and low rank killers,they're all viable to a certain extent and fun to play but some are just better than others because their power helps you during a chase,removing nurse's blink for example is pratically impossible and if you're asking to nerf them into the ground that won't happen either,even if it would happen you would have new killers to dislike because the new meta killers would get used "too often" (aka if I die it automatically means that I have to be salty instead of learning my mistakes) and you would ask for even more nerfs
---
Old news
---
Definitely send in a support ticket if you haven't already. I'm sure you're not the only one.
---
Go to r/leaksbydaylight they have a list with all the release dates
---
They could make it a point threshold that isn't so close to maximum.
---
So far I've either been bullied by mediocre players (because of low-tier perks) or as I'm on my way to the achievement, a player DCs and ruins my points.
---
the archives just give little lore. the rift gives challenges then when you complete them you get BP and "archive points"
---
no problems here. ps4
---
r/deadbydaylight WAHHHHHH devs bad they delayed the update REEEEEEE
---
devs: finally release new update 
---
also r/deadbydaylight wtf behavior how dare you give us new content? why this?
---
The only thing locked behind it are the charms which are really sucky anyways. Everything else has like a 6 month delay before it comes to the shop. TBH I expect a charm section in the shop soon.
---
Although T hate how the Serum was implemented. They shouldn't make players interact with it if they don't want to. I'm kind of afraid that all future events will be like this which would suck.....
---
It's not only that the killer stands to gain, but he can't really lose anything. The guy dying on hook is what, 500 points? Even the shittiest chase isn't gonna be much worse than that, whereas survivors get a lot of points from escaping AND keep their item.
---
By camping the killer is getting a guaranteed couple hundred points, but missing out on the chance of getting much more, and also denying the surviors a chance at 5k+ points, keeping their item, and leaving a bitter taste in their mouth because there wasn't anything they could do to even attempt to save a teammate (outside of tryhard-swf's).
---
From a gameplay perspective it doesn't really make sense to hardcamp the last survivor unless it's a daily maybe. I don't expect a killer to just randomly walk to the opposite side of the map, but if a surv comes close enough to maybe chase him away from the exit gates, then chasing makes sense, as both sides can get a lot out of it, and it leads to much less salt and toxicity too.
---
From a roleplay perspective I could maybe see the camp, but I haven't met any actual bubba roleplayers yet, even though many might as well be.
---
&gt; The guys who work on balance do NOT also work on animations or the like. That’s ridiculous to think.
---
I said it was a waste of time, not who was working on what. No matter who worked on it, it's not something that is pivotal to the Pig. I don't get excited over silly stuff like this. Buff her power, then I'd perk up.
---
&gt; Saying this during the exact same patch that actually buffed her?
---
Ah yes, the ole Undectectable While Crouching buff.. the buff that no one really asked for, the buff that doesn't really do anything since no one really uses her crouch. Bang up job, BHVR. Here's the golf clap, Lampkin19978.
---
How about actual buffs that actually matter such as making her traps useful during the end game, not as RNG dependent during the game period. Rule set 2 as base, crouching speed increase and mindgamey, etc. *checks the patch notes* Nope, I see no real actual buffs that will matter much. So this is another dud for the Pig this patch.
---
I'm just gonna hug my Switch in the corner now...
---
And of course the Claudette is in the back hiding.
---
they nerfed it harder
---
Not really, BHVR already has a great composer
---
Yeah if a killer can get a 4k alone than two will be awesome plus gens could be finish faster
---
Yeah I guess, still sucks.
---
It's not that bad, I looked over it but to me there is so many games now with a battle pass, and I feel games are good on their own without one, like DBD
---
none of these whiners have any good reason.
---
good luck in the fog m8. maybe I'll encounter you someday and let you escape haha
---
That's how I'm wanting to read this. Taking Fan Made stuff and just slapping it into the game is unlikely, but I'm sure they've been hearing all of the discussion about people wanting it. Then again they've heard the recommendations for new choices for moris and stuff along those lines as well, so we'll see.
---
Why are you so eager to suck the dev's off? They keep making promises and breaking them last minute, that's bound to piss people off.
---
No, the red stain going through walls was never a part of mind games lol, you push survivors a certain way simply because the red stain is visible, when it's going through the wall, the survivor has wall hacks, and can see you trying to moonwalk like a dumbass, because the red stain goes out to the side a bit
---
Lol. I hate toxic survivors. Just tired of hearing about it. I run into enough of them while playing Freddy.
---
Thank you. It was from a year ago so I have gotten better, and the Nea was pretty good.
---
Why not? It is for the people that want to spend money to get cosmetics. If you don't buy cosmetics, don't bother?
---
I laughed outloud, no everyone funeral is looking at me.
---
Yeah they are definitely doing that, the challenge to disconnect from 100 games right before you get hooked.
---
You can still mindgame dude
---
You can't sit with us, Jeff
---
You are doing g the entity's work, on that note draw nea entity next!
---
WAZZAP!!!
---
I would've disconnected, the killer did nothing to help and just encouraged it.
---
It doesn’t surprise me, he’s s tier. 
---
Stop telling people tho or they’ll nerf him.
---
"if you diagree that means im right" there's really no point in arguing with you, is there?
---
Yeah me too, I tried restarting too but that didn't work
---
new event offering i guess
---
Ps4 player😞
---
No it wasnt? You show your red stain on purpose in the direction you're not going
---
Hey that’s what’s up!
---
Fanmade projects almost never make it official because it's a mess for corporate legality, authentication, copyrights etc.
---
It does happen rarely though, so there is hope.
---
Context?
---
You can still mindgame and do that, survivors will see your red light dissapear around the corner and will assume you're doubling back
---
I've been seeing this since the demogorgon patch, since then i've not played anymore
---
free track of the battle pass. putting the dollar signs signals,at least to me you have to pay for it. which you dont. just play and you will get them
---
Yeah, I hate disconnecting, even under these circumstances. I try my best to avoid doing it
---
You can unlock her with shards, tho.
---
I can see why people resort to tunneling and camping, but i dont see the need to punch me and to constantly nod while camping me
---
well, why do you have a problem with it? you can earn back the money you paid for the premium path, there is a free path if you just don't wanna bother with the premium path, and nothing related to gameplay is locked away. so what's the issue? they literally looked at all the issues people had with battle passes over the years, and said "okay, lets do this, but let's do it in a way that falls in line with what people want"
---
and yet people still moan and scream and cry.
---
It's not that bad could be a lot worse
---
You’re only supposed to be able to get 32k in a game but I got 37k
---
Dang I thought it would have all the dlc included!
---
Fair 😂
---
wE dId A PrEtTy gOoD jOb So FaR
---
Yay
---
My game crashed earlier when Clown threw a bottle at me, IDK if it’s this killer in particular that caused this.
---
But it's redundant.
---
honestly im thinking of not playing this event at all unless they fix it
---
its pretty frustrating when we're winning and out of the blue someone just disconnects which gives the killer the win
---
this person is wrong. its on the free side of the battle pass so just play and you will get them. the person has a really big hate boner for the battle pass
---
Billy, the amount of speed and map pressure you can apply with double engravings and consistent one hit downs is bar none the most effective way to keep those gens from popping. Once you learn how to properly back-rev and curve even Rank 1 survivors fall like dominos.
---
Do you remember the username? I had a survivor match a while back with a Bill and Doctor team. The Doctor would hook and stand there while the Bill unhooked, then I would get downed again.
---
Ah yeah, didn't catch up the mod, but I've seen you many times in chat and in notification :)
---
Yeah same :) Usually for Killer but sometimes you're amazed by some little trick you never thought of.
---
Prayer Beads, Moris and NOED approach...
---
"We overheard what you said about instaheal.  We..we...we're still cool though right?"
---
Yeah I messaged him, his name was mastakwono. Killer wasn’t working with him though, he got hit a few times
---
Damn. I needed thanataphobia. I already have both those killer perks
---
Seriously of all the events not to host on your HORROR GAME
---
Whats insane to me are the people in the background not trying to run away, that one dude in the suit looks over and then kinda casually walks away. The girl is probably calling the police but I would never do it that close to the actual shooter, what if he goes after you next!
---
Both are great and I use both of they're teachables it's a win win situation
---
Yeah but that's not even a match, I don't DC unless the match is just total Griefing and this definitely was that
---
Good edit but I hope they never add it, I hate Scary Movie lol
---
I believe so but I'm not 100% sure. I've only been playing the game about a year but this is the first they've had since I started playing
---
It's not an argument though? I'm just saying it's funny when people try to use that as an excuse for them losing.
---
Not just you, East Coast USA on PC. I can find matches as killer but it takes a very long time.
---
Last halloween had a bunch of plants you succd to fill vials and once they were empty everybody just killed themselves on hook instantly to get to the next game for more
---
Okay, but you can not seriously be comparing a fictional character with a Nazi. I know your particular Nazi isn't real, but the group and their atrocities are.
---
They didn’t know, if you looked at their recent tweets its clear they didn’t know that people would have had progress.
---
It's here to stay, the contents get refreshed every 70 days, it's designed to be so you play about an hour per level. The cosmetics will be new and after a couple months will appear on the store. You also earn back the cells you spend on it.
---
I really dislike when my team does that. I screenshot their username and I do the same thing to them if I ever find them again.😂
---
Wait so you STILL can’t get points for the Halloween cosmetics? What’s the point of this event?
---
Of course it would be back up with the quickness since it would have costed them money. Wasn't worried about it.
---
Make a support ticket and show proof like screen shot now then when you rank up again take another one to show they weren't added
---
The legions a tricky on i couldn't find any good ones of the rest so i just used frank. Susie i top tier
---
I like your idea, I think it would be pretty fair. I’m a 50/50 player too and the only mori I have a problem with is ebony. You really shouldn’t be able to end the game for multiple people after just 1 hook. Even ivory isn’t too bad because it’s just one person.
---
You are very bold and brave MaximusProxi for sharing your opinion in a world where no one respects you unless you are on their side.  Kudos brother.
---
People have t wanted legion nerfs since his rework
---
That legit happened btw one of the survs got to play as killer along that Michael
---
Myers would fuck them up, change my mind
---
I find matches as a survivor very quickly but weirdly I can't with killer.
---
His flow is a bit off, but to be fair they could have done a lot worse.
---
How do y’all get lost in a map that’s the same layout every time?
---
It was totally justified since the gates were already open. The others are supposed to escape and if they don't the right thing 9ts their own fault for getting caught. As the killer in that situation it's ok even if you get a 1k you did your best.
---
The only way I would say camping is a bad thing is when their are still generators to do. If you stay there you'll get punished for it. But if you see activity near the person you hooked then patrol for a quick minute and leave to find someone else. If they get off then you'll find them again eventually.
---
I thought you were talking about something else. At the fact that I have no credit on this, you are right, and I gave credit by commenting the tweet where this can be found.
---
I think you should still have them. If not, contact support they would probably give you your shards back
---
yeah you probably just have bad luck and havent found ruin again
---
Honestly i love the challenge of inside maps
---
Yeah I did think about that. It could be changed that instead of SS he could be Wehrmacht, while they did participate in the bad side in the war, most of them were considered victims not willingly following hitler's ideals, most of them anyway. Change the backstory and uniform and there you go.
---
Disagree. It should matter if you don't plan ahead and 3 gen yourself.
---
Lmao the animators giving her a bear trap in the lobby isn’t hurting anything, you’re really reaching there. It’s a small thing that was done in less than a day, it’s nothing to bang on about.
---
And nobody uses her crouch? Well, maybe the people who don’t know how to play Pig don’t use crouch. Maybe those are the kinds of people you’re referring to? 
---
Look, I agree that Pig needs buffs. But you’re reaching here.
---
You do own them, don’t worry. The changes in the shrine were confirmed to be a mistake that is going to be reversed soon.
---
Yes you would own all of the ones you purchased, just keep buying bloodwebs you'll find it!
---
Check your hag. If ruin is not checked on her character page then u don’t have it.
---
Guessing it might be an issue they recognise and sort out then
---
Okay Ill try remember
---
That’s not a limp, it’s swag
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
I'm terrible at this game. I'm lucky to get between 9k to 10k per game, killer or survivor.
---
But it’s monto in the picture
---
That is why i have skillchecks on my mouse. I feel like it's easier to hit great skillchecks that way
---
they said there were problems with the update on switch so who knows now.
---
I have and theres 3 other ranks its not all about you
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dp9i32/archives_are_back_up/f5tf9f1?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
So 4000 to buy and 3000 to do a gen?  Big brain plays.
---
Not at all. Play the game how you want to play it. It can be cool to farm but if you don't want to, then don't worry about it. You bought the game for your enjoyment, not to make sure everyone else has a good time.
---
&gt;The guy dying on hook is what, 500 points? Even the shittiest chase isn't gonna be much worse than that, whereas survivors get a lot of points from escaping AND keep their item.
---
In the meme situation above, I doubt the killer would care much about saving the survivors' items or earning them more blood points. Altruism and generosity between killer and survivors is nice and all but it's not anything anyone is entitled to, it has no bearing on what *should* be done from a gameplay perspective.
---
There is simply much more to gain from camping. You secure that kill. If the survivors try to stage a rescue, you can sometimes turn one into three or four kills if things go your way. Chasing the survivors who are baiting you of their own accord and fighting them on their grounds the way they want you to is *not* the play, unless you really want to go out of your way to make them happy, or you have a killer/perks/addons that give you a good shot at winning that chase.
---
It's really damn simple. If the survivors are actively trying to get you to chase them, it's because they believe they can make a full 4 players escape, and they're setting up to make it happen. To not take the bait isn't "omg toxic camping". If they want to rescue their teammate, it is **their** responsibility to make it happen, and the killer doesn't have to act dumb and enter a pointless chase just to give them that chance. If they think that sucks and it feels bad or it makes them salty, then remember that *they can just leave through the gates. Or they can rush the hook. They have* ***all*** *the agency here.*
---
I’m not getting them either but I feel like the support ticket is the best option
---
Bravo. Upvote for you.
---
And the knife is on the right hand finally
---
Hell yeah
---
You have them, theres like 30 perks in the game each with 3 levels with no other teachables, your not guaranteed it.
---
Just to be sure - which one do you try to select? At first, only two are available, "hook 8 survivors" and "repair 2 gens"
---
Only if you guide them there and then slam the hatch shut before they get out. I had a killer do that to me and BOY did it make me rage. Why waste my time like that? Just kill me if you gonna kill me.
---
Did Meyer’s low key get buffed with him now being undetectable in tier 1?
---
Oh I agree Hag is ton of fun to play and easily one of the easiest killers to pick up. High B tier killer. Also if you run the add on that shows auras when triggered it can burn through distortion so quick and mess with survivors.
---
Thanks for the Reddit gold kind stranger
---
I know I think that the battle pass is good too for new players to get more cosmetics early on and not spend money same with the charms that come with it, I realize that I posted it immediately without thinking too much of what was on it but that there was a pass, so I apologize for the controversial subject that I touched on
---
I hate how I'm in this picture
---
Damn bro Two Decisives?  Sign me up I love that perk.
---
It's 3000 to buy. And you get 3k for every gen, so if 5 offerings were burnt, you can get up to 18k (one gen spawns automatically)
---
Oh, you're approaching me?
---
Player has D/C
---
are you always like this or is it just a bad day for you
---
“Is this because I forgot to fully turn back into a human that *one* time?”
---
GAME CRASHED DURING A LOADING SCREEN AND IT ATE MY BPS.
---
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW.
---
They gave it the brand new part treatment.
---
It ought to be here, but it isn't
---
He takes no pauses and the sentences are insanely choppy. 3 words per sentence. No flow at all. Very bad. How could they do this? Mcote. Mclean. Queen. Why BHVR. Why.
---
Imagine how painful was to unlock the adept Nurse...
---
And then a survivor disconnects in the loading screen
---
For gens 1-3/4 it's better to heal first. For the last Gen, there are only three possible gens to complete. As a result the killer has almost double the normal map pressure cause they only need to patrol 3 gens. If you spend time healing, you'll never get that last Gen done. The team will overall take fewer hooks if you commit. 
---
Which is why adrenaline is meta
---
aww really? that's awful. i love doing the thing :(
---
wait are you sure you're just not being blocked by a gen?
---
This. This is the attitude to take.
---
And as soon as the gen pops, the killer have to worry about 2 exit gates. He just comes for the gen if he's close or have NOED, otherwise he's most worry about the doors or the survivor he could be chasing at that moment.
---
He could be referring to the solid year of survivor nerf updates the devs have released trying to reign in how overpowered survivors were for a while there.  Don't get me wrong updates were mostly very necessary but if this was what he was referring too he'd still technically have a point.  Killers have been coming out on top for the last year of patches in an attempt to make playing killer feel more viable and fun.  And to a large extent it's worked.  It's the really bad players that still go into every game talking about bullshit op survivors at this point.
---
You can't sabotage event hooks, at least not for the last few events
---
Blade swipe
---
are you always someone who thinks its funny and cool to stress and make fun of a dev team for something they couldn't control? i bet you a hundred bucks you think its cool to ""cancel"" people
---
Everyone complaining about a 10$ cosmetic battle pass are likely unemployed shut-ins and fail to realize different teams work on different things. The bug-fixing team isn’t going to operate in the marketing/cosmetic departments.
---
Happened to me once, i as a clown got matched with a legion. He wouldn't get intoxicated...
---
So that might also be 3K for every hook? 
---
Certainly seems like a better farm than the usual BP offerings, but worse than BPS/Exit Cake/Survivor Pudding
---
🙌
---
im aware of that but i mean a sub reddit. a place that is much larger and could get more attention.
---
Really? RIP. I thought they’d give it a blunt sound since they gave the Pigs drill weapon it’s own SFX.
---
Run distortion or stop what you're doing and run to where your teammate is about to get hooked, so you're close enough to not pop up in the BBQ.
---
The styptic is so much better than the Syringe too

Im getting detectives, seems less garbage now
---
we have known about a battle pass for months now
---
Is this on ps4 yet ????????????
---
Broken skilless cheese.  But so are moris.  Both need a joint rework to make playing both sides more skill dependent.  Bringing either into a lobby is just a joke.
---
[fortnite bad](http://alphanewsmn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/6b5.png)
---
That's literally the anatomic proportions of a child...
---
Well, for killer these hooks aren't very exciting - pudding or streamers will give you more points. And you don't need to put survivors on event hooks to progress the event, so... it's whatever, I'd say
---
1000 Auric Cells that you earn back while completing it, a lot of cosmetics included, whereas one outfit usually costs approximately 1080....call me crazy, but I think it’s pretty nice. You don’t have to pay if you don’t want to.
---
I know eventually we'll be starting on hooks its ridiculous -.-
---
FUCK YES! Now for BBQ!
---
Yeah they showed it in the devstream. "T-Pose model"
---
The rift was definitely mentioned that it would be a battle-pass like system.  The nice thing is that, A) if you don't want to buy premium, just don't.  You're still getting tons of free cosmetics that you wouldn't have gotten otherwise, so it's free content.  and B), if you do get the pass, you get 1000 auric cells back anyway by the end of it, so if you max out the pass every time then it's essentially a one time purchase.
---
The lobby runs on like 15 fps on the pro. Its awful
---
I haven't played since dedicated servers hit
---
Pallets feel wrong and killer swings feel off
---
when will we get it?
---
3k BP for completing event gens. 3k BP for event hooks.
---
I can agree that clipping could be turned off I would just be afraid of the bugs that would come with that lol
---
It's not bannable, it doesn't break any rules. I do it all the time.
---
I see why they're nerfing it, but I feel like they should have just hard buffed purple medkit instead of nerfing green. Green medkit beats purple medkit hands down pre-nerf.
---
Is there an actual problem you have? Or just fortnite bad?
---
It's about goddamn time.
---
They both look really good. The hair for Feng and knife for Clown look great.
---
Thanks just checked I have it &lt;3
---
Honestly I don't understand why people are acting like this changes the game at its core or makes it worse in any way at all. Its literally just an additional way to earn cosmetics with optional challenges. It doesn't affect gameplay in the slightest. Every person I've seen bitch about it mentions fortnite so I'm 100% its just a hard on hate for fortnite going on.
---
Positive, its a invisible wall that pushes you off of where you normally jump from you can almost make it but you cant.
---
You talking about gen hostage doctor where the games last 30 mins a piece and you are only playing to keep them in madness and not to down survivors?  They generally start suiciding into you just to make the stalemate end?  If that's what you do it's the cancer version of a legitimate 3 gen strat.
---
Doesn't matter it's rendered useless now. Maybe we should complain about NOED and get that rendered useless so we're balanced.

Okay thanks. &lt;3

fuck i hope it's just a bug and not an intended change

Oh of course the add on is still good, I'm just saying it's easier to tell now that you've used a styptic.
---
Trapper: Oh, you're undoing my trap?
---
Survivor: AAAAHHH!!!
---
Trapper: In that case try as long as you'd like.
---
Literally just one of those blue aliens from those comics in a myers outfit
---
&gt; So that might also be 3K for every hook?
---
I didn't pay attention :( Played like a potato and just didn't look.
---
But in the past it was 4500 for a gen and 5500 for a hook, so who knows
---
Leatherface: “Then why you running, huh? WHY YOU RUNNING?!?”
---
I was trying to pick repair 2 gens, restarting the game fixed it for whatever reason.
---
Tysm tho
---
Awesome. Have fun :D
---
Yeah but in that situation you did 4 gens, and on the moris situation he did only a third of his job
---
I’m on pc. Not the best setup so I run like 60 FPS every day I play, until today where I’m at 20...
---
&gt; 3k BP for event hooks.
---
sad times
---
Yes it is still possible, but it's weaker now. This change only helps bad killers while hurting those that know what they are doing.
---
Not really. He’s saying he’s doing a support build just saying that solidarity is garbage compared the the three I mentioned. Every perk in the build is great just not solidarity
---
Took me 8 games to do adept plague. 7 of them had someone dc intentionally or kill themself on first hook. Haven’t tried for another since.
---
You can level up infinitely from 50 and get all the new perks from those webs. I dont bother prestiging my characters anymore and just give through the 50+ webs
---
UPDATE THE BOOK!!! NEW RULE 1954: CRY IN BASEMENT WITH ON GEN!
---
No problem. Enjoy the event and archives :)
---
The pinky finger is pretty balanced for a pink addon, it only works with a direct hit and last 3 seconds, so you can be hit and still drop a pallet
---
It’s because of the event. When you complete event gens you get bonus BP
---
Toxic Gen camping killers are ruining this game, they should all be banned and executed
---
It removes 4 hatchets, so it does trump all addons.
---
This comment was lost in Hawkins lab
---
I only know what the Mori symbol is I have no idea what the rest are :)
---
Restart the game. If you're brand new, you have to complete the tutorials which only take 3 mins each.  OR if you're on console and downloading the game, the download hasn't completed yet.
---
No idea they didn't say
---
😘
---
Idk man i just can play hiding and doing gens. No way I can run the killer. Its impossible
---
Yes if you still feel this powerless after a year plus of survivor nerf updates I am telling you point blank you're just a bad killer.  Own your losses and take responsibility for the bad plays causing them.  Or don't continue blaming unbalanced survivors as the boogeyman and continue losing games until you eventually quit the community.  Either way works.
---
The whole battle pass bad mentality is not a good thing, just because fortnite did it first doesn't mean it's a cheap or bad way to get money.
---
Infact I'd argue it's just the opposite, a 10 dollar pass that gives you a bunch of stuff worth more than 10 dollars AND if you play it enough you get all your money back which can be used to buy another premium track.
---
That's an absolutely awesome way to promote constant play and more money to support the devs, and even if you don't get the premium track it's still free cosmetics.
---
They’ll be way cheaper if you unlock them in the pass.
---
That was a thing on PTB. AFAIK, devs said it was unintentional, but it seems like they didn't have time to fix it.
---
Is your game only partially installed? On PS4 it downloads a "playable" section of just the tutorial and help menus then you have to wait for the rest to actually play the game.
---
A bit of context, the gens were finished quite fast and to be honest, I didn't do a great job. But thanks to pop and the survivors focusing on two gens (and the 3 gens not being too far away from each other) I was able to kill 3 of them, but apparently you're not supposed to patrol the gens?
---
&gt;No, the red stain going through walls was never a part of mind games 
---
Yes it very much was, I've used it on a daily basis dude.
---
&gt;when it's going through the wall, the survivor has wall hacks
---
You can just look away from the wall? They only see what you allow them to see, if you want them to think you are going in a different direction then you show them the light through the wall. Light being visible through walls is only a detriment if you are lazy and don't think about what you're doing.
---
&gt;shouldn't you be happy we can play on higher settings without an in game disadvantage?
---
I won't be playing on high settings anyway, why would I gimp myself like that? This game is badly optimized, even on strong computers you will get a lot of stutter. High settings also make everything darker, I have enough annyoances with trying to spot blendettes as it is. If you care about being at a disadvantage you definitely don't want using high settings.
---
When is it on PS4?
---
My usual strat (since I have every achievement already) is play the new DLC, enjoy the content, get the achievements, then wait for a rank reset or two to easily get the Adept achievement.
---
I thought rank 11 was low enough but apparently, even with 4Ks, I'm still not getting enough, it wants me to have iridescent everything.
---
Myers would find a way
---
He always, finds a way
---
bring back icky flowers!
---
really all i care about this year is hoarding spooky flashlights
---
It has uses, but there are just so many loops where it can’t do anything. Unless the survivors are braindead
---
Yes my good man! They are on the bloodwebs and I’ve also found the spooky flashlight in a chest!
---
I now believe in the conspiracy that Bhvr delayed the update until this meme was thought of, no matter how much evidence goes against it.
---
You can
---
Ok, just thought I’d mention it in case you didn’t know. I don’t know of a dbd lore subreddit, maybe you should make one. I’d join it
---
The DC rant has been going on for a long time. I think we’re beating a dead horse.
---
Not a nerf, it's a tradeoff.
---
I imagine so?
---
Feng is so cute omg
---
I hope this means there will be different types of traps
---

---
Dam who at BHVR Hooking you up?
---
That's what I thought. It's barely anything.
---
You have to use a pustula as a offering, if you don't you won't have any points , just like survivors.
---
So they delayed the event and still didn’t release all the cosmetics epic company

objective points are in the survivor category though, you can't get any normally
---
yes bro thank you for the valid reasoning as to why they're getting hate for something they cant control u should be a philosopher or something
---
I imagine it’s using a different category just in case the normal category is maxed. That way you always get the 1000.
---
I understand not healing before the last gen but it seems like (in higher ranks) half of the survivors refuse to heal anyone at all. It gets so annoying
---
Close your eyes?
---
That's literally what they were before. I'm still not sure what the devs were thinking about by doing this because we know for sure that some Killers in general are terrible at achieving Merciless to start with due to lack of map pressure, chase potential, or slowing the game down because their perks/powers don't allow for much of it all at once.
---
I always wait for an event to prestige to avoid this.
---
Event based bonus BP show up as Objective points for Killer as well for some reason. They just get added on your total at the end.
---
120% movement speed.
---
Very well, but I might had messed up my wording. Not victims but not entirely evil, sure like 90% of them were/commit/participated in war crimes but no all of them, or at least not willingly
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
nice
---
I like, I like!
---
You know what would've gone REALLY well with that Clown skin? Bunn-
---
If it doesnt show what the killer has. I think that means its a mori
---
then leave
---
Maybe LeatherFace?
---
Or a splinter
---
I think it's going to turn into a farm fest tbh. I have either run into really sweaty killer matches as a survivor or as a killer survivors just not playing for the win and only for challenges. Hopefully it's only temporary but tbh dc's have always been a problem and I doubt there will be much the devs do about it.
---
BC his recently uploaded Shrine Watch video is outdated.
---
I can't cleanse your ruin without undoing your trap
---
You can kinda see her eye, it's well lined up
---
You can just search the subreddit and find a bunch of threads about how both are "crutch" perks. I obviously meant it as a jab at how whiny players are because those perks aren't op at all.
---
I know, I've enjoyed his changes. It's just I so rarely see him in my games and when I do, he isn't played well so it still surprised me lol
---
That's ironic.
---
I feel like that’s what they were hoping to prevent by having Dedicated Servers out in Summer and then the Archives out in Fall. Any DC’s that occur wouldn’t necessarily mess with your challenges from the Archives if the “Survivor DC husk” had been implemented. 
---
For example there’s a challenge in a later Tome where as Killer you have to Sacrifice all 4 Survivors in the Basement in the same match and I can imagine salty DC’s preventing you from being able to do it.
---
Dbd is a free mobile game
---
They are just cosmetics man. They are in no way comparable to mobile microtransactions imo.
---
It can be toxic, but once you've spent enough time in the game you become numb to it. Anyone can have courage on the internet, and at the end of the day, it's just some unknown stranger i've never met and they don't deserve my time. I don't even respond to the toxicity.
---
If I can get my daily rituals done, I don't care if I miss out on a 4k, or even get a 1k. Its an extra 20k - 30k BP in my bank.

Why did that last comment make me think of Flowey
---
Ik, it's not like it says camp hooks and chase the same survivor, it's a legit tutorial. Idk why people moan about basic killr strategies
---
More like guess you'll dc lol
---
Hello there
---
Bruh you have to stay away from unfinished gens, the killer can only be near FINISHED generators, didnt you know???
---
I'm just fucking sick of this "tryhard" insult. Like people have nothing else to say and blame you for trying to win. So hypocritical and annoying
---
Exactly my issue here. For now the first couple of challenges are pretty lenient and can be done across multiple games, but once it comes to getting kills with basement builds and using NOED all in one game, shot will be near impossible without those husks :/
---
My headcanon is that Doc and Nurse eventually marry, and spend their retirement treating the more insane simpletons of the Hookers club, like Leatherface and Hillbilly. I suppose Myers would make sense too.
---
First time playing against Trapper be like:
---
Wow what a good banner image!
---
115 with 24 tr isn’t a great idea. There’s a reason the smaller tr killers are slower
---
Spine chill instead of resil. You can get the unhook sometimes without even risking 2 hits
---
I dont understand why they arent doing the same for Trapper, Wraith and Clown. Why cant they hold their power in the selection screen?
---
I mean, now i have incentive to play until i finish the pass, so i can get the next basically for free
---
So its 2 full passes for the price of one
---
Did this reset today or somethin? ruin isnt in my shrine?
---
Trapper: Survivor or killer?
---
As if Ghostface mains used the rarest addons.
---
Me neither, but at least I can't take it seriously :D
---
Feel free to use it.

I am perfectly capable of ignoring cosmetics, been doing that since they released the auric cells store.
---
I might buy some cosmetics with shards in the future, but I am ignoring the battle pass and every cosmetic in the store because I dont feel like spending real money on some additional colorful pixels, specially on killers when you dont see them yourself unless you do a mori... if the killer has a 3rd person mori.
---
The steam workshop has a lot of legalese and has everything already written out and ready to fight any legal issues.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if there was a section that said:
---
*"-- and if we feel like it we can also kick your mother in the shins at any point in time."*
---
Plus, the workshop (in terms of TF2 and such) tend to shaft its creators. Kinda like Youtube!
---
What did you use for the coat?  
---
Planning on doing a Ghostface cosplay in 2020!
---
Even the new hooks and gens look sad as fuck. At least last year we had the glowy and animated pustulas to look at.
---
What are you talking about lmfao. 
---
I said the lawyer did pretty much the *BEST* possible thing you can do in that situation. 
---
The WORST thing to do in a shooting scenario is run flat out in the open. 
---
Did you reply to the wrong comment?
---
Aside from the DLC that is also in the game, cosmetics are still a form of game progression and part of the game. Locking almost all cosmetics behind a paywall and leaving poor peasants with just expensive recolors and prestige clothing leaves them with almost no content in that department. That's a really big issue when there's only a few departments. Killer progression, Survivor progression, cosmetic progression, and now the Battle Pass progression. If you aren't coughing up a considerable amount of cash in one of those departments, you get almost nothing to do in them.
---
It's damn good, but the fact is that no one can top Santa Claus. same with Doc's Hallowed Blight outfit.
---
Thanks, it really was stressful to decide when to engage in a chase, can I commit and down them or only injure them, when do I need yo go back to break the other gens, but it was somehow fun
---
There are no double bloodpoints though.
---
Look at it from this perspective: at least they let you buy the cosmetic you want and you get the full set, instead of going the loot box route. It’s consumer friendly (even though the cosmetics themselves are expensive). Plus you dont have to spend money as it’s just cosmetic items, not p2w mobile garbo

That dude will probably kill you at this point if he gets the chance.

Even professionals, police and soldiers will point blank fire a weapon and miss from literally 2 feet away.

But they dont effect gameplay so it isnt pay2win

Low fucking key, keep it low.

Freddy is the best killer in the game right now, as far as abilities go his is the most useful in any game he’s in, the one thing survivors *have* to do is gens. And not only does Freddy teleport (one of the strongest abilities to have) he teleports straight to a generator, I main pig and legion, but when I get a few bad games I just throw on Freddy and get 4-4K games in a row. My Freddy is p1 at lvl 38 rn, he has no add one in his inventory or any non-map offerings left, I challenged myself to clear his inventory, I run Remember Me! Fired up, No One Escapes Death, and Thrilling tremors. As long as the obsession dies before the last gen pops is basically a guaranteed 3-4 k. The only time I *ever* get less than 2 sacs/kills with Freddy is if a survivor uses a key. He is hands down the absolute best killer in this game. But I want to keep this info low key as possible because the devs will absolutely nerf him if they realize how good he is.
---
or separating all survivors
---
Yeah they may still be good without It but there’s no harm in having one.  LITERALLY 0.  It actually helps the developers especially games that aren’t made by huge companies, really helps them stay dedicated to games
---
Right its so obvious! Its way too unfair how the killer can see unfinished gens and survivors have to search them, the killer should have to search too! xD
---
The survivor community is SUPER toxic. I don't think you did anything wrong. Why would you go far away from the hooked guy if it was right by an exit and there was only one player left? That wouldn't be a smart play by you.
---
Indeed, You can't be near exit gates either that's just cheating dude, Actually you know that place you spawned at?, you're only aloud to be there and nowhere else, Might as well
---
Dude, rift isn't active right now. People started at different levels so they're fixing that
---
honestly this meme made it all worth it. good post OP
---
It just makes sense!
---
You first get this game and you’re picking a survivor to main after reading their lore/perks.
---
You wanna be altruistic and help the team? Of course you’d pick Dwight!
---
You’re scared and wanna run away and LIVE? Everything about Meg screams “pick me!”
---
never said running away is better.
---
also yes :/
---
Yeah, I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about, this helps mindgames. And leaves killers who hold w completely unaffected, please elaborate
---
You dare put Susie Paloozy in the "No" category.?Wait you also put The Spirit in 'No'? Tape covering naughty bits Spirit?

I just recently started playing killer after 450 hours surviving. I got pop goes the weasle, ruin, BBQ, infectious fright, spirit fury from 3 consecutive shrines. I'm just sad I missed discordance from 4 weeks ago.
---
Yeah as a GF main I’m really excited for swf’s now. One of them is bound to run it if they’re on comms.
---
Steve's kinda giving me Doc Ock vibes.
---
Anyway, I'm so excited for this set. I've never seen Stranger Things, but I bought Steve just so I can rock that outfit. I wish they also included the red bandanna though, even if it's around his neck.
---
Honestly it isn’t that bad lmao. It’s just become a huge meme at this point and I happened to have a life sized skeleton. You should get it :)

uhhhh why they look.....like that

---
That's weird, they said on twitter there was an error with progression so they disabled it temporarily. Is it already fixed?
---
Not nice
---
Won't be able to get on for a while. Did they add ghost face's new outfit?
---
Slowing the match down is one of the objectives of a killer as well as injuring and hooking. How is a perk rewarding the killer for doing their basic objectives an oppurtunity based perk?
---
Not bang how cute they are
---
Yes. I did it myself earlier.
---
You still need to look at them to gain power.
---
He just sounds like one of those generic serial podcasts that are on spotify. I’m half expecting a plug for some murder mystery subscription package half way through. Could always be worse. Could you imagine if they got Chills (burger king foot lettuce)
---
Yee. Like an hour after they posted it. It was brought back up :)
---
Crows respawn every 20 seconds. Disturbing one crow 25 times should only take...let me check my math...way too fucking long to bother.
---
So what do you suggest? Just wait and let them finish?
---
That's why 'toxic' behaviour is canon - it feeds Entity more!
---
Damn, that was quick. And here I am getting annoyed. Thanks for letting me know, they should've mentioned it was fixed on their Twitter too
---
"hmm" mmm" "mhm"
---
Ty for the lore BHVR.
---
GG on the voices.
---
lol its mine, I forgot what they looked like and was too lazy to look it up
---
You have to buy at least 2 more of this game to unlock every killer with game changing effects, and unless to want to wait and save indefinitely for licensed survivor perks to appear on the shrine then you have to pay for another copy of this game to unlock all game altering content.
---
Yeah, so basically Archives official start date was two weeks ago instead of today. 
---
Typical BHVR shit, used to it by now.
---
I did it on PC earlier - maybe try restarting?
---
It also has to be a "safe" unhook for it to count. So if they get downed again quickly you won't get credit. Also both safe unhooks must be during the same match.
---
Same. Each time there’s an upcoming event I have a p3 level 1 character waiting. This way you can collect a ton of special items and offerings. I also leave the bloodweb at 99% on all characters so that when there’s a new event I only have 1-2 things to redeem before a new blood web shows up. I have over 100 petal offerings from last year among all my surivors and killers
---
Round up all the gen-campers, take em outside, and put em down. It’s the only way to eliminate such scum for good
---
**1**
---
Yeah. I guess it was recording data since oct 18th so people were getting progress for things they had done before today...just not after the "official" start of the event lol. I started at rift rank 10 and they let me keep it.
---
OP you could have at least grabbed this from my twitter or tumblr so it's not such shit quality lol
---
or a paddlin.
---
As in using it right in the match, yea probably. Though in terms of just stockpiling them for future use it seems better, especially if you start bringing add-ons or using botany knowledge with it.

Yes, I did multiple unhooks in the same game, DIDN'T COUNT! And yes, they were "safe". In one particular game, all 4 of us escaped (including 2 players I unhooked) and it STILL didn't count!

Me, except on the meat factory one.
---
Welp off to hang myself
---
Like Epstein? /s
---
i would make one but i don't know how to make sub reddits. still might try though.
---
I finished that one just fine earlier (on PS4) with no issues

*He smiles at death, knowing that he will survive. If he keeps a hold of his will, he will never be cast out by the Entity. He smiles knowing that most of the abominations are forced to do this.*
---
*Ace will stand the test of time...*
---
Right, but I’m specifically talking about scratched mirror myers, and by the time you’re stalking them most good survivors will see you and start running anyway.
---
T1 Myers without mirror doesn’t last long anyway so I wouldn’t say it’s that significant.
---
It's not meant to be art of a date, it's Laurie unnerved because she knows Mikey's behind her dressed.... like that. OP just reposted w/o my comments.
---
This made me laugh. 
---
Out loud.
---
Well done.
---
I didn't get ruin in time :(
---
I’ve been dc’d three times now, great game
---
Ace will be the only survivor to resist the entity and not lose hope. Everyone else will fall
---
They did lol
---
Yeah, I should just not share my own work because people NEED the clout of reposting it.
---
The trick to Hawkins is just knowing where the portal room is with the glass to where the hole in the ceiling is. Nothing else really matters.
---
I have it on ps4
---
I'd just prefer the heads to apply the broken status effect for some time, adding that with making it trump other addons may be balanced or too weak...not sure yet
---
the people who got extra ranks just had their progress carried over from the PTB, that was the issue, something that's never happened before which is probably why they didnt think to test it
---
Maybe game tries to tell you something?
---
*try to get person to heal me right before we finish the gen*
---
*person proceeds to finish gen anyway(AKA free killer notification) and* ***THEN*** *begin healing me*
---
This is your brain on jake
---
In this scenario OP is using, self care is one of the worst options for this situation. The priority should be busting out that last gen, especially if the killer has even a somewhat good 3-gen.
---
The Wraith
---
**HITS BELL FURIOUSLY**
---
This looks really good
---
I keep getting kicked after about a minute with the game saying I need Internet to play.
---
Honestly this might be the straw that breaks the camels back for me. I am so tired of the games issues at this point.
---
I haven't been able to do ONE match fully this week.
---
It’s part of the Rift pass
---
Here’s a video, for anyone that hasn’t seen:

Oh nice, thank u
---
Cheers 😁
---
You would move tiers by earning a new currency that I forgot the name of. I think that you get some by playing matches and by completing challenges in the archives.
---
Everyone can play the game the way they want to, yes. But there really isn't any point in hardcamping unless the killer actively wants to make the survivor players mad and feel bad irl, because as far as the game is concerned, the killer barely loses anything even in the worst case where he can't even get a single hit on another survivor and the hooked guy escapes.
---
If the survivors ARE a tryhard swf, they WILL get the save, but if they are just a bunch of randoms, it's just gonna make them feel powerless and slowly they'll either become toxic or just outright quit the game.
---
As for survs trying to make you chase them, if they were the hooked guy, they wouldn't want their team to just abandon them, so they'll try to help, not because they are certain they can escape, but because they want to at least try, and if they get killed instead but the other guy gets out, often they'll be fine with that result, because at least they got to do something about it.
---
Fact is, the single kill isn't gonna do anything for the killer, if there was a 5k reward for killing the first survivor then sure, I could understand it. But as it stands it only serves to piss people off and benefits no one.
---
Plus, I'm quite confident that the times you'll get people mindlessly suiciding into the camp and turning a 1k into a 3-4k is lower than the times you'd get the same result by letting them be altruistic and chasing and hooking them one by one even with the exits open.
---
where is everyone getting the fact that they knew 100% that it wasn't going to be on time? they'd have no reason to lie about it, it'd literally only hurt them, i don't understand where this is coming from. the fact that they fixed it in a couple of days tells me there really was some "unforeseen circumstances" preventing them from making it on time. i do agree about the "poor business practice and poor community management" part, though, they should've atleast done something to make up for this.
---
Quintin have too much narcotics
---
I haven't played at all with these syringe/styptic changes at all, but on first glance Styptic Agent will now have some similarity to Dead Hard. Use it before being hit to secure distance for a vault or a pallet. This could get annoying if the survivor themselves have DH afterwards. 
---
It's kind of funny to me that Hillbilly and LF could hard counter old styptic agent with their power in some scenarios but now they can't (unless the survivor is in a bad, open spot to wait out the 8 seconds).
---
As for Syringe - I think people are overexaggerating the timer a bit. If you heal right after being hit in a safe spot and have dead hard as backup, it can be pretty powerful. 
---
In the end though, it'll require more skill from the survivors to pull these off compared to the old ones. 
---
Btw, can you still use these add-ons on downed survivors? If so, what happens when you Styptic someone?
---
Theirs something  about spirit that makes me wanna tangle  with her even tho ill die
---
the purple is better than the pink lol
---
For the millionth time, a simple google search would give you the proper info you need. instead of using reddit as yahoo answers give your question a simple google search
---
The trap from Saw 6 would be cool to use
---
Well ruins in the shrine of secrets i suggest you get it
---
Maybe the trap that whats her name used to try and kill hothman? Or is that the one your talking about?
---
It's possible your left stick is drifting, try blowing out the housing around it with canned air.
---
you just roll in from late town or something buddy
---
Scupes ehoi!
---
That’s the one. RBT 2.0 is what it’s referred to as, I believe
---
Dwight hired Frank Castle and Shane to kill the Killer
---
That’s why you don’t loop the huntress
---
If you google bannable offenses you will see some people say it will get you banned and others say it wont. I dont think that's officially a clear enough answer. I do it all the time too but it doesnt mean anything. I honestly want a clear for sure answer right now if you think you have one.
---
The Rob Zombie remakes of Haloween 1 and 2 had him played by a blonde kid and man respectively. That's probably why. If you like Halloween I do recomend checking out that 2007 Remake though. While not great, it does try to give a reason for Mike's blood lust and keeps the embodiment of evil but while ditching the dumb cult bs
---
Maybe we could put charms on the trap and thats why she holds it differently now? Also I'd love to have new BHVR own traps
---
he doesn't even have to use google reddit has a search feature and we all know that this question has been asked before
---
Myers is also the living embodiment of Evil
---
steven clean your room
---
New player here, so don't be rude, but what are the archives
---
Doesn't mean anyone knows what it does
---
So you mean to tell me I can have both ruin and BBQ &amp; Chili in the same week?....fuck ya man.
---
That's definitely a possibility. But if that was the case, then they should have provided more clarity as to the nature of the issues. I've heard something about a power outage, which isn't an excuse since they should have constant backups.
---
I fully believe that the software developers are working as hard as they can, and are extremely stressed right now. But the blame most likely falls on the managers that decided to tie this event to the patch, and the community managers that have been basically ignoring the problem. And whomever's responsible for not starting a double-bloodpoint event while we wait.
---
Wasn't it always like this ?
---
I just now noticed he has a bunch of fingers in his front pocket. 😆
---
That would be cool. It would also be cool if they could make her hold them in game, too. It would make her at least a little more intimidating. Also some of the charms could be a Jigsaw piece, Billy’s head, a Pig charm, etc. there are so many possibilities
---
No one is worthy of 3 David, let alone 1.
---
ah, totally misunderstood what they had meant by progression, thought it was about the rift itself not the ranks
---
From my experience and what I’ve heard from others, there is way less face camping. I don’t know about toxicity because I’ve only played on PC. Also, the game runs wayyyyy better. (Depends on your pc of course).
---
Frame rates
---
That sucks to hear. He is fun to play, and fun to play against. I hope that changes for you.
---
I mean.. fortnite at least is f2p unlike DbD
---
i used to play it exclusively on ps4 but recently got it on pc and the translation from controller felt natural as the controller are in my case essentially perfect
---
Yeah kill just means to make dead, you can hook, mori, let them bleed out, etc
---
But you camped after downing the Kate....

Ditto
---
I know, I mentioned that, but the shrine is "random" so you never know if/when the licensed perks are coming up and have no way to plan how many shards you will have around when they do randomly come up.  You could be waiting months or years to get every DLC teachable and you may miss them when they come up.
---
I only dc if a killer is being toxic.
---
Detective's hunch comboed with a green map with the purple add on is phenomenal for showing your teammates totem, gen, and chest locations.
---
Same for me. This needs to get seen by someone at bhvr because people will not be happy about this if it isn’t corrected (I assume it will be though)
---
They're strong, but I don't care if they're used against me. Several games in a row is pretty frustrating. I try not to go down more than once anyway. I only use them for dailies. There aren't any dailies tied to keys.
---
Actually the killer did 2 thirds (maybe 3 fifths) since the got the second down.
---
Yes, it's only one at a time. But it's not even blue for me to select, even if I pause the survivors' challenges.
---
I guess I'll just send a ticket to them.
---
3 man Lobby Still a thing!!!!!!!
---
What confuses you?
---
The main outfit for Myers is just the Robe and the Knife. The screwdriver and the pipe are just kinda on their own.
---
why was this downvoted
---
spirit mains are downvoting anyone saying this, i would 2 B)
---
I think this study is only working cuz ppl arent reflecting. You seem like you reflect the behaviours of you dad, brother and yourself. You will be cautious enough, to not become like him
---
Yeah, totally agree on the first point. it feels strange when the game has a leave button, but don’t warn you or punish you when you quit and screw the game. GTA servers does not require a certain number of people to function, so even if the player base is split by “prison” it is not detrimental. Different scenario for DBD tho.
---
Your post made my brain turn itself off for 60 seconds
---
Wrong. I already made the math and it doesn't relate to the number of hooks, but rather the time since DS and a lot of other factors are denied by moris
---
Ever since the last update and matchmaking has been messed up I've gone up against a lot of trappers and hags. A few legions, 4 spirits 1 clown a camping leatherface and some myers. Is it like a specific rank I have to be to increase my chance of seeing someone play one?
---
Precious bb
---
I used to be a spirit main, until I realized how broken she was so I switched to other killers so it be fair to the survivors
---
Then don’t buy the premium pass if you only play as one character
---
As Doctor drag the game out to a certain length of time or have survivors fail a certain number of Overcharge skill checks.
---
&gt;You can easily escape against a Spirit 
---
My guess is that every character is going to get a plot through the rift eventually. This time it's a huge Claudette and trapper focus, who knows for next time.
---
But I'm not sure there is a reason for you to buy the premium one. I'm not even sure how many auric cells it costs, it might not pay itself back after like games such as fortnight do.
---
Edit: forgot to actually answer your question.
---
I tried to protect the hook, as you can see she gets a save a minute when I leave her. I wasn't camping the whole game and was actively changing targets. And they opened exit gates and just weren't leaving. So there wasn't much I could do, because one of them literally tried to loop me next to the hook, and the other ones were camping it and waiting for me to leave. So it's a reliable strategy that gave me two downs, so you can say they even rewarded a camper, which is sucks because it wasn't really fun
---
It would say by your hand if it was a mori. It says "by any means". It's not the same as sacrifice, sacrifice is only the hooks, by your hands is mori, kill by any means is everything (mori, hooks, bleeding to death, DC (?) )
---
It’s not horrible. Still better than the current one. One idea is a 3rd person Mori where the camera is facing upward in front of the survivor. The Wraith comes out of cloaking and holds the weapon above his head and swings it down onto the survivor. It gets stuck so the Wraith steps on the survivor and tugs at it, eventually pulling it off
---
WAAAZZAAAAAAAAAAP!!!!!
---
Or receive a certain amount of death threats
---
(Insert survivor telling them what perks they’re not allowed to use)

You don't tho. I can't make auric cells become euros, those money are lost
---
Without counting **IF** you finish the entire battle pass you get the cells back. Big if for how grindy this game is, worse than a mmo
---
Is greedy period. You have to pay for the game, for the characters and perks to be able to be competitive AND after that you have to grind your ass off to get those perks
---
It's greedy. This isn't a f2p game, to just get all chars you have to spend more than 100$. So yeah, it's greedy
---
Dead hard is broken. I’m getting exhausted and it’s not working. Also getting hit through pallets and around corners with hatchets more than normal. Dedicated servers ruining this game for me.
---
I would already be at 5 today!

Are you braindead? He said he plays for fun, why do you think he cares about EULA you pathetic moron?
---
"Is three a lot?"
---
"Depends on the context."
---
Sooooo are the shines different on console? Those are not the perks in mine.
---
Orange man bad
---
Yes hahaha, was me, then one of them said that was bannable, so he was reporting, was just a salty guy, doing that isnt toxic at all, i gave u props that match even
---
Can anyone hate scary movie?
---
What I'm wondering is how his power would be and work.
---
Maybe a slam/smash like attack that needs to be charged?
---
Anyone else getting a lot more infinite loading screens with this new update? It happens after a match ends and you try and leave to go back to the menu. I get one every 2nd/ 3rd game, and it's really annoying to constantly open up task manager to close it
---
I guess only killers will be using OP stuff. News to me.
---
Some killers slug the 3rd person to avoid the hatch 1v1. If it comes down to the killer and the last person, it becomes a game of who can find the hatch first. If the killer slugs the third person, the hatch won’t open and the killer can focus on hunting the 4th
---
I'm actually having a problem claiming the next mission for the killer. It says I claimed it, but I havent? like, none of the rewards have been given.
---
It wouldnt be worth it if you only play one character.
---
Are they you know gona monetize it?
---
I don't know myself
---
._.
---
I...
---
I never noticed this before but now I can't stop thinking about it...
---
I'm all for the removal of Mori's as well to be honest. I've just run into more Insta-Heals than Moris.
---
"At the moment" sounds to me like a polite way to say: "no, never"
---
Very neat, whatever it means! 
---
That must be on the other side where the entity takes you? 
---
Maybe a survivor up there as a sleeper agent trying to kill the entity or seal it off?
---
That's right
---
Fun Fact: Since its release 3 years ago, Ruin has appeared in roughly 7% of shrines. Since its release 2 years ago, Barbecue and Chili has appeared in 2% of shrines. It is for that reason that I get frustrated when people say "lul but shrine makes it so you can get them for free" without even thinking about how unfair it is for "free" users. Thank you for doing more than what most people can/won't do, which is using your brain. It is a serious breath of fresh air to see someone who actually thinks about and understands the actual odds of getting a DLC perk you need in this game. Updoot to you, fine fellow.
---
At the moment everyone is spamming the devs to buff current Legion when he's fine right now.
---
Thank you &lt;3 you are doing gods work
---
"How can we make a killer based on secretly stalking survivors easier to see?"
---
"A glowing white hospital gown and SUPER glowing untanned feet!"
---
The equivalent to a mori is a key so it is balanced to an extent. Not completely balanced but counter the key and vice versa
---
Agreed. You ever watch Fungoose? I love that guy’s videos and he plays a great Leatherface with that perk. Fungoose sells me on a lot of killer’s I normally wouldn’t like.
---
I'll get to it eventually - just been going through some hard times so i'm a little busy.

I assume it’s the archives everyone and their mother wants to unlock everything
---
Your friend had a better gaming chair than you
---
It's not a typo, you have to do it in a single match, that's why its 0/1
---
The patch made it so they DON’T work on stealth killers now :D
---
No, he’s not fine right now, easily the second worst killer in the game. I’ve mained them since release
---
I wonder if I’m the David on the right. :o sweet summer child dweeet
---
A perk that can be easily countered and will leave the killer with 3 perks is OP? What has this community come to
---
I want a Medea survivor who gets one good backhand at the killer like a weaker preemptive dstrike.
---
&lt;3
---
I taught English as a second language. Let me try to translate. 
---
Survivors express their lament over so-called overpowered perks and skills, but the objective is not to see them weakened. No. That would be too simple. It’s something far more complex than that. The goal is to coerce killers, fatigued and dismayed by the protests of survivors, to provide their adversaries with viable strategies. Thus, the survivors are empowered by their foes with the knowledge needed to defeat them. It is a nefarious plot. I now look beyond the skein, and I cannot unsee it. 
---
I think that’s pretty close.
---
Wouldn't that mean faster queue times due to more people playing?
---
She would work as either I think, which would be funny
---
My shrine is...totally different. Is that suppose to happen?
---
What am I looking at?
---
The creatorshave  livestreamed the creation of it, please point out where they are sampling other music.
---
He’s actually the best killer to start off as. Not just because of BBQ. His entire ability relies on survivors fucking up. With using his power you learn what is safe and what isn’t safe. I would recommend anyone new to buy Leatherface and play their first few games as him.
---
It’ll even help you as survivor, knowing what is and what isn’t a dead zone.
---
more ways to get stuff and push you to spend money.  go check em out
---
hilarious
---
I can't read the title without using junkrats voice
---
What the hell? What is this?
---
Hex totems being protected heavily? If a killer is doing nothing but guarding his totem do gens! Your wasting your own time
---
I dont think Legion is in any place to be called bad or worse. I started playing Legion straight after the rework and he's defidently one of the best killers if you know what you're doing. What's your main build for Legion?
---
For now we'll only get it through xp, later on they'll release part 2/3/4 which we'll just continue getting the rift shards from.
---
I thought those were only master challenges? He's like tier 3 so there definitely isn't one this early. It's most likely a typo due to coming up with specifics for a large sum of values, "Survivor/s" could of been a placeholder
---
Hmm that's weird, I just played another game because it went down to 5 out of 6 and then it gave me my rewards.
---
I main Feng, so i get it a little.  
---
Still, it's worth it for the charms. There's a little pink arcade machine charm that fits Feng, i think.
---
What do the charms do? I’ve never played during an event before.
---
&gt;one of the best killers
---
No, all they do is get some easy injures and a bit of slowdown. Otherwise it’s poundtown for them
---
Ruin
---
Bbq
---
Sloppy
---
PGTW or Thanataphobia
---
I really like Ghostface at the moment. Can't wait to get the original costume cosmetic.
---
I think that might be this alchemist we've been hearing about
---
Aaaaannd now I'm sad
---
Chaos is a good word to describe it. Lol nice strategically placed chaos.
---
I live in the country and we have slow internet. The update started on time, but I don't think I'll finish downloading until tomorrow morning.
---
Peace be with my fellow Slow Internet Brethren.
---
Depends, did you play against a hag tonight? :o
---
I’m pretty sure this is a repost from when the dlc first came out, either that or it’s VERY similar
---
Ypu may have accidentally loaded into kill your friends. Or at least the game thought so
---
Unironicly yes.
---
wow. this is so cool😱
---
To top it off steam said the update "cancelled" and now it's re downloading the whole game. This happens every second dbd update for me.
---
Honestly I feel like a new game mode would kill queue times even more. Not sure it’s such a good idea, at least not before the possibility of cross play. But yeah, survivors should have more variety when it comes to animations
---
You have my full respect for not having STBFL in your build, it already shows you're not delusional. My best build is BBQ, Thrilling, Sloppy and thanataphobia
---
Yep, the game glitched
---
Happens to me every once in a while. Frustrating.
---
Lol I had a game of a Nea wanting to heal me with Sloppy Butcher and Thnatophobia Legion. I come to help her on the last gen being 75% done and she gets off the gen to attempt to heal me when one survivor is dead and the other is the obsession being chased. Luckily the Obsession and I were good at chases but we can't last games when everyone wants to heal unless the killer makes gigantic mistakes.
---
It's not easily countered at all this community has come to defending an overpowered perk because they want it to remain over poweted
---
I never got why people ran STBFL on legion, most of the time you use FF to injure them anyway
---
That would be a glitch I’m pretty sure, I would report it to the dev team on their tech support to prevent any possible banning due to a glitch. Are you in kill your friends or just regular killer?
---
I don’t know which one of them got the worst situation. 
---
Plague for eternal sickness perhaps?
---
At least you're getting half games. I've yet to even get a minute into one haha
---
ill be sure to check him out :)
---
Not if there's more survivors playing survivor than killer
---
I agree, whole heartedly.
---
But I NEED those sweet, sweet internet points so I'm going to go make another lazy meme.
---
the equivalent to an instaheal is the exposed effect. bet they won't change it tho
---
Anyone who has played the game since I believe the 18th gets added progression to make up for the delay
---
I clicked regular killer, but it glitches and thought I chose kill your friends
---
I think it’s either every week or every two weeks up to certain point
---
It's literally not a typo tho, it says exactly what you're supposed to do in the picture
---
She ran out of flashlights and started stealing the lighting props from the maps
---
People talking out of their ass giving BHVR more excuses
---
These lazy ass MF!!
---
Archives are permanent I believe
---
She just needs a rework
---
Oh
---
Nice!!
---
It's because you need to do it 2 times in 1 match
---
Event offering
---
Right but you arent forced to spend real money on her
---
Don’t know why iridescent king is there, it’s more of a gimmick than a power card…
---
Killer will be patrolling gates after it pops. Either use Adrenaline or just go somewhere to heal after that is away from the gates. You can lose progress on gens but not gates.
---
+1000 points from event probably
---
Now we just need to blow up Jamie Lee Curtis's Twitter lmao
---
They're just people that don't think, like, at all. The argument is people say "Legion is the best stacker for STBFL" which is true, but Legions not an m1 killer. The m2 completely cancels out the STBFL animation with all 8 stacks and adds an additional mend timer + wallhacks. People who double stab have no relevance in any conversation about him.
---
But it says "survivor master challenge" right there, look at the screenshot
---
Charms are a new type of cosmetics that can only be obtained through the rift. They're just little keychains that can be placed on survivors belts or killers hooks. Once it's gone, i don't think they'll come back.

Specifically "First, in order to support the new features, we needed to update the backend which handles everything behind the scenes, such as: Saving your progress, handling purchases, making matches, and much more. "
---
It sounds like the problem was poor QA, they probably had most things in game working but hadn't spent enough time testing menu/database stuff. Then last minute probably had someone be like "uh.. Guys.."
---
No matter how you spin it, it is their fault. The main point I'm making is it's definitely feasible they weren't aware that the delay would be necessary until they announced it, or right before rather.

I'd rather have keys and moris fixed before insta heals tbh

Yeah, then I would report it, it’s probably a big due to the update going live
---
6gb pc
---
My old flair was ''Triggering salty killers mains''. Changed to DS since i use it to trigger cancer mains like you.
---
Mine was like 6GB on pc
---
I started at tier 3 :(
---
Np, I think that's how a lot of people interpreted what I was saying. Thus the downvotes.

Do it, i'll upvote it. Perhaps i chose badly the Rainbow map.

It was no problem to eat it or juggle before as long as the doors weren't open. All 4 survivors run it now.
---
you must be on console lol
---
Did you get it?
---
I just hope they do switch back cuz I need both ruin and Thanatophobia
---
Tell you what... vigo being a killer, someone who has been a survior become killer... YES PLEASE
---
They out on pc?
---
for few weeks, yes
---
Ash wouldn't need all that, he'd just need a chainsaw and/or Boomstick
---
I legit bought leatherface yesterday cause I was gonna farm for bbq, and then this happens :(

Too much ptsd

so one a week? That seems fast enough, I have about half the tree done already lol

The ranking system exists so you play with people whose playstyles and skill levels are comparable to yours. If you're not having fun playing with those perks, don't play them. If the gens go too fast, stay in the rank you're at and keep playing the perks you wanna play. The meta might work, but what is the point in winning if you didn't have fun doing it? 
---
Tl;Dr: if it aint fun, don't do it. Rank only has as much value as you give it.
---
Personally, self care is only worth using if I'm also using botany knowledge and iron will, and being able to heal myself without immediately getting downed isn't worth giving up 3 perk slots for.
---
Literally every game rn, and my event offering character doesn't have iron will yet :(
---
officially lol
---
Another libtatd OWNED with FACTS and LOGIC in my COUNTRY 😤
---
All Survivors play the same, but for teachables, I'd say the best Survivors would be Claudette, Bill, Nea and Laurie.
---
Killers are different cause of their unique abilities. Most of them are viable, but the ones I mainly play are the Spirit, Doctor and Freddy.
---
Depends on area,rank and everything in between
---
now’s your time bud
---
I feel like console always gets put last, i just wanna game withouy spending 1 mil on an rtxgwksidw3639291 mega processor thing
---
Companies that don’t make money die. In order to do the little things like pay rent, salaries, all that, companies need steady streams of income. You’ll only buy the base game once- they have obligations to meet every day. 
---
You got sixty bucks worth of content when you bought the game. If you want more, you can buy it. They owe you nothing more. It’s not really a complicated concept.
---
Dbd the anime
---
Yeah that’s why I meant sorry for not being clear
---
I feel like I've seen this same meme on this subreddit like 15 times
---
r/dbdgonegay too!!
---
Did they show the Feng Min one?
---
Trust me you don't these dedicated servers... 
---
It's literally a miracle if dead hard works at all
---
Only good killer are afk killer, duh
---
looks amazing!!👍💖
---
I got ruin so I'm roughly 400 shards short atm, but I'll be getting within the next few days!
---
All of those give you bp when tunneled.
---
The elephant clown skin that's going to release eventually, they showed the t-pose render of it today on stream.
---
Ikr, The only other good killer is a Wraith that never uncloakes or a pig that never stands up
---
Just got ruin and dance with me yesterday and shine changed to BBQ 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ I don’t have shards for BBQ now...
---
WHAZZZZZZUPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP scary movie is so funny 😂😂
---
If you go to news and scroll down to where the archives are announced, the release dates for each tome are there
---
It's the elephant clown skin that's going to release eventually, they showed the t-pose render of it today on stream.
---
Darn no I didn’t! I just got excited cause I never play David and had a game with another one and a baby dweet xP
---
Well then take my upvote for being a good person
---
No, you usually had a grace period so if you were placing at your feet say in a doorway you could walk though. It's a slight nerf and hopefully not intended. 
---
Stupid that he steps in his own traps to begin with imho.
---
No idea, they were just showing how it looks.
---
I love this
---
Possibly - I know that he can run at fairly high speeds, so his special attack could be somewhat** similar to Billy’s in travel/speed, with him sprinting and pummeling a survivor and putting them in the dying state on impact. Regular attack could just be a strong left or right hook or punch since a hit from the creature would definitely be enough to injure a survivor. I’m imagining for a Mori that’d he’d lift and hold up the survivor from the back and squeeze their bodies until their bones shattered.
---
That is a master challenge! But it doesn't explain the typo
---
[clickable source](https://kerrtesy.tumblr.com/post/187563664219/honestly-the-jojo-walking-meme-is-what-it-feels)
---
I expect this lore to make it into the archives shortly.
---
They did from the side only I think, then a render without textures and hair
---
preeetty sure dedicated servers won't be on console ever cause of console gaming, not bhbr or dbd. vaguely remember something while researching how the fuck i am supposed to know my NAT type on pc. 
---
also, good PC you can make yourself for around 800-900 USD. 
---
but nevermind this, i'm on PC and i hate dedicated servers because the game is developed for p2p system. the servers we have right now and how the game is optimized for them is atrocious. killers rubberbanding around maps, survivors get hit where they shouldn't be hit. where previously i'd get 4-5 laggy games in 5 hours i get all games with questionable hitboxes, weirdness and still lag despite green ping.
---
Well yes but actually no
---
"Oh, so you still want to teabag me? It appears pigheaded is a trend with Survivors. How ungrateful can you be? You're blatantly ignore your teammate's wishes, even after he gave his life to tell you about to power of my traps. Surely his pathetic pleas warranted a bit of consideration."
---
"I need you closer if I wanna loop your sorry ass to a pulp."
---
"Really? Okay, then. By all means, I'll come closer."
---
~~before anyone says anything, I based these off the lines in the English Dub~~
---
I'm honestly not sure.
---
Sorry
---
Rank don't matter
---
That loop is crap.
---
Nah every pink addon just like pink items are worthless
---
Yeah I just played a match and only got one unhook and completed the challenge. It's a typo
---
Just curious who was the killer as their is currently a bug with Legion's power causing DC's. Not sure how the devs managed that
---
Oh, this is legit? This skin is great
---
Theres no typo, u have to do it (2 safe unhooks) in a single match, thats why it sais 0/1.
---
So glad this isnt a feature on PS.... turned even off the feature that randoms can message me since the game is super toxic
---
Do the survivors and killer spawn in generally the same place every game? As a survivor I noticed I tend to start out near one of the exits 9 times out of 10, those who play killer, do you notice you start in generally the same area?
---
Nurse has been declining since the update on this website lol a lot of spirit I’m playing against
---
" So I just hung out in the corner of the map because I didn't want to see that shit." really stood out for me. Please consider reading this and see if it makes any sense to some part of you:
---

---
Nope! It'll just take a while longer though.
---
Yes, its in the patch notes
---
crying about 4% of the total game makes no sense. Also of that 4% doesn't make them god tier loopers. SWF can easily be beaten only low rank killers cry about swf. facts
---
did you do this?? I love it ❤️
---
It definitely will be Auric Cell available. People will be jumping on this, me included.
---
Ye thats exactly it, my interents not the best but at least i can host a game and have everyone get around 100 oing, everyone elae must have mcdonalds r sum shit
---
I don't think this aged well.
---
That's horrifying
---
Okay, anything else mrs. P3 Claudette?
---
Yeah, there are paths that can only be done by killets, and some only by The Trapper.
---
Tier 1 for me
---
i agree this would be a cool feature but its probably never gonna happen
---
Some practice I had this evening. I like to imagine survivors can get infected too, like c'mon the clown literally wipes his knife on his nasty boils.  
---
Also posting this just to let you know I'll be on vacation for the next week, so there won't be new posts for awhile!
---
Well I mean, I don’t know what to tell you other than acquiring the license for Jason atm is impossible. That’s the reality of it.
---
Not on pc
---
you don't seem to get me here. where previously only some games for both sides were bullshit, now all games are bullshit. i play both sides equally and prior to servers i had no problems with occasional trash killer connection as survivor cause 90% of games were good/decent. now i struggle EVERY survivor game and get cucked with autoaim as killer. 
---
do you really think if there were dedicated servers on console it would have been better?
---
Lmao it’s easy playing killer rn because you’ll find at least 1 person desperately trying get this challenge done
---
I enjoy the hatred. It fuels me.
---
They stated the cosmetics at least will come back six months in the store
---
It’s impossible
---
It's good that it was only delayed for an hour or so.
---
Nah man, crouching pig is kinda op, can't hear her terror radius, please nerf
---
The sick mindgames you can make with prayer beads. Idk why survivors whine, like, just counter the spirit, lol?
---
I did, thank you! :D
---
Yeah double blood points start tommorrow
---
Bruh, ive been rank 10 solo queuing with a rank 20 michael, its very common sadly
---
🤡 🔪
---
LMAO expertly put, thank you!
---
cool, thanks!
---
Yeah, but I'm wondering if they're only gonna return the outfits. Or maybe we'll get charms in the shop later.
---
So much talent, I could never.
---
600 guaranteed points every single game is nice, but I'd like it more if they actually gave queue penalties to people DCing, and didn't allow depips in games with 2x DCs...
---
Thanks - I didn't see anything in the perks section of the notes. Is it a part of the Undetectable status update for killers?
---
I hope although ive been saving for the pass i don't want others to miss out. Which is why im glad the cosmetics will return
---
it is impossible, and while i love jason and friday the 13th, probably end up with a boring killer power like all the other licensed killers
---
Loop is garb.
---
Ok, will do
---
Or suuufffeerrr my curse...
---
Ooga booga booga!
---
It's called "Love Song", I found it in the YouTube list of free music: there are many good ones, there, and with tons of different styles! :D
---
Because i can!
---
Yes I did and I'm fucking thrilled. I've played Bubba before with a splinter offering and just don't like him. Didn't want to have to spend $10 just to get one perk. I'm pretty sure they are going to revert it, at least that was what Peanits said on the forums.
---
My partner and I were there as Jane and Dwight!! We didn’t get to see you though 😭😭
---
Saying that someone isn't good at something is insulting and condescending. Alright.
---
As killer you could make good use out of the stain going through walls. It being gone is a loss. Whether you believe that or not is up to you.
---
I just reset my controls to defaults, and  it's m1 to repair, m2 to repair with a toolbox.  Are you sure you haven't changed the bindings?
---
Gens before friends
---
Look at me. I will never pass for a perfect killer or get a perfect slaughter. Can it be? That I'm not meant to play this part?
---
Who is that killer I see? Staring straight, right back at me? When will my reflection show, who I am inside?
---
Well that’s completely different then. This isn’t a purchase its the reward from The Rift.
---
No i do get u but what im saying is its already pretty shit on console, oerhaps dedicaed servers wouldnt help but id be willing to try them cuz our current situation isnt a tad better
---
Why bitch about it? Afraid of a T-bag
---
Really wish they didnt do this fbm
---
The one hour downtime wasn't even that big of a deal. It robbed us of maybe 1 or 2 matches. That's it.
---
You are lè hella gay
---
And your a street rat
---
Haha your right I hadn't thought of that factor on top.
---
It's super effective against Freddy I heard but doesn't affect Michael
---
Yup. Trying to understand an issue isn't trying to excuse it.
---
It's not that they specifically chose to wait until the last minute to announce the delay. They only found out about it at that last minute because of a series of other, probably equally stupid, choices.
---
If you’re into dark souls, rank 1 is for you.  I find green and purple enjoyable.
---
Yeah but what's in kyf doesn't really matter in the main game. I just mean it's unavailable where it matters
---
Takes about 10 minutes for me
---
60 bucks worth of content with more than 50% locked behind a paywall.. a grinding worse than any mmo I know
---
Sure buddy. I spent way less for way more content in other games, as big as BHVR if not smaller than them
---
You can white knight them all you want but their system is a f2p system with pay to win content (perks behind paywall) and the battle pass just make it more clear
---
I've seen more f2p with less content locked behind a paywall than this game, that you have to pay to play
---
Play the game, get BP, use it on new offering, play the game more as you now get extra BP, level up while playing more, get serums for leveling up to certain levels, rinse repeat.
---
It's really not that funny guys
---
I would rather have double blood points
---
i think some platforms have longer killer queues but an hour is insane.. I play on Xbox and it takes less than 7 minutes, survivor less than two minutes. Maybe people are playing more killer at the moment because of the event?
---
Spine chill is a great perk. In fact, I often run spine chill and resilience together for the +15% vault speed.
---
Same for me... I was counting on this new patch to solve everything but apparently they're not going to fix it so soon
---
You know damn well this game will die the instant something else comes along that does it better, most stream games have a shelf life of 5 years tops. This will not come anywhere close to Team Fortress 2 in longevity, at least 3 promising games in the genre are about to be released as it is thats going to give it a run for its money if BVHR doesn't get off its ass. This game just shows how terrible humanity is as a whole when such a large amount of you claim you would leave the game if they balanced SWF bullshit.
---
if they were shirtless you would be totally ruined
---
Wish fengs mask would be worn on her face as opposed to back of the head.
---
Its like concept art from the devs. Very nice
---
Damn, you beat me to it. Lol
---
A little here and there. Gets easier once you get your first t3 tbh.
---
Slugging for a 4K is literally what you have to do to guarantee a 4th kill. The Hatch is pure RNG and the Killer has to risk losing a 4K because of a poorly thought out hatch mechanic. But just "don't complain" after getting denied your hard work because a survivor got lucky.
---
Just because it will happen doesn't mean you have to like it happening and can't tell people to not do it.
---
FunWorld actually owns both lol
---
Ghost face is 100% A with the new way of playing him and billy is probably more b tier
---
I thought I was the only one
---
Thank you! That's the wrong mindset though, if you want it, you just have to practice a shitload! :')
---
I don't remember the Telletubbies as all purple? Weren't they 4 and each was a different color?
---
I'm a very big Halloween fan. I have seen them, so yeah, the blond version definitely came from those.
---
Oscar is low-key trash
---
Why do you think that robe is so...extensive...in the front there?
---
It's because the third survivor was blocking the hand and names of the fourth survivor messing with a killer's information in lobby this change was in the patch notes.
---
Allright that makes more sense just wish it was clearer for people how the offering functions. 
---
It says it stacks but I thought it was stacking in sets of 1000 and I've been on since the update went live and hardly seen any being used. 
---
I'm guessing the confusion isnt localised to just me. Be good if they could update the description of the item to incentivise people to use them as if your the only one popping them they're still fairly useless.
---
This shouldn’t be controversial this is better for the game lol
---
I guess that makes sense
---
Same here Michael Myers is definitely my favorite slasher of all time
---
That shit is A1!
---
I get your point and I'll partly agree with it (that Freddy nerf right after his chapter released was pretty uncalled for imo) but don't you think you're over reacting a little?
---
My point was you get higher bonuses from common offerings than you do from the event item assuming your a decent player and that's only the common offerings and as for green offerings, party streamers or escape cakes even more so.
---
If they're purposely running this shrine to help with beginning the rift, then BBQ will be on the Switch's shrine soon. LF and Freddy's teachables are available via the Shrine and the Shrine only for now.
---
Nurse behind Billy and nightmare? Ok I won't take this seriously
---
Immediately run out when you see the bloodwarden spikes, the killer has aura reading on you
---
