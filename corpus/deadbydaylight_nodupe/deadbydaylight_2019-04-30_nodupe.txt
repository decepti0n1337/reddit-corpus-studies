No. It's easily countered by Survivor Perks like Small Game or Stake Out. Or just learning totem placenent. The issue with Ruin comes from people not hitting great skill checks reliably, or the survivors deciding to focus on getting rid of Ruin instead of working on Gens.

---
Almost everyone on xbox follows these rules
---
It was when all gens were done. I did pig for a daily, got zero kills and managed to catch him camping the hatch in the Badham boiler room. Let‚Äôs just say he had a not fun time.
---
2 mins? you mean about 20 secs. Their new garbage code to change up and make Hex's harder to find made it easier. Half the time it's fucking just in the middle of the map shining like a beacon, Not even worth wasting the slot to run Hex's anymore other than haunted ground since you're banking on them finding it and breaking it lickity split.  only time Hex's work is like on low ranks who don't know how to look or just ignore them
---
medkit/bond

---
problem solved
---
What else would you expect from a person with an x on either side of their name?
---
It was end of the match. 0 kills, getting a daily. He camped the boiler room hatch in Badham. Bad times ensued.
---
I meant it more similar to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm improving‚Äù, didn‚Äôt realise people got so triggered here though. I will post a 2 blink video next time.
---
Good, see you never because the chances of running into me in-game are slim to none.

Why make meals based on character when you could make meals of your characters.                        -Leatherface
---
That... is the most confusing logic I've ever heard. I never said the survivors are using the second best stuff lmao.
---
Think he did alright.
---
What was angry or aggressive with him?
---
I don't think so. The dresser is on the left side of the photo behind the Clown, and when you're coming into that area, it's always on the left.
---
This is actually fucking dope and I hope this blows up. And blood hunt cake would be cool. You could make it a triple stack (biggest to smallest) then make the cake idk red velvet maybe? And use blood red frosting all over it dripping down the cake on all sides. And even create little blood points symbols on the rims of each layer. I‚Äôd love to watch you cook anything you make.
---
I had no idea, I was so upset
---
No, it‚Äôs just overused, inconsistent, and boring as hell 
---
At low ranks it could be considered powerful since new players won‚Äôt be as used to hitting great skill checks, but against experienced players it‚Äôs not gonna do much, implying it doesn‚Äôt get found and cleansed instantly 
---
On top of that the perks effects are to a degree RNG dependant. I‚Äôve done entire gens without a single skill check, but other times it‚Äôs nonstop skill checks. 
---
This is the part where I‚Äôm gonna advocate for devour hope as the most fun hex perk in the game 
---
That is all, have a good day
---
So you moried her. Lul ggez
---
Give me fragile, I am the sneaky cunt and I want my sneak cunt bloodpoints.
---
He moried us üò≠ ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I can't remember...can you walk over the mattress?
---
Only if Calm Spirit didn't existed
---
you kinda did tho. "4man swf running full meta perks" is the second best as according to your own words theyd be using instaheals and a haddonfield offering if they were using the best they could
---
Fucking hell, you beat me to it lol.
---
He kept tunneling and face camping i had to jump in the locker to get my ds üò≠ if he would of hit me he would of moried me right there
---
Naw. I like that it speeds up your search and it quiets the noise you make, but I don‚Äôt like that it guarantees the health kit. I‚Äôd rather not give up a perk slot for that.

I want more information about what the Entity looks for in Survivors. If I remember correctly, it's something along the lines of vengeance and/or bloodlust. With Survivors though, all we have is 'Some person went somewhere alone and was never seen again.' I'm just wondering if the Entity has standards for Survivors, or if it's honestly ready to grab anyone who decided to walk their dog in the middle of the night. Old Man Jenkins decided to take Fluffy on a walk at Midnight? Hi, welcome to the Fog.

Not OP. Just annoying that its in 9 out of 10 builds. I understand why it is, but wish there was more variety than ruin, bbq and then insert 2 other perks out of a pool of about 10
---
Not my favourite as in I use it a lot, but favourite in its concept - Blood Warden. No other perk makes quite such a moment in a match.

---
More Panda clips!
---
Ruin, for me, it's exactly like Self-Care, almost everyone thinks that those perks are necessary while they actually aren't. i saw and know survivors that stayed injured the whole match and still survived and survivors that did all the gens through Ruin without even bothering looking for the hex
---
All it means is that his shirt can lift that far up
---
Aww yeah No Mither and Fragile let's go
---
What time length of the match is the god pallet used?
---
I just realized that I've never even tried that before. Huh.
---
I‚Äôm very aware of what AITH does. But I‚Äôve got a better chance of scoring a better health pack with plunderers since it increases your chance of better items as well. I don‚Äôt always need a health kit and I don‚Äôt like forcing one of the items to become one.
---
I bet, just make sure you get the p3 Claudettes first. They get annoying after a while
---
Yeah I know I'm just playing.
---
Cool story bro
---
Based on your own experience, looking at what other players used during your game. While it's anecdotal, at the very least it's more broad range than streamers.
---
Nah I couldn't. I got completely stuck in this spot
---
i think the only nerf she needs is lower lunge range so it would seperate the good nurses from the best
---
Of course not, but most people know BHVR really doesn't give a fuck about killer balance, they're all about appeasing survivors without pissing off killers too much.
---
Maybe I'll do an off shoot cookbook with that theme in mind. ;)

Sucks man.

My bad dude reading this over I see what you‚Äôre saying üòÇ nah I wasn‚Äôt being sarcastic sorry for the confusion
---
Fix her then.
---
:(
---
If we are continuing going off your insane logic, a SWF with meta perks would be the 6th best thing they could do, if you count each individual insta heal and the Haddonfield offering. So, again going off your  logic, a SWF with meta perks is equal to the 6th best killer, whoever you would consider that to be. Which is just wrong lmao
---
David was using "Mettle of Man" which allows him to take another hit when he is in the injured state, after getting hit 3 times.

Technically ephebopphylia
---
Bop! bop!

---
when did I bitch about it being realistic? It makes sense since it's a huge 7ft dude stepping onto a bear trap. in terms of hag she uses some sort of black magic which could be immune to the caster?
---
I could make a special cake or petite fours based on popular offerings? Maybe even sugar cookies with flood icing.
---
Yeah at least. Just a lil bit annoying that I couldn't done anything
---
Thank you .i was beyond pissed thinking this guy cheated. Especially since it looked like Ash tried the same thing but DC‚Äôd

On the David?
---
Mettle of Man I'm sure.
---
Is it necrophilia if they're fully sentient and alive again?

Yes, but then you have to run calm spirit over anything else. That really isn't a good trade.

"Appeasing survivors"
---
Yet survivors have gotten nerfed in every single patch
---
This is awesome. I'd personally like to see use/success rates of different add ons.
---
I'd also love a list of what value "slightly/moderately/considerably/tremendously" actually means on add ons, seeing as it varies a lot.
---
I'd like to see the average amount of people who play each Killer, along with the averages per rank color. (Like 10% of player base in Red, 45 in Green, etc.)
---
Would also like to see most used Items/Add-Ons and Offerings.
---
Shameless self promotion. I'm a Twitch streamer returning from Hiatus. I'll be living streaming them, maybe even add a closet cosplay of the character dish I'm featuring. I'll save the VOD and post it here.

Don't worry, I'll do my best to try and kill you.
---
Easy.
---
* The Endgame Collapse Timer progresses at 1/3 speed while an active RBT is on a survivor's head.
---
* RBT's will activate on placement during endgame. By extension
---
Any synergy she could theoretically have with the Endgame Collapse is virtually gone, but at the very least this would be power neutral since she isn't losing any capability she already had.
---
I don't quite get what you mean, since I don't watch superhero movies.
---
If I could clone myself to have 4 me's, Ruin would be worthless. I hit most of the checks and never waste time looking for it.
---
That being said, Ruin is top tier because most players are bad and I'm usually the only one doing gens while 3 of my teammates are off gens hunting it down.
---
Its name is HEX: ruin. Meaning the perk can be completely taken out within the first 15 seconds of the game.
---
I think having a variety of dishes and drinks would allow people more flexibility in following recipes than doing a full course dinner. You have some epic ideas already; this is definitely something worthwhile! I have been sitting on the idea of a DBD party recently, and something such as this would be an excellent resource‚Äînot to mention super fun!
---
Shirtless Kate when?
---
Clearly you don‚Äôt understand the concept of buying something so you can use it. If I buy dead by daylight am I going to never play it because it pisses other people off that my internet is bad? No. Am I going to try to play it even though my internet is bad and it pisses other people off? Yes.
---
You just need to get used to the idea that other people buy things that make them happy and that not everyone can afford to have WiFi that is up to your standards.
---
I don't understand the controversy. oh how dare a killer's ability have a downside?

---
is very good, but not OP
---
Because didnt you hear jax is gonna be the new survivor
---
I'll butter her biscuits. ;D
---
I mean, that's basically always been the case with Ruin, and yet almost every killer still runs it. It turns out that even 3 seconds of survivors being off gens is amazing
---
sounds tasty ^_^
---
Agreed, I make it a point not to teabag at the killer and only my team mates. If they see it too, whoops lol. If the killer's fun, I'll crouch and nod because it's easier to see, I'm sure it looks funny for them too
---
Good idea and fairly easy to do. I can make chocolate/cookie decorations to add in for eyes and finger accents.
---
1. Ive lagged before. If ur lagging, ur more mad then ur team8s because you can't enjoy the game. If you have dead by daylight, you have a ps4, xbox or pc. If you seriously can't afford decent wifi, theres a probleme on were ur spending ur money
---
Because you let one of them bleed out, you didn't get the 20% from them to get a gold in Sacrifice. "Sacrificing 2 or 3 Survivors will award a Silver Emblem.", "Sacrificing all Survivors will award a Gold Emblem." 
---
You didn't have enough chases to build up your Chaser category. As you said you only did 4 chases in total, thats why, you want more, around 8+ chases
---
You can check how the emblems are scored (here)[https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems#Killer_Emblems]

That would lowkey be kinda cool lol

Tell your friend to play some killer games. This guy needs some humility.
---
It's fine if you think that, but don't be shit talking other people just because *you* think it's bad.
---
I will take paramedic and the slow breathing please! The fragile egg perk is garbage and wouldn‚Äôt work because of all the sandbagging teammates and then to top it with the tunneling killers on PS4 who won‚Äôt go after the guy who unhooked you and sees both of you!
---
I mean it would but I doubt we will see it. I'm excited for next chapter reveal regardless
---
I like how you start a list and end it on the same item. And have you ever heard of gifts? You know that thing that one person gets for another person? Yeah, those exist pal.
---
I'd hardly call this true anymore, given 3ks are usually not enough to pip.

That's a good question

Noed is a generic pool perk, a level 1 rank 20 killer could have it game 1

Throwing the thematic aside, a version of the trapper with traps that slowed would objectively suck hella dick. 
---
It'd all depend on how they were placed and how quickly, but even then, why gamble on a trap to only have it slow a person instead of trapping them or injuring them?
---
As far as the game and us see it, victory and ranking up are separate things. Hell to some people its not even a win unless they get enough points to justify calling it a win, but thats on the players call at that point.
---
As a Doctor main, this build is dumb.
---
Alternatively: Nurse is one of very few killers actually able to put up a decent fight against competent survivors because a map spawning with central, strong looping structures doesn't fuck her.
---

Not OP but definitely annoying to deal with. I recently began running Small Game and have found it helps a lot with finding the Hex totem.

That's a gangsta build! Why haven't I, a doctor main, think of this before?
---
at purple ranks, I see everyone else running Self Care, and I don't see the point in doing so when I can just use Dead Hard and Adrenaline and do a no heal meta? If I am to get healed, I'd get a teammate to do so or I'd try to find a medkit.
---
It can be difficult to deal with but it's not impossible
---
They should make killers penetrable after they stay still for three minutes and it'd prevent Afk killers from blocking
---
Is it too late to change the meme?? XD

In what way does the game discern victory and ranking up?

Lol

&gt; Why not create a casual mode and a TRUE rank mode
---
- The playerbase isn't big enough to split the community between different queues, waiting time for a game is long enough
---
- Hardly anyone would be playing the ranked mode as you'd see moris and haddonfield offerings and the sweatiest people every game with zero fun allowed
---
- New players would be paired with experienced players almost every game in the casual mode, completely ruining the quality of the matches.

I feel it should have zero changes from base.
---

Because they were hilariously overpowered when the game was first launched.
---
Now they are just overpowered.
---
Initiating a chase isn't good enough to justify it. If you find someone and then spend 2 minutes bloodlusting your way through Wretched Shop, they're going to get ruin and also do 2 of the 4 available gens.
---
Fuck yah after the second day of playing him I muted my headset while in the menu, wish they would have given bubba a kill switch for that thing!

I forget what exactly are they doing to nerf her traps?

There's a spot on crotus pren where the basement usually is but can also just be a dead end hallway, If the game goes sour and theres no chance for victory I'll head there and slam a locker, patiently waiting for them to find me, head pointed to the stars. We are all made of stars after all.

His awesome arms are replaced with huge sporks.
---
The Christmas theme music was pretty good and I didn‚Äôt mind hearing it! Reminded me of the music from Batman Returns being all dark and Christmas time!
---
My favorite game mechanic is tunneling.
---
The skill check reduction only applies to those 3 gens. You don't have to work on those 3 gens when facing Freddy and it creates an interesting dynamic of you having to make a choice.
---
When you run into a locker doesn‚Äôt that create an aura that the killer can see? Does quick and quiet stop that. Sorry if I worded it wrong before
---
That's a cursed image just waiting to happen.
---
Doctor skillchecks be like
---
That‚Äôs what you get bitch I love videos like this
---
Endgame will not activate her traps so someone with a RTB will just be able to walk out the gates
---
Sorry for the poor quality, I had recordings set to like 360p.
---
With lowering the endgame collapse time to 2 minutes I don't think we should be reverting that nerf.
---
Pig's power is intended to delay the game, not to hold people hostage post 5 gens.
---
Yeah, I figured adding a bit of everything and giving people enough options to choose from would be the smartest idea. I'm no mixologist, but I do know my way around a few spirits. ;D  I'm excited to have you try the recipes.
---
If you run into a locker it creates noise that he can see, no aura, quick and quiet stops this. But you can just walk into a locker to avoid noise.
---
Well, assuming you choose killer, you could go full tryhard during rank reset with an ebony and 2 red addons and all that jazz, nobody had a hope in hell of surviving and you get a 4k in minutes. You absolutely won like a bastard but your lack of points/emblems mean you probably safety pipped if even. Opposite choice, you spend the match lengthening chases, allowing the saves you can easily have stopped, the works. Meaning 2 to 4 survs probably escape out to your loss but you got a pip and at least 20k points so it was worth it. Its the players idea of a win but the entity would likely be displeased so the game calls it a loss.
---
You might but if your teammates are potatoes at doing gens and finding totems you're screwed.
---
Spine Chill?
---
Get gud LUL
---
I mean theoretically you can 3 gen yourself with those gens against freddy since you know where they were and you knew that it gives a bonus to repair speed
---
They need a gen to activate. So how it used to be was a pig would save one trap and put it on the last survivor after the last gen. It was a built in bloodwarden and rancor. The teammates would either leave or stay and get killed because theyre helping the last one live.
---
Hag traps work how Trapper should. He should start with all his traps, and they should be something he can recharge like Clown (action required to reload - ie build more traps) and the oldest traps "rust" and disappear after a certain amount of time after they've been triggered or if the new trap exceeds max trap count.
---
OK I'll spoiler text it.
---
&gt;!When super heroes die they always come back because of a mcguffin or event that requires them to come back.  Superman does this when he fights Doomsday as he mcguffins away to the Fortress of Solitude and heals for a year before getting rad guns and metal hair.  X-Men literally just retcon the entire universe to revive everyone.  In DC when a hero is killed in the main universe there is a hero from a slightly different universe that is then brought over into the main universe to be the new Green Arrow or whatever despite not being the exact same as the one who died.  It's so consistent at this point do people honestly expect super heroes to stay dead?!&lt;
---
Killers seeing your aura in a locker would kill the point of a locker. Killers don‚Äôt see your aura in a locker ever.
---
And there is nothing really wrong with that.
---
Woah if that actually happens, sorry mate
---
Thats kinda of a thing to do
---
OK, but in what way does the game tell you, "you safe/depipped, but this was a win"
---
I like this idea, but survivors would probably complain about there still being a chance to catch them when trying to remove the traps. Maybe the Pig loses the ability to see where jigsaw boxes are when the end game starts to "balance" it out. 
---
I personally think the Endgame Collapse should be straight RNG. Along with the 2 minute timer, get out ASAP because the Entity could snatch you within the 1st 10 seconds or when the timer ends. Or they could switch NOED to be that way. This way survivors can quit crying about "only bad killers use it". That's the TRUE No One Escapes Death, leave it up to the Entity. Snatch all 4 within 30 seconds if the killer did in fact play well, or no one at all until the timer ends if they played poorly. I can't tell you how many times I've literally hooked all 4 SWF twice, have most if not all injured before the final gen gets popped only to be in chase and they all end up with Adrenaline.
---
Absolute perfection
---
Make a cake the shape of a locker for dwight
---
If demolishing a team with 5 or 4 gens is putting up a decent fight in your books... hillbilly puts on decent fights, nurse is unbalanced..
---
Who the fuck does that so far from the boundary line? You always do it so that you'll fall forwards into it
---
you‚Äôre right but you shouldn‚Äôt say it
---
They punish DC's by dropping you two pips.  I also have no idea if they punish say the LF situation at all but I'm still pissed at that game I had where I got hooked and killed because he was sitting in the basement.
---
Get fucked
---
The huntress is built like a brick wall tho
---
Competent survivors don't get 4k 5genned by billy. Competent survivors generally don't even get 4k'd by a billy.
---
Is there a cap for blood points?
---
I would love to see useless perks getting buffed to being useful that way games are more than just "BBQ+Ruin" and "Self-Care+Urban+Borrowed Time".
---
hehehehehe silly billy
---
This is me, when I see daddy in the distance...
---
Game offering on the far right also almost guarantees scratched mirror Myers.
---
I never said anything of a sort, getting 4kd with 5 gens its not puting up a decent fight, its unbalanced
---
If they down you and pick you up within 60 seconds of being unhooked, it triggers. If they don't, they didn't tunnel you. What's so hard to understand about that? 
---
The bigger issue - survivors whining about a killer doing their best to kill you when that's their job. Tunneling as a term and construct is just an excuse for survivors to complain and have someone else to blame when they die.
---
I‚Äôm going to analyze these one by one, so you‚Äôll likely see a lot of edits:
---
Deja Vu: I dislike the idea of buffing it. It‚Äôs fine as it is. The increased repair speed, even the tiny amount it is, would still speed up the game noticeably for generator based builds. The reduced skill check chances are pointless, I don‚Äôt see why you added that, and although survivor point generation is awful, we already have a perk that boosts objective points in Prove Thyself.
---
The design of D√©j√† Vu is already well designed because it makes generator location far quicker and counters an extremely effective killer strategy: the 3 gem strategy.
---
Essentially, this killer strategy is based around location the 3 closest generators and hard patrolling them, usually near the latter half of the game. However, Deja Vu counters this perfectly, and generally makes repairing the last generator a far easier task, which is I firmly believe it should not be changed.
---
Have you considered that 4k 5gen is literally not something that should ever happen at all? Because the implication is either 1. you were never doing a gen or 2. the killer somehow managed to down 4 people in 80 seconds.
---
Any meme lore behind some of these choices or are these just off the top of your head? Just curious.   
---
Feng would be Chinese food, Sushi is Japanese cuisine. Jake would be something Korean like Bulgogi. I can make it with an expensive cut of meat and do something more fancy, since Jake comes from wealth.   
---
For David I can make a English Breakfast maybe? I love that Ace Vegas Burger idea. Meg would be something Instagram/hipster ish, like A√ßa√≠ bowl, fancy oats or poki bowl?
---
Dang
---
I think its balanced af now... killers are faster and have all sorts of perks to help them.
---
&gt; As far as the game and us see it, victory and ranking up are separate things.
---
You said that the game sees victory and ranking up as separate things.
---
DBDR on the android. You can save as many builds as you want for both survivor and killer. It even tells  you the numbers for each rank of the perks.
---
Don't know about iPhone tho
---
He used mettle of man
---
Shock
---
&gt; killers are faster
---
Normal killer speeds are still 115%
---
&gt; and have all sorts of perks to help them.
---
Survivors perks are way more powerful killer ones
---
imo ruin is only strong if the survivors make it strong. If a team pushes through the skillchecks the perk is almost worthless yet if a team refuses to do gens and keeps looking for that totem then their fate is sealed.
---
That‚Äôs why the perk is so good at lower ranks, survivors don‚Äôt do gens with it up. Even if you can‚Äôt hit every great skillcheck it‚Äôs still better than not doing gens at all. A decent survivor should not be bothered by ruin whatsoever.
---
This isn‚Äôt a dynamic that would influence picking it or not. Freddy is a low tier killer that doesn‚Äôt see much play, and people would just use self care to wake up. The increased generator repair speed would far outweigh the risk, to the point I feel it would be picked even if the survivors knew beforehand that the killer was Freddy.
---
Fragile is what I need in my life.
---
If typing really want it... r/dbdgonewild ü§¢
---
I mean you could camp and tunnel but I don‚Äôt recommend this. This is just what all legions do to me and they generally get a 4K because my teams don‚Äôt understand that they should do gens instead of farm
---
Rushing into a locker doesn‚Äôt create an aura, it creates a noise notification. And to answer your question, yes, Q&amp;Q stops that.
---
Had one that lasted 30
---
it just is bad tho. selfcaring in 2k19? more like wasting time
---
Theres nothing underneath. I looked :(
---
Get them to t3 and down and hook. They will stay in t3 and it will help you find them if they don‚Äôt snap out of it
---
Yeah don't listen to OP, Pallet saves, Flashlight saves, hell even Locker saves with Head On count.
---
Ok thanks !
---
In that case than, I wasnt clear. But if I were to get a 4k and still only safety pip than I have both won the game by mine and the entitys standards but lost out on rank. That bit in particular isnt shown anywhere if thats what you were looking for but a player trying to rank up would have considered that same game a loss.
---
Killers have way more powerful addons.. soo????
---
No it's just a time buyer. That's it
---
Just a comment so I can find this tomorrow
---
Protip for everyone thinking it's good
---
Just run Bond + Adrenaline 
---
and for everyone telling me "that's 2 slots tho", you should always have adrenaline anyway
---
8k in each category
---
only BBQ avoids that cap, because it grants a post-trial bonus
---
I like to picture bell ghost playing it with his bell
---
Survivors like that can't handle being outplayed. Better to just leave if they say something instead of talking back
---
Ruin is just another example of "only good against bad players"
---
I love for you to fix your fucking game
---
I play quite a bit of solo survivor and this would be an amazing QOL change. I usually run the same build on whoever I play (Iron Will,Adren,WGLF and DH/BL) but I would go oit of my way to adjust my builds based on the other survivors I match with.
---
I'd like to know this too. It takes me like 30 minutes to an hour for it to switch from ptb to live or the other way around
---
People like Benedict Baker and Vigo. I'm also curious on the beginning/start of the trials, like the first ever killer(s) and survivor(s). I also want to see a more in-depth story on how licensed survivors/killers got in the entity's realm
---
Good point about Jake, I can make Korean street stall foods instead, tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes) and chicken skewers (Dakkochi) with melted mozzarella and Gyeranjjim (steamed flully egg).  Feng Min was a gamer, spent a lot of times at gaming cafes and most likely had a poor diet as a result. I know at these cafes you can get instant ramen, sandwiches, coffee, tea, candy and chocolate. I can do instant ramen hacks, with a few sandwiches and homemade hot chocolate (maybe a boozy version). I'll ponder on that some more.
---
No mither, fragile, oOo. Lets get it

If you can juke the nurse, it isnt a god nurse.

What the hell kind of recipe are you looking for with that, that's so sad

Still would
---
I just spit my damn coffee out.....I love that fried chicken idea. If someone could draw a picture of Freddy holding up a bucket of fried chicken. Oh my god that would be hilarious. Come have some of Freddy's fried chicken or the meatball pizza would work too, from the movie scene!
---
i posted about the same issue god it‚Äôs noisy
---
That‚Äôs what I was originally thinking. Idk maybe bad potato‚Äôs make the best mash potatoes? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Uhh....
---
**Oooooh.**
---
Gotcha.
---
Aside from the obvious tip, "practice makes perfect", i would recommend on figuring out what youre doing wrong on a mechanical level and try to improve on it. Spending too long in chases? Try figuring out jukes and timing yourself in chases. Not enough pressure? Work on it. You get the idea. Improving yourself as a player will reflect gar more into the game than any addon.
---
Now granted, cold dirt is just a really good addon in general, but a good player will be able to use it to its fullest. Hope it helps
---
Cheers
---
I swear when theres a ruin it becomes easier to hit great skill checks, but as soon as it pops I cant hit them anymore
---
I would love to see meta data, like the % of games in the past 30 days that each survivor/killer used X perk. I would also like to see # of killers and # of players online right now, so I can judge which will be a faster queue time for me.
---
It's balanced
---
Not to my knowledge
---
Well id expect everyone rank 12 and up to know what they are doing...especially in a discord call among 4 people.

Wow that's genius

You can shock someone when they are looping you, And they won‚Äôt be able to vault or throw down pallets for 3 seconds? I think it is 3 seconds. Someone correct me if i‚Äôm wrong

Just last night I played against trapper and saw a teammate working her way to a trapped pallet. I decided to go disarm the trap to be helpful and mid animation lagged out. Next thing I know Quentin tosses the pallet and steps in the trap! The trapper just stopped and stared for a second before leaving the chase to hook me while the kate t-bagged me thinking I tried to sandbag her. I was too busy laughing my ass off to even wiggle while I got carried to basement
---
Um, actually they fixed.

This can't be officially sponsored by the devs or anything since it involves messing with files and could be done wrong, but it works for me. I don't bother with the bat files though, I just rename manually.
---
People always bring up the killer being the one who controls the blood points but so do the survivors. Without the killer there's no game. Without the survivors there's no game
---
2.5
---
Its more survivors that DC and or are that bad. They get hit and DC immediately
---
Only two kills and you're complaining that a SWF said something?  This community is so fragile. 
---
That is a pretty good score though!
---
Nurse is obviously the best killer in the game. She ignores every mechanic the survivors would normally have to defend themselves. Anyone who says she isn't &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any other killer doesn't understand.
---
Billy doesn't actually have anything that crazy going on, he just has a lot of little things that help him out. He has high although somewhat constrained mobility. He can deal with pallets without losing too much distance in a chase. And when you manipulate the situation correctly you can down someone very quickly into a chase.
---
Hag also has high, if constrained, mobility. Hers is limited to areas she's already been to, but she can use hers to score hits on multiple survivors in rapid succession. Her map pressure is *higher* than Billy's in most cases.
---
Because of her traps, she can either ignore pallets entirely and use them to setup mind games weighted in her favor or break them without losing distance in a chase because her next hit comes from phantasms anyway.
---
And while she can't end chases quite as quickly as Billy can in ideal conditions, she can still get Hit-CD-insta hit chains multiple times a game which is faster than even Nurse can end a chase. Her short chases are super short.
---
The *only* thing Billy reliably does better than Hag is deal with Mettle of Man. That's a big thing but she does enough other stuff better than he does that I think she's a topper-tier killer than he is. Billy's just easier to play.
---
and they don't afraid of anything
---
SHHHH! This is reddit, we can't have logic here! (/s because some people won't figure that out)

Two salty spitoons. Not to blame tho. Going to have to learn the wear and iron suit

I mean, there have been times where I go to get someone who is unhooked, and the injured guy is running around like a moron so I down him and get DSed.
---
I mean, sure I Could just slug him, but it's not like I was actively only looking for him.
---
ye, exactly that
---
Jokes. Brought to you by 14 year-olds.
---
The trick is, if you get stuck and they sit there and watch you, just stare back.  They either lose interest, or waste loads of time. :D
---
I wasnt complaining though, I was laughing at them for being dumb. If I tried harder I literally could've got the 4K using nothing but a low tier killer
---
Have to see a clip of it to be sure. Generally you don‚Äôt want to lead the killer to your teammates. If you didn‚Äôt do that, your fine. 
---
Even if you did, whatever. It happens, the killer has a pretty big terror radius, so if this dude is just sitting in the Doc‚Äôs TR healing in the first place, that‚Äôs just bad plays by him. Doc could have had Nurses Calling and saw him.
---
As the other reply says, use a class photo as well, you'll have 0 terror radius to those sleeping, and the ones that are awake will be revealed for ~9 seconds every time you dream tag someone so you can easily chain off finding a single survivor. You become a 110% m/s killer but at least your lunge is normal and you can bloodlust if need be.
---
Christ, I hope you are memeing lmao
---
That‚Äôs why I just DC as killer. I depip and I don‚Äôt have to play a shitty match. Win win.
---
David was a Rugby player, their diet is actually strict. Mostly protein with light carbs. Definitely not fat-infused meat pie. I'd say he likely eat more steak or meat-based meal. Same with Jake, who had to live in the forest prior to the incident. Probably grilled meat on charcoal fire.
---
It's no different than a regular game if you don't go hard though. Most games somebody dies after the 2nd or 3rd gen pops
---
Thank you a lot, really
---
I might do cocktails inspired by offerings. I feel like the names sound like drinks, more than food when I really think about it. Hmm.
---
I wouldn't be able to post it here. I play on PS4 and I closed the game sometime after, therefore losing the clip.  
---
But I was pretty damn far away from them, I even died because no one came for me since they were too far away from me
---
Fuck toxic killers too. They give us fair killers a bad name
---
Or Amanda's Letter Pig.
---
I agree with everything except the devour hope bit... DH is the 2nd most fun hex, Third Seal is the most fun. Change my mind
---
They shouldn't *revert* this nerf.
---
That's a terrible idea.
---
They need to *replace it* with something that would keep the patch power neutral for Pig.
---
Don‚Äôt sweat it bro. People get irrationally mad when playing this game and love to blame their failure on other people.
---
They are guaranteed to show up on bloodwebs levels 30, 35, and 40. But they will only appear on other character‚Äôs bloodwebs after you have gotten said perk on the character it belongs to bloodweb
---
Its shit
---
You choose a horrible song that doesnt go with the game and you put 2 black bars soo I cant even understand what the fuck is happening
---
Meg - since she was a star runner, you could make a carb-heavy dish since athletes like to carb load before events. 
---
Feng - a spicy Chinese dish? She seems to be pretty feisty and honestly would probably be toxic towards the killer. You could use strong spices like star anise or ginger slices to give it a bite. 
---
Claudette - a salad with a variety of leafy vegetables and edible flowers? 
---
Quentin - a coffee based dessert!
---
Jake - how about Korean haute cuisine but with an outdoorsy twist or with wild ingredients?
---
Jane - a popular Latin American dish with an eye-catching presentation since she was a celebrity.
---
Honestly, the survivors don‚Äôt have any way of knowing you‚Äôll ‚Äúgo easier.‚Äù So if it‚Äôs a 5 gen three man game it is not fun at all for the survivors. Just a three man game in general isn‚Äôt fun. The big needs to be fixed of course, but you also have to see the other side
---
That was an amazing magic trick!
---
Combo with Tinkerer just to be on them.
---
Ptb is over now soo you couldn4 do it anyways
---
Yeah so as I've said, buff her somewhere else.
---
I'd love to see Bunny Feng Min released!
---
I'm so glad this part of the community exists
---
All killers have the same basic m1 lunges. Previously slower killers had shorter ones but that has been changed. I have heard rumors that Trapper's is thinner than others but I doubt that.
---
I know I whiff a lot because I always follow the swing movement with my mouse just out of habit. Some killers have animations that make this habit worse.
---
She doesn't need a nerf to an existing tactic with compensation buffs.
---
She needs a nerf that leaves her at the same power level as it was before the EGC was added.
---
Don't hit her power as it's able to be used on live. It's fine as is and nerfing it makes no b sense.
---
Literally just nerf it's potential synergy with the EGC.

thanks *cough* "likes" *cough*(no offence INTENDED)

I use Unnerving Presence instead of Overcharge, i swear to god, not even ten seconds pass before someone fails a skillcheck.

It is a community voted tier list that has been around since early 2017 was provided by a user called dennisreep. Look it up. Anyone can vote on it and thousands already have, so it is not just something that "agrees with me". It is what a lot of players have been using for a while now.
---
Self care was never meant to be the main tool to heal. It's meant to supplement your team mate in case things go wrong all at once. If the time permit and there's nothing urgent to do, sure, I'll heal you.
---
But not when there's a guy on the hook on his second time and require urgent assistant. This is where I need you to self care yourself so you don't get down easily by killer while I try to save the hooked person.
---
Also the time you spent looking for other survivors to heal or doing gen while injured will be wasted if the killer can one hit you and put you back on a hook.
---
Self care is meant to prevent you to be on hook as long as possible, which translate to you contributing to the team longer. Of course, like any other action, use common sense. You're still injured but you're near a hooked survivor and the killer is away? Then save the survivor first then heal each other instead of using self care first.
---
Ya and I do agree with that but when I'm on the other side I at least see how the killer plays
---
Have you experienced going against a rank 1 full legacy nurse?
---
They do have different lunge ranges. Not insanely different, but different. That's the while reason Michael can lunge further in tier 3 than tier 1. Freddy has a longer lunge, compared to Amanda who has a shorter lunge(in her m1).
---
Possibly a better ranking system. One that actually  rewards players for climbing through the ranks. It doesn't have to be anything grand just something that says, "hey i made it to this rank and im glad that i did it". Incentives to the player base would be certainly appreciated and a welcome sight.
---
You forgot to drop Freddy
---
Doctor doesn't need toth, just use calm addon like every doctor should if he's not using iridescent king
---
We all want it üòà
---
As I've said before I don't think her power should be a post 5 gen hostage tool, I personally don't agree with bringing back the traps arming post gens being done.
---
I haven't gotten good with the hag yet and I don't see her in games much so maybe this is way I didn't consider her high tier. Thanks for clearing this up.
---
I don't even play doctor but even then genrushing isn't even a thing it's just don't the objective
---
Rofl
---
It's almost as if this is a mockup
---
Yeah but he's not right, either.
---
I feel the same about Doc. His lunge seems off, it just feels weird compared to other killers.
---
true lmao
---
It's just dumb lmaooooo
---
Interesting, I might try that next time around. Happy cake day!

---
I don't know why this phenomenon seems to happen but the less effort put into a meme the funnier it is God damn.
---
This cosplay is so cute! Love the knitting needle touch hitting home with the original Halloween, although the glass shard is way more badass.  Thinking of doing Grandpa Myers and Grandma Laurie?
---
Even so, I still stand by my decision that Deja Vu does not need any major changes. It's an underrated perk that no one bothers to use, but that does not automatically = bad design or a bad perk.
---
It has a use, and that use isn't even situational. A 15% increase in repair speed to three random generators wouldn't make it that much better or even more popular, nor would the increased bloodpoints or the skill check reduction.
---
Add to the fact that you're trying to do too much with the perk, as having 4 features makes it feel over buffed and overcompensated for, and you have my reasons for why a change of this nature is something I would disagree with.
---
Her EYES
---
I do wish that No Mither was more generally useful and do agree that it's really poorly balanced currently.
---
What is the longest and shortest game record.
---
not gonna lie, i start gen tapping sometimes if i start getting quick skillchecks back to back with ruin up lol
---
What if... You remove no mither with fragile, they get bloodpoints 25%/35%/50% and can recover fully (maybe all game and maybe once) and when they hit the second phase, they still have to struggle but it doesnt affect if they die on hook the next time. This way the killer doesnt know if they can recover or not.
---
Totally!

13/10 paint skills

i can almost hear gas gas gas

Music sucks

No shock big cock Doc is hilarious to play versus

Shrimp Viscampi, at your service

Not sure why that guy keeps saying each has their own, only 4 have their own, otherwise there is main menu, survivor, and killer versions.
---
Bc some people are just bad. Trust me. I had 3 killers in a row do that to me tonight.
---
Lmfao, you're pathetic.
---
But the viable strategy.
---
The sad thing, I wanted to save a hooked teammate before, and he stood there "rooted" how he did it with me later on
---
Meme builds are still fun in KYF
---
I would kill (Claudette) to see Michael Myers in a harry potter setting.
---
I spent 50 years in art school finally someone notices my artistic talent
---
Skip her. So many perks worth getting. Self care is crap. I would argue empathy is better. And botany knowledge is decent. 
---
Med Kit and Well Make it should take care of all healing needs. Run Bond or Aftercare if you want people to heal you! Dwight, Nea, Meg and Jeff have some of the best perks IMO.
---
What killers do after the trials

she doesnt look very happy tho, this was the best smile i can get out of her model
---
Desperation, stupidity, spite and not knowing any better. 
---
All can be reasons that people facecamp
---
A perk where you can see your scratch marks would be AWESOME because 1. it doesn‚Äôt really affect the killer‚Äôs ability to hit you (like MoM, exhaustion perks, etc), 3. it isn‚Äôt OP as fucc, 3. and would enable more sneaky gameplay, as opposed to the outright, literal jumping out of a hiding spot to beat the killer‚Äôs ass that is Head On. 
---
I still like Head On though- it‚Äôs just not *my* preferred play style as survivor. 
---
Kudos on thinking of the scratch mark thing, I think it‚Äôs time we got something like that.
---
Two people trapped, two dead, I wonder why gens ain‚Äôt getting finished, bloody spirit isn‚Äôt working with the team.
---
For the clown you should go full on carnival food.
---
I'm talkin' falafel (could look like intestines), slushies , wafer fries, hotdogs (you could make the hotdogs look like the fingers he collects), basically anything breaded and fried. Its classic stuff but its also basic enough that you have a lot of wiggle room for creativity when it comes to decorating.
---
Idk just a thought. Can't wait for that stream!
---
What did the postgame chat look like?
---
Jake should be a fruit parfrait, considering how long hes braved the forest, and maybe some venison
---
3 minutes? Hell just make it 30 seconds, they have no reason to stand still for longer than that.
---
Don't do it with ruin it makes skill checks easier.
---
lol i was waiting for it
---
She waifu, ngl
---
‚ÄúBehind those eyes is simply, pure evil.‚Äù
---
Some really good ideas here!
---
Meg: I think a stack of Japanese fluffy pancakes would be a great idea, I know runners really love eating pancakes for a carb overload. I think doing something healthy to accompany the carbs would be a nice touch, since runners also need to eat clean. A salad, acai bowl or smoothie might be a nice option. 
---
Feng: She spent most of her time in game cafe's and left home. I was thinking of instant ramen dishes, but with fancy hacks incorporated into them or maybe some mapo tofu, for when she cooks for herself? Fried eggplant with chili's is also great. 
---
Claudette: She's Canadian, so....that means poutine (jk)! But, that also leaves room for other ideas. Most Black people in Canadian tend to be from Caribbean roots. Her name makes me think she has Haitian parents, because the last name is French and for some reason Caribbean parents love giving their kids old fashion sounding names. But, making some Haitian food and a nice salad would suit her well. 
---
Quentin: Yeah, sugar &amp; more sugar. He wants a sugar rush and tons of caffeine. Caffeinated brownies with coffee ice cream, Tiramisu....cafe mocha. 
---
Jake: Jake wanted nothing to do with his upbringing and left his life of luxury. I could do something with wild game (Duck or Venison) with a nice rustic look to it and then do more food stall type of Korean dishes. 
---
Jane: Latin American cuisine is my weak point, I might need help with some ideas. I might do sous vide for that and go full food science geek with this one.
---
That's a scumbag move, but if you wanna be extra scummy chose the side of the map and gens next to ruin or devour
---
How? Is popping all the gens in 5 minutes a scumbag move?
---
trade didn‚Äôt like the session, so he had gutted me like a fish to see what my insides looked like, but i didn‚Äôt die, he hung me from a tree and i crystallized and now i‚Äôm a glamazon bitch ready for the runway

---
You can window tech, bait a pallet drop, bait a vault, etc. 
---
There is plenty of things you can do.
---
Imo but a lot of these posts make claim of looping the killer for five gens. Seems a little suspecious.
---
Why not though? If a 4 man team comes in all with tool boxes those gens will go quick. I've done it. A team of 2 can go from gen to gen rather quickly. It's stupid to not have a way to slow this down without running a hex or another perk. If you have a good survivor team they make the killer their bitch basically. A good killer vs a equally skilled survivor team could easily lose. It's funny how it's just scummy if it's a killer tactic but you think rushing gens isn't scummy that's stupid. Also gen related perks shouldn't be mandatory to my builds but after you get burnt enough times you bring it. I can play all day and constantly get 4k run into one okay swf group and get zero kills. Straight up no counterplay at times.
---
Lol ‚ÄúdOnT dO tHe TaSk ThE GaMe ReQuIrEs‚Äù
---
I have a couple ideas because food and this game are two of my favorite things!!
---
Trapper: Perhaps peanut brittle shaped like a bear trap?? Something sharp
---
Wraith: I was thinking of something that disappears, so cotton candy? He is African though and I don't know much about African dishes...a shame since he's my Killer main :c
---
Hillbilly: Definitely something wild. He has a rabbit strapped to his hip on one of his skins, so maybe flame grilled rabbit skewers?
---
Nurse: She was very sweet and loving towards her husband in her lore and worked hard, so I really would like a dessert type dish for her. I don't know how you can incorporate smoke into that, maybe like a creme brulee that you light on fire?
---
Just some ideas for the main 4 c:
---
They should let you rate survivors like Overwatch has with its endorsements system. If their rating is too low you should be able to vote kick from lobby
---
Excuse me, what the fuck?
---
I was planning to camp this year, I can maybe do Jakes stream out doors and make some delicious wild game. Then do the rest of his food in another stream. I really want to make some wild game for his dish.
---
Doesn't matter that you can find people when they can run you through a ton of broken random generation windows that can spawn on that map.
---
I've pretty much switched to a Freddy main from Spirit, and have shot up to purple ranks... I think he's fine ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Maybe slightly decrease base transition time or something, but I hope it's not a top to bottom rework.
---
Very clever idea! I can totally do that.
---
But the screams, tho...
---
Swap out Discordance for Unnerving, then we can talk.
---
if anything this would help stop two people running the same perks, how is it dumb?
---
BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, and Spirit Fury work amazing, the last two especially. You thought that pallet stun was gonna stop you from getting EW3'd? Nah, barrel right through that stun and get a free down.
---
theres 6 stones dude.....
---
where is wednesday?
---
I thought so too 
---
 |    | 
---
Thats how much i needed to double pip
---
That honestly sounds delicious! 
---
For the nurse I was thinking more hospital aesthetic foods. I was sick a lot as a kid and hospital food was pretty plain since you can't digest well when sick. Some of the stuff I ate quite a bit in hospital was:
---
 Jello- stomach flu
---
Vanilla ice cream - strep throat/tonsillitis
---
Plain spaghetti with butter an parmisian cheese- stomach flu or sinus infetions
---
Buttered toast or toast with jam- everything except strep throat (worst mistake of my life lmao)
---
I definitely ate more soft foods than crunchy foods and when I was feeling REALLY sick I ate white rice and bone broth or beef/chicken broth mixed together. Chicken noodle soup is a classic and I only ever ate it with saltines. I have also eaten my fair share of cream of mushroom soup.
---
Maybe for the hag you could make haggis? Its basically organs, it has hag in the name, and the hag eats your organs! Its a match made in hell :)
---
I actually had a kid who streamed and was playing lf, downed me because I ran into a hut and no window. He literally watched me as I was downed for the whole game.
---
It's weird that his name is never mentioned in most streamer posts but I find him more entertaining than the other streamera.
---
So you're saying a four man with shitty perks like dark sense, technician, open handed, and left behind would do fine? No I'm guessing not, the reason being needing good perks to slow down the game... Isn't a balance issue. Killers need good perks, survivors need good perks, that's how balance is in the game. You being able to run stupid perks and get a 4k with any character is *unbalanced*.
---
&gt;It's funny how it's just scummy if it's a killer tactic but you think rushing gens isn't scummy that's stupid. Also gen related perks shouldn't be mandatory to my builds but after you get burnt enough times you bring it.
---
You clearly didn't read what I just said either. 
---
&gt;I can play all day and constantly get 4k run into one okay swf group and get zero kills. Straight up no counterplay at times.
---
They're bad, but most of the time they get way too over altruistic. All you have to do is again, take smart loops, and don't focus on downing them, just bounce around and let them over heal each other until you get them in a odd position. Counter play is easy.
---
Im pretty sure the devs have shown a naked clown model on stream before.
---
KYF?
---
Kill Your Friends
---
Its just doc for me. I have to remember to get just a little closer with him. Trapper I hit through pallets all the time. Doc it feels like I should just be in range and whifffff. Even a slow killer like Hag I dont miss much with. Idk mind game myself I guess .
---
I kinda just check in on him more than watch him...
---
I had the idea that what you have for Paramedic should be an added effect to We're Gonna Live Forever.  the devs seem really intent on not adding any gameplay benefit to the perk though... not sure why they let the killer's farming perk actually be meta and not the survivors' one
---
Honestly, the idea of tunneling is a joke that shouldn't even exist. If you're a poor survivor and the killer singles you out because you've made poor movement choices, that's your fault, not theirs. If you've moved well and the killer is focusing on you because you're a problem for them, be proud of your skills and make it last as long as you can and count on your teammates. Stop trying to find a reason to not be proud or self critical about your own gameplay.
---
That's the irony of this game. If you get downed quickly, it's because the killer tunneled, not because you played poorly. Conversely, if you loop the killer endlessly, it's because you're a survivor superstar, and not because the killer played poorly. It's a mindset that unfortunately creates a very toxic environment.
---
I don‚Äôt think a survivor unsafely unhooking their teammate while I‚Äôm chasing them makes me a tunneler, and if I happen to hit the unhooked dude it sucks for them, but their teammate messed up.
---
There is another use. In Spirit, if you go Insidious before phase walking away, your terror radius stays at 0.
---
Interesting. I've noticed Doctors beelining right for me across the map but always assumed it was some perk I wasn't aware they had, like Nurse's or Surveillance.
---
That is true but the perk existed way before spirit
---
Hm. Didn't know this.
---
Doc is amazing for antigen. Combined with Unnerving Presence, Distressing, and Overcharge, the 66% chance of an odd skillcheck is fantastic. Onmy thing that makes it better is Huntress' Lullaby.
---
Nothing of sustenance
---
Tunneling doesn't always increase your chance of winning though. By tunneling, you are not applying gen pressure or injuring other survivors to force them to waste time healing.
---
Noed has a counter built right in. Cleanse the totems. If you got chased for 5 gens, I‚Äôm sure you safety pipped and I‚Äôm sure the killer depipped. That‚Äôs a win, not sure what the actual issue is here.
---
Hag....we can't forget about her. I really like the idea of haggis, but its hard to make correctly and I wouldn't want people getting sick. Secondly, I think those ingredients might be hard to come by for most people. Liver might be a better choice and more readily available.
---
hey look I got downvoted to hell for expressing an opinion, pog
---
Undeniably, Pig got nerfed. She's less versatile now and as a result you can't be as cheeky, which was one of her biggest strengths. I just don't see how she was gutted.
---
Noed in the matter of seconds can give a killer a 4K if they have done poorly the whole game and if you can‚Äôt find the totem and the killer is camping you your dead ... and ds was reworked and unbreakable punishes killers who slug ... it needs a nerf like the tier 1 and 2 shouldn‚Äôt have the exposed status affect or put a 1 min timer on it
---
Who the fuck invited Bricky?
---
Except for Tier 1 myers, Nurse Blink hits, and I think Tier 3 Myers too, all killers have the same lunge.
---
I don;t know about you, but I'd take fragile with no mither for the meemes
---
You're killing them too efficiently, getting points from smacking and hooking only which is capped. if you keep the game going a little longer and kick a few gens you'll start getting more pips and bloodpoints than if you destroy them immediately. And remember that when a survivor burns BPS, too many killers end up making them a waste by going all sweaty so that they get only 12k points and survivors get like 5k at most.
---
Can‚Äôt MoM activate multiple times though? Like 3, hits, next does nothing, repeat?
---
Maybe on console. Once you get used to aiming the blinks on PC though there is no counterplay.
---
ur the best owo
---
Not anymore, they're the same now. Freddy's just feels insane because he's smaller than other killers, it's still the same distance
---
Yeah, they need to be updated.
---
Hahahahaha. The second nickname is the only direct take, lol
---
Yessssss!!!! I use it, too!! It helps so much - since I don‚Äôt make noise with Iron Will, I can easily use Diversion to distract and push the killer away. And then I usually yell out - GET PEBBLED, BITCH!
---
You're* learn some grammar pal. Also if you didn't want to hear people say something you'd disagree with then don't make a post on the internet. :) I was just sharing my thoughts.
---
I'd want to learn more about the entity itself, and what killers do between trials.
---
And don't forget the snowball potential, even if it's broken in the first minute that's a full minute where at least one survivor wasn't doing a gen and was easier to find. With someone on hook the game slows down massively because at least one guy will get ready for an unhook (maybe more) and one guy is out of action for a bit
---
Your
---
I don't like using it and think it's heavily overrated on many killers. Have no real issues with using it on shit-tier killers tho
---
I think what was the most suspicious about his post is that he said for "5 gens PLUS MORE" like he didn't even specify how many extra gens he ran the killer for. ;)
---
i'd be the one to change my mind. 
---
i kind of stopped using hex perks when Rin came out cause she used to be the killer alongside with Billy and Nurse and Huntress that absolutely don't need ruin. till they changed Prove Thyself and definitely tweaked boxes but didn't announce that. i play for over a year now and seen the times with old bnp. yeah, was nasty but without old bnp gens were never popping as fast as these days with just randoms on a map.
---
so since the change to Prove Thyself i've been a bit struggling - where i used to have enough time to hook everyone 3 times for only 2-3 gens to pop now at least 1 gen pops if i wasn't lucky to find someone within first 10 seconds in a game. and that's with Rin.
---
i also like playing Trapper and i used to be able to trap most of the map for only two gens to pop. now it's 3 and half of fourth gen is done and there goes my chase time, can only rely on people getting in traps now.
---
yesterday first time switched to ruin instead PgTW. man... if they don't find it at start, it does make difference. i was ruinless for months, i feel how much time it saves.
---
though it sickens me it's the only way to not get cucked by Gatekeeper emblem with these pipping changes(don't mind me, i just feel the need to have perfect score in matches. if i didn't even 4k don't matter).
---
The survivors will hate you if they choose to regardless of your build.
---
Thank youu!
---
This one brings joy
---
The mask production company is bring out the mask and knife from the original film, so we were thinking of trying that!

Fragile: "first phase lasts 80 seconds"
---
*Meg unhooks me in front of the killer 5 seconds after I was hooked*
---
How tho
---
Killer's would dodge lobbies so much more often. lol
---
Hi! I remember you from my Identity V days.
---
Chuck is the dumbest idea for a killer in a game that involves hooking survivors lol. I want Ghostface damnit.
---
I would kill to have ghostface! Idk if they would add him after legion tho :( really hope so because he would be really fun to play with
---
The meme you posted. It's from an internet show called Buzzfeed Unsolved.
---
I have fun with him! I‚Äôm a survivor main, and otherwise LF or spirit. But Freddy is the most entertaining to play cause I can tell survivors are freaked out by him.
---
Oh my god that‚Äôs scary
---
For dbd yes. I enjoyed theif sim but I dont watch any of his other game series really.
---
r/imverycool
---
He‚Äôs the only Fog Whisperer I regularly watch. He‚Äôs fairly pleasant and kind-spirited, which is a great contrast to how the game makes me feel when I‚Äôm actually playing it.  First streamer I regularly watched, as well.
---
My first match using Head On ever I hid in a locker near where the killer had just downed someone. Coincidentally enough, the killers path to the hook lead right past my locker. I waited for just the right moment, busted out, and they dropped the survivor. I was nervous/giddy laughing as I ran away. Haven't pulled that off since but it has helped me out several times.
---
boo fucking hoo. this sub is filled entirely by people complaining about anything and everything that this game is. little baby survs and killers. you‚Äôre not special.
---
Admit it, you wanna see him carry someone to a hook though...
---
For the love of GOD we need a ghost face! I‚Äôve been dreaming of playing against him since I first bought the damn game üò≠üò≠ that would be the coolest thing ever
---
okay maybe I‚Äôd like to see that.,,,
---
Way too broken ü§£
---
Want to show you have no skill? Want 100% birth control? NOED is for you!
---
She is a fan favorite of the game series and very tough so only makes sense lol
---
I agree with the trapper thing, but I play nurse, and let me tell you, no matter what perks I have on nurse, I will always 4k. There are no exceptions. Her kit is completely busted. And don't get me started on 3 blinks. The only way to counter a nurse with 2 blinks is via jukes. But if you have 3 blinks, you can't juke. You just hope she misses. Her regular perks are also really good, since thanatophobia can really slow the game down, and because you are playing nurse, it's normal to be slapping more than 1 more person at a time. Stridor can also be good, as it counters Iron will, and it can be used to find survivors who are hiding from you.
---
I don't know about Billy, since I don't play against many Billy's and I don't play him myself.
---
I would argue here that Huntress is the most balanced killer. She is 110% speed, but to make up for that, she can throw her hatchets. If you are good at survivor, you can juke those hatchets. If you are good at Huntress, you can hit your hatchets. Her perks are kinda shit (except maybe Huntress' lullaby), but she can be powerful, if you are good at the game. If I lose against a Huntress I would say it's my fault. Not the Huntress' fault for being broken, but my fault because I didn't dodge her hatchets or something.
---
he was being sarcastic.
---
i guess
---
Reality is often disappointing...
---
&gt; Then there's freddy who's power literally just puts him at a disadvantage except when facing immersed survivors.
---
Apart from his stall, stealth, tracking and good m1 mindgames yeah sure his power puts him at a disadvantage lmao
---
Is it really shocking? It's the internet.
---
Yeah, I was suggesting something along those lines. But, runners do enjoy a high carbs before a run, because it provides fuel for the body in the form of glycogen that is stored in the muscles. But, you also need a balance and I think something fruity would be nice for after the run. I keep going back to Acai bowls because their basically a smoothie in a bowl, super health and you can be very creative with the toppings.
---
911, I'd like to report a murder, a man has been burnt alive and he's not moving anymore.
---
then they revealed the true you.
---
So yes...the role of killer is to kill but due to the majority of the playerbase being survivor mains it was altered. You can continue to play that way it wont rank you up as fast but you get to kill. Its weird i know but the devs kinda pander towards the majority of the playerbase.
---
I've seen a few pretty good plague players. The best thing going for her is she can throw up over anything.
---
I really liked when it was piano for main screen, electric/metal guitar for killer, and acoustic for survivor! but rip, then it was that super annoying like 80s metal version instead.
---
I‚Äôve always wondered what the hell the three things he said were thank you for this
---
You gotta block their names pal.
---
I agree with the changes they're making to it, but am I the only one who thinks it should be buffed? You should get a stack for more than just unhooks and taking hits (which is very unreliable from my experiences). I think maybe picking survivors up from the dying state, unhooking yourself, or picking yourself up from the dying state should grant a stack as well, because it's rare that you'll get all 4 stacks without playing super aggressively
---
Jokes on you Iv seen the movie
---
Just cause you think chuckys a dumb idea doesnt mean I wouldn't like to see one of my favorite horror icons in a game. Honestly if they never add a super short killer it's a missed opportunity. Building all new mechanics means it's probably not going to happen though.
---
Have to disagree. MoM is like a get out of jail card because it can give a survivor a free escape. There is no drawback to it, fairly simple to get activated, adds an unneeded step to get a survivor.
---
I agree, u have to try really hard to get 4 stacks. I think it should come with other benefits or more ways to earn tokens.
---
I just think he‚Äôs boring, I‚Äôm really not a fan of any of his movies &amp; overall don‚Äôt like him as a killer. just my personal opinion though! I do agree about a short killer being a cool add tho
---
You get stacks for taking hits but there's a limit to 1 per hook life. If someone body blocks, then you bodyblock you won't get anything.
---
Downvoted for hurting my feelings with the truth.
---
No
---
I can see counters for these perks so she would be a fair person to add to the game. Maybe add something to Derision like if you hit the skill check, when dropped your bar goes to the find help bit giving others time to come help you but at risk of getting hit/downed. Vitality seems to be the op perk. The healing factor maybe would only heal to say 50% of the health bar. The speed boost may work but would need to be probably lowered to a smaller amount or keep the same till the 50% is hit then the perk deactivates for a certain amount of time. You could also say that instead of haste it grants immunity to effects such as blindness or exhaustion which would be caused by a killer add on.
---
I hate playing against her tho.. she is residentsleeper af..
---
It's a realistic option and gets the objective done, the point of a game is to win and play through the objective
---
Seriously, BBQ is the best perk in the game and WGLF is a fucking shit stain that infuriates your teammates.
---
Believe It!
---
I always seem to get absolutely shit on by anyone playing the plague
---
Any perk that gives a survivor a free escape is a crutch. If i hit a survivor once, and hit them again, I expect them to go down. With mettle of man, that changes. Now i have to play safer because i could end up losing someone because of a pallet they just barely reach thanks to it. It's bullshit.
---
Thanks for your input I'll see what I can do to make them more balanced.
---
it was on way too long, but i still choose it over all other chapter specific ones.
---
I would much rather see leprechaun.
---
what? the clown‚Äôs was awesome!
---
Looks like you are gonna piss off more people than un-nerfed Legion with Frank Fix Tape
---
As if you are?
---
Can‚Äôt wait for everyone to leave while I run my no moither meme build
---
If you're newer to the game, Bitter Murmur and Whispers are nice, but you'll eventually wanna move away from those perks since you should get used to finding survivors without them! But overall it's a nice simple build!
---
I will share these perks a little later ;)
---
Killers need to earn something as powerful as No One Escapes Death. Survivors shouldn't have to stop it. Killers receive it for losing the game and don't have to work for it at all. All of the other potentially really strong perks require the killer to earn their reward such as Remember Me, Hex: Huntress' Lullaby etc., except this perk.
---
Ik! Havent seen it suggested yet. So idk
---
I wouldn‚Äòt use Whispers 1 since it doesn‚Äòt do anything at all (Radius is way too big) 
---
Since you don‚Äòt have good perks otherwise I would probably go with Deerstalker instead.
---
I just get sick of all these people with 20 hours in game saying nurse is OP
---
You suck. You are going to get a good perk nerfed to death like the last decent perk that was nerfed. I'm saying you suck. I play killer more than anything and it's never gotten to the point I had to whine over a perk. It's super funny I just point out the obvious and you get super salty. Go fuck yourself dude. Get good already.
---
That's photoshopped.
---
Dine on Swine for the Pig. Porchetta might be a nice one for this. There is so much that can be made for the Spirit, since she was student I would vote for Okonomiyaki or Ramen. I was looking up the Doctor's wiki and it says he's African American?! I had no idea. It looks like he's from Illinois. Hmm, I'll have to return to that. I know a few famous dishes from that area, but its hard to see a doctor eating them (deep-dish pizza, fried chicken, horseshoe sandwich). So, I have a lot to think about. Myers is also from Illinois.....I might try the horseshoe sandwich with him or maybe hospital/asylum food. Since Legion is Canadian, why not try different variations of poutine that represent the F.J.S.J or I can make Canadian mac'n'cheese topped with a homemade ketchup (Yes, most Canadian's top our Kraft with ketchup).

It's edited. You can tell by the eyes, left is blurry and the right one is clearly cut around closer and sharper looking.

I know man. Especially at rank 20 nurses suck. I dont let those people get me heated no one actually listens to them.
---
Pretty!!! I can't wait to see more!!
---
Agreed. If your killer is strictly m1, there's literally no counterplay other than ignoring the obsession. Oh wait, that's one of the reasons why the devs wanted to change old DS.................
---
im not sure if you serious or not because tunneling is an actual issue. It's not just made up because survivors want to complain. if you chase a survivor for 5 gens you just suck because a decent killers knows when to give up chase and if you chase a survivor off hook and not at least try to injure the survivor who saved him your an asshole and deserve to be ds'd. ds is literally anti- tunnel only.
---
Yelling git gud doesn't remove the problems with the perk. You're the one yelling "LOL SALTY GIT GUD" when i point out it's kinda bullshit.
---
I'm quitting DBD because of entitled little children like you acting like survivors are perfectly balanced and killers are terrible.
---
Yes, if you know you're going to play a lot, it's fine. But if you underestimate it, it's gonna suck. And you can't like stop mid prestige, that would suck even more xD
---
Like my Legion is prestige 3 now, but I burnt out when I reached it and now they're level 1. Prestige 3 but level 1.
---
Those look great! I always love to see perks with cool different colorations.
---
Yay! I think its safe to say we're doing a Full English Breakfast for David. I'll start preparing a recipe list for everything. I feel like that is a great choice, since I would love to have breakfast/lunch/dinner options.
---
You get blood points for every action. As such, someone who breaks pallets, kicks gens, smacks every survivor multiple times, uses their power a lot and hooks people repeatedly will get a ton more blood points than someone who just face camps every hook they get. The former requires more skill and is more fun for everyone than the latter so it‚Äôs rewarded with more points.
---
yeah thats good for everyone else but you. If your getting chased for 3 gens n up that killer isnt going to let that survivor go easily and will resort to camping also its not fun to constantly have the killer on your back and you not be able to anything but run around.
---
Written bad? I don't see the struggle at all.
---
I'm going to be a condescending prick because I'm pretty tired atm.
---
Sitting on three generators takes itty bitty baby skill. Being able to gen rush isn't much harder, but it definitely doesn't take low skill if you're not a brain dead killer. Don't cry because you have to use good perks to 4 man with 5 gens, because likewise it takes good perks to get those gens done and loop without getting anybody hooked, as seems to be a hUge IsSuE with the game.
---
As for "triggered" lmao is it 2016 again.
---
The only thing added was the mouth, everything else is original. üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
If these players do not have time for wait 1 minute, they will also be DC if they do not like something in the game. So in this case it will be better if they leave.
---
I had to go into the comments to figure out who tf Phillip was
---
oh for sure and if it doesn't work well they can roll it back but these servers help them by giving info they never had before so it can in theory only get better I am gonna stay optimistic about it
---
I honestly dont wanna know what a dish inspired on The Plague is like
---
I‚Äôve had times where my MoM has been active with 3 gens left leaving my aura visible for most of the match, and I‚Äôve had games where it‚Äôs never even been active. I can see it being annoying if the killer is struggling at getting hooks but shouldn‚Äôt be an issue if they‚Äôre doing ok.
---
I just don't like how it segregates Killers even more than they already are.
---
Killers like Freddy, Wraith, and Doctor have no real way to counter MoM while Killers like Huntress, Legion, and Nurse can counter it by just using their power effectively.
---
Something about that really doesn't sit right with me.
---
Breaking a pallet, damaging a generator or hooking a survivor.? Yes
---
I didnt use insidious once actually...was trying new perks based off this website that rates perks for certain killers: https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/killers/
---
and since when is someone "terrible" because they use something that is in the game? Using insidious doesnt mean "camp only" it can be used strategically...
---
When your eye is focusing in, it's not really about size it's more so about timing (I'm not sure how much sense that makes). The timing of ruin is always in the begining, it doesn't matter how big or small the skill check is it will always be at the begining. The difference is that with a normal sized skill check when you focus in on it there is much more room for error as it takes up maybe 10% of the skillcheck, when you have a smaller skill check the great is the same size but the other area is not. The great now takes up maybe 40% of the skill check, meaning as long as you just focus and hit the skill check in general, you have four times the chance of hitting the great.
---
Lol. No. Whatever it would be it would have to be a entirely new animation. I seen some people say chucky should use voodoo. I say no. We would need a little person accessible hook. It can still be high up just put a chain and crank. The hook rest on the ground the little guy stabs you and cranks you up. The big deal is the carrying. Idk how that would ever work unless it was just a half assed struggle drag. Getting flashlight saves would he a nightmare there are a lot of questions on how it would work that makes me think the dev's wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.
---
I have. She hadn‚Äôt played Nurse in a while, got 1 person and was very pleasant person in end-game. 
---
I‚Äôm a Legacy Nurse, it doesn‚Äôt make me omnipotent and always get 4K‚Äôs with her, **especially** if you‚Äôre rusty. If you go up against good enough survivors who can do good blink jukes, stay efficient on gens and are good at hiding when not in chase, you still have a good chance at winning.
---
SHIRTLESS DWIGHT
---
Yeah it's wonky the best guarantee is unhook and taking a hit by the hanging body lol
---
You mean nurse players who use OP addon combos like three blinks or omega blink. Basic nurse, is hard but counterable. A good/decent nurse are even really fun to face against, because they are game changers when it comes to chases.
---
Cant really criticize chucky when you said in a previous comment youd kill to have ghostface who is the most bland killer of them all (has nothing unique to him except for maybe his mask. The movies is what made the character good) 
---
dont get me wrong I'd love ghostface more then anyone in dbd but dont understand how a character like Chucky, a serial killer who used voodoo to get into a possessed doll, is more boring then a literal parody of horror characters. He doesn't fit in DBD and ghostface definitely does you're right buuuut boring?
---
I also would love to have more info on my teammates but maybe rather have a 'on-hover' reveal of the individual perks, items etc. rather than this. A little cluttered IMO, could be difficult to differentiate what perks or items go to who in just a glance. 
---
Good suggestion overall OP
---
Exactly. If you don't have some alternate form of attack it's near impossible to actually counter.
---
New Killer: Ermac
---
Killer Ability: Rip the arms off survivors, preventing them from interacting with anything.
---
Or maybe get a stack, every time a survivor is safe unhooked. if a survivor is not safely unhooked, the unhooker loses a stack. This could be the same as BBQ, doing your job as a team and get rewarded for it.
---
Lol I'm aware hence why I lamp shades with "I'm going to be a condescending prick". The moment I said itty bitty baby, again I wasn't expecting to be taken seriously, the point was to make it simpler and point out the absurdity of catering to people with comprehension issues, while restating my point.
---
May reinstall later idk.
---
Yeah, I said it‚Äôs just my personal opinion! I personally don‚Äôt find anything appealing about any of the chucky movies, or chucky himself. There was nothing about the movies or the killer that would make me want to play as him or with him. 
---
Ghostface is funny and scream has been one of my favourite movies for years and years. Even if he doesn‚Äôt make sense necessarily in dbd, it would just fit my personal interests really well and I would love it c: 
---
(This is also coming from someone who mains Freddy just because I like his concept; even tho he‚Äôs trash)
---
Average and bad nurses are balanced. Good nurses are not.
---
I got stuck against a tree in cold wind once and was playing against a Billy, but he was nice enough to down me and let me go. Probably because he had already found someone else to chase, at the end of the game it was just me and Jake left and we did all gens i offered him to kill me, since he just killed Jake for the 4k but he didn't want to and put me at the exit.
---
I love that lmao
---
Yea, going against god nurse with that new screaming perk is awesome. Everyone on a ground in about 2-3 minutes. If one person completely ignores the slaughter he might do one gen, and when go and die.
---
Brian as piggie.
---
That makes sense, so it works like the benevolence emblem in a way. I was also thinking you should get a stack every time you rescue someone from a killers shoulder, like a flashlight or pallet save
---
Not unpopular, just stupid, difference between solo and swf makes the game hard to balance.
---
Didnt use insidious once actually... I was trying new perks based off this website that rates perks for certain killers: https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/killers/
---
so yea...stay mad
---
UwU
---
I‚Äôd quite like to see how many games where the first disconnect has led to a 4K versus when no survivor DC‚Äôs the entire game. 
---
Just so people can see how damaging it is when you get a complete dick as a teammate.
---
Just kick him around like he's a red-headed soccer ball. Roll the laugh track and credits. Chucky isn't scary, he's like two feet tall, and that's being generous.
---
Why does everybody think that the game is over the moment the gens are done? I understand it can be annoying to get hit by NOED but I really don't see a big difference to Adrenaline: You are a moment away from escaping the killer, but then he downs you in one hit. The other side: You are a moment aways from downing a survivor but he suddenly gets a sprintburst and heals up a state. Both these perks were useless before that point. Both could be deactivated before: Sacrifice the survivor / cleanse totems before the last gen pops. 
---
And even if they perks come into play it is still not the end of the world:
---
Is it possible that a survivor only survives because of Adrenaline? Yes. Does that mean the survivor doesn't deserve that escape? No.  
---
Is it possible that a killer only gets a survivor because of NOES? Yes. Does that mean the killer doesn't deserve that kill? No.
---
Does NOED have the potential to turn a 0K into a 4K? Yes it does. How often does that happen? Like in 5% of all games where NOED is used, the most likely outcome is one extra kill.
---
Does Adrenaline have the potential to turn a 4K into a 0K? Yes it does. How often does that happen? Like in 5% of all games where Adrenaline is used, the most likely outcome is that the survivor who uses it can run the killer around for another minute, giving the team enough time to open a gate safely.
---
Both perks depend heavily on how coordinated a survivor team is. If you have Adrenaline and you run the killer around, your team can open the exit. If your team is coordinated the chances that NOED will trigger go down drastically. And even if it triggers, it is very possible that the killer will only be able to use the one down hit ones. NOED doesn't reward bad play from the killers side (don't get me wrong it still benefits the killer, but regardless if he is good or bad), it punishes bad teamplay. And as much as it sucks: If you are the only person in your team that tries to play as a team: You will still get punished for what your team did wrong because it's 4 v. 1 and not 1 vs. 1 in 4 cases.
---
Shadowborn is never a perk I seen anyone write home about. I'm thinking it makes you more sensitive to flash lights so if you see people in your lobby with them maybe switch it out. On the other hand lightborn makes you immune to flashlights to a certain degree. I can reccomend a ton of great perks but you dont have them on your wraith as far as I can see.
---
Hope
---
"Buckle up, fuckos! Let's roll."
---
Ok... makes sense, thanks
---
Lol you were playing Insidious Camper Bubba you knew what your loadout was dude.  That perk is good for one thing and it was the thing you brought it in that game to do.  Just don't man.
---
That's what they're changing in the mid-chapter patch, minus the losing a stack for unsafe unhooks.
---
Yes but there are people who only farm to get WGLF stacks so this does stop them at least.
---
it's always nice when your team fucking sucks and DCs but the killer has mercy
---
how 2 counterplay survivor hud
---
go to his wiki, it's there
---
A killer being difficult shouldn't be a justification for them being necassarily stronger than others. Survivors don't have control over how good the killer is at playing whatever it is that they are playing, so they shouldn't be punished for it. In a perfect world, a good Nurse would have the same chances of winning as a good Trapper or a good Freddy.
---
this is actually great, nice wp
---
Just looked at your past work. They are amazing. How did I only see them now??!
---
r/ihadastroke
---
its great, can we get it in hd 1920x1080 ?
---
What perks do you think are good even if I don‚Äôt have them cuz I might come back to this thread later when I level up
---
I stay around rank 8-12 usually. It all just depends on if they go looking for it and find it. They usually do but it slows down the game enough at the start. Honestly most people just power through it. It's a pain if two people are trying to power through it and they aren't hitting greats. I usually always run it though I always have and I haven't really tried running without it much. I basically use it to slow down the first few minutes and someone always finds it so I try to walk by the totem a few times to see if I can get a easy hook from it. That usually works unless I'm going against s really good team or a really bad team. It's basically just a perk that is only around longer than 5 minutes because of luck. The spawns are usually a joke it's so easy. I've also gotten great totem spawns and it still gets cleansed quick.
---
Maybe don't bunch up in an orgy on one gen at the start. Against any killer really, but especially not nurse.
---
I don't want survivors have MORE communication then they already have, because it defeats the original purpose of the game. Remember, SWF was not in the game to start with, it was only randoms. Being able to see that someone has say, a sabo toolbox, then I could bring one too cause I know hes gonna do it too. It simply provides too much info between randoms. Unless the killer gets to see all this info too, then I don't think this is a good idea balance why.
---
Number of times a Survivor has left the game after things not going perfectly for them in the first 30 seconds, separated between when I'm killing or surviving
---
Oof. This looks kinda like Ace ones, but still look badass. I‚Äôm waiting for all perks, and definitely installing them! ;D
---
It is still a terrible idea. Noed right now at least takes up a perk slot, you want to give all killers a free perk. Unlike Reverse Bear Traps noed kills people all the time. 
---
Ask most survivors the least fun perks to play against and NOED will always be high on that list, and now all killers automatically get it built in? That is in no way healthy for the game. People hated playing against legion because there was no counterplay and unfun mechanics, and while totems do have slight counterplay but nowhere do you give survivors a better reward for giving killers one of their top 4 perks absolutely free.
---
This would make it so anytime someone ran an already strong killer they would get even an even more powerful version. This doesn't add diversity, it just means the killers that are currently strong become stronger, and the ones that don't see much play will continue to not see play. The equivalent would be giving every survivor MoM and Adrenaline for free.
---
Maybe focus balance on perks that don't give exposed.
---
thanks
---
It depends on what you want to be able to do. I run spirit furry so every third pallet gets automatically broken when you are stunned. If you pair that with endurance and brutal strength then you basically ignore pallets in chases. I personally like running a perk for gens a perk for pallets a tracking perk and one random one. My builds exist of ruin to slow down the game just a little bit at the start. I always run bbq and chili for extra BP and to be able to see the survivor auras after every hook either endurance to negate stuns or brutal strength to quickly smash the pallets. Sometimes I run lightborn if I see a ton of flashlights so I cant repeatedly get pallet blinded. I run tinker so I see when gens get to 85% completion and if I'm close enough I can shut down the gen from popping. Bamboozle is good for chases so you can vault windows faster and the window stays blocked for a certain amount of time so the survivor has to find a new loop. Rancor is a fun perk. Your obsession becomes exposed when the gates are powered and you can one shot them and kill them instantly. Basically those are the only perks I have fooled with at this point because they seem to generally be the most useful ones. I tend to stay away from anything that's heavily situational on my killers.
---
Nah. Maybe if you consider the average nurse, but anyone who has logged serious hours into the character and is using decent add ons is about to fist your anus worse than an uncle from Alabama. You never truly beat a nurse in a chase, they just make a mistake and lose you.
---
Yes, set a lobby limit so only 2 claudettes at a time. That's an improvement!
---
Ive beaten plenty of good nurses and lost to plenty. Youre dumb to think the nurse isnt balanced.
---
She's a weak killer.
---
There is no good reason to change her in a way that's power negative.
---
EGC can justify a nerf, but not *this* nerf. She needs a nerf that doesn't make her worse than she was before EGC.
---
Tunneling can suck but it literally happens all the time. They cant fix something like that either and why dont you get points for it? I feel like you would. The same with camping. You will lose points for it but people still seem to do it. If you are that bent out of shape about it then maybe consider taking a short break from the game. It helps with the frustration.
---
Good argument based on facts and logic. I'm just going to call you the big dumb now and walk away from this lmao.
---
Thats cool have fun thinking stupid thoughts...
---
He‚Äôs a loveable psychopath
---
That would be fantastic. Like I watched you get hooked and I was helpless to stop it but i seen the killer walk off into that direction and where do most of them take off to? Straight into the tunnel.
---
&gt;A killer that can teleport and ignore pallets, windows, walls, and every other mechanic in the game is balanced
---
&gt;I'm the dumb one
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Nurse Blink hits, has been fixed a while ago. I think the same time, when huntress and hags lunge were changed as well.
---
All im getting from this post is "let me win."
---
It'd be a little tricky and would require some REAL data diving, but I think it'd be very telling of the status of the game.
---
Start with average times of matches, with killers NOT using ruin vs those with ruin. 
---
Followed by the information gained what the win/loss ratio for killers of said matches.
---
The idea of this would be to settle the constant "Gens are done too quick" "Ruin is a base required perk to compete" arguments we keep hearing/seeing
---
What did she say at the end?
---
You wont see much on first person but your hand. The thing that grinds my gears on the shop is if i go into cosmetics I select my killer or whoever go 8nto the outfits and I hit the back button and it throws me back to main shop menu. I want to go back and select a different person.
---
Happened to me 2 nights ago, got face camped by a huntress holding a hatchet the whole time. My friend stared at her with object of obsession the whole time while doing gens and then the huntress said he was hiding the whole game.
---
Bro. Party in the front star wars in the background.
---
I don't get what you mean, but interestingly that implies that both the killer and survivor can't win in one game. That's not entirely relevant, but it does feed into the killer mindset of "If I don't get a 4k with almost no gens popped and shitty perks that don't work good together, then this game is unbalanced."
---
Looks like what you "know" is incorrect. Didnt use insidious once; was trying new perks based off a site that rates perks for killers: https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/killers/
---
Using insidious doesnt mean "camp only" it can be used strategically...if you are intelligent...but I forgot I am talking to YOU. ;)
---
So piss right back off cunt
---
He would probably use the power of voodoo and carry someone with magic.
---
Guess it's true that DBD is pay2win.
---
No, I told you what I was doing. But because you are Gen Z you decide to create your own narrative...look I just fully realized you are Gen Z so I will pray for you. Alright?
---
The aura being visible is literally a decision that you make. And it's not even forced, you can 99 a heal and then just pop the last 1% when the killer finds you. Like, the fact that you don't use the perk to its potential doesn't mean that it's a balanced or healthy perk.
---
thanks :) &lt;3
---
No way. Noed has never got me 4k quickly. If I did bad all match I might get one or two hooks with noed. It's just a perk and it's good to run in certain ranks because the only way they pop all gens with 4 people left is if they got rushed or someone is good at looping the killer. I dont run it though. If I have 4 guys running around when the gates are going I've already lost the match. I don't agree with getting one person at the end unless you can get everyone or almost everyone.
---
That's exactly why I main him. I make sure everyone gets to escape and always protect the person getting tunneled.
---
Fortis Fortuna Auvat!
---
I wish they just make it so the timer doesnt go down when in chase or when slugged
---
As a survivor it's a team game. You help your team with doing gens, doing totems, helping teammates or distract the killer. If I distract the killer and another survivor goes for rescue, why shouldn't I be rewarded for it? If I do a gen, while another survivor goes for the rescue, I do something for the team. I can agree, that if you do nothing, you shouldn't be rewarded, but that will be hard to track.    
---
But in it's current state, this perk is useless.
---
Just play Nurse. It's what the devs want.
---
" you think he is gonna man up this time and not take NOED?"  *Last gen completed and NOED pops up*    
---
"why did I even ask"
---
You're right, OP. WE NEED HARAMBE IN THE GAME ASAP
---
This has not been my experience at all. Now given, I'm always trying to improve my jukes because I feel like I suck. But here's what I always face with a nurse:
---
* Running Ruin
---
* Running BBQ&amp;Chili, so as soon as someone goes down you have to waste time hopping in a locker. 
---
* Generally using good add-ons to add additional blink(s) and range
---
* Once two go down at the same time it's pretty much over. Most high rank nurses soft camp between the two and blink immediately to seek and destroy whenever one gets rescued. Usually slugs the injured survivor and then goes after the other one.
---
It's not realy the killer's fault themselves, it's just that much like Billy being able to cover that much ground that quickly is a compelte headache to deal with, particularly when stacked with location revealing perks like BBQ&amp;C. But then you get assclowns that head for the unhook IMMEDIATELY and tunnel the shit out of people and it's just not any fun at all.
---
Needs a rework badly, IMO.
---
It doesn't matter if you're good or bad with new or old Legion, survivors will DC all the same.
---
That sucks :/ how did it ended?
---
It's easy for survivors with brains.
---
"Why is MoM a big deal and noed isn't?"
---
Because one has literally no counterplay. You're way too garbo at the game to be weighing in on balance fam.
---
Yea.... How about no , slugging is currently the only way to counter the perk now. Everything needs some form of counter-play besides why should the killer get punished for trying to use your dumbass to create pressure? Ds is an anti TUNNEL perk. Not a oh well I'm going to abuse my invulnerability to taunt the killer perk.
---
# of games daily where top ranked streamers get shitty and DC.
---
I fucking hate when they do that. Like try to apply pressure to other survivors too, making it your mission to kill one specific survivor right at the start is no fun for them. When I play killer, I just want it to be fun for everyone
---
That‚Äôs some justice right there.
---
I was worried she was gonna wiggle free because that hook was pretty far!
---
Awesome job. Thanks for sharing!
---
where in my post did i ask
---
lots of old ~2 minute games for survivors with the Replacement Part (pre BNP) which 100% a gen.
---
lots of &gt;1 minute games where people see X killer and mass DC.
---
I want a Xenomorph
---
T-T-T-T-T-T-T-TARGETTTTTTTT
---
ask what? i said i do the same thing with Feng Min instead of Jeff.
---
Nah just say GG and move on fuck em
---
Use enduring, spirit fury, bbq, and sloppy butcher
---
Disrespecting people are just the worst no Matter if Killer or survivor (fck those camping Killers Who got u After 10 min of looping who Are hitting ur face 2 Minutes)
---
The oh so common PC elitist right here.
---
I have and will do this to anyone who acts like an asshole.
---
Lol what a weird comment dude.  Go insidious camp some more survivors legend.
---
I think their bloodlust or Ron‚Äôs anger make them accessible to the Entity? I‚Äôm not sure how it works either though so idk just a thought
---
As a Killer Main myself you sound traumatized.
---
I've never been Ds'd once by anyone besides morons or when everyone dc's and I let the remaining survivors escape.
---
Counting I am at Red Ranks Killer and myself believes that Decisive Strike is extremly weak since all you need to do is just slug your obssession and go after someone else.
---
And even if you get ds'd it's literally just 3 seconds and with Enduring 0.75 Seconds so saying ds is strong is quite the delusional thinking.
---
Yeah it is a Tunnel perk then why is the survivor Punished by trying to survive when he literally just got off the hook and now is being chased and God Bless if I am good at looping I am just gonna suffer that game.
---
You got what you wanted.
---
No good Survivor uses ds nowadays.
---
Only curious survivors are using it or just streamers in general because of the Dbd Streamer Treatment community.
---
Lisa (the Hag) like the Wraith will also have an African dish of some kind :)
---
No one takes overwatch's rating system seriously though. People just rate randomly.
---
damn i agree. and i don't get why tiny little Amanda from start can carry 4 of those reverse bear traps that are heavier due to additional mechanisms in them but Absolute Unit starts with just 1 regular bear trap ????
---
I wouldn't mind a Xenomorph, Predator and/or whatever you call the things from Hellraiser, I think all three of these could have interesting mechanics :)
---
i'm not gonna run a perk just to counter one add-on on one killer when the DC button is right there
---
~~im kidding lmao~~
---
Why do we face so many nurses and no plagues if thatd the case? 
---
The only think they should do to plague is make her addons not stack. Otherwise she's fine
---
Well you looped the killer for 5 gens plus. So yea it should be that easy since you‚Äôre a literal God.
---
Lol your lame. While I think mom needs to be nerfed, that is just lame af... comment history...look guys we got a James Gunn over here.
---
She only gets corrupt if survivors are stupid and cleanse thus feeding it to her.  If they repair gens her only ability is keeping you in No Mither state with a drop of tracking mixed in.  The only thing that makes her OP is teamates that don't know how to play against her.
---
Yeah but they already said that nurse one is bugged and her blinking m1 count towards mom. It has been fixed on the ptb
---
Yes, this is true. I could do ....a Ghana spicy beef liver and onion dish. There are many liver dishes in African cuisine. There is a fried liver dish as well. 
---
I could add the liver pie, as an alternative for something more dinner/Halloween dinner themed?
---
Ain't no "I" in team buddy ;)
---
I forgot about the aura part until I was complaining to a friend about being tunneled. I don‚Äôt use self care and just wait for adrenaline now.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about
---
It does a fair bit more than that. If you have DS, you have a good 30ish seconds where you can go play as aggro as you want after you get unhooked. I'll bodyblock with ds active all the time to let other people get away, because there's not a whole hell of a lot the killer can do about it.
---
Probably just stressed out while trying to learn them, not really a reason to get pissed at them for DC‚Äôing. They‚Äôd just rather move on to a different match you still get your 5K for leaving no harm done
---
"I" am still part of the team buddy ;)
---
Spine chill has usually always kept me alert whenever it lights up and imo is better than premonition
---
Upon release I would've agreed with you but now I admit that it was a knee-jerk reaction.
---
When played in a non-scummy way she's really not all that strong, it's just when you have an asshole killer that she becomes an issue but that's the same case with every killer really.
---
Call the Megxorcist.
---
Dang you rite, I'm a PI, clicking on someone's username and scrolling for a whole 2 seconds when they give dumb takes that makes me think they're a shitter.
---
so what your saying is change gen times so ruin isnt necessary making gen rushes even faster
---
agreed
---
I feel like it‚Äôs just a way to pressure survivors to get the fuck out ASAP instead of the usual 3 man rush to a hooked survivor. It applies pressure at the endgame and it can be counters by finding the lit totem (should only take around 2 mins) or doing all dull. There was an earlier post about changes to dull totems that would make it more dynamic but as it is it has more counterplay than MoM which should say something.
---
You said ‚Äúone shot‚Äù three times, and she doesn‚Äôt even have a one shot.
---
Boohoo
---
How would gens taking longer make rushing faster? Lol, you can still bring ruin but it wont be as necessary since people will be taking longer  by default
---
I feel like his stick has a very wide but short range, like hitting through windows is a no go
---
She's the tall one, almost his height.
---
Ahem.
---
Using her stomach bile on people doesn't count as an attack.
---
Only an affliction.
---
Combine that with a melee swing strong enough to give a rugby player a concussion or the Beta Boomer bile that injures you.
---
Yeah. She can basically fucking one shot.
---
Oh okay, so I have to chase a puke on one survivor for at least 20 seconds then I‚Äôm a one shot killer?
---
Good to know üëçüèª
---
It‚Äôs been done before during beta/dev build!
---
Noed isn't intended to actually work in the end game. It's meant to be a big bad threat that makes you use more time cleansing dull totems through the match regardless of whether it's there or not. So, from how you put it, sounds like it's working as intended.
---
I bought the game just over a year ago but didn‚Äôt really get into it until my friends got it via PS+ in August so I guess I‚Äôve been playing for 8 months now. 
---
I‚Äôm devotion 6 level 48.
---
Yes i have...its not hard just pay attention to where youre going and where they blink and have good map knowledge...
---
I love it. Reminds me of Left 4 Dead.
---
Op just needs to fucking learn how to counter her
---
Close the doors, break gens resupply pallets and clean up the mess the survivors left. Also vacuuming the basement probably.
---
Im just saying where are all these people coming from man?
---
I love that you never come back at me whenever I call you out for this being a character and bit you do for trolls.  I apologize that people around here are catching on and not feeding into you as much anymore.  Consider this a PSA.  It may be time to workshop another character.
---
You literally only mentioned mechanics that are in **HER** control. 
---
See, that‚Äôs the thing with Nurse. Everything is in her control since she ignores all game mechanics. A Nurse with good game sense won‚Äôt lose you. She‚Äôs not balanced - get over it.
---
Please be joking please be joking please be joking.
---
Paramedic is a cool idea, but I'd lower the time to 6/8/12 seconds. No scratch marks for 10/15/25 would be pretty broken, especially when paired with BL or Sprint Burst.  
---
I like Fragile, it looks like it's favouring a high risk/high reward playstyle. I could definitely see some of the better survivors taking this along with WGLF for the massive BP increase.  
---
Slow-breathing also looks pretty good, but you'd have to pair it with Iron Will for it to be useful unless the killer had a massive terror radius.
---
Insidious plays
---
Funny how you complain about a mid-tier killer, and then don't offer any solutions.
---
&gt;There's also the fact that for being ranged, she's really fast
---
Let's imagine Plague has Huntress speed.  After everyone is broken/injured, what do you do if no one cleanses themselves at fountains?  Chase them down at 110% speed?  Good fucking luck with that.
---
Ok how is the nurse not balanced
---
This is actually probably why though, he'd only killed one person and the gates were open. There's no reason for him not to at this point.
---
Whatever you do needs to have a liver dish! Maybe some desert based on herbs and grasses? Since she learned magic from the elders of her village?
---
Ok what about her is unbalanced?
---
&gt; Put bluntly if you run this perk along with No Mither, Resilience, Prove  Thyself, and something to keep yourself alive (maybe an Exhaustion perk  maybe Spine Chill IDK) and run a good toolbox you can gen rush to shit  with a permanent 10% faster action speed. 
---
lol you're running 5 perks?
---
I‚Äôll repeat - the fact that she ignores all survivor‚Äôs mechanics to break chase.
---
I use No Mither at low ranks to stomp bad killers with Resilience and a kitted out toolbox when I feel like playing very simple gen-rush games. Against a decent killer it's straight up awful, and when I'm in the mood it's much more fun to actually fuck with a bad killer instead of just pounding out 4 gens by yourself.
---
 !remindme 48 hours
---
Elaborate on that...what mechanics specifically?
---
Nothing noteworthy, this happens every 4 games or so ... "Reality can often be dissapointing"
---
Nope not a good idea.
---
Lery's was nerfed ages ago what are you talking about?  That map is shit for survivors now.  They butchered it when they opened up nearly every room while also closing off windows.  The entire strength of that map was always window loop potential but killers have open pathways in and out next to nearly every window left in the rooms.
---
I think that Ruin is a decent perk, but extremely overrated. The reason Ruin is used so much is because other options to directly affect generator progress usually either aren't effective or aren't reliable. The perk can be rendered gone in twenty seconds and leave you with three perks for the entire game, and survivors that can reliably land great skillchecks are barely affected by the penalty.
---
I personally greatly prefer Corrupt Intervention. Two full minutes that can't be stopped by a totem getting cleansed, in which you have three less generators to patrol. Killers like Myers, Plague, Trapper and Doctor that need to spend time getting the ball rolling benefit the most. I have had times where Ruin has lasted for minutes and slowed the game down drastically but it isn't worth how unreliable it usually is.
---
African donuts, soaked in herb syrup maybe.
---
do what i did fucking leave this community its filled with a shit ton of morons anyway
---
Also worth noting that killers like Legion, Hag and Freddy appear to have extremely long lunge ranges just because they're short.
---
*\- A stupid ass*
---
I love hooking teabaggers. It brings so much joy
---
Wow this makes everything much easier, I can finally get good perks I'll be sure to get BBQ and chili I've heard it's good on hillbilly, anyways thousand thanks man
---
I get what you mean. As for the balance thing, I feel like it would pretty much perfectly mirror BBQ and Chili. That perk gives you aura reading, and it's extremely strong. WGLF is supposed to be the survivor equivalent of BBQ if you think about it (like what Dark Sense is to Bitter Murmur), but with absolutely no other benefit besides points. And it's still much easier to get all of your stacks with BBQ because it's literally your main objective. Getting 4 saves in one match is extremely uncommon. Also, Breakdown has the exact same aura reading I mentioned, and that perk also breaks the hook, yet nobody says it's unbalanced or OP
---
So no, I personally don't think it would create another problem
---
I'll leave if they nerf billy or nurse. Or trapper.
---
Ok, one, it takes a lot of vomit to get people broken. For the most part it's pretty similar to the amount of time it takes M1 killers to get a first hit. Without effectiveness add ons, or without you being an absolute moron and standing in the full stream start to finish, it takes multiple vomits with multiple slows between. M1ing AFTER all that is not "one shotting," as a hit with exposed, chainsaws or one-shot add ons is.
---
Huntress is slower, she also doesn't take time to damage with her ability, nor does she require survivor decision to change her hatchets into a damaging ability. You're also comparing their speeds as though Plague moves at double speed or some shit, they're 5% of survivor speed different.
---
&gt;"One-shot several targets in a single charged vomit attack"
---
Dunno what you've been smoking but:
---
1: Charging makes the puke go for longer.
---
2: Breaking multiple survivors at once still requires hitting each one of them to down them.
---
3: Charging corrupt purge still won't allow you to down a healthy survivor in one puke.
---
But hey, let's take balance advice from someone who doesn't even know how the killer works.
---
Yeah...BBQ and Chili was in the shrine just over a week ago and has only been there twice in over 18 months....
---
A 60 second interval hardly constitutes "quick succession". Also, if the one with ds is the easiest to get, then the argument is kind of moot.
---
Op : waaaah! Nerf this new killer because i can't adapt against her playstyle! Waaaah!
---
You‚Äôre gonna get salt poisoning
---
Mate I can play just fine against her.
---
I just personally believe she needs a bit of a tweak.
---
Don't be such an insolent cunt.
---
If you have nothing nice to say then don't say it.
---
She can just look away from the gen before she yoinks you.
---
There, spine chill countered.
---
I agree: Elitism sucks. However I am a bit confused right now: Every day there are threads on this subreddit with people complaining that the toxicity in this game gets worse and worse. Usually you will see comments like this in these threads :"Im on console and trust me its even worse there". Additionally there are also alot of threads about how much more toxic the console versions are, these threads usually get tons of upvotes and alot of comments like: "I am playing on console and sadly this is true". So why does stating something, that is stated daily from alot of people who play the game on console, like this make him an pc elitist?
---
I‚Äôve played against several Shapes who put that offering in there and it‚Äôs just as annoying.
---
I can see why people would deem it 'useless'. Plague and legion can give you a condition that you don't need selfcare for to fix. Healing yourself already takes longer than it used to. Sloppy butcher (more bleeding so more healing) made that healing time even longer.
---
I do still use it, because I don't find my fellow team mates in the fog to help me out xD so for me it's still a handy perk
---
&gt; Even a 5 blink nurse isnt OP.
---
Thanks for proving my argument, bucko.
---
You still havent answered my question. But go ahead keep that same energy.
---
**GIVE ME SHIRTLESS DOCTOR, YOU COWARDS**
---
A few reasons that come to mind are: his ridiculous walk and sounds. Maybe just me, I don't take him serious. His chainsaw is needs practise but it overall fairly easy to use, not much aiming needed, much down, frustrating the survivors that they got caught easily. Another reason is that the chainsaw can down multiple people at a time, so the most ideal situation would be finding a team swarming a hook resulting in a possible whole team on the floor.
---
Genrush has literally never been a thing, it's just the objective of the game. That's like saying kill rush as the killer.
---
On my first mori ever, the survivor DCed.
---
OwO shiny twings
---
What about blood warden 30 to 40 to 60
---
I get put against everyone but Trapper when I use it. When I don't I get the usual Trapper who gets me into one of those end game plot twist traps. I rarely play Trapper but when that day comes, this will also trigger me lol
---
&gt; The Plague breaks pallets slightly slower than all the other killers.
---
Is this for real?  I had my suspicions, but I just assumed it was because of the animation.
---
If only he had deerstalker.
---
I‚Äôd increase fragile‚Äôs action bonus to something really good like 25 but anytime you complete a generator (this includes contributing more than 5-10% of a generator) your aura gets revealed
---
Ok, listen. This may be hard to understand, but, no-one gives a single fuck how many hours you‚Äôve played. And it certainly doesn‚Äôt add any credence to your statement. Also, Bubba‚Äôs a fat cunt, Myers is an absolute unit.
---
HOY CRAP there is a date?!!!!! Alriiiiiiiii :)
---
Chucky would be OP never see the little bastard coming xD
---
To keep playing, try new strategies etc
---
Suck it up, it‚Äôs not like every survivor is running it. üò¶
---
Basically called a 3-gen strat. You'll find three generators close to eachother, where you can easily patrol between them. They're priority: Do not let them finish. Always check them.
---
When it comes down to 1 gen left, there are 3 gens available: But those gens are the three gens you protected. It makes it so you focus the survivors down to one small area of the map, where finding them won't be impossible, and you can stall the game long enough to gain your points, at least. Or maybe even win.
---
I personally wouldn't want to deal with the backseat gamers judging whatever i decided to bring.
---
i'm a survivor main but i don't think tunneling is an issue. The killers objective is to kill. if you see two people and go after the one that has already been hooked instead of the one that takes two hits to go down and hasn't been hooked yet, you're getting one step closer to completing the objective. 
---
The killer going after the healthy survivor instead of the one that just got unhooked would be like a survivor getting a gen to 90% and thinking 'well my job here is done' and moving to a generator across the map.
---
If I was creating a game with charming, harsh and sweet characters and found out they are being re-imagined being fucked in the ass, then I would reckon I did my job well. I created memorable, attractive and lively personalities
---
Correction: Run calm spirit EVERY match because you might or might not get a doctor, essentially wasting a whole perk slot.
---
i ugly laughed
---
BREAKDOWN BREAKDOWN
---
They should honestly do Scream next
---
I just want to be able to see *my* stats in game
---
Nerf p3 baby killers mascot? Easy BP points when you camp (patrol hooks) solo players whole match.
---
i spend them on shrine, no point for me to save them.
---
And he couldn't see anything either. Any slight obstacle in the way? You can't see over it
---
It doesn't need a buff in the sense that it should be easier to get stacks. It needs a buff in the sense that it should do something while in-game.  
---
As of right now, running WGLF means you're playing with 3 perks. It has no advantage whatsoever while in a match.
---
!remindme 48 hours
---
Sorry bud, but you're almost 3 years late on the meme
---
how about instead of chucky as main, its ray (human form) then when he use his power he will turn into chucky\~ idea along that line\~
---
No we still had like 3 generators to fix
---
I'd like to add-on statistics for killers. Escape rates per add-on, I guess.
---
Chuckys boring but y‚Äôall want Ghostface...
---
What‚Äôs his power gonna be? Cry about being woozy?
---
imo Billy is balanced he gets stopped by pallet, good movement, gets punished if he misses chainsaw, is fun to play (subjective) 
---
He can be countered very easily by a lot of covers, being unpredictable, not giving him pallets as just bc he goes wroom wroom
---
if he is gonna get changed decreasing his movement speed isn't the best idea.
---
if u decreases his movement speed he will get cucked by loops while Huntress can throw hatchets over the loops (if it isn't a wall) Nurse can well just blink through it, Hag can place a trap either forcing the survivor to go away from the loop or risk it trying to fake the hag out. Billy well without turning addons a loop makes him a normal M1 killer
---
but this is just my opinion on the matter
---
id literally pay for you to overhaul all the perks/items
---
He couldn‚Äôt even reach the hook
---
&gt;fix tape
---
I SAW THIS BOAT IN HALF
---
Shirtless Dwight with a 12 pack
---
but it says get to the exit
---
I love the clown
---
She's powerful, indeed, but not needing a nerf.
---
She's an m1 killer at heart, so Mettle of Man works against her. 
---
You get a warning when she's corrupt, and here audio tracking is worse.
---
Corrupt Purge doesn't have the rang of Huntress' hatchets.
---
If you can repeatedly break line of sight, she's powerless.
---
She can't do anything against loops.
---
She has poor map pressure, so you can gen-rush her.
---
Nah dude fuck that, coldwind maps (or any map with tall grass tbh) would be even more of a nightmare than usual with that killer.
---
I'd like to see how often survivors dc when a killer brings a mori
---
Maybe at that time, but he did the same thing with his first victim as well
---
That was the surprise ending. I was expecting a DC the moment they were picked up.
---
It's such a bad idea that i want so badly to be added because it would be hilarious
---
It takes time to break a Survivor with Vile Purge.
---
She's hardly an insta-saw Hillbilly...
---
It's been there 4 a while now so hopefully be fixed in next patch. I just gen tap and health repair tap, not ideal but it works
---
I'm around 1,300, recently reached devotion 2 so I'm earning only a little at a time for now
---
Give all survivors cell phones... Ghostface calls them to find where they at XD
---
Yeah, the gates are already open. There's nothing for the killer to do but secure the kill. Camping at the start of the match on the other hand is something else.
---
Take a look at your gameplays. Compare Tru3 from a year ago to now. Very different person. Been watching you a very long time. Dbd has hardened you and it really shows.
---
you don't want chases to last for too long
---
you wanna kick gens I think pallets also count
---
you wanna find survivors quickly 
---
that is basically what the conditions are to get better emblems you can hover over them and read what they track
---
@NRocky please edit all the killer and survivor perks icon.. it would be the most beautiful icon pack ever released.
---
Lol it would be more like a drag I suppose
---
Billy is the most balanced killer in the game, he doesn't need nerfs.
---
Surely that only applies to Clown, Spirit, Legion and Plague‚Äôs themes?
---
How bout that mfing Jason Vorhees tho
---
It wouldn't be the art teams though, surely? It'd be the devs themselves incorporating the system and the community making the cosmetics, so the devs would be more occupied with that than the bug fixing
---
you know I will give you credit for the fact it wasn't another "REMOVE NOED POST"
---
isn't kate alreadt shirtless?
---
I don't recall exactly, but I think she may have been on her tip toes here? She's 5'7 I think, so not too much shorter than me
---
Any idea what causes it?
---
i need to see the endgame chat,please
---
escape % of solo survivors in rank 10-1
---
If you rearrange the letters though you can get me, ta.
---
&gt; They need to change gen times to be faster so it isnt necessary,
---
You said faster, not longer.
---
Her addons definitely need some nerfing especially the "Effectiveness" addons it's a bit ridiculous
---
Pretty sure they are aware of this.
---
Change whispers for iron grasp. Whispers rank 1 is pretty useless and it's not a great perk on wraith in general. Iron grasp will help you carry survivors for longer, possibly hit more survivors while carrying and you'll have less sway while carrying a survivor. Change unrelenting for bloodhound. Bloodhound makes it almost impossible to lose an injured survivor as their blood glows super vibrantly. Other than that your build is pretty good!
---
Yeah it should be 1/2/3 for the sake of balance
---
All hail Jeff Johansen, the og Jesus
---
But you Mori her XD
---
Honestly all of them are fine, but unrelenting is not a good perk at all, it‚Äôs a waste of a slot,
---
"that's harsh" lmao amazing
---
When your working all of those dates......
---
Dance bro
---
What about Leprechaun standing on Chucky's shoulders and with a Critter sitting on his head, in a trenchcoat? Vincent Onefullsizedkillerman
---
Was on console, no chat.
---
It has the downside of having a huge punishment for being used, permanent aura reading till your downed again, which is probably your last hook.
---
thanks, i hate it
---
No there is a use Nurse, NOED, mori behind doors = HAHAHAHAHA
---
Chucky could work, the problem is the little shit couldn't hook someone, it take work to make a replacement for when he's active so he could drag the little shits and keep them there.
---
 If it happened I want some kind of skill where you can set yourself on fire and gain hella speed while he screams like a damn monkey, it ain't worth it otherwise
---
Claudette vs. Predator: 2 hours of woodland scenery
---
He's super wholesome and positive, and his videos are very enjoyable and helpful to new players
---
He also regularly gets murder boners. That's also pretty notable
---
Was on console, so no endgame chat, though I did message her "lol" after. I couldn't help myself.
---
(when running sloppy butcher) THAT'S A LOTTA DAMAGE!
---
Yeah those were good times. But it‚Äôs not as enjoyable for me anymore.
---
I don‚Äôt use it on everyone, but it‚Äôs a must on trapper for me, it gives me time to plant my traps before gens start popping.
---
That's true. It's kinda hard to get use to. I have never played an online game like this before. I usually play games like fallout and borderlands. It was a hard adjustment.
---
I hate even the idea of Fragile. We already have enough morons who run No Mither without a plan, we don't need another perk that encourages survivors to be useless to the team just so that they can farm bloodpoints instead of trying to win. If killers could tell, they'd tunnel them, and if I as a survivor could tell, I'd leave the useless idiot to die rather than waste time rescuing them.
---
I commend your bravery, openly admitting that you love noed
---
I have a lot of favorite killer perks but I really like monitor and abuse, stbfl and blood warden
---
Ghostface is even more boring than Chucky :[
---
I do it on occasion, especially when they tbag post-pallet stun and I have enduring.
---
Also a Myers main. I use BBQ and Ruin as a base then either M&amp;A / Nurses for a stealth build or Enduring/Spirit Fury for a more aggressive build.
---
For add-ons my preference is something from the memorial set to increase stalking speed pared with something from the hair set to extend EW3.
---
Those basic setups should serve you well but the big advantage of Michael is his flexibility.
---
I would play with a few builds and see what you settle on.
---
I am a killer main and let me say: DO NOT help a camped survivor, do gens and do not kill yourself. If you break any of these then you did what the killer wanted and contributed to letting this degeneracy work. The entity should come and smack the killer across the map for not doing his job thou.
---
If the killer is still in the game once you‚Äôre unhooked then you‚Äôre being tunneled
---
Normally no, the pallet add-on seems to be much more popular. Though, I also haven't gone against many Doctors - I seem to mostly hit Huntress and Myers.
---
This is all I want.
---
He‚Äôs probably my favourite to be honest, he‚Äôs good at the game and just has fun, he doesn‚Äôt critique the game constantly like others, Noob3 just moans about hitboxes constantly, Tru just moans about balance constantly, gets to the point where it‚Äôs like why am I watching this ? Just people moaning I wanna enjoy what I‚Äôm watching.
---
I don't understand why entitled and cockies survivors act like that. Flashlight spamming and teabagging, and escaping as if their lives depended on it.
---
Take a seat, young legion.
---
You realize that having a dead perk for the whole game that might not even turn on is earning it? 
---
Your trading early game strength like nurses or enduring for something that may not activate
---
I'm dead.
---
Actually would be cool to have a killer who dragged people, maybe make the dragging a part of his kit
---
Zinfandel and a bubble bath.
---
This is fully true. Toxicity went down because people want the endorsement lootbox and because they started to chat ban. 
---
It would work better in DbD if they changed some of the things that make people leave the most like insidious and tombstone with some killer stuff than to try and punish DCs. We are also talking about how people will still kill themselves instead which is just as frustrating if you punish DCs so there is hardly a point.
---
We love you too, man.
---
No you can leave them, just make sure to keep people off of those.
---
And/or when someone purposefully does a bad unhook which is far too often.
---
&gt;but when he actually get into a chase, his mobility means absolutely nothing.
---
Woah hold on, Billy mains will surely disagree with that. They make great use of the initial turning and they can also cut survivors off when they're running towards the next loops.
---
Won't happen anytime soon. Friday 13th game and lawsuit
---
Just imagine a little child coming up behind you on a generator and stabbing you in the back
---
It's a bug and it's relatively common. It's happened to me like three or four times alone lol and others as well
---
I realise now that my comment may have been poorly written compared to the message I was trying to convey.  
---
I 100% respect rule34 niggas. Totally cool, you do you and sex and sexuality is a complicated thing. No one is wrong to like this or that. I was trying to see Boygamerdude's perspective and finding arguments for both sides of the discussion.  
---
Hopefully this clears it up a bit :))
---
When you shock a rock just to make sure without espectations and a p3 claud screams.
---
I mean you could dodge the puke
---
Noed or Ruin, either way no one is happy. 
---
Also your sex analogy is great because if survivors practiced safe sex and get all the grays there would be no Noed baby.
---
There's nothing boring about Chucky. You can argue tbat he wouldn't fit well with the theme of the game or that his size would be weird because he's really small. But you can't tell me with a straight face that Chucky is a boring character/killer.
---
You wanna know who's boring/uninspired AF? Legion.
---
Everything they can give us and implement it in game, just like FPS games have KD ratios/win &amp; lose stats/weapon use, i'd love to see DBD have player statistics: Games played as X survivor/killer, games with 0-4k, escapes, gens done, pallets dropped/broken, everything really.  I'm a sucker for statistics :P
---
tfw you‚Äôre working on a gen w spine chill so you try to get in a locker only to find the killer inside it already
---
I have almost 2000
---
I would suggest that you watch Fungoose--he is a killer main who has over 6000 hours in the game. He can 4K a vast majority of his games **without** using addons or offerings.
---
But here is what he would say to you:
---
Ruin relies on luck. Sometimes it really pays off, because it's in a great spot. Sometimes it's broken pretty much as soon as you spawn. On the other hand, perks like Thanatophobia relies on skill. So the question is: would you rather rely on luck or skill? If you're new to the game or if your opponents are new to the game, Ruin will do great. If you're good at the game, then you'd rather bet money on your own skills rather than random chance. So my advice would be to practice not using Ruin so that you become a better player--even if that means you'll struggle at first.
---
There are certain exceptions like you mentioned though. Certain killers like Michael or Trapper need ruin because they need time to "prep." Michael needs to get out of tier 1 and trapper needs to go around setting traps. But I would highly, highly recommend checking out fungoose. Good luck!
---
Therapist: Maskless Myers isn't real, he can't hurt you.
---
Maskless Myers:
---
Here comes the trapper, you better watch out for his traps!  
---
Here comes the trapper, you gonna eat some ginger snaps!
---
the trapeeeeer! \~Jazz hands\~
---
&gt;that would be like saying that Huntress has a oneshot by default because you brought a survivor in the injured state by hitting them with her M1 and after that throwing a hatchet.
---
You mean the other way around I'm sure, just wanted to point that out. Your point is valid though.
---
Do you mean edit in the same style?
---
Instead of ahook, slap on a fuckin altar or something. Just as tall as a hook, except without the actual hook part. Chucky lays the survivor down on a spike, and that's it. Entity shows up and materializes as usual, and survivors can "pull" the hooked one to their feet for a rescue.
---
Different animations, same everything.
---
iS tHaT a JoJo ReFeReNcE
---
I want a predator survivor against him üòÇüòÇ
---
Looks like Carl from the walking dead.
---
Choosing not to break totems is that though. Devour Hope is far stronger though as that activates before everyone can leave so if we really want to bitch about exposed-like perks that is one for the books. 
---
You also avoid the strongest hex in the game, Ruin when listing off perks with huge impacts killers have to earn which is kinda funny as that one basically dictates how fast the entire round can be and you have to do nothing to activate it.
---
It takes like 20 seconds to break one and gives you extra BP you likely won't get if you rush gens. The points it gives is also enough that the lost gen progress makes 0 difference to you. 
---
It also prevents things like Devour Hope which I would argue is generally stronger.
---

---
I got called a camper after chasing a survivor around a hooked survivor, survivors are babies
---
Fuck these are so good.
---
What icon pack is that?
---
yes there is curving but it's very difficult to do (like harder than nurse level) and can still be countered by good positioning. In other words there is no point in balancing around that if the average player will never do it
---
Yeah happened to me a couple times before. It freaking sucks bc it's hard to move....

If I‚Äôm playing killer and 2 or 3 people dc then I just find one of them and smack the gen. Most of the time they‚Äôll understand you want them to do gens and they‚Äôll let you chase them and hit them to get bloodpoints.
---
I'm uncomfortable.
---
He would just yeet them onto the hook
---
Jesuschrist. I know a girl too that asks her bf to wear as the doctor when they have sex :'V
---
Takes 1 person 80 seconds for 1 gen, 2 people is 44 seconds. You were at the first phase which takes 60 seconds, so unless they both brought high tier tool boxes and had 3 gens right next to each other that wouldn't have happened, even then it'd be a pretty big stretch and I'd have to actually try it. Gates were open, no reason to not camp.
---
Showing the offerings is enough the other things will give advantage

I second this. I camp when I see someone I remember who gets salty (they send me toxic messages) and all the other survivors still rush for the save at purple ranks. They're dead. Unles you have borrowed and the gates are open. It's GG.

But he also camped at his frost victim, right at the start

Chucky's Mori: Transference.

Doubt it. He wouldn't be able to catch someone. They'd drop a pallet on him and he'd be stuck
---
There's no way you can be that coordinate in a team full of solo survivors. You need to trust that someone is going to do this while you do that, etc. People don't just do gens. Some do chests, others do totems, or try to rescue. Some do nothing at all.

Somewhere out there is a naked hillbilly model and I WANT IT

Idk if I'd call this a "counter". It's just what you're supposed to do when the killer is camping. Since you obviously can't save the person being camped.

you need at avarage more than 4 hits to sacrifice a survivor are you this delusional
---
Wow, that's a nice idia.
---
This is beautiful. I'm crying.
---
It does save time in High ranks, Say they look for it the whole game, saves time, say they just push through but suck at skill checks, saves time, say they hit every ruin skill check, it would be the full 80 seconds it takes to do a gen, which would be slower than if they hit great skill checks when there is no ruin.  
---
to say it doesn't save time is a little ignorant.  
---
and I wouldn't run it on Nurse or Billy, They can apply enough pressure as is.
---
You want the old system? What is wrong with you?
---
Maybe he's just practicing Nurse? Did that thought ever cross your thoughts?
---
its still pretty shit but what do I know this sub is full of traumatized people
---
I read your *fuck off* like Gordan Ramsey and that made me really happy.
---
Whats a good chance ? 5%? Decent at hiding or eficient on gens? You gotta pick one, you wont be able to sneak your way into making all the gens stealthy. Not to mention the "auto aim" broken lounge attack on her... 50 % of nurses hits dont connect on your model and still register as a hit. I get slapped with the nurse model looking backwards to me, its insane. Removing the lounge attack would be and obv and logical balanced change imo.. kinda like tier 1 myers, no slapping people from 10 feet away to compensate the fact the breaks all the fundamentals of dbd chasing mechanics
---
Just make Charles Ree Lay a killer in human form then you can make his power something to do with Chucky, that's the only possible way I see of doing it.
---
You don‚Äôt need to work in game development to figure this out lol.

Pinhead was a human before he opened the box.
---
1. Remember Me has been pre-nerfed in case it was strong.
---
2. End game collapse starts once the gates are open, not powered. The only time anyone is affected by RM when the EGC timer has started is a solo survivor with the hatch being shut by the killer.
---
I've run it on Huntress where it is really useful because at higher ranks you can basically throw hatchets with good guesses and down people who you shouldn't physically see yet.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
And Carl is the Clown
---
lol watched some whiny shit like this from the Killer side last night on a stream.
---
He though it was bs that survivors can loop him around things. Basically he face camped and tunneled his way through every game to avoid actually having to chase people much, and then complained that survivors would bm him.
---
Best quote, and bear in mind this is in the middle of a face camp...Ash on a hook, first down, 2nd generator just popped, plenty of time left in the game and Ash about to drop into 2nd stage on his hook...this dude ACTUALLY said:
---
"I feel like I have a gun to my head because of Mettle of Man"
---
OP, Im proud of you
---
Flashlight saving is already canon in FNAF2. What if they had something similar to Evil Within but related to a music box? (Survivors have to keep a music box wound to prevent a buff for the killer?). There's some weird gimmicks that \*could\* work
---
Oh good god, I hate it. I LOVE the OG menu music, and that plague one sounds like aids
---
One day I was playing Nurse on Lery's and I faked giving up on a survivor near the exit only to come back with a super cool blink through the walls (from my noob nurse perspective) and hit her while she was healing too far from the exit. 
---
She then proceeded to send me a message saying that she let me kill her because she felt bad I only got one kill.
---
oh god corn
---
Hmm not bad. I would suggest maybe turning up the chase music some in frenzy. Not a lot but more than now.
---
This is every Michael Myers fangirl ever
---
You'd also get punished by your teammates' mistakes. 
---
Say you have rescued someone safely, even took a hit for them to ensure their escape. Then someone farms a teammate twice and all of your effort goes to waste.
---
Or, he hooked with bbq and got no auras. So no one is on gens and they are going for the save. SWF groups do this all the time. Got bitched at because I camped after they were hooked, but I downed his buddy 10 seconds later right in front of him.
---
weird because it was true? go sit on a hook some more and contemplate why you suck so bad at such an easy game.
---
Yah the altar can the like the end game collapse tendrils.. survivors can pull each other off before they get impaled.
---
Because it's not. It's survivors doing their objective.
---
My personal opinion, I don't think we need to see the perks that people are running. I like the randomness of a situation and you never know if another survivor's loadout might come in handy when a situation occurs. I always assume that when I'm in a solo queue, everyone else is bringing meta perks. Seeing the offerings and items would be a decent QoL change. I just don't think we need to see the perks people are running, what really matters is what killer you're up against.
---
In game statistics. Things like deaths, kills, escapes and anything around that nature that would be interesting to see implemented into the game.
---
IMO Unrelenting is pretty good for new killers on console, which it looks like OP is. While you‚Äôre learning your lunge ranges, changing your sensitivity and learning how to deal with 360s, it can honestly help a lot since it‚Äôs easy to miss attacks. Once someone is practised they won‚Äôt need it though.
---
I've actually never heard of Evil Within but as long as I'm reading this right, that sounds sweet.
---
Why would an apparent God like pin head be stuck in the entity's game?
---
Putting chucky in dbd makes as much sense as putting jaws in
---
Hag also got a buff, she was doing worse than Freddy at rank 1, before. I don't think it was just that players finally figured out how she works after 2 years.
---
beautiful
---
I've seen people get downed and morid after the unhook and it still would give you a safe unhook. The mechanic is pretty iffy.
---
Don't go into tier 3 right away - stalk then just enough so you're one tap away from t3, wait until you are close to a person you're chasing, then tap it and bam - an instadown. Get out of t1 as fast as possible at the start of the game, try to sneak up on survivors without them noticing and stalk them. Use monitor and abuse to have zero terror radius at t1 and much smaller terror radius at t2 (combined with dead rabbit it's pretty awesome). If you have any questions feel free to ask.
---
I wish they could add some of these as custom options in the game, steam workshop or something like that. Shouldnt be too hard to add since people add them in anyways
---
Chucky is boring as fuck.
---
no Carl, i am disappoint
---
Rancor is an amazing last ditch effort perk to snag one last survivor, or kill that D'S, MoM, Deadhard survivor. I use it most killers, and with an endgame build it can substitute bbq and chili
---
I just want to see my personal stats.
---
Same, but probably more as Killer. It's damn hard to actually get a decent hex.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm a killer main and it only ever gives me survivor challenges
---
from what i have heard it doesnt
---
When you level a character to level 50, you can prestige (wich will reset your blood web and give you a bloody outfit) so a p3 claud is a main claud, wich in most case means a brainless person
---
Fnaf is a super boring game imo
---
He could never work anyway.
---
Meg as Legion.
---
This game is aimed at casual gamers, hence the awful balance, the switch is a casual gamers console.
---
Amanda on Lery's with Amanda's Letter is by far my favorite thing to play in this entire game.
---
That's why you bait the 360 with a short lunge.

The new meta will be swapping last second to a no mither'd survivor to avoid disconnects
---
fuck the reporst
---
Cenobites
---
"Sir, would you like vanilla or choc-"
---
I MUST CONSULT WITH THE ELDER GODS
---
No, unlike most other games console is less toxic (looking at you R6S), but console is a lot harder to play, and a lot laggier usually, leaving people to get mad easier, and you can‚Äôt really just private your profile (I don‚Äôt think) so it appears more toxic, that combined with a lack of endgame chat makes the direct messages appear more toxic or salty than they are
---
My flair seems appropriate here
---
That's right Meg our pig Amanda is nerfed
---
I‚Äôm about to Prestige a character so I‚Äôm sitting at 600k rn. Gotta use all my offerings haha. But normally I spend them all at once.
---
that's funny
---
God, no, I play both killer and survivor and this would be a nightmare. People fighting over who gets what perks, people syncing an entire four-man perk loadout to make it impossible to beat them. While it can be convenient to know what perks someone else is running when it comes to ones that affect other players (borrowed time, etc) this would a shit show.
---
People still getting 360‚Äôd in 2019 lol.
---
That, but al the lyrics are ‚Äúthis is bullshit‚Äù as he a does a lap around the entire map and downs you in one sprint
---
The 360 at the end?
---
It costs around 1 million Bloodpoints to reach lvl 39, sometimes 40. So i don't know around 850k-900k Bloodpoints.
---
IG + AG dont @ me
---
One million, buy getting brown addons should get you to level 37-38 ish.
---
What is gen tapping?
---
This was a rank 6 killer in a swf group in only rank  13
---
Thank you, I love this sub
---
I would appreciate him more if his laugh wasn‚Äôt map wide, so I could actually pinpoint what box people are on.
---
I‚Äôm*
---
Swf is all u needed to say
---
You gotta make an escape cake and survivor pudding!!! Survivor pudding could be one of those old-school Halloween treats with the fake fingers and eyes and everything. Takes me back to Halloween parties as a kid. The escape cake just has to taste like victory.
---
I mean, they would be relatively the same size.  Knife as a weapon.  They would need to implement killer stealth and evasion as Ghost Face would ALWAYS disappear.  Maybe, just maybe the killer could hide in lockers or behind gens and pop out.
---
took me 677k to get 33.
---
Legion&lt;Chucky
---
What a waste! Bloodpoints are so much easier to obtain than shards... I'm sitting on like 800,000 bps. All characters are level 50 some prestiged, some p3...  you just gotta save them up spend wisely. 
---
So double blood points starts may 2nd. Grind really hard for a few days and level everyone to 50.  Then boom start focusing on characters you like the best or who have the cosmetics you like the most and get them to p3 and get all the perks on them. That what I'm doing.
---
Yeah I dont get it. Like I was called a tunneler when I hooked two people before even getting back around to the "tunneled person" Im under the impression that a tunneler would camp the hooked come back for the unhooked and ignore everyone else. Not even hitting them(and I dont mean endgame exit gate open. 
---
I saw someone getting tunneled where I was able to body block several times early game first hooked and killer refusing to even hit me or switch targets.
---
People just through around tunnel
---
Chucky on his brides shoulders
---
We already have enough perks with the purpose of hiding scratch marks ( Lightweight, Dance With Me, Distortion, Poised ), we don't need more.
---
Broken?
---
you could try and get play with your food
---
First one seems reasonable, as many say tho needs tweaking regarding the duration. It should be a bit shorter. But I'd definetely run this perk.
---
The second one, well, for the bloodpoints, maybe. 5% action speed is a joke. And I'm sure you'll be hated a lot if you're using it, just as No Mither.
---
The third one is not that good in my eyes. I'd rather go for SC or other means of healing instead of using this perk. There's a reason why Solidary isn't as good as many people thought at first look.
---
If everyone of already level 50 I would understand, mine aren‚Äôt.
---
People still using this tired-ass meme at any time lul
---
How about using bond to find a teammate to wake you up, or vice versa.
---
Your like the third noob I‚Äôve seen today. I‚Äôll nickname you, noob3
---
Jason is a better option tbh
---
I'd drop noed and unrelenting... replace with spies and bloodhound.  Both very good with helping finding people.  You wanna learn how to get legit kills without noed.
---
Aw so wholesome. Once had a streamer invite me to a swf with her after she versed me as killer and the team she brought in was so toxic that I legit couldnt get any of them. They didnt do gens just 3 of them bullied. She said she didnt know them and wouldnt have played with them if she knew they were that scummy. 
---
For all the toxic people the sweet ones get overlooked :(
---
wasnt the last one in december.
---
No problem! Fun fact, cenobite is actually a general term for arginine living in a monastic community. Hellraiser cenobites are like kinky hell monks, basically.
---
More licensed IP. Bring Chucky.
---
He doesnt have all that so give him a build with the perks he has.. 
---
I agree with noed tho. People should rely on it to get kills.
---
Evil within is Micheal's power.
---
‡≤†_‡≤†
---
That's if he's standing right at the center of map. But yeah, something around that
---
Insta join
---
Planes fly over my house sometimes. I guess I have "plane sight".
---
I'd love some new cheese music for each of the different killers! I even slapped together a [video](https://youtu.be/WL-M3DidVKs)  to see what it might be like - I think it would really add a ton of excitement to the chase.
---
That guy is an extremely biased crybaby. Ignore them
---
It depends, it you are good with your blinks and survivors are predictable, narrow corridors are playing in your favor and you can really win because of playing Lery. But otherwise it's really hard as Nurse, yea
---
Fan made perks as in new ideas or Perk icon art?
---
thank you!
---
There are counters to mettle and it has a drawback. Any 1 shot down against a healthy survivor negates MoM, and if they escape after you hit them and they heal you can see where they are until you down them again.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Lol, I‚Äôm generally a rank 10 survivor
---
In most of my builds it doesn't matter to me which killer I play as, but I always have nurses calling.
---
Your not really selling me with the comment friend.
---
both!
---
You can either share custom perks as like changing the aspect of plague perks
---
or you can create your own perks and share with the community
---
Devs confirmed it back when the spirit came out, cause her base model basically is her "naked" model:
---
[https://youtu.be/b8NYSnA2B7k?t=874](https://youtu.be/b8NYSnA2B7k?t=874)
---
Plot twist:  You are not even using ruin.
---
Does this include custom chapters?
---
This would be really useful.
---
First of all, no it isn't out. Second of all, it's obviously not quite finished yet.  
---
And lastly, what on earth do you even mean by that? Please elaborate.
---
Can‚Äôt have Pinhead without Dirty Dan
---
I can get behind this motion
---
It is clear, and still counterable. I feel like everyone on this sub doesn‚Äôt understand that you can counter something no matter what. Have you seen people like puppers, monto, No0b3, and truetalent? I‚Äôve watched them all dodge really good nurses.
---
Shame all that gets cucked the second a survivor gets hooked next to a powered exit gate.
---
My point is during this double bloodpoint event coming up from may 2nd to may 6th , you should use these points to level everyone up to level 40.  Make sure you're bringing escape cakes and streamers or survivor pudding. Use every offering that will get you more points...  I did this last double blood point week during that week in December I used all my points and leveled evey killer to 40.  Now I have all perks unlocked..
---
well I guess soo, I'll just have to change some settings, but I believe yes you can share your chapter ideas
---
Plague is pretty fun, legion is getting nerfed to the ground in a little. Ash has an OP perk, decisive strike is no longer meta
---
Maybe something like The Thing that can imitate other survivors or something which could be cool, only problem that would need to be tackled is swf if this were a thing
---
Common courtesy? Are you kidding me? 
---
When you're playing a first person shooter, do you give the enemy common courtesy and not shoot the guy you shot the round before in the head, and instead try and take the harder shot on the enemy behind him? No. You do your job and win the game. 
---
The idea that the killer should somehow play nice so the survivors have a better play experience is unbelievably stupid. It makes for poor survivors, because they aren't forced to learn to play better. They expect to be given leeway to not improve their gameplay, rather than learn from their mistakes.
---
Of course ash would have an OP perk.
---
Cindy is Kate, Bolby is Huntress, Carl is Clown and that one chicken from the movie is Nea
---
Don't fuck with the Chuck
---
Claudette got me lmfao
---
Trial by fire has way too many good things going on for it.
---
Rip to that guys Legacy
---
the for sure changed bps compared to last year
---
so it's killed mindgaming themself. Surv doesn't mindgame, surv reacts
---
Try it for yourself, it's awful, PTB. Lagswitching is even more abusable than before, the difference is, now you can't see if the killer has a crappy connection, because you only see the dedicated server AND its much harder to tell whether someone is lagswitching. Also pretty much everything glitches out because of this "solution" that everybody asked for but nobody wanted...
---
Most I ever had at one time was around 10,000.
---
What are you talking about? If survivors stop genrushing because of something you did, your chances of winning go up. The entire meta is based around applying pressure to prevent genrush. It's not a "counter" to not do it and give the killer more time to murder everyone.
---
Finally someone got it
---
Well then; this might just overcome r/mydbdperks.
---
Ruin and either Sloppy Butcher or a gen intel perk like surveillance.
---
Your logic is terrible but ok..  spending real money when you dont have to. Shards are a lot harder to get than bloodpoints. 2000 shards is worth more to me than 150k blood points. That's like a few matches with bbq.
---
Harambe lives forever never to late
---
Adrenaline is the same way along with dead hard.
---
Height: OP short version of Claudette that can kill everyone
---
How ?? If you csnt hit skill checks it's your best bet or waste time looking for the totem the choice is yours.
---
Wraith main here.  Nurse's Calling, Hex: Ruin, Sloppy Butcher and Bloodhound.  Almost every game is 3-4K.
---
What about me running Jeff perks on P3 Tapp (+ We‚Äôll Make it)? Always playing as altruistic as possible. Died to a camping legion last night for a teammate to escape. Ends up she was a rank 18 with some weird matchmaking (6 here). Happy she escaped and had fun!
---
Pallets on Chucky would still stun but instead of breaking them he can leap over like Legion. This trades off his poor vision due to height, also they can use voodoo to get survivors onto hooks or if their doing remake Chucky then the hooks are wifi activated and just lower down to his height when he gets closer
---
it all depends of how well the community adapts to this new subreddit, and how many people start sharing their ideas there
---
you're on pc and you took a picture with your phone?
---
with 20000 shards (almost the price of a purple outfit) you could get 1.5 million bloodpoints. i would rather the bp personally.
---
It doesn‚Äôt make u more sensitive to flash light. It use to but they fixed that
---
Shit sometimes I make them hit me so I can use my ds. If I'm getting tunneled i wanna at least make them chase me for a bit then down me so I can use my ds and waste a bit more time so my team can get gens done.
---
Nobody plays her on ps4 üò¢
---
Stop being lazy and just read the sub?   
---
Literally everything you missed is here and the only current issues are the ones which are being debated right now; they are mostly about Pig, Legion and the EGC.
---
It buys you *just a little bit* of time at the beginning of the game to get your map pressure going. That usually makes it worth running. Otherwise gens are getting slammed by co-op'ing and great checks immediately. 
---
What elevates it further is that sometimes you high roll and it stays up for several minutes and wins you the game by itself.
---
Damn man, I‚Äôm just trying to get the short version
---
With the perks u have I would use noed,bloodhound,shadowborn, and deer stalker or bitter murmur
---
Are cross posts allowed? I did a series of [killer concepts ](https://www.imgur.com/a/fCQMFrb)a while ago that sound perfect for this!
---
Lmaooooo,1 million blood points comes faster than 20,000 shards.. geez yall are dense af.
---
DCing just because you're losing is never acceptable, and anyone that defends the practice is trash.
---
My hotkeys were all assigned somewhere else and the game has been disconnecting on me recently when I tab out so I did it the safest way I knew lol
---
Every time I see this glitch it reminds me of Mr.Crocker from fairly oddparents
---
I think it should actually be a functional perk as well as a points buff like its counterpart, BBQ &amp; Chili is. Here's a cool idea:
---
*We're Gonna Live Forever*
---
Your few friends deserve the best protection. When performing a Safe Unhook or taking a hit for an injured survivor, gain a 25% stackable bloodpoint bonus up to 100%. **When unhooking a Survivor outside of the Killer's terror radius, you and the unhooked survivor clear 1/2/3 negative Status Effects. This perk cannot clear Exposed status.**
---
Perks I usually run on wraith cause I have them is ruin,enduring,spirit fury and bbq and sometimes bamboozle instead of bbq or fire up cause I like to use random perks for my 4th
---
legion is fixed in the ptb.
---
I &lt;3 trapper ez hooks the only problem is im forced to run a trapper bag to reset traps. add a feature to reset traps in the current position there in, nice quality of life buff.
---
clown is fine where he is. 115% movement speed and an ability/power to slow survivors is fantastic.
---
When they said "logical" that's the change I expected. Oh well.
---
if you can't reupload the same files then yes!
---
OHHHHHH ok lmao, I thought you were talking about a game or something lmao. I forgot that's what it was called hahaha
---
9, Class Photo adds 2 seconds
---
Mhm that‚Äôs very inaccurate ngl
---
If you miss two out of the average four skill checks, that's still an extra four seconds per generator.
---
I think the first 3 are pretty good, but it started going downhill from there. That doesn't mean we can't appreciate it though, like I said Freddy Fazzbear is a horror icon and would be a really cool killer
---
Happened to me on PS4 tonight. Went down to a rank 17 bing bong because I couldn‚Äôt run properly. Ez rage quit.
---
There are plenty of killers that really make MoM an everage perk too. Like billy, nurse, huntress, plague etc. Legion is the worst if you get MoM against him you truly deserved it. For me I have a lot of games where mom helps me out but i probably have just as many where it cant even activate bc of the killer I'm against and it is pretty much a dead perk. Another thing is if i am fully healed by endgame and have mom ready they can just 1 shot me and I never get to use it so it seems to me its kinda in a good place honestly
---
Both McLean and MCote said they'd put pinhead in the game over any other killer if they had the chance.
---
Shirtless Huntress
---
It was on the shrine last week, it's entirely possible this guy has it.
---
I hope they add the shark from Jaws
---
He is perfect
---
I have seen a LOT of billys since mom came out. Probably 6 out of 10 games I play is billy honestly
---
Allow to me repeat myself. It's obviously not quite finished yet.  
---
The current problem with the dedicated servers is not lag-switching, because it's more or less impossible to actually gain an advantage with lag-switching in a dedicated server. It only works in your favour in a peer-to-peer environment, assuming you are hosting said environment.  
---
The current problem is the state of the dedicated servers, which is why they're on the PTB. They are to be tested, so that the developers can get proper and relevant data, and solve any issues that occur.  
---
As a PTB players, you are beta-testing incomplete features. You are pretty much supposed to find issues for the developers to fix. Don't forget that.  
---
I can almost guarantee that when the dedicated servers come to the base game, they will be in a much better and stable state than they currently are.
---
‚Äútrash series‚Äù
---
To quote u/SkeletalElite
---
&gt;I think the far more concerning thing with this idea isn't that it wont be countered by not doing gens (...) its that its countered by leaving the gens at 99% until the person with the trap on their head takes it off.
---
And again: people can still do totems or loop the Killer which is still valuable for the Survivors.
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm at work everyday during the event, hopefully I can get in 2 hours a day before it ends.
---
Not to mention some games you cant even use it depending on the killer and its used once either way and then it is a dead perk. Its literally a one and done perk so it should have some power to it considering its not like a lot of other perks that can be used the whole trial.
---
Visual representation of the people that call Myers daddy
---
Bolbi is already in the pic ;)
---
Honestly, the Nea idea is amazing
---
Yes ?
---
Two types of claudettes, no inbetween. One is not a toxic teabagger and hides all game to just get hatch
---
Hmmm, I don't know how I feel about bolby. I feel like that man would be surrounded by pure evil. How about the entity?
---
900k-1M
---
i never denied that but ok
---
i just prefer to spend shards on bp since i can spend money on cosmetics but not bp, that way i get both lmao
---
You can‚Äôt compare a fps and dbd it just doesn‚Äôt go together. When I play killer I try to be courteous and not tunnel or camp because I‚Äôm not a dickhead. I know that if I was playing survivor and this shit happened to me I would be pissed that either my teammate unhooked me in the killers tr so now I‚Äôm going to be hooked again or that the killer looked at us both and decided to suck my dick. If you play with the mindset of fuck survivors, they don‚Äôt deserve any mercy, do whatever I got to do to win you take the too seriously and lose skill just because the option of going to the freshly unhooked survivor is easier it isn‚Äôt the best choice. 
---
All I‚Äôm saying is being courteous to the other side isn‚Äôt so fucking bad you guys think being courteous is just letting the other side win no it‚Äôs just taking into consideration how it would feel to be on the other side of your actions.
---
Honestly I try to get the wrong box so I can hear the classic giggle.
---
If she was squatting and hiding the whole game and not contributing, I doubt all 4 survivors would be alive for the exit phase. OP just saw a squatting Claud and said to himself ‚Äúthis will be funny on Reddit, lawl.‚Äù
---
Are you really telling a programmer that has worked with such systems that lagswitching is not possible on a dedicated server? Ok then.  
---
How about we wait for release, it'll be the same shit, BHVR will have wasted a year on development of this feature that will hopefully be rolled back AND they will have spent tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars on devtime + support + (this is a huge one) server cost.  
---
The PTB stuff you're talking about is BS, if it's "Beta" then it's in a state which is very similar to release. The way it is now it has HUGE issues that everybody can see, you don't need a big playerbase to test those obvious issues. The only reason you would push out the PTB like that is if you intend to release it in this state.
---
On Pig I run Monitor and Abuse and Whispers, so that I always know when to crouch and when to run at normal speed. The moment Whispers turns on (the icon, not the sound), I crouch and go to the nearest gen. It usually lets me get my first chase started quickly and helps when I've got one survivor at the end of the trial that I'm having difficulty finding.
---
Then it's usually BBQ and a perk that helps with chases; e.g. Enduring or Spirit Fury. Eat the pallets as soon as possible and you should be golden.
---
 RemindMe! 1 year "Dedicated Servers are still shit, or aren't in the game, told u :)"
---
Leatherface - Barbeque and Chili obviously.  Pork because human meat supposedly tastes like pork.
---
Trapper - Road Kill Pot Pie.  Just a chicken pot pie but with random chunks of different meats.
---
Wraith - I'm thinking some kind of spooky mixed drink where you can do a funky layering effect.
---
Clown - Sausage "Fingers"
---
Claudettes and Megs do this more. Baby Dwights just hide in lockers.
---
Imagine being this dense
---
Someone released some shiny ones that a bunch of streamers have been using recently which caught everyone's attention.
---
So people are now making new ones. 
---
While it might be a banable offense to change the icons, I don't think anyone has been banned yet. Hopefully if they do decide it to be banable, they do a warning announcement before hand.
---
In the mean time, bring on these sweet-ass icons
---
Some people actually insult me and then dodge me when I play Claudette. It's honestly ridiculous.
---
I wouldn't say it's op, it's unaffected by instadown hits, Rancor counters it pretty well also. It's very good thou, I see it a lot which means the DLC is selling well
---
Why disconnect when someone used a streamer? I really don't get people sometimes.

---
Bad idea for new/casual players. Tryhards will always pressure everyone to pick the best competitive meta perks and that would lead to them leaving lobbies, insults and more toxicity. I suggest an idea of being able to pick ONE perk to show off to other survivors.
---
That picture aint meg

Clearly you haven‚Äôt watched it, which I‚Äôm not telling you to. I‚Äôve never had anyone seen it and say it‚Äôs bad. It makes no sense judging if you don‚Äôt what you‚Äôre talking about. I‚Äôm by no means the type of person to fanboy over something but GoT is simply amazing. Last episode almost had me shaking because it was so good. It is WAY more than sex, which is less than you think anyways, and it isn‚Äôt badly written. Little things refer to what someone said/something that happened three seasons ago, seems like good writing to me

---
Im not a biased crybaby, even though i might seem like, i just really miss the old lighting because the lighting we have now looks ass
---
Are you saying Dwight will help your selfish playstyle or Dwight embodies it?? I think the urban evasion Claudette is the perpetrator here. Dwight‚Äôs are some of the best teammates.
---
Here we can see a baby Killer being born in the wild.
---
Cool Hugh as ace?
---
I at least run borrowed time with WGLF
---
"The top 1% of players with thousands of hours in game can dodge nurse blinks, so she must be balanced."   
---
Seems legit.
---
Under 1 million
---
Theyre bad, but their powers are boring to face, Legion: youre stuck mending all game instead of actually doing gens,
---
Plague: youre stuck curing your sickness instead of doing gens
---
You lose some progress if you log out too shortly after doing it. To avoid it, I linger in the menu for a few minutes when I want to get off. It happens a lot for me.
---
Paintbrush makes it 8 meters, you want M&amp;A to make it 0m outside of a chase. Which is the state you'll be in most of the  game because just like Scratched Mirror Myers, you're not chasing with this build, you're popping out from around a corner and getting a free jumpscare hit, disengaging and catching them off guard as they try to get to safety. 
---
The downside compared to the stealth King Myers is your lullaby to awake survivors and 9 seconds of sleep time, and of course people waking up can be heavily RNG-gated. The upside is you move faster, can get blood lust, and have a normal lunge.
---
I think you're confusing Meg/ Claudette with Dwight. 
---
90% of bad Dwight players are just extremely new. Yet I've seen P3 Claudettes &amp; Megs that play like they have a toaster for brain.
---
default Dwights are the cutest. only problem i have with Dwight mains is that they never crouch near hooks when it's Hag
---
All my laughs are ugly laughs.... :`(
---
Says 11 members, but 19 online.. nice job reddit!
---
This is amazing.
---
lol okay
---
i think it 2017 would be a better addition i feel like it would be a nice unique killer to add to the mix
---
When I play Dwight I always run the default outfit. So fun to loop for a handful of gens to be done when you have the default skin on. Always unexpected.
---
You lose all the leveling progress if you log out right after leveling a character, but as far as I know you keep all the blood points you spent
---
Darn
---
From OPs post:  
---
&gt;it punishes m1 killers
---
You cant really say to just use a 1shot when most killers dont have instadowns
---
There's no even a voice chat to constantly annoy you somehow. Do the fricking gens and escape, what's wrong?
---
You‚Äôre never gonna learn to hit them by avoiding them altogether
---
Just bring a good toolbox and try to be a gen jockey.
---
He's the crapper and he can take craps anywhere
---
Premonition is so much worse than Spine chill exclusively because Premonition has a cool down, but it would be busted without one.
---
I did with Nurse and Huntress aswell, PC.. its a but when you either close the game the wrong way or to fast
---
Nice quote where did you get it from?
---
I don't understand how your scenario refutes his point though?
---
default Dwight is absolutely adorable. as killer i sometimes don't have a heart to kill the guy. they're so altruistic and cute
---
I would trade unrelenting for blood hound any day of the week. Unrelenting really doesnt have enough of a cooldown to matter. Blood hound us a just never loose your target perk.
---
A cool suggestion I saw is just have Tiffany be the killer carrying Chucky around while he is used during the power and Mori animation.
---
Ps2 game really Ps1 is better
---
The second perk I could see being used as a rework for No Mither.
---
Oh no, he's serious
---
Become the gen-tap hero you were meant to be.
---
But yes, super annoying
---
James Gunn didn't go through someone's post history though..?
---
Survivor's T-Bag Per Second
---
You can look through their comment history. Literally all they do is scream how unfair everything is for survivors. That's it.
---
I'm pretty sure just hitting all "good" skillchecks on Ruin is still faster than gen tapping, let alone if you actually manage to hit even just 1 or 2 greats.
---
&gt;Any perk that gives a survivor a free escape is a crutch
---
How do you feel about adrenaline? Or unbreakable?
---
Nurse is fine. She just needs add-on reworks
---
That's actually very interesting, thanks for that fun fact :D
---
He's played some, however, he's only gotten to R17, and I'll quote him:
---
"As killer, I don't need perks and I 3/4K most of the time."
---
"Yeah, but you ARE a low rank."
---
"So? I can still kill all the survivors without perks, so why can't these whiny children?"
---
right, it would be cool
---
Both sides can be stupid/toxic
---
A lot of the good perks are locked behind other killers. I suggest keep playing wraith and level him up if thats who you enjoy. No point in leveling up other killers to what may seem like a ridiculously high level lol.
---
use flashlight as a fashion accessory hits a bit to close to home :( 
---
i tried to use them 
---
i just suck at using them
---
Did I hit a nerve? "Doing gens,you?" Is a reference to a popular DBD video. Unless you too hide around the edges of the map for the whole game,I don't see why you're getting so angry over a shitpost
---
r/bonehurtingjuice
---
Until you run into a SWF and there are four of them. And you‚Äôre a rank 1 killer.
---
dweet :)
---
For real tell this guy to play some killer games and he'll wee it's not as simple as he thinks.
---
When you said "stunning" i thought someone cosplayed a pallet
---
"see ya in the fog"  
---
not cringe at all
---
Can't tell if you're being serious or trolling now. Simple fact is a Nurse of even moderate skill is going to be difficult to counter/dodge. Go to the YouTube channels of the same people you mentioned and watch them play Nurse and tell me how much they've been countered.  When talking about balance for a game you can't take the performance of literally some of the best DBD players in the world and use it as a standard.
---
Guys... hes new. All the perks you list are teachables for other killers. Mabey something more obtainable for OP.
---
i have never encountered such a contentious userbase. everyone hates each other, and it seems like very few people play to have fun. 
---
killers dodge lobbies, face camp. survivors DC and stick around endlessly at the end of the match. what the fuck.
---
There are a lot of perks that give m1 killers one shots, noed, dh, hg, myc, rancor. Also a lot of killers flat out ignore mettle making it a dead perk some games. Mettle can be countered by trapper, hillybilly, LF, huntress, nurse before ptb, legion especially, plague and pig to an extent. Sure i have my games where mom comes in clutch but i would argue i equally have games i dont even get to use it. Also qe are all gonna ignore adrenaline which basically does the same thing? And dead hard is also a perk that saves survs from hits albeit with more counterplay. MoM can only be used once a game as well and then its like you only have 3 perks. It should have some power to it if being used bc you arent running a perk that could be used the whole trial.
---
The 3 and 4 mans I keep getting against are like New Legion bad when nerfs come you‚Äôll be unable to play him. I‚Äôve been dodging them because it‚Äôs so annoying. They think it‚Äôs a complete nerf because he‚Äôs necoming what is basically an m1 killer
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/
---
I created it today :D
---
Wow. Those were excellent dodges, nice.
---
Smart play. A lot of Lauries I tend to meet are really stupid or really slippery with no in between lol
---
i switch who i play as every everytime i survive a game 
---
so i can play as dwight for 3 matches but once i win i switch to meg. once i win with her i switch to claudette and so on and so on until im back to dwight
---
i do this with killers as well which is why i know im terrible with the huntress
---
the clown is fine but kinda boring, probably the most boring killer in game
---
&gt;Are you really telling a programmer that has worked with such systems that lagswitching is not possible on a dedicated server?  
---
That's exactly what I'm telling you, yes, and you would know that if you actually had experience in the field. A prime example of lag-switching being solved by the addition of dedicated servers is For Honor.  
---
&gt;The PTB stuff you're talking about is BS, if it's "Beta" then it's in a state which is very similar to release.  
---
That's not really what beta means. If it's in beta, it isn't finished, and again, always subject to change.
---
Nah not bannable. They just can‚Äôt take the stance that it‚Äôs okay because EAC isn‚Äôt regulated by BHVR. You‚Äôre fine to edit the UI assets.
---
It‚Äôs really cringey, still made me laugh though.
---
Slow breathing is a really good perk, just sitting at the other side of a pallet and healing would really help
---
ok
---
I think we all were mostly getting 3/4ks until about rank 10 when survivors are actually able to run you around structures.
---
Whispers 1 is a wasted slot too
---
1. Dwight
---
2. Meg with a spice of Nea
---
3.
---
You would get dodged because of WGLF. It doesn‚Äôt even matter if you farm people or not. That‚Äôs what stereotypes do.
---
If you just wanna farm use wglf, bt, dh and a perk of your choice
---
I swear i didn't do that also thanks
---
To be fair, depending on which part of Russia they are from they could be closer to EU than to China, latency wise. You never know.
---
Yeah, I like the guy, he's nice enough, but DAMN does he get mad FAST if he's sober
---
Keep leveling up wraith. Here is a perk build that you dont need any teachables for.
---
Sloppy butcher (One of the best perks in thegame in my opinion).
---
Blood hound.
---
Iron grasp (Try getting to the basement as much as possible).
---
And NOED (Aka: Hex; No One Escapes Death).
---
NOED is looked down upon though. I suggest try learning to play withought it. If you want to meme around, I suggest Monstrous shrine and getting them to the basement.
---
Shirtless David‚Äôs rise up.
---
Padded Jaws: ‚ÄúAm I a joke to you?‚Äù
---
I can‚Äôt even kill people with no perks at green ranks so I would love to see him do it at red ranks
---
Yeah that's true.
---
It's basically just what he says. You'd never know he was calling you a filthy (BEEP) who's mom should get (BEEP) by 6 (BEEP)
---
Good skill checks regress the gen...
---
you and me both :(
---
When i see russian names it's a good chance that they will cyka blyat in endgame, sandbag during game or dc. That's been my experience for most of dbd with russians. Let china deal with that behaviour for once
---
Ew people still use this perk? Just run Mettle Of Man instead of this broken down horse of a perk.
---
Yea, no. It‚Äôs a shit perk. And OP is defending himself.
---
Now that's wuss poppin JimüÖ±Ô∏èo
---
I don't think I've ever seen a DC against hag tbh. She's not hard to play against at all...
---
Can you spell those perks out please? I know what WGLF is but I don't know the other abbreviations.
---
lmao
---
Its 11am est 75% of population is ether at school or work atm
---
the numbers are a bit overtuned. 25 seconds without scratch marks is too long. Even poised isn't that long and that one is less conditional.  I like the idea of fragile but you'd probably get flamed for using it. guaranteed 100% bp is nice though. Also, this perk has happened to me before. I've been unhooked out of first state (with a good 10 seconds to go before second state) and died on my next hook immediately so.
---
No Mither + Self-care üëåüëå
---
Ehh I guess I can't blame him. I can get pretty mad too when I die in games I felt I should've lived in. But idk the killer is trying to have fun and play the game too, so being salty only hurts yourself.
---
I'd be ok with it as a cosmetic, now about the dragons...
---
unless you're constantly getting skillchecks every second of being on the gen it is still overall faster than tapping.
---
Jokes on you, it _is_ funny
---
I'm not in EST so that's irrelevant. I wouldn't be matched there anyway.
---
Every time I see a notification from you I get happy because I think you‚Äôre finally going to say yes to letting me take you out on a nice evening and do love movie stuff together. Can you not reply to me at all unless it‚Äôs for that reason?
---
I understand but listing perks from several different killers invalidates your excuse.
---
I feel ya I dont do that i try and hit greats. But for newer people its effective.
---
I‚Äôd rather see someone gen tapping than just looking for the totem, but just working through Ruin normally is better in the long run. Gives you skill check practice.
---
You‚Äôre joking right?
---
Iron maiden might as well be a requirement just for the QOL benefit of reloading.
---
Some games do include it. I know for a fact that Let It Die has fully textured naked models that you *can't* see unless you glitch the camera.
---
The butt dance is the real winner in this...
---
Killers: Don't butt dance you'll hurt my feelz
---
Surv's: If I die I die, the ritual must be performed.
---
Borrowed Time, Dead Hard
---
Nope that's my experiences mate.  Do you not find it's the same when you play?
---
they are like the older brothers of dbd
---
Borrowed time and dead hard :)
---
I wasn't talking about you True, you are one of the few good dead by daylight streamers that understand both sides and how frustrating and discouraging some of the things in thisngane can be. I agree with a lot of things that you say regarding Dead by Daylight. I was talking about another streamer who was mentioned in the thread who always complains about the game and puts himself in situations that he could have avoided.
---
It‚Äôs possible but I think it would make a lot of people unhappy, and I‚Äôm sure if it happens BHVR will get enough outrage to *eventually* make him his own character instead of a skin. It‚Äôll probably take like, 2 years but they‚Äôll listen eventually.
---
If it's just going to be a skin, why even bother?
---
Yes and unless you get unlucky it's still faster.
---
Plus, you will never hit Great skill checks if you tap all the time..
---
Just break the stupid totems it‚Äôs not hard
---
This is a blank post ? What screenshot do you speak of?
---
I doubt it. The owners of Ghost face wouldn't want him to be relegated as just a skin in a game full of iconic slashers.
---
I don't play for BP. I play for kills, and one certain kill is better than several potential ones.
---
ask the players who bought the my bloody valentine or Jason X trapper
---
His frenzy speed is lower but lasts longer, his normal speed is the same as trapper ext.
---
Balanced landing is good cause it still helps reduce the stagger from falls making a lot more spots loopable even without the speed boost.
---
They made a terminator skin for Death Garden. It‚Äôs a smaller game (muuuuch smaller) sure, but they‚Äôve shown that they can make licensed skins for existing characters.
---
Refresh post. :)
---
We already have a Clown, even better one than Pennywise
---
well you shouldn‚Äôt play for kills. yes, your role is a killer, but it‚Äôs a game and you‚Äôll have a higher chance of getting more bp and pipping even if you just hit them out without hooking more. i don‚Äôt see how that isn‚Äôt worth it.
---
I agree honestly, Legion is basically their own version of ghost face, the same with the trapper, the trapper is basically Jason,
---
Balanced landing is so damn useful. The reduction from a fall stun alone makes it worthwhile, the added speed is just a bonus and down right cruel on The Game map.
---
How do you know how many people are playing online right now?
---
unlucky :(
---
Don't let the damn survivors tell you how to do your, the killer's, job. You didn't have much of a choice obviously, you know they'll come to save their buddy if they aren't leaving, they know it all too most probably. 
---
Your strategy IS valid, whatever it is "and don't let anyone tell you otherwise".
---
You should also use Prove thyself. It'll help you max your objective points a lot easier.
---
Ahhhh my eyes have been opened.
---
Chunky would suck unless they make s sneaking character or something
---
I'm with you man. I love the meme but this one is bad.
---
*"Gotta go fast... GOTTA GO FASTER FASTER!"*
---
This is pedophile sh\*t
---
I like how it‚Äôs a couple short screams instead of a long one. Makes me think he‚Äôs liking it and stealing it all from me.
---
technically speaking you are in EST or some time some that translates to EST whether or not you live there...  NOW that other person who posted believes like most that most games only have American players that populate it.  now that is a silly understanding
---
Entitled sweaty survivor mains don‚Äôt let them bother you,
---
Oh man that would be amazing üòç especially if they could get Doug Bradley to voice for him.
---
I guess but this is a different case than that. Him being a skin is akin to him not being in the game at all. I agree that Legion is very likely based on Ghost face but I still feel they'd make them separate. 
---
Also could you imagine Ghost face trying to quickly vault windows and pallets? The guy usually trips over flat ground in the movies lol.
---
BP, Pips, Shards and XP are, in my opinion, for outside the trail. Inside I don't want to think about those because I think it will ruin my experience in the long run. 
---
And what do you mean should?
---
No really, watch the video, it's actually hilarious (in a really stupid way albeit)
---
They've been saying that the dedicated servers will allow them to gather more granular data about disconnects, and using that as an excuse for why they've taken no action up till now. So they won't be banning people with dodgy connections.
---
Personally, I almost never do this, but when I do it's either because of some Tbag spam or flashlight spam.  
---
Also, posting about it on  Reddit will only make you lose like a sore loser and provide enjoyment to those who actually do this, because camping is not reportable and so they are not in danger for doing so. Everybody knows there's campers in the game.
---
NSFW ? You have yourself a Quinton kink I see, I don‚Äôt blame you.
---
What bout' Herman?
---
I had somebody in a KYF ragequit because I was "tunneling".
---
I went back to the hook to get my trap, and they were still at the same area, crouching... since I downed them, I was "tunneling".
---
Honestly I feel like killer mains are the best part of the community. (For the most part)
---
Yeah I can dodge a chainsaw but the Corrupt Purge nope
---
Lets try and get this to the DBD Devs? A Rare Glitch it seems, First time happening it 600 hours of killer for me. But it should be fixed and Brought to their attention.
---
What faster, a non add-on chainsaw on billy or leatherface or a non brutal strength kick to a pallet? Probably been asked a lot, just wanna know whats better to do if i dont have addons and dont run brutal strength. Thanks for any answers!
---
so your idea of a better experience is standing next to a hook for over a minute? :P and you shouldn‚Äôt play for kills because then when you don‚Äôt get kills you‚Äôll be unhappy, but if you play for fun and bp then you‚Äôll be happy most of the time.
---
#PRAYFORAMANDA
---
What software did you use and how did you extract his model?
---
The PLAG dude
---
Oh god no. I have the worst imagin in my head of her guts disintegrating thanks to this.
---
He looks like a tall survivor with red eyes and some bits of his body have been torn off.
---
How are BP and fun related? And I wasn't standing still. I also don't get happy from kills, but from a challenge.
---
r/cursedimages
---
Basically this game is not about entertaining you with funny names
---
I totally agree, but that other dude was like why bother??  because it looks cool!  and it will make a $$$$
---
They added leatherface even though they had the hillybilly who was suppose to be non licensed leatherface
---
staying near a hook is less fun than not staying near a hook. staying near a hook also isn‚Äôt a challenge at all in the slightest.
---
Survivor deaths to escapes per map.
---
Killer and survivor usage overall.
---
Percentage of perk uses for both killer and survivor.
---
Highest winrate for killer/survivor perks.
---
What map?
---
Can‚Äôt remember the name but a cornfield map
---
You do understand that I don't just stand still near the hook everytime I get someone on it. Only if the gates are open and the survivors could just leave.
---
&lt;X Killer&gt; is boring, change my mind.
---
No, not a battle pass thing!
---
You needed to use your map to find her.
---
Have you played leatherface?  Literally the most braindead killer.
---
Its survivors like this that killers get Freddied. Not all killers play the same way you might actually have to do the unthinkable and adjust your looping style. The vile can be blocked by ducking behind downed pallets and trees and walls. LOS it like a myers.just because her vile doesnt count as an attack doesnt put it on the same level as hillbilly chainsaw or hell huntress oneshot hatchets.
---
Got t bagged at the gate by the only survivor The Who lives to see the doors open. I was play trapper Dad. She had adrenaline, MoM Dead Hard and Decisive. Go figure.
---
yeah, the exit gates are open, go around hitting survivors that haven‚Äôt left, you‚Äôll get 900 bp just from making them all injured. it‚Äôs also more fun to go around hitting them yes? it‚Äôs also more of a challenge.
---
ik she is hard at the start, but when u learn to land the blinks, its like the easiest killer
---
Done, but wow it's long. +34 questions i think..
---
Personal stat trackers, leader boards and an abandonment system
---
You finished it early denying the 30k it looks like, they piss you off or something?
---
Having such a massive lullaby radius is a huge disadvantage. With a normal 32m terror radius it‚Äôd probably be really difficult to even find survivors. A shorter terror radius means that people can hear her coming from quite a distance, but don‚Äôt have as much of a warning as to when she‚Äôs *close*.
---
Gen tapping... no gen grab. Pleb
---
They just kept running into and I just kept smacking
---
Lol you really did jumpscare them :,)
---
i think its more balanced as it gives you the massive disadvantage of no stealth
---
;)
---
Have you looked up anything into counter playing the nurse? There‚Äôs actually a lot survivors can do to avoid the nurse
---
You and I have different play styles. Let's just leave it at that.
---
You're right, Nurse mains just don't like hearing it.
---
Just because learning to play as Nurse has a steep learning curve doesn't mean she's not OP once you learn to use her.
---
That champ with double insta heal xd
---
I like a lot of the theoretical implementation questions, I would love some of those to be a thing.
---
OP just saw the Claudette and posted it as a JOKE and REFERENCE to the video. OP didn‚Äôt say it applies to the game he‚Äôs in.
---
u got mori?
---
Finally. Its not bad it's just soooooooo boring
---
Not gon lie... I'm a trapper main and I don't get it.
---
The 4 charge medkit is strong.
---
try the setup but change the addons for the other mirror and a dead rabbit. its about the same but you are faster and can lunge. 100% 4k chance
---
Its just a joke u dont need to understand and next time ill try make it more understandable thx for the feedback
---
Oh, I thought it was Sheen. Sheen as Feng then.
---
wish the perk functioned. Used it 6 times against a huntress and it didn't work a single time when she was facing the locker right in front of it and i wasn't exhausted. also hasn't worked against any other killer yet. the only time it worked for me was on ptb.
---
I tend to see survivors DCing more than I do killers. Just saying.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Ignore them play as you wish. Welcome to killing you will get bullied until you grind enough hours as a killer that you will get average of 2 DC per match.  I recommend you watch YouTube videos of good killers like monto or tru3. Also play some survivor to learn the map and pallets.  Give it some time you will make lots of people tilt. And yah camp and tunnel for fun play with their emotions. And keep it cool :P cheers :D
---
hi it's me again, don't actually click on this.
---
the main bonus of using it is taking longer to heal and theres a lot of perks that have good synergy with it
---
She should be nerfed on PC. On ps4 she is just fine lol /s
---
- Wazzap?
---
- Doing gens, having a bud.
---
- True, true.
---
I would pay more money if it meant a brief time window for additional bloodpoints especially survivor, 3-4 items for 30 minute to a hour long match for bad RNG BW is really distasteful and extra salty when disconnects ruin your chances at BP as both roles.
---
It would also help separate the players that are actually dedicated to the game from those that want to freeload especially if that money helped contribute to improve the overall quality of the game.
---
I‚Äôm about to give it a go
---
Jesus christ its a joke calm down, are you this claudette in the picture?  Take a breather son
---
Sounds like they're gathering data to know where to put advertising.
---
 "Hey DbD players really like to go to museum lets put a sign near one"
---
DH until you get a better exhaustion perk lol
---
Punish people that intentionally DC because they dont want to face a certain killer, get downed ONCE or get hooked once with gradually increasing time out penalties like League of Legends does.
---
So you think it‚Äôs better than lithe ?
---
Swf doesn't somehow make someone better or worse at chases.
---
Better than lithe and dead hard ?
---
I guess you either cant or don‚Äôt read. How sad for you.
---
Can i be a mod?
---
I think you replied to the wrong comment lol.  His comment about gen x and praying for me was incredibly weird.  And yes we both agree he was clearly using that shit to camp his survivors.
---
Why gotta be so edgy?  Mum didn't hug you when you asked her?  Life's getting more  stressed every day?  Drop the attitude fam
---
I read it its just a joke, laugh or move on.
---
What the fuck is that even supposed to mean? 
---
&gt;lmao killers still force survivors to genlock themselves
---
After 1000 hours I do not care what people think of my playing style. Sometimes I tunnel and sometimes I camp. Deal with it cause I have to deal with it when playing survivour. Best part of the whole game is when it ends and I get 3-4K and they start whining about those things. Sure you can take advice if they have something important to say but I honestly don¬¥t care anymore. Also comments are turned off in my profile for a reason: No one comments when I play fair and got a 4K but everyone does if I have camped or tunneled someone. Just turn them off haha
---
Console. No post-game chat
---
Yeah.. it's risky and a good strat for waluigi is just all hex totem perks because you'd get alerted if someone's trying to cleanse and you can just phase walk back. However if they do manage it's a 2/5 chance there going get HG but if TOTH is cleansed it's mostly a game over
---
This is pretty sad
---
Museum killer confirmed.
---
Opera killer confirmed.
---
i think meg should be meg in dbd brian should be pig or jesus jeff
---
Talking about edgy and then going straight into ‚Äúmom‚Äù jokes. 
---
Hypocrisy at its finest. 
---
Your feeble attempt to troll and trigger has been noted as a failure. Go find someone else to bug.
---
I think the simple answer is to use Ruin with killers who can move around map quickly. 
---
Corrupt Intervention for killers with less map presence but benefit greatly from an early snowball. 
---
Obviously there is more to this but I use this as my own general guideline. 
---
Ruin : Spirit, Billy, Nurse...Hag? 
---
CI : almost everyone else
---
Did it 4k like you said but I got a message don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll understand it because I don‚Äôt speak the language but you might, a guy messaged me ‚ÄúEh ta mere la pute‚Äù
---
because those killer are so good that you cant really blame em
---
effectively there are three prestige levels to every character, and if you reach them, you get a piece of bloody clothing. if you get to p3 on claudette, due to the fact that her bloody outfit is basically mud brown, she has the best camo in the game by far.
---
On ps4, we don't have end game chat, thank the Entity. Likewise I don't find anything toxic except leaving the game, or exploiting, or cheating. If it's in the game, it's fair play and should be used. Like you said they will talk shit anyway, this leaves you with 2 options: Talk shit back! It's a videogame, 50 percent is talking shit, the other 50 is pretending you can back it up :p the other option is ignore them :) there's nothing they can say about you that you already don't know about yourself. Anything they say isn't true so brush it off! Get back out there killer!
---
\&gt;They shouldnt try to know their playerbase
---
I‚Äôm a p3 Dwight and I say that this is completely wrong. Claudettes and default jakes are the perpetrators of this imo
---
I mentioned in another comment that it should give you aura reading that shows you and the rescued person the killers aura like Breakdown does. I'd be fine with either one really, I just hate how hard it is to get all 4 stacks
---
it's to create a general picture about what the average player likes so they can design stuff better suited aesthetically etc.
---
Why you gotta hate the cutest surv in the game? Dwight players don't even do that!
---
I really wish were was a direct option in "What affects your game enjoyment negatively" to just say "Fucking map offerings, remove them, please."
---
PLease please please its fine if two or three fix it but just find the totem why is that so hard four people one totem should not be this hard!!
---
If you have Adre or MoM then DH. 
---
If not then SC.
---
SC is trash tho, but it's stupid to go into a match without any recovery.
---
I said the next one needs to be candyman come on disappears with bees and reappears with a hook how is this not a thing?
---
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIL
---
I really will never understand people that either DC on their death hook or DC when the gates are already powered. Like why are you fucking yourself over when the game is going to end for you in 5 seconds anyway?
---
It has no counter
---
I never DC during the match. Only at the start (if I see a map offering or get Lery's/Haddonfun) or just play it out.
---
Don't hate on another man's hustle. Supply and demand
---
100% should trust this guy with your steam credentials and stored banks details ;-) Also $50 to get 1 mill bloodpoints, def worth kappa
---
I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling survivors and your dog to! \*disconnect\*
---
is the bloody brown better than normal brown? i feel like red is more noticeable in some maps than just her brown shirt and those brown pants u can get in the shop
---
well the problem is it‚Äôs dried blood, and not exactly bright red.
---
Thanks, i love it
---
It's always the megHeads that do that shit. 
---
*please stop using pallets if you refuse to loop, no one wants to play with pallet-wasters*
---
Depends on situation. Sometimes you can get a survivor to drop a pallet faster by charging up your chainsaw and thus get the faster break.
---
If you have the best charge up speed add-ons then it can be faster than brutal strength.
---
IMO, chainsawing the pallet is better overall because you don't take your eyes off the survivor as long as when you kick a pallet in a chase. If the pallet is in an awkward place (such as inside the bus on Autohaven) then it might be better to kick it rather than stun yourself.
---
It was almost that exact scenario. Lullaby was cleansed and my skill check disappeared.
---
Instead of bottles of poison, he throws croissants.
---
mess with the bull get the horns lol
---
Ima disagree on Freddy being shit.
---
7 seconds to hit someone: That can be a mindgame and few killers can land a hit in seven seconds. Nurse can, Spirit, Hillbilly, and Hag in some scenarios can, Legion and Wraith can sometimes, EW1 Myers might, maybe Pig. 
---
Easy to wake up: You still give yourself away. Either a notification, or you're slumped over while asleep, letting him know you're being awoken. Being woken near him via another survivors produces snaps and claps for him to hear. 
---
He has some of if not the BEST stall. 50% action speed penalty is HUGE. He has tracking similar to Doc, who is undeniably one of the best trackers. 
---
Legit his only flaws are that mid chase his power does nothing directly, you can do stuff in his face during dream transition, and his default power range is kinda small. Heck, the dream world mist + heavy fog + his shortness opens up more mindgame potential, so his power still helps indirectly mid chase.
---
I can see why people see him as not mid- high, but he is FAR better than the bottom. IMO he's 8th at worst and 5th at best. That's not bad.
---
they should make stacking WGLF easier (healing slugs should stack it at least) and they should give it a real side-effect.
---
Yeah both situations it happened to me it was the same scenario. An undocumented lullaby buff lol
---
I think its more of a priority thing. They're asking just in case its wanted a lot more than the other features so they know its worth putting the time in the first place. 
---
In the grand scheme of things, its really not that bad, just slightly annoying. It would be a nice feature to have.
---
What I mean is that killers like Billy, Nurse, and Spirit don't need Ruin *because* of their map pressure and ability to get quick downs. It takes up an unnecessary perk slot
---
I think it has something to do with the asymmetric nature of the game, us vs. them. 
---
As a killer main I dont really meet or talk with a lot of killers, but my interactions with them on reddit have been mostly positive. We dont all get to chat and gang up on survivors post match like you all do ;)
---
That said, I've found killers to be more kind than survivors... bit I also dont survive a lot to experience the other side, and I really dont want to set off that particular argument (who's more toxic!?!?)
---
Just be willing to be a good sport after a match, do your part to clean up this festering cesspool of a community, lol. 
---
Lead with a gg, and find something about the other side to compliment. If they're being shitty, I say it's not called for, and that the community would really benefit from being kinder to each other.
---
Kill them with kindness. After you kill them, of course.
---
I had a guy comment on one of my steam pictures (no comments allowed on my profile) that I was a bellend tunneling try hard and I was added to his "list".
---
I just hooked someone, but saw no one with BBQ. Someone else got unhooked so I went towards them and only found a scratch mark trail. I followed it in spirit form and downed the guy, who turned out to be the guy who just got unhooked.
---
Some how it's my fault the guy who just got unhooked left a massive trail to where he was hiding from the spirit.
---
Well each match there is 4 survs and 1 killer. Kinda how the math should work.
---
Ah. imo it's 100 percent needed to play killer but not so much for survivor. But it makes avoiding Huntress and finding the hatch 100 percent easier
---
I agree with you. But in the realm of one choosing to use one of these perks that‚Äôs along the lines of how I‚Äôd go about it!
---
1. 7 seconds its too long, and some survivors always run to safe areas so thats one of the reasons freddy is shit
---
2. other reason why freddy sucks is because its so easy to wake up, so his power is pretty weak
---
3. 50% penalty for a few seconds its not enought, the doc actually can be better at snowballing, altought the doctor is pretty weak
---
4. it doesnt matter that lullaby's is not directional because you can still see freddy while in dream trancision if he doesnt run one of his better addons.
---
imo he is the worst killer in game, his power is so bad designed, his power doesnt help him on the chase, his snowball pressure its pretty mediocre, he has to wait 7 seconds to do any damage while the wraith its just 3 and he gains a speed bust, his map control is pretty lame, like clown has better map control and only on rank 20-10 he is okay, but when ur on red ranks he is by far the worst killer in the game without a doubt, so yea, thats why they are reworking him, devs know that a buff will not fix him. thanks for ur opinion anyways, have a great day.
---
Plus the robes extend past the knees and would.probably trip you up a lot.
---
&gt; Don't hate on another man's hustle.
---
He can be doing anything if it is something sad and pathetic we all have the right to criticise he is posting a retarded idea and the community has a right to criticise it. 
---
In addition i almost guarantee the "boosting" service will require you handing over your steam information while he plays on your account, only a moron would take that deal.
---
See an injured survivor working on a gen while holding a medkit? DoN'T TunNeL
---
The fact that they even managed to kill anyone wearing all that is a near supernatural feat itself.
---
You'd be surprised, if you look on eBay you'll see all sorts of stuff like this for tons of games. Gamers with money are a dangerous thing. People on fallout 76 were selling gun blueprints for like 40 dollars a pop, and you would think, who would pay that trash? And under the history there was like 30 transactions or purchases.
---
For me, it depends entirely on what's IN the Battle Pass.
---
If it's only cosmetics? Sure, knock your lights out.
---
If it's cosmetics &amp; a small amount of shards/bloodpoints? Getting a bit iffy for me.
---
If it's mostly shards/bloodpoints then you get into the debate about "is this play-to-win" &amp; that's just a debate I don't want to ever have to deal with.
---
I respect your opinion, so no harm no foul. Plus you have a great day too üòä.
---
I'm not happy there's a Family Guy.
---
Do you think that means his prices will be half off? :p
---
Isn't that a taco bell dessert?
---
Best advice for anyone starting out as a killer, stop worrying or care about what the survivors think. Its a PvP game where you are against them. You will always get people calling you a camper or tunneller, even of you put them on the hook and walk away and then leave them be if they get saved. 
---
In the end game chat, I normally just type gg and leave, or just hide the chat all together and just leave. I quite like the salty profile comments, but if you don't want to deal with them, make it so people can't comment. 
---
Play to have fun man, and enjoy killer. Don't let others tell you what you should and should not do.
---
That was probably your best play. Dont worry, stay positive. 
---
If they're being garbage in post game chat you arent obligated to read it. Close chat!
---
Best advice I can give as a killer main (since launch, 3 killers only) is to not return fire when survivors are being salty. You'll burn yourself out.
---
Just give your players a GG and be willing to positively discuss the match if you want to and they're amicable.
---
Negativity in this community will erode at your very soul if you let it.
---
It's always the people with DS or MoM who tbag, and if I see they are my obsession I'll save them for my Rancor :p
---
If that‚Äôs true then damn he mad
---
Why cause he‚Äôs good at evading you?
---
Honestly I disagree. I think if anything needs to go it's his free Brutal Strength he gets with his Chainsaw. Dude is basically running 5 perks at all times.
---
Ninja Freddy build with M&amp;A + Red Paintbrush work too.
---
I think they do it because they‚Äôre otherwise powerless to express how mad they are.
---
Wall of text... eyes hurt
---
give her iron grasp, its saved my ass on numerous occasions
---
I was called toxic today because I stayed next to the hook even though the other three ran circles around me.
---
Like, why would I fucking leave when you make it this fucking easy?
---
What video are you talking about? It shows as just a picture to me?
---
I think you mean Jane's THICC ASS.
---
They said they won‚Äôt be doing any killers that have non-human features as it takes too much to create a whole new rig :(
---
That's what I figured.
---
*BUT I SAID I DIDN'T WANNA GET IT YOU SUNNUVA-*
---
More voicelines and emotes would be pretty great.
---
The thing is, the nurse has an insanely high learning curve. So nerfing her would just deter people even more so from playing her. Plus, how would you nerf her really? You can't really nerf her without completely changing her basically. She's already the slowest moving killer, her power has a pretty large draw back, and certain loops can completely screw her. Nerfing her is literally punishing people for learning her and obtaining the skill that it takes to play her.
---
Let‚Äôs start with a few facts. 
---
Fact number 1, had you bothered to read the link I gave you, you‚Äôll see where they mention hitboxes need addressing. Try going into it and searching for the word ‚Äúhitbox‚Äù, and see what you find! (But you won‚Äôt do that)
---
Fact number two, if you‚Äôd been keeping up with PTB announcements, you‚Äôd see that the devs are making it so Nurse M1 hit registers for MoM, and that the current state is a glitch. Meaning they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs OP. I‚Äôd give you a link, but why bother, you clearly don‚Äôt read. 
---
I check other posts to see how much of a hypocrite someone is, and yeah... you‚Äôre full of shit. You don‚Äôt actually read or pay attention, and have the audacity to call others ‚Äúbrainlette‚Äù when you yourself are practically substandard. 
---
Either back up your posts with verifiable facts for shut the fuck up.
---
As long as killers get a nice buff, sure
---
Prestige 3. Every 50 levels you can prestige your character, up to prestige 3. Once you prestige you lose your perks but gain a bloody cosmetic for the character
---
That matchmaking though, Rank 4 to Rank 19.
---
Wouldn't it make more sense if Springtrap was the killer. Not so into eh FNAF lore anymore, but I'm pretty sure that Freddy and the opther original animatronics are the spirits of children acting out their revenge.
---
What about Jason X? I mean it's not Jason, but is it a separate license??
---
I dont doubt chucky is boring, they couldnt do much with a small doll anyway, but it would be creepy as fuck to see one of those porcelain dolls chaising you
---
Welp i said my piece lets hope they listen.
---
How many times can one use Borrowed Time in a match? I assumed it was a one-time thing, but I reread the perk description and theres no mention of how many times it can be used. So... can it be used indefinitely?
---
Freeload? Any player who has this game bought and paid for it. I own every licenced DLC except Ash so I have spent more than base game but no player is a freeloader, they purchased the game and they are not inclined to purchase anything else.
---
Also if you alienate those players your player base will see a significant loss which will increase wait times for matches
---
But it only the ones you don‚Äôt like
---
yep, because SWF abuses third party means to subvert the game mechanics
---
Yeah I'm never toxic (atleast not consciously)
---
Free for ps4
---
Not a bad idea.
---
Only issue is the killer power with the suits.
---
Take a big map like the red forest for example, i have 2 suits that are both on the otherside of the map from where i can't get to them.
---
in addition im going to be honest, it's a bad power, not to insult you but something that is basically a glorified hook wouldn't really work, killer powers are supposed to compliment the killer not remove the need for hooks from the game.
---
Similar to fortnite, where you pay 10 dollars and get skins for leveling up until the season (set period of time) is over.
---
Infinite
---
Its always good. But it's meant for Lery's for optimal spook factor.
---
I always thought he was dumb, but after rewatching child's play from beginning to end a few years ago it's actually one of my favorite ones from that era. I mean not Halloween but still, it was alot better than I remembered. And usually it's the other way around
---
Just to clarify so you're aware, the custom icon packs we modify into the PC copy of DBD ourselves and run the risk of getting banned for, these packs are sold or supported by the devs they're done by the community....
---
It‚Äôs a difficult addon to get you should be rewarded for getting something that rare
---
The point of the game is being thrown into the match with no communication and you have to work together. It has no voice coms. This would just be a huge buff to survivors, and swf are already difficult to play against when they coordinate. They will never add this in, I promise. Survivor mains will downvote my post because they can‚Äôt think logically.
---
Following along with the other reply I already gave you, it‚Äôs clear you do not read or pay attention to anything that‚Äôs actually going on with the development of the game. You‚Äôre going on and on about customers who have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about, when it‚Äôs obvious that you are the one who has no idea.
---
I‚Äôve already supplied you proof that her boxes are a problem, it‚Äôs not my fault that you didn‚Äôt read it. Go back and educate yourself before you speak again please. There‚Äôs a reason your post is getting downvoted while mine is getting upvoted. I supply facts, you supply a jumble of words and opinions.
---
No, you shouldn't it punishes everyone else in the game for no reason. lol
---
Free for Ps4 if you own PlayStation plus and downloaded it in the month it was available. What about players or joined before or after that month? Even so they paid for a PSN subscription and are still not inclined to purchase anything else.
---
And hitting hatchets against top level survivors isn‚Äôt the easiest. How can you complain about this and not tombstone Myers? Killers need strong addons and they are rare as shit. I haven‚Äôt seen an insta down huntress in months
---
Get good play around it
---
It took me a lot of time, but I realized people just play the game how they want to, and being salty about it in postgame chat doesn't help.
---
When I play killer, I try not to tunnel and instead go for the person which unhooked. Sometimes I can't find that person though and some time later I see the one who I hooked before. Bad luck, here we chase again.
---
In those cursed 3 player lobbies I don't care as much and mess around more.
---
I don't facecamp. If there's two players hooked near each other though, don't expect me to walk to the other side of the map and giving you two free unhooks. 
---
Mostly I play for points still I still need a shitton of them. But I don't like hatch standoffs and if there were DCs (for no reason) I'm being friendly half the time or kill the first two persons and let the last one go.
---
Anyway. That's just me.
---
When playing survivor I see almost everything. Some killers stay close to your hook so you can always hear the heartbeat. Desperate to me, but they get less points for it. Just too bad teammates fall for it a lot. In the end, that killer won't get many points. A 4k? Perhaps. But I'd call it a hollow win for the killer. In that killer's eyes though, he might be happy about the 4k and the win, and doesn't care much about the measly 12k points. If he didn't camp or tunnel, he could have like double the points.
---
I'm not saying I'm not bitter about such killers, since my rounds sometimes end quickly. I just came to accept that that's the way the game works. 
---
Yes, there are some... 'morals' which some killers and survivors follow, and I like them for that. Nothing forces them to do so though. 
---
But then there's survivor hook farmers, scared teammates who do nothing (which annoys me more tbh), people literally running away from you so you can't heal them, then proceed to get caught, leaving you just shaking your head and wishing for halfway decent teammates with some    basic know-how.
---
It's the nature of the game, with all it's positives (fair killers, no tunnel or camp, maybe giving you hatch after disconnects, I even like small gestures like nodding the head or something, since it also looks funny) and negatives (tunnel, camp).
---
I'm glad that I'm no longer seething with anger for campers, waiting to talk shit. Better for my sanity. Sometimes, a sarcastic comment is still written though. I'm not completely immune to some shit happening. 
---
It was a long road to here for me. Maybe that story helps you.
---
You shouldn't get one shot hatchets just for getting a rare addon, it's not fair to anyone
---
Dude, just play the nurse and you'll learn to play against her. I'll even give you a hint on how to beat her, a good nurses strength isn't in knowing how to blink, it's in predicting survivors movement. Just learn how to be u predictable, break line of sight and try to make her guess what to do. If your first instinct is to run to a pallet, you deserve to be downed.
---
If you want to talk about an unfair killer, then talk about spirit. If a nurse downs you it's because she could predict you, a spirit just need to be able to hear, a literally no way to juke a nurse.
---
someone has no idea how to avoid hatches lmao
---
Camping isnt toxic if survivors make it your best play, or you have a hook with gates open.
---
And honestly, if someone is teabagging or otherwise flashing their ass during a match... maybe smack em a few times on the hook. 
---
Maybe. As the entity moves you.
---
But for the love of all that is murderous, keep post game chat as civil as you can =)
---
Survivors should learn to play around the hatchets
---
Haaaaa!!
---
Oh ok fair enough thank you, I‚Äôve never played a game with a battle pass before, DBD is the only multiplayer game that holds my interest lately.
---
Wow you‚Äôre so right and everyone else here is a fucking idiot. It amazes me how stupid the masses are.
---
Tombstone Myers is a meme he's so bad.  He takes a shitload of stalk to even get his tier 3 while also being slow as shit with movement speed.  Also you can see this addon coming and simply jump into a locker when he's on you completely wasting his addon and forcing the hook instead.  How is this what you compare to iri heads?  Bad comparison.
---
Mr. bing bong agrees
---
Me to, but if the offers there.
---
You never DC except when you DC and are part of the problem that you're trying to justify to yourself that you're not?
---
His frenzy speed is marginally slower, but lasts much longer. He actually covers more distance now in a single feral frenzy.
---
How come meg is useless? I use her all the time
---
No, it‚Äôs locked, as nurse is free she‚Äôs never locked, and from looking at the others it would most likely be hag
---
Yea I'm not saying I agree with it, but a percentage of gamers like pay to win features and they'll find them even if the devs don't make them available :p
---
Its not, its faster to just work through it, even with hitting the good skill checks its still faster
---
and what does this add to this comment section lol
---
I‚Äôm not angry at the killer I‚Äôm just saying as a killer if I see a survivor get unhooked I‚Äôm just gonna go n try at least to hit his unhooked and if I feel like I can‚Äôt go get them then I will go get the person who was just unhooked
---
tell 'em!
---
Missing the point, doesn't matter if you dodge 4 and get hit by 1. it makes up for a shit huntress
---
Did I claim you have, ‚Äúmassive rants‚Äù or did I say that you rant all the time. Rants can be small things Tru3.
---
I've had games where I chain hooks and even have two people in the basement at once and gens pop like candy. When killers complain about genrushing it has nothing to do with survivors and everything to do with generators being too easy to finish and killers having almost no room for any error at all. Survivors have a lot of room for error and a very easily done objective. Then shit like comms is used to subvert mechanics in the game giving an advantage. It is a problem. There's a reason almost no one plays killer on console
---
But the amount of times you get iri heads in a bloodweb is minimal. It‚Äôs balanced as hell
---
Like I said not that into the lore anymore. But Springtrap was different. The springtrap suit was designed to also be worn by someone while Freddy and the other 3 were just robots.
---
Twice Baked Potato ala Freddy
---
Iridescent, OP said something about instadown add ons.
---
Because people don't like the fact the game has a killer you actually need to hide from? Beats me tbh
---
sure. i like it tho ;)
---
I feel kind of bad for my survey answers because I truly love this game, it's just that it's so buggy and frustrating right now that I feel like you can't even play a normal game. I hope they fix it soon ;-;
---
NEIN
---
There's two types of Clauds: P3 and brown shirt Clauds(1), and people that play her because they like her(2)
---
Do you mean insidious plays via camping with bubba or something else, if it‚Äôs the former I would disagree.
---
&gt;DC when the gates are already powered.
---
They probably didn't get much bp to lose and the survivors will probably just sit there and wait at the exit gate to waste time.
---
I thought about that too, the golden rule of a killer power. However, the suits' job is to patrol gens and track survivors. The suits find survivors and you go to chase them. If they get out of the chase the suits just find them again and you chase them again until you down them (assuming you're a good enough killer player to do so). I don't see the need for the power to affect a chase honestly, it does it's own job.
---
It just breaks my heart that Meg gets so much hate. What do you mean sprint bursting everywhere is not useful??! Duh, the best strategy. /s 
---
My poor Meg.. But this won't stop me from playing her!
---
Done. Hopefully now they rework Jane and The Plague.

You can open the model in Blender by importing the .dae file.

I would assume it was the thing suggested a while ago where it would be a case of scrapping items you don't want into a resource to get something new.

I'm just worried that if they introduce those it'll be in loot boxes.
---
That's a good point, but any other killer can do the exact same thing with a normal hook. I can see why you think it might be overpowered, but thinking of how a game could play out I don't really think it would be. Could you maybe elaborate more?
---
Now imagine the kid trying to move you to a hook
---
"Put your back into it you little bitch!"

please explain good sir

Money for double blood points? No way.

Bush meat/ Game meat is more common in African cuisine. Reptiles, Amphibians non-domesticated mammals. Basically very hard to get meats or meats you don't want to F around with trying to cook. Cows, Goats, Pigs/Boars would fetch a lot of money and wouldn't be killed off so readily. Chickens are more common protein to be consumed in Africa and then fish. Tons of root vegetables, rice and nuts are also used.

Cuz most times you dont realise that you've just played the game with a good russian player. All this situation is called 'survivorship bias', in this case it means that you ignore your good experience and remember bad one

Do you have some to spare?
---
Isn't that already a thing? I could've sworn it was. Maybe I'm just going crazy...that, or the noise level of the heartbeat.
---
Better call poison control.
---
I didn't know that actually. But even then it would still make sense for Freddy to be the killer. Freddy is an animatronic bear that puts people into suits, correct? Makes sense to me at least
---
I can finally turn all those darn splinters into bloody party streamers... free bloodpoints for everyone
---
Hell the fuck yeah
---
I was going to make a survivor pudding, but I think I'll turn that into some sort of boozy shot. I like the idea of the offerings turn into drinks. But, I wouldn't mind making an Escape Cake.
---
anyone have a photo of what a p3 trapper looks like in game
---
All of them are op as shit besides paramedic I like it tho but u know the killer Mains be like survivor with New perks where is my buff
---
No but there is more to do then just gens. Have some fun. It is a game after all. I get pretty annoyed when other survivors gen rush too. Not only do you get low BP and don‚Äôt pip but it‚Äôs fucking boring.
---
&gt; how would you nerf her really? 
---
Good point (I'm not OP by the way). She would've needed an overhaul in my opinion. I don't care if it takes 3-6 months, as long as it's in the works I'll be happy.  Although, I disagree on keeping her the way she currently is because 'she has a steep learning curve' or 'you can mind-game her this and that way' does not make her anything close to balanced.
---
Nah let people do gens how they want at least there doing them.
---
r-rework a single survivor??
---
Emotes? Sure, whatever. Voicelines though, it would break the game's immersion, at least Ash/Plague does it for me.
---
Dude really
---
I want Ghostface tbh. And a killer who would be obsessed with cleanliness. The complete opposite of The Plague. Some egocentric psycho in a suit :) That would be cool asf
---
Oh that's hilarious
---
Question does one need to have everything that monto did for it to classed a Jumpscare Myers build? In my opinion no but I wanna know yours
---
A person being a dick to you isn't an excuse to be a dick back.
---
You right, you right
---
Should I have put it to Lery‚Äôs?
---
Unfortunately console doesn‚Äôt have this luxury.
---
His bout the teacher? Is she Hag?
---
I meant voicelines only when characters load in, like ash.
---
And than disconnects happen lol
---
^ This. You can use it every time you unhook someone, so assuming that you unhook everyone each time they're hooked, it'll be 2 unhooks * 3 survivors = 6 borrowed times.
---
Ash lines only break it for me because they sound like they‚Äôre a million miles away &amp; under a pillow.
---
Hopefully it‚Äôs selling back addons you don‚Äôt want/need.
---
Gotta Blast!
---
the maps are problem in the game. I refuse to play on maps  where you dont actually get to play the game.
---
People are funny when they say that.
---
Extremely keen on the idea of turning all of my other items into flashlights. I never use anything else on survivors.
---
I know it‚Äôs just as stupid as people who use the term tunnelling, tunnelling is just kill rushing, doing the objective.
---
50 upvotes btw. This post just proves the circlejerk that happens daily on this sub. Well done guys, a post that contributes nothing positive to the sub but you'll still downvote me for saying this. A post that only reinforces the us Vs them mentality and alot of circlejerking amongst killer players.

My new favorite wraith nickname.

they could still add him after legion despite legion basically being copyright friendly ghostface. remember they still added leatherface even though we had billy
---
This right here üëç. Lol
---
well since so many actors are straight i dont have a chance with them
---
since pablos actor is gay i still dont have a chance with him but i can at least live in denial and convince myself i do 
---
which makes everything better for everyone
---
the lawsuit is planned to settle within the next few weeks, hopefully
---
I hope no one actually votes for it. DBD is already quite expensive (if you buy all DLCs, and I still cant fathem not having every dlc)
---
If you play this game to be courteous to others, you're playing the wrong game. Play to win. The courtesy you're expecting from the killer is NEVER given by survivors. You don't see survivors slowing down green progress if the killer is underperforming. Your logic is undeniably bad.
---
Yeah, Escape Cake would be easy. A lemon vanilla bean cake, with white chocolate butter cream and lemon curd. Topped with a White chocolate gauche.    
---
I would soak the banana's in rum and brown sugar. Caramelize them, then make a puree to add for my pudding base. Add a bit of of creme de banana, and Godiva white chocolate liqueur. With a sphere mold make the eyeballs with condense milk and jello, some food coloring and flavorings. The fingers can be made from sugar cookie dough. You have some survivor pudding shots. Yum-yum!
---
We got 3/4 of it so far
---
Man the newest marvel movie ‚ÄúEndgame Collapse‚Äù, sold me on marvel. Sorry dc.
---
Adrenaline i dislike as well, but its more situational since it relies on the last gen popping. Unbreakable is honestly fine to me, same with no mither. Most of the time a survivor gets picked up right away rendering unbreakable useless, but if the killer wanders off its fair that there are consequences to leaving a slugged survivor unattended.
---
Theres not a map in the game that I havent gotten a 4k and a 0k in. Random maps put am element of luck into the game.
---
Be a good sport and play the hand you're dealt.
---
Or dont. But there are enough people complaining about DC's right now that I have no doubt that the devs see it. Times coming that it's going to hurt more than it does now to DC
---
Im not telling anyone how to do gens, im just saying that gen tapping is the slowest form of doing them
---
Sure, re-read what you just said and try to self-reflect. No need to start your sentence with ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an idiot‚Äù to OP unless you were trying to be a ‚Äúdick‚Äù. Hopefully you can see the irony through your arrogance.
---
If it's only cosmetic, I'd be fine with it. It's not required, it'd theoretically just be a subscription service to auric cells cosmetics, and nobody NEEDS them.
---
If it's anything BUT cosmetics, I'd be annoyed by it existing.
---
Honestly disagree about dead hard. It can secure an escape but it requires timing to use effectively and doesn't always work
---
I wasn't complaining. That's your assumption. You got histrionic for no reason. I was just playing for bloodpoints and you got guys started name calling and saying nasty childish things (That I left out of the screencap on purpose) because you didn't get your way. You certainly have an interesting take on the things you guys said...
---
Same aspect of having Insidious, right? You would need to be strategic how you use it without costing yourself time. And then everyone would just be dumb and use it to camp hooked survivors, allowing people to finish gens.
---
This is literally already a thing in the game... It's weird you're so shocked lmao.
---
Pig inception! Minced pork, shaped into a pig, wrapped in bacon. Topped with Bacon gravy and served with bacon fat infused mashed potatoes.
---
You can play to win n still be courteous. Using your logic because a survivors ‚Äúnever‚Äù courteousness I should tunnel people and not show a little mercy.
---

"HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MORE?"
---
(uses Begrimed Chain)
---
Fair. Im not against a nerf so long ad its still usable. Maybe it needs an extra hit or instead of aura being shown after a complete heal it shows when you start healing
---
&gt; if you DC late game you get literally nothing
---
you keep everything as survivor by dcing but offerings. And now your xp offerings even work which wasn't the case previously.
---
Not even that, the best defense against the nurse is to learn how to be unpredictable. The most predictable thing someone can do is run to a looping spot, which is the most predictable thing you can do. Like where you gonna go, left or right. When I go against a nurse I run to jungle gyms, run through trees, do as much as I can to keep distance and break line of sight. The fact that people don't understand a nurse strength is prediction, if she can predict you, she can't hit you.
---
Ive been calling for a bloodpoint bonus if not enough people are playing a role {killer}. This would help Q times, and Im glad to see it on here.
---
why do I care though, if you can be in denial about not having a chance you can be in denial about them being gay
---
take this from a guy that jerks off to pictures of straight guys quite a lot
---
I was playing earlier and the match was actually a good one. Everyone played well (although the matchmaking was dire 2 rank 13s, rank 12 and a rank 19 survivor Vs a rank 18 killer) killer got a fair few hooks nonetheless but everyone survived and one of the survivors starts to shit talk post game. I just told them they are being toxic and they are like how I didn't this or that and I said there's no need for the shit talking after the game. We all had a reasonable game. All GG after and then in comes this guy.
---
It's so unnecessary and breeds toxic killers. Why wouldn't a killer become toxic if they get the same post game chat regardless.
---
I don't understand exactly what you mean. Are you suggesting that we may get ballet/opera related cosmetics?
---
Unless, what it means is a season pass similar to pubg and fortnite with an increased % of shards rather than BP. 
---
If it means, spend 5 dollar for 50% more bp then they can go fu\*k themselves I quit.
---
I meant you dont get points. Big ole goose egg.
---
What I suggest is that should a killer DC on them they get that payout of free points.
---
HAD A TEAMMATE GET DOWNED IN THE FIRST 30 SECONDS OF A MATCH, THEN HAD THEM GET FARMED - TWICE! - BY SOMEONE WITHOUT BORROWED TIME, WHO THEN KILLED THEMSELVES ON FIRST HOOK BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET THEIR DELIVERANCE, MEANING WE HAD 2 PEOPLE &amp; 5 GENS.
---
ZZZZZZ
---
pretty sure Springtrap did that. But like we both said, we are not that invested int he lore of the game.
---
You should have set it to Lery's, all the walls and blind corners you could ask for
---
No, she's Bill in reverse drag
---
Everyone is mocking the killer, calling him bad or desperate or such.
---
But let‚Äôs be honest: He got a 2k by facecamping. Kinda shows that the strategy worked.
---
And it‚Äôs not the killers fault. I blame dumb survivors that don‚Äôt know how to counter a camp. They rush to save and get downed, they feed the camper, and teach these killers that facecamping works.
---
Because it continues to work for them, game after game they get a guaranteed 1 or 2 kills. Rarely do they get 0, sometimes they get 3 or 4! 
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt they continue doing it when it continues working?
---

THEY'RE BRINGING IN THE ^dying ^light
---
let my flair speak for itself
---
At this point, I no longer give any game company the benefit of the  doubt when it comes to this sort of thing. 
---
It's up to BHVR to pleasantly surprise me with a well implemented version of this and prove my pessimism wrong.  Seen too many greedy versions of this sort of thing to assume benevolence anymore.
---
I imagine it would be kinda like the crafting system in Child of Light - you take 3-4 of an item and combine it to make the next tier of that item. For example, combining 4 grey offerings to get a single yellow offering. Or combining 3 green toolboxes to get a purple toolbox. Or combining three boxes of cannibal droppings to get a jigsaw piece.
---
This was a metal print seen at my city's Comic Con.  The artist had another version where Pinhead from Hellraiser replaced Leatherface.
---
I'm sorry but I can't seem to find the artist's name at the moment. I can try again later if you guys really want to know who made this.
---
*surprised pikachu*
---
Sure.
---
If i put a survivor on a hook and camp the hell out of it the survivor is gone, game over for them the rest of the players have the disadvantage of loosing an ally. 
---
However with your idea if i camp the suit until the timer runs out the survivors are at a more severe disadvantage, not only do they loose a teammate they also have to deal with an entirely new entity into the game, an AI that will patrol the areas where they will be the most and even give them all Debuffs. 
---
That is why it is overpowered i am being rewarded for camping and abusing a system. That is why it is far more powerful than just a hook.
---
the bottom line is a bunch of agile teenagers with knives
---
I find some of the things they didn't ask about just as interesting.
---
They asked about how interested you'd be in a new licensed Killer, but **not** a new licensed Survivor or non-licensed characters of either role.
---
500 iq
---
The problem is you need the survivor to die in the suit for it to become useful. I think BHVR said they don‚Äôt want AI, but they also didn‚Äôt want a clown.
---
Billy is op?
---
Yes because he‚Äôs not jump scare with a normal terror radius.
---
getting a 4k means nothing, getting to have fun is what matters.
---
Yes, you can  4k in any map if the survivors are brain-damaged enough or the pallet-rng is awful enough.
---
Depends on which technique you want to emphasize for each killer- Like for Doctor, you could focus on preventing them from doing gens by patrolling and shocking to suss them out every time- or you could focus on finding them using tier 3 madness and aura related perks. Or for Meyers, you could build a very good Mori-focused build, or a "rip people off of gens with 0 terror radius" build. It's really difficult to answer "best"
---
we could have pamela voorhees since she wasn‚Äôt in friday the 13th the game. also we could have alice hardy as a survivor
---
I would buy it
---
I dort get it
---
I wouldn't mind but they'd have to find a way around him putting people on the hook. Maybe using magic seen as he does voodoo.
---
Would be great to get rid of all my stamps
---
Post it all, I didn't say anything nasty or childish.  I don't know those people and I couldn't care less.  I complained about your moonwalking and you complained about DS, one of those two things will be changed next week, maybe that will help you figure out which is balanced.

Repost
---
(what you want to see) + rule34 = porn
---
dummy
---
I realize that
---
I'd start with reworking her addons because things like Omegablink and extra blinks shouldn't be in the game. She's already the most broken thing in the game and addons just make her all the more ridiculous.
---
Which is the main drawback of the power to prevent it from being way too good
---
I see more survivors DCing than killers.  I might just have bad luck though
---
As a toxic survivor, I can tell you that I get my fair share of awful post game chat. You just gotta remember that they can‚Äôt hurt you. A good way to counter this is to just turn what they say into something funny. Or continue roasting them.
---
I Made this so I can send it to him for on the go
---
Why haven't the devs added any new game modes ?
---
Or if the killer is cruel or clever enough. 
---
Hahaha, telling a killer that the object of the game is to pip or double pip and not to kill is like telling a survivor the same.
---
You'd be wrong on both counts, lol. 4k is the goal, just like how getting away is the survivors. Dont be silly.
---
Carry on then
---
Am i the only one who enjoyed Shattered Bloodline's menu theme?
---
Mama huntress
---
Oh ok, gotcha. Maybe it could be tweaked to the point that the timer doesn't go down when the killer is standing within a certain radius. Do you think that would make it better?
---
as a female, Kate. as a male, can't decide between Dwight, Jake or Adam
---
Well both parts are equally toxic
---
 Ah, yes, a killer that stuffs you into a fursuit that murders you. The ultimate torment.
---
tips for trap placements for trapper? i usually put traps around shack and some random grassy spots, how do you go about setting up?
---
I always spend on bloodpoints after I get 2k.
---
Hex:haunted grounds 
---
Teachable the spirit perk lvl 35 or shrine of secrets
---
Two trapped hex totems spawn on the map.
---
If cleansed survivors suffer from the exposed status effect for 40/50/60 seconds 
---
The remains trapped is turned into a dull totem.
---
That's not the point.
---
The point is you would pay real money to change the color of an image in a game.
---
I almost always check my team mates and killer just to see who i played with/against. And in my 2300 hours in this game i can legit count the good/nice russians on 1 hand. There is nothing to ignore if it just aint there. All i'm asking for is to let russians play on asia servers cause most eu don't want them anymore. 
---
So many other game community's also ask for russians to be excluded from eu matchmaking cause of the same problems. So yeah it's a russia problem. Nothing to do with survivor bias bullshit
---
As much as I *love* Alien, I think a xenomorph wouldn't really belong in the game.
---
So make it 5/7/9. Lower tiers should still have a nice duration but not as good as tier 3.
---
No i think the ability should be removed completely.
---
Like anything that i substitutes a hook is pointless.
---
Let me use the pig as an example - Reverse bear traps slow down the game time and make survivors lives harder, i do not however have to substitute them for hooks, i do not have to carry survivors somewhere to use it, me using it will not give anyone a serious Debuff that can affect everyone.
---
In addition the main point of putting someone in a suit and then leaving them where they can't move will just increase DC's being on a hook is fine and dandy but sitting in a suit in butt fuck nowhere isn't going to be fun for anyone.
---
sorry for  being overly critical i think its an interesting idea at it's core but with DBD's gameplay flow it will not work at all.
---
What i was saying is from experience with playing multiplayer games theirs usually a dip in playerbase from around 9am-3pm est atleast my experience
---
Everything else is correct though. But yeah I specifically remember it was Noob3 not just from the YouTube video, but because I was lucky enough to watch it live on Twitch.
---
Survivors ikr
---
I assume the suits are reusable which is good but I think something similar to pigs ambush would be necessary, maybe not as strong as ambush.
---
I heared a lot of survivors say that
---
Actually the correct answer is to run both with adrenaline.  I have seen it be quite effective since 50% of killers tunnel and won't go further than 24m from their hooks and then proclaim "You unhooked him while I was there!!"
---
I'll often put them where people like to loop when I chase them. Near pallets, windows, etc. Put one in front of a chest if you see one early on. I catch someone there almost every game.
---
I play at mid-ranks, so the experience may not be the same at higher or lower ranks.
---
Yeah people tend to think that it's the same game when the exit gates are open. I usually walk away as killer since I get bored easily and want the match over but I fully expect to be camped (at least proxy camped) by the killer when I'm hooked as the exit gates are powered. Especially when people are save happy, the killer can sometimes scoop up another kill or two.
---
no wonder killer mains become ruthless after comments like this
---
You used this format so incorrectly
---
We are just joking around, chill
---
Agreed but I hate when people dont do anything. Or miss every skill check
---
Koichi is one of my fav jojo characters, change my mind
---
What rank are you?
---
Let's be real here both Nurse and Billy are the only good killers by miles so it isn't a stretch to see them as OP when every other killer is compwleting neck and neck to leave the starting line while those two finish in first. 
---
The fact that neither requires Ruin is massive.
---
And prob only get 1 kill even then rip
---
Delete this now
---
Pay me.
---
If I have the perks and add-one. I‚Äôm going to use them.
---
They‚Äôre not in the game for a player to stare at like a Funko Pop figure.
---
Him and Nurse are miles better than every other killer so yeah. They both also don't require Ruin to get a 4k in the beginning of a match.
---
My poor Funko Pops
---
I have 4 robux and 38 pence, is that enough
---
What makes you disagree?
---
Now this is TRUE horror
---
You don‚Äôt depip for leaving the lobby.
---
If they put them in our webs, why not use them? I've seen way less killers with Moris, compared to survivors with spot light bulbs, Insta heal shots, and spar parts. Likewise killers are forced to because of dailies. That means you j7st got unlucky
---
I'll consider it
---
Killers playing the game? Wtf BHVR please fix
---
Whats sandbagging? I know t-bagging, but that term is new to me. I gathered it maybe has something to do with farming?
---
Self care
---
&gt; I couldn't care less.  
---
Right, which is why you felt the need to post. Because you don't care. I hope the people reading this can understand my frustration. Why can't you guys just move on and stop making everything so personal? I just wanted to play the game. 
---
&gt;I complained about your moonwalking and you complained about DS,
---
I don't know what that is, but I wasn't complaining about DS. There's nothing I can do about it, I didn't even know they had it. 
---
 &gt;one of those two things will be  changed next week, maybe that will help you figure out which is  balanced. 
---
Which will justify your behaviors I'm sure. Stop picking petty fights man. This is a waste of time for all parties involved.
---
This sounds cool for all my mist and luck offerings
---
Love me some mirror Myers. I have the best games with M&amp;A, hex: devour Hope and make your choice. Last perk being noed/remember me usually.
---
Blocking your teammates, eg. throwing down a pallet in front of them so the killer catches them
---
I'd love a battlepass type thing for DbD!
---
I've heard of barrel chested, but box chested.... that's a new one
---
Chuck could work, hear me out. Here's just a quick mock-up of how he could be interesting/fun, this doesn't necessarily mean it's balanced.
---
___________
---
Enviroment
---
Vaulting over windows = he climbs them thus he'd be slower than the average killer
---
Movement speed = fastest in the game to make up for his poor vaults.
---
Palettes would stun him but he can also run under them at a decreased movement speed (maybe a bit less than nurse ms). He'd still be able to break palettes by stabbing at them.
---
______________
---
Interactions
---
Rather than hooks, survivors can take X amount of hits (let's say 6). When they are down to 1 hit they can heal back to 2 hits. 
---
After being hit all 6 times, they will be downed, from there chucky can sit on top of the survivor and start stabbing at the survivor. for up to 20 seconds (let's say). Another survivor can pull him off but the next time the other survivor is downed, they are killed by him.
---
**Special ability:** sit on the spot after 4 seconds, if you are within X metres from a survivor and they have seen you (this just means they could have saw you as they were moving the camera). You will have the ability to teleport behind them once they lose sight of you unless you get up, which you will get a small dead hard boost upon getting up.
---
*I've been waiting for this.PNG*
---
Thank you kind sir I blessed thee, next game you will escape with a brown toolbox, thank me later
---
I was waiting to meet a small game user. I like the perk but sometimes the constant dinging drives me insane.
---
Yeah I prob got unlucky because 3 matches in a row is crazy
---
Rank 8
---
Bruh, I had a match where I was the only guy who got a genny done, unhooked two people, one of those twice, and another survivor with a lower score called me trash.
---
I said thank you.
---
you get points. Everything you got before dcing.
---
I'd also go with strawberry blonde.  Although I think, in profile pic, it looks a bit too close to Meg's red.  In a future tinkering, I hope the Devs lighten it up a tad to match the way it actually looks in-game.
---
There‚Äôs so many more survivor mains in here though...
---
I have a few problems with this so let's start with the fact that the killer isn't very good. He doesn't have anything to help chase down survivors, or slowdown survivors, or track survivors, at least until one survivor is already dead. Agitation and Iron grasp would be almost mandatory which limits build diversity. After you do get a survivor to a suit, it encourages you to camp them. The suit ai would be very difficult to program and would probably have game breaking bugs that would never get fixed.
---
The map I feel wouldn't work because it would be incredibly difficult to make an entire map out of a single restaurant. The was a haunted factory in one of the games wasn't there? I think that would be easier.
---
If I was going to create a killer power based on FNAF, I would tie it to the puppet from 2. One music box appears on the map at the start of the game. All survivors can see the music box's aura. The music box will immediately start playing a song that can be heard globally. Survivors can rewind the music box by interacting with it. Once the song ends, the music box opens and shoots out a puppet, which will immediately move incredibly quickly in a straight line through walls to the nearest survivor and instantly kill them. The puppet will then come back to the box and it will reset itself, beginning the song again. The music box will speed up for a few seconds after the killer hits a survivor or a generator is completed. If the killer stays within a certain distance of the music box for a certain amount of time, the song will slow significantly.
---
The rewind will not be audible to the killer until several seconds after it is completed. The music box will stop playing and will not trigger once only a single survivor remains. In addition to the music box, the killer gets a dramatic movement speed boost when a survivor is not looking at them, and if they attack while a survivor is not looking at them, their lunge will be dramatically enhanced.
---
So an ability that gives the survivors a secondary objective that will consume time, which the killer won't be able to camp, that has the potential to instantly kill them. Survivors can either choose to stay close to the music box to prevent it from triggering or stay away, to ensure that they won't be next. The enhanced movement speed and lunge would give the killer unique mind games while they try to keep things in between them and the survivor making themselves more deadly but also making it so they can no longer see their prey.
---
Probably just unlucky tbh, players typically try harder the closer they are to rank 1, even though there isn't a real reward for it üòî
---
Nice. As long as people don‚Äôt take this kind of thing personally then the scum doing it are just wasting their own time.
---
I didn't mention anything about survivors hell I didn't even say the word
---
Any else thinks that it would be cool If they released both Alien and Predator as killers? They could even take this opportunity to make a 2v8 game mode that people have been asking for.
---
Oh my god that sounds AMAZINNGGGGGGG
---
Look at this urban evading baby
---
I only really play the game for fun, and I'm not that great at it. Ruin just makes the whole thing feel like a slog.
---
The question with the survs communicating with each other is very interesting. Voicecom gives swfs so many aura perks for free like empathy or bond. However i can see that survivors want to play with their friends because its really fun. I dont mind swfs aslong as their arent total Mlg dick swf
---
Definitely true. I mainly play mid-low tier killers and survivors love to take advantage of it and teabag. I still do well most games but there definitely are times where I wish I‚Äôd run billy or spirit and absolutely murder them because I know they wouldn‚Äôt be teabagging then
---
I was under the impression the a DCing survivor or killer completely forfeited points.
---
There's 4 survivors who can DC and only 1 killer.

I'd love to have a BP for DbD!

I bought this game back when it first came out, played it a handful of times then quit. I bought it since I love Evil dead and had to get Ash. Wish they would have included a deadite killer.

If this was a horror film in the slasher heydey (70's/80's), I'd give it to Laurie.  We obviously have a lot of context for Laurie's personality/history that we don't have for the other characters, but the other girl's traits are defining enough that they could be cast in other roles.

yeah, if someone is teabagging or flicking flashlights at me, i always ignore them
---
My reasons for why Plague isn't the worst killer ( she's actually around Myers in my tier list ) 
---
1. She is a 115 speed killer which have the possibility to become a ranged killer.
---
2. She is one of the few killers which can counter Mettle of Man, repet, one of the few which doesn't give a shit about MoM. That's clearly make her better than regular M1 killers.
---
3. She can also counter Adrenaline, Iron Will and Instant Heals mid chase.
---
4. She is "loopable" isn't a argument. Every killer except Nurse, Spirit and Hag with a good set up can be looped at some point. And with her Corrupt Purge, she can deal better with loops than M1 killers.
---
5. She slows down to 110% movement speed while hold her Purge. For exemple Huntress slows down to 76% and she also has more weaknesses ( 110 movement speed + 45 meters of directional Lullaby ). I still agree that Huntress is better than Plague just because Huntress doesn't need to wait for survivors to give her full power ( she starts with all her 5 hatchets and she can refill at lockers whenever she wants ) and Huntress also have infinite range on her hatchets, unlike Plague, which have a limited range on her Corrupt Purge, but she can deal with high walls loops better than Huntress, just because she is 115% movement speed and she doesn't slow down so much.
---
6. Say to Croquedead ( I know you talk about him ) that he has inconsistent arguments. How you will stealth her Corupt Purge if you are fully sick ? Because fully sick survivors constantly vomit and it's easy to spot them. Then, you need to cleanse. But the problem is that he said again that it's a bad idea to cleanse against her, because you make her more powerful. And you can't repair unsafe generators while broken, except if you have Sprint Burst ( and Sprint Burst isn't too commom nowadays ) because you risk to be done down quickly ( especially because she is a 115% speed killer )
---
7. What bugs Plague has ? I don't heard about any on them. And bugs don't define a killer. Nurse has dead zones, Hag has visual and audio bugs with her Phantasm traps and sometimes she can be blocked in her own animation of placing traps, Spirit sometimes has audio issues with her power, Huntress has issues with hit boxes ( hit boxes can with or against her ), every killer has their bugs, but that doesn't make them bad.
---
8. So yeah, she's not that bad.
---
Thanks. Wasnt sure If I was too late.
---
A++, would mulch every corn map locker i have and then some
---
Incorrect. Is supposed to start the 2nd or 3rd and run to the 6th
---
1. Whenever the game literally gives you stun points but the nurse continues blinking that's not miss timing it.
---
2.  She doesn't have to guess if you run around a corner there is two possibilites, you either double back or keep running. If you double back she'll hit you because she will always blink to the double back spot if shes good. Then if you keep running instead you cant possibly run far enough in 95% of situations to break LOS again and you will get hit from the chain blink. Even in that 5% of the time that will just extend the chase by one more blink because that is not a sustainable method of avoidance.
---
3. Baiting hits and blinks is literally just hoping the killer makes a mistake, yeah you can play in a way that maximizes your chances but against a good nurse they will not miss.
---
4. The open space part wasnt about her chase power it was about her mobility she literally has better mobility than killers like legion who's power is ALL mobility and is even better in chases, that's as backwards as it gets.
---
I think the point is to reward playing riskily; picking up yourself or teammates can often be in a low-risk situation
---
Claudette disagrees
---
lookin at this sick ass plant
---
Spirit is good too. Huntress and Hag are not bad either in the right hands. And just because Billy is strong, that doesn't mean he is OP. Strong and OP are 2 different things.
---
Except that's not true at all they dont need a base nude body especially since it's been hacked up I to 3 segments for mix and mstching
---
I'd say no to gen tapping, and personally work through Ruin for a couple reasons. One, you get better at skill checks by practicing, and two, most of the time you'll waste more time tapping than actually working through Ruin.
---
Some people take a 2 - 3 second break after hitting a good skill check to avoid hitting another one during the penalty phase of Ruin.
---
As for cleansing, I think it really depends on a number of factors, but it's always better to be in a healthy state than a sick or injured state. If your team is playing dangerously (getting close to the killer a lot), then you might not want to give her corrupt purge any more than you need to though.
---
where is this survey
---
I consider Nurse my 3rd "main", though she's my least favorite of the 3 I play a lot. 
---
I think an add-onless Nurse is "fine". It doesnt have enough map presence to be THAT bad, still by far the strongest killer and no real counterplay in chase.
---
but all extra blinks and omegablink are unfair and need to be gutted to hell
---
They said they wanted to keep a focus on the OG gameplay in an interview. 
---
In addition to this they balanced the killers around that one game mode so it would be hard to add more without some killers being ULTRA useless.
---

---
Wat
---
It depends on how they DC. If they use the in-game ‚Äòleave‚Äô option, then they lose everything. If they kill their internet connection, they keep their points and items.
---
Devs don't understand how stressful it is, we don't get a loud warning of when we have to be careful, we have to be vigilant 100% of the time to see those fucking invisible claudettes.
---
Similar to your OP, you seem quite adept at taking something out of context and manipulating it to try and make some type of point.  I don't care about the conversation. I don't care about the other survivors.  Are you with me so far?  I DO care that you post my in game name in a small segment of a conversation to support your narrative.  I DO care that you won't post it in its entirety because it would no longer support your narrative.  You already posted their names but you "care" about a flame war?  Such bullshit.  You put us in a reddit post and ask us to move on?  Not complaining about DS eh?  Post the conversation or shut up.
---
Thank you.
---
I don't understand why the progression system is not a part of the survey. It is the worst part in my opinion. It completely stops me from playing after a short amount of time because when you think "this perk combination looks really fun - I want to try it" I soon realize how much time I have to invest for that. There isn't even a choice you can make in what survivor to play since the decision is forced upon you by the perks you own on them. It is just so hard to get to a point where you can try stuff out if you have not been playing the game since launch. That's also the reason why I can't recommend anyone to start playing.
---
Crossplay? Console killers are gonna dodge if they see a Bill in their lobby lol
---
Found it on a YouTube post. You can‚Äôt copy from there
---
Insert GROOVY
---
Do I get any sympathy for using level 2?
---
I'd just prefer him to run under it, think it would look hilarious.
---
Found it on YouTube post. Cans copy from there
---
I have posted a poll to see what people think, I'll be abstaining from voting in my own poll for the sake of fairness. Hopefully a lot of people see it and vote on it. I'm considering posting it on the dbd forums too just for a wider audience.
---
I think she's fine. The only thing I think she needs is to be able to be stunned by pallets mid blink and have it interrupt her blink.
---
wow, these look terrible
---
Is this puppers locker cosplay?
---
bill overbeck is a fan favorite but he still dies and his perks aren't op.
---
Answers gonna be a solid Bill
---
Claudette self healing in a corner with mangled and miss adrenaline is useless?
---
I‚Äôm fine with voice lines and more directional/helpful emotes
---
That would be amazing. All killers/survivors before Clown/Kate need updated animations, physics, and attributes. Each of the newer chapters introduced something unique about the characters and the ones before them seem outdated as a result.
---
Clown and Kate brought jiggles. Spirit and Clown have facial expressions. Jane and Jeff have unique physiques. Legion has a male and female model. Plague and Ash talk.
---
People pay real money for shitty killers what‚Äôs your point
---
oops, combined two things in my head and typed it, my bad
---
I figure that if they could've found a way to make an automatically better version of Legion that was more fun, they would've done so in this upcoming mid-chapter patch instead of adding Ghostface
---
I was in a match with a Myers + scratched mirror in Leroy's (or however it's spelled) - and he was hilarious. I would hide, and he would always show up and stand in front of me, pretending he didn't see me. Then he would slowlyyyyy turn around to acknowledge me before he stabbed the shit outta me. I miss youuuuuuu
---
Actually, I also see Hex: Ruin as problematic right now. With Hex: Devour Hope, you need to get hooks and not camp to get any use out of it, and you only need to cleanse 1 totem to remove it. No One Escapes Death is 3 stack Devour Hope that you get for free and you have to cleanse 5 totems.
---
New level system for perks, this is botany knowledge.
---
The heartbeat is already a thing, but it doesn't change in speed or frequency currently.
---
God, I hope not. I was very disappointed with how Legion turned out. They had a killer which is actually a group of people, then decided to not incorporate that at all to their power, and instead used a rather generic power that you could have used with any number of killers. The whole thing seems like a massive missed opportunity.
---
&gt; Freddy Buff: I don't know how but it seems like it should be done.
---
Pretty sure they said previously Freddy will be getting a full rework.
---
It was and it was dead almost immediately, and has stayed dead ever since.  A lot of the purchases of the game among my friends were solely for the DBD cosmetics that it came with.
---
I understand Nurse mains being protective since they put in the extensive time that's required to get good with here, but that's not really a good argument AT ALL for leaving her as she is now.
---

That's probably why they facecamped.
---
They cant even swing properly lol
---
yes pls. I dont wanna hear a dozen back to back one liners
---
Self care doesn't need a big nerf, I personally don't run it and don't feel the need to
---
They'd probably release it on the in-game store instead and give creators a chance to make some money from their work while taking a cut of the profits
---
wait have my parents meant I'm fat when they call me unique!?!
---
Yea. I like being able to play whichever killer I want because I like playing around with their different abilities. And then there‚Äôs survivors who think they‚Äôre amazing because they can loop me as I‚Äôm only playing an M1 killer who has little ability to map control or stop loops
---
"The most famous, is never get involved with a killer that might have an insta down near the gates, but only slightly less well know is this! Never go in against a Myers at the exit gate, when a tombstone death is on the line!"
---
Punish lobby Dodging is being considered? owo
---
With a tag like "Overcharge Freddy" I can really piece that one together lmao.
---
thats so hot
---
It's hyper-prevalent. Haven't you noticed an unusual number of Claudettes despite the fact that Dwight is in a similar tier? Everyone is getting or has self-care. It's pretty common to see 4 of them. It's also the number 1 perk for survivors according to the tiers.
---
Good to hear!
---
I play meg because she was my first character to play and I only prestiged her to 2, never touched any other character because I have all the perks on meg
---
Why?
---
I like this perk! While not strong it‚Äôs definitely creative.
---
Im fine with a Rainbow style yearly pass for 4 chapters
---
Legit can't tell if it's terrible matchmaking, SWF, or some vile, twisted combination of both
---
What's the point of that, just being a dick?
---
I give up - there's no logic to your argument.  By your logic, in any competitive event, the sides should perform actions that will potentially cause them to lose the game, just to be "courteous".  Next thing you know, we'll see football games where the winning side hands the losing side the ball as a courtesy so they "have a chance" and "have fun".  Literally the worst argument I have ever heard.
---
Lery‚Äôs or Gideon Map are the best. The fact you did this on Cornfield is fucking godlike.
---
If i wear certain outfits into the lobby i get dodged.
---
If i have a certian username i get dodged. 
---
if i play a certain character i get dodged. 
---
if i load in at the same time as ANYONE else (1, 2, or all survivors) I get dodged.
---
if my rank is too high i get dodged. 
---
if i have an item I get dodged.
---
And you know when I dodge?
---
I have to go because i forgot about something important. I don't even dodge 600+ ping lobbies anymore because I just don't take them seriously and just have fun clipping around. Your'e going to die fast anyway so may as well enjoy it. 
---
If i can walk into a lobby expecting ANY killer / add-on / perk / mori combo in the game, and I stick through it, you can put on your big boy pants and not dodge for 1 second because you didn't get an ideal lobby of rank 20s. 
---
Punishing killer dodges on both sides sounds ideal to me.
---
That shit used to get you banned. Idk if it still can tho lol
---
My build is BBQ, Ruin, Whispers and Nurse's and I absolutely love it.
---
Sometimes I swap out Whispers/Nurse's for Discordance just to shake it up, but I really do think the setup I listed is the best all around build for her.
---
I've also had a surprising amount of success with M&amp;A. Turns out people don't start running away until they actually hear the heartbeat.
---
Samination is just such a musical genius
---
the peak playerbase for death garden was 1 last week.
---
&gt;Using three perks to evade the killer. 
---
Uhhh..
---
&gt;using DS in general now...
---
Yikes.
---
It was definitely camping. Anytime you hook a survivor like that and then remain on the map, it's camping. Don't worry though, it gets easier with practice.
---
That‚Äôs a huge spike for that game lmao
---
Yep. Or distracting the killer, but it‚Äôs still being a dick
---
If you're attentive enough Billy can be looped just as easily as any other 115% killer. He catches up quickly but just learn your environment and what's around you and he's honestly not that hard to play against. His snowball potential is just high.
---
Thanks a good perk not gonna lie
---
I've done it before too but they still have time to hit you if they would've landed on the other side of the pallet anyway. Ill get points but the stun doesn't actually stun them.
---
make her short blinks take a bit more time
---
'my bad' as if you couldnt stop yourself doing the full 'animation' of the 360? is it a macro?
---
We all know she boutta DC before the tombstone animation finishes.
---
good nurses will just read you like a book anyways but yeah stuff like that helps
---
The first time I got killed by a mori was the hag let's just say I was fucking confused
---
It weirded me out that it was even a question. I find battle passes to be a bit predatory
---
While it would be convenient, the whole point of the game is 4 survivors get thrown into the game unknowingly and all have different abilities. So, being able to see everything that the other survivors are taking is more like an organized raid, rather than unfortunately ending up in hell. So I'd have to disagree with this.
---
.....huh?
---
They just *gotta* have that hatch escape you know? Why risk saving your team and attracting the killer when you can just wait for your last team mate to die on the hook? This screenshot pretty much encapsulates why I hate playing Surv in a nutshell.
---
anyone else wanna be sat on by her
---
Wow, none of these arguments ever arise when promoting gentapping.  ^oop, ^I ^dropped ^my ^/s
---
What you call "dumb" essentially boils down to how you prefer to play the game.  This shouldn't have a bearing on presenting a fact to a new player.  Especially when they will need to get used to skillchecks anyway and might prefer to practice when not dealing with Ruin from an experienced smurf.
---
Exactly, if they add a battle pass that would be one of the few things that would make me never play this game again
---
It'd be just like playing Overwatch.
---
"Thank you Baptiste. Ohhh, you're welcome!"
---
It's me. I do that.
---
I think that's because the killer is (usually) the main highlight of the chapter. Like when Saw was announced, a lot more people were excited about the Pig compared to Tapp. I'm sure that if they do another licensed chapter a survivor from that movie/book/tv show will be added as well.
---
Being new to the game, someone told me that when I walked away after hooking for 2 seconds and they get unhooked right behind me, and I saw the rescued survivor run in front of me and I chased+downed them, that was tunneling (they DC'd on pickup and spectated the game telling me this afterwards).
---
Is she supposed to do a 6th gen or something?
---
I agree with you, although it can work for certain games but not for DbD. First of all, the game has way too many issues for it to even be worth buying. Second of all, the seasons are too short and the devs shouldn't focus on cosmetics and in game items.
---
Make the game perform well first, then add stuff like this.
---
^That's ^^me ^^baby
---
You realize that any character can get any perk, most people play Claudette because her model and cosmetics make her the easiest survivor to hide with
---
By the way the change that you are suggesting to self-care is already a perk in the game: botany knowledge
---
I‚Äôm guessing it would add things like x2 BP for the month
---
I beg you dead by daylight God's please
---
If you want to sorta stick to how he initially kills in the movies, all survivors for some reason have cell phones and he can activate his ability to call them and make the ringer go off.  Then the survivors have to spend time to answer the phone where they can get a voice line before hanging up.  Of course this makes it very obvious to him where the survivors are and he can have a much smaller terror radius after making the call for a limited period of time.
---
And to punish people who just ignore it entirely and never get rid of it, the clicky clicky flashlight types, make it reveal your aura if you let it go on for a full minute or something obvious where yeah you clearly aren't turning it off.
---
So yeah he's Dokkaebi but shush.
---
PFFFFFF HAAAA HAHAHAHAHA 
---
Buddy... are you serious? I depip on the regular due to killer's DCing. What's weird is sometimes i get those pips back after finding a new lobby sometimes I don't.
---
Unrelated to the post itself, is that icon part of a perk reskin pack? I'd love to know where it came from, if it is.
---
I‚Äôm a baby Dwight  but I‚Äôm not a potato
---
Very cool my dude
---
Makes me happy to see a lot of polish is on there, fixing bugs, auto reinviting friends, cross play etc.
---
Cross play would help being more players to the entire game but nurse would def need to be looked at, at that point. Same with fixing latency.
---
Well I didn‚Äôt moonwalk in this clip but yea if I had the chance I would of
---
"Murder them" lmaoooo
---
See this one and the Claudette one side by side. Hmmm I think someone had a bad match...
---
let him kill you by jumping in the hatch.
---
alternatively if you see the killer by the hatch, dont let him see you. instead go and do a gen. they wont suspect it. then you might be able to open an exit gate or leave, or just go find the hatch as the killer will have probably left
---
Haha! That would be quite the feat.. all those needles!
---
Me: *Oh a quick survey? sure im on break i can spend a little time on this*
---
**20 questions later**
---
Me: *THERES MORE!?!?!*
---
I main survivor but I play killer to farm with my boi wraith and the thing is that's what some killers think once you flashlight/pallet stun/juke in close succession or right after one or the other they think its toxic but I've found out playing as killer that it almost never is like they're just playing the game with the tools given to them cant be that upset. Now once they tbag ALOT then maybe they're a lil toxic but dont face camp regardless learn to play better, every killer match for me is practice and enjoyable.
---
We just need the last guy to quit his current job
---
We'll [most likely] never see Jason in DbD. Unfortunately :(
---
But a rainbow map with both stamps and an objective BP offering will give you a metric shit load of bloodpoints for just running around!
---
I‚Äôve always imagined a Tiffany (human body) with Chucky on her shoulder/back. So she‚Äôs the primary killer and he‚Äôs the ability. Like, she throws him and he attacks the nearest survivor and she has to retrieve him to use it again.
---
Same for me. But I think they understand that. I said I like the game, would recommend it to others, it's just bugs and other fixable issues (some concepts for dealing with rampant DCs, for example) hold it back from being as good as it could be.
---
 By bonus‚Äôs I would bet they mean blood point multipliers which means people who pay can level up faster and get more rare add ons and mori‚Äôs
---
It is crazy but it happens
---
Exactly thank you
---
I'm glad you guys collected data on people's opinions of "irritating behavior" from both killers and survivors.  I think if tweaks to the game could be made to get rid of the most offending behaviors, the game could see a surge of new players and retain them.  I have a hunch that certain irritating behaviors push away new players really quickly.
---
Cross platform would be super cool. Would help console queue times as well.
---
guess what, that's what i see 50% of the time at my rank anyway. I learned to deal with it a long time ago. it's about time killers do too.
---
Repost.
---
I'm confused, what happened :/ did they all quit?
---
Think my criteria for Nurse and Spirit is they find it easier to get another hit in a chase compared to the killers you mentioned. 
---
Never actually thought of it as a counter to first-hit killers, which sounds reasonable on paper
---
Just yesterday I looped a Myers for pretty much the entire match around Groaning Storehouse, using up nearly all the pallets. I assumed he was using Vanity Mirror since he never went to Tier 3 and I couldn't lose him, so eventually he caught me and proceeded to facecamp me. Naturally, doofus teammates didn't finish gens in time and proceeded to crouch around me. I asked him why he facecamped me, and he called me bad.
---
It's not about money. I don't want pay to win to be part of this game that's all.
---
I'd personally be ok with it if it contained it's currencies aka shards auric cells
---
I've put a not-insignificant amount of money and time into DBD, between buying every DLC and a chunk of outfits in my 1k+ hours. I've stuck through the game with all the broken patches, imbalances, and recurring problems that make it almost impossible to play a single session without game crashes, audio bugs, or other serious issues.
---
If they add something like this I will drop it in a heartbeat with no second thought.
---
I dont see killers disconnect often. I do see my teammates dc on first down almost every other game.
---
pretty sure it was a one man game
---
As long as it doesn‚Äôt do anything to give people who paid extra blood points
---
They didn't load at all and I was alone with the killer lel
---
So dope
---
yeah that would be bullshit
---
Ok, well, with the new mid chapter patch coming soon, dedicated servers are being tested in the PTB. End game collapse is also a thing now. Simplified, it's a 2 minute timer which starts when you close the hatch or survivors open the gate. If the timer is done, all remaining survivors die. The older new killer- The Legion, is also getting reworked in this patch, because they were DC central in their current state right now. The newer new killer, the plague, can vomit on you making you sick. If you're sick enough, you become automatically injured. You can cleanse yourself at a fountain, but the killer can get a powerup from the fountain that a survivor cleansed themselves in. The powerup is the same as the regular power, but you dont get sick from it, and if you touch any of the deadly vomit(let's call it that), you go down one health state. Reply for more info if you want any. Was in a hurry, so I couldn't put down all too much
---
Who is the third one?
---
Wow that‚Äôs mean
---
That's not really pay to win, but I see your concerns. The devs even said they dislike double bloodpoints because it ruins their "perk economy" or something like that.
---
Dead By Neutron
---
The MA looked like a different perk to me, I didn‚Äôt see it. Still no reason to be rude to me.
---
"expensive". Lol ok. You don't have to buy the pass or the DLCs? Like...they make it possible to buy most of the DLC with in-game money anyway. Not to mention you can get DLC perks in the shrine.  All the DLC's go on sale for under 3 dollars like every 4 months. It's not really.. "unfathomable" that someone who's played the game for years or even just a few months has all the dlcs lol.
---
yeah you're right. Spirit and nurse are about quickly downing in succession, which is why they're some of the best killers in the game, and MoM is a soft counter to that kind of killer too in a way. playing against god nurses can feel unfair but with MoM you get another chance.
---
however, MoM bullies new players as a result. it's a tough situation for sure.
---
Battlepasses should only be in free to play games. Games like black ops 4 are great examples of how to kill a franchise with bandwagon ideas :p
---
Wait that's what that was? Crap. I said yes. I thought it was gonna be something like "purchase item X from the store to have double bloodpoints for 72 hours" or something like that.
---
Exactly, I have all the DLC and a quite a few of the outfits as well as 400+ hours. Adding this would be one of the few things to make me quit forever
---
Yea I never tbag though and I still get camped for being ‚Äútoxic
---
Why fuck yourself over anyways, especially on console. You're in a hurry to leave a match and not get BP so you can sit there for a few minutes waiting to get into another match, just to do it again?
---
Yea but I still get called toxic for even though I don‚Äôt tbag
---
That's not what a battle pass is.
---
That's not p2w either
---
He wasn‚Äôt in the trailer unless you count the final scene
---
Most people well try to dodge your hatchet,wait  for them to juke back into your hatchet works 80% of the time
---
Leather face
---
That's what the Nurse/Wraiths valentines day stuff was!
---
How the hell does China have the game with all of their censorship laws?
---
With reference to the below post, **the odds of playing a game in which no survivor has Self Care is less than .1%**
---
**The odds that all 4 have it is about 50%**

BHVR if you see this - thanks for the "other" option in the gender selection. Doesn't apply to me but I know people it does apply too and it makes me happy to know you guys did that.

How so?

Yep, this is speculation for now though

Thats intresting didnt think about it that way.....

Lol someone hasn't played the ptb.

Because imagine a killer lagging around the map

Yeet

The sound when trapper places his traps and the sound of Legion's squeaky leather jacket

As a Myers main, I do love the ‚ÄúOoooog!‚Äù
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt want people to have an advantage with purple flashlights or ultra rare add ons just because people spent extra money

I would disagree, but you're entitled to your opinion. I don't think SWF should ever be normalized.
---
Dude I was the Meg üò≠
---
Why is it that we can come up with better killer ideas than BHVR? üòÇ
---
Sigh you people are just going to make this game gay.
---
At least they fucking asked unlike every other game in existence rn.
---
Why's that matter? You can already face a 4000 hour player as a newcomer as is, who cares if they add a way to skip some grind?
---
I think it would be super creepy if he just made no noise at all when stunned, he barely makes any noise in the original movie when he‚Äôs hurt. I do like the stun noise though.
---
how fucking dare you
---
this is a .png
---
because it plays into the whole horror and the killer has all the power aspect of the game.
---
like when the shape in the muscial sang the instrumantel thingy

I love how there are people in the thread being defensive about gen-rushing as if it isn't infuriating to play against.

As a killer, I get it. The quicker you get out the better, but at that point...Like...How are you going to get BP? You're not getting much BP doing rushes are you? The only thing I can think of is you either want to pip [which is really dumb] or you just wanna style on the killer. Which is...Well, a dick move. 
---
After a certain point it just doesn't make any sense to me.
---
That's probably more because a good billy is a rare find - go on twitch and check some of the killer mains that just rip people apart with him in every game
---
They're just mad it happens bro sorry to hear that continue the jukes my dude and maybe I'll see you in the fog
---
Are you actually saying that pay to win/pay to progress faster is good?
---
Sometimes. Skill checks randomness means you could get a bunch back to back or none at all.
---
Memes aside, After Infinity War being a huge success and then Endgame perfectly concluding ten years‚Äô worth of lead up, DC won‚Äôt be able to compete properly for the time being
---
Until of course Marvel start focusing on stand-alone movies (Which after Endgame now they will) DC will get their chance when the aftermath of Endgame dies down. Even then I think I prefer Marvel simply because you often genuinely see character development happen
---
All of Trapper's SFX. Small Game.
---
When the hex totem breaks.
---
The killer wasn‚Äôt that good. They would appear to attack you if you got on a generator with another survivor, but they would quickly lose chase after you got off the gen. After the third time of trying to partner up and getting attacked, everyone split up and that‚Äôs what happened. I think the only reason why the generators popped so quickly was that there were a couple of gens already started by me and a Dwight as we kept trying to do gens together and got attacked.
---
i agree with u, also, some survivirs cry because i dot let them escape throw hatch,i always have to remember them that im not on their team
---
I've literally seen streamers get looped with Billy like any other killer. I have my games with Billy where I 4k really quickly, I also have those games where I run into good survivors and they rarely let me get a chainsaw off.
---
Ah so being good at surviving, yes I get face amped by many spirits this way as well
---
I‚Äôm thinking they‚Äôll go for battle pass exclusive cosmetics, if they do it.
---
how do I slow down the game better as killer? the moment I hit around rank 12, the games skyrocketed in terms of "difficulty". By the time I manage to catch a survivor, they'll have 1-2 gens done, and be able to unhook them and start another before I can continue with that momentum.
---
Also is there really no way to update my PTB save? I'd love to test and try everything, but I have essentially no progress on that save, and I don't care to grind out **again** when I don't even have everything on my **main** account/save.
---
You get less great skill checks.
---
When piggy gets stunned. Very cute. Otherwise trapper setting down traps or when the doctor hits a person with electroshock
---
Who‚Äôs that guy on the far right? Never seen him before. 
---
/s
---
I just wish they would improve the base of the game such as more stealth mechanics, more fun things to do other than run the killer, new gamemodes and reworking the game feel to make it feel as fast as it used to be.
---
Yea, I don‚Äôt get mad about it, just put it as a title cause i did end up getting face camped lol but yea camping just happens something u can‚Äôt control
---
if you're with a SWF/team you can trust, it might be safer to just stay injured.
---
Really though, she can make you injured and broken even without her buffed power, so it's not nearly as big of a deal if you do want to/feel more comfortable cleansing.
---
I only dodge if it's something like a 4-man SWF all with flashlights and toolboxes. Or someone has .tv in their name. Typically these are the types of survivors who will be able to loop you the entire match, sabo the hooks right in front of you, bring instaheals, teabag you at the gate, and then shittalk you on stream and in post-game chat.
---
I dodge because I don't want to have to put up with that.
---
I'm dissapointed by how it turned out
---
If M&amp;A is before distressing in his loadout, its 30m TR with no chase and 50m TR in chase. Works pretty well with doc imo
---
I have a few Streamers i watch here and there but only one of them comes to mind when i think of a really good Billy (and killer in general) i can't even remember a game of him as Billy where he didn't 4k.
---
Console players, it's been almost 5 months since they said there would no longer be an optimization patch and that it would be an on going process and still nothing has been done to improve gameplay on console. Please leave a comment at the end of the survey about how unsatisfied we are with them not keeping their word and continuing to ignore parts of their community. Hopefully, since they're supposed to actually read their survey answers and comments, they'll actually work on optimizing 2/3, about to be 3/4, of the platforms this game runs on.
---
Yup I get face camped also when I flex with some moonwalking converting into a 360
---
Of course it's infuriating to play against. It isn't the survivors' faults though, they're just doing their objective. It's on BHVR for letting the game just exist like this.
---
30% longer, that means in order to make it worth it you'd have to miss 6+ hex skill checks. If you're new to the game and bad at skill checks I suppose it's be better, but 30% is a long ass time
---
Fun playing with you too! :)
---
Why you bulli me?
---
It's holding down M1 on a generator for a few seconds so that the generator doesn't give you a skill check. Some people do it when there's Ruin so they don't have to deal with skill checks
---
It's a little weird, but I like the sound of repairing generators.
---
Aww, not a poor Dweet! ): 
---
My condolences. &lt;3

Yes same, I've bought every killer with cash, because I believe the devs deserve it, and I've thrown 10 here and there for an outfit I really like, that being said I will stop playing this game if they put a battlepass in it. I know that doesn't matter because I've already spent my money, but I believe the devs would be putting their game on a hook and facecamping it, if they add a battlepass. Likewise if they add gestures I imagine that they will turn their game into a bugged mess with their big plate of spaghetti code that their small dev team has made.
---
remember me can't be turned off though and tbh i find it more powerful then the chance to hit a person
---
On the flip side NOED only activates at the time when the exit gates are powered and unless you have high mobility it is maybe one more solid kill.
---
I'm not really sure what you are saying here. You say that the killers abuse their connection as killers and more often play toxic as killer. But that survivors are ok.  
---
You say Russian players are usually better at the game but that is based on what? If we are talking killers then according to you they aren't better but just abuse connection more and play a more toxic playstyle.  You are all over the place with this. Also sure their are nice and normal russian players but the bad ones gravely outweight the good. Should the rest of eu get punished by getting put into matchmaking with russians? Rather not. Let Asia deal with them
---
In comparison he definitely looks OP. He isn't but the results he and Nurse can get at their peak is enough to claim that they are OP.
---
Good find that's pretty cool
---
I didn't say survivors don't DC but killers do when they're getting owned. Same with survivors getting tunneled
---
Subreddit for all leaks:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/)
---
I mean, you get 5k for escaping? All other points counts on the killer doing stuff and if they aren't, get out quick for some decent bp/time and try the next game
---
I was in a match against Legion where the P3 Claudette didn't mend herself. After the second time she downed herself, I'm pretty sure the killer just used her for bait. She legit went down while Legion was chasing other survivors across the map 5 times.
---
DBD is not a competitive game. Not only is the in game ranking system not an accurate gauge of player skill, the one tournament they held was a shit show at best. 
---
Before DBD can be considered a competitive OP and UP killers would need to be way more balanced.
---
Please everyone should be agreeing for Colorblind settings and just more accessibility options in general.
---
I was talking about puppers in the above statement. Not you.
---
The sound of a gen blowing as a surprise a survivor as the spirit :p kidding aside I like that little finger flicker that Freddy does :)
---
More like the killer has all the power cause he is host.
---
I doubt it‚Äôs what you mentioned, the host should be able to see things like who joined the game and their ping.
---
Dont run totems on Freddy, and yeah the exit gate thing does suck I agree. I put him mid tier, not higher, because of that and the fact that meta perks cuck him more than any other killer.
---
I RELATE TO THIS SO MUCH OMG
---
A survivor that disconnected lmao
---
No it's not
---
I forgot how bad progression was until I started wanting to play myers and realized I need a couple million BP to get my perks again.
---
Yeah I agree, they‚Äôd have to start by balancing the game a bit better. I wonder what the best way to do that is?
---
Did anyone really want this? I‚Äôm pretty sure any mention of chucky has been a joke considering his height
---
Yeah I agree, to make the game more competitive they‚Äôd have to start by balancing the game a bit better. I wonder what the best way to do that is?
---
Look at the other comments, some people really want him
---
survivors running mettle of men with bt, ds/dh and adrenaline. with instaheal medkits.üòÇ
---
A friend of mine had it for a week or two and got banned xD
---
A 20% regression you'll actually get to use is preferable to a 25% regression you need to give up chases to make use of.
---
Yeah, I haven't actually seen any kill rate stats since her buff, and she was very weak before. I wouldn't be surprised if Wraith is doing better than her now.
---
^^What ^^now?
---
You‚Äôre aware that you‚Äôre making wild assumptions about my personality based off of me having a bad day and deciding ‚ÄúFuck this,‚Äù and punishing nobody but myself, right? I‚Äôm not DCing because of a Billy/Nurse/Legion, I‚Äôm DCing because I‚Äôm not having fun in that match being tunneled. If I lose bloodpoints and a pip, that is my problem, not yours.
---
Fair enough, I'd probably do the same in your position. No idea why you're getting dodged so frequently.
---
I see a p0 claud on that bus, dont expect those pallets to last long.
---
Yikes bad luck. Tell your friend to at least appeal and explain the situation. They may let them off with a warning as long as all the matches they were in we're legit and wasn't doing any glitches they maybe didn't tell you about lol.
---
You can't remove collision with the sounds so screwed up. You leave her alone!
---
Would be funny if chapter 13 killer is Jason.
---
I just scream PEBBLE PLAYS! While laughing hysterically. My favorite is throwing one at a locker, the killer coming buy and checking said locker. Oh boy it‚Äôs a survivor bamboozle!
---
Put a rank 20 logo next to it.
---
Prolly because a lot of killers haven't figured out that survivors loading in at close to the same time =/= swf. But that's just my guess.
---
"Punishes chaining pallets without stunning as they're more valuable and there's less of them" The pallet change is bad. there is already not that many pallets to begin with, this change will only be decent if you are running a 4 man SWF were everyone knows what they are doing, the pallet break thing is dumb bc bloodlust is legit already a counter to that (and the fact that the killer will just be able to force blood lust 3 and force the survivor to vault over and over)
---
PLEASE don't Change WGLF it works and with the match reworks where you get like no bloodpoints otherwise it's the only way to get decent bloodpoints.
---
Umm just seems like a variation of the pebble... it's not a bad idea. Just not valuable. Killer mains will cry some more.
---
I see like &lt;5% of the comments wants him and the rest are jokes and hypotheticals but yea
---
Try screaming GET PEBBLED, BITCH - it‚Äôs so invigorating. And my favorite way to bamboozle the killer is to throw it into the shack. They go NUTS searching for nobody lol
---
Honestly in this kind of game? It doesnt make a difference. If i really wanted to i could face New Players who just started with a full loadout and dozens of flashlights in reserve. It would be no different if a new player had those options except they wouldnt know how to do what we do
---
oh and billy does not need a nerf at all, he is the killer that is in the best place rn tbh, all that i would change with him are some of his addons and Phantom saw
---
Yes... I am interested but not in the typical Fortnite or Apex battle pass way. Have these be monthly rewards that we have to play to unlock and earn before each monthly rank reset. 
---
Goals like that is what keeps me playing the other games mentioned, especially if the items are nice. If the "pass" offers BP XP boosts or a offering pack of 5 random offerings (example), I'd be down with that as I am trying to P3 everyone right now and the grind is real lol
---
I agree for all of it, except gen rushing. 
---
That‚Äôs just the goal.
---
The sound of a dying Claudette. :^)
---
It's the damn autoaim!
---
Main problem with this is that he was barely even chased, the nurse was chasing everyone else the whole game, so I can't really comment on how well the nurse was playing, but the one time she did fall for the just running towards her trick which doesn't inspire much faith in her skill, that's not something good nurse's really fall for, in the end she got the hit anyways though because of the extra chain blink. Also the nurse didn't have max level ruin either, which while isn't hard evidence she's not very good does show the player hadn't contributed a great deal of blood points into her yet.
---
Wait, can anyone who doesn't have all the DLC confirm this?
---
Yeah, but I could swear it changes in sound.
---
And...? You don't need the dlc to be good. There's plenty of decent perks that come with the came. They go on sale so consistently there's no point in buying it full price unless you can easily afford it. A cosmetic season pass wouldn't hurt anything.
---
Did you check if they were running slippery meat by any chance?
---
They should just move Amanda over to the survivor side where that thing belongs :p I don't want her amongst the ranks of killers
---
I have always been of the opinion that if you are going to fuck me over that you at least do so after asking. 
---
BHVR, true gentlemen of a company UwU
---
Its actually weird people are suggesting DH, I run Self care and botany and i heal super fast, DH is honestly one of the worst exhaustion perks just bc how inconsistent it is. Bring BL if you want a good exhaustion perk
---
\*shit
---
Lol. What is ‚ÄúGen Rusing‚Äù?
---
I'm well acquainted with fungoose. I cannot count on one hand the number of games he's dced after I down him once, or even before then, and from what I've seen of him elsewhere he seems like a general punk.
---
That isn't to say that I think he's wrong though, he's obviously skilled, and I think he has the right idea about ruin. I've played without ruin for a long time and not felt that it's as necessary as people say, I prefer running perks like Butcher instead of it just because they're more interesting to me.
---
Devs need to make some clothes harder too see, while making other clothes easier to see.  
---
  
---
It's dumb how P# claudette is practically invisible in some places.
---
Same. I already paid for the game. I'm not buying a battlepass
---
It's best not to give those people attention, odds are they're looking to find fault for circumstantial misfortunes and you're just trying to play the game. I'm sorry that you had to deal with that. Just laugh it off, the game has more than its far share of memeworthy moments.
---
The little thumps of cloaked wraith's feet walking by
---
What the hell is that FOV?
---
How is it pay to win? I'd but a cheap, emphasis on cheap battlepass to avoid this terrible fucking grind.
---
Wow
---
Think about that, a killer who's base mobility is twice of the survivor's.
---
im sorry if you have a different experience but the truth is, as someone who plays 50/50, i rarely have killers DCing on me.  That's just my experience, i should probably edit my previous reply.
---
That‚Äôs a problem with the grind and spending more money isn‚Äôt a good solution
---
Put tinkerers on top of that and you've got a super good time! Learn to counter it, if you see him pick someone up and head for a hook, then hide in a locker, it blocks bbq
---
She is the 2nd best killer imo,  but she can take some time to truly learn. Just play her if you think she is fun regardless if you win or lose and you will improve over time.
---
But for the sake of reality Cenobites are basically Clerics in DND with BDSM themed spells. For all intents and purposes he is basically God powered including the ability to just open up gateways with ease, high strength, super fast reflexes and more. 
---
The only issue I have with fully spiritual killers is how the fuck do you even make a power for pinhead?  Do you just lose your flesh over time or something?
---
Snitches from Shadows are not really useless, it's just that there are so many better alternatives
---
I mean, I felt like he was, but unless you're an Evil Dead/AoD fan, you'd be buying him for the perks. 
---
Mettle of Man is his best and most controversial perk. It basically gives you a free hit if the killer has hit you 3 times previously with their regular attack. There's a bit more to it than that, so I'd recommend reading up on it on the wiki.
---
The other two perks are anti-slugging perks, which are very situational. I run Flip Flop from time to time, but almost never run Buckle Up anymore.
---
LOL!
---
Wait ... I should laugh harder
---
LMAO!!
---
I know to hide in lockers, I'm just relatively annoyed with how much I have to do it.
---
Everyone is welcome aboard the magic loop bus, even if you are a total potato
---
It is a significant time, hence it doesn't completely negate the Ruin perk as so many people seem to claim it does.  However you're wrong about 6+ skill checks.  Read the description in the linked youtube video.  It's only 3.2 missed SCs.  
---
Gentapping is a move that still provides progress at a 'Dying Light' penalty rate (if done correctly).  It's the correct move in many situations, including co-op generator tapping.
---
lol the - "Would you like a battle pass" question. NOPE NOPE AND NOPE
---
Yea I got the impression they'rw considering a battle pass, which I'd cool with.
---
Do you think DBD will get crossplay with dedicated servers?
---
I want the game fixed and operating smoothly for 6-9months before they ever decide to implement a battle pass reward system. BhVR has a bad track record of releasing even the smallest update or items and it gums up the whole game with bugs or glitches, and some of those they built right into what they had already like the prestige glitch or making the intro music ear rape loud when it should have gone thru quality control before hand to correct. Unless they sent it to Deaf Jeff‚Äôs desk and he passed it, lol!
---
I know where you're coming from, I just don't care if you left because you got fussy. Leaving in general is just stupid and toxic
---
Elder gods? A magic fucking 8 ball more likely.
---
*angry Huntress noises*
---
I have a lot of fun with her and I've had more good games than bad games with her so far. Definitely worth the purchase in my opinion.
---
As a dweller of lockers a person may be lead to believe you rather enjoy it :p
---
Same lol
---
?
---
Yep. "IF, and this is totally hypothetical....but IF a new game were to come out.....how can we advertise it, errr, how do you normally find out about it...?"
---
My biggest issue with it isn't a battle pass idea but that we'd likely have to pay for it. Make the items mentioned above in game rewards instead! 
---
People are BEGGING for some sort of reward system and yet BHVR wants to charge us for a pass to get some extra rewards? Hell naw. 
---
Just implement it as seasonal rewards to unlock to keep us playing. Plus, they if want $$ (as they do) they could make an extra store tab where you can buy past rewards in if you didn't unlock them or didn't play the game at that time.
---
nah u need bbq and chili ruin and maybe enduring atleast
---
*Also kinda* !?!?!?
---
Excuse me but the range is EXACTLY the same as Amanda except he can zoom across the map faster and more stealthily
---
It would also split the playerbase
---
It's fine. And it works since I will suicide like a bodyguard for my team.
---
Evil pizza killer
---
Lol Ive come across someone with the psn Hex:Depression
---
Pfft, I guess
---
F rank killer POG
---
but Freddys power is literally just wallhacks :o
---
With Ruin up, a great skill check is +/- 0 seconds and a good skill check is -7 seconds (-4 seconds of progress plus 3 seconds of progress freeze). Gentapping adds *about* 20-25 seconds.
---
So the rule of thumb here is "three (or four) strikes you're out." Hitting all greats is the same as not having any skill checks at all, every good you hit is -7 seconds, so no matter how many greats you hit 3-4 goods per gen means you probably would have done better gentapping.
---
I actually have no idea what the average number of skill checks per gen is. I think I'm going to start counting from now on everytime I solo a gen uninterrupted. It's super random, sometimes you get none the entire gen, sometimes you get three back to back in the first ten seconds.
---
As a mostly solo player, I'd LOVE some more emotes for communication. Besides pointing and beckoning to follow. A good "stop!" would be nice at this point.
---
That doesn't mean no at all, at least not to me. Perhaps she cannot disclose that information and that's why she is simply stating that people have been asking for it? In any case we will see what the future holds for us.
---
I do it because of this and the fact that the match should be over but the survivors are just gonna tbag and bm for as long as they can just to make my life miserable
---
I actually like starting over on new survivors. If I didn't I'd probably still be using the same crutch perks I started using and never trying anything new. 
---
Probably the same reason I like limited formats in card games. I just like trying to do my best with whatever random stuff I happen to have.
---
I don't even mention good/meta perks to anyone that I show the game to. I let them learn it on their own.
---
and here we have the 23943rd screenshot of this type this month
---
If they added something juicy like 5th or 6th perks for limited time so we can talk. 
---
This will screw up f2p and give p2w advantages, but I‚Äôm gonna pay for it cuz why not!
---
this is amazing!
---
Interesting, Charles is just your average killer but his ability is that you can switch control between his body and the Doll.
---
They asked about how much people want crossplay in the mid chapter survey so it seems like they‚Äôre considering at least, I‚Äôd say the main issue would be Bill and how he translates over to consoles.
---
oh wow didnt know it was THIS easy to replace the icons xD; or i would have done it a while ago
---
aw dammit you beat me to it
---
I've had this glitch about 10 times now. I have no clue what caused it, but it's annoying as fuck
---
Right now, Ormond is bad for all killers due to the issues with auras.
---
For the Huntress specifically, any map where it's easy to lose line of sight due to a tall building or structure is unfavourable. Ormond has the large resort in the middle which can prevent long hatchet throws.
---
Ormond is a good shaped map for the Huntress though, as she has a slow movement speed, and the generators spawn in areas of the map that she can access more quickly than some of the more elongated maps.
---
Hilbilly.........
---
Bro we just got Ash ..
---
What about 15%? 20% seems still too high for something the killer gets as tokens. 25-20 is a total of about 4 seconds of solo gen time difference. 25-15 is about 8 seconds. Still not huge but makes more sense since it‚Äôs a token system
---
ooooor only cosmetics
---
I love it and hate it at the same time.
---
The True First Ghostbeater*
---
I'd be fine with it, I play the game enough to justify it and would be happy to support the devs.
---
Millions of us pay for i game cosmetics that add nothing to gameplay what so ever ? In fact some of us actually pay for killer cosmetics we can‚Äôt even see as we play in first person. ?
---
That's what I voted for
---
Great argument. Enjoy the pig "nerf" in the next patch.
---
Comment just below yours.
---
she is too thicc for this game
---
Its a sign you should stop playing the most toxic broken killer in the game
---
Freddy IS the nightmare. Does no one watch the movies anymore?
---
Did you use a coat hanger for the end there?
---
Without zooming in, it looks like that doctor perk where your use item consumption faster in terror radius
---
Which is why he said that they should embrace it and actually make money off of it.
---
I mean really. Are survivors meant to run laps around the map for the first 5 minutes? What besides gens should they be doing?
---
Very nice, as per norm.
---
You played through Spirit, congrats!
---
Gen rushing really only exists in 4 toolboxes/bnps and prove thyself I've come to find out as I've grown as killer - learn to shorten/give up certain chases and pressure gens
---
You damn know it.
---
The new system offers Killers nothing and demands they take several nerfs to accommodate it. It‚Äôs a terrible deal.
---
They definitely were, and I definitely will not be buying it after my experiences with them and DBD.
---
You said 30% slower which is why I said 6 skill checks. If I'm not mistaken that still checks out, but you might be right, but I don't like the idea of gen tapping, part of the game is dealing with those skill checks.
---
FYI this is all imo. I'm not saying one is better than the other, cause I guess it really is situational
---

And yes, I wasn't able to cut the picture down to just one, so into Paint, because I am a poor son of a b#tch. And I did this, because why not. And as with most of my uploads, just ask for a template, if you for some reason want this picture for urself, idk why you'd want it, but yeah, just ask. Who cares? Not even 0,2% of the population is gonna see this, not even 0,1%, why even bother typing this? I guess this is how insignificant my life is... Uhm, yeah, spread the love, #SupportFreddyDBD

That might've been me. Not entirely sure. What were his cosmetics?

There's nowhere to find your win-loss record right? Heck, I'll take my 1k before I ever DC üòÇ
---
Broski you could have cut it down to one in paint. If you want to be fancy download gimp. It's free and it's pretty handy.
---
&lt;3
---
This was created during a Rockstar-induced burst of energy at 4 AM, glad it is acceptable, lol
---
Yeah been having this a lot. A lot of survivors will run straight to infinite loops knowing fully you cant catch them there.
---
The most toxic? Is she really the most toxic?
---
Prob was that I got a white background, but thanks for the advice with Gimp
---
Can‚Äôt even have hatch lol. Three person game with only one gem done
---
The hatch opening close to me when I was still looking for it
---
&gt;I highly doubt that players are picking Claudette for camoflague and we're not talking top tier play.
---
What? That's literally the reason why people play Blendette. To blend in.
---
Yeah I'd rather they fix the existing bugs and queue time before adding new features.
---
Had a huntress use the insta down Hatchets because three of us swapped into sweaters and she thought we were SWF. Jokes on her though because we weren't at all a set or coordinated and one of us DCed and then the rest of us got destroyed! Ha! And she thought she was going to show that pesky SWF! She probably got showed up so bad by us and that's why she mercifully gave the last survivor the hatch!
---
For me, it‚Äôs better than wretched shop.
---
*around and around and around we go...*
---
But you know that's never gonna happen, cuz most players are from western side of Russia if we talk about latency with Asia
---
What do you mean white background? You open the image up and you get the white so you use the copy selection tool which is on the header by itself away from the tools you do a ctrl c then a ctrl v then you use the points on the edge to resize. Gimp is actually more tedious to do the same thing with but it's way more powerful once you are familiar with it.
---
yeah I choose the same, check the section when they recommend rework ranking system  and players stats and among other cool stuff too
---
I do this sometimes with hooked Survivors, then look up at them.

Though as a disclaimer I only run an Ebony Mori if I'm pissed off, to complete a daily, or to prove a point, as is the case with the majority of killers at my rank. Killing you by getting hooks is far more lucrative and fulfilling and we know the Ebony Mori is unbalanced bullshit. Trust me when I do speak for the majority on that.
---
There is a time and a place for killers with mobility. Every game is not that time, and every killer is not going to be in that place.
---
Was playing my Bill, like I do and managed to get the other two survivors out. Killer had it out for the Ace, but I got him out with borrowed time and help from a Dwight who took a hit for him because the killer wouldn't let up.
---
I got downed in freeing the Ace, and lucked out by finding the hatch that was just a few feet from me.
---
Being able to dismantle crappy add on to make better add ons would be helpful
---
Whats wrong with a battle pass i get it its not very original but its a pretty good system to reward players for playing
---
If it's cosmetics and materials for the craftable system they mentioned in the survey I'm all for it. Might be one if the only ways I would spend money on skins.
---
Ovb how they care about monetizing and keeping it financially maint in the long run.

---
I dunno about the Night King himself but I‚Äôd really like to see an ice based killer.
---
Maybe they make the ground slippery so survivors running for the window just end up sliding past it or they make cold traps which slow survivors the longer the stand in it.
---
No thanks.
---
If they add a battle pass I‚Äôll die
---
im going to see that everytime now xD
---
MoM DS DH and Adrenaline is the best build to get second chances. However against billy/nurse/huntress (the most used killers) it pretty much does nothing.
---
[Here, use those](https://imgur.com/KilCZX5)
---
All good, not trying to start arguments on one being in a worse state than the other, since both could use an overhaul honestly. For instance, if you perform actions that go towards an emblem, it should be RIDICULOUSLY easy to pip but the penalty should be based on time spent achieving that action. This would go a long way to demote camping (as a killer, wasting time standing there would hurt sacrifice points) and looping (as a survivor, being chased means you aren't getting away per se, so you should lose points). And as a precursor to gen rushing for the objective pip, gens should take much longer to complete (perhaps 3-4 minutes per generator) so the game also feels more balanced towards actually getting a sacrifice as a killer. Add this to the endgame collapse, and everyone would have a potential "out" from longer games due to increased gen repair times.

Facts don't care what one likes or opines.  They are tried, tested, and confirmed.
---
The only thing I'm presenting are facts.  And you are mistaken, (which you would know if you looked at the video's description *as I suggested*) because it's 4 seconds + 3 sec progress freeze.  So each good Ruin SC is an effective 7 seconds.  At 23 seconds, that's 3.2 good skillchecks.

---
I'm not really "all over the place", I just don't think in absolutes like you seem to do, which I find to most of the time not reflect reality. From my experience, personal and second-hand, I do find Russian players are more likely to play in certain ways - ways that are usually considered "unfun" or "unfair" - but that doesn't mean every Russian is likely to.
---
My impression that Russian players are usually better at this game is based on playing with and against Russian players, as well as watching Russian player streams and tournaments. While I think tunnelling and camping are not inherently "toxic", but viable tactics, I do agree that they do not require skill - they are usually done to secure the win, which I'm not necessarily a fan of either, especially seeing as how you can win against many groups of survivors without using those "unfun" tactics, but when I say these players are good, I'm talking about chase skills, both as killer and survivor. They are more difficult to catch, and more difficult to kite, on average. And the best players I've played against in my region are mostly Russian players. I would not want to miss that, even though yes, their host latency advantage can be a little annoying when player survivor (on the other hand, you get to enjoy that advantage playing killer, besides, dedicated servers should get rid of host latency advantage anyway).
---
Why don't they put those hypothetical bonuses and rewards into the ranking system instead? Maybe even have Devotion actually do something too? Implement that leaderboard they brought up over a year ago and put them into that? Just a thought.
---
I said I would not recommend to new players for this very reason. Progression is too time consuming with this many characters to allow someone new to fully experience the game
---
The thing is they aren't going to do this if we dont want it. I'd gladly pay for a pass though that gives me cosmetics. They're so many of them and they can be expensive to buy just one new outfit for each person.
---
Honestly, as long as you don't mind losing all the BP over it, more power to you.
---
Are you kidding or not? Because I think most people who play DBD know who Jason is
---
the community is by far the downfall of this game. stop caring about what people say in the post game lobby. don't even stick around for "gg" you risk getting exposed to nothing but hate and suicide encouragement from everyone else in the lobby. just leave or play with friends and still leave immediately because you never know with the killer it's a mixed bag of either "kill yourself" or "lol im so good"
---
I only want voice lines under two conditions: they stay out of the actual match's, like Ash's, and they read out their quotes on their quotes whenever you choose that perk.
---
Yup its for real
---
You wouldn't mind queueing into one of my games when you do, would you? I could hook you to help you along.
---
Yeah but what's the point. We ain't pipping unless we farm in that situation. Its just a lack of empathy imo. Idk if it made him feel like a big bad killer or what.
---
god fucking dammit! ARGH!
---
LOL Dwight mains will do scummy things to save their own hide. Meg usually helps you and patch you up.
---
I don't want you to do anything for me ffs. Do you actually wanna talk or just patronize people?
---
The only reason i think in ''absolutes'' is cause my experience with russian players( killers and survivors) is that 95% of that has been bad. 
---
We have different experiences with russians. Let's leave it at that. 
---
I just wish russia would get their own servers for the latency and also for the reason that pretty much anyone i know and play this game with has poor experiences with russians. So giving them their own servers would be beneficial to all.
---
From most of the games i play that is a hard thing to do altho i have no clue why but it might be that even the russians think other russians aren't that fun to play with
---
I guess he really thought he wouldn‚Äôt lose a pip if he killed you lmao
---
Even when I play as killer I usually let the survivors farm during 2men games, some killers are extremely greedy and they gotta stroke their ego u know?
---
That's not really a surprise to me. What's new?
---
Fate has decided
---
this exact thing happened to me the day before yesterday, i love the trapper and i just had enough, no more M1 ez baby killer, from here on out its 100% nurse.

I would totally buy Koichi if they added him as a Survivor
---
I dont really get the Hate for BP's.
---
Isn't it just a way to give Players an incentive to work for over a predefined period of time? 
---
And in most cases its not ever really expansive and makes for some nice Rewards to claim for just normally playing the Game. 
---
Also having like extra Rituals as Quests or some cosmetic/Perk/BP rewards wouldn't hurt.
---
I think the sound Pig makes when you complete the ambush bar (so not the lion roar when you're charging it) sounds really badass. A very subtle rawr. ;)

Yeah I know. I was a killer like that until I actually started playing survivor and i really learned how the dynamic between the two is. Oh well. I dont run into many understanding killers but that wont change me from being reasonable.
---
Huntress mains: how many years did it take you to throw 1000 hatchets?
---
I just saw endgame, and it was pretty good, but there were a few weird things.
---
I thought it was strange how the Russo Brothers decided to render Thanos‚Äô erect penis in such vivid detail. The veins were so perfectly done I couldn‚Äôt even tell his cock wasn‚Äôt real.
---
Another thing I found weird was when Black Panther broke the fourth wall and gave the audience the n-word pass. I did appreciate it, but it would feel more in place in a Deadpool movie.
---
They could have trimmed down some of the action scenes if they really wanted to keep that 18-minute Captain America rant about why there should be a White Panther. I liked the callback to how they established in Infinity War that Thanos is a flat earther. It was a nice easter egg for true Marvel fans during that scene when he cracked the Earth's space dome to prove there was no sun
---
Overall, it was still excellent, but I think that they definitely need to reconsider some things.
---
She doesnt one shot, she slows down to slower than 110 when charging, only going to 110 when fully charged (which is still slow as fuck), survivors not cleansing means your power is gone, and one health state is enough to gen rush. An apple can give you corrupt purge as well, but its only one fountain, and having corrupt at the start means you cant get anyone sick.
---
Shes no where near top 5 IMO, bottom 5 for me.
---
Ideally yes, but unfortunately the service BHVR uses to host these servers is amazon's "GameLift", and they don't have datacenters in Russia at all. Not even Eastern Europe.
---
Jason: infact, forget the game!
---
New to the game, is the blood web somewhat predictable?, it seems if I avoid purchasing the perk it will be the same perk the next level of the blood web.
---
I'm still waiting for the sequel, [u/ZombieHuggerr](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZombieHuggerr)

For trapper I say let him be like hag where he Carry's a bunch of traps right away and has a maximum of 10 which he can restock at lockersike huntress.
---
However he can only have 10 traps active at once

This is like breaking the non spoken rule between killers and survivors. A line was crossed here.
---
I agree! I actually made this for legion.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmOtRIDPep8
---
I think its pretty naive to assume that this isn‚Äôt purely talking about skins for characters so there is no way for it to be pay to win. People like you just like to freak out and circlejerk.
---
The point is that Ash is a full blown character, not just some side character in a horror movie. In horror movies, the main character is often the killer/monster, with the other people just being tools that the killer uses to scare the audience.  
---
Like, not many people actually care about Tapp or Quentin, they are just there so that the killer has someone to kill.
---
The game as it is right now is basically a pay to win game without the actual paying to win. The grind is already there, the only thing a battle pass can do is make it easier on you.
---
Goodbye, No ones gonna miss your salt.

Even worse, watching content creators cleanse totems
---
You're right, lol.

I have part of the script written, but I got stuck at a point.

I'll get it before Day 100.
---
You should also try using sloppy butcher and try to hit as many people as you can, you'll be surprise how Survivors wants to stay healthy
---
I understand what you mean but paying money shouldn‚Äôt be the solution to grinding that is way too intense and unenjoyable.
---
It's obvious you've never played as survivor if you think the only reason players facecamp is spite toxic survivors.
---
Thank you very much, ill start practicing.

Okay, I can wait until then.

Also I figured, I was asking if I could take my progress from the live game, and move it to the PTB, since my progress on the PTB is landed at a solid total of 898 bp, with 7 levels in trapper, and nothing else.

No problem

only if you leave the game. Not if you remove the plug.

Thanks to the fucked hitboxes yeah, but not OP.

Poor dweets.

Lol you paid 20 dollars for the game already, which took a lot of people, including artists, years to make. Now you want to pay a fraction of that for someone to drop a different color into an icon with the bucket tool.

Maybe not on his own but if compared to mid to low tier killers it is OP in some peoples opinion
---
that chivalry is dead
---
When I play killer, sometimes I notice a survivor enters the broken state. What can cause this besides no mither and the plag?
---
I, Dwight Fairfield, have a dream.
---
If it would only add cosmetics, skins, custom animations (like repairing gens, rescuing from hook, moris), and other aesthetic changes then its all good. Double BP bonus would also be welcome.
---
So this is where our paths divide.
---
OP has made quite a few perk Icons, if you look at his previous posts. can't wait to see what else he makes to be honest.
---
The Clown has a santa outfit....
---
some of these questions got me exited about the future of the game
---
Don't be so sure. All it takes is a survivor to dc and then it suddenly becomes a lot harder. Two dc's and the toxic killer has effectively won with little effort.
---
Even though I like that idea cause it sounds cool, isn‚Äôt there an addon for that that allows you to see what box survivors are on for 6 seconds?
---
SNAP of a bear trap babyyyy
---
Someone on a killers shoulder, not sure what killer though
---
quick everyone GO BILL
---
It does still stop the chainsaw/hatchet/vomit that would down you when it's activated.
---
Billy‚Äôs laugh when survivors don‚Äôt get the bear trap off
---
Since when do people see your rank?
---
^^^^^Groovy
---
I'd be ok with this
---
It‚Äôll be much longer before the three basic attacks activate the perk, since those killers don‚Äôt use it as much
---
Shirtless and braless are two different things
---
I really disagree that DS was absolutely crushed or that survivors "needed" it. It serves more of a purpose now of being the "anti-tunneling" perk that it was meant to be.
---
They've mentioned dead by daylight 2 before
---
You know, in the survey they posted, it would have been really cool if they made custom perks for each character a thing.

It's in the title of the movies even smh my head

Build I use ruin bbq nurses and the 4th slot is up to you. I suggest spirit fury or enduring. Addons my favourite combo is bone Clapper and ghost, it's a slightly worse version of his ultra rare addon that makes his bell silent. He doesn't really have bad addons, he just isn't very powerful. Remember that bodyblocking is your best friend as wraith. Trap people next to gens, keep them away from pallets, things like that. Good luck, but I warn you wraith is pretty bad.
---
Oh yes please
---
i don‚Äôt want emotes. remember what happened when friday the 13th added emotes?
---
then i'll ruin noed insidious basement leatherface and camp everyone in basement if it's a 4 man to protest my hatred for punish lobby dodging
---
And here we have someone pointlessly complaining on reddit, how unusual.
---
Imagine being this condescending because someone said your crappy strat wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúextremely effective‚Äù lol
---
If you're being careful, you should be able to get Billies and LFs to M1 you more than sawing you. Nurse M1s anyways, so if you aren't good at dodging her in the first place, you wouldn't get a good use out of MoM. Plague and Huntress are a bit harder as Plagues rarely swing unless you're broken first and Huntress' will fall on their axe before M1ing most of the time.
---
Survivors absolutely did not need the perk, and I love what they did with it. I only meant that with a core survivor perk gone, it was necessary for them to get another strong one to stop all the bitching and constant crying for NOED nerfs 
---
I used the word ‚Äòcrushed‚Äô because it‚Äôs nothing compared to what it was before. And it‚Äôs decent now, but was completely broken before. No idea how it survived so long before something was done
---
Offerings that give BP is fine with me, skins as well. As long as it's not pay to win I don't really care what they do.
---
It‚Äôs not free hence the word ‚Äúpurchasable‚Äù
---
2 minutes now, and with a survivor on a hook it could be cut to just 1 minute if they make the save and get to the gate.
---
I feel you it happened to me with a pig the other day. She randomly quit and I lost a pip.
---
And make Plag vomit harder on me ;)))
---
It doesn‚Äôt even say that it‚Äôs going to be a thing this is all just speculation
---
lockwooooooooood!
---
Me too
---
How can they enjoy that?
---
Why not just play the game lol.
---
Silly survivors
---
Dude I never thought about it like that, cool!
---
Bonuses usually apply to things that are already in the game like more shards(which would be fine) or more bloodpoints, which would upset a lot of people.
---
Yes I thought it was clear I meant not what they‚Äôre suggesting. I was saying I‚Äôd be down with a free version of this not a purchasable FTP Fortnite style battlepass they‚Äôre asking about on the survey.
---
Honestly, I picked this option, because whenever I'm watching a streamer cleanse a Hex, I'm secretly hoping for it to be Haunted grounds and I get excited. It's a small fetish of mine to watch them suffer.
---
I just find it funny how systematic the change was. Almost beat for beat, it was DS nerf, then almost immediately MoM comes out as DS 2.0.
---
I still run MoM regardless because it's a free Dead Hard. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they make it an exhaust perk, tbh.
---
I did not, but even if they had it and at level 3, that's some insane RNG. Keep in mind, like I said, wasn't a huge map and it took me maybe 15 seconds to get over there. They had to have gotten out on the first or second tries, 3 times in a row, AND with enough time to get out of sight as well.
---
I was dealing with that curse when I was switching from SB to BL, but eventually I got used to seeing basement stairs as my only option. I find the possibility of getting Shelter Woods not as such a big drawback, when BL lets you run semi-infinites on 7 other maps
---
This would kill one of the most balanced Killers in the game. He‚Äôd be a 110% M1 Killer.
---
It is not seldom that a killer that uses strong add-ons, Moris, camps and tunnels hard, hits people on hook, and such, turns out to be a Russian player - I would be lying if I said that has not often been my experience, as well. But 95%? It would be a stretch saying even half of the Russian players I face behave any more like that than your average player wouldn't already anyway. And like I said, I don't usually have problems with Russian survivors. I wouldn't know that they disconnect more than players from other countries, nor that they regularly sandbag and the like. Playing killer, I also do not find that they are more likely to be teabagging or otherwise taunting. If anything is different about them on average, it's that they are better players, actually doing gens and knowing how to lead a chase.
---
k
---
He'd pretty much be impossible to play on most maps due to tall grass, corn etc.
---
He'd have no way to actually see Survivors and would be 100% reliant on Auras, noises and Tracks.
---
Noises and tracks can be negated by Survivor perks and Aura reading levels necessary for Chucky would be completely broken.
---
He just wouldn't work well with how killers work in first person. And putting him in third person would be very broken as well for Survivors.
---
Tl;dr - He's way too short to work. And there really isn't a valid way to get around that without breaking the game.
---
Imagine if there was another position also, have you seen cabin in the woods? It would be like the killer, the survivors and the entity would be a player who gets to sway the flow of the match, the better he keeps the game "balanced" the more points he gets.(1) 1v4
---
Also the battlepass had exclusive stuff that you could only get if you bought it
---
see i immediately defaulted to "topless", and was wondering what the fuck was up
---
Absolute madlad.
---
I'm sure a battlepass wouldn't grant a perk that made all survivors spawn in broken, so I think you're good.
---
The less obvious ones: 
---
* Always thought Mad Grit looked like a laughing supervillain
---
* Borrowed time: Guy getting stabbed and shrugging it off
---
* DS: How killers feel when getting hit
---
* Diversion: StoneToss. Throwing a pebble. Get it?
---
* Wake up: Face reminded me of Quentin
---
Honestly I don't consider 20k to be a victory even if I pip.  I know it technically is but...  It does not feel that way at all.  And I'm going to guess to most other killer's too, killing 2 is a draw, 3 is a win and 4 is total victory.  Pipping is just...  There, I've stopped caring about rank long ago and more just consider kills as the victory conditions.  Anything else feels fucking weird and against the nature of the game.
---
Where is this survey? Can someone send me a link please?
---
fair enough, but i did not repeat misinformation, I never said it was facts and even added an edit explaining that. anyway, I'm done here, but try to be less condescending in the future if you don't mind
---
The amount of overreactions people are having over this is kind of ridiculous jfc. It‚Äôs not a bad idea.
---
I mean she has the mind of a child
---
Outside of that, a tall Russian hatchet lady is better than being sacrificed..
---
Hell yea he sure told me.
---
I feel like a $5 pass with cosmetics would be fine but if you get shards, perks, bloodpoints, or anything that isn‚Äôt cosmetic it‚Äôs a terrible idea
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty 50/50. People either despise the idea or really love it
---
Prestige is the worst right now. Lose 50-70 hours of progress for a fucking default clothing item with a blood splatter texture on it. There's literally no reason to do it unless you want to show off.
---
Show me some leg
---
That ever so slight moment of consideration
---
Honestly I wish they would just increase the amount of blood points gained overall. Make it less of a hassle getting character builds done, and more access to good items.
---
Yep. The way they say ‚Äúbonuses‚Äù makes me not very hopeful
---
how the fuck did I not notice that
---
How is a secondary mode for Wraith a nerf? Most experienced survivors (Who he struggles against) know to look out for the shimmer.
---
How is the Clown change a nerf? Exhaustion + Blindness, Mangled, Hindered, or any of the other add-ons are pretty strong, as well has having a larger area with shorter cooldown and such. I don't think you logic well if you think "Take an add-on and make it baseline" is somehow a nerf.....
---
Enlighten me then, what is Trapper's problem?
---
Tinkerer is a great perk on Billy, and considering he's one of the few killers who is actually viable in higher ranks it's a pretty high tier perk. 
---
Also, Billy only chainsaws pallets slower if you charge it from start to finish. If you're already charging it by the time the survivor pulls it down, it's much quicker. And any killer who isn't Nurse can get looped, so saying "That's his downside" is just ignorance at it's finest..... That's *everyone's* downside.
---
Thanks...
---
If a huntress took iridescent head into every game, they would be called out on being toxic. So if you have 4 survivors with purple toolboxes and iridescent/purple add ons then why is that not allowed to be labelled as toxic? Because that kind of thing is what killers complain about when they call out "gen rushing".
---
How did you only get a single gen done in the time it took someone to die if he was camping? Just do gens.
---
Also because killers are unique whereas survivors are reskins of one another with some unique perks that may or may not actually impact on the meta.
---
Honestly with some of their other decisions I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if for $25 you get quadruple bloodpoints EVERY game
---
God almighty you're right
---
Noed gamer.
---
I hope you're not talking about charging it from start to finish instead of having it mostly charged anyway.
---
Which, if you've been looping a survivor long enough to get close enough that they have to drop the pallet, you should be charging the chainsaw instead of trying to hit them twice.
---
Against reddit rules. No witchhunting.
---
PSA: Head On does work.
---
It seems like the hit box is broken but it activates at the start of you vaulting out, not at them end. If the killer is in the hit box the second you press the vault button then you will stun. Not anytime afterwards
---
We already *pay* them to datamine us, these cunts better not get fucking greedy.
---
..... Why are you revving the chainsaw *only* when the pallet gets dropped?
---
Yeah let's make them pay in advanced so we can half ass cosmetics since they already paid! That's assuming they don't include perks, bonus BP, or anything to this which would be even worse
---
I thought it meant cute cosmetics to support the game outside of the DLC. Sorry I didn't know and I hit interested..
---
That hook wouldn‚Äôt pop a balloon. But seriously really good. Like the blood stain on the base. If i‚Äôd change anything it would be the hook and more jagged edges for the base.
---
my curse is that every game i dont run NOED my hex spawns right next to a survivor or in an obvious place
---
So being optimal is toxic.
---
It won't take too long. I've played maybe 20 games of Huntress, and I have over 300 throws. I started slow, but now I can easily throw 20 or more per game.
---
Google
---
Who says I am, it still takes longer if the surv isn't subhuman.
---
If you're an intelligent human being it should be common knowledge not to drop a pallet if the Billy is pre-revving.
---
It does  actually
---
Very nice detail with the hand print. Wonder if they kobe'd.
---
Yea I was finna a make it myself but like I said my shit got stolen so I just had gotten my friends tutorial
---
Oh yeah?
---
I'm sorry but Chucky just isn't it for this game. I disagree with Freddy because of humor and mostly because he was a pedophile. Hes mostly humor. Neither of them fit into the universe.
---
Being "optimal" is labelled as toxic for both. Taking the fun out of a non competitive game because you want an advantage that the other side can't deal with *is* kinda toxic. Especially when you're already in a swf.
---
No dude I am agreeing with you, I don't think it should give/take away wglf stacks/points in general.
---
lmfao if you have the gates open and you choose to walk back in you fucking deserve it and have literally no one to blame but yourself
---
"I'm a killer. What do you want me to do? Not kill you?"
---
Whenever I stomp all the survivors, i give the laat person alive the hatch so lpng as there are 3 gens left. Makes me feel better about being such a bastard as a survivor.
---
As I survivor main, I would definitely help you find the lad
---
What is this aids

Apparently they do.

She is currently suffering from a bug that makes a sound when she vaults or phases, so higher level survivors will fall for mind games less. Also survivor footsteps and injured sounds are fucked since the last patch, so you'll be learning spirit on hard mode until that is fixed.
---
And even if you don't like her, her perks are fantastic and very strong on other killers.
---
I think if you're sensible and realise you're learning then getting stomped isn't an issue.
---
I gave Nurse a go on console a few weeks ago. I got one hook and was actually really pleased with myself.
---
Low expectations are a wonderful thing.
---
Thank you so much, didnt know this was a thing
---
Yes your flair has a typo it seems
---
I‚Äôd only be interested if it was free. Additional challenges akin to dailies are bad. Extra grinding for cosmetics is nice, and if they want to monetize it make tiers purchasable.  Don‚Äôt make the levels stupid hard to get, and obtainable by generally playing. Maybe every bloodweb you level up(balancing could be done since lvl 50 and lvl 1 are different obviously). If anything it‚Äôll keep the game fresh so ppl can do that instead of achievement hunt.

Here's what I have a problem with, there's other games which way worse communities like rust but it wont really affect gameplay. Here you have killers that tunnel and camp that ruin someone's experience totally. Sure a survivor can t-bag or whatever but that won't change the gameplay at all...
---
No, you can't take progress, bloodpoints, levels and anything from PTB to live.
---
I finally figured out how to do this, after playing for a year, and I set it on a tree. Oops.
---
I don't even play any more it has gotten so bad since the Legion patch. So you can guess how I voted.
---
yeah f those people
---
Ikr i think it will be like fortnite like 500 bp every week or so and cosmetics everytime you win or lvl up
---
He couldn't kill you so he asked if you could do it yourself :P
---
Ah yes, being an asshole to other people because another group of people were an asshole to you. That'll show the first group of people!!
---
I feel like I've seen this exact picture like every day for the past week
---
There should be an option for ‚Äúso uninterested, if offered, I would uninstall and dissuade others from playing the game‚Äù
---
You already got paid, you don‚Äôt get to be paid twice, especially since you‚Äôre leeching the community with DLC rather than balancing your game, BHVR.
---
Think you hit the nail on the head. In most games you can only send toxic hatemail and such but in DBD you can easily go out of your way to make someone have a shitty time. It‚Äôs easier for killers to do but sandbagging is also a real thing
---
Better hope it was a damn important tree
---
*Loads into map as Billy. Does okay and gets a few hooks. Downs one Dwight with a saw, he DCs. Lets others escape because fuck that Dwight.*
---
Until you get the Claudette squad that spends the whole game following you around and disabling your traps instead of doing gens.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm planning on finding maybe some fishing hooks/hardware at Home Depot. or something.
---
Yeah, especially as I feel like I need to bring a bag add-on with me each time.
---
So how‚Äôs that Freddy rework?
---
I already said it on another comment, but it's just a copout. This game is begging for some meaningful progression and rewards, and if the only source of that becomes a paid ordeal it would drive a lot of people away considering the fact that there isn't really much like that outside of the pass.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a BM. But honestly I do it because it was unfortunate that I didnt have to use it. Then I decide to show it off. 
---
Point of the perk is to use it. 
---
Always comes in handy when you can block for someone though.
---
T H I C C
---
I would buy double BP for a certain amount of hours not gonna lie
---
That was my assumption but I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was more like iridescent in all emblems or what have it. Thanks!
---
When I read this I just assumed they meant like a battle pass. Auric cells, bloodpoints, items of clothing.  Not like perks or something.
---
For reaaons already mentioned, especially u/ikarikh, Chucky in doll form wouldn‚Äôt work. But Charles Lee Ray was a serial killer before possessing the door, and had voodoo powers. There‚Äôs potential but I think there would just be better fits for the game
---
I've seen enough people that camp with perks that require you to leave the hook, or not tunnel a survivor so that's fun üòÇ 
---
But yeah slowing down hook progress or so would be good. But maybe they could do it that when the killer is not in a chase and standing within a certain distance to the hook it will reduce points and even more if you camp for longer.
---
DbD community whem they see Myers
---
How old were you when you realized this?
---
Today. I was today years old

Cosmetics still affect gameplay in a game like DBD though?
---
Sweet! Thanks for the help. I‚Äôm currently trying different perk configurations to see what really benefits me/other perks.
---
Then get better lol...? It's not impossible to 4k.
---
how do you do it
---
I mean. If you're claudette
---
The increase skill check odds add-ons are useless. The pink add-on should have 3 RBT and there should be a pink add-on that removes the roar sound of the ambush.
---
Or if the cosmetic is bright fucking neon.
---
Ah yes, you might be right
---
Sure, but that‚Äôs still 2/16 potential characters (if you‚Äôre buying DLC) on one side of the game. If you want to play Killer too, heaven help you
---
Specially when they see a shirtless Myers
---
At that point it's your own grave if you wanna wear it
---
I fully know they're probably laughing about making me a salty ez gaym babby killer or whatever but I'm gonna die someday and I dont think I'll look back and be like "ah yes I'm so glad I spent a portion of my life willfully enduring people being dicks for the sake of red triangles"
---
^ Found another invisible claudette
---
Either way the cosmetics still affect gameplay and your response proves that.
---
You can‚Äôt buy things from the shrine with real money
---
I hope not. It would look kinda silly imo. Most if not all killers are intimidating in some way. Chucky doesn't really fit this game. Ghostface however...
---
Once I realise you probably have Spine Chill I‚Äôm gonna become the next Micheal Jackson and hook you before you can say ‚Äúwait why can‚Äôt I move out of this corner‚Äù
---
Oh no please no. I just got this game like 2 weeks ago and I love it. But if they come out with this.....
---
Glass bead add on. Really useful add on.
---
Some people just want to find things to be upset about I guess
---
Fuck that. Hard fuck that noise.
---
Her charging literally takes 2 seconds and if 110% is slow as fuck, then you just admitted that Hag is slow as fuck.
---
You don't need to use the apple at the start of the match, you just keep it like your dirty secret, then use it if survivors don't want to cleanse, so you can punish them.
---
She has potential and with some buffs, she can become a better Huntress. But right now I consider her mid tier.
---
I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll give bloodpoints out which will make it easier for people who payed to get rare add ons and items
---
Don't do this
---
I am a virgin
---
But if it was stuff that didn't impact the gameplay, would it be so bad?
---
Survs can very easily break line of sight
---
Yes I did
---
reverse it. That's what I am asking. Gonna assume it's no either way.
---
I think they confirmed it would only be cosmetics for now, but I‚Äôm against the idea simply because it could spiral out of control and eventually be as bad as we fear
---
Also, it probably wouldn‚Äôt fit the feel of the game if that makes sense
---
The way it's designed now discourages camping the hooks. I prefer it that way.
---
Really i always taught that you can buy iridescent shards my bad then
---
I‚Äôve seen the video, but this is just a random screenshot of a Claudette crouching. Am I missing something?
---
Battle Passes are fine, they just get a bad rep because "fOrTnItE bAd"
---
However, I don't think it would work well in DbD.
---
Most of the ones on big hills on Autohaven.
---
Fair enough, I'm never condescending when someone follows through on information I took the time to share.  Though, you did repeat misinformation: The 6+ SC comment and how you still thought it was still correct, despite evidence.
---
I'm done here too, but try to follow up on information within the discussion before responding in the future if you don't mind.
---
Am I dumb cus I don‚Äôt understand lol.
---
Plus be used for bm and trolling/grieving.
---
I play nurse on console, I have to do some next level calculus in order to account for the frame rate drop, teleporting survivors, and the inevitable game crashes.
---
If I could only have 1 perk, it would be spine chill! Wraith, Pig, Myers tier 2, etc. it‚Äôs a life saver!
---
Is Head On fixed yet? Any pointers?
---
Corner Wraiths are the worst üò≠ü§°üò≠ü§°üò≠
---
My experience is the same as yours, but I don‚Äôt prioritise pipping so I sit in lower ranks. I get quite a few games where someone gets downed fast and they DC.
---
It's only unfun for a survivor to do nothing all game when they don't choose to do it
---
Instead of doing that I think they need to remove perk levels to make it less of a hassle to get perks as they add more and more new ones. 
---
They've already sort of been doing this with things like ruin and noed being updated so the level 1 and 3 versions work the same, the stats are just a bit different, so I think it would make sense.
---
If you take the outlines of the perks, items and offerings, so a diamond, square and that 6-pointed shape and put the diamond in the square and the 6-point around the square you get the loadout symbol. Not sure if that made it any clearer.
---
Nothing like being told "Kill yourself" for playing a rather subpar Billy.
---
I delited my post about this because I tought I might have been overreacting. I'm glad to see that, basically the same post, already got so many people that agree
---
He doesn‚Äôt have four balls
---
In dbd I honestly don't think more blood points will really change that much. I mean there are blood point increasing perks and items and while they are great they aren't needed to be competitive. I mean until recently how many killers even had bbq and chili? Hell I grabbed it and I still don't have it on all my favourites. 
---
Unless it's something like 10x BP I really don't see an issue. Especially because it could likely influence behavior to make the base games and possibly even future characters dlc free, which would result in a  good boost to player numbers which is objectively a good thing for the game.
---
I think, I still use it and it's not doing that well, so but maybe they are just too close to me?
---
You don't see this perks in game? maybe you not correctly installed
---
Not sure why you are assuming it will be P2W other than to trying to bait out upvotes from /r/gaming users, most likely if they did a battle pass it would be skins and (hopefully) new cosmetics like new mori animations, loading screens, etc.
---
What does it matter to you? Get on with your life and deal with it, it hardly really affects you anyway with the sheer amount of add-ons most killers have saved
---
No they are there. For example the nea ones. The icon isn‚Äôt the perk. Instead it flies of the perk.
---
Dwight: *‚Äù.... you know what it beats getting eaten by the spider god again‚Äù*
---
They asked the question themself, so it's safe to say that they were at least thinking of implementing this. In fact, they asked a lot of questions that seemed pretty off topic. Why do the devs want to know how many times I go to sport events?
---
