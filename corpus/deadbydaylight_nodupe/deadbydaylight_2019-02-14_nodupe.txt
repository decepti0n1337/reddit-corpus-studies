You will never be good enough for condescending redditors to take your advice seriously, just ignore it, according to them nobody is good at video games anyway.

They mean a lot to everyone, Reddit is a sad place controlled by orange arrows :(

I'm too busy revelling in the fact that Wraith is now...

DAPPER

FUUUUUUUCK!

**2 8  S T A B  W O U N D S**
---
This event was pretty meh. Im glad it happened but Im also glad to see it leave
---
They make a regular controller for switch also
---
Oh boy, Dead by Daylight on a portable console. This is gonna be messy.
---
Scott uses a crosshair, Zubat doesn't. It's like the difference between an athlete that does roids and one who doesn't. I give it to Zubatel.
---
Sleeping Hollow. I‚Äôm like 100% sure our ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù Sally did that.
---
Ngl I didn‚Äôt know that I needed Wraith in a tuxedo until I saw it. Dapper asf
---
You‚Äôre doing really bad with protecting Legion‚Äôs rights.
---
Please make sure this game runs atleast 30FPS. Keep it consistent and it can be enjoyed.
---
Oh ok it‚Äôs fine
---
A simple upload/download concept.
---
I'm also garbage as killer but I've had a 4k! You can do it, buddy!
---
Jesus Christ you need to loosen up a bit.
---
on low ranks only.
---
Dead by daylight doesn‚Äôt deserve to be on the switch. It‚Äôs a glitchy mess filled with incompetent devs. I‚Äôm very worried.
---
Neat but, couldn't you have just *not* commented?
---
How is clown bad?
---
or if another person buys Freddy and plays the tunnel game instead of being effective at using Dream state.
---
It's also a business strategy not to buy/invest in dedicated server on launch since you don't know if the game is going to click on the market. Servers are expensive as sh*t.
---
But...nah.
---
me on mcdonalds wifi while playin this on my nintendo switch
---
What did they port it to ? 
---
Jokes aside portable DBD would be pretty sweet.
---
She had to, you were T-Posing she knew you were dangerous!
---
&gt;but the real ~~winner~~ runner up is Kate
---
FTFY, Meg mains unite!
---
Completely unrelated but okay
---
&gt; They shouldnt do this till dedicated servers are a thing.
---
Says right on the video "This fall", the servers are coming in summer which could be as early as June or as late as Sept. . 
---
I'll "release" how dumb I'm being? lol. I'll ask you to do the same, the base PS4 is much stronger than the One S. Every graphics comparison for the last 5 years prove it. Sorry that caused you such pain.
---
Nea's face is that of a goblin.
---
Unrelated =/= not important
---
*T*hats an *I*n*T*riguingly *L*aughabl*E* question.
---
Nah, DWIGHT
---
They must be laughing all the way to the bank at this point.  The console versions mostly run like shit but that doesn‚Äôt stop them from releasing subpar killers and cosmetics and charging real money for them.
---
Maybe focus on making sure your other ports work properly?
---
Love that map
---
MYC is great for any high mobility killer. Nurse's for any stealth Killer. Unreleting is really great for if you miss with your attack out of phasing. Instadowns (Haunted Grounds mainly) are also good.
---
I personally really like Thrill of the Hunt for silly totem builds.
---
Remember, it is still over half a year till the release. This means, we will have dedicated servers once it comes out. Graphics look very flat, but if that is what it takes to make it run, I am ok with that (just check with reviews before you buy the game once it comes out and confirm it runs well).
---
We also don't know how much Koch Media will actually work on the game, but while I am not their biggest fan, their switch lineup is totally alright in port quality.
---
So, lets just wait and see. I am excited for what it could be, and hope it will be that, but I wouldn't bet money on it
---
To be honest portable D&amp;D is pretty neat.
---
Stalking begins in the shitter. Shirtless Michael next pls
---
Nay
---
Switch doesn't deserve DBD.

&amp;#x200B;
---
What do you mean? Seeing an ebony Mori or a jigsaw piece is always a sign of a good game
---
Prob not at least If it ever gets added I‚Äôd like to only between consoles and not pc 
---
It would be nice so the queue times aren‚Äôt long AF but then you would have threads of people saying for PC players are super OP, so no. We probably won‚Äôt see cross-play.
---
Roll for initiative!
---
It depends on your killer rank. I always want to play killer especially when all of my rituals are killer-related. But no one joins my lobby (rank 18).
---
No one would save Freddy lmao
---
Would you so kindly **GET ON THE GENS?**
---
Nope, slower. Gold is faster
---
I'm glad you liked it :D
---
I don‚Äôt think DbD has voice chat in any version? 
---
For me too! but sometimes their ping is completely normal and they still complain and i'm just like, BITCH you can literally see the fucking ping in the lobby, i saw your fucking ping it was on green-yellow, AND you escaped bitch the fuck you complaining about
---
Doesnt it turn red when two people get on a gen and it has a little arrow?
---
In other words: Further proof that BHVR doesn't actually care about the game beyond how much they can milk it
---
,,,,,no....
---
ew. people saying hex perks. disgusting. 
---
Discordance is all you need. learn to use her power properly and you won't care for add-ons at all. I use whatever I have a lot in inventory with BBQ, Pop Goes the Weasel, Discordance and Enduring/Bamboozle. personally, only reason I enjoy Beads is because they remove the whoosh sound for killer too. taking of gens is actually pretty easy without it when you're playing smart.
---
full Hex build(Russian Roulette) is a mean to victory, not an actual fun game for both sides. Hex builds are damn annoying to play against and only fun if you don't like outsmarting and outskilling other players. 
---
I'd pay $100 for Waluigi killer.
---
David King is Chad 
---
Its a bug. Its supposed to go gold when theres a speed boost like prove yourself but its bugged

---
Would you kindly not suggest MORE CLOTHES FOR HUNTRESS. 
---
mate, just slap on the Ebony Mori. it works too. 
---
Poor ding dong :(
---
As a Wraith main.... i am so happy, and sad. Their love separated by never ending trials. Forced to kill. Hoping to meet again. Yet knowing that the entity wants them seperated.
---
The time has come for a Kill With Friends or in this case.. Lover
---
Is this as it now? Cuz last night i checked some tier list and nurse was S freddy was F. I'm really new to this. 
---
Ur a peice of shitüòÇüòÇ
---
You actually believe that?
---
uhm... I mean yeah, kinda add-ons. but might as well go add-onless at this point, doesn't make big difference. just like Fred's. 
---
Im gonna give them a chance, there‚Äôs no way dbd could run on the switch unless optimized!
---
nurse x trapper when
---
Imagine nurse on the switch. Holy motion sickness.
---
Side note.  The formatting of this document doesn't come out right on mobile, but the text is still legible
---
Accurate to a degree, though there is no counterplay to DS.
---
Duuuude I had this one potato legit infront of me couched and waiting. No killer heartbeat AT all and you can see the obsession wreaths wiggling because of a chase. And she waited all through first stage then as soon as I went into struggle unhooked me. Like really thanks.
---
I am extremely excited for this. Portable DbD will be too cool.
---
I hope it includes all of the non licensed dlcs at launch so i don't have to buy them all again...
---
We should have 2-3 more chapters before this drops too :o

About a week ago, I made [this post[(https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aon870/i_made_these_little_guys_about_a_week_ago_for/) about Dead by Daylight keychains I made when I got the idea to make this coin. 
---
While designing it, I put the hole in it to wear it on a keychain, or necklace or something. 
---
But the more I look at it, the more I hate it. 
---
*Fall 2019
---
I play both killer and survivor and honestly, it‚Äôs one of my favorite maps. It‚Äôs just so fun and has some of the more unconventional loops/chases
---
And everywhere else it hardly passes as a PS3 game.  
---
now make us Amibos plz
---
I KEEP WINNING THESE GAMES TO THE POINT WERE I JUST DONT REALLY CARE BUT ONCE THREE SURVIVORS ARE OUT OF THE GATE I GET PISSED FOR SOME REASON
---
RANK 6 IF YOURE WONDERING
---
Black ward is a bad sign 
---
Probably will like you are running it on Microsoft powerpoint since the more powerful consoles struggle to get 20 frames
---
WE JUST DONT WANT YOUR BACKS TO GET STABBED BECYASE THAT SHIT FUCKING HURTS MAN
---
Killer: Jack the Ripper
---
Survivor: The Torso
---
Because the licensed killers will likely be DLC and not part of the base release. They didn't show Myers in the console trailers either because he came later for consoles.
---
I kinda want that but as a full Hag skin! Can you imagine a full Hag body, but babies!
---
Side note: For some reason my brain said "You need to hold your breath while you type that" and it took me an excruciating amount of time to type that.
---
Fall is about as late as it could be this year...That's after September.
---
oh I love it too as both. as survivor cause I learned the map as killer and can abuse it a bit :D also, no matter how much I dislike certain changes, I absolutely love the details devs added to Game lately. like small stuff - pig's head on some drop downs, more textures everywhere, new turns, more doors. beautiful, such a huge potential to mindgaming, counter rotating and cutting off with these new doors. 
---
Lol saw a rank 1 and rank 5 streamers with rank 18survivors in my rank 16 lobby.. they said I should follow them to help their stream like btch, why would I wanna watch someone exploit matchmaking for low level games. 
---
Shame, i heard she was addon dependent and hoped the brown would suffice.
---
Hey this chapter is good and all but have you ever seen this? https://docs.google.com/document/d/184iZVTULlzmVTczbp_5SFqhSgRqZe2Cee98i_xUOkmE/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
It only stops them below rank 14. Then it doesnt seem to last more than 15secs or effect their gen popping at all
---
Regardless of wether or not it's a high minded (which I didn't claim, I just said it's not a circlejerk. You're putting words in my mouth), it's still sharing opinions, which is more of a discussion than a circlejerk would be. The fact that we didn't just screech at you because you disagreed with us proves that it's not a mindless circlejerk, which is what I was arguing and what you didn't address.
---
I consider the gates being powered and opened as a game that is already over, which for me is an edge case. If you are basing the perk being good against any killer on it being good against any killer when the game is already over then I don't think that's a strong argument. 
---
A good killer doesn't need to tunnel and camp, it is an option but if you're good at killer you either won't be in such situation or you will be able to get someone else instead of going for the unhooked person. Especially when you aren't playing the weakest killers.
---
Billy and Bubba have instadowns. Huntress, Clown, Nurse, Hag and Spirit can two hit people fast enough that they don't need to go after the unhooked person. Doc can cancel unhooking with his treatment mode and go after the unhooker. Pig has her traps.
---
That leaves Trapper, Wraith and Freddy (who has borrowed time built-in). I guess it's good vs them then.
---
To quote myself on Discord:
---
&gt;Dead by Daylight community is freaking weird man
---
&gt;* Embodiment of evil incarnate with no concept of morality or emotion and a pure desire to kill -&gt; Wants to put their dick in it
---
&gt;* Sociopath drug addict who violently tortures people before murdering them after toying with their lives -&gt; Adorable little cinnamon bun
---
&gt;* Child molester and child murderer -&gt; Misunderstood underdog
---
&gt;* Deranged Russian woman who kills people for sport -&gt; Wants to put their dick in it
---
&gt;* Brutally deformed embodiment of rage with an insatiable appetite for human flesh -&gt; beautiful trophy wife with no flaws
---
&gt;And of course:
---
&gt;* Some fucking shithead teenagers with hunting knives -&gt; the anti-Christ
---
He's shit
---
nooo, she's less dependent than Billy. not on Nurse/Pig level but definitely much better performing without add-ons than Billy. 
---
It‚Äôs not legion hatred as much as it is playing against legion hatred. He‚Äôs just not a fun design to play against. Nurse is hated because she can circumvent chase mechanics, billy is disliked because he‚Äôs a minor version of it, legion follows suit but in an even less complicated way. Where they have to properly use their movement abilities legion just hits the no chase button on sight and mouth breathes his ass onto you, legion aesthetically is meh but I‚Äôm cool with it, legion mechanically is a fucking nightmare 
---
You won't be able to transfer progress or DLCs.
---
Yup, Hag can kind of scratch that itch by using her teleport anywhere add on but again as you say it's not massively different from her normal gameplay.
---
Justify the above please
---
Even better
---
I think billy is fine without addons, so thats good i guess.
---
That's not what determines game speed. Latency determines it. So if you have 1gb speed but you have bad latency you're gonna have really bad lag. 
---
Same reason why I don't use No Mither. The injured music gets really grating after a while.
---
If you don't want it asap maybe :(
---
I would like to say, everyone, that even though they're bad at pushing out optimization for the current systems, Fall is still quite a long ways away. Who says they couldn't get not only the current games running smoother, but get the Switch port just as smooth even before it hits the system? I mean, give them SOME credit, they did build the game that at least most of us love to play around with, even in its buggy, laggy state. Not saying it WILL happen, just stating that it COULD. We will just have to wait and see with hopes high. 
---
I would love to play this on switch. Hopefully that Nintendo money makes it work out. 
---
What was it? The nightmare?
---
I do want it, but I would much rather have a nice, polished product. The DLC and whatnot aren't as polished because they are on a strict schedule set to the beginning of the year
---
That's because at ranks 1 and 2, all the salt leaves in dc's before the game ends
---
I wouldnt even count on it, or at least not soon (as, within this year). Legion seems to be ment as a singular counter to the most common survivor shticks like pallet looping, and thats what they do. 
---
I want the Nurse skin but my purchase won't go through :(
---
We call that Identity V
---
Nintendo Switch can‚Äôt even handle a linear game like RE7 and it needs to be streamed. The game doesn‚Äôt even look or run great on the much stronger consoles.
---
This switch port will be atrociously badly optimised and near unplayable, I already see it
---
I would like to hear "Welcome to the circus of values!" just for nostalgia's sake.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
As a Huntress main... yeah that makes sense 
---
Thank you !!
---
I wish they would do a PS4 Pro and Xbox One X optimization patch. I think you could look a lot better on these consoles.
---
for a second i thought davids tattoo was his skin burnt and grafted and i was shocked for a moment
---
That's quite a mouthful, maybe a snappy acronym would be better?
---
PLEASE ADD MORE HUNTRESS COSMETICS MOST OF HERS ARE PRETTY TRASH AND LOOK UGLY
---
Something like a 2v8 would be such a cool experiment!
---
I forgot to add shitpost shit
---
Just hit skill checks, noob
---
Holy SHIT that's gorgeous!!
---
I TOO AGREE WITH THIS AS A HUNTRESS MAIN
---
Otherwise known as Wasting Time
---
Switch. Look at the title, friend
---
GOD I LOVE HUNTRESS

The Wraith bing bonging the wedding bell waiting for his bride, his best man Trapper by his side along with Herman Carter as prist. Nurse the blushing bride with her bridesmaids of Huntress, female legion and Claudette and Kate on hooks.

Great edit, only thing that would've made it better was a Roblox "oof" when you got trapped hahaha
---
&gt;when the timer reaches zero if you are in a jigsaw box it will not kill you until you find out if you successfully found your key
---
I don't think this is true? I'm certain I've died while searching through a jigsaw box, and didn't stop until i was already dead.
---
Unless I misunderstand what you're saying.
---
‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt even mad‚Äù
---
I'm talking about non bloodpoint offerings
---
Yeah,Freddy splinter
---
Take my upvote üòè
---
Damn that survivor dummy thicc 
---
Tbh that's why I really like the Legion :x
---
Lose bitter murmur take bloodhound.
---
haha it's ok it happens
---
Hitting rank 1 is literally just a measure of playing for long enough, can we stop with these.
---
Thompson farm and springwood.
---
I said the same thing before and got called a ‚ÄúSJW‚Äù lol. I think it would be in bad taste though, especially considering the sexually violent nature of his crimes.
---
Every second counts you know. So juggling is a must. 
---
The meat plant is my lucky map, i do well as a killer and survivor.
---
Make more! ‚ô°
---
it's not about playing different, fam. it's about using things that make the game less fun for survivors therefore bringing upon those who play Spirit decently without crutch or cunty builds disconnects at start and overall more frustration to the community. it's a bigger problem than just mere builds or differences. it's actual community that recommends you here at this very time cancer crutch builds that make the game worse. 
---
I don't fukin understand how people can do the crutch builds and then be surprised someone got tunneled or flamed in end chat or bmed in game. 
---
but oh just saw your nickname, I remember you, you're inadequate so I'm gonna leave this thread. 
---
‚ÄúCosmetics take no effort to make‚Äù yeah ok buddy you can sit down now. Pretty much anything you could say after that would automatically be invalidated by how silly you sound.
---
Dude this is the most fucking fitting shit
---
they wanted to be killed, stop patronizing me for playing the game how I want
---
Hurr dur fire the art team and have a second balance team instead
---
Everything you just named is cel shaded or cartoony in design. Those kinds of games inherently look better at lower quality than something going for a more realistic look. 
---
Haha I‚Äôm glad I could make your day 
---
Yes
---
yes they were xD I found one right off the bat and tried to bring him to the basement locker first but he got away... into a basement locker
---
thats the point of this post?
---
Well Dead By Daylight looks bad for a PS4/Xbox One game. So for the switch, this is to be expected 
---
This is tight as fuck. Great concepts! Second Chance seems absolutely worthless as is, since it relies on you not being hooked until the rest of your team is dead/escaped, the killer not staring at you being the last hooked survivor, and pure raw luck (It's still just a 9% chance rolled 3 times, the odds are not great). My proposal would be that you can land a decisive strike-esque skillcheck about half-way through your second hook timer (that's after 30 seconds in second state btw) that lets you unhook yourself a la Deliverance, probably also putting you in the broken state a la Deliverance, basically second state Deliverance is what I'm proposing. Hit the skillcheck, free yourself, miss it and lose some time, let it pass and business as usual.
---
YOU DID MAKE IT TO THE EXIT, YOU JUST CAN'T LEAVE IF YOU HAVE A TRAP ON YOUR HEAD, YOU JUST HAVE TO REMOVE IT FROM ONE OF THE JIGSAW BOXES FIRST, THE TIMER ALSO DOESN'T GO DOWN IF YOU'RE IN THE PIG'S TERROR RADIUS
---
no I just played with them... nothing sweaty in following a bunch of memers into the basement and hooking them like they're asking for
---
That, and doc already has a stick for beating peasants, so it‚Äôs really a perfect fit for him
---
Nice, hopefully it will be seen by someone who is actually clueless :))
---
Tbqh I haven't played Infinite yet. Been postponing it since ever while playing other games. 
---
Sex-related deaths in horror is nothing new, but I'm concerned with how they happened to real, breathing people. I don't want to play an interpretation of their murderer in a game. 
---
Fuck everyone who says that, tbh. They're just being callous and disrespectful, of the living and the dead.
---
&gt;went better than expected
---
you expected what exactly from a Pizza Dwight squad? 
---
hah, im too bad of a killer to punish bullying, i only just started killer after about 160 hrs
---
DBD: Negative Frames Edition
---
i downed 4 people with bubba last game bc i was camping one of their friends, it was a swf squad
---
God forbid you use insidious *ever.* I've legacied Hillbilly which means I've been around a while. Every now and then I like to try something I've never done before. Game after game I was reported for hacking in a legacy because no veteran Hillbilly would ever use Insidious. Bitch I just want to try something new.
---
When I haven‚Äôt played the game in forever and my killer is rank 20 and I see a 4man swf with flashlights and wearing bright clothing, makes me happy being a killer main with good perks, add ons, and a few mori‚Äôs in my pocket... I like to think I‚Äôm teaching them not to mess with rank 20s
---
Yeah I constantly get them whenever they come up. I always thought it was random but I'm starting to re think that because it's always the same lol
---
Damn that map is pretty dark lol 
---
I agree. I don‚Äôt understand what steps they‚Äôre taking to port the game with so little detail but if they‚Äôre collaborating with an amazing team like panic button, then they can definitely bring the game to switch smoothly. Panic Button was able to port Doom, Warframe, and Rocket league to switch successfully and the Warframe devs said that panic button taught them a whole bunch about optimization. 
---
Blessed Katto
---
They should not do this. That is a terrible idea. 
---
Can't wait for the Switch port to have Nintendo crossover characters
---
How did you get a picture in without her throwing a hatchet at your face.
---
Or skins
---
Luigi Dwight FTW! 
---
You can _feel_ the satisfaction in that Trapper
---
Loool how come ? doesn‚Äôt the rain calm you down plus who would hate making the splish splash sounds while u running üèÉüèæ 
---
SEEING HATCHETS GOING THROUGH TREES/CARS/WALLS AND HITTING SURVIVORS. MEANWHILE DEVS ARE ALL YOU LIKE BEAUTY AND THE BEAST? 
---
Bubba with insidious= salt farmer?
---
God forbid you use insidious *ever.* I've got a legacy Hillbilly, so I've been around a while. Every now and then I like to try something I've never done before. Recently I'm trying Insidious Hillbilly. Hook someone, let them get rescued, lul a few people in a false sense of security, then on the next hook insidious wait at the top of the Basement stairs. Game after game I was reported for hacking in a legacy because no veteran Hillbilly would *ever* do that.
---
Second Chance is for specific situations when you're hooked right next to the hatch, so it's not meant to be *amazing. It's also supposed to syngergize with something like deliverance and slippery meat.*
---
Why didn't I think of that?
---
\*Fuck\*
---
[removed]
---
Dwight would be he's too busy trying to find another closet that he can finally use to return to Narnia.
---
Unlikely, PC and XBox would've gotten it by now. Granted, this is liable to change with dedicated servers, as I'd imagine that'd make things easier.
---
Yeah that too 
---
Smooth 10 FPS experience
---
fix the game? nah... Buy this shit. 
---
Lowkey I love the clown and doctor
---
Also gotta say I love when they do this, I play nurse so free hits feel great. They're fault for running pretty much directly at me
---
Devs have said the next killer is going to the furthest back in terms of history, a lot of people have been speculating that it's going to be a Victorian era killer so its possible
---
So if a perk shows up twice, get it so new ones show up? I thought it was random 
---
huh? I just said I didn't need to know what "bara" is. I googled it cause it was posted in a meme on a sub dedicated to my favourite game. and since someone didn't know what this is either, I, pardon me, assumed they might also be disgusted if they Google. so yeah
---
Lol I always heard it was random but after all this I know it's not. I'll skip insidious because I don't use it but sure enough it pops back up every other web and I constantly get the perks from the first 3 killers I leveled up
---
No they confirmed that it wasn‚Äôt planned at least

Still waiting with ya brother. For now, we must suffer in cornfields that have -10 fps

I'm sorry, I really don't think this is meta-irony just by how everything is phrased in the title. it seems like a person just used the meme wrong cause they didn't understand the irony behind it and others upvoting it cause it's somehow wholesome. 
---
One thing I‚Äôve always thought would be the best use of dbd in visual media, is a Netflix mini series. 1 hour per episode and each one focusing on one survivor and one killer.
---
Really? I‚Äôve never have had that happen to me. It‚Äôs usually just death threats cause I‚Äôve done nothing wrong.
---
I'm not sure if this is true but if it is it's both infuriating to me and kindof a smart play for BHVR, this'll get nintendo players onto the game.
---
I just looked it up more. They said December of last year? What happened?
---
If it contains all the original DLC then I'll bite for 40-50$, sure it'll run awful but I'm really used to low FPS, as I played back in 2016 on an old Acer beast at 15fps
---
I had a Huntress getting tilted just because I stuck completing the gen even after she approached and hit me.
---
Is this confirmed or are you telling me the likely scenario?
---
I get salt from killers way more than from survivors on ps4 lol. 
---
you don't know at all what happened. i made a post to be funny, then people like you come on criticizing not the post, but me personally, and that's super annoying. these dwights were memeing, I memed with them, but I'm not gonna sit around for 20 mins doing literally nothing they were literally all in the basement lockers. I SAW them go in. what would YOU do? just sit there and stare? see you are the problem with the community, not me, I enjoy myself, and let others enjoy themselves too, I don't take everything so seriously I'm just trying to have fun. And I have no idea why you think their fun is so much more important than mine.  
---
let me also just restate something you just said: you get upset when someone doesn't contribute to a pizza dwight meme. In a game that has nothing to do with you. check yourself before you go bashing other people for not doing everything how you want it to be done  
---
Would a shirtless Myers be good for stealth or bad? I would think it‚Äôs a David. 
---
WHY I HATE IT? BECAUSE I LIKE NURSE AND IM MAINING (SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH) HER. BUT THE DEVELOPERS HAVE LISTENED TO THE WISHES OF LITTLE GIRLS. AND THIS IS AN EXTREMELY BAD CHOICE. 
---
Literally the exact opposite for me. I guess I play like an ass with killer and cool with survivor?
---
honestly could depend on rank and also what time zone you play on
---
One only wastes the time finding a lobby, the other sabotages a match and fucks over everyone else.
---
Not even remotely the same.
---
ok
---
It adds a lot more than 12 seconds to a generator when you count how much time generators aren't being worked on by each of your 4head teammates who are spending that 9% slowdown self-healing through Sloppy Butcher before being spotted on their way to being useful.
---
Devs don't just seemingly give the players the finger for no reason, not if they want to be successful. 
---
Imagine this, the devs are working on console optimization when suddenly, there request or however it works to port the game to switch goes through. Decision is made that instead of an optimisation pass, it will be a full rework of the game for the switch. Obviously there will be delays but they don't want to reveal the port this early. So they stay quiet and chaos ensues.
---
This is by no means true or even backed up by a shred of proof, but it does make some sense. The devs aren't evil assholes.
---
I play red ranks late. I guess being tired makes you less toxic.

Hatch is not good mechanic. It needs to have skill check at the least. I'm always in that situation. Survivor has 3 sometimes 4 gens to go but I let them go bc it's pointless and wasting time. No skill on survivor. Hope they fix it where it's skill check 
---
ya it is meant for killers taking the game hostage or a survivor blocking another survivor in a wall. the devs should really be more clear with it 
---
I wasn't refuting what you said. You gotta read between the lines a bit.
---
Yeah no that‚Äôs just completely wrong, both sides are to blame when it comes to that
---
if i had doctor, that'd be great, id totally do that, also like i explained, i DID meme with them, but when they dont want to do gens and escape what am i supposed to do but kill them? you make terrible assumptions and things like that hurt the community and dont tell me to just "dodge" im sorry but I'm going to play whatever game i get dealt, whether its pizza dwight or p3 claud squad. I have NEVER Dc'ed and never will, and thats my choice. so if i get dealt a pizza dwight and dont stand there for ages doing nothing dont get upset and salty. because youre not helping anyone, and i hate seeing self righteous people like you trash other people just because they didnt do something your way.

Oh I thought you meant a gen fully repaired directly after the trap went on. Two gens were completed by that point. There was someone else who had a trap on at the same time as me and their timer was ticking down.
---
There‚Äôs literally no situation where there‚Äôs 4 gens to go foh
---
Did you know that i been to hell and back to hell

Make your choice, BBQ (pretty standard for every killer), nurse's calling, and rancor. Ruin is nice too if you're not a fan of rancor.

Have you not noticed they don't make any more licensed ones since they released the cosmetic shop?
---
They obviously want to monetize each new killer by making more cosmetics for them.
---
They know know to to business, but you apparently don't.   
---
It's just not worth the time wasted , and the money they will have to pay for copyrights , to make a licensed killer when they can easily make an original one and give them the power that a licensed could have and keep making for cosmetics for them and make way more money than a licensed would make.
---
Original killer will make them more money , it's that simple.

---

---
That is what I meant. was a gen fully repaired after she put the trap on you? if the answer is no then it is not a bug, that‚Äôs how it works. A gen needs to be completed after the trap has been put on your head, doesn‚Äôt matter if you are hooked or downed or in a chase, if a gen is completed and you are trapped the timer will tick when it is appropriate to. That persons trap was ticking because the generator had been completed while they had a trap on their head. Your teammates must have seen you were trapped for so long and just decided not to pop the gen and just 99% it.

Who you calling pinhead?

As someone still learning how to main Doctor (with Doctor being the only killer I have experience with) I imagined that Monitor and Abuse wasn't that great because Treatment Mode is better the bigger the terror radius is, isn't it? I know that the "abuse" part of M&amp;A extends the radius during a chase, but is the trade off worth it? At some point you have to switch to Punishment Mode eventually.
---
OH I had no idea that's how that works. Thanks!

---
I‚Äôm a survivor main and I see so many survivor DCs. I played three back to back games with survivor DCs...one even had two in the same game. So frustrating. 
---
Yoo this would be amazing!
---
I never said there was, as it stands currently the killer has more control over the match until an actual standoff occurs. Once that happens the survivor has won and this is an issue. 
---
The hatch exists for two reasons, firstly to provide a means of escape for the last survivor so they don‚Äôt feel helpless and just hide for 20 minutes.
---
The second reason is to allow the survivor who did everything they were supposed to but still, ‚Äúlost,‚Äù due to bad teammates.
---
If there were no gens left when hatch spawned then there would be no need for hatch in the first place. It would provide a somewhat safer escape than opening a gate but that‚Äôs already relatively safe unless you‚Äôre against a billy or nurse. 
---
Played a game ~10min ago as killer and 2 of them DC when I downed them then they started trash talking and spamming me with chat invites. 
---
Gotta love this game
---
Im slow I was about to say micheal would make a good slasher...
---
I believe survivors that d/c do more damage than the killer themselves. I usually suck it up then try to engage the Legion player but people getting pissed then leaving don't help our odds and the bullying toward Legion players is disgusting. Voice your dismay toward the character but don't harass people or screw over your teammates in a game.
---
The problem with letting whoever finds it first comes in two pieces. One being that the killer already has an easier time finding hatch, and two being that if the killer closes the hatch the final survivor loses all hopes of escape and has no reason to do anything but hide and wait the killer out. It would create and even worse type of standoff in which the killer spends 20 minutes hoping to find an immersed survivor.
---
I do agree it should be a challenge for both sides but you must realize that in your idea the killer has a significantly smaller chance of losing than the survivor making the challenge drastically smaller for them. 
---
Unlucky
---
100% I use it as a perk that gives extra BP, but occasionally will grant me the luck of a distant silhouette as well. 
---
‚ÄúDid all three others get in lockers?‚Äù
---
I definitely agree that people who disconnect and flame Legion players are a part of the problem. Well put. 
---
It just feels like its too much of a bail out on its current state dho, like at least with 0 gens there is a standpoint from where you actually did enough on the game as a team to get it, but there can be 3 gens to go and the hatch is there.
---
That's an improvement for 4 out of 5 people

Personal attack? Bitch its a joke
---
Do you guys know each other?
---
What would you suggest I do then? Say we both get to the hatch at the same time, how would I survive in your idea? 
---
This, but farming can also be when the killer and survivors co-operate to get loads of bloodpoints instead of having an intense match.
---
madness
---
thank
---
Oooooh true,forgot about this usage
---
I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE UNAWARE THAT THE TIMER STOPS WHEN THE SURVIVOR'S IN CHASE, SO THEY HOPE FOR IT TO POP OFF MID-CHASE
---
Honestly, man, just play legion however you want. There are people that are going to be mad just for going against a legion killer, and you shouldn't feel like you've wasted your money. So, play whichever way you have fun. 
---
As far as your question, the way to avoid being "toxic" as legion is to not keep going after the same person you stab with your power, but your basically throwing the game if you do that. But, that's how I would avoid being toxic if I really wanted to. 
---
Dont avoid it. Embrace it. Sure karma will kick in but it's just a video game 
---
My bad. I can't decipher your tone over text and this fanbase is already hostile as fuck.
---
[You know what you must do](https://i.redd.it/smrh57ruvka21.png)
---

---
Go. Do. A. Gen.
---
There really isn‚Äôt a way to not kinda be a douche with legion. The way their power is designed you can‚Äôt do well while also being a, ‚Äúfriendly killer,‚Äù so just play how you want. 
---
All I ask is you don‚Äôt run bloodhound and moonwalk and don‚Äôt run franks mixtape. 
---
So, you should win automatically when you kill 3 survivors? If you say yes to that, then I guess we don't need the hatch.
---
Just wanted to add on to your useful info! Hopefully this will help the OP.
---
Not really. If the hatch opens the killer has already pipped, but the survivor may not have so it makes sense for them to go for the garunteed escape instead of trying to do gens 1v1
---
Only time when it‚Äôs ok to facecamp,when survivors teabag you or lagswitch
---
And if the killer follows you? 
---
Understandable 
---
aww well thank you for calling it wellmade :)
---
BBQ and Chili gives you double bp. Not that inadequate.
---
Imagine if you ran this perk and could challenge the killer to play pok√©mon cards as a distraction. Too OP please nerf.
---
Not all hex‚Äôs are meant to be hidden. There are bad spawns and there are good spawns. 
---
ah thank you, i had some other killers in mind for some other songs!
---
Chad Legion time
---
Look ‚Äòa that lad. Absolute unit.
---
What the hell is wrong with these people? The dude didn't even have to put this shit up. 
---
They already confirmed 720 30 FPS but I doubt it will actually hit 30
---
If they can't fix console fps problems then why the fuck did they decide to this
---
but didn't they just say they were working on optimization?? if they can get it playable on switch i think it means they're working on optimization but bla bla bhvr bad or something
---
Toxicity with legion is more moonwalking than anything. 
---
Everything except for the 4th and 5th is basically what people were proposing for Legion the day they were released. I know that Behavior has stated that Bleedout ticking down during a chase was "unfun in playtesting" but they never actually let the players come to that conclusion.
---
Mending should at least require skill checks or save progress if you stop the action. **Not both.** As it is currently it's far too easy to get rid of. Adding skill checks would be more interactive, and also give a use for the Button addons which are currently completely worthless.
---
Exactly. This is why survivor mains need to play as killer often. Some of the shit that these survivor mains come up with is annoying as fuck. Same goes for killer mains. They need to play as survivor often. 
---
Devs need to make it mandatory for players to play both the sides often. That's the only way they will know what problems the other side faces.
---
I never knew that. im newer and people I play with must be new too because they love ganging up on gens
---
Why not make the pig a big sister then? Would make a bit more sense
---
Not gonna lie I completely forget that they existed 
---
That spirit is dumb as fuck then. The fact that she thought that she can rancor you just because you use DS is so stupid. Rancor is a cancerous perk.
---
&gt;Post about DS and NOED
---
&gt;duck and cover
---
&gt;nice conversation about the actual post content
---
&gt;maybe there is hope.
---
Of course it makes sense for them to escape, but if you didn‚Äôt escape in time/find the hatch first then whos to blame? So you stand there for 20 mins? 
---
It's ARK 2.0, these devs are actually autistic. They can't be bothered to fix PC/console optimization and now they're bringing it to a completely underpowered mobile platform. If DbD was made by competent people it would probably manage 30fps no problem on the Switch and easy 60 on console, but it's BHVR we're talking about here. Even if they outsourced the port it will still be a disaster because the core code is trash.
---
I would have just exited the match
---
/u/not_queen is gonna voice the switch exclusive killer....waluigi!
---
This perk +dying light + butcher+ legion = super aids
---
Completely agree. It‚Äôs very satisfying to dismantle one of the most annoying tactics that new killers use. Running a train of people to prevent the injured player getting hit again is another one of my faves as it‚Äôs often employed to unhook a camper survivor.
---
To be fair that was a really bad trap. Had he put it a few inches closer to the pallet it would've actually properly blocked it.
---
But placing a trap (without setting tools which it doesn't seem he has) is about as fast as breaking the pallet so he should've just broke it.
---
I don't have any problems with the Hatch.
---
When I play Killer I don't care about kills; so I usually lead the last guy to the Hatch, if it comes to that, and I never let a Hatch standoff happen, as it's just a boring and pointless ego contest.
---
When I play Survivor I play solo or in a two person SWF, so if anyone gets the Hatch instead of getting all 5 gens, it's because half my teammates farmed each other, fed a Camper instead of doing gens, or DC'ed.
---
In general I don't there's anything wrong with the last Survivor getting to Escape because the group got a portion of their objectives done, especially since the Killer has multiple ways to try and prevent Hatch escapes if they so choose. Doctor especially can just slug the 3rd person and walk around opening lockers in treatment mode until he finds the last person.
---
The Switch could handle RE7 if it was handled by the people who made the Wolfenstein/Doom ports. RE7 will run at 80+fps on a 1050 ti for Christ's sake, it's really not a demanding game aside from VRAM usage.
---
&gt;THEN WOULDNT IT MAKE SENSE TO FARM OR PLAY ABOUT FOR A BIT
---
IT WOULDN'T, ACTUALLY. A 1V1 IS ZERO FUN AND REALLY BAD FARMING. YOU'RE BETTER OFF JUST GETTING IT OVER WITH AND FINDING ANOTHER GAME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
---
THINK OF IT AS A MERCY KILLING.
---

---
Total cutie 
---
No. If the core code is trash and barely works on its main platform and console then it will 100% not work on a weaker mobile platform. Some games like Doom are a miracle on Switch, but DbD already runs like shit on PC. There's nothing that they, or a porting company, can do to make the game run better. BHVR is incompetent.
---
"Discover the true meaning of horror when Dead by Daylight creeps up on Nintendo Switch this Fall."
---
Yeah, I'll be horrified with how horrible that port is going to be. 
---
I‚Äôm guessing you only like that as survivor?
---
It lets you know if more than one survivor is on a gen. Tink lets you know if a gen is almost complete. So yes, they are similar. And both are fair 
---
BHVR literally doesn't give a shit about DbD. Even the jewtransactions in the shop are mostly low quality, they can't even be bothered to properly rig or model their cosmetics.
---
Shreiker looking like a killer version of the crow
---
Thx I won‚Äôt 
---
lol that made me laugh 
---
They don't LMAOOO have you seen the state of DbD's cosmetics? Especially the survivor ones are all of piss-poor quality holy hell Nea's new hairstyle fucking clips through her skull because the people working on the game can't be bothered to properly do their work. You're paying TEN bucks for an outfit that looks like shit and is broken. Shitty trousers, shitty jacket and broken hair. Even if you just buy the hair alone that's still 400 cells which is 4 euro get a load of yourself you dense idiot.
---
Didn‚Äôt nurse and doc already get a set together?
---
But also easy to exploit of the survivors are dicks. This game is a pendulum of players being dicks to each other and screaming at the devs until it's changed.
---
I agree that it was a bit of an odd placement.
---
I saw that he placed the trap a little further than usual so I kinda just went for it. Figured I could give my spectating buddy a little laugh before I die.
---
Man i hope so
---
Not having cross play will probably be the death of this version of the game

---
"Graphics look flat". I have an i5 4460 and a 1060 6GB in my system and can't even run this game on high/ultra anymore because of how badly they fucked up optimization. Even before that optimization wasn't great, but it's way worse now. The game looks like total ass and the devs do not know how to properly adjust ANY of the particle effects and other graphical features. And no I won't just play on low/medium, because even on medium the game looks awful. Even shorter LODs and shadows are as thick as your mom's ass. Want to configure graphics? Well no you fucking can't, not even through the cfg file cause they locked that down. Changes to the config file's graphics lines will not apply to the game even when put on read-only.
---
It looks like fucking 20fps look at that shit.
---
no Kills "can" be a win, but only if you Max out everything you can.
---
And if you really think Killer is easier than Survivor...well
---
Entity I'm trying to sneak around but I'm dummy thicc and the clap of my butt cheeks keeps alerting the killers/survivors
---
Possibly between consoles, but never between consoles and PC. PC players would have an overwhelming advantage.
---
You actually can if you stand at it as a survivor and simply don't repair. 
---
Neat gif though
---
The Switch is more modern than last gen, but severely underpowered. If you want to see how an unoptimized PC game fares on the Switch look no further than ARK. Both ARK and DbD are horribly optimized on all platforms including PC and a Switch port will not magically run any better.
---
thanks that is good to know.
---
ahm...that was more sarcasm than anything else. He isn't fast, he has nothing to stop loops, after wake up you have to wait till you can hit him again.
---
The only positive aspects are, that you see people , who already escaped you, but a good team just wakes him up and that's that AND that you get 1 free hit, if the team doesn't run when they hear the song
---
Not OP but I looked at their Etsy. They're made of wood!
---
This made me laugh harder than it should have, good job.
---
Smooth Criminal Legion was never intended. This community is just spectacular at finding cheese and abusing it. The only reason they haven't patched it is because they can't figure out how to do it without making Borrowed Time from a crutch to a powered wheelchair.since they stupidly added the deep wound mechanic.
---
Exactly what you said, if a swf is really coordinated and strong against Freddy there's literally nothing you can do about it, but going against foreheads Freddy is fine. I use him at rank 1 and I do fine
---
The last Survivor has to avoid the Killer and find the Hatch. Sure hiding's not that big of a deal for a Claudette, but there is definitely a substantial element of risk and reward involved when the Hatch is the only way out.
---
Unless the Survivors are in a SWF, I don't see an issue with the Hatch spawning after they get 2 generators done: Survivors have almost no communication outside of a few perks and they're not in control of their teammates. Getting 5 gens done is hard if you're the only one doing them. 
---
That aside, IIRC the devs are trying to balance the game around an average of 2ks a trial, meaning almost every game should end with at least one person Escaping and at least one person dying. A 3k should already be an outstanding victory.
---
So the oldest trick in the book is that he put other traps on the map.  Dude...don't worry about it - this wasn't a trick, it was just good map pressure on part of trapper.

Switch is more powerful than a PS3 though and more importantly has modern features thanks to the Tegra chipset. It's also severely underpowered, but considering Warframe can run on it FF should be able to run on it too. In the end it would be a bad decision to split development time so I see where you are coming from, but people would just like to see it on the Switch.
---
I have fun with the pig, Freddy, and legion the most with some clown in there, but it's up to you
---
If only the switch had an edge to edge screen like in your pic. 
---
And as much criticism as this port is getting right now, with my unlimited hotspot and hour long bus commute I am so stoked!!!
---
*excited blink squealing!!!!!!*
---
The killer almost always finds it first 
---
It's aimed for Fall which is several months after the big Optimization patch and dedicated servers get added. I actually think people are overreacting a little bit.
---
No matter what you do or how you do it someone will complain. That's the nature of games like this. There was a point in time where survivors thought the wraith was broken. Play whatever and however is fun for you. You're not their dungeon master and it isn't your job to insure they're having fun. Rest assured, they won't be insuring yours while they blast those gens and teabag you at an exit gate. And then proceed to tell you how shit you are after the game. Give em 28 stab wounds and never look back.
---
This post... It is illegal how funny it is.

Fuck you, sir. For my sides hurt. 
---
I'm with this. 
---
I love the Hag. Absolutely love her. Hated her for the longest time and never gave her a fair shake. She had a quality of life adjustment a little while ago, and since then, she's been a blast to play. Really good defense, so you don't feel like you're down late game, great perks, and a smol unit that changes up your perspective as killer. You just need to remember to set up traps like a mad woman, even if you need to give up chase. Without traps, she's on par with Meg. 
---
Huntress or Doc, definitely. 
---
to be fair when you're playing survivor, you're running into three times as many survivors as you are killers per a match. Then when you're playing killer you have 4 possible survivor disconnects and 0 possible killer disconnects (unless you disconnect yourself)
---
so in short it just sorta makes sense you see a lot more survivor disconnects than killer
---
All the original DLC?  You'll get the free ones, but no way in hell will you get the paid ones. You'll need to use shards or buy it from the eShop.
---
were did u get that coin, i whant one 
---
Now that I know my favorite perks I can level up the right way. I‚Äôm gonna have P3L50 and all perks tier 3 on all characters eventually, but it‚Äôll be way more efficient this time around. 
---
Can't wait for every goddamn Nurse to have the Bird Box head.
---
Yeah, but DS is a lot less situational than NOED, I think they need to do something to make it up to killer mains. How about apologizing for poor killer design by making Legion free?

Whoa you made that? That‚Äôs awesome
---
tenacity is so under rated tbh. Killer walks away for 2 seconds to kick a gen and you've already crawled to a different map
---
This isn't Epic Games.  BHVR can barely port their game. There will never be cross platform or cross accounts. 
---
Seeing that picture for the first time was hilariousüòÇ
---
Damn shame really. Its already a multiplayer only game, might as well
---
use it with Balanced Landing so you can bamboozle the killer twice
---
the second bamboozle always hits harder
---
Imagine this hypothetical situation: 
---
You're playing a game of Dead by Daylight; you're playing without a SWF but things are going okay; you and a Dwight have just done a gen together and someone is only now getting hooked by a Tier 2 Michael.
---
As you start to get mid-way through your 2nd gen you notice that the hooked guy is still hooked. You then see another person go down. You and Dwight rush to the hook, hoping for a quick Leader heal, only to see Michael Myers hook someone within eyesight of the first hook. Michael doesn't leave, he's using Insidious, so you can't Borrowed Time save even though you have that perk, and he may have Tier 3 ready.
---
Knowing that the only way to deal with Campers is to rush gens, you and Dwight work on generators. You manage to get 60% on your 3rd before the 2nd hooked Survivor finally dies. **Thank goodness both Hooked Survivors were team players** and both let the full Hook Timer tick down instead of DC'ing or suiciding.
---
As you finish the gen Michael arrives and chases Dwight. Dwight is very good at chases and you actually manage to finish the 3rd gen and get half-way through another before he goes down to Michael.
---
This time Michael leaves the Hook, because he knows there's only one person left besides Dwight, and if you rescue Dwight he'll know where everyone is.
---
**Thankfully for you Dwight is a team player**, and kills himself so that you can get the Hatch.
---
Unfortunately, the Hatch was reworked so that it only spawns when all gens are done. With only 4 possible gens to work on, you either stealth around the map trying to get them finished while Michael patrols them or you crouch around the map hoping Michael will get bored and DC.
---
Eventually Michael finds you, Tier 3s on you, and then downs and kills you.
---
**You deserved to die because your team was bad.**
---
Here's the problem. You tell him in order to do (essentially), you need to be a douche because it's inherent in Legion's kit. However, you go on to tell him to limit his douche. A douche is a douche is a douche. He needs to either have a tough skin and run a muck, or drop Legion. Right now, playing Legion is the equivalent to Insta-medkit DS running Claudette. You're already hated, no need to pretend you're something else. 
---
oink oink
---
Did you know death didn't except me so I never went to hell?
---
That‚Äôs why I pretty much never play killer. Too much hate mail and salty survivors. :/ 
---
What? 
---
Nea's tho
---
Nice
---
Only key rework I want to see is the green key having a purpose when looted in game
---
It's semantics, but I wasn't attacking you or saying you're wrong. Legion is just too funky at the moment. It really is the equivalent of the super toxic squad. Sometimes you'll 4 man the toxic squad, but it's never fun. Sure, Legion is very beatable, but be in for utter annoyance. 
---
GET OUT OF HERE! 
---
I‚Äôm chill with being made fun of my guy, I just wanna be the least toxic I can for the gameplay experience of other people
---
New pig buff seems interesting huh ?
---
Are you implying up/down speeds aren't directly linked to latency? Ping isn't entirely reliant on distance.
---
You don‚Äôt have to max everything that‚Äôs a time waste (I haven‚Äôt seen any data to compare but I think farming is a waste and some people, like moi, don‚Äôt like it). And I think I‚Äôve seen baby killers get 4ks (camping and tunneling) but if you‚Äôre a bad survivor the only way you leave is pity and/or your team carrying you.
---
Good meme
---
Uncultured swine. That is an A pose.
---
Honestly, people are going to hate Legion no matter what. Play him as you see fit. From a survivor's perspective, it's going to be toxic inherently to even play him. Play like you would any other killer, which is the optimal way based on his strengths and tune out the static from everyone else. All else fails, pick up Mikey. He's pretty beloved. 
---
I think it‚Äôs about even. When I play everyone‚Äôs near the 20ks but average it‚Äôs usually high killer and then low, mid, mid, high for survivors.
---
Franks mixtape is legit just making the survivors die as soon as they load in
---
Nice.
---
FKING RANK RESET,  PLAYED WITH ALL THE ASSHEAD FROM THE HIGH RANKS WHO WILL JUST FARM YOU WITH THE KILLER. EVEN RESORT TO SANDBAGGING U AT A PALLET.
---
Thank you so much for the help! I‚Äôm still learning the terminology and I didn‚Äôt realize there were so many in this video game. That makes a lot more sense
---
*exp from Noob Lvl 1 to Noob lvl 2*
---
Huh... wonder how this will play out.. :/
---
Imagine that chasing you AHH

Shut up autist.

I would not mind if both of these perks were removed

Well, I tried to be reasonable!

I'm REALLY feeling it

it's not tho. the switch's wifi capabilities are EXTREMELY limited.

I do not care to argue. Suggesting, stating or joking about physically harming them is **not ok**, and will not be tolerated on /r/deadbydaylight.
---
I'm out of coins dammit. This is the funniest shit I've seen all year.
---
Wait, was the hag not free?
---
Listen buddy, we here at dead by daylight could fix this and many other bugs but...switch release soon boys WOOHOO
---
I choose to be the fingergunning boi
---
Poor optimization. Dbd's graphics aren't even that great, even a Ps3 or Xbox360 could handle that.
---
I‚Äôd buy a Switch just to play as Mario in DbD. 
---
To be fair, that perk encourages positive altruistic play, but people just use it to gain a benefit while sandbagging their teammates. 
---
I feel like with 7 others I'd still get left on hook. 
---
guys help im on a date and shes so cute i dont know what to say
---
PS4/Xbone got the non licensed DLC included in the base game for a higher buy in. Switch will certainly do the same.
---
Wait wait they're working on a switch version?! 
---
You can't win him in a chase he either moonwalks and lets you bleed out or hits over and over again. There is no cpunter play exept running
---
He's annoying and boring to play against, and basically all you do is get stabbed-mend-heal-repeat; then there's  the moonwalking / bloodtracking, which is sort of an exploit. Games against him take longer time, Frank's mixtape exists and a lot of people just don't like the lore of the character (how the Legion are a bunch of murderous teens) 
---
Yes they do. To both of those. A lot of pig players save a trap for after the gates pop specifically because of how powerful it is.
---
Trapper x me whenüëÖüí¶
---
This is the first bird box meme thats actually made me laugh 
---
Oh ffs way to port the game instead of make it not suck.
---
This is definitely better than being right across from the generator. Huge improvement.
---
Also don't be surprised (thus happened in my game) I had to let someone finish the generator in front of me, you can't pull someone off the gen to mori
---
I WAS SITTING IN THE GREEN RANKS A WEEK AGO AFTER NOT PLAYING MUCH SURVIVOR SINCE THE JANUARY RESET AND AT LEAST HALF THE GAMES THAT WE WOULD HAVE MULTIPLE ESCAPES HAD SURVIVORS STANDING AT THE GATES WAITING TO TEA BAG THE KILLER THAT WOULD NEVER COME OVER SO THEY WOULD GIVE UP AND FINALLY LEAVE. ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS SEE THE KILLERS PERKS AND INSTEAD HAD TO SPECTATE THESE SURVIVORS STAND AT AN OPEN GATE TEA BAGGING NOTHING FOR 5 MINUTES. ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS JUST WHY WOULD YOU WASTE YOUR TIME DOING THAT. 
---
r/humblebrag
---
Credit to u/ZombieHuggerr for template
---
Cant wait for dedicated servers so mr ping pong from southern moonbase gamma isnt the killer and have 2k ping 
---
When you hook a survivor you get 1 stack up to five stacks. 1-4 hooks, increasingly delayed skillcheck warning. 5 stacks, no skillcheck warning.
---
Ummmmm, someone else want to take this one?
---
As a trap main, let me tell you that when a survivor is running and you have a trap in the corner of a building, they gonna look there and waste some sprint, thus giving you a hit
---
Circa, basement corner stairs trap
---
I'm getting so many Jackie Chan Adventures talisman vibes from this.
---
Lol having produced YouTube Rewind it‚Äôs hilarious to me this is still happening 
---
Devotion 3 level 7. Nice! I'm near devotion 1.
---
Eh you chose to play a game with 600 ping, just leave if thats the case
---
Huntress's Lullaby has the same problem that Devour Hope does. Both are late game focused perks, but with totem spawns being what they are, they hardly ever last that long. But while Devour Hope has the potential to be the single best perk in the game after once it builds up, Huntress's Lullaby is *still* just a worse Ruin. There just isn't any reason I can think of to run it outside of very specific builds on the Doctor, but even then there are better options.
---
They have these at my local target as well
---
Man was it weird to see DBD on a Nintendo console.
---
Fire the $$$ team, you say?   And and hire a second $ team?!
---
Weird. I use it pretty commonly just to slow the game. Usually I get a few minutes of use.
---
Dedicated servers will fix this but ofc if you are not from NA/Asia/EU you should not play killer
---
Nah dude you're fine people are quick to assume the worst in people without much to go on. I didn't give enough to go on like how I checked their profiles and the two rank 20's had less than 20hours and even the higher ranked ones didn't have more than 200hours so I'm guessing they smurf a lot or got banned before. 
---
I refuse to play any game with over 40 ping these days
---
I want a switch so I can play on the go. 
---
All good, it‚Äôs just a quality of life improvement haha
---
These have been patched. 
---
Unless you‚Äôre playing doc, it doesn‚Äôt do much past rank 10. It isn‚Äôt hard to just stare at the middle of your screen and wait for skill checks. 
---
I like using Lullaby and Overcharge on Freddy. Gens regress faster since survivors want to miss the skillchecks on them.
---
You monster
---
On Freddy? Why would you want them to fail skillchecks whule playing Freddy?
---
ANOTHER LEGION BAD POST 
---
True. But aome people don't have as quick reflexes.
---
PLEASE DON'T HATE ME I ACTUALLY KIND OF LIKE THEM
---
Hag is *not* free to play on PC
---
Just was in a game where the totem was across from a gen. So yeah... 
---
Because then the generator regresses more.
---
They can patch all they want. Some malicious person will still find a way.
---
But as Freddy, they would wake up. Then you wouldn't be able to hit them.
---
Ds requires skill, can be used once and the killer has a chance to come back.
---
Noed requires no skill, op as fuck and can end a survivors game.
---
I love them both. 
---
More like Zelda
---
I have a theory that the entity is real and its actually BHVR feeding off of the playerbases' misery.
---
...then you put them to sleep again. The main goal is to slow gens down. Needing to right click on a survivor again is a small price to pay for more game time.
---
I guess.
---
I just want DC'd survivors to count towards my BBQ&amp;C when they die
---
Someone ran the potential profit numbers and they assume they can actually pull off optimization 
---
[If only.](https://www.strawpoll.me/17318604/r)
---
They're going to be trying to fail skillchecks anyway to be woken up. Might as well punish them more for it
---
Your mother is twelve.
---
biggest change that annoys me the most is the sky and horizon. it used to be a pretty sunset, sky was purple/orange and if you looked carefully you could see palm trees in the distance. they also got rid of most fences and some bushes, it is such a naked map now. smh
---
Sure they are only one has use 100% of the time other not so much! But they are "the same" ;)
---
I played 10 games and nobody had it ;-;  bloodweb hates me so I still dont have it on my killer of choice

I understand survivors hating L√©ry's, but a killer not liking L√©ry's??? The indoor maps are most killers' wet dream.
---
Hag and Spirit are the strongest DLCs ones, Leatherface has the best teachables (mainly BBQ, but Knockout is strong too)
---
It‚Äôs ok, we‚Äôre all allowed to share our thoughts.
---
puppers?
---
Farming is tunneling but done instantly, and the surv unhooking is also farming.
---
Tunneling is just continuously focusing 1 surv.
---
i kinda feel attacked bc i use controller on pc 
---
No :( killers are meant to patrol gens when hooked even if you know survivors are there!!!! wtf camper :((((
---
Well that escalated quickly lol
---
Wait wtffff is dbd coming to switch. My PC broke so I havent played since last year. I'm bout to cry
---
it's so good! 
---
Only limited-time ones, because Qs would die permanently otherwise and alternative modes should have a gimmick to them that makes them fun, but shouldn't be as general as normal modes.

---
Lol right? I was honestly baffled. I never expected any of my traps to work on The Game, and really never expected for all three of the others to come running in.
---
The hatch itself fine, keys should not exist though in my honest opinion, or should at least not be possible to loot from chests.
---
How bored are you really?
---
DBD is not a team-game by default, it's more like a (1v1v1v1) vs 1 where teamwork is helpful most of the time.
---
Ding dong your judgement is wrong.
---
I like the power and the first 2 perks but On the Prowl seems a bit unbalanced, especially because the chase system is a bit broken. And i'm not a fan off adding a real life serial killer
---
i do this to baby survivors. had a default dwight with flashlight just the other day, he was hiding in lockers and stuff, too precious. 
---
I choose to be optimistic. I'm hoping updates to the online service will be out by then. 
---
This, if you wanna waste an hour looking for the last surv instead of just being happy with a 3k then be my guest but I highly doubt you'd enjoy that.
---
Don‚Äôt buy the cosmetics then
---
You really put fucking MYERS AS one of the most difficult mates, and nurse into C?! This mate has some mental issues
---
THIS GAME IS JUST BAD. IVE PLAYED BETTER GAMES THAT ARE FREE TO PLAY! I WANT MY MONEY BACK..
---
Less effort with doctor though :) that's what I'm hoping anyway lol
---
A little late posting this one, eh?
---
Whenever possible I bring speed and duration addons to play with the "spread the pain" way they were supposed to be played. 
---
Dwight the Locker Johnson
---
Not to mention some supreme virgins actually downvote and hate on legion fanart, just because it's legion. 
---
I was just suggesting incase you got tired of Doc after a few rounds, give a 2nd to run around with an still get mad BP :)
---
If you aren't injured then you're 100% safe if the gates are already open. That is unless you make the common mistake of running to a pallet instead of the gate after getting hit which I never really understood what the thought process of that was. Like the gates open just run out with the speed boost the killer gives you when he hits you, don't waste it running to a pallet just to stand there and stare at the killer 
---
Play freddy on a PS4 (not pro) dude. The only time you get 30fps is when you are standing still.
---
How about a good killer on a more powerful console (Xbox one X)
---
Happy cake day
---
I dont think I'll ever get tired of hearing the screams of people ;) I've just got to get lucky and get bbq on doc
---
Likely next week, because the week after will probably be the next ptb. 
---
This is only an estimate, btw. But it‚Äôs based on past ptb launches. Clown, Spirit, and Legion all started their ptbs on the last Tuesday of the month. End of February will be 3 months since Legion ptb started.
---
Also all datamined cosmetics are for that particular half of the chapter. We are in the second part of the Legion chapter (mid-chapter patch), and Bike Messenger Dwight was mined from that update. 
---
Those juicy Mario morios
---
Wow really? Thanks for telling me haha
---
You did a gen you already better then most rank 1 survivors
---
&gt;
---
&gt;**Can we expect the same level graphic quality for the Switch Version than Ps4 / Xbox?**
---
&gt;We will offer the highest level of quality possible to maintain a good balance between performance and quality while respecting the hardware capabilities
---
Bullshit. 
---
If they made thana work with killed survivors, it would be interesting if they‚Äôd also include, say, a Left Behind buff (since it‚Äôs now one of the worst survivor perks).
---
Plot twist: This is the most optimized version of the game, even more than PC!
---
Instead they'll just get matched with people who have 1000 ping
---
Sale prices are irrelevant. Especially ones for entirely different platforms. Base game MSRP is $20, and original chapters MSRP is $7, amounting to $35 MSRP. So a definitive version at $40/$50 is less than MSRP.
---
This is great.
---
So you're okay with Legion being a 5-hit down? Screw that.
---
I'd go as far as to say make FMT base, nerf the pther add-ons and make missed swings end the frenzy.
---
Goddamn splicers!
---
They've literally promised a optimazition patch for the last half of 2018 and then lied (badly) at the dead line. So yeah, it wont happen.
---
Doctor and Shape tilt me the most.
---
yeah! I really enjoy playing him. Lots of stabby stab and chasing many people at once! 
---
"Pretty good jo%%U¬§$(("!¬®\^\_c&amp;&amp;!$"
---
You're still 1 hit. It isn't that hard to hit someone once even if you're 110% speed
---
I downvoted no one wtf 
---
anyone know when we can expect to see helmet dwight?
---
That's too good
---
I watch survivor streams just for their sweet sweet reactions.
---
The engine update was meant to be the optimisation patch, but it didn't go as planned (because BHVR tried to jump 3 versions of the Unreal Engine at once), so they attempted to cover their arses by saying it was an "optimisation PASS".
---
Now they say more "passes" will start in Spring (March-May)
---
^ The only answer. Tbh, at this point I'd settle for a Bunny Beanie on Feng üê∞
---
Adrenaline, DS, Bond, and Balanced Landing
---
Wasn't this planned for Autumn?
---
I assume the summer patch with servers might also improve the console fps, or include a giant overhaul of the base-spaghetti, which could potentially make it sustainable.
---
It's also not impossible that the lag is caused by having to host it.
---
I'm not sure if you know this or not, but are you calling him a noob because he's standing still? Mike's power is stalking, and he becomes extremely powerful for a limited time when he stalks enough.
---
RANK RESET IS LIKE: CAMPING, TUNNELING, 5 GENS LEFT, WHO CARES?? I EVEN WAS ONCE NICE TO A KILLER IN THE AFTERCHAT, COMPLIMENTING HOW WELL HE DID AND GOT 5 MINUTES OF "NOOB SURVIVOR, I KILLED YA, 4K, LOOK AT ME YOU STUPID ASSHOLES" I. LOVE. THIS. GAME. &lt;3
---
The ultimate 10 fps experience
---
No I'm not calling him a noob. That would be me. Hence asking for advice
---
Why fix the game when you can add even MORE store fodder?
---
Hey just wanted to chime in saying if you want to ask a question ask it, dumb people are the ones that don't ask they don't learn anything
---
My point is the game goes on sale a lot, same with the DLC, I don't really want to pay for a 2nd version that's not as good 'cause finding internet to play it away from the house isn't really worth it especially if it doesn't go to your one save file.
---
Why not just automatically jump off if hitting that skillcheck doesn't require skill?
---
No
---
Pay attention to your surroundings so as not to give him free stalk. If he is chasing you try and move in a way there are things blocking line of sight on you so again he can't just stalk you.   
---
One of the hardest things with Michael is learning all the different ways in which he can be played, e.g. spooky/jump scare myers is when he can't go past tier 1 so has no heartbeat and it can be paired with the ability to see auras when stalking so he can rip you off gens. You can work this stuff out by observing how they play, if the Myers is not hitting anyone but constantly stalking and it's taking ages for him to tier up then he either has infinite tier 3 or one of the more deadly builds infinite tier 3 with a tombstone so he can just mori you the moment he catches you. I also think their is a way to tell if they have a certain add-on based on if his hand is open but I can't remember which add-on, I think tombstone.   
---
I really enjoy playing against Myers as he is one of the more diverse killers so you never know what your going to get.   
---
You get player leave points and the survivor gets nothing. More ofyen survivors are just suiciding on first hook rather than dc. They cant punish it anymore. Also its hardly a survivor only issue, half the time a killer is losing they ragequit
---
boiiiiiiii thats garbage, better level up that bloodweb

I really cannot believe some of the salt that gets spewed all the time in this game. I am sure survivors do it too but I mainly only see it from killers 99% of the time when it happens. 
---
Yesterday my friend and I were with two randoms  one of the randoms inadvertently led  Myers to me with exposed effect going so when he hung me he got me off and took the hit just as exposed was going away. 
---
I then got him off the hook and the other random and my friend body tanked for us since exposed was gone and we all escaped. 
---
We do the GG like every round even if we die and killer just unleashed toxic salt. How we were all swf and not as good as we thing and how we suck.  He really went after me friend because he got a flashlight out of a creat and saved a random with it. Also apparently GG in chat is now considered toxic as we have been attacked and called toxic for putting GG in the chat 
---
Are you sure they were swf? I had had many killers accuse us in end game chat of being swf when were are all randoms. I do play with friends too but I get accused of swf a lot even when not in swf.
---
There was a post here like a week ago from a player banned for this same exploit. Same consequences: lost progress on multiple characters, not only prestige ones.
---
So, I guess it's the price you have to pay.
---
highest priority, what a business can make: grab money first, think about consequenses later!
---
It‚Äôs worth buying an adapter for the dock to link directly to the router. Ive had a MUCH better online experience ever since. It‚Äôs still far from perfect, but it‚Äôs at least playable more often.
---
You know that the game has shitty LODs when you can see the terrain/props shift in a compressed AF video.
---
Double hag. Good bye. 
---
Oh no, god damn bhvr and their (totally game changing) cosmetics.
---
Good thing no other company does this and only bhvr are bad, right? 
---
Disclaimer:sarcasm. 
---
Traps work when you put them in random walk ways. I got a 4k because i put traps where pallets were and random little places that i walk in when im a survivor. I had one guy hooked next thing i know i leave and someone gets trapped at the hook someone's trapped near a pallet and another across the map. Trapper can be pretty good with proper add ons. 
---
She already sounds like a squeaky toy too, so no need to play a fart sound
---
30 fps is console standard...most ps4 games run on 30 for example 
---
I personally like the clown for farming
---
Your only looking at it from the perspective of a killer. You are not being rewarded for not doing gens you are given an escape hatch because 99% of the time their is no way one survivor is going to complete all the gens and then get the gate open without the killer finding them and once the killer does your dead.   
---
In theory the 4 survivors are supposed to be random and not communicate or know each other. If you play a game and the other 3 are total potatoes, you make saves, you do 2 gens but your whole team is massacred would it not be unfair that you then have to complete the remaining 3 alone and inevitably be caught and killed? Don't get me wrong the hatch mechanic is awful and both sides have complaints about it but I understand that it is essentially an escape hatch and it gives the last survivor, who again in theory should be the most competent, a chance to survive.   
---
The game has to be fun on both sides otherwise their will be no games to play and frankly as someone who plays survivor solo more than SWF I know if I was constantly being left with 3-1 gens to do and my team was useless I would get fed up and feel the game was more killer orientated. Also why waste 20 minutes of your life standing at the hatch? Is the 4k that important to you? When I play killer I just hit them and let them get hatch so I can play another game. I think that is a problem from a killer perspective that too many people feel anything but a 4k is a loss which just isn't the case. The same way survivors need to accept they won't always escape but at least you can do well and get a good haul of BP killers need to accept that a 3k is still pretty sweet.   
---
Doctor is the best to farm Deviousness points, not the best farmer overall since you will struggle to get points in the remaining categories and finally, to close the match. 
---
My favorite killer to farm is Nurse because you get Deviousness + Brutality + Hunting every TP and sacrifice points are pretty much guaranteed with her.
---
GPU is almost always on 99% cause you know, there‚Äòs always edges it can smooth out. That‚Äòs normal. 
---
CPU however...
---
Please use the [Megathread.](https://redd.it/aqchce)
---
you're an idiot if you think you need to down people in Frenzy like that.
---
Yea I would say calling it a team game is a stretch. The only time you see this game being 1 vs a team is SWF and anyone who plays killer knows how much of a nightmare that can be not to mention the amount of complaints that comms isn't fair and breaks the game.   
---
I saw the direct it looks super choppy. Just focus on making the game functional on other platforms first
---
**5 TIMES**
---
Oh my god infinite is beautiful and amazing, you should definitely play it!!
---
Copyright is my guess. 
---
I‚Äôm disappointed in the head. I thought the hair would be longer and thicker and red rather than auburn. They never seem to get hair right ever. It always looks like spaghetti. Also I wish her jaw was defined more.
---
Spine Chill, Urban Evasion,Sprint Burst or Dead Hard, Iron Will or Borrowed Time if I'm feeling altruistic 
---
I love Ace so much. His face is so fucking cute I want to kiss it all over.
---
Clearly, he needs more focus.
---
There better be another cool well done trailer or ima riot 
---
Back in undergrad, yeah! Thank you!
---
anyone know when this will be available
---
\*shrugs\* Eh, I figured it's the oldest trick in the book since The Trapper is a base-launch killer
---
*That and well, it wasn't my first time walking into a trap on a pallet like that.*
---
Thanks for sure! That trapper killed my friend off real quick and then headed for me, I looped for as long as I can. :p
---
Not every killer that plays noed is shitty, but every shotty killer plays noed. 
---
Upvote on the post because it made me laugh. Downvote on comment because of the typo. 
---
Keep making more :)
---
Can‚Äôt wait for the solid 10 FPS experience!
---
Seriously though, I have nothing against Switch, but considering how bad the performance of this game on PS4 and Xbone, The game being at 30 FPS sounds like a bullshit to me. I see you want the extra money but please for the love of god fix your damn game first.
---
But you also wasted precious time you could be doing gens, but you used it to find and cleanse totems instead. So noed still did it‚Äôs job.
---
been a console player all my life and switched to pc two months ago. in some intense moments when i don't feel confident enough with keyboard and mouse i switch to controller. rip 
---
I feel like I'm in a really small group or even the only one survivor that actually enjoys a fun challenge when killer plays specific strat builds 
---
I mean, why? people seem like that they would have enjoyed the game more if there was no killer at all, because they would win and survive every time
---
Lerys is great, the smallest map in the game 
---
I wonder what its gonna be like playing nurse on switch
---
WHATS WITH THE CAPSLOCK
---
I used to be console only like2 years ago. Unless it‚Äôs a fighting or racing game (never play racing games) I legit never use a controller, there just so weird to hold and so hard to do simple task with 
---
Nope.
---
Freaking geniues, well done ! 
---
Might be a stupid question but is it possible to blind Freddy whilst he‚Äôs carrying another survivor if you‚Äôre not in dream state? 
---
Yeah we do
---
I had this spot for hex ruin once got a 4k no gens done because they killed themselves trying to get it. Kept rushing it I kept hooking rinse and repeat.
---
Wglf - borrowed time - deliverance - self care
---
Get bp
---
Killer camping? Get 2 stacks from saving and taking a hit
---
Killer got you? Basically free unhook from deliverance and bt
---
Self care to make life easier
---
I change perks around so often. But I never use any Exhaustion perks or Decisive. Right now I'm running Bond, Botany, Stakeout, and Prove Thyself. Sometimes I'll run Small Game, or We'll make it or whatever. 
---
I hope your friends won after that
---
Base spirit is good enough. She's one of the best killers
---
Wait really ? I sworn I was hands on the box and the timer runs out in the middle of it, killing me instantly. Is it because I failed a skillcheck before ?
---
Hello lewis
---
Botany Knowledge doesn't affect how many times you can heal, it only makes it go faster
---
*Laughs in Fallout 76*
---
THE LAST THING HAPPENED TO ME, SOME ANGEL HAD CLEANSED THE TOTEM RIGHT BEFORE KILLER HITS ME, BUT IT WAS LAST WEEK :(
---
They recently bought themselves out of their publisher so that they can do everything themselves. if i'm correct it was about 1-3 mil dollars. They need to make that money back. 
---
What is ds
---
You clearly know best
---
I would assume snorting cocaine off the bellies of strippers they're getting with all their cosmetics money.
---
Her devious gain is decent naturally and because she doesn't suck like doctor, you can actually get very good sacrifice and gatekeeper points. If you play her "nice" and don't slug, tunnel or camp even if you have every reason to, you'll get very good chaser points as well. 
---
I'll use 5 FPS for the generators and 5 for escaping.
---
Damn, I guess that I could settle for Ace getting his mustache. 
---
Not really all that impressive when we know Chapters arrive every 3 months.
---
I'd go for a scott jund huntress: BBQ, Nurse's, whispers, ruin
---
But you can also go for an enduring, spiritfury  too to help you in m1 game and encourage you to chase longer
---
after deathgarden fiasco bhvr just wanna cute their loses with this
---
dont worry bhvr the game will be almost dead as it is on other consoles
---
u only will getting money from pc users
---
Coal Tower and the Swamp Maps
---
Sometimes Lerys and The Game Map as Survivor
---
As Killer I really Love Autohaven and every map that doesnt have a Giant Loop.
---
I hate every single High Grass Map.
---
Rank 1 Killer and Rank 10 Survivor
---
It's fine as it is.
---
Apparently the Switch version is going to run at 30fps but there is no doubt in my mind that isn't going to be true, or at the very least only for something like the menus and tutorials.
---
Of course you should be getting the 3 Lv. perks at first. However If you are unable to find any 3 Lv. Just get the 2 Lv. ones. Even if you are never gonna use it. If they appear again just purchase them again! Slowly you will encounter the ones you want. 
---
nintento players dont buy this game,in few months will be free anyway
---
This happens to me when I launch the game through my taskbar shortcut because EAC doesn't load. Launching directly from my Steam library fixes it.
---
The keyword here is improving. Meaning there is more to do.
---
As i said, it's not op. It's poorly designed
---
This sub is directing this meme straight to his inevitable death
---
Crosses grow on Anzio
---
Freddy's most dangerous when he doesn't tunnel, and spreads sleep around, if he doesn't hit you, you will be forced to break out of dream without SC, meaning breaking a gen over and over (just as easy to put someone to sleep as it is to get out if not easier) or finding someone (which if the Freddy pays attention to the aura is a extra guy in dream), Freddy actually has *really* good stall when played that way
---
tunning is the worst way to play him since it gives him zero pressure as everyone's awake and doing gens, also bad chase so rip if you end up being taken to barn or something.
---
by spreading out you can target survivors who run into less safe spots via aura whilst slowly draining the maps pallets from the stall, making more dead zones to abuse.
---
And this is your Nintendo Switch on doctor: ***Explodes***
---
This will likely be a thing of the past when BHVR institutes its plans for solo players to see what the other randoms are running. I'm sure people will start dodging and/or harassing in chat with things like "Jigsaw -- no thanks."
---
I think the game is actually the smallest map.
---
How?
---
Iirc they were made to look like a survivor but because survivors have cosmetics and stand out it didnt work out like that.
---
You keep telling yourself that while you murder fun.
---
My cousins autistic and he's heaps more intelligent than you or these devs m8
---
Pika my hole XD
---
Nintendo is a Japanese company, you should expect anime stuff honestly.
---
What‚Äôs your Etsy
---
When you deliberately have your low rank friend be the one to set up the match to guarantee a low rank killer, it's done with ill intent.
---
Absolute banging show. I spent so much money (probably like ¬£10) on chocolate cigarettes and the little packs to open up the talismans when I was a kid. I want to binge watch this and Samurai Jack now where I can watch it uninterrupted - thanks MUM - in order. 
---
That's true. I'm also actually happy it gets to more consoles.
---
Won't be buying it though since I'd need to start over.
---
Devour hope?
---
you wiggled off? Basement was right behind her lol. 
---
Noed is definitely stronger but yeah this is true
---
*giggles in doctor*
---
I had a pallet down there and the other entrance way to the basement had one too 
---
That would make bloodwarden ridiculously strong on its own. The good thing about bloodwarden is that it isn't that strong, so doesn't see regular use. If it did, survivors would begin to expect it and either leave before someone got hooked, giving up on the save, or all run out of the exit gates before the hook, losing a lot of bloodwarden's benefit.
---
It's pretty much a tie between doc and legion, but play doc...
---
(fuck legion lmao)
---
Man, L√©ry's it's jump town, litteraly full of windows
---
If you think about the killers have no chance against Mario, he saved the princess over the past 30 years and saving the world in some cases. He would just need to jump on the killer 3 times and they're dead lmao.
---
Delete this
---
Don't do the math. Never do the math. It's a path of expectations, and expectations can lead to disappointment. 
---
If you wanna be anal about semantics, thanatophobia is the fear of *death*, not *just the process of dying*. So I'm pretty sure that seeing a friend alive in one moment and dead in the next should fall under its scope, and thus trigger the perk.
---
Hey at least with cross play que times won't take forever. Cross play should happen but in the options there's a check box to play against other switch players is automatically on so Noobs will play with noobs still, and others who don't care about being against pro killers/survivors just want faster que times will check the box off.
---
Isn't dedicated servers coming though? It's probably the best chance to get cross play while they're at it. And it's true getting licensing could be a thing, but even if they get only steam that's good enough honestly, there's allot of players on Steam fo help with Que times and I imagine Valve has no objections since they're very flexible.
---
Freddy and Nurse could actually be pretty broken. If Nurse could see auras that is :3
---
no you can't. but if you have a pc why would you want to play it in a switch??
---
Their cosmetics numbnuts
---
Because im lazy and want to keep on tilting myself in my bed. Until i can cry myself to sleep.
---
THATS NOT OK, YOU ARE THE HOST OF THE GAME! IF YOU LEAVE BECAUSE YOU ARE 'BORED', IT JUST LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE RAGE QUITTING, SO YEAH, PPL WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU. 
---
FUCK VALENTINES DAY. I JUST WANT TO SIT AT HOME AND MURDER PEOPLE IN THE DARK.
---
So true üòÖ
---
Not trying to show off just trying to let y'all know when it could possibly drop.....
---
Yes it was. But still, it' s large sum of money. Not that easy to pay off.
---
Was using unrelenting to help with chases
---
Noed can simply be avoided, by just cleansing five totems and ds isn't as bad either. Survs can only use it once per match. Just hit them down again and there's no trouble. And if it's so unacceptable to you just juggle them to the hook. I find this technique unnecessary and noobish but if you really can't deal with d strike in any other way just respond to it in toxic manner.
---
You disgust me.
---
Wow, looks really good! Love it! :D 
---
BECAUSE FUCK YOU, SURVIVORS GET ENOUGH LOVE!
---
It's your own comment. You did try
---
RANK RESETS AND I SEE SURVIVORS ACTING LIKE TOTAL FUCKBOYS!
---
I KNOW I AIN‚ÄôT THE ONLY ONE WHO‚ÄôS SICK OF TOXIC PLAYERS, SO HERE‚ÄôS MY ADVICE: [BE TOXIC RIGHT BACK!](/intensifies)
---
TELL ME YOUR KILLER AND I‚ÄôLL TELL YOU WHAT TO USE THAT‚ÄôLL GUARANTEE YOU FUN, BOTH AS YOU PLAY, AND IN THE POST-CHAT AS SURVIVORS REEEE AND CHIMP OUT AT YOU. IT FEELS SO SATISFYING TO WATCH THEM CRY!
---
:C
---
Yeah.
---
Have you actually played on PS4? Because it doesn‚Äôt seem like you have. Frame rate is abysmal, to the point where killer is unplayable sometimes. survivors just vanish with no indication of direction. There are often input delays that only happen with this game for me. 
---
If this game can‚Äôt run well on base ps4, there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôll run well on switch.

Hag is pretty good righr now
---
As much as I'd love to play this game on switch, it's very likely it's gonna have a lot of problems. So I'll have no choice really but to pass. And besides, that trailer was the worst trailer I've ever seen, like come on. The graphics look so shitty and there were a total of like 11 frames
---
Money.
---
Gotta wait until Fall unfortunately
---
No, just Hope
---
So you're saying seeing two people on a gen is stronger than insta-downing them at endgame?
---
No it has to be a grudge score event
---
The framerate was the first thing I noticed on the trailer.  I was hoping it was just early build blues, but if they can't even keep a consistant framerate on other consoles then it's gonna be a hard pass from me.
---
So can ds
---
I feel like I‚Äôll probably get it. I‚Äôll still mainly play on PS4, but I got the game way back when it was a PS Plus free game, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd be buying it again if I got it for Switch.
---
Ace! 
---
there's a semi-unique  but still dbd rip-off for mobile called Identity V
---
Hello Caiden
---
Hopefully
---
I‚Äôve had 3 or 4 crashes since Legion and none in the 2 years before that.
---
THE TREES IN MYER'S HANDDON ARE STILL SNATCHING MY TEAMMATES!!! I LOST 2 PEOPLE IN ONE MATCH TO TREES!!!!
---
Now imagine the killer playing through Wifi in his bathroom.
---
I love my switch, but it's not the type of place that's good for DbD.
---
I started watching Game of Thrones and when Ygritte (Rose Leslie) came onto the scene, all I could see was Meg.
---
Ace just wants head
---
Love your style. I would love to see my favorite character Nea!
---
Chuck Norris as Bill Overbeck
---
It does not
---
It‚Äôs really easy to lose people in frenzy in lery‚Äôs 
---
You are an enemy of the people
---
Do you play solo or SWF? The rare times I torture myself with a solo game I get a match quick but if I'm playing with friends I have to wait ages 
---
Okay? He managed to guess the switch port right before it was announced
---
I follow this sub religiously but I had no idea either lol 
---
BICTH hag is the best killer to walk the entity"s realm
---
Work together, but apart.
---
I was about to say: "You do realize that another team will be working on switch"   
---
But then I realized that same team could be added to fix bugs, and now I feel stupid
---
Betris tattle loyare
---
A bit late but it does use the chase music
---
still not as good as those three
---
if the killer finds it first and just stays right on the hatch then its his fault honestly I seen so many killers do that
---
Then you dropped it too early. You always get the points for dropping a pallet on the killer wheter the killer gets stunned or not.
---
People might‚Äôve complained if they did another.
---
I'm still processing the fact that DBD is coming to the Switch.
---
I mean, that‚Äôs kinda what he does already, ya know? Laughing and kinda coughing at the same time. 
---
Yea it can, just don't down the survivors, duh. 
---
That's the whole point. It's meant to be a disadvantage to allow the survivors chance to break line of sight and escape.
---
Pallet looping would be so much worse if survivors never have a chance to hide in a chase because the killers can always hear them.
---
Oh, damn, my mistake 
---
When I play as survivor, I never see survivor salt, but since I started playing Killer, I see it a lot.
---
I played a match where I literally didn't kill anybody on hook until I'd hooked EVERYBODY twice, and I still got called a tunneler.
---
Both perks are crutch in concept alone, reward you for playing bad. They're stupid and both need to go. 
---
I feel bad for all these downvotes, but your tought process doesn't take situational variables into account
---
Ya but this time its cuz he ate a fart. &gt;[the killers will know pain]&lt;
---
1.- I didn't say I liked having two ghosts
---
2.- I didn't say you can't have it, I said it woukd be disappointing for me
---
Xbox one x: 15-28fps
---
Switch: 1,5-3fps
---
But they're objective was the same
---
Oh stop, nothing about this post screams sarcasm. I understand that it is sarcastic but didn't seem that way originally
---
Ya but this time it's cuz he ate a fart. **the killers will know pain**
---
Im not farming either, but I meant maxing Chase, Hook and maybe Deviousness, to get at least 1 pip.
---
Also, Yes a Survivor can be Carried by his team, which the Killer cant 
---
Maybe go and play Civ 5
---
Just don't DC lol LegionHead.
---
Cute &lt;3
---
How does it not scream sarcasm? Freddy is the worst killer in the game. Of course calling him overpowered is being sarcastic
---
Only that noed is counterable and ds isn't (dribbling excluded)
---
That would be amazing. I feel like camping would become a more viable strategy with seven potential rescuers milling around.
---
That's because it's not true. 
---
There's one specific line that sets the trap off if the survivor runs/crawls past it (either way). If the killer carries them past it, they can escape, but ironically if they try to go back inside, they die.
---
I don't think the killer can drop you directly on it.
---
But against good players DS is another 30 second chase at least which makes a big difference to a game. NOED can't simply be avoided if the killer is good because generators need to be done quickly.
---
^^
---
And the same goes for noed. Avoid noed at what cost. Spending a shit ton of time on totems or just get out before getting hit. What is your point
---
Good man.
---
How is nurse not s she also gets harder with addons 
---
He's licenced though...
---
If you understood totem placement it's really not that difficult. If your team is well coordinated you won't spend a lot of time and usually you find them by accident.
---
I wouldn't be so sure about that considering Freddy's still a licensed character while Legion isn't. Sure, Freddy's been around for long now, just saying that the unnecessary extra steps they'd have to do in order to adjust Freddy, ain't needed for Legion.
---
Yeah but they could always use that other team to help with fixing bugs
---
I get an unresponsive game maybe once a week. But before I upgraded it was twice a day at least
---
Woke
---
I tried staying in a legion game last night. The three minutes were fine then the legion was like let's make it a 40 minute long match. 
---
One of the survivors left and the three of us played *21 mend*, it wasn't even like  we're gen locked because I managed to repair the final gen but for heaven's sake.
---
 I hope I don't see another legion for a week.

---
If you understood juggling it's really not that hard to deal with
---
They are actually remaking Deathgarden into something more interesting. Take a look over at /r/Deathgarden.
---
I'm more worried about the fact thag most switch players play the system undocked or at least not hardwired with the ethernet adapter. I'm imagining a ton of lag and disconnects. 
---
And people called me an idiot for saying they only care about money.
---
Is it just me or is this trippy (mobile)
---
They could change no ed, honestly. No exposed status, but increase movement speed.
---
Juggling only works if the person is downed close to a hook and slugging meh, sure is sort of a counter but a bad one if 4ppl use ds.
---
Gen repair l, hatch escape boom. Guessing your entire team died in the basement and you profited and their stupidity lol
---
But kinda suspect for swf 
---
OwO daddy Michael
---
Mad Grit - Once per trial, when you get hooked, instead, break the hook and STUN the killer 2/3/4 seconds. For the remainder of the trial, you gain the BROKEN status.
---
Iron Maiden - When entering a locker, the killer is given a loud noise indicator to your position if they are 20/28/36 meters away, but their aura is revealed to you as long as you remain inside.
---
Discordance - When you first working on a generator, a random other generator on the map explodes as if a survivor working on it had just missed a skillcheck. This effect has a cooldown of 60/50/40 seconds
---
Breakdown - When a survivor rescues another from a hook at least 32 meters away from you, the unhooked survivor gains the BROKEN status for 40/50/60 seconds
---
Aftercare - When a survivor rescues another from a hook, the rescuer's aura is revealed to you for 6/8/10 seconds
---
Distortion - When a survivor is hooked, 1/2/3 phantom survivors are placed on random other hooks throughout the map. These survivors appear identical to the hooked survivor, but dissipate when another survivor gets within 8 meters of them, or when the hooked survivor is rescued or sacrificed.
---
Maybe they'll get help from Panic button? One can only hope
---
Nah it's good how it is. Oof is over used
---
But not from a movie... Otherwise who plays him?
---
Why Feng? It should be Nea.
---
0/10 Dwight ain't in a locker (jk it looks super nice)

Fam u rite

amazing work!

What‚Äôs with the down votes? I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs being facetious.

With info that's already known.
---
First time my memes get linked, I'm about to cry...
---
Credit to my best friend who I didn't know had reddit account so /u/meowmixbar 
---
He looks depressed
---
Pretty sure the Devs haven't said anything like that but thank fuck we didn't get a disguise killer.
---
That ain‚Äôt a rank 20 if they have LF
---
Love when a trap goes off on the side of the pallet the survivor is on and they jump over to me.
---
Damn it must be hard to satisfy your pessimistic ass. If it were only dissapointment and incompetence the game wouldn't be around for almost 3 years. 
---
I mean what other head lol? 
---
So level 1 and 2 noed before they *buffed* it?
---
So this is the optimization pass. They passed the terrible engine on over to the Switch. 
---
Console optimization is never coming. Never. *sigh*
---
Did you do the tutorial?? 
---
literally the scariest thing i‚Äôve ever seen
---
I mean this game was not made with this scope in mind, they didn't expect it to sell as much as it sold in even the first week. It's still shitty they didn't get their act together sooner but you can't blame them for having a poor code base for the small game this was intended to be.
---
Oh lord
---
he do :( he got genrushed
---
Don‚Äôt see anything wrong that. Survivors have premonition, spine chill, and alert. 
---
I see David, I upvote.
---
It is fair. I did not say it was balanced, but it is fair. 
---
GUYS MY FRIEND KILLED THEMSELVES AND THIS POST MENTIONS THE TERM 'KILL YOURSELF' THEREFORE I HAVE TO LINK THE TWO AND TELL EVERYONE SO THEY CAN GIVE ME SYMPATHY!!!! 
---
Ok, I laughed really hard when I first heard the news, but nothing beats my reaction to the announcement video. Before I got a new computer, I would play the game at 30 FPS on an ASUS notebook laptop, I had to go into the files and severely downgrade the graphics for it to work. Looking at the switch version was like watching myself play on that same notenook laptop again, except I noticed the bad framerate. I'm interested to see if BHVR will put out an optimized port or not, either way I'm waiting for dedicated servers to come this summer.
---
No sweaty literally all I said was keep your shit to yourself and don't bring down the humour of the post. Ez. Also I never even said the words 'shut up' so you're not very smart lmao. 
---
 If you escape her grasp or are dropped off after the two pillars in the gates,  it won't trigger.  It's to prevent the killer from just carrying you to your death.  So yeah,  you're right. 
---
Heres a cool internet pro tip, if you hover over a link embedded in an image or text, you will see in the bottom left corner of the screen the url the link will take you to. Doing it on this you will see that it is a youtube link, and probably harmless.
---
So rank does matter
---
That‚Äôs why so many people DC against Legion. Takes no skill or thought and it isn‚Äôt fun for you or the survivor.
---
Yea i know that's harshly worded, but think about this, even if thanatophobia was at full power the whole game, it would buy you roughly 6seconds/gen. A single ruin skill check is enough to do the same, and sloppy butcher or mangled add-ons give you the same 6secs/heal. Thanatophobia is just bad, unless the survivors start panicking over having to heal, which they have 0 reason to
---
You can still get the stun, he runs fast but for a short time then he's stunned. You can loop him. Why bother with noobs like you
---
im going to have nightmares because of this.
---
The fact I would have to pay for the dlc again and regrind all the perks is a no go. They need to let me link accounts if they want my business on switch. 
---
Most killers ability help them counter looping. You still loop them, if you aren't looping you deserve to lose.
---
How
---
Amy=Pig
---
They aren't getting any less true though.
---
It's touch and go for me. Sometimes it plays smooth, with the occasional hiccup, but some maps *coughcorncough* I literally can't see whats happening, even when I'm not in the corn.
---
I'll take "things that many other Killers can do better" for 1000.

What I don‚Äôt work for BHVR? I wish I worked for any gaming company but I‚Äôm just a cook in a nursing home lol. Check my history there‚Äôs nothing that would suggest I even have any technical knowledge, and I‚Äôm a bit ashamed to say it but all I play is killer so I don‚Äôt know what you mean. Like I said I‚Äôve never played on PC so I have nothing to compare it with in my experience but I‚Äôve had a lot of fun with this game, no issues, and I‚Äôm excited to see it on Switch. This is what I mean about this sub being super pessimistic.
---
Not a couple would have expected to see, but as my 2 killer mains I be happy
---
Even if there will be a PS5 version, why do you think it will mean a death of DbD on PS4?
---
they said they were thinking about adding something to endgame on one of their streams. other than that, no idea
---
I main Freddy and Spirit. and used right, Legion much stronger than these two
---
Thank you! That‚Äôs what I mean there‚Äôs obviously a thriving community around this game, unlike F13, so can we all agree it can‚Äôt be total shit? 
---
thats a desync bug.
---
I didn't mean that, I was just thinking when the time comes I don't want to have to play both consoles with the PS4 only being used for DbD
---
Good ol' Mert.
---
B-b-but they're being forced to buy all this extra frivolous shit, you see.
---
Oh yeah, so glad he turned out the way he did, right? 
---
Honestly, it is my biggest grip when people say DS should be removed but Noed is totally fine because you can remove it. Problem is, if you are playing solo, you don't know how many totems are left on the map. Swf can easily count together how many they did break, solo does not have that. A bit of a rant, but I feel like a totem counter would be such a fair improvement
---
If I can‚Äôt bring my levels/perks/bloodweb stuff from pc to switch I‚Äôm not even gonna bother
---
Shit takes forever to grind for, why would I wanna start over???
---
chances are you will not lose anything since the cloud ID is linked by account not system so if it is indeed pretty much the same game it would in theory keep the progress unless you go from one console to another 
---
Wraith: You got confusing (Beast-Soot and Bone Clapper). stealth (Ghost-Soot and Coxcomb Clapper), speedy (Windstorm- Blood and White), debuff (Blind Warrior- Mud and White), info dump (All Seeing- Blood and Spirit), destroyer/vault god (Shadow Dance- Blood and White), and quick transition (Swift Hunt- Blood and Blind- White)
---
a dev has said that the ptb will come 2 weeks before chapter 11.
---
‚ÄúCosmetics shouldn‚Äôt be in the game‚Äù ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt buy them‚Äù ‚ÄúW-what? H-how else am I meant to show off to my friends?‚Äù
---
 legion plus nurse would be crucial. 
---
Nah, just gotta teabag all around the mori to give my friend a special send off, then book it just before it ends so I don't get mori'd next.
---
SANS TRAPPER (SANS TRAPPER)
---
I think at this moment no one can give you an answer. I'd say, not even devs.
---
THIS. is the change legion needed.
---
Sweet, do you think it will come to next consoles? 
---
join my official legion = dc steam group
---
My favorite game ever was against a constant T posing trapper. Seeing him chase me around a corner with his arms straight out is hilarious. 
---
aDUUUUUUUD
---
Dont ever fix this bug!
---
its random. after unlocking ace‚Äôs teachables, i leveled up quentin, within first 10 levels i got one of ace‚Äôs perks.
---
Man... I was rank 1 along with 2 of my friends. Not too long ago a perk-less, addon-less Nurse wiped the floor with us. It was pretty embarrassing. 
---
I was your 2k upvote, like me
---
My Etsy link is in my [profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/HappyBeeps/). Or, if you search up "Dead by Daylight" on etsy, my keychains are on the first few listings. :D
---
Oh god, it'd be shortened to KWF and there'd be debates over whether it was cheating or not and if it was intentional to allow them to speak to one another and it'd be the hot topic of the forum for forever lol
---
yeah lemme play against switch killers as a pc survivor, sounds fair lmao. people already have enough trouble countering 360s on xbox/ps
---
I'm glad you like it! If you have any ideas of something you would like to see, either as the keychain or necklace, let me know. 
---
My Etsy link is in my [profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/HappyBeeps/), or shoot me a message.
---
whispers can be pretty insane if you know how to use it. ohtofu made a great guide with it, you should check it out.
---
spies from the shadows is also a good perk now since the crows alert you 100% of the time. unrelenting is unnecessary because you can just not miss :D
---
I know right 
---
we need less *clothes* for myers 
---
Dwight, of course
---
Those all seem like good killers to get into with the versatility they all bring..thanks guys
---
That is definitely the first Nurse weapon I've even considered buying. It echoes the Crotus Prenn hooks wonderfully.
---
Sounds almost as hilarious as the time a T-posing Trapper was permanently stuck with a phantom T-posing Feng for the remainder of the game.
---
then they‚Äôll rank up quickly with all their stuff because they get easy 4k‚Äôs leaving the lower ranks to be on their own with others who have as little as they do
---
It‚Äôs the same issue we have with our current system when ranks reset though. Just cause there isn‚Äôt a good solution/problem doesn‚Äôt mean they should reduce the available player base 
---
I'm just imagining your flair going "aDUUUUUU^U^U^U^U^D"
---
There's so many questions left unanswered though. Who made this coin? Did OP make it just for the purpose of throwing it to the garbage bin? Did he make it earlier and change his mind about the perks and find them trash now? Was it a gift from someone he threw out?
---
This is almost as bad as this one clip I saw of the wraith. Someone DC'd on their shoulder so it looked like they were flexing as they chased the survivor. 
---
every morning he does and licks my hair
---
Off the top of my head, remember being promised a way for killers to close the hatch? A Freddy rework? The list goes on and on. Even if these things are actually being worked on it's taken so long I don't even care anymore.
---
I've seen times that streamers have been so pissed at a survivor that they decided they would let everyone else go just so that the toxic survivor would have to watch everyone else escape.
---
Disappointment leads to fear, fear leads to anger, anger leads to dank memes. 
---
Haddonfield! As a survivor ofcourse haha
---
build a pc ez 
---
I dont know about your experience, but I encounter the green noed way more often than both of the purple noeds. And I wouldnt assume people thought it only gave movement speed, since noed is and always was a pretty popular perk in the community, simmilar to ruin or bbq and chillie
---
Yeah, so then the Entity will just take him and suddenly he's the next Killer
---
lmao - idk if I'm there yet; but I'm close.  
---
They've got plenty of time to port the game to switch and fix the current issues. Now the new issues that will pop up because of them trying to fix the current ones? That's what I'm waiting for. 
---
you took the time to figure out he wrote it but you couldn't be fucked to read the title :thinking:
---
The style is obviously very Anime-inspired but for some reason it reminds me of one particular anime whose name eludes me atm. 
---
It seems like you were a little too sensitive here dude. He wasn't hostile or anything. I'm not a native speaker, but I too perceived your title as kinda weird, considering it is your own comment. 
---
We already have Freddy as a sexual predator, we don‚Äôt need two
---
I mean, I said myself I don't actually have a problem with Legion. Just a meme
---
There are many ways to counter d strike, like juggeling or just eating it with enduring. The same goes for noed. Just break all the totems. You can even use perks like detectives hunch or (I forgot its name because its so shit, but it lets you know when you encounter a totem/trap)
---
DAMN IT I WANTED TO MAKE THIS JOKE, YOU FRICKING LEGION
---
A parody referencing a parody? 
---
When that means more Crab Rave, i am in ! 
---
What does Quebec has to do with it?
---
EVERYONE IS TOXIC, IT SHOWS MORE ON SRVIVORS CAUSE THERE ARE FOUR OF THEM A GAME. WERE ALL GUILTY OF IT SO NO YOU ARENT THE BADDY ITS NORMAL. JUST DONT DO IT EVERY GAME C: I DO IT TIME TO TIME - I DONT MIND SHOW BOATING WITH A TEABAG OR TWERK ... BUT IF YOU DO IT ON EVERY PALLET AND WINDOW OR JUKE IMMA TAKE IT AS DISRESPECT AND SLIG CAMP YOU 
---
so this is the legion buff that came out latest patch huh? 
---
if u want a brown addon And ur starting out with Spirit I'd recommend Brown addon Comb and Yellow addon Ribbon.
---
Guess he‚Äôs not competitive
---
I mean its still a good comment, even tho is smells like narcissistic ego! 
---
Yea I know I was trying to see if anyone else thought they looked the same
---
I, some rando on the internet, approve this ship.
---
You kind of undermine yourself referring to a big optimization patch lol
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be mad with this at all 
---
Oh ok yeah I've always thought it looked like that
---
I had this happen with Freddy.  We could not struggle while being carried and so my decisive was useless üòî
---
No, legion forces gen rush.
---
Fair fair. I was really playing around with friends and being silly. Still I cant believe he didnt see me üòÇüòÇ
---
Plz fix this bug, you cant struggle while being carried by them.
---
You‚Äôd be surprised to see what people upvote when you browse by ‚Äúnew‚Äù, a reddit comment isn‚Äôt the weirdest thing you‚Äôll see
---
I‚Äôm just defending my experience with the game on PS4. As far as things promised by the developers I haven‚Äôt the slightest, all I know is that I can look forward to finally having it on my Switch.
---
+ Mint rag
---
Because nobody likes the riddler irl
---
There's a lot of speculation that the PS5 will be backwards compatible since it's expected the next console generation will use the same basic architecture, just with more power. If that's the case there probably won't be any need to port and the PS4 version will just work in the PS5.
---
I‚Äôll change it to that then, wasn‚Äôt trying to sound like a dick btw 
---
Facts. This one in particular though feels like they get off on being negative. But as I‚Äôve said I‚Äôm not a pc gamer and just play on PS4 to have fun so I‚Äôm not very knowledgeable about all the meta to why it‚Äôs like this. I guess they promise things a lot and don‚Äôt deliver is what I can gather so far.
---
Can we get f‚Äôs in the chat 
---
If he had access to dead hard wouldn't that imply that he's already injured? 
---
yeah, i played on my console when i needed to replace a part on my pc and it wasn‚Äôt nearly as fun. as much as a pain i can see restarting would be, i have to admit that it is a far more enjoyable experience on pc. it may be due to my inability to use a controller anymore though lol 
---
As a survivor you can lagswitch to prevent getting hooked.
---
I've had it happen to me while I was playing killer.
---
Not very fun.
---
The game may be 3 years old but it's a game with active development still, and got an engine update in one of the latest patches. The game is just poorly coded / optimised. It works, but not as it should.
---
Also RE6 is from 2012, that's 6 years old. If what the other guy said is true, a 6 year old game that is no longer being updated runs better than a 3 year old game that is still actively being developped. There's no excuses or "buts" about this, DbD is poorly optimised and definitely needs work in that regard.
---
(And no, older games pushing modern GPUs to max usage isn't normal unless the game is poorly optimised..)
---
I was a big Pubg fan on pc and it's subreddit was worse by several waves of magnitude
---
WHEN ISNT IT JFC
---
Well I must‚Äôve read it wrong however the list makes completely no sense if that‚Äôs the case as Michael is a pretty easy killer to understand and play but he shouldn‚Äôt be so high is we are talking about the difficulty vs how good they are as a killer. The nurse should be a bit higher than she is because she‚Äôs a harder killer to learn and play properly. Freddy should be lower because his ability is pretty easy to understand. Sport should be higher because she is a hard character to learn and can end up mind gaming herself at times. You‚Äôre list is off in many ways even if it‚Äôs just based on the difficulty of the killer and not actually how viable they‚Äôre.
---
NOED I would say is more crutch.
---
I know most people don‚Äôt fail the DS but if someone was playing bad they would most likely miss it, just killer mains never know when we miss it or not so they think everyone is hitting those tiny skill checks everytime. 
---
I thought Feng missed her DS and jumped down the ledge, and then...
---
Also, denied DS = DC
---
I can get in between.
---
That was my idea as well. Some people think it's great, others think it's not a great idea  - but honestly, I'd run it all the time if it counted those in death.
---
TWO WEEKS IN A ROW NOW THE SHRINE HAS HAD PERKS THAT I JUST FINISHED LEVELING KILLERS TO GET. FIRST RUIN AND NOW M&amp;A. SO HELP ME GOD IF ENDURING SHOWS UP NEXT WEEK I AM JUST GONNA SNAP. 
---
They've claimed rework for a while now but I still 4k in decent ranks with him. Dont know why people say hes so bad. He doesn't have as good of a chase as some killers but hes still fun.
---
Nnnice. 
---
Mid March.
---
I love this too much
---
Those survivor perks are SO good! We need those 
---
Judging by the fact that you went out of your way to add them and call them cancer (which is extremely stupid to use that as an offense), I bet offending people in post-game chat is something common for you. You probably got banned for other people reporting you and coincidentally happened to have the same date as your report for holding the game hostage. 
---
Or the fact that the direction everyone is moving, the survivor is already clearly injured if he is using dead hard, and using it to move passed a killer blocking the way to the exit.
---
I only asked because I had a streamer do the same to me.  Stayed in the basement changing lockers after I killed their entire team and pretty much said the same stuff they said to you.  Funny thing, is in the next match, i got the same group and mori'd up....and the jerk hid in the basement again!  After that, they clearly had MLG up and dodged me for the rest of the day
---
At very least I'd like the pig to function like the legion where you can choose between different male/female cosmetics (Mark and Amanda) 
---
Wedding dress is still the best Nurse cosmetic 
---
Double the women. Twice the fun.
---
Survivalist is op but iron will icon meh. But still pretty good perk 
---
I'm the same, I play on PS4,have fun with it and I'm happy that later I can get to play it on the go. Is it perfect? No is not, and is never gonna be. Cause all game have issues. They will never satisfied all the players, that's an impossible and absurb expectation. I have worked in the (serious) gaming industry, not at this level but hell sometimes stuff messes up your timeframes and deadline delivery. This guys put their soul into the game and people treat them like shit. If anything, I know the people in this industry mainly the designers and devs work their asses off, long days and small pay and still they give their all for the game. To say that they lie and they don't have their priorities straight really pisses me off. 
---
 Sorry for the rant and the broken English
---
I don‚Äôt know if this is a dirty joke. But if you‚Äôre curious yes her mouth does move to the screeches she makes. 
---
While it was mostly out of anger at their refusal to comply/actually learning their intentions, that‚Äôs a fair assessment. I have been trying to tone it down as of late but it is entirely possible I just got reported by someone else. Though to be fair, on my grind to rank 1 I have been playing kind of dirty and only going for pips/playing kind of campy so it could have also just been salt adding up from that 
---
Other than money issues and the different consoles needing to agree to cross play, the performance on consoles compared to PC makes it unfair for players across consoles to be able to play with each other. PS4/Xbox compatibility would be fine but PC would have too much advantage.
---
yeah admittedly i'm on a slim as well but I have friends on standard ps4 with the same issues. I got the game when it was free back in august and it was honestly fine then. But I think the Patch before Darkness Among us, something broke, and I started losing games left and right not because I was playing poorly but survivors would literally vanish in two frames. Then the engine update flat out broke the game. I think the most recent patches have cleared things up a bit though. Here's my problem though: If I can run a game like Monster Hunter (also online with a much more intense graphics load) or Overwatch (almost three times the players per match) on a Slim with only the occasional framerate drop, DBD has no excuse. I'm not even huge on graphics and FR. I'm happy with a flat 30. But when it's actually hampering my ability to play the game, it makes me not want to play the game. 
---
Killer main here. I don't have any problem with DS. Can be missed and even when it hits it does not guarantee escape from killer. Urban evasion is way more annoying.
---
I heard that the chapter will be revealed in 2 weeks (on Tuesday I guess? Pretty sure that‚Äôs the days it‚Äôs revealed) then a few weeks after that the release. So early/mid March 
---
loltyler1.com DISCOUNT CODE:ALPHA
---
If u know u know 
---
Well giving rank 20's all their perks etc from PC isn't exactly a good idea either.  No matter what they are going to complain, either they get games and have to start over or they get less games and keep their stuff.  Would honestly be an option they'd have to choose so if they complained then it would fall on deaf ears since it would've been their choice. 
---
Tanks are notoriously good at tennis. Very nimble.
---
OK, wtf did I just watched? xD
---
"Not The Chris Hansen type, the xenomorph hunting ones xD"
---
Feel good about yourself? Thought nobody would notice? Very cool dead meat quote. Very creative. 
---
¬øLegion punishes teamwork though? 
---
Legion suffers when survivors are working on separate generators, plus makes healing each other pointless and dangerous. When you play against legion you try to stay away from other survivors. That's not teamwork.
---
If I have an unused coin, would they be gone after next week?  I kind of hope not so I can just have it as a keepsake.
---
i love this community sighs
---
Interesting.... this is uncannily similar.... was the survivor in question rank 1 while their swf was closer to green and purple ranks? I was a rank 5 killer around when this incident happened to me
---
Five gens on the game with Ruin still up. Looks like they were just looking to end it or see if you wanted to farm.
---
This was not even 3 minutes into the match
---
He used to play quite toxically, has hacked and makes a YT series called toxic series. He isn't toxic anymore, he hacked to try get his legacy back, a special skin, that was taken from loads of people including him for no reason and his toic series is more about the editing than him actually being toxic.   
---
A lot of people like him and Ochido who, I hope, are younger so when they play they wear the same skin and try to immitate the play being asshats in game which is why people said they are bad for the game. Noob just gets a bad rap now a lot of people think he is still toxic but haven't watched any of his content in ages to know he isn't like that now.   
---
Exactly and there was one already dead and two hooked in the basement. The game was over, Laurie was just going for the points.
---
Its honestly such a mess the whole situation in dbd regarding toxicity. Utter breeding ground for this type of shit.
---
amusing you left nothing out of your story its a good example why context matters, do Behavior really not expect people not to retaliate when faced with such bs.
---
Rin and the huntress should be ranked higher.
---
THANK you it means a lot honestly 
---
I think you deserve the ban for harassment and they deserve a ban for holding the game hostage and being generally unsportsmanlike (did you check if they also got banned?). I don't think you were entirely in the wrong though, if anyone deserves the ban more than the other (provided this story is 100% accurate) itd be them.
---
I believe so, dont really recall their ranks.  But the best piece of advise i can give is, dodge when you see T.TV enter your lobby.  9 out of 10 times they play like deuchebags to entertain their stream with their idiot SWF buddies
---
That's like, my wet dream as any killer.
---
All four juicy survivors strapped to the basement hooks at the same time. 
---
It was a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
I won't be buying this unless cross play gets planned.
---
+1 here. I‚Äôd love to pay BHVR for the convenience of playing DBD on my Switch, but I refuse to grind again. Sync my account so I can give you my money, BHVR.
---
Like I said make it a check box, you can still play vs other console players if you desire.
---
I can imagine your thoughts:
---
*"This is getting out of hand! Now there's four of them!!"*
---
Yeah, I gave them the benefit of the doubt, until now... They can't even fix consoles properly yet they still want to port it to Switch. Guess how it will go. 
---
No.
---
he a salty af anglo
---
Sorry about that üòÖ and thx! 
---
I don‚Äôt think that was the case, entirely. Like I said earlier, they were all running borrowed time
---
She had Iri heads and a mori so she really wanted to hit me with that
---
I would honestly take my ban a lot more happily if I knew they were getting the same treatment, however I did check their stream and it‚Äôs offline so I really can‚Äôt say if they got punished or not. 
---
I have so much learning to do killer wise lol 
---
Survivor main. Would not do half as well as I do if urban evasion didn't exist.
---
Well you were abusive so oh well. Them hiding is annoying but yeah no one is gonna be banned for hiding.
---
Honestly given how insanely angry you are over a video game it might be good for you to have a little break. Its a game dont lose ur mind over it
---
Hahahaha, exactly. Love the reference
---
Dm me and I will see what I can do! ^_^
---
I appreciate the input
---
I know you dont want to hear it my dude, but you were in the wrong here. I mean, so were they; but it was you who took the initiative to message them out of game and call them names which is against their rules. 
---
Damn, that's neat. (And no that wasn't a dirty joke lol.)
---
This shitpost is perfect 
---
They are still plastic figures regardless of quality.
---
well then next time you are on a computer you will know what to do.
---
Michael Myers as Michael Myers.
---
It started out as a plea to stop taking the game hostage, it only devolved into name calling when I saw they had 0 intention of stopping, if that helps with clarity at all 
---
MANDATORY: Iron Will &amp; Borrowed Time
---
SWAP IN &amp; OUT: Prove Thyself, Resilience, Adrenaline, Bond, Balanced Landing
---
His trailer looks like the idea was to get close to a survivor by being a survivor, then if you successfully fool them you may have gotten an instadown (though that couldve been for cinematic purposes). I think the reason it didn't come out that way is because the legion isnt very super natural, thus making no way to actually make a disguise ability make sense because they don't look like Dwight, meg, etc
---
*laughs in backwater swamp*
---
Is that legal?
---
It‚Äôs for sure a high quality skin. And the wraith has fucking shoes now.
---
Oh no
---
First four notes of Megalovania intenstifies.
---
I love getting into a match with a really good Dwight. It‚Äôs like a someone with no legs winning a marathon. They earned that shit apparently 
---
You're not wrong
---
Lol the quote "fuck you". So inspirational.
---
To fully explain the power, not to fully understand the power. This is much less the skill floors of each killer's power but more about how much time it would take to explain to a survivor what each killer's power does.
---
She‚Äôs doing so much wrong. This is what happens when you think ultra rare add ons and a mori will just carry you if you‚Äôre trash. 
---
The Trap Lord is unamused.
---
Trapper for smash confirmed?
---
Who needs a ship, When you can have a boat
---
101 now
---
Iirc it is considered a worse offense to "harass" people on multiple platforms.  You, by your own admission, said something you "shouldn't have", after which you went into their stream and talked to them some more instead of just simply reporting them.
---
They may or may not deserve a ban, but you probably deserve yours based on your own typing.
---
It's probably being developed by another studio though, but I'm not sure
---
I dont doubt you, but the bottom line is still that you made contact first and at some point were verbally harassing them.
---
Mint Rag and Rusty Shackles, with Devour, Ruin, Lullaby, and TotH is quite possibly the most OP build in the game. 
---
It's lovely.
---
I have had this happen a lot actually xD 
---
The huntress was flexing on me last night 
---
Dear Rank-Reset Legion,
---
I hate you. I hate you so much. God, do I hate you, you tunneling, camping, Frank's Mixtape piece of anti-fun garbage. It's not enough that you have to play Legion, but you also have to double-hit with Frank's Mixtape and tunnel, using chase exploits until you 4k our PUG 3-David fun squad. Ruin, Thanatophobia, BBQchilli, and Sloppy Butcher = screw you, you selfish, inconsiderate prick.  
---
P.S., Mr. Rage Dwight
---
I hate you too. I didn't ask you to show up that game, and I didn't ask you to show up in the next three games, and I sure as hell didn't ask you to DC AFTER YOU GOT DOWNED ONCE EVERY SINGLE TIME.
---
&gt; While it was mostly out of anger at their refusal to comply/actually learning their intentions, that‚Äôs a fair assessment. I have been trying to tone it down as of late but it is entirely possible I just got reported by someone else. Though to be fair, on my grind to rank 1 I have been playing kind of dirty and only going for pips/playing kind of campy so it could have also just been salt adding up from that
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Edit: also I really have no reason to lie here, I know you don‚Äôt ‚Äúknow me‚Äù or whatever but I truly have laid all my cards out on the table because I‚Äôm exhausted with players who keep getting away with shit like this. The kinds of things you can get away with in Dead By Daylight‚Äôs gameplay systems is UNPRECEDENTEDLY toxic dude
---
They don't get away with this, you just didn't report properly. 
---
Can't say people get away with stuff when you don't report. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Every time I reported players in DBD, they got banned. 
---
I also did not read such notes... explain?
---
I hardly think ‚ÄúI sent a ticket to behavior about you &lt;3‚Äù is worth considering harassment but sure, I‚Äôll keep in mind that messaging ppl on other platforms is unwise and bannable‚Äù in the future 
---
This is why they should actually be "ultra rare". These add-on's appear way too often and prop-up these bad players (killers and survivors)
---
Not even Meg and Nea smh
---
Well we wont have an opportunity to have a v.2 for saw killers tho. So atleast maybe we can hope for it. Besides chucky has a lot of chance to be included now since he has a movie coming.
---
Not today, old friend
---
These legion memes are getting kinda old tbh
---
Are you serious?? Rofl
---
I'll get behind Rin ( ¬∞ Õú ñ ¬∞)
---
underrated post
---
DS is easily countered. NOED is just super broken and way too OP. I can live with DS but NOED has to go ASAP. I‚Äôm a killer main btw.
---
That doesn‚Äôt make sense at all. If a survivor were to lagswitch while being carried nothing at all would happen in the killers end, it would play out as normal. 
---
I've been playing for quite awhile and the game has only been improving since they ditched there publisher. 
---
That‚Äôs honestly my mistake, sure, but why does behavior literally have a checkable category on the support ticket that asks whether or not I made an ingame report if that is meaningless? I feel like half of my frustration is the fact I had false hope for so long lolol 
---
Plus he doesn't lose a survivor when he drops a chase, so he can pick and choose his chases to get the fastest hits/downs and keep multiple survivors busy at the same time.
---
Thank you for your input
---
lmao true
---
So reporting the other way via raising a ticket isn't enough? Sounds like the OP went to a hell of a lot of trouble providing video evidence and screen shots clearly showing it happening in the game for them to weasel out on a technicality that the OP didn't report in game.  
---
Agreed! I think he has a fine and interesting mechanic. Just needs a little tuning, maybe a little faster to make up for having no chase mechanics.  I'd be happy with that.
---
r/unexpectedprequel ?
---
I hope that nintendo put them to actually work in fixing their mess
---
&gt;That‚Äôs honestly my mistake, sure, but why does behavior literally have a checkable category on the support ticket that asks whether or not I made an ingame report if that is meaningless? I feel like half of my frustration is the fact I had false hope for so long lolol
---
How did you have false hope when its specifically said in the rules that you **NEED** to report in game for things like holding the game hostage?
---
Videos and screenshots can be tampered with so it makes sense that they need to check the logs. 
---
Who knows. Unless it's gonna affect their income they don't seem to be too assed about doing things right for the gamers. 
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one whose getting four people into the basement lately (rank reset Jesus....)

The actual horror experience in the game. 
---
Big nope from me, but that‚Äôs purely cause I hate Hoffman. Dude annoyed me the entire time he was alive. 
---
&gt;So reporting the other way via raising a ticket isn't enough? Sounds like the OP went to a hell of a lot of trouble providing video evidence and screen shots clearly showing it happening in the game for them to weasel out on a technicality that the OP didn't report in game.
---
Without in-game report it isn't enough because devs can't check the  game logs and actually see the players that were in that match. 
---
Ahhh the satisfaction we will get when he gets banned on switch also. I can feel it
---
I sometimes play Freddy. And to be honest  i only tunnel people with stupid ass names and leave the other get out most of the time.
---
Im looking at u Swagchill420
---
Pretty sure she wouldn't be able to. Also I heard with the 2 killer glitch you can do in kyf, if freddy is one of the killers, the other killer can't hit sleeping survivors. Could just be an oversight because they didn't think of 2v8 though.
---
Why don't you give me a few scenarios where you think lack of skill causes me to die versus a Legion?

They have to be in a chase with you and vault the same window 3 times for it to temporarily blocked.  They can vault indefinitely if they weren't technically in a chase such as an invisible Wraith following them etc...and if you're getting looped that hard break the chase and pressure gens to find someone else.  Don't engage in long chases.

This is some SCP stuff

[GAME RULES AND REPORT SYSTEM](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system#latest)
---
I... actually do know Dead Meat. James A Janisse but I had no idea that was a quote from that o.0 jeez, I‚Äôve prolly seen that episode as well and subconsciously remembered him saying that. I genuinely swear I thought that was just a tiny anecdote my brain cooked up, I‚Äôm kinda weirded out now
---
To.
---
Explain.
---
Hag is arguably the 2nd best killer now.
---
But the same applies to the other 2 also.
---
Regardless, they're all high A tier and there's no way to truly judge which is the better killer. They're all amazing
---
Not to mention that windows have timer on them for how long they will be blocked for. This timer starts after the first vault but doesn‚Äôt block it until the third vault. That‚Äôs why on maps like haddonfield you can actually loop the big building infinitely. 
---
Because you pick your own battles when people are toxic in chat. There is a mute / block button. Also. Jumping over windows is part of the game, you know, to escape?  Don‚Äôt get mad at the player get mad at the game, but even then, ITS JUST A GAME why are you whining and letting toxic players get the best of you?
---
What do you mean by "abusing loops"?
---
So. syringe is basically a melee clown bottle...?
---
How long would it take for you to give a full rundown of all aspects of a killer's power to someone who has never played vs or as that killer.
---
This looks like a fucking scp
---
Incredible, well I guess I won‚Äôt make the same mistakes again in the event I‚Äôm ever faced with someone that toxic again. I appreciate all of your effort and input duder 
---
Yeah that Redditor above mentioned it too, saying it‚Äôs prolly from dead meat if you‚Äôve ever watched it (you should :D) I had no idea I was quoting that at all o.0
---
4head

OOOOH SHIT TRUE,been binge-watching him not long ago and I think that video is recent

I have to "use" the window too in order to block it?

Nope

[Me seeing Wraith skin.](https://youtu.be/xbtQS56HPXY)
---
No, they have to fault the window while in a current chase with you 3 times.  It has to be the same window too.  If they're mixing it up and looping you at an area with multiple windows it takes a while.
---
Here‚Äôs ten good reasons why they would decide to port their game rather than actually make it work:
---
1-  cash
---
2-  money
---
3-  dosh
---
4-  skrip
---
5-  scrilla
---
6-  coin
---
7-  quid
---
8-  bucks
---
9-  Benjamins
---
10-  Complete and total incompetence exacerbated by apathy brought on by a lack pf serious repercussions for their absurdly bad handling of this game and its community thus far.
---
Woah what the 
---
Legion is fine, they are good at shanking whick is ticklish. Which is what shanking is supposed to be ticklish not deadly. You can die from being chaimsawed but shanking, I dont think so.
---
The shape, huntress, wraith, and hillbilly. 
---
The nurse and legion I feel can be overpowered, spammy and not make the game enjoyable as it feels like you can kill easily as well as the one that looks like an alien, I don't recall her name at the moment.

"Lots of cosmetics to **earn.**" - DBD for Nintendo Switch trailer
---
~~Jokes aside I'm interested to see if Nintendo is going to let Behavior put microtransactions in a Switch game or if they're going to actually force them to make the Shard gain not trash. I assume that, at the very least the chapters will have to be bought.~~
---
I've actually made a post about this some time ago. My conclusion was: 1st place hag, 2nd place myers and will edit with 3rd place and link to post. Not everyone totaly agreed with my post, but overall it should be pretty accurate
---
I feel like a pretty fun one is Spirit. Her phase is pretty challenging to use offensively but when you can master it it's going to be your best tool against them. The whole idea of them not being able to see you while invisible is a massive mindgame
---
For what you want I would recommend the pi. She has great mind game potential and a bit of map pressure with the traps. Not too op but far from to weak
---
So when's the Dead by Daylight book coming out? Cause hopefully that'll be adapted into a movie.
---
he probably wondered why you were fucking running into the counter continuously lul
---
Billy or the pig definitely 
---
He did, I hear the "sound" and I saw the black spikes there... Yet he still was jumping around that window over and over. That's what surprised me, I thought he couldn't jump over 3 times, specially with those black things.
---
Happy cake day.
---
No one is questioning that its just the commercial was generalizing.

I'm surprised they didn't accuse you of camping.

#üëè **Chapter** üëè **Review** üëè
---
**Power** - Kinda just a really shitty Clown? Feel like the syringe needs to cause more than just a slow. Also faces all the issues that Clown has in terms of certain perks being insanely good. (Save the Best for Last)
---
(Going from left to right then top to bottom) **Killer perk 1** - Actually pretty awesome. Could've been an interesting way for them to take Surveillance. I don't know if it'll replace BBQ anytime soon (BP gainz 2gud) but for the likes of Hillbilly it would be a strong perk.
---
**Killer perk 2** - VERY interesting concept. Definetly very strong on certain Killers *cough Legion cough* and a good tracking tool otherwise. Insane combos with Distortion. Also needs a time limit on how long it takes for you to hit the two survivors.
---
**Killer perk 3** - Please stop adding mechanics that should be baseline as perks. ;-; On topic: this would be complete and utter fucking cancer with Remember Me. I think just being able to regress exit gates (as opposed to disable them) or possibly cause them to explode in a similar vein to Overcharge would be far more balanced.
---
**Survivor perk 1** - Very curious how this would interact with Deliverance. Other than that it's just a neat concept that I think a lot of Ace mains would really enjoy.
---
**Survivor perk 2** - Has its uses. Obligatory "cough Deliverance cough" mention.
---
**Survivor perk 3** - Kinda weak? You shouldn't really be healing in the Killer's TR anyways (Nurse's) and if you are you should know where the Killer is. Premonition and Spine Chill are better for detection during down time. Can be useful against stealth Killers but stealth Killers are rare and it's not worth using a perk slot for this when you could have Spine Chill or Prem.
---
I've heard about a bug floating around last week or so where survivors were able to revault blocked windows.  Sounds like it happened to your game.
---
I think they were just saying nice killer
---
That would explain that shit :/ thanks for the info
---
They already did that with the XB1, this is basically stepping back an entire generation hardware wise.
---
I am surprised too. But if you go barreling to the basement in full view of me, I‚Äôm not ignoring you
---
huntress/billy both addonless can be very rewarding to learn and fun to play against. huntresses with high ping can be frustrating to play against but that's not a consequence of the killer, but the platform/game. they're getting stale to play vs for the more hardcore players but that's also just going to happen eventually anyways
---
killers without an active m2 are rarely challenging to learn, but if you don't want to demolish all people consider playing any killer without addons higher than brown quality.
---
I thought this was a joke when I first heard it. I play on PS4 and loved reading the FAQ where it'll be "30 FPS" in both handheld and TV mode. Like, if I could get 30 FPS on PS4 I'd be content, but apparently that's so hard it's taken all this time and they've still not managed it. How the heck they gonna hit 30 on the switch!?

I personaly think Julie is hotter than Susie. Susie just has a better outfit.

---
I win this argument objectively
---
Here's my little conspiracy theory. I don't think anyone working at BHVR actually plays the game on a regular basis. The only way that all the issues with the game remain in it for as long as they did is if the people working on it don't care about it and don't play it. 
---
Thanks for proving my point. You're not a very good troll. Also it's kind of amazing that scum like you have the audacity to attempt to silence others over the internet for speaking about suicide. It's a heavy topic that no one wants to think about or talk about, but that's not how we combat depression. It's quite the opposite. 
---
So tell me, if everything needs an agenda as you've insisted already, what is your point being here? To just spread stupidity and insults? Its so easy and lazy to attack strangers on the internet, and easier to ignore. I'm just curious as to what makes you tick, so to say. If a loved one of yours ever ended their own life, you should feel free to talk about it in whatever capacity feels true to you, even if it's uncomfortable. That's how people move forward. 
---
‚ÄòWalk over to a hook and wait to be hooked‚Äô DELUSION...
---
If I'm reading OP's post correctly, the survs did abuse an current exploit which allows them to loop the window infinitely. OP is correct in him saying that after 3 jumps on the same window, the entity spikes block it so the survivor is unable to jump it again. Presently there is a bug where, in some games, survivors can ignore the entity spikes. In this case, I would absolutely say the abuse of a bug, especially when you KNOW you're abusing it, is toxic.
---
Of course piggy won, have you heard her stun noise?
---
i never max charge, and i usually hit them. -a huntress main, anti-evil dwight
---
If you voted for the hag either your trolling or you have a nasty fetish

Jeez you know I was ready to correct you until I realised you are 100% correct o.0 all of them are definitely at least part human 
---
That looks amazing! I can't wait for them to add this.
---
 1: Coal Tower
---
2: Blood Lodge (Pallet Town)
---
3: Torment Creek (Coldwin Silo Map)
---
Some ideas I had personally for Legion was that Legion had a mechanic similar to Pig's traps where they slap masks on survivors and let them go--a masked survivor has a terror radius and red stain, while Legion themself looks almost identical to a masked survivor at a distance.
---
That, or just play as all four kids and body swap between them as the power.  
---
Both would be way better than what we got IMO.
---
You said you called them cancer. Grow up. 
---
To be fair do we know if the survivors can even see the spikes. 
---
Not on my wholesome, Christian servers.
---
Well, I mean, she has boobies for everyone to see, and some of her outfits can be quite sexy...

I knew the survivor hate would come with that comment. LMAO.

Waiting for the mods to ban this meme like they did with Gru's Plan.

Difference is Gru's Plan was funny.

I understand the weight of that lol, just frustrated in the moment. I‚Äôll use this opportunity to better my behavior in the future
---
Honestly, Rin's story really hit me in the heart, and just left me feeling not good... though yeah, that was the point. Still, as someone who has dealt with cases where people murder their families, it struck a nerve.
---
Yeah that sounds so much fun! He could have a bag of tricks to prevent infinite looping yet it actually requires skill! Kinda like the Nurse :D
---
You missed huntress and Mikey
---
Yes. Yes they can. When I played survivor recently, I can say that I could see the spikes and, in panic, tried to vault over them. To my surprise, it let me vault them, despite the spikes being up. I left the loop immediately after, since I didn't want to abuse an obvious bug.
---
The pebble is too op needs a nerf. Also nerf freddy again hes still invisible
---
Good god, i hope not.  FPS are bad enough as is, they dont need anymore help lol
---
He would defo have a perk called ‚ÄúGet to the Choppah!‚Äù Revolving round exit gates or hatches xD
---
I'm excited for the Switch version but also a little worried. If the PS4 version causes PS4s to turn into jet engines I can't help but think that launching the game on Switch would cause my Switch to explode like a Samsung.
---
Aye, when you look at the PS4 graphics of say, Doom compared to DbD, then look at the performance difference between the two it's staggering. The ps4 is more than capable of handling DbD, but they don't do anything about it.
---
They look like a bunch of chickens
---
I don't agree with clown. My list is this:
---
1. Hag
---
2. Myers
---
3. Spirit
---
4. Wraith
---
I love Huntress but you occasionally feel like you've either been cheated a hatchet or have been given a hit you really shouldn't have.
---
Billy is also nice but his hitbox rn is just fucking massive and broken
---
DOMINANCE 
---
A man of culture
---
was there actual evidence?
---
Yeah i could think of any way to edit the icon and i don't know how to make ones myself.
---
Ochido should be made into a killer in dbd, all you hear in the chase "ADUUUUUUDDD" and "LEETTTSSS DO THIISSS"
---
If you watch the vod (which I‚Äôm not trying to send to just anyone for obvious reasons) you can see them straight up just chilling in the basement the entire time til I slug them
---
The later movies in the franchise were so much better than people gave them credit for dont @ me 
---
Hillbilly and Huntress for sure.
---
I'm sorry but no, how tf did hag get more than Julie?
---
I mean the effect does last for way longer, but otherwise pretty much. Needs some tweaking but these are just ideas.
---
On steam this would guarantee you at least a few comments about tunneling/camping on your profile guaranteed. 
---
This is correct, yet people still dont get it lmao. 
---
Thanks for the feedback.
---
The problem is that if you unhook and three hatch is right there, killer can just grab you off the hatch, OR you're immediately put into a hatch standoff. If a perk like this was put into the game then killers will know it's in the game, then they'll know to watch the last hook and there's really no benefit to freeing yourself I that scenario. It's a bad perk, I'm sorry.
---
There's nothing wrong with noed. If you arent overly altruistic you have nothing to worry about half the time. Its all the survs that dont leave and come back 5 times despite knowing that noed is active that make noed good. 
---
I personally see noed as a counter to insta heal medkits and Adrenaline which do the opposite for the survs. If they can have insta pick me ups, then killers can have insta downs. Fair is fair.
---
Thank you for proving the commercial has merit.
---
Oh damn thanks for the breakdown 
---
Mate, I think you should see a professional. You've got some real personal issues that I cannot help you with. 
---
whats up with all these LGBTQ valentines posts?
---
Most annoying shit ever
---
Thank you! I just wish the devs would get it through their heads and trash them both!
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
The whole franchise is better than people give it credit for. Most think it's just torture porn but it actually has an interesting story to me
---
Me: *I guess I‚Äôll die meme*
---
Man that actually sounds so hype!! I‚Äôd love to play as/against that level of unpredictability!! What perks is he running? Is he a combi pred or a hunter pred? ‚ÄúHe missed his stick throw, get me off the hook before he retrieves it!‚Äù xD
---
Ahh make it so devs! :P
---
Yeah this was just more for like future reference stuff
---
I also like going against a pig and a hag, but I've heard many people complain about pig for some reason
---
I guess this is just the harsh reality/side effect of relying on an automated system, there‚Äôs too many caveats for anything other than a real person to handle this well. I‚Äôm just going to have to keep a level head and do everything by the book next time something like this happens
---
Well, 34 people seem to like the Hag a lot.
---
Huntress can be my valentine any day 
---
Nah I think maybe you should go see a professional since you can't seem to keep your life out of other people's business.
---
Depends. If you‚Äôre doloing it out then you‚Äôre just really at the mercy of chance. A good killer will wipe the floor with survivors if they aren‚Äôt communicating and you‚Äôre only bet is to hope for hatch. Me personally yes, i always go for middle gens first as a survivor. You can always work outward knowing that there‚Äôs more space and pallets around to work with. 
---
What i have noticed is that when survivors work on outside gens (not close to middle of map) 
---
People tend to run towards the middle and if you do that a couple times and then 3 gen yourself in the middle, now the game got that much harder AND now theres no pallets anywhere except the outer part of the map.
---
Legit DH is one of my favorite perks
---
Was I actually camping tho?
---
Susie absolutely demolishing Julie is both hilarious and accurate. Plus, that‚Äôd fuck with the group dynamic so hard
---
Let me just sum up the killers I don't like playing instead. These are the killers I find boring when I play them myself and hate going up against as a survivor:
---
Nurse
---
Legion
---
Every other killer is enjoyable in some way in my opinion. 
---
Oh for sure, ty 
---
Either way, it's a shit move. 
---
If I remember correctly they'll only use rays for totem placement, where they'll fire rays off of totems to see if they're in line of sight of a survivor and use that to keep totems from spawning in places survivors can immediately see.
---
I'm trying to 100% the game and this is one of the achievements I'm looking least forward to 
---
Ok seriously, who is this guy and why should I even care about him?
---
Omg this is WONDERFUL!!!!! 
---
Ah I see 
---
Holy crap, I didn‚Äôt realize it didn‚Äôt count dead teammates. That‚Äôs weak. 
---
I lose so many killers around trees with UE. I love it.
---
On the other side. I've lost so many survivors as a killer from the usefulness of UE. I don't mind it though.
---
V cool.
---
Legion use rate increased to 100%
---
Actually the insect-themed killer would be my personal *shut up and get my money* DLC, cause I have insectophobia :D It doesn't even have to be a full-body insect like in Identity V, maybe human with insect body parts or something
---
I love going up against the Pig. She makes me jump and scream and I love it. She's fun and well-designed, not completely OP or underpowered, and takes a little to get used to. Think it makes for a good combination.
---
Just a little correction: Tripwire uses a modified version of UE3 for KF2 with some UE4 elements backported to it.
---
This isn't my first or even second time getting to rank 1. What more do I need to know about the game to not be "new"? Some people get the game fast, others can have the same hours you or I do and still not "get" it. 
---
I'm only ever surprised by new glitches, which was my point about knowing how the windows work and why this is an issue and not just us being stupid survivors. 
---
uuuuuh nsfw mark?
---
Well Tamar, have you been on this sub?
---
It‚Äôs not crazy OP but I would make it so that you still leave blood trails and it lasts for 10/12/15 seconds because 30 seconds of going ghost is brain dead easy and allows you to get halfway across the map before it wears off.
---
Even with 15 seconds, assuming that the timer starts as soon as you enter the unhook animation you will have about 13 seconds before the perk wears off. Survivors run at 4 meters per second so in those thirteen seconds you could cover up to 50m of ground before you start leaving scratch marks (and blood in the post). If it was 30 seconds you could easily cover 100m in that time, and assuming you don‚Äôt run in a straight line through open areas you could easily put about 75m of distance between you and the killer by the time the timer wears off.
---
On second thought, I do actually think it would actually be a little too powerful. It‚Äôs crazy good on it‚Äôs own already but in the version on the post (not my suggestion) if you combined it with iron will, you‚Äôre just gone mate you have no need at all to worry about whether the unhook was safe or not, and if the killers right there when it happens then as long as the other guy has borrowed time you‚Äôre outta there as soon as you break LOS.
---
They should create a killer called The Mimic which disguises itself as a survivor on the team picked. The Mimic just can‚Äôt work on generators or heal survivors, but he can transform back to his real form and hurt you before transforming back to another survivor on the team once he‚Äôs lost sight of everyone. The only defense a survivor has is the split moment the Mimic uses to change back to his real form.
---
Not sure what his unique perks would be.
---
I hid in the ventilation shaft at the Bee Haviour headquarters.
---
True, especially with Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
I feel his moonwalking exploit is the main thing that needs to be worked out of the game.  His bleedout timer should be proximity based and not go down at all if you're within a certain distance of killer to prevent this.  Sick of watching Legions crutch out their downs with this exploit.

I'm gonna flesh thing out and make a post

Shut up Hag...

Huh, that's weird.
---
 Maybe yours didn't have any edited in songs like I did?
---
Montreal is a world leader in term of software dev. I don't understand how you can fail to see that if you've worked here. Otherwise I can understand you had a shitty team, that doesn't mean the whole province is at fault don't you think?

I would, based on the fact Hoffman was the worst part of the series

Looking forward to it!!! :D

If it dosnt crash first

You aren‚Äôt alone. Started laughing my ass off

O.O

Come on i tought that legion could get any worse, but yeah looks like there is stil a lot of game in my bugs, am i right ? 
---
Depends on what you mean by difficult. some characters are hard to pick up, like Nurse, while Trapper and Spirit are hard to master. Generally, you should not worry too much about survivors not having a good time, they will find a way to be angry if the killer is good, and generally the killers they complain about are pretty fucking bad (Compare the hate for Freddy and Doc to Hillbilly, for instance).
---
If you want the least offensive option still, while still being good and fun i say go for my boy Clown, or pick up the Pig. I rarely see complains about them and they are solid as fuck once you know what you are doing with them.
---
Honestly thoughüòÇ

Hag lacks skill cap though unlike spirit if you go up against a good spirit you're completely helpless there's nothing you can do running they'll definitley catch you and walking you won't make enough distance meanwhile hag has to rely on survivors setting off her traps while spirit has the ability to grab the game by the balls and just do what she wants. Hag also almost always loses a gen at least at the start of a game because she's over reliant on set up
---
Nothing sweeter than getting to five stacks and mori everyone 
---
But the strahm survivor is pretty solid IMO
---
You‚Äôre not wrong there 
---
... on Trapper nonetheless. Survivor main that has been pumping him to at least 35 with BP to have BBQ everywhere when eventually playing killer but for some reason (daily?) took trapper somewhere between level 1 to 4 for one of his first games?
---
A perk shouldn't be bad because it "would be predictable." 
---
Thanks for the shout out.  If you need the rest for any reason, the two most recent posts in my overview are my survivor and killer sets.  I'm not at my comouter so I cant fetch the link at the moment.
---
Plus gotta make sure this reddit gets that daily doses of salty/rant postings haha
---
1.Nurse
---
2.Hillbilly 
---
That's set in stone. If you think otherwise, then you don't know how to play them. Yes even on console... I'm on xbox
---
This isn't horror themed game anymore, more like a comedy themed hide and seek game.
---
Do we have an idea of when to expect the next chapter to be teased/dropped?
---
Well you're all heart, ain't ya?
---
Ochido, toxic cunt that makes awful videos that only 12 years old could enjoy. Banned multiple times for hacking in items, abusing gameplay, sandbagging etc. Recently got banned again on every platform but now there is a new one for him to join
---
Fack I cant tell which is better T posing Myers or legion XD
---
The only viable killer at top level play is nurse. Theres a big gap down to insta-saw Billy and then the rest are leagues below Billy. 
---
Also has one of the best anti loop ability in the game forcing survivors to either get hit or abandon the loop completely 
---
I mean, what other pink offerings to people *ever* use since the moonlight ones were removed? Freddy is *exactly* what they were scared of. Can you blame them?
---
It's a wonder what walking a mile in someone else's shoes can do for your perspective on a given situation.
---
Glad to hear you're not toxic anymore.
---
we don't need no stinkin evidence
---
&gt;Hag lacks skill cap
---
Lmfao. There's the close-mindedness
---
&gt;Hag has to rely on you setting off her traps
---
Which you will. They're for chases. There's the never playing her.
---
&gt;Hag almost always loses a gen
---
Admittedly, yes. Then she locks down the last four or three. In the end, it doesn't even matter.
---
Yamoka Estate for surv because its easy to lose the killer, The Game for killer because its a shitty map that makes almost any killer god tier, and I like the swamp maps for either because they feel so different than the other maps
---
Seriously I can't believe what I'm reading in this thread. Spirit above Billy? Hag above spirit? It's bonkers 
---
And what about Billy?
---
Why doesn‚Äôt Amanda have her mask on??
---
WTF? PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID.
---
dont know how she wasn't boosted twice in that whole time. rank reset man. 
---
Is making it so your low rank friend doesn't get immediately killed because they're a genuinely new player make it ill intent? If a survivor is way better than a killer, the killer as the choice to switch targets. If the killer is way better than the survivor, that guy is dead. Obviously for the story of this one it was most likely ill intent, but I don't think that's the case every time.
---
Imagine choosing Julie over Susie
---
This comment was made by Frank Gang. 
---
The only bit of horror I get is a tier 1 Myers, or an unsuspecting hag clone 
---
They're cherry picking their favorite killers. That's all
---
What about billy
---
Ahhhhhh the old I can Facecamp you from 100 yards away build.  Fair and balanced gameplay right there.
---
Susie, Piggo and Bunnymom are top tier imo. √≤w√≥ 
---
I GAVE A SURVIVOR THE HATCH AND HE SAID "EZ KILLER" !!
---
&gt;close-mindedness
---
Hag has been one of my mains long before her buff I always thought she was good even after her buff but I still don't think she can hold her own compared to the big three 
---
That's just common sense, though. If someone stands up and says "people who act like this are dicks" and someone else gets offended it's most likely because that's how they act. Those who don't see themselves in that either agree or just don't give a fuck, so they're not going to be complaining.
---
kinda weird how people find the drug addict the most attractive...
---
Okay thanks
---
not to late to send him a Valentine's day....may i suggest a David stripper? hahaha
---
not the point, you said she *lacks* a skill cap, whichever is harder can be up for debate as they test different skills but in no way is hag a low skill cap killer like billy
---
OH DAMN IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T SAY JACK AND OR SHIT ABOUT THE TIMER NOT GOING OFF IN CHASES OR DOWNED OR EVEN HOOKED! I JUST BOOTED UO THE GAME TO HAVE A LOOK AND NOTHING ABOUT THAT WHOLE SIDE OF HER MECHANICS!
---
Didn't Coal use to be like the second killer-friendliest map after Shelter Woods?
---
Biggest point of advice I could possibly give you.  At the start of EVERY single game you play assume it's a Myers you're playing against until proven otherwise.  When you get on to that first gen rotate your camera side to side while repairing so you can make sure a T1 Myers isn't about to walk up and pluck you right off that gen.  Gen pulls are for potatoes.  Also if you see him stalking you run away while breaking line of sight as quickly as you can.  The longer he stays in T1 the easier his games are for survivors.  
---
Immagine DbD with a 2v8 mode, more interesting Hunters (they tend to have 2 powers but have to unlock them in-game by scoring hits, though they also tend to have passives) and they don't have an add-on system, and survivors have unique stats and abilities, plus no bloodweb (you pretty quickly get up to level 100 Persona, then you can swap talents(perks) around all you want for everyone on that side) and hunters get an extra power you can select like how in Mobas you get a choseable extra power (like teleport, blink, a ward ("Peeper"), etc.
---
I admire your optimism, but have you seen the Switch Ark port? It's a pile of steaming garbage graphically and future-wise, the framerate is absolutely tanked compared to other consoles, I could go on.
---
30fps for tv and handheld mode? yikes
---
you dont talk very often and when you do its not super captivating. Also are you in a party with other people because i dont think thats being picked up
---
They should make DCing make you loose bloodpoints. And make bloodpoints able to go below 0.
---
This would be 1000 times scarier if it were a wasp. At least bees pollinate stuff, wasps are just assholes
---
Yep, it's the perk that starts out weak and get weaker throughout the game... it's really sad. With everyone dead but one, if that person is injured it adds a grand total of 2 seconds to a generator.
---
dUUUUUUUUUUD
---
drip too hard
---
This was before rank reset actually. Don‚Äôt remember their rank but I was rank 1 so they were around there too. 
---
Some how Moana's voice actually suits Claudette really well
---
If you want to word it like that, you have to understand her competition was a floating, screaming abomination, a grown child, a canibalistic dumpster fire, a partially amputated waluigi wannabe, and a bunch of edgy kids 
---
I actually don't think you're capable of imagining it.
---
My PS4 can handle it just fine
---
I had a friend spectating who died in basement and they said the same thing. Oof
---
just like every other dbd video, ear raping!
---
I support this. 
---
Phillip listen to your bros and also find someone else pls dude it just gets worse from here 
---
I'd agree with you if every other game but Dead by Daylight was fine. It's Dead by Daylight near exclusively for me that lags and has other performance issues.
---
My only consistent way of catching sets is if they consistent play like they have comms, sometimes I can call it coincidence but most of the time it‚Äôs like hey.... sometimes it‚Äôs actually good players reading how the match is playing but sometimes it‚Äôs like ya she told you didn‚Äôt she. That or just hitting that TTv link after to give em a follow. I toss all TTV survivors a follow. Sometimes you even get to hear end game salt rants- mostly people are chill though 
---
makes me wonder how killers like this get to high ranks tbh. 
---
tunneling like this guy. 
---
W O K E 
---
A week or two ago I was trying to prestige Freddy so I was using all my good addons and mories. Three games in a row I had at least one person DC so I let the survivors go. I eventually had to stop playing killer because I couldn't get a single game where everyone stayed
---
You got this Philip! Everybody knows Claudettes sucks at the game!
---
Imagine being such a waste of carbon that you get a hard on by trying to invoke others to kill themselves
---
I make it a point to never take Devour Hope 2 from any bloodweb. Running DH1 means you never get instadowns obviously, but I argue it slightly increases your odds of making it to the Mori stage 
---
I liked Ms. Piggy's stealth, but wrongly thought I wouldn't enjoy her costume.
---
Ah yes, nothing says balanced like 3 gens getting done and now everytime you work on a gen you will very likely take damage and set it back 30%. Thats insane. Every time the killer comes to a gen, if you stealth around and avoid sight, it doesn't matter, you'll still be hit. Combine that with survileance and its free kills. itd be even harder with overwhelming and distressing. IMAGINE ON THE GAME. Also, his syringe is too useless to be powerful. Unlike the doctor, who has a permanent effect on people, this only lasts 30 seconds. Meaning you do it, you hit them, and then likely by the time you hit them again, you could have just hit them twice without the syringe. Maybe it'd save you from the occasional loop but still. Anyway, yeah, the gen thing, no way in hell. That would have to go down to 2 at most, else 3 gen builds would be INSANELY overpowered. 
---
Play DBD on both Base PS4 &amp; PC. The difference is night and day. 
---
I was reading through the killer and thinking "holy shit, this guy is a killer main, this is so fucking op" then I got to the survivor perks and realized everything on here was op lol
---
She didn‚Äôt even try to mind game by running the opposite direction. 
---
Every Colwind Map.
---
Gotta say I have very, very low expectations for this port. From the Direct footage it looks quite a bit worse than the other versions, and the footage was very framey even while they were just in the bloodweb. If DbD runs like absolute crap on PS4/X1 I can't imagine what it will be like on Switch. Maybe BHVR will get their act together, and deliver a stellar port. We can only hope, and just have to wait and see. Also crossplay is a must! Whatever you gotta do please make this happen, at least for the console versions of DbD! It would greatly broaden the player base, and cut down on queue times.
---
‚ÄúHuntress is top tier‚Äù yeah k lmao
---
Where‚Äôs my dislike bomb
---
Hey, guys, if you think about it, it‚Äôs impossible to lose as a killer in this game. Wow, what a humble brag. /s
---
Devs Make the cannon, you cowards

I honestly never get killer cosmetics unless its an event. But i was thinking about getting both of them. They are really cute outfits.
---
I'm really trying to give you the benefit of the doubt, friend.
---
You claimed if all you do is criticize the commercial, you get labeled with being part of the toxic masculinity problem. No one said he was part of the problem until he called the person, "Mr. Soy"... he's calling him a soyboy.
---
After being called a soyboy, he then responds with, "By using that term, you're proving the commercial right". So no, he didn't say he proved the commercial right because he doesn't agree with it; he said proved the commercial right by immediately attacking his value as a man because they didn't agree with something.
---
Lesbi-honest...this is great
---
Real big dick move is playing Green devour hope, and unexpectedly just mori survivors without them even knowing youre running DH
---
Getting to high ranks takes time and effort not skill
---
I just use my eyes when it comes to knowing where the killer is
---
I found killer easy to pip up but also easy to depip. Survivor was harder to pip up (only a little though, still pretty easy) but fucking impossible to depip.
---
M1, which she did eventually. 
---
But it took her a long time because she was running it a bit wide and she also wasted a boat load of time lifting a hatchet to try to hit me with it (you can see her lift it).
---
Mans only goal in life is to get his boi philip a date
---
Ochido, Youtuber that pisses off a ton of people on the internet. Underage rumours surfaced and people used that to make him look worse. 
---
WTF are you talking about
---
IN CHASE, HOOK AND DOWNED, NOT TERROR RADIUS, YOU NON OINKER
---
The best pun I have ever been witness to. 
---
It is a reportable offence, but if you ask me, personally, Meg got what she deserved. I understand that you gotta worry about yourself in the game too, but jesus I've literally had teammates that just sat at the hatch while I'm being chased, and I swear I looped the killer long enough that, if they were doing a gen, they could have gotten it done, and then maybe both of us could have survived.  
---
Moral of the story: Yeah, its reportable, would I have done the same thing as you though? Absolutely, every time.
---
you gotta add skill to. the whole mind gaming and utilizing the abilities in its full is prime for a double pip. 
---
Well it's hidden, what did you expect?
---
Well to be fair, it's pretty normal for PC to have better frames than console
---
REPORT FOR GRIEFING
---
Cutest male killer next üëÄ
---
WIP!
---
See I don't know what specifically makes survivors not want to play against doc, like they will play till the end when they're horribly losing when I'm nurse, but they can be winning and DC against doc on first or second hook. Then again, there is also a tendency for docs to tunnel I've noticed, could just be a bad reputation.
---
if your being tunneled all game your gonna depip. its easier to depip as a survivor then it is to as a killer. you get 1-2 sacrifices if that and still pip. you could do 3 gens and unhook 2 people and die and barely break even. its happen to me countless times.  
---
Yea skill helps but is far from needed. Hence the giant skill gaps between rank 1's and other rank 1's
---
This is so cute, I never expected it.
---
I do love me some Devour Hope. It lets me Mori without feeling bad about it. If you let me get to that point without destroying the totem then you asked for your fingers to be sucked on by a murder-clown. 
---
I will make it legal.
---
Shirtless myers is the most needed new cosmetic and you cant convince me otherwise
---
yeah but just by being okay at the game and bringing good add-ons you can usually get at least a single pip
---
Hmm, alright thanks! This is my first time editing like this so you're advice helped, thanks!
---
Lol now my aim is to be the best Claudette. No immersion just playing the game. I stand before you to be the example of what good Claudette's should be.
---
Untill it is a Huntress then I'll Squee. 
---
One of two things, either you were playing in a way that it was easy to guess your perks, or he pulled his ethernet cord so it read as him disconnecting, which for some reason reveals the perks. Since you say this was happening in other games as well, with perfect accuracy I assume, I'm going to assume the surv is pulling their cord to see the perks.
---
How do you know its his friend? seems to me like its just some random white knight. 
---
No i think making obvious assholes being stopped by good guys, then highlighting the good in men wouldve been better. Instead of the vague scenarios put forth that we're just supposed to assume things about. Or the things that women are just as guilty of, like saying "boys will be boys" or bullying. Really i dont think it wouldve been as much of a problem if they didnt use the phrase "toxic masculinity" which makes people think its generalizing about these things being just a male problem.
---
right. why i feel its easier for a killer to be rank 1 than a survivor. 
---
If you're entirely reliant on a single perk being active to continue playing the game then maybe you should uhhhh play something else. 
---
As a new killer, the best thing you can do is focus on unlocking teachable perks and work on the fundamentals like tracking, looping, etc. DamnNoHtml has a great youtube video called "How to run generic tiles" (or something like that). Don't worry so much about your kill numbers starting out. There's a steep technical aspect to killer that just takes experience and repetition to get down. As others have said, some players intentionally derank to get easier games. 
---
I can't believe the hag got more thn anyone, I would even prefer the Nurse above her
---
I've had nothing but bad luck with killers who run DH.  Cleanse it too close to 2 gens popping and the game is over.
---
Well, I supposed that's subjective, up to a point. I'm not in the business of marketing, so I'm not actually sure how they could have made this message more acceptable, and still impactful.
---
You have to admit though, the commercial got people talking, and their revenue hasn't taken a hit, so for all intents and purposes, it seems to have worked. Other than that, I can't really argue to your other points, because that's outside of my scope to argue.
---
How can survivors be toxic? 
---
Thats honestly your best bet you have at escaping, because people who dc, long before the generators are fixed, are shitty players
---
I think the biggest advantage from pc to console is when comparing pc killers to console killers, but they never actually compete in a match and the survivor side is largely the same on both sides.  Sure, maybe pc survivors can more consistently hit great skill checks due to better framerate but it's also easier to 360/dead hard in the exact direction you need with a controller.  Maybe it would still be a slight advantage for PC, but I think in practice it wouldn't actually cause many problems.
---
If you ever had a pc nurse competing against a console nurse, sure, it would be really unfair but that's not something that happens.  It may be unfair ish at first since console players don't have much experience against good nurses/huntress, but they're not at a significant disadvantage due to the platform itself.
---
If Shape doesn't win...
---
Yeah ur right about that. 
---
I wish I was there to fill in the poll
---
That may be true, but the bloodpoints alone make it a perk worth getting. Makes the grind of this game not as long
---
Your depiction of Claudette is annoyingly cute. 
---
Actually I wanted to put feng min in her  bun instead of jake to give this post a deeper meaning but I couldn‚Äôt find good picture of it :P
---
It's one of those perks that killer mains don't want to admit to being a crutch perk. If they are good at rotating gens and hooking survivors they really shouldn't need it, I've been in games with a killer not using Noed and gets a 4k anyway. 
---
The most annoying however is when a killer that already has an insta-down (i.e. Billy, leatherface, Myers) is using Noed simply cause they can't maintain pressure or just want a 6% movement boost.
---
Ma hart
---
Has he tried not being a toxic piece of shit? that might work
---
I just want Rob Zombie Myers
---
The dev team is slow to respond to problems because they don't have to. They release so many cosmetics and so many people buy them that they have absolutely no reason to care if the game is fun, because they're still making money hand over fist.
---
Would you put forth a significant amount of effort at work if you weren't paid any more?
---
I like to run it because, at rank 1, survivors see lullaby and think "This isn't a problem. Its just a normal skill check with late/no audio queue. Easy." And let me tell you they still miss it hard. The only problem is when they do take it out early, but honestly, in my recent games, I can get it to five stack/get a kill or two before it gets destroyed. Lullaby has helped me secure many 4k's recently, and on the reverse, when I play survivor, I now scour the map for it when I see it's being run, because I know the damage it can do.
---
BRUH LMAO CHILL 
---
Wonder what a Dead by Daylight boardgame would look like?
---
Funny, I actually said the exact same thing in another thread about 15 minutes ago. Myers is their best designed character bar none.
---
Spirit is my favorite. She's all about your personal skill and how good you are with mindgames. A god-tier Spirit can wreck people in chases within seconds, while a bad one might struggle to down anyone. 
---
I‚Äôm not a good Doctor but this video should help https://youtu.be/FI5L1Pvfs3Y
---
She puts on victims' clothing, and hangs throws her hatchets far!
---
It is a crutch on par with Decisive Strike if not worse.  I took it off every one of my killers the moment they removed the pallet vacuum.  It didn't seem fair to run it anymore seeing how much easier chases are now.  And I consistently 3k or 4k without it at rank 1.  Completely unnecessary safety net that keeps killers from learning how to properly play the game.
---
Its not that situational. Any loop with a window or pallet, or somewhere that you can drop down, you can find a way to use it 
---
I had posted some survivor ones last year, and added some killers to the mix for this year (plus a few more survivors). Hopefully someone other than myself gets a laugh out of these. 
---
Happy Valentine's day everyone! &lt;3
---
To be fair, I rather just sacrifice you and move on because watching you work through 2 generator with Ruin active is a massive waste of my time.
---
That sounds pretty cool! It's only on the phone though, right? I'm not too hyped about the swishy phone controls. One of the main reasons why I only play games like Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes where I just need to tap a button, or select an enemy, instead of actually controlling characters. 
---
Just tried hooking up my old first version PS4 and I still get 30+ FPS
---
That woulda been perfect lol
---
you're doing it again, "YEAH YOU'RE JUST MAD YOU'RE WRONG I WIN AHAAA"
---
Just did and I still get decent performance. 30+ FPS
---
DH is great, every time I'm playing survivor and it goes on I just freak out, it puts on a lot of pressure
---
Thats not really true. When it hits 3 tokens, it's usually easy to get all 5, while getting 5 without the insta downs is kind of hard and takes more time, giving the survivors more time to stumble upon the totem or to activate all gens. It does feel very good to suddenly mori a survivor out of nowhere
---
The art seems like  the porn i watch
---
Why?
---
The performance isn't really an issue on the Pro or the X. I have both and know. However most players don't own either console and that is where the problem lies. 
---
Julie users rise up
---
I am not disagreeing on this port could have been done sooooo much better, however, I do disagree on the point that it is unplayable on consoles due to framerate issues
---
pretty much, Im sure I can find a lot of shitty PCs than cannot play the game...like all of my computers are my work haha
---
I don't DC when it gets boken, but I'm telling ya, I am often not prepared for it to get broken
---
Literally LOLed, thank you.
---
fucking love this, that's definitely one of the most fun killer add-ons
---
Compare to pc lol
---
The hag one is the best one.
---
The people who are optimistic about console performance in this case must not have a clue about previous horrible Switch ports, i.e. Ark. And these were games that ran relatively well on other consoles, not DBD in its current half-broken state on consoles. 
---
You're telling me they're going to "reconstruct" the game in time to get all console versions running smoothly before the Switch launch *and* have a smooth port? Right after the assuredly smooth dedicated server launch? The same company that promised an optimization pass for console how many months back in 2018? Why should we believe a "task force" will fix that now? 
---
No amount of game development gatekeeping excuses defending a company shitting down your throat repeatedly and calling it a sundae. It's not even pessimism at this point, it's just respecting yourself as a consumer. You saying they plan to fix it means nothing to console players because they've been hearing that same PR line for a long time now.
---
Ochido ghost wrote this 
---
Um what did Ochido do?
---
Can you make the same post and change survivor to killer? Because this works for both. Would be interesting to see the upvotes.
---
oh my god, what the heck, i can't stop laughing
---
Susie is to The Legion as that Blue Hair + face mask cosmetic is to Feng Min #ChangeMyMind
---
We all know Joe is smashing Susie after school behind the bleachers.
---
Myers or you're wrong.
---
Tom Hardy as David, definitely
---
Rough...I gotta admit I kind of refuse to use that totem anymore ever since they made the horrific nerf to it a while ago to announce its presence like Ruin on the first skill check.  They should revert it back to the way it was.  
---
They're going to announce soon they were acquired by Bethesda that's why they are picking up the skyrim business model.
---
I approve of this ship greatly.
---
I finally had my first time looping the killer for all 5 gens last night and it was against a doctor of all killers.. plot twist: I'm not great at looping. Thanks rank reset!
---
Adam only because I like to troll.
---
The problem with disguise killers is just playing against a group of friends. ‚ÄúHey is that you coming up to me? No? Okay running away‚Äù 
---
Hag&gt;Spirit
---
I thought the same thing. F
---
I don‚Äôt think their doing any licensed killers for a while.
---
Dat ass
---
I'm so excited for this well done
---
ma bois &lt;3 now i want a shirtless dwigth to match david
---
Sounds great for a first game!
---
I never said it wasn't I acknowledge that Billy is easy to play that doesn't mean he's not top tier 
---
Is it okay if I use NOED on Sharp Hand Joe and Trapper
---
Thank you!
---
Did I get hooked or somethin? Cuz I'm dying!
---
OINK
---
THIRTEEN PERCENT??!!?!
---
Oh shit it's Slenderman
---
Personally when I play survivor the minute someone gets instadowned I shift full attention to finding the totem 
---
I can't accept any answer other than Bubba
---
Nope cause deliverance (if that's the right perk, the one where you unhook yourself) 
---
Yes there was. Ardetha made a video on it 5 months ago, here's a link to the relevant bit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBKEa3R1ru0&amp;t=649s
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter. We all know that the people who work on servers aren‚Äôt the same as people as people who port, but money is a resource, and it‚Äôs one they shouldn‚Äôt be spending on another shitty port. 
---
but with lesser graphics :\[
---
dedicated servers will release first in summer and the switch will come out on later in the fall after they've finished with the dedicated servers.
---
They actually just fully launched the PC version. the instructions on where should be findable on it's reddit page.
---
I can talk a bit about the Hunters, as I do have all but Mad-Eyes, but I have tried him.
---
I also play Galaxy of Heroes. I HAD a good group in my guild, but they all abandoned me because I was busy with Finals... One even messaged me one time on discord without even using an @ or trying a DM and then started blaming me for not seeing it while busy with finals...
---
*Ardetha wants to know your location*
---
I'm guessing my glasses are dirty because that doesn't look like Susie ü§îü§î
---
I dont know why but Claudette reminds me a bit of Naho from Corpse Party 
---
And who are you to decide that? Sorry but I'm sure they have financial and business managers that know infinitely more about their company than you do 
---
I take it you came here after watching the Gillette commercial?' 
---
Hag and Myers have the best add-ons to completely change their play style. No teleport Hag, no tier 2 Meyers Etc
---
I mean, I am now, but that's because it's also true. AHAA
---
Dont they look pretty much identical? Dbd killers don't have much in the way of personality.
---
34 people of culture
---
I'm sorry but Freddy has my vote. I mean, did you see his amazing face? Truly wonderful..
---
Yeah I sent those next :P
---
Mfw no bill :(
---
The teachable perks should absolutely look like this. It's so much better than the boring orange color.
---
You did great on this, they look fantastic!
---
Financial and business managers are overpaid morons who don‚Äôt know anything about anything, as evidenced by the 2018 Spider-Man cartoon, the fact that so many thinktanks suck at their job, and the fact that the most popular cartoon character of my generation was made by a marine biologist. 
---
Clearly you haven‚Äôt gotten a good look at The Spirit from behind

Was there actual evidence for that because even though he's super annoying and awful I don't think that's anything to just throw around without backup
---
Ah but yes of course, you know everything about anything. My bad 
---
If you camp.  You're not a main of anything.  Just assuming but based on context it sounds like you're a camper.
---
CAN WE PLZ REMOVE ALL THE REPAIR ENHANCING PERKS AND ITEMS FROM THE GAME SO WE ALSO NO LONGER NEED RUIN. I JUST PLAYED A GAME WITH MY LEVEL 1 MEYERS AND THEY DID GENS IN 3 MINS AND EVERYONE LOST.. THEY SHOULD IMPROVE THE GAMEPLAY FOR NEW PLAYERS BUT ALSO NERF SWF WITH INCREASED REPAIR SPEED ETC. I WOULD LOVE TO PLAY WEAKER KILLERS AND NOT BEING FORCED TO NURSE BILLY + RUIN ALL DAY.
---
I was surprised to see the Spirit outside the Top 3. I mean, look at that fabulous body!
---
Thank you! I worked hard on then, prove thyself was the very first time I've ever tried editing anything at all, I didn't even know how to cut things out on paint last week lol
---
That‚Äôs not what I said. We don‚Äôt need any more BHVR apologists in this subreddit giving them credit for whenever they do a shitty job at fixing the game they don‚Äôt play. 
---
Damn that power is strong af lol
---
I'm not defending any choices they make, I'm saying that they know what is profitable for their company more than you do.
---
You can deny it all you want, but the fact of the matter is you know literally nothing about the company so please stop acting like your answers are the correct ones 
---
I feel like it should only be a thing if you‚Äôre the last survivor. 
---
I like Dwight when I‚Äôm playing with my friends. 
---
Well, he sure has the best face around.
---
Excuse me what the frick? Muddy is sexy af
---
F
---
I wouldn't mine that and a H20 myers 
---
Freddy maybe he's the only killer still weak enough post pallet vacuum removal to still kinda need it though I stopped running it on mine.  Trapper?  Absolutely not he is mid tier man his buff a while back was huge.  He traps efficiently now and his addons are awesome now. 
---
IMHO He very much looks like the remake one

Yes, because the Switch port will definitely be a massive moneymaker, and obviously won‚Äôt be a shitty mess that struggles to break 5 frames per second, and it obviously hasn‚Äôt made the community angry with BHVR more so than usual, and it‚Äôs *obviously* true that they make massive amounts of money off of the existing console ports, and it‚Äôs obviously true that releasing an online only game on a console with the shittiest online service will be an astounding financial choice. 
---
NOED has counterplay (you dont rush gens and search for these easy to find totems 1 is most likely spawning right infront of you glowing in your first 10sec of the game) you can also hide and be sneaky  
---
DS has no real counterplay and will greatly cripple your early momentum if your first survivor has DS. And going for a lucky catch with juggling also wastes time you dont have vs high level survivors. So you not only need more time to catch high level survivor (cuz they are better at looping) they also have dead hard heal up + ds while the others repair faster cuz they hit all skillchecks and have toolboxes or perks to increase speed.
---
I've always loved Dwights from the very beginning, even before the buffs
---
Bond was my go to perk on a g character, leader was really nice to have when friends run it too back when it added 8% to everyone and prove thyself while wasn't very useful with the 3%,it waa still an additional speed
---
Now they're even better!
---
I have to say Nea is my second and Jeff my third 
---
Either Feng or Nea. My usual build is a split between the two of them, Urban Evasion, Lithe, Streetwise, and Alert.
---
STOP SELF HEALING IN A CORNER AND FINISH THE LAST GEN! BOTH OF YOU!
---
That sounds VERY op. So you can just unhook yourself and run to the exit gate?
---
When survivors 3 man hook-dive and cry camper when you soft patrol. 
---
I GAVE A BABY NURSE A SYMPATHY HOOK AFTER THEY DIDN'T HOOK ANYONE ALL MATCH. THEY FACE CAMPED ME. 
---
I said generally speaking, I was trying to avoid explaining "exceptions to the rule". 
---
The Doom port is a nice counter to your Ark example though. That game stays at 30 FPS (which Switch is designed for), and it sacrifices graphics for those frames. But they certainly don't put out games that crash or are super buggy. 
---
Most ports on Switch are quite good and Nintendo doesn't typically allow shoddy games like Steam, Xbox and PS do. 
---
I'm not saying Nintendo is "the best company"; clearly the switch is far inferior (in several categories) than the Xbox and PS4. I just much rather prefer their approach to when a game is "ready to be released" than the other heavy hitters who just release alphas quality and let hype trailers do the selling.
---
Kingfield OTP

I'm gonna suplex you into a bear trap so help me god
---
Trapper is mid tier? I dunno about that. He‚Äôs a worse Hag, simple as that. You have to go out of your way to collect traps from the map, and you can‚Äôt even carry more than one at a time without add ons, so in practice you only have one perk slot because Trapper Sack is a perma pick. The only thing Trapper has over shag is 115 movement speed and the fact that his traps deal direct damage, but Hag is more powerful in every other way and just makes Trapper redundant. 
---
I seriously use this against people all the time in post-game chat.   
---
"Oh my bad, is it against the rules? No? Then it's just your preference." 
---
I think i figured this out. I could be wrong but thats Jennifer Lopez yea?
---
So its Y Jenny Rush. 
---
and then the last picture is a speech where the coach essentially goes off saying "You play to win the game!"
---
I mean unless you have deliverance the odds of unhooking are next to none. And to be fair in those situations the killer is usually camping you and no one is going to save you.
---
If you want a really toxic, annoying build that will usually get everyone to DC, you could use this gross build: distressing, unnerving presence, overcharge, and then one of these: huntress lullaby/ruin/pop goes the weasel. They usually never get gens done. (Especially if you add even more evil and play a game map offering.) 
---
If you want less cheese and a bit of a nicer build, distressing is always nice for him regardless of anything else you run. Then you have a bit of freedom and can run a lot of different things with him. There's no right or wrong build so long as you use common sense. I always say check out Monto for build ideas, because he's pretty creative. I know he's run some interesting Doc builds like sniper Doc and silent Doc. 
---
The big thing I'd suggest is to make sure to use his shock to interrupt people slamming down pallets or going through windows. If you get good at that, you can end chases mighty fast. 
---
I‚Äôm simply giving my anecdotal experiences and I don‚Äôt claim any more than that. I said I don‚Äôt anything about what was promised with patches and whatnot so I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre talking about? This is what I mean theirs just so much negativity and aggression here jeebers.
---
"fuck you"- Peter strahm
---
This is amazing!! 
---
I‚Äôve always thought about this, especially if your the last one left the killer is just going to camp you until you go into struggle and if you do kobe they‚Äôll just down you again.
---
HE NEEDED THE LUBE TO GO WITH THE BEADS
---
His main power is the syringe (The speed debuff is a little low though, probably should instead be 10% slower). The trap can also be applied to gens 5 times, so it doesn't guarantee an injured state every time you try to work on a gen.
---
Chili boi best boi.
---
Ok. But personally I‚Äôm still happy it‚Äôs being ported to Switch and it‚Äôs just kind of funny being this happy about it and seeing all this intense negativity around something I‚Äôm so excited for lol.
---
How do I get aboard this ship
---
Actually that is incorrect. While Spirit and Nurse are both indeed cuties, their screams and moans when hit by pallets are nothing in comparison to Amanda's submissive _eek_
---
Lol
---
Clearly you are a man of culture, what's more adorable than a justified tantrum.
---
Never said I camp, camping is a guaranteed way to lose, I do tunnel if I need to tho
---
I mean pre burns my mans Freddy had game. Big shame my mans went after the 4 year olds instead of  40 year olds
---
Hoffman was a victim of the nonsensical writing in the franchise. He was actually pretty cool when they first introduced him
---
I seriously fucked up when writing this. When the 5 skill checks are dealt with, that gen is no longer trapped. And about the speed debuff, i forgot how small 5% is. Probably should be turned up tp 10%
---
WHY THE FUCK WOULD THEY INCENTIVIZE NOT ATTACKING SURVIVORS WHEN WE‚ÄôRE SUPPOSED TO ATTACK SURVIVORS?
---
WHAT A BUNCH OF IDIOTIC FUCK-KNOBS
---
Against Bill:
---
Windstorm and Swift Hunt for map pressure and fast uncloack. Shadow Dance is also an option for quick pallet break and vault
---
Enduring to endure that "DS" and the pallets.
---
Nurse's Calling to find the injured Bills
---
BBQ to start quick chases
---
Make Your Choice for the same reason as you stated
---
iTs A pAsS nOt A pAtCh
---
Just don't have it effect deliverance, and only effect natural unhooks?
---
NOED can be prevented though, so its at least something that's in the survivor's hands, and kinda ike a second objective. Find and cleanse totems or risk a NOED with a bunch of possible spawns.
---
I played a game with a legion.  Then the next game another legion.  And the next game.  And the next. And the next.  The next day, I got a run of 4 games in a row.
---
Legion t-poses on a nea 2022 colourized.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
I think in the end, it wouldn't matter all too much, given killers would know it existed and smart ones would just wait to hit you again. You're *rarely* within six seconds of a gate or hatch, after all. 
---
Boy casually walked through an entire police station shanking every single officer in it.
---
This is adorable. I support. 
---
Are you an FBI decoder?
---
Usually it doesn‚Äôt make a difference in a chase.
---
Ah yes, the heal dance. And then the killer finds you and if you'd only managed to start it a *few* seconds sooner, perhaps you'd have finished the heal in time lol
---
Bubba because I want him to take my foreskin and put it on his 
---
If second chance made it so I wouldn‚Äôt have to spam my keys during a struggle I would always use it. 
---
I'll clear something up about the trapped gens, once the 5 skill checks are dealth with on a trapped gen, the gen is no longer trapped. So overall they will have to be dealt with only 5 times.  I'm sorry that i forgot to mention that, it makes a huge difference. I acknowledge that Control is op because of killers like Nurse, Hillbilly and Spirit, but could you elaborate on why the other 5 perks are overpowered in your opinion? Any feedback is appreciated, i'm trying to improve the balancing for my fan made chapters. 
---
Dont forget adreniline got buffed in the same way awhile ago
---
Rin x Nurse would be even better because she would be well experienced in changing her bandages! But I appreciate some wlw. Sincerely, nblw. &lt;3
---
Not until the ownership of the characters falls into public domain.
---
They probably should do licenses; it will be nice horse-blinders for how bad the game is. 
---
It'll also increase revenue for sure. Most people want pop-culture reference killers over their hit-or-miss original characters.

You're probably referring to the gen trapping part. I forgot to mention a huge thing about it, once the 5 skill checks are dealt with, the gen is no longer trapped. That makes a huge difference and i don't know how i forgot to mention it
---
I'd see that as balanced, cause if you get off with that 4% I'm just going to be stunned and not know wtf to do
---
Ninja doctor is best doctor.
---
Perks: Monitor and abuse, enduring, spirit fury, overcharge 
---
Addons: stack them calm addons!
---
Strategy: M&amp;A paired with calm addons give doctor a freakishly small terror radius and that is what makes this so great no one expects a sneaky doctor. Stay in punishment mode to keep your TR down and start hunting, end game is when you'll switch to treatment mode to find those last survivor(s) as with both calm addons and treatment mode will make your TR big and you'll be putting them into the first stage of madness thus getting a notification of where they are. Enjoy the salt.

The Doom port was done in collaboration with a great company called Panic Button that handled other successful Switch ports like Rocket League. If BHVR ends up working with them my skepticism will greatly fade away since BHVR might end up learning a lot about optimization in general, although that seems like a pipe dream sometimes.
---
And to counter-counterpoint, the Ark port absolutely does crash and is super buggy. Somehow buggier than the PC incarnation. That's what has me so worried. DBD is in a pretty bad state on other consoles. With all the things BHVR is supposedly juggling this year -between long overdue optimization passes, dedicated servers and now a Switch port - I'd be very surprised if we got a stable, full-featured close to 30 FPS release from inferior hardware anywhere near the deadline when other consoles can barely manage that framerate.
---
Clown definitely

Oh lawd he comin'

says a survivor who probably runs DS and SWFs
---
we live in an entity realm

I'm sorry, but Frank is the only option

Because the FBI made this poll.

No problem man been in that spot too many lol

Oooh gonna check it out now :D
---
The tutorial will hit 30 fps while the game will be at a nice inconsistent 5-10
---
As someone who plays Claudette and has 1600 hours I can confirm I have never done a generator but have much experience hiding in tall grass and corners
---
Ranking up on either side of this game isn't a measure of real skill, but of time spent on the game and really, a measure of the skill of those you're playing with. Bad survivors make it easier for killers to rank up and harder for their teammates to rank up.
---
Obviously, a rank 20 versus a rank 1 killer is going to be a difference in skill, but a rank 10 versus a rank 1 killer probably won't be horribly different in skill level. The system is a bit wonky, but it's the best we have at the moment.  
---
I honestly think with how things are atm it is kinda hard to call high level killers shitty just because gens are done immediately
---

You can bitch in the post game chat on PC. Or am I missing something?
---
It‚Äôs only not against the rules until you start getting banned by BHVR‚Äôs rules.
---
Maybe that are old videos that he had already recorded?
---
But skill isn't needed. You can single pip from horrible gameplay, the game will probably be very short because of you tunneling or camping, so you can quickly move on to the next game for your next free single pip. Seems like you agree so I'm just preaching to the choir but it's worth putting it out there.
---
Not even a buff, literally wouldn't affect the game in either way, killers would just wait 6 seconds to down you
---
Killers would just wait 6 seconds
---
Might be, I guess we'll have to wait until the next chapter/patch.
---
On tier 2 get to 99% to tier 3 and then pop it right when your about to hit a survivor. 
---
Gens getting done doesn't equate a shitty killer. Doing nothing all game, being unable to do decent chases, and camping a survivor hoping to get the rest with noed is what makes a killer shitty. 
---
If I can outplay you in a chase, you are shitty. I am horrible at chases. I am a gen jockey. I hit those great checks and hex checks, I do not run a build for running. 
---
The most obvious thing to do is save up on evil within. Basically, get to T2 as fast as possible then stalk until you‚Äôre just about to hit T3, get close to a survivor then tap the stalk button to activate T3. It‚Äôll shorten chases and is the most popular way to play Mikey. 
---
N'aw, you did it!  
---
Poor Wraith. She better be worth it!
---
It was. Going to play more tonight. Get some BP. 
---
On PC too
---
I heard there's an add-on that allows Myers to be at T3 forever. 
---
I like this, but if they did a chapter 2 I would so want it to be Zepp. He could have the cloak and everything. 
---
On a side note, I've seen the Saw movies dozens of times and I still get confused between Hoffman and Strahm. They're literally the same person.
---
I disagree.
---
In my mind, he was the start of the downfall of the series seeing as it was the second time the series recycled the "Jigsaw had a secret apprentice" twist, and now we're up to them pulling that 4 times... 5 if you want to count his wife....
---
Awww, I'm a console player.  :(
---
The syringe does not damage a health state, and because of that, the survivor doesn't get the speed boost from it either. After hitting a survivor with the syringe, you'll still be as close to them as before, making the actual hit easy to get, so i don't think it's weak.
---
Just look up the movie Mimic.  Use that idea!
---
I don‚Äôt really play him a lot so I don‚Äôt have a lot of other tips but it‚Äôs helps to watch people on YouTube or twitch! 
---
Fragrant tuft of hair. It‚Äôs pink addon that lets you stay in T3 forever but it takes much longer to get to T3. It‚Äôs good but I don‚Äôt really use it.

I'm usually nice in that situation. I wanted a good game too, but alas. Given that I play both sides, god knows I've been on the opposite side of that tank lol

Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck

Did it? In what way? I dont recall all the changes and there were quite some time spaces when i didnt use it

Lead 'em to ruin and let 'em destroy it. But I get where you're coming from too.

Why Do You Type Like This?

I just want to implement "Legion" as a valid curseword in this community

Thats a decent Idea. I could get behind that. Toxic Dc‚Äôers need more punishment imo and that would def do it
---
because i'm a epic gamer
---
funny
---
They are not. Get the fuck away from my post and delete Reeddit immediately please, thank you.
---
I assumed the gen wouldn‚Äôt be trapped anymore after it‚Äôs completed akin to overcharge, so my bad but if I understand you a bit better the gen traps are limited use? I assumed you could do 5 at a time based on kicking or something and you got one back when activated or deactivated, even after a given amount of time. 
---
Limited use powers like the pigs reverse bear traps only work as game mechanics because failure to counteract the ability has an irreversible effect. (Death) The gen trap is cool in theory, but it‚Äôs too weak of a power to be limited use since you can just heal and the killer will eventually run out as the trial progresses. 
---
Good job on the perks tho! Survivalist prolly needs its numbers tweaked tho and to not hide blood, police works should prolly have its numbers the same as nurses calling, and maybe game over needs its numbers tweaked?
---
Love the characters tho so I‚Äôm glad you took the time to make this nonetheless! Good job!

I thought winning was having fun... or am I alone in this?

Okay thanks for the insight I‚Äôm just gonna have to deal with it!

I like how it says cosmetics to earn when over half of the cosmetics (including the ones shown in the trailer) and microtransations only :/

The doc is physically painful for me to play against.  The screaming is really uncomfortable to me.  I have a bilateral hearing loss, and I already need to turn the game up a bit: when I scream it's just insanely loud and uncomfortable.  I will still usually play against him, but I try to spend most of my time on gens.

With what internet?

Harry and Evan could be mining buddies tho

I assume this is the Adept Nurse achievement followed by the achievement for every single achievement?

I'm not implying, I'm telling you. Up and down speed isn't actually speed, it's bandwidth. If you have 1 gigabit speed, it means you can use up to 1 gig at a time. Games don't use much bandwidth. Dbd uses 5 to 10 mb a game. Your not actually playing the game online, you're just sending small packets during the game.
---
Latency isn't just distance from you to the other players, it's also you from your isp. Let's say for example your 5 miles from your isps servers with 15 mb speed, your ping will be relatively low, as long as no one else uses the internet and takes bandwidth. But if you have 1gb speed but are using satellite internet because you live in an area that doesn't have fiber optic internet, your ping will be in the hundreds.
---
I used to think the same thing as you, but other than how many people can use the internet at the same time, gb speed doesn't mean much for gaming. I looked it up a while ago for another game to find out. 
---
They did lol, you can see it in the official forums. We had a contest that included video, fanart and cosplay just last year.

First rule: There are no rules. 
---
I mean, there's good sportsmanship. But a simple gg in the end satisfy that bit.
---
Agreed that Min probably has one of the best - though Claudette and Jeff are close contenders with their altruism-based map awareness which speaks to my playstyle. 
---
Haven't played much Kate yet, though I imagine I'd like her, as well.
---
I don't think their underage. Isn't Frank like 18-19 and he's dating Julie.  Also I think the devs once said everyone in the game is an adult.

[ZERO GENS DOWNSTAIRS ON THE GAME MAP](https://clips.twitch.tv/SlickVibrantDonkeyPeteZarollTie)
---
I love the rain on Mother's Dwelling, but honestly, as a killer main, The Game is my fave. So many dead ends and places for survivors to get lost in while you hunt them down.
---
Lol a normal customer looking in?  He's right, they just want to cash in some more on another crowd without fixing a lot of the shit going on right now on the other consoles.  The fuck you mean dude?
---
We all know Michael would win.
---
It's just "don't teabag". That's it, that's the only expectation. Obviously nobody likes running in circles around pallets all match or enjoys getting rushed out of it, but those are annoyances, there's no expectation that survivors won't loop or focus on doing gens. 
---
I do respect the 4%, and often give the last survivor the hatch if I feel like it. But those are my choices - no one's making me. And no one *can* make me, either - in case you haven't noticed, I'm the one trying to murder you.
---
I think if you have borrowed time it should activate when you unhook yourself
---
The only correct answer is billy.
---
Fuck that.
---
Instadowned, and hooked ok the closest hook.
---
Smacked until the entity eats, digests, shits you out, and halfway into the next trial. Then they close the chat immediately. 
---
I don‚Äôt believe they have a separate Va for Susie and they just use GirlFranks instead. So Susie‚Äôs sounds weren‚Äôt really made with Susie in mind.
---
I understand your fears. I have some as well. But it appears as if a ton of your fears with Switch seem to ride on Ark's issues - which, again, is an exception to the rule. 
---
Nintendo doesn't generally release shoddy work. So I'm more inclined to trust the greater amount of evidence that supports their practices than hinge my fears on one game (Ark) that didn't turn out well.
---
Think of Nintendo as a person - If they normally do good deeds all the time, but then mess up once or twice; are you really going to become skeptical of their moves because of the rare occasion they've messed up?
---
I like to judge companies on the *current* general practices.

I watched many videos and streams since he played on ps4 so ... I know him pretty well.

Claudette.  The healing is great, and throw we'll make it on for supersonic support.
---
Both are crutch but with noed i get kills i feel i dont deserve and with DS i feel sometimes it's unfair and other times perfectly fine.  I play both sides equally
---
I think it‚Äôs mentioned that Susie was the youngest of the bunch and I can‚Äôt remember if there‚Äôs in game text that refers to her as a sophomore (so like 15-16).
---
And didn‚Äôt the devs say everyone in the game was ‚Äúinternationally‚Äù adults? Like a few aren‚Äôt 18 but by law they‚Äôre considered adults in other countries? I know Laurie and Quentin are high schoolers in their home franchises but idk if they aged them up for the game.

Game has no reflection effects and all lighting is static. There will no no benefit from update in our case. Devs will have to rework lighting in the game.

This sub has more survivors, naturally they'll upvote the other version.

I'm a Killer main, bud. When I DO play Survivor though, I play solo with a stealth build. Cool defensive reply though.

I can get 3 sacrifices as Killer and de-pip. I can play like shit, get camped, and die first and still safety, if not pip. Survivor is 20x easier to rank up.

I personally disagree. Noed is just annoying and almost always guarantees whoever just got caught is about to be camped while everyone else runs around trying to find the totem. Devour Hope means that us survivors messed up and the killer probably still won‚Äôt camp if he wants the mori part. Devour punishes survivors for getting caught, noed rewards killers for letting all the gens get done.
---
And you've just proven you're one of his 12 year old twats.
---
M&amp;A is a great perk - I've always been a fan of Overcharge but M&amp;A can really make for some fun stealth builds on Myers or Amanda (or anyone else, really - but those two in particular).

Yeah on the way to leveling my Doctor to 40 I had like 3-4 Iridescent Kings pop up.  Two of them were on the same bloodweb.

---
In an incredibly small loop like that, it would probably be best to try and mindgame it. 
---
This is why I play as Killer.
---
This and the fact that I'm way better as Killer
---
I forgot how little 5% was, the syringe should slow down by at least 10%, that'd make it better. As for the gen traps, maybe increase the amount but still keep them limited?
---
I got the ‚Äòteleport 3 times &amp; grab survivor‚Äô trophy first try when I got it. I‚Äôm going to have to get the 100(?) hits or grabs or whatever &amp; I think the 4 kill game. And than like 2 others.

To be fair it‚Äôs only stacked in killers favor if they have certain add ons/perks and what killer they are using helps too. I‚Äôm not saying gen rushing is bad because really what else are they supposed to do. Gens just can go quickly and you need to get momentum fast or it‚Äôs a gg. 
---
It's just an overall measure of your experience in the game. Higher the devotion , longer the time you have played this game for.
---
I wouldn't think so (?)
---
I mean I sorta' talked in this clip.
---
Not to mention, despite the tight leg wrappings, he's bound to be packing some serious "equipment." -Argument from a Girl I know who voted him best.
---
For a moment I thought that top picture was one of Sean Bean and figured he'd make a perfect Survivor since he dies in almost everything he appears in (except for Sharpe where he's basically an 1800's British Chuck Norris).
---
He‚Äôs such a good listener! And I love the way he looks at me üòç
---
By international adults, they mean 21. Some places consider 21 adult age therefore, if everyone‚Äôs 21, they‚Äôd be considered adults anywhere in the world.
---
The interaction of Police Work with Nurse‚Äôs calling is just the Spider-Man pointing meme. I love it
---
Yikes
---
Can't stand his voice though. 
---
You don't exactly need 4 kills. I had a survivor dc on me when I caught him but luckily I think the quitter bonus still made it valid for the trophy to pop
---
Yessssss Pig‚Äôs scream is so cute! 
---
I like how everyone just understands who is he talking about without even mentioning 
---
Thank you for your friendly and nice comment. I love this non toxic community :) 
---
Yeah I think they changed it a while ago, maybe I did end up getting it.
---
Nope, he was always a stabby Killer. The Developers have revealed this on Stream. You can blame the marketing team for the confusion about the trailer.
---
Why not?
---
OwO is this an original joke? 
---
Wait. 
---
No. It‚Äôs not. UwU
---
[Woah there buddy.](https://imgur.com/fXDgPke)
---
Yeah it's definitely the smart play to remove the MLG looper from the match first, I know a lot of players take it personally but it's not.
---
I took about 3 month break from this game. First game was this guy who DCed right as the last gen popped. DBd never changes
---
1. Freddy is under powered and I believe that his perk kinda balances him
---
2. Nurse is unfixable anything made for here with be super strong.
---
3. Myers can have no terror radius and be completely invisible with the cost of movespeed, so its s better insidious, and the Doctor perk is for all skillchecks in general not just for a gen you kicked.
---
You guys keep calling a human being a pedophile with no solid evidence...your only evidence is a 15 minute video from the discount tru3ta1ent with some discord screen shot of a girl saying "yeah he asked me for pictures." Solid evidence, I am also a rich nigerian prince, send me your credit card info for secrets to the riches.
---
Yes but I wouldn‚Äôt do that. It takes forever to get to T3 and I would just not run that. It‚Äôs fun, but not too viable. 
---
Looking at the distance between Chapter 9 and 10 (84 days) if we took that as a guide we can expect the release of Chapter 11 on March 5th. We normally have PTB for 2-3 weeks so if XI were going to drop, we would see a PTB update next week by the latest. 
---
M&amp;A + Dead Rabbit on Michael and you can gen pull while in Tier 2. So fun.
---
I know full well that the character doesn't really fit and that the devs are unlikely to even take player suggestions. But it is a hell of a lot of fun making them and hearing feedback, so thats why i still do it every once in a while.
---
Overcharge is pretty underrated.
---
He‚Äôs still playing on play station
---
I've never had a single issue like this in ps4 buddy, maybe a reinstall or format? 
---
Nurse and Philip doesnt fit together, change my mind
---
That‚Äôs pretty much his whole backstory, drinking and doing drugs, eating junk food and killing people for the ‚Äúreal high‚Äù
---
r/cursedcomments
---
It's weird that it's an amazing perk provided by the one guy that probably shouldn't use it. 
---
Looping requires skill ¬©
---
And then they all dc and you lose your offerings 
---
What he said^^
---
Oh I‚Äôll be in spirit alright
---
cant mindgame if the survivor can see you unless the survivor is an idiot
---
why r u gay?

Yeah julie and Susie have the same VA, same with joe and frank. Sucks but nothing we can do about it. 
---
I love this series
---
to be fair you have to have a pretty high IQ to run in circles
---
Megs and Neas urban evasioning on the other side of the map while you‚Äôre in the basement üôÉ
---
Alright, don't know if it's still possible, but you used to be able to edit the perk's in the game files. You should give it a shot!
---
Really wish I kept it at rank one. As soon as they start going down instantly, 15 seconds later it's cleansed.
---
There's not a lot of games where you play the role of a supernatural murderer, so survivor gameplay feels like the "default" game mode of DBD from a familiarity standpoint. That, along with the murderer/victim aesthetic, can dehumanize the player who selected killer, and can sometimes give the survivor a sense of entitlement or an expectation that you're here to provide a fun match, not necessarily remove them from it. 
---
Honestly, fair enough. What you suggested is actually fairly interesting, and doesn‚Äôt sound like it would be broken as all shit like a lot of other killer suggestions. 
---
Idk who made the spirit picture so if you know tell me so I can give credit 
---
That's what I actually did 
---
Game's not fun anymore.
---
TLDR: if what you said is true you harassed then on steam and in their stream bc they hid in a locker wnd got banned. What exactly isn‚Äôt working as intended?
---
Distressing, Unnerving Presence are a great combo, I add Ruin and overcharge/Discordance or maybe a Sloppy Butcher as fourth slot
---
On PS4- either I get the infinite loading screen or I get a game crash with the blue screen and error then a report to be sent! After the Legion came out this all started! Before that I never had any issues!
---
It's not going to happen, though. By the time you get even 3 stacks, someone will find the totem or the match will be over.
---
Haha well, mind uploading them? Would love to use the textures.
---
I think after don‚Äôt teabag, the next biggest one is you need to leave as soon as the gates are open.
---
Sometimes those two go together obviously, but many times they don‚Äôt. Killers just get mad no matter what if you don‚Äôt leave immediately 
---
he isn't human though
---
Or they camp the hatch when you're on first hook
---
The movie coming out just lowers the odds of gettin him in game
---
You want all three or a specific one? 
---
sHirTLeSs mYeRS!!1!one!!11  
---
Maybe Joey idk.
---
Tunneling is a thing, but im not all that mad at it, it just gets a little annoying at times. I do take the blame whenever I fail to hide or make simple mistakes that lead to me getting caught 
---
What do you mean getting nerfed? Skill check every 1 second?
---
Most places have wifi, sure the bus might be a stretch, but if I had a hotspot on my phone I would use it for that.
---
plot twist: he's already banned.
---
Salty survivor main detected.   Negative term doesn't exist on side A, but is fair game for side B.
---
Double back on a loop around small debris ? Do you understand what double back is ?
---
Barbeque... there is no "c" tf
---
My ship. It's sailing. I approve.
---
Yeah, but even Psyonix can't even or won't do cross accounts for Rocket League.  I'd say they are way more competent developers.
---
You all know what I meant and still downvote lol
---
Don‚Äôt forget the claudettes. I always feel bad when a Nea plays like that üòí
---
The Ripper sounds quite fun then. I like the idea of spreading fog, so to speak. Very Gothic and quite fitting. Probably a mechanic I could see in DbD as well. I assume the devs take quite a few inspirations from DbD in terms of killer mechanics? 
---
So the Feaster basically has Doctor-like "notifications" that pop up through his tentacles? Both killers sound pretty intriguing, I gotta say. Is it difficult to unlock them (without having to pay for them ofc)? Are any of them going to be gifted to me? So far I only have one killer. 
---
Oh I see! Good luck with SWGOH then :) 
---
It‚Äôs really good. I‚Äôve lost sooo many killers with it. 
---
Gays should kill themselves
---
Damn that‚Äôs one dank shitpost!
---
I mean I don't really care if people call me a shitty killer lol 
---
Tennessee: Wait...that's illegal 
---
Inb4 Jurassic Park T-Rex as a killer
---
If he hides in a locker, his terror radius is gone 
---
Tunneling is generally defined as one survivor being targeted throughout the game until they‚Äôre sacrificed. Is that NOT a thing?
---
‚ÄúNegative term doesn‚Äôt exist on side A‚Äù
---
Then tell me just exactly what gen-rushing is
---
So what does Hag's skill cap have to do with anything?
---
Tunneling isn‚Äôt a thing. They‚Äôre eliminating their objective one by one, just like survivors do a gen. Maybe survivors should be expected to do half their gen and just leave it? 
---
She has a much lower potential than spirit

AHHH so it's a racist issue, that makes sense considering the Reddit community.
---
Well then...
---
It kinda seems like you do.
---
Everyone knows that gg means Git Gud and is only ever said by the "winning" side.  The days of gg = good sportsmanship have long passed.
---
The Houdini combo! I like to run this with Quick &amp; Quiet too, and yeah if you time walking or crouching after the Dance with Me goes away to sneak off somewhere, you can lose the killer quite often
---
Thats been pretty normal for as long as i can remember. 
---
But really why?
---
yeah! i don‚Äôt like that they don‚Äôt let you try and get out if you‚Äôre the last survivor &amp; it‚Äôs your first hook
---
Yeah everyone's probably going to vote for Myers, but I mean he's a daddy and Frank is a cute stabby boi 
---
especially if you're running deliverance.
---
i thought grammar nazism was done in 2012. it‚Äôs reddit not an essay lol 
---
obviously but still 
---
Imagine, you just spawned in, you hop on a gen, everything is quiet, when all of a sudden YOU GET SHOT BY A FREAKING LASER. In the distance you see the predator becoming visible, and you know that he can clearly see your every move as you slowly bleed out.
---
The whole thing about the predator in the original movie was how it was almost always invisible and could strike at any time unseen. I really wanted to capture that in a killer and I think I did it in a fair way. It's like if instead of Michael Myers staring at you he's invisible and you only see his eyes, also he not charging his evil within, he's charging his plasma caster, and instead of screwing your team if you aren't being aware, you just get a blast of plasma.
---
Well yea it‚Äôs pretty rare but it does happen every so often. On maps like the game or Lery‚Äôs I usually get to five tokens because of difficulty finding totems
---
Try it out. See if it works for you. 
---
I personally dont think its all that great. There are a few windows where it can be effective, but more often than not Dance with Me wont do anything if the killer watches you vault.
---
IMO Quick &amp; Quiet coupled with Dance with Me is better and more proactive and allows you to use a better exhaustion perk like BL or Dead Hard. 
---
 
---
Tell that to Salem, Massachusetts or Jim Crow
---
true! it would give more points to each party though 
---
What did you mean? Turn around?
---
No?
---
You don't need to come rescue me, especially if I'm in the basement.  But the killer is not chasing all four of you at once... two of you get on gens, please.
---
that‚Äôs why i titled it ‚Äújuicy 4%‚Äù 
---
I hope you're joking, anyone who dcs is lame af
---
Very. I like to throw Quick and Quiet on there with Lightweight. I call it the Magic Man. 
---
Now you see me... now you don't!
---
HuNtReSs Is A tOp TiEr KiLlEr
---
Yeah just go back or moonwalk and try catch them off guard.
---
Oooow! xO I love this!
---
He would be much better than detective Tape I think. But Tapp works better with Amanda being the killer.
---
Nothing hurts me more than when I'm getting facecamped and all three survivors are just crouched around me waiting to save. Well, except the time I got face camped and then the survivors farmed with the killer so he still pipped
---
Sorry I tried to improve that guy's grammar by showing him that he made an error. 
---
I've tried it and been disappointed.  You really need to have a pretty good understanding of chases to make it work.  Ideally DWM, lithe, QQ, and lightweight.
---
Trapper x Dwight, I totally approve.
---
The hoffinator 
---
I mean, I wrote so much because otherwise there's no killer to play to learn all the ins and outs, if it was an actual killer description it would probably be more brief. 
---
That part I completely understand, but I still feel like there‚Äôs too many timers on too many situations to see where the survivors are at all times.
---
Then again that fits perfectly with the Predator from the movies, I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs too much for being in the actual game.
---
TO MY SHITTY TEAMMATES OF YESTERDAY MATCH:
---
I LOOPED THAT KILLER FOR AROUND 10 MINUTES. THATS NOT A JOKE. I DIDNT EVEN KNEW I COULD DO THAT. BUT I DID. AND YET- NO GENS WERE FINISHED. ZERO. NONE. WTF WERE YOU DOING??? THERE WAS A GUY HOOKED TOO, AND YOU GUYS LET HIM SIT THERE UNTIL HE DIED. WERE YOU TWO TOO BUSY DOING GENS? NO. YOU FUCKING PIECES OF SHIT. YOU WERE LOOKING FOR A LEVEL TWO RUIN. AND DIDNT EVEN FOUND IT IN 10 MINUTES.
---
I DID THREE GENS ALONE. EVERYONE IS HIDING OR BEING CHASED. AND THEN- IN THE ENDGAME, I OPENED THE DOORS, UNHOOK TWO OF YOU IDIOTS, TANK A HIT SO YOU GUYS CAN MAKE IT TO THE DOORS AND THAT NOED HIT ME RIGHT IN THE FACE. KILLER TAKE ME. YOU TWO T-BAG AT THE DOORS AND THEN GO.
---
LEGION TAKES ME TO THE BASEMENT AND LET ME HAVE THE ITEM, THEN SHOWED ME THE HATCH. (I LOVE YOU MAN)
---
AND THEN YOU FUCKERS HAVE THE BALLS TO BITCH IN THE CHAT SAYING THAT IT WAS UNFAIR HE JUST LET ME GO BECAUSE I DID NOTHING AND DESERVED TO DIE.
---
IF I COULD, I WOULD HAVE BROKE YOUR NOSES RIGHT THERE. FUCK YOU BILL. FUCK YOU NEA.
---
SAME HERE
---
1. hes underpowered sure but remember you cant wake urself up, it has to be a teammate and you dont have their auras. He also has your aura in the dream world so you are always exposed to the killer
---
2. When she drops her head thats essentially the only way to get out of her line of sight, if you can see everything no ones ever getting away from you
---
3. making michael myers go invisible makes absolutely no sense, they still have to think about the lore
---
agreed
---
This sub has tainted me, I expected him to show a locker
---
True
---
Mine freezes once every 10 games.  I reinstalled.  Same issue.
---
DBD is the new Payday 2 for consoles... But at least console versions are not behind pc content-wise. 
---
It's good that it's ported to Switch, but I feel like it's going to run in sideshow mode...

Or Nea...
---
I will take your bones and use them to go to the Macmillan Estate
---
Salty killer main spotted. Its an asymetircal game. 
---
Tunneling =/= Gen rush
---
Noed =/= DS 
---
Negative killer thing =/= negative survivor thing. 
---
They are different things and different arguments. 
---
[Eiiihehehehehe.... EEEIIIIIIhehehehe...](https://youtu.be/WJ1zTKdQQ_M)
---
? There is literally nothing the hooked survivor can do. If survivors are being shitty, killers can just...down them and hook them.
---
I mean have you seen Amanda in the movies lol
---
Meh, sometimes you actually will talk with the other players (if solo) and might devise a plan on offerings to use, like all bloodpoints gains or all Reagents or something. That could take more than 30 seconds to get a full consensus
---
edgy teens assert dominance 
---
If you‚Äôre not catching them after that long, then give up. It doesn‚Äôt say anything about your pride to be outplayed and just go find someone else. 
---
Show your work.
---
Idk, but it‚Äôs not the game bc mine hardly ever crashes. 
---
He streams and posts YouTube videos. He gets tons of views but promotes toxicity and griefing. Has been banned multiple times. 
---
It depends, I wrote this to hopefully broaden minds but obviously ya‚Äôll do you.
---
Resetting the rank helps lol. If it didn‚Äôt reset literally everyone would hit red ranks and games would suck even more 
---
It is possible for it to only happen to some people and to be the fault of a bug, you know.  Especially when it happens to so many of us.
---
    **Use:** Thrill of the Hunt, Beast of Prey, Distressing, BBQ and Chili
---
Play any Killer you want, with a lil skill and a lil luck you rack up loads of points.
---
I don‚Äôt understand how surviving is toxic. You do what you can to win. It‚Äôs how games work. Toxic would be t bagging and pointing at the killer in this game. Not looping. (I‚Äôm a killer main.)
---
&gt;Also, fuck off with the whole "Survivor Main/Killer Main" thing. If you dont play both sides your opinion doesnt matter.
---
Shall we add rank + hours to your dick measuring gatekeeping statement?  Maybe enforce linking to a non-private steam profile + stream vods to validate your gameplay?  Do you have quantifiable proof that you are a qualified expert on the game? 
---
I was thinking DWM, QQ, and SB would be good as you can put distance between you and them before you vault which makes it easier to break line of sight and actually lose them. Coupled with UE it could be pretty nasty
---
goddammit, take my upvote.
---
no longer to pip unless you get iridescent in lightbringer and evader yikes dude ill maybe get one or the other never both. also not every person in the lobby can get iridescent lightbringer there isnt enough gens.
---
Only problem I have is Dance with me is the lack of feedback, because you can't see your scratchmarks, but judging by how many killers I use with the combo, it's worth it!
---

---
Okay fine I expanded on that one a little. Obvious you have to reset to make rank meaningful but resetting every month and sending everyone down up to 9 ranks is just goofy.
---
Hardwire or powerline it.  Xbox user.  First game every night disconnects.  Just exit out the first game, close the game down and restart.  It should be fine.  If you are losing BPs, contact the devs and screen shot a few things for them and they will reimburse you lost bps.
---
I mean... everything is relative. 
---
Dwight is def the bottom
---
I was thinking of running Urban Evasion too to make it easier to crouch away after vaulting
---
Yes. Exactly. You shouldn't be able to rank up in every single game. That's lunacy. 
---
I know what you're doing.
---
We blame ochido because he's already extremely toxic, and most of his fan base is people under the age of 18 anyways. So it's very likely that all these claims (a lot) are true.
---
yes but in this system i would never rank up
---
It was just like that, getting flashlight gangbanged and similars. They were completely salty in the end too and called themselves claudette army
---
I use gen rushing as more of a term of when gens are getting done fast. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a thing, but if two gens pop really fast I‚Äôll say ‚Äúdamn the gen rush‚Äù 
---
I just wish generator speed was a bit slower
---
Smart thinking! I usually either have Q&amp;Q or UE because the fourth slot is usually reserved for self-care, but the full on stealth of running Lithe, Dance, Q&amp;Q, and UE makes losing chases a lot easier
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. I got an X1X and it runs sooooo much better than my OG. But even OG wasn‚Äôt bad. The worst lag would come from the menus for me but now it‚Äôs comparable to PC with frame rate. 
---
Thanks for the reply friend. Dont know why i got downvoted
---
That's fine! Good, even! Rank isn't currently inherently tied to any in-game bonus, and wouldn't you rather play against people who actually play at your skill level? What's the point of games at every rank looking exactly the same?
---
Yes, while i suck on gamer girl toes
---
Until the Killer Collision fucks you over and he bodyblocks you.
---
If you really want to make survivors salty... Ruin, Overcharge, Huntress Lullaby and Unnerving Presence  
---
an extra 600, which is standard for any grab.
---
Why do people like you always bring up the race card?
---
Dwight ia a cutie
---
Actually I play more survivor than killer lol. Like a lot more. But after playing killer I see why the killer does what they do. It can be annoying but it‚Äôs valid. Stop assuming about me just of my opinion lol
---
The funny thing about tunneling is that doesn‚Äôt even work 100% of the time. 
---
Thank you! :D always nice to see my creations getting appreciated c: üíï 
---
Like how it was originally going to be a patch in December?
---
Mostly to farm BP all you need to do is play the game.
---
Perks that help with this are BBQ and Chili, We're Going To \~\~Live\~\~ Farm Forever, No One Left Behind, Distressing, and the new Prove Thyself.Other than those perks, the best way to earn BP while playing is to burn a point offering, Cake for survivors and Pudding for Killer.   
---
As for gameplay, just do your best to do a wide range of things, unless you burn an offering for a specific catagory. Remember to use low tier offerings to maximize net gain BP as burning your best stuff all the time may not be worth it. Also for survivors, you don't have to even bring items into the match.
---
The only things that might hinder the amount of BP you acquire per match is the 8000 (8k) BP cap on each category. Perks such as  No One Left Behind and Distressing only make you reach that cap of 8k faster. Note the "\*\*Gain\*\* additional BP" in the text. What you want are "\*\*Bonus\*\* BP" for instance BBQ and Chili at max rank gives you 25% \*\*bonus\*\* per hooked survivor up to 1 time each. 
---
Most importantly remember to level each blood web efficiently, that means you might have to give up a ebony mori for example in order to have the entity eat half a bloodweb, doing so makes acquiring all perks much more efficient.
---
Literally watching the kill count for this right now. 
---
What's wrong with controller? I play with it on PC and have no problems, doing as good if not better than m/KB people.
---
Lol nice meme. 9/10
---
That's far too wholesome, that doesn't belong here.
---
*upvotes anyway*
---
Everyone who says they get gen rushed are just bad at pressurising the game as killer and need to practice more. If you don‚Äôt pressure survivors they‚Äôre gonna do gens, they‚Äôre not gonna AFK in a corner.
---
Not enough spirit love :(
---
Nice deflection, proof incoming. 
---
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this but I think this is something Fortnite does amazingly well. If you play on PC, great. Go to a friends house and they have an xbone? You can use your own profile. Got a switch and feel like playing a bit? Load up your profile! Stuck in a car with just your phone and want to pretend you can play a shooter? S A M E P R O F I L E. 
---
There are exactly two things off the top of my head that Fortnite does that everyone else should start adopting: cross platform play and transferable accounts. 
---
Sadly :(

I have to disagree, by the time Hoffman was introduced Amanda was already dead. He was crucial to keep the story rolling (at least outside of the flashbacks) and was interesting enough to keep me watching past 4. For me the story started going to hell in a hand basket when there was more than one apprentice at a time (didn't it get to a point where Hoff, Jill AND Gordon were all involved in the story at once?) and when they brought in that stupid box
---
Seems right
---
I think you might be able to modify your sound on your computer with a equalizer, possibly reduce the volume for the range the scream is in (probably a higher pitch range). I have a surface-level understanding of audio mixing, I'm not sure how well this would help, but sound isn't super duper important as survivor due to your camera. It's probably worth a Google.  Not sure how to help on console though.
---
wow cam i have a child with you? ‚ù§
---
‚ÄúI think the game should be easier for me instead of learning and encouraging others to learn how to make proper saves!‚Äù 
---
Word of the wise mate, if the killer is in a position to hit you within 6 seconds of the time you are unhooked, then you should not be getting unhooked unless you‚Äôre literally about to hit the struggle phase or get sacrificed. Obviously you cannot control when you are unhooked, but the game should not be made easier for people who do not want to learn how to properly play.
---
Have you seen the fucking adorable fanart he has
---
With the last few events (Hallowed Blight and this Lunar New Year) they‚Äôve been testing adding extra objectives to the game. I think they‚Äôre planning on trying new game modes other than just gens and leaving with these events, but nothing set in stone has been said yet 
---
dead meat eh? love that guy
---
I have literally no idea what you're taking about. No one in this thread has been messaged.. so why even bother to tell me this expecting people to believe you?
---
Beardless Jeff is sad. 
---
Position yourself in areas of the map where you are hidden but can see far enough to reach tier 2.  Use tier 2 with an add on of extended reach.  The more I played Myers the more I realized that stalking too much is a very bad thing.  I like to act like tier 3 isn‚Äôt there and use good perks.  Monitor and abuse like someone mentioned, or even insidious.  Myers strengths are stealth play.  Number 1 piece of advice is to get out of tier 1 ASAP.  After that don‚Äôt worry about popping tier 3 unless you are against really good survivors.  Half the time I‚Äôm down in tier 2 with minimal terror radius.
---
it was most likely an innocent typo. we don‚Äôt all proof read our comments before sending them.

I have, and I love it.

Thanks!

Well killers have bigger hitboxes, trying to play it more close to the structure might just mean you're going to get stuck on something. It's just 110% killers + the fact that she tried to hit with a hatchet, I usually make two or three turns around the water tower before a Huntress can hit me.
---
You don't need to run it as tight as survivors to be a lot faster than them.
---
No not really, because that killer perk doesn‚Äôt effect me. NOED only activates when all gens are fixed, by which time I would‚Äôve already been flipping the switch at an exit gate. Thing is, I always have premonition equipped, so if the killer is coming towards me while powering the exit gate, I go and hide before they arrive and wait for them to leave towards the other exit gate. The killer can‚Äôt be at two places at once. The moment they get far enough, I power the exit gate and escape. If I fail, then I take the blame.
---
he is pretty cute
---
Wtf people it says "cutest", not "hotter", so michael and the trapper lose agains Frank. He's an edgy teenager that throws a tantrum when his power ends, that's freaking cute. Period.

I really like playing around my stacks, not sure whether I‚Äôm allowed to post a link but I once cleaned up a coldwind as Spirit in like 6 minutes by farming stacks lmao. I‚Äôd like to add I was proud to not use the crutch add on that is prayer beads here :)

---
that is absolutely hilarious and i am not being sarcastic one bit
---
The term comes from the old Brand New Part and the coordination of SWF powering the gates in an unreasonably short amount of time.
---
Now it gets thrown out as a blanket term for whenever gens get done quickly and as a back-handed insult toward coordinated teams. 
---
From the killer standpoint, i get the frustration. SWF allows for a level of coordination that the game wasnt originally designed for and really only a few killers have the tool kit to deal with it. Its no coincidece the top tier killers are the ones that can easily get around and pressure the map with their movement options. 
---
I‚Äôm still going through all the comments but so far you‚Äôre either a PC player ignorant to what console players are currently dealing with or just wrong. Very few comments have been pessimistic - they‚Äôre all realistic. This game absolutely struggles on consoles to keep a decent frame rate. PS4 has the strongest console hardware, and even that tends to shit the bed. We start at 30 FPS and regularly drop frames in the middle of matches to the point where it‚Äôs an unplayable slideshow of horror murders. There‚Äôs a lot of other issues that consoles have that PC‚Äôs don‚Äôt but the frame rate issue is by far the biggest red flag. The switch has the worst hardware capabilities of the 3, so if PS4 struggles with it switch will suffer unless they do SOMETHING to mitigate the frame loss. And that‚Äôs not even mentioning Nintendo‚Äôs online service. The thing that struck me the most watching people play Smash Ultimate is sometimes the game just stops for a second and then starts again. There‚Äôs lag, latency, disconnection, and consistency issues plaguing their current online service. 
---
People here love the game and they‚Äôre critical of the company making it because it could all be destroyed at the drop of a hat. They want what‚Äôs best for the games longevity. 
---
Could just be his rank 20 sheep sending him gameplay video's so his crappy voice and his veri funni edits could go in.
---
No it‚Äôs definitely a thing, its why noed is there though. 
---
They‚Äôll break ruin, spend all game on gens then cry when they get hit. 
---
sarah palmer would need to be the survivor
---
The team that works on cosmetics is different than the gameplay team you entitled brat

shared budget and management
---
I Love democracy 
---
yeah I actually would enjoy that too
---
From watching some people, when you see them doing it walk backward so you can watch where they are.
---
hahaha
---
Run up on them and slow down a little right behind them. Be patient and wait for them to start turning one direction and just tap your swing button. Auto aim will tag them. Lunge has no auto aim and can miss.
---
I don‚Äôt know why people are downvoting you. I think the port will be pretty bad unless they‚Äôre proactive about the issues, but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being excited and hopeful
---
Turn around for a second, then back immedately.  Will work on this loop.  Since the survivor is relying on the red stain for this loop
---
I was wondering what this looked like from the survivors perspective. This happened to me as Huntress and it was crazy
---
Of course, but it still can take a lot of time, for sure she could have get to him faster, but you can easily lose a lot of time to a 110% killers like that when you're out of loops. 
---
Can't unsee his crazy twisty angle arm. Less shading - more life drawing.
---
the perks seem a tad overpowered....
---
10 whole FPS? High hopes 
---
You say ‚Äúspend all game on gens‚Äù like theres something else for survivors to do....
---
If you forget the possible pedo thing he's still a bit of a shitty person.

No joke i hate spirit with beads. ƒ∞ts just so annoying when she randomly appears in front of you
---
Oof, you need to update your CPU. 3.2-3.4ghz single core is pretty bad now a days. You also don't own a K so you can't even overclock it.
---
Your CPU is more than likely bottle necking your GPU.
---
Lunge does have an auto aim, which is why if survivors suddenly turn direction during a 360 then your screen wiggles and you miss
---
I back up a hot second, move forward and tap the attack button. It helps you see it all happen rather than wait a second. 
---
I explained how NOED doesnt effect me in an earlier reply so yeah. And at the end of the day I still get my points and rank up when I play so it‚Äôs all good. 
---
First time I experienced that was the last time I played against him
---
I'd say that it has three major flaws:
---
1) It's Frustrating because you could have played a wonderful game and just be short some points to actually rank up because your teammates opened the exit gates for you or the killer didn't commit enough to the chases with you; same for the opposite side really.
---
2) It's Unbalanced because it's not an equivalent to ability. We want to pit ever increasingly good survivors vs increasingly good killer yet Survivors basically need to escape (Iridescent Lightbringer is basically three gens and an exit gate) and be very good at looping while a Killer only needs to keep pressure and do good chases: one side generally needs what is essentially a perfect escape and the other side needs a good game.
---
3) It's Unecessarily Convoluted: A person that is only intrested to pip will not go for saves, will not care to escape he will just open the gates and try to loop the killer for the longest he can; a killer that tries only to pip will overcommit to chases and hook people just to get scores, increasing esponetially the slugging (which gives a lot of brutality points, btw).
---
Yah.. only 12 year olds use emojis. Great logic.
---
It's 9% at the start of the game, actually. It's 3% for each other survivor that's still alive.
---
\*Incoming virgins downvoting just because it's legion
---
when you miss it, it‚Äôs the worst day ever. 
---
Exactly, the proof that isn't really there.  
---
It's a mountain of made up stuff to bring down a guy noone likes. That's cool and all, I just think those sort of defamatory messages are wrong to share about someone without solid proof.
---
i‚Äôve played as the huntress, the shape, and the pig and ended up killing all the survivors lots of times. When they end up escaping, I blame myself for that, not them. Unlike all the main killers in here trying to tell me im wrong, i actually take responsibility for my losses. The only reason I even started this was because of the term itself and how its used are bullshit.
---
Thought this was almost a perfectly looped gif for a sec, until you got hit
---
Hatch grabs are so rare that honestly they should give lots of bloodpoints, but it's only 600 in the Brutality category, like all grabs (Except locker grabs).
---
Spine Chill, Premonition, Urban Evasion, Quick and Quiet
---
Gotta be sneaky Charlie
---
You're still hung up on that, huh?
---
IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF, I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE TIMER STOPPING WAS A VISUAL BUG OR SOMETHING UNTIL I WAS BEING CHASED ON LERY'S WITH A RBT ON MY HEAD. MY TIMER NEARLY RAN OUT A LITTLE LATER AND I ACTUALLY STARTED A CHASE JUST TO STOP THE TIMER WHILE I USED A BOX
---
up the ante gives 9% luck to everyone if everyone is still alive which is 3 times the amount the jar of salty lips gives you, and open handed is pretty bad but 8 meters is actually a pretty substantial boost to some perks that have low ranges
---
OP is a heretic, he does not deserve the glory that is Myers.
---
I'm reminded of that scene from Blue Mountain State.
---
I don't even want to know what the queue times would be like on Switch, us PS4 players are suffering enough, i've been sat in a lobby with one other for 30 minutes already searching for a game.
---
You're welcome.
---
Yea HAHAHHA I totally get this..... (wtf is going on?)
---
Thanks!  My job is actually in this area.  I'm just a bit lazy about finding a solution for something that's so rare.
---
Understandable but they were well made. Hope you keep making them from time to time!
---
This is a very obscure problem; since the majority of people either go the Windows route or the Mac route. Never had a Linux, personally. I know I'm not contributing much, but that VM software should be targeted to run like Windows 10, since that's the latest version of the OS and DBD would likely run best on that. 
---
I know it‚Äôs weird, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre mad that I‚Äôm happy lol.

Hejeheheh sans here.

I sadly agree for Nintendo Switch. 
---
He got 1 more blood point than the person in second place so he did more stuff making him the better player. 
---
Lag will not go away with dedicated servers, though it's likely to improve things AND eliminate lag switching.
---
My flair's time to shine!

That would do wonders for hatch standoff issues.

Well gays do exist ? So why not ?

Kinda wanna buy a switch and dbd for it just so i dont have to fully take a bathroom break... ü§î

I turn with them and slap them. 
---
oh thank god
---
Actually the way it works with overcharge is how it should work universally.  You should have a chance to hit it if you leave.
---
I mean, depending on the killer, they will catch the surv. If that was nurse, one word: Fucked.
---
Why this sub always making me wanna marry ghosts n shit
---
Ikr. 
---
I'm confused why is this tagged nsfw? Cause of the spirit side-ass? That's p weak
---
You're just bringing up those specific scenarios. I and other people have been in situations where we haven't been chasing anyone, a survivor gets unhooked, we continue to search, and the first person we find just happens to be the unhooked survivor.
---
I ment more so on a purely video base, but they did have a lot of really cool stuff on that too.

I did better in 2017 (1 boldness)

they used to let you but for some reason they changed it. not sure why... possibly because it would drag out the game more?? but the games still get dragged out so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

If only you had one more iridescent shard
---
I think you have me confused with someone else. I've never made a joke or comment about that commercial on reddit before today. It seemed fitting considering how silly that commercial was. However, I seemed to have touched a nerve which wasn't my intention. so let me say now how truly sorry I am that you had to endure years of abuse by people who can fold a piece of paper without straining. I hope you recover.

Underated

I get the thicc meme but real shut I would not smash, first off she she fucking died and then you go to grab her thigh and you accidentally dismember her?Imma stuck to ol reliable
---
Yes officer, this post right here.
---
Why would a company improves sales with one division and work on balance and cosmetics with other divisions? That just makes no sense to me
---
Crouching waste a lot more time than you think, I'd love if the survivors crouched around the map , scared of the traps. In a gen rush meta, that would waste heaps of time.
---
If you want further explanations as to why Hag is top tier join this discord: https://discord.gg/
---
People who are more experienced in Hag will be able to explain a lot better than I ever could.
---
Dominate Strategy creates problems in any game. It stifles player creativity and creates an bland and unfun environment. 
---
If every single killer exclusively played nurse with only the best addons and perks. Along with practicing till their fingers bled every game making every match consist of a 5 minute game where they simply slugged everyone. Now  I assure you that you would be complaining about killers being too focused on winning and people would be using your same argument to back themselves up.
---
Instead of this we actually have a very wide field for Killers as many don't like playing the same killer every game. Some killers don't have gen pressure and must instead rely on their perks. And most killers cannot succeed as well as nurse in 5 minutes.
---
Some Killers just want to have a **fun game**. Where they. Get this, *interact* with survivors for longer than 5 minutes. A novel concept I sure, but one you certainly don't seem to understand.
---
The weirdest thing is that the core actual fun element of Dead by Daylight is the chase, doing a gen rush in comparison is holding one button then hitting the space bar every once and a while. And yet people do it as fast as they can due to the fact that the current grind is so god awful and they simply want to win, not to play the game.
---
Ew
---
Thank you, I would like to know how to play hillbilly better without getting too predictable?
---
I mean if that's what you think I just remember to say Ive been called a shitty for such and such dumb reason. I have 1650 hours so I at least have to have some skill on killer so I really don't care what other people say about it lol
---
Now wait until you enter the entity.
---
I PLAYED AGAINST A FOUR GROUP SWF AND THEY ALL TRASHED ME, FLASHLIGHTS, TEABAGGING ETC. NSTEAD OF LEAVING THEY STAYED ON THE MAP FOR FIVE MINUTES. I DCED AND GOT THREE DIFFERENT MESSAGES ABOUT HOW I RAGEQUIT, HOW MUCH OF A LOSER AND NOOB I AM AND THAT I SHOULD KILL MYSELF. GO FUCK YOURSELVES YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES
---
You don't have to take it so personally when your opponent rushes their objective, it's pretty cunty IMO to support the double standard, gens can be rushed but not killers, when it's each side's only objective. It's just straight up entitlement. Nobody likes being rushed out of a match early, but there's no difference between getting gen rushed out of it or kill rushed, just your level of empathy for each side.
---
"I think of myself as above the average person"
---
Cats on devs keyboards when they program at home.
---
Good idea.
---
&gt;You will have the Broken status effect for the rest of the trial.
---
Oh hell no. Basically makes you no mither but with no benefits once you're broken. If it was a timed broken status like Deliverance, that would be alright. But definatley not permanent. 
---
I personally don't think DS needs a rework since it has counters (dribbling, enduring, etc.) 
---
Ex console player here. The frame drops literally killed the game for me. Decided to move to pc. But it‚Äôs still a great game. I‚Äôm honestly eager to play the switch version while laying in bed with head phones. And are you running PS4 pro?
---
I meant for OS's in general. I know DBD isn't compatible with Mac, sorry for the confusion.  
---
Whiteface, in this day and age?
---
it‚Äôd be kind of cool if he could blind survivors with his helmet idk lol. it‚Äôd probably be a shit power but oh well 
---
Is this a joke? Hahaha...
---
... Oh wait, they're serious. Oh God. 
---
The other 75% of the achievements?
---
Every nurse head is already set up for that though...
---
Do you have stupid?
---
Pug as killer: camps with insta chainsaws and ebony moris. calls survivors bad. 
---
&gt;Tunneling =/= Gen rush
---
Yeah it does. A five minute match lasts the same amount of time regardless of how you were rushed out of it. You know you're not *actually* dying, right? It's just the game's aesthetic so I get the confusion, but surviving isn't any more or less noble than killing, they're just objectives so we should all try harder to take it less personally. 
---
This is hilarious omg how hasn't this been thought of 
---
Im open to ideas!  IMO the only nerf DS needs is to non obs, since thats the real bitch.  This change still gives non obs a fighting chance but allows the Obs to get off their DS
---
This would be cool and actually fut in really well
---
Insane defence.
---
Insane map pressure.
---
Ability to be many places at once quickly,
---
Ability to hit many survivors quickly.
---
Ability to counter any loop in 2 seconds.
---
Still able to soft lead players into loops.
---
Hag is mental. 
---
Having multiple independent witnesses for something *is* evidence. It's even good enough evidence that it would be admitted in court.
---
You say that, but I've seen many people confusing *your* and *you're*. It's not like he typed an extra letter or something, he wrote a different word. 
---
And you as a survivor can just go around 99%'ing each gen instead of popping them ASAP when you think the match is going too quickly for your opponent. That sounds dumb as shit though when I say it like that, right?
---
When the game came out, I played a few games with trapper. Since I started playing again, I only play huntress. I like her song.

6 seconds comes with an extra hook progression state
