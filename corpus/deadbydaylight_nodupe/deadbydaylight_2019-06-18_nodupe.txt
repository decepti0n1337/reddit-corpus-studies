That hasn't happened since the Clown released.

---
Lol
---
Mettle of man made me start playing billy, so... there’s that.
---
Honestly I'd take an outfit for Laurie where she doesn't look like she's from a PS2 game
---
I admit, my dumbass took a second to realize this was a joke
---
Honestly it should just make you unable to play another game till the one you DC’d from ended.
---
If you (as the killer) haven’t moved away from the hook for the past 3 gens and I have borrowed time. Fuck you, I’m saving him. When I get downed shortly after it’s not because i got “outsmarted” and  I’m “selfish” it’s because you’re a cunt.
---

---
Directed at someone, but you get the point
---
DEJA VU
---
Glass Bead add on for the map.
---
There are only two full chapters this year. The other two are paragraphs.
---
Created by another survivor's map. Lets them mark where important thing are. :D
---
Its from a map. Its a beam of light all the survivors can see.
---
Honestly the only "good" argument against shit like Alien and Predator comming to dead by Daylight is lore. The Entity has a considerable record of only choosing humans. But the thing is that doesn't matter. They're licensed DLC, they're not meant to be Canon or fit the lore. Their soul purpose is to bring in new people and make fans happier which = $$$$. I'm sure if they had the chance BHVR would 100% put some Alien/Predator stuff in DbD.
---
If a paragraph can now be called a chapter, what could a future paragraph contain? It could be as small as just adding a few generic perks or a new map, but we'd still have to pay for it.
---
Not a BM, and I have to say, as someone that primarily plays killer, I'd be mad grumpy if it kept happening the whole game, but the first time it happens I just have to accept it as a good play.
---
Doing it the whole game mostly just makes it feel like you're trying to make sure the killer can't play the game, sadly.
---
Or when I walk away from the hook to patrol gens. They get unhooked 15 seconds later, you walk back qnd the unhooked guy runs into you. Like, what the heck? You watched me walk this way when I hooked you!
---
I don’t get mad at gen rushing, but sometimes it honesty blows my mind how many gens can be done within the first 2 minutes of the game without ruin. It’s still exactly like you said though it’s just survivors doing their objective
---
I honestly feel like I'm stalking you at this point I seem to find every comment you make
---
Yeah I know it’s annoying. Thank you though

I think you know.

Really? I could have sworn you had to purchase her with shards. My bad then, thanks for informing me.
---
I read a lot about those stats buy i can't find it anywhere, do you have a link?
---
The event probably.
---
You just need to pick and choose when to use fountains, which ones you use, and try to control them. Also, sometimes its worth just hitting them once and letting it build up. 
---
Get good at looping. Surivors are stupid enough to not clense vs her and be broken forever
---
Thundersnail starts to play.
---
plot twist: we get Myra instead.
---
You can’t buy licensed killers with Auric Cells.
---
Auric Cells are the store purchased currency, not shards, which are the ingame rewarded currency.

Whenever it’s Double Bloodpoints the chances of you getting a game are basically slim
---
Yes, it triggers thanatophobia when survivors are broken
---
Equip Barbecue &amp; Chili (Cannibal's perk) and play normal.
---
As everyone else said.   But if you feel like they won’t cleanse use the hell out of that vomit aura add on 
---
I prefer aura reading things over most other stuff
---
Much appreciated!
---
I've heard almost everyone say don't cleanse. Do you think it's a bad idea?
---
Fine if its a killer with a perks.
---
Pretty boring if its just a survivor.
---
do we have a time, i know its tomarrow but what time?
---
I always thought survivors can’t find games cause no one plays killer, not the other way around lol I found a survivor match in seconds right now lol
---
Yeah by the time I noticed it, it was too late to change it :(
---
They say dont  clense but that means they will be playing the entire game with only one hit to down. No matter how good you are thats stupid.
---
..Right...my bad
---
Most likely, though it's viability is questionable.
---
I know they can defend themselves but I'm making a point. If they released a surv, a map, and a killer. People would complain about them because that's just what happens and they won't fix current issues. Which people would also complain about. And the game would stay broken. So they release a small chapter and people complain about the title the DLC has? I really don't understand. They fixed a lot of loop problems and changed map layouts as well. That's new and enough content to fill the rest of the chapter. They made like three new maps with simply recycled tiles.
---
Corrupt Purge feels really powerful to me though. Isn't it worth being broken to avoid it?
---
Just change calm spirit for mettle of man and you should be good to go
---
What’s not.
---
Urban evasion is not a good perk and it will fuck your team over
---
This is the most 2019 thing I’ve ever read

Eye for an eye makes the whole world blind

I'd honestly much rather see the 2018 old worn out Myers mask as a cosmetic.
---
The Archive will be exactly this, but in game, and with more cosmetic rewards.
---
Wouldn't work. The people who would give props are far outnumbered by the people who downvote just to troll or because they're salty
---
Sure. But its still really stupid to try to play the game being broken forever, espcally if you arent a good looping survivor, which most arent.
---
Nah that dumbass shocky boy still holds the title. Cant vault, cant sprint, cant use pallets, screams nonstop, cant heal, vision blurred, skillchecks all over the screen, fake pallets, fake terror radius. I'm sure I'm forgetting a few
---
Gamer grill
---
For me it usually takes a long time probably because of the recent rank reset but long queue times only happen to me when bloodfest is on
---
I have! There's some pretty stiff competition though. Whatever happens, I'm glad I could share this design with you guys and the devs.
---
Explain why please. Yes it only works for the user, but all the perks OP is running don't offer any benefits for the team, because it's for stealth purposes. Urban evasion would compliment this build perfectly.
---
Also, I know. Dat juul isnt cuul kids
---
Then he can host the lobby and his team can go against a rank 7 killer.
---
Haven't used NOED since 2016 but thanks.
---
Thats not bad idea for you guys it should let you remap things.
---
*Exposed*
---
Well good luck on that hook buddy.
---
So he can use his Dream Traps. He'll have dream pallets that explode when survivors try to use them, and dream sinkholes that hinder survivors that run by them. Awake survivors aren't affected, and can't see them.
---
As a survivor main, I agree. I hate it when I am with a SWF who does this crap. I am there just doing gens while the clowns keep going down. Then I get yelled and the killer also. Like wtf are yall talking about, stupid entitled survivors.
---
You're right but the bigger point to me is that killer that do that are dickheads who are ruining someone's game intentionally to be an asshole.
---
In b4 "iT's a lEgItImAtE StRaTeGy."
---
This is adorable. The Entity is Amused.
---
How do you get away with not cleansing? Just ignore it, not get hit, or what?
---
This. If you're gonna unhook anyone in the terror radius of the killer you better have the decency to body block or bring borrowed time.
---
BT only triggers if they're hit while injured.
---
No they both activate
---
You are an enemy of the people.
---
Love watching it, but I wish they’d make more DBD videos than just when new content comes out. I understand the reason for it, but that doesn’t stop me from wanting more.
---
There is a difference betwen not helping and fucking your team over. I get that it is a stealth build but urban evasion can make him craw for the entire game, resulting in a big waste of time that will benefit the killer. perks like MoM or the feather one can be much less harmfull to the team
---
I was a 90s kid and grew up with these movies but I never actually saw them until a few weeks ago. I only went back to watch them because Ghostface was introduced.
---
They’re terrible. All of them. It’s a movie you have to force yourself to finish. Unrelated, I also watched Nightmare on Elm Street for my first time, and it was actually pretty damn good considering it was an 80s movie. That shit must of been terrifying for kids of the 80s.
---
Sounds like all of you need to sit down and chill.
---
Then you’re definitely not a ps4 player, the frame rate drops so badly towards the end of games and when holding corrupt plague.
---
Yea I can agree
---
Probably not going to like this feedback, but I really encourage you not to use NOED.
---
Not that it is toxic or whatever, but you truly do see a difference in gameplay. With NOED you can make a lot of mistakes and still pip. Without it though, you can really build your skills as a killer. 
---
During my survivor rotations, if a killer sucks it is nearly guaranteed they are running NOED and use that as their foundation for kills. Let skill be your foundation, and you'll be a lot more consistently successful.
---
&gt; stares like it's some level of arcane concept to hit me.
---
He's sick of your shit and he's letting you know.
---
What if we had a killer that was based off of LoS like this
---
Go back to whining about MoM lul
---
Scream is my favorite movie :(
---
HOW THE FUCK IS THAT RACIST LMAO???
---
Mindgame the people who expect the mindgame with wraith
---
Use a killer that can easily cap out deviousness. Along with BBQ. Legion is slowly becoming one of my favorite farm characters because he’s so easy to play and cap deviousness. Others are Freddy, Wraith, Leatherface. Basically killers you get deviousness from just playing the game.
---
Epic
---
Just as a correction, looking at the ground no longer causes Deep Wounds to go down. The survivor has to be completely outside of the TR and not healing for the timer to go down now. Healing and being inside the TR stop the timer completely.
---
The road map says we're getting 2 new maps during year 4 and 2 map reworks. As long as the reworks are nice substantial reworks, and the 2 'new' maps are fully new maps, not just a new set piece added to a previously existing map type, then I'll be happy with their map production rate.
---
On the DBD official forums they did call Ash a chapter release as well. Ash as a survivor chapter and Ghostface as a killer chapter evens out so far. Hopefully that doesn't become their standard, and after Ghostface they shift back to the killer + survivor per chapter release style.
---
Until we see otherwise, I'm choosing to believe that ghost face and ash are both individual releases because of their licensed properties, and that their original content killers and survivors will continue to come in pairs
---
Pretty sure I played you and pretty sure you played like an asshole.
---
when the fuck do those drop anyway?
---
Yes and no. It can give you that extra time to get away if you do time it right with the killers swing, you get that distance with the killer missed attack cool down, it can give you the opportunity to gain more distance to try and get to a loop or at the very least the small amount of extra time so team mates can finish or work on gens. Obviously that’s very situational but it does help imo
---
Hahahah
---
Sure but even if no one got upvoted, there would still be enough "neutral" and downvote to sort the toxicity from the standard.
---
Literally first game using it was this sc
---
WTF is this I love it
---
I quite enjoyed 4. My personal ranking of all Scream movies is: 1&gt;4&gt;2
---
Thats it. Thats ALL the Scream movies ranked.
---
Nope, I was born in 1998, too young to have watched it. The first time I watched it was around 2011, right before Scream 4 came out. I’ve watched it many times since. I think the characters are awesome, especially Sidney, and I like the dialogue and self awareness. I thought the acting was pretty good, again especially from the lead and the main supporting cast. I don’t see how the plot is cheesy considering it’s a murder mystery plot with a self aware twist but I guess that’s just me.
---
And for me who tries to double hook everyone its DS after DS with a dose of Adrenaline
---
So they won't work in the real world?
---
Legion doesn't really work that way anymore.
---
Just takes a bit of mindgames and finesse and before you know it, you're rank 1
---
How did it work with Quick &amp; Quiet?
---
Yeah, that's right.
---
Here's the list and where everything unlocks.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Perks
---
I use distortion for that and bitter murmur Im encountering bitter alot more for some reason
---
The 'being hit by a pallet' face.
---
I definitely think nostalgia plays a big part in these things. My sister is a mere 5 years younger than me but it’s enough to make a difference. She’s a newer horror fan but hates Nightmare on Elm St, Scream, F13... she even thought Evil Dead was terrible. I watched all those as a kid though so they pack a nostalgic punch for me.
---
I'll admit I've never watched em heard thier iconic movies
---
I'm still relatively new to DBD but I've made many friends as both survivor and killer that make the game a lot more fun for me. Oh and I just started playing killer and I got my first 4k the other day
---
The problem is mate your definition of scummy seems to be anything but letting you farm basically.
---
That’s quite...Striking!
---
Iron skin with 8 tokens, +57% pallet break speed.
---
With brutal strength, +87% pallet break speed
---
With fire up five stacks, +107% game explodes
---
No... just play the game without slugging or camping....
---
Ask yourself: are they injured?
---
I will do this, I'm gonna play any killer that will fuck an OoO user
---
I think you're just mad that he's right and urban evasion is actually useful.
---
Killers earn more BP.   With an offering and BBQ you can earn 100-115k every match during the event and it’s all controlled by you.
---
This is stupid. Deep wound SHOULD have an actual downside not just be an ability to tank an extra hit. But I guess currently it‘s not a good moment to discuss that since survivors are at disadvantage anyway since the last update.
---
BE has no sense for gameplay balance. And I have thousand reasons to claim this.
---
lmao it was supposed to be shelter. Heck I'm like 99% sure I even typed shelter...wizardry.
---
Tomorrow, actually.
---
Wasn’t sure what the interaction where between the broken status and the perk !
---
Nurses calling - can be meta
---
Thanataphobia - normal
---
Stidor - garbage perk
---
She seems to follow the guidelines.
---
2018 Myers and Laurie both need to get in the game. 2018 Laurie kicked ass and Myers looked creepier than ever.
---
I play on PS4 and I’m on my second controller, and it’s already messed up again, and I have never jammed it or wiggled it violently. It really sucks.
---
I find the Keeper to be such an interesting character, would love to see him on the game! I found his ability and perks to be nice, I think that Hamstring seems a bit too strong but other than that it seems pretty great!
---
Entity want 2 pet
---
I hope you don’t expect a killer that actually runs NoED to understand when it’s useless.
---
"Reality can be whatever I want, including the reality of me getting downed"
---
Yes. That's literally all I have to say.
---
This seems to happen quiet a lot. I am fairly new to the game, so I am still working a few things out. But it seems like I am always being called out for repairing a generator. It's not my fault 3 people are standing around the killer and I am playing the fucking objective.
---
Absolutely stunning
---
+ Fire up...
---
But totems dont last 5 minutes and definitly not the whole game :[
---
On console you can spin/rotate the stick in a circle instead of wiggling it back and forth.
---
Just happened to me. JUST LEAVE ALREADY!
---
Yes mommy rin
---
I guess killers have to pretend to be blind?
---
Freddy is focused on Doc/Trapper or Hag/Doc depending on how his traps work. He has fake pallets and can jump out of gens so probably the latter or a combination of the three.
---
From what was said, he is allowed to choose between traps/pallets depending on the add-ons you take
---
But we HAVE to live forever...
---
Why would anyone wanna play vanilla dbd,
---
#WHOA OH
---
Classic
---
This made me laugh so hard!
---
Yeah and you don't sound salty at all lmao
---
And then they start jumping into and out of a locker or over a window over and over because they're pissed you didn't go after them.
---
WAIT A MINUTE! You forgot the Scream series, both of its seasons! The ONLY other entries in the Scream franchise.
---
Only gives stacks on safe unhooks now btw
---
He probably got this from a blackpeopletwitter meme. Real original.
---
People are just incredibly paranoid, killer nerfs are just so commonplace with bhvr
---
If it's any consolation you did well points wise despite being out-ranked.
---
Can you upload a screenshot of your current perks/options? (:
---
Idk I get more scared when a Myers jumps out on me. Or Pig. Spirit too
---
It’s end game collapse though. What’s he supposed to do?
---
If it's a bad game for the survivers I usually do this tbh
---
The exit gates were opened after I was hooked
---
*insert my user flair here*
---
Yes please
---
It counters NOED, rancor, Myers, Iridecent Heads, Haunted grounds, chainsaws, and most importantly, escaping.
---
Whoa man that's so deep man
---
And I oop!
---
Their dbd videos are so funny, it’s  nice watching people just play for fun.  I’m super excited to see them play ghostface
---
&gt;"DBD OGs"
---
&gt;Shows an event from last October
---
That's cute
---
When I get to my computer I will. On mobile atm.
---
All I'm getting here is some Netflix series called Scream... European Netflix is ass.
---
Literally played 3 games this morning before taking a break. 
---
Game 1 - Prayer Beads Spirit 
---
Game 2 - Jumpscare Myers on Lerys
---
Game 3 - see screenshot (and it was at the farm)
---
Actually had to take a food break and hug myself before returning. :3
---
Lol Scream is terrible but Nightmare on Elm Street is pretty damn good?
---
If you think it’s a shitty meme, then don’t upvote, or even just downvote it, but I am genuinely convinced that you are salty about the post, and you’re just saying it’s shitty to cover that up
---
First one is the best. 2 and 4 are good. 3, while the worst of the bunch, is still worth a watch imo.
---
Please play Freddy, our crops are dying.
---
And tomorrow it's gonna be hearing "WAZZZUUUP"
---
In this game 600 hours is baby numbers, sorry to say
---
On the positive side, even if you get absolutely demolished as killer, as long as you actually try you're going to get a lot of BP. No matter how fast gens pop, unlike survivor, killers aren't out of the match until the match is done
---
It's pretty obvious if hes been stalking the entire game and hasn't gone tier 3 yet that he's got a tombstone.
---
Gen rush like a motherfucker..lol
---
I wouldn’t really know I never played him
---
i’ve never heard that before haha
---
It's Ash. He talks in the lobby.
---
It's Ashe
---
Yeah that's what I thought Thank you
---
It's Ash, he is the only survivor with voice lines currently and he'll say one when you enter a lobby.
---
Man 3 of them were at the exit t-bagging me tonight. I just left them &amp; waited for the match to end, though it’s therapeutic as fuck when you grab a cunt doing it lol
---
It’s so damn annoying
---
You can submit a support ticket.. but farming is bannable, so i probs wouldn't. :D
---
Some A+ sleauthing right here /s
---
Seriously though, its completely possible to face every killer in 3 days, and why would they even lie about it lol?
---
Yeah. Then there's the idiot new wave players who came in and decided it meant the opposite. Number of times I've just ignored rescuing them because they're flailing on the hook, only to witness the killer down someone else on the other side of the map.
---
Then, by the time I finally do get over to the flailing idiot who has been completely safe to unhook all along, they've progressed to struggle stage.
---
Post game chat: "WhY dId YoU lEt Me GeT tO sTrUgGlE?"
---
I hate playing solo survivor.
---
Youre doing the lords work.
---
I agree. I think more people feel this way than you expected.
---
There’s a vid on this sub of a guy killing someone doing it repeatedly. He memento mori’d him haha
---
Noed would have been such a party pooper there
---
haha yeah
---
i think maybe a lag switch ? because at first i think ping wasn't high and the rest of the match went well connection-wise so maybe lag switch. but who lag at the start of a match ? wouldn't that be suspicious?
---
i wish my teammates would appreciate me on this sub when i do something to help them escape
---
This is very insightful for someone who has only played for 3 days.
---
It took me a couple of weeks before I ever saw the clown or freddy.
---
Oh fuck me, i was thinking about playing wraith when i got into the game but I main leatherface... if i could do that (and presumably burn black ward) then.. god damn... that's harsh.
---
 What perks do you run, if you don't mind?
---
Me: you can't just crouch in the corner for the entire 2 minutes I'm hooked
---
My entire team: observe
---
I used it to farm a couple of achievements. Notably, the one where you heal others while injured. Too often, they would try to heal me first.
---
Jokes on you I always play Freddy
---
Yes I want to die
---
What does this even mean
---
true true I always appreciate any help escaping
---
Yes hes good and fun to use.
---
I’ve already run into looping, haha. I can see why killers can get very frustrated. Tbh I think everyone should play both sides because I feel like I get a better perspective now, and why different people get annoyed by different things.
---
It’s only when ash Williams joins the lobby
---
Well he was already tunneling if you hit a decisive so nothing's changed
---
Bubba’s just trying to secure a kill toward the end of a match. It’s his bloodhunt too!
---
i’m filling in the gaps because the lore is so vague _probably on purpose._
---
i think you’re taking it too literally (and you’re not even reading it correctly: you have the event’s orders misplaced) and not thinking analytically here
---
these are not 2d characters!!! think outside the box even though it might be a little hard!!
---
Send this to a ticket on the dbd page and send the killer profile aswell, it will get banned most likely.
---
Guys guys guys, you don't need to wiggle your joysticks to death to wiggle, you can just simply rotate the stick and it wiggles just as fast as going back and forth
---
Out of loop, oOo?
---
Such a good movie 😭
---
OMG, I never thought of Evil Within as a DLC, but it's literally perfect for DBD.
---
Object of obsession
---
this was at the end of July last year . i was cleaning my pc and found it there with a bunch of old gameplays
---
That's sad, well, lets hope he does not play with lagswitch now...
---
well enduring and brutal strength are flat rates while you have to build up iron skin by hindering yourself
---
Still a spoiler tho
---
Adrenaline is great where it is. I feel like folks would be way more mad if a survivor boosted away with adrenaline and then got a good balanced landing burst too.
---
But 99% of the time they'll hit you once then ignore you to go back to the hook. So what, let the teammate die because the killer refuses to chase anyone?
---
Agreed.
---
You know what I do? When you get rushed by a SWF scumbag team and they're all butt dancing at the exit gate, I just walk backwards at the gate.
---
They want you to see them teabagging, they want you to see them escape. This solves that issue and you don't see shit. And they always run out the gate even when you're walking towards them backwards. Shit's hilarious and sad at the same time.
---
-Cries softly-
---
[removed]
---
Plot twist we get Child Lily instead.
---
Object of Obsession. See killer aura when you look, Killer also sees your aura when you look.
---
I usually run two of his perks (The scratch mark one, and the blood one, forget the names exactly) then I run bitter murmur and ruin to slow the game down a *little* bit.
---
Unironically delete this, it's a spoiler
---
I would kill for hello zep
---
I'd rework self-care to reduce bloodstain times by 1/2/3 seconds. Basically as the blood version of lightweight. I'd also make healing yourself at half speed a base survivor skill. Saying this as someone who plays 60/40 killer/survivor.
---
In my opinion a spoiler is a spoiler, and let's be real, the majority of the dbd community has probably never watched the movie
---
Its been a thing for while,i think they took notice that the ash cosmetics were selling well so (currect me if im wrong) evil dead is also owned by the company that owns saw so they decided to give theyre other license in the game cosmetics.
---
Complaining about the Frame rate dropping to 1-2 frames per second is whining?
---
Killer: Your just bad at the game get gud.
---
Also Killer: I can't catch good survivors please nerf
---
stridor spirit
---
To test if the game is well balanced without perks, to maybe crate a gamemode like this, maybe to get info of the killers/survivors perfomance without perks. It can be a lot of things you know...
---
Oh true that, I forgot about Ash
---
I think maintaining stealth, and having no red stain combined with the ease of actually exposing someone is good enough personally. It literally only takes a few seconds to expose someone for nearly a minute, even less than that if you pre-stalked them earlier.
---
Ghost Face is the only stealth killer to maintain his stealth and still be able to attack unlike Wraith or Pig who have to uncloak or make loud obvious noises that they're attacking, or like Michael who in his best moments of stealth, has awful speed and no lunge.
---
When i got unhooked at the basemet twice, she just go after me, even when she axe the bill, she didnt let me exit the killer shack.
---
Lmao Ikr, “Come on chase me and not the person you’d kill to win the game”
---
I thought the Laurie magically teleported to the hay barrel
---
It's a half and half. Yes it is shit when you get gen rushed but there is gen rushing and there is just being competent. It's on the killer to keep pressure up across the map. You cant do much when all 4 bring brand new part and they get 3 gens done in the time it takes you to check 3 but at the same time if they just stay on the gen and you run right by without scaring em off then that's on you. It's a fine line that is easily wrecked by either side depending on perks, addons and killer choice.
---
Very accreate
---
As a killer main playing recently during the double BP, I’ve been really giddy about survivors doing this kind of thing and the majority or two of them escaping. I think that’s so crafty and the pinacle of altruism. It’s really, really, amusing to see them work together and work it out, but also I’m not only inspired for when I play survivor, I always feel like they really fought for that win aha.
---
I only do it if I know I'm distracting him from a hook rescue or so another survivor can get the other gate.
---
The way I see it is that the killer hasn't failed until the game is over. Noed has a strong foothold in endgame builds. Would you say that an endgame Freddy has failed because all the hens are done? No, because now he has entered his more powerful phase.
---
You might see someone drop a pallet the second they get to it. If the killer doesn’t destroy the pallet then was it really a mistake?
---
I have seen a notable increase in people who unhook when it's pretty obvious it's a bad idea in the last few days. I can only assume it's people trying to farm randoms for risky unhooks and more BP.
---
So he's Good and has fun moments. He's mid tier killer probably gonna be used a lto during rank resets.
---
No, it is not subjective. The only definition that matters is the definition of the devs. And they deem camping and slugging as playing the game, farming not so. Because this is a **player versus player** game and the unsportsmanlike report section literally states that it covers actions like collaborating with the opponent.
---
You can dislike these posts all you like, if you're holding another survivor hostage in your game with your shitty farming obsession by refusing to kill him or let him finish gens, because you just must get these points, your actions are reportable.
---
Even if you just work with the killer to farm while you leave another survivor alone to do gens, your actions are reportable.
---
You don't have to like it. You don't even have to agree. That's just the way it fucking works.
---
And once again, remember that all that is being asked of you here
---
This entire unreasonable request that has everyone here's panties in a knots and spamming downvotes
---
Is that when people join the game with you, this asymmetrical player versus player game that only works if people play their appointed roles
---
LITERALLY ALL THAT IS ASKED OF YOU
---
**Is that you play. the fucking. game.**
---
It's part bad manners part good manners. Free hit points.

Where da ghostface at?

Scream is the only slasher franchise where I literally loved every movie and I even liked the mtv series

Just practice your guitar, better than dbd

Freddy is pretty common in low tier
---
Nothing to do with your comment or the post, just realized that people flair tell a lot about them, is like those internet tests that say your personality traits
---
My shit? Is someone assuming I'm a toxic survivor main? Lol. I dont even use flashlights or in most cases I've even stopped using exhaustion perks. I give those people a fighting chance and at the end of the game theyll get a GG and on occasions WP. Win or lose, I'm looking to have fun and I'm not opposed to giving them a few points at the end.
---
Take what is given, nothing less.

Me too! Here's the two together for preview :) https://i.imgur.com/3IWaSrF.png

I play video games for fun. Being stomped isn't fun.
---
No? It's literally about to be worthless
---
Very sexily
---
Big agree. Doesn’t really matter what it’s called, they’re only charging $5 like any other standalone character. People looking into it too deep. The shitposts are whatever, I get they’re just jokes, but some people are really upset over it
---
You didn't ask me but imma step in, run sloppy butcher and nurses calling on wraith
---
When they put out the first few videos on it, I had no idea how to play or what good gameplay looked like. Watching it now, I see all of the wasted pallets and bad decisions, but it works because they’re all so bad. But it isn’t any less entertaining, because those guys are hilarious no matter what they’re doing.
---
The pallet God, on Myers with infinite tier three and play with your food. Speed towards a pallet, walk right into it with no cooldown, break it, then down them.
---
A Wiki that didn't just copy-paste the in game definition's and had actual useable information of how the game and it's mechanic's work
---
well, this was a while ago but i got devotion 2 on console:))))))
---
I'm more perplexed about the fact that they are called paragraphs instead of pages since chapters are made of pages
---
Das facts.
---
I haven't played against Clown yet, but I feel like his description is fine anyway
---
THANK YOU I have been fought on this for awhile. New content is better than no more content. That's what it boils down to
---
You make me sad
---
And OoO has nothing to do... i just stared at her with ooo at the start ( not doing toxic taunts) and the first unhook she didnt even let me get out of the basement, wich is tunneling
---
You get MoM stacks from protecting and unhooking survivors, and iirc it works against all attacks. Far from worthless.
---
I'm just saying that killers are very limited in how they can express themselves in game. We don't have emotes or t bagging. Him staring at you is probably just him trying to get his point across, which is probably just something like "really?".
---
And by "your shit" I just mean sitting at the gate for extra points. Yes, you're totally free to do that and yes, it's annoying.
---
Plague nerf dropped her waaaaaaay down. Also a lot of people consider the legion rework a Nerf (not me, I see it as a buff but to each their own). Also remember Freddy? That idea is scary.
---
Whose ass did you pull that stupid assumption out of? No one's saying they should stop working on gens.
---
And make sure you have an option to exclude perks you don't have
---
The late 90s were crazy.
---
So essentially worthless then. It promotes farming way to much.
---
Good luck seeing that perk ever again
---
Yes he said accreate
---
I feel like hexs would need to be buffed up or have something with them changed. As it is you still lose ruin within a minute of start. Add in points and no killer will ever run hexes again. Noed especially will get tossed out the window. Why waste a perk slot on something they'll be interested in doing as is.
---
What do u guys think, suggestions?
---
Yeah I’m on Xbox playing boosters, same things in r6
---
I'm not talking about pallet looping, I'm talking about more advanced stuff like running jungle gyms (those weird areas with windows/ pallets and walls but not an actual building) and jukes
---
Playing both sides is good though, not only do you learn about what's annoying, but you learn how to leverage that stuff
---
You are a Legend
---
Not even that, because p3 claudette isn't the best camouflage claudette can have, her best camo outfit is a combination of things in the store
---
Yeah they are shifting their content focus from DLC to quality of life and lore additions. Things like new menus, reworks of old systems, new ways to incentivize cosmetic gain. I think it's a good thing, it's nothing but good for players.
---
I think that was actually me and my boyfriend. When was this shot?
---
Wtf it looks like you only played against him by the description you gave on him
---
What

like 2 hours ago on xbox

What it's like to play on console

Or they're just like, trying to get points

Out of all my games today its been 80% bubbas and 20% spirits
---
I love black death
---
3 jumping jacks = come get me
---
non stop = being camped
---
I’d DC if I went against prayer beads spirit
---
The legion rework made him a viable m1 killer. Huge buff to the killers who don't want to bother relying on a killer's power and just want to m1 70% of the time. I'm not sure about the plague changes, and freddy was so long ago that it doesn't even count
---
I'm talking about recent stuff, like map changes
---
Huh how do I do that?
---
Really? I was planning on commenting the same thing!
---
I mean it's true. The discord is really badly handled.
---
Was he running tombstone? Lol
---
People say she had no power, but people forget she gets way easier tracking. Not to mention against a good killer, it's impossible to loop forever so being broken won't help
---
Some people are stupid and have very idiotic ideas of what constitutes gameplay. Luckily for the sane among us, their opinions don't matter when it comes to rules enforcement, only the developers' definition does. You can cover your ears and cry in denial all you want, you are quite simply, objectively, literally in the wrong on this and this won't be changed by your fee-fees on the matter.
---
Farming is NOT bannable.
---
"I am inevitable."
---
Perhaps you didn't read my post.
---
If the hatch is spawned on the map, you're in end-game.
---
Once it's possible to end the match and escape, that's end-game.
---
You don't need 5 gens popped to start end-game.
---
Thus why the hatch opens regardless of gens once there's only one survivor.
---
The chance of someone using the perk in the right way is 0.001%. In 668 hours of game I never saw someone using it in the correct way, and when I played killer it was really a bless to have a survivor using it because i knew I would have time to chase someone down without 3 gens popping up. It was a game changer for the killer side and I loved it
---
He's seen r/dbdgonewild
---
To get ruin, probably.
---
Explained
---
It is stupid sometimes. Playing the entire game one hit down able, leaving tracks of yourself and vomiting will get you killed at some point. You need to choose when to
---
Tombstone and Vanity Mirror, if I remember correctly. The determination was strong since I was dead on hook lol
---
You caught me I love Thanatophobia
---
Pretty good, perk so far.
---
True heroes.

Damn I don't know why I've never even thought about playing as grandma Laurie but I'd totally want that cosmetic
---
Cute ass mf just trying to help the team out.
---
"Hey guys I found hatch! :)"
---
Id pay for this for sure.  Evil Within &amp; Evil Within 2 are sef favs of mine!
---
Finally somone with a brain
---
Plot twist: it’s actually bathtub Ruvik and you are incapable of moving the entire match
---
Working on free weekend in dogelore language
---
Ply survivor and you'll get it. There is a difference and everyone that does it knows what it is... if you get falsely accused.... so be it... but you know when you do it. Dont be nieve.
---
well if he misses that's on him, otherwise his power also has no timer, he can use it indefinitely until either he breaks out of it or the survivor breaks him out of it.
---
Unless the survivors are vigilant he can still very easily stay hidden and at the very least disorient a survivor who knows he's around enough to catch them off guard and at least gain an initial hit on them (which is enough if they're exposed).
---
Again you're acting like it's impossible to just chase a survivor at base movement, you're acting like all survivors are always going to be by the safe loops and know which direction you're coming from at all times, you're also making it sound like you DON'T want the survivors to have a fair chance to at least try and escape him and too buff him even more for using his power, which in actuality isn't THAT hard to pull off currently and the difficulty comes from chasing the survivor.
---
Getting an additional buff for looking at a survivor for ~4 seconds for the next 45 seconds seems like overkill for his base power considering all the other benefits of night shroud currently.
---
This is not to mention any potential perks you could be running on him that can make catching up to them even easier, whether it's anti loop perks, speed buffs, TR reduction, etc. which there are all perks for. such as Spirit Fury + Enduring, M&amp;A, and hell I would argue 2 of his own perks will help greatly with chases. I'm All Ears is basically 6 second aura reading in a loop if you maintain night shroud while they vault, and Furtive Chase seems like a decent alternative to M&amp;A late game.
---
As for your argument on Plague, that's why she's powerful too, because you're essentially either gonna end up with a ranged stream of damage or just be able to 1-hit everyone. I think you're really underestimating how beneficial insta downs are. I'm sorry but I don't get behind the notion that it's impossible to chase survivors as base movement killers.
---
I can hear that pig’s angry squealing. Nice work.

The god pallet is worth more than a mortal's life.

Then I met a Billy main who only used his chainsaw. *Every. Damn. Time*

This shirt isn’t upvoted enough, that’s an amazing costume
---
I don't think the dude was angry actually that Adam ran away and he was given hatch I think
---
Don’t think we know that for sure. Well we know one won’t have a map but that doesn’t necessarily mean it won’t include a survivor
---
I actually want this. I would buy this.
---
Assuming he isn't tweaked before release, he seems pretty good.
---
Urban evasion, light weight, quick and quiet and iron will
---
Multiple survivors can escape the hatch my dude. You can open the hatch before endgame. End game doesn’t have to be started.
---
Interesting... would love to see this
---
I don't even care about killer crutches.  Its the exhaustion and healing back to back nerfs that made all my friends uninstall and forced me into playing killer... which is so stupidly easy it's not even fun to do.  I just do it to level my survivors in hopes that they stop balancing the game around rank 1 death squads and give my friends a reason to come back.
---
Dawn of the final day, 24 hours remain
---
Nibba i have +150 hours and i still can't play against bubba,pls nerf
---
Yeah I run it on her.  It’s a small way to get some
---
People the actually cleanse so you can get the blood pukey.
---
Amen brother. Amen. Me every match running through gens with randos.
---
And now you understand, thank god.
---
Tis why I run Borrowed Time almost 24/7.  Esp,with a Double Bloodpoint event....of I need that last possible stack of We're Gonna Farm Forever and/or just needing an unhook &amp; extra altruism points...plus usually I make it out as well unless there's a NOED on a bad map.....or a Infinite Tier 3 Michael...not gonna stick around.
---
Paid for my life with a Infinite Tier 3 Mori Michael earlier today...didnt realize he had Infinite because I vs them soni frequently xD, just assumed it was extended Tier 3...nope
---
The trick is to be good enough to consistently stay in 10-12 and also be “magically” bad enough to stay there.
---
Because when people whine enough they nerf stuff. 
---
Guess it might work the opposite way too?  Sometimes...
---
Thank you all, I'll get on it
---
You said farming is bannable 
---
not "if everyone is willing to farm it's not bannable"
---
True, it just depends on how you can use it. Wraith can get high speeds but is unable to use it due to it being restricted to his cloaked state.
---
Thank you
---
nice flair
---
It's always fun when you've accumulated knowledge from playing one side to use against them when you switch over.
---
Some interesting ideas! Definitely an example of how you could work around the height limitation by having the killer not DIRECTLY control Chucky.
---
Heh, I never had encountered that build up until that particular game, and it never hit me. I kept asking my buddy \[the Kate\], "Why isn't this guy just feeding off of me to hit Tier III?" Thankfully he flew back to mess with the gate and get him off my back lol
---
I have one problem, huntress players actually like to hit hay bales. They look very scary and need to be killed.
---
Spook Wraith is how he should always be played.
---
Thank you 🙏🏼
---
Why tho
---
iTs A LeGiT sTrAteGy
---
Definitely toxic. Also won't be pipping that match...
---
But I also am cautious with these posts. Could very well be OP or some of the others survivors were being very toxic to start with that caused this reaction.
---
I think they are calling it a chapter cuz they promised a chapter every three months with the roadmap and this is their final “chapter” of last year’s roadmap.

It’s meh

How long do they normally take to reply?

Yep, fuck that.

Last night I occupied the killer while 4 gens were done. Exit gates are powered. I'm running towards one, get downed right beside it and hooked on a hook right nearby. This hook was literally about 5 meters from the gate, with a vault window for easy access and escape as well.
---
The killer was a wraith. They stood in front of me camping the hook, while cloaked.
---
My team mates hovered around him in plain sight, and whenever they went near the hook he started to uncloak but never finished the action, and that would cause them to back away scared.
---
They were all full health and Wraith did not have NOED, plus was cloaked. Gotta love it. The easiest rescue in the century, guaranteed everyone gets out, because he can't even fucking grab them or hit them since he's cloaked. But they're too scared and just end up leaving.
---
I was just told I was camping when I 4ked with fucking Freddy while all the survivors were rushing to save each other off the hooks before I ever even left.
---
However, I still didn't tunnel and would chase the rescuer who would only lead me in close proximity of the hook anyway.
---
They threw pallets without looking behind them and just left the loops, and never left the one corner of the map.
---
But yet I'm the camper.
---
O.K.
---
It triggers on *all* injuries.
---
What did you do boi
---
After I got saved, the pig tunnelled, so I decided to run out the exit gates and die. I didn’t want to risk my teammates’s lives.
---
Wow...just wow...
---
Take off hag from that list, "I fell like playing hag today" - see 2 people with flashlight's -  "never mind, billy sounds better"

Plagues are pretty toxic.

Typical MegHead move
---
Why You talkin shit?
---
The power seems too similar to the reworked Freddy, so with that in mind...
---
* **Sentinel** - I don't know if it's too weak or too strong at max rank. It suffers from the enternal problem of being an Obsession perk. I think the concept is really great but 10% of a gen isn't even that much. To put it in perspective 25% (Pop Goes the Weasel) is only 20 seconds.
---
* **Iron Skin** - Seems way too strong, even as a Hex totem. If you can protect your totem decently this is a 56% stun recovery and pallet break increase. With Brutal Strength you have 81% pallet break speed, and with Enduring you have a flat out 100% Stun resist. There's also the fact that 7% per token is such a random number: I'd set it to something like 5% with a maxium of 8/9/10 tokens, for a maxium of 40/45/50%. Still a bit too strong imo but it takes quite awhile to rack up and is balanced by being a Hex totem I suppose.
---
* **Hamstring** - This has been suggested before and the same response was given: an effect like this can never be added to the game due to Save the Best for Last existing. When combined with STBFL (especially when used on Clown, though I doubt the effects would stack) it would make it far too easy to down a Survivor. Also the cooldown of this perk has little to no impact since you'd only need to hit a Survivor and slow them once in a chase to get the full use. (Excluding Mettle of Man)
---
Overall A for Effort but F for balance.
---
Exactly.

Gone. Reduced to atoms.
---
I run Ruin, Thanat, BBQ and Nurses. It works for me. Add one I use the mangled one, and increasing frenzy. Sometimes I’ll switch Thanat or bbq for Enduring or Lightborn tho depending on the survivors
---
I was gonna suggest a build but you literally have the same setup as me haha. Legion power is just knowledge of where everyone else is after you tag one person.
---
I presume the logic here is. You had a key therefore I’m justified x’ing you out of the game. Dumb logic but hey!
---
they talked about changing it like a day into the PTB. It will only be from protection hits and only work while injured again.
---
Combined with how iffy protection hits are, I guarantee it will be a near useless perk now that only offers niche use.
---
almost every game haha
---
Hahaha perfect!
---
This is more toxic than Chernobyl.
---
Ngl if I'm in a bad mood and you run, coal tower w/ bl, iron works, Léry's library vs huntress or any other semi infinite I might look at you and nod for 15 seconds
---
thank you 
---
i can say the same
---
The brightness issue may be with you're screen which can be altered by messing with the tv and i think bhvr is working on the corn frame drops
---
Thank you! A Chucky chapter could be really cool and I’d hate to see it brushed off because of his height. Tiffany was heavily involved in his killings during his human life and doll life so it wouldn’t be a stretch to add her in as the main killer plus it would give us the option of another girl character, I’ve seen a few people mention we don’t have many that are truly ruthless killers but only kill because of an emotional trauma. For Tiffany her fetish is murderers and psychopaths, she loves to kill.
---
She really does need some cooler cosmetics
---
I run Balanced Landing as well as Bond on every build. I don’t run Self-Care because it’s so slow and Bond lets me find teammates for heals and cranking out gens together. It’s also lets you keep tabs on the killer if you see teammates getting chased. 
---
Other than those two, if you’re going for a stealth build, I’d consider Iron Will, or Lightweight, or maybe Dance With Me with your BL for those sweet 2F window jukes. I like Spine Chill a lot as well though so you could keep that. 
---
If you want a great getaway build and don’t mind using 3 slots, Dance With Me + Quick and Quiet + Lithe is a ton of fun.
---
top 10 most satisfying deaths
---
Guilty as charged on the first front. Personally I have no idea how survivors can complain about a perk they can completely counter.
---
I juggled ds, waited out bt, and slugged against Sabo when they were in their prime, and none of those things are as absolute a counter as breaking totems.
---
As far as how I play surv it is mainly soloq, I often don't get long sessions to play with friends so it's usually one or two solo surv games. I personally don't take surv as seriously so I don't break totems or care if I lose just to a perk, in fact noed games are more fun and intense for me. But to those who care about winning, surely they care enough to cleanse a few totems. I mean survs are always asking for another objective, so it would be cool if a simple totem counter were added.
---
Just saying those settings were recommended to me for her and it works fairly well. 🤷‍♀️
---
One that I enjoy for the hag is dried cicada and rusty shackles
---
That would be badass!
---
Hmmm... yes you can?
---
Battle pass is a good thing, it gives you something to works towards.
---
Y'all hating on it because fortnite popularized it and fortnite bad amirite
---
Oh, you hammered out gens and didn't get downed?
---
**NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!**
---
It is bugged on console. I don't know if the bug a
---
Only happens if you buy the killer with auric cells or if it also happens by buying the chapter in the psn store.
---
This is beyond Myers
---
You got thier ruin and u have a key. That's enough in some people's mind
---
When a killer facecamps, it only takes them a couple of minutes. They can do things before and after. On the other hand, a survivor who gets facecamped is not going to do any generators after they go on the hook.
---
My point is not invalid because THIS HAS LITERALLY HAPPENED TO ME MULTIPLE TIMES THIS WEEK ALONE, IT IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL.
---
When she first started to chase me, I saw the Haddonfield fence, it was long and it had a window. I decided to go round it and surprisingly, she looped it with me 5 TIMES. I’m serious.
---
Actually, they really can do it...
---
And honestly, I'd gladly take it if it's reasonably priced considering how many hours the game already offered me.
---
Can we purchase ghostface with shards?
---
They said there’s gonna be two battle passes one that’s free and the other one you have to pay for
---
For any mods wondering. He's saying "Nice outfit legion!"
---
Everybody loves to say bubba is trash tier, but he's the only killer I can reliably 4k with, tbh. I dont know what it is, but it just feels natural for me to play him as opposed to other killers.
---
This wouldn't work because half the stuff people consider toxic and ruining the experience is utter bullshit.

---
Hag is scary yes, but a good Michael will jump scare you soon enough in tier 1/2 with an add on that makes his terror radius very low 
---
Also spirit with the right add ons can silently appear from behind you and grab you off a gen, pretty terrifying
---
I keep arguing with you in other threads but I totally agree, they thankfully won’t ruin a horror icon like this though. The joke was mildly funny at first but it’s getting old imo
---
if a totem counter were added i wouldn't be pressed about this post. because, then, totems would be an actual secondary objective. as it stands, they don't give any emblem progress nor can you see how many have been cleansed so i don't think you can
---
A broken thumb holding a submarine sandwich. How unfortunate!
---
Try taking the time to find totems against a nurse that is Insta fucking your entire team.
---
People who play like that are just pathetic. Doing this during blood hunt is really frustrating.
---
Something is fucky with her terror radius.
---
Which survivor isn’t readied up?
---
Your Blood Fetish perk is a tunneler's wet dream.
---
Okay okay but what if I was running OoO to practice it because I think it has the potential to be the survivors nurse, do I not run it tomorrow at all and be that weird Laurie who's not the obsession?
---
Toxic nea. What a toxic person for playing nea cuntson.
---
yes, you just figured the meta.
---
Clown description is completely accurate and same for hag
---
Thank you fancyman, very cool
---
Why not just put check marks instead of change the colors of their names? I dunno
---
Oh and just to clarify, I was the survivor in this situation and this was a message back to me 😂
---
I blame the free weekend for ps4 toxicity, tbh
---
I get far more hate messages nowadays when I 4K or loop a killer til endgame.
---
Highly doubtful, you can’t with any of the other licensed characters
---
And no gens were done in the meantime... damn
---
Yeah the thing is if you commit to a chance within the first minute and a half potentially 3 gens can pop in 80-90 seconds, you basically just have to make sure you don't fully commit to chases early on (ofc if you can get a hook within the first 30 seconds def do because it applies the most pressure) and instead apply as much pressure to as many survivors as possible
---
Happy cake day!
---
Every lobby lately I get 2-3 toolboxes and a flashlight... Hardly a team willing to prolong the game so I can get my points too.
---
Been just playing as normal, but not too aggressive. BUT once some prick robs me of a BBQ stack with a flashlight save, then it's go time full-speed.
---
Ik it scares people into healing and thats when you swoop in with nurses. Also I'd sure love BBQ but I prestiged and I've been through over 55 bloodwebs with no BBQ. I'm cursed.
---
face camping at 2.5k hours? wtf grow up.
---
Hi everyone! I painted this as part of my school’s assignment. I read on The Spirit’s lore and found it really tragic and interesting, so I painted what I think would’ve been like when she was being summoned by the Entity after brutally dying.
---
He basically has a free instant down if you use him like Hillbilly players use his close range chainsaw. Just get literally to where you're touching them, then insta down.
---
Try Distressing out, when you hit a survivor with Fury it highlights all other survivors in your terror radius. Hitting the same survivor knocks you out of Fury but hitting other ones refills your gauge.
---
So making your radius as big as possible allows you the extra BP from the perk as well as making it easier to apply deepwounds to multiple survivors in one activation.
---
If you camp the shack, then yes it's easy, otherwise it's just as hard to defend, not to mention you have to be close enough when you drop the survivor so you can even make it there, so it's by chance as well. Not cheap, unless you're a cheap killer.
---
Stolen from r/IdentityV
---
Some day, the devs  will remove/fix infinites. I get mad at them being used cause you cant do anything  about it but as survivor  im too shit to use a normal loop 😂
---
In all honesty  it could be worse, had a killer face camp anyone they downed, no toxicity from anyone, that had 2426 hours and all the achievements.
---
Got them again 2 games later n they did the same thing just on a different  killer. Sometimes  players are just assholes
---
Another benefit is the think as legion you're gonna automatically respect pallets and so they really fuck up the loop.
---
I think their one hit and modifyers for their power is also a key thing considering they can get so many affects without actually needing their perks for it.
---
it was on sale for $8, hence why you see so many people with the mask now.
---
did you manage to actually escape????
---
Camping for me is literally just standing in front of the hooked victim and not doing anything else.
---
There was literally no point in posting this, and you even tried to clickbait people. No wonder you got downvoted into oblivion.
---
Clown main can confirm.
---
I didn’t steal anything. You can’t even cross-post to this subreddit.
---
Isn't your intention when you do that to upset the killer? Maybe that's why it's annoying? Because you're doing it to be annoying?
---
I can't escape it.

# I ThINk wE DId A pReTtY GoOd JOb sO FaR
---
What do you mean? I love the pig, as survivor and as killer! They’re always memey killers xD
---
what does mine mean
---
Just seems like people on xbox only use hag bc they don’t want to camp when they hook the survivors so they set up a billion traps around it and no one ever crouches so they can basically camp at the hooks without having to be there you get ranks and more BP that way and hag is also one of the easiest killers to use even a rank 20 can kill all 4 survivors with the hag
---
I kind of thought so too! I was just having trouble coming up with a third perk. But this perk is just a combination of Unrelenting which at tier 1 has a recovery rate of 25% and perks like NoEd, PWYF, Agitation but I’ve lowered the percentages so it wouldn’t be OP.  Of course this is just a rough idea and I’m open to all suggestions.
---
This guy is so mad about farming lmao
---
It isn’t just during a free weekend or during a bloodhunt. Sure, it can get worse during these events, but lately, this has generally been the overall attitude within the community.
---
disgusting
---
So you just want to make it a second sprint burst that ignores exhaustion? I'd rather not... it's fine the way it is. Theres a reason people like it and a lot of people dont even choose to use it in their load out because of priority for other perks. Adrenaline is useful IF you're alive for all 5 gens, therefore it has a chance to be a wasted perk slot. People know this when equipping it in their load out and should get to reap the full reward if they make it through all 5 gens.
---
Last match 3 Bloody Party Streamers and 2 Escape Cakes were burnt. Basically I felt lazy after a long day so I wanted to be nice and get a daily done.
---
This one Laurie was pretty cool and started farming with me right away. The two Claudettes caught on pretty fast and farmed a bit with me as well.
---
This one David though just didn't get the memo. I downed him with Haunted Grounds (gave the Survivors some totems to clense. HG, Devour, and Ruin were the only Hexes I had) and then picked him up and started hitting a pallet. I repeatedly dropped him and picked him up to let him struggle off faster but he just didn't get it and ran off.
---
Clauds and Laurie farmed with me a bit but David gen rushed to shit and opened the gates while we were all having a great time pallet stunning me. Didn't get as many Bloodpoints as I would've liked but 3 BBQ stacks and some decent Brutality is alright I guess. :/
---
~~Pizza~~ Mori time.
---
Just so he can watch you post this on reddit and laugh at you
---
Probably just coincidental but most pigs I play against end up playing really campy.

Imagine using the space bar.

she’s the definition of a gay who can’t dress tbh

cute nea, this is the same outfit i run for her!

I thought I was in a different sub and I was super confused how a bunch of people started talking about DbD because that game is kinda small isn't it?
---
*Wraith intensifies*
---
Shut the fuck up eric you salty fuck
---
That’s how I am with Spirit right now
---
I want them to switch things up and make chuckus a killer, doll height and everything it would be a fun change and scary i’d imagine
---
When I play killer, most maps don’t have an infinite. When there is an infinite, I simply go after someone else.
---
My thought too.
---
Self care is almost the same speed as the gens, which is ridiculous. Killer just have to pick the 3 gens closest to each other and camp them for a easy win since there's hooks by every gen. I'll play Killer too until they nerf everything back when they do I'm splurging on Auric Cells.
---
I mean she's easily countered by a simple urban evasion
---
Oh I didn’t notice that
---
The doctor that just gave me the trap door after a 3kill
---
It's Monday but I had some funky Survivor matches. Twice in a row I was farming chests with Ace-Hole and Plunderer's while the rest of my team all got downed and suicided on first hook. Twice in a row after the last person suicided I had the hatch spawn right in front of me. I mean yeah I didn't pip in either of those games but I got a nice Rainbow Map in one of them and an Alex's Toolbox in the other. :)
---
For me the campy ones are always the hags and doctors, and basically every killer with an instadown besides Myers most of the time (so both of the chainsaw bois)
---
The memey ones most of the time for me are Myers, Pigs, and sometimes huntresses
---
to be honest I don't know why slippery meat doesn't effect wiggle to begin with
---
Welcome to the killer side. Now enjoy being on the giving side of Moris, NOED and facecamps while being teabagged on the way out.
---
The issue come down to we already have m1 killers, wraith, clown, Freddy, hell even doc. I've made comparisons before but right now he just feels like a worse wraith
---
BBQ and chilling. Hex thrill of the hunt. Distressing. Blood warden. 
---
Doing these with Freddie or the trapper easily gives me 70-100k bp per game.
---
Anywhere between 48 hours to a week.
---
If they could make it work, I think it could definitely be terrifying and very cool. It’s just his height would be a huge problem if he was the main killer, his FOV would be so poor they’d have to give him a 360 view like survivors.
---
Most of the times it’s just by losing sight of the players, also when it’s SWF, what’re you going to do. 🤷‍♀️
---
I need it
---
Blur those names out friend
---
when you get unhooked with adrenaline, ds and mettle active with borrowed time in the end game.
---
Yeah the only decent ones are Jeremy and Ryan. But I love watching them play lol. Especially Gavin playing the hag
---
oh so basically me
---
You're correct, and beforehand I always state that, I personally think he's a decent player. That is all I'm going to say about it. I don't come to this subreddit to argue or start shit. I come here for news, to help people and for the occasional meme. With 2.5k hours I enjoy this game to a degree just like everyone else. gg.
---
hello fellow unfashionable member of the homosexual variety
---
In those games it's usually easy to see who the rank 16 or low rank survivors are, kill them first so that they have less people to alternate between working gens. That's usually what I do. If I see that some of them can loop extremely well, and some of them just sprint burst into walls when they see me, can tell that the latter are newer players. It's going to be painful for those newer players though. So, you'll either have to deal with extreme salt, or find a way to not trigger them, like maybe slugging the newer survivors so they don't straight up die, but can't work on gens, then looking for the more experienced players and killing them before you decide what to do with the slugged survivors.
---
Momma Bird is just feeding it's younglings. Open wide child, it's dinner time.
---
Has the ranking system been talked about by devs
---
would be interesting if a killer was 3rd person i’d wanna see chuckus be able to laugh very loud ha
---
No unfortunately
---
Next level editing.
---
keeps autocorrecting to chuckus idk why
---
Lol I had a game where I let the survivors escape and one of them was like "just play the damn game, hate people who farm". Didn't know that even getting free wins and bloodpoints upset people.
---
I keep getting perks I really don't want. Like thanks entity I apprciate the monstrous shrine.
---
The entire meme was about the Discord not being badly handled..
---
Some survivors (like myself) just dont want to farm. Reason? Idk his but my reasoning is i still want to earn my bloodpoints regardless of anything however i dont do that as killer if survivors want to farm so be it ill let em.
---

Perhaps you cannot read. He was asking if it existed, not if it was hidden. 
---
tfw you're so caught up in wanting to reply you drop all your logic
---
I just did that so this exact meme I made wouldn’t get stolen
---
The entire concept of NOED in the first place is meant to be a mindgame and help prevent the game from being rushed through.
---
Survivors are supposed to think, "Is this killer going to run NOED? maybe i should cleanse whatever totems i see" This way even killers who don't run NOED benefit from it just existing in the first place.
---
There's more than one!?
---
Doctor is spot on, haha. It's good you get to see Freddy in his current state before he starts jumping up the tier lists with his rework.
---
Called out
---
I wouldn't mind a totem counter but only if it was a perk or bundled into Small game. Having a universal totem counter would make hex perks useless and they would never proc.
---
I'm refuse to play against either of them so don't waste your money.
---
“Cool to play against” on The Pig..she scare me :( 
---
I don’t ever DC because that’s just rude but every time I see her, Myers or Wraith I just want to literally disappear. Stealth killers are the scariest part of the game IMO. But I definitely agree with the Hag. She’s terrifying in appearance and abilities.
---
Perfect!

---
I love this
---
I know. And I said "But it is true," as a rebuttal to your point.
---
Darn Blendettes.
---
I don't have many perks as her and I'm just using the ones I have
---
Are there really heartless monsters out there stealing memes? Aren't they thinking about how this affects people?
---
Oh I'm sorry! I assumed you had the basic ability of common sense and critical thinking. My bad.
---
She would really make it work tbh
---
Oh for sure, and that was actually BHVRs original plan but they changed it to first person later on before release. I think it they said it was because it made it more immersive because as killer you would be so focused on what’s in front of you while as a survivor you’d be more worried about your surroundings. Either way I think Chucky should definitely laugh while attacking you or say “Hi! I’m Chucky, wanna play?” &amp; maybe when you come up to a generator he looks directly at you.
---
Why not? If you could elaborate
---
What about a perk that gives a small chance for survivors to injure themselves when repairing a gen? Like in the movies he was setting people up for injuries, make it a 30-40-50% chance to injure the survivor on a failed skillcheck . . . then use it with Overcharge lol.
---
I wish I could get teammates like that once in a while
---
I'm talking about taking hits for other survivors, dumbass. No wonder you think MoM will be useless.
---
Why'd you post this twice? Clear your notification bar btw it looks messy
---
I can't control my teammates, they farm me I shouldn't be punished cause they are fucking idiots.
---
She kinda bad tho
---
Really? I didn't know that. I think I'll try that cause all of my perks after the prestige are garbage.
---
Sometimes killers facecamp when survivors use infinites. 
---
Not everyone teabags and can still get camped. 
---
Many killers get frustrated when they fail to down a survivor after 1 generator or more are done.
---
Am I crazy or did I see this meme like last week?
---
On console, where nurses are not godlike and every game is not against commando swf groups.
---
Plus as I see on Reddit no one fucking reads comments to its full. As I said, I know on PC people DC against nurses a lot. READ WHAT PEOPLE FUCKING WRITE, NOT CHERRY PICK ONE SENTENCE AND IGNORE THE REST.
---
Our minds sometimes fucks with us so bad. I mean, it also made sense because phonetically it sounds similar.
---
Man this sub delivers on shitposts. This is top tier.
---
Well that's just the killer being a jerk. I'll just leave them alone if I can't get them in a loop
---
Oh I phrased that badly, I meant the free ps plus month, that brought in a lot more people whom didnt know of the game.
---
That's the excuse people use to make it sound less creepy
---
I made it earlier today, so unless this joke has been made before I'm not sure lol
---
That’d be a really cool perk to have, could definitely make gameplay more interesting for both survivors and killers. I’m just imagining a No Mither player failing a skill check and downing themselves at a generator lmao.
---
End Game =/= End Game Collapse....
---
It makes me sad, Object has been in my main build for ages. :(
---
While in some people's opinions it might be, a lot of stuff the subreddit says is just blatantly false.
---
I'm sorry this happened to you, but thanks for the laugh.
---
I imagine it would be really soon after the double bloodpoints end. So like...in about 15 - 16 ish hours?
---
In a way I almost think it encourages someone to wait in the basement till second stage since its faster to get there. Better than a camping bubba with it.
---
Funniest thing you could hope for, put a guy on the hook and someone insta-downs.
---
As a killer main dummies who do this are my fave. I just toss em right back on the hook and take the free hook progression and than check the nearest hiding spots
---
What time does this end?
---
Ghostface- I WILL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH!
---
Freddy Krueger- it’s prime time bitch.
---
Random Survivor yelling at Michael- SAY SOMETHING 
---
Michael Myers- Breathing
---
Leatherface- Typical Leatherface sounds.
---
My time skip is unbeatable.

Anyone know what time he’s supposed to come out?

---

---
Repair
---
“Doctor: annoying as fuck”
---
I feel that hahaha. I have around 60 hours in the game and I still think he’s so annoying
---
You are aware that there's two separate teams that handle that kind of stuff right?
---
I think they just failed to get the license for a specific survivor/map
---
Epitafu
---
And this is exactly what people are saying is camping and getting downvoted for here; survivors getting caught in the vicinity of the hook shortly after someone was hooked.
---
Oh yeah people exaggerate and blow shit way out of proportion. It's bad, but not as bad as people say. Like, it's dumb shit too. I got banned because I was joking with an _irl_ friend of mine and said "ur mum gay" to him. It's shit like that.

No I did not know that. I should research more. But that would make sense. I heard they got the license only from the mask maker of scream. So a set from the movie wouldn't be included.
---
I think I'm more excited for new freddy anyway
---
3 stakes is enough to surpass brutal strength. If your play style doesn’t net you stacks just don’t respect the first few pallets of the game. Plus you can use enduring to eat pallets without losing anything.
---
It sucks having to use No Mither while I play as David. I’m trying to get the Adept achievement with him right now and this perk is just straight annoying. I almost made it out alive against the Cannibal but completely forget about my injured status and got knocked at the exit because I was going to use the hit to launch me forward.. a sad moment. Absolutely traumatized. &lt;\3
---
Regular show
---
Soulmate?
---
Whichever survivor uses the less annoying perks. Ash players never get a free escape from me as a result.
---
Thats a different post though, re read OPS post
---
Aye, nearly all well-off game companies have separate teams for QA/bug testing, artwork, design, and programming. This also means that they have a separate team doing skins, so don't complain if new things are added to the store while bugs ain't being fixed ;)
---
I know it’s not like that anymore but when the game first came out Noed didn’t rely on totems so it rewarded bad players No one survivors do the main objective they get punished for doing one thing that they were supposed to do
---
Take a screenshot of each survivor in the lobby and then compare them
---
Im liking these doge-posts, new subreddit theme incoming :D
---
The horror
---
Maybe Stefano as a killer with his ability being his camera being able to either slow down an area in front of a survivor or blinding them like they do with a flashlight
---
Probs level 25-30
---
Quick question, so are ALL the movies canon to the tv series or only the first one?
---
thanks for the input
---
Damn, this is really good and accurate for someone who played for 3 days!
---
Ghostface was such a missed opportunity, I know they only got the costume rights but his voice is just so smooth.
---
Are you are using pinky finger
---
Step 1: Get Samination to do the voice lines. 
---
Step 2: ...
---
Step 3: Profit.
---
Yeah, you know, now that you mention it, SAW is getting another installment too, isn't it? I guess I've sort of been thinking of that as a dead franchise but apparently not.
---
I wouldn't have even thought of Scream having a TV series but that's cool as hell.
---
Link if you achieve it
---
I had a couple that waited almost the whole endgame timer and didnt let me get a hit so thats cool
---
I can see his weapon is a fish but what would his bell be?

None of them. They’ll all die.
---
Are those guns in Pokémon? 😂

Survivors can still do things before a hook as well. Not to mention struggling survivors get up to a maximum of 900 bloodpoints but on average 850. That’s 77% of what the killer got. A survivor who gets found immediately at the start of a match without doing anything and then hooked probably faced one of the killers who can hide their heartbeat but other than that it’s on them. Facecamping killers are almost always low ranked because that’s the only way they can get kills or want to be a dick. If you’re higher ranked and you still die immediately without doing anything that’s on you. Cleansing a totem is 600 bloodpoints. You get points for being chased as well. Searching a chest a max of 250 bp. You can’t outrun or loop a killer again that means you’re not a good enough player. A killer gets 600 points just from downing someone. A survivor gets 1000 from a pallet stun. I don’t know the rate of bp gain for chased for survivors but killers get 1 bp per 10 seconds which isn’t that much. Killer face camps that sucks for the survivor getting facecamped but if they didn’t do jack shit before getting hooked we’ll then I don’t know what to say that means you need to work on hiding, running, or simply had bad luck. On the other hand for a survivor to get sacrificed it takes 120 seconds for all the hook phases to be complete. It takes a generator 80 seconds to be complete without any items or help. That’s 15 bp per second give or take not counting skill checks and co op. That’s an extra 40 seconds to get to other generators. If all survivors fixed a generator while the killer facecamped that’s 2 generators to go and if all 3 worked on a gen they’d get it done in 33.33 seconds and that’s not assuming they have items like toolboxes. A killer facecamping is easily punishable if the other survivors aren’t idiots and decide to do objectives. A survivor who got facecamped without doing anything is either trash or had bad luck being paired with a way better killer or had a shit map placement. But it fucking happens.  The only thing you can do is move on because if the other survivors work on the objectives facecamping killers stay in low ranks and that’s a fact. The only time you see a facecamping killer in high ranks is because someone decided to be a troll and aren’t gonna get any bloodpoints for it because survs in upper ranks are more likely to know what to do so shut up with your killers get 80 billion bloodpoints while survs get very little. I’ve been facecamped many times before as well. Hell I stopped playing for a while and I had gotten rusty. My first game back facecamped immediately because I fucked up my chase. Did I get mad at the killer yeah but I also knew that it was also my fault because I fucked up the chase and didn’t play smart enough.
---
Yeah it goes both ways for sure
---
Yeah but theres a difference between a campy killer and survivors swarming the hook. If you see people going for the save, then just do gens and if they get hit then go for it. If someones actually face camping just gen rush and punish them for it. They're hurting themselves more than anything.
---
Yea it’s crazy how fast they can do gens even crazier how fast they can do it without ruin like you said lol
---
Obviously Baby Dweets.
---
Id also love it if they played "the Grind" from Halloween 2018 during mirror Myers levels
---
Unprovoked? Toxic asshole.
---
You want insight for someone with that many hours? Its very plausible they have always played like this, so fuck them, but what happens a lot is from time to time people reach their limits and snap into an asshole for a while.
---
Tomorrow/today depending on your time zone.

Well is Monday, 11:00 pm now. So for me ghostface is tomorrow. Usually around noon.
---
Yeah, Jigsaw (2017) did pretty well IIRC and it caused them to pick the series back up. Still haven't seen Jigsaw yet myself sadly.
---
Thanks
---
This could mean 2 different things and I'm not sure which one
---
I see this all the time but the infinites are centralized buildings so being hit can give you the boost to make it there which means if you leave the infinite to chase someone elss they run to the infinite lol
---
Pretty much
---
It's annoying for the killer but its a really good play. Not worth assholery. I just block spammers. You dont get messages and you dont ever get games with them again.
---
There’s nothing wrong with committing to the chase tbh but how long it is and how many gens get popped depend on the skill of both players involved and the skill of the others survivors for example some guys I end up against people that have perks like lithe and have buddies with brand new parts and other games I have people who use can’t run around the killer for shit and have teammates who never get gens done
---
It’s still “working with others” which I believe is bannable with detailed evidence. Unless everyone agrees, then it’s cool- or if they can tell you’re farming. 
---
But listening to him and helping him escape is not cool my friend.
---
Why balanced landing over lithe?
---
Agreed whenever I play him I always run monitor and dead rabbit. It’s so fun and terrifying
---
Sexy time with shirtless Myers, i see it as a win
---
Huntress: me woodswoman, me prefer to chop tree for russian logging industry
---
Yet when I play I get potatoes who let me get to stage two on the first hook because theyre all across the map hiding. the jealousy is real
---
They won’t have enough time if they are on another side of them map. I won’t let them get to it. When I play killer none seems to no a lot about infinite’s
---
Dead by dogelight??
---
Flair checks out
---
Indeed
---
I think Meyers is one of the most fun killers to play as😀
---
Big Brain Pig Mains are best porks &lt;3
---
Was he stalk tapping?
---
I like the hair, only reason I picked her as my main was this outfit tbh
---
Discount Markiplier
---
but they're both one kilogram
---
I agree. I had to decide to put that benefit on either Slippery Meat or Boil Over. I think the Boil Over changes will make more of a pair perk, that would pair well with an anti-slug build including Tenacity, Unbreakable, Flip-Flop, or Dstrike
---
Only leather face angrily squeals!

Youre right, its more beneficial to winning the game. but a lot of the time in my experience its done with the intention to trade places, get hooked instead so the person on the hook can escape. I see this more towards after the gates are powered, I totally understand a killer camping their final kill, but at the same time I think its lame to just take the win and let someone rot on the hook who potentially was the only reason the killer was busy enough not to patrol in the first place

---
Uh it says it’s removed for me but if you dm them to me I’ll try my best
---
Yeah I surprised when I tried it out
---
Okay cool. Thanks for helping me out. I'm not gonna do that again cause I'm not trying to get banned 😅 so I appreciate all the help.
---
Devs need to stop with the bandaid fixes. I'm talking about the stupid perks they add and the killers they make to try and fix their issues only for it to fail because those killers and perks will either be trash or OP.
---
Pull an Operation Health like Rainbow Six Siege did and stop with the goddamn content for a bit. Adding more content simply makes it worse.
---
Devs need to greed for their $ though, so more dlc it is!
---
Im new to this game, been playing for the weekend. Some of the killers are super nice and lead me to the hatch or let me escape at the end. Ive played about 50 games and its happened 15 times now. 
---
One game i played against myers and he just would not kill me. Anytime he saw me he would either hit me once or just go right by me. After he killed the others he found me and led me to the hatch, i tried to let him kill me but he wouldnt do it. Not sure why he picked me but ut was pretty cool
---
It’s so you can see if their power is any good.
---
Jeff’s a lil cutie
---
Windows of opportunity is getting changed to that in the next update and distortion needs to be changed so it keeps 12 seconds of no scratch marks but changes amount of tokens by 3/4/5.
---
Oh I LOVE punishing bad survivors who decide to farm their teammate.
---
Damn u cannot engrish rite. Please call me out for the hackerman/spammer/alt account of u/ petra303 (like how you are an alt of these spam accounts) I am. Bless you and your brave soul! Calling out haxors.
---
Will do!
---
Man, ignore it I guess.  I know it’ll still give you a hint and it will be helpful but still down and hook that survivor as well *before* chasing after that Claudette lol. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’ve ratted out teammates in my day {those who’ve spam unhooked me, hid while I do 3 gens so they get hatch, intentionally body block... but killers usually see that type of stuff and make judgement what they want to do. 
---
I’ve had killers message me in game and be like “i know you’re the only one doing gens. Where is the other guy ?!”  But I’ve had survivors message me ratting and I’ll just reply “no one likes a snitch” and keep going about my business haha.
---
Not even close unfortunately. A million gets you to about 36 taking the cheapest route. 400k is probably only gonna get you to 20, but that’s still a great start.
---
Yeah, i'd buy that. That first perk, while very good thematically, would probably be OP.
---
Thats fucked
---
As a clown main, yes, i admit to play him only because of his sexyness
---
This is honestly so sweet to watch
---
There’s no excuse for camping. That’s toxic entitled killer delusion. The same kind of person who runs noed and unrelenting. Baby killer...
---
Yeah, something about how the new mask is personal to the killer. I plan to start checking out the show in a day or two. Definitely glad they're gonna be going back to the classic mask because...
---
[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/scream/images/1/10/GhostfaceTVSERIES.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150701083912](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/scream/images/1/10/GhostfaceTVSERIES.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150701083912) this shit is just silly looking.
---
Cool! And yeah...balance isn't really my forte I'm afraid. Sorry.
---
I'd bet on jeff
---
You mean calm spirit?
---
Tell me about it. They need to lessen the grind, or turn double BP into standard BP
---
Crushing on someone with no formal education = pedophilia?
---
This is relatable
---
Yeah it is when good survivors get away Everytime no matter how good the killer is
---
I feel the splinters are made for low ranks to try out new killers and see if they want to buy him.
---
Number 3 could be interesting no idea on thoughts for it though.
---
Yep, makes them waste time going back for toolboxes to basically offset the time they buy, makes healing harder, and prevents flashlights being a pain in chases. Also stops cheesey multi-person hatches.
---
Only people I feel bad about are those carrying maps. That's like hitting a unicorn.
---
Same here. Gotta love the DPW. I can't wait to p3 Ghostface.
---
Anytime someone does this it takes every single cell in my body not to message them and explain the concept of the hag
---
What?
---
Hi this is earth, have we met?
---
As a new spirit player who has teabaggers in every other game this fills me with joy
---
Hag is the real winner with a 150 meter travel in less than a second. Also you ignored hope for survivors.
---
daddymyers TAKE ME
---
Or continue to click the flashlight to get attention...if you do I will pay attention to you.
---
Ah ok I get it thanks
---
Little known fact: GF can stalk people pretty well in most chases. Stalk a bit, and duck before getting detected. Repeat
---
As a massive evil within fan, I'd absolutely die for this chapter. I can't believe I'd never thought of this before
---
Predator and Sloppy Butcher
---
I guess because MoM = Toxic?
---
So you're telling me there's a chance
---
95 percent of the Survivor population has zero idea what theyre doing in this game. It would be so much more fun if it were the other way around, for the killer and other survivors.
---
As a Michael player, can confirm
---
When u still get those 1k points tho ;)
---
I don't mind sacrificing Blendetts for it
---
That killer let you go.
---
Now be a normal DBD player and taunt him at the end screen.
---
Laughs in v3.0.0
---
Guy randomly gets downvoted into oblivion
---
Well it's also that they do 4 chapters a year and with Ghostface comes the Anniversary update.
---
1500, still annoying
---
1. See No Evil: Killer perk. When an injured survivor is within your terror radius they suffer from the Blindness effect for 15/25/30 seconds. 
---
2. Hear ye’ Hear ye’: Survivor perk. 
---
Your will to work together as a team grants you the ability to shout for nearby survivors. One survivor within a 48/36/20 meter range is revealed to you and you have the ability to call out to them. Survivors within range receive a notification in the direction of the shout. When calling out the killer can only hear the shout if you are within their Terror Radius.
---
I say this as a new-ish killer main, it's very annoying but also perfectly reasonable to do. You've got two health states for a reason.
---
that's every teammate above rank 8 on xbox really
---
It's more a game of cat and mouse than it is hide and seek.
---
I run into walls because of my connection, I will take the free pity though. :(
---
The others are probably sleepy.
---
using iron will with no mither 100 iq hide and seek
---
Ditto, honestly I don't ever begrudge survivors doing annoying shit if it helps the team. They wanted their teammate to get away, I can respect that.
---
Love them! See no evil should probably be increased a bit though. 35/40/45 maybe?
---
Yeah, gotta love people who waste pallets like that, especially early on in the game. It's the same type of people who will get found in a few seconds and create giant deadzones with no pallets because they decided to throw down every single one they pass.
---
Okay so I just looked through on the survivor screens: 
---
It's a pretty close tie between Jeff and Adam - their avatars go into your shard count. Then Ash and Ace pretty much tie for second tallest.
---
SWF if you don't want to lose your mind playing with awful randoms.
---
I clicked the link and every church in my city is now burning.
---
https://yoütu.be/17WZB7 check this mans out he's beast
---
Thank you!
---
And that is why I have explained that the killer is not an asshole for playing "smart" and downing the already wounded survivor. Again: you \*can\* play merciful and go for the other player, BBQnC even encourages that, but you don't get to say that killers are bad or assholes just because they play efficiently. That's the same as being a killer and whining about generators being done too fast.
---
Where’d you learn to spell? Doctor’s supposed to say “Actually a god”.
---
On the steam page for "Left Behind", it is called a paragraph.
---
"* The LEFT BEHIND Paragraph also include 4 new outfits for the Survivors inspired by the Left 4 Dead series*"
---
So it has been used before. I don't know how "official" it is but I doubt Valve would do that themselves.
---
Yes, but that is a design flaw and not the killers fault. Nor does it make killer players who play that way assholes. Blame the game, not the player.
---
Sentinel is Op. Love this idea tho. Props to u duuuude.
---
midchapter
---
It's absolutely consistently doable. Literally any vault or pallet does the trick. Lockers too if you're sharp.
---
That poor Adam hopefully he got out.
---
I wonder if it has anything to do with BHVR buying the publishing rights. No clue at all just a shot in the dark.
---
David's are the best! But I mains Kate and jane cause I'm stupid
---
Be prepared for a lot of that playing solo, also if you not in purple or red ranks you notice it way more. Purple and red ranks for the most part know how to get the person off the hook and leave.
---
he got out either the killer gave him hatch or just brought him to the gate
---
Oh right, yeah.
---
As a Dwight main, I can confirm this is true
---
But he can just show clips and ask us not post his live stream knowing that self promotion is bad thing in the sub. Im calling self promo.
---
I’m doing this every game now
---
Where’s my watch -
---
For every chase you escape from the killer you earn a token to a max of 3tokens. Each token rewards 40/45/50% more blood points in chases for the remainder of the trial
---
Nature’s call -
---
The survivor receives and audible notification when the killer disturbs animals in a range of 12/24/36metres 
---
No more Lockdown -
---
You’re ability to persevere against all gods allows you to break through the entities grasp. You are able to vault a 3rd time through a window every 80/60/40 seconds. Causes exhaustion.
---
this is actually sick I would love a skin like this the head dress is amazing
---
I dont thread with the needle if i dont know where hatch is really and i just downed last surv. I pick him up and go around map where i think the hatch can be. If he doesnt wiggle, i drop him, close it, maybe get the bonus hit from adrenaline and then more points for hook
---
I can't subscribe to the never cleanse strategy.  To me, a no- cleanse team is basically making the plague a perma t3 Myers, except you can't hide from her with that green cloud, constant puking on everything, and the aura adon that shows where you address every time you puke.  
---
It's a bad idea.  
---
Instead you should be racing to clear the pools.  If there's 3 pools left, go puke on a generator, then cleanse in all three pools. 
---
If the plague gets a pool, everyone should try to hide and avoid her until it wears out.  
---
It's a more complicated strategy, but it works far better than the "don't cleanse" bullshit.
---
2x blood points, but 20x searching times
---
Sad!
---
r/redditiwishwasfakebutisnt
---
Swf used to be so relaxed and calm in this game. I’m talking December of 2018. There are still cool swfs, but most of them are just realy altruistic and toxic.
---
Shes a bit flat chested, aint she?
---
Dude Bam I've been wondering what you've been up to
---
Do you mean “Scratched Mirror” Myers. Because I honestly think his stalking makes me feel less scared because he’s just slowing himself down.
---
This is perhaps the scariest perk by far
---
I know right? I'm hoping there's SOME kind of story behind it but it just screams 'Really weird sex thing."
---
That really only gets ya once, if it gets you more times you are bloody blind AND deaf
---
He never suspected a thing
---
For whatever reason I thought there was a new FNAF killer when I read this
---
killer instinct is not too important, I just thought it would be map wide going by the description thanks for clearing it up.  
---
probably right about phobia, though im in FF quite a bit with the CD add on and nurses calling i guess its just not enough time to make it useful.   
---
one more question if they are healing before your terror radius hits them will their healing slow down retroactively when your TR "hits" them?
---
Make sure to run insidious for more sneaky attacc
---
Hey everyone, I have submitted this to the 3 year anniversary cosmetic contest and would really appreciate if anyone could explain to me how the cosmetic will be selected. Does it matter how many upvotes you have on that post in the website? If so, it would be really helpful if anyone can upvote it.
---
Perk 1-  Survivor perk **Nick of Time**- If you are within (24/36/48) meters of a hooked survivor when they are 1 second from going from the 1st to 2nd hook phase or from the 2nd phase to the sacrifice phase, entity progression is paused for 7 seconds.  Nick of Time will go on cooldown for 30 seconds after each use, and does NOT stack with other teammates running Nick of Time.  “I know, I know, I’m the greatest hero who ever lived and yada yada yada, but RUN!”
---
Perk 2- Killer perk **Scavenger**- Any survivor items that are on the ground can be picked up, moved, and dropped as though you were carrying a survivor.  This does not decrease your movement speed, but it does prohibit you from using your secondary ability.  Any item dropped by you or a survivor will have a crow bomb land on it, which will remain on the item until the bomb is activated, you pick the item up again, or for (60/75/90) seconds.  After setting an item down, you will not trigger crows for 5 seconds.  “Such gifts they squander!  Thrown away like garbage!  Well, I waste not.  I have a use for these treasures...”
---
Perk 3-  Killer perk **Kill the Lights**- If you are within (10/14/18) meters of a generator when it is completed, all survivors who were working on the gen when it was completed have their hands caught in the generator and cannot move for 4 seconds, or until they are hit.  Survivors trapped by Kill the Lights can NOT be gen-grabbed.  “Darkness is not my only ally.  Light, too, can blind.”
---
Whoa you remember me?
---
Not sad!
---
Which one are you?
---
Play inmersed with all lights off max volume against hag and you probably will still get scared
---
Who would suspect that
---
Thats sweet.
---
Oh sure! Well, implying that:
---
Other survivors didn’t waste pallets
---
A pallet is near a gen
---
The killer is magically brain dead and loses you mid chase in a locker 
---
Etc, etc.
---
well i mean its not, im a nothing. dont even have 20 consistent watchers. Just putting myself out there for the community is all
---
But oink is cute maan:( dont,be scared of amanda she just gets neae you and roars:(
---
She’s not very curvy even in the in-game model, which is what I used for reference
---
oMg dUdE yOuRe sO tOxIc
---
Nice 360’s. Here’s an upvote
---
Thanks bud!
---
no idea why, I was making a joke at the title.
---
I mean I've done it before so....
---
Those two pallets are good but the one next to the bathroom becomes kind of unsafe if the bathroom generator is done. That particular basement also become much harder to rescue people in if those pallets are gone.
---
I have the exact opposite somehow, I can do fairly well with most killers but generally with bubba i get 2 kills at most and that's *with* scummy camping tactics once the gates are open. It's not that he's bad; he's better than freddy, but i consistently do better with freddy somehow
---
Well, BBQ is a teachable from The Cannibal, so you'd have to level him up to gain access. Adds 100% to all categories.
---
Distressing is a general perk, so anyone can get it. Adds 100% to the Deviousness category.
---
Just make sure you're not the only one they see.
---
Eyesore: While in the killer's terror radius, looking at the killer causes survivors to gradually grow blind.
---
2 to 10 seconds until fully blind, depending on distance to the killer while looking at them. Looking away from the killer would gradually decay the blindess effect. The area of a survivor's Field of View the killer has to be within for the effect to apply would have to be experimented with. This is actually something I would want as a passive ability of a killer character, but might as well throw it in here.
---
Disturbance: Once per chase, using the activate ability key will deafen the killer for 2 to 10 seconds, depending on distance to the killer at the time of actuation.
---
If killers get to blind survivors, then survivors get to deafen killers. Since chase state can be broken and re-acquired multiple times during a single chase, so potentially could this perk. It would obviously be used to try and lose the killer with a stealth juke. Of note: Since Dead Hard exists and BHVR has currently only one "activate ability" keybinding slot, things would have to be adjusted for the introduction of this perk. But they should be anyway - being limited to only 1 "activate ability" key prevents BHVR from releasing any at-will perks similar to Dead Hard (or forces them to give them stupid conditions, like having to crouch to activate Diversion).
---
Wow, mkay. Sorry you woke up in a big pile of dog shit today, and I’m extra sorry that your inane, idiotic ramblings about a random video game at strangers online has been the highlight of your day. 
---
Consider going outside, it’d be beneficial for your health.
---
Oh my lord the amount of hate mail I’ve gotten calling me trash. I just killed your whole team but sure....I’m trash. 
---
It used to give me anxiety, now I just respond telling them that Jesus loves them.
---
Not against LF, if he bumps into the locker he can recover from the stun before you can leave the locker (after the last hit of the tantrum) and just m1 grab you
---
I was happy to see Pig: fun to play against
---
I main killer (still play survivor frequently) and he shoulda just dropped her and moved on, it sucks but sometimes it's necessary.
---
I think it's bugged as shit. (However, during the ptb it seemed they added more scoring events and I pipped easier even in red ranks) hopefully it carries over when the killer drops.
---
Shameless self promo is very sad
---
Normal Myers can be pretty scary too. His small terror radius makes it harder to hear him coming. You could turn your camera and he’ll be right there stalking you. If he’s running M&amp;A, you might not even have a chance to hear him coming before he grabs you.
---
Glad to know there are other Pig players who roar and play like a survivor.
---
I had the same thing. I usually message them back saying, “if I’m trash and I just killed your whole team, then what are you?” They usually just block me or just continually call me trash.
---
1. Chilli Skids - After a spicy meal, your telltale farts forewarn you of future pain and suffering, granting you a temporary speedboost when moving towards a restroom.
---
Yo it just hit me for some reason... trapper mask looks like that cursed video that was all the rage a few years back, called like blank face soup or something?
---
3 feels like a ghostface perk that lets him look like one of the other survivors so you can sneak in easier
---
I mean 10% on EVERY single gen whether it's being worked on or not is huge, especially with no cooldown and ways to hit the obsession multiple times. Like even outside of legion, 20% regression from downing a full health obsession is a lot.
---
Looking at the other gen regression perks, Pop is 25% on 1 gen only after you hook someone, Ruin, Lullaby, and Overcharge are 5%, 6%, and 5% respectively and that's only if the survivor misses the check. 2 of them being hexes and the other needing to be manually applied to the gen by the killer.
---
I think like some survivors i don't want to farm, i just want to earn bp by playing the game and trying to win, not by not playing the game as intended. The only time I'll farm is if during a bloodhunt a game doesn't go well and there's been multiple dc
---
I think the official Dead by Daylight Discord has channels dedicated to finding people to play with. You could try that, or adding people after games that you found to be competent-enough players, letting them know as much and asking them if they would want to queue with you. They will appreciate the compliment, and you don't lose anything if it doesn't work out. Even after the session you could decide you don't want to play with them and remove them.
---
Imagine the rage quits when Ghostface starts teabagging.
---
That's a whole other mess survivors will deal with.
---
Ah shit, I made that look like a fart didn’t I... it’s supposed to be a dust trail lol.
---
Yeah, I got a good laugh off this one...lmao
---
Spine Chill saves lives and pants.
---
sick
---
F for ds
---
Fuck.
---
Haha that little turn she did that's gold
---
This is a very ironic costume I love it lol
---
ok.
---
Deathgarden is $15.
---
I can't wait, I'm going to get him and just tbag with the survivors in my lobby
---
For Huntress you just need to add a crosshair overlay like the big time streamers do.  You'll have no problems getting your hits in then.
---
Amazing work!
---
sure thing. come look. im a nothing. its not a promotion cause neither of us are getting anything.
---
Yeah, 100%. I'm very much so looking forward to doing the same.
---
WAIT WAIT WAIT SHE TALKS@??@?@
---
She’s a memer
---
when I first got the game it took me atleast a month to play against Freddy for the first time
---
Nah Dwight would be seeing David
---
r/unexpecteddundermifflin
---
10/10 best descriptions.
---
yea pretty much
---
It would be a very good way to counter perks like object of obsession (an active counter unlike say rancor), and also gives the obsession reason to play stealthy to benefit the team. I would definitely add more penalty to the perk and also a difference in percentage between the tiers. Which could even be 6%, 8% and 10%. But overall it’s still rather balanced.
---
like. ok in a very literal sense, im saying come look at only me play. but the reality of it is, neither of us are getting ANYTHING from you watching. i like to entertain, ive done it before with very positive results, people talking and having fun, etc. if you think otherwise, just dont watch. 
---
OR
---
put yourself out there and be open to criticism, cause id watch.
---
How dare you not sexualize these horrendous killers!
---
Sorry man I’m not that good at history
---
I typically only bother calling out campers when we have proper communication through swf because of killers who use excuses like this. The person on the hook lets everyone else know that they're being camped and then we all just do gens and maybe send 1 person to the hook if it looks possible to make the save. Then you have nothing but gens being done and the killer sitting there waiting on nobody to show up and they'll *still* say that they saw someone near the hook or something.
---
The point to the post is definitely very true in many cases though.
---
Looks great! But, maybe the mask should be partially torn?
---
2pm sounds pretty late...
---
Plague released at 12 why would ghost be estimated at 2pm?
---
Thank you very much, and I am too!
---
Whose to say they didnt enjoy that game. You dont know. Stop crying on reddit about your problems.
---
F 
---
/hug
---
F
---
otherwise, put yourself out there and let everyone know, cause id come watch.
---
Alright I’m just here to tell you whispers can go off while someone is still hooked.
---
No. But survivors will complain anyways. Just do what you want. In the end it’s a strategy, and they can’t do nothing big about it.
---
So it seems in this situation there was 2 survivors 1 on the hook,I would say yes...you were expecting someone to come and unhook and those doubts were confirmed with he whispers,as a doc main I do the exact same thing and I consider it camping of sorts,but it's not hard camping
---
It's more like a ring around the Rosie, and the Rosie is pallets
---
Nope
---
I mean if you enjoy getting shit on for one kill then by all means take your de pip and move on
---
When I first played this game on a free weekend on Xbox, I played immersed cuz I didn’t realize how to actually play the game, but fighting this one hag was one of the scariest moments I’ve ever had in gaming, and I have crazy nostalgia for that moment
---
Awwww, I'd hug you
---
I think is called proxy camping.  And yeah is a thing.  I main surv and often find this but is a valid way to play the game.
---
As a Killer main this kinda play style makes me salty, but I try to stay positive in the post game saying stuff like "nice teamwork" or "that MoM came in clutch" I really get salty when people act like it was an easy game when most of them were DoH, but even then I'm like "yeah I'm trying to work on playing this killer"
---
If you add a comma in there somewhere, life becomes more awesome!
---
These have potential; how did you create these? I’m most certainly intrigued.
---
Your retard mode just skyrocketed.
---
to be honest its fun to find immersed survivors with a full load out of perks like whispers, stridor etc and hiding from the killer with iron will and calm spirit. I think looping is whats really boring and detracts from any amount of horror elements this game had
---
Holy fuck you trying to wiggle free in the beginning killed me. You’ve got some fast ass fingers
---
I don’t know if you would or wouldn’t DC if you where playing with Random’s but I have to congratulate you on not being selfish. 
---
It’s always nice to see that Survivor that will struggle on the hook for there teammates despite that you where in a Swf. Good job I hope your next game goes well.
---
Putting images on templates, and combining them to make them look right. From an app called PicsArt
---
I would say if you are going for a stealth build then i would replace decisive strike with either MOM or lightweight. MOM so that you can have an extra hit if you were to get caught. Lightweight, so if you have to run less time that your scratch marks are visible to the killer.

But you dont have to self promo on this sub(know people dont like it) whats even weirder is that there are more accepted ways to do this type of promotion in this sub and you choose not to do that. Also the fact you said this wasnt self promo when it clearly is, just be honest my guy. TBH i would have probably came if you were honest about this being self promo and not some ploy.
---
Thanks.
---
Np
---
Yeah from what I've seen it is going to be 2PM EST.
---
Two days ago, they were.
---
or just using your eyes since the nurse's breathing is loud as hell
---
More like Hide and Sneak...
---
I like how you claim to not downvote comments because you don't agree with them, but on a deleted post on the dbh sub where only the people who have commented on it can see and interact with it you downvote all comments that disagree with you.  
---
Or how else would you explain them being downvoted only as soon as you come online and repost the ghostface pic here.
---
Fairly new, what does tombstone do?
---
I tend to avoid playing with more than 1 random as it can be frustrating but i never dc because i care to much about the blood points especially during bloodhunt lol
---
How long does that take?
---
Either way, I wouldn't worry about it. You could be across the map and they'd still call you a camper, or, the best one I've heard, is when they say you're tunneling more than one person *AT THE SAME TIME*......smh
---
Being unable to be happy unless you're the victor is such an empty existence honestly
---
There's something about playing a Leatherface that just causes every survivor's IQ to drop to 5, mine included.
---
Thanks for all the responses i thought i was being unsportsmanlike
---
Or something to do with seeing
---
I’m strictly a solo player lul. But it’s just nice seeing or hearing people not DC when getting camped so they can help everyone escape, pip or even safety pip.
---
Rip your teammate
---
1) Scatter - starting a sprint creates three trails of scratch marks radiating out in different directions for 3/4/5 seconds. 60 second cooldown
---
15 USD at the moment
---
4) Hex: Entities Trap - Your hex totem is unbreakable at the start of the match for 30s/40s/50s. Once the timer is up, your hex totem is swapped for a dull totem that's farther than 40m from the hex totems original location.
---
It took me two years.
---
Because he wasn’t out yet.
---
Here's an idea.  I'd like a survival probabilities calculator.  The idea is that you'd gather data on what killer, survivor perks, etc. And numbers of gens done, survivors remaining, yew specific map, etc. Then you calculate the odds under each condition of a survivor surviving.  
---
You might need to build a program that gathers the data during games or streams.  
---
I want to know what my chances of survival are when 4 gens are done with 2 survivors left playing against a Billy in Lerys memorial.  
---
Obviously you wouldn't necessarily be able to input killer perks or skill levels, but it would give a database for a more accurate killer tier list not dependent on opinion
---
It took me 200+ Hours for platinum, 350+ for 100%
---
Ace! You're a good man. Thank you
---
Well Congratulations!
---
Whispers is triggered by hooked survivors as well
---
Yea i actually died earlier to a cannable because i went back to get our random of the ground while he chased my 2 friends out the door ended up caught for it but i figured at least i was the only 1
---
Listen people cant complain if the killer proxy camps because they know someone's there. What killer leaves so they can get the free rescue.
---
Really cool, but I don't think it fits with who The Plague is.
---
*Unless you have borrowed time and maybe we'll make it
---
I'll definitely use lightweight once it's tier 3
---
But... It's NOT Scream. The license is the Fun World mask. This Ghost Face has no relation to the movies.
---
I was with some newer ppl at rank 19 who were talkong about using borrowed time and i had to explain dont do that it wont matter against leatherface
---
https://youtu.be/bRultdUD-oc
---
What happens at the exit gate at the end
---
Too much fun to use ;)
---
Also, that series mask looks SO STUPID.
---
Glad it's not a Scream chapter or we might get that mask.
---
Grow the fuck up. Stop stalking my profile. (And you call me petty lmfao. Grow the fuck up)
---
I can’t last 5 seconds against a Billy. No matter how much I try to avoid the god damn chainsaw, I always get hit. Always. I don’t even attempt to 360 his chainsaw attack anymore. Always a failure. 
---

Gay being used in a derogatory term isn't allowed, a lot of official servers are like that. If it was allowed, they'd be at risk of losing communication with Discord employees and such.
---
Wow that’s karma lol
---
oh my /;)
---
To be fair, they did state with that chapter release 80% of them would be available. I didn't see anything about that number staying for the future.
---
IK IK should of atleast tried, he was on last hook tho and far
---
But how did it end though? :(
---
YOU LITERALLY WENT BACK 1 YEAR ON MY PROFILE and tried to use my old posts against me, c'mon dude, stop stalking and grow a pair.
---
Yeah its missing the part where he eats their ass.
---
Source?
---
Not tryin to be rude just wondering where you got the info
---
Guess you'll never know ;)
---
:D
---
You tease! You!
---
possibly? i get claudettes that hide in the corner the whole game eith urban evasion
---
I don’t actually. Everything else you’ve suggested seems pretty fair and balanced, not to mention fun. You actually did a really good job on this!
---
I mean honestly, its the truth.
---
Gonna block you now. Bye, dumbass
---
Probably. Lol
---
Yes it’s ridiculous. But I surely have plenty of odd stamps, ropes, and key add-ons that are worthless.
---
Alright I'll try, sorry on mobile so if formatting sucks forgive me.
---
1. Conditioned Stamina - you run at 110% movement speed though you are peminently in exhausted status and sratch marks for remain 6/5/4 seconds longer. 
---
2. Light bender - Start with 4 tokens when withing 8/16/24 meters of a generator your aura will not be revealed if it otherwise would be
---
3. Deceit - After spending 16/14/10 seconds in a chase activate secondary trigger to stop making scatch marks and send a false sting of scratch marks in the oposite direction from where your camera is focused for 2/3/4 seconds
---
4. Improvisation - You work the please the entity no matter what. Once per trial you may call on the entity to summon a hook to your location to instantly hook a downed survivor. The force of the entity changing the trial will stun all survivors in 10 meters for 1/2/3 second. Damage to the survivors will break the stun. 
---
Obviously saw 1 and 3 as survivor perks though think 2 could be either and 4 would be a fun decisive strike style perk for a killer.
---
Oof Kobe with Adrenaline, I feel for that Huntress.
---
This is incredible!! I love it
---
Congrats!
---
Haha maybe that is his traumatic back story. Dude thought it was just a regular bathroom stall. Little did he know...
---
youre getting really hung up on the word promotion. this isnt worth it, debating why im inviting people to come watch and critique me. just dont watch.
---
Ugh don’t remind me. It’s ridiculous how they nerfed it down. I’ve seen people use BPS on day one, and then nothing. Every 5 matches someone would use one BPS, the rest was cakes and letters. 
---
Using a BPS only to get tunneled or chainsaw’d and end the match with 6k bloodpoints. Amazing.
---

Every 3rd or 4th game as her. Oddly enough, I've been disconnected several times when the Huntress has picked me up, only her specifically.
---
When you break the totem and the killer dont try to hit easy wait down 😂
---
They could also be trying out some core mechanic changes, possibly even new objectives or such, but current perks/add-ons/etc break them
---
I always see posts about toxic survivors when a good 40% of the games I’ve been in I was facecamped

Whoever is the last one alive, I don't discriminate, an I don't pick favorites.
---
Haven't you seen almost any horror movie? The last alive always survives!
---
I have 800 hours in this game and most of these are still accurate, specially the Myers one. Hang in there
---
yo holy shit is that the legend himself flame kitty? I have only heard myths of your existence but I never thought I would run into you
---
I can't really think of anything more humiliating than getting downed by a haunted grounds totem someone else cleansed.
---
If the killer only got 1k, why are you upset?
---
Ty I'm entering it into the cosmetic contest I'm so excited!
---
also, name a way for me to invite the community to watch and critique me that wouldnt get you angry like this. i genuinely want to know.
---
you havent even looked. im literally a nothing, i do this for fun. i was honest from the beginning. youre very hung up on the word promotion. its not a ploy, its me saying hey, ive done this before come HYPER critique me. 
---
help me as a killer, or tell me how i can be not toxic. its very simple, youve made it something that this is not.
---
Until tomorrow when it becomes as strong as Deja Vu and Vigil
---
I do jumping jacks to signal “Hey he’s gone so hurry and get me tf off this hook!” I notice other survivors do the same. There’s no rule. Either way, there should be some sort of effort to at least run and see if it’s safe to unhook.
---
My vision isn’t that good ;(
---
Followed by bickering and fighting in the comments. Take my upvote good person.
---
Seriously?
---
Maybe instead of throwing a trident he could throw bolas to sort of cripple survivor movement
---
I just have to say that devotion 2 with so little levels in killer kinda hurts me but as a survivor main I guess I can understand
---
Won’t be counting unhooks.  It’ll be near impossible to get 3 protection hits in a game.  It’s going to be trash.
---
Haha yeah!
---
Yeah. And definitely felt like killers were A LOT more sweaty and campy during this Bloodhunt
---
I also started doing this, I dunno just the friendly interactions are such a dang relief.
---
Do you ever actually take THREE protection hits for survivors?  I HIGHLY doubt it.  It’s objectively going to be useless.
---
Sometimes i die but i save 1 person i‘ m not made but when i die save not 1 person surviver than i rage
---
oh woops I meant to type ears but my big brain typed eyes
---
You sure want attention :)
---
Idk if it’s in his animation or what, but I feel like Bubba has crazy chase speed. I hate chases with him on non-corn maps.
---
The 1k upvote has come
---
Fuck you - no one's fighting except you.
---
You post a video saying you want critiques and in the title self promote not the post title the video title on twitch or youtube. And you did this 5 months ago and it was removed and received rhe same. You want help as a killer or survivor play more and stop self promoting and maybe you'll get better.
---
Evil Within vibes and I love it. Her movement mimicked that of a puppet/mannequin. I can see this working
---
Yeah it actually feels embarrassing going against SWF but I want them to have fun so I try my hardest and get shamed haha but yeah getting a BP boost would make it feel less shitty
---
Holy shit my plan worked!
---
Story of balanced landing and sprint burst in one build
---
I lucked out and managed to get a farmer to get my David adept. I loathe No Mither so much, I refuse to unlock it as a teachable. My little permanent bloodweb perk.
---
Removed - Shaming other players
---
We're not the developers. We cannot help you.
---
That’s very true 😂
---
Is that bad? only been playing for a weak and a bit
---
It's perfect.
---
having to play immersed and basically do nothing half the match isn't exactly a good counter to it.
---
If a perk like this were to be a thing I would say it'd be better if it was everytime the obsession was downed or something at least, 10% per hit on ALL gens is a lot, it may not be individually but it does add up, especially if you combine it with any other gen disruption perks.
---
everyone says Pig is meh but she's the only killer i consistently get 4K with and Plague gets me consistent rage quits
---
The theory is 2pm due to that being when the double bloodpoint event ends.
---
Dance with me for Kate is a very powerful perk with lithe
---
Hopefully, after the clown release fiasco they promised simultaneous releases on all platforms, and they've been pretty consistent so far.
---
Yes, really. They apply to the same situation - when each party largely fails at their grander objective. In survivors case with the old DS, it was failing at not getting caught. That logic was used all the time. For killers, in Noed's case, it's failure at map pressure and preventing generators from getting done. It's not a matter of opinion, it's demonstrable fact.
---
Well, the nice thing is that so long as you max your bp for the round, you aren't "wasting" your bps since they work additively from the base BP you earn.  
---
Aka one BPS will give you 32k BP as maxed killer regardless of whether anyone else uses BPS
---
No worries. Thanks :)
---
I've managed to unlock every teachable perk I wanted, have over 50 of some things on my level 50 Doctor, which was level 1 two days ago, and fell in love with playing him!
---
I regularly earn over 100k per match, so I'm sure I've earned a shit ton of BPs...lol
---
Good times.
---
Let’s hope, I’m on Xbox and trying to post a video about my first impressions with him launch day.
---
Events are usualy 1.5x BP or have their own BP events (Special hooks and gens) so it's great that GF may be releasing tomorrow.
---
I can, cleansing Haunted Ground and then watching two of your teammates go down.
---
Oof that happened to me a lot to, i just lowered the graphics in the settings. Another problem with ping people usually have is with the costume effects, so you can disable those in the settings and the ping should fix itself.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Well it is the 3rd year anniversary event, they probably want to do something special and need the longer setup time.
---
Yeah its bad, because whenever you startv sprinting you use sprint burst, and when you have used sprint burst you cant use balanced landing within the next 40-60 seconds, which is  very bad
---
This was painful to watch.
---
For a movie that’s been out for twenty three years.
---
Don’t make fun of her smoker breath
---
Yeah its great when they dont know about it, but there are games where all 4 do and all chases last about 4 minutes or longer.
---
BHVR just tweeted [this](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1140627048840519680) today,
---
so it's a good bet.
---
Except that it will still be reliable and more fun to use
---
tbh yes as pig i will hide somewhere crouched and watch the person on the hook die. that's only if my map control is shit though. otherwise i'll go ballistic across the map. i only become an asshole when im close to losing as pig.
---
Now that was epic, take my upvote.
---
Can relate but there are good claudettes
---
Why I'm rarely nice to survivors, because they will usually be scumbags to you if they're playing with their friends.
---
I solo survive and get ignored by these little shits.
---
And bullied when I play killer.
---
I even farmed a few times during the most recent double BP event, slugging them without hooking on their final hooks multiple times, not destroying them when I could, and they still fail to realise this and insult after game.
---
No point being nice. Just play to complete objective which is to kill.
---
f
---
Good luck!
---
what a bug
---
Crawling is OP pls nerf
---
Thanks man :)
---
Great. There's a minute of my life I can never get back.
---
Now the **Fortnite** in your name makes sense.
---
I hear them say that just about every post game chat, usually in all caps like this "**NICEOUTFITLEGIONNICEOUTFITLEGIONNICEOUTFITLEGIONNICEOUTFITLEGIONNICEOUTFITLEGION"** then they leave a comment on my profile further saying how im a niceoutfitlegion.
---
You probably aren't aware but the killer is using a meme build called Burger King Myers where they run Tombstone (makes you slower) and Vanity Mirror (also makes you slow), then they stay in tier 1. They have something like 87% move speed compared to survivors and literally can not catch them. It's a joke. Any killer besides Nurse could easily catch up in a loop like this without a pallet, and she could just blink through the barriers anyway.
---
32k is like 5 items tho
---
I do agree with it being changed to downed, theoretically tho it would make it a 3 time use perk if the survivors don’t all run DS and hit them or if you don’t run that new perk whatever it’s called to make the obsession change. If that was the case it’d need a buff to make the generators regress more or make it so they can’t be worked on too otherwise it’s a useless perk for 10% regression. So you can’t have it both ways. Also being forced to play immersed or active has been around for a while in the game, NOED, rancor, hex haunted grounds, make your choice, all force you to need to play a bit more immersed, tier 3 Myers, pig, wraith, they all require more immersed style of gameplay from a survivor.
---
EXACTLY
---
Wait so you’re telling me you don’t want to have a challenge? You don’t want to have to get better at the game to beat the swf?

---
Good job! Now do it for all the other perks.
---
&gt;I'll take on a SFW as killer, I just wanna have fun, but I know I'll be getting less points generally since they can relay my position and information to one another.
---
Reading is fun my dude
---
Yeah it's great! I love going through neighborhoods just going "Hey you! Nice outfit" they get really happy c:
---
In these situations I always ask myself. Did they save me once before? Did they blow up some generators while we were working together? The answer is usually no and yes respectfully, so I always leave feeling good about it.
---
I just think since it's a bigger challenge at the same rank (4 rank 10 solo survivors are less of a challenge then 4 SWF rank 10s) it should have some sort of multiplier
---
nothing crazy huge like "100% boost!) but like if there're 4 SWF a 20% boost to final score wouldn't hurt at all
---
Spirit is the only one that scares me, her terror sounds are just quiet and then her mind games make me panic the fuck out
---
Im sure they do buddy :)
---
I did read it, you just want more points handed to you because the games a challenge now. I enjoy playing the swf it makes you get better at the game. Understanding is fun my dude
---
To be honest whenever a killer was sympathetic, the developers were straight on the point and revealed in their backstory their suffering. Why should they have hidden it on this particular character. Also I gave you evidence for multiple time theory. Ghostface has a different lore from the Ghostface in movies, but Amanda's lore fits 100%.
---
and ebony
---
They would have gen rushed you again. :)
---
You Ash mains are weird :P
---
I wonder what those rewards are
---
Congratulations. 
---
I've got the plat but I still need to get some of the DLC trophies like 1000 hatchets thrown with Huntress and unhooking myself a bunch. ;_;
---
urban evasion is your friend
---
&gt;Understanding is fun my dude
---
Then you obviously can't do either?
---
I'll play against SWF, but I'm tired of being dodged by killers when playing SWF.  There's no harm in a small 20% boost to final score for a 4-man SWF
---
The thing is body blocking is fucking infuriating, but its legal so it makes you shitty with no outlet haha XD they just need to practice being compassionate.
---
There was nothing special in the leaks and data mines though :/ not even event cosmetics or an objective.
---
The event is likely just presents in the web and those new effects on the firecrackers that were in the ptb. I hope i'm wrong though.
---
\*Micheal's breathing intensifies\*
---
My in game time is 14h or something like that and I encountered nearly everyone only the clown, plague and phasewalker need to appear. Btw is it a known bug that you can get stucked in/at a tree? Happened to me twice now
---
When you're at school.
---
That's why you **LEAVE** when you can. SMH
---
Myers (especially when he plays mirror scratch) is actually the only killer that manages to repeatedly scare the living shit out of me.
---
Just camp and tunnel, you're fine because people here support that. You only need deal with salt from players in game.
---
Congrats, I know what a struggle it can be. I’m close to it but I just need the huntress trophies and a few more dlc survivor trophies.
---
That’s probably the best and most honest way to put it
---
Not going to lie, my favorite have build is an all hex build and I've had the pleasure of watching a survivor just look at a lit totem before leaving it alone.
---
I've noticed only certain neighbourhoods appreciate the comment, others dont think im talking to them for some reason, oh well.
---
Yes their is, then no harm in giving solo survivors a 10% boost?
---
well, you can just keep looping. He can get bloodlust, but aslong as you know your surroundings, and know how to loop all the different loops, it's pretty hard for him to catch up. (unless he uses Spirit fury+Enduring)
---
or if he uses spirit fury+enduring
---
Yeah. Probably
---
This is the most appropriate comment *ever*.
---
Give the solo players an incentive for playing solo
---
I actually tried that out before coloring and it didn't look right
---
oh damn really, never realised, just started using Nea. Whats your best build?
---
Ah so you're one of those that screw over your team because you don't know how to play.
---
Because Nurse isn’t fun to play nor is she fun to play against, the ranked system means nothing in this game so there’s not really much reason to try hard to rank up. Staring at the ground for 90% of the match isn’t fun and chases with her feel pretty boring as they generally are very short lived, either you kill the survivor pretty much immediately or your stun makes you lose track of them and have to move on which is just frustrating. On the flip side nailing a chainsaw with Hillbilly, an axe with huntress or playing mind games as Spirit are fun, hell even trapping someone with Trapper gives most people a little giggle I think. 
---
TLDR:Nurse is top tier but there’s nothing satisfying about playing her and rank means nothing in this game.
---
They don’t get too many points for that too, now that’s respect.
---
I'm just saying the BPS doesn't lose any value
---
Here is a bit of Lore I came up with for this skin.  
---
As Adiris wandered the fog, she found herself in the greatest war known to man, World War 1. She prayed to the gods for an answer. Then, the solution came to her. They must be purged, as they are wicked. She was known as The Woman in The Fog to the armies. They thought of her as a myth, they were wrong. Using the weapons and dog tags of those she killed, she formed a new crown. One of trophy and intimidation. She used the armies own gas agaisnt them. She placed the can of mustard gas into her weapon ( The Devine Lantern ) and created a new censor. The Woman in the Fog disappeared after the war, and is now a folktale for parents to get their children to behave, but she is no folktale, she is, The Plague.
---
Damn you Clown!
---
Big money, big money, aaaaaand **STOP**
---
Anyone? *Anyone??*
---
Shit..... I'm old apparently.
---
I play trapper so I leave the shack, but trap it so when they waltz in they are easy to grab and hook
---
Shirtless Myers.
---
Just kidding, but could you imagine the reaction?
---
Liver alone....
---
Just equip ds
---
she quick she quiet then she roar and i...i never see it coming. /: &lt;\3
---
[Distant mori sounds]
---
Sure, not against that.  They don't need it since the majority of the playerbase plays solo and do really well but if you're such a snowflake that you need that 10% boost to play the strong aspect of the game, I'll give it to you &lt;3
---
If i know its a swf, i pop on a mori to even things out.
---
What dies that mean? I thought tve red perks were removed.
---
I would travel to the US just to participate
---
Really throwing insults because someone has a differing opinion than you? 😂😂
---
Use it with botany knowledge or don't use it at all
---
I dunno about that. Jigsaw Piece + Doctor + 3-genning = a bad time.
---
I wonder what the reward is :0
---
groovy yvoorg
---
Yep, that too. I felt it.
---
I actually agree with you. There are always pallet around, and if you don't like it when the other survs waste pallets, just use OOO. You can just loop them the ENTIRE game. There are enough loops in every map to loop a killer the entire game, if you are good enough. Use adrenaline, dead hard, ds and OOO to get the optimal looping build. (Or atleast, that's what I use.)
---
And NOED to insure they go down and also (But not highly recommending) Blood Warden to hold off once the Exit Gates are actually open.
---
Only you play as killer. I’m absolutely garbage as killer, but a decent survivor.
---
Getting downed by a haunted grounds totem YOU cleansed
---
That container doesn't have a bottom piece
---
To provide some constructive criticism, this story is well written, and it would make sense she would make a mustard gas censer. After all, her censer is supposed to leave a trail of smoke and a certain scent. However, The Plague is from Ancient Mesopotaimia. She is literally 3,000 years old. It feels unusual to see an ancient Pagan priest wearing a gas mask and a grenade crown. Along with other modern equipment. Feel free to provide feedback or any other information I like hearing ideas.
---
BBQ&amp;C fucks over survivors all the time, don't see the problem with them using OoO.  Lol
---
Some people act like farming is an epidemic or something. Sure, I wouldn't want to do it every match, but it can be fun once in awhile, and even then it's basically getting angry over free points and a pip
---
I'm not bothering with this whole situation again, like I said it was a joke (a very common one) and with a friend. It is ridiculous and that's just the tip of the iceberg with the staff. It's a bunch of little shit like that that just makes it a shitty place.
---
how?_?  It’s literally only going to work when you’re taking 3 protection hits.  Virtually no one is ever able to do that 3x in a game.  It won’t be reliable at all when you can’t get the hits to use it.
---
Survivors should get rewarded for making killers dc and for being camped since we’re asking for stupid stuff that will never happen
---
Every one of these made me laugh
---
It’s a teachable perk. Unlocked at levels 30, 35, and 40.
---
Well thanks man! glad you like it.
---
Also they cursed at me in the chat for trying to secure the hooked kate calling me a tunneler
---
I ran BPS and was going to go easy on the survivors, i.e. 2 hooks each before any kills. All 4 of them rushed my Ruin totem so of course I defended it. I downed one, went back to the totem and downed another. I was picking them up to hook them but they disconnected. On my way back to the first downed survivor, they disconnected too... Sorry for defending a totem in the middle of an open field, but who disconnects during BPS *during 2x bloodpoints?*
---
Those leaks where from months ago, just because there was no event data in them dosent mean theres not going to be one. It's the 3rd anniversary of the game, i severely doubt they're *not* going to do something special.
---
Ah ofcourse. I even have it as a teachable perk...
---
1,850 hours. Love playing him :D
---
BPS is not an invitation to farm. 5 BPS is not an obligation to farm.
---
I literally had to play as the nurse to figure out what she was like because nobody played her at low ranks
---
Infinite hours and still annoying.
---
Atleast give her Adidas clothes...
---
^^^^^^Tripaloski^^^^^^
---
Because technically they are not only wasting their time but my own as well. Life's short I dont have time to waste being facecamped. I understand hooks need guarding sometimes if people are around. I also know some people will get salty and say you camped if people circle a hook but that's not a big deal. It's just when people spawn in hook the first guy they see and camp them. It's mostly useless and I think it's a low hanging fruit playstyle.
---
Good lord... well played but I just know I'd be FUMING if I was the killer lmao
---
And what about the PTB data miners? They found nothing and thats the same build we get later today.
---
Wasn't it 3 protection hits and/or safe unhooks?
---
i agree 100%, i prefer playing risky, but not like a dumbass, but I'll still go for those crazy Borrowed Time saves
---
Survivors aren't toxic, they just have better places to be instead of waiting for the mori to end or the sacrifice to complete.
---
would have sucked more if I have decisive 3 in the end
---
Plenty of killers have fun cosmetics that don’t necessarily reflect their story or time period. The Nurse has a WW2 uniform as well as a Victorian Dress and a 50’s American Housewife outfit. It does no harm for The Plague to get cosmetics like that too.
---
So if you run up and unhook right after the killer hooks, is he supposed to ignore you?
---
Just protection hits now, they changed it.  That’s why it’s going to be an F tier perk.
---
I'm sure there will be more once the Beat Cop outfit releases, though.
---
They said it’ll start the 18th so yes most likely same time.
---
Well she dosent age. And I love to see horror get shot out of it's time zone. I always love an ancient evil in one of the world wars
---
yeah, that would make sense if they got the rights to ghostface but they didn't. they got the rights to the mask and I doubt the people who make the mask cares.
---
No offense, but that's a really bad idea; if half of the community thinks it means DON'T UNHOOK, and half think it does, then flailing basically has a 50% chance of telling everyone the OPPOSITE of what you want. Just stick with the classic definition of "Flailing = DON'T UNHOOK ME" so everyone has a clear definition and you dont have people running up to you and unhooking when the killer is right next to them and visa versa.
---
Oh, okay. Didn't really follow the PTB side of dbd.
---
&gt; Unless they found a way to hide this one?
---
Sure, they probably just didint put anything in the PTB?
---
Every single PTB since the start of the PTB's have been data mined and leaked. They knew if they put the event in the files that it had a good chance of being leaked. So they probably just didint and have a separate dev version to work on.
---
That's fair. I figured you were upset that a teammate was getting camped which, yes, sucks, but if you don't give in to the bait it's still a free win. As the unlucky fucker who usually gets camped first hook despite not teabagging or anything I feel you though
---
Agreed with pretty much everything except deliverance. No need to decrease the broken timer. It's fine as is. I also think no mither should give you 50%-100% extra bloodpoints
---
Wait, what? It’s getting nerfed? How bad will the nerf be?
---
I don’t think it has. It’s just been a “rule” some people on reddit, the forums, or some streamer said. I might do the jumping jacks or I might not do the jumping jacks, either way people come to save me. Like I told the other commenter, with all the new people that join the game, and those that don’t look at the forums, this’ll be hard to become a survivor standard. People also get bored and want to hit the struggle button just because.

---
the fuck is that rank diversity how did you even queue with them
---
I always do shit like this when I can, it's so fun, lol
---
Haha never appeared after first movie and killed himself in video game
---
Don't...do not give me hope.
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
I get upset about killers and survivors who refuse to play properly and go out of their way to farm because I have no need for blood points and I queue up specifically to play Dead By Daylight, not to play Farming Simulator 2019.
---
Your name is PM\_me\_your\_swelling
---
Is that sprint burst with balanced landing?
---
Nothing official, but its the word around thr subreddit.
---
It would also make sense, as that's when the Bloodhunt ends.
---
If you want something non Meta that focuses on getting away and losing chases try: 
---
Stake out (hiding while the killer is checking for you will get stacks and it counters ruin) 
---
Lightweight (scratchmarks are only there for 3 seconds instead of 6)
---
Dead hard (helps you extend chases by getting an extra loop in or making the killer miss)
---
Distortion (blocks nurses/BBQ from seeing you for at least 3 times in a match)
---
Obviously not the strongest setup but I think it would still be pretty strong for a non Meta build.  Could also run were gonna live forever to get stacks off safe unhooks and your stake out would build while hiding and waiting for the killer to leave the hook.
---
This is the best piece of Rin art I think I've seen, good shit!
---
Thank you. I love this build but my friend said it was garbage and “disjointed”. I love it because I won chases and can loop killers with it sometimes, but it all falls apart when I get injured, so I was looking at all the perks and realized Iron Will would be something decent...
---
I hate DS. I used to love it, now it’s so useless. If you get tunneled, chances are, you’ll die anyway. The amount of times killer never picked me up and decided to chase after someone else? Too many times. By the time I get picked up, the timer has ran out. 
---
Borrowed Time? Okay, and? Good against campers. Sure. But if a camper is keen on killing your friend or the camped person, BT won’t save your teammate, it’ll simply prolong the chase and sometimes by not much. BT is still a very powerful Perk, but I feel like it doesn’t help ME as a solo player. 
---
Adrenaline? Yeah right. Escape? What escape? Everyone has been so sweaty during the event. If it procs, cool, but not so much when you’re at full health. I don’t know. So situational too.
---
OZON's SALUTE
---
so glad you guys are worried about the important shit
---
"Eheheh he'll never see us her- OH GOD PLEASE MOVE MOVE DUDE CMON YOU'RE BEING A GENUINE DICK BAG RIGHT NOW, PLEASE!"
---
June 21nd
---
I prefer to take hits for the squad, I usually play the team player kinda guy
---
It's always random, but you can get offers from thr bloodweb to increase the chance to get send to a certain map.
---
Well that's on you being selfish. It's only 4 days of farming and you can't even let other less bloodpoint rich people get their bloodpoints. Everything goes back to normal after 4 days.
---
Nah, meme build. Vanity Mirror + Judith's Tombstone. He can't get to Tier III, and couldn't catch up. He only was so determined likely because I was dead on hook.
---
By counters you just mean it does the exact same thing but slightly better. Its a really weak counter to most of those.
---
I run a similar setup on a different character as I switch around. Except for Stake Out, I’m using Poised.
---
First thought came to mind was Xbox Vs PS4 lol seen to many of those posts recently
---
Would've been icing on the cake, heh. We still got a 4-man escape though, rounded back to team up and save the Kate at the end.
---
I've been playing for 3 weeks, bought Doctor exactly 24 hours. He is annoying to me for whole new reason - I bought because of teachables and wanted to try 'impossible skillchecks' build, so before I acquired shards, I leveled other killers so I get perks I need for that build. 75 bloodwebs later, I still don't have Unnerving presence ever appearing in my bloodweb and overcharge is only tier 2. Fuck I'm so tired.
---
Someone actually told the killer to report me because I didn't go back to save them
---
I was laughing so hard when it happened lmao
---
He just couldn't catch up cause of his build. Some hits though, I'm very surprised they didn't connect with how these hitboxes are.
---
Saw1&gt;every other Saw movie.
---
It's going to require protection hits to stack now instead of the usual M1 hits from killers.
---
Instead of basic attacks being the stacks you get your stacks from safe unhooks or protection hits. Kinda like WGLF
---
Hell yes
---
It’s always fun not to take this game too seriously. Makes it for fun that way
---
Any double pallet loop would be stronger than a single pallet. "God pallet" is the strongest single pallet in the game bar none.
---
hey! im offended, annoying as fuck smh...
---
Utilizing the power no other killer has :)
---
Ghostface did not release yet
---
I’m new, realised in another post that they conflict. Just started using balanced was wondering why it felt so ass. Assumed it was because it was low level. What’s your best perk build?

You have learnt quickly, my young padawan
---
Just slug him so he can watch and learn
---
guessing you are her man?
---
“Lol I’ve never had human interaction in my life”
---
Welcome to the enlightened side of the DBD community. Your mind has realized something that most players fail to see which is that killers and survivors can be equally as toxic.
---
what is your gamertag
---
Harvest Festival Leaflet, Decrepit Clapboard and Realty Key are the offerings. And yeah you just play matches and randomly get selected a map dlc or not.
---
Bruh, I main LF. It’s not a cheap kill, or a cheap escape. 
---
Hatch is a secondary escape option that can only be achieved by being the last alive or last one to escape. 
---
Both you have to achieve something to escape/kill
---
Basement hooks you have to down in the vicinity to get them to the basement.
---
GhostFace doesn't look as cute anyway.
---
And he does not make cute sounds and squeals when he gets hit by pallets
---
2PM EST or 7PM GMT. ;)
---
You want to run adrenaline, a exhaustion perk like balanced landing or dead hard, and the other two are really whatever your playstyle is. Self care is good, but I dont like it as I feel it takes too long. Second chance perks are always good, and so are aura perks. Decisive strike, deliverance, unbreakable, metal of man, bond, aftercare, empathy, borrowed time and kindred are all good picks. Probably missed some good ones. Almost all perks are usable, just not amazing like adrenaline or BT. My build is adrenaline borrowed time dead hard and either unbreakable if I'm in a swf or decisive if I'm solo. It really comes down to what you like though.
---
yeah SG is Singapore.
---
When the killer is attacking their hit box goes away
---
Plauge should be renamed from disgusting to Anorexia
---
Should be at 2PM EST or 7PM GMT. ;)
---
YOU THINK THIS IS A GAAAAAAAAME?!?!? (ya, I prefer fun but some people just thirst for them points, it's the 'tity's fault, brah)
---
Trap the shack
---
Arrrrr that be amazing! Also I can see he's finally captured Spongebob, whom I assume I will be able to play as/dress up Dwight as...
---
That is so cool! Still waiting for a marionette themed killer
---
but I love the Red Forest! Oh does it not work well on consoles?
---
Sounds about right
---
Playing for the survivor when the timer is low. Would be sick.
---
Probably like 1k auric cells or something
---
Have you tried teabagging directly on top of it?
---
Not pictured: The leatherface hiding behind a tree camping you during DBP.
---
Dedicated servers
---
Yeah because survivors need to lose 4 times before they lose the game instead of 3 times.
---
Flashlight + OoO + tbagging so I can get the “get chased” daily done
---
I think survivors need to remember the Hatch isn’t meant to just be an “I win” card regardless of circumstance
---
How the fuck do you enjoy playing vs pig
---
That is truly a sacred feeling
---
as a person who just bought spirit i would LOVE this
---
Absolutely wonderful work, the angle &amp; perspective you have used is incredibly dynamic, I love it.
---
Imagine being a survivor so sweaty and shitty you gotta shit talk Trapper, one of the weakest killers in the game.
---
Can't really do much for them, hard to judge the starting line for that campfire sprint too, usually I don't get close enough to it and the killer will down me and I'll be like nooooooooooooo, I did this for yooooooooooooooooooo!
---
I Enjoy Playing Games :D
---
if i more experienced that the overall survivor team i go easy on them 'cause it's me who is controlling the match. So it's my responsibility.
---
Obviously you don't HAVE TO do that, but that was is right to do. They aren't going to learn much if you just roll over them.
---
kind of them to give such constructive advice and recommendations
---
I have seen ppl say it has issues but on my ps4 I have never had problems
---
Welcome to the grind! It only gets worse and blodhunts are few and far between.
---
Buying all the DLC can be expensive, I got this game free with psplus last year, then in october they had a Halloween sale, where all the dlc was 50% off, i would wait till the next sale as it can get pricey
---
Shut. The. Fuck. Up.
---
On the contrary, I’m typically in the red ranks by season’s end. So get over yourself lol... Most players don’t care about a few forum posts complaining about their wiggling arms while on the hook. I’ve played for almost 2000 hours and haven’t encountered any negatives for doing the jumping jacks lol
---
It's the dress, something about being fancy makes you more lethal.
---
Ahhh this makes me happy.
---
This guy is a teabagger even if the killer is as he puts it “playing for fun”
---
No, it's not just 4 days of farming. People try to farm all year round, even without BPS, and it's annoying AF. While not as common, it's frustrating to say the least.
---
And I don't see how I'm being selfish. I'm just trying to play the game the way it's meant to be played. 
---
When everyone plays normally during double experience, everyone still gets a crap ton of blood points. At least there's a compromise for those who just want to get blood points fast. 
---
I'd say people farming are the selfish ones because they are forcing an unorthodox way of playing without any compromise for the players who just want regular games of Dead By Daylight.
---
Legend tells that his game is still uninstalled
---
The Keeper's name even fits the DbD naming convention and the tone of the games is perfect for DbD's brand of survival horror: there are no few sections in both games where you're forced to hide, run, or die.
---
Leather face to get BBQ, then anyone after that. Then again, I’m just an aspiring rank 9 killer.
---
When r/freefolk starts getting into my DBD.
---
Yeah it’s just like, that’s cool, I’m a bit busy right now. Can I schedule you for a minute from now?
---
Wiggling free from the killer, it’s a very rare thing to happen,
---
Not every player is going to see this silly reddit post, or others like it. Not every player is even going to care about this topic. This isn’t a widely adopted tactic anyway and you can’t expect everyone to know about this. So I suggest you attempt a rescue. It’s all I’m saying.
---
People keep saying killers are camping in bloodhunt but it’s really the survivors fault because they come for the save instantly atleast 1-2 of them and you clearly see them coming before you even hook the guy so why would I leave just for you to unhook the guy, where would I go? I don’t need to pressure gens because you aren’t doing any, atleast don’t make it obvious all of you are coming for the save....
---
Imagine if this perk played like a mini blood warden, when they entered the basement the entity would block it for 10 seconds.
---
But muh basement build
---
He was t-bagging lol
---
Very much so lol
---
Boldness lul
---
Cool one 👍
---
Time watcher doesn’t seem useful. After all you could literally Time your games with a phone. The other two are nice though!
---
I disagree. I think that the pallet under the cow-tree is the best one to loop around
---
Do you not know how keys work or am I missing a joke
---
So I imagine that keep walking when you see a pallet is a big skill of a pro killer right? I can give you thousand of examples of "reward for losing" things in dead by daylight but you will always justify everything except for MoM cause this is the only thing that annoy killers. For example, if we follow that "reward for losing" concept we can say that also bloodlust is in this category. The more a killer is bad the more bloodlust helps him. Or insidious reward you for doing nothing? And Noed rewards you for getting gen rushed? I could go on giving you examples but I know you will justify everything so I just stop.
---
Watch out I'm not complaining about anything. I'm not saying spirit fury, Nord bloodlust, MoM are unfair, I personally use some of these perks, I'm just trying to show that in a game where you need to survive or kill there are just some things that HELP YOU doing what you have to do. MoM helps you surviving like spirit fury helps you catching survivors ecc. This reward for losing thing is just stupid. Anyways if you ask my opinion, like I said before, I'm fine with MoM change and I would be also fine with a Noed change. You guys need to play more both sides of this game and stop complaining and rage only against one of these. 
---
Anyways I know I will get downvoted as hell only because I mentioned some killer things but that's just my opinion. I personally play both sides and the reason why I mentioned killer perks is only because I imagine that the players who agree with the "reward for losing" idea about mom are killers for the most part.
---
Called it haha, I love getting messages like this on xbox my most recent was “your mother should’ve got that abortion that her and your dad were discussing for so long , world would’ve been a better place and they wouldn’t of had to waste so much time on a low life like you” then Xbox sent me a message saying “thanks for your report this has made the community a better place” he got banned lol hope it was permabanned for a message like that
---
Jake Tucker strikes again
---
Or just take unbreakable perk rather than given it for a fifth perk smh
---
"Look who's shittin in the tall grass"
---
Not for me. Idk why so many people were unlucky this event. I only found 1 camper, no over powered addons, not other campers. Maybe some tunneler here and there but our perks made them stop tunneling (Bt, Ds, MoM...)
---
You want more Pigs tunneling RBT survivors? Just increase points for Game Over.
---
RBT kill shouldn't be a thing you want to get as a killer.
---
&gt;But unless the killer sucks, they are going to win no matter what.
---
Right, so the killer can win every match without hitting the weakest person on the other team?
---
Fuck me, if killer was THAT strong I wouldn't even try to lvl them up and gain perks, I should've used my bloodpoints elsewhere
---
Farming outside of the 4 days is selfish because you don't earn much more anyway, it's just ruining the experience for everyone else. But to tell people off for farming during literally a farming event, is just mean. Even more so when said farming event is right after rank reset. So actual low rank survivors are pit against stronger killers and they literally get no blood points if they die really quick, and same for killer, low ranked killers will play against SWF teams that may have been red ranks and are extremely strong, and just get looped into oblivion and gain nothing. So I still stand by it, there's no reason to be mean to people who just want the extra blood points during these 4 days.
---
Yea, that why I gave him that description, I know he is vulnerable to pallet loops but I'm bad and don't know how to pallet loop him correctly yet!
---
I also have the platinum and lack the huntress trophy about hatchets from x meters. How did you do it?
---
Fair and balanced gameplay.
---
She feels different from all the killers, I don't know, her traps are way much unique than any other power
---
This is dope
---
I played against Freddy on my first day. A pretty good Freddy, too. Fml.
---
this post again
---
Well, also, they said in the anniversary livestream release was the 18th.
---
You mean to say that you’re doing a gen and looking behind you, and stalking from behind a corner you see only this face, staring at you...menacingly, mocking you with only its face...and this doesn’t terrify you?
---
At first the hag gains a notification if the trap is destroyed by a flashlight? Maybe you missing something. Also hag got a smaller terrorradius and doesnt have to pick up traps. Also she got 10 traps and is even able to teleport between them.
---
You can stop every loop any time you want. Your traps force survivors to crouch through some areas. And the most important fact. The hag got the best mapcontrol of all killers and thats very powerfull. Hag is very slow right but thats ok cause you dont actually chase with hag. At least not for long. Hag got a very defenciv playstyle. Its not worth to chase a survivor in an area where you got not traps. Always remind that and focus on placing traps. Hag is actually 1 of the most powerfull killers even with her low speed
---
They are legit satisfing as a Saw fan.
---
You could improve it by increasing the shared range. And I can imagine people using it creatively using a shared code.
---
Okay here is a trick how I always remember it. Go to reddit, search for Ghostface release time. BOOM always work for every fucking update.
---
First time it was near the end with one open door and I was behind the tree and „stalked“ the killer and suddenly I couldn’t move. And the Second time I messaged the killer because he was like 5 meters away from and told him to kill me, but he dropped me on the hatch. 
---
Oh and I think its on one of the first maps that got released (watched Livestreams and YouTube videos  after release)
---
With 2 nurses doing this it would be game over
---
God of 360s
---
Survival/Deviousness in general.
---
Survival is almost capped at 5,000 regardless of what you do. I feel the boldness score events that involve interacting with killer powers should all be moved to survival and added to each killer so there's always some way you can work towards 8,000.
---
Deviousness is just so shitty balanced between killers. They need to just look at what a DECENT performance is and balance that as 8k, rather than something like Pig that's expected to do 12 or so ambushes per match.
---
But women weren’t on the frontline, but still a amazing concept
---
It is a widely adopted tactic, hence why every high rank player does it. If you do jumping jacks I'm going to assume you're being camped, if you're not being camped and you're doing jumping jacks you're too shit to be worth saving.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08MWGY1N_ec
---
Is it like this? About 3 days ago this started happening and it's literally almost every game since. Usually I get 3 disconnects. Sometimes 2, sometimes all 4 but usually 3.
---
Okay thank you for the advice I’ll try that.
---
Only if dude. Only if 😢
---
Damn, really wanted a Scream map
---
Well, huntress uses axes, only natural she's hitting trees.
---
See I just got this game on the free weekend and had no idea that's what it meant. I honestly thought it meant it's safe hurry and get me. I'm at rank 11 and people have gotten me with it without flailing
---
can this be the copy pasta for this reddit
---
It is not that I hate you but i wake up and have to skip past 20 of the questions when it is pinted on the front page of reddit.
---
Survivors dont get enough points at all 
---
Normal - good game 14000 - 18000
---
Sometimes more or less.
---
Normal - good killergame 18000 - 30000
---
Without bp plus perks or offerings
---
Lol k
---
The real reason is they don't want to pay the costs, there's very little options when it comes to internet service here and server hosting isn't much better, so the cost is quite high.  
---
So it's just "eh who cares, it's just Australia fuck 'em".
---
Hag
---
If I Remember Correctly, A Lot Of Patience, Luck and Many Many Many Games as the Huntress.   
---
I Used,   
---
Nurses Calling   
---
Bitter Murmur  
---
Hex: Thrill of the hunt   
---
Anything that would give me a chance to see where a survivor is located and attempt to lob a Hatchet over them, sometimes i got lucky and hit them and downed them.  
---
Most of the time though i would be outside of the terror radius while watching them work on gens and/or heal each other and lob a hatchet to them.
---
He will probaly be released 8/9 hours from now. But the game tends to be unplayable for some time right after an update (at least for me)
---
Same here, except within a few days after rank reset. Need them pips.
---
For a beginner these results are very accurate
---
This is lovely! The facial expression, the pose which in a sense is rather 'normal' but becomes distorted because of her limbs. The atmosphere surrounding her. I love this!
---
I’ve been playing this game since it was free on ps4 and the only killers who have scared me is Michael and Hag
---
Oh shut up ya big bitch. Fast vaulting windows annoys you? Toxic and try hard? Just stop.
---
Hitting a survivor out of spirit walk. Grudge is the scoring event. 
---
Survivors, in general, get screwed with bloodpoints, gens honestly need to reward more, like 1 hook save is as much as 1 full gen.
---
A McDonalds reference on a KFC post? Have it your way!
---
Gg
---
What platform y'all playing on. Only saw 2 Bubba's, 0 clowns, several Spirits Hags and Plagues, 1 Mikey, Buncha Billy's, Lotta 3 blink Nurses, fair amount of Pigs and Huntresses, a random Trapper every so often, Wraiths who all want to farm, 4 Docs, only ever saw 2 moris and one didn't get used cause we had 4 BPS going
---
Can’t believe survivors have so much power over a killer. Survivors can bully a killer which is ridiculous to think of
---
That’s an amazing skin, would buy!
---
yeah just don't get caught in the open, Bubba is trash if you force him to m1
---
 you can even check it live on your game, he's supposed to drop after the double bp event is done
---
I didn't downvote you nor did I say that you specifically are also being mean during this event, because I do agree that farming is just not at all fun and it's pretty silly to be doing it outside of a farming event. My only point here is that getting triggered at people farming during a farming event and calling them out is just straight up mean and selfish, not pointing fingers at you, just, in general. If people want to call others out for farming, do it outside of an event that's specifically for farming, and just enjoy free pips during the event if blood points don't matter.
---
*Others survivors*
---
What the f*ck did you just bring upon this cursed land
---
8 hours
---
Not surprising since he's considered trash tier so almost no one would play him
---
I love BJD's, why haven't I thought of this before... A nice little project for the weekend. Thank you for sharing this! I'd love a doll like cosmetic for Rin.
---
 [u/vReddit\_Player\_Bot](https://www.reddit.com/u/vReddit_Player_Bot/)
---
i don't know if you're used to play solo survivor but it's way easier for me to play killer than having a good experience as a solo survivor. Even if i manage to pip with 3 potatoes on my team that is stupidly annoying.
---
Im just going off of comments from other posts, people kept  asking so i just wanted to state when its believed  to be as  i didnt want my feed filled with dozens of "When ghostfsce?" They never give specific  times  till the day itself usually  so im just basing it on posts and the bloodhunt  ending as theres no offerings  n items in the new "event"
---
Aww damn, wishful thinking on my behalf haha
---
As dumb as an answer as it may sound like it is, the best Killer for *any* rank is going to be the one you enjoy playing. If you were really a rank 1 Killer, I don't really see why you need to ask this question. You know what Killers are good in meta, and you know which ones you enjoy. Pick whichever one you want to play as based on those two things, PC isn't really that different than PS4.
---
5 blink nurse with ruin, bbq, devour hope and noed and 2 of your teammates dc as soon as they go down :')
---
I'm glad to hear :D
---
At least he didn't get salty and DC.
---
Good Michael.
---
That was hilarious to watch
---
An new steam account you create so you can buy the game again and bully rank 20 players
---
Pretty good? I’d say it’s definitely the best, with Halloween as a close second. And points for the original Texas Chainsaw, the grainy way that it’s shot is just so disturbing
---
 Stop teasing and give us Sidney Prescott!
---
Yesterday night we had two BPS on with some randoms and of course we had to get against a tryhard Billy roaming the map in 10 seconds with absolutely no chill and 100% tunnel.
---
Then you don't need a lot of points
---
You mean Ace? He has Mettle of Man. This perk, upon being hit with a basic attack 3 times, will allow you to you to take another hit while injured.
---
It is being nerfed on the new chapter release, however.
---
No map or survivor :(. Wish we got  a new springwood map,a half parking lot half supermarket map wouldve been hilarious. Valuting through aisles or the gates at cash registers. Would be able to see over the aisles n find gens  unlike hospital
---
I honestly hate you for posting this comment. I was an innocent boi until I clicked that link... :/
---
Stop living in the past, smh
---
I'm pretty sure he meant the killer picking you up
---
Its only good for Bubba Basement build:
---
Insidious (of course)
---
Agitation (so you can transport them to the basement) 
---
Iron Grasp (same as the agitation)
---
Monstrous Shrine (cuz basement)
---
no headphones
---
For below green ranks I’d probably say Plague. She can instant break people once she finds them because they aren’t good at looping yet. Even if they do somewhat understand pallets and stuff you can break them easily and 1 hit them. Especially with infectious fright you can easily find others get super easy downs. But around 8+ I’d start recommending Spirit as she can beat loops and have goo map pressure.
---
A little background:
---
I would sy this is quite a sweaty game. I felt a little bit bad for this but I just had to run and let everyone else die.
---
I check back into the game, the other guy got the end game collapse upon him.
---
But this nea, didn't know what she does but the killer can't pick her up. And if the killer tried to hit her she just float up like killer is carring her and plop back into the ground.
---
She just stay there and not going anywhere. (Assume she was stuck) and she just live past end game collapse.
---
In the end killer had to exit the match.
---
I’m sorry to say, but many others told that using No Meither made the heals count.
---
If you say that it counts exactly as you replied, this is going to be so frustrating because the situations above happen all the time:
---
A) You get unhooked by another survivor and he/she will follow you until he/she starts healing you. He/she won’t leave you alone until you’re healed.
---
B) TOO MANY people use Self Heal perk, so it’d make the trophy too hard solo queuing (I solo queue 99% of the time). Even if you unhook someone and follow him/her to an hiding spot, he/she’s more likely to start self healing in front of you.
---
But i think they can still hear your breathing, so if they pay attention they might figure it out
---
Same. Looking forward to getting Ghostface to at least level 35-40
---
Depends on wich character you play, i had a similar rig, and it ran fine with 50-60fps, unless i played or played against the doc, wich caused severe drops.
---
Thanathofobia (probably spelled it wrong) is super good nurse perk, especially with Nurses Calling.
---
Is it? Ok I will put it on next time I get on
---
I see a lot of ashs. Probably because of mettle of man though
---
Give it a shot, i think youll get more out of it compared to insidious
---
I can hear his voice in my head "I will not sully my blade with your cowardice blood"
---
Yeah I rarely ever use insidious
---
Hex: good internet 
---
like all hexes it got cleansed at the start of the match
---
Ah damn. Some good ringtone in there thou;)
---
If the killer slugs your entire team to death without hooking, how would you be sure he is not actually farming with you all? Slugging is not reportable, killer has every right to play the way of not hooking anyone LITERALLY forcing you to bleed out on the ground. But at the same time, it allows other survivors farm by saving each other, complete gens and quite possibly leave the game as a full team, because killer never contributed to hooks. Would you report this or consider it a legitimate "play of the game"? :)
---
I bet, its pretty situational if you arent trying to camp
---
It is very much
---
Rest in Peace, as of today.
---
You will not be missed.
---
Like on his pp? Or looking up at David?
---
had survivors do something similar to prevent me from rancor killing the obsession. as annoying as it was, i had to give them credit for their dedication to keep their friend alive.
---
If you tunnel one guy everyone else leaves and wins, if you don't tunnel and get it you need more points.
---
not readied up yet so she can 6 second swap to ash with insta heal + mom like a true toxic survivor
---
NIIIIIIIIIIICE!
---
How do you know they won't ;)
---
Haha thank you very much :D
---
It's good that this stuff happens. However I think this is survivor talking to a survivor. A survivor talking to a Killer can be a completely different story (and vice versa)
---
That doesn’t seem very fun. I played against a rank 20 Nurse because matchmaking is broken and the game wasn’t much fun. Couldn’t land a hit for the life of her.
---
Who even makes these
---
yeah too true, I'd guess is they didn't see what I was referring to and just downvoted due to unreleated content or something
---
I did my first ever "hook camp" today. A toxic rank 7 p3 laurie popped in my game and I'm a rank 16. She kept t bagging me and was clicking her flashlight every time. I decided to camp her and I'd follow those who came up to her. She died and I got a 4K from that match but I still feel guilty about camping that laurie.
---
I can play it,even on low spec 720 i just want play the game with  avarage 30 fps
---
It is the killer fault here. Killer was able to pick up and hook, instead he got greedy and was trying to get another down.
---
People
---
Absolutely. Killer mains have this completely warped perception of how easy the other side's life is. Playing both sides will make you a stronger player overall.
---
Why teabag at the exits thats super disrespectful
---
Jeff, Adam or Laurie. Jeff has aftercare and distortion(aftercare is pretty neat for map knowledge and distortion counters bbq and nurses calling), Adam has deliverance and diversion (deliverance in general is a fantastic perk and diversion is great for Memes) Laurie has decisive strike and Object of obsession (ds is a great anti tunneling perk and OoO is amazing if you want to loop/distract the killer and know where they are at all times
---
[That's how keys work](https://imgur.com/KRmkiDx)
---
Hag loves the corn.
---
Oooooh!
---
I used Ashe so little that I forgot about it. Yeah... broken stuff. Thx &lt;3
---
how can you add this in a survivors offering?
---
“If the game is balanced without perks” short answer no. Long answer nooooooo
---
Sentinel would be completely broken and over powered.
---
He has no map pressure, good survivors can easily play around his saw, and is overall just an off brand billy. From my experience he’s really only viable against inexperienced survivors.
---
Every survivor build is viable. 
---
I wouldn't run MoM with this since you clearly dont want to get chased though.
---
Farming ResidentSleeper
---
It's such a nice feeling when you go around and see clensed totems, all that free map pressure with no effort at all.
---
Any good killer will tell you that the perk is bullshit lmfao.
---
Don’t wanna hijack your comment but I’ll do so anyways... does borrowed time now only work on a safe unhook? Haven’t used it in a couple months but put it on and used it against a camping cloaked wraith... it never activated once and I basically farmed my team mate 3 times lol.
---
If RBT kill will be way more profitable than a simple hook sacrifice, you'll get a lot of Pigs tunneling RBT survivors. Do we need even more tunneling Pigs?
---
congratulations, you unlocked a waste of a perk slot!
---
What is an immersed survivor?
---
&gt; I’d only play him to get his teachables.
---
You don't need to play a killer to get teachables. Play your best killer, spend BP on LF.
---
His power sounds good in theory, but in practice it’s just really situational. You slow down to 86% movement speed when you rev your chainsaw, which is way slower than a running survivor, so you lose distance on the survivor you’re chasing, and if they run around objects like trees or tires your bigger hit box and the stun if you touch anything means you have to cut the corners wider than the survivor, which makes you lose even more distance. So you basically won’t be able to use your chainsaw if a survivor is near a pallet, a window or any kind of substantial debris. This means that when you’re chasing survivors who aren’t bad or in a really bad position you have to use your basic attack most of the time. 
---
Combine all this with Leatherface’s low map pressure (since he has no movement ability) and he’s just sort of weak. Not outright terrible necessarily, but almost every other killer has a more useful power.
---
My fav build is; Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Self-Care and Botany Knowledge / Bond
---
Could’ve been cool if the model was chanced to a male one too, like legions skins
---
Hmm, killer main right?
---
Y'all a bunch of salty, whiny crybabies
---
Also look away from the exit gate to avoid triggering Spinechill. That might scare away survivors from approaching the gate in the first place.
---
Fucking loser
---
Thats just a minor problem with the grammar, the meme is well chosen
---
I'll play Scratched Mirror Myers all day on Lery's and show them the scares.
---
But he didnt know any better
---
See I'd just take Mad Grit over Monstrous Shrine. Feels far more competitive
---
Easy to loop and his power is easy to counter. ;)
---
You’ll hate me for this but...
---
KA KA KA KA KACHI DAZE
---
I love the idea of Sole Survivor applying to allies around you.
---
Amazing teammates
---
When Doctor runs Lullaby, Overcharge, Unnerving and Distressing. Literally the worst thing in existence. ;)
---
Long live the Hag!
---
This game can be great when people just want to have fun
---
Guess he wanted to capitalize on the double BPS
---
I got it for free too, it’s about $90 all up. I wouldn’t get ash. I’m killer main so I’d get all the killer DLC.
---
The real question is, how did NO generators get complete? 2 people free of threat from the killer and not a single gen was done.
---
You could’t live with your failure... so you came to nerf me.
---
more tunneling means more time wasted.
---
Dont forget dead hard!
---
Okay, I see. What about the Tantrum?
---
And just to have a good time probably. I would have been laughing so hard if I was that Myers
---
More tunneling means less fun for survivors.
---
I play on Xbox one. My chases usually last 15-35s, just depends on the map. The only infinites that I know of are in HaddonField and the Asylum. Not everyone runs balanced landing. Since the devs took out a lot of pallets, it’s quite easy to down survivors now, unless they go round all the pallets lol. (Not every pallet is safe)
---
Totally. His new cosmetics are on point.
---
This is gorgeous! I absolutely love it!
---
So you justifying it?
---
Running OoO against Spirit means you want to suicide, she's gonna find you and kill you. If it's me prepare for tunnel objects.
---
Damn!
---
kbye
---
Every Quentin needs his Freddy.
---
Fingers crossed.
---
No, it's just even more annoying it is done during these events. It's like going to someone's birthday party with a flamethrower with the intent to burn their house down.
---
Is that a blade made of hair? Because thats creepy af and I love it.
---
This looks sick
---
But *why*, though? It was done 5 times in a row last night with different killers. I don't understand how anyone finds that fun. It just makes the game unenjoyable for all parties.
---
Holy shit it took me like 5 minutes to find the Claudette
---
This is awesome, but the mask might have to be changed because it looks too much like the Purge masks
---
Chase them out then if it bothers you this much, or just alt+tab and do something else until endgame forces them out.
---
Same shit posted every day. You think your opponents online are ever going to change? Flaunting your victory is what people do, especially in online games. 
---
You have two options: Don't lose or stop caring.
---
Yes that's what's I'm saying. Running OoO is counterproductive
---
That's a great idea. I am going to have to try that.
---
So you are telling me ghost face is coming out in 31 hours not 7?
---
More towards chapter 13 from what they showed on the year 3 anniversary roadmap
---
Wow, that analogy.
---
And play Billy maybe?
---
Poor Freddy, doomed to eternal suckage
---
Tell me when you get it
---
It's fun to stay at the
---
Nah. He's explaining why it's still a thing.
---
Like facecamping, trolling wouldn't be a thing if people would react properly.
---
For one survivor, the other 3 get a free escape and the killer will depip to low ranks.
---
I LOVE this, esp the mask.  Actually reminds me of the Necromorphs from Dead Space 3 that had the winter wear
---
Or potatoes who are just standing in the corner doing nothing remotely useful, while you loop the killer for ~3-4 minutes.
---
Good luck with being able to play in it!
---
It's not justifying it's explaining why. There's people who don't care about getting bloodpoints and just want to incite reactions from people. Posts like these fuel it.
---
hi, it's me
---
This killer was clearly dumb
---
I know, I was just talking from a historical accuracy point of view
---
Yes it’s just straight survivors vs killers with no perks just their base power and survivors skill!
---
Get fucked trapper. Worst map? Try best killer map in the game.
---
When did this happen?  Because if it was today it’s possible the ghostface update arrived, so you could no longer play until it was updated.
---
Elaborate.
---
If you can't handle a bit of teabagging then you are not tough skinned enough to play games. You would be the guy who rage quits in a free for all on halo because someone teabags?
---
Seriously, ya'll acting like this guy is crazy when you're the ones freaking out and getting offended. If they teabag hit them. It is not always meant to be toxic, but celebratory. Really, for your own sake, don't let somebody celebrating ruin your mood, that is called being a sore loser.
---
You may not know this, but if you throw the pallet when the killer is close you stun the killer, allowing you to make it to the next loop
---
Ash: You can't defeat me.
---
M1 Killers: I know, but they can.
---
*scene flashes to Billy, Leatherface and Huntress*
---
It happened 3 times today starting from about 1 and a half hour ago
---
what did you do
---
Im a survivor main. And i agree with this.
---
How about mind your business? OP might be shy around couples, That and maybe he/she doesn't wanna hear flirting and sex talk hence why they think it's awkward.
---
That's really sad, then.
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Will ghostface be released today?
---
It happened to me twice yesterday, but I don’t know if my teammates got kicked as well. I honestly had the same question
---
So if I just flipped you off and called you a complete fucking loser after you lost a game of say basketball to me, you'd be totally cool right?
---
Cuz being a sore winner is fine, right?
---
I would be more comfortable to reply this if you had a screenshot or a specific description of what pallet you are talking about.
---
I am not sure if you are talking about the general pallets that killers like to bloodlust or something else. 
---
The purpose of pallets is to force the killer to break it and make him lose bloodlust. Some killers refuse to do this and try to stack BL3. As you learn how to you play, you can make him waste tons of a time in a single pallet by running around it and vaulting or fake vaulting at the right time. You won't be able to escape because eventually he will catch you with BL (unless the pallet is super safe) but you will punish him for it.
---
So he was trolling, it's a meme build, he moves slower than Nurse
---
He might be in low ranks, what spirit in rank 20-15 would know that was even an option without looking at videos? I rarely see it in rank 12.
---
I'm with you dude. It amazes me how upset and offended people get about 'teabagging' in this game. It isn't even real teabagging, just crouching loads because it is the only friendly/celebratory/toxic/fun action you can do.
---
They have nothing to say except 'assume' you are just a toxic player based on nothing. They need to grow a pair or go play viva pinata.
---
Hey, you dropped this \
---
I really wouldn’t consider it a nerf seems like a buff because you can get hit by noed and survive
---
Get Small Game or something, good for ruin, too.
---
&gt;You may not know this, but if you throw the pallet when the killer is close you stun the killer, allowing you to make it to the next loop
---
If he eats the stun and go around it without breaking, he will cut the distance just as fast because of bloodlust AND the next pallet will have to be dropped earlier since he will be fast from the beginning.
---
Unless the pallet is very unsafe, I always force them to break it instead of mindlessly dropping pallets.
---
Lmao. As a killer main, I'd still say that trapper is an idiot.
---
He was obviously trolling, it's a Burger King Myers build.
---
The exhaustion shouldn't be base kit but rather an addon and the exhaustion lasts 20/40/60 yellow/green/purple. "Doesnot Stack"
---
All pallets aren't necessarily meant to be "safe.". Some may just buy you time to get to the next one.  And if they're right on your ass, it may still provide you an opportunity to stun, even if it's not safe to loop.
---
Yup and fell for the bait. Killers fault all day long and you can’t blame the teammates for doing there job. Best teamwork I’ve seen in awhile!
---
There is a bug that prevents killers from letting you mori them used it against a Micheal who tried until I bled out
---
He was just trolling, you don't expect to kill anyone with Burger King Myers.
---
I think you mean ensure.
---
Upvote for Dildo School.
---
It isn't flipping you off and calling you a loser. It is the equivalent of celebrating winning the game. If that pisses you off you are a sore loser. 
---
If they go to chat and start insulting you then that is being a sore winner. 
---
While game play is still active and you haven't chased them out of the map it is fair game. you are choosing to take 'crouching' as toxic and getting upset by it. Sometimes people do it to say 'hit me' or 'gas me' and get some points before I escape.
---
Seriously I wouldn't expect players on this game to be so fucking fragile.
---
They're running some tests and probably want to gather live data.
---
OwO?
---
Lol i just noticed wth
---
I've mentioned to a friend before, that they could make an optional filter, which turned the whole game into a wholesome game between kids, where the person who's "it" leads the others to time out benches, while others are still seeing gruesome horror and murder.
---
Yeah, playing bps out of the event has the same value as in the event. If you played a match before and during the event, and used the bps before the event, it would be 2x bp from that match, then 2x from the match during the event, resulting in playing like 4 matches. If you use it during event, it is normal bp (1x) before the event  and triple the bp in the event (3x), again, resulting in a total of bp of 4 matches.
---
It's not the Scream Ghostface unfortunately. Devs only have the Ghostface license but not the Scream license.
---
Ohhh, damn
---
If I wanted to buy an outfit for Legion, I’d definitely “pick” this.
---
&gt;Peoplr aren't fragile.
---
Everyone circlejerking eachother in this thread is.
---
&gt;You're just part of the problem and biased because of your own shitty behavior.
---
Again, all you can do is make assumptions on how toxic I am, based on nothing, because you have no leg to stand on.
---
&gt;But I guess all those "ezzz" after games is just them celebrating too and im just too fragile right?
---
No this is being a sore winner and being toxic, as I just explained.
---
&gt;The fact that being a dick is so glorified and damn near meta for "mind games" is why games will always remain toxic shitholes, even if the devs are damn near dictatory like overwatch
---
Don't know wtf tangent you are spinning off on. Being a dick isn't glorified. Except with children.
---
The survivors have just had a hard ass game they didn't expect to win and made it to the gates and have a celebratory teabag. This lasts for all of 2 seconds and the game ends.
---
You have to remember there are different perceptions for each role. The killer feels like he is constantly being mugged off and the survivors are in control and it is like a time trial. The survivors are feeling like it is a difficult game and you are in control (unless you aren't that good) and that is a struggle to escape.
---
Well it says there’s still 6 hours left of the Bloodhunt, so unless it was to overlap it should drop when the BP event ends.
---
Once again, harmless joke. The joke was harmless like \*spell icup\*
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted. people feel like they are entitled to farming even though some people just WANT TO PLAY THE GAME
---
out of all the insults I get, and its a lot, I have never seen someone be racist.
---
&gt;that actually is not really true being experience on that server, I see people say gay all the time there, and I was banned for a simple joke. They just want to ban people, it is a bad experience, but people don't have 100% bad experience.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I see people use gay ALL the time, so it is a bad example.
---
I was once playing against this Bubba who must have been either super blind or had zero fucks to give. I was repairing this gen on the porch of a cabin and I saw him in the distance, he seemed to have seen me, so naturally, I go into the cabin and am planning to go upstairs and probably hide there and if he sees me, just jump don and bolt. The catch is that as soon as I walked into the cabin, my PC decided to go apeshit and I couldn't move. I'm trying to fix this muttering "shit shit shit shit" with the approaching heartbeat. Bubba walks into the cabin, and I'm telling you he saw me at that gen before and I wasn't hiding anywhere in the cabin, I was just standing there right next to the entrance, and he just...just walks right by me. Literally millimeters in front of me, just promenades by, brandishing his beautiful chainsaw and goes on to chase some poor survivor who had the bad luck to be somewhere in the area.
---
Still the funniest thing that has happened to me.
---
True, but BHVR have said nothing, so there's no concrete time.
---
How is it selfish to queue into a game to actually play the game. if i'm having a busy day and have like 1 hour to spare to play DBD i'm not gonna spend 20min or something of it farming. Just let us play the game in peace.
---
Shouldn’t matter I don’t think people can have the rights to masks designs.
---
How exactly is that lmao. She's a 110 Ms killer. You use her ability to enter a chase and ur just a Huntress without hatchets, which is widely regarded as shit. You'd be better off playing Wraith at that point since you'd be a 115 killer. 
---
And any smart Survivior that uses OoO is gonna assume ur phasing after them and plan accordingly. It's easy to tell when a killers seen ur aura with OoO, and bc of how telegraphed phasing is when you know it's happening, OoO hurts her more than it helps.
---
oh no

You see me pee? ew
---
This is the one time I'm disappointed someone didn't teabag at the gate, she deserved a little teabag back after that one haha. 
---
Nice play.
---
&gt; season three is due out this year
---
oh nice, I watched the first 2 on netflix ages ago and figured it got cancelled since nothing had happened
---
I always thought those spiri-titties were a little to on edge...  
---
Absolutely awesome artwork!
---
If you crouch you can walk over her traps. Always crouch over when unhooking/cleansing hex totems or just anywhere you saw her place the trap.
---
Are you also enjoying your t-shirt and jeans tonight?
---
they must just want to get away from the idea that some dlc is lesser than others
---
She learned her lesson lmao
---
There’s a Claudette in this?
---
I would enjoy this. Am severely emetophobic. Cannot face Plague. It's not even her that's the problem, it's the sounds the survivors make once you get hit with vomit.
---
I just had the same Killer twice.
---
First he camped as Leatherface, then tunnelled as Freddy.
---
Both times, he said "get better" as if it was my fault he camped as the best camper and tunnelled as the best tunneller!
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Over charge becomes useless at mid/higher ranks  even with doctor
---
Dead by da light
---
If matchmaking prevented smurfers from filling that bag up on new players we could get better at the game.
---
Hey kid, why don’t you uhhhhhhh go fuck your mother.  K?
---
Nice thank u fery mush
---
Freddy: "Am I a joke to you?"
---
As a trapper main on console this makes me kinda sad, but that’s a really nice play!
---
They won’t becoming tiring if they’re all as good as this awesome job!
---
Thank you so much for that tip!!! I've had the game for at least 4 months and never knew that's how you avoid them!
---
Perhaps this is not relevant to the discussion but can Decisive Strike cause another survivor (who does not have DS) to be the obsession in a match where the killer is not running an obsession perk, seeing how DS results in you being the obsession only after you use it?
---
I personally knew a group of people who smurfed together on PS4. It always confused me why they did it since progress is divided between accounts (the only one who had a legit reason to do so was the first to do it, basically he had his account wiped and bloodpoints refunded and saved them to p3 new characters as they were released and couldn't actually earn bp on that account for that reason.) you don't get shards/keep cosmetics, and it bloats friendlists.
---
That tweet was from yesterday..
---
He'll be out at 12pm est like all dlc has been released so far.
---
Anniversary probably starts after the bloodhunt.
---
Myers on memorial institute = jumpscares for days. Most fun I've had in this game is against killers who stay tier 1 on that map.
---
The rework is today 😆
---
Didn’t rven know they sold the game at mc store lol
---
Rip us console users. Shafted again lol.
---
It's very rare but it still happens
---
Wow you're much better at dealing with arseholes than I am. What's the secret?
---
Two words: 3 gen
---
All he meant was the killer shouldn’t have got greedy for another down.
---
Downvoters are sheep :(
---
The only problem I have with that game is that 90% of the hunters camp
---
Am I looking at Balanced Landing and Sprint Burst together
---
It is more of a game of jailbreak.
---
So many downvotes LMAO i hate farming too, its so boring. I'd rather dc tbh
---
I probably played over thousand hours and I still think he's annoying
---
I don't even laugh, I just say, "Go for someone else before 3 gens get done" cause after that I'm getting face camped or tunneled right off the hook.
---
Someone needs to hand that man his inhaler.
---
Who's the guy with the traps?
---
A david was throwing pallets then teabag and would  flash me to top it off... I watched as the entity killed him while the others escaped.
---
Must be some dlc character we don't know about .
---
Get fucked 100
---
Anyone else get a rebooted Tomb Raider vibe here?
---
What's inside it?
---
Didn’t see the blendette at first
---
It was useful on PS4 on Doc, but yeah, framerate
---
They don't want him to become Legion.
---
Haha
---
I'm not the BEST killer (play more survivor) but one thing I noticed you could have done differently was to not break the pallets when you chased the Kate and the Dwight. When Dwight dropped the first pallet it was super unsafe. It actually would have been better if you left it up. And both times they dropped pallets they ran away instead of continuing to loop it any way. It would have saved time.   
---
If you down another survivor and know one is nearby (like when you downed Dwight), you should have gone for Kate instantly. It was her who popped the gen nearby. The killer always has to create pressure.   
---
On the other hand, those gens went by way too quickly. From a survivor perspective I even think gen times should be slightly slower, or a new second objective. It kind of ruins the experience of the game for both sides when it's over so fast like this.
---
Moonwalk up on them, either you get your points or they don't.
---
SWF
---
Actually a really awesome idea
---
Yeah it's really well hidden so I won't spoil it
---
Does the pallet need to hit the killers so its instandly destroyed or can he destroy a downed pallet instandly no matter wat. If he can destroy the pallet no matter wat the power would be almost to strong making every pallets. If he needs to get hit by the pallet to instandly destroy the pallet his power is useless cause it can avoided very easily
---
Hell yeah, gg! Deserved a teabag for sure
---
Gonna take a wild guess and say dirt
---
thats the most satisfying thing when you play the killer
---
I feel like it's a waste of perk slot though...
---
Idk it might be a me thing but anyone who has played enough can hit that overcharge even when it goes all over the place. I'd say the only time it's a challenge is with unnerving presence. But even then there's much better perks that can slow down the game paired with doctor.
---
Perk icons are placeholders and I'm relatively new to the game so I wouldn't be the best option for 'balancing', just went with the idea of a brute who can chase down survivors and cause damage to their obj.
---
today I’ve got my Gucci sweatpants with my Valentino ghostbusters shirt, as I am working today
---
Of course the perks a bit op I just mean great idea overall
---
In solos yeah. Swf it depends, if the killer knows what he's doing it's gon get pretty hard to impossible.
---
No problem! Another thing you can do is shine on them with a flashlight and they will be destroyed.
---
Wow this is one of the best of not the best fan art for this game I've ever seen.
---
It's selfish to tell people they can't farm during a farming event. If you had a busy day during a farming event, maybe play another day. You can play dbd whenever you want, our 4 day farming event doesn't just come every week or something. So like you say, let us farm in peace, just for the damn 4 days.
---
I imagined it as, Mr.X gets stunned, grunts and punches through the pallet destroying it instantly.
---
He still has a normal kicking / punching animation for regular pallets that were dropped down without stunning him.
---
Lol fucking pork
---
Oh my fucking god. It's reportable. And if it gets reported, they investigate and take actions. If everyone is fine with farming then of course there won't be anyone to report. Your reply very clearly confirms everything I've been saying.
---
You are baffling. Look at yourself in the mirror right now and ask "Am I being stupid?"
---
Well sometimes killers are fed up with survivors bullshit and want to strike back, others are just toxic killers.
---
And then they complain that you're tunneling
---
I am not justifying their behavior but I think that some people just want attention and do it by getting a rise out of people. I think the best way to counter them is to just say gg and move on.
---
Thank you, I made them myself.
---
No bc it wouldn't be fair.
---
If you need to pick between sprint burst and balanced landing right now, balanced landing is by far the superior choice (in my opinion). I'd rate it as the best exhaustion perk because it's the only exhaustion perk with a passive built in to it (no stagger when you fall even if it's on cooldown).   
---
My build is adrenaline, balanced landing, borrowed time and then the 4th perk is interchangable. If you're new consider taking self care, or bring a medkit and take something else you like the look of. I used to use self care a lot when I first started but once you get new to the game you can generally play without it and find another to heal you.
---
&gt; Small Game - Add effect: Indicates how many totems remain on the map, including Dull and Hex totems. Your cleansing speed is increased by 4/5/6%
---
I don't know exactly how long it takes to cleanse a totem, but 6% won't make a difference. It feels like ~20s, so 20/1.06 = 18.87s, shaving just more than a second off.
---
&gt;Slippery Meat - Add effect: Time it takes for you to wiggle out is decreased by 5/6/7%
---
Have it decrease 4/8/12% to counter Iron Grasp
---
&gt;Technician - Add effect: Reduces failed Repair skill check penalty by 2/3/4%
---
A failed skillcheck reduces progress by like 5% (4 seconds). Reducing that to 3.84s makes no impact. Reducing the penalty by 25/50/75%, and have it work on 'good' checks with ruin actually makes it viable. (You almost never fail a skillcheck on a generator anyways, this will make it useful against ruin). This would reduce a 'good' ruin check from 5% to 1.25% regression.
---
&gt;Sole Survivor - Apply the effects to all survivors within 8 meters as well (counters BBQ or Nurse’s Calling if you are repairing with others/healing or being healed)
---
SS range should be added on top of the 40m BBQ range: 2 People dead = 40/44/48m range, which means that there is an 8m sweetspot to heal your teammate.
---
&gt;Left Behind - For each survivor that has been killed or sacrificed, your Repair speed is increased by 0.5/1/1.5% for each generator that is not completed. (This does not apply until at least one survivor has been eliminated.)
---
When there are fewer gens to do, the game is harder, this perk is more effective when there are many gens to do. At max it gives a 22,5% increase, but you are sure to lose if you are the last survivor and have to do 5 gens. If everyone brings this, it could save a couple of seconds, but you want to avoid getting your teammates killed. At 1k 2g this would only net into a ~4% speed increase overall. I don't know how to fix this perk, but this ain't it.
---
I agree with most other suggestions, especially the no mither &amp; broken changes.
---
UPVOTE THIS POST
---
I love legions sounds hilarious
---
It happens very often at crotus prenn in the main building where the basement can spawn.  There is also always a window very close makes you able to loop a killer for ages. Maybe the strongest loop atm. If not playing nurse hag or trapper to somehow break the loop you better dont chase a survivor there
---
Nah it’s fine, Spirit Halloween sells knock off masks that look exactly the same as the Purge ones, I don’t think it matters.
---
ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT HAVING A BROKEN DOUBLE PALLET IN YOUR GAME??? THIS IS A GIFT FROM GOD HIMSELF
---
Also insta pallet in Stage II only, it's just a part of his transformation. His normal hand attack now has the transformed claw attack (Super Tyrant), it will injure in one hit (Like Myers Stage III, but his Super Tyrant lasts 15 seconds less than EWIII)
---
So flashlights have other uses then getting me killed while attempting to blind a killer?????
---
Literally me and my mate are tapp and quentins mains, me as tapp and him as quentin. Although you are correct i see noone else play them XD
---
Same with genrush
---
I got my 1 million and dipped, literally every game was tunneling ebony mori Freddy and insidious Bubba at red ranks. Usually the 2x BP events are fine for me but this was the worst one Ive experienced.
---
You should add a shovel since they were widely used weapons in ww1
---
I just don’t take it personally and I couldn’t careless about how someone is acting towards me over the internet.
---
Her Cuteness - The Pig
---
For everyone scared to click it, so far wasnt bad (only went 2 days down) even a girl cosplaying with her en-titty out. But scared to go further than that
---
I would say If this wouldn't be called a Chapter People just freaking out that the didn't get a Chaper in Time and just Paragraph, just because they did It last year didn't mean they need to do it every Year.  
---
And they never said actually a Chapter needs to be a Killer with a Survivor and a Map, they just that the next 4 Chapters are with a Killer, Survivor and a Map. And these 4 where the Clown, Spirit, Legion and the Plague.  
---
I wouldn't mind a Survivor but we get use to it, because we will just get 2 new Maps this Year and maybe there is again a Stand alone Charakter in these Chapters that there doing.  
---
But hey it's cool anyways. Just because we get this Memes.
---
Frank stop eating dirt 🙄
---
As a huntress main, I can assure you that smacking trees gives us an advantage. If Huntress is throwing her hatchets at trees, then it’s just the bad hitbox. Those things are so bad that I have gotten used to purposely missing because it just is like that. Also the thing just gets stuck on everything. But smacking trees is definitely a viable strategy
---
As I mentioned below, perks can always be mended and adjusted, new player so I wouldn't be the top person to ask about balance, just wanted to bring the idea of a Resi crossover.
---
We already had movies so a famous horror game would be cool too.
---
"Scream"?
---
Smh....
---
Since the beginning of time, still annoying
---
Daaaaaaamn
---
Just wanting to have a balanced game ya know
---
His power is nonexistent against decent survivors
---
Today? Wat
---
I had the same issue once, they gave me ~300k bp back. No need for screenshots. Took about an hour after I contacted support.
---
Are devs aware of this?
---
This. theres no reason they couldn't have picked you up if they wanted to.
---
Plus even if they downed someone else there, they would only have been able to hook one.
---
I hear you. I’m in the same boat. There just something nostalgic about double pallets
---
Except survivors have literally nothing to do but gens. There is no other way to win but to do gens.
---
Killers win either way, and so if they don't want to be an asshole, they should win by....not being an asshole.
---
Views, bro.
---
Will there be new trophies?
---
Players are perfectly capable of choosing to not be an asshole. That they are allowed to do it doesn't somehow compell them to do it.
---
Oh wow, that’s actually amazing.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if it was. Us is one of the largest country's
---
Played as a baby Doc, I was chasing a rank 4 (was 13 at the time) and I accepted defeat because I wasn't able to get any downs. This survivor tbags me after every pallet so I chase him for 2 gens, I stay on his tail but don't hit him. The last one popped, followed him after adrenaline, down with NOED and mori'd him with Rancor. I let the other three go, it was very satisfying.
---
Oh yeah he just calls her jigsaw. Kinda boring
---
None of those things prevent people from playing the game, they are things that make it more likely for someone to lose.
---
Camping/tunneling early effectively prevents someone from playing in the first place. That's toxic.
---
Its just 3% more...
---
People doing clickbait thumbnails on YT - "World Record Bloodpoints Gain!!!!1! Never seen before!"
---
I don't get it
---
Only thing tanturm does is counter lockers really.
---
clowns laugh is the sexiest
---
Until rank 8 or so? Yes.
---
So can you leave with the trap on, or was is because the dead hard? Asking because I don't know.
---
Goes both ways chief.
---
So killers should just play normal. Gotcha
---
Right. They only do it just to piss people off, and I can't comprehend how someone gets their rocks off at the expense of others.
---
I want that now
---
Yes but the difference is I only see a BPS every 3/4 Bloodwebs whereas presumably because this is an event offering there may be 2/3 of these per Bloodweb which means nearly everyone should be using one each match.
---
Im not sure but palletplacement is changed every few months also they talked about the mapreworks they will do over the year. So i guess the issue will be fixed sooner or later. Maybe if you join crotus preen next time you check out if the doublepallet is ther or not. Wont happen all the time but i feel like there is a 50 % chance cause it happens many times to me.
---
i would of been laughing so hard as survivor haha
---
True
---
Can people stop making 50 posts and read the front page?
---
It doesn’t bother me as killer, I actually find it to be funny as I often can turn it into an extra kill if I have my Tier 3 saved up. perks of being a Myers main. it’s when I see my teammates doing it, that’s what bugs me. 
---
We are perfectly capable of celebrating without having it be at the expense of another person. You use the excuse that toxic behavior is commonplace in games, and you’re totally right. It is. But tell me again why I shouldn’t make an effort to stop it when I see it? To paraphrase from the guy below, it’s the equivalent of flipping someone off after a basketball game. Imagine how much of a fucking tool you’d look like to the people on the opposite team and to the people in the crowd? Not cool man.
---
I get it, you’re numb to “toxic” behavior. that’s cool and all but not everybody feels the same way about watching their teammates blatantly disrespect somebody after what perhaps was not the best game for them. DbD can be immensely frustrating at times as I’m sure you’re aware. Is it really too much to ask that we treat each other with a bit of respect?
---
Why bring historical accuracy up? Historical accuracy clearly wasn't his intention.
---
Exactly! I’m very excited. It’s finally time to prestige my Feng
---
ofc it's always the survivor with OoO that sucks hard in a chase
---
Greedy makes the killer not able to get more kill
---
No way! I was on there website looking for support but only seen the shitty help center, where is it?
---
Yeah, that's exactly what happens. Did doing any of that help with the problem?
---
He called you lucky? You're lucky he was a dumb dumb.
---
Lmao why even drop someone to close the hatch? Just hook em.
---
(Picture taken from Google.) I was just wondering though, do you think her cosmetics need brightening or something? I think it would benefit killers massively. It should stop Claudette's from just crouching all game, waiting for the hatch to spawn.
---
They did called it a chapter in tweets and forum posts
---
Farmer wants to farm.
---
Someone doesn't want to farm.
---
That person is being selfish for not wanting to farm, but the farmer isn't selfish for forcing it?
---
Beesflash, forcing people to do something they don't want to do is selfish.
---
As killer if they run up to me wanting to farm I mori them. No thanks, move on to the next match please.
---
If you remove his ability to stalk mid chase, give Ghostface imminyy to decetion. Honesty don't know why any stealth killers don't have this.
---
also is weird he can see his timer but others can't.
---
The best way to play her, is to never use the ambush.
---
Id love to sign up, but Im on ps4. They probably dont want my feedback.
---
Ok, it's fine. I'll just break the totem and...
---
*Leatherface appears*
---
Oh geez, look at the time, it's escape gate o' clock!
---
Yeah, makes me remember the good old days
---
The activation of the trap only happens when a generator is activated
---
I only play super immersed Claudette when I have had a really bad stretch of matches. I really don't mind them either way. I like her perks. Especially botany knowledge.
---
No escape: fuck all your mindgames and make chases harder for yourself
---
Let’s hope for good reworks then
---
man, i know it's not  fun, sometimes i enter games with 400 ms from the killer by accident, it's horrible, but, i don't think you got the ideia here.
---
I'm not going to stop playing the game because my internet trolled me only 4 times (and i have about 505 hours) :/
---
And that is not frequent, it happens like once a month.
---
Pre patch BNP 🤙🤙🤟
---
Geez yeah hahaha
---
Psst I know a secret technique...  
---
...just Bodyblock under a Hook...  
---
...it count's to Protection Hits.
---
Had a game yesterday where I was pretty much in the same situation. Only escaped because of helpful teammates, was really great to have that
---
Yeet

---
kill orders seems unfun, even more with dying light
---
You also forget it gives her tracking, making it nearly impossible to hide. So she ranged attack that lasts 45 seconds. Do what you do vs a t3 Myers.
---
Yea for sure! I hope at least one of them gets an event cosmetic
---
She's ok as a starter and for blending in otherwise meh
---
What time is he coming out? Im in the game now but I don't see him.
---
There is a minimal amount of pallets set for each map. if the map generates normally and it doesn't have enough pallets, those get thrown around
---
You do realise the number of tryhard killers/survivors vs the number of farming killers/survivor is like 9:1 during this event that only lasts 4 days right? If you don't want bloodpoints or anything and just want a proper game, and you know people are farming in the current game, just leave and requeue. I'll bet you your next game that probably starts in 2minutes will be against a tryhard killer or a tryhard SWF team so you can enjoy to your heart's content.
---
That's fair enough. I'm not having a go at people that play her, I was just wondering what others think. Usually when I die and spectate her, killers usually run past them loads
---
Ah so before the trap was always activated when all gens are done? When did they change this :D
---
It has a counter tho, status effect is removed by performing Altruistic actions for a few seconds.
---
I just think it's the dumbest thing to watermark a meme especially the way he did it lol you can literally crop out the bottom inch of the image and boom no watermark lmao. Do people care that much about their memes where they can't stand the thought of them being reposted?
---
There is a decent enough balance of immersed Claudettes and survivors with visible-from-space outfits to where it's not super duper terrible.
---
I used her when I started tbf. Mainly because I didn't know what I was doing/wanted self care
---
I mean a lot of the times I leave and come back and see the injured guys scratch marks so...
---
there is no sidney
---
Survivors doing generators quickly because the killer is applying very little map pressure is not even on the same plane of existence as killers that choose to face camp for literally no reason. I say this as a red rank killer main.
---
What is sidney?

---
HOW DID YOU WAKE UP THE FIRST TIME
---
I play nea and Kate because I like the way they look, but if I wanted to be a survivor main, and I wanted the best possible setup I could use, I'd use Claudette. Her camouflage is next level. As a killer main, I've gotten good at spotting them but I'm sure I miss a ton too and don't even know :p
---
Fair enough, I usually wear the brightest clothes possible on most of my survivors tbf
---
i failed a skill check while healing
---
it's not what I'm talking about tho. I don't care about the debuff
---
Maybe a health skill check?
---
They can. Behaviour had that problem with ghostface
---
It was so damn quick thoni hardly noticed
---
Im pretty sure your friends cant play it on  PC, maybe Stream it, but that doesnt Change anything
---
It is the "shitty" help center, [https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us).
---
Submit a ticket for "loss of progress", and make sure to fill all the boxes.
---
The first perk, "can be used on 2 gens at a time" but the cooldown is longer than the active time so it can only be used on one gen at a time. Also the 3rd perk is blatantly broken.
---
I know now lol, I just had to relook and I found it
---
The game is 100% balanced around hooking and getting unhooked, not getting all 5 gens and escaping without anyone being caught. If you're finding it going off so frequently that you would call it a 'crutch,' then you're camping way too frequently. Go find other survivors.
---
Lmao, no you didn't. I know you didn't, because there's literally no trace of anyone being banned because of saying 'spell icup.' Unless you were banned literally 2 years ago, and if so the mod team and rules have been improved severely.  
---
Don't make a lie that can be so easily fact checked.
---
“Disgusting” took me out lmaoo
---
I got a good perk. Inspired by his ability to smash down walls and scare the shit out of me.
---
Destroying 4/3/2 pallets makes you more determined. You can walk through (and destroy) the next dropped pallet you see.
---
*being hit by a pallet resets the ability
---
Surprised a Myers has not scared you yet but hag does
---
I usually play Jake with the bright tracksuit and cowboy hat, so I stick out quite a lot. I have thought about using her tbf, especially if I'm not playing well, but I never really do. I suppose if killers wear headsets it's not too bad to find her. But yeah I bet you've missed quite a lot :p
---
My bad. Pretty damn* good!
---
And then pins his major fuck up on probably the best map for killer. LOL
---
&gt; It doesn’t bother me as killer,
---
Me neither. like not, at all.
---
No it just isn't toxic behaviour to celebrate for 2 seconds at the end of the game. If they are reaallly taking the piss then it is easy to down them and get the points.
---
No it isn't the equivalent of flipping someone off. Not in my opinion anyway. That would be the equivalent of directly messaging something toxic.
---
No its not being numb to toxic behaviour it is just not getting offended by somebody celebrating. You have no leg to stand on here. Just hit them, move on, don't get upset and post about it on reddit. It isn't disrespect. This is all on you being upset for losing. There are blatant things people do to be toxic, but teabagging is not one of them. In a game sense it actually helps you because it wastes their time.
---
I'm all for respect. I often see teabagging at the exit gates meaning 'gg' and 'give me a hit and get some points' as well as minor celebration.  It really amazes me that this pisses people off. Sorry that you feel this way, but I don't think you should be ganging up on this guy for pointing out how minor your 'problem' is.
---
oh what the fuck  
---
im not that braindead i swear
---
That was amazing. I usually die on my first hook if I'm not playing SWF
---
NEA... of all people would not be the one judging. 
---
She'd be the one doing it.
---
The first one makes me think of an anti aura perk. Could be a killer perk that stops ALL aura reading in the game for the killer and the survivors but that sounds like it shuts down to many perks.
---
It makes perfect sense for a slug build. 
---
Distressing for the larger terror radius - combos with Dead rabbit
---
Deerstalker to track the slugs
---
Butcher for longer heal times 
---
And Cal for even worse heal times. 
---
This way if they try to save someone it may take forever unless they got to 99 on their bar.
---
Ooooh, thanks! I didn't know that
---
As a Plague "main": How dare you!
---
Dude, this is epic, i'd defiently purchase this skin
---
If you don’t camp or tunnel BT is literally one of the least worrying parts of the killer experience
---
i hope killers like this will get a sweaty tryhard swf to demolish them + 2 minutes so your team could do 3 gens... 2 MINUTES. i swear, your teammates were as braindead as that Plague
---
Them juicy extra bp. That's the only reason.
---
r/brag
---
Nice idea!
---
I'm still relatively new to this game and the perks I put for him might be OP or underwhelming, but it's more about about the idea of a Resi crossover. Wouldn't care if they change everything about him or even put in a different Killer-Survivor duo (I imagined it as Mr.X - Leon.. but it can also be Birkin - Claire or Nemesis - Jill)
---
Even then, those survivors will cry camping/tunnelling because they think they can still yolo save right in front of the killer. BT or not, still gotta use some common sense when it's not in the end game.
---
Trapper is best boi.I am the epitemy of a true basement dweller with trapper.😈
---
It’s not about the mask it’s about the person behind it.
---
As someone who's been in the server for well over 6 months, this is completely false and/or exaggerated, just like your other post.  
---
The word gay can be used, but not in a derogatory way.   
---
I have literally never seen someone use it in a derogatory way and not be warned by staff.
---
Now the dude has complained that I "ruined his fun" by calling him out on his behaviour; and says that if he sees me, he'll facecamp me...
---
Imagine saying that you didn't care about your Mom ...
---
I love it.
---
Maybe after experiment devs will find out nurse is way too op. Of course if its not gonna be played by complete potato. One can hope.
---
Yeah kinda confused why u made a video on a speculation post on reddit with a link to the reddit and posted your video to reddit , and its not a official update or am i wrong?
---
Well, being the worst killer doesn't mean being bad at killing i guess
---
“Good Survivors shouldn’t get hooked in the first place if they are skilled” 
---
Lmao
---
There was some game that got into law issue because their killer had a hockey mask. It was the F13 people bitching about that.
---
They will use masks.
---
oh sureeeeeeeeeeeee ofc its the toxic nea you think you can bring us down?
---
Thing is, my lad, Borrowed Time only goes off if you're within Terror Radius of the hook. If you actually got tf away from the hook, you wouldn't have to deal with it at all.
---
Hag on corn map &gt;
---
Cupboard
---
Oh right mb forgot about that, ok yeah greedy piggy then, either that or they were trying to force them out so they cant body block but idk
---
you’re one lucky ass boi. Not wanna talk about t3 myers or nurses
---
&gt;good survivors shouldn’t get hooked in the first place if they are skilled.
---
This has to be a shitpost, right? right???
---
Borrowed Time is fine, if it bothers you so much, then just play Wraith and chase people with BT while cloaked, so the timer from BT will go down.
---
You can also press ctrl (or whatever your crouch button is) while getting unhooked to basically get unhooked crouching, so you won't trigger the traps the second you touch the ground
---
*Decisive strike has entered the chat*
---
No, he did not. You might want to read that again.

It’s beautiful &lt;3333 I would instabuy it for my feng
---
Or just hit the unhooker.
---
r/deadbydaylight 
---
The only community that can take less jokes than they dish out. My -25 is the equivalent of 4 SWF disconnecting on their last hooks and then crying about NOED that didn't even get used.
---
People say its racist but its literally an advantage to have a black character in dbd
---
Hes probably in a group w/ one of the others. This game unfortunately matchmakes off the lowest rank survivor in a party.
---
This looks awesome but what about when he feral frenzies with the pick how will that work?
---
How does me leaving and re queuing help anyone? Everyone just gets shunted out of the game and has to requeue again themselves, and lose their offerings. At least if they see I'm playing normally, they can just work normally on objectives and earn bloodpoints that way. I won't try-hard, I will take it easy and let them go through the gens quickly. 
---
Contrary to popular belief, these events are not 'FARMING EVENTS'. The double bloodpoints is intended for people to simply play normally but get an added celebratory reward for doing so. I actually may be petty and start reporting survivors, if I'm playing survivor, who are farming with the killer. There is a rule against 'working with the killer', and there is no written exception 'except for FARMING LOL!'
---
And besides, if I've taken a mori with me, I'm using it. 
---
Quite frankly, farming irritates me because it completely ruins my immersion in the game as a whole. A silly killer running under pallets and everyone twirling around. I want to believe that this is a real horror scenario. That's why I bought the game.
---
If people DC, fine, I may spend a few minutes letting survivors rack up points, maybe give one of them the hatch. But I'm not running under pallets and oinking in friendship.
---
No offense, but it just looks like a tweaked Legion with broken perks.
---
Well so many survivors are so high and mighty about their ability to run killers around. I’ve seen plants of survivors run good killers around for multiple gens.
---
Bruh I love this
---
Theoretically - yes, everyone can hit that skillcheck. On practice - most of the time they don't when I play Doc. Haven't tried it on other characters because yeah it won't be as useful.
---
Respect the Moms, don't care about the MoMs.

As a character? I love Claudette. I adore her actually. I also think she has super cute cosmetics that they've made for the shop that unfortunately go unused because of what she generally represents.
---
And that's not to say everyone who plays Claudette plays like this but the majority are usually the kind that urban evade everywhere in her darkest clothing, darkest hair/head choice, have sprint burst so they can jet away, and usually just don't play anything buy gen simulator.
---
That side of Claudette? I'm not a fan of. And in general any survivor can be that. But unfortunately she just excels at it.
---
So I guess what I really hate is stealth gameplay and Claudette is the scapegoat for most people.
---
I know, but whenever I play the survivors dive bomb the hook so I rarely get away from it.
---
I am the only one who don't care If I didn't get out when the Killer is Standing right next to me at the Endgame?
---
What a fun game that sounds like
---
I don’t though. Survivors always dive bomb hooks whenever I play so I’m usually chasing them near the hook.
---
I think this skin would look way better if they would just remove Legion from the game.
---
Lets play 'Where's Claudette'
---
Thank you for this Ted Talk.
---
I'm not here to punish you, I'm here to sacrifice you.
---
When I think its a swf group I like to bring Agitation and Mad Grit.. funny how many downs I get with it but ye a team of p3 claudettes can be annoying.. especially when I get messages that say "nice tunnel"..  like you guys all look the same so what the hell..
---
Wgat
---
You don't have to use all of your power to get to them, either use it in small bursts or use a cd add on.
---
&gt;And any smart Survivior that uses OoO is gonna assume ur phasing after them and plan accordingly.
---
If they EVER see you phasing, they are gonna assume you are going after them? I don't think I can agree with you there, if they think you are going after them every time you use your power then they won't be doing much in terms of progressing the game.
---
Fun is very subjective.
---
I always hook them first. Not risking the chances of them having adrenaline AND a key until they are hooked. But that trapper was an idiot also
---
Borrowed time is fine. Yes it's a strong perk, but it's not too strong. It allows fun moments at the endgame where survivors can make clutch saves. If it's impacting you regularly before the endgame you should probably try camping and tunnelling less.
---
Thats a bad idea tho, because no killer will want to go against swf.  The only option is to deal with it and get better at the game as you play... i know it's stressful when you get a full swf team with instaheals and all metaperks, that want to dominate the killer... but if you remove swf alot of people will stop playing the game. So i guess as a killer you just have to endure it, even if it's ass to do so.
---
Just use a med kit
---
Pro tip: Sometimes doing this to random lockers around hooks/gens or when you kind of suspect someone to be in a locker saves you the time of opening lockers and usually scares people out of it. Plus it's just really fun when it works
---
If it means I get downed before I can fucking move, fuck you.
---
That's why I mentioned her cosmetics and not her skin tbf. I mean, Adam's standard outfits both have big, beige overcoats which make him easy to spot. Just thought they should have done the same with Claudette
---
r/ subtlebrag
---
Honestly your ideas were cool.
---
I love Resi and seeing Mr X roaming and stomping around would be crazy cool. Having DBD do a crossover with a horror game franchise would be great. They'll run out of movie franchises at some point.
---
Franklins as trapper.. smack them and then trap their item!  xD
---
You have to change your settings to see NSFW things
---
That wasn't the joke, the joke was as harmless as that, the joke isn't spell icup, I said the joke was \*harmless LIKE\*.
---
Calm down, jesus.
---
Why did you crop out artist's name?
---
It's not even instaheals and meta perks. That's fine. I can put up with MoM and syringes and DS and headon.
---
I'm talking about the people who are swarming hooks, farming each other, offering no chases or doing any gens, just to D/C on last hook so you get pretty well nothing and they give no fucks that they got nothing.
---
I don't know if you've played killer this event, but it's literally the worst event I've ever played and I've been here since day 1. I drop a BP offering, and legit this has been happening almost every single time.
---
&gt; I’m usually chasing them near the hook
---
Then don't switch targets and BT won't be a problem for you
---
Every dlc has been at noon eastern. That's when the store updates I think
---
I wonder if she just does that to every locker and after you jumped out she just went "the fuck it actually worked for once!"
---
Spine Chill, Lithe, Prove Thyself and either Borrowed Time or WGLF
---
I’d rather get hope tbh
---
You make fair points, thanks for your input. I have no problem with Claudette herself, I actually used her a lot when I first got the game, because I always used self care. I always wore her green apron as I thought that it was the best looking tbf.
---
I guess I agree. There are so many people that use Claudette to be as sneaky as possible, which I find annoying - but yeah, she just excels at it and it's just the viable option for a lot of people.
---
On the PS4 they still do it, but they get punished when reported
---
Well, this looks like 5x bp event :D. I will most likely make videos leveling up 1-50 ghost face and then for P1 and P2, for P3 I will do it much later because I want P3 all perks grind type of video.
---
**bruh** why would you not just say the actual joke, unless it wasn't actually- *hmm*  
---
Still though, this don't add up chief,  you would've gotten a warning and would've only been banned if you for some reason argued with the mods and not just going with the rule or you continued doing the rule break.  
---
This Subreddit is one of few that can do the very thing they're being meme'd about in the meme post.
---
being able to just down and mori your obsession straight away won't feel good to the person you're killing
---
I kinda dislike the effort to put into farming but if I see 2+ BPS, I am sure as hell not giving up the opportunity. Literally everyone benefits from farming, it's like giving a survivor a hatch. A killer could get a few more points or give 1 lucky guy 7k BP.
---
Any exhaustion perk, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike is probably the best build right now.
---
Mettle of Man is getting a big nerf today, so don't use it outside of meme builds.
---
I guess. Idk. Double bloodpoints has brought out the most annoying survivors and it’s just really annoying. But hey that’s just me.
---
I don't think those killers were as good as you think.
---
Just pick up the survivor 4Head, they weren't even healing you to prevent the killer from picking you up
---
Nice concept, confused on how the pick would work seeing as how legion in his frenzy and Mori stabs, not swings.
---
From the day I started playing this game till now, the only time I encounter farming killers is during this double blood point time, which lasts just 4 days, and even so, like I said, the number of games you get farmy people vs the number of games with tryhard people is pretty much 9:1 or even less. So you can't let go of 1 or 2 games where people want to farm? Is it thaaaat hard to let go of 1 or 2 games out of say 30?
---
What hair colors would you like?
---
You would think it would give you the option to do that there.    Thanks for help.
---

---
strange I actually thought behaviour is Canadian
---
these memes are the reason I wake up in the morning.
---
Of you want an actual hide and seek game then I suggest taking a look at Hide or Die
---
you just didn't put points into your bill since the event. I have those of many killers and survivors too
---
They're not all bad, but I don't think most Clads are toxic players but I think most toxic players play Claud if that makes sense. They know they're being shitty to other people so they need that edge. 
---
For example last game I was farming with a team, and putting 'Good Claud' on the hook, 'Toxic P3 Claud' refused to unhook her, and kept tbagging, letting her get to stage two before a David came along to save her. Once 'Good Claud' was safe I killed the toxic one and decided just to farm with the remaining 3 players.
---
you didn't
---
Thats why i kind of tunnel Claudette players. If theyre wearing tan or something decently visible then i wont care as much, but if its the brown and green shirt, every time i actually see her, i will smack her down over the other survivors
---
I imagine in SWF you just need multiple people on multiple totems and hope that you find Thrill first.
---
I thought this was just a picture of stairs for like 30 seconds.
---
Bubba is currently drooling
---
Damn baby Megs
---
So the first perk is basically godly when doing a 3 gen start? Okay
---
LOL you can hardly see him
---
lol still on xbox it's like rb or lb
---
It's the same reason why people troll in any other game. If people didn't get pissed off about it and didn't give a damn, trolls would either stop or push further until someone does and perpetuates the cycle. Just talk about it to your friends and breathe it out, you still got bloodpoints!
---
i have it as well, could just be a visual bug?
---
So these will expire/become unequippable after the event, right? No point hoarding them?
---
Genuinely good idea, some balance changes I would recommend:
---
Instead of having his 2nd phase last 45 seconds, 30 would be enoug since by that time your 2nd perk should be activated so it would be much easier to demolish survivors with that speed boost and he should already have a big terror radius in chaser phase since he's meant to induce fear and encourage a chase and the loud footsteps are already a positional giveaway, though finding a survivor would be tough the 2nd phase would make it easier
---
First perk, you could change it to 15/20/25 sec of not being able to use those gens and the cooldown of 60 sec, the 80 second cooldown is too much especially since survivors are already discouraged from doing the gen due to the proposed larger terror radius and waiting it out wouldn't be too hard but it does slow the game down enough to tier up or activate the rest of his perks
---
Second perk is good maybe the chase could last 10 or 15 seconds because 20 seconds is a lot of time in a match unless you mean a total of 20 seconds rather than a single chase
---
Third perk is just kind of broken, suggested change would be the kill option isn't available until the survivor has been hooked or until a certain amount of generators have been complete, the demoralized affect is a great idea though
---
The doctor played himself on that one.
---
How to counter bt:
---
1: Hit the unhooker while or before he unhooks.
---
2: hit the unhooker again
---
3: hook the unhooker
---
4: repeat as necessary
---
Please for the love of god accept your daily rituals
---
Come back and hook her, PLEASE.
---
Just noticed it as well. I hope not
---
wait
---
Hope is massively underrated. I love me a hope adrenaline end game build.
---
But he can still block off doorways
---
I guess it's because as killer it's a 1v4? So more rewards for more work. I mean, if a team of 4 survivors carries 1 survivor that does nothing the whole game and that survivor gets lots of blood points, it'd be unfair for everyone.
---
mori\*
---
its only a farming event to you because you claim it is. its easy to get good bloodpoints and still have a good match. i'm just gonna play the game normally. i'm not gonna stop playing the game for 4 days because you have some made up rules.

if youre cloaked with wraith bt wont even activate bc it's based on terror radius
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Some survivors deserve it though. Had a P3 Dwight last night who would T bad and click his flashlight (not blind) at every pallet and vault. And then when I lost him would jump windows to get my attention. I will always leave after hooking but as soon as I got that Dwight I chainsaw facecamped him.
---
I play both sides, mainly Survivor, and both sides are as toxic as eachother.
---
'Ends in 2 days' I thought it might be a visual bug.
---
as someone who plays tapp this is true
---
am I the only one who enjoys going against legion?
---
Up to you if you wanna look at it that way. Be the godly righteous player you made yourself to be lol. Nobody even cares that you're good if your attitude's bad anyway.
---
I forgot to specify about kill orders, you need to hook the obsession twice. Third hook they'd be dead anyway.
---
Works like a ebony mori but without the offering.
---
Only this time it's USA online.
---
For a company that is based in Canada.
---
Canadian company outsources free work to USA. Lame.
---
If this sub has taught me anything it's that people seem to think the killer is a Game Master like in DnD and is therefore responsible for making sure everyone *else* has fun. As if the killer has full control of the game and the survivors have none.
---
wait are you able to use these outside of events because that'd be juicy curing the next double bloodpoints
---
"HERE COMES THE TRAPPER!"
---
Game of Tag too
---
This is the best one I've seen so far. I'd get it just for the sweet jacket
---
Time to do what I do best... Immerse myself into the surroundings and rack up bloodpoints lol
---
I get exactly what you mean. So many people play as her so not all of them can be 'toxic' or a bad team player, but a good few of them are.
---
I think the Claudette's that are usually on my team are trying to help, but they usually get me killed. They'll save me off the hook like 5 seconds after I'm put on it, but the killer will just tunnel me because they can't see her.
---
That sounds sad, I hate it when people let you go into second state. I'm glad you got the toxic one
---
Sometimes I won't see her til the very end, or only find her because of bbq. My best buddy uses her because of her camo aspect. I like Nea because of her cosmetics, so I feel you on that. Anyway I'm a killer main and I just play survivor here and there
---
Adam if you include hair imo
---
I assume so, which is unfortunate
---
You haven't seen good killers then.
---
How about an ice pick?
---
Hit  
---
the  
---
unhooker.
---
He probably hasn't played against someone who effectively uses their tier 1 to gen grab someone at the beginning of the match or scratched mirror yet.
---
righteous? mate i just want to play the game normally thats not having a bad attitude
---
Pleaseeee don't be a glitch, a longer bloodhunt would be nice
---
Omg, my ps4 is yet not back from repair, this sucks
---
Along with some of the other suggestions in the comments I like the idea mainly cause I'm a big Resident Evil fan. His Mori has to be his one handed head crush lol. And if the survivor that comes with him isn't Claire then I want no part of it. Unless u give the survivor skins like legion got. We could have Leon, Claire and Ada, maybe hunk lol
---
Yeah that would be a better name for you, Fuck Up.
---
Trapper's got no time for thots.

*has flashback to Re4*
---
That quote causes PTSD lol. But idm the perk names, either way they would be shared xD. 
---
What about a perk called Last Escape that after u heal a total of 3/4/5 heal states of other players u get a free insta-heal and can activate it in any health state but only on ur last hook, hence the name. Then the icon can be a picture of a first aid spray
---
Why do that if I could help the team by recovering which is a core aspect of the game
---
1.) Blind Guess: Your ability to track down survivors is uncanny, as the entity has given you an edge over your prey. You become Obsessed with one survivor. At the start of the match, two rushed actions are revealed to you. One will be a false action and one will be the location of the obsession. Upon being placed into the dying state, your obsession will suffer from the hemorrhage status effect at all times in the dying state only.  
---
2.) Vibrations: Your gaze is truly menacing, terrifying even the most hardened of survivors. While in a chase, the rushed actions of survivors you are directly looking at are reduced by 3/6/9%. If a survivor performs a rushed action while in your terror radius, the sound emitted by that action will be reduced by 100%/75%/50%
---
Aw, I was gonna make my Mr X concept soon.
---
&gt; There should be no reason why you should be disconnecting more than 5 times a week, let alone 15 times a month. 
---
Less than once a day... And some players play like 4-6 hours a day. This will end well, considering how stable DbD is.
---
Exactly, it makes you feel so mischievous when you play killers like that haha. Especially against new players. I don't play killer too often but when I do I play huntress. This has meant I stay around rank 20-18, and I play against new players. My god the amount of times people throw pallets down when I throw a hatchet, or they run into a locker, or they hide in corners, or they EVEN run in a straight line and go nowhere. I almost feel bad for them.
---
Just play survivor if you enjoy that more. You still make a good amount of bloodpoints.
---
That's one of the reasons I think her cosmetics should be made a bit brighter. Even as a survivor, I don't see a lot of them until I've died and I'm spectating them.
---
I don't have an issue with people that play Claudette, I think it just gives a lot of people an excuse not to do any gens for the most part. I think it would just make it a bit fairer for killers, like you
---
Better than 20st.
---
Little kid is a bit mad that I'm new to a game you probably sweat at and jerk off to the female killers. I'm sorry dude that I made you have a little tantrum, it's probably past your bed time so I won't keep you up to late. But just for future advise, some people are new to games, and don't know everything straight away. If you kept reading, I actually understood having a 32m raidus makes you op. So next time, you read, you autistic mf.
---
Because you didn't played death garden yet
---
dude nobody lives on your shithole island, it's daytime in the real world where people know how to fucking read.
---
Sorry not my problem. You're the one having a breakdown dude. Go have your pills.
---
But if a survivor is getting objectives and managing to sneak around with the killer realising, it doesn't seem to be rewarded as highly as I would think it should be.
---
"I got y-..... Oh hell no!"
---
I am a decent rank, it just happens a lot. Alternatively, as you said people can be too altruistic (I'm purple rank) and it can just get you killed quick if the killer feels like tunneling
---
I usually let the last person escape, too, but it kinda gets annoying when you're rank 20 and you're playing with rank 10 survivors talking on teamspeak and looping you 24/7, sabotage crewing, hex luring and window spamming, not to mention the ultra rare dwights with self-care/sprint burst teachables and then you are forced to stay 10-20 minutes in the lobby because you're rank 20 'cuz of semi-tryhard survivors
---
but that's just a theory, a GAME theory
---
When are we not shafted?
---
ps4 is extended too
---
What did they do to MoM?
---
By let go I mean leave and requeue if you don't want to farm. You lose nothing, you get a fresh new game, and 90% chance it'll be with a bunch of tryhards and people that don't want to farm too. So you can't just let that 1 or 2 games where people want to farm go? It's like if you have a toy and your little brother asked to borrow it for 2mins and you'll have it for the next 24hours and you just told him fuck no it's your toy no one's getting shit even though you have like 20 other toys.
---
Or the 31th.

Shit hole island. Lol. You probably live in America, fat fuck. Like I said quit having a breakdown you failed abortion. I just don't bother reading much rules cause unlike you I couldn't give a rats ass.
---
I’d say a sharpened and beat up version of one of those shovel things that you use on a car when there’s snow on them, I forget what they’re called but I know they look kinda like a curved spatula but it gets snow off windows during the winter. Maybe that’d work?
---
But I need to level up for the teachable perks. I have hit a bit of a 'perk ceiling' at rank 10ish. 
---
To get those good teachable perks, I just find it easier to play killer and farm BP. Just wish survivors got a bit more BP on average, to make it a parity.
---
People can't read...
---
I think her 'camouflage' gives players an excuse not to do gens, that's what can be annoying. 
---
Fair enough mate, somebody else said that earlier too

If you dc you shouldn’t be allowed to queue for a new game until the one in progress finishes.
---
Friendly reminder that [this](https://youtu.be/MiLtlP0opbw?t=314) exists.

That’s just because the killer was bad... she had so many opportunities to pick you up but didn’t.

---
lol sure thing kiddo
---
Beat 1nd
---
It comes off rather snobbish when that isn't their intention or focus
---
You want to play the game normally but you want others to play it normally too because that's the right way. So yea, righteous in some sense. You don't have a bad attitude for wanting to play the right way, the bad attitude is telling people off for not playing the right way when they do majority of the time but just want some points for a few days.
---
You know you can crouch over traps right? There's no excuse for NOT spotting trapper traps on Game. At least Hag traps are low profile and harder to see.
---
Yes, I can read. But I didn't check the rules cause couldn't be fucked. I hope you sleep well tonight obsessing over one comment that triggered your already unstable brain buddy
---
Looping doesn't prevent the killer from playing. There is only one thing survivors can do to prevent a killer from playing at all, and that is join swf, get on comms, and never let the killer find anyone.
---
3st
---
Is it weird that I want the weapon to be an icicle instead for a more "stabby" feel?
---
lol "ur mean to me so u must b crazy!!!!" imagine being 13 again
---
Why run Ruin on Nurse though?
---
just take this post down unless you’re trolling lol
---
Mine still says ends in 4 hours. Maybe if I restart the game.
---
That's a good way to do it
---
I'd rather be taken out of games where teammates farm me. Chances are, they aren't good, so it saves me from having to play with them.
---
Looping straight up ruins the game. And it does prevent you from playing, as they take a long time, which is just you walking towards a survivor until you can hit them. Sure, killers like Hag, Nurse and Spirit change it up, but I don't find them fun. Looping is boring as hell to fight, and it does prevent me from playing because my only option is to continue the loop or leave it. And if I leave them, thats one less hook for me. And again, looping isn't toxic.
---
Nice
---
Well shit, the more you know. Still ridiculous, had 3 survivors in my lobby for over 5 minutes now, guess ill play survivor. Any reason given for extending the time?
---
As survivor main that's my favorite place on the game lol
---
Getting chased? Head for the corn

Killer queues are always suffering on events. And if double BP extension is true, they'll be impossible to get with GF release.
---
The jackets are a great idea
---
I'm struggling to think of a killer that wouldn't do well on this map.
---
Same, spent several Million Points thanks to the event and jus last night before I had to sleep for work today, managed to get the last couple hundred thousand to reach cap again.
---
Cries in huntress
---
Well killers can’t keep their add ons. So I guess they just need more bloodpoints. Survivors can escape with items and even find items during games. 
---
I just think you shouldn’t play killer if you don’t enjoy it. I tried it when I started and I eventually stopped playing for a while. Just don’t want the same thing to happen to you.
---
It’s a reference
---
Yeah, that's exactly what I meant about people being excessively altruistic. And while I agree that some killers tunnel, I think that more often than not it's just the survivors team fault for instant saving or doing some unecessary risky saves while the killer is still around. Something that happens quite a lot in the higher ranks.
---
I so want this outfit for Meg, or Nea xD
---
I only clicked cuz it reminded me of a song lol
---
Base kit Nurse, no add-ons, no game slowing perks - still not fair? I mean, probably. But not vs a typical green rank killer (i.e. not god-tier player)
---
"Can't we all just have fun and NOT play the game we bought and downloaded lolll?"
---
Farming isn't fun, but apparently that's an objectively incorrect opinion to hold.
---
I occasionally use it on my Myers build, pretty effective with Tier 3 :P doubly so with Infinite T3
---
But that still means that we won’t have 4 *FULL* chapters. A full chapter is a surviver, killer, AND map.
---
Yup
---
This is wonderful. Love the music too
---
Umm, no u can't lol
---
Fucks sake dude chill the fuck out.
---
You don't need to be a god-tier Nurse; she's the most bullshit killer in the game.

Its actually from srgrafo if anyone cares

THEY brought the BPS, so they can do whatever the hell they want, just because there was more than 2 doesn't mean they're obligated to farm with you lol

Ok... so 115% speed killer with 3 Play With Your Food tokens, bloodlust 3 _*AND*_ running with the chainsaw. Dude about to tear space and time with that speed.

Is there any official conformation ? I feel like maybe its a bug saying 2 days ?
---
A longer bloodhunt would be pretty fucking great.

I just checked on PC and it says 2 days now as well... hmm.

Aye, waiting for 10 to 15 minutes, and then someone DCs... For the last few days I just played Rimworld, or watched Netflix on the 2nd screen. x_x

15-30 minute ban

I’ve never seen this from survivor point of view but it’s great either way

Maybe because the Xbox got delayed.

---
Meh. Corn blindness is a real thing
---
It feels much better than using the mouse; it makes for more control and consistent curves.
---
Sadly US only :/
---
What bothers me more is that people need to play 15 matches within 6 hours. That makes 6*60/15 = 24 minutes per match **INCLUDING matchmaking**.
---
With the current 10+ minutes waiting time to find a lobby (as killer) to then immediatly get back to menu because someone somehow was kicked out of the match... You better gotta be fast...
---
Or maybe the "reward" is just a bait and no one will be able to get it :D
---
I played the map yesterday, there's still rooms that require gen completion before there's more than one exit. Also, completely safe pallets? There's the corridor near the basement and the tables near the movie room drop down that are "completely safe". The rest of pallets are only safe from certain directions (so any good killer can shut that down), or they're in the middle of shelves, or between pillars and are about as safe as the pallets on carnival map (not safe at all).
---
Ok. Thanks.
---
Seeing Ghostface's bloody mask peeking at you from around a corner will be eerie.

---
no, not that much, you still can see as much as before, the effect is just at the edges
---
get rekt lmao
---
Playing Killer makes you a better killer and survivor whereas playing survivor only makes you a better survivor
---
Corn-blindness isn't much of a problem once you know what to look for.
---
Ah, thank you
---
Also is ghost face releasing in about 4 or 5 hours?
---
Ironically enough, Huntress will now be more susceptible to the perk than she was before.
---
Anyway, first metagame-relevant survivor perk to be released in about two years will now not be metagame-relevant anymore. I would refund Ash if I could, and will refrain from buying new characters with anything but Shards. Which probably means I'm skipping on Ghostface. His gameplay is nothing new or exciting and he has awful perks, anyway.
---
thank mr screamor
---
I would love for them to extend it. I need to level up my Ash... currently trying to get all my perks sorted out for my Feng.
---
Lol if this was a bug the devs would push out a hotfix faster than you can say "BP economy"

One time I was being chased by a hillbilly, fully health, he started to revv his chainsaw when suddenly someone cleansed his fucking haunted grounds, then he cancelled the m2 to m1 me
---
Nice!!!
---
Hmm I don't agree with that either. Usually it's the killer's decision, but there's no SHOULD either. Which is why I don't see killers as bad or something when they don't wanna farm. If they don't want to farm, I just go back to normal gameplay. It's tough on killer because killer needs to figure out who wants to farm and who doesn't if he himself wants to farm, but for survivors it's just yes or no.
---
at least nobody is gonna use a mori
---
Honestly this is a bitch to do. I saved 30ish iridescents for this trophy. And even then it took me a few months of playing. I definitely recommend BBQ with it as well. It’s cheeky as fuck but the chances of downing someone from that far away is so slim, iridescents are almost a requirement.
---
Both sides do it. It's an individual problem. But killers are in this position where once they catch someone, there's very little that person can do if they decide to stand in their face. 
---
I'm talking about the people who go out of their way to be a shitbag for no reason other than 'why not'.
---
Welp... She is a thot and shes begging for attention but i would fuck her anyways

Ok

What are they?

nah

Safe Unhooks as well

Depends on your console and stuff. 2 pm is an estimate, but it'll probably be when the store resets for PlayStation, anywhere from 11 to 2ish

Still have the animation time of the survivor being taken by the entity.

He’s just a dumb dumb.

---
seeing the same thing 6 times is annoying tho. search for some keywords using the search option above before posting something about some news cuz damn something drops and reddit free karma farmers just spam the fuck out of it
---
I do agree that the community is shit, but to say these guys need a nerf when a couple you mentioned are the weakest killers in game is just silly. There are FAR better killers out there than these ones who might need a nerf. Ever played against a good nurse or Hilbilly? They are painful to go against compared to a Legion.
---
Is this photoshopped? I can't think of why we would get 2x BP bloodhunt only to be completely outclassed by a potential 5x BP event right after...
---
No, I have. I just don’t speak like a character from game of thrones or some fantasy shiz
---
Obvious question but have you tried reinstall/rebuild database
---
i love when people try to be toxic but it backfires lol, like once i had a toxic 3 swf game against me a lvl1 freddy with no add ons and 1 perk (lvl1 Blood warden)
---
i killed 1 of them, the random left and the claudette wanted my attention even though the door was open so she ran inside and i went after her, after the first hit she went for the door but i cut her off and hooked her (3rd hook so she died) her other friend instead of being a decent human he wanted to come in front of the hook to tbag and then ran to the gate t bagging but he got hit with the BW so he went inside and i got my first hit and eventually downed him and made him crawl to the door only to be killed by the entity :) paybacks a bitch
---
Keys Bakoom
---
I play it on Xbox and there’s still people playing it, I think it’s worth it but that’s personal opinion. Isn’t it on game pass at the minute too and you can buy that for a pound at the minute?
---
Leaving when hearing the terror radius.
---
The game is the worst map for trapper? Is this guy high?
---
who is the person playing with the squid? i see this posted often
---
It’s very fun playing with friends and solo! I’ve been playing on Xbox since 2017 and it’s my favorite game
---
He is a licensed survivor, and none of his perks are really must-haves, so a lot of people might have just not bought him.
---
Thank you! I am not really good with dark tones, so this "haunted vibe" was super challenging for me.
---
It's fun to play with friends, and its fun to play killer solo. The price is great, and totally worth it, but I warn You, this game isn't for everyone. Some people try it and say eff that. If you do plan on getting it, and diving deep into it, you are gonna have to learn a descent curve in the beginning before you start doing well. You are also gonna have to look at outside help for learning how to play because the game doesn't explain much at all. I play on ps4 and its totally filled with people, I can't say for Xbox but uve heard the same :)
---
Can't wait to use 1m points on GF then still farm after. Neato.
---
Oh my gosh... that would be totally hilarious!
---
But they still go down eventually. Something like 90% of chases end with the survivor going down. Its all about delaying that hook to buy time.  Its pretty rare that a killer gives up to chase someone else (which is the right move a lot of the time ) and even rarer that you just lose the killer. You can be an amazing survivor but still get hooked.
---
Ok, you have a point there.
---
That one prestige bug, I've never seen anything hotfixed so fast in my life.
---
3x?  Unless you're bringing instaheals or something, it's unrealistic to be able to to do that 3x in anything but an extremely rare game.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Whoa! I really appreciate it
---
BRUUUUUUH!!!
---
Only downvoted becuz 420 points. Sorry
---
Exactly the changes i would like to see on Trapper.
---
*mischevious oinks* &gt;:)
---
I said I don't care about survivor so I dont cleanse totems because I didn't care about noed, which a lot of people seem to. I cared about killer which is why I wasted my time juggling and slugging.
---
Considering I saw this on PC.... no.
---
It’s so easy to tell when someone is doing this because you’ll only hear one blink the entire game and then no sign of the killer. Also, the nurse is super fucking loud lol
---
[Streamer](https://www.twitch.tv/marikutv)
---
Maybe this has something to do with how Xbox players couldn’t play the event for half the first day?
---
Trappers traps should just Respawn on him over time, like a couple seconds. His ability is so underwhelming and he has to waste so much time collecting traps. Plus there are 2 different perks that directly counter his traps. He should get a max amount of traps increase to 2, at least, and not have to collect them at all
---
I would make small quality of life changes instead: Trapper starts with 2 traps in base kit, 3 with brown addon and 4 with yellow one. And also give the option to rearm traps on the floor without having to pic them up first.
---
They scratched that because it was still too easy to get. MoM meta is over in a few hours.
---
Why?
---
It's good because you can trap a lots of narrow places, dropdowns and the stairs near the cistern. The thing is, the only really reliable placement is the cistern stairs, others will get disabled if somebody casually walks there in a stealth mode. Also, the basement sucks on this map, and it's one of the stronger sides of Trapper. 
---
I would say Gideon is a very rewarding map for Trapper when it works. But it definitely won't work every time.
---
People were basing that on when the Bloodhunt ended, but it seems to have been extended by 2 days. Thus, it could release at 11am EST!
---
Wait times for survivors and killers are shit right now on PS4, guess it’s the new ghost face chapter messing with the servers
---
The all the pallets that are safe regardless of the side:
---
-The ones that spawn below any stairway
---
-The ones that spawn above the corner stairways
---
-The two near the exit gates
---
-The "regular" pallet tile that always spawns downstairs
---
-The ones above and by the basement
---
-The one's that spawn in a drop down
---
The pallets that are unsafe:
---
-The one below the silo vault, still takes bloodlust to mindgame
---
-The one by a truck downstairs.
---
Some barrel loops
---
-Semi safe pallets: the ones that spawn above stairways with crates. High risk high reward for the killer.
---
-The non-see through pallets upstairs. Again, ifthe killer guesses wrong, you can run to the next safepallet
---
If you think any other pallets are unsafe, you must practise running them, and the deadends are fixed, but the doors can sometimes be really hard to find
---
Is it not?
---
Thanks for bringing these posts to my attention. While it's true they've already done the maths, with my post I can continually update the results to reflect future updates.
---
Do you really see them that often? This event I just went through 2 prestiges on Ash and got maybe 3-4 bps total
---
Sword &amp; Shield are cutting a lot of pokemon to save space in the game to make animations smoother
---
He isn’t asking anything, just bringing something up.
---
I really wish we had a more stealth focused game mode where generators aren’t the objective but avoiding the killer is the most focused point, like staying alive against a timer.
---
Ohhhhhh
---
I play on Xbox primarily and there's always people on. The killer lobbies have been a bit slow to populate with the double points event on (killers generally get more points than survivors) but double points ends today so you should still find games quickly. I have no problem finding survivor lobbies.
---
There's two floors and a limited number of traps, along with many safe pallets and no way to conceal traps. It's actually an awful map for trapper comparison to others maps.
---
Nothing a killer can do is toxic unless they are deliberately holding the game hostage by keeping you stuck somewhere.
---
Lucky you
---
The game is more than worth it. Some people have already played it for thousands of hours.  The majority of the Killers play quite differently from each other which helps keep the game from being stale.
---
As a consumer, I really appreciate it if you do keep the community reminded! Thanks!
---
Y tho
---
Can confirm, I'm a killer main and I'm gonna sit there and wait to play GF. I'm not gonna give in and play survivor like I did this weekend :p
---
Ah you made him look more like a camper now, Good Job!
---
Usually updates for many game devs on console are around 11am-12pm PST on Tuesday’s.
---
This happened to me as Ash too but Mettle of Man activated when she hit me and I got out lol.
---
It's bad for Huntress. But to be honest, half of the maps roster is bad for Huntress.
---
On all platforms?
---
MoM also is getting nerfed.
---
Three hours left. I hope all platforms get it at the same time because I don't want to wait another week to get him. Have 1 Million bloodpoints saved up for him
---
700+ hours on Xbox, definitely worth it. 
---
It is on GamePass right now and I highly suggest hopping on the GamePass Ultimate deal to get it before the deal expires.
---
Jukes in tall grass, that looked so difficult! I'm gonna have to watch a tutorial and see how he did it :p
---
It's not a bug it's s "Feature".
---
It just works.
---
It’s temporarily lol
---
hey one of those claudette’s are me
---
If u listen closely.... you can hear his game uninstalling
---
at least I know that you actually cheched. now do that every time you want to post some shit that's recent, because you probably didn't win the "first" race
---
Switching to Geico could help you down 15% more Survivors.
---
*So easy a totem can do it.*
---
Theres quite a few on xbox that play. I think its a larger playerbase than PS4
---
&gt; \-The two near the exit gates 
---
These are the ones I was mainly talking about when it came to directionally safe. I think it depends what your definition of safe is, but I don't consider a pallet safe if I can't get away whilst it's being destroyed. If the killer breaks either of these exit gate pallets whilst facing the doors, you're getting hit pretty soon after. That's what I meant when I said you have to run them a certain way. 
---
I could be wrong. It just doesn't feel like a very survivor-sided map, even after that update.
---
Maps aren't bad for huntress, non-dedicated servers and phantom geometry hitboxes are bad for huntress.
---
Proud of you sacrificing yourself, have a upvote to compensate for the blood points
---
And what exactly am i supposed to do with this information?
---
P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney*
---
Have you tried mailing them?
---
Good idea fam ill try again
---
We are but we are fabulous!
---
I have no idea. I came here for advice because I want my legacy back
---
Wow, i was gonna say the same thing too!
---
Can Rin do that with me pls
---
Leaving when match loads
---
I still consider them safe as they can still stall a lot. I recommend playing it a bit more, maybe use some offerings, because some pallets can be hard to find unless you know where to look. Trust me, there is no way you'll lose against a m1killer on that map, if you know how to run the map
---
Damn he's arriving late. I didn't see this post so when i woke up at 4am this morning I was trying to get all the new updates and DLC for Mortal Kombat 11, Jurassic World Evolution, and Dead by Daylight so the games would be ready later and the download wouldn't affect play time when I'm home.
---
That makes no sense, why should he pin his mistake on the map. It wouldn't matter which map this scenario played out on. The result would be the same. He probably just try harded the whole game 'cause he thought the map sucks for him, hence his response. I don't know why you'd interpret as him blaming the map for his fuck up there. Can't judge a comment he made on 15 seconds of gameplay footage, when his statement isn't 100% clear. It would be different if he said "you escaped just because of the map", but he didn't. So what makes you think he meant that fuck up in the end there?
---
This happened to me last night with Legion, I feel the good feels.

Burn it so it won’t self heal
---
Not necessarily. The michael i played against entered tier 3 a few times but apparently never managed to instakill anyone and downed them instead.
---
Don't forget us ps4 players too :)
---
I watch Scott, seeing people have like 120fps with no frame drops and like 30 ping just makes me mind blown
---
The devs said the matchmaking is the exact same. It just doesn’t put you into a lobby until you actually find a Survivor.
---
Can't the same thing be said about survivors then? That logically applies to both sides.
---
Removed- No support posts
---
We're not BHVR. We cannot help you.
---
Thank God I need more of a chance with all the shitplayers, DC's, and long lobby wait times for matches
---
Also fucking rare as idk what, and one time use unless add on. So it wouldn't be that OP.
---
I hope they do something about it soon. I’m constantly loading into a three man lobby that never gains a fourth survivor and it’s pretty irritating
---
he didn't want her to get pressure points (250 points for being alive in the endgame) /s
---
They were shit all weekend so i doubt that.
---
Nah I think that's too far of a conspiracy theory
---
In what way? Can't you accept one, then do another one and have it ready? 
---
Doesn't it only make sense to save them when you're at 1,000,000 BP already?
---
Hey. ;)
---
Michael in the distance or around the corner is still an eerie sight to me
---
And for the killer there is no other goal then to hook/kill survivors. And what do you even mean by killers "win either way"? The killer never wins per se, although a sacrifice of at least 2 people is usually counted as a "win".
---
She's such a cute chick, everything says "love me" about her.
---
all accurate
---
Hows about you mind your own business and ill do what i want ? Pipe down little boy
---
It was really bad yesterday too
---
Imposter! Someone clearly stole Myers' mask. Look at how tiny and skinny he is, a true Myers wouldn't even fit inside of a locker. You cannot fool me.
---
(Imagine this with a ''Like a Sir'' voice tvm)
---
I hate the hag only because it forces your camera to look at her and when you're on console is almost impossible to not get cucked because of it
---
Yeah, i dont know what i was thinking
---
Yup.
---
I really don't like claudette. She's fine as a starting character but other than that I hate her
---
Reminds me of S3 of Slasher, just a different color
---
The one with his own theme song- Here comes the trapper..
---
But they are playing the game as intended. That is not being an asshole. There is no rule against it, it's not an exploit, it's not scummy, it's just as it is. It's the game, the baseline. Everything else that you "expect" be it from survivors or killers, is a potential "maybe", but in no way something that should be taken for granted. That's called entitlement.
---
Me last night: "Fuck it I don't care enough to grind so hard just to level Jane up to 40 so I can get all of the Survivors' teachables and work on prestiging them."
---
This morning: "Ah shit, here we go again."
---
Well, I guess you could say it's started a discussion......maybe not about the content of the post, but we're certainly having a discussion on *something*.
---
Leaving when you load up the game and see the killer watching the survivors
---
Dude nurse should not be able to do that!
---
more important, Why is Sidney ?
---
I say the same of some killers main said long ago, *"good luck with queue times".*
---
I hope you don't speak about Leaving the match through ESC menu and only try punish the Disconnects.
---
Devs are working on making DCs punishment to work, dedicated servers will end this. Because now, a killer can intencionally drop the connection of a survivor and make the survivor take the punishment, yeah thats one of reasons on why they aren't ban everyone.
---
*le gasp* this actually gives me a chance to get enough points for Ghostdad-... Face. Ghostface.
---
I had a stroke reading this, check that grammar next time
---
Thank God someone else sees her as huntress 2.0. It's like legion and huntress had a baby. Then Freddy was on the side because all plagues have the stupid thantphobia perk/debuff.
---
This is too overpowered
---
I always get survivors on the stairs.
---
I mean, when you play enough, 300k isn't hard to get.  
---
  
---
You get 1 mil, then get ghostface, then spend 1 mil, then finish the dailies for that much extra BP to put in GF before you play him, in a vain attempt to get the few good killer perks out of the massive pile of garbage.
---
You could tap it every time and he wouldn't notice it lol.
---
Nothing more unnerving then to be running Alert and not see anything when it triggers.
---
Thank goodness. I had to work for most of the blood hunt
---
I love the design of the Outfit, it's bloody amazing!
---
It’s on Gamepass which you can get a month of for $1, you could try it out that way if you wanted.
---
😜
---
Reminds me a lot of tag as well
---
Right!
---
This one 100% deserved a t-bagging.
---
I'm a killer main and find exit gate t-bagging pretty obnoxious, but if I pulled this and this happened, I'd stand there and take it like a man because I deserved it.
---
I think its 5PM CET.. every update is like that
---
So because people don’t agree with your asinine points they must therefore be salty? Killers are supposed to see who they are going against so they can have time to adjust their load outs before hand based on characters selected and items brought.
---
says chapter here:  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/55383/ash-vs-evil-dead-chapter-release](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/55383/ash-vs-evil-dead-chapter-release)
---
if you just tap it, it doesn't make noise?
---
Leaving after pallet stunning a killer
---
got the Patch Notes for that?
---
It is a pretty great build that does work consistently enough to be viable, and notably it does so especially against the two killers you direly need the help of perks against (namely, Nurse and Spirit), but indeed Iron Will is needed here to make stealth-jukes work also while injured. Practice other types of stealth-jukes too, in order not to become too much of a one-trick-pony with the Lithe + Dance With Me play.
---
Until you see 2 teammates go down in 10 seconds. Then you just run around setting off traps because you know you are not going to escape anyway. So might as well annoy her with notifications lol.
---
The real question is what kind of guitar?
---
I was gonna grind to 1kk since I had 900k points to expend on ghosty, but now? Heck yeah I will P3 another killer
---
2000 hours on Xbox and I’ve seen several people with a lot more than that.  It’s on gamepass right now, so I’d recommend that route.
---
lol what a fucking chump am I right
---
Expecting people to play the game and rightfully pointing out certain behavior is prohibited by the rules and can get you suspended
---
You know, factually pointing that out backed up by so far two responses from the support desk
---
He so mad lmao
---
it stops the regressing and the sparkles. But that Billy was so blind that he wouldn't notice.
---
Nah they just changed it, it's still pretty good. It activates even when at full health now.
---
I’ve been sat here with my Xbox dead by daylight staring at the trapper while it searches for a match for 30 minutes.
---
What’s the big secret?
---
He sounds good, but he really isn't. His power is good at downing multiple survivors. This however requires them to be grouped up,Now I don't know if you played in high ranks but that'll never happen. When he charges his chainsaw he becomes insanely slower, which does not let him chainsaw bait at pallets like Billy, and he needs to be right behind the survivor to actually down them. The only things he's good at are camping and basements. Camping for one is super frowned upon, unfun for both and does not give you any points. Basements are extremely rare to put someone in, and you need to be running agitation and iron grasp if you want more basement hooks.
---
Overall he's basically an m1 killer who can occasionally insta down survivors.
---
“Can’t wait to catch the Dwight” *opens locker* “Okay, what the fuck?”
---
I can hear the trapper screaming
---
45 seconds is too long, let me throw more pebbles now BHVR
---
wtf? you right but why is that a chapter?
---
LF is basically a 5$ BBQ pack
---
nice
---
Okay, then maybe I’m just bad at running it.
---
Somebody overplayed Last year...
---
Yeah, it takes some time to get lobbies. I'm pretty sure this is due to double BP event and people want to grind up ASAP before GF release. Kinda funny because it takes 5-10 minutes before you get into the game whereas if you play as the survivor you could technically play 2 games in that time frame that it takes to get into the game as the killer. Still, I have 2 more dailies for the killer then after that, I'm binging survivor with some people from DBD official discord channel.
---
If it didn't work no one would do it, yes I'm sure dear Redditor that reads this comment with your 2000 hours, I'm sure you're the model player, everyone else tho feels the need to prove a point, and go for the hook game, you don't even need ruin they just will ignore all gens, it's terrible
---
I’ve lost so many flashlights, it hurts.
---
No, all platforms.
---
Small game is meant to be that percent per totem on the map, like a direct counter to Thrill. I forgot to mention that.
---
The Slippery Meat change was originally 1:1, but I thought it would be too much. After looking at it once again, I agree. Also Left Behind I spent too long trying to figure values and I wasn't even confident then. It's still a shit perk and I don't know how to fix that. 
---
Thanks for the feedback
---
Are you going to edit this reply to admit you were wrong in order to avoid spreading disinformation, possibly getting people suspended or banned because they chose to believe your baseless assertions? Or are you going to let the factual truth remain buried at the end of a ludicrously long comment chain that's downvoted to hell?
---
I'm laughing so fucking hard at this comment holy shit. If I could gild you I would.
---
I can confirm that it is official.
---
Adept Ghostface and something involving his power. Idk the 3rd one.
---
This whole event was screwed up because of the rank reset. Too many tryhards desperate to get back into the red ranks. I swear every survivor group I played against were immersed t-bagging flashlight spammers, and most killers were camping with insidious. It was just a very toxic and unpleasant environment.
---
Same goes for flasglighting pallet tagging cunt survivors.....
---
if you want, we can speak on my native language.
---
Whats that?
---
Haha a Fender Jaguar Blacktop. Got a great deal on it. Started playing in July and now I’ve gotten pretty solid, can even sing and play a few songs. It was a great decision. Do you play?
---
r/subsifellfor
---
Lol roger that. You’re probably right.
---
Fair enough. I used her at the beginning, but when I got used to the game I went on to other survivors
---
Oooh, he can, my friend, he can... But I don't think I should show what I did with his original model in that locker..! XD
---
Sprint bursted away at the first nanosecond of the explosion like a true meg
---
Why what? Why did the devs design the game the way they did, or why do people not agree with you?
---
Killers get more points for a number of reasons but a large part of it that many people overlook is that survivors can reuse items and add ons. If you survive the game with your item, you can use it again in the next game. Killers don't have that option. Also, survivors don't need to even bring items to the game, they can search a chest to get an item, and even without that survivors can do really well without any items to help them whereas, especially at red ranks, a killer without add ons will get punished. Furthermore, killers have more useless stuff on the bloodweb than survivors. There are plenty of add ons that killers won't ever use but they have to put points into just to progress through the bloodweb. Most survivor items and add ons are at least somewhat helpful, except maybe the Brown map add ons and broken keys.
---
I love it and hate it at the same time. I love it because it helps you deal with campers but I hate it because it also rewards those who just dive at the hook. Gives them a second chance which encourages them to keep doing it instead of getting punished and realizing that "Hey, maybe barreling down on a freshly hooked survivor isn't a good idea"
---
I don't understand why some killers do this. I mean even if you were like the most TOXIC survivor, why drop you down to go and close the hatch? Just hook the survivor and be done or if you feel like it, give them the hatch. Sometimes it's the best to give toxic players the hatch, like here you go even with your toxicity I still let you go.
---
I main killer and I never do this closing the hatch on a dying state survivor.
---
1450 and same,as well as playing against him
---
Then you get only bullshit perks and have to grind it out anyway. Time to make them scream as the doctor.
---
Same but also grateful...also feeling the comedown of being up all night grinding thinking this was it
---
:( I want 60 fps and good connection too
---
They took pallet looping out within the 3 days of you playing?
---
Probably wants to keep playing and getting blood points.
---
I think it's worth a shot. I've been playing since it released on Xbone and it's one of the few games I constantly come back too. Be patient at the beginning because there is a bit of a learning curve. Don't beat yourself up too badly when you fuck up and learn from your mistakes. Once you figure it all out and find your groove, it really is a blast!
---
I wanna do that but im afraid i would be salty messages form survivors for “camping” the exit gate lmao
---
I thought the same thing.  Even top level survivors very *very* rarely go an entire match without getting hooked at all if they're against a competent killer.  
---
If everyone was absolutely perfect at the game, there would be almost no reason for most of the perks that exist.  
---
I main killer and I have zero issues with Borrowed Time.  Whenever I see a Bill unhooking, I just assume he's running it, and with every other survivor I just aim not to tunnel.  I can hardly think of a time I lost a match because of some clutch BT play though.
---
It's almost like that's his job..
---
Facecamping is never okay. It's just toxic and mean.
---
I watched Tru3 play with the new MoM, seems to work pretty good still. Even if it's a nerf, it's not too big it seems. But of course we'll never know till we get our hands on it.
---
It’s mostly based off how most killer achievements are. Adept, using your power X amount of times and something wacky involving the character, usually. GF’s third one may be something like marking people while on chase with someone else or downing someone while chasing someone else, idk.
---
oh boy
---
Why would they leak the chapter when the new one comes out?
---
Unless they changed it it's in the ballpark of 4-5 million bp
---
Yah was able to play 2 killer matches but I knew that allot of people have been on playing killer and then around 10pm est the wait times for playing survivor went to shit. It’s about 10min wait and yah either I load in to a 3 man lobby or by myself and then slowly someone might come in. BhVR has new chapter and 3 year anniversary event dumping today so the servers are probably sweaty!
---
That was done perfectly 👏🏼
---
Only the black jacket ones. Vest Tapps, you'll never not see them.
---
In regards to the characters it allows you know which perks they can bring for sure. Bill always has the possibility to have borrowed time, Laurie may have ds, etc. If they bring flashlights then bringing lightborn and franklin’s demise is a good idea. It opens up the possibility to counter play. If they all have tool boxes then ruin and surveillance can be invaluable.
---
:P
---
Might be pretty cool if bhvr did a high techy chapter and added this as an idea
---
If you're worried about karma just upload an image of shirtless Myers or tongue ghost face for free 1-3k karma points.
---
I like the cut of your jib.
---
But roar dude
---
&gt;Well that's on you being selfish
---
No, not really. You have to understand that the player wanting to play the game is 100% in the right by the rules and in the eyes of the developers who enforce these rules. Farming is classified as Unsportsmanlike behavior and can get you reported and suspended if you annoy enough people with it.
---
Wanting to play the game is not selfish.
---
Wanting to play the game is not entitled.
---
If you join a public match in an online PVP game wanting to do anything other than playing the game
---
You are in the wrong.
---
That shouldn't be disputed or controversial in any way if you look at it rationally.
---
I actually didn't know Ghostface was supposed to come out today lol. My assumption was they could claim them, and do more dailies tomorrow such that when he does come out, they'd have 3 ready.
---
You are gold
---
Just kill them off
---
I mean if you know the killer is nearby and your still silly enough to run away from the hook leaving scratch marks aaaaaaaaaaa
---
this is scarily accurate
---
The 2x BP also inflates that number
---
I agree, why would you do that and hurt the community lmao
---
Maybe not because perks like bond also dont effect distortion
---
Yes
---
I was loading into games within a minute or two over the weekend I’m bummed to go into long waits yet again
---
Almost certainly the same as Leatherface did.
---
billy
---
Yep yep!
---
5 bucks? I believe that's what I paid for leatherface.
---
It's balanced out by the fact you spend half as much time playing the game between the queues /s

Yea i feel like there should be many more items so survivor games can offer more variety
---
If you have YouTube pulled up on the Steam overlay, you can try.
---
it happened with plague leaking Ash, and in the mid chapter oatch they leaked GF
---
Ty I like the hair idea tho reminds me of a female villain in inuyasha ^^
---
Spookyboi, we can't wait to try you on console!
---
No. All platforms.
---
This must be a newer survivor stereotype.  I play Claudette and run the same tryhard perks on her that I do my other survivors and play my matches like I would any other survivor.  But I'm always seeing how she's a do-nothing hidey girl.  
---
I eventually saw so much hatred for her that I've intentionally started prestiging her to P3 out of spite.
---
Honestly love people who follow you around with their flashlight either to get your attention or to try and save their downed teammate which never works lmao. Just one less person not doing gens.
---
Should have gotten one way before Leeeegion lol
---
Pretty sure his job is to kill the survivors, which he failed at because he was greedy
---
&gt; Adjusted certain darker cosmetics that gave players an advantage to be lighter
---
RIP Squadettes

Why is everyone "oh no I think it's a bug"

#Important Developer Note
---
&gt; **UPCOMING HOTFIX PATCH**
---
&gt;
---
&gt; We have made some slight adjustments to Ghost Face following the second PTB. Unfortunately, they have not made it into the current patch but will be introduced in an upcoming hotfix in the near future. Thank you for your understanding.
---
Also I believe DBD often discounts their dlc during the anniversary event.
---
So um.... where’s the Freddy rework?
---
I wish I could get spirit, might save up some shards.
---
That is so true. I just do house chores while I queue. But maybe if survivors got a bit more BP, less people would queue killer? I would probably not queue killer as much, so someone could take my spot.
---
Hmm... wonder what they mean by ‘near future’
---
Ah that was scary
---
mid chapter patch
---
its on the mid chapter patch
---
Lucky, I didn't get a single party streamer while spending 1 million bloodpoints, I must have my luck stat on minimum.
---
- wears mask
---
- his name is still on the check
---
Until then, Myers has some Evil Within.
---
Devastated as I brought him today thinking he’d be better. Motherfuckers :’(
---
Finally, just had two killer games with 3 MoMs, such a fun perk!
---
Fucking wow that’s irritation at its best
---
Her IG name is belle.delphine.  
---
Honestly I follow a lot of IG cosplayers/lewd girls and she's so weird I actually had to unfollow her. Lmao.
---
Funny thing is he didn’t even fully kick it 😂
---
No it's the mask that's why it's a new guy behind it with a while new look except the mask
---
That’s not really their fault though, that’s when they said it would come during the anniversary reveal
---
People who DC when they get hit are pathetic.
---
Is this the first time the killer's mori has been shown in the spotlight? For those of you who might be avoiding mori animations don't watch this right to the very end.
---
I also play both sides but man I love when people assume things lol, as I said before I never stated NOED was fine, I never use it because I think it's a crutch ass perk just like old ds and old MoM.  But yes play the pity party of the omg I know I'm going to get downvoted...who gives a shit upvotes and downvotes dont matter you just put that in there to get the people who agree with you to upvote you so you dont look bad... and with bloodlust it was put into the game to eliminate infinite I have said in the past since most infinites are gone bloodlust should be removed....but again keep assuming you know how I feel or what I am going to say
---
Mid-chapter
---
Waiting a whole month and a half
---
Yes. I’ve deletes &amp; reinstalled twice. After the fourth time of this game causing my PS to overheat &amp; shut off, I decided to stop playing it. Idk what to do next.
---
But then we’ll start using these perks and then they wouldn’t be qualified as a low tier perk anymore
---
The event rewards were mostly good. The events themselves were mostly not. It was either themed hooks and generators, which does not change gameplay in any way, and at worst resulted in scenarios of survivors sabotaging event hooks (they then made that impossible) and killers guarding event gens, or it was collecting serum, which only introduced another hold-M1 element, adding nothing to the gameplay while creating fustrating situations where other survivors would "steal" serum and the killer destroy the plants, or you would die and get a setback in serum/not be able to fill your vial to begin with, and thus only be able to collect little in the next round, that round then feeling "wasted", in event terms.
---
Just saying their events were never spectacular or anything, so this "Bloody Party Streamer +3%" is a little funny if taken as an admission of as much, not even bothering with anything else. The seeming lack of event cosmetics is disappointing, since especially the blight cosmetics were indeed cool. Did not really care for the blight clips/lore, however.
---
Chasing a survivor is literally playing the game. Being downed before you have a chance to do anything after being unhooked isn't.
---
Come to think of it yes I do on my Killers but not on my Survivors.
---
I dont't have the best perks for him yet, but I do agree with you my pressure was bad
---
The community is 95% trash players who run stealth builds and can't loop to save their lives anyway
---
Is ghostface out?

---
Very happy to see that work is being done to clean up hit registry.  One of my only complaints lately is how bad it feels to get "hit" by a swing that clearly didn't connect.  Now bring on Ghostyboi!
---
Isn't the event live?
---
Does this mean that Ghostface and the event are postponed?
---
When is dedicated servers coming?
---
&gt; Pop Goes The Weasel: Changed Regression values from 15%/20%/25% to a flat 25% across all tiers. Changed window of activation from 30 seconds to 40/50/60 seconds.
---
I'll definitely be using this a lot more. That increased timer makes it viable on everyone rather than high mobility killers.
---
That’s how they always do it, the console stores update at a certain time so they wait until they can do a simultaneous release on all platforms
---
Pains in the ass
---
Not yet, not until the stores update sometime in the next couple hours
---
He is if you buy him with shards but I’m waiting for the full chapter for the extra cosmetic
---
&gt;Adjusted fast vault conditions: Players can no longer trigger fast vaults when beside windows or in contact with the wall.
---
It's genuinely sad that they went through with this. I thought they wouldn't after all the backlash. Congrats on lowering the skill ceiling and yet again nerfing the killer shack, devs.
---
I probably love this the most
---
I agree, i never down one and chase another when two survivors are by eachother, I need to start doing that then. Something to slow the game down would be nice.
---
The patch just went live on PS4!
---
Imagine looping the killer to for the first two minutes only to find your team got all the serum and no gens, one might’ve DCed for good measure
---
This is correct
---
No they didn't. They said they are going to make some *slight* adjustments to him in a hotfix patch in a few days. He's the same ghost face that we saw on the PTB on Thursday.
---
Its the good one.
---
They're just doing a hotfix later to change him again slightly.
---
Besides bloody coil becoming a bit too strong imo, these changes seem great.
---
It's not the shitty ghostface, but they will nerf it a little bit in a hotfix
---
They still do littlr to nothing but give a small bonus
---
U can buy him with shards? I thought u can't buy him cuz hes licensed.  That's great if I could
---
Patch being downloaded on PS4
---
You can buy him in the ingame store just not in the steam store yet, i would assume it's because the steam store needs to update.
---
Well I guess you could just get all the addons and perks on him ready for when it eventually launches. 6ish weeks from now.
---
Those perks are op and amazing lol. Good shit
---
What I meant was if the actual purchase of the non licensed characters with shards may increase the percentage to 80%
---
I think it would be nice to see some sort of incentive added to help balance out the two sides yeah. Like if the matchmaking servers notice that one side doesn't have enough players to meet the demand, then it could give a +25% BP reward for that side or something to encourage a more even 4:1 player split.
---
[roadmap](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D77W0S2WsAEkudU.jpg:large?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
I don't think so, Event offerings become unavaileble because the event hooks/gens aren't a thing anymore. You can still use firecrackers ect.
---
yea it's rough, the works only if a survivor or two go off to try and find the hex totem

---
Same and it’s nice to see what it looks like to others.
---
Did you throw them into a woodchipper?
---
Until rank 8 or so, a killer is going to stomp the survivors of they are halfway decent. Therefore the choice isnt winning or losing, but how to win. Win while being an asshole, or win while not being an asshole.
---
Later, closer to end of summer
---
Wait no that’s not what I meant. I meant before.
---
Being allowed to be an asshole doesn't make someone not an asshole for being an asshole.
---
Yes it was beeping. That was a typo
---
Uh ghost face mask is literally licenced
---
You can't
---
Oink oink oink oink oink oink
---
I know. That was a typo. I meant before the last gen. The trap was beeping and the icon on his name was red
---
Also, no information about the event or the anniversary at all lol?
---
I don't want to level up ghostface before I'm sure the event is up, so I get the cakes.
---
But the check doesn't say Ghostface.
---
In the novel adaption of the original film he was very “excited” stalking the girls.. so there’s that.
---
Finally, with this and the extra double bloodpoints time it's going to be a good few days.
---
Oh god this is awful and I say this as a killer main
---
Oh shit, my bad I honestly meant to say cells not shards, now I feel bad lol
---
What does that means?
---
So as I was saying all day yesterday, you want easy games with as little effort as possible, and dodge everyone else.
---
And yes, the only adjustment you can do is bringing Franklin's and lightborn, if not, good old BBQ, ruin, enduring and spirit fury for m1 killers, and maybe sloppy and nurses for spirit, huntress, nurse and hag. Maybe monitor and abuse on Myers for deos juicy gen grabs. Or noed if you feeling extra spicy today.
---
And don't write back with "hurdri hur, survivors use same op perks too". I know, thanks. I'm done, bye.
---
*snaps fingers*
---
Best thing in the patch notes, and I’m a survivor main.
---
i do the same thing as killer lol, dont hold space long enough
---
Complain all you want, they're just getting bloodpoints like the rest of you. Sorry they don't feel like farming, because it isn't fun or enjoyable.
---
Oh okay but still I don't want to level up ghostface before the event starts.. I want the cakes
---
I know. Just makes me smile when you meet really freindly people. But still there are some people that even if you say gg they act salty but I don’t let it get to me.
---
It only says A. Campbell. Pretty common last name if im not mistaken.
---
And here we see the true skill of NOED at work
---
On ps4, right now.
---
"toxic" post game chats are a dime a dozen in this subreddit. Most people don't care
---
Not during an event, but after it killers gonna have 1000 of Ebony moris.
---
[Here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/66338/).
---
It's under *PTB 3.0.0 a*, under the section titled 'Perks'.
---
BbbbbbBut ThE bLo0dPOiNt EcOnOMY.
---
1. Death finds a way (killer)
---
If there is only one gen left, Survivors have a 15/20/25% of having more skill checks and if a skill check is failed there is a 5/10/20% a survivor is shown to the killer for 3/4/6 seconds
---
2. Friends with benefits (survivor)
---
After healing a survivor, both you and the survivor both gain a speed boost for 2/3/4 seconds and  are immune from hits for 5/6/7 seconds
---
I don't really get the enduring change. Can someone enlight me?
---
The Ghostface Chapter has been released along with the patch and all the bug fixes, map changes and perk changes but the event hasn’t started yet. It will go live automatically later on today.
---
HORRREEEE SHIITTTTT
---
*plays doctor*
---
*realizes im still on console*
---
*cries in 4 fps*
---
He’s underrated. He can slow down the game better than a number of M1 killers.
---
Ghost Face did not need any nerfs. They should wait till they get useful information on the killer against high rank survivors before they touch him. But I guess rank 20s still run the game.
---
That "upcoming Ghostface hotfix" sounds an awful lot like they're waiting for people to buy Ghostface before they nerf him...
---
I have never actually reported anyone, but I wish people would stop being selfish and 'read the room'. If you're the only one who wants to farm (i.e. NOT ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME AS INTENDED), then don't force everyone else to do the same.
---
Is it known what kind of nerf it will be?
---
I do like him I was just interested in playing his reworked version, I can wait though. Just sucks the bad version of Ghostface is the one we got
---
I wonder if this shit is bannable, cause technically you're not playing the game and idling.
---
I was still hoping them talking about big surprises and numerous announcements would not mean "unless you are active in the community".
---
And even disregarding that, most of the stuff on the stream would not have been exciting (to me) even had I not known anything about it. Next Chapter? Actually just a killer, so they downsized for the anniversary. Then that killer is also derivative in gameplay, most disappointingly with again more or less completely generic chase dynamics, and has pretty bad perks. Mobile port? Couldn't care less, and if they are still bent on keeping the game identical on the platforms, this is actually something I would be concerned about rather than excited. Battle Pass/Archve? Basically just daily rituals reworked into something they can build microtransactions into. Don't personally care much for lore in this game, since it's just never really been intriguing. But nice for people that do. More cosmetics is always nice, but we would have kept getting cosmetics anyway, and there was very little actual gameplay-relevant stuff talked about on the entire stream. Map rework plans sounded good, but then it's only a whole of 2 reworks for the entire year. 3 further Chapters is also good, but then not only will one of them not have a map, like Ghostface, but now they've established that a single character can also be considered a "Chapter", so we cannot count on a survivor and killer with each of these. And then the last three Chapters have been rather uninspired, gameplay-wise. Legion, Plague and Ghostface all have essentially completely generic M1 chase gameplay, only using their ability to injure survivors by applying status effects, and they all do it in ways that are more or less uninteractive and don't require skill. Plague has Corrupt Purge, but survivors can potentially deny her access to it. Their perk releases have also mostly been underwhelming, with few exceptions. So Chapters do not necessarily equate to exciting new gameplay, either. And then they didn't even mention anything about mid-Chapter gameplay patches, only Archives/"Rift" stuff.
---
I really love Lullaby, I just wish it wouldn't reveal itself to survivors without actually having any stacks up. Like I get it with Ruin since it's impacting their performance from the start, but why say "HEY GO CLEANSE THIS" when it's basically inert before anybody gets hooked?
---
I don't know about on Xbox, but on steam the special edition doesn't really add anything in game, so I would just get the base game for a little cheaper
---
It's not a P3 Claudette
---
Dissapointed
---
Was it really necessary to add the stun pallet vfx?
---
That was a goodplay but I feel bad for Trapper
---
thats a mood fam
---
Well I know on PS4 there wasn't no DLC sale when a new chapter comes out. But there was a sale, nothing to do with new chapter though. I don't know about Steam
---
Less reason to with the game more balanced. Back with 4x DS .. Infinites .. Pallet stuns.. 3-way flashlight blinds..
---
you sound like a really good person...
---
Ahhhh I get that! It's not so much the actual vomit that makes you uneasy, it's the gagging and heaving. That makes a lot of sense, most people dont relate to projectile vomit, but I think many of us have felt horrible enough to be in fear of throwing up and ultimately that feeling could give me anxiety too. 
---
Thank you for the comment. :) Hopefully you play today, whatre the chances of a plague? Lol
---
PS Sorry in advance if you DO find one.

Hello Drybear. Longtime smite player so funny seeing you here. It's unfortunate to hear you've retired from developing, as considering your history in SMITE, it would be really interesting to see what ideas and abilities you could come up with in DBD.
---
Its actually better with pallets now, it cuts the stun time by 50% now compared to 75% faster recovery, which is weird wording. I think this way its around 0.1s faster.
---
Implying that Enduring wasn't already used entirely for pallets anymore since they changed DS?
---
Is it less good on nurse or something?
---
Cosmetic I think
---
Any fps improve on ps4? Or the 60 fps goal is not important anymore?
---
Yaaass
---
1. (Killer) Dark side of the moon: after hitting your obsession, the entity will shroud the moon behind a thick fog and make the trial moderately/considerably/tremendously darker for 15/20/25s. Survivors auras are shown outside your Terror radius for the duration of the darkness. Dark side of the moon can only be triggered every 45s 
---
2. (Survivor) Loud and Clear: You always go out of your way to make yourself known to shield your allies in the face of danger, every time you get hit or hooked you scream and cause a 4/5/6% repair speed buff for 10s. Does not stack.

---
Well they are reaching the limit on trophies on ps4
---
It’s not out yet, the PS Store hasn’t updated
---
its the same on xbox
---
The news section said he comes with two exclusive items
---
Try rebuilding database, it's in the safe menu somewhere
---
Killers DCing isn't as much of a problem either. It's basically just a forfeit (and should probably award all the remaining survivors points), but survivors DCing screws everyone else over
---
Survivors that leave as soon as hooked are so annoying. A lot of the times the killer isn't even a camper or anything and people are about to go rescure.
---
*happy fingerblade rustling*
---
The last game I played no one lived cause I was the only one who brought party streamers during double BP.  All I seen were cakes and envelopes. So they all died. The end.
---
How long is this usually?
---
Why 103% though? A really odd number.
---
What platform?
---
I know but if we start using them, they won’t be in the unused category anymore
---
Does anybody know when the Xbox One version gets an update for Ghostface and when will Ghostface show up in the PlayStation 4 store
---
Maybe it will get extended indefinitely to help close the gap between new players and hundreds of hours+ players all of whom get matched together despite egregious differences in perk availability. A man can dream~
---
AGREED!
---
Oh okay, thank you
---
Can you link me pls
---
From the upcoming changes part, it's a buff and nerf. His instinct is getting a longer duration, getting a pallet slammed in your face will break you out of it (which is fair I mean I think you're pretty spotted at that point), slightly nerfing his stalk add-ons, buffing a couple other add-ons. Detection range will be increased slightly, and marked survivors cannot be stalked.
---
I think that's an overall buff, but it's hard to say.
---
At the very bottom of the patch notes there are the nerfs and changes. Buff to some addons, nerf to some addons, nerf that makes him break out of ability on pallet stun, and an increase to the camera width to break him out of his ability.
---
Le MoM is now Gon!!!!!!!
---
It looks like it. I thought they originally were including safe hook rescues and protection hits as counting towards it. I guess I kind of understand the point of the perk is if you’re someone who wants the killer to chase you.
---
I’m so confused
---
Yeah, I’m really baffled by this choice. More annoying visual effects that do nothing but cause headaches... why?
---
I mean it only happens with dbd
---
Oh my fucking god they actually addressed Ninja Suit Claudette.  I think... yup.  Just creamed my pants.
---
I do? Cause I kinda thought that made me sound like a dick. Thanks, I guess ☺
---
Oh Yeah forgot about it
---
He isn't even a strong killer
---
They literally said in the patch notes they haven’t changed him lmao
---
I did that on accident just playing as her for a ritual. Match wasn't close to finished either
---
It’s for balance, it would make him really hard to see I’m guessing
---
After 1000 matches you’ll get a “legendary” match the match will include a non facecamping bubba as killer your teammates will be a Claudette who is a gen jockey a Nea who plays very immersive and a person who’ll say that the killer is very experienced.
---
no one will be using mettle again lol
---
Gotta learn somehow.
---
The killer called the survivor a tryhard
---
game is locked at 60
---
 
---
The Ghost Face:
---
· Stalk rate add-ons (Telephoto Lens, Night Vision Monocular) are slightly reduced.
---
· Pallet stuns will now break Ghost Face out of stealth.
---
· Marked Survivors may no longer be stalked.
---
· Killer Instinct base duration slightly increased.
---
· Killer Instinct add-on (Marked Map, Victim’s Detailed Routine) duration slightly increased.
---
· Detection area of screen slightly increased for Survivors attempting to reveal Ghost Face.
---
Actually pay to win
---
You nailed it. They want to sell as many DLCs as they can before nerfing him. Once sales slow down they will nerf him good
---
I bet you would back a shirtless Clown lol. Love the descriptions, i might have slightly different ones but hang in there. After a time you will get better and opinions might change. 😊
---
Look up end game collapse, decisive strike was changed to only work for 60 seconds after you have been unhooked, exhaustion perks all have a cool down now so they can’t be used in conjunction with each other and their cool down does not decrease while you are running.
---
Deep wounds is a new status effect that slowly dwindles your health away and will put you in the dying state if you don’t mend yourself, and there is a new status effect where you become infected with a plague that makes you contagious to other players. Once your sickness meter maxes out you become broken and can’t heal until you interact with fountains on the map. 
---
These are the biggest changes from the last year, plenty of balancing changes and new characters have been added but those are things you should consult the wiki about.
---
Ah I see.
---
I don't really see any significant nerfs here. I think the detection area for survivors was a bit inconsistent. Pallet stuns affecting his stealth is a bit iffy to me, but other than that there is not really anything that would severely affect him. He is still the same Ghostface from the last days of the PTB with some minor tweaks.
---
Hmm so happy i got bbq and Franklin's from the shrine so i dont have to buy leatherface unless i want him.
---
They will in the upcoming future including losing his power at pallet stuns wich i dont get
---
Oh shit how long will this be active on the webs? Im not off work for another 7 hours
---
Half a minute is still almost a minute, but when you a hater common sense just fly out the window.
---
Oh well...
---
will can buy him with auric cells right now
---
Edgy skinny jean boi
---
"nerf". Please... more like QOL changes... The pallet stun one makes sense, just don't get stunned by a pallet. The detection change is a small change of 4% on either side to actually make it possible to reveal him when in a chase. Cause having him dead center on your screen and it not doing anything is stupid as hell.
---
I’m sad there’s no new survivor lol we just supposed to deal with new powers from a killer with no help?
---
Wow it's only day one of the new killer and they're already announcing nerfs.
---
Nope! Still ongoing. Have not played since the patch so I can't say if that fixes it but I doubt it.
---
I wonder is gruesome will be in every bloodweb. If it is, Holly cow, prepare for killers to use Ebony moris with red add ons for the next 3 years.
---
they did in the ptb also made it so you could take a insta down but ppl complained. honestly all they needed to do was make it so unhooks do not count but keep the insta down part. or just have changed  mettle so you need 4 hits instead of 3. no one is ever going to use it now
---
Losing the ability to extend the marked duration timer as well as being able to be seen more easily probably push this in to nerf territory.
---
Yeah, they’re waiting for everyone to buy him first. Typical.
---
dude do you really think pallet stuns knocking him out of the power is going to ruin him? if you're in your power its your job to use your lack of red stain to get the survivor. This small change isn't gonna make any difference.
---
I think it looks good on the white head as well .
---
Imagine the upcoming Freddy rework..... oh god
---
Im more happy about mom changes then new content.
---
Sounds like Final Fantasy music after winning a random encounter battle. But it's been a while since I played any of those games
---
Yes, he is licensed so cells only.
---
You can't buy ANY licensed character with shards dude
---
its just one person got it wrong and everybody is taking it as fact and the nerf in a few days is pretty balanced by the looks of it and makes sense.
---
There’s these really neat thing called jokes. The fact that I ended with “escaping” as something no mother counters should have been the tip off
---
pay to lose dlc
---
You can't buy licensed characters with shards
---
If that isn’t good after a year and a half, I’m deadass giving up
---
None of the previous licensed characters have been available with shards.
---
Could use a ski mask with eyes and mouth sewn up like in [Mission Impossible](https://youtu.be/UTHVmd87QrY?t=83) wouldn't need any license for that.
---
Not sure how you could see out of it, but honestly how can anyone really see out of any of legions masks?
---
That's all I needed to know in this patch. Won't be buying the DLC.
---
I am a proud Tapp main
---
I have 12 skeleton keys and 11 dull keys. Plus more than enough add ons for when I die and unlock, as well as white wards. Just save up bloodpoints and buy them in the bloodweb and use them sparingly and only if you have to. If you can get out without hatch, don’t waste your key
---
Thank god, The Ghost Face sounded stupid!
---
Ofc its gonna make a difference, you can risk way less and potentially get more looped for it. I just dont like that they have to add this to every new killer like why just cant they have that
---
im very triggered
---
THEY DID IT, THEY CHANGED ALMOST ALL THE NEGATIVES ABOUT HIM NOW
---
always a salty killer main to start crying..
---
Lol I don't care about upvote or downvote and I'm not taking any pity part, I was just saying that I don't think I will find people agree with my opinion under a sequence of killer complaining comments. My thought was pretty simple: is not the "reward for losing" concept the problem of the perk cause this concept is used in a lot of different other perks and mechanics in this game. It looks like people just try to find any possible reason to put shit on what they hate. And I never say that you in particular play only a side, I was trying to say that people who always complain just against a side should play more both. And in conclusion I assumed that you was going to justify the other perks I mentionated to give examples only because you did that for the first one.
---
Half a minute is half of a minute, but when you're a hater who forgets to write "are" in your comment common sense just flies out the window.
---
There used to be strong reasons for killers to lagswitch.
---
They posted the incoming hotfix changes right below it. It's not a big secret.
---
DEV NOTE: We have made some slight adjustments to Ghost Face following the second PTB. Unfortunately, they have not made it into the current patch but will be introduced in an upcoming hotfix in the near future. Thank you for your understanding.
---

Not being able to stalk marked targets and increased detection area are big question marks for me. I’ll probably hold off on buying him until I see some video of him in action.
---
Would be too close to Scream black robe, they could possibly be sued if it wasn’t for the red.
---
I used it because I forgot to remove it today lmao
---
\&gt;Sweet dreams are made of keys, who am I to disagree 
---
Fucking genius
---
I mean... can you even name a more iconic (perk) duo than enduring and spirit fury?
---
Yeah. I play both sides, and ACTUAL straight up camping and face-camping is not only a jerk thing to do, but it's a terrible way to play killer from an actual points/performance perspective as well. I just get mad at people yelling at me in post chat when they'd never let me hook anybody without being obviously in the immediate area, essentially forcing me to stay in a certain radius of the hook unless I just wanted to give them a freebie. Like hide, stay away until I've left so you can get a safe unhook. I'm not gonna stay unless you force me to.
---
The hotfix changes to Ghost Face are almost completely nerfs. Killer instinct duration is okay, but really only helps if you're slow to spin the camera and spot the survivor. Pallet stun knocking him out of stealth feels okay thematically, but I wish they waited before adding stuff like this. Along with nerfing his mark speed with addons and not allowing him to extend the mark duration by stalking marked survivors, I feel like the recovery on his power should be decreased by at least a few seconds. However, it seems like they gutted MoM and window loops got hit pretty hard, so maybe M1 killers will have a better time now
---
mindgames could be kinda harder
---
Yeah I'm really hoping they're accurate so I can at least play for an hour or so before I have to go to work for the entire rest of the day :(
---
Instead of making it viable yet more balanced it's based off of getting protection hits which are inconsistent as hell. The old MoM was very powerful, maybe too powerful but they made it useless like the other 50+ survivor perks that are in the game right now.
---
Yes, thank the entity!
---
Being able to stalk marked survivors to refresh their exposed was nice. RIP.
---
Yeah, but they could possibly get in some legal trouble because then it would look ALOT like the scream robe but I would definitely love it.
---
You do realize that it probably wasn't up to BHVR to change his name to "The Ghost Face", right?
---
...And turned out that the game is indeed passing through a nightmare right now.
---
Just had my match and it’s smooth as hell. Whether it stay like that is another thing.
---
shards can only be used on Non Licensed killers/survivors and some cosmetics 
---
Auric cells can be purchased and used to unlock Killers/Survivors  "cosmetics"
---
if you don't want to buy the full dlc from whatever store your platform offers
---
mind you if you don't buy the dlc you will miss out on some sort of exclusive cosmetic
---
just a white knife and a lighter grey hood with white streaks instead of black
---
yeah there is apparently
---
Can anyone remind me of a perk that does that? Also, why does he got? Is this a legit sentence? I\`m not sure if this is a mistake, so I'm asking.
---
Ghostface doesn't seem to be a full chapter, he's just 500 Auric Cells in the shop, he had 3 cosmetics, 2 of which are just a simple red/blue colour scheme and the last gives him a devil sort of look.
---
when will the DLC for Ghostface be released on steam exactly?
---
A good killer doesn't need to cheat for killing survivors lmao, the ones that cheat are losers that can't handle a loss
---
Nice :) gonna log on and check him out then
---
Why did the post get removed that had the store banners for all the upcoming cosmetics like Pig/Tapp?
---
So not worth then?
---
u/vreddit_downloader
---
oh no, a pallet stun change and a 4% reduction, this character is ruined AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
---
^^^^/s
---
I can’t be the only one who gets thrown off when I see, “mom” instead of, “MoM.” 😂
---
Lmao this has been my favorite use of this meme so far
---
I've got a stream to run! No point starting until it's out as I'll have to restart the stream #consoleplaysucks
---
Yeah I know, I’m just sayin it comes with 2 exclusive cosmetics if you buy him with actual money instead of auric cells
---
I absolutely LOVE this meme!
---
I found it pretty cool, I loved the jacket, only thing I don't know about is the pick, I wonder if it would look a bit "strange" with their animations.
---
Does anyone have pictures of the 2 exclusive items with the DLC? Trying to decide if I want to buy the DLC or just unlock the character
---
U played against all killers in 3 days?
---
I’ve been saying the same thing recently about medkits. Even if it took a particular add on I think you should be able to heal yourself with while downed. I think it would be cool if they changed the syringe to do that. Would take away some of the toxic insta heal medkits by only leaving the stypic agent but would lead to some interesting plays.
---
that does not seem that bad at all
---
Wow... I really hope this wins..
---
He's $4.99
---
that was 9 mins ago tho
---
Nice ghostface hot fix announcement btw. Glad to see the game is still more leaning towards survivors
---
In the in-game store. You can only buy him using auric cells. Not sure when they're gonna release him on the steam store.
---
This post is a smear job on the prestigious Dildo University. 
---
DILDO π FOR LIFE. BIG PINK
---
I remember running it, hooking a survivor and thinking “oshitoshitoshit get to a gen fuckfuckfuck” every time, this is a very welcome change.
---
Nea spray painting/tagging event pls
---
Yeah, this David was my fellow survivor. He ran a Billy around in a cornfield nonetheless for a few minutes after saving 2 of us from the basement. He kept the killer busy which allowed us do the last 3 gens and get the gates open. Right at the gate, the Billy got him and had Rancor and Mori’d him. He was a hero and deserved some sappy feedback.
---
I've gotten 2 in the past week.
---
Oh damn:(
---
Doubt it will change P3 Claud. Its blood on someone whos Black, cant exactly make that too light. I think its talking about those darker cosmetics for auric cells
---
They didnt need to move, that's the whole point of insidious.
---
Yes you can get stuck in a tree, it happens and when it does it sucks.
---
Can also happen to the killer.
---
and that ghostface cant now stalk marked survivors...
---
Ghostface has gotten a small nerf. The only sort of big things are Night Shroud going away when being hit by a pallet (Which why would you be getting hit by a pallet if you needed your night shroud), and they made it a little bit easier to spot ghostface in the middle of your screen.
---
Oh ok. Guess have to find a new look for ace
---
Wow, that’s discouraging.  I’m not surprised it’s longer with double BP extended and new killer, but surely it should be better than that.  Hope it gets better for you!
---
I don’t see the big deal honestly. It does not seem that bad at all. Ppl see change and can only see a buff or nerf
---
so i guess he gets released on steam soon
---
It's just a bit early. He wasnt even functioning for the early half of the ptb and the ptb is not an absolute indicator of how powerful a killer will be when live. So some thing a pre-emptive nerf is unreasonable.
---
Also the whole releasing a killer before nerfing him and not being 100% forthcoming with what those nerfs are going to be.
---
How very dare you.
---
Give him gold
---
How much does it cost?
---
It's a minor nerf yeah, but the problem is that Ghostface wasn't that strong to begin with. He was pretty okay and this puts him down in low tier. I don't think this nerf was necessary, especially since he hadn't even gone live yet to test.
---
Killer: You took everything from me
---
Ace: I got it from a chest
---
I think my favourite is the ribbon flowing with her hair. They could do a lot with Spirit aside from kimonos and school girl outfits, hopefully something like this comes out for her.
---
I think its a loop I cant tell
---
It's licensed. You have to buy it.
---
They also removed his ability to extend the time survivors are marked. And to say "a little bit easier" is making a small assumption cause we dont know how much easier it will be to detect him.
---
Noed is cheap as fuck and you gotta admit it, "lmao just cleanse" is just as stupid as talking about the old decisive "lmao just juggle them". Totems never were an objective, they take pretty long to find let alone do, and even then theres a chance the killer never had the perk so you just wasted 2-3 minutes(assuming everyone is commited to cleansing), thats 2 full generators worth of time. 
---
The best way to fix that is to have a global totem counter like generators, even if noed doesnt proc it wastes so much time.
---
I think he’s called The Ghost Face and not The Ghost because of The Spirit. In other languages, The Spirit translates to The Ghost so I’m assuming it would’ve caused too much confusion for other languages.
---
Unlucky :)
---
Yo can i have some?
---
Yes.
---
I asked people earlier if they thought Claudette's cosmetics should be made brighter. That's cool, I'm a survivor, but hopefully this is fairer for killers
---
That's only if you assume theyll spend the whole game for that one kill. I'd like to believe in the killer and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. They played the game, scared some people, the endgame was about to begin and they become patient. 
---
The world may never know.
---
You realize that survivors used to be able to sabo every hook in the entire map, right, creating an unwinnable condition for play?
---
It’s one of her skins that can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/h1FSS-k9UhE) at 1:50 :) I just thought it was a good complimentary shapes to all the long lines and cuts
---
Love your friend 
---
"*you fucking idiot*"
---
It’s my most anticipated as well.  Hype!
---
I dont think its right for them to do that tho... personally i think they should wait before doing any changes... hopefuly it doasnt influence much on how viable he is....
---
&gt;All Killer swing animations have been modified to match the distance at which they can hit a survivor.
---
While this is nice, post-window-vault hit registration should really be looked at. I don't believe it is solely latency and host latency advantage causing ridiculous post-window-vault hits.
---
&gt;Added stun VFX for Killers when hit by pallets.
---
Y tho.
---
This is terrible and could actually make me enjoy the game decidedly less, and thus play decidedly less often, too.
---
&gt;Adjusted certain darker cosmetics that gave players an advantage to be lighter.
---
Oh?
---
&gt;Adjusted Killer Instinct VFX
---
Hope this will help judge distance of revealed survivors better. I also hope they've fixed the AFX bug where Killer Instinct procs often just don't cause pulse audio to play.
---
&gt;Adjusted the chase volume for Survivors.
---
Nice.
---
&gt;Removed the RNG factor from the window setups in the rooms of Lery's Memorial Institute
---
PTB Lery's seemed to have unsafe windows everywhere now...
---
&gt;Mettle of Man
---
There goes the first S-tier survivor perk to have been released in ages.
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused the Resilience perk not to affect window vaults.
---
Still really happy this has been done, and that despite not being mentioned, this also goes for Spine Chill and Leader. What I'm not happy about is that Dead Hard is most likely still affected by these perks, as well, shortening the dash.
---
Another undocumented change I've read about: You cannot cancel the unhook interaction and clip through the hooked survivor any longer. This is unfortunate, as it takes away some gameplay around hooks, which there should be more of, not less. And they have still not addressed the issue where a survivor cannot be unhooked while another  survivor is in the animation of being interrupted from unhooking them.
---
Hahahaha lol
---
So I can't look now because I'm not at home, but were the other cosmetics (Pig sets, Scarecrow Wraith, etc.) in this initial drop or are they going to be mid-chapter additions?
---
So what? If you've already marked them then it's time to sta, why are you continuing to stalk?
---
Ca veut tu dire que la sortie de ghostface est reporter?
---
Putting traps on dropdowns is awesome. You literally cancel out %30 of the chases with that.
---
Lol that’s crappy
---
Not just the terror radius, the whole sound is fucked. I don't hear the sound cue for Alert at all although I can see it triggered. At least on PS4.
---
because was unecessary.
---
Well considering that 90% of the playerbase would want the points, I'd take those odds. 1 person reporting me for unsportsmanlike behaviour against probably near a hundred other people I've played with who enjoyed the game and were happy to get out alive with pips and everything, I can take that.
---
Yes,  but almost complete invisibility in plain sight is way too strong,  no perk can counter that
---
I can't even hear a terror radius lol and Myers footsteps sounds like he's a damn robot
---
They're not gonna make shirtless Myers
---
and /u/Eylmao537 So stealth should not be viable at all? This game used to be about cat and mouse dynamics but that is not the case anymore.  Coupled with all the survivor nerfs to chases, pallets and this new vault change there are less and less means to evade killers.
---
I have even started wearing brighter clothes not so much as i wanted to be in more chases but what is the point anymore? I liked being the gen jocky, repairing gens(powering through ruin as well) as other survivors kited killers while making hook saves as necessary but that is no longer the case.
---
I just hope the loop rework helps make things more balanced and fun for both sides.
---
Why would you want to stalk someone who is already fully stocked I don't get it?
---
This is  awesome
---
Yeah but jane was already on it, so it wouldn't matter either way. 
---
Also what a complicated way of thinking. Instead that the killer simply defended himself from being called a try hard, you think that he meant jane only found(?) the hatch because of the game map and he blames his fuck up solely on this as well? Correct me if i misunderstood you but honestly it looks like you are reading too much into that.
---
because if ur too far away they can loop u for 45 seconds, and if ur too close, with the detection nerf they will detect u more easier.
---
To be fair. I think with the vault changes and s-tier perk nerf this wasnt exactly the best patch for survivors either.
---
I think they extended it to the 20th
---
Dwigh...DWIGHT WHAT HAVE YOU BECOME!!!
---
because they gay
---
Do you know if they do it across all platforms or just PC?
---
fuck you
---
A man can dream
---
I mean it already lasts 45 seconds if I remember right, which is a very generous duration. If they can stay away from you for that long without taking one hit I'd say that's fair enough.
---
Yea no one understands her traps till rank 15
---
Crappy because it’s supposed to stop survivors from “holding the game hostage,” but most of the time it just results in killers closing the hatch and then going back and forth between the exits and last survivor really doesn’t stand a chance at all and even if they run and avoid the killer they still die to the entity which gives the killer sacrifice points. It needs to be improved, but I’m not even sure how exactly to improve it in a good way that keeps it balanced...or more balanced than it is.
---
I generally prefer BL just because I feel like I have the most control over it. Not to mention it has the secondary effect of a reduced stun from drops even if you are exhausted which makes loops like the Asylum and Macmillan’s a bit safer. Often times too, if I am looping a killer between upper and lower floors, they will sometimes wait at the bottom for me, leaving me a chance to sit up too and regain my Exhaustion.
---
Also, several of the maps have a central gen near a 2F. With Balanced Landing, I feel safer cranking out this risky gen and have a better chance of keeping the last 3 gens spread out if the middle one is done. 
---
It’s personal preference though. I was skeptical til I started using it and now I love it. Lithe isn’t bad at all, but since killers can still hit through windows, I often don’t get to use it.
---
People are freaking out about it but it’s only %15 more bloodpoints if 5 people run it, than if 5 people run party streamers
---
Wait so is Xbox’s version already out? Because it says a patch is needed to play
---
unlucky
---
I think that slight nerf to breaking him out of his power was needed. Noob3 had a video showing how it was near impossible to break him out of it. He could just stalk people during chases, have survivors looking right at him and he still doesn't break out of it.
---
It got extended two more days. So 20th 2pm est
---
j/k i still love you automod unlike most mods
---
What is the Nerf?
---
No you get bonus for EG saves and hooks
---
I love it!
---
They should extend it for the rest of eternity at the rate we have to eat through garbage perks like Predator 🤔
---
nice saw that a few minutes ago, I was staying up to farm the rest of the time, I can go to bed now 😂
---
HA!
---
Hard to say. I can just say that i found this on [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/sub/374521/)...
---
I reckon most of the time they disconnect cause they ragequit with an alt+f4.
---
Is this real?
---
Aside from the ridiculous claim that a 4% increase is going to make you totally unable to go undetected, how would continuing to stalk help you in this situation?
---
To give you some perspective, I unlocked BBQ and chili, I leveled trapper all the way to 50, nothing, stayed at 50 for another 10 or so webs, got bbq 1, next web, bbq2. Now it's been another 25 or so webs, maybe more, and still no bbq 3 :p the more perks you own the harder it is :p
---
Ash also released in the in-game store a few hours before the platform stores. I think it's more expensive to use Auric Cells though and you don't get the second outfit that is usually included in the normal purchase, so it's better to wait a bit.
---
He sucks without addons
---
Facts
---
Yeah it’s something that’s honestly been a long time coming
---
All of them look so good god damn
---
Close enough they basically share half the roster
---
I'm a little upset, I can't join this event because my family had a house fire and my console was in there... it really sucks.
---
He's already up on the PSN Store in NA but the dummy mods removed my post
---
I was just thinking frank and Julie could use some cosmetic love, love the concept!!
---
People are complaining because killers are always nerfed before they even go live to have a chance to try out. Plus i dont understand how Hillbilly, Nurse, and even Spirit exist, yet anyone can complain about another M1 killer lol just my thoughts.
---
Is 360 Juke still a thing?
---
I didn't say stealth shouldn't exist. I'm saying invisibility because you picked a cosmetic is bs because you either need to have good eyes for it or you will be ducked with. 
---
Stealth is about moving tactically and being smart.  Sitting in a corner as a blendette is cheap and neither of those things
---
Bloodpoint gains are additive, not multiplicative, so there's no reason to hold on to them really.
---
it's 11:19 EST :)
---
Why close it when you can sit on it and maybe finish up the 4k. Most survivors dont do gens once everyone else dies, theyll wander the area looking for the hatch. Its bait, clear and simple and its effective.
---
Not that I do it, but I cant fault a killer for trying.
---
With 4 gens done and 1 sacrifice, not you.
---
Killers like him are the reason survivors teabag.
---
Losing the power completely is a bit much because of how long it takes to charge.
---
It's reasonable, but feels bad.
---
You can’t really be that dense. If he hadn’t been trying to be an ass and close the hatch, for the hell of it, he would’ve easily got his coveted 4K. Which is his actual job as killer.
---
Go to settings, account management, "restore licenses" boom fixed :)
---
I’m sorry but what is the nerf to him that the devs are planning to do? I’ve heard he’s getting nerfed but can someone tell me what exactly will be nerfed about him?
---
Oh no worries. I’m not confident in drawing female anatomy, so I probably could’ve done a better job on making it a little more prominent. Appreciate the feedback though :)
---
Been playing alot and accidently shot myself into the high ranks, now I just wanna farm and use my bloodpoint offerings on other killers, just let me have fun and hook you all at least once...I dont care for pips just give me some points you sweaty p3 blendette with a flashlight...
---
Thats why he needs a buff.
---
Watching a lot of high rank videos made it apparent it takes a lot of effort to break him out of shroud. I was fully expecting the detection to be increased and I'm fine with it.
---
That's how I've described the game to my friends and parents. It's extreme hide and seek, and then you die.
---
They nerf every decent survivor perk. Honestly, it's a little absurd.
---
I hope he donates it to the buff Freddy cause
---
I wouldn't say it's totally useless, but I can agree that it's nothing worth running until they make protection hits more consistent, or at least clarify what the game considers a protection
---
$5
---
Wait, Rusty Shackles was bugged this entire time? Why am I hearing it about it just now?? I was wondering why the hell I had such a bad luck with this add on, like survivors always knew I was gonna teleport, now I know. Thanks for informing the public.
---
It looks like hes wearing a cut up trash bag
---
The only time outside BBQ I'll ever use a locker
---
Any idea when the new changes will be added in the hot fix? Tomorrow?
---
Not available yet, but typically cosmetics come out on Wednesdays so there’s hope for tomorrow.
---
no, that would be Central Time.
---
You gotta get outside
---
Well, to be honest they could definetly find a workaround ... ANYTHING would be better than fucking Ghost Face ...
---
que animal eres?
---
I once bought Ruin from a shrine but I lost shards and didn't receive it. I thought I was just unlucky but when I leveled up Hag the teachable appeared. Go to Tapp and check the teachable perks at his info screen. If it says that you have Tenacity unlocked, you are just unlucky. Otherwise, you can send a ticket. You will get your shards back.
---
honestly with the gameplay ive seen it looks like even if you are looking at ghostface he can still stalk you for a good while and sometimes complete the stalk which shouldnt happen
---
Stop trying to trick survivors into doing this.
---
Well damn, people really gonna use OoO to counter that lol
---
Definitely - hopefully Claudette's will do generators now, instead of crouching on the edge of the map :p
---
the worst feeling is getting Mori'd 4 minutes into the match then watching the killer farm with the other 3 survivors with 3 BPS active.
---
"sorry daily"
---
I'm on pc
---
They lighten all of Claudette's dark clothes?
---
You could do this to refill the exposure meter. Giving you more time to down them.
---
What was the nerf?
---
Dang feels bad man.
---
Lowering the skill ceiling?
---
It was an exploit against the intended fast vault mechanics.
---
The Devs made it very clear that they wanted fast vaults to require running straight at the window with speed, and they added conservation of momentum to strengthen proper fast vaults. Without this change we might as well lower the skill ceiling to 0, and remove the slow and medium vaults.
---
just fucking play, and u will notice that these nerfs are unecessary, did u ever played the GF on the PTB? because seems like not, these changes were unecessary
---
I believe it’s been extended now for 2 days.
---
Thanks!!
---
3 of 4 is totally better than 4 of 4 too.
---
Perfect.
---
\&gt; Fixed an issue that caused the Entity gargle noises to remain on the hooks when a Survivor was unhooked.
---
When does the anniversary event go live?
---
There was literally a thread about this yesterday with survivors standing in the exit gate to get their “extra bloodpoints” instead of “just getting tf out.” Do you feel the same way about that? Cause killers complained so much about it that now we have this EGC crap. I don’t care for either one, most survivors who wait in the exit are not caring about blood points just like most killers who close the hatch aren’t worried about bloodpoints. It’s all about being annoying, toxic and mocking the other person.
---
People are just pissy.
---
I mean use shards
---
I did quite a bit, on both sides. And I found that survivors couldn't reliably keep GF in the detection area while running from him. It's a super small nerfand you'll barely notice it as killer
---
Yea, it's terrifying. When playing against the Huntress, you can still hope she cannot aim or juke at the right time, but the Plague with her projectile vomit is pretty much a death sentence if anybody cleanses themselves during the whole trial. I mean, being infected and puking sucks ass but better than cleansing and thus unlocking her deadlier ability
---
$3.99 for US I believe. For me it's $6 in Singapore
---
Sounds like the Killer might be DCing
---
If someone DC’s I usually don’t kill any of them. It sucks when people DC. It can completely ruin the survivors time
---
To make sure the timer doesn't run out?
---
he should be like Leatherface right? 
---
if so it ahoukd be for 3$ ( in my currency )
---
It's pretty annoying for them to change cosmetics that people (possibly) paid money for. On the plus side they finally fixed the long hair for Jake looking like seaweed.
---
Yes!
---
Same here. I'm trying to get a refund through support
---
I joined a match but received no memo about it being a farming match. I was invited to a party but for some reason the invite only showed up on my phone in the app and didn't pop on screen. I had no way to communicate so I dropped party.  I was playing normal, getting hit and hooked and then saved by players who were doing it right in Spirit's face. 
---
And THEN I noticed how all 4 of them were interacting and realized they were working together. I tried to approach and make the hand gestures to show I got it. 
---
And then I was killed.
---
And then I selected the gamertag who invited me to a party in the first place and joined their party. 
---
I started in saying "so I realized too late that we were working with the killer" and that's why I ended up standing around at the end. They felt bad. 
---
And then we went on to survive together. We still do .
---
Wonder when it will go live on console. Have fun guys and get a selfie Mori for me!
---
From my understanding the actual reason he wears the mask is for his family's safety. I saw this posted some time ago with the story that in some countries you can be attacked for having that kind of wealth.
---
Yikes, and you don't see anything wrong with what you just said?
---
He is. He's not a full chapter dlc so his price will be lower.
---
I'm interpreting he was insidious behind the gate all game though.  Same thing as idling cause survivors aren't getting boldness or altruism points.  Survivors could depip because of this type of play.
---
Gotta agree.
---
Same happened to me, sometimes the closest gen I could get too wasn't even that repaired so I felt bad about using it, I doubt that'll happen now.
---
It's on Xbox now just need to search for it.
---
Yeah in terms of detection it seems bhvr has failed to get it right.
---
You know that comment was stupid that's why you got off topic.
---
you may wanna explain that to him then https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c203ov/sweet_dreams_are_made_of_keys_who_am_i_to_disagree/erh8szd/
---
It's a white version of the default outfit if you buy the actual dlc
---
I mean if he hadn't been an asshole and dropped you to close hatch he would have gotten the kill. Tryna blame the map my ass.
---
[I already did.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c23s9p/morezpack_for_300/) The link on this page is also updated
---
Because survivors are looking for and think its Ruin, and unless you run Thrill of the Hunt or Haunted Grounds theres no punishment to cleansing a lit totem.
---
Listen I am on your side, but I gotta downvoe this till you add that cool music.
---
I know, i remember the map infested with pallets, i remember the trapper 7seconds to place a bear trap, i remember the pallet vacuum, i remember when the game used to be scary. But that is not a excuse to cheat, and you seem to use a lagswitch, shame on you.
---
MoM is now a dead perk that only encourages sandbagging. RIP.
---
yes, I learned my lesson with Ash so I just wait til they're on steam before I buy
---
Very nice choice. I'd call it a good trade. I started back in the 90s so I've played a little bit. Good luck on your musical journey. 
---
Oh and also the dbd theme is seriously easy to learn. And the palm muted double pick riff that plays when you get hooked isn't terribly hard either
---
I wouldn't know, I already had all licensed characters to the point where they introduced the whole shop system. The only character I ever had to grab after that, was Legion, with Blood Shards.
---
It looks great imo but I feel like it would make him easy to notice. I haven't played as him or against one with that outfit so I'm unsure.

I hope she was pissed

If u buy the dlc u get the outfit
---
You can use Auric Cells to just buy GF from the store. If you buy the actual chapter from the Microsoft, Sony or Steam stores you get exclusive cosmetic/s
---
I was thinking this the other day.  I would be concerned though regarding a straight 2x multiplier for survivors and killers.  I would actually think killers working together make things way more difficult for survivors and maybe survivors would be better with 10-12.  
---
The other issues are lag, map sizes and player base being large enough to support enough games across platforms.
---
It’s Freddy all over again, no one is willing to wait a week until we know how he really plays.
---
I usually use barrowed time but it’s double bloodpoints... so
---
That’s why you never buy with auric cells you miss cosmetics
---
Oh this can't be that bad, probably just a normal nurse jumpscare.
---
*sees the perks*
---
o h n o
---
Nice assumption of him jackass. Also, way to ignore his listing of a series of annoyances. Here, let me just beat you with a bat and laugh at you with my buddies, but if you complain, you're a pussy for complaining and a moron for letting it happen.
---
Ah sweet, already built up shards and a million BP for ghost face! I will now grind BP for bloddy GF!!
---
Can't tell if you're a surv main who's legitimatly happy or a killer main who thinks GF is being nerfed but please actually read the upcoming changes. All they've changed is a few things to make it more balanced.
---
Yeah. That was nothing but a massive BM.
---
This has been happening nonstop for me since about 3-4 days ago. Multiple survivors DC at once, usually 3 but sometimes 2 or all four. I'm using Ethernet.
---
Just started happening out of the blue.
---
Completely untrue. What if I just plain like dark clothes and it has nothing to do with stealth? And I spent money on a black shirt, that has now been lightened.
---
I had this happen to me once. Send in a support ticket and they will give you back your bloodpoints. They're really good about this type of stuff! Hope it goes well!
---
It’s because everyone is trying to play Ghostface, nobody is playing survivor
---
It’s happening to everybody
---
In reality, what difference does surviving or not make? You lose 5k points for dying, but gain a hell of a lot for chases, boldness, altruism etc. You'll still pip. The killer however, won't. The best for all players is to let the killer sacrifice you after building up as many points as you can.
---
No YOU'RE breathtaking!
---
Obviously this isn't intended, you doughnut
---
Anything with Hag gets an upvote.
---
...but they are fixing it, so after hotfix itll work fine
---
I've had this issue forever it's no exclusive to today.
---
Ah, thanks!
---
Enduring now makes it take exactly 1 second of stun in the pallet, before it was 1,26 seconds.
---
Some survivors, especially Claudette, when they stay the last one alive, they hide somewhere on the map in bushes so it takes forever for killers to find them and they get angry.
---
Oh hidy ho officer,  weve had a doozy of a day...
---
If they slam a pallet on you, I think you're pretty well caught.
---
1k UPVOTES!!?! Holy shit thank you!
---
whos they? lmao
---
When is the anniversary event anyone know when?
---
Lmao what about the ban system on consoles?
---
"We are working on a system to ban console players but it's not easy, sorry about all the lag switchers and hackers"
---
*Players find prestige glitch*
---
"Good news everyone, we can ban people now!"
---
Don't crouch?
---
you do realize it got buffed right?
---
BRRRRINGHUEAAAH
---
Don't think it did, didn't see any offerings in my survivor bloodweb either
---
they should combat this by buffing the amount of BP survivors get. it feels like i easily get twice the BP when i play killer.
---
That's on them. BHVR has the right to re-balance at any time. That'd be like demanding a refund for a killer/survivor because they had to re-balance a clearly overpowered perk. *cough cough* ~~Ash~~ *cough cough*
---
It sucks, but the best thing to do is to bait out the unhook VS stealth Killers you suspect are nearby, possibly run tracking Perks which can help indicate them being nearby. Or if you run with SWF/friends run Kindred which when hooked you should see em if nearby.
---
If that doesn't work,,body block after an unhook, maybe use a flashlight or even instant heal after you unhook em if it's a constant situation you face.
---
Yes, an outfit and a knife
---
How do I send one never had to do it before im on console btw
---
But, his movement speed stays the same?..
---
YA TRY HARD HOW DARE YOU NOT KNOW WHAT KILLER BEFORE THE MATCH YOU'LL BE GOING AGAINST NOR THE MAP!!!! YET YOU BROUGHT A KEEEEEEY????!?!?!?!?!?! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Seriously though, you got lucky he didn't hook you!
---
It was patched so i don't think it will be a problem to explain,
---
Basically if you had a controller plugged in or played console you could switch characters really quickly. So what you did was get a character that you could prestige, go to prestige them and then quickly change characters, letting you prestige characters you haven't leveled up.
---
Definetly need costumes for Frank and Julie.   This is awesome!
---
Why would you want to get out of Night Shroud you are literally 115 ms when standing and have no TR or red stain? Don't crouch around the entire map like a Pig.
---
It is a buff to enduring and a buff to stun perks, win-win.
---
i think the stun should be added as well as the camera as it was a pain to do the power knock in a chase. but they should have waited for the rest. However there not in yet so bhvr can still stop the nerf if they wanted.
---
Both a buff and a nerf. It's less viable now because it applies to less situations. There are now more stun methods, so it applies to less of the gameplay. This makes builds using it less viable. Perks need to accomplish multiple things -- they need to earn the slot.
---
How is that hard to understand? The perk was cut in half.
---
Are you serious with those captions? Enduring is now stronger vs pallets
---
Is it really that toxic? I have like 4 insta heals for my Meg lol but I haven’t ever used it before
---
1 hour and 15 minutes, after that the event is supposed to start. You have time to save up bp, good luck :)
---
That’s with the optimization that’s all gonna bE one big announcement in the future.
---
You might need to get glasses if so blind.
---
Ya but you cant dh cause exhaustion from adren
---
&gt; we just supposed to deal with new powers from a killer with no help?
---
You mean besides the like 50 perks survivors already have?
---
Then you have to deal with the fact that the devs are allowed to change things in the game if they perceive them to break the meta or gameplay.
---
Well they did say they reduced the detection area, and made it take longer to break him out of stealth so how do you know? You crusty was bagel.
---
I like the mask idea.
---
You do realize they cut the perk in half.. Do you understand what the perk did before?
---
They are licensed killers, gotta make that real money.
---
Twenty onend.
---
I equip these but still go through the full process can some tell me how to do it?
---
No licensed characters can be bought with shards that way the licensors can always get a cut of the money
---
True, and I'm fine with that had the killer not previously stated he doesn't care for killer stuff just farming points for his survivors, which he said is his main, and then party dropping just a moment before dropping us.
---
I have been sacrificed before but once the agreed upon criteria or game rules are stated, and you party drop and turn, then I have a problem.
---
Imagine being this insecure about your life that you need to pick on people that aren't as good as you in something to feel good. You're fucking sad.
---
Night Shroud does not reduce his speed, at all.
---
that's such a subtle "fuck you" to the consumer to make no mention of that when the purchase is made
---
It's a win/lose.
---
Same but TDS butt fucked my internet on a Friday when they’re wiring up my house so I missed the entire weekend as well dude.   feels bad man
---
They only got the rights from the mask company not the movie company
---
Franklin's demise.....
---
Why do you hate people so much?
---
Lmao just press m1.
---
Second best gen-slowing perk in the game now, bar none.
---
They couldn't get the rights to the character so they got the rights to the mask.
---
They got the mask license not the movie license where have you been living for these past couple weeks?
---
&gt; Right but people buy it for that reason and everyone knows it.
---
Too bad for them, that's not the intended purpose. The intended purpose is to buy things you like your character to look good in, You don't get to buy something for an ulterior reason and then bitch when BHVR changes said item without asking or informing you.
---
Why would it be? You can just DC to derank anyway
---
Is it level 3?
---
Leaving when its a nurse
---
Because they only got the rights to the mask. Licensing is expensive and they just put Ash in, ontop of getting new Saw cosmetics. You just need to calm down.
---
Me too lol, I had some assignments and couldn't play I am gonna play tomorrow
---
omg what's this event?
---
When you can’t use the screenshot feature on your console/pc
---
i don't regularly update with DBD like I should. Plus i just started a new job.
---
Borrowed time doesn't help you if the killer still goes after you
---
If the survivors have that many points it can’t have been a short game
---
Bro
---
I can't wait till it gets punished too. Like I get if your connection is bad, or like your game freezes or something. But two people DC'ed yesterday because they got hit and just couldn't take the loss. Luckily, most killers I've played against have been nice and either let us win or I just try to make their experience enjoyable by letting them get as many points as possible.
---
If this happens find the hatch that always works for to fix it anyway
---
GG EZ LUL!!!
---
*Signed that all skills survivor who played the Haddonfield offering with Balanced Landing, MoM, and the instaheal.
---
**PS....the other 3 teamates in my party chat said GET REKT BABYKILLER!!!
---
Oh I see. You have to grab the player model to rotate. Never knew that. Herp derp my bad.
---
1 NOED; not enough ;)
---
It’s annoying to have to wait but at least everyone is running object of obsession. These are some the easiest killer games I’ve ever had
---
He's the same speed when shrouded for sure. There's no penalty for entering shroud.
---
Really Unlucky.
---
I can’t wait to get home and try him out, might wanna level up him first though. Don’t wanna get caught at high ranks with only monstrous shrine and unrelenting lmao
---
Just click and keep, then move you cursor
---
They could at least add cashier guy.
---
This is me during exam time
---
Well maybe it's a bug then but i have no shit stared at him for 10 seconds without breaking him out before. And if you are up above him at a window or something you can't break him out it seems. He needs some work.
---
That's means so much to me ty!
---
&gt;Survivors will now turn their heads where their camera is looking. This happens when a Survivor interacts with an object in the environment and when they are not downed or incapacitated.
---
So....what does it look like when they are facing the screen and looking backwards? I hope its like an owl lmao
---
Lots of things in this patch. 
---
Swing effects: Good stuff. More consistency for both sides. Should really cut back those “how did/didn’t that hit” moments. 
---
Pallet VFX: I guess the stun animation and sound wasn’t enough? Awkward addition. 
---
Vaulting change: That is going to make chases shorter in most cases since people can’t hug walls and get fast vaults anymore. Makes the shack less powerful and by extension makes Bamboozle even better for the longer loops. 
---
Art Adjustments: Not Bad. Gotta see how that KI change effects the information Legion gets using their power now. Hopefully it’s for the better because sometimes you get really wonky info off it. 
---
Map and Audio Changes: Good Stuff. More Yamoka tiles hopefully cuts the deadzone in the middle of the map. 
---
Emblem Changes: Hell yes. Now if you can run the killer while gens get done/totems get cleansed, you don’t have to worry about a suffering lightbringer. 
---
Perk changes: Very much needed. PGTW will be so much stronger now that you don’t have to immediately bee line for a generator after hooking. The other perks are nicely buffed. 
---
MoM change: Shouldn’t be a too big adjustment to get to. Now you just have to be altruistic to get that benefit. Makes the M1’s less punishing to hit people but STBFL is gonna be much stronger to get those hits in before people can get in range for protection/safe unhooks. Please start bringing Borrowed Time to help ensure your safe unhook if it’s in the killer’s TR otherwise you’re gimping yourself. 
---
Bug Fixes: God Bless. 
---
Audio Localization: Spirit is back on the menu boys. Stridor, time to take a break. Iron Will, time to actually equip you now. 
---
Ghostface adjustment: It looks like an overall buff if anything. Using. Your power pre-chase is the intended goal and being able to refresh a marked target is actually hella OP because you could just keep them exposed for as long as you want until you get an opening. Now the 45 seconds has to count and I’m okay with that. 
---
Overall, this looks to be a solid patch and hopefully we get to see GF mix up the killer pool. Also OoO is about to be used by everyone so get ready for that.
---
Dig it overall, but the weapon would probably have to be changed, since their theme is hunting knife type weapons.
---
HAHAH SAME ACTUALLY, But before that I played as legion and it gave me a bit of a advantage transitioning to ghostface because they have a sort of same strategy where you stalk or chase victims
---
I’ve thought of two possible solutions for this problem:
---
1. Make the gates spawn at a greater distance from each other 
---
2. Fill the gates opening bar to a certain percentage so that the survivor actually has a chance to open it on time before the killer gets to them when the gates are very close to each other 
---
What do you think, fair or no? Also I believe slowing down the timer would help for both scenarios.
---
Oh ok, that makes sense. I was wondering what the difference was between both of the insta heals
---
It’s RNG so you probably just have to keep going through webs and get lucky.
---
If I knew an A campbell Id call them up, "WAAAAZZZZZUPPPP"
---
It only does this for dbd
---
Ash was released without a Killer
---
Killers get a red tint on their screens when a pallet hits them :/
---
Wow, okay. That's kinda stupid. But thanks nonetheless! &lt;3
---
Or at least just a skin for his weapon those swords would be sweet.
---
All movie killers cost really money
---
Hey that’s pretty fuckin good. Best one I’ve seen so far. The coat is badass and the mask could work with other outfits
---
Use medkit on a down person use space bar on pc to use syringe.
---
That's their problem.
---
Yes, that and blocking a hit for someone.
---
\&gt; I'd turn my volume to max to be able to hear all the ambient sounds... then suddenly go deaf when a chase starts... 
---
How was that the case? I could play with speakers and still hear 90% of everything while the music (and terror radius) were totally fine. If I had a headset on, I could hear footsteps and everything else without any sort of issue with the volumes.
---
It’s not that bad of a nerf. Only thing that could potentially be an issue is pallets breaking his stalk but that’s why Spirit Fury and Enduring exists.
---
Yeah, it's a two factor thing.
---
One, double bp. Killer is easier and more efficient to get bp, so more survivors play killer instead.
---
Two, the new killer just dropped in like, the last two hours and everyone who's bought him wants to try him out, so there's even more killers to go round.
---
It's the same on Xbox too, and I presume pc
---
Really depends on the killer you're playing and the perks you use.   
---
Some general tips:   
---
* Learn how to mindgame. As a survivor main, you should know which loops are safe/unsafe. Learning how to mindgame could help you end chases much quicker.   
---
* Learn when to drop a chase and when to commit. If a survivor is running you around a lot or going towards a very strong area, it's usually best to NOT commit. 
---
* Don't be afraid to camp/tunnel. It's not the best strategy but there's times where it's needed to secure a kill.
---
* Watch some content creators. Whether it's Youtube or Twitch, there are plenty of skilled killer mains to watch and learn from.
---
I would say he’s middle mid tier around there maybe higher idk
---
We’re gonna live forever has entered the chat*
---
Unless you're up against the two stun perks survivors run.
---
An instagram thot
---
A game like this, I feel it is very important to have a lot going on sound-wise. Keeps you on your toes, keeps you immersed, it was a great blend of everything.
---
But now, the terror radius when the killer is behind the wall may as well sound like they're still 20+m away.
---
you have to update your game. patch 3.0.0 is available
---
Where can I see it? On patch notes doesn't say anything...
---
Stacking with their lower rank mates to go against rank 17 killers
---
I like your friend. I called the trapper " The bear trap dude"
---
GG my dude!
---
If survivors:killers ratio is skewed away from 4:1, there's nothing devs can do to help you get games faster, there're just not enough survivors to fill all lobbies
---
You missed it by a few months. Good luck having it show up on this reset.
---
Wait. Does he get stunned more when thrown out of stalk?
---
The next patch should be in the new week or so.
---
To each their own
---
My settings are made to where it updates automatically and it doesn’t show that there’s an update in the store either
---
&gt; mostly nerfed, such as the pallet change and change to his addons.
---
LOL ok,
---
Pallet Nerf: You think it's a nerf that getting hit by a large chunk of wood takes him out of stealth? really? you don't think it's a tad bullshit that if he gets stunned he can stay in stealth mode. Heres a heads up, if you get stunned odds are you're already going to be broken out of stealth because the survivor knows you're there.
---
The addon changes were to prevent broken combos like Montos recent video where he stacked ranged addons and survivors LITERALLY COULDENT BREAK HIM OUT OF STEALTH.
---
Like literally, they had to be inches away to even start. You're just literally taking anything and trying to use it to show how "BHVR HATE KILLERS".
---
NOT PASSED!!! Shared.
---
Play Freddy for an ultimate mind-game
---
What I hate the most about this chapter is that there is no new map or survivor. I know ash came out some time ago but still, we need new maps.
---
I downloaded the patch, uninstalled then reinstalled but I still dont have finger-guns.. How to I fix this issue?
---
I kinda hate him. I watched him over 5 seconds in the eyes and he still didn't get revealed, just because he was to far away(but he got the expose mechanic).
---
Name a perk you're dropping Enduring from anti-pallet build for
---
Damn, I really wish I wasn't rank 1 right now :'( Guess I gotta wait until the rank reset or sweat my ass off to get all achievemnts again
---
..
---
I figured there would be more survivors honestly buuuut I can still understand.
---
True that
---
OoO?
---
Yeah, sprint burst with any other exhaustion perk doesn’t work very well, I’d replace sprint burst with lithe or dead hard when you get the chance, or just stick to burst or balanced. It’s not a big deal it was just a tad confusing
---
Blood-webs have really odd luck. Example I have Empathy and it took till 44 for it to appear on my  Dwight while on the other side I had BBQ have all three tiers show up for my Pig in a row before rank 10.
---
I’ve done this every game with ghost face lmao
---
Not long lobby waits, killers literally have to wait to get in a lobby.
---
It's rarely happens, unless it's endgame, and you saving someone from the hook. How many times do you see someone taking hits for another person? Even if he gets tunneled, or it's his last hook, while everyone else wasn't hooked or we're hooked once. Besides me doing it sometimes I never see it happen. And survivors are always obvious about their intentions. If let's say you are doing gen, and survivor runs past you and you take a hit for him, well when it's most likely not mom. If you are following killer around, be the best damn runner in a game, because you are getting chased boi.

---
That is smart thinking
---
No, when he’s stunned by a pallet it will just put his stalk ability into cooldown, like if someone spotted him.
---
Are the upcoming changes listed in ingame as well or just on the forums, because not everyone who might buy the DLC necessarily reads the forums?
---
Practice
---
Try to hard reset your Xbox and then see if the update is there
---
Object of Obsession
---
Ah, I see
---
Not much of a nerf really. Stalking a marked suvivior I always thought was kinda stupid anyway
---
That's part of matchmaking process now, this was introduced in one of latest patches.
---
Oh... that doesnt necessarily seem the worst. But why?
---
If they all know I am coming I cant stealth. And with no ruin they will still pop gens like crazy. How do you practice that?
---
Uuuuuugghhggggghhgghhggggghghh
---
Poo on the meg mains that downvoted y'alls comments :p
---
It’s because no one wants to play survivor right now due to camping, tunneling, and a new Killer coming out.
---

---
Basically they decreased the precision needed to detect Ghostface, meaning you might start detecting him without even knowing he's there, they also fixed a "bug" that made Ghostface's detection inconsistent.
---
They also removed the ability to refill the meter on a marked target, remember when it required for survivor to loop Ghostface around 1 loop for the explosed status to go away? Now it's going to be 2.
---
And when survivor's exposed status does end, you wont be able to enter stealth mid chase and get a new one now that its easier to detect Ghostface, and it's a lot more consistent compared the 2nd part of PTB (apparently they fixed a "bug")
---
I hope we are also going to get a sale on the older DLC.
---
Sidney Prescott, from Scream.
---
Damn, ok. Thank you.
---
&gt; They have consistently made stealth less and less viable. It's part of our kit as survivors....
---
There's a difference between the survivor's "stealth kit" - aka urban evasion, quick and quiet, calm spirit, etc - and optional cosmetic items that cause characters to blend into the map without any effort.
---
Enduring is used almost exclusively for pallet stuns. You're gonna get pallet slammed 10x more than any other stun in the game.

---
Why? During double BP events it's always like this - more killers than survivors. And on new killer release? You can be pretty sure there will be even more killers.
---
That feels good and hopefully balances out
---
Hex: No One Escapes
---
New killer, practice, find a way that works for you in terms of gameplay, find perks that work best, level him etc
---
Literally haven't seen a single OoO since I started playing Ghostface
---
PS4 controls
---
I think the DbD Ghostface has a far cooler story than any of the movies tbh
---
&gt; A game like this, I feel it is very important to have a lot going on sound-wise. Keeps you on your toes, keeps you immersed, it was a great blend of everything.
---
&gt; 
---
Only in your first 10 hours playing DBD. After that, you will never be immersed in DBD again. 
---
All that is left are regulars or veterans players having to deal with obnoxious levels of audio and no way to tweak it.
---
Chase music was far too loud. Hook screams are far too loud and unnecessarily long. 
---
I even play DBD while listening to music because the audio does little to me at this point.
---
What killer would you suggest for a someone like me who is still pretty new
---
I’m guessing it’s because after the whole “Legion has no counterplay” fiasco, the devs started implementation more ways to counter killers. Things like pallets breaking Plague out of her corrupt purge and Ghostface out of his stalk for example. Not sure if I necessarily agree with these choices but it does add an another element of having to think before you act.
---
4 games in a row now.

---
Aaand jigsaw offering. 
---
It's hilarious as killer; no one can even snap out of it at maxed lullaby.
---
I don't know where to post this - but yesterday I had a game on Yamoaka where 3 of the 7 generators were extremely close together by the house. One in the main house, one right outside to the left, and one in front. The killer playing Huntress never left the area of those 3 generators. We were able to get down to 1 gen left but we were never able to finish. We felt at a complete loss after the game was over because the killer played the map perfectly but we felt like we couldn't do anything to beat her. Made me never want to play on that map again.
---
It's not an exploit, just the unbalanced power
---
This why I always bring a key ever since they reintroduced Killers closing hatch. It’s always the last thing they suspect lol
---
The only nerf is so you can't endlessly expose. Michael can't do that either.
---
They are changing the ability to rebuild the stalk on an exposed survivor apparently very soon, and yeah I agree it's pretty BS.
---
He looks so good since the PTB changes - I ply on console though
---
I know the perks, I just don't have them, and their one perk destroys my power.
---
I agree, ghost face needs a buff. Should be longer!
---
The sounds are mess up again for survivors, now  OoO will be more likely.
---
GG no funny chases and no mind games at windows because the killer will get you anyways.
---
I doubt he’d have an interesting backstory

Go to “My Games &amp; Apps” and look at the “Updates” Tab should come up with the update in there
---
PlayStation was suppose to get a solo blood point event for the clown incident, where Xbox and pc got the dlc and PlayStation didn’t. And then they gave xbox and pc another double bp event. They didn’t do it then, they aren’t doing it now. All platforms get it or none with them.
---
Dude its extremely easy to break his power.
---
Well yes but actually no.
---
While it is true that there is no grass to hide traps, there are SO many narrow paths you can place traps in. You can also place traps directly below holes so survivors get trapped once they drop down. There are myriads of awesome spots you can place traps in.
---
And yes, I did play trapper, I actually was a trapper main until spirit was released.
---
Yes, I've been playing on red ranks for a pretty long time.
---
That worked. Thanks!
---
So Michael can't keep stalking in Tier 3 and get good returns either so why should Ghostface?
---
Can confirm this. I was sitting waiting for a match for killer for about 5 minutes before I got bored and swapped to survivor. Less than 30 seconds and I was in.
---
No need to stunt on us that much, Dwight :(
---
Oh no, head on and DS are so scary now, oooooooooh. Guess I can’t tunnel survivors off the hook anymore or go near lockers /s
---
ARGUABLY ONLY  4 out of 16 killers are viable at high ranks. By high ranks I mean optimal survivors. So yes “BHVR HATE KILLERS” would seem very correct.
---
And plague can do it permently, Billy can so it with no cool down, leatherface has it aoe
---
The keep playing and get the perks? Lmfao. And its not like you NEED ruin to get somewhere with him. I didn’t use ruin and still managed to get 2k/3k for the first few times of playing
---
Rocking basically a full month outfit
---
What I do is I'll start another chase across the map when I hook someone because I run BBQ on all my killers
---
Same, except I can hear the chase music \*ever so slightly\*. I had the same thing happen in the PTB as well.
---
Which is why it bothers me they call it a chapter, it’s a paragraph based on their own lore, like Leatherface. Shit, even he came with another swamp map lol.
---
Oh my god
---
Judging by that trapper swing, r20 - 15
---
honestly object of obession shouldn't work when he's in his power
---
can you even unlock him? it only gives me the option to buy him for auric cells.
---
I like this nerf tbh. It was just a bit too hard to break him out of stealth. He basically was stalking around like a meyers because it was impossible to break him out while running away. His power still is going to be strong and he should still be able to preserve his stealth by peeking cover and playing smart
---
35 minutes
---
Nice I can't wait to play
---
My sleep schedule is already f*cked because of the event and now they extend it ._.
---
This is the best response I’ve ever seen ever
---
chances are extremely low. if bhvr wanted to, yes, but they most likely won't want to because that's how all companies operate, lower the money based on how old the dlc/game is. so my answer is no.
---
very smart, i got some turtle beach headphones and i love them i just dont know if they are the right ones to use.. i dont know if theyre like the surround sound ones or not
---
but it could be useful in some situations
---
But the visual effect they added is not on the survivor’s side, it’s on the killer’s side - it’s an obnoxious red flash of light. It’s already extremely obvious when playing killer that you just got stunned, more visual feedback was totally unnecessary.
---
“tRyiNG tO gET a rEfUnD” bro it’s not that serious...also this was done on purpose so you couldn’t buy dark cosmetics to hide you easier.
---
bhvr
---
Sometimes. Sometimes you stare at him for 15 seconds and it doesn't do shit.
---
It's not about what the nerfs is.... its just that i think they should have waited like a season to see if there is a need for nerfs....
---
I planned this way ahead even during Bloodhunt since getting Adept is still a pain.
---
Top of stairs and below the drops. They never see it coming somehow.

That p3 Caudette hiding in plain sight not doing gens while you are being chased for 3 mins only for no gens to be done.
---
Stealth is fine, blending in with a tree is not. Also her P3 is unaffected so there's that.
---
I bought it when it was in the shrine to use with doc 😎
---
u can do a lot against him, loop him, detect him( just look at him) and hide from high, unecessary nerf
---
They haven't done any of this yet.
---
Well, you had drift king on, and no one dead with 1 gen left
---
lame! I loved blending into the darkness.
---
Okay thank you!
---
You don't plain like dark clothes lol.  You wear them for stealth and you know it.  Those are literally the most boring looking cosmetics in the game.  We know why you wear them lol.  At least the other people on this post admitted that's the real reason they were mad.
---
Thanks (: those are good ideas , as bad as it sounds ... I don’t have any memorization of any maps :( but then again I never really paid attention
---
How was it negative to say I just wanted a survivor with the new killer perks Jesus
---
Wait, hold up, watch this. I'll show you how to format a joke on Reddit
---
[Sarcasm sarcasm sarcasm] /s
---
Leaving while you’re in the womb
---
I really hope they dig a little deeper into japanese culture for her outfits as well. So far it's been pretty cliche. lowkey tho schoolgirl outfit was a necessary evil lol xD
---
They really just hate stealth, huh
---
But blending in is the only thing we claudette mains can't do, otherwise we wouldn't be stealthy. P3 is pretty good now that you mention it though.
---
Stealth is good. Cosmetics with a much greater stealth advantage are not good. Most cosmetics are either brighter colours than default outfits or of similar intensity which is fine. But cosmetics that mean survivors can just crouch in a bush and be almost invisible are not fine. Stealth should be moving quietly around and using obstacles to block line of sight, not being perfectly camouflaged. Blocking LOS takes some level of skill. Using a perfectly camouflaged cosmetic does not.
---
Rip, the event hasn’t started yet.
---
Hmm....you know what? I'd like to believe they'd switch it up
---
It starts in 30 min. Rip
---
Is the event gonna start after double BP?
---
Stealth is more than hiding behind a rock. Keep eyes on the killer and rotate.
---
Yeah, I can't deny the looking at him mechanism is a bit...unresponsive. someone couldn't knock me out of it through the railing of the stairs in coaltower.
---
I felt bad one hitting him, he was pointing at me and all.
---
Idk, some sort of counterplay? To be honest, people screaming nerf just need to chill out.
---
You just ironically congratulated Behaviour for putting Ghostface in the game because everyone wanted him, but you were being sarcastic. It’s what people wanted, and they people what they wanted. Good on them! I like him and I’m sure many others do too.
---
It was extended
---
We had two different confirmations from the support desk in another thread that they do investigate these reports and that people can get suspended as a result. Doesn't tell us if it's common or even if it ever happened, but people need to be aware of the risk (and not throw a tantrum when they break the rules and get rightfully reported as a result).
---
I think 1 should be looked at, it's entirely RNG whether the gates spawn in sight of one another or not. If they do, the survivor is fucked, if they don't, there is a decent chance the survivor could possibly escape, depending on which gate the killer decides to scout first.
---
They extended it until the 20th
---
I don't even know why did they change this... Please revert it, it's really too quiet right now.
---
What a dick
---
They seemingly extended the Double BP for 2 more days and the new Event will start in about 30 minutes so it will overlap.
---
Well, the did say this in the last deveoper update:  
---
"Our internal tests are really promising; they are getting us closer to the 60 FPS goal. These changes will be introduced with the next chapter update. "  
---
So we should see some improvements.
---
3.6m/s is not the default killer speed at all, its 4.4m/s
---
If double BP lasts another 2 days that would be actually great
---
You might have had 4 BBQ stacks. Currently there is a visual bug where BBQ stays at 3 stacks even though you've hooked all 4 survivors.
---
Ahh I see your point. That makes much more sense! Thanks for explaining. Sometimes you physically can't move though and moving would give away your position.
---
A pallet that the killer can’t easily double back and hit you without you being able to get over the pallet quick enough
---
Again, how is the poor matchmaking their fault? They just want to play the game with their friends.
---
u mad lad?
---
Personally I’m happy this is a killer-only chapter. They need to spend less time adding characters and more time fixing the game and improving currently-available maps.
---
I’d say next year you’d better hope you have a better attitude and spend less time acting like a spoiled whiny brat instead.
---
Thanks first one
---
Aw shit, here we go again...
---
Yeah paragraphs of a chapter man, pretty unhappy with it all.
---
i never cared about anything less, give me my chub bud
---
On ps4, you can record the last 15 minutes by default.
---
how does this even happen
---
Pallets that can't really be mindgamed, because there are obstacles making for a long path around the place where the pallet is dropped, or there is a window nearby the survivor can use to extend chases.
---
It actually IS Nea who's guilty. I just represented it poorly here, lmao.
---
HA FIXING THE GAME 
---
Right. Sure they break the game more and more with each release they come out with. This game is never going to get fixed properly.
---
But there is little to no open space downstairs, so you can can cut off most pallets and narrow hallways and trap corners that survives like to dart around.
---
It’s funny as killer. But as survivor it makes me want to slit me wrists. ;)
---
Does Ghost Face have a bing bong?  Then no, he is not pointless...next
---
Yup. I watch a lot of Monto just because it's no meme editing, no bullshit, just pure, high-skill matches.
---
Listen, I'm super thankful for the work you guys do and I know balancing a game isn't easy, but for the love of fucking God, PLEASE prioritize fixing Head On.
---
It flat-out just does not work sometimes. And given how killers can grab a healthy survivor if they jump out of a locker and the stun doesn't work, it's a huge deal. It's my favorite survivor perk, and I would really love for it to consistently work.
---
Technically the 6% regression on missed skillchecks is active even without stacks. But I agree that it shouldn’t be shown until you hook someone.
---
He.
---
Isn't.
---
Even.
---
A.
---
DAY.
---
OLD.
---
IN.
---
LIVE.
---
Ouch. How fast is your Internet normaly?
---
I actually really like good stealth plays in this game. It can be frustrating if you get a team of survivors creeping around the edge of the map but good stealth play is a nice break from the usual bold survivors tbagging and unhooking before I even get to leave the hook.
---
I mean we just got wiped against a bing bong. 
---
He has unique gameplay in that his stealth form is fast and harder to see than ghost faces.
---
I feel you.
---
Yesterday in of my games 2 people just dc'ed as soon as they heard the first screech after a nurse blink.
---
I’m actually like
---
Nice Game lobby chat
---
Yea ok whatever you say bud lmao
---
MoM was busted though. Survivors get a free hit for playing badly and getting hit. I agree the perk is worthless now but the way it was before was ridiculous and should never have been put in the game in the first place.
---
I thought I was the only one. I'm streaming and I feel like I sound like I'm bitching too much over it. It feels strange or maybe it's just Ghostface
---
It takes me longer to find a game than the game itself.
---
I am at rank 20 ;-; . He is amazing btw you will love him
---
plague has timer with corrupt purge also she has to vomit on you to times to down also she has to get this corrupt purge only after someone cleansed himself so it takes time for her power to develop and compare it to ghostface insta exposed you start of game for 40 secs and then keep prolonging expose timer until he finally catches you . reminds me of broken legion when he was released
---
haha very true, people have been asking for fixes for 2+ years now.  I have lost all hope for the fixes we need in the game.  But I guess that is what makes it dbd :D
---
If by narrative spoilers there are none yet, they are planning on adding story content that will be unlocked through challenges later this year according to their roadmap.
---
Blah only played as him once and didn't get any hooks 😭😭 stupid corn map
---
Trapper is pretty good beginner killer.
---
i was under the impression the new offerings were survivor only ?
---
it happened to me , the update got in queue and reached 100% then the game atarted downloading 11GB and reached 100% and started again and now i can play
---
If the killer is mori spamming, its deserved though
---
Is there any other phrases used? I try to avoid toxic gameplay when I play as the killer. I know how annoying some of these things can be.
---
Same. During this bloodhunt I've managed to actually climb to Rank 14 as a survivor even though I sucked when I started. Now I at least manage to survive 3 out of four games :P I just got sick of waiting for killer matches, though I still played a few for dailies.
---
He will be out to purchase to steam later. Right now u can only get him from cells in game
---
Fuck. I done messed up
---
Yup they should work fine as long as you’re able to hear sounds from both sides then it’s good
---
I stopped playing for awhile, and came back 3 weeks ago so I'm not sure what is gonna pop up in the shrine. I can still hope though.
---
We talk about normal killer, who isn't spamming it
---
i mean its not cool but its not exactly the worst thing like, it ruins nothing for anyone, they would be dead anyway
---
I don't have ruin on my huntress so i have to run lullaby for now. It's actually pretty funny when i hit five stacks and suddenly there's noise at gens every 10 seconds. It's like without the warning they suddenly can't hit skill checks to save their lives.
---
People who can’t spell winning correctly
---
I’m legitimately shocked this passed console compliance. Those headaches? They’re caused by mild photosensitivity. If you have actual epilepsy I’m pretty sure the game has now become a seizure risk.
---
but its pointless, you lose rank, bloodpoints and show to the killer that you cant accept the lose
---
I never used it to begin with, it was already too much of a pain to get it to activate.  I might try it as part of an unhook build with WGLF but even then seems way too difficult to get it to activate now.
---
i even sent a dm to the person playing as feng and he said i never hooked him he said no, 
---
there is a chance we could both be tripping balls LOL
---
&gt;Only in your first 10 hours playing DbD
---
[I disagree.](https://i.imgur.com/Ndj42BI.png) I still get immersed especially because of the excellent sounds in this game.
---
Chase music being loud was an intentional design and it should be reverted. When you're in a chase, you should not be in full control of your senses, hence the music covering up most of the small sounds.
---
Hook screams too loud and too loud? What? How is someone screaming on a hook too loud? Even then, how were they too long? Most of the audio clips are cut at the end and sound sub-par because of it.
---
Yes, I will also play music while playing Survivor sometimes, depending on the mood.
---
What rank was that? Because when I hook one guy 3 gens pop.
---
You can be attacked for having that kind of wealth in every country
---
boi i literally don't have any relations with any non related to me girl. I would fuck every girl that's 5/10 or higher
---
I just got a 3k my first match playing him. Seems fine to me
---
Eh, not to the extent I had meant to intend.
---
Then DC.
---
Actually there are potentially grounds to request a refund because the item is technically no longer what was originally purchased.
---
I also don't personally think it's that big a deal, but there are reasons obviously hot things are sold with a "CAUTION: contents may be hot" warning label.
---
Wrong, everyone knows that no one actually dies to the plague...
---
i mean... they... are right kinda. i mean i stick with the game and i play it with my friends and like it but the stuff that should have been fixed years ago it's... still in it, and with new gigantic issues arriving every major patch that could be noticed after one game of playtesting, im really not so sure
---
I don’t think this is a stupid question, but do we have a release date on Freddy?
---
I can't play billy for shit, but about a thousand hours of fps practice as a teenager I can still flick very easily on nurse so she's not too bad.
---
I agree.
---
yeah i can!! i kind of wish I had pc though because i hear it is way more fun than console
---
lol except they don't listen to people when we say don't nerf ghostface and see how he actually performs and every rank(most importantly red ranks) then decide where to finetune him or nerf him. all competent devs do this, except these guys who release him and then say they're gonna nerf him anyway(freddy reminder?)
---
That's what I thought when I first saw someone post about this bug. I didn't believe them because based on what I know about coding, there is no chance that a cosmetic would mess with someone like this.
---
I was evidently wrong, BHVR continues to surprise us all.
---
Perfectly balanced perk that is designed to punish. Babykillers who camp and tunnel.  And that line about if they were good they wouldn't have gone down a single time was hilarious.  You should have just played this off as a shitpost.  It's basically just missing the flair lol.
---
I’m just gonna watch scream till I find a lobby
---
and take him the satisfaction though, thats worth gold for most i guess
---
Do we know if spine chill is affected?
---
Did they extend it to compensate the 15+ minutes lobby waiting time? :D
---
Use deadhard then. MoM was broken.
---
It's literally changed nothing about how he plays lmao
---
He's not garbage again, he's still around the same as he was after the buffs. It's barely a nerf as is, just a few adjustments.
---
I woke up early to squeak a game before it ended, saw that it was extended and immediately went back to bed.
---
The game feels a lot smoother but the menu feels a LOT more sluggish. Leveling up bloodwebs froze the display multiple times.
---
They’re relatively the same experience. I will say though that there is more variety of killers and survivors at high ranks on console than PC.
---
Yes, but do you know how easy it is for survivors to see the trap and disarm it on this map? You should know since you were a trapper main. This is trapper' s hardest map
---
Wow yeah, so Ash has 3 conpletely useless perks now. Wonderful.
---
you think so? ill have to try him, i play doctor, plague and pig they just may be to much for a beginner killer
---
schoolgirl outfit was great, it also kinda thematically fits since her survivor counterpart Adam is a teacher too lol, it's just that they could do so much more with her that I hope they go all out.
---
The creepy doll spirit and the ogre one someone else showed off are both amazing though.
---
I think they can get a lot of creative stuff for her if they delve into Yokai folklore too.
---
there's a deeper problem which im not gotta get too deep into, which pretty much those things existing in the first place (same applies to insta heals, and MoM's, keys , etc). with that being said, i tend to worry about other people game's experience, running those on double BPS is absolutely  selfish and people who run those usually dont care about making points overall, they will end the game fast and do a fairly low amount of bps no problem whatsoever, because thats the mindset of 'shortcut' users anyway.
---
***Very*** slight. About 8% larger than it is now (4% larger per side), and it's fairly small right now. It is still significantly smaller than it was when he first hit the PTB. This is purely a QOL change and won't necessarily make him harder to detect. It'll be a little more forgiving for people who have a hard time keeping their camera on the killer while they are being chased, for example.
---
The other changes to the reveal mechanic are not changing. You'll still need to see at least 20% of the killer to start revealing them (if you're leaning close to a corner, they won't be able to reveal you). There's still a buffer to prevent them from spinning their camera to detect you. They still have to consciously look at you to break you out of stealth, it's just a minor QOL change.
---
Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for the response.
---
Apparently his detection nerf is less than 10%.
---
How does Freddy counter it?
---
Really wish party starters were a normal item as they are fun to use and feel like your using a flash bomb
---
That is a cool idea.
---
He has a semi decent perk for pallets called brutal strength. Also he has unnerving presence that be run on Doctor.
---
In the next couple of weeks.
---
[Good Riddance](https://i.redd.it/gfp2bkqnrz121.jpg)
---
15 minutes
---
It's because of three things;
---
1. Killer ques are already naturally longer than survivor,
---
2. Theres a BP event right now meaning more people are playing killer.
---
3. Ghost face just released and even more people want to play him.
---
[Message the moderators if you want to discuss a moderator action.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdeadbydaylight)
---
That sadly is not an option for me. I just got leather face.
---
You have to consider that they would still only be one hit if they were injured making it more bearable regardless.
---
Thank you so much for the reply. Definitely buying now!
---
103% seems a bit oddly specific
---
Because you could litteely stand in front of them and be invisible.. Plus it adds pay to win which is bad..
---
Hatch is always closed during the endgame phase. Impossible.
---
There's hot takes and then there's dumb takes...
---
In your case, I agree. That is a fair point.
---
Also watch this video on chasing survivors. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ 
---
Helped me out alot.
---
i did hear that there are just a bunch of nurses and huntresses in super high rank on pc
---
Killers always have had longer que times because of many reasons. More suvivior players.. Have to find 4..
---
It allows survivors to avoid healing in the midgame therefore giving them more time to complete generators and it can be a lifesaver very often for people. It also feels really shitty to go against something like that.
---
Honestly everytime I've thought of the Tyrant in DbD, I thought of his power being that he is a 105% killer (so slightly faster than the player) who can break anything (walks through pallets and windows to destroy them and crushes lockers by interacting) without suffering stun (but windows and lockers would be rebuilt by the Entity after a few moments)
---
This all came from playing RE2 and thinking how cool it would be to have a slow killer that just menacingly stalks after you and you can do nothing about but run
---
Depending on the platform, Steam's big summer sale starts in a week, so if the game doesn't have a personal one, some dlc will probably be on sale then.
---
Pretty much a great update in general with very few negatives! I'm really disappointed by how they changed Mettle from the PTB and I really wanted it to change. Stricter requirements to encourage altruism and teamwork so stacks were no longer free and providing a tradeoff of protecting against a single instadown hit too was closer to what they should have gone with.
---
Changing it from that to only be protection hits and requiring being injured, granting no instadown protection hits just puts it into Left Behind tier. It's essentially the same as having an empty perk slot now.
---
I was disliking how it had pretty much become a default, standard perk in the same way Adrenaline is since it meant loadouts were becoming less and less varied which is pretty boring. I don't think this is the way to go about it though, I really don't. I'd stopped using Mettle so I could keep things varied but it is never getting used now!
---
The rest of the update seems pretty positive at least. I love a bunch of the changes on both sides and it's going to make playing both much more enjoyable. A whole bunch of perks got way more useful with this update! Now they just need to make Vigil useful 
---
BTW, I love the dark cosmetic changes. It always seemed a bit unfair in general and now some players will have more reason to try out cosmetics they actually like!
---
I knowww just a bummer is all
---
Just stock up the 1 mil BP cap and wait until the hotfix is released. Changing how he loses his power at all can make him another freddy, so wait and see how it actually works out once they push it live.
---
It’s been confirmed, the double BP event is two days longer now.
---
No.
---
As a heads up if you have OoO and your not the obsession there is a minimum distance you have to be from him to see. If your across the map and you aren’t the obsession it won’t work
---
Pay to win? I've tried standing infront of a killer and it's failed miserably. We're hard to see, not invisible. Plus, while we're hiding we're not doing any objectives.
---
Farm bloodpoints. Do it right it'll take about 450k-500k depending on RNG to get BBQ unlocked. Now you can play LF with the perk to get points faster but I don't recommend it because he's really bad and the only real way to win as a LF is to proxy camp and tunnel
---
Imagine people on this sub seeking attention rather than be helpful.
---
Yes, [cosmetics were announced for Pig and Tapp](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/68065/bookmark-cosmetic-reveal-mid-chapter-3-0-0). They seem to have gotten the go ahead for at least once franchise. No word on the other licensed characters I think.
---
*F R I C K intensifies*
---
He killed 3 survivors. He didn't fail. I bet if he moried her he'd be toxic too?
---
Yeah, I just kinda hoard them all so I can use them after the events are over because they’re not regular items but I love em
---
Well shit you ain't wrong.  That's kinda bad.  Maybe noob players but IDK.
---
PS4. People said to wait before for the anniversary sale, but so far nothing has happened
---
So I've actually never bought a single cosmetic in this game. The example I have was just that, an example. To illustrate a point. Someone might just like dark clothes because they're dark, because of their color. I personally have no desire to buy any cosmetic to look cooler or blend in or anything like that. I'm perfectly content with the default options.
---
Way to jump to conclusions though...
---
Yep, save a million and time finishing the dailies to when you reach the million and you can have almost an extra 90k points without jumping into a match.
---
I hate wall huggers to, but there's usually only around rank 20s as the higher rank you are you understand then gens don't spawn at walls.
---
I don't get it, isn't the guy being sarcastic because he knows there's no sidney?
---
He gets white robes if you buy the whole dlc
---
Dude you can't have a logically convo with these type of survivor mains. They just expect killers to let them go, call you trash if you do, and then diconnect when you mori or hook them.
---
Not really. There are no perks that counter a survivor crouching in a corner with black clothes on
---
U sure? People do it all the time deliberately to get into easier games as survivor
---
He does, no idea what it looks but I'm sure you can find it somewhere.
---
Its not hard to imagine. Lol.
---
I sure hope the other license holders see this and think something along the lines of "Ooh, we could make cosmetics too!"
---
thanks you so much !!! I will have to watch this!
---
This is following the PTB in which we gathered a lot of feedback and made some pretty sizable changes. One of the complaints we received a lot is that it was too difficult to reveal Ghost Face during a chase. You could even pallet stun Ghost Face without revealing him, which is a little silly since you clearly see them if you just dropped a pallet on them. These changes should have a very minimal effect on those sneaking up and stalking survivors, but should make it a little easier for survivors to reveal you if you are actively chasing them.
---
Current version goes against the spirit of his power though. He's not supposed to be another Myers, stalking you down mid-chase. 
---
His whole power is based around not being detected, if you're chasing someone already exposed you shouldn't be able to stalk the person running from you to begin with.
---
We do though. We normally have to more in order to stay hidden unless when the killer is chasing someone around us, then we can't move unless we want to be seen and hit.
---
What disappointed me was that we are not getting a goal for the anniversary event
---
No shit, he did dumb shit, but calling a killer greedy when that's part of the job is just pussy shit.
---
I didn’t see enough said about it, honestly. I mean, it was universally reviled but I didn’t see that many posts about it. I think too many people had faith that Behavior would just remove it. Instead, they didn’t see a lot of noise about it so they just left it in as is. 
---
And since I probably could have said this louder myself: that red flash is a seizure risk. The eyestrain and headaches people are complaining about? That’s mild photosensitivity. People who have full-blown epilepsy cannot play this game in its current state. I am actually astonished the patch passed console compliance.
---
You can't unlock him with shards because he's licensed. Either pay with auric or pay via store.
---
He was never top tier, when top tier is billy, nurse and spirit.
---
If the Gen is there then the shack is just a bit less safe/loop-able. It's still a great loop regardless. 
---
Besides, a player shouldn't be able to loop the shack the way they have, and this change removes the fast vault in the rancid map from the inside, which is bogus. 
---
Did you see the anniversary stream? Looping is being nerfed a bit, and the shack is super high value, meaning this change takes away a bit of value, but only when a Gen spawns in there. 
---
Maybe they will move the Gen. Who knows.
---
I mean I'd pay 50$ for a WoW expansion only for it to be unplayable for the first 5 hours lol
---
I literally just watched this episode the other day in the UK on sky
---
Oh thank God you posted it. I was so confused I didn't get my 4th
---
Shoulda said no one escapes map
---
I think they are just having a lot of trouble with sounds and getting them to work right.
---
No. Vile purge. It makes you broken permently for the entire game if you don't cleanse.
---
And so he stalks you.. Then get pallet looped
---
Is mettle of man only protection hits and not safe hook rescues?
---
No shit dumbo, but if I hook someone and literally 5 seconds later someone unhooks, you're saying I should let them go? I mean usually I let the just hooked one go, but like that's not camping.
---
I don't care about getting points, you're right. Why does anyone care? Just play normally, earn points normally.
---
All other sounds are loud AF compared to current chase music volume, like generators, hits, others survivors. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE when generator is louder than chase music.
---
That is cool I just wish we got a objective for the event :/
---
Explaining survivor to a new player is a difficult thing to do, as there's a lot to explain.  
---
First, finish the tutorials, both of them; they teach you *some* mechanics.  
---
Pallets are objects which you can use to gain distance on the killer and to make time for your teammates. A loop tile is usually made of walls and a window or a pallet, sometimes both; loop tiles spawn around the map and there's a cap on how many pallets can spawn per map.  
---
Learning how to loop is your best friend. You want to know how to turn your camera to always know where the killer is and know where you're going. You then need to learn how to hug loops tightly and loop efficiently, using windows and pallets in combination, using specific tiles like the "Killer Shack", etc. Next, you need to learn how to combine loops and tiles to make bigger, more effective loop tiles, this is a very advanced strategy. That's the basics of looping, I suppose.  
---
Hexes are totem perks which usually give the killer great power, but at a danger of losing a perk slot when it is cleansed by a survivor. The cleansing process requires the survivor to stay on a totem for a certain amount of time(12 seconds default, I believe). Some perks, like NOED, are only activated and take their Hex form after the gates have been powered.  
---
Survivors have some very powerful perks called "exhaustion perks",  you want to get your hands on one.  
---
If I have tips for beginners they'd be to get David King to level 30 for his teacehable "We're Gonna Live Forever", and learn camera movement.
---
White robes and a ivory handled knife
---
It was a stupid mechanic they baccally removed its weakness
---
&gt;So you just want to make it a second sprint burst that ignores exhaustion? I'd rather not...
---
Why not? It is still much more fair than being able to heal a health state. All perks have a chance to be a wasted perk slot so I don't see that as a valid argument. 
---
&gt;Theres a reason people like it 
---
Yes, that's because it wields an incredible amount of power especially when multiple survivors run it which is something you have to think about. One Adrenaline isn't bad on its own but when 3 or 4 survivors have it(which is quite common right now), it can completely screw over a killer's game(unless they use the also problematic No One Escapes Death).
---
haha no I wish, that would've made it funnier
---
Plus double means 203% for the next few days?
---
I dont mean like forcing extra points, i want to play normally, i hate farm games they are plain boring, but those games i hate even more :)
---
You say that, but honestly, a completely normal fucking cashier would actually be nice.  The entity keeps grabbing broken people, and famous people, maybe it's time we get a normal ass fat guy who just wants to work his 9 to 5, go home, drink, and masturbate to some variation of porn before going to bed fulfilled.
---
No I'm not describing myself, just ya know, *everyone has those days man.*
---
And I got suckered into buying Ash for it.
---
I know I'll get hate since some survivors on this sub think killers should let them go if they catch them, then they call the killer trash, and disconnect if they get moried or hooked, and they just prove my point.
---
Devs said patch is coming very soon to adjust the detection range
---
myers who moonwalk and nod their heads vigorously make me enjoy this game more
---
Happy green cheese day
---
Pretty sure he was poking fun at “Meyers”
---
And remember folks people say it’s always the survivor community is toxic
---
Don't worry he's getting nerfed to be easier to spot.
---
Bulldozer maybe?
---
I believe they extended for 2 more days
---
For lingo/terminology....
---
Looping - Running around a single loopable area with a pallet to buy as much time as possible in a chase.
---
God Pallet - The pallet located at the Killer Shack.
---
Tunnelling - When a Killer chases after one Survivor the entire match and nobody else until that Survivor dies.
---
Camping - When a Killer does not leave a hooked Survivor alone after hooking them and staying nearby until they are rescued or die.
---
Kobe - When a Survivor gets themselves off the hook by using Attempt Escape.
---
Sandbagging - When a Survivor actively sabotages another Survivor to try and get them killed (bodyblocking them during a chase, dropping a pallet on them when the Killer is behind them, ect.)
---
There's a few.
---
Anyone know what specific cosmetics got nerfed?
---
Yep.  Bingo, this is also why the costume is different.  Although I'll go *against the grain here* and say that I really like the OG Ghostface for his backstory of being a journalist.  Slightly morbid but neat none the less.
---
Everyone liked that!
---
also i searched online
---
They expire? Have not seen info of that. Is the event live yet?
---
I watched Scream 3 the other night and I'm finishing up Scream 4 to get in the mood lol
---
Tbh we will have to wait and see but if it IS like you explained than not to bad
---
It used to be that, then they changed it for some reason and literally no one wanted it
---
Yes, only protection hits.
---
I’m a little sad we don’t seem to have a objective this time around
---
https://reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c22e5z/bloodhunt_has_been_extended_by_two_days/
---
And I’m playing right now and it’s say 2 days.
---
Where do you see that ?
---
My favorite spirit submission so far
---
And who's fault is it that the system works that way?
---
We don’t? What’s the event then
---
Absolutely know one is buying what you're selling man.  Just admit you like to be harder to spot...I'd have so much more respect for your immersed ass if you were just straight about it lol.
---
He was tested live in multiple types of ranks with two different versions for a week
---
Honestly I love Myers, he's kinda a wholesome boi.  Who loves to kill.
---
r/21charactersandnomore
---
&gt;You are punished for using someone like wraith or hag
---
Hag is one of the better killers, easily top 5. I know that's not what you were talking about in this post, I just don't like seeing people do a disservice to swamp girl.
---
Do we have a start time for the event? I thought it would go live with GF at noon EST but I just went through 27 blood webs and didn't get any of the new offering
---
Press the key that you use for skillchecks while healing with the medkit
---
I agree should be a 4K
---
This has to be a joke.....right? Oh god, what a clown.
---
I am being straight in that I've never bought a single cosmetic.
---
They want killers to be good in red ranks though. I understand why it has to get boring seeing nurse and Billy every game
---
Literally all 3 of my dailies are for killers right now :/
---
I disagree that tanking one hit in a game qualifies as busted.
---
When dcing gets punished, imma nut. So many wasted moris on people who'd be dead on hook or games ruined by people leaving the team.
---
Yay so fucking hyped even though its so fucking easy to spot him just center your camera and bam spotted but hey make him even less viable
---
I’ve 4K with my leatherface 3 times and didn’t get the trophy because of the dumb emblem system
---
You fucked up man lol
---
I got it done already and I’m at the high ranks to boot
---
All I want is the leather daddy Cop hat.
---
Its listed as an upcoming hotfix on the patch notes.
---
I never argued against a situation like that, my response to the initial thread was the opposite problem from the killers side, survivors get a lose lose situation if the killer camps hard early game that's all I'm arguing against. Maybe learn to read and don't twist my words like everyone else does when I bring this up.
---
Yeah it’s gonna expire in 6 hours, it’s a really short event.
---
As a hag main, I can't wait to play 👹
---
Ah shit here we go again
---
I’m fairly sure they just completely busted audio because every killer I’ve played today has had almost no noticeable terror radius.
---
you can see them, they can't see you
---
I didn’t notice anything different, might just be a slight audio thing
---
It's called 3 genning. It's almost impossible to win if you 3 gen.
---
Lol I got you. I thought top 5 was nurse, billy, bubba, myers, spirit. Also I think the 110 percent speed is what hurts her for me, also her camera is so close to the ground.
---
I don't know what this is but I like it.
---
I’m talking about the anniversary event (i believe it started today but it may not have), not the double BP event. thanks anyway :)
---
I HATE playing as him. I have no ruin so they pop 4 gens in 2.5 minutes like it is nothing. i don't get to play the game I get one chase and then I see them leave.
---
PTB isn’t a strong indicator of how he will perform during the live version. The devs should see how well he performs at purple and red ranks before deciding whether or not he needs tweaking
---
try restarting your game. close steam and make sure every process of dbd is closed in task manager. worked for me several times.
---
P3 Clauds are not affected
---
He’s fine right now but the ability to chase survivors when marked and refill that gauge by stalking is just a little bit busted. But I’m having blast playing him
---
Glad to see people are really enjoying him, can’t wait to be able to play once I get home! What’s your current build on him?
---
what build are you using? he's taking me some getting use too but I am getting there
---
What the fuck?
---
It says started June 14th and went to 18th but they extended it until the 20th
---
LOL right?!
---
It looks like how you would if you were to look behind you now. Chin above shoulder, eyes all the way to the right/left.
---
It's not gonna be an owl, though I wish it were :( ^Owl survivor when?
---
Meyers trying to entice killer mains back now that there’s a new stalkyboi in town.
---
I admit I don't know how to play him, but now I have BBQ, Brutal Strength, NOED and Discordance.
---
Same problem here. No music in the main menu or during a chase. No heartbeat unless the killer is right behind my ass. No music when Myers enter and leaves evil within 3. The hatch also is very ... silent. 
---
I have also heard some weird noises similar to the premonition notification even though I am not running the perk.
---
Oh incels, making women afraid on the daily
---
Upvoting for the Paramore reference
---
Pretty sure this is it 
---

---
The game is better than its ever been. For the most part with each patch the QoL increases dramatically and the game becomes more fun to play. There are a few things here and there that are bad but they usually get fixed pretty quickly.
---
And no, there aren’t “issues that could be fixed in one game of play testing”. Tired of armchair devs thinking they know how easy it is to check and fix bugs, especially in a game with so many variables.
---
He's greedy because he dropped him for the hatch you dense moron. And don't pull that survivor main bullshit on me because I play majority killer. You're just stupid.
---
I'v had this too in the past and I'm glad I'm not the only one, I haven't had it in a long ass time. Disappointing to hear its still a thing, fucked me over so much :/
---
Ok but the real question is how are you liking that cosmetic? Does the body still have shit flying off of it?
---
Ok. This was the first time I've watched it in a while. I think the lighting may have been a bit better. When Jake was touching the wires together it seemed a bit different.
---
She should cosplay as Shirtless Michael.
---
He's talking about the anniversary event that literally just started, not the bloodhunt event.
---
That's why you equip Franklin's no matter what.
---
BHVR already released the patch notes for the hotfix, they're literally what i described. But people are in panic mode and think they're nerfng him into the ground. It dosent help that people like Noob3 and Tru3 are acting like children and whining that 'hes being nerfed'
---
No mither and dead hard will fix your problem.
---
No, the 3 Year Anniversary is what he is talking about.
---
Or or or.. they could have just broke the pallet...
---
Same lol
---
3 year anniversary June 18th to July 2nd sorry about that
---
That's the Bloodhunt. The 3rd Year Anniversary Event is different and should start today.
---
Its the same as every killers idgi. Y'all are so hateful, leave Lisa alone
---
And no you can’t buy it with cells
---
Brooooo can relate
---
In order to be another nurse or billy  (or spirit) there needs to be a learning skill curve. Ghostface is way too easy to just pick up and expose survivors and therefore he can't be too strong.
---
[this](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1502775242) guide will help
---
How do I get these??
---
I mean if you're not applying any pressure, sure, it's hard. But if you place your traps right and actually get into chases, they won't always have time to slow down and disarm them. And like Snowbender said, there's always the drop-spots. You've just gotta play smart. Not all maps are gonna be the same playstyle
---
Yes I know. I'm talking about as the obsession.
---
When people laugh about Clauds but p3 Clauds aren’t affected and you laugh in you black Adam francis outfits 
---
People if you want proof of the bs I can show it

Lmao, someone actually wants to win the game??? What a fucking tryhard, everybody knows that you should ***never*** try to win, ever. It's mean. /joke
---
As if sprint burst and self care are OP lol rank 20 mindset
---
Right!?!?  I kept yelling for them to break the pallet lol.
---
Its because 3 year anniversary
---
Oh so the event started now cool
---
1 Nurse, 2 Spirit. 3-5 is subjective but I'd go 3 Hillbilly, 4 Hag, 5 Huntress. I'd even be tempted to put Hag above Billy. Unfortunately I see most Hag players being defensive, trapping around hooks which leads to a boring game for both sides. I much prefer playing aggressively, trapping around the map in high traffic areas to catch survivors out. Gives a lot of map pressure when you can be everywhere at once.
---
Hey now!
---
Theirs to be honest.  Killers should be equal to the highest rank of the SWF period.  If you wanna play with your friends, fine, but now you gotta walk your friends through the minefield of Nurses.
---
And it's only theirs because most people know how to abuse the system which makes both them and the system assholes.
---
You’re a rockstar!
---
I don't edit replies unless there are spelling mistakes.
---
Got to say I’m a little disappointed we don’t get a objective or anything this event
---
What a life to live
---
Shouldn't it be a 300% boost then?
---
It’s possible that you being too far away is still the case. Some maps are larger than 72m across.
---
Besides that, assuming your going against ghost face, maybe his detection hotbox is still wonky and you have to angle your camera up a little
---
As a Hag main I'm wondering what the difference is ... did it really go up all that much?
---
I'm looking forward to finding out tonight.
---
This didn’t even address the question....
---
Also I could care way less about getting downvoted
---
So to steam settings and verfiy your game files
---
Agreed.  Or use the bloody mask / red mask to get the ULTIMATE look.
---
Be my guest it did go up a fair amount though
---
Thatd be super unbalanced though hahaha
---
I’m a little disappointed we don’t get a objective on this event
---
*When you accidentally press B while Dwight is evolving*
---
I simply asked, if it would make any difference to You. Because I can farm and slug at the same time and objectively, I do nothing wrong against the rules.
---
Really? Last night I found a match as survivor every time within 5 seconds of readying up.
---
He had brutal strength so he must off not wanted to get flashlight blinded a third time. He wasn't running dying light or any obsession perks, but an add-on that made stalking then obsession faster.
---
This is disappointing.
---
Is there no event skins like vigo's pupip claudette for example
---
&gt;new version of Blood Party Streamers, giving 103% extra blood Points
---
I thought it was a new version of Escape Cakes........
---
Honestly, just BBQ and do Hag until you get Ruin as a teach as you will never get a ton of kills otherwise.
---
Personally I just don't run Ruin because I have a moral objection to that cancer, so if you are cool with getting only like 2 kills a game, than don't run it.
---
I completely agree that it makes way more thematic sense for GF to be taken out of stealth by pallets, but it wasn't 100% free to spot Ghostface after a pallet drop before this change just cause the survivor had to spend a little bit more time looking back at him and give up a tiny bit of pathing efficiency. I don't think the changes are terrible, but I'd rather bhvr have waited before changing him any more
---
does this include ghost face?
---
Oh god I hate to be this guy and I may catch a lot of downvoted but here goes, I have to vent, I haven't been so disappointed with anything in a videogame in years... Calling a paragraph a chapter, and the "big celebration" is... the same thing we always had? I was excited to do anything else than the base game, only a tiny shred, but it was too much to ask apparently
---
Went ahead and removed this cause someone beat ya to it https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c25l2h/anniversary_event_is_live/
---
nothing at all
---
Pretty disappointed in this, ngl... I was looking forward to hopefully a new objective and some cosmetics.
---
http://chng.it/twmN8FSrGB
---
It's cause it's the 3rd year.  Get it?  It's Party Streamers but with a 3 so it's the 3rd year?
---
Ouch, even the replaced ones? I deleted one every day if I didn't feel like it and it usually gave me one for the other side...
---
would I upload "for 3.0.0" if it didn't?
---
Hes gonna need to buy some upgrades.
---
No cosmetics ooof
---
I know how hard it is to fix bugs, or at least i suspect it, but they changed a thing, it came out terribly, and they still pushed it. They didnt have bugs to fix, they had a bug they shouldnt have released
---
:) thanks
---
I love waiting 30 minutes to get a killer game.
---
I mean what do you want, to be completely immune for 1 minute after getting unhooked? That's just not how the game works, you have plenty of time to hide and/or run after getting unhooked before the killer comes back assuming you didn't get farmed.
---
I’ll still miss the slushee machine gens 😔
---
I wear bright red clothes and enjoy evading the killer without being seen. This change just means you have to have more skill to evade the killer rather than just picking the darkest clothes and automatically escaping.
---
Yup. I hated that I have to learn the other 2 perks that are huge garbo and I now I add one more
---
there is a place on the lerry's map with grass inside, claudettes are pratically invisible there, its way more than that but that is just a spacific one to help you understand
---
And the new anniversary items give 103% more BP for ALL players. Sweet jesus, it's a BP-fest for the next 48 hours!
---
A part of me wishes they released an objective  and had skins in pure nlack like shown in the announcement  images (Like the obe of spirit)
---
I forgot about huntress. I think your list is pretty good too. I only just recently started using hag and have had some fun. Just need to learn more tbh.
---
can this be a new meme please     
---
like post it to /r/youtubehaiku and make it big
---
Happend the same to me an hour ago, didn't modify anything either but this error popped up. Just verified the files and now I'm good.
---
Survivors can cry, they will not give a single fuck. You bought Ash! Cool, MoM is nerfed now. You bought skins! Cool, we have modified them without even asking your opinion. DS? Useless now. Loops? Lmao, loops are for noobs, we will nerf the "eazy loops". Palets stun? Nerfed!
---
We could make the list so long. If you can get a refund, do it. It's your money.
---
the amount of altruistic teammates feels like a bell curve to me. at low ranks survivors dont know any better and will give their life to get you off the hook, middle ranks survivors are too self preserving because they want to rank up, and at high ranks survivors usually know how and when to get those safe unhooks
---
Terror radius,  i couldn’t use self care or wiggle out, it’s all messed up
---
# Imagine this community being grateful for once. 
---
Gotta say I'm excited for this. We have an extended Bloodhunt, bonus bloodpoints on top of that with offerings, and we got Ghostface all in the same day!
---
Don’t, wait for him in the store. For the same price you get him and exclusive cosmetics.

---
To win you have to screw with your opponents
---
More bp, delicious
---
It's not a nerf.  For a couple of reasons:
---
* Getting pallet smacked SHOULD force you out of ANY stance, period.  If you are Fred, Myers, or Ghost you should lose your stance shit from the smack.
---
* Myers can't stalk effectively to keep Tier 3 going forever, GF can.  This is a problem as GF can, granted, only apply it to one guy, but he is definitely more powerful than Myers who's entire gimmick IS that instadown.
---
* The rest are so minor that the argument it's a flat nerf is a massive overreaction.  The other issue is that detection right now is wonky in the opposite direction from PTB where Survivors could find him for free, to where now Survivors can barely trigger it.
---
These posts read like someone who doesn't actually think about every other element in the game that GF is basically a mashup of.
---
I play for like 6 hours, get sick and tired of it, but then have the urge to play again less than an hour later lmao
---
Much agreed with everything you've said.
---
Can you please tell me how do I verify them? I got to that and saw nothing that looked as malware or anything. I tried repairing EAC from its setup and still got the error. I had to reinstall the game for it to work again, hope we don't get banned because of a false positive.
---
As once a slugging huntress I agree.
---
I main survivor.
---
Something something shirtless Myers, something something OwO punish me daddy.
---
Yikes. The point just flew right by you huh
---
This is so dramatic. You already hit them 3 times, so no, giving them one extra hit per game does not completely ruin the match for any M1 killer
---
these myers memes are giving me life.
---
I've been getting more since for the bloodhunt, people know killer gets more points, but otherwise no one plays killer since they don't want to get complained at for doing their job so it's 10 min for survivor for me.
---
Troy: I have the weirdest boner.
---
Go into steam properties for the game and there’s a button to verify files
---
Excited oinking
---
This has happened to my multiple times as survivor and killer. Currently only playing killer because of how frustrating it is. I’ll take a 20 minute que time over a glitch that ruins the game
---
Yeah its pretty bad man hopeuflly they sort it out quick
---
I’ve never tried slugging, gotta try it sometime. I have Knockout and Deerstalker, so i just need Nurse’s for the build.
---
I’ve been getting into some nutty lobbies.
---
Either legit rank 17-20
---
Or people who are deranked to 20 p3 every meta perk plus flashlights.
---
Adam is taller and all of his hair sticks out behind most low cover.
---
I didn't expect drybear to actually play DbD tbqh, keep doing what it is you're doing &lt;3
---
I literally bought Ash for mettle. Never used him once. Waste of money now
---
It's the anniversary event.
---
Moris give less BP than just killing a survivor the usual way.
---
The new lobby background looks like it was thrown in at last minute.
---
Yes, seems like i have to install an ironsight so i can snipe on his head...
---
What does this add? Except the balloons.
---
On huntress I used deers talker, knockout ruin/third seal and bbq.
---
Its really effective
---
Literally never using it again. Super pissed I bought ash for that perk and now it’s nerfed into the ground.
---
Oh ok, thx for the info
---
Nothing really. A bps rip off and 2 days extra 100% bp
---
right now I got him too LVL 39 cause I went super hard on getting really good add ons so I got furtive chase , unrelenting (because no other perk that I would use there rn) , thanataphobia and thrilling tremors.  I would probs change my build around if I had more of a chose. Idealy I would have Ruin , Furtive chase, Thrilling tremors and shadwborn for that increased stalk range
---
I just want to introduce my friends to the game
---
But no offerings... so its usless i guess
---
Mr - the shack is the usual place for the basement if you have forgotten. That is why that pallet there is called the god pallet. If that loop there did not exsist the way it is now the basement would be the most unbalanced place ever. I didnt hear anything about nerfeing loops. I heard only about changes to pallets. And yes you should be able to do that loop in the shack. You should not be able in many many places but this one - you should. It is how the game is designed. Around the basement there are AWAYS some very strong pallets/loops just to balance things
---
If just one person uses it, yep. If all 5 people use it, that game gives 615% more blood points for all. Plus since it's an event item, one or two should spawn on every bloodweb. Basically a super common Bloody Party Streamers.
---
I would prolly use my main Doc or LF
---
I agree it should be like how spine chill doesn’t work on t1 Myers.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
A new Survivor item (Year 3 Party Starters, basically a flashbang with confetti) and a new offering (Gruesome Gateau, 103% increased bloodpoints for all players in the trial).
---
The MoM nerf was suppose to include safe unhooks. This makes it a completely useless perk now. Strong survivor perks always get the sledgehammer approach while killer perks get the minor tweak approach. BHVR is as dense as rocks if they think this was a good idea for a perk most people paid money for.
---
Enjoy it while you can, he's getting nerfed in a day or two.
---
I know he's greedy and dumb for that play, but saying he failed when he got 3 out of 4 is salty survivor shit. Also, if he brought an ultra rare add on or offering like she has an ultra rare item, people would disconnect. If you play killer, you know people leave when you mori them even if it's final hook. Or people leave when you use an iridescent add on and waste the add on for you since killers aren't allowed to use powerful things they earn.
---
[This is what they did to the Terror Radius + Chase Music](https://i.imgur.com/TvvRNLG.png)
---
I saw this happen with a streamer. We all thought he was tripping balls. Three morid survivors and like yours, bbq showed 3.  The last survivor wasn't hooked, but option to mori pops up.
---
I remember a time when survivors had a long wait time.  But since all of the changes to killers, the swing to playing as killer has become a far better experience than playing survivor.  So naturally most people gravitated to the more enjoyable mode in the game.  Cant blame them at all
---
He lost the majority of his map pressure with the nerf to re-stalking already stalked survivors. It created fear and panic. Now people can hide their timer out and then know when they've been remarked.. Giving them a warning to go for loops aka a "Psudo-terror radius".
---
Lf is good but I suck at using chainsaws, if you're good at it
---
He can down people pretty quick and if you slug the first person, you can create good pressure
---
Idk what everyone's talking about, wait times have been fine for me
---
....there are offerings my man
---
Honestly you should just kill yourself on your first hook if you wanna DC like if it's THAT miserable. You still get what points you got and the killer can't get more points on multiple hooks and since you can get a 4k and still not pip you're almost guaranteeing the match was a waste if he was going for ranks.
---
Thats  not bad I have had a few 4ks and a couple of frustrating games but that's bound to happen with any killer dude. Don't give up because this game likes to spit in your face sometimes so just take a breather for 5 mins and then go back in. try using shadowborn if you need better stalking :) I believe in you
---
yeh I try and play without ruin sometimes but when I need BP its just a must have especially during events
---
Everyone is playing killer because they did a dlc with no survivor.
---
It'll be bad for a while.
---
Survivors have no idea who the killer is and could shoot themselves in the foot with this perk. Once the Ghostface craze dies, less survivors will be using this perk as there will be less ghostfaces and more of the other killers again
---
&gt; 10 points for sabotaging a hook within 10 meters of a Killer carrying a Survivor, if the carried Survivor then wiggles free
---
what ?
---
What part of this was the killer's job?
---
The killer's job is to **kill survivors as swiftly and expediently as possible**.
---
Meaning "pick this survivor up and carry them to the nearest hook - since I don't have to worry about strategic positioning for BBQ&amp;C or basement hooks because they're the last survivor - and hook them" is the killer's job in this clip.
---
"Let me pick up this survivor and then drop them to close the hatch first because I want bloodpoints" is why it's called greedy; he's not doing his job.
---
What are you referring to?
---
you accidentally didn't put the shitpost flair
---
His perks still shit?
---
what makes you say that? he seems kinda well balanced to me
---
So a GhostFace downed me and for some reason the recover bar didn't show up. Holding the button to recover also did nothing since I could still move while holding it. Another weird bug I guess... Kind of screwed the team over since I wasn't able to recover and they never had time to fully heal me.
---
This right here tells me that you're still relatively new to the game, so your opinion of rank importance is a little skewed.  Leather face is one of the worst killers in the game and you'll see why the higher in the ranks you climb.
---
Maybe you need to play a little more survivor to get in the mindset of it if you're having trouble with killer at your rank.  You can't really be good at one role without being decent at the other my man.
---
And also, if you're getting bullied by survivors with flashlights, why not use franklin's demise?
---
killer queue times are low cause everyone wants to play killer lol
---
My first perk was Monstrous Shrine.
---
I'm waiting for the next guy: I bought Ghostface and he started with MS.
---
Alas, yeah. Catch survivors in bear traps, level up Evil Within, and smack dudes I puke on. I just wanna play killer without waiting an hour.
---
Any killer will completely wreck at 20
---
I would not be shocked if those get released for cells honestly
---
Isnt "Paragraph" a  fan term  though? I don't think BHVR has ever officially called them that
---
You underestimate my noobness
---
I love it, although they'd probably want to change his frenzy animation since he wouldn't hold the pick like he holds the knife
---
Fam, it's 4%
---
Why use lithe and balanced landing though?
---
Do you have time to hide if the killer is using insidious and waiting for someone to unhook you. I'm not asking to be "immune" but just a bit of protection etc.
---
Same.
---
Same here I'm happy with the event. I'd rather have more bloodpoints then have to worry about a 2nd objective.
---
1. And 3. is fine but 2nd is fucking ridiculous that the devs still haven't fixed survivor's garbage BP gains after all these years, and every time a bp event drops killer ques go to shit.
---
And hag, and legion, and spirit, and all the other m1 killers
---
So let's recap: no new survivor, no event cosmetics, instead of releasing a complete chapter we get a mixture of Legion and Pig with recycled perks. More importantly we didn't get The Bee. BOOOOOOO!
---
Every dlc update ruins this game further and further.
---
You should introduce the new real killers, your 3 teammates on your team besides the killer.
---
Its time to put this game d9wn forever because it has really sunk to a new low.
---
You should make this game free to play of your going to charge people for everything btw.
---
Eh I understand why they're changing him now rather than later. If they wait till later people will get too accustomed to easy stalks and being immune from being broken out. 
---
Monto showed that by only using two addons he made it effectively impossible to be broken out of stealth, That's why BHVR are doing this now rather than later.
---
The Plag dude
---
It's not so far from what's happening though. Just saying
---
"Just hit them again 4Head" You know, that maybe works for spirit or nurse who have no problem downing people quickly. An extra healthstate against good survivors is CRIPPLING, the speedboost allows them to reach whatever loop they want unless they are in a super deadzone. So instead of getting a hook and forcing survivors to start heading to rescue, they can just stay at gens and finish the game while you are still chasing the guy that should've been downed by now. I dare you to try play against a 2+ MoM squad as wraith, or doc, and not want to feel like killing yourself.
---
...and you don’t think that’s underwhelming for a big anniversary event, especially with how much they’ve been advertising it? I mean we didn’t even get a real chapter lol, and no new skins? Why would you not make skins for a big anniversary but there were a variety of amazing skins just for Halloween?
---
And I...have...NOED.
---
I got it already and I’m in mid-high rank, just make sure to kick a lot of gens
---
To get better with hag trap the areas on the map that are the best loops, like instead of just plopping a trap behind the pallet in the killer shack, put ne on the window exit, one before the pallet and one in the center.  You get ten to work with so don't be afraid to use them.
---
I generally try to use them in a way that blocks the most obvious routes from the hook.  Like instead of just trapping at their feet, go for the nearest 2 pallet loops and place one on each, that way it limits their avenues of clean escape.
---
Not just ghostface for me, its everyone.
---
To sum up this OP everyone:
---
Ghostface is getting 4-5 direct nerfs, but stop complaining. Sure he's going to be worse than he is now, a killer that isn't even on Billy/Spirit level, but it's not like he's Freddy so that should brighten up your day.
---
Problem is. I’ve been through 10 blood webs. I have 10 party started but no event BPS. I thought we were suppose to get at least one per when. At the very least 1 per 10 webs.
---
You just listed all good changes except the skin thing. And how are pallet stuns nerfed? (Genuinely don't know)
---
Meh.
---
The extra BP is nice but meh.
---
There was a moment that they labeled it a paragraph on the website, that is no longer the case, it’s all chapters on their website now
---
You never said "if everyone is fine with farming it's not bannable" you just said that it's bannable and didn't say anything about everyone wanting to farm not being bannable
---
let me guess are you trying to play killer?
---
When it happens right when youre about to swing at someone thats vaulting but it doesnt work so you spam it and smack the window :(
---
Yep
---
Got a 2K!! because of NOED but still.
---
Dude you're totally acting like we never get anything.
---
Your level of entitlement is literally making you blind lol.
---
Sorry it's an been banned in America
---
I have it as teachable, I am not getting it in my 100 bloodwebs so far.
---
dedicated servers will not fix it everyone is just playing killer
---
OINK
---
Good play. Game is one of the worst trapper maos but lerys is worse imo.
---
Why are the offerings 103%? Isn’t that like kind of negligible. I’m surprised they wouldn’t go for like 110%, considering the event. Is the 3% noticeable?
---
Well fuck. I have a power outage and it’s been 1.5 hours. Who knows how long it’ll last
---
Even survivor feels strange to me
---
Nah you gain less points than hooking everyone multiple times
---
You are hurting my feelings. Please stop this.
---
No I’m not, you’re just virtue signaling.
---
For how much they hyped up the anniversary, there’s very little content. I’m not mad or anything, I appreciate what we got. But it’s like being told you’re going to get ice cream when you’re craving a banana split and then mom takes you to a vegan custard shop
---
Agree, I’m pretty stoked we have a lot of BP :) I wanna Prestige a lot of people.
---
Great job not reading what i posted.
---
1. his nerfs are more of balances. Stalking someone already marked to increase the timer effectively gives them an infinite exposed effect, combined with bloodlust and other perks this meant that you could never escape and will 100% of the time be downed.
---
2. being broken from stealth by being stunned is so god damn normal that i'm legitimatly surprised people are mad about it.
---
3. go watch some ptb footage. People were literally running towards survivors and stalking them a good 4-5 seconds before being broken out of stealth, now you actually need to crouch and lean to get a good stalk off which means he's an actual stealth killer.
---
4. His addons we're literally busted, monto showed in a video that using two range decreasing addons meant that survivors literally had to be within touching distance of you to break you out of stealth.
---
But nah, "MUH NERFS" am i right.
---
I remember going against a Spirit during EGC and she downed a teammate by a pallet. I dead hard past, slam the pallet down to stun her and give the downed random a syringe and we she was so mad she DC'd
---
We get cosmetics. Not now but we get them.
---
Right! I was so tense at the moment, but I can't help but look back and just laugh lol
---
He seems balanced to a lot of people, but the low ranked survivor-main devs think he's OP. Read the patch notes thread, he's getting nerfed in an upcoming hotfix.
---
Flip flop's not completely terrible... but it just isn't worth using in the overwhelming majority of games.
---
Killers are better for point farming so everyone is trying them for the event. Good luck.
---
Actually it's still possible to win against a killer who is 3-genning from the beginning.
---
The important part is to let them have their 3-gen and pop every other generator. Loot every chest to try and get everyone even a brown toolbox.
---
Pick the generator furthest from the others (probably the one outside to the left) and hide around it, though picking a generator exposed on at least three sides (if not four) is better. You can repair it faster than the killer can regress it and this makes the killer have to choose between camping that generator or resuming patrolling.
---
If they patrol you can pop it, if they camp it you can fade away to the opposite generator; you can also double-up on the opposite generators so that the killer has to chase you off because you're only two people and they need to check the other generators.
---
It's a bit tedious and against a Huntress someone is still probably going to bite it due to being injured and downed, but 4v1 over a single generator is in the survivor's advantage against most killers.
---
The artwork for the skin looks way more intimidating than it does in game. In game, it looks like a store brought kids Halloween costume.
---
That's your point of view.
---
insta heals and purple flashlights everywhere my friend
---
They nerf every strong survivor perk while buff all the killer perks. Lol GG
---
I love the noise the generators make when they’re done and OMFG CONFETTI YAYAYAYAY!
---
Having custom animations/sounds for completed generators or hook sacrifices is something I’d definitely buy in the shop.
---
thanks!
---
They stack. They’re slightly better party streamers essentially.
---
That's definitely not the case. We made sure to announce the upcoming changes today *with the patch notes* to avoid that exact situation. We want to make sure that everyone has the chance to see what will be happening before they buy him.
---
Though these are very minor changes, all things considered.
---
I knew this one would be a winner.
---
Where do you see that? Looks like the event is just this item and offering.
---
Except the Clow, but his description if fine like that, and yea, I played against all other killer, I dont know why everyone is so surprised, maybe at higer ranks they only spam the good killers?
---
No one knows yet but they release new cosmetics on Wednesdays so it’s worth checking tomorrow.
---
Must be where you live. I’m literally playing right now and getting matches within 10 seconds tops.
---
Wraith cosmetics should come out next week,Pig and Tapp cosmetics should come out 2 weeks before the next chapter
---
Source:the new skin backgrounds are in the files and they are in numerical order
---
Except that half the time it doesn't work. You stare him down for 10 seconds and he still doesn't break out. He's got some bugs need fixin.
---
not to mention the only new thing this chapter is the killer lol
---
you can't derank past rank 15. they haven't played in months to down rank to rank 20.
---
specifically the sound issues now, audio balancing makes me either not hear the killer or blows out my eardrums
---
They need to remove tiers on perks all together. That would solve most of the grind IMO. They already made it so a few killer perks basically work the same at all tiers, so just remove all tiers and make it one perk that costs like 10k bp. There's enough of them now (a bunch of vanilla and 3 per killer/survivor) that they don't need to make it such a grind.
---
I'll take your word on it, thanks for the info. It doesn't bother me too much unless he's still fun and 'semi' usable. As long as he isn't an M1 killer like what I heard from people about the PTB
---
He means the lack of ability to even get the other things in the bloodweb. They are not connected to the rest of his.
---
For real? You're screaming at him cus he wants a refund for the cosmetic he bought that he doesnt think looks good anymore? The whole fucking point of the cosmetic is to look good. If it no longer does that is entirely a valid reason for a refund.
---
Everyone is trying to play killer at the moment,
---
I'd like to know too tbh
---
Anyone else not getting any? Or a very small amount? I’ve been through 22 bloodwebs already and only got 1.  But I have 22 of the party starters. Man, can we at least get 1 party streamer per 5 bloodwebs.
---
Look around you a-lot i got him and he’s at lvl 15 already
---
I’m not experiencing any issues as survivor or killer at the moment.
---
Leaving after first down in PTB.
---
except it's the doctor.. oh no
---
*casually cleansing your hex totem behind you* that's fascinating
---
They didn't start adding them in bloodwebs till after 2pm(est) and I've gotten 1-2 in every bloodweb since then
---
He needs these nerfs his exposed effect makes him an even better myers. You can stare him down from 5 feet away and half the time it won't break him out. Not to mention the unlimited exposed effect in chases which is just completely broken.
---
really? weird... i mean i believe you, but its the first time i hear that, everyone else tells me they have the same issue... then again, people not having the issue probably wouldnt talk about it
---
Your point?
---
As a Pig main, i have to share my sufferance about this issue. Fight with me, brother &gt;:D
---
After a few games, a friend asked me "hey, is your Mettle coming online at all?" I assumed it was a glitch with the update but nope, big fat nerf of a change
---
It's because 3rd year anniversary. They don't want to break the oh-so-precious bloodpoint economy, so it can only be 103%
---
And killer mains whining.
---
\*Thrill of the Hunt activates\*
---
\*teleports behind you\*
---
OwO what's this? Cleansing totems now, are we?
---
The two equipped exhaustion perks is bugging me, why must you do this
---
I started buying after they added the anniversary stuff. And only got party starters. The drop rate for the streamers is terrible if this is what was so great about the anniversary.
---
Can anyone confirm the footsteps can actually be heard again ?
---
Also very true. Many people feel like camping AND T-bagging now at the same time.
---
I wanted Randy, nothing less would have sufficed.
---
Damn, nice.
---
On killer I dropped a million and got 17
---
He’s not that much taller and I can show a pic of him doing a bs totem
---
I mean farming is boring but like?? Just move on then. You aren’t forced to farm or stay
---
Haven't played against him yet, but I did just have a game where a survivor and I were staring at each other for a good while. I wasn't building up stalk and he wasn't kicking me out of stealth. Only a few feet apart and nothing but a chest-high wall between us.
---
Annnddddd they nerfed ghostface, amazing, down another tier he goes
---
Did you spend your points on a level 50? I plan on using mine on a character that's lower level hoping for more items.
---
and I just found out you do not even get the event items in every blood web this is so damn lame
---
The burnout is real.
---
what's your point? the perk is actually balanced now instead of being a "hahaha fuck you perk"
---
It's not a very heavy nerf at all. If you go to their forum post it has it at the bottom of this patches notes.
---
I buyed from ps4 store and Cant play him!

Have you been out of the loop recently? A Mettle nerf was announced a couple weeks ago.
---
I
---
It needed this. Otherwise you punish the killer for not camping.
---
Don't stare at your gens, look around and directly at him when you see him.
---
I run Two types of Doc
---
1. Impossible skill check doc
---
2.Big Cock No Shock Doc
---
Guess I lost it in all the Ghostface disappointment/hype
---
I can tell you this you do not get it every blood web so you prob will not get that much got to say this is lame
---
What? That's not how it works. The lower the queue times, the less of that team there are. If it's low, that means there are already a ton of survivors waiting for a game and not enough killers.
---
It was too loud and would drown out important sounds.
---
Man that's shit :( I'm sorry.
---
Ya he's a bit buggy.
---
That made me laugh lol thank you
---
My trick for Pig is to slug. This almost guarantees that survivors won't be able to search jigsaw boxes while the trap is inactive.
---
Did you play the PTB? I think the Mettle nerf was in there.
---
Also killer has superior bloodpoint gain compared to survivor
---
Ya that sucks indeed.
---
you get mettle at level 40 though? So how does making him P3  make any difference to that
---
I wish instead of nerfing blendettes they gave some killers camouflaged outfits too, I was hoping ghostface could be the claudettes of killers.
---
ya this is the worst event I think we ever had idk if we can eve call it a event
---
Jokeface is a joke. 103% bloodpoint offering? What even is that? I love this game but the devs need to understand marketing. Don't build up a three year anniversary event for months and then deliver this. Total blue balls lol
---
Yea, instadown helps a lot with slugging id imagine. But chainsawing people is pretty situational, and you get to do it pretty rarely.
---
Everyone is playing Killer right now because Ghostface just came out.
---
I hope they revert it.
---
That's insane!
---
Thanks for the tips. Yeah I always saw hags trap at the survivors feet and it's so expected. When I played her, I put it on the way to the hook and it worked out better.
---
He's out now.
---
Why do survivors all ways do this. I've gotten annoyed because a swf group runs me around, but I don't msg them to shit talk, but once I down one of them they get pissed off and say that I'm a trash killer, or in solo-survivors they dc and call me an asshole.
---
I P3d him because he's fun to play imho, and I love the voice lines and cosmetics, but after putting all my BP into him his best perk got that nerf. Not literally the reward for getting P3, just voicing a little disappointment
---
That's why lf sucks so much.
---
I have so much respect for lf mains (the non campy ones)
---
Rest in piss
---
Wait the game is gunna be free to purchase for pc?
---
Hag is awesome.  At my rank she's so awesome that I have to back off on the traps or the game ends too fast.
---
I stopped trapping hooks so that people can perform a successful save, if I trap the hook it all ends too quickly. 
---
Inalso understand that Nurse isn't great on console due to aiming being less accurate.
---
It's called balance
---
I doubt it. Certain people in this game will never stop being toxic. You know she's going to continue to shake her head no at every kill, and tbag. Next time, she just won't walk away like she did.
---
Why not replace the pick with a swiss army knife?
---
Ah thanks
---
Would it have killed them to make it 2 proctection stacks? Like wtf is wrong with having anything remotely strong in this game? 
---
They did such a good job with the DS rework. God forbid survivors have anything worth using.
---
I get those in the same match. Pull off the longest chase I've had in awhile and see theres still 5 gens left, no ruin. What were you doing the whole time!?
---
More options, plus Balanced Landing opens more loops even without the speed boost.  My main build uses Lithe and Dead Hard, it's not that uncommon.
---
That feel when your Ash Dlc purchase become useless… wait no ! I still have Flip Flop !!!
---
What happens why i look directly at him
---
With the fact that everyone will probably be burning these frequently that would be so broken lmao. I’d love it but that would kill the tedious grind the devs have set up.
---
America of all places? Isn't it legal to literally carry handguns into public areas over there?
---
Does anyone have an idea of when the new cosmetics for Feng and Huntress will come out? I thought they'd release when the Ghostface chapter came out but no new cosmetics :(
---
We all know this game is FAR from balanced. Nothing agaisnt the Devs fyi, ik it is hard as it is to balance.
---
Resilience got its vault speed back??  If so I’m happy
---
Everyone in the world is playing killer rn.
---
fasion trumps practicality, unless you're a claudette.
---
I believe on the anniversary stream they said they he'd be coming out around midchapter of the Ghostface chapter (12)
---
Holy hell i love this so much
---
Why is this getting downvoted
---
❤❤❤
---
MOM IS FUCKED. If protection hits count they should include safe unhooks. It's necessary to sand bag now
---
Disgusting 😂
---
Spent nearly two million 
---
Got NONE
---
yes… don't ask why
---
&gt; I have received a fairly vague answer from the Dead by Daylight support desk 
---
&gt; You know, factually pointing that out backed up by so far two responses from the support desk 
---
Okay dude. :) Like I said, if you're free to do gens and leave then no one is getting banned lmao. Idk how many times people have to repeat that shit for you to get it. If you're not being hunted down by your team and the killer to farm against your will, then fucking leave. Keep reporting them if you want but I'm just letting you know it's not going to do shit. In the 3 years I've been playing i've never heard of anyone getting banned for that reason.
---
And I suggest you stop being a whiny bitch about this and let people have their fun for 3 days a couple times a year. 
---
Get over yourself.
---
I don't use leather face and don't want to buy him just for the good perks even though it's really tempting. I said flashlights but I understand they are more acceptable. I put leather face since with all the altruism going on, he punishes that but I forgot about huntress. I'm rank 9 as killer and 11 as survivor. When I play survivor, I never tbag unless I save someone from a face camping insidious killer. I think that deserves hate but otherwise, when I play killer, I give people a chance to get away so tbagging is pathetic when I could've just been mean and got u immediately.
---
* Reposts within the last 60 days are not permitted.

The desire sensor is doing it's job right nothing out of the ordinary.
---
Lmao, that is completely the Trappers fault. He blames the key when he had the win in his hands lol
---
To sum up this latest post by the OP:
---
Customer: Ok what changes did you make to the Lexus?
---
Mechanic: Ok buddy, we've fucked up the rear-view mirror, the engine is now making a "clicking" sound when you're in second gear,  I would really suggest don't hit the breaks too hard on slopes, all in all we balanced it to be as good as any mini-van money can buy. You're welcome.
---
This is awesome
---
"Yes try hard" Mate if you were trying that hard you wouldn't have started the endgame.
---
They should have just hooked you and they deserve the loss for not doing so.
---
Thanks Ill check it out :)
---
As a non survivor main
---
If you kill survivors swiftly you'll black pip or depip due to winning the game too fast.
---
Happened to me, we were literally face to face and i got exposed ;( i hope that gets fixed soon
---
I was literally just standing two centimeters from his face AND POINTING AT HIM. Exposed. Slapped.
---
Thatd be nice but killers still have a huge advantage in the BP grind
---
Darn. U had me in the first half, ngl.
---
I'm hindsight, yeah you're right. I'm sorry
---
*gives you my purple flashlight* please sir, I just want some bps
---
True, I mean I run myers and doctor mostly cause I have the most success with them. When I play Billy I feel bad sometimes cause I get some bs chainsaws and only 1 get gets done by the end of the game. I like hag and I was planning on just using her tonight to make people mad they brought object of obsession for ghost face.
---
You mean Jokeface?
---
Still, you would expect a country that allows the carrying of guns to allow a short scene in a TV show
---
Honestly it makes me upset that these guys will find anything to complain about instead of looking at the good. The bloodpoint event was extended, we got a new bloodpoint offering that comes out in bloodwebs more than bps, and a new killer. No matter what BHVR does it seems like the community will complain about something.
---
I love the endgame, personally
---
It's the bLoOdPoInT eCoNoMy.
---
I havent played dbd in like a year and a half, back then they didnt approve of stuff like this. Is it legal now? These icons look absolutely sick and would love to rock them
---
We will fight together, we may not win today or tommorow but by leaving a legacy we become immortal.
---
Everyone is F tier other then wraith bc no Bing bong
---
Th other skins like Wraith, Feng, Pig, Tapp and others. Some will be released during the event.
---
You can they've got a fair deal of hit-score points - an entire bar filled and half of another; while it indicates a somewhat mediocre game, they were probably actively playing for a good chunk of it.
---
Yea played against my first prayer beads Spirit yesterday. Definitely scared the shit out of me being pulled of the generator without notice 30 seconds into the game, but also felt so cheap considering I had my back to a wall and there wasn’t anything I could do to stop it. It seems like it was meant as a SWF counter as unless you’re in a chase you basically have no idea where she is, but non-SWF she completely stomped. Only had one gen done and the people I got paired with were actually pretty competent for once
---
You have to center your screen on him. But he has addons that can make it so you have to be pretty close to do it
---
What's the matter, don't have any actual arguments so you resort to strawmanning and ad-hominem?
---
What a pathetic person you are.
---
He had real life issues lol. He can easily be banned saying that word.
---
*offers you my purple flashlight* please oh wise killer, may I have some bps?
---
Least he’s honest
---
ok?
---
I don't know about PS4. You should submit a ticket.
---
que times like hell
---
I know he was stupid. He could've hooked her and went back to close the hatch. Also, if you do too well as killer people fucking disconnect and call you toxic. There is practically no way to play as killer and not get chastised in some way.
---
Did they lie thooo 😂
---
If they remove that they need to buff ghostface in other areas, because he'd become weak
---
these appear more often in bloodwebs
---
What's more important than good auditory knowledge of how close the killer is?
---
I'd rather have a hype 3 year anniversary event then a shit summer one, what's the point of it if it's just extra streamers and some fireworks.
---
Two killers is too strong.
---
"fires up that bing bong" :D
---
Ok move along
---
Maybe I will then! What’s stopping me is it coming off as toxic. I don’t wanna sound like I’m all high and mighty, and they are an idiot. I genuinely just wanna let them know Incase they don’t lol
---
Well as you can tell I didn't put much effort in censoring their name haha
---
And this is why a lot of new players won’t keep playin lmao
---
They are not that frequent so far :(
---
Looking at your flair... Britney Spears?
---
I thought this was supossed to be a celebration very big and stuff...

8 minutes you must be very lucky my killer wait times are about 15-20min
---
Btw, the stun is shorter.

"Mr G. Face is it? Well sir that's not the winner's name we have here..."
---
With enduring?
---
Those are just new skins though? There aren’t any actual event skins that I’ve seen...
---
I use it quite often and it definitely needs the nerf
---
Add 4 more survivors
---
you're obviously not getting the point of the video, the doors are spawned literally right next to eachother and the killer can just look back and forth, attention to details
---
She's like "I need gears man! Do you know how much these boxes take to make and I've gotta set them up EVERYWHERE!"
---
Eh
---
Uunngg I'm really hoping im off a little early to grab these
---
When you get outplayed, but blame it on luck. Sounds about right.
---
I turned messages back on and a salty guy told me not to spam my power as Ghostface 😂
---
same problem
---
Good. No one wants another camping oriented killer.
---
Think neon party skin like that one skin.
---
The extra blood points are nice, but there is no comestics or extra objectives.
---
Pretty plain if you ask me. Especially more so since its the 3 year anniversary.
---
lol I’m joking man. Event goes into July, double BP for another 2 days
---
Absolutely ridiculous. Fix your game. This is incredibly annoying.
---
What I mean is that when you're on a generator, you want to look right at him, or if you can't see him, keep looking around as you repair. By looking straight at him you drain his power, and he wont be able to mark you, stopping him from one hit downing you.

---
It's not one hit though, you could activate MoM multiple times through matches by healing up in between hits. Even if survivors don't use it twice in a game, you'd literally have 4 survivors that you'd all need 4 extra hits for because they would run MoM.
---
Or more than just aura issues. i’m playing as Michael right now. I have unbreakable on. Well after getting hit by Michae stage 3, I could not wiggle nor recover
---
I’d love to see gameplay of you against some of the top dogs if you’re so much better than everybody lmao.
---
Spent a million bloodpoints got 4
---
Don't worry your good ol' killer mains took care of that and spammed all possible dbd related forums with their whining.
---
Just like shopping on Amazon.com
---
I'm just crying they couldn't give ghostface a blendette outfit, now without blendette, how will we justify having a camo killer in the eyes of the devs? :(
---
Enthusiastic*
---
They don't charge for everything though
---
Oh ok, does the character have to literary face him , or i can look around ( using 3rd person)
---
No its a nerf, you can't stalk while they're marked anymore, which was a good tool to increase their timer
---
Trust me, even though our teammates got more competent at the end, it was rough at the start. I was in the basement on my first hook \[thanks to being blocked by Jane's big ol' booty lol\] and the Jake kept looping him in the shack and wouldn't let the Kate save me, and made me already transition to the second stage. One hook in, and my next one was my death.
---
She must've heard your breathing. Wow.
---
I've done it, I've had this for a week now
---
You probably were toxic for them to react like that
---
I know dbd, and 8 percent is huge man
---
that was the point of it though
---
right now it's nearly mute and might as well not exist
---
Nearly every game I've played against Ghost Face has had this problem. I even dared it on my most recent attempt where we stood face to face and the breaking of his power didn't even begin to trigger before I was marked and downed.
---
This is utterly ridiculous. How on earth can we go from one extreme of him being too easy to spot to now being night on impossible when we're stood in front of him? Coupled that with the sound volumes being utterly screwed up *again* and this is frankly terrible.
---
I’d say having unbreakable on The shape is a massive bug alright
---
I’m playing on PS4 it might be PC only.
---
Actually it's 3. Lithe, BL, and dead hard.
---
Rather than thinking this will encourage players to do sabo builds, I see it more as just giving an appropriate reward to those that do.
---
I get max 1 per level 50 bloodweb. They are very rare.
---
If only they were available for consoles
---
Anyone else having any problems with the game?
---
Downed Survivor Aura not showing up. hooked survivor auras not showing up
---
Oh and for some reason after getting downed by Michael. The game would not let me wiggle out or recover. I had Unbreakable too. I Could not do a single thing. What exactly was in those 10 gbs I waited an hour to download?
---
Meant high, my b
---
Survivors can T-pose after Death, BE plz nerf-
---
I didn’t notice dead hard, that bugs me even more now
---
Rip you man.  That sucks.
---
This can only work if you have coordination. Which you dont ever have with randos. 
---
So unless you are in discord with your other 3 buddies, RIP.
---
If you want to test him, go into a KYF match. Don't flame people for wanting real games
---
People said that about decisive strike, and yet I see 3 of it every match.
---
You have to center your camera not your surivor and you have to keep it for 1.8 seconds
---
No, Im so bad that Im unable to pallet loop
---
You can pan your camera around to look at him while your character looks wherever. As long as it is your camera that is directed at him, you're fine. Just keep him in the centre of it, and pretend you're playing against a very, very quiet Myers or pig
---
I mean DS helps with tunneling what does this help with really? you need to waste time by getting hit and heal 3 times just to be able to use a perk that will not even help you with a instant down
---
Anyone know what the "adjustments" coming are?
---
Now survivors can learn the game instead of relying on crutches
---
Oh ok , thanks so much for the help!!
---
You obviously never played killer whIle all 4 survivors are running mom
---
I tried Doctor and Trapper, I'm better with Trapper because ... traps ... but I suuuuuuuuuck with Doctor.
---
I don't really like the other killers, no offense intended to others of course.
---
Wait I f I crouch The traps dont trigger?
---
I'm willing to bet that it was pretty rare for the same survivor to benefit from MoM twice in one game, let alone any more than that.
---
I'd argue that anyone having that much issue finishing a chase has bigger problems than MoM.
---
Well... this was likely one of your first games with Ghostface and you literally only have one perk and no add ons. Did you expect to do well anyway?
---
And you can, but it shouldn't try to even out the scores and just go with whoever has the highest score out of fairness for killers who have to deal with SWF.  I've been a rank 8 Survivor and whenever rank reset happens I'm basically the biggets piece of shit bully ever, now imaging a 5 and 6 who can basically carry the game on their own vs a killer of rank 17 with jack shit for perks.
---
I will also state that I doubt these players are "New" outside of the 17 as getting to rank 12 either means you have a good character already set \[Meg, Claudette, Dwight\] and leveled significantly OR you have good teachables to go with them, and in this pic it looks like all 4 have one or more teachables.

From another thread:

&gt;PonyHit Mentally Handicapped Pigeon 1 point

&gt;16 hours ago  
---
&gt;"if everyone agrees and wants to willingly want to farm, then it's ok. If someone doesn't want to do it, then it can be grounds for suspension."

&gt;Asked about it yesterday and that was the answer.
---
And as for what you asked:
---
&gt; Idk how many times people have to repeat that shit for you to get it. 
---
There is just no amount of repetition that will make me believe falsehoods like that. You are quite simply wrong and that you keep covering your hears and repeating the same thing will not make me join you in denying reality because it disagrees with my feelings.

This is a discussion where one answer is objectively and factually true and I'm sorry to tell you, you're not standing on the right side.
---
K I L L I N G  I S  W H O L E S O M E
---
yeah that might be it, its terrible on PC for me
---
Possibly. I would have checked the locker too if a gen was that close to getting done and a survivor nowhere to be seen
---
No, its free to test. After the weekend the access is revoked. Its so if you or your friends not have the game to test and decide if you want to buy it.
---
I stopped caring about this crap ages ago.
---
I’m saying that he IS more oriented to camping due to how his power works  at the very least proximity camping but the more he’s around whoever he downed the more effective he is 
---
Which seems to counter the anti camping vibes bhvr has been giving off
---
Oh yeah? The 3rd birthday thing goes to July? Nice. I saw the BP are extended 2 more days (yay because long work and long lobby wait times and DC)
---
Well without the chainsaw hes just your normal m1 killer, so not really good or bad
---
Lol bruh, you don't need no offense. Killers have strengths and weaknesses.
---
I'm a main killer and I agree with u.When I get humiliated from a SWF, I try to play against them again with a better killer and put a mori on it, solved.
---
Its a very small minority that play the ptb
---
Survive with friends needs to be removed.
---
It rewards you for taking hits to protect others. Combines well with WGLF. Before, it simply rewarded you for getting hit, even without Any plan or skill.
---
Survivors have to be at a certain distance before they can spot ghost face. Addons can affect this btw
---
No but I played killer a lot before DS got nerfed and tbh that didn't bother me that much either.
---
I have been playing for a few months so this is my first event
---
they removed chase music?
---
It seems every patch an addon gets fixed that was broken and nothe working the entire time
---
Broken addons? Like?? Instaheal? That's the only thing that's even close to be called op... brand new part is wack...
---
Killers have way better addons.
---
Its still there. Its just supposed to be quieter so it doesnt blow out your ear drums. 
---
And frankly, i like it..it makes it creepier.
---
After the event will we still find the new survivor item in chests or the bloodweb?
---
BHVR told us "we don't care, as long as EAC doesn't ban you, do what you want, ask EAC for more info". we asked EAC and they told as "we don't care as long as it doesn't affect gameplay, ask BHVR for more info"
---
You know I would think this event would be fun but no it's not. People just play worse, not playing the actual game, farming, running around until NOED is ready and trolling. You can get alot more bloodpoints by actually playing the game instead of immediately unhooking your friend after he's hooked.
---
It'd be more balanced with safe unhooks and protection hits but needing 4 stacks. Now its just terrible
---
They listed the pallet change and the other changes as a hotfix that will come later.
---
Oh I totally misinterpreted that lol. Yeah it's p annoying, 3/4 Ghostfaces I have faced have been scummy campers or tunnelers.
---
I'm not angry lmaoo
---
 Just stating facts..
---
It’s because it’s a double bloodpoint weekend + new killer. It’s always like this around this time.
---
Hmm... you may.
---
ya the old one was a problem but this new change just seems like no real reward for doing all of this and again I still doubt ppl will use it much anymore but we will see
---
It was TOO loud before.
---
Everyone wants to play the nnew killer so killer lobbies are going to be really long.
---
^^jesus, ^^i've ^^seen ^^resident ^^evil ^^games ^^with ^^less ^^keys
---
118 now, no ruin.
---
Same for me. I had 1. And I’ve been through over 30 bloodwebs now. Also wglf isn’t letting me get a 4 token no matter what I do, flashlight save, pallets save, or even a safe unhook. I just farmed a game and it would not proc the last token.
---
Does that crash their servers? Damn
---
They are such amazing creatures, disappearing in plain sight
---
I know but if you're gonna make risky saves run bt with wglf drop selfcare..
---
he has to be directly in the center of your screen, you have to see 20% of his body and look at him for 1.5 seconds straight. it's till glitchy tho
---
post a imgur of it
---
Sometimes I'm standing on the other side of a window and they can't break me out, but I'm also a low rank and ghost face is new
---
Unless the killer is using ruin and Ghostface while certain bugs exist
---
leather daddy cop
---
With how broken the sounds are, Killers struggled to hear things. Because every patch seems to mess with the sounds, the devs lowered the chase music until they can come up with a definite fix.
---
My computer died right before the Hallowed Blight event began and I wouldn't be getting all of my parts un til after. Still a little miffed about that.
---
Same! I have been saying the same thing.
---
Did you see the white outline and hear the sound effect? Was he leaning or crouhing? Did you aim at his head?
---
Well quentins perks suck so much hes not worth it
---
Last night I've downed the last survivor of the match, and he broke my hook right after I found him, but he was too far from he hook, MAYBE I could hook him, but didn't wanna take the risk. So I left him on the floor and gone for a cold beer and watched him being sacrificed by the entity after I closed the hatch.
---
Posted the video and many main survivors got salty, saying that I could hook him easily, but even If I could, I wouldn't, He was pretty toxic along the match.
---
It's super common to be stuck in "searching match" as killer for 10 or more minutes, i don't know if they did this on purpose or they messed up something, i can't understand why it is still happening.
---
Idk about u but I always get fast games as killer and survivor and I'm on PS4, doesn't really matter my rank either. Guess I'm just lucky.
---
As someone who plays as both survivor and killers (killer by day, survivor by night) both sides seem to get more and more toxic with worse behaviors. Like u said survivors t-bag and flashlight click, d/cing and it gets out of hand. But when playing as survivor u will also notice that killers aren't much different, u generally see more tunneling, camping (no I don't mean hook protecting and simply finding the person who got unhooked cause everyone else is sneaky), head nodding to taunt ppl and hitting someone who just got hooked 2-4 times to also taunt as well as d/cing themselves which most that do pull the plug so it doesn't count as one. Basically what I'm saying is both sides are the same when it comes to the "moral code" and "complaining" idk how much survivor u play but it doesn't SEEM like much, keep that in mind. 
---
Generally either side I play I show sympathy. If I'm killer and they go down fairly fast, I pretend like I'm looking for then and let them get some gens in, or hit them then pretend I lose them. Also like u said I sometimes give ppl a hatch or farm with them. As survivor, if I noticed a killer is having a hard time I will gladly farm a little at the end an let them kill me, unless they pulled dumb plays like chasing one person all game they k ow they can't get or camp/tunnel one person, only then will I not feel sympathy, and yes depending how toxic the killer/survivors are I too may or may not t-bag/head nod at the opposite side. 
---
Basically moral of my story, please try not to get so upset and try looking at it from both perspectives. Survivor and killer sides of the community are so much at war all it takes is one game to make each side in a bad mood resulting in them taking their anger out in the next game, which usually brings tbags, flashlight clicking, camping, tunneling, d/C's, etc. I'm not saying u are wrong but I am saying BOTH sides have bad manners and have moral grounds that both sides this k that the opposing side SHOULD have.
---
Does monitor and dead rabbit stack?
---
His nerf isnt even that bad of a nerf. Its littrely just removing a rather  bullshit mecinaiac and making it a bit easier to reveal him since its a bit hard.
---
No it’s just the fact that everyone’s playing killer and there aren’t enough survivors to quickly get killers into matches.
---
Do you remember the 4 windows? If not, shut up.
---
Thats the thing lmao, I don't know the name to find it
---
Just like all the other movie franchises, sequels get made just to milk more money out of a great movie.
---
Only had 1 after over 30 bloodwebs on a p3 50 survivor. Also anyone else not having their wglf give you the fourth token? I just farmed a game and nothing made it proc. Safe unhook, pallet/flashlight save did nothing. Got the protection points but no token.
---
Tomorrow I'm writing a test on 132 different birds that will ultimately decide whether or not I will have to study during summer, and after it's done I'll have all the time in the world to do shit.
---
*But screw it, let's dick around with ghostface and look at memes on reddit!*
---
LOOOOOOOOOL laughing so hard here hahahahaha
---
Noed on a killer that exposes survivors?
---
This is probably the case, as is with Quentin
---
I like it I hope killers also get it reduced.
---
They are hardly nerfs anyway..frankly i think it shoudlve been this way.

What I want to know it how she actually saw you.
---
Yea, and people are already overreacting to it too, thinking they nerfed him into the ground and he's useless.
---
You actually did the right choice, the view of suffering salty survivor, who hasn't respect to you is literally one of the best things in playing killer.
---
I can see why it needed to be a ps plus game.

So when is Party lobby system and dedicated servers coming?

---
You have to center the camara on him for like 1.5 seconds..and you need to have most of him
---
I guess that is true, and it is you’re decision after all. I’ve never been in that situation before so I wouldn’t really know. I was just giving my two cents.
---
Look at yourself in the mirror again and ask yourself:
---
&gt;Am I being stupid?
---
There is no universe in which it would make sense for you to assume I've been talking about **reporting players under unsportsmanlike behavior for farming** in any scenario other than one in which **you are part of the game and you did not want to participate in that farming**.
---
Read this carefully: You can't use the report form at the end of the match if you weren't part of that match.
---
Take your two neurons and slam them together until they assimilate this concept.
---
I am legitimately beyond baffled by your stupidity, I am sad and disappointed more than angry, unless you're just trying to somehow be right under the most obtuse technicality known to man, in which case you're just irritating.
---
You can see the pure confusion in the way she walked up to the exit gate lmao
---
I appreciate that devs do not waste time or resources doing that
---
She probably didn’t. Just saw a gen close to getting done and assumed I went in the locker. Killer main big brain
---
Killers actually being to hear things without having to struggle.
---
You can also look around.
---
uh..... you just made me imagine the clown dressed in nazi garb with little "zyclon B" bottles that make a blue cloud. hahaha
---
Thank you kind sir
---
yeah ok, but all the bugs?
---
Do we know when he drops in the stores?
---
Huh. Noted.
---
Party streamers that are rare to none at that. Basically it’s just stupid party starter fireworks.
---
I might be dumb but how do you do it on PS4?
---
Is bbq and chili bugged right now? After hooking all 4 survivors it only shows 3 stacks?
---
it's not just chase music though. injured music, the TR music, the ambient music, fuck even the MENU music is basically mute
---
Done both. Sometimes it's quick sometimes it takes more than 10 seconds. Give me a few hours I'll post a video link if you don't believe me.
---
r/murderbywords
---
That's actually pretty cool. I was wondering if they'd clip with the other hoods if you mixed and match. Given they have the license from the costume company that owns the Ghostface likeness and not just Scream as a film, the potential for future cosmetics is **INSANE**.
---
Wtf are you on
---
*third* anniversary
---
You didn’t state any facts, you went on a tirade of assumptions. Do you not know what facts are?
---
The extra 3% is because of the 3 year anniversary. They're tryna' be cute.
---
Is that the red devil stuff?
---
As a piggy myself I apologize for the toxicity this pig showed, and on behalf of the pig mains I pass her on to the leatherface mains
---
I like how you ignored everything I said and just went back to restating your same (wrong) point.
---
Ghost face? What are you talking about?
---
He’s out now, I’m in a lobby waiting for a game with him.
---
and make the game easier for the billy and harder for your teammate, good job 👍🏻
---
IT DIDNT WORK
---
The only killer to get out through the ringer was Freddy.
---
Yeah that threw me off then I realized it’s because of the 3rd anniversary
---
I saw that too but only with corner of my eye, now i know what it was.
---
Yeah! I was breaking the Ruin totem and I knew he was behind me. He was just stood out in the open and I was looking right at him
---
You only have relations with girls that are related to you? You nasty.
---
Let us stun the killer with a pebble
---
Your pic doesn’t prove it’s unplayable
---
I mean kinda yeah.  Jason is more wholesome since he's doing it to force Camp Counselors who don't actually do their job to, ya know, do their job or die since Counselors boning was why he drowned.
---
But yeah, Michael is a quiet wholesome guy when he isn't systematically murdering people.
---
Wraith does get faster movespeed then Ghostface in his stealth, can still used it if hes looked at, and it can help him in a cahse with the movespeed. 
---
We all know wraith is kinda bad though
---
I'd have to agree. Even if it was just a few reskins of something that we have already, I'd be happy with just that. Feels like 0 effort went into this event.
---
Well 1pm eastern means the majority of people in the USA are working.
---
A killer who:
---
1. Is not as good as Spirit/Billy currently.
---
2. Can have his power taken away from him by any survivor looking at him.
---
3. Can be screwed by downed/hooked survivors (aka survivors who are completely helpless against all other killers)
---
4. Has shit perks across the board
---
5. Can be fucked all game long by Object of Obsession
---
does not need nerfs AT ALL.
---
I bet you people who are champion "balance" aren't going to say a thing about downed/hooked survivors taking away a killer's power. I bet you'll be real quiet about that. Balance to me means taking away something(s) from him and giving something(s) to him. So we fundamentally disagree on what balance is. Balance to you all is nerfs, and just nerfs.
---
Wouldn't want to risk adrenaline ever being useful, no definitely not
---
It doesn't take 30 mins to find a match as Survivor

I used to run BL, DH, and Lithe with Vigil. I don't understand why people would be bothered by it its a great build,gives you plenty of options.
---
Yeah. And I've never seen that offering before, so that was cool
---
Isn't that just his black suit that comes with the DLC on Steam?
---
All the survivor lean down when they're cleansing. I mostly mean to say that when he's just regularly crouching.
---
No. But people are also overreacting calling it a nerf when its BARELY a nerf to anything and he even gets a slight buff with the killer insintict event. 
---
You are over reacting, but its also a nerf sure. But will it acaullty change his gameplay? No. Not really.
---
I'm gonna have to uninstall now
---
STILL doesn't change the fact that no one has gotten banned for it. You do you kiddo, but it's not going to make a difference. I'm done here.
---
If you’re still complaining about Legion after the rework then it says a lot about you as a player
---
Pebble does not need a buff.
---
It is already op.
---
this is very true, in some states you do not get to remain anonymous if you win stuff like this. The major loophole is they do not require you to show your face just that the check awarding is public. So it's actually extremely common for people to hide their face with ski masks or Halloween masks. 
---
People will not hesitate to come after you if they recognize you and know you won 1.3m recently.
---
I was thinking of buying him the other day. Glad I held off.
---
are the new party steamers still usable after the event?
---
Oh yes open Microsoft paint and 5 minutes later a whole new hud color scheme is available. Big waste of time, I deserve camped and tunneled for even suggesting such a thing.
---
I mean full on staring him out, after i suspected something was wrong i was following him all game to test it out and its 100% broken, even the devs have recognised the but and are trying to fix it
---
yes but as Killer
---
Well in this photos case, it was 158mil in Jamaica.
---
They also have the cosmetic contest which is part of the anniversary celebration, that should bring out an awesome cosmetic I’m sure
---
I collect BJD’s and would sooo love this, amazing job!
---
What's better?  A flat stun reduction of 50%?  Or stun recovery duration of 75%?  Trying to determine whether Enduring got straight nerfed, if it's better at recovering from pallet stuns now, or if it's unchanged as far as pallet stuns go.  I realize it isnt going to work for other stuns besides pallets, but I'm wondering if the new enduring is better at it's one job than the old one was.
---
I’ve had two ghostfaces who camped me, one who played the game normally and unfortunately for him got gen rushed, the poor guy he and I were meming and my team was just like “nah”, and then another game the dude baited me by pretending to be fucking around and then instadowned me when I joined in thinking he was cool and then i proceeded to be left to die on first hook
---
I really want to buy him so I can be the memelord of a ghostface I wish I could face lmao. Even if I’ve had a few bad experiences already I love him, can’t wait till I get to play him he’s gonna be so fun. 
---
How’s everybody else’s matches been?
---
He’s getting a rework because of that
---
Man I am really loving GhostFace!! I saved 1m bloodpoints to level him up and got lucky with perks!! My build so far is Enduring, Spirit Fury, Ruin, and BBQ!! Still trying to get used to the stalking but got a perfect game a bit ago!!
---
Thank the entity
---
I haven't seen a single ghostface yet and it's starting to piss me off to play against fucking billy and nurse try hards

Top o' the mornin' to ya

*Tips mask
---
Is there a joke here
---
I meant to say against
---
He can explain it to me until that clown wig becomes permanently attached to his head but I'm just going to keep telling him the same thing over and over again. You're not rewarded for late game kills. It isn't bonus points. Those are the points you get. You don't get anything extra for killing after the EGC has activated. You're being mildly punished for not completing your objective before the survivors complete theirs. The only time you get full sacrifice points is if you hook the last survivor before you close the hatch and only if EGC isn't active before they're hooked. It's only 250 extra points. Honestly not even worth it.
---
This is all in the patch notes from when EGC was released.
---
I mean have you ever played against black hag? 
---
survivors get very little to add to their gameplay whereas killers get a whole new kit and power every chapter. Cosmetics that add to a little extra stealth imo is nice and it really doesnt bother me as killer. If stealth wasn't nerfed every patch the sure itd be an issue but killers have plenty of anti stealth counters to the game. This is nit picky but to each their own.
---
U're insane, man.He's right, If I paid for a cosmetic, I want it the way I paid for!
---
I've bought some cosmetics, like the red suit for Hillbilly, if they changed it for Yellow, I'd totally ask for a refund!
---
How is me being dead on hook harder for my team?
---
I personally really like it because it doesn't contrast with rocks and concrete.
---
Helps with carrying your team if your SWF with 3 friends worse than you.
---
This happened with a Brigitte cosmetic in Overwatch too
---
People like this need therapy
---
*please be shirtless David please be shirtless David*
---
*FUCK*
---
So again, it's not the players fault. It's the bad ranking system.
---
You know there are multiple teams for ex. Art team working on the game
---
Is this a shitpost? If you only have 6 hours in you can’t counter shit haha
---
Hey just a quick heads-up if nobody told you already, but one of GF new add-ons is the wrong color!
---
Damn if thats the case then I missed out when I bought just Ace instead of the Hag to come along with him
---
It should be 300%
---
Okay serious question.
---
Is GhostFace good at getting bloodpoints? Is he the next Doctor/Legion?
---
Asking because I'm stuck in a office and away from my PS4.
---
AGGGGGHHHHHH AHHHHH!
---
Only with enduring, It even has  VFX animation when the killer is stunned tho.
---
Knew something was off
---
3% more than a BPS? Wow...
---
Hag traps don't trigger if you crouch, and can be burned away by flashlights.   
---
Trapper traps will still trigger if you are crouching, but since you move slower you'll be more likely to see them/see the "Disarm" option before you trigger them.
---
Even better! No more lazy recolors like Kate bbq shirt lol
---
That why you look down while you crouch
---
Fair point
---
Buying Ash for Ash is good enough.
---
Im asking for advice.
---
I have a bad habit of mistaking her for a survivor and just walking right up to her. I guess that's cool for her
---
Also, i forgot to add today :,D
---
What level is it?
---
We're overreacting? The devs didn't even care to see how the killer did against red ranks. They intended for these nerfs to go through before upon release. Didn't even give it a week, just "ooh shit the killer is good against low ranks, better nerf him". And as for most survivor mains - they would be perfectly ok is all killers were Leatherface-tier killers.
---
The only people who overrated are survivor mains and the devs.
---
My bad. Completely changes the dynamic of the question haha
---
I saw plenty of SWF charging it this way before anyway.
---

This art: Dark and emotional tone, interesting camera angle, amazing shading and contrast, great figure drawing, intruiging perspective, good color pallete, so much expression on Yin's face, and I applaud you for being an am!zing artist!
---
You're doing yourself a disservice by not having bbq available for all your killers or the option of Franklin's demise when you see 3 survivors or all of them with an item in your lobby.  You don't have to play him but 2 out of three of his perks are awesome and none of the other killers have more than one good perk for the most part.
---
Yup, sorry.
---
...
---
*pleased gurgling, joyful edgy teen noises, elated vacuum cleaner sounds, upbeat tiger roar and adorable squeak, elated heavy breathing, enthusiastic metallic snaps, ecstatic vomiting sounds, happy wheezy breathing, and staticky giggling*
---
They should buff it next patch to be 2 tokens. MoM was skillless and OP before, and I like the direction they went with it, but it does seem slightly undertuned.
---
Its only a visual bug you still get the 4th stack
---
We Call of Duty now
---
it’s a visual bug. you actually do get the 4th stack
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie.
---
Thats just a really bad killer.
---
u can, but its bugged, ur getting the stack dont worry, its a visual effect bug
---
It’s unplayable for me, the chase music is too low and heartbeat covers it almost completely
---
ghost face is shit on survivors end. you stare straight at him and nothing happens until you’re exposed
---
This is completely different, that makes sense. This isn’t a color change, it’s lightening it up a bit so it’s not pay to win (which some dark cosmetics felt like) get your head out of your ass man come on. It’s not rocket science.
---
The only counter to Claudette invisibility is Freddy's sleep aura.
---
People have actually reported for gentapping? That's beautiful
---
The support desk stated that people can be suspended, you say with confidence that it never happened. I'm interested to see the source for your statement.
---
You had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
One survivor should not be head-and-shoulders better at hiding than every other survivor.  Survivors should essentially be more-or-less equal with only items and perks making them different.
---
Same. I can’t play right now the chase music is way too low
---
It was making fun of toxic survivors lol....thought I laid it on pretty thick on that all skills part...
---
For real? I mean that's definitely a bug but that's a damn good bug. Have you checked vaults?
---
this is so sad, can we nerf sharp hand joe?
---
It’s really finicky at the moment. So don’t spend too much time trying to do so or he will just stalk you.
---
Also, you’ll get a scoring event when you succeed, that way you can tell when he’s out of stealth.
---
Other then that, he’s new to most people here. With time we’ll all adapt.
---
P3 isn't that bad it's her green and blue shirts that are the killers.
---
Its just the format
---
It's a color change, mate.From black to gray, I should say it, c'mon man, wake up!
---
Maybe Jendenise should focus on not DCing constantly and being generally toxic. Because any opinion she has sounds stupid.
---
They want all survivors to be essentially equal
---
I just don't give a shit about bloodhunt. I just started playing, so I have literally no teachables, but this shit is so repetative and I don't want to burnout this early, lol.
---
I would say Red - Green ranks your better not playing him, but Yellow and Brown you will destroy survivors
---
I didn't realize at the time that you actually announced the hotfix changes in advance. They seem very reasonable.
---
Amanda=upvote
---
True. Typically it's hard seeing anyone below Rank 10 not Run that Park
---
Framerate...
---
Do you have any info on when they might come out?
---
\*Happy oink\*
---
Maybe is a subliminar message lol
---
You may be right, we'll see how this change shakes out first.
---
Killers have a bright red light coming out of their face and soundtrack.
---
first the emblem pints for dull totems no that ? i really think they try to give survivors a reason to do something else than rushing gens.
---
But the ultimate goal is to get out, getting a pip in the process is nice yes but it's not the main point of playing survivor imo.
---
You'll get a black pip by escaping anyway so that's good enough.
---
If you want us to sabo just make it viable and not just a troll thnk that some dude will choose to do once evry 250 games.
---
People get salty about everything in this game.  I must admit I get salty too, but I saw that they fixed what pisses me off today. I hated seeing them swing and miss and somehow connect, but luckily the new animations will show it connect so I don’t have to die on the inside when billy poke me with a hammer from 5 feet away
---
i LOVE the jacket, nice job
---
Oh yeah, definitely a bug.
---
It's hard to tell with all other actions, but I have noticed for sure the first four I mentioned (repairing, healing, totems, chests). Your bar is yellow and you are quite noticeably faster.
---
You guys about to get sweaty
---
It's only in the killer shack 50% of the time.  Hardly the "usual" place for it.
---
Given that AFAIK the last statistics Behaviour shared showed killers averaging like 2.5 kills a match, I am not sure how that's called balance.
---
Ice pick, easy fix that fits the theme.
---
Maybe next week?
---
I don’t know who Jendenise is but I only posted because of what the main post says
---
This should really just be on the first page 24/7
---
Pretty good; all you need now is a fishing pole and a hook.
---
The thing is no one escapes death can be countered before it even happens. In most cases there's nothing a rank 11 can do to be a team of red ranks on comms. These guys were cocky and stupid and only managed to do two generators. Teabagging Myers isn't a good idea because that gives me plenty of time to stalk
---
Can I get it with shards?
---
Hes not as good as those 2, but hes strong and fun, and chases go on for the perfect amount of time so for me he earns pretty good bp
---
If you have them unlocked I use monitor and abuse, sloppy butcher, nurses calling or ruin and most importantly make your choice on my hag.  Combo make your choice with teleport range extension add ons and the hag really pops once you get some momentum going because you can punish the hell out the unhooker easily.
---
Give me gold
---
There's really no point to it. It's just a constant reminder that I'm playing a video game.
---
woah take it easy b4dg1rl xd
---
the last non hex name was in our SWF group
---
As all things should be called
---
Try restarting the game? If you're playing on console, sometimes quitting out or going to the dashboard doesn't actually quit the game, so you might have to manually quit it, or just restart the console to be safe.
---
This is what you get. It isn't a bonus. Nothing is added, nothing is extra. You get what you get for sucking or fucking around for to long. It's a mild punishment to not doing your job as a killer or doing it beyond the time the survivors completed their objective. 
---
Killer
---
Gate Open: Opening an exit gate (500).
---
Hatch Close: Close the hatch (250).
---
Late Hook: Hook a Survivor after the EGC has started (250).
---
Late Sacrifice: Sacrifice a Survivor once the EGC has started (500).
---
Time's Up: Entity sacrifices a Survivor after the EGC has expired (500).
---
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
You literally get less of every thing by half.
---
Normal hooks give 500 points then 1k for the full sacrifice.
---
The only time you get "extra" points is if you find and close the hatch AFTER the last survivor has already been hooked. You get 250 for closing the hatch. If you close it then hook them you get your points for the hook and kill literally cut in half.
---
Everything is less for the killer by half after EGC has started.
---
As a survivor you're rewarded more points for actions after the EGC has started. There's more risk so there's more reward for doing things after the EGC has started. 
---
Survivor
---
Late Heal: Heal another Survivor during EGC (750).
---
Late Rescue: rescue another Survivor during EGC (2000).
---
Pressure: Be the last Survivor alive and EGC starts (250).
---
Release: Open an exit gate after the EGC has started (1500).
---
Tenacious: Complete repairing a generator after the hatch has opened (500).
---
Read the patch notes. The bbq &amp; chilli thing is a visual bug, you still get the 4th token it just stays at 3. It’s like that for another perk also.
---
Thank goodness they reworked Mettle today
---
cmon my guy you could have left
---
So I was doing the recolours of all the new stuff while I waited for the games to load and realised the clipping right at the back is actually a florida man meme
---
Not ONLY the chase music is low now though. Menu music, terror radius music, injured music, fuck even just the ambient music the game normally has is now near mute.
---
Okay yeah. Music is basically non existant right now.
---
Oh that’s cool I didn’t realise I was just clarifying
---
I fixed it by going in the shop
---
Yeh I am having a couple of those games when you just feel crap and you can't really get going and I have that 1 game where everything comes off for me and I stalk super well and it's just a really good feeling
---
Jendenise is a toxic survivor main. Who got caught DCing so much to derank and bully baby killers that bhvr warned her. Many people took issue because she only got a warning because she is a fog whisper and basically got a pass. She technically should have been banned and stripped of Fog Whisper.
---
Them: "It's a nerf in some areas and a buff in others."
---
You: "No, it's a nerf — look at this one area."
---
Hold x and rotate with left stick
---
I mean...ive been taken out of my power.
---
He probably took it from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/brbygs/new_secret_diversion_buff/) but since so many are saying it's fake, he is probably making some "smoke bomb" to not answer.
---
This aged poorly.
---
It's a nerf. I really don't like stuns just canceling the power you spent time building. It was dumb on Plague and it's dumb now.
---
Yes I agree. But he is a fun killer. If I am having fun I don't care about a 4k
---
Had not realized my name had made the big time on the DBD reddit until someone told me they saw my name with two other hexes (my SWF group is all 4 in this pic) on reddit in before game chat. That was interesting. Ty again for letting the best hex live ;)
---
15% faster repair is going to be problematic.
---
So confused, wasn’t this the patch that was meant to implement SWF re-queue and the archives??
---
Long as i get my pip :))
---
Her spirit will haunt you forever
---
See. Thats where your wrong. It wasnt about 'how he did' it was the fact one, the revealing was a bit too hard to do, 2, the fact that stalking in a chase and having a near unlimted expose effect is NOT intended nor how he was meant to bep layed. 
---
Your overreacting, chill the hell out. This nerf wont even affect  him.
---
"flordia"
---
lol no i didn’t notice that detail from you standing behind a rock for a solid minute
---
Ghostface is supposed to be played as a stealth character, you shouldn't be able to follow a survivor in chase without being broken out without some serious skill.
---
Unless u have key
---
You might have, we play pretty much every day sometimes without our fourth, who is in fact pictured here with us. GG all around :)
---
Thank you! As long as he is not like Wraith or LeatherFace (Those two have a harder time gaining BP) I will be all set.
---
So he is strong and has a decent bloodpoints bank? Nice.
---
What is this red offering close to the key?
---
This has happened but with my PC. Haven’t had it for 3 weeks and got an update that I won’t have it till the weekend :(
---
So he has built-in Spirit Fury while his rage mode is on. Needs a small nerf TBH.
---
You suck. Also, I'm pretty sure 6 hours ago Ghostface wasn't released.
---
This is so sad. Entity, play the Curtain Call theme.
---
Reminds me of one time when two salty “you’re camping even though we keep instantly going for rescues” survivors invited me to a group chat, disregarded every point I made, and reported me after I announced that going out of their way to berate me for using insidious for its intended use will result in me reporting them both. It’s a viable report option as it’s in the list of legit report reasons.
---
The buff it deserves.
---
It's been taking me about 10 minutes per match. I assume they're testing matchmaking/dedicated servers, but I'm not sure about it
---
then if you like him for his character, why make this post in the first place? This perk is in a better place now. It rewards altruism which requires skill. Not getting hit 3 times then being like "lol no xdd" when get hit 4th time
---
the killer doesn‘t have to worry about anyone saving you anymore
---
When the store first came out, I kept wanting rotate characters on the main menu SO DAMN BAD. And now it's a REALITY!!
---
I do know you can't report players if you aren't part of the match. Almost no one will report for farming tho unless their extremely salty about farming
---
He can also 99% you like myers to insta down from time to time. No opportunity to look at him in that situation.
---
Should have been 3 Tapp's or Adam instead
---
I'm a Tapp main
---
And here I consider myself lucky if I find it on the third box and don't have to play the game 4 times to get it off
---
huh neat
---
Yep... Lobby after lobby... 3 player lobbies... Long waits...  
---
the best thing they could do is sell this f****** game to Disney.
---
From what I understood they need to see more than half of the character model.
---
Not in chests and only in bloodwebs generated during the event
---
"More Loops" thats the reason it should be nerfed. Some loops can waste way too much time without effort.
---
You should check out the PTB notes from a few weeks back. They math out why this change was made.
---
You can unlock him with auric cells
---
The music is way, way too quiet now. It's nearly non-existant. When I repair a gen and the killer is nearby the music is drowned by the sound of the repairing. If you are wounded the music is drowned by the moaning. 
---
You now have to entirely rely on the heartbeat as the music is far too quiet. And the ambient music is also non existant.
---
This guy just pointed out the biggest problem, and it’s that he hasn’t even been live for 24 hours and he’s already getting a nerf? That’s outright silly. The balancing that the developers do for this game is just completely ass backwards anyway. 
---
Every game I’ve ever played that had balance patches took the highest level play as priority, and balanced according to that. With this game, it’s the other way around. If a killer does well at low ranks, well damn, he must have a problem. Who the hell thinks that way? Lower ranks are where you’re gonna find people who hardly play, just started playing, or just aren’t good at the game. Chance are the killer will do good against those players, and it has no bearing on people who are actually good at the game.
---
lol what green styptic
---
It still has potential. I can meme, I can dream .
---
That’s a minor fucking color change you dunce, it’s not that serious. It’s to help to not make the dark cosmetics so powerful
---
The mid chapter is freddy and map reworks, they said this. As for the rifts/archives i think a lot of people are excited about getting morr lore and having more goals to work on in the game, and yeah the battlepass on the rift system is weird but the archives themselves will be available forever and give us more things to do in the game. Also Ghostface perks are relatively stong and fun to use just because you werent impressed by them doesnt make them bad perks.
---
You’d have thought lol. They’re rare af.
---
As was I since it seems to be a regular thing where everyone on this sub likes to start shit or have pointless arguments based on opinions and the differences between them. I'm not saying that you were. I'm just clearing everything up based on the patch notes and actual game play experience since 2.7 was released.
---
Time to go farm some points now. 😀 As for me, break time is over time to get back to work.
---
Omg lol this really is a very old bloodweb. What that is, was an offering to make the moonlight brighter or darker!!
---
The vaulting changes are terrible.  Why do they keep nerfing stuff no one has an issue with?
---
It's a New Moon Bouquet; it's a disabled item but it used to make the map very dark. That's what the post is about.
---
mask reminds me of  Payday2's Golden Grin Casino
---
Same thing with me. Also the whole Jigsaw stuff where it's complete luck wether you put off the reverse beartrap or not isn't making it any better.

---
About 6 hours... Any tips on countering?
---
Ye, before I could only use it with Billy; since he could actually get to another gen.
---
A direct hit with pebble should:
---
* Destroy hook
---
* Repair generator
---
* Heal teammate 
---
* Knock killer into dying state
---
Oh yeah no I get you I’ve been in arguments before but I was just given the insinuation by the mates that late sacrifice seemed like a good thing, thankyou for sending that though. And good luck farming! I’m level 43 Ghostface and loving it, especially with the 103% offering atm ☺️
---
Back when i cheated i got this error, same when fucking around the dev build. Its really easy to fix. Just go to properties in steam, one of the boxes in the top contains verify game cache, so it's really easy to fix. All u gotta do then is click it.
---
&gt;Maybe Jendenise should focus on not DCing constantly and being generally toxic. Because any opinion she has sounds stupid.
---
You clearly haven't watched her long enough, then. 
---
She purposely avoid strong (aka broken) structures on purpose because she knows they aren't fun. She purposely let killers kill her when the match was far too easy. She purposely avoid broken builds for as long as she can. She dies for her team more often than not. 
---
She can be many things but she definitely isn't "toxic'.
---
Yeah you're whining about swf... take the challenge homie
---
well they are 2 of the better perks in the game one being an exhaustion perk with no prerequisite and one letting you heal yourself with no item or teammate so not ok but probably both high tier
---
And here I thought I was just unlucky
---
I thought about buying the mask but then I realized it would make me more visible. Cosmetics are going to be tricky with him 🤔
---
it's more of a reward for helping other survivors, it isn't like "hey everyone sabo now!" but for those who do it to save others, they'll properly be rewarded, same goes for all the other survivor emblem changes.
---
You clearly dont.
---
Yep! Syringe was also purple way back when.
---
Then don’t tunnel
---
Kinda hard when you repair a generator inside a building, and the sound of the repairing is louder than the 'music'. The moaning is also louder. 
---
Seriously, you could just as well remove the music entirely right now. Give us an option to adjust it manually.
---
Now that I've got all the teachables (that I want) I plan to main tapp to P3.  His bloody cosmetics just look cool.
---
It’s been extended to Thursday
---
I haven't been able to get into one killer game. Insta lobbies as survivor though.
---
&gt;charge people for everything 
---
Perks are in the shrine and all non-licenced characters are free. 
---
Top. Kek.
---
Speaking of framerate, I thought I read somewhere that the most recent update was going to increase the framerate on borh consoles. I’m at work so I can’t check, but I wonder if that’s actually the case.
---
It is? I actually cannot hear it because the moaning of my character is louder than anything else.
---
ballon with a three on it
---
It's a balloon with "3" on it for the 3rd anniversary celebration.
---
You clearly watch her too much. I've seen enough of her gameplay and style of playing. She is most definitely toxic.
---
Can u buy it with shards?
---
You just can’t do it currently

It is there.
---
&gt; we're supposed to have the summer event very soon after this
---
Where did you get this info from? I can't see anything about it here, and didn't read in any discord
---
The amount of survivors that expect you to act like a dumb movie villain is fucking ridiculous.
---
&gt;She purposely let killers kill her when the match was far too easy.
---
Yea, this doesn't make her not toxic. It's a complete power play that basically tells the killer "You're so shitty at this game that you need me to stand still to get a kill. Get fucked loser". It's basically a sugar coated insult.
---
Trying to get a reaction out of you like any troll does and he’s failing horribly.
---
I got reported for stream sniping the other day. It was pretty hilarious and sad to witness.
---
Flair doesn’t check out
---
The devs have said they want to increase console framerate to 60 over a longer period of time, and so far it's gotten a lot better, but it's still not even close to 60
---
Just so you know, your opinions and speculations do not constitute facts.
---
You could just get chased. I went to Mori a guy who was BMing like that, not because I had a daily but just because I got one and hadn't ever seen one before. Guy DCs before it can finish and then goes "fuck your dailies" after the game.
---
I’ve literally stared at one and was close enough to poke him but it still wouldn’t reveal him
---
Removed stun reduction from everything = "Just a micro nerf to compensate for a huge pallet stun buff"
---
Buffed pallet stun time from 1.14 seconds to 1.00 seconds = "OMG! OMEGA BUFF! WHY DO YOU CRY KILLERS? THIS PERK IS SO BUFFED AND OP NOW"
---
Isnt that how it already worked?
---
Somebody just said they'd report a killer for tryharding (slugging and tunneling)
---
Personally at higher ranks I find it to be a buff. Now it stops instadowns, killer powers, and NoED which means it can't be countered in any way. And now pretty much all you have to do is get one on unhook and get hit within a mile of one of your friends because of the busted protection system
---
Interesting, thanks for pointing this out i'm gonna try it when i get home
---
Accurate
---
Wow, what a very convincing argument. I can’t imagine why no one wants to play against you in this game. /s
---
&gt;You clearly watch her too much. I've seen enough of her gameplay and style of playing. She is most definitely toxic.
---
Of course I watch her too much, other wise I would share the same wrong opnion you people have about her.
---
It'd be thematic if he was working at a cocktail bar.
---
Thanks. I've reinstalled the game already because my brain has ran out of RAM, as always.
---
I've played a game and yeah...but it might as well not be there. It's fo faint and quiet..why not remove it entirely at this point? Or give us an option to adjust it ourselves?

Reason number 253 why I turn my ps4 messages off. I keep friend requests on. You know someone is really salty when they send you a friend request with a rude message lol.

Lol this is funny. Dont want to play vs a billy and nurse, then dont ask for nerfs on other killers you idiot.
---
Did we get dedicated servers with the new update? Os is that further down the road?
---
Ah so it was the head. Ive been dodging every Claud in that skin because I thought it was just any piece of it lol. Thank god its fixed.
---
Decisive strike 3
---
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
---
lol hey guys look at this guy
---
do you still lose tokens when hitting other people?
---
I leave my tryhard perks on to farm too 
---
U just got butthurt by that one experience which is justified
---
Underrated comment
---
Yeah, it only exists to further just say to the player “hey...hey buddy. That hurt your killer. You should be mad.”
---
Why'd he drop and stomp the hatch instead of hooking then stomping the hatch?  :thinking:
---
The thing is I don't have the perks I use on anything ohter than Nea
---
Speaking as a software developer; no matter how outlandish a bug report seems, I can believe it. I've seen some really crazy stuff that doesn't seem like it could possibly be related to the bug and nobody believes me until I actually point it out in the code. We once had a bug that would only happen if the website was visited on first day of the month and it was also a Monday
---
Sigh.....im not gonna even entertain this...
---
I just when into custome Ghostface's loadout. and saw a black one on the floor and then realised haha.  
---
Some how I never noticed a single ballon on the main menu lol
---
After grinding a lot over the last few days, I thought I'd be burned out. I guess not.
---
*cracks knuckles*
---
Lets doooo thissss
---
Yeah the low heart beat on all. Killers is annoying
---
First at all, U don't have to be rude about it, we're discussing only, calm your tits.Second, It does a great difference, black is black, gray is gray.If he wanted a gray jacket, he would buy it gray.
---
&gt;Scream mask
---
what?
---
I just realised ye haha. I managed to not notice a single balloon for like 20mins of going through menus xD
---
Good idea. Right now I'm going on better level perks.. Still, I don't know if I want to max out everything because then I will be sad when I'll prestige.
---
Stonks
---
poor entity has cancer :(
---
yep same, feels like their is no sounds at all
---
not very often, maybe 3 or 4 times a year max
---
feels really really really bad. Nice touch with the slow mo
---
Judging by your points and what you used for perks and addons (lol), you played well
---
Hes my favorite killer and hes tons of fun, being able to dictate whenever you want if they're a 1 hit or 2 hit and the sneaking around is super fun, hes similar to the BP gain of huntress or trapper where it's not a crazy amount but its decent and you have fun earning it. Hope you enjoy him as much as I have dawg
---
What did it end up being?  Better or worse?  Not sure where to go to find those patch notes.
---
Thats *EXACTLY* what i was going for
---
Also theres no point saving puddings for double bp unless youre planning on farming
---
Cries in survivor
---
I have many other bloodwebs like this. This one is my favorite because it has at least 3 things that aren't possible to see in a normal bloodweb anymore. 
---
My other bloodwebs have only one or two event offerings/items. I have a couple bloodwebs with the brown (not gold) new year offering from Howling Grounds 2018.
---
Oh.... derp
---
You actually got me not gonna lie
---
I get why survivors would be upset, but if your team gets killed before gens are completed and the killer finds hatch first it should be incredibly difficult for you to get out in that situation. What is it everyone says about NOED? Why should you be rewarded for playing poorly?
---
lmao what is wrong with you, you answer me like I was attacking you Mr drama queen, anyways big waste of time or not, it does not make the game better, so again, I appreciate that devs do not waste time or resources doing that
---
You loop him like every other killer
---
You can save some points too if you target the cheaper items only just to get the levels to go by quicker
---
He was a survivor teammate in a game I had last night 10/10 guy knows his stuff and has ultimate trust in a team of people he's never met or communicated with.
---
Honestly I'm glad they fixed the hotboxes
---
Hey Peanits, Resilience is currently bugged right now and always activated. At first I thought gens were just faster because of the Year 3 anniversary thing, but then friends noted that they didn't notice a change or have any yellow progression bar.
---
Bloodweb for both Killer and Survivor. Because they are an event offering they will be more common than Bloody Party Streamers
---
10/10 great content!

---
Yep!
---
IT HAD TO BE DONE
---
He’s easier to play than nurse or billy. He’s basically Michael with unending tier 3, no terror radius bc sound is broken as usual, and no counter because looking at him works as often as yeeting yourself off of a hook
---
And when that one fails to fix the problem, they will just lie to the community again and say it was another "pass" at optimization like the december one.
---
She could've gotten wacked through the window there too lmao
---
git gud
---
Go get your fishing pole, obvious bait.
---
I don’t know what perks you have available but I would remove Plunderer’s and TINH
---
Lmao how very wrong I was. I’ve gone through 11 Bloodwebs and got 1, that’s it. Bit of a crappy event with no cosmetics and the BP bonus being so hard to get. Well at least the Bloodhunt has been extended.
---
I dont think i want to see that o.o id like to keep at least a tiny bit of my childish innocence
---
But it's super common on bloodwebs which bps is not
---
More than likely
---
good meme. very good job my friend. good!!
---
Its basically 3 months aways as well, cmon.
---
If you spin the Spirit fast enough, the skirt lifts up. Just saying.
---
Yep! btw has anyone figured out what the conditions on the ghost face adept achievement are? it just says i have to win with his 3 perks, not a merciless victory?
---
Don’t use plunders if you’re going to carry around a powerful item like a skeleton key. 
---
This is not happening is generally considered an awful perk. Dead hard is amazing. DS is decent but rank 3 will improve your survival chances a lot more.
---
Well guess your not gonna be playing for a long while cause it’s not op and I’m pretty sure they won’t nerf that part of him
---
No. I used PWYF a bit, and it definitely didn't work like that.
---
Wow that is beyond petty. It's been awhile since we actually had a scary killer and it's not insta down right away and simply looking at the dude stops the progress for instadown
---
I've never played Pig as a slugger. Going to have to try this approach!
---
Im getting one almost every bloodweb, sometimes even 2, without having any prestige.
---
I think they like money and I for one have spent over $200 on the game myself in just the store alone. If they want to keep the ones happy that continue to support the game then it absolutely is not a waste of time and resources because it is very simple to do and they could make a lot of money from the minimum resources. 
---
Do you not understand the art team does not work on bugs or anything aside from what they love to do, art.
---
Great stop releasing fucking busted shit BHVR
---
Kill all four on hook
---
I haven't had one in my blood web for 3 or so levels now
---
They seem super rare, hopefully they up the rate a lil bit. Kind of absurd to have an EVENT offering appear in the bloodweb so rarely.
---
I have it complete and that’s how I did it
---
He can 99% you, but if he stabs you without you being exposed the bar goes back down to zero for you it seems.
---
Consider yourself lucky
---
I've yet to die to a single Ghostface today. 
---
Obvious troll or just plain shitty survivor, can't decide which.
---
I'm not even bothering to play as Freddy again until the rework comes. He's just straight garbage and completely useless once the last generator is fixed.
---
Werid.
---
Using his 3 perks you need to double pip. It used to be "get a 4k" until they changed it.
---
Not sure
---
That wacky Florida Man, he’s always up to something
---
Sooo true
---
Damnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!
---
I don't know, I heard some people who have good pcs get 60+ fps
---
Why does it go together so well tho?
---
Survivor players are assholes and everything they do at high ranks is done to annoy the killer as much as possible
---
LMAO LOOK AT LITTLE MIDGET ASS ASH
---
Each of the paragraphs now have characters to round them out making mismatched chapters Leatherface and bill Ash and Ghostface so technically he is finishing a chapter
---
Just be sure to have Knockout.
---
Naw, it's great. I wanted it the moment I saw it a few weeks ago.
---
It's the player's fault for abusing a bad mechanic just as much as it is the bad mechanic for existing. This circle of you pretending to not get it is insulting.
---
Wasn't this like... A few weeks ago? Still cool I guess
---
You insta dc when seeing instant down killers? Well then go F\*\*\* yourself :)
---
Yeah I was just kidding around. If you are gonna prestige I'd recommend getting a build as good as you can, get to lvl 50, then wait until you have 1mil saved up, it will get you far next prestige. 
---
Build seems pretty good. Back when I wasn't using perks to joke around I did dead hard, urban evasion, hope or adrenaline, and self care.
---
But I wouldn't count out some other perks, it doesn't come in handy too often but Pebble (I think it's called distraction) can be pretty clutch.
---
As someone who exclusively plays killer, seems like the best counter is just getting better at breaking free from a Chase and staying (at least) in pairs.
---
He doesn't have any crazy high mobility moves to make up ground with. And having someone else with you to help keep a lookout for him, because his terror radius doesn't exist, keeps him from giving you a big ol spook while working a generator. 
---
Kinda like a "Don't let him let a finger on you to begin with" situation. But I've only got about 2 hours with him and also suck at the game. So my advice might just be shit lol
---
* Adjusted fast vault conditions: Players can no longer trigger fast vaults when beside windows or in contact with the wall.
---
* Mettle of Man: We have changed the condition for getting tokens. It is no longer for being hit by a Killer's basic attack. Instead earn tokens by taking "Protection Hits". It still requires 3 tokens to activate. Survivors will still need to be injured in order to trigger the Endurance effect and avoid being put into the dying state. This means that Mettle of Man will require more work from the Survivor to trigger Mettle of Man's Endurance status effect.
---
Oof. Y'all can't let survivors have anything, can you? Haha.
---
Who's going to use Mettle of Man after this? I feel dumb for having bought the DLC to get that perk now.
---
Indeed, detecting just does not seem to work verry wel.
---
Well, you dont buy the character for the perks. They'll "eventually" be in the shrine of secrets regardless. You buy them because you like the skin, so if you like the guy, go fucking get him.

---
They give him that story to fit with his power. OG Ghostface power would be something like Legion because all what he did in the movie is just run and stab people.
---
Wraith is actually fun to play, ghost face is pretty brain dead tbh
---
Why is it always the metal mask trappers....they always turn out to be either idiots or massive douchebags. Cursed mask.
---
Same on Ps4 probably lots of people playing ghostface and no survivors
---
I havent had any pop up in my bloodwebs yet on survivor nor killer. Just the party starters(for survivor), but ive only leveled up 2 or 3 times each character i tried them for.
---
This community overreacting to everything. Nothing new
---
The survivors were an swf btw
---
Reminds me of somebody who reported me for “wallhacking” when he was using Object of Obsession.  Rank 12 BTW.
---
Yeah the Meg perks are good to have. If you aren't too interested in cosmetics I recommend saving the shards and buy lvl 35 and especially 40 perks from the shop each week. saves you 5- 10 lvls of blood points each time you get one.
---
No event skins have even been confirmed this time around yet
---
Yeah it does sound pretty bad, but it makes sense given that they have the PTB literally days before the chapters actually come out. They should really do it like a week or more ahead of time so they can put in fixes like that when it launches.
---
Same shit was happening to me
---
Just watch out for your surroundings. Premonition destroys him and besides that just do as you would Myers
---
I really hate it. I hope they remove it.
---
Omg this just made me lol
---
Perfect. I've gotten reliable 4ks so far. Stalking is a bit tricky, because literally anyone around you can snap you out, but when you pull it off, it's glorious
---
I know I am doing myself a disservice but it's 5 bucks for a perk or two. That just seems wack to me.
---
haha i mean its whatever how you did it, but this clip wouldn't have been as devastating if it wasn't in slow mo lol
---
How are they going to save me if it's my 3rd hook?
---
Hag is for bad killers
---
Great, thanks for the reasoning on that.
---
I ask myself this question everytime I play killer.
---
oh wow they changed it so we don't need to double-pip?? didn't even notice! saves me from having to beg players pre-game to help me get the trophy like i had to do for plague (though i also did it for plague myself before they came out with the fix that makes the trophy possible at all, since, at the time, it was bugged)
---
jane for head on memeing
---
&gt;insulting
---
This proves it
---
Oh... Thank you anyway. Appreciate.
---
They didn't.
---
Kinda wish profile pictures showed up in DbD because then [my name would make sense.](https://steamcommunity.com/id/doesthislookliikethefaceofmercy/)
---
This is really fucking cool, and I don't even like Legion. I hope you win
---
"I think we have done a pretty good job so far"
---
I did. Fucking camper
---
It's always the opponent's fault when you lose, you did not know? /s (because people can't understand sarcasm)
---
Depriving myself of 2500 BP oh no
---
His robe is gonna be a meme itself. Look at those extensions hover there.
---
No, the archives at least aren’t coming until around the NEXT mid-chapter unless something changes, which is like 4 and a half months away. Not sure about SWF
---
The wiggle bar of a killer takes 2 seconds to go free. If you sucesfully hook a killer, you're immediately brought to rank 1 (without pips, depip impossible, rank reset does not affect you), you get all achievements unlocked, and all your characters are prestige 3 lvl 50 with unlimited perks tier 3 purple and unlimited items and add ons.
---
NOED?
---
NOw [I] Exit Door
---
Blasphemy and gg I have no clue about my steam profile anymore it’s been forever since I changed it
---
I think Spine Chill was always working wasn't it?
---
Awesome!!
---
No Mither
---
Once every few months. Probably 4 times a year
---
Or Whispers.
---
Maybe I should, if you're gonna beg go to the steam forums, atleast you'll fit in.
---
That's a problem with the pip system though, not pipping because you killed all the survivors in two minutes isn't a problem with "killing a bunch of potato survivors".
---
The killer's job is to create as many opportunities to catch and kill survivors as quickly as possible, as many as possible (the anti-camping clause), as often as possible, and sacrifice them to the Entity as soon as possible.
---
Not to let them live longer because the pipping system sucks.
---
Awwww, you too
---
Nice! Another unexpected thing I like about Ghostface is that I finally have a killer that I WANT to thicken the mist with! I've never understood why Killers get Offerings for thicker mist and survivors get thinner. As someone who's played a fair amount of hours as both killer/survivor that always felt reversed to me.
---
I’ve been accused of cheating by a killer bc I hid in lockers to avoid bbq lol. People just like to be mad
---
I love that link.
---
Previously you could (and I guess you still can atm) stalk and already marked Survivor to extend to duration of the mark.
---
Someone said the same to me cause I saw them in a locker with legions power
---
Thanks a bunch.
---
New to the game. What is tunneling?
---
To be fair, Danny Johnson/Jed Olsen/Ghostface did live in Florida as a news reporter, so it makes sense.
---
i dont have ghostface :/
---
more like when you take a hit with metal then dead hard then insta heal take another hit then adrenalin procs
---
He can only stalk from Night Shroud. It's been his thing since the PTB.
---
Awwww Really!  I was looking forward to something to get stuck into.  I'm really disappointed...  :(
---
What were the little dangly keyring things then?  
---
Been waiting for a grind, love the events 😢
---
The only proof that @GlenOck and I are friends.
---
Stop letting games enslave your time with farming.
---
Just ... play the game how you want to. Don't let games sucker you in with nonstop skinner boxes.
---
It’s coming with a map so I can guarantee it’s a full chapter :)
---
It does not seem that bad honestly
---
that's like saying "if i buy a dlc killer then they cannot rebalance them ever or else im being ripped off". like, no, you bought something with the knowledge that they may change it in the future
---
Mods please ban this man.
---
It's pretty nasty during Collapse since you have no terror radius. Just ran into it as survivor, got jumpscared by the sunuvabitch.
---
You have to achieve a merciless victory, which is double pip
---
I want this so bad.
---
EPIC
---
Hag is amazing.  And way more scary than most killers
---
Pretty sure he was just joking just saying
---
She requires 0 skill because all you have to do is put down your little hex thing and bam you win

Nope, like Ash, all of his outfits are Auric Cell exclusive

---
Doesn’t that mean the game is saving?
---
Going right after someone when they're injured after being unhooked
---
It’s not like Dwight or meg do either
---
Not in Dubai
---
Thing is, the game's pretty hard to enjoy once you get better and rank up - but lack perks.  
---
So when these events roll around it's the best chance to skip out on a lot of the grind. But unfortunately it's still a huge grind.
---
Questionmark
---
I mean he's not wrong about finding the hatch. All he needed was for the guy on hook to die, and then hatch would open for him since he's last one in the trial unless GF finds it and closes it before OP.
---
Sorry got triggered. Had a dlc giveaway while back and one dude kept on pming me begging for one.
---
Typical gameplay bugs that are to be expected after a new patch.
---
Not sure but I'm playing RN and it wont go away its been like 5 mins
---
My suggestion would be that altruistic actions (healing/unhooking someone else) also trigger trap timers
---
That makes me sad, but I can live with it
---
Like if anyone healed, or just if someone healed you?
---
Adam, deliverance and pebble are great
---
I don't I think he has some good potential
---
Unfortunately they aren't guaranteed. I just did a new bw at rank 50 on survivor and it only gave me a firecracker.
---
I got all 3 ranks of devour hope in a row. Yay a hex totem only useful against potatoes
---
Pig, Huntress, Tapp and this ugly Feng cosmetic when?
---
Probably just a glitch. I think it’s the icon that shows when you first starting the game and it says to not power off when you see it.
---
there's an additional effect you can add but it's r e a l y s l o w it doesn't really work for this video
---
Not sure but worth noting based on the banners it looks like they’re not all coming at once. One set of Tapp/Pig will be one week and then another set the next
---
There's not achivments for ghostface or ash
---
If you perform a healing action while you have a dormant trap on your head it starts the timer.
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
Got almost 200K Bloodpoints without BBQ
---
Typical team :D
---
honestly, people are grossly overreacting to these changes. By the looks of it in PTB it was nigh impossible to break his nightshroud mid-chase allowing him to basically play like a Myers ready to pop EW3 in every single chase.
---
This is a STEALTH power and is intended to be used in stealth, people were (and still are until the hotfix happens) capable of running out in the open with him and easily stalking 1 or 2 survivors before they revealed him. They already said everything about revealing him is still staying the same, center of screen, showing 20% of his body, 1.5 seconds, etc.
---
I also find it laughable that people are also upset that stunning him with a pallet breaks his stealth now too.
---
The wood throne
---
dwight? dunno.  meg?  she got a sick mom and college and life she turned around to return to :(
---
I could see that. It would force people with traps on their head to leave during EGC or risk their own death, unless they know their own box that is
---
I'm pretty sure that if i happened to be chasing her around the shack and she jumped through and i launged it would've hit .

What? Survivors and killers both get murky and clear reagents.
---
Yeah bloodlust lag is garbage on both consoles
---
someone steps in lots of hag traps i see

Like I said that was not my intention

Lol all over the next few weeks, two a week

yes
---
I dunno. Spooky Wraith is still fun to play.

Take only 1-2 match breaks from studying and be strict with yourself. Trust me you’ll regret it later if you don’t lol

---
I hope so.
---
It's nothing to the with the platform. 
---
Everyone wants to play the new killer hence the wait times
---
Do they for real?
---
Wazuuuuup
---
Survivors don't count their teammates hooks? What? I always do thos even as a solo just so I can take aggro if someone is about to die. The match gets significantly harder with only 3 people left, so why wouldn't you?
---
Anyone have trouble with sound on PC? Since the update I have no chasing music as a survivor
---
AFAIK it's any of the darker store-bought cosmetics, for example, Legion's Carjacket (iirc) mask is now a light blue-gray.
---
Touche
---
The only evidence that u/GlenOck and I are friends.
---
I want a LaChappa survivor
---
Ghostface has no trophy fyi
---
Not a Scream mask. Actually, the reason we didn't get Sydney with the Ghostface DLC is because they licensed the likeness of the mask from the guy who designed the mask. They didn't get a license from the Scream movie. #themoreyouknow
---
Then get downed and facecamped 🥵😫
---
I know people have been hating on some aspects of the game but I just got back into it and despite being out of the loop on certain metas, I’m having a blast playing again. I don’t quite care for the Plague...
---
1080 Auric Cells, buying 1100 costs 7.50 GBP.
---
The new killer perks are trash. This isn't the first time they've released a solo killer either. The cannibal was released alone, without a survivor. Get off it
---
Oooo thanks
---
Read the patch notes.......
---
Running OoO helps Spirit a lot, because you can quickly eliminate one player ;)
---
Can't stalk someone who's hiding in a locker
---
Should have expected this, honestly. OoO was his soft counter in the PTB. I suppose you could run Dying Light to make them pay for running it.
---
this is a bruh moment gamers
---
Theres an achievement for ash m8
---
i ended up getting a 3 piece but it was tough on that map
---
I don't know what your question was, but there are achievements for both...
---
On Haddonfield you can infitely loop a killer with BL and looping works better for your team then hiding.
---
That's not exclusive to Spirit. OoO helps every killer do that
---
True :D Agitation would be a must-have perk
---
Holy fuck
---
Dwight just kinda gets lost after being ditched by his coworkers other than that his backstory is just he is below average
---
I understand meg’s backstory may be tragic but it’s kinda basic honestly and it’s not even the fun kind of basic
---
Hide and seek mixed with tag.
---
The charms are rewards for the Archives coming in a few months
---
Why would people report for that in the first place?
---
Sorry I replied to the wrong comment. :D
---
ended up with a 3piece but it was pretty tough, probably would have lost without the steering add ons
---
Thanks!!!
---
P E C K
---
they need to nerf his tbag speed
---
Kate's soul haunting you after death
---
I main billy, and last time I was on strode I only won because I waited for a 3 gen. Easy game from there, always had someone hooked in between them all for easy patrolling.
---
He’s super OP. The reason you posted this was because he’s OP but you’re trying to justify using him and you want to feel good about yourself when you clap everyone with him
---
Maybe it’s pulling a larger range because a lot of killers queuing atm with the do event going on
---
Same I need that head piece now . Has anyone uploaded the banners yet ? Cause it’s usually in that order .
---
She's slow and you can negate her traps by crouching.  . . ?  You do know that right
---
thanks
---
i put 730k points into nea and got 3
---
Are there any other ways to slow a video down?
---
I just got his Adept today
---
Thanks, mate.  Probably healthier for the game that it's just good at one thing instead of a catch-all perk for every weapon survivors have.
---
Feng is still salty about Dwight leaving her to die the game beforehand
---
No, that's a store outfit. The exclusive items are the "Monochrome Maniac" (white/black cloak) and IIRC a Silver-Bladed knife (don't remember the name).
---
This is the best shit I've seen all day
---
All hail The Entity
---
True but i have already seen survivors on many streams already adapting to his power and how to reveal him so i think we should leave ghost face the way he is now for a couple of weeks and see the results and then determine if it's necessary to nerf him.
---
Because you don't want to take aggro and wanna play immersed? Like probably around 70% of player base.
---
He's very fun but in a very broken state once they fix him he'll probably be worse because as of now you can stalk in chases and they can't really do anything about it.i would recommend definitely but he is getting nerfed in a hotfix plus his ability is pretty damn buggy sometimes
---
Hold on you don’t have to double pip anymore for the Adepts? Getting a 4k will trigger it again, even if you only pip once.
---
I'm glad! Ghostface really does sound cool, so I might actually buy my first dlc since hag after payday lol.
---
Strode, Badham, Léry’s.
---
Here's what you run.
---
Knock Out, Deer Stalker, Hex: The Third Seal, and Hex: Haunted Grounds
---
Now use addons that give you an extra beartrap and one that reduces healing as long as they have a beartrap on.
---
Never pick anyone up, leave them on the ground with a trap on.  They cant see allies because The Third Seal.  Allies cant see them because of Knock Out.  You can see them because Deerstalker.  Proceed to slug everyone while they run around the map aimlessly looking for their downed friends.  Super fun since its effective enough, but you're still actively gimping yourself since it isnt very meta.
---
DISCLAIMER: SWF MAKES THIS USELESS BECAUSE SWFAGS USE VOICE CHAT TO BYPASS HALF OF YOUR PERKS.
---
I suggest running something else instead of self care since you're running bond/empathy. You can find team mates to heal you instead. Plus self care has been nerfed so it takes ages to heal up.
---
did you make sure your device is plugged in?
---
Yes, you need to wait. This Bug is really gamebreaking since it turns every killer into Myers basically.
---
That shit is very specific.
---
I have all survivors but ash and Jane p3 50. I had a million points saved, blew it all and bought 2 perks worth bp off the shrine. I got 2 Event party streamers. That’s so ridiculous, like others said. They are based around an event but no one is getting them hardly.
---
It feels like I always get it on the 3 or 4th one for some reason.
---
Not at all. Only chance of that is when we get dedicated servers (still waiting devs, still waiting)...
---
This has to be the dumbest thing I've ever read
---
And I... Am full health.
---
If more people talk about it they'll change it
---
I did it with my Jeff lol
---
Actually,  his stalk is broken. I had 3 different occasions where I'm 5 meters in front of him staring at him and night shroud wasnt broken. And No, he wasnt stalking me prior to that as I stared at him the entire time.
---
This is all speculation, but most certainly yes. The last time they did a free weekend, most old dlc prices dropped by 40%. But Ghostface won't drop, because its the newest ~~paragraph~~ chapter.
---
?
---
Same problem with me.
---
That's it. everyone you disagree with is salty and lives in a basement.    How convenient for
---
in my situation it was that they healed them so i couldn't interact with them and all of them did it so that the obsession got up, I went to hit them and they had MoM and got out (they were nearby an opened gate already). I went to hit the injured person trying to body block me and they also had MoM. Didn't get to kill anyone, and was pretty annoyed, but I was still impressed by their commitment and they were polite in postgame chat, so it didn't make me too angry.
---
It did make me run NOED during my next round. lol
---
What is this update? I got into a game where I couldn't wiggle when the killer picks me up, I couldn't hear the chase music, and I couldn't even escape! I went back to the killer so he can hook me for points but that is some bullshit.
---
I keep seeing people say it take time to charge, but every time I've been marked it's seemed nearly instant. I'll be looking around as I'm on a gen, not seeing anything, hear ghostface's stalking noise, see him somewhere I had just been looking and I'm immediately marked.
---
I hate both of those perks as survivor because both of them waste a lot of survivor's time
---
Good build, self care is great for healing yourself without relying on your teammates. Bond is amazing for finding other survivors and being more coordinated. Dead hard is fantastic for dodging killers hits and gaining distance and spine chill is good to know where the killer is coming from.
---
Iron will is a great Jake Park perk that makes you not emit grunts of pain while injured. I suggest it
---
Adrenaline is amazing for clutch plays at the end game
---
Decisive strike is a great perk for punishing tunneling
---
Borrowed time is awesome for dealing with camping
---
Awww. Baby needs to get the last word. How cute. :)
---
Has anyone else had this glitch(happened to me 4 matches) where you can only get 3 tokens on WGLF, I had 3 and would get another save, and yes it would give me the safe rescue points after like 15 seconds but I wouldn’t get my last token?
---
I definitely recommend it. He's in a good place, it feels like. Fun to mind game the survivors and a surprising amount of utility. Enjoy if you get him!
---
I don't play much killer, but I played Legion during the bloodhunt because it's the only killer that I have BBQ on. Also, I played killer because my rank is so low since I don't play the role. I figured it would help all of us farm. Literally, in the first game I hit one guy for the first time and they all DC. Then on my second game I hit the first guy and three DC'd. I was like.... nah going back to survivor lol.
---
Alpha
---
you don't
---
i mean, it's essentially the exact same thing, just a different method.
---
you’ve clearly not read any of the lore or you have failed to pay attention to any of it
---
[the devs confirmed it in a live stream (#47 and #55)](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/2402/every-lore-related-question-devs-answered-81-questions-and-some-answers-1) 
---
please stop replying to me with misinformation
---
I mean we got Ghostface (just a random guy with the mask not one from the movies) we have double bloodpoints and anniversary items also MoM(OP survivor perk) got nerfed and some perks got buffed so I'd say yes it's worth it.
---
I’ve done nothing but grind for clown this whole weekend. I was at 50 before the event started and I easily have done 25 webs since the event and **i can’t get a fucking ruin**
---
Broken.  I stood 3 meters to 5 meters away staring at him center of screen, night shroud didn't break. Happened to me in 6 matches so far testing it out. Maybe you need to be so cl8se, you can smell what he had for dinner?
---
It depends why you stopped playing in the first place.
---
This man has power's out of this world, he can.
---
That event was nice, but was too much to get the serums...
---
He literally missed a letter, the quality of r/murderedbywords is dropping faster than your iq
---
I had 3! First one was before they even fixed it for free, I was eventually refunded. Never bought another Xbox and eventually just went back to PC.
---
I have every possible perk on her i don't wanna know how much i spent on her.
---
Oh wow! I've always wanted one but they are soo expensive last time I looked. One day.
---
Dang, I was hoping the gave a few shards at least for cosmetics, but they only added a few bonus items?
---
Seems a bit underwhelming unless those cakes appear really often.

I agree that it's not all of my matches, but the fact remains that it is a good majority of them. You reach a point in this game where it's pretty much not fun at all unless you're playing swf because something in the game will always ruin the experience simply because most of the playerbase is terrible at the game.
---
I love Hag but I do admit I'm trap dependent. 
---
No traps?  No bueno.
---
I approve this message
---
Happens everytime there's a new chapter, itll fade in a couple days. Probably after Bloodhunt.
---
I used to always play with my friend and that never happened to his xbox
---
copyrighted people cant be bought with shards ash and ghostface aren’t original so they’ll need to be purchased with cells or money.
---
next chapter will be original so they can be bought with shards
---
No? You can but unlicensed killers and survivors with them, and cosmetics.
---
that made me rage and i wasnt even the killer
---
Its sad how Ruin is a must have on higher ranks. These potatoes on rank 14 are scared of the terror radius that's enough of Ruin lol
---
Any particular reason the gruesome gateau has an extra 3%?
---
Didn't happen when plague launched.but then again she isn't ghostface from SCREAM
---
Yes yes.  Everyone who finds your rush to label something OP is a basement dwelling salty baby.  You seem really well adjusted and accepting of differing opinions. I'm sure your a joy to be around
---
I wouldn't call a slightly bigger radius to detecting him a nerf, especially if ghost face is playing well and actually using the lean. Especially since he got the killer instinct buff too which means when you do reveal him, he knows exactly where you are too.
---
Ghost faces who actually play stealthily will literally be unaffected by these changes, this was solely for those who played him aggressively and stalked out in the open with little to no repercussions, he isn't Myers nor should be played like Myers.
---
Did they change anything with Myers?
---
It can't possibly be intentional, though. I can barely hear the chase music, if at all. What's the point in having it if you it's barely audible?
---
Nah I was trolling sorry for the confusion my guy
---
Amazing how differently experienced gamers see this game isn't it. Only a moron would balance a game around low ranks. But I guess what do we expect from devs who aren't even high rank players and who don't hire high rank testers. These are the same devs that say that the Plague is a top tier killer and probably freak out when going against her.
---
She's a 110 killer for starters, instantly putting her chase potential below Wraith without her power. 
---
This means she needs to use her power to end a chase early. OoO cannot track a phasing Spirit but it can reveal the husk, which makes it pretty obvious when she's phasing. And if someone is running OoO then they expect to be the center of attention. Giving them that advantage of phasing while they see you with OoO hurts you more than it helps you as Spirit
---
Big brain time.
---
Um...no hes not op? How is he op excalty?
---
I mean. That's a fair point. But I liked that as killer I had to search gens and plants instead of strictly my gens
---
Woah don’t roast him too hard you mad lad
---
Oh boi :/ I've never heard of it not working. Still no luck?
---
They put out a survey a few weeks ago and basically suggested that this was going to be a thing (if we'd like custom icons/perks).
---
he's not "really good" at high ranks though. He's pretty average.
---
Stopping a survivor from removing the mask can be considered gameplay sabotage and is bannable
---
Just to clear things up
---
Seems to be going well.
---
The goddurn college kids have been killin themselves all over our propurty
---
They did their objective, you failed to stop them. I don’t see anything toxic here.
---
Love Myers memes. First it was the "perfectly normal family dinner", now it's this high quality beauty.
---
If you have soul or you're not toxic, not really. You will become one of the things listed above.
---
Yep, so In EW2 your terror radius which would be 16, goes down to 8 because of monitor, then halves to 4 because of the rabbit. And it’s 0 on EW1
---
Man imagine getting shit on so hard you resort to calling the other team toxic on reddit
---
Hey me to
---
Here’s the thing. I get SFW is supposed to be an easy way to play with friends, but sometimes it just results in a killer get into a match and having no chance to even get one person on a hook. I’m a bad killer so interpret this how you want but since I’m still kinda new to the game it’s really hard for me to learn when I don’t even get a chance to do anything and it is already over. I just really wish there was some way for new players to learn better as killer.
---
Lol must be nice. I played 3 matches against him and everyone just went sweaty try hard mode. I just wanted to check him out,  and all that relates to him for me now is exposed. Not a fan so far, and sadly not a single one t bagged.
---
No matter what.  I want you to know.  I'm proud of you.  And just because everyone who you disagree with is a salty nerd basement dwelling baby doesn't mean your wrong. No.  Its everyone else whose wrong.  Stay golden ponyboy
---
Well at least it has to be a category of hit achieved now to get stacks for mettle. Before it was just getting hit three times by an M1 killer. Not a completely brainless perk anymore. Plus, you’ll be able to counter it by noticing when a survivor is obviously baiting hits for mettle stacks
---
Holy shit that's spooky as hell even in tier 2
---
Getting camped by a Huntress, praying to the entity for my 4%, jump off and into adrenaline, zooming past her out the basement. 
---
Nothing special, but I still can’t believe what I witnessed.
---
Some people are just trash. You'll find these kinds of people in any online game. Just move along, one day you'll be good enough to beat them.
---
I wish people on xbox used theirs
---
Not only the chase music but all music. The ambiance is basically non-existant, the music when wounded is just as faint etc.
---
My new to the game best friend was baby Jake, ran the killer for 5 gens and pallet stunned them in a panic at every pallet.
---
The game has to be balanced to be fun, otherwise no one wold play both sides. You cannot give one side a fucking Ferrari then the other side a Vespa and expect people to willingly use the Vespa that will almost always lose unless the guy in the Ferrari crashes it.
---
The changes seem fair enough to me, they don't sound too wild like previous killer nerfs and remember that the survivors recently got a very powerful perk trashed.
---
Yeah, you wont get a super OP killer, so what? It still be quite strong.
---
Absolutely! I'd say replace spine chill. It is a helpful perk but borrowed time is an absolute life saver and you'll see it in action. I can't really tell you what to update on your build since I don't know your playstyle. What do you prefer to play, do you hide and fix gens, or you prefer getting chased by the killer? Regardless of your playstyle, you always want to run an exhaustion perk(sprint burst, dead hard, lithe or balanced landing) since they give you much distance from the killer and save you from sticky situations.
---
This isn’t quite skill-based but I got extremely lucky. 
---
I was playing Survivor on Ormond against a Doc and we got through the gens really fast. He had NOED but we had cleansed all the totems. Phew. 
---
Then he downed and hooked me. My teammates all came and one saved me with Borrowed Time and I rushed toward the open gate. Doc followed me though, avoided everyone’s attempts to shield me, hit me activating BT, and continued to chase. Just as I got to the gate, he turned around to try to get the others. I would have had enough time to get out which might have been why he turned... but Blood Warden was active. I totally could have been downed and hooked again (which would have killed me) but Doc must have forgot he had BW active. I quickly hid, mended, and made it out as soon as BW ran out with the rest of the team. 
---
Let me tell you, my heart was pounding. :O
---
You cant tho cus he doesn have a fucking red stain and you just gotta guess.
---
I would take out spine chill and ad premonition or something like sprint burst or lithe
---
Um are you complaining about the wait time or the gameplay of ghostface?
---
Flordia
---
It makes no difference either way. You get the same amount of bonus PB no matter when you play the offering.
---
I mean... Faair, yah. Still man :P
---
It means you can't exploit and wait until you run into a wall to blink back 3 feet to get a fast vault.
---
Figured I'd throw this out there.
---
Surviviors should have a CHANCE at surviving. But nope,  every good perk we have gets nerfed to death.
---
47 only stated that he didn't do this stuff on himself. Entity could be a possibility for that. 
---
55 imply torture. Which is weird, because he killed many over the years in his facility, which is stated in his bio and he didn't had a problem there. But it was research for him. For the entity he wasnt allowed to do long research operations on victims. Because a match sometimes is not longer than 10 minutes. Which is why I think the entity didn't allow his research but want him to kill. So he received torture and had to obey to do things in the entity way. There was nothing stated about the inner struggles of Carter in his bio or moral dilemma. The developers would have mention that like wrath, nurse or legion. Who had moral dilemma or snapped of the mental pain. 
---
Also the lore never stated that Carter had to face discrimination based on his skincolour. Something like that would have been mention like those other cases

Then there's me that had to deal with all three of my teammates going down and not one gen done.
---
Two killers in a lobby. Double red ghostface. This picture is otherwordly.
---
People don't generally like self promotion here, especially as blatant as this, so this post may not do so well :/
---
Is it just me or did they say on the stream that there's going to be a HUGE event and a big surprise?
---
The only surprise to me is that it looks like we have no event at all...
---
This is suuuuuuper good. Love the crown, really good idea to incorporate so many sundry bits in there
---
So far 5 matches and I've been the only one offering it so far 😢
---
Scrappy Doo found dead in the streets of Miami
---
Claudette doesn’t teach self care at level 35 tho
---
Huntress is quite a bit better than Myers, Myers in the end is still an m1 killer and to get that instadown you have to waste quite a bit of time
---
I'm a proud PS4 level 22 prestige 1 dwight and I disconnected twice in history. I'm just doing my job
---
Same here. 
---
I really like the balloons and streamers. I just wish they had put black balloons on the hooks and white on the gens instead of both everywhere.
---
Can't you escape with the helmet now?
---
Same, i directly looked at his face and and i got exposed anyway, his power is kinda broken at the moment
---
Gameplay. I’m a new player to the game and me along with all of my teammates are getting shredded every game. Got any tips? It’s unbelievable how quickly he finds and kills everyone every single game
---
Doesn't sound like the killer you were playing mattered
---
This seems pretty fair and balanced, I like it! Finally something to put killers and survivors on an even playing field.
---
Everybody is saying his mid teir at best, so you have a case of the "git guds"
---
Can we get an F in the chat for Ashy Slashys last good perk being ruined
---
People that kill friendly survivors sickens me
---
"Easier to play" is a ridiculous reason to nerf any killer. Is he BETTER? That's the question. Is he a better killer than Nurse, Billy, or Spirit? Cause if no, he doesn't need fucking nerfs, he needs buffs to go to their level.
---
Trapper is easier to play than Nurse. Doesn't need muscle memory or anticipation and is just a basic m1 who can occasionally put down traps IF he finds them. Does that make him more viable than the Nurse? Hell fucking no. So his ease of play doesn't mean anything.
---
Ghostface has the easiest counter in the history of video games - just look at him, and you can do in several ways. You look at him during a chase, standing still, hooked, or downed. And it's not just the person he's chasing that can counter him, all survivors can counter him at all times. You can also bring in a perk that completely negates his power (Object of Obsession), and he can be looped, has shit perks, and his addons that already were the best are going to be worse.
---
But he's easier to play than Nurse, so that trumps viability. All that matters is how easy you are to play, not how effective you are at actually winning.
---
Its been a long running debate and Ive heard both sides of it. Resilience specificly states vaulting. Spine Chill apparently used to as well because it increased "all action speeds" which ive heard included vaulting as well as Dead Hard. But somewhere along the line it got changed - intentionally or not - and now no one seems to habe a definitive answer.
---
Also make sure he’s 20 percent visible also there is add ons that make his detection range smaller
---
He wasn’t friendly.
---
Thanks for the advice. I'll see how it does and if it goes bad, I'll know for next time. Really just trying to find the right content people of dbd would like to see. &lt;3
---
Seize mice Mothafucker!

You call me a drama queen lmao. You are the one clearly commenting with the sole intention of being argumentative. As it is stated in another comment the survey posted last basically said they were adding these things I ask for so you are wasting your energy.
---
Do you have anything else to do beside ride my post? Eat some airline nuts.
---
Escape is not an escape.
---
DS was the strongest perk in the game for two and half years. Killer perks get need just as often.
---
And I’ll throw this out there as my final point
---
Survivors, who play well, always have a chance at surviving. Four good survivors will always beat one good killer barring Nurse. 
---
If you think MoM didn’t need a nerf, you’re an idiot. You still have adrenaline. You still have DS. You still have Balanced Landing. You have Dead Hard. You have map offerings. You have complete map favor. 
---
Do I need to go on? Slow your horses. If you can’t play well enough to escape without MoM then you aren’t good at the game. Not the devs fault.
---
You're right. 
---
We don't have any good perks like Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Iron Will, Dark Sense, Aftercare, or Bond. These salty Killer mains and their demands for nerfs. /s
---
😳😳🤯🤯😅😅
---
If you cant get a hook, its not from swf. You just arent good
---
You don't need to take it off to leave, they made it so traps don't go off at the gate.
---
Add-ons and offerings don’t matter. You just need to use the 3 perks unique to that person and not a 4th.
---
go vegan clan
---
Play Billy and you don't have to worry about BL
---
Are servers exclusive? I play on Xbox, and I’m not sure if it’s crossplay. Because people seem sweaty on PC.
---
True. But if my last name was Campbell I'd do some serious Nancy drewing to find my relatives with A names. Also hilarious because Neve Campbell plays Sidney Prescott in the scream movies. Kinda feels trippy.
---
Of course I’m not good. I literally just explained that.
---
in Jamaica the hotel staff say not to leave the compound due to the high risk of mugging. can only imagine the chances of that go up with a confirmed $158m in the bank
---
He was released just today so nobody really knows a good method to counter him yet. I know you can look at him to end his power. Or run the minute you see him since his 1 hit downs have a timer.
---
Belle Delphine is her name I think
---
Hey thanks for going back and finding actual proof now that the mobile game is being made my the other company we are more likely to get a stranger things chapter
---
It just bugged me how fast the gens got done.
---
That makes sense, and of course your intentions are good!
---
Shredding everyone in 2 min but youre playing with the same people. Maybe its you guys that aren't good.
---
Makes more sense for a journalist anyway.
---
Except he is at the same level as billy and spirit as is. And nurse is on Freddy’s level if you can’t use her ability properly. So yeah skill should play a factor. Ghostface is a brain dead upgraded Michael who requires no skill and is in his current state a top tier killer. His counter (looking at him) works a solid 4% of the time and he has add one that reduce the range of that, meanwhile he can instantly re expose you during a chase and keep you at 1 hit status 3-4 minutes at a time even if he’s too dumb to properly chase
---
Getting hooks is a part of the game too. It's the sole goal of the killer.
---
[I bet you would.](https://youtu.be/Qi6tshsXVUk)
---
No
---
I'm on ps4, and it was just massive amounts of people being hooked. I was the only one that even managed to pop a gen, then died on my first hook after saving the team mates lol. Just not at all fun.
---
remember to not mori the last survivor, you also need to farm the game somewhat
---
Oh right
---
Pretty sure the detection is bugged. Had a game where I could detect him really easy and one where it was almost impossible
---
I'm hardly killing anyone, as him. I am awful.
---
Lol Myers do that too but he don't need to be nerfed, why ghostface has?
---
Not the same people.  I just need help to counter him
---
Jeff for Aftercare/Distortion. Jeff’s also got great cosmetics if that’s your jam, so I’d go for him. 
---
Adam is a good choice too for Deliverance. If you’re an achievement hunter, Deliverance will help you get the trophy to unhook yourself a number of times.
---
No problem I genuinely did read that it was a mobile game so sorry for spreading misinformation glad I could clear it up though
---
Thank you i got my achi now :)
---
Thank god, I felt weird because i've played alot of fps games ( 7000 - 8000 hours). So im sure i know where the middle of the screen is, so i was like "There is no way im missing him this much".
---
What's the longest you've waited?
---
You answered your own complaint in saying it. My group and I run 4v1 in private often, with the killer out of the chat. Usually only 1/2 people escape, if anyone. Likewise, when we go online it's the same
---
You know what other perk saves you from being tunneled and saves you in a bind?
---
^Decisive ^Strike
---
P3 Claudettes, Bald Dwights, 50% of megs.
---
As for Killers...all of them. Every single one.
---
Yeah, I've finished up stalking like right out in the open with someone looking right at me. I didn't fill the whole meter that way, but I still got the last bit done after I was forced to move out into the open by someone else behind me. I put the tree between them and myself, revealing uh, myself to the guy I was stalking, who stopped what he was doing, looked right at me, and then started running when he realized it didn't quite work out for him. In all, I think Ghost Face is fun as shit, to be honest. He's the first new killer that I really think brings something new to the game. He kind of reminds me of an ambush/camping killer (not camping hooks mind you, but if you set up at places you think might get a little busy, it's sort of fun to jump out and one hit some people when they stop by.) and I find myself playing him much differently than anyone else.
---
Yet his offering gives 103% BPs to all players
---
DBD doesn't even use any fancy hair simulation; it's just cloth physics applied to hair ;~;
---
they made entirely new rigs for everything when they could've just left all the values the same but updated the model this is the worst :&lt;
---
I agree that killers should have stronger perks than survivors. But i don t see why implementing this wil make killing any harder for the killer. The only difference is that dark sense will reward the survivor with bloodpoints.
---
I’ve just been going for the double pip.
---
And no, I wasn't lagging.The people spectating saw it too
---
Just started getting into her and she really is fun. Don’t know why my 2 favorite characters involve bear traps...
---
In regards to the change of vfx I have full faith in the devs that it will be removed. However, I might be [singing a different tune](https://youtu.be/mCjBspxuUmU) if it's not removed post haste.
---
Haven't played Myers, but ghostface is actually really good
---
With the amount of killers that I come across that have tiny terror radius, it’d be better if to use your pebble, it’d be on a lengthy cooldown
---
Personally my ultimate goal is to have fun games. Sometimes I enjoy playing around with sabotaging. I'm glad to see that I'll be better rewarded when I successfully pull it off. 
---
Not every change and adjustment needs to be entirely focused exclusively on escaping imo
---
First, if you’re a high rank survivor playing with low rank survivors (because of the reset) that’s probably your first issue there. It’s probably way less you than it is them for sure. My first game as him I had someone dc when I one shot them (I am also a rank 1 survivor/killer. Currently sitting at 12ish I think for the same reason as you). He is VERY strong I agree, but that doesn’t have to be synonymous with OP. At his core, he has no heartbeat and can one shot, but with no mobility effects he won’t touch billy or nurses throne. His addons may need to be tweaked, but again give him at LEAST a week before we start calling for nerds. I totally get your sentiment, but asking for nerfs like this is exactly why we ended up with Freddy in the shit position he’s in now (and has been for almost 2 years). 
---
PS: Thanks for the friendly discussion on this. I wasn’t trying to come off as rude, I just don’t want people overreacting and we get another Freddy.
---
Including himself.
---
&gt; The game has to be balanced to be fun, otherwise no one wold play both sides
---
Balance is about ensuring that one side isn't too over powered, not about fun. If something isn't too powerful then it doesn't need to be touched. You nerf something when it's too powerful not when it's too unfun.
---
And please don't act like they did this so that more people would play both sides. That's about as ridiculous as them saying Plague is a top tier killer. The amount of people that play both sides is a minority fraction. Most survivor mains couldn't handle one week as killer.
---
&gt; The changes seem fair enough to me, they don't sound too wild like previous killer nerfs and remember that the survivors recently got a very powerful perk trashed.
---
Who gives a crap about one ridiculous survivor perk, I'm talking about an entire killer's viability and the mindset of these devs. Survivors still have plenty of crutch perks, second chance perks, hook immunity perks at their disposal.
---
But there doesn't seem to be too many "hey we need more viable killers" people over at BhVR. Maybe a few are but their ideas keep getting shouted down by rank 13 survivor main developers who think a killer need a bunch of counters and perks that work against him or else he's the next Nurse. 
---
And again, you preach balance but you are quiet about hooked and downed survivors taking away a killer's power. Are you ok with the most ridiculous counter in this game's history? Cause I don't see any survivor mains saying that it should be removed. And if that's not removed, then these other nerfs shouldn't be implemented.
---
lol, this is fucking great. You seem like the kind of guy who be like, "Frank? Fuck Frank. I'd kick the shit out of him."
---
Frank taps you on the shoulder. 
---
"No, I don't have a problem with you. Someone spreading lies."
---
Nah I get broken out of my stealth pretty easily
---
Very

He could have used a mori or a survivor pudding

Bro dont quote me and ignore the quotations I put. I know we got some fucked up exceptions.

In reality though if ALL of Ashleys perks are actually garbage, we'll start seeing them as much as Enduring or whatever awful perks shows up every other week soon enough.
---
It’s so dumb that you can’t open hatch while on the floor
---
RIP my boy Freddy
---
Because BBQ doesn’t actually do anything. Most people, good killers and bad, run it for bloodpoints. 
---
If the killer isn’t Billy or Nurse, the aura reading is almost completely negated against a good survivor in 90% of situations thus making the second part of BBQ useless.
---
Edit: Also not saying that implementing this makes killing harder. Just stating.
---
I think I have the same problem it’s been every game and not all killers are running stuff for blindness
---
I love your art style. And this design is a whole new killer in itself. Nice!
---
Yes, but also no.
---
With the buff making it (seemingly, from my experience) like you not only have to look at him but also face him to at least some degree, he's much harder to pop out of Shroud.
---
He's kinda the same as Myers really, feast or famine. Either you'll get no stalk for 70% of the game and get looped to high heaven, or you'll roll over people.
---
If only the cosmetics came out today :(
---
Some of the people that play this game are genuinely fascinating. I've never seen this type of shit in other type of games, not to this degree. I've never seen anyone in a First Person Shooter say "Why did you shoot me in the head? I stood still to signal that I was chillin".
---
Yes you can. It takes all of like 5 minutes to get a game.
---
Lmao why
---
That’s because killers get way more bloodpoints, there is a lot of camping and tunneling happening which makes the game frustrating, and a new killer came out. I personally sit through the 20 minute wait time because of how unenjoyable survivor is as a solo player
---
If I'm going by your name, I think I played with you against a ghostface at one point. He beat us fair and square, he's not op.
---
I hope you meant Enduring and not Unrelenting lol
---
No. A different myers.
---
I guess it could work but they would effectively just become another killer that gets off 1 hit and then becomes a basic m1 killer for the rest of the chase. Probably just get looped into oblivion but maybe there could be another part to the power implamented to stop this? Idk.
---
Amazing haha. Killer deserved that for being cocky and not hooking you.
---
Im pretty sure double rp extended for 2 more days so shhhhhh
---
I just am not good with him at all. And hate going against him.

THOSE PIG ART LOOK SO GODDAMN GOOD!!! TAKE MY MONEY BHVR!!!!!!!!!!

Wish it was 5 minutes, more like 10+
---
Ok, I only started playing because it was a plus game last year. Probably never would have even heard of DBD otherwise, but I'm very glad it was and I did.
---
Dont you know, survivors want the killer to stand in the corner the whole game and not do anything.
---
It's cheaper than a pudding, does more than a streamer, and appears in literally every bloodweb,  
---
its better
---
It’s just shame that when ever killers come out I can’t play the game.
---
Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.
---
What about Star Wars?

I checked it out and your right it is better. Only tips I'd add is that you got too much stuff on the screen that isn't the game, you have a panda, a myers, the huge ass plug of your name( which if they are watching the video they probably already know what the shits called), recent sub, recent dono, discord,webcam. Thats a lot of stuff on screen. And this last part is subjective some people like it some don't. But the meme sound effects and zoom and added on screen subtitles just feels like what most the other creators do. Other than that good content hope if grows 👍
---
he's a myers thats smaller and harder to spot, with a much faster charge to get exposed on people and wonky af mechanics on knocking him out of stealth.
---
Thought that was glitch even so everyone is gonna be running ebonys and console bois haven't gone against him till today so imma just chill in the basement and get points like that
---
Yeah I’m still experiencing quite a bit of unfair feeling hits.
---
Any kind of communication between survivors would just make that power completely useless.
---
1 million and got 1
---
I said don't. Not that you cant(implying if you want a character, its because of them, not to "stay meta" in DBD lmao).
---
Either way, look at this big spender over here, has some actual auric cells, careful with those things man. Ill just be over here with the other 90% of the community that just waits for the shrine, or buys a survivor because theyre sick or thikk.
---
You‘ll get a sound notification if you’re in the process of detecting him
---
One shudders to imagine what dreams of jump scares could sustain such paranoia!
---
I don't think you are being rude,  I don't even care to be downvoted. It's my opinion as of right now, I just feel like he's going to need adjusted. Tbh.
---
Why does it hate you?
---
That’s the saltiest disclaimer I’ve ever read.
---
Yeah thats what I was thinking. Maybe like a speed burst when in werewolf form?
---
Its interesting, but like u/SlimerCream said, a SWF would destroy it. Plus I feel like it wouldn't be that powerful, even with a free hit on ambush
---
I don't think it did but now you are making me doubt myself
---
He got it on Fred
---
[Roadmap](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D77W0S2WsAEkudU.jpg:large)
---
But hoffman and tapp in the same room? I DISAGREE SIRRRRR
---
Indeed here we go again.
---
A) try facing him, even if you're behind cover, make sure that your body is facing him at least to some extent in a 180 degree angle.
---
B) It needs to be center of your screen, you can't just have him off to the side anymore.
---
C) because this game's code is spaghetti, it seems as though if you're TOO close you can't START revealing him, however if you're running at him while already starting the reveal it'll still work.
---
D) there's a buffer, so the time to reveal is more like 1.75, and remember, your reveal progress resets the moment the noise stops, his expose progress doesn't.
---
E) Quit your god damned whining, every killers OP when released to the masses that don't know how to play him against him, also, there's a hotfix coming to widen the detection area a bit more, so maybe that'll fix your issue.
---
Oh I guess that's not good haha people don't like freddy
---
Is this a shitpost? If so it is absolutely amazing
---
I mean the transformation would have to take some time so it wouldn’t be like a instant ambush. I’m not sure what they could do about communication. Maybe put them in the chat too? Before hand lol
---
Thanks! Super appreciate the feedback! I got that video from a stream I did, I already was trying to switch off of uploading from that and trying to upload gameplay that hasn't been seen before. Thanks for the info. :)
---
AND I CANT PLAY IM SO SAD
---
How about
---
"I don't down someone"  
---
"They're about 15 ranks above me"  
---
"SWF as well"
---
Still it's incredibly hard to break him out of it because it's so damn buggy and I know that it takes 2 seconds but I've stalked people for like 5 while they were looking at me and they still got exposed but he did just release and not alot of people have learned to deal with him.
---
Most of my games have been legion today not GF 😓
---
No. He's comparable if not better than Myers. He's better at hiding and his stalk never runs out.
---
Good for you. Doesnt change the slightly comment.
---
Everyone is playing killer right now.
---
Usually if you're really high rank (18+), games can take a while to find too.
---
Otherwise lobby could be bugged
---
Yeah, it's all jokes
---
Too bad his name is on the giant cheque there :/
---
It's glitched. It still gives 4 stacks it just says 3 I'm pretty sure.
---
It says that the ip address can not be found. Did the address change?
---
Oh, me too. Especially as Killer w/ Ruin and the totem spawns......well, in the place no one ever looks.
---
It's wreck city when that happens!
---
Who seriously complains about survivors completing their only objective?
---
It's a glitch
---
Make absolute sense. Sorry for the useless post here
---
 Nice blue snowball
---
“Known issues:
---
The Barbecue &amp; Chili and Remember Me perks visually only stack up to 3 tokens.”
---
Visually. It still gives the 4 it just doesnt tell you.
---
This summer.
---
Who seriously complains about tunneling killers completing their only objective
---
You think? Why so?
---
It's new for the anniversary event
---
Honestly my second match since GF launch. I expected GF 9/10 games. When I saw jump scare Myers, I laughed... and joined his crew of memes. 
---
They keep lookin, but by then, it’s to late.
---
this just happened to me and some friends  
---
Unfortunatly the killer decided that they didnt want to farm points and instead get the trivial amout from an actual game -\_-
---
I mean I'm playing ghostface offering it up every game and it seems almost every game I get is a 4 stack and gens get done in 5 mins...I dont want to stop putting up the offering but man without ruin the game is so fucking quick
---
Claud, Meg, David.
---
Bubba and Legion, from experience.
---
Let's just hope they add back the floppiness of it all - if all hair is like Jeff's then problem solved
---
It's always orange vest Dwights for me.
---
"Later" - Spy - TF2
---
I’m really disappointed that there’s no cosmetics or extra objective to do
---
it must have been changed from the PTB. I'll fix that tomorrow, because my internet broke and I can't download the patch today
---
Very rarely to be honest...make the best of it when ya can
---
Can’t even call it a event
---
 I’ve definitely never heard that music in any other dead by daylight compilations before....
---
you are the type of survivor main that made freddy be nerfed
---
My favorite Michael myers meme and probably my favorite DBD meme too.
---
Yh.. wtf?
---
Nothing. Really changed tbh we got ash who had a meta perk but it got nerfed and we got ghost face who looks like a fun and effective killer
---
I have only seen one so far in 1000000 bloodpoints
---
You can't say that a key is as strong as a mori.....
---
fuck the second category. 9 fucking hooks, you have to let them come rescue, and even then they dont sometimes. Also the medals need to be moved around. The discrepancy between the first and second is HUGE
---
And BHVR *really* needs to own up to this and fix it.  Because with the coin-flip randomization method, any add-on that adds an extra Jigsaw box to the map **helps** the survivors.  
---
Additionally, no player above rank 10 regularly misses skillchecks.  So the add-ons that increase skillcheck trigger odds just give high-skill survivors more chances to get a great skillcheck.
---
So any add-on that increases skillcheck odds or adds Jigsaw boxes *hurts* The Pig instead of helping.  [Of the 20 add-ons she has](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Amanda_Young#Add-ons_for_Jigsaw.27s_Baptism), 4 of them actively aid survivors.  That's 1/5 of her addons.  [Jigsaw's Annotated Plan](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Jigsaw's_Annotated_Plan), a *rare* add-on, is the worst of these, having **two downsides and no upside**.  
---
^^BHVR ^^fix ^^your ^^game.
---
I haven't noticed a difference for killers, but I just played a single round as Ghost Face. For survivors though the music is nearly completely gone. Even the ambiance of the maps, which completely kills the atmosphere of the game by the way. 
---
It also makes it a lot harder to determine how far away the killer is as the 'Search'-music is drowned by the sound of repairing a generator even moaning/breathing when wounded.
---
He just sounds like a ass honestly lol
---
&gt; Just ... play the game how you want to. 
---
I want to play with certain Tier3 perks, but it won't fucking let me unlock them. Here, take slippery meat and monstrous shrine instead.
---
You have to put him near the middle of your screen and keep it there for, I believe, 1.5s
---
Lmaoooo that’s so pathetic
---
Not good examples. I agree the Pig traps nerf was unneeded but the thought process was sensible, the collapse had just been released and the devs were afraid Endgame Piggy would be too strong. Definitely a bad nerf tho. Remember Me was nerfed for the collapse too. NOED being a hex was a quality of life change, not a nerf. Legion’s addons were actively toxic to the game and needed to be removed.
---
The second one is true ghost face
---
I'm sure all the survivors in here cares about the killer's fun
---
You have to center your screen, so ghostface's face is right in the middle, you can hear an audio cue if you are doing it right.
---
Hey, there’s no need to use that word as an insult. I get that it’s an internet thing but seriously look at who it hurts before you use it.
---
I've been having decent games with him. I guess I'm just getting lucky. Survivors haven't really been countering me with perks
---
yummy yummy
---
I see more killers DC because they get looped than survivors that DC because they for killed
---
Uno Reverse!
---
It's not buggy, It's just new and you know know how to play it yet. do you just expect to be perfect at it all instantly?
---
You have bond so you should probably change self care to something like adrenaline or mettle of man
---
That clown one got me, insta upvote
---
I do think Spine Chill is a top tier perk as a solo survivor. In SWF, SC is not that useful because you can use coms, but solo it is a crazy good perk. I've seen people rate it as C tier [S - F], and thought that was absurd. SC is my highest impact perk, it's what got me my rank 5 after only 2 months of playing this game fresh
---
anyone have the HQ artwork for this?
---
You could not activate MoM more than once.
---
Oh, I did? Where?
---
I would have been fine with it if the offerings showed up more frequently. But they pretty much show up at the same rate streamers do, so they're useless.
---
I don't being alone against a killer now is almost impossible he closes hatch and just goes to patrol the doors and you don't have the time to escape no matter what you do.
---
Same logic. You can claim it's their only objective but if they have to be a shithead about it then :/
---
PC
---
In game
---
Sprint burst activated twice
---
Get off of hook and run
---
Sprint burst should activate and then go on cool down.
---
I got off of hook and sprint burst activated. Then, 2 seconds after it activated, it activated again.
---
You should be able to throw the pebble in any direction while running/walking. That's the buff it needs.

He was hired to torture people and break them down psychologically i feel no sympathy for him
---
I usually get a proc when I’m in night shroud and it’s an easy second hit Bc no tr or red stain
---
Might be me youre talking about since I made a post about it. I was not expecting people to believe me but i knew thats what it was after it happened multiple times lol.
---
HMM, I think to balance it, you receive a 1% speed penalty to repairing gens. I think that's fair.
---
Actually had this happen against me when I was pig checked profile and now one was swf
---
Yeah it hit 1 day once the eveng came up so
---
I've only seen 2 content creators find this bug, both times it's been on the same map. I haven't seen anybody talk about this so far.
---
As a piggy main myself i can safely say you made a good decision leatherface main
---
It should be able to collide with lockers/gens/vaults to make it actually believable.
---
It will be useful for killers, especially GhostFace, if he sees someone starting to look back he can just pop back behind cover
---
This. We need more final girls! Imo this was a big missed opportunity, its not like there are much good franchises left for licensed content..
---
I don't ever remember the game described it as 'as fast as possible', but alright.
---
DS was a perk that rewarded survivors for losing and it got nerfed....
---
Wow the new audio is awful. Can they stop fucking with basic fundamental stuff every god damn patch? They make stupid unnecessary changes that in turn break other things causing further grief. I can defend this shit anymore. Hey lets nerf cosmetics people paid for while were at it. I just cant.

Isn't she the only final girl to survive 4 full movies?

*Are you fucking kidding me?* This stupid meme yet again? What is it with all these poorly memeified reply attempts at jokes? Are you posting these comments simply for karma?
---
I swear, sometimes it seems like people are trying to squeeze the karma from the balls of life. Those great round creators of all that lives; the fatherly mounds of existence. But that is abuse. The spheres of humanity should not be subjected to these horrors.
---
Like the song of the Sirens, the sweetest sound known to man, tempts the weak and fragile to its source; then, as the tentacles of Medusa grip your heart, the quest for internet points pulls you into a hole that you cannot escape until your dying breath releases you from the chains of life. The greatest sin of man, temptation, is fulfilled, only to open the box of Pandora, releasing the endless horrors of an infinite temptation that can never be satisfied. The call of the Sirens continues, despite its source being unreachable anymore. Life is wasted in the futile attempt to reach the unknown God that holds satisfaction; the journey itself becomes the source of grief and misery.
---
If you had the slightest of respect for life, you would quit your attempts to dig for karma like you're an owner of a diamond mining company in the forgotten, dreary depths of Africa. As the power of the sun --- a harbinger of life and death --- drains the workers of the strength within their weary bones, your comment burns through the depths of our souls and tacks on a hopelessness that is irreparable.
---
The power of the word can push a man into bliss or into despair. To hold that power is to hold a shining light into the very soul of a man. To behold this power is to comprehend that man is fragile. To see the use of a comment to hunt for karma, like a hunter trails after his prey, his very life-force, is to see the degradation of mankind.
---
To this end, you leave me no choice but to deprive you of your life-force, not for the benefit of myself, but for the benefit of yourself. Thusly, you may learn to appreciate the power of the word, and to use it wisely. Use it to benefit mankind, not to bring it down.

Yeah it is VERY irritating to say the least.
---
I believe you
---
This how they should have treated it in the first place, I am fine with them nerfing EGC for Pig if they would buff her pre-EGC kit like addons and other stuff.
---
I don't know what this is but i like it.
---
“We have a big surprise for this event.” Bhvr we already know what disappointment is like
---
How do you rotate your character?
---
That sux
---
I’ve spent 600,000 BP and see 3 so far LOL what a joke
---
Not just that, also menu music vb is nearly mute.
---
She forgot to play by the rules...also toxic pig=no real pig therefore I can upvote.
---
Where's the source for this? I've been putting off getting a texture pack just in case.
---
Kate and leatherface
---
Let people play whichever killer they want.
---
I literally get one every time I level up, are you p3? And are you on pc?
---
Level 36, and I've found at least 7. Xbox One.
---
Usable but not obtainable most likely
---
For PlayStation you just put your cursor over your character, hold x, then move your analogue stick left or right (same as in the store).
---
Wow, going to far here buddy.
---
I will try that if it lets me on lol. Thank you for helping me ^_^
---
for me hag is after billy.
---
That sucks. Mine is fine.
---
Just get up and then get down with the sickness
---
Also so he won't get robbed by stangers recognize him from that being him on TV...
---
The WiFi is shit on switch. Terrible speeds, and it loses connection when it's more than 1 room away from the wifi
---
As in, Saw style? Because I got a few trap at my garage.
---
Those things are useless anyway
---
Wraith?
---
I genuinely had no idea an "event" was on. I played some dbd went away to have dinner. Came back and there were balloons. A new type of bps. Not an event at all. 
---
I love the three monthly content drops etc. But I still feel dbd is missing a trick with their events or "seasons" more could be done for sure. Say what you will about fortnite. But epic are nailing it.
---
Let the pig see which box has the key for the survivors
---
People can play what they want. Fuck off with your whining.
---
Hahah, I see what you did there.
---
Hey bubbas nice! He's just a little bit stupid is all
---
This is how it's meant to work, yes, but unfortunately, [statistical analysis has shown otherwise.](https://nm.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/anq365/pig_rbt_stats_part_2/)  According to these numbers, the game internally "flips a coin" to determine the outcome of a Jigsaw box search, with 50/50 odds.  
---
The mechanic is not implemented correctly and needs fixed.
---
After just two games I really like him and wouldn't mind them fixing the spotting. Incan tell it's unfair when they are looking straight at me and I'm just running torwards em like FUCK YOUR EYE BALLS. I love him and hope they keep him where he is after the hotfix.
---
I think I’ve found 2-3 on every bloodweb I’ve done today
---
Nah. The hype of today is new content. Not stale stuff you can go against any old day.  Sorry, not sorry.
---
Lotta Wraiths in my experience face camp the most
---
Pizza man dwight?
---
Mikey gets the exposed status effect on his weapon, ghost face makes the survivor exposed so multi stalking wouldn't be too fun to go against on a Mikey boi
---
Definitely not he is a psychopath
---
I don’t have $5 for him though
---
as a pig main-- i don't get it
---
Same I honestly almost want a refund because the perks are so bad. MoM was fun and balanced . Idk wtf the nerfs were for
---
No one likes the music change.
---
With the bike helmet, then yes.
---
No problem, judging by your flair, you are a fellow man of culture!
---
I sure hope so.
---
If that were the case, then you would have a chance, no matter how slim, for none of the boxes to remove the trap. And as far as I know, that's never happened before.
---
Lol Thanks for the confirm, I'd hate to see someone not play a game for a mediocre meme build that benefits no one... thatd be a waste of time for true.
---
Is the Trapper bug still present?
---
Do the offerings dissapear after the event or do you keep them?
---
I just don't think I'll be able to use 10 of these cakes with just Ghostface during this event. I like playing more of the other characters too.
---
Oof legacy for ghostface... thas cool
---
maybe they are new to the game but even still that does suck
---
I only get them on survivor
---
They had those when I jusssst started playing, I even figured out how to use offerings for them!
---
I've definitely had to be strict with myself because I'm honestly surprised how many hours I can waste on this game without even realizing it. My current system when playing is that I'm only allowed to go into a new match once I've recited a stack of flash cards. I have hundreds of cards I need to study so it's been uh... tough. Lol.

Looks good

DISTURBED
---
You have to be joking. Out of 10 games so that should be 40 people, I get 8 that disconnect. That's a fifth of my games that have been fucked by some baby who thinks they shouldn't be hit by the killer. I've had 1 person disconnect on me when I played survivor and that'd cause we were all in the exit gate and someone threw a pebble at him.

The real question has been answered. Your life fulfilled now what shall you do
---
I played against 6 straight ghostfaces today on ps4.  I don't know what you're talking about.
---
Actually hearing that reasoning i like you're idea better overall
---
Yea, I never had such fast lobbies on PS4 as survivor, they are instant. Everyone is playing killer.
---
Yes, I'm disappointed too.  Been waiting weeks for a juicy cosmetic grind :\
---
I don't know, I heard some people run it on 60+
---
I love how every killer just have a build that makes every human on earth want to die 
---
Like NOED nurse
---
If it was the killer doing the body blocking in this instance it wouldn't be sabotage. Now if you block another survivor it would then be gameplay sabotage.
---
Well it was certainly not a niche issue with the launch consoles. They did not even have HDMI out yet.
---
I'm especially interested in the fact it's not just on his base outfit.
---
Looks like devs fucked sounds again, it's not you, it's everyone.
---
I used to be a Quentin main but, y’know, the glory that is Jeff was released.
---
Or insidious Bubba. Fuck my life. ;)
---
Not sure why you got downvoted lol.
---
Gen rush and looping aren't toxic. Killer main btw
---
Me too! All of the HUD stuff was gone and sometimes my weapon
---
I think he was a bit mentally unstable from the get go, maybe had a few screws loose, and being assigned as torture technician for the CIA in a hospital that is secretly a Black Site where he could do anything he wanted (No witnesses, nobody cared what happened to the prisoners, no consequences if you got a little too enthusiastic with your work and accidently killed a few subjects all in the name of national security) eventually sent him off the deep end. 
---
He already had an interest in psychology and the brain before the CIA grabbed him. He killed pretty much everyone in the Black Site and even killed Otto Stamper, his mentor. He apparently strayed from his "job" and tried getting into mind control or something. 
---
Reminds me a bit of [Project MKUltra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra) which was a "Mind Control" thing done by the CIA IIRC. I have a feeling part of The Doctor's "new" backstory was inspired by this. (He was originally going to be based off a chinese doctor who was doing electroshock to internet addicts I think but it was changed)
---
this
---
Has enough time to make a post and shit but not enough time to read the onslaught of posts saying it was extended. 
---
Ggwp
---
there came the bug after the new uptade (3 anniversary) there was an audio bug wherethe terror radius of every killer got really quiet
---
It's because they made it so that when totems and gens are worked on and completed, if a survivor is being chased they get some partial credit.
---
I'm encountering this bug where every survivor I match up against is the most vile, hate-fuelled sadist in the whole world, and they want nothing but my torture and misery. Please remove them.

Nobody knows if he’s being sarcastic. Just thought it make a meme. I guess it’s up to your interpretation as to wether or not he was being sarcastic
---
Welcome to the internet where nothing is sacred and everything is fair game.  Leave your thin skin at the door.
---
His reveal is broken af. I was standing right behind him while he was stalking another person, good 4-5 seconds past, no reveal, I have no idea how to play against him, what devs want from us. He just feels like almost a billy, runs right into your face reveals you in few seconds and downs you with exposed effect. Good game.
---
I've used 500k and haven't seen a single one.

Idk if give survivors a firecracker and a offering for a event is called nailing it but sure

I heard that dbd is a good game, we all hear lies and today you found one out :P

They both look terrible, seem really low effort. Legion mask is too round. Huntress mask just looks cheap or rushed. I also don’t think she has an outfit with just overalls, does she?
---
Yeah, queue times for Killer are usually impossibly long when a new Killer is released.
---
~One Hook away from being taken~
---
Yep 😁
---
I thought they were coming out today too. Kinda bummed I didn't get my new Tapp cosmetics, but I assume it won't be too much longer.
---
Anybody else absolutely hate the new P3 Kate hair? I loved her P3 hair because the blood was so subtle, now it looks like she dyed her whole head red!
---
You still have to double pip, I got a 4K earlier and didn’t get the trophy
---
Low risk high reward 2nd chance perk that gives ridiculously more looptime against m1 killers... ya
---
Yo, I've had too many games where survivors just run straight to heal their buddy because they using Discord.  Damn right I'm salty.  Voice chat isnt in the game for a reason.
---
No, I 4K’ed earlier and didn’t get it
---
Skill floor isn't the problem.
---
Skill ceiling is the problem.
---
Wraith's problem isn't that he's easy to pick up. His problem is that your effectiveness doesn't increase as you put more time into him specifically.
---
1. Protection hits are buggy as all hell and 2. The number is just glitched you do actually have 4 tokens
---
Hey, great news for me, let me bitch a lil bit, I was recently moved to the night shift, so this bloodhunt days all I have been doing is sleep or trying to sleep. So a few more days is actually good so i can at least get some extra BP.
---
Im a good david....but having played as killer i agree completely
---
Paid $60 for the new ffxiv expac with the expectation of not being able to get in till the evening lol
---
Muchas gracias! :)
---
I do admit he takes a fair amount of practice, but the skill ceiling with him is so incredibly high
---
Kinda the same for me, I was moved to the night shift So all I have been doing these days is trying to sleep or sleep. So maybe I'll get to play a bit with this.

---
Last patch was great, with PS4 pro boost mode some maps feel almost 60 fps. More probably to come with dedicated servers and switch release late summer.
---
From a fun standpoint games with more hooks are more fun, and I do tend to leave to let them unhook, mostly because you lose all momentum if you don't, but i agree 9 hooks gets hard. I'll usually get like 5-8, depending on the killer and how they're playing, but the emblem system now makes it really hard to get the adept achievement it sucks. At times it really feels like you get punished for playing a really good game. I know that it's "against lore" and all but still
---
Hmm.. right now I run p1 nea with the siberean tiger pants and the beanie hat. (also  I am lvl 23 p1, and I haven't gotten adrenaline, devisive and self care yet). Overall best cosmetics? 100% Feng Min IF u mix and match yourself.
---
Only conductors use such rash language
---
Thank you for this post. 
---
I’m so glad someone said it. 
---
Today has been flooded with overwhelmingly whiny content. That’s not to say people aren’t entitled to have complaints or questions regarding balance with the new changes... but people are so fast to absolutely trash-talk BHVR into the ground despite the fact that they listen to and engage with their community more than most developers.
---
I have concerns about some of the changes as well but you know my takeaway from today? 
---
1) Bloodhunt extended! ♥️
---
2) A brand new killer that’s been requested for ages to experiment with and against🔪  
---
3) This anniversary event is quite long, and Not_Queen hinted at surprises, I’m excited to check back each day. 🎉 
---
Thank you BHVR. 
---
Keep it up.
---
Any chance this goes on sale during the steam summer sales?
---
By far the worst event
---
I feel this pain greatly.
---
That's so rotten but I can't stop laughing
---
Chill out
---
They were never coming today, they could be released any week between now and the mid chapter patch, they release one or two a week. This week was just the devil Ghost Face
---
What an asshole.
---
It's called farming and yeah its just playing to get a lot of points. Nothing wrong with it and it's pretty helpful at times
---
Not to mention I'm on console, so that doesn't help.
---
Fuck off.
---
There is a new perk icon behind him getting the check.
---
This isn't anything new. My first ever game back when the game became free for ps plus members, I got this. And it's really annoying. However, pc doesn't seem to have this problem.
---
..No? It's really not. Your goal is to kill them, if you prevent them from removing the mask by body blocking all you're doing is killing them
---
Surprise surprise, sound is broken again.
---
What do you mean? On pc it runs pretty well. I get 140 fps constantly, granted it is on low...
---
So I'm new to the game and am still trynna find out what the fuck this trap does as I've never gotten a pig to put one on me
---
Leatherface
---
Same with corn and I actually love it. You can now "ambush" out of the reeds on Yakomota and sneak around in the corn. Earlier Ghostface would be completely screwed by corn because he couldn't stalk through it while survivors could reveal him through it, which was lame as heck.
---
&gt;Salt/Rant
---
Your damn right
---
The Freddy and 2 map reworks, yes, but that's not nearly enough gameplay-relevant stuff for an entire year, especially because it is limited to the experience on those two maps and with that one killer. Like I said, the Archive lore stuff can be cool for some people, just not for me personally. I will probably like unlocking cosmetics that way, though. They did say there will be balancing (so gameplay-relevant stuff) throughout the year, and of course there will be some, but just during the stream, they hardly mentioned anything. I care mostly about gameplay.
---
Ghostface's perks are really rather bad. I'm All Ears is not even worth mentioning, Thrilling Tremors is just a tracking perk, and there are better tracking perks already, and Furtive Chase just has next to no utility, apart from like niche stuff, such as on Freddy (until the rework hits).
---
Same guy let me hatch because teammates left me.
---
Yeah farming isn’t that bad and during these events, is relatively common. A new killer out may even make it more common. 
---
That being said, if you’re running around with the killer pointing out Survivors that just want to play normally and helping him kill them, that is allegedly bannable. Getting some hits (killer) and saves (survivor) is one thing but if the other survivors are not in on it too, it’s a bit cruel and they CAN fairly submit a report ticket.
---
Time to buy an ascot
---
Dark Sense wouldn't buff SWF too much since they know where the killer is all the time.
---
Maybe bunny feng will be possible then if they can do this?
---
Yeah, same glitch is going on right now with BBQ - you have hooked all 4, but only shows 3.
---
hit or miss
---
From what i experienced facing Ghostface, he's moving faster than other killers.
---
His addons or power don't make mention of a movement speed buff so wtf...
---
I know it was extended I just messed up lol
---
Nea has some cool cosmetics - the beanie is probably her best hairstyle because most of her hair cosmetics are really bad 
---
I really like Feng as a survivor, she was the first one I chose to use. I'm not a big fan of her cosmetics, but I understand why some people are
---
Look how they massacred my boy Ash...
---
Ah, that's great tbh
---
I really wish that they had went with MoM activating after 3 safe unhooks instead of protection hits. I hate dealing with protection hit detection and I'm just simply never going to bother with MoM like this. But if they'd made it require 3 safe unhooks that'd be compelling and still a solid Nerf imo, even more of a Nerf really because it's make it impossible for more than 2 survivors in a single match to ever get active MoM so there'd be no more matches with 4 survivors all getting it
---
I think it was tthat dev preview about the Plagues Dev progress, shit was full of memes
---
So. Your on ps4 wjoch means less players. On pc it still takes a while (4-15) minutes at max. But on PS4, everone is going to want to also try the new killer. Trust me  I spent over 300 hours on ps4, I know that the ques are long normally, a new stand alone killer, you already know it's going to take a while.
---
If a generator gets fixed while you're wearing it, it activates it's timer.  When that time ends, you die.  If the timer is active, walking through an exit gate will instantly set off the trap as well.
---
I play Nea and use the Harajuku outfit.. Was my first ever cosmetic and I was so happy!
---
Later learnt it’s known as the “Toxic skin” :(
---
I play Billy on Xbone. It used to be way harder until they optimized frame rates. If you had that ballsy Claudette who got right in your face, your framerate would drop to like 15 and it'd be impossible to get a hit, but now it's much better
---

---
yeah, second game as survivor to play more matches since im a killer main and badinga an ebony mori
---
That’s disappointing. I got my hopes up for nothing
---
We never even got into a game so I never saw it put to place.  But that’s interesting I’d like to try it sometime
---
It’s if other survivors cleanse the totem. It’s to prevent situations where you get chased for 5 gens and depip because you didn’t get altruism/objective points.
---
Well now hold on a minute bud, I was fully aware of how the mechanics work prior to playing and I just finished a game in which ghostface was standing out in the open stalking me, and i'm looking him dead in the face, not more than 15 meters out, his face dead center of my screen. He stalked me til I was exposed despite nothing being in between us to block line of sight
---
I'm all for this new mechanic, but it needs to fucking work 100% of the time on both sides
---
Yeah:( just spent the million on the killer hoping to stack bbq, the cake thing and double bp but uh yeah
---
Welp. Didn’t go on sale
---
I got GF to level 32 so far and have about 10 alongside with some BPS. RNG scuffed.
---
Maybe so. I don't look into the history of asymmetric games that crashed horribly though. Been through one burning wreck enough with F13: The Game. A rarity where each update somehow made the game worse.
---
If you don't loop, you get downed and hooked. If you don't use pallets, you get downed and hooked. Flashlights are barely worth talking about if you put half a braincell of effort into facing a wall. 3 people on one gen means only one gen is getting worked on, and it's slower to do 3 gens with 3 people at a time than 3 gens individually. Further doing gens is literally the only thing survivors can do to accomplish their goal.
---
Camping/tunneling someone early isn't necessary to win if the killer isn't hot garbage and it prevents the player from being able to play the game at all.
---
Like there are other things that killers can do that aren't fun to deal with, but ultimately those other things still allow everyone to actually play the game. That's the real problem, that the killer has the in-game means to effectively prevent at least one person from being able to play the game at all (the survivors can do it, but they have to use comms which are not in game in order to never let the killer find anyone). Since it's also not necessary for the killer to do well, the killer choosing to do it makes them an asshole.
---
Nothing went on sale. Rip
---
/r/ContagiousLaughter
---
Ash vs Evil Dead is a bottomless pit of perfect quotes.
---
Legion Player here. Can confirm this.
---
leaving when the offering doesnt flip * A S C E N D E D*
---
It feels broken, I couldn't reveal him once, even when I was standing right behind him, for good 4-5 seconds. No idea what devs want from us.
---
Any news for that princess outfit for Feng Min? It's all I've ever wanted.
---
I can't even play the event :(
---
Would of been funny if the fire hydrate was replaced with the lit totem
---
Same thing literally just happened to me. They kept farming eachother then quit before their final hook
---
What are you studying? Bird Law? I know a guy.
---
I mean, my feng has the blue mask head, sci fi coat with the mark and the darker pants from the same set (Ussylis Feng Min). Altough I got tired of Feng, and I really like Nea (not because of no0b3). And yes, I'm going for P3 head, the siberian tiger pants and the tank top that has the skull with the 8.
---
Also, Jake is... okay... the colorfull 90s clothes don't bother me as I like to run the killer around  The Demi set up looks "cool". And of course, to top it all of, the Cowboy hat.
---
Overbalance ruins fun aspects of games. Just look at Overwatch, its like shooting water guns at sponges.
---
Yep, I was watching like "wtf, 3 gens right next to each over?" Oh, it's just hooks.
---
I'm a fan of that outfit tbf. :( I didn't realise that, I assumed people would call a No0b3 outfit the toxic Nea
---
rip :/. Maybe play survivor to learn the counters to him, it can really improve your killer games.
---
639k on him and got 0.
---
*ruh roh, it’s rhost face*
---
Then come back tomorrow or something and try again?
---
I’m super friendly, I swear!
---
Pretty sure it’s talking about other Survivors. Like if I cleanse a totem or repair a gen while you’re chase, you’ll get Emblem points.
---
I mean, I've made just two purchases on DBD. The Saw Chapter and Ash, and I did so because I like the characters. But just because I did that, doesn't mean everyone does. Stop jumping to conclusions.
---
Actually yeah I haven’t touched survivor much. Playing against ghostface taught me a few things like ... maybe ghost face shouldn’t use a leather outfit, I can hear him comming. So eh blessing in disguise.
---
Save the best for last, or most OOC perks, paired with dying light.
---
I always forget that pigs are omnivores! Pigs could eat us!
---
New killer released so theres gonna be a lot more people in killer queues right now
---
Instead of having a terror radius he just had extremely loud footsteps
---
Ruin BBQ discordance and something tremors has been working good for me.
---
thats ok, i just had a game as spirit (one of only 2 killers i have rank 3 bbq and chili) where we had 2 of the cakes going and i had them all just try and bm me from the beginning, so instead of being chill like i normally am during events like this, i just slugged them all, got my 92k bp, while they got nothing, and now going to sit in que for another 10 minutes
---
Those were two separate characters. Syaoran was the male child, who had a crush on Yukito, a high school student. He’s also the one who had the energy thing, mostly so that he could end up with Sakura. The teacher thing was with one of Sakura’s female friends (don’t remember her name).
---
It doesn’t offend me, but I’m sure there are people out there (maybe some in your life) who don’t appreciate that kind of language. You don’t have to like it but it’s true, and we can all learn to be better. You can do that or just miss everything cool and die angry.
---
They already know about this and might be putting the fix out in a hotfix soon
---
It was never too loud for the killers anyway. It was always louder on survivors.
---
Survivor:
---
Self-care + No Mither
---
Sprint Burst + Lithe or any other exhaustion perk
---
Killer:
---
Not a combo but Bamboozle on Nurse
---
Also not a combo but Insidious on Huntress or Freddy
---
I didn't even get to home people
---
About freddy and deerstalker, failing a skillcheck by healing a survivor while in dying state will wake that survivor wake up from the dream, and freddy will no longer be able to see his aura
---
I can't even load into the game
---
Yeah don't expect him to be on sale though haven't gotten Plague and Legion DLC yet and was waiting for them to be on sale or till I get enough shards to get them
---
So edgy. Checkmate snowflakes, ThE iNtErNeTz ArE tOo BaDaSs FoR yOu
---
No Mither + Self Care + Adrenline + Unbreakable.
---
delete your pc you Legion scum &gt;:(
---
r/pcmasterrace
---
I'll look for it in a bit
---
Kinda hard to focus on him directly on console, once people get more used to it I’m sure it’ll be fine.. i hope?
---
FeelsConsoleMan
---
Oh that's nice of him
---
Currently rocking:
---
David - Bearded face, threadbare thirties shirt, black military pants
---
Jake - Cowboy hat, threadbare thirties shirt, dirty jeans.
---
Kate, Platinum blonde hair, P1 shirt, Mount climbing pants
---
Agreed, the devs are aware that it is currently too hard to reveal ghostface and announced an upcoming patch were revealing ghostface will be made slightly easier.
---
Steam\steamapps\common\Dead by Daylight\DeadByDaylight\Content\UI
---

---
"There's some Evil Within this locker"
---
Objects WITH Obsessions
---
I honestly don’t see how it was OP. Once they used it and they healed. Their aura is shown to the killer. That being said. I never really ran it in the first place. Pointless perk to begin with.
---
I mean you're killing them in a stupid unfair way, the survivor has litterally no counter to that.
---
As a doctor main get that often. When they see mbuikd I see a dc it two. Sometimes I see all four quit at the same time and I think it's a swf
---
There's no need for finger pointing here. People should be allowed to express their opinions on things without people claiming they are making stuff up. Trying to discredit someone because of their opinion on something is a shitty thing to do, and promotes dangerous behaviour.
---
I buy cosmetics because I think they look cool. I bought Kate's beanie, and her horse sweater. It blends in really well on some maps and I've had killers walk right by me because of it, but that's not why I bought it.
---
Just because someone doesn't do things for the same reason as others (or even the majority) doesn't mean they're lying about it. People shouldn't have to worry about BS like this when they share their views.
---
Spine Chill is definitely one of his biggest weaknesses.
---
I know! I yelled “Holy crap!” when I first saw it.
---
Tbh the fixes just aren’t necessary. Im in green ranks still and they always pull me out fast. I agree with the stun changes and the stalk changes, but the rest is just un needed since he’s in a good spot right now.
---
Man, I should've bought it when it was on the shrine lol.
---
MOM, BT, WGLF &amp; Empathy will become the new meta.
---
Ah. I was wondering why it said that.
---
You can see a red circle filling up on your status icon while he is stalking you, if you keep an eye out for that you'll be able to tell when he is stalking you.
---
Ultimate useless Freddy Build:
---
Overcharge
---
Unnerving Presence
---
Deerstalker
---
I’m all Ears
---
There’s also:
---
No Mither with SC, Solidarity, and Iron Will
---
Nurse with Enduring, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, and Brutal Strength
---
I mean one of Megs hair style lags the entire lobby / game on console, not sure if they fixed it 🤔
---
I think some Feng's look good in game, but I've never really wanted to buy any of her cosmetics, not sure why. Your outfit sounds pretty cool, like some of the ones I've seen in game.
---
Nea has quite a lot of cool cosmetics - I think the hair lets her down, so the beanie is probably the best thing to wear (so P3 makes sense.)
---
I like colourful 90s clothes irl and wear them (not tracksuits like Jake) so I'm quite into it. I think he has some other pretty cool items in the store too
---
Yea one of them dc when I stoped chasing them to get the other from picking up the person I knocked
---
BUT THREE EXTRA PERCENT!
---
I'm sure you are, most Bea's are pretty cool!
---
They are very rare but you are especially unlucky
---
Self Care + No Mither + Solidarity + adrenaline? (if u can ger past the speed boost) and a purple med kit with 2 insta heals and an alturism offering. Done.
---
Freddy: haha look at my useless normal hand
---
“BBQ doesn’t actually do anything.” “If the killer isn’t Billy or Nurse, the aura reading is almost completely negated” Actually it’s good on all killers, you know where the survivor is, and you know if they’re farther or closer, it’s especially good on all killers it you’re hooking the second to last person, so that you can head straight to them so they don’t get hatch.
---
Oh oh! Let me guess! Red ranks!? :D
---
I got 7 on trapper with only 500K
---
Really? Played a couple rounds against him but I didn't see the circle until I was exposed, I thought only the killer could see it.
---
Show the whole screen.
---
Why should I patrol gens when I know that survivors aren't working on them and instead throwing themselves at a hooked survivor over and over again? It's not toxic to stay in an area where you know other survivors are, thinking otherwise is toxic entitled survivor delusion. The same kind of person who runs balanced landing and haddonfield offerings. Baby survivor...
---
Sure, but that's an obvious strawman. You can't just put words in my mouth and argue against a point I never mentioned.
---
Well, the best perk to counter him is Object of Obsession. You’ll pretty much know his location at all times. However this perk is pretty dangerous to use as it also reveals you to the Killer, so newer players can have a lot of trouble with this perk. Spine Chill should be good against him, and it’s a neutral perk.
---
I got 2 in 80k
---
Yes, its under known bugs
---
Only if you're the killer. If you're a survivor, you don't see anything until you're already exposed.
---
It went from black too a dark grey. You are over reacting if you think a refund is in order. It would be like buying cloths that are black, but after a year they lightend up from other cloths so you demand a refund for it. It’s stupid, just don’t use the cosmetic.
---
The entire term is ridiculous. Killer is chasing one survivor at a time, the other three are supposed to patiently wait their turn to run away?
---
Wow. This was crazy!
---
**WAAAZZUUUUUPPPP**
---
Probably. I still play solo but I would much rather play with friends, that way we can communicate and all talk shit when the killer is toxic or pay to win.
---
He can also pretty much only get one exposed at a time, if he gets two chances are he'll only get one of them down as the timer would run out by then. I see why people think he's OP but you gotta realize you can look at him and poof his power is gone.
---
Deerstalker can help Freddy see downed survivors, even when they're close to him, so I wouldn't say it useless, just suboptimal.
---
The Plague can only affect a generator for a relatively small amount of time. The survivor can also be anywhere on the map if more than a few survivors are already infected. I don't Surveilance has any negative interaction with the Plague.
---
Overcharge can work on Freddy, especially of used with Huntress Lullaby. Default skill check regression is 10%, Overcharge increases that to 15%, Lullaby increases that to 21%. Every time a survivor fails a Overcharge skill check, it regresses the generator almost as much as Pop Goes The Weasel. It also resets the dream world so you can pull them in again to force them to fail another skill check, and it allows you to kick the generator again.
---
Bitter Murmur do stack, I'm not sure what you're talking about with that, but yes, running them together is suboptimal. Bitter Murmur gives better information on the survivors it affects, but only affects a few survivors at a time, and Rancor gives less useful information but affects everyone on the map and allows you to kill the obsession at the end.
---
Oh i thought the survivors could see it too, maybe I'm wrong, I'll have to check again!

---
Since you’re not getting the point, I’ll put it this way. 
---
If BBQ was a perk without the extra bloodpoints and just the aura reading, nobody except Billy and Nurse would run it.
---
Damn it, I try to avoid DBD, because I like normal matches and I feel bad when I play normaly during 2x blood points
---
You try looking at him while he's looking at you. He gets you exposed before you can stop him.
---
Lol typical excuses. You shouldn’t be allowed to even purchase the game. Like all the fog whisperer dickriders for cote and not queen. Pure idiacy
---
You know they're either noobs, or smart enough to hide behind a gen or in a locker... That's all it tells you.
---
In what universe? 
---
He was one of the most unrepentant killers in the game.
---
Yes! I have the puppet for Ash, and he looks very handsome wearing it.
---
David's new outfit is cool, I play on Xbox so we finally have a character smoking a cigarette. I think Jake looks good in any outfit, if he's wearing the cowboy hat!
---
Kate sounds good, but I don't really like Feng's LNY hairstyle for some reason
---
Nah, I just screenshotted the actual cleansing progress bar and spent around 15 mins in PS
---
It doesn’t look that bad at all mate. Saying it looks like shit and the devs should revert it is a bit much. It’s not that big a deal and I feel there are much worse things in the patch that should be talked about more then a slight change on certain cosmetics.
---
He probably had add ons that make it a lot longer, Ive been revealed plenty of times on PS4 and it takes forever if you put on those add ons that I have time to reset the counter
---
I learned as a survivor how bad it was, and then copied it. lmao
---
https://i.imgur.com/e62u807.png for EAC response
---
can't find the BHVR response, but they legit said "We won't hunt anyone using it, but if EAC bans you, we can do nothing about it"
---
it that happens, you can email EAC and they will unban you. there has been no confirmed ban for that from EAC yet tho. some people claimed that but BHVR confirmed they banned them for something else every time
---
Same. Now just take out my saltiness on other survivors as the cancerous doctor. ;)
---
They dont see it
---
It's a known bug. Been happened to me as well. Sometimes you can break them out easy sometimes I've literally walked up behind him and did the point animation 5 or 6 times before it revealed him. Hopefully will be fixed in a patch soon.
---
I like running those:
---
Meg - Black tennis top and skirt, long red hair
---
Kate - Alpine outfit with brunette hair (I like having the impression of playing Lara Croft)
---
Feng - LNY head with Let's Coffee jacket and black pants
---
David - Black security outfit with cap, I like to use him to protect my teammates at all costs 
---
Nea - Harajuku top and slim pants, and I'm saving up for her green hair (which is such a grind)
---
Jake - Grim matsuri outfit and beard
---
I'm the same I play solo because sometimes I have to but in my opinion it is much better played with friends
---
that was waaay back , this leatherface was from last year you know that
---
&gt;You realize that survivors used to be able to sabo every hook in the entire map, right, creating an unwinnable condition for play?
---
New players have no idea what the history of the game is and talk diarrhea like you do all day.
---
+515%
---
geez
---
The only thing affected really is hair. There's some clothing that's more detailed now. That's about it.
---
As much as I want this what would his power be though?
---
Uuuuhh... until you get 3 immersed people, not doing gens, crouching to you whilst your on the hook (without Urban Immersion) and rocking them standard clothes. I still play solo, because 2 of my possible friends to play with literally hate the game so much, that they bought it just to prove a point, and another guy from finland that I've never met irl that thinks the game is too scary. Yeet.
---
This is really REALLLY exceptional!! Do you have a patreon or any sort of tutorials online? I'd loveeee to learn from you!
---
same on ps4
---
3 year anniversary and they are still making rookie mistakes.
---
Or even the noed icon, just sorta overlooked it, made it at like 3 but didn’t post
---
Add ons were commons and they were power recovery and KI slightly increased
---
Nooo, Unbreakable is actually good with No Mither! Especially with the buff. Now you can pick yourself off the ground more times than you would normally. I think it's 11 or so.
---
Yikes, preciate you though. Hope it's fixed soon
---
Still original
---
had this Issue the whole day on every map, I also have no Terror Radius sound.....
---
Once you get it down it becomes really easy to do. 
---
One tip: you'll know if you are breaking him out of stealth if you hear a distinct whooshing noise, like Spirit's phasing sound.
---
Object of obsession, nurses and generator pops are working for me on Xbox.
---
The entitlement is strong with this one
---
That’s what I meant boss. Because the meme refers to Amanda. The killer. Lol.
---
Yeah basically all of the music is ridiculously quiet rn, even the Haddonfield intro.
---
If someone fails a skillcheck, you'll probably know where they are anyway. Plus, Deerstalker only covers about 24 meters that Freddy doesn't get, and one will know where a downed survivor is if you're Freddy. Really no point to using Deerstalker.
---
I shouldn't be surprised.
---
I never put any words in your month. I only said that your logic of &lt;&lt;it's their only objective&gt;&gt; is flawed. The comment about complaining about a killer tunneling serves as an example of said flawed logic.
---
Laurie
---
Object of Obsession counters him hard, and Sole Survivor will only make that stronger. Decisive Strike is also good for if Ghostface decides to tunnel or harass you.
---
Hmm. I will try uninstalling it, see if that helps. 3 games on both ends and not a single game worked. Thanks for your feedback
---

Which was my concern, thanks for the input on details though
---
Feng, Ace, Claudette.
---
Nurse
---
He's taking a fat shit
---
Haha, that's pretty low tier tbh, I had a game (on Xbox btw) against him where I couldn't wiggle or point after he downed me with his power, then that game I got downed while running out the exit gate and I didn't leave. I was stuck crawling around out of the map waiting on the ECG timer to run out with him just standing at the gate, staring at me
---
Basically I think he's very broken
---
Salt but true lol
---
Leaving
---
Talking about this line from the patch notes.
---
&gt;* Adjusted certain darker cosmetics that gave players an advantage to be lighter.
---
Claudette's default and brown cosmetics are brighter. Adam's black trench coat is brighter, but his pants look the same. Those are the ones I noticed and I'm pretty sure they only changed survivors.
---
Recently got my Amanda to p3 level 50
---
But then every killer is ebony ghostface
---
The rank reset doesn't help. If you don't play for 2 months you go down to like 17.
---
Its been 84 years...
---
Rarely
---
Usually 3-4 times a year
---
P3 Claud Head

And I still get called a Blendette by Dwights with black shirts who are more of a Blendette than I am.
---
Their latest DLC usually does not go on sale during the sales w/ the rest of the DLCs
---
Wanna show those perks bud
---
Yeah, just like Mettle of Man. From broken-tier to complete trash. Balancing at its finest.
---
Any chance you could upload an image?
---
I just had one sat a few feet in front of me stalking. I stared right at him thinking surely I'm safe...., I kept staring just to see how broken it was, the reveal sound didn't start not even once. Next thing I'm exposed. He's definitely broken as fuck right now when it comes to revealing him. Funny to see people crying about not nerfing him when in fact what they're apparently asking for is for him to be immune to being revealed.
---
Yikes

Why would you spend shards on bloodpoints
---
I'm not afraid to tell the truth. lol
---
lol at your comment getting downvoted by a salty killer main. He's broken as fuck but apparantly thats what some people want.
---
Honestly? Good question
---
He posts on every Pig-related post here, I guess?
---
Ghost faces are the most toxic killers.
---
Earlier I discovered that the EGC actually causes you to drop the survivor. So that happened and then it glitched. It made me drop Kate, then it did the kill animation but it glitched. It just sat there wriggling for a couple seconds and then the Entity spike went straight up her asshole.
---
They're just glad it's 2xbp or they thought you were farming.
---
Haven't seen his addons, what does this do?
---
If you’re playing on PS4 don’t get your hopes up lots of players don’t buy dlc for some reason
---
I've noticed this too. Not only because new killer and double points. Even when shit is normal its still been taking a very long time to find a match as a killer. Survivor, I'm in a lobby in seconds. killer is a different story. I remember going in as a killer before and getting into a match within a minute every time . Definitely something wrong with the matchmaking for the killer side
---
Hate farming. It's boring as shit. Just play the damn game. That being said I'm not going to throw a fit if the killer is farming I'll just do my gens and move on to the next game.
---
BBQ was the first perk on my GF, meta perks are boring tbh I'll swap ruin and try new perks that would work on him
---
long chase = loads of bloodpoints
---
it was also too loud for survivors
---
It can also be used during a Chase to lethal effect because the only way to stop his night shroud is to have your character look in his direction for about 5 seconds which gives him time to attack so unless you have a teammate trying to cancel his power your in trouble.
---
Another thing is when he's sneaking and you try to counter his power he's giving a mark that tells him someone is looking at him and what direction they are hiding and if they manage to stop his power their exact location is shown to him.
---
Can you put a “glasses” filter on this image
---
The only things that killers can do affecting survivors bloodpoints is bloody party streamers (and the cake one in this event) both boosting them so if you used either of those, it was probably genuine but otherwise it was probably salt
---
Ace is my main, so most of my outfits are on him.
---
And almost all of them look (intentionally) dumb as fuck. Because Ace is one of the funniest Survivors imo, so it only makes sense to give him overly ridiculous cosmetics.
---
Oh haha, I tried my absolute best and struggled for so long. I guess he thought I was faking it 🙈Thanks for clarifying :)
---
Stop with that bullshit "main" thing, like it's "us vs them", doesn't help anything get done.
---
If assume wasting shards
---
There's music it's just insanely quiet. Applies to killer as well.
---
Say what you will about the plague. But no killer in game has a better voice line for being pallet stunned. YAHH YAHHH
---
Lol, well idk why they say that, because you clearly stand out! Sounds like a pretty cool outfit - I like the blight shirt quite a lot.
---
The rest of the message was pretty friendly, I think it was because I struggled to catch him, which lead to a long chase
---
Smart dude
---
How's the knife gonna work with the current swipe animations?
---
I don't really play the game, so I don't know too much about all the systems and all, but I do know, that the player probably got a lot of bloodpoints, because he was chased for a long time, probably used pallets, maybe stunned you etc. All of those actions grant the survivor bloodpoints and if he was playing as good, as you say, he definitely got a lot.
---
If you have a bad game you get t bagging and hate messages. If you have a good game you get disconnects and hate messages.
---
And a grammar check
---
i only see moris lol
---
Would buy in a heartbeat...nice job!
---
Yup, he ended up with lots. He definitely thanked me for the (unintentionally long) chase. :)
---
Feng’s black skinny jeans are brighter.
---
Ty
---
Unfortunately no
---
It’s a hard cap. Anything you do that would go over that cap will be wasted.
---
Yeah chased do give you a lot of bloodpoints, it's just a weird way to word it. Normally GG or WP is what's said when not being salty. Thanks for the bloodpoints can be genuine or sarcastic which is the problem with messages as you can't tell
---
Yeah he's not bad, just thought the name and loadout was funny for day one ghostface
---
It’s honestly one of my favorite maps for Trapper, or a lot of killers tbh, I like the game for some reason. (Also trapper darkening add ons be god like haha)
---
I mean, you gotta have the pebble
---
Very deadly for Killer Mains
---
Welcome to the internet where people are still human beings and a callous piece of shit is still easy to spot!
---
I’m kinda on the fence about her (I say as i prepare to level up to prestige 2). She’s really fun and can be very powerful. However, when she doesn’t work, and they get the traps off right away, she’s basically just Wraith 2.
---
Wow I only get teammates that unhook me in front of the killer without borrowed time.
---
I used to think Ace was one of the worst survivors, until I tried him and now I love him. He has some great cosmetics - I bet you can make him look so stupid tbf :p
---
Kind of like my Jake, wearing the tracksuit and cowboy hat. I've had a few messages of people ripping into my outfit choice
---
Not really nerfed already been getting maps like or none or brick jungle gyms with dark moon lighting, she is still invisible, if they even did buff her lighting it was minor lmao
---
Actually that would be nice or at least reveal the killer after getting protection hits and unhooks for the same amount of time like BBQ.
---
I wouldn't click the send button to that love letter until after the hot fix.
---
Bearded David pretty cool - but in my eyes big Dave has to be topless
---
You need to wait 2 seconds I believe to pull him out of the stalk also spotting him is kinda broken at the moment so that could be why or if he has 2 purple add-ons called victims detailed routine and Driver's licenses he becomes very hard to detect. I think they stack I'm unsure though.
---
Did they make any changes to the killer pipping system? (Sorry to lazy to look it up)
---
No offense but yes you can. Be a better survivor. And like I said decisive strike is basically anti-tunnel. 
---
And honestly it's probably more your fault than you think if it's happening to you so much.
---
It's really tense. Even as killer my heart beat starts going insane.
---
Hell naw.  
---
Grinding for perks is such a chore.
---
Yeah I'd rather run bond and try to find someone to heal me so we can also get a gen after.
---
A purple hatchet huntress doesn’t need full map control. Just needs to get one down then camp the hook from a far enough distance to one shot out of terror radius with M&amp;A. That’s what she did. No one could save. One person DC’ed. 
---
I never mentioned what she was running, BTW. Don’t make assumptions. I don’t care about ruin. You can gen tap almost as quickly if you know how to do it right. 
---
The game was over so quickly and even the killer only got about 10k with 1 DC and 3K. It was a waste during double Bloodpoints where you want people to save and stack points.
---
OOF
---
Staying in an area isn't an exploit, are you brain-dead? And again, how is one a 'dickridersss' when they don't even care about the person that you're accusing of being blindly defended? And if camping a hook should be a ban worthy offense in your eyes, camping the myers house with balanced landing should be one as well, it is an 'exploit', after all.
---
He’s been puked on one too many times.
---
They should listen to the oitcrying toxic unadaptable survivors!!
---
With today'a update, the game does feel smoother, however, since the game saves everytime after you get a node from the bloodweb now, it does slow down a lot, making levelling an even bigger chore because of all the frame drops.
---
Same
---
Looks great but still fuck the legion.
---
It foes the same thing, but now the conditions to activate it was changed to make it harder to get to 3 stacks, therefore it was a nerf.
---
Didn't they buff left behind so that it's 75% for each gen instead of 25? It's still hairless, but they tried.
---
And this is why he's being "nerfed". It's extremely hard to break his stalk.
---
Blood points don't give any advantage. killers and survivors should both profit heavily from matches. Just because there's 4 of us doesn't mean we're sharing all the points we get....
---
I literally just got the teachable MoM perk yesterday, I feel cheated on.
---
It's because they didn't before, only when not interacting with anything and/or moving.
---
Killer main here I think this is overpowered needs to be 200% repair speed penalty and you literally can't move. 
---
also NOED is balanced. Adrenaline bad
---
It usually takes a little bit for update. When Ash came out, the updated achievements weren't there for like a day lol
---
Theres multiple videos circulating youtube from content creators showing them standing in an open space stalking people to max even though they are being looked at. When i played against him, it was almost impossible to break him out. My whole character was facing ghost face and nothing happened, it didnt even start to break him out. Hell, i even followed him around staring at him trying to break his power(i could tell his power was working because no red stain and no heartbeat). His powes either still bugged or its just really really hard to break his power now.
---
i have almost 1500 hours. ive had this happen a lot and i still enjoy solo
---
Sounds like all good changes. Hopefully this balances him a bit more.
---
Cool insight on the situation ! but the terrifying bug that let me leave the gates and not be able to escape was like... (gosh...) hahahhaha
---
Dude. Its not matchmaking. Its the fact that litrtrely everyone is playing killer.
---
Dude just play plague you don't have to see them just spray and pray. Works every time
---
Conversely I get survivors dcing constantly, usually after they tbag and flash me at a pallet only to run directly into a trap.
---
Seriously people DC against me constantly and I main trapper and wraith. Almost always because they were the first down or they tried to be cheeky then immediately ate shit. 
---
I'm not saying you've never had crybaby killers who DC, but stop acting like there aren't survivors playing the same shitty way.
---
Thnx dude
---
That wont fix it nor would anyone use it.
---
This shit happens to me every game, even when I use detection add-ons
---
You're lucky, I still haven't seen one.
---
That's all good, and maybe I'm the one misunderstanding you. But Remember how the non-original, non-licenced characters can be bought with Iridescent shards? For example, if you don't own the flesh and mud DLC you can buy the Hag with shards. Excluding the Licensed characters that adds more Shards that can be bought with shards and none that require cells.
---
Also, if 24/60 were cell exclusive, that means 36/60 were not, so that should bot have decreased the percentage.
---
Hey at least it's not that hag body pillow
---
I would use it
---
Yes! And I love it! Very Farrah Fawcett
---
Insanity... Guess I am staying up to grind for another 2 days
---
But he said he has them? That’s why I’m confused. 
---
I’ve tried just about everything. I gotta get my 100% back lmao. Maybe I should just give the game a break and let it do its thing.
---
DS becomes useless once the timer runs out. I’m either in a too long chase or by the time he gets me, he won’t even pick me up. 
---
So yeah, anything else? 
---
And sure, just blame it on me without even knowing how I play like. You’re right. Killers are not toxic. Survivors are. Right.

In one of the post I encountered one who beg to differ. What do you think about their theory
---
I am also having this, but only through my headset. When I put the game sounds through my speakers it's fine. Hopefully it's fixed as of right now its unplayable.
---
You have to get a 2 pip Lmfao
---
I don't see how this would prevent that over getting points if gens get done while you're in a chase, but whatever.
---
Stupid achievement
---
The bug is only visual brochacho, slow your roll

Here's a tip. Meg's quick and quiet perk completely eliminates the noise of any rushed actions once every minute or so.
---
Must work differently for different people.
---
I'd say quit app and give it some time. Should be updated soon.
---
If you care that much about BPs then play Killer. 
---
Pretty simple solution.
---
Man, this might be unpopular but this sound change is a blessing. I can hear everything. Claudettes in the swamp isn't a problem anymore, i can hear them. I hope they keep this changes or at least let you control the volume of the music.
---
Just played against Ghosty for first time on ps4. Either I’m shit (I am) or he’s nerfed to high heaven. Takes 5 seconds of staring even looking at him to get to exposed, instant downs and no terror radius.
---
Wasn’t aware ash’s had this same issue, I didn’t play the day he came out. Thanks boss.

That’s wrong. If you hook someone after end game collapse you get 250 for “late hook”, 500 for “hooked”, 500 for “late sacrifice”, and 200 for “sacrifice”. You also get 200 for “entity summoned” if  they’re on their second hook. You also get 250 deviousness points for closing the hatch, which means you get a total of 1000 extra points. The deviousness points aren’t that big of a deal though since most killers have it maxed by the end of the match anyways. The extra 750 in the sacrifice category is nice because you don’t have to get 12 hooks to max it out. To summarize things up, before EGC you get 500 for “hooked”, 200 for “entity summoned”, and 200 for “sacrifice.” During EGC you get all of that plus 250 for ‘late hook”, and 500 for “late sacrifice.”
---
TLDR; You get all the regular points plus extra “late” points if you hook a survivor during EGC.
---
Oh shoot, for how long? Or is it just a "notification" like when a Survivor screams?
---
Such cute
---
My Ghostface is literally swimming in them. I suppose it's luck.
---
WAaaaSSSSSSAAAAAHHH???
---
It was during the 3 Year livestream but I will see if I can find a clip of it. I may be wrong, for some reason, I seem to remember that though.
---
It got a rework that pleased only 1 side which isn't really fair is it since we seem to all be about "equality" on this sub.  BL is good but there's really only one map you can really loop with it which is true. And dead hard has easy counter play like I said. I don't know if I can dumb that down for you anymore without typing in gibberish lol. I'm trying to have a discussion about but you seem to be caught in your petty feelings too much to discuss it 😂.
---
No this rule is for doing stuff that STOPS the game from progressing ie: game can never end if the bodyblocker doesnt move.
---
Standing in front of a jigsaw box is legal, no offense there literally. They will die but then the game ends so its not bannable.
---
I hope you guys are as fun to play against as you sound. Sounds like fun!
---
yes sir, may i have another?
---
I met a person who implied otherwise. This were their words
---
call me biased BUT!
---
i would rank doctor into the insanity tier Because i personally headcanon him as someone who was extremely vulnerable because of the era he was born in and when he grew up.
---
i did the math here as well. i gave his age an estimation (35) and he was taken by the entity in 1983. from 1948, he was a kid and a teenager during the civil rights era. how in the living fuck would he have been able to become a medical “professional” immediately after this? because keep in mind, the theory is that the cia picked him up right out of high school or at the most one year in college, making the year 1967 or 1968. the civil rights era’s end is typically marked at 1968. 
---
1968 makes sense here because given the state of the country at that time, i thought it was a little weird. my theory was that the cia manipulated him into joining them because he was desperate to succeed despite the world he lived in. he probably wasn’t even actually in college. the cia wanted *incredibly* smart people working with them, but societal norms at that time didn’t allow that to happen in a traditional way.
---
we can probably infer that herman was at léry’s for a while. léry’s changed from an actual hospital  to what it became in 1967. hmm.
---
the devs said the entity has an ability to corrupt people. the nurse was depressed and vulnerable and the entity took notice. the doctor was vulnerable because he was an african american working as a fake doctor and pressured to torture people (to me his lore implies that he didn’t want to originally hurt people and wanted to help.) he was given the tools to hurt, and the entity saw this and made him do it. his lore implies that he changed (speculating here.)
---
as for when he laughs his ass off when he’s shocking the shit out of people, did it not occur that maybe he’s actually in a lot of pain? god damn the man has wires and coils literally lodged and forced everywhere into his body. that shit holding his face open wasn’t by his choice either. the devs confirmed that in some livestream. laugh through the pain, i guess? his brain may be completely fried and he may not even be too lucid we’re not entirely sure.
---
oh my god i’m writing so much here but i also wanted to note something else. the quotes on his addons (specifically carter’s notes,) are “crudely annotated” and has really aggressive and nonsensical writing that is not the same from his other writings that sounds like someone with very good vocabulary and someone well educated wrote it. still corrupted, but not as fucked.
---
sorry if this is A LOT of words but i am DEVOTED and lonely
---
edit: i was unaware i made the fatal mistake of using “livid” instead of “lucid” because i’m literally blind and i don’t pay attention
---
Jeepers Kreepers would have been perfect model wise but thats not going to happen.
---
There would need to be a collision mechanic as well, afterall this is a flesh and bone creature.   Same delay as a pallet I guess.
---
So I thought I'd be smart, and be a survivor instead *cue moonwalking Ghostface*
---
Doesnt matter its not bannable, might be considered scummy but its not bannable.
---
cant
---
At least BBQ was in the shrine about a month (or two?) ago.
---
Thank goodness. It was hell to find 4 blendettes on a macmillen map. Post game chat they told me I missed them multiple times when they hid im the shadows.
---
[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/2uMtcES.jpg) some of the current outfits I'm currently using in a very lazily put together picture. David's my go to survivor so I jump between a bunch of different outfits, but the first is my usual outfit and the last one is the one I've been using a lot recently.
---
&gt;picks you up
---
&gt;drops you instead of hooking you
---
&gt;closes the hatch instead of hooking you
---
&gt;"you are the luckiest bitch"
---
Mate I just think you're too greedy.
---
Four seconds, like BBQ. So basically you can see all survivors when you down a marked survivor, thus allowing you to decide what you want to do next. Can be a pretty powerful build for a slugging ghostface.
---
The only thing I would change is have the stalk meter deplete for the survivor if they are in the process of detecting you.
---
Ducking back in and out from behind a tree to stalk somebody right in front of you is pretty abusable.
---
Probably because it pretty much *is* a store bought Kid's halloween costume. They collaborated with a halloween costume company to get his mask.
---
Wazzzzzzzaaaaapppp
---
Triple blood points: random killer, random add ons and random perks.
---
Yea I’d probably do it.
---
Replace the offering with an ebony mori and you got my first game against Ghostface. I somehow miraculously made it to hatch but it was not a fun match by any means
---
How I feel about the Ghostface running this exact build but with an Ebony Mori. He'd facecamp with Night's Shroud too.
---
Now if the others could get some new designs
---
Then moried
---
Its hard for them to understand what a bannable offense is lol.
---
Example, BF3 base raping is not bannable but its very unfair, you just circle spawn in a chopper and get free kills basically invunerable.
---
However, glitching into a wall IS bannable because its an exploit.
---
Hey now, Tru3 only argues from Facts &amp; Logic so that must be factually and logically true.
---
I like the idea of lowering the volume to let you hear more effectively, but it’s lowered to the point where I can barely hear the close terror radius, which is a shame because the soundtrack is amazing
---
Yeah I love the sound of that! I don't mind that people want to make their characters look really good, but I think stupid outfits are a lot better
---
Feelings? I speak objective facts. Your opinions of various perks and ideas do not make sense if you’re good at the game. I can only assume that if you truly believe the nonsense you speak, you’re bad at the game. 
---
I’ll leave you with two tips of knowledge to hopefully make you better at the game. 
---
Any map with a building with a two story is good for Balanced Landing. And if you’re in a position that your dead hard gets baited out (probably because you’re trying to avoid a hit) then you don’t know how to use dead hard.
---
Haven’t quite got the feel for it yet. Some survivors easily pull me out while others can’t. It seems to be an awkward mechanic.
---
I havent play him, but playing against him feels a lot like playing against a juiced up Myers. He can do the thing that puts exposed on you faster than Myers and he can do it while walking after you I think. So he cant insta down an entire team like Myers can, but in a 1v1 he feels like a better Myers imo.
---
It's a mystery why they can't get out of grey ranks.
---
I mean your title says "all day" so I just assumed.
---
That's the same problem I've been having. I feel like they rushed it instead of adjusting the volume on the actual chase music and not just the whole terror radius as a whole.
---
There really is a Boogeyman in the house.
---
👌
---
So what do you call 50% of the time ? Half the time ? Is that a small number ? Every second game - how does it sound. Sounds like an usual place to me - if its not here it is there

And however shitty it is, its their right to be like that lol, no rules broken. Plus heaps of players across heaps of games have that mentality all the time.

It's either that or just wear the default clothes but wear a common shirt and tie from the store.

Ye, gonna get a bunch of people running alerting perks to counter the stealth killers but this will only remain until people just go back to the current meta
---
Healing, too? Can't wait to use it for my meme self-caring build. Botany, Resilience, and now Wake Up. That's like 78% self-care speed now, I think.
---
It's like a bloody party streamer but with 103% bps
---
Poor killer had a pallet thrown on them :( the toxicity!
---
It is, and it isn't. It's what spirit fury should have been imo. Spirit fury means the survivors have to stun you AND you need enduring for it to be of any real use.
---
This perk is like a mix of the 2 BUT there's a consequence to getting stunned, as it resets the perk and you gotta break the 5/4/3 pallets again - which makes more sense than encouraging the killer to get stunned imo. 
---
Imagine a survivor dropping a pallet and you immediately just walk right through it. Would be epic.
---
Sorry I can't hear tone over the internet
---
I agree
---
I do think the pallet stun change is reasonable though, he shouldn’t be able to be in stealth when he gets stunned by a pallet.
---
I mean I hide in bushes as Jane and don’t get seen as well .....
---
yeah, i have a feeling it's become useless again once the initial hype for ghostface dies down
---
Dont worry mate i understand you, i get lumped in with "killers too" rather than being judged by my actions. I hope we get a game together some day.

Hence the thread flair.
---
Maybe something like murder mystery or hide and seek. They could also add new objectives
---
No clue.
---
I ain’t saying only Claudette can do it, just pointing out this map is so survivor sided
---
I highly approve of these observations, to this day I still have the same issue with Clown
---
I’m gay anyways man
---
There a purple addon where you literally need to be within dick sucking range to know him out of it.
---
How is "The Game" the worst map for Trapper?
---
No I'm saying survivors have always had an unfair advantage at the highest levels of play
---
At most 2 weeks or at least 1 week till we start seeing the average self care, exhaustion perk, borrowed time etc. But it's nice especially when you are using a killer that doesnt rely on stealth like Billy or spirit
---
Pizza man dwight and nothing else cause i dont like survivor's
---
you must be new to this game lol
---
it’s always been a shitshow
---
I mean, wait for the buff mid-chapter and see if these offerings are still usable after the celebration, then we may see whether or not this is extremely unlucky.
---
My brain says Tommy as a Survivor. But my heart and soul scream LaChappa.
---
Yes objective facts and not opinions 😂 that's a big sentence there for you buddy I'm not sure you understand what that means. That's fine if you think I'm bad at the game. My performance in a game doesn't affect my life the same way I'm sure it affects yours 😉. Thanks for the not so obvious brain dead tip. Couldn't figure how the perk worked. I guess the next tip you're gonna tell me is if I running vault a window with lithe I will get a speed boost lmao. Obviously no one knows how to use dead hard but you. They should just remove it from the game and make it only accessible to you because no one else can figure out how to use this  perk the way you do because it's just too complicated lmao.
---
I mean if the killer is face camping no perk will help there... except Kindred for the hooked guy
---
DH is amazing for extending chases and loops, you just have to use it correctly 
---
DS is still good if you don't make it obvious you have it. 
---
And MoM is fine still
---
Dwight can look cool/stupid it a bunch of outfits I think. Mine wears the red shirt and tie, with red trousers and the helmet. He looks terrible
---
Yes I'm very well aware that you're salty. Also not sure why you THIS mad about a video game but that's besides the point. It honestly wasn't clear that you were exaggerating. It could've been either way. 
---
And it's not like that changes my point. If it's happening to you a lot to the point you need to complain like this, it's very possible that's it's something to do with you.
---
What a well balanced killer, easily s tier
---
:)
---
I have proudly stuck with kate. As soon as she appeared I instantly p3ed that
---
That would work well with Legion.
---
Fair enough, it's a solid outfit! I always wear the helmet when I play as Dwight
---
Comment is meaningless. Thanks for stopping by.
---
Power is a solid 7/10
---
Looks are 8/10 (bonus points for being licensed with cosmetics)
---
Teabagging ability is a 10/10
---
Mine is the same as yours but I have mechanics head cause smoking is cool
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Haven't seen if they changed is brown clothes yet, but if they haven't i'm going in as camo Dwight.
---
Respectable
---
It is cool! I haven't bought it yet, but I really should soon
---
I kinda want Scarecrow Ghostface, or maybe a Silver 25th edition mask that you have to unlock somehow.
---
The red is actually decently dark. I feel like it's worth it for the look.
---
Your Dwight and first David look great! I want that panda t-shirt so bad :(
---
Your Jake looks ridiculous lol but I think it's funny
---
They only camp
---
He didn't even drop it when I got Mori'd by ghostface earlier lmao.
---
That’s like average income for Dubai tbh
---
Good choice! Anything to help save our Dwight's
---
I really like how the red marks on his back look, but a grey or preferably black variant would be cool.
---
Dude, I'm saying survivors are dickheads when they do those things that I said. I know killers do the same but we're talking about aurvivors.
---
Same here, I finally got it and the difference is night and day. Now I just need enduring and ideally a better spirit fury and haunted grounds.
---
Inactive traps don't trigger. Their trap was active therefore it would have killed them if they tried to leave.
---
He’s our Grand Dictator, and he’s dedicated to Piggy and is loyal to Amanda
---
This shit happens to me every game. From behind hills and through walls.
---
Can only speak for Xbox, but the frames have been really questionable since the patch.
---
I'm saying moris should be able to be used without dickheads leaving and wasting your shit.
---
it's also nice having a new killer that's actually scary too, some of the other newer ones like legion or clown don't have as much fear in them like ghostface and myers do
---
It's not like Spinechill or premonition are worthless normally. People just don't like perks that aren't Adrenaline or an exhaustion perk.
---
When you hold them hostage its bannable unless they die because death is an escape aka a course to end the game
---
Yes indeedy
---
He's a tough man - being killed didn't even phase him
---
You’ll be ready for the the year four anniversary.
---
Thats hardly what Im doing. Im making sweeping assumptions about the general community based on what they have said. I never implied nobody-fuckin-period buys just for perks. Relax dude.
---
People report a ton of stuff, but that doesn't mean it gets fixed. Hell the sound bug is still in, despite it being present at the start of the PTB. Don't blame PC players for this.
---
What does that have to do with anything. We're saying that people who leave are pussy especially when they are first hook or being moried.
---
That's the sad thing, these perks are necessarily bad it just others are way better and have more usage/less situational
---
A pornhub thot?
---
Underrated reply.
---
I'm gay and that didn't even offend me since I hate swf so much. Ruins the game.
---
you can't win a staring contest vs him. someone else has to help you out. just as it happend there. 
---
you also knew there's a downed person and you still walked up to them. how can you be surprised they revealed you?
---
Love the attempted BM, then the salt when it backfires on him
---
Hell yeah, fuck em.
