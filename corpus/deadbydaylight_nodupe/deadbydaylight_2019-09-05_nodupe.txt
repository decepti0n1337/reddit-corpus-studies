üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ lol im glad they make noise when they take it apart tho cuz theres no taking apart in the show. You can only burn it away.
---
---
---
He's so cute too and terrifying when chasing you!
---
Brutal, merciless, and ruthless (i believe) are the three "wins" you can get with killer.  And if *I* escape *I* win, the other survivors aren't giving me anything for escaping.
---

---
That's just my opinion so if you disagree, then your wrong.  ^/s
---
Sundoll4mj plays dbd?
---
ikr, cozy lowkey said after he posted them in his discord: *icanfinallygetsomesleep*
---
'Learn' Clearly im not the only one who needs to learn English. Calling me a dumb fuck for no reason is great way to show how salty you are. Keep complaining bud.
---
I think both are pretty balanced as well, I hope they don't nerf the killer or any of the perks from both sides. It's dumb though that they needed surge's range abit from the original 32 meters to 24.
---
[removed]
---
His ability can be used to body block a pallet by vaulting and if they run i will either double back or catch up to them and body block so they cant vault
---
Or being a blendete
---
The hair is awful, im just using the regular one with the pants
---
The screenshot for the live build was taken earlier today.
---
Omg steve wtf
---
üò≠üò≠
---
Demigordon is not a good killer. Only have 3 games in but so far I‚Äôm very underwhelmed. Hitbox for lunge is garbage, the tunneling cooldown is far too long on base kit, locator ability only on activated portals is worthless.
---
Oh nvm then ig
---
I see what you mean about surge, but if you get 2 out of 3 generators close together when there‚Äôs only one left then it can be a pretty powerful perk to slow the game down.
---
And have her model accurately playing the menu song
---
I'm surprised it's not banned in Australia because of the drugs. Like a hint of drugs and it's ban time.
---
I mean he‚Äôs right dude does look like a goblin
---
Sluuuuuuuuuuurp
---
It's intended, especially the slow and medium vaults, they meant to be unsafe. To be honest I'm getting tired of people crying about hitboxes, I feel like most of the time they don't even understand how the game works and just look for the excuse for being bad.
---
HEY BHVR REALLY NEAT OF YOU TO NERF SURGE. I WAS EXCITED TO MAYBE HAVE ANOTHER DECENTLY STRONG PERK AS A KILLER, BUT I GUESS IT'S ANOTHER YEAR OF NOTHING BUT FUCKING BBQ, RUIN, ENDURING AND SPIRIT FURY FOR ME WOOOOOOOO
---
God, I really hope we don't end up seeing him nerfed, that would ruin my week.
---
I'm already switching to ghostface just in case I get that map. Swear to God if i play the huntress and get that map, I'm getting triggered
---
Micheal: the mega chad speed walk
---
I say play Claudette till Self Care, then get it on Meg. That's what I did.
---
Ash‚Äôs smile is groovy
---
Funny. 
---
What do you think makes her stronger than other killers?
---
Little bit of both lol
---
...tht was not greatm i was hoping itd be like the hags seeing thats what the demogorgon does they dont really go for the head or anything unless they are putting that worm thing in they mouth they could of showed that maybe
---
Please BHVR!
---
IVE LOST ULTRARARE ADDONS BECAUSE THE KILLER LEAVES. RIGHT NOW I JUST LOST A PIP FOR THE SAME REASON.
---
Right sure
---
So many rank 20 rants those days. A couple of days ago there was a dude moaning because of the wraith lol.
---
Just because you can beat a killer just running around a piece of wood and holding M2 doesnt mean that hes op
---
Oh god. PS4 player here. She's fine, if your R6 than EXPECT GOOD KILLERS. IM RANK 1 DOOP POOP. I PLAY PIG. I EXPECT GOOD SURVIVORS AND DONT GET SALTY.
---
It‚Äôs not, sorry
---
Its hard to tell cause of the high gamma, I see it now though
---
Uh ya it did he would or Aimed left if I didn't move to that direction .
---
I was hoping that dedicated servers would mean I could finally vault or drop pallets without getting hit through them due to lag all the time but nope, it's somehow even worse on PTB.
---
But then still complain about it.
---
Playing off his most played perks: STBFL, PWYF, Ruin, Bamboozle. 
---
You can sub infectious fright in if you‚Äôre going for a slug/ eternal T3 build or whatever else you might prefer. I‚Äôm really interested in the new Dying Light rework though.
---
That‚Äôs what I said?
---
His name is Fredddy fuck Jason, lmao you dont need anymore proof then that.
---
This community is full of surprises.
---
Nah
---
That‚Äôs my point.
---
Right, but then you 1) have to run the perk and 2) have survivors do the killer equivalent of chasing 1 survivor all game.
---
Survivors are the ones who control which gens get done, if they 3 gen themselves that's...their fault lol 
---
24 meters is nothing, now you can get 1 gen max, yaaaay. Pop is way better, Surge just doesn't seem worth a perk slot to "slightly better than regular gen kick to 1 gen"
---
Yes it is. I checked. 7200 shards here i come
---
Yoooo was this recent?
---
Her nose piercing is so... prominent...
---
Well what do you expect I‚Äôm a sweaty survivor of course I‚Äôm gonna get salty when I do to a tryhard plauge
---
Bruh! Billys got some long ass arms!
---
I also haven't seen that trapper mask before.
---
I understand how the game works just fine and honestly, window and pallet interactions are due for some minor timing and QoL tweaks. Hopefully with dedicated servers in place they can now make them.
---
He just smoked a doobie
---
Other survivors stupidities, if the survivors knew that‚Äôd shed unlock the purge if they cleanse then she‚Äôs a shit killer but other then that not everyone knows that
---
It says Test build on the screen in the vid
---
üôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩ
---
this is kinda old, but has he followed through and done it now?
---
Nah it'd be pretty tough to get someone down near two gens that are being worked on with a 24 meter rather considering most smart survivors would typically work on gens further from one another which is why 32 meters would've be pretty good. The Demigorgon's perks are kinda meh if I'm being honest but at least it's a fun killer and has potential to be a great killer given the right build (still testing him out a bit) his lunge attack is a damn game changer though and being able to cancel it for mind games makes it even spicier!
---
Yes it's from today, but he's been getting tweets since NOES launched as a dlc about it lol
---
Oh yea cus throwing a pallet is gonna save you against projectile vomit lmao and I‚Äôm not a rank 20 u fool
---
Well that wasnt really my question. But thanks for the input. Its more of is it based off kills or objective points was the question. Like if you escaoe thru hatch and dpip but your teammate dies and they doubled pip are you really the one who wins? If you guys end up at the campfire again anyways.
---
I just found the offering Vigo‚Äôs Shroud. If only I had an infinite supply..
---
they won't smile that much when u see Bubba Lubba approaching
---
Lmao
---
Yes let's not pull another Freddy, also Happy Cakeday!
---
Its the test server to make sure all the changes work and to find bugs.
---
It's not even remotely good. The penalty needs to be higher.
---
The Overwatch thing would be op.
---
You can lool it and make distance on walls. Also, you get an indication when she grabs the power up. Also, she has no mobility
---
Act like you don‚Äôt care
---
AHHHHHAHHHHHHHHAAHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Well for me, for the past 4 years I've been seeing jojo references at least once every other day. That's a lot of seeing references of something I don't understand. 
---
I really don't care if you like the show or not. Just please stop referencing it
---
what happened?
---
I had to repost for rage Wednesday because it got deleted
---
I would also be happy with a Devotion-based bank for BP. (:
---
y tho
---
A little less than two weeks from now if everything goes well.
---
Just Play immeresed or if you are being chased, run Obscurly shaped loops
---
Then steve be like: üòù AHaahAHHHHHH Uhhhhg mmmmMMMmmmmHmmmm
---
at the same time PC gets them
---
Ok that makes sense but ur not gonna be round walks for long then a few seconds are you?
---
had to be a Dwight
---
In terms of sound and visual desgin, the demogoron is amzaing. Unuie anmations for everything and sounds. As for gameplay wise, hes gonna be at least on the same level as freddy
---
Solid. I could use anything you got
---
THAT'S A TOTAL LIE LMAO. They're running on UE4 and it's very well capable of such things, it's on the devs not the engine. A. they don't want to put the effort in and B. they'd have to make a special build that's slightly different for Japan.
---
Also it's "their" and not "there" and it's not even THEIR engine, it's licensed from Epic, it's as I said UE4 and nothing inhouse made.
---
What do you need help with the most?
---
Yuuuuup, rank 16 killer and I'm constantly getting rank 8 and below
---
Oh boy y'all gotta read the patch notes. P3 pig here.
---
Not sure what the pig problem is, but in this clip you clearly weren't actually hitting him? So I don't see an issue
---
It's not as bad as a hag trap; it needs to actively use it's power and then discern the extra heartbeat, then be near a portal (I'll assume a camper is on/close to the portal), and then crawl through the portal. That's plenty of time for a hook save. 
---
Wraith and bubba will still be the best campers.
---
Plus if you see him in a chase he won't be able to port over to the hook like the hag.
---
Not to mention it wastes a portal if survivors aren't sealing them.
---
What if we stuck our hand in the portal, no that would be weird hahaha... *unless...*
---
Hello. Pig main. She's still op trust me.
---
Try being more patient with the dash, it's really good once you got it down.
---
They said it wasn't intended is why the removed it, but I am of the most certainty they made it so nurse's calling worked with snapping out of it, and them announcing on stream it was supposed to be that way. I'm fine with the devs but they either completely forgot something or lied.
---
Man this community really is toxic.
---
F
---
The creature can cross over into the upside down which is a shadowy rotten copy of ours and it comes through portals which can be in objects. For the game the chose for the killer to make the portals and they can teleport to them. It's sort of like new Freddy except they can be destroyed and are still usuable after the gens are completed if not destroyed.
---
Tf is that
---
[deleted]
---
I feel like whenever there is ruin I keep hitting greats, but without I'm always hitting good, probably cause ruin forces you to focus more
---
I SAID CALM THE FUCK DOWN DUDE!
---
I still can't believe it's not butter
---
Are they voiced by the actors? or just improvised grunts and sounds?
---
luckyyyy
---
damn who shit in your cereal this morning
---
As killer ye, as survivor no bc im too low
---
No ones even saying hes OP only OP post ive seen on here are killer mains complaining about the locker perk. Ive seen nothing but the demogorgon is cool and so on. Granted social media is vast.

The 24th
---
Right at the start what‚Äôs your strategy?  Do you scout around, go straight to a generator, look for teammates/killer, sit in a locker and cry?
---
Have you not read the comments in this thread? You understand you made a "meme" about something right?
---
Misleading title, was expecting a joke
---
Ty for the german lessons kind stranger :)
---
Yeah i get that. But what are they doing to destroy it. Just looks like they‚Äôre screaming into it
---
WAIT A MINUTE! YOU MAY BE ON TO SOMETHING! You go ahead first!
---
don't need a code
---
 No, never seen this before in my life. Wonder if these types of posts get removed because it's against the rules. Or maybe you're the first one ever.
---
Oh my bad
---
I mean you ain‚Äôt wrong
---
I dont take Ls because I dont play hag
---
Ah!
---
R/whatsameme
---
Its a killers dance routine. Thats Frank with his mask off üôÑüôÑüôÑcmon guys get with the program
---
It's very bad still. You can't kill the obsession and it does less for the other 3 unless you hook them all 3 times each in which case they are dead. It's healthier for the game because it isn't just for tunneling but it's a lot weaker.
---
It's all about personal wins for me. If I'm solo queing of course I want to get out but I usually try to have a goal, like make sure the hex totems are gone or make sure to get the pesky middle gen or make sure the tunneled obsession gets some protection. If I'm with a swf if any of us make it out it's a win for the whole team. I do think if ranking up is important to you def do gens objectives, if not, you might as well have a skin with a literal Target on you.
---
I guess it depends on your playstyle and what you hope to get out of the game if getting out isn't a possibility. Of course a pip is always good even if you die which is why I prefer this game over say overwatch which has an overly punishing ranking system
---
Guess who can body block too 
---
Hag 
---
If you herd them the right way she can almost completely ignore them or block them and get a hit in and can completely nullify many infinate loops too
---
Are you okay
---
Nancy ended up with the better perks
---
IT'S SO MUCH WORSE WHEN YOU FINALLY DOWN ONE OF THEM AND THE WHOLE GODDAMN SWF TROOP IS CROUCHED NEXT TO THE HOOK
---
Cool.
---
*sqishlmlmlmsloshmmslckkkk*
---
I want little holes in the face like a certain death in season 2
---
Sorry but what does ptb mean?
---
One of them is the terror radius going away for survivors. That's for 2 killers, only part of the time for both, with one of them being replaced for a lullaby instead. The other is only durring the demogorgon using a portal, as far as I am aware. Doesn't seem bad at all imo.
---
which one though?
---
Public test build for new content that gets tested for only pc
---
It hurts
---
Well that seemed passive aggressive
---
I thought the hag was brutal then I saw this
---
That‚Äôs the point
---
Not at all.
---
You create a long with your friends, then join the game/matchmaking.
---
Dedicated servers have nothing to do with keeping track of who's in the lobby, and rejoining it after a game. 
---
At worst it's a pure automation thing, using the existing structure to just reinvite and accept without player input. At worst it's creating a better system to keep that group linked within a party.
---
Plenty of games do this. It's them just not wanting to and not seeing it as an actual issue for them.
---
I mean where are you even getting this idea?
---
I appreciate the username
---
Lol I had about 200 hours on killer before playing survivor and expected to be a god among rank 20's when I played my first survivor game. I sucked like everybody else. 
---
Just hang in there, watch a guide or two to looping and you'll get better.
---
How do you play the PTB on ps4
---
Public test build. Just where they test the new stuff without breaking the main game more.
---
Same, got a million ready for Nancy. Can't wait to see how Inner Strength helps my build/ playstyle.
---
The demagorgan xddd
---
I think it might have started being this way to sell cosmetics more? Obvious theory and obviously not an excuse but I can deal with it more if I think of it as an actively chosen decision instead of just incompetency or bad art direction.
---
True but it at least synergizes better with his other perks than how it is in the current state which is a straight up contradiction.
---
You do both, save till a million then only spend like 200k and repeat
---
What?
---
Wow it's so cool that he actually did this
---
I hope BHVR listens to him at least
---
You said it's the same as 27 seconds
---
Which goes to show that the two aren't linked at all?
---
You can clearly join a lobby with your friends, THEN all no n a new lobby made by the killers. Keeping track of the first lobby is the only issue. It has nothing to do with dedicated servers and everything to do with keeping track of some information and automating the rejoin process.
---
It's good that they're finally doing it, but I think it's a huge reason a few if my friends get tired if playing after a while and take huge breaks. Someone always has to "host" and keep reinviting. They should make this a priority and make sure it gets into the game.
---
Ah
---
Nah fam
---
"The camping meta" what lol
---
This isn‚Äôt related to the post but check my reddit account age
---
Thanks  :)
---
It's wild that it wasn't in the game at launch lol
---
All the people who are genuinely pure die in thus stupid addictive series üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
This makes me think of a combo: Surveillance + The invisibility of the portals. 
---
Kick the gen and place a portal. When Surveillance tells you when a survivor comes back, you can just dig back and surprise them. Especially with the undetectable from exiting. Place it behind a wall of the gen for max spooks and potential grabs.
---
Thank you!
---
So the demagorgan is just the huntress throwing herself gg
---
Omg! SFM render looks outdated as hell.
---
I agree with you but it could be because of the animators maybe they're lazy maybe that level of Gore is more difficult for them to animate or more expensive
---
Man, that would ruin my day. Dont worry, its probably haunted ground anyway.
---
Mind breaker seems OK, it's a hard counter to sprint burst
---
Yeah but I don‚Äôt have many opportunities to get play, so I want to farm bloodpoints so I can get Nancy‚Äôs perks ASAP.
---
Oh no, he's hot!
---
The Doctor just wanted him to do the roar
---
Then again, Freddy himself can be a bit gorey so idk
---
It's huntress throwing herself with no windup time.
---
If you know/remember what old Tinkerer used to do, that's basically how fast the windup is.
---
What do you mean
---
I refuse
---
[Basically content creators get free shit for showing off the game](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49385/fog-whisperers-program-launch)
---
"Brutal" He literally sucked his head like some kind of jolly rancher
---
It's only available on pc unfortunately.
---
But seriously, you can't. You can only access the PTB through Steam. Works that way for most games
---
Nice
---
he reminds me of the "Your toes, hand them over" guy
---
I got 1 mil for steve and then spent 400k on legion, oops
---
Survivor perks are balanced so is the demogorgon(mid tier atleast) besides the lunge although its kinda soon to say it needs a nerf it gives  big distance and it charges fast I'll wait a little more though before saying it needs a nerf. The animations are good and the demogorgons Mori is pretty great
---
I really like this but i wish her boxbraids were kept.
---
Or just add it for free as DLC, like Down Under did with L4D2 and its uncensored patch.
---
Just to be like "ah, man, I fucked it up." If I was looking for advice, I'd have flaired the post "looking for advice" or I would've asked.
---
Demogorgon? More like Dememegorgon!
---
Remember when DbD wasn't on console and us PC players didnt have to suffer from lack of updates due to console restrictions?  Good times they were..............
---
tbf the demogorgon looks like it was born on leg day
---
You better watch out for his traps
---
Monto used the same thing, it was a hidden feature where hitting someone in the head was an insta down.  This time must be a bug.
---
So the reason shes op is because survivors are bad? That makes no sense.
---
You want to nerf her to a state where shes even worse against good players? Just so that the bad ones aren't punished?
---
Yeah with bad teleports. Anyone can body block but legion can do it better.
---
The original point was that it won't help with levelling a million bps.  Although on second glance, I realize now that OP didn't specify 1 mil bps from lvl 1
---
Shh he's asserting his dominance against the killer as any wild Steve would do
---
Sorry but Steve's sound files give me flashback to his homoerotic moments with Billy in Stranger Things.
---
Wack. I wanna do that
---
Its Reddit lol most of these people literally only know how to play killer take that away from them and they have nothing

THE OTHER RESPONSE IS GREAT, BUT THE TIMING IS ALSO A FACTOR TO LEARN. YOU HAVE THE CAST TIME, BUT THERE'S ALSO A DELAY WHILE ITS GOING OUT (I THINK ITS BASICALLY A TRAVEL TIME). AFTER THAT, THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE A SHORT WINDOW WHERE THE SURVIVOR IS BEING SHOCKED THAT THEY CAN STILL DO SHIT.

SO IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW THE SHOCK IS NOT STOPPING SOMETHING, ITS PROBABLY BECAUSE THE SHOCK WINDOW IS FUCKING TINY

Fucking deadd loool

leave my boi alone

lol the same thing happened to me and my friends in swf, we all started tampering with the portal and demogorgon pulled up then started nodding and spazzing out.

Gottem

Public test build

they cant really. they only got licensing to the GhostFace costume from FunWorld they didnt get a license from Scream

How did i miss that post? Lol
---
Yeah.‚Äôplus it‚Äôs taking much longer then normal to even get into one. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the new servers or it‚Äôs just no one is playing the PTB but it‚Äôs noticeably worse then normal. 
---
I‚Äôm currently back east NA.
---
Public test build or something like that it‚Äôs basically just a beta
---
Only on pc tho ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
&gt; maybe a retired Priest from South Korea in his 30's 
---
Thats... oddly specific.
---
You don‚Äôt see much, just the exterior of the facility. When I saw the exit gates I got excited because I thought it was an elevator but it‚Äôs not :(
---
In the morning ill be checking its look in game
---
Myers is only a problem if you feed him. Tombstones make it that much more likely he won't even proc EW3 before the gates are powered.
---
In my eyes I think i won, rank means near nothing espicially with matchmaking in times like these.  If i survive with survivor then i think i won, although i didn't do objetictives and was a waste of a survivor slot i still achieved the primary goal.  Killers on the other hand, each "tier" of killer requires a certain amount of objective play so that's a different story
---
When‚Äôs this releasing on console
---
No chance. You know how broken that would be in swf? You‚Äôd just tell them where the killer is at all times.
---
I feel that some of these add ons are just average right now.  Nothing really looks interesting.
---
Sorry to repost this, but people seemed to get the wrong idea last time and thought I posted this because I didn't know how to flashlight save despite me clearly not asking them for advice.

I really shouldn't have to explain this, but some people are like that.
---
what am i looking at? the quick sabo? he might have 99'd it
---
This show that we will have different heads/mouths/flowers.
---
I'm kinda curious on what they gonna do with the cosmetics
---
Meh, he‚Äôs a solid A-B tier
---
Dude, I was saying I should‚Äôve added an /s. Not you. Chill out
---
Also Brutal Strength
---
now we can just swoon over demogorgon instead of damn myers
---
Oh ok. Well you say thats the objective. But the gane literally gives you four objectives. And only one of them is killing on the killers side and only one of them is surviving on the survivors side. So as long as that one objective out of the 4 is complete you think thats a win. Ok i get your point.
---
Demogorgon has second best nod. Nurse is still best.
---
üíÄ
---
Oh ok, sorry. I'm a bit on edge right now.
---
Would you do that for me?
---
just tell them to watch a stream on twitch or videos on youtube. there are plenty of people playing the PTB right now that are being pretty informative
---
So now gorgon boy cant wear black clothes?
---
Just because hes a demon from another dimension doesnt mean he cant be fashion while eating heads
---
Yeah pretty much, killing stops the other objectives, gens, chases, etc.  If you don't kill then the other objectives get failed, making it the map objective and the primary source of victory
---
Daddy chill
---
IT IS SUPER INFURIATING THAT I (RANK 16 NEW KILLER), MANAGE TO PULL OFF A 3K AND A GIVE A HATCH ESCAPE, AND GET MESSAGED BY A RANK 7 SURVIVOR (WHOM I HOOKED 3X) WITH SO MUCH SALT THAT I KEPT MISSING MY HITS ON THEM, GET GUD, ETC., AND THE ONLY REASON I MISSED HITS WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD A DIALUP CONNECTION SPEED AND WERE PINGING OVER 300 SO KATE KEPT TELEPORTING LIKE A OMEGA BLINK FREAKIN NURSE

Yea that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt you find it annoying when teammates are stupid enough to cleanse and it literally ends the game for you (in some situations) because they don‚Äôt know how to counter ? Yh I‚Äôm a good survivor and Ik how to keep her away to just being an m1 but not everyone does so that‚Äôs why her purge should be 3 hit instead just 2 hit
---
Thanks was in the air ... did not know that.
---
You can counter Doc by playing Calm Spirit
---
Ik i just want free shit lmao
---
N O
---
Well thats another way you can play him
---
How much of a difference does shadowborn really make for the demogorgon? I'm curious
---
Ok
---
Wow 5 seconds lol obviously I know Self Care is 32 sec
---
Nice idea but the percentages are too low. Where you really only needed 2 or 3 hooks (less if you brought a mori) you get an instant 25% reduction. NOW, you gotta get 9 hooks just to get a 22.5% reduction, and hooking the obsession doesn't count. 
---
Also you have a 33% faster altruistic survivor running around, and if they die then this perk goes away. It's a shame.
---
Or the nurse‚Äôs blink
---
I guess we‚Äôll see pretty soon! I‚Äôm a console peasant so I‚Äôll have to wait until full release.
---
Move the window closer to that corner gen.
---
Actually, yes.
---
It is, but I like to imagine it more brutally.
---
wait till they see the hags
---
They‚Äôre the same picture
---
Ay another consoler peasant. It'll probably just make it so you can more of them hands(also googly eyes demogorgon when?)
---
Gosh claudette is under heroine on the second one...
---
In short, heaven for survivors, hell for killers
---
**Megs
---
Nah, gens can still be kicked faster. You would have to not do gens either.
---
REMOVE THE HOOK DISTORTION FFS ... IT GETS IN THE WAY OF SEEING THE KILLER OR KNOWING IF THEY SAW ME.
---
I was thinking Felissa Rose lmao at the end of sleepaway camp
---
Is he scary?
---
Criteria for jokes:
---
1. Has to be funny.
---
2. Has to be comprehensible.
---
You're 0 for 2.
---
Oh thats was because that was never meant to be the perk name. Simple formula was just a placeholder name since it was a direct refrefence to a movie scene, so they couldnt actuay put it in since this ist the ghostface from scream
---
Fancy that . Your "choice"
---
Low usually looks a lot better; they definitely fucked it up. Otherwise, I wouldn't have found this thread (for the people saying it's always been like this).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I play on low since the AA effects are too strong on anything higher (makes the game super blurry) + the added bonus that you can see the red stain through walls lol.
---
Bad teleports? Really 
---
And even then in order to body block you need them stick around and not just go to another pallet
---
And it also requires you to not brake them 
---
Anyone can body block yes 
---
But the question it how fast can they body block
---
No. You can complete all three objectives without killing. You dont need to kill to pass the objectives. Actually the other objectives have absolutely nothing to do with kills at all. So "if you dont kill the other objectives get failed" is a false statement. Do you not know how the objectives work in the game?
---
Bruh that totem spot tho
---
#my choice is made then#
---
You can only buy licensed people with iridescent shards.
---
Can I help you? I‚Äôm kinda bad at survivor so maybe we can help each other?
---
I agree but I'd prefer googly eyes demogorgon first
---
Did she break free literally as you went to grab her, causing you to pick up the trap instead? 
---
Unlucky my dude.
---
[Google Earth, always taking pics](https://i.imgur.com/GHdFiqV.png)

Mate you're a bit thick aren't ya
---
It‚Äôs ‚ÄúCooool Guy‚Äù!
---
I wit till a gen is completed or someone gets injured to insure i dont get found first
---
Does anyone know when the DLC releases?
---
The only way to escape when this happens is through the hatch (I've heard anyway).
---
Is it just me that thinks she kinda looks like Ashe from Overwatch in this picture? Not bad at all, they just look similar to me.
---
I tried playing her and she feels useless I became a hag Main because she's so useless
---
shadowborn is weird on demogorgon because when you go through a portal in the upside down you can see outside of it and see the actual map
---
Only when they are a random person on the internet that jokingly flirts or some shit
---
Quentin‚Äôs is so goddamn unnerving, I despise it
---
It will definitely be released in September. Probably (not 100%) 2 weeks from yesterday or today
---
The fault of other survivors doesn‚Äôt make her OP, it makes her as bad as she always is and the survivors people who just need to learn more about the game. If they made the Plague any worse, no one would want to buy her or play as her.
---

Whatever youre on i want some
---
Nah yall just trash
---
Y-yes, you think i don't know, it's shit, i just couldn't stop myself
---
Oh, thanks for sharing that. Interesting
---
How do you play on that??
---
Yea it was like half a second. I was ready to pick her up. I didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd break free but I still got her.
---
Auric Cells*
---
Jokes on you I‚Äôm always horny. She just happens to be in my line of sight at this moment
---
yeah but other than that issue shadowborn is cool
---
Yeah it was so weird I was like noooo give me my blood points
---
Yeah, neat. I‚Äôll make sure to check it out when the dlc fully releases.
---
I figured you were talking about the biker top. Because the post was about the biker top. What we are on is called confusion.
---
*laughs in shitty pc*
---
Most likely two weeks from yesterday
---
Omg same! I‚Äôll be starting a new job with 3 consecutive 12 hour shifts and I work that Tuesday. I‚Äôm so sad :( I do have a feeling it might be released if PTB does go smoothly.
---
I would pay to have this for sure.
---
Hell get Will in here, he'd probably love to be in a game
---
Looks like five floors from the window. Still a relatively ‚Äútall‚Äù 2 floor map since the stairwell has two sets of stairs.
---
Tell your friend to stop being weird and download reddit already and post himself.
---
Something for BHVR to fix.  If not, better hope it's never a Hex: Devour Hope.
---
Lmao i bought the outfit already üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs all good I‚Äôm buying it when I get home lmao
---
Then he tries again and again until he wins
---
Still not announced I don't think. Expect a week or two from now depending on whether or not they take a week to fix any issues.
---
damn so thats just a costume? we needed a monster killer
---
Her perks are amazing it's just her ability that makes her feel useless I can still get 4 ks with her but I don't find a point to put reverse bear traps on people
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

---
This is some serious Gourmet shit but it makes you a target bc killers hate new outfits apparently. Every game ive played today ive been the only one tunneled
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
A Freddy on PTB??
---
Perk pretty meta now if you ask me
---
for who?
---
Yup, and unfortunately it was a Devour Hope. I have faith that the Devs will improve this totem spawn.
---
At the end of the game theres four objectives emblems i THINK they are called I needed to google the names but i didnt realize how hard itd be but its chaser and like one is the killing one n so on. Like to max on chase obviously u dont kill. To get one of those winning titles like ruthless killer you have to max out atleast two of those objectives. You cant just kill and get a winning title.
---
I‚Äôll continue playing him but that still doesn‚Äôt make up for a lack of continuous map pressure
---
Well how often do you use his lunge because his lunge is deadly with the range it has. For portals place 2 at each side of the map for transportation and others for placing near areas with alot of generators, hook etc
---
it's called lag compensation. so just because you were far enough away on your screen doesn't mean the killer and their lunge were not on theirs. it's a part of the game you can't get rid of it with dedicated servers.
---
 if you fast fault a window there's still a delay animation between the leap and the action of going out the window, and due to the distance you gain from a vault it seems like you got hit when you shouldn't have, the same goes for a pallet. I think overall you will still see a bit better of hit reg, though, due to consistent ping, unless your ISP sucks.
---
he needs to prove hes aint take no shit
---
hes going to
---
make Quinton his bitch
---
stab a killer with a shard of glass 
---
unhook himself like a boss ass bitch
---
did I say... nevermind
---
except its radius is no way as small as huntress's
---
Literally a locker Dwight‚Äôs wet dream
---
20% of the entire game are killer mains
---
That‚Äôs an awfully tiny human
---
‚ÄúAll legitimate complaints is just bitching‚Äù
---
Fam I was agreeing with you about it being a broken strategy but that line is just the cowards way of saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right and everyone that disagrees with me is wrong because I don‚Äôt like hearing opinions that aren‚Äôt mine‚Äù
---
That being said, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd change it so you can‚Äôt place portals specifically in the basement but it is sort of unfair. Your best bet is that he can‚Äôt place another portal to teleport to the basement or he isn‚Äôt close enough to another one he already placed.
---
Pretty sure thats just its throat
---
Hag is just as bad, if she places portals along the stairs, you're forced to crouch all the way up.
---
He's going to be a more basement punishing character, so what? Just avoid the basement mid chases and make it more difficult for him to put you down there.
---
Is this an old clip?  I thought with the end game collapse changes the killer couldn't grab survivors out of the hatch anymore.
---
Wait what‚Äôs the premise behind MTV ghost face?
---
Did the past ptb end 2 weeks after they were released?
---
Ash is getting a new outfit
---
That was a dumb statement lol you‚Äôre saying that because there are 4 survivors and 1 killer in every game, it doesn‚Äôt work like that. And I said this sub specifically
---
Yeah, I expect her to be on r/dbdgonewild in, I dunno, few minutes maybe?
---
Pumpkinhead
---
Eh survivors have been tweaked a little bit not much. Bloodweb changes are happening allowing you to get 2 perks out of 4 and left behind shows hatch location and dying light is completely different so yeah
---
and omega hell for huntress
---
Js man.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I'm 100% certain the Demogorgons are gonna be saying the same thing to the Steve Liberation Army
---
So thats why im confused by your statement. Like you say those are the winning titles but if you mori all 4 ppl and do nothing else you will not recieve that title at all you will recieve entity displeased. But you said that mori 4 survivors is a win even tho it doesnt get a winning title that you mentioned hence my confusion on your stance.
---
Doubtful he has the ability to grant his likeness in regards to nightmare on elm street characters.
---
I GO OUT OF MY WAY AS A SURVIVOR TO PLAY RESPECTFULLY AND NOT DO ANYTHING THAT COULD EVEN BE MISTAKEN FOR TOXIC BEHAVIOR, SO WHY DID A WRAITH JUST STAND THERE AND RING HIS BELL IN MY FACE REPEATEDLY WHILE I SLOWLY DIED ON HOOK?!? 
---
I DO NOT HOLD TUNNELING AGAINST KILLERS IN GENERAL BECAUSE I SUCK AT ESCAPING, BUT THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR SHIT LIKE THIS.
---
[You'd be correct,](https://imgur.com/a/J17Tnja) but it looks surprisingly human for a throat (I can make out a nose and some eyes), at least to me it does.
---
why are you getting downvoted for an obvious joke lmao
---
Js you legit pulled that out your ass tho. It doesn‚Äôt work like that
---
Lol i can see where you're coming from
---
Gens, chases, killing, and the last one is for injuring and stalling i believe, but they'red tied together.  If you kill everyone then they can't do gens or open gates, quick chases lead to quick kills, and you have to hit people to kill people which ends the game and so further.  Now do you get it, icould see why you would be confused.
---
Doesn't Hawkins also have a uncleanse-able totem spawn too? Great map
---
There was a survey a while ago.
---
Give it some time for people to create strats with him
---
No it‚Äôs me saying people will just write off as post DLC bitching that‚Äôs common. I‚Äôm not saying ‚ÄúDemogorgon OP‚Äù I‚Äôm saying Demogorgon basement hooks = game over for that guy which is bullshit
---
Basement is meant to be difficult and dangerous to get out of. Survivors are suppose to fear going in the basement.
---
When do we get this on consoles?
---
Inb4 someone points out BHVR intended to add SWF all along
---
The map is massive tho dude. Good luck walking from one side to the other without gens flying
---
How long does the ptb stay before the update comes out most of the time? A month?
---
Wow. A Killer with generally decent add-ons at all levels.
---
Yeah and it gave way to tunnel as you please. 
---
It's better the way it is now.
---
My answer was "No, I didn't play the PTB during that time frame" because I was busy the **one** day you ran it.
---
Maybe consider running the dedicated servers PTB for more than just the one day?
---
I hate you for this and I do not know why
---
Because that's what dweets do
---
It looks fucking gorgeous tho
---
Hey! There's the high roller!
---
She low-key looks like that prostitute that Jesse was dating at the very beginning of the show
---
I hate this
---
In general the game should at least have an option for these more violent scenes. It's kinda weird they went the super safe route for a game that's based on some of the most violent and gory movies in existence. I don't know this for sure cause I'm too lazy to look but I can say pretty confidently that Saw,  scream,  Texas chainsaw massacre,  nightmare on elm st, and Halloween are all R flicks
---
Not really he just bites your face and you don‚Äôt even see it. It‚Äôs one of the lamest ones in my opinion. You want a good mori look a legion or hag
---
There is not a single person in this sub that doesn't know about matchmaking issues.
---
Spirit.  Personal preference, but I think she is fun as hell.  Ghostface can be a lot of fun too.
---
It was never announced
---
It's Reddit man it happens
---
No i get what your saying. But if you kill everyone too fast and dont get chaser the stalling one hooking you will literally get entity displeased. But you said the winning titles are ruthless and so on. So by my understanding even if you get entity displeased which you think is a losing title as long as you get the 4 moris its a killer win. ?
---
The ranch chapter
---
0,o genius absolute genius
---
That's not face camping as everyone else is gone but still a great escape.
---
Can someone send me all of the new looks? I‚Äôm on ps4 so no ptb for me
---
Thank goodness it's a test build huh?
---
Literally went from F tier to high B/low A tier. Seriously good.
---
sluuuuuuuuurp
---
If you're so sweaty why are you not rank 1?
---
Ah, so you have to actually trigger the attack and it's not like a chainsaw. That's cool. I'm probably going to mess this up since I'm so used to cancelling a charged ranged attack with the attack button.
---
And I love yours!
---
You used the wrong flair buddy. Shoulda put shitpost
---
Okay. 
---
Don't go down near the basement.
---
In case you do run tenacity, flip flop, boil over, etc etc. to try and deter him from taking you there.
---
If someone else goes down there, either don't go save or bring BT and wait for the heartbeat before save to counter MYC.
---
There ya go.
---
I hope. I am not as good as a rank 4 or 8 at all. Very frustrating.
---
OwO
---
Nathan Fillion.
---
I never noticed bill was in that position before, really cool detail!
---
I did not. ): 
---
Just got back from vacation so never heard. What a bummer. Thanks, I guess.
---
You did great. Give me the hatch and I'll give you all my love.
---
Basically your typical deformed ugly guy gets bullied so he starts killing people, that's the original killer. Then there's the daughter of the original killer who starts killing, dude it's all fucked up and hard to summarize.
---
The other day in a swamp match against spirit I got downed below the docks and as soon as she picks me up my swf, who I didn't even know was there, drops down from up top and flashlight saves me. üòÇ
---
Oh don't worry. It'd be fixed within 24 hours because it harms Survivors, and BHVR can't have that now.
---
Pretty sure its against rules to post these now...
---
I knew a guy who had a bong we called The Mace. It was a 3 ft tall 3 inch thick beaker. It took an act of god to break that thing.
---
You‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre right. Tied with Steve.
---
Doesn‚Äôt make it any less frustrating. Thank you for you input.
---
The point was to mock a bad joke with a bad joke. You had to go and make it rhyme :(
---
Shake my head my head
---
Why would you get banned for using perks in the game? Stop being so fucking stupid
---
Toxic survivor obviously
---
This post was made by a killer main
---
The demogorgon opens his mouth for a split second when charging the lunge and the demogorgon is kinda tall so that's kinda a warning if you see him pop out of the ground or haven't heard a terror radius
---
Sadly I'm on console. So there problemo numero uno!
---
At least I have that

You can counter Unrelenting by letting the Killer hit you.
---
Now that I think about it, baiting him to teleport by faking the unhook then doing it inside of heartbeat is really smart. I always run BT so that‚Äôs not problem and baiting counters MYC. 
---
But the other perks you mentioned are shit, won‚Äôt matter if the killer isn‚Äôt going to slug and if it‚Äôs a basement hook he probably won‚Äôt. 
---
Devour Hope will also be very strong on Demogorgon
---
If it was based on terror radius I would buy the Demogorgon just to use that bad boy on my Doctor.
---
no i work for the entity, they told me
---
Finally a good totem spawn.
---
Looks like Ashe from Overwatch
---
I can't look at that mori for some reason, the whole wrapping around the survivors' head thing really bugs me
---
That's right boi
---
Ash just looks uncomfortable. Does he need a moment?
---
OH MY GOD FUCKING FINALLY DUDE
---
July 47nd 2,000 20st.
---
I can hear the screams of OP already
---
4 survivors vs. 4 Demogorgons and a Myers
---
Not true. The Killers are hookers.
---
Dont blame them, its the most boring thing to just wait until you die. Bonus points if they run omegablink, I feel no shame d/cing if someone else already did
---
Peep the Scuba Steve reference
---
It looks like the Joker has finally been added to the game...
---
/r/UnexpectedTF2

Counter bbq by Disconnecting before he puts you on the hook

Lmao thats great!
---
That‚Äôs great, thanks! Now I can look forward to BT tier 3 on Ash (hopefully) soon!
---
Crystal meth.  Not even once.
---
How is this nsfw
---
in this case the nobody makes sense. Point is that the survivors are just screaming about nothing off in the distance
---
at gonna lie, but the 3rd one looking like a meat ball
---
Watch montos new video thatll show you how to use the power
---
FUCKING FREDDY. THAT SMUG ASSHOLE NEEDS SINGING LESSONS FROM HUNTRESS.
---
*cough cough*
---
Maybe he couldn‚Äôt help you, because that ‚ÄúR.I.P. bye‚Äù didn‚Äôt seem like he was mocking you
---
I bet DemiPlayz would like it, after all, it would make Quinton look like more ugly (:
---
BHVR should only allow access to new characters and their perks in the PTB. At least for the first few days. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre testing. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter so much for survivors as they are just skins, but the killers should be really pushing them hard to see what works and what doesn‚Äôt.
---
&gt; Yea that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt you find it annoying when teammates 
---
I find a lot of things my team mates do annoying. Urban evading in corners refusing to touch gens, running killer into me with bond, hook farming me, suiciding on first hook etc
---
None of them have anything to do with how strong the killers is. If you play dumb, you deserve to be punished.
---
Ye it sucks when someone is perma cleansing before they are even injured, I had a game like that today. These people do not deserve to win though so I don't think we should nerf plague so bad players feel better about themselves.
---
Unfortunately when you queued surviver, you joined a team. You have to get used to the fact they won't always be good.
---
Maybe they all left cause he was face camping and couldn't save him.
---
I wish we saw the full clip to be honest.
---
You can get one from me, I loved it.
---
Yea it was an old one, I thought I‚Äôd share tho bc I still think it was a good clip.
---
Whoosh
---
Ash is voiced by Bruce Campbell, but none of the other licensed survivors are, if that‚Äôs what you were asking.
---
I agree that the Demagorgon (or however it‚Äôs spelled) has a really crap pallet breaking/gen damaging animation, it looks like the creature is swinging really half heartedly and doesn‚Äôt look like it would inflict any actual damage.  Yeah, I know that tiny little 120lb (54kg in commie units) Amanda Young couldn‚Äôt actually shatter a shipping pallet in 2 kicks, but at least it looks like she‚Äôs putting her back into it and the animation sells you on the force of the kicks, whereas after the Demagorgon limply waggles its wrists at a pallet barely even actually touching it I half expect the pallet to still be standing there unscratched.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about the map or killer‚Äôs abilities yet, but I will agree that the new killer‚Äôs kicking animation is wack.
---
Is it me or does Jeff look like Hagrid?
---
No, IIRC, a dev said that the end game collapse for Hawkins would be unique and unlike the others
---
I read it as a bit of sympathy with the RIP
---
Honestly in my experience on PS4 you‚Äôll see a new killer every few matches but most people don‚Äôt buy dlc
---
he will make Quinton his bitch im telling you
---
Only 1 other person and if you think about it its likely that the other 2 left because he was being facecamped and couldnt be saved.
---
Blame sony and microsoft
---
They charge a lot of money for a ptb version of dbd to be available
---
Its not worth it for you
---
Hanzo?
---
It sounds like a counter to looping basement house. Really good loop if played correctly and if not have fun trying to get out ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
And that's why they nerfed it. They have to take into account how it will synergize with other perks/addons. Imagine map wide TR doc with TR Surge, it would be broken. But it did not need to be murdered like this. But hey, its BHVR. They're either 1 or 100, no in between. Either it's op or useless.
---
this shouldn't be an unpopular opinion and its sad that it is
---
People actually do this at times and it's fucked
---
NANCY DREW AND STEEEEEEEEEEEEVE HARVEY
---
Does anything happen if you prestige a killer?
---
Its like a claudette main but instead its tapp and yes in sure your being sarcastic
---
This happened to me once but it was with hag and I got hatch instead randomly
---
Decapitations make the game get rated higher which means it‚Äôs harder for underage people to buy it
---
No matter what, there‚Äôs always going to be that one asshole or two or more. Fortunately, I‚Äôve had some great matches against good players using the new killer.
---
Iron Maiden tho
---
how long does ptb usually last? i thought it was usually 2 weeks but i could be forgetting
---
I must be missing something. Someone pls help
---
I saved up to a million a few times already since the announcement and I spent all of them because I have no self control lol
---
What
---
big oof
---
If it's other survivors who are the problem then why are you complaining about The Plague? Last time I checked she didn't need to be nerfed.
---
Um.. No. You have to be litteely on top of a portal to get the notification, his Teleport is slow, he has to be on a portal to even use it. You have enough time to unhook and leave with how long his Teleport is.
---
Get over it
---
[Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgA1TlvNExw&amp;t=8s)
---
its to give the story behind them
---
I will have to get back to you on that. May be a few hours.
---
The doors are supposed to be like the big elevator in the lab. Think season 1 episode 1 when the scientist runs to the elevator as the demogorgon escapes and eats him in the elevator.
---
It would be too much of a buff to Exhaustion perks, as it is it's already buffing them way too much for what they are.
---
jeff over here being a freakin cutie
---
I'd say ds inner strength adrenaline dead hard
---
In my other video someone has claimed it's meant for skull drilling in the surgical field .
---
Well people want to see the demogorgon not the standard killers we've been seeing for a decent amount of time plus it's the PTB it ain't that big of a deal.
---
his nickname would be  the injected
---
literally became a kate main just to get this cosmetic when it came out! it's my fav
---
Survivors seem to hate it when you use your extremely good add ons but they use their insta heals and BNPS and it‚Äôs fine
---
Purchase them from the xbox store.
---
I see many survivors still play old survivors like claudette and meg, why am i supposed to only play the new killer with shit for perks while they get to play their p3 maxed out perks survivors?
---
&gt;prayer beads
---
That's the problem, survivors absolutely hate this addon and I understand why.
---
Just to clear things up the Meg went in the closet JUST so she could use decisive strike.
---
They had 2 flashlights that game !!! I almost brought franklins but decided to play nice instead. big mistake.
---
Fair does but a teenager with a knifes not exactly inspired though that's exactly what legion is
---
Xbox is the same in my experience, with the apparent exception of Myers and Leatherface.
---
anybody know a solution when public beta option doesn't show up for Dead By Daylight on steam?
---
its his weapon his special ability is toxins where he injects them and if they dont getthe aintidote then they throw up blood and stort foaming from the mough until the collapse dead
---
You get better things in your bloodweb and a cosmetic for one part of the killer, prestiging a killer will take away everything from it though (add-ons,perks, and offerings)
---
edit: why did auto correct put killer as liver
---
Context is important, the game is fictious but you don't want very real modern day tragedies associated with it. Netflix has a hit about Ted Bundy but you're not going to see anything similar regarding mass shootings in America for a long time from now
---
Yes there is a killer who is the result of brutal familial abuse, but if you Google "familial abuse" dead by daylight is not going to come up.
---
The perks can have interactions with other killers in weird ways, bugs caused on new maps by other killers, survivor bugs, etc lol. Doing that wouldnt be a great idea.
---
Or by being the only one hooked
---
Can't be revealed by bbq if you're the one being killed!
---
It does look pretty dope. Unfortunately, his grunts of pain and asthma turn me off playing him altogether.
---
Love this. Working on one of the hag my self now.
---
Legend ! Hatch King to you my Good Sir!
---
Dunno. It got tagged as such so I just went with it. I kinda get it I guess but it doesn‚Äôt matter too much to me
---
And if you google prisoner abuse DBD won't either. It's a silly reason to change the name, and I doubt that's why they did it. If they did they are more out of touch with their own game/playerbase than I thought.
---
i didn't realize NOES was an acronym for Nightmare on Elm Street and was really confused for a lot longer than I'd like to admit
---
Well because survivors are just skins while each killer is completely different to each other like demogorgon having portals and a big lunge and Ghostface has stealth and instadowns
---
Just did thanks
---
And I felt so smug chasing him to the open gates...until he just ran through lol
---
Fortunately I got the other three
---
I don't know if it is just me but playing as killer I was getting some hits I shouldn't have on the PTB and a few times when I was pallet stunned I would end up going through the pallet and end up stunned on the other side of the pallet right next to the survivor.
---
its buggy as shit you aint missing much lol
---
If they're playing nancy (And you said you grabbed a nancy) it's obviously not p3 with all perks.
---
So in their eyes, You are tryharding on PTB and they just want to see new surv perks.
---
Cheeky
---
Yes, it's very doable, but it takes alot of time and effort before you get there
---
delicious, finally some good fucking food
---
Oh don't worry the developers will definitely tweak the lunge just fine if it has a issue I mean look at Ghostface he didn't get nerfed too badly after release or Freddy he just got tweaked a little
---
So your saying the killer hits you then you have to mend yourself in some way your right that's nothing like legion
---
That‚Äôs why I said the first few days ... did you not understand what that meant? 
---
It‚Äôs far more important to get data for the new killer and how their abilities and perks work against survivors and maps. Everyone else is secondary and can wait a few days.
---
Shoulda put a watermark then lol
---
Yep like the demogorgons lunge not working sometimes, Hawkins lab having a hatch you can't enter and a broken totem spot, missing textures on Hawkins also etc etc.
---
AHHHAAAA
---
what is this behavior?
---
Now that is an epic win.
---
You know what? That was a 100 IQ play (100 IQ is below average intelligence for an adult).
---
&gt;and if you Google prisoner abuse DBD won't either
---
Yes exactly...and if it did that would be an issue. Similar to if they stuck with "Cruel Confinement" the top results would be horrific news stories, lawyer websites....and DBD. They don't want to be associated with any actual horrific events or modern day issues
---
&gt;If they did they are more out of touch with heir own playerbase than I thought
---
This isn't about their playerbase this is about their public perception / relations. And just because a game is about fictious killers in some Lovecraft-ian world doesn't mean they endorse actual torture and modern day tragedies.
---
I think his lunge is fine lol, it‚Äôs quite easy to predict and dodge it on loops or corners
---
I get that they can't do decapitations but why would they animate a mori that so obviously should be a decapitation?
---
Yea, but still, it will get patched while I have to wait like, 2 years for the full release
---
the first one nah, the second one sounds good
---
In between this chapter and the next one along with the release of the archive that's what they said in the year 3 stream
---
I played on the dedicated servers and they definitely felt different than you'd expect. There were a lot of delays in actions. I hope Behaviour is able to touch it up more before Chapter release
---
U/adamcos1
---
the high IQ play is to run DS and head on. Stun with DS from locker, get back in locker, get the head on stun right after
---
ez way to farm survival points tbh...
---
I‚Äôve got a question. Does Fixated let you see the scratch marks caused by Diversion?
---
This is why when a new DLC comes out I usually just take a break from the game for about a week and let the dust settle because I can't queue as killer without waiting a ridiculous amount of time and I can't play as survivor without facing the same killer over and over _and over_ again
---
What, you've never been to Indiana? We've got brick tunnels poking out of every single building we construct. It's the only way to keep out the Corn Creatures and protect your infrastructure when an Indy Car flies off the speedway straight at your window.
---
okay, but what was with that pallet?
---
Adam looking like Denzel Washington
---
For some reason none of the pallets had loaded textures.
---
Get your own thread! /s
---
Eh I'm a console player also it really isn't that bad it should come out around 17-18th which is only 13 days away
---
Why would they remove it?
---
you're forgetting the firecracker blind
---
I mean the way I see it, it's the same as dodging a hillbilly, but in this case, it's not an instadown and it doesn't give him map pressure. That's why I don't see the need for a nerf.
---
Blasphemy, Q&amp;Q is fantastic!
---
Oh, I thought it was gonna be like bill
---
I cant believe 3 year still no lims coming off ü§î
---
He does have the legal right to grant them his professional likeness and they can loophole it by saying, ‚ÄúQuentin in game doesn‚Äôt look like Quentin from the movie, he looks like an actor that‚Äôs agreed to give us his likeness.‚Äù And, since no one actually owns the likeness for Quentin the character now, it doesn‚Äôt actually matter legally.
---
Use Rancor instead.
---
Well, now is the best time to find shit like that lmao
---
Yoir.. Kidding right? The demigoron litteely has new anmations on everything. He doesn't reuse a single killer anmation.
---
To me you just sound salty to be salty. His lunge is crappy I'm sorry what? His lunge is fucking amazing.
---
Demo is fine just the way he is
---
BHVR: *Releases gore DLC*
---
Me: *Overused Futurama meme (you know the one)*
---
Kind of agree, there is nothing stopping you from hooking your obsession, if they kill themselves on hook then you got a player out of the game.
---
Cruel Confinement is not the go-to wording for what you are talking about. This whole conversation is stupid, do you really think people would assume DBD endorses real world violence because an in-game item is named "Cruel Confinement"? That's the dumbest thing I've heard all week.
---
It's not his power as much as his regular lunge.
---
oh fuck you're right might as well get some ez boldness too fuck
---
I like how you stab the hatchet in the locker.
---
Might be less than that
---
Hey cool, I can swap to DBD off the GR: Breakpoint Beta when Ubisoft inevitably pisses me off.
---
That's good!
---
Someone should show this to Respawn
---
Bubba is exciting for new *FACES*.
---
Yep. Kyle Gallner was supposedly never even contacted for permission to use his likeness. IDK if they contacted New Line Cinema and they said no (Which doesn't make much sense) or what. 
---
Either way Quentin's face in DBD looks nothing like him, and sort of ugly to boot. Definitely would like his face changed.
---
Really? I‚Äôve only been seeing Nancys around
---
This is both hilarious and painful to watch as someone who plays killer regularly
---
Right like the majority of people dont play the new stuff and dont use it anyway, that would just be very unnecessary lmao
---
Ghosty is my fave
---
There is a subreddit for that
---
r/PerkByDaylight
---
i don't have enough shards for him yet, yet alone his new outfit üò©
---
Me too, but that's probably for the perks. I'd think that once people start getting perks on Steve, they'll run him more often. Maybe. I dunno.
---
What the fuck are you even talking about, Nurse has the sa- I was _inside her, behind her, **WHAT THE FUCK BEH**_ \*DC noise*
---
Looks really good but that whole upstairs area seems so obnoxious and unnecessary. You basically have to let that generator go. I‚Äôm going to try and save that gen for last as survivor, its so far away from everything its a lose lose scenario for the killer
---
GROOVY!
---
Are you a nurse? :)
---
No, computer operator! But ironically I am in school to obtain my RN. Haha. Yourself?
---
IMO they should make the dye/tar bottle addons just camo the traps to more closely match the floor color so that those addons aren't randomly bad on maps like Ormond or Lery's.
---
Also Trapper just needs a few small tweaks and he'd be a LOT better.  Start/carry all your traps, reduce escape RNG (like min time to escape solo should be 6-8s, max time 15-18s).  Slightly buff trap hitboxes so you don't have to pixel perfect place them in doorways/pallets to cut them off.  
---
Just those changes would make Trapper way better.
---
Be even better if you could even hear her idly strumming

&gt;cruel confinement is not the go-to wording for what you are talking about

[It is for the SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org/20140604/cruel-confinement-abuse-discrimination-and-death-within-alabamas-prisons), the organization *who literally socially defines who is and who is not a hate group.*
---
&gt;Do you really think people would assume DBD endorses real world violence because an in-game item is named "Cruel Confinement"
---
Imagine being a 50 year old mother looking into the legal issues of her son being held in prison in poor conditions and literally some video game pops up whens shes trying to search about her son's tragic situation. That would *not* look good for BHVR. They make a *video game* out of her son's tragedy she thinks? That's what's going on in her mind. 
---
Think of it this way, imagine the perk being called "domestic abuse", BHVR would be done for
---
Like it or not this is how PR and branding works, what you're associated with is extremely important
---
I'm convinced someone made a program to just create the opposite of what everyone is saying is good about the chapter and it spit this out.
---
you should really post this to the forms instead of here, bug reports are often not seen by devs here
---
Ah, the age-old debate. Would you rather have a clearer environment and effects, or shitty graphics that ironically help you see?
---
Oh, well that‚Äôs still pretty cool! And yes, actually. I graduated in May and I‚Äôm about two months into my first job as an RN. I will say Dead By Daylight isn‚Äôt really therapeutic after a long day at work though, hahaha.
---
I became a Kate main for the boob jiggle. Her boobs don't jiggle anymore though :(
---
Steve has worse perks so it makes sense
---
I‚Äôm skeptic that that is them, but at the same time
---
It‚Äôd be cool if those are the real deal
---
Only one way to tell... if they're streaming it or if they upload it. I feel like they would since it's the PTB with the new Stranger Things DLC and all.
---
I think it works, lore-wise. This isn't actually Hawkins, it's just the Entity's shoddy recreation of it. It doesn't know how it looks on the outside, so it fills in the blanks with its own creations
---
cant you just look at the profile
---
Not just the TV show license. They‚Äôd need to get the license for the actual killer from Scream.
---
Cant you change your name to anything on steam?
---
i heard about that and its really funny they just needed the rights to the mask
---
Welp i was too dumb at the time to think of that üòÇ.i wish I could look back and see
---
As a huntress main
---
This... does bring a smile to my face
---
I guess you can say Nea likes it rough.
---
I'd rather it drag them to the Upside Down of they're not able to do decapitations.
---
Yeah but their ranks seem realistic but I‚Äôm not entirely sure
---
To be fair u were playing a highly used ‚Äúold‚Äù killer with what some ppl consider op addons on a ptb where ppl want to see the new killer and perks etc. the dc‚Äôs are kinda justified imo.
---
* Screenshots highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
You‚Äôre literally playing spirit on PTB. You have no reason to complain.
---
Thanks I'm should do this more and let's see if behaviour will see this
---
Why was that?
---
I know ohm does play, I don‚Äôt follow squirrel but maybe they and delirious are Stranger Things fans so got into it for that reason. But I‚Äôd be skeptical without confirmation via a stream or video anyways
---
Jeff only has 3 perk slots unfortunately. One has to be Iron Will. Sucks because he has cool cosmetics.
---
you're really fuckin ignorant and dense
---
There has been nothing new about that game yet I'm getting worried :/
---
I‚Äôm kinda a noob

if you put ur arms up n down on the hook like crazy they do lol. my bf and i were watching it today like whoa hahaha! she's a hottie for sure
---
damn, you work fast
---
No, he‚Äôs the exact same. Maybe you‚Äôre just now noticing that he‚Äôs a bit on the hefty side.
---
Why does idiotic stuff like this get hundreds of upvotes? It‚Äôs not creative, it‚Äôs not inventive, and it‚Äôs extremely low effort.
---
This is a horror game
---
Thinking about it it would probably work best on Wraith if it was based on terror radius than any other killer and not doctor.
---
Honestly idk why it got upvoted either.
---
Eh it does give alot of distance though and the hit cone is as big as the edges of the screen(I think could be tinier) plus Hillbillies chainsaw is very loud where the demogorgons is just him opening his mouth for a second then lunging. It either needs slight tweaks or more audible indicator
---
I like playing against Pig and Ghostface because they're scary in a jumpy way. The rush of adrenaline once you've been exposed by GF, or you hear the roar of the lion as the Pig lunges at you is so fun
---
I'm gonna like playing against Demogorgon because he's scary, but in the exact opposite way. His sounds are so alien and you can hear then from all over, adding that bit of unease to him, and then his lunge is also terrifying to witness. So happy with his execution as a Killer
---
aS A biLL MaiN i cAn saY IT's nOt trUE
---
&gt;It is for the SPLC
---
They used it once in the entire article, and that was only in the name.
---
And as for your second paragraph... Just, what?
---
Practically anything you search up could have the same thing occur. And I don't know about you, but I dont think many 50 year olds will be interested in this game, let alone enough to warn the members of her jogging club to avoid it.
---
Imagine if they made a Killer whose mother was murdered by her father, then her father attempted to kill her.
---
Or a clown who would lure people in with his act then kill them.
---
Or a group of kids murdering someone randomly in cold blood.
---
Or anything else about this damn game. It is a game for adults, not children. This sort of pointless censoring shit doesn't even cover their asses from worry of "Cruel Confinement" causing issues.
---
If that was the case then they wouldn't have done half the shit they did.
---
You just have to practice, and you can‚Äôt get mad when you literally had one perk. You already had a disadvantage.
---
Ah well I'm pretty sure nothing like Bill being stuck on one platform will ever happen again

---
Speaking of the demogorgons lunge
---
I was playing on mother's dwelling and jumped from one of the building using my lunge and realized that you could probably use it to get to high to reach places, maybe outside of the map if you get lucky with rng on certain maps even?- its like old dead hard, when you kept your momentum in air, but on steroids
---
Inner Strength is better than Second Wind. You can break a totem at the start and save the Inner Strength charge for when you really need it. Whereas Second Wind is only after unhook and you become broken so if you wanted to save it because someone can heal you, you cant.
---
Iron will hard counters nurse and spirit? I don‚Äôt think so but this is a good build.
---
I saw a ton of ghostfaces on xbox.
---
I agree they should change his face.
---
I would recommend mayers or the pig for the perks, pig or ghostface for fun and freddy and maybe the new killer that will come out for some serious gameplay
---
u/vredditshare
---
I wasn't serious. Don't use that perk, unless you want to die faster
---
Isnt the new killer demogorgon? I believe
---
I'm out of the looo, what's wrong with Prayer Beads?
---
I really don't like gore but honestly it IS pretty weird there isn't at least a toggle like For Honor or something
---
Well the Ghostface we got is from scream he just wears the mask. I'd say wait as a dlc is coming out this month but if you want recommendations then i need to know what playstyle do you want from a killer, stealth, mindgames, aggression
---
Yeah, I'm not gonna pretend they're all angels lol
---
But if I can change the mind of one or two people to be a little more empathic and not just try to give someone a hard time for wanting to share their gameplay experience, that's all I really want.
---
Ikr
---
There‚Äôs nothing unnecessary about testing a new killer that has abilities others do not on maps where issues may or may not occur. That‚Äôs the entire point of the PTB.   
---
Speak for yourself regarding what perks players are using and not using. I‚Äôm here to check out the new perks against the new killer. If you‚Äôre not, then you should leave as you‚Äôre not helping anyone.

---
Anything for you bb
---
what? Thats like a normal game
---
Yeah idk how I did it
---
Spirit's already one of the strongest killer and being able to tell if she's coming or not was mostly based upon her phasing emission sound, removing that makes a once already incredibly stronger killer, even stronger, while removing counter play to her outside of hearing her footsteps.
---
This addon has always been a problem, I feel it's a bit too strong for a purple but that's just my opinion.
---
Yeah hate to say it but I dont think I have any preferred play style it's been awhile since I've played
---
The rank seem to match up as he hasn't played in so damn long but it could be fakers. Just gotta wait and see if he uploads a video about it
---
Do you?
---
my brain when reading the title at first: "bro how the fuck he get to rank one half"
---
Not at all like freddy, freddy doesn't need to set up another one to go to another, he can go to a generator, and survivors can destroy freddy's power
---
Hes just beautiful
---
pretty easy tbh lol
---
It is, so far he looks fun and very strong, but there is a hight nerf chance
---
Werewolf 
---
awooooo
---
Are redditors so dense that they cant see a joke unless you explicitly write out "/s" in your comment? Why all the downvotes
---
Good to know thanks
---
I have so much respect for Kyle Gallner. Such a wholesome and friendly guy :D always nice to see people mention him
---
Unnecessary to make that change. I literally just said people play new stuff anyway. Its definitely a minority of people doing other testing and playing with perks and maps on the older survivors and killers. What is difficult to understand?
---
Well what killer did you play the most before having a break from the game?
---
I hope they switch it to terror radius
---
IM NOT SORRY I USED BODY BLOCKING HAG!  IT‚ÄôS A FUN BUILD!  THE GAME IS STILL LASTING 10MINUTES OR MORE SO CHILL OUT SWF GROUPS!  I CAN RUN WHATEVER BUILD FOR ANY KILLER OR SURVIVOR I WANT!!!! GET OVER YOURSELVES!!!
---
If I had fun or not.
---
Sometimes I survive and pip but don't have fun for whatever reason. Sometimes I die and it's the most intense game I've had in a while, so I loved it.
---
I'd like to think that still holds true for killer but I think it's a lot harder to have fun when all 4 escape vs having fun when you die as survivor.
---
Maybe for survivors. For the Nurse it‚Äôs fkn ez mode
---
I think it's more because of licensed characters and that the developers are limited in what they can and can't do with the characters.
---
I believe it was the redneck. The one with the chainsaw that's not leather face
---
Ultra nut
---
Yeah, they didnt need to bring it down to 24 to prevent doctor mains from abusing it
---
The way PTB is set up doesnt even make me jealous that it isnt on console. It should put you in a build where every character is P3 50 and has every perk and exclude items like keys, insta heals and ebony moris. And you should have a higher chance to play on the new map by default, or maybe vote for the map.
---
It seems like people can just troll with 4 syringes then DC after wasting your time since nothing matters. Or play insidious leatherface with NOED. You cant really test much unless you came in with 1 mil BP, all shrine perks not bought and 8k shards. Rather just wait for live release.
---
MY EYES
---
No One Escapes Sid
---
thank you for clarifying sherlock
---
Hmmmmmmm
---
IM PRETTY SURE THEY NOTED THAT THE MATCHMAKING IS FUCKED UP RIGHT NOW. HOPEFULLY THEY FIX THIS QUICK.
---
More
---
that‚Äôs nice! alright cool thanks I just super curious
---
... stop.
---
Oh then I don't know the exact playstyle that is I think he's more so aggressive but whatever id say if you really want Ghostface then go for it but if you want a viable and aggressive killer then pick Freddy he can teleport,place down fake pallets(add-on) and snares to slow survivors.
---
It seems the entity's realm and the upside down have intersected because the exit gate area has all the upside down gunk all over it
---
I don't really get the liking to barb.
---
He is *really* fun to play....
---
Ok thanks for the suggestion
---
May I introduce

L A T E N C Y?!
---
You could look at recently played with right players right? I swear you could do that on steam
---
That play was _at least_ 200 IQ!
---
*Freddy mains just lurking in the corner*
---
yeah i finished for the night after the 3rd game in a row of players 6-9 ranks above me, this is double my playtime or more?  Laff.
---
No problem have fun I guess?
---
u/Peanits The man himself has spoken. We must do what he says. #MakeQuentinAFuckingHumanPlease
---
The survivors are prisoners who are beyond abused. They‚Äôre killed countless times on a regular basis. I don‚Äôt understand why the idea of associating the game with prisoner abuse would be so bad because that‚Äôs the whole point of the game when you really think about it.
---
If that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôll go look, but I‚Äôm not entirely sure they‚Äôre real
---
When you spawn, put portal down. Put portal down in corners of the map, like try to hide then by rocks. After downing someone (the lunge is nuts), you can place a portal down over the hook and TP across the map. BBQ would help with this. Since you have an insidious effect after TPing, you can really catch survivors off guard. And you can still defend the hook because you can TP back. It takes a lot of time for survivors to break your portals, thats why its smart to try and hide them in corners of the map so they are less likely to be seen and its awkward to cleanse.
---
wow why would his head still be in tact though lol.
---
&gt; (100 IQ is below average intelligence for an adult)
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs exactly average. Like, defined as average.
---
the best part is that it literally says 14 days ago in the screenshot
---
Well look it up if it's possible no hurt in trying
---
Ghost face is ready for more selfys
---
Wow, that's toxic. Who gets mad at a killer for perks. Especially if you're 8 ranks behind them
---
That is the best totem spot ever I wish I was the killer with lullaby
---
This is what the devs want to see PTB wise. This should blow up and get attention so it‚Äôs taken care of before the official release. Good lookin‚Äô out.
---
EDIT: obviously they don‚Äôt want to see bugs, but they know they‚Äôre their so help them know!
---
LoL I wish I was that lucky as killer üòÄ
---
You really think I‚Äôm going to wait for games on the PTB just to go against a sweaty ass Spirit with the best addons? You‚Äôre a clown, playing PTB with a different killer than DG is already dumb, but you‚Äôre gonna play the best shit making it the worst experience you can have on this game? Yeah fucking right lol
---
And then they probably don‚Äôt have even have all 4 perks, much less meta perks and you‚Äôre playing the absolute best shit. For what? Foh
---
&gt;typical swf trying to genrush
---
What a dumbass comment. Stacking on a gen because you spawn together isn‚Äôt genrushing moron, you can‚Äôt genrush with no toolboxes. It‚Äôs just you playing terribly. What a hypocrite
---
And this is after they spent the entire match BMing and bullying. It's beyond frustrating and honestly at this point why does the ranking system even exist?
---
They can though. Pubg has one. It's totally doable, just more work than Bhvr will do. But hey PC players can do it so fuck console, amirite
---
I wish Laurie could have more outfits in general
---
BT would not help because Demogorgon will just be across the map and teleport back. Which also comes with no terror radius effect so BT wouldnt even work if you waited. His basement game is nuts but lots of killers are strong in the basement so its not a big deal.
---
All aboard the downvote train!
---
I leveled up Nancy to level 40 and then went to my boi
---
I love how you can watch them die and go limp during the head thrashing.
---
Quick question what's a crutch perk I hear it alot but what's it mean?
---
... and trying out the Killer and survivor before buying. That is one of the huge side effects of allowing people to play paid content for free.
---
How'd you lose with iridescent head with infantry belt? I'm insanely curious.
---
Well, dbd has the worst fan base, gl on your next match
---
I play on Xbox as well and don‚Äôt a have problem finding a game as killer or survivor maybe ur rank. If ur to high or to low it‚Äôs harder to find matches bc the player base for new people is low and higher ranks are hard to get to
---
Once ur green/purple rank games should be quick
---
Use decisive strike, it‚Äôll make you feel better when you stun the killer for tunneling you. What you do after you stab the killer in the neck is up to you.
---
Oh hey i know a Sid once, i owe the fucker some money and he promised to beat my skull in with a tree branch if i didn't give it back.
---
No, 110 is around average. 100 is below average. Not by too much, but it‚Äôs noticeable.
---
Am I crazy or did they bring that actress back for Nancy?
---
Something that gives him some sort of map pressure and a way to travel the map faster.
---
Imo every killer should have some method of moving around a map quicker nightmare is an example.
---
For balance their map pressuring ability won't be as good as billy and nurse but it should be good enough to help stall the game a bit that way they have a better chance at winning at high rank
---
You can counter Hex: Ruin by not doing generators

Wrong, you don‚Äôt play the whole game with 3 perks. NOED rewards you if it activates or not. If it doesn‚Äôt, you‚Äôve saved 70+ seconds (14 sec to cleanse * 5 totems). Adding the time it takes to find the totems you‚Äôve basically made it so another gen must be completed. If all totems aren‚Äôt done then you get your free 1 hit down for failing your main objective.
---
What about Claudette lol
---
If your savior can hide after an unhook and yo can't it's not the killers fault he only knows ur location, letting you go is litteraly against the games objective
---
Pro Tip: You can counter Ruin by uninstalling the game immediately!
---
Idk looks pretty real to me, I've been seeing people play it all day. Maybe you live in a different universe, though, and they're only tied together by the internet.
---
Except no killers farm during double bps. Ebonys and tunneling everywhere
---
So his portals aren't just for transportation and patrolling, they also give you information at critical points in the match. Placing a portal and activating it near Ruin lets you know whenever someone is closing in on it. Having an active portal near a gen acts sort of like surveilance and makes them waste time closing it instead of repairing. You want to be mindful of when and which portals you activate because his activated portals let you apply a lot of pressure if you know how to use them right.
---
The other tip I have is to save his dash and not use it everytime. For instance, if you are chasing a survivor in the corn field you can fake his power as they are looking behind them to make them zig zag. Them trying to dodge the dash lets you just easily catch up to them and hit them with your basic attack.
---
If ever killer should have a way to move around the map quickly then where's my doc boys speed buff alt power?
---
Expert analysis.
---
You‚Äôre red then lol
---
I‚Äôm only green and I‚Äôve gotten it twice before
---
And this is why you're still working at McDonald's
---
I would save if I were you
---
Free Quentin from his face!
---
cool yeah its not my specs or internet. plus i see stuttering in the menu also. i feel like it could just be the ptb download itself.
---
Thanks
---
He will find a match where itll be fun for him. Just gg and proceed lmaooo. He literally was upset bcuz some random jane tossed pallets likes shes supposed too smh
---
do you know what the PTB is?
---
Nothing carries over, its for testing. Once it releases you dont have anything of it
---
I‚Äôm rank 14, is that any good?
---
Run decisive, use an insta heal, learn a loop or 2. Survivor is easy to play.
---
Same here
---
Actually I left Mc. Donald's 4 years ago and now make $480 weekly. Not much, but I'd blow it all on whatever you're smoking because that shit must work well to turn your brain to that level of stupid.
---
Dropping pallets for no reason is not something you‚Äôre supposed to do...no wonder he won
---
"You are a bold one"
---
I mean you are literally just giving the killer a free win so?  If anything you are helping him
---
I hate when the killer gets unhooked
---
I'm not sure how'd they do it but maybe he charges up his electricity and he starts moving super fast.
---
For for balancing his terror radius is a bit bigger letting him use his madness power more effective and giving survivors a heads up before he reaches them
---
How dare you not include the Hag‚Äôs Alpha as fuck gangster lean?
---
Im usually purple ranked, but I mean getting many points as Legion is pretty easy :)
---
Na this is a case of elite anal killer. Go play PC if you want competition.  Not everyone is here to be a try hard . Some players wanna have fun and some sorry about rank. But to insult someone after good sportmanship?  Lol too much
---
I thought you said ass..
---
No...his lunge literally is the range of one side of the basement shack building. Majority of a T wall. It has a 45 degree aim assist so just saying ‚Äúdodge‚Äù is a shit counter. And he already has map pressure with quick teleports and 115% movement speed. The lunge is not staying untouched upon release, it‚Äôs just gonna be broken now for all the stranger things fans. And the lunge does not have a base 2.5 second charge like chainsaw. It‚Äôs almost instantaneous and you have an almost nonexistent cooldown for missed lunges. 
---
Just like the new map is bullshit for killers, the lunge is bullshit for survivors
---
The PTB, for most people, is a chance to try the new content for free and make a decision on whether or not to buy it. Don't know if you want to spend money for the Demogorgon? Hop on the PTB and try him out, if you dont like him you know not to buy him on full release. Console players dont get that luxury ~~because BHVR is lazy~~ because sOny hAS A CertIficAtIon prOcesS
---
Well enjoy working graveyard shifts for the rest of your days if that's how you behave
---
They want to make sure she is obsession material with that shirt.
---
You asked why he was complaining about the perks they ran, and that's exactly WHY he was complaining about the perks they ran.
---
They built their loadouts with a very specific goal in mind, and then were assholes on top of it.
---
Not sure why you would think it would be removed
---
Was this on PC or console?
---
PTB = public test build. 
---
if you are on PC you can opt to test out new content like new killers and survivors for a few days so that the devs know whats wrong with it so they can change it before the official release
---
What is dying light even?
---
Hey, I work third shift now! Its lovely, dont have to deal with people like you irl. 3rd shift runs this country, fool.
---
We need more that movie is a classic imo
---
The almighty Flying Billy
---
Hes one of the worst killers
---
I like it.
---
Yeah, it was knocked off a table, bounced off the adjacent brick wall and then landed on the downstem. Probably would have been fine if it hadn't landed on the weakest spot.
---
I mean, that's entirely true.
---
Thank goodness for you, Ornstein. Someone else knows this. :V
---
 That cosmetic looks like a survivor of its own
---
Nancy&gt;&gt;Steve
---
100% agreed, was always a person favorite of mine
---
Well, since the actor who portrayed him is granting permission, that's pretty much a done deal.
---
Despite all IP nonsense aside, a person owns the way they look, because...ya know, it's them.
---
Cause Demi has a penis head
---
&gt;sOny hAS A CertIficAtIon prOcesS
---
might not believe that, but thats the real reason.
---
Also the threat was obviously about the full release...
---
Well the blood factor I‚Äôm sure is a variable? But congratulations!!!! A lot of my friends who also graduated say it‚Äôs so rewarding yet tiring.
---
Well all of the killers have to have a base, right? I guess they just didn‚Äôt mask the base enough.
---
Let‚Äôs put it this way. The perk is literally an alternate urban evasion. It‚Äôs attributes are more allocated into mobility than LOS breaking though... when urban evasion was released, it was thought it was gonna be ‚Äúbusted, op‚Äù etc, so... they made it turn off while injured. Time goes by and lo and behold, the perk was trash. Obviously this perk isn‚Äôt nearly that weak, but the limitation still seems excessive
---
They should just have the plus sign like how almost every other game does it.
---
Some killers just want to run an endgame build, nothing wrong with that.
---
We have "The Ghost Face" in the game. I'm not sure if they care about what sounds better lol.
---
How else would they find out if the new patch broke something? Spaghetti code works in mysterious ways. Also just let people whatever they want.
---
On April's fools they need to do something Final Destination
---
Not just P3. P3 level 50 with every perk in the game
---
I‚Äôm rank 10 and picked up Myers a few days ago. First match I knew he was my main. And he has so many playstyles it‚Äôs crazy. You can go from infinite 1 shots to no terror radius wallhacks.
---
Oh I see I didn‚Äôt know they were behind Apex. Thanks for the context.
---
It‚Äôs normal no add-on
---
Do people think he is OP? I've been watching gameplay of him and he seems like a worse nurse/ hag combo.
---
I feel so tempted to have a Steve build and fill it with altruistic items and perks and be the ultimate Team Mom.
---
Yea I‚Äôm rank 13 killer and I‚Äôve been getting red and purple rank survivors. Don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with the lobbies
---
Quick question does anyone know where this format is from? Is it from godzilla with that 3-headed monster?
---
Can, but most likely won't because ds is a thing and every killer is scared of it
---
I agree I'm just not sure what they could give him short if just making him a Billy clone. Hes my favorite of the licensed killers and I really wanna see him become something more than a facecamper.
---
I think when it comes to other examples like this you are right, but when it comes to exhaustion perks in particular I feel that it too closely ties the line of being OP. Exhaustion perks (EP) are incredibly strong, and they all have a cool down to counteract that. Even when it was a flat time it was too strong, so they nerfed EP again by adding the running stipulation.
---
The main thing is DH. It is, without a doubt, the strongest effect. A literal invincibility button. What makes it more balanced is the injured requirement and the predictability of it. But if you let people move 20 percent faster with Vigil then DH will become the over the top best exhaustion perk. Will you have to run 3 perks to make it work? Yes. But when it is super strong it wont matter. It wont be a meme build, it will just become OP.
---
That's my take, at least.
---
Read Claudettes backstory.
---
‚ÄúOn a long bus ride home, Claudette got lost in the woods...‚Äù 
---
I kid you not thats what it says.
---
I feel like an old man driving away kids from my lawn when i'm up against gen tappers. I'm not even running ruin and people still do it.
---
Yeah, so sad about it. And what sucks is that it most likely will never recover. Devs are jumping ship and eventually it will just die, which sucks cause it looked soo fun
---
I honestly have No Clue how they could make him better without making him more like Billy.
---
awww i fucking can't fucking wait to fucking play on that fucking map when the fucking dlc fucking drops! :)
---
Frick yeah
---
* Screenshots highlighting multiple iridescent emblems (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
Did ya feel it with micheal with his spoopy piano
---
Well....time to learn Head-On.
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs the only killer I‚Äôm gonna be seeing for 1-2 Weeks.
---
It has a lot,incredibly good for already good players and a great start for new players and fan of the franchise.
---
I also see a lot of Ghostface on Xbox. Seems to be popular here for some reason.
---
Ghostface is killing it back there.
---
Does anyone know the name of the second song? The Halloween remix with Jigsaw saying I want to play a game.
---
How are people saying it‚Äôs op when nurse exists?
---
What is that?
---
Yeah maybe dont be such an ignorant fucking piece of shit assuming they teabagged
---
Of course it's good for distance but the survivors can just destroy your portals unlike Freddy I'm not saying it's bad I'm just saying it ain't as good as others it's mediorce also you can't just set up portals anywhere(and you need to stand on the portal to even teleport)
---
Last week as a red rank survivor I was against a level 20 no perk no add on trapper. He only managed to hit one person once. I was letting him hook and kill me at the end but he brought me to exit. I felt bad.
---
ye But thats the Problem, it only looked good. It really was a terrible playing experience
---
He is fun to go against and play as and those add ons are cool
---
If you're tunnelling one surv for whatever reason and you're dedicated to It, might as well just eat that ds and continue the tunnel.
---
I think this is where it can get a little grey. 
---
He definitely owns the way he looks, there‚Äôs no changing that. But he doesn‚Äôt own the character. And since were being sold that character, he can‚Äôt choose whether or not it gets to look like him, even though it is him. He may be Quentin, but Quentin isn‚Äôt him. If that makes sense. 
---
I could be wrong tho.
---
Yep! I get it in the menu too! Live runs fine. What are your specs?
---
0_0 Probably not ahaha
---
Well she was pretty forgettable
---
This is what Im trying to say, most of the time the killer Just has to tunnel you and you can Just bring him to other survs, so he would change targets
---
You can the add ons to see survivors auras and even the killers aura
---
Yeah, I'd like to give it a shot just to see how chaotic it would be.
---
Omg I logged in to look at the outfits and that‚Äôs literally the first thing that came out of my mouth I thought I was insane and just never realized he was fat lol
---
AH
---
Freddy also has to wait 40 seconds to Teleport, his power is litteely countered by waking up, and his Teleport takes way longer.
---
He's exactly like Freddy in terms of how you use the portals.
---
IQ tests are specifically calibrated so that the average is 100.
---
&gt; [...] an IQ score of 100 means that the test-taker's performance on the test is at the median level of performance in the sample of test-takers of about the same age used to norm the test.
---
[More to read about, if you want.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification) The "IQ classification tables for current tests" section has relevant info on some of the different kinds of IQ tests, but the scoring is built around the idea that 100 is average.
---
Hopefully they have a spot like this on every map.
---
Maybe they'll go for steve when it goes live since now the personal connection is there. For now theyre tryimg out nancy and her perks then drop her when it goes live
---
People keep saying there is a blood hunt starting on the 5th, but I haven't seen anything official about it so it was probably fake and still being spread around.
---
Looks kinda like Jack... Handsome Jack.
---
You should really learn what leaked means. It's not leaked if the devs themselves showed it.
---
After survivor level 12, I haven‚Äôt seen that other than meme basement builds. Went against a LF the other day that was pretty good at chainsawing around sharp corners.
---
"How's it *feeeeel* Bendial, to be a *bitch*?"
---
The urge to jump onto PTB and try it out is strong but it's always so worth to experience it for the first time when it's actually live without bugs and everything in order!
---
as a dweet, i am saddened by this ballsy low IQ play
---
Startlingly accurate
---
Please do it.
---
They've said literally a hundred times they're done chasing down people who bugged and lost their legacy.
---
It's not excusable but you have to let it go. They don't care.
---
They already have the actual rights, otherwise they wouldn't have a NOES expansion with a character named quentin
---
would recommend changing that control from the touchpad to literally anything else. i know i accidentally pressed it WAY too much.

So to counter your "bait DH" (well not counter, it is a legit strategy) it is still incredibly strong because if the dash aspect. You can use it to close a gap, risk free, ensuring more loops and more time spent. That is why it is so strong, because you dont even have to worry about dodging a swing, you can just use it to avoid them getting to that point entirely.
---
And I get what you're saying, it may not seem like much. But being able constantly DH would be incredibly strong, strong enough to justify running 4 perks. If you could somehow magically run 4 perks that let you SB every 30 seconds wouldn't you? Even though it uses up all your perks.
---
Only for censorship reasons. Clown removes fingers. 
---
I am hoping they remove the head in the final release.
---
Where can i get the original? I love this format.
---
Its a straight line that can't turn, has a charge and recover time, and is easily telegraphed. The people complaining about it probably don't bother trying to look behind themselves in a chase and run away in a straight line even against huntress, nurse, and billy.
---
Plot twist the op is actually being wholesome instead of toxic
---
It is for the SPLC

Are we still pretending that they're not just a blatantly partisan group that defines anything right of Chairman Mao as a "hate group"?

She reminds me of Natalie Dormer in the Hunger Games
---
When you get Moried you just have a conversation with the guy in his mouth
---
More of a reason for BHVR to try and not step on their toes
---
Yeah it‚Äôd be strong. But the build doesn‚Äôt work as long as you don‚Äôt lose them. It‚Äôll only get nasty if they successfully escape the chase, which should happen unless the killer makes a mistake, or the survivor gets a big boost; which dead hard isn‚Äôt.
---
I feel you on this
---
She cut her hand on a beer can. She wasn't meant to survive.
---
I think they mean the powered lunge. Besides, Freddy's lunge is longer than the weapon so his short weapon combined with his height can have a standard sized lunged compared to everyone else, its not broken its just cheesed to be normal.
---
Dlc chapters don‚Äôt have official platinums though, which makes me happier, as I don‚Äôt have to worry as much
---
Counter noed by uninstalling the game
---
Plague has some nice perks and fun gameplay loop with the two different vomits. I have liked her a lot. Not as strong killer as the hillbilly you have played but fun. Personally I like Plague over Ghostface.
---
Took me while, before realizing it was a troll, huehue
---
 When in console tho?
---
P3 tweaker mains
---
Hmm wasnt she released along side ash William's for survivor. Also thanks for the suggestion
---
It was going to be the 5th if the PTB started last week. But given it was pushed back a week, I would expect it to be pushed back a week too
---
Can't play terror radius perks on Freddy anymore FeelsBadMan
---
I'm gonna be a demogorgon main I don't care if he's nerfed into the ground, I need to play this cutie
---
Well I think Tom Holland was having fun in the MCU, buuuuut
---
I play both and find killer way less frustrating
---
I thought they'd add Undetectable to Insidious, Ghost Face, Pig or Wraith, but well, maybe later
---
Meg was making use of DS, unless teabag was involved that aint toxic..
---
If you‚Äôre a survivor in a chase you can escape with the trap on your head.
---
But it would also need to be balanced to me cover half to all the map with terror radius perks
---
What. So you're telling me that survivors don't cleanse totems most matches anyway? And wow, 70 whole seconds broken down into small chunks that would have most likely happened anyway just in case of NOED. No it didn't reward you, in fact you take risk, one which pays off if survivors don't do all of their objectives, which most try to do. As to failing your main objective, nope, you haven't failed until everyone is out, the game hasn't ended, if you've played for end game then you've played for end game. You get less points but you haven't failed until the Gabe is over.
---
Big brain. You must be fun to play with or against. Have a good life
---
Ah yes, the hatch stand off of the olden days. What a time.
---
Saaame I didn‚Äôt kill anyone in a match and they all msged me that I suck and to get gud. Even when they win they bring the salty.
---
Fuck off
---
Whatever you're doing, stop.
---
I supposed while he's using his speed boost madness will Not Increase and after using the boost it wont increase madness for 10 seconds
---
Exactly! I play both to learn more about the game and not be biased. But after playing killer, i really do go survivor to cooldown. Thinking about 4 people and getting so worried on doing good chases really stresses you out
---
Full Pink Ace
---
They said it was a placeholder but we know better, i havent played ptb as i cannot at the moment but she sounds like laurie to me
---
So I‚Äôm chilling in my room playing GTA:V when my brother who‚Äôs a nurse main on Xbox sends me a text stating ‚ÄúI just had my best nurse match ever. Probably my best dead by daylight match ever. It was glorious.‚Äù And then tells me to get to his room. He then shows me his game against a 4-man swf with two instaheals and a bnp. And he played a meme build to have a large terror radius (shadowborn, M&amp;A, Distressing, and Coulrophobia) while also having his volume set to 0 so he couldn‚Äôt hear anything in-game at all. Oh, and he was listening to this video the entire time he played: https://youtu.be/KmtzQCSh6xk
---
And this motherfucker got the 4K. The shit my brother does while playing this game lol
---
sorry this is 11 hours later, but i just played demo on the ptb and "of the abyss" is his pounce, and the portals are just kinda called "open portals" i dont know what shred is
---
I think he is like hillbilly in the pounce counter play from long range
---
Hitboxes are definitely a problem. People love to say that it is just latency that causes bad hits, but then why is it when I play killer (where I‚Äôm the host) I still manage to hit survivors when they already vaulted a window and are 2ft away from it by the time I swing? 
---
Any killer main would be lying if they said they‚Äôve never gotten a hit that they know shouldn‚Äôt have connected. That is a hitbox problem, which becomes amplified by high latency and just makes the problem that much worse. Hopefully dedicated servers will make latency less of an issue, but after that the devs still need to look into hitboxes because something is off.
---
It‚Äôs didn‚Äôt even come off
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
If it was ruin we‚Äôd still lose it 5 seconds in
---
Exactly. Look at all the whinny children.
---
Also when the game ends, I cant click on anything and I'm forced to close it with task manager
---
You're very kind üòä I draw for a long time but decided recently to actually post my drawings cause I thought I wasn't good. I will add more and post my art here: https://www.deviantart.com/imaginarybunny

I think it'd be more than fair to have killers communicate with one another, since it's no longer a solo endeavor.  What do you think the worst combination of killers would be from a survivor perspective?
---
I disagree, the player base will most certainly take a dip at some point if they don‚Äôt add more than a ranking system to the game, i started playing this game with 5-6 friends and they all stopped playing because the game gets boring and repetitive. They‚Äôre all red ranks too.

It's not released yet. The version you are seeing is a test version for PC.

She also sent a message to me telling me to kill myself.

It hasn't been released yet, the characters are only up for a trial run on the public test build on PC

Oh yea... the time to quit the game for a week will soon be upon us

I guess you made your choice-
---
I VapeDoot420 like the idea of a Steve Harvey survivor
---
They don't, yes, but all it takes is one or two of those which happens at midranks pretty commonly. And instaheals are one every two games in red ranks. It's also not hard to adapt to.
---
This x100
---
Ok just because it doesn't insteadown doesn't mean its perfectly balanced the lunge is long,has no charge time, big hit radius, and gives little warning it definitely needs to be tweaked
---
the dlc is available on the ptb rn but the dlc won't be listed in the actual game approximately 2 weeks from now
---
Sounds exactly like a game I played in. Spirit also brought an ebony Mori. After everyone else DCed they watched me crawl around the map for three minutes before shutting the hatch and hooking me. I'm kind of convinced that you were the spirit. Whether you were or not you (or you guys) are pretty sad for try harding on the ptb when everyone is just trying to test out the new shit
---
empty slot in a SWF lobby on the PTB

I think Ash was after plague. Demise of the Faithful was plague, Jane Romero and Temple of Purgation.

The turning after a successful hit is the "turn at the end" they were talking about, iirc. It's the same in the Demogorgon stream.

The game gets boring and repetitive because the generator gsmeplay has been the exact same for 3 years.

Her perks can definitely make their way into the meta. They are 1,000 times better than his. She is more quiet than Steve. She is smaller and harder to see. And the Reddit Community is a loud minority. There's a lot of people playing as Steve but just so many more playing as Nancy I guess. Myself included. Maybe that will change once people get their teachables and the Scoops Ahoy cosmetic is released.

I expected the Demogorgon to seem awfully silly within the context of DbD, but they've managed to translate it feeling like a monster into the game surprisingly well. The skin tone is a little too on the human side of things in the menus, but that's mostly due to the lighting - in the trials, it's pale and alien-looking. I am however disappointed that it doesn't use the crawling stance from the trailer and the menu in the trials, as that would add considerably to its "animalic" feeling. It would be such an obvious use when it comes crawling out of the portals, at least for those first few seconds of exiting where it doesn't have a terror radius. Or it could be used for the "Shred" ability, which would also make it more obvious when it is charging its ability in some situations, but in others allow it to use the crawl stance to hide behind map architecture, as well. Another could-be-cooler aspect of its design is the animation of travelling through the Upside-Down, where instead of just black, a dark mirror version of the map would be great to see. Or even just looking into the level from below like you would if you were to fall outside its boundaries, although with a dark-enough filter over it that you can't easily make out where survivors are.
---
The lab is the most visually refined map in the game to date, and the survivors really do have their actors' likeness.
---
Gameplay-wise, the Demogorgon seems at least decently mid tier, with the Shred ability having enough potential to put it into the high mid or even high tier. The portals offer good map mobility and control, and have obvious synergy with Make Your Choice and Pop Goes The Weasel. The map plays a little weirdly, cluttered and claustrophobic, but I don't think that's a bad thing, having a map that feels different. Many of the pallet loops themselves are unsafe, but they reward using the rooms in unconventional ways. The perks are as underwhelming as I expected they would be, but at least they have niche utility and are kind of fun to use. I am glad they buffed Second Wind - it is now a pretty decent perk, B or even A tier material.
---
He had a lot of time left on that hook. Looks like they might have left so they wouldn't get bloodwardened.
---
Plot twist:in the 4th season of 'Stranger Things' Steve and Nancy get yeeted into the Entity's realm w/demogorgon
---
Pig in my opinion. Ghostface's ability is too easily nullified still, and Pig is just fun. Also, cute stun sound makes it better.
---
This dude can make them work though. With constant vision and pressure on both gates, 12 seconds of remember me turns into an eternity.
---
It honestly wouldn't bother me as much without the pointing, clicking, and teabagging. i can deal with doing bad, but for it feels really shitty to be endlessly taunted throughout a game for really minor mistakes or just a difference in skill level, and it's not even that rare
---
Lord, forgive me for what I'm about to do
---
The reason shred doesn't work with perks like STBFL, Dark devotion, Surge is because it isn't a M1 hit and with how big the lunge you can do is to have a non existent cooldown with STBFL would be broken, I agree shred should definitely have a charge bar, you can actually turn a little with shred but it's difficult, for the others but the second to last one I can't really say much on them.   The reason shred is so finicky is because it's possibly a new hit cone causing it to buggy and not consistent as all other killers only attack with one hand meaning two hands would need a new hit cone.

couple games ago i went against 3 red ranks while playing my like, literal 3rd game as nurse, AND i'm green rank on killer atm. they all escaped, i na rather frustrating manner too, and then tried to talk down to me for playing nurse. like, really??? :/  
---
I just wanted to have fun, this community has like no middle ground, seems that people are either toxic and stupid as shit or really nice and supportive
---
Didn't you read the Survivor Handbook for Killers? You're not allowed to use your power for any reason whatsoever
---
(Sarcasm)
---
That‚Äôs quitter talk
---
Scrub doctor please? Thank you! I love your work.
---
Hey I mean atleast it's more points in survival(seriously survival category is so hard to get points in)
---
/u/Drachen_Koenig I enjoyed your story, don't let the negative nancy get ya down :)
---
slinking around a town, stalking and killing
---
not a bad idea except for how shit the map is  
---
ill just play Badham instead
---
So you can only detect survivors on activated portals (yellow ones/ ones you've traveled to). Also, in order to detect them you have to go into your Of the Abyss, it doesn't just automatically detect like Legion. 
---
His portals are super high skill ceiling and pretty high skill floor to even get any real value out of them. The dash is definitely more consistent but with good use of both he's looking like he can be really strong. Not gonna lie though I almost guarantee his dash is going to get nerfed and he's going to go the way of Ghostface in just being another ok killer.
---
He's so sweet, I wish it could actually happen
---
Gorgon is so cute. I hope they don't nerf him like they did poor Fredward
---
Agree. Yesterday I played against a Demogorgon and he did his lunge almost right in front of me and missed.
---
Why bitch about long wait times,  to end a match in 3 minutes. What is the point? What's fucking fun about that?
---
Legion+Nurse sounds pretty lethal to me.
---
Ah yes, wouldn‚Äôt want to have anything obscene in this here m rated SLASHER videogame
---
I mean last I checked people are still allowed to complain. If you don't like it don't comment :3
---
I actually asked peanits this he said they are going to try change him, it's just hard because it's a licensed character and all
---
They didn't reuse the hags trap animation
---
I asked peanits on the discord he said they want to but its difficult due to licensed chapter and all
---
Oh wow, low quality doesn't look good? Shocker.
---
Ghostface, i main wraith because i really enjoy the things you can do with no terror radius
---
So not only do survivors have shitty hit boxes but you want the bear traps to have them as well?
---
The community has been waiting for this idea to launch for months now
---
my bad
---
Luckyü§§
---
Is this sub just shit posts and low effort memes?
---
Ive had that happen to me as Myers before and I didn't even realize til I got smacked with one
---
I agree the map looks like balls. Doesnt matter if the dlc ends up bad, no one will care because "hey, looks I'm Steve". I'm still optimistic since it's only the ptb
---
Charge bar for shred will ruin it. It can be dodged and avoided so why hinder him even more?!
---
Nancy looks really cursed
---
Exactly, then at that point it will be just like huntress, nurse, and billy with the survivor trying to juke it and the killer trying to mindgame/predict the juke.
---
And? That's nothing special
---
Anyone know if these guys have ported to GMOD yet? :D
---
He has to charge it tho
---
Plot twist:Nancy and Steve are having a wet dream about being inside the entity's realm.
---
Some of his jokes are quite trivial and just remarks about what the community says instead of thinking for himself.
---
I'm pretty sure they just wanted a visual on how close they are to charging it but keep the same time to charge it plus I mean would a actual charge bare hinder the gorgon that much? It's instantaneous basically adding 2 or 3 seconds wouldn't hinder it that bad
---
Thanks, i laughed my ass off when my brother told me what he was listening to while he was steamrolling that match, figured a few others might as well. so long as you enjoyed it, making this post was worth the (low) amount of effort to make it üëç
---
While being facecamped, any escape is an impressive feat. Yeah it is mostly luck, but he still avoided being knocked after unhooking directly in front of the killer.
---
Then they can try red ranks for killer? Although if they feel like they're not being challenged then yeah the game can get stale. Im hooked on this game because of the skill required and also the freedom of how to play things out. You can put handicap on yourself or go for memes
---
Only plus side is that most survivors who run the perk are trash even at red rank, so I can down them again within 15 seconds, but it's still ridiculous
---
So a normal game with randoms, I've been doing it right this whole time!
---
This is "low effort"?
---
Low effort would be pasting four pngs of the demogorgon on the original meme template.
---
Did I say it was special? Nope, just ranting.
---
nah a minute is pretty fair now imagine if it was like 80 seconds or some shit
---
That sounds right. If the character was himself he could grant permission but he cannot for a Quentin character.
---
Agreed, they need to find a way to make the game more expandable
---
My only complaint is the guaranteed EGC death if he closes the hatch honestly, everything else is fine. In fact this is the most fun I‚Äôve had going against a new killer in a long while.
---
It certainly feels like 80 seconds. I legit thought it was 90 until I googled it a week ago. Shit lasts forever
---
I‚Äôm in purple ranks right now, and just tonight played a game against a rank 2, a rank 8, and then 2 rank 20‚Äôs. When I asked if it was shit queue or a SWF game, they said they all queued solo. 
---
Idk what‚Äôs going on with the matchmaking right now, but it‚Äôs definitely... interesting.

Probably going to get some very awkward questions if someone catches you looking at it at work.
---
Well he doesn't bite, he's actually kind of shy. But if you hold a toolbox he'll come after you and try and take it.
---
Turn them into slugs
---
Say sike right now
---
But I don't know who all has it is the problem
---
They'd probably have to negotiate a new deal with (aka paying) the license holders to make any depiction changes to the characters, even if it is something as small as a face lift.
---
They would've had to do so to make the new cosmetics for Ash, Tapp &amp; Amanda.
---
The entire point of the lunge is for it to be long and the big radius doesn‚Äôt matter when positioning properly. As far warning goes it‚Äôs  entire face opens up and makes a noise. The noise could be louder I guess but that‚Äôs the only I could think of that could be changed. 
---
Even with the lunge in it‚Äôs current state the demo can still be looped so demo‚Äôs not as good as nurse or spirit. I also don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be as good as billy. Demo‚Äôs needs this lunge to be strong if it‚Äôs not then there‚Äôs no point in really having it aside from a few niche situations and demo will just be kinda like a weaker freddy
---
I care about improving, but like, I only really get frustrated with myself if i'm playing way worse than i know I'm capable of, otherwise i just try to improve, though messing up map pressure does feel shitty in particular. for me, tbagging at pallets usually doesn't lose distance because people wait for you to break them often anyways, DCing isn't too bad, but can take some satisfaction and bloodpoints away, clicking flashlight is fine by itself, but usually these people are miles ahead of me at looping, the click and click and i can't catch them usually. maybe a lot of them are derankers or something idk
---
They are going to beat me to death
---
And when you are a survivor being tunneled it feels like 10 seconds ;; time is super relative, you probably down the others too quickly and thats why it feels so long. Just count the minute in your head and you should be good
---
Why does she look like Nena from her music video "Anyplace, Anywhere, Anytime"
---
licensing fascinates me. They have a right to the character, but not his likeness. Can they have a right to him, right to the character from the movie, but not HIS likeness from the movie?
---
Seems like the kind of bullshit red tape they would have to jump through, lol
---
Just similar
---
They updated all the hair but I think they forgot about people who play the game on low settings. üòî
---
You mean ST? Hell yes. I usually mainly play killer, but the Demogorgon seems so fun, and Im gonna be playing Nancy and Steve both alot too :)
---
THAT would be a freaky killer
---
They should double down and make him uglier. Maybe add a skin with a bag over his head.
---
Two leatherfaces on coms.  Oh, going to escape via a window?  Would be a shame if there was someone reving a chainsaw on the other side too.
---
This and hillbillys are pretty much the only way to double team that volume of survivors to keep chases short and apply pressure.  Even then I'd bet most or all survivors would escape.  
---
Unless you forgot to add more gates.  2 gates and 2 killers is just asking for a bad time.
---
Billy has a charge time, if he pulls out his chainsaw to deny you a window vault and forces you to take a different path, he has to wait till his charge goes down to 0 before he can move at full speed again.
---
Demo can do the same thing with his dash, but he can cancel it instantly and go back to full movement speed right away. Either way you take as survivor, you get hit.
---
To be fair, WGLF was their idea of a survivor equivalent. I just wish it had some sort of utility the way BBQ did, cause I mean, there just isn‚Äôt a point in running it rn unless you are specifically running a blood point farming build.
---
I used to hate them, but now I only hate the Game, I have nothing against Lery's because there are so many vaults.
---
It only works on Jeff.
---
You only get the Killer Instinct effect if the survivors are in a very small radius around your portal pads.
---
November 2016
---
You‚Äôre a great conversationalist.
---
NoOb3 looks like Daniel Radcliffe had a younger not so famous brother.
---
If I'm able to down and hook somebody in the time it takes for me to pick the other person up, the perk is too long. It's main purpose is to stop tunneling. I didn't tunnel. Maybe it should deactivate if killer guys a hook when they are downed
---
Yeah i assume just all of them. Although, If there is no obsession then none of them has ds. DS is a huge buff to survivors but honestly i only see as gen speed being a problem. They can live for as long as they want but at least give us time to hunt in return
---
I think that‚Äôs based on perspective. Killer games are generally my calm down games honestly. I mean, sure, I get stressful games on both sides, but that‚Äôs kinda the nature of the game. The most stressful part about survivor isn‚Äôt even the killer tho IMHO, it‚Äôs the other survivors. You never know what kind of dumb shit they‚Äôll pull.
---
That's fair. My main gripe is how the perk goes above and beyond it's purpose. If I didn't tunnel, it should go off. Why should I get punished for the survivors being bad?
---
but i have my lunch in my toolbox my snacks :&lt;
---
GET IT DONE
---
The point of people saying Rankings means nothing is basically them saying i have been rank 1 50 times and its boring
---
Thank you Mr. Grammar Nazi!
---
I replied to someone else about the weapon and How it‚Äôs supposed to tie into the lore but also I i like to imagine that these wires are constraining him and that maybe one of his menu fidgets would be him digging the sickle into the wires and trying to pull them off but of course, no luck
---
That‚Äôs not a imaginary horror. It is a real horror.
---
Seems Kate visited ram ranch
---
I thought he meant the other kind of hooker
---
Tunneling underground isnt new?
---
If you're showering. you're not gaming
---
Why is this nsfw? It's a shirtless guy, not a gay voregy (vore orgy)
---
It is but my point is that its teleportation and we have like 3 other killers that do that
---
The Solver Squad but it's random people on the street and they already know the script (hence smiling awkwardly)
---
Ahh well you can play it as..  "you know what im too good at the game, im gonna let you get a second life  and also a 5 second head start". But yeah ds is the strongest perk and is just a direct buff for survivors
---
Ofc its a different type of teleportation but you get my points its been done before
---
Shred is so bad. I feel like the Demogorgon as a base killer with the current setup is a GREAT idea, its just executed so weakly.
---
Everyone could annihilate legion
---
But also to be fair a flashlight can‚Äôt just end a killers game like a mori (except cypress) it just sucks getting 800 BPS because I got moried as a solo
---
Choo choo
---
Paid only
---
lol
---
Thanks I hate it
---
My guess is he is trying to rank up and still has problems controlling gen progression
---
Imo you should use the dash all the time cause it doesn't take long to charge so you can quickly get an early hit and not go through pallets.
---
Googly eyes cosmetic should be available for all killers
---
Its the black guy thats dies first not the black girl.
---
For sealing portals too? Because i know the bar is red for repairing generators together, and was rather confused this seemed to be different
---
Why don‚Äôt they just make the PTB play like Custom Game? Where you have all perks and everything to test as much as possible.  Progress doesnt carry over anyway.
---
Decide what is worth more:
---
Giving that guy a 'fuck you' by making them waste a shitton of their time and DCing after a long time, or;
---
Eating the loss and suffering defeat.
---
You‚Äôre probably downing everybody within 60sec one after another. The DS timer is fine how it currently is.
---
Dude, it happens to me daily trying to learn Nurse with that crappy console sensibility. You have to do 2 things, block every message except from friends and focus on getting better with u your blinks, not to the outcome of the match
---
After that you can focus on making their matches miserable. I'm still learning but slug them all after they spammed flashlight click thinking "another trash nurse" feels so god damn good, even if you got bullied for several matches before since you still learning
---
Keep it up and ignore them until you get good and show them to never think it's a free match when they hear nurse's scream
---
There was one kill by the demo dogs, they just like bit him over and over though, nothing too special
---
New plan, let's send ten times as many requests to Warner Bros. Pictures and see if they listen.
---
When working generators together you get -10% base speed per other person working on it.
---
(Hence why prove thyself makes it white again with 2 people on generator, as the +10% cancels it out)
---
Definitely no. The lunge may be  strong(probably will get nerfed only slightly as it isn't so op it's busted but op.) but requires some effort while spirits just oh lemme bump into a survivor then smack them
---
He will be very hard to play because of the portals.
---
Top 10 photos taken before disaster
---
I'm confused as to what you're implying here. I'm downing the DS user, chasing, downing, and hooking somebody else and STILL getting hit by Ds. That's not fine
---
Time to main survivor
---
That's why Calm Spirit is here
---
I don‚Äôt really have a problem with the way servers are now
---
assuming it's a double BP weekend, I'd imagine the weekend.
---
Did that actually hit anyone ?
---
Sneak -100
---
Yea but would a second more really really hurt it that badly? It forces you to use it smartly and not use it all the damn time. The shred should be situational sometimes it shouldn't just be allow me just to not M1 and just spam shred
---
They did something like that with left 4 dead buuuut BHVR isn't Valve
---
The killer itself is fine besides some minor adjustments I think he should get.
---
The add ons are pretty underwhelming all things considered, but that's fine. I don't want another situation billy has where their base power is strong and balanced but with add ons it becomes op.
---
Survivors being salty again smh
---
That's okay, thank you mate
---
I personally hate inside maps, but they add variety and have their own distinct features.  I don‚Äôt like them, but I understand their existence.
---
You can report this sort of thing to the police
---
So basically Billy Idol in that cyberpunk music video?
---
Yes they are, Ohm uploaded a video around and hour or two playing with them at similar ranks
---
My guess is he was being face camped, and his teammates left because they couldn‚Äôt safely get him. If he was hooked after his teammates had left, he‚Äôd have died instantly.
---
Probs the best Huntress fan art I‚Äôve ever seen
---
From what I've seen, it just looks like a DLA nurse. Like, has big lunge, so does nurse, except bigger and can ignore pallets and windows. The portal thing is just like nurse going through walls when you boil it down, and with nurse ya don't have to visit a location to first travel there, not to mention your ability can't be sabo'd, unlike demo. At least the demo looks cool and has nice sound effects.
---
Sounds really nice. with all that it makes sense.
---
Aight uh, 32k points on Legion plus all iridescent is easy mode, they were my third adept, and i got max points using just the three perks and low tier add-ons
---
His power is old tinkerer instant windup hatchets on most maps. It's strong, just learn to use it.
---
He has about as much of a continuous map pressure like freddy does, but his tp at least isn't restricted to generators.
---
He's a better Huntress in almost every way. He's 115% ms, he has map wide teleportation, he doesn't have to reload at lockers, doesn't hum, his charge up is instant while Huntress' wind up is long.
---
He's basically a less efficient version of Billy with his ability. And we know how easy Billy is to dodge against those who know his ability. Contrary to your statement I've found pounce most useful in narrow, confined spaces. But with practice I'm sure he's more practicable in an open space.
---
&gt;  pig just puts traps on your head forcing you to do a jigsaw box 
---
If you don't use dash, you don't play Pig properly imo.
---
&gt; spirit is like wraith but faster and actually invisible
---
Maybe it's a question of playstyle, but for me Spirit and Wraith are quite different in play. I don't think of Spirit as "an upgraded Wraith"
---
THIS DESERVES MORE UPVOTES
---
I meant gens, my b.
---
Careful bro, your spine chill was lit up for like the first 10 seconds, I think the killer might have been looking at you.
---
I had no idea this was the case.
---
good to know OwO
---
wouldn't it be better the Artificial In samination?
---
anyway, good one.
---
And I think what makes the Chad "Chad" is that he isn't an asshole. He's just... Chad. Pure, unadulterated Chad.
---
Non confirmed, and Peanits has said not to get our hopes up until they announce one.
---
I play on PS4 all the time. Its usually 60 seconds to 5 minutes for a survivor match up, depending on the time of day. If you are playing around mid morning like I do (I work overnights) it's a longer wait time to find matches, but late afternoon and evening its a decently short wait time.
---
Soooo salty survivor mains don't like his last video..., I wonder why ...., I guess truth hurts th most :D
---
Just come back next year what could go wrong
---
I think it is a rumor though unless I'm mistaken. if it is true got to say seems sorta dumb of the devs since the PTB and all
---
 I mean the dash isnt really unique anymore because of the demogorgons shred where it's just Pigs but longer lunge distance and missed attack cooldown is shorter upon other things. But yea we probably have way different standards
---
I'm in Europe. Idk if the game is being played here
---
And Nurse blink strikes travel *much* further, go through walls/floors, and must be charged.
---
For example, spirit feels really different to any other killer, playing and playing against her. So that's one. Clown felt also kinda new. And then legion got released, and from there, no real innovation. Ghostface: a merge of myers and pig. Plague: a merge of clown and huntress and kinda pig. Demorgorgon: kinda a mix of hag and a one blink nurse.
---
I really get your points and am feeling with you. I hope the devs focus on innovation with the next killer...
---
1000% sure I'll buy it as fast as I can
---
Ok I'm curious is that his actual hand or what? I haven't watched the show at all only the movies so I'm completely confused
---
I thought you were referring to the " black guy dies first " stereotype of horror movies.
---
You'll get tunneled a lot. And camped. Low rank survivors have low rank killers that like to camp and tunnel a lot. I would get Kate and use Windows of Opportunity, Spine Chill, Dance with Me, and a perk of your choice until you can learn to loop them. It really helps with learning to escape the killer. Wait to start on a gen until you see someone get injured.
---
It entered the shadow realm
---
If this is on ps4, you usually only wait around 10-15 seconds to open a lobby. It sucks that killer queues are better than survivor queues, because they‚Äôll dodge lobbies whenever they feel like it and we have to stick with the ping
---
Ok well that's her main ability the lunge is a side ability kinda like Pigs. Nurse and demogorgons are way different plus the demogorgon attacks differently unlike his m1.
---
If your chances of survival are severely lessened by not running a perk,things need to change. And like I said, it's more than an anti tunneling perk whenever I don't tunnel and it still procs after I down another person. It's just another get out of jail free card that enables bad plays. That is how is it used by a majority of the player base, at least in red rank. If you're extremely easy to find and down after hook, you deserve to die because that's not even tunneling, that's just the survivor being bad.
---
Instead of gollum, he‚Äôs now sm√©agol.

Wait. I just realized that that's the guy from TF2... holy shit... a.k.a a very boring game bit a game my friends prioritizes over dbd...

#NancyMain
---
You did it wrong, the Netflix one is suppose to be bad.
---
At the end of the show he gets kind of a cybernetic hand that looks exactly like his real one but on his wrist you can see the inner workings of it
---
I have maybe 400 matches as survivor. 3 matches as killer. Sometimes I almoust start game as killer, but back up when my stress level starts to rise even before match has started.
---
Noone should complain about the new ds, it's in a really good spot rn. And you can count the time while slugging the guy if you are sure they have ds.
---
Can't you technically do it with add-ons if you time it right(like hit Someone while they're vaulting or drop a pallet breaking it and hit the person)? The hit radius is really big so I'd imagine it could do that maybe even through windows? Besides the other stuff obviously.
---
Oops, sorry I‚Äôll have to change that up.
---
Well that is what they're doing in this clip, but they're supposed to basically just throw enough dirt into it it can't be used anymore.
---
Your chances of survival are not severely lessened by not running DS. In fact, I almost never run it and manage to do just fine. 
---
You can use this same line of thinking for a **ton** of perks in the game. Being good or useful =/= nerf now
---
And there's also the blonde "valley" girl dies first too stereotype
---
_Souka._
---
And yet you can never be sure unless they make an obvious play
---
ehh, still a goblin
---
Ah that's interesting. Is there anything else that's different to the basic ash we got? Also I've seen a bunch of people complain it doesn't have a gray streak in his hair what's that about?
---
As a Piggy main.
---
Yes.
---
It was ruin, or devour. Killer had both. We just worked through the ruin and devour never activated.
---
Wtf is your rant about, you got stomped if im seeing correctly, what should the killer do? Not kill you?
---
Same. [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/czsn3w/unbreakable\_totem\_spot\_in\_hawkings\_lab\_map/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/czsn3w/unbreakable_totem_spot_in_hawkings_lab_map/)

Holy shit, what's "The Boulder" from again?
---
Delete this
---
But... They're already selling a Quentin character. Face is the only thing that's different
---
It still depends on the decision of the license holder more than BHVR tho. But BHVR should make a request first
---
No, that's wrong. You can't turn as a Demogorgon and it's actually shorter than full Pig's dash. I think it's faster, though.
---
Yea I saw that asylum Ash thing. So basically everyone's complaining that Ash doesn't have just a white streak in his hair in the set? Honestly that confuses me on why'd they even complaint about it
---
Human brain likes seeing patters. Especially faces. Especially where there are no faces.
---
Avatar the last airbender!
---
Thank god you don't have to get all of huntress' trophies, eh?
---
I know but I was more so saying it's way faster to charge and the speed at which the demogorgon lunges gives it technically more distance.
---
It's been too long (1 year) since I've watched that. Definitely the best cartoon in existence.
---
A TUNNEL TRAPPER WITH NOED AND BBQ AND CHILI. FUCKING WHY? I GET OFF THE HOOK, JUST TO GET RIGHT BACK ON BECAUSE MY TEAMMATES DIDN'T FUCKING RUN BORROWED TIME. WHAT'S WORSE IS I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DIED. HOW THE FUCK DOES THAT EVEN HAPPEN??????
---
Out of curiosity, how long have you been playing? Old DS was complete BS and even as a survivor main I refused to run it because of how kuch of a crutch it was. This version is fine now, sometimes I run it, sometimes I don't and I see the 60 pass very very often and it doesn't even feel that bad when I play killer either
---
Literally the same thing that happened to Freddy. Only R20s would think his shred ability is OP. He slows down to use it and it doesn't really help him in loops.
---
Just R20s running in a straight line away from gyms and never looking behind them, they're going to get "shredded" by this.
---
it's really not that hard to not tunnel. if you want to hit the just unhooked survivor be my guest, but if you can't not pick them up for 60 fucking seconds then I think ur just a tunneling bitch
---
Since nurse
---
You haven't played as Demogorgon then. It's not instantaneous and it does have recovery.
---
One idea I'd like is a killer similar to OG Freddy but more unique and less annoying. Something like SCP-106. Instead of being taken to a mirror "Dream dimension" you're taken to a completely unique, separate (Not part of the normal map) "Pocket Dimension" where you have to find a way out and slowly bleed out over time. Instead of having to kill you by 3-hook, he has to send you to the dimension enough times your bleedout bar finally runs out. 
---
Like we need a "No-Hook" killer. 
---
Another idea I saw many times was the Xenomorph. Replace the hooks with eggs and after being facehugged (Hooked enough times) you're on a death timer similar to bear traps where you get chestbursted.
---
Like IMHO there's still a few cool abilities they could do but they'd have to seriously impact the game to the point it could seriously fuck up balance. With a "No Hook" killer what if a survivor brought Deliverance, Slippery Meat, etc. since the perks would go to complete waste.
---
I don't tunnel. I down the survivor, if there's another person around, I will chase them, down them, hook them, and still get DS'd, but go off, kid
---
They are using the Unreal Engine. Ofcourse they could do it.
---
They're thinking of changing up left behind, it's changes are in the ptb right now
---
It takes 14 seconds to break a totem, and 8 seconds for Inner Strength to work. Even without factoring in the time it takes to find and get into a locker to heal and to escape a chase with just an injury, it's still slower than basic healing from another survivor which is 16 seconds. It can be done a total of 5 times tops, and that's playing optimally. It's not OP at all.
---
Well then you should know how much better it is in its current state and stop complaining. At least it's no longer "Hey you caught me fair and square? Lol now I get away for free before you can even get a hook."
---
Well to an extent I get it since it‚Äôs one of the more notable features of this look and Ash doesn‚Äôt really have much variety head wise besides for his P1 upper body. I haven‚Äôt seen much uproar about it but if people are doing more than just pointing out the lack of it and actually belittling this cosmetic then that‚Äôs stupid, I‚Äôm honestly just happy we‚Äôre getting more Ash cosmetics.
---
Just because something isn't as bad as before, doesn't mean it shouldn't be changed. Look at self care. That shit has gotten needed 3 times
---
Otz tried it you have to be so fucking precise or they can squeeze beside from it, it sucks
---
Killer is so fucking stress, survior is a lot   chill
---
Was this today or yesterday?
---
I have heard people talking about that but i have personally not felt it. I will propably play a few more games to feel it out
---
Not that i think killer needs more points but wouldnt killing the obsession make more since for the killer to get "obsession dead"? They're the one obsessed with you lol
---
Do you mean in the ptb or live game
---
Holy! 2 awards and 4k upvotes? That‚Äòs crazy! I‚Äòm happy I could make you guys laugh!
---
Yesterday, for some reason the actual live servers fot me have gone to shit too and for a lot of my friends in the past 2 weeks though, no clue why that is though
---
Here comes the trapper
---
That comment made my morning, my good sir.
---
Hopefully we also end up getting his knight outfit from of darkness
---
the face needs more blood on it, like I mean just look at the Demogorgon's mouth
---
The game is not dead, and you will find lobbies.
---
Eh I consider situational a coin flip meaning 50/50  it's good or bad but that's just me but currently I feel the timer need to be upped a little or the stun for missing needs to be a little bit longer nothing big but nothing little just in the middle. It just feel a slight tweak to the charge time miss attack cooldown would make it more risky but still great
---
I usually find games way faster as killer then I do survivor. I'm on PS4 too.
---
It's almost like he'd be a more popular character if he didn't look ugly as sin.
---
Also outfits.
---
Let's face it, there's literally 0 reason to play a character besides cosmetic or daily, since he ugly, not much reason to play him other than to scare the killer.
---
What I'm saying is, they are hurting their revenue by making him ugly. Look at how crazy people were for ash.
---
The Demogorgon was pretty much just as murdery in the show when it wasn't being starved so I doubt the entity really needed to do anything other than train it to hook survivors like you train a dog to shit outside
---
&gt; median level of performance
---
To be 100% fair here, median ‚â† average.
---
Ruin buff looking spicy
---
yeah i get that, i have a friend who is really bothered by other survivors, for me, i can laugh off, or at worst shake off, dumb plays by other survivors, but i can't do the same when i do poorly as killer and get shit on left and right. I just want to have fun
---
this \^ we need an equivalent that's actually good, also one that will proc as reliably as BBQ. you may not get a lot of unhooks, or it may be inoptimal for you to go for an unhook instead of another person
---
I have a solution.... stop tunneling. How does that sound?
---
i feel like the only time they don't disconnect is if they're just demolishing the survivors, so if we're winning and i get a shitton of bloodpoints they can just close their game and we all get 0 bloodpoints, and if im losing i get barely any. I don't think I've gone a day without at least 2 killer disconnects and sometimes i only play for like &lt; an hour, it sucks but i think it will get fixed with dedicated servers
---
Ghostface
---
I thought the mask was actually very eerie, the spray paint kind of look really makes it look great. Wazzup face and that mask is definitely on the wishlist.
---
Survivors still tbag, DC, and demand kills play their way.  
---
Killers still face camp and bully noob survivors on purpose.
---
Big open map make trapper main the big sad
---
That's tunneling. Downing somebody right after they get taken off the hook is tunneling. Which is fine but if you gonna whine about a DS just learn how to count to 60
---
Its cool
---
Steve is coming with Camaraderie so DS + Breakdown + Kindred + Camaraderie is the perfect counter to camping Killers
---
I like the sensory tank rooms, they look very similar to the flashbacks 11 has in S1.
---
Well damn. Maybe people just suck. I guess perhaps I had a lucky week playing.
---
&gt;without bugs
---
This is dead by daylight. You're never more than 10 feet from a ~~rat~~ bug.
---
And the moderators sayeth unto Abraham:  
---
"No, we want extremely bad and low effort memes to basically plague this sub."  
---
Probably.
---
Exactly what i mean
---
I feel as though saying this is becoming about as dead as the meme itself.
---
Lmao that's pretty cute
---
I made an Eleven outfit for Feng, so my friends will be playing as Stranger Things gang
---
Seeing people walk around I'm struck by how "real" it looks. Almost all other "everyday" maps (Haddonfield, Badham, The Game, and Crotus Penn to an extent) Didnt feel like real places. Which they weren't, they were crafted by the entity based off memories. But the Lab looks like a real lab, with proper dimensions and actual functionality. The small rooms upstairs, the narrow hallways, it all looks so normal that it's almost not a DBD map. I love it, cant wait to play ot.
---
everyone just tried to wake others up
---
*smacks a survivor after getting looped for a minute straight* REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Happy Cake Day
---
Legion's rework was, I think, was more intended to just bandaid him into a less cancerous state to play against than to buff him. Tbh Legion's current power probably should be scrapped and start again.
---
I honestly prefer the top one and I can't explain why but it blows my mind she doesn't have a proper hat yet. Cowgirl with no hat but Jake has a cowboy hat. Give it to us Bhvr. We need Cowgirl Kate
---
Yeah I have good weeks to but they always come back.
---
Except you can get dsd even if you aren't really tunneling the guy.
---
I've had a lot of situations where I ignored the unhook, chased and downed someone else, the guy with ds got healed under the hook and then ran to the hook, unhooked in my face and I grabbed him just to get stabbed.
---
Visual Update Please!
---
&gt;Also would be nice if the game had like a roll or dodge.
---
There is, it's called dead hard.
---
Thank you ^^

Wouldn't instadown so it's still not as scary as bubba
---
What like a perk from the blood tree or something. I mean in general for all survivors
---
I'm fine with the dash counting towards STBFL as long as the recovery from the succesful dash hit doesn't get affected. 
---
It should have normal recovery.
---
&gt;You said in the stream that you would be able to "turn a little bit" at the end of your Shred attack, but... you just can't.
---
The dash is strong enough to warrant not being to control it once you let go of the button. Being able to turn and aim it mid dash would make it pretty shitty to play against.
---
&gt; Pig could use the same change.
---
I actually like that STBFL doesnt work with pig dash. Her dash isn't nearly as useful as Demo's dash so you're not getting penalized in chase, but you CAN use the dash to damage the obsession. You aren't losing any stacks AND you don't have to avoid obsession. I see it as an absolute win.
---
From the developers who state multiple time that their code doesn't allow such an easy fix and that they'll have to implement big changes for it to work.
---
Why are people thinking they waited until they could do massive work on this to fix this if they could just check the "allow rejoin" box?
---
May be, however... 
---
If the game would be more gorey(or rather, had a toggle), the playerbase would rise by quite a lot. Specifically: You'd get way more of the horror crowd into the game. I mean, it is not that hard to do a little gore and create a cheap toggle - cause lets be honest, many things already look like they have been lazily censored.
---
**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; Repost
---
There's a reason it's a perk with a heavy cooldown. Because it would be way too op otherwise.
---
Only ultra crazy survivors &amp; mega noobs  will go for basements saves while bubba there.
---
But didn‚Äôt bhvr ‚Äöbought‚Äò the rights to his character? Otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt have Quentin &amp; Freddy?
---
Better than completely invisible pallets that you can't see as killer but survivors see perfectly fine. Had it happen to me once as hillbilly and boy was annoying.
---
I hope it helps :)
---
Who's Kate Denson
---
And that's why you don't t-bag at the exit gate kids
---
Are you aware that survivor are strong af in red ranks? Even dodging 1 hit may lead to other 3/4 loops making you lose ton of time. Basically you're turning dead hard as a normal mechanic of the game but without the invincibility. Genrush + the second chance meta + dodge system? Please don't.
---
Nah, i guess he just wanted to make sure, that you die on the hook before he breaks the pallet.
---
Will the real Steve Harrington please stand up?
---
Corrupt purge is less of her power, but more of a threat to keep survivors from cleansing.
---
Her real power is that everyone is exposed almost all the time and super easy to track
---
Wait really? Time to finally level my ghostface
---
Idk, have you played solo survivor vs decent spirit with purple add ons with all of your teammates doing nothing?
---
Literally haven't really seen anyone complain about it, just posts about people supposedly complaining.
---
Well done! Welcome to the club.
---
This bug *still* exists? I'm not sure what causes it, but this happened to me for the first time like two months ago, and it apparently happens to a shitload of people. Idk why they haven't fixed it by now
---
Best view you can get while waiting for the lobby.
---
Is the outfit really called Progamer or is it supposed to be Pro Gamer? Because I read it as programmer at first and was really confused
---
But that's the same as people who click their flashlight, teabagging or repeatedly vaulting shit to get your attention. It's just them taunting you. The best way to counter that is to slug because that's not fun for them or ignore them when they jump in a locker because then they don't get to use the perk they want to use. It's literally that easy to counter. There's potentially another 3 people who you could be chasing. It's 60 seconds. Be productive instead of getting annoyed at taunting and BM's because that's just giving them what they want.
---
Not fake just never confirmed
---
And what do you say? Will there be a double bps starting today?

It was changed because cruel confinement refers to animal and prisoner abuse. So yeahhh, we're gonna avoid that very real tragedy.

People seriously dont think that this is rather overpowered?

Quick transportation, complete lockdown and immeditate detection and ability to attack.

Watch as people disconnect everytime they're the last player against a Demogogo.
---
Don't worry brotherman I'm still playing steve
---
Agreed, It sounds more catchy
---
it cpuld be billy in there lol
---
I think it is that they already knew he was a face camper since they have played a whole game with him, and he would have gotten a few other hooks.
---
(grunts) what are you going to fo to me?
---
Q&amp;Q is fine on it's own but absolutely terrific in synergies. My favourites:
---
1. Q&amp;Q + Lithe + Dance with me + Iron Will
---
2. Q&amp;Q + Head On + Dance with me + Iron Will
---
The second one requires more complex input but renders you almost godlike when it comes to breaking the chases or escaping tough situations.
---
I don't use these very often because you know, meta: Unbreakable, BT, DS. But when I do and it works it feels absolutely terrific.
---
[Here you go](https://youtu.be/Z62b6KsdC14)

Someone posted a video of the skill check slowed down, its always like that.
---
He is very balanced
---
Ahh thank you thats not bad actually
---
Didnt read the post, mate?
---
My choice is that you're dying on that hook
---
I have just been reading the comments and have been disgusted by the survivor players up here defending their right to hit ds in situations where an antitunnel perk should never work
---
You all motherfuckers talk like OH OLD DS WAS WAY WORSE but forget about when they changed it so only the obsession could actually make use of it, not a single one of you actually mentions how it was an underpowered niche perk that could be countered even more by enduring in the state it was back then
---
Yet most of you keep defending ds like it is a god blessing against that bad bad tunneling killers
---
Is ds overpowered? No it isn't
---
Does it not match its intended identity the devs wanted to give this perk after his rework? Yes, it fuckin doesnt - it rewards bad gameplay on survivors part
---
But Hey lets all jump on another post when survivors will hop on the "lets nerf noed cause it rewards bad killers" topic - that would be so much fun
---
Also op i have been upvoting you, i hate irrational downvoting that doesnt lead to any meaningful arguments
---
Just learn to land greats. It's not that hard, even on 10fps. Just make sure to adjust for your input delay and don't look directly at the arrow (estimate its movement instead)
---
It doesn't have transferred progress. Not sure about the release date
---
bruh steve and nancy always be moaning
---
start taping in sync with them for ultimate big brain gains
---
Seconds lasted and percentage values are all changeable. I'd be the first to acknowledge I'm not good at balancing that aspect of Perk design. This was more to show some concepts off than 'This should totally be in teh game!'.
---
Me too
---
Makes me sad. Thanks for the reply tho!
---
With ruin, there's a penalty and your brain doesn't like those.
---
Without it, there's a small reward. Your brain almost doesn't care about those
---
So if you weren't using those perks then you were already using dead hard and borrowed time.
---
Nurse blink strike doesnt benefit from stbfl

---
Welcome to DBD! It‚Äôs horrible here.
---
When we all thought The Clown would be a Ringmaster way back when I thought that Kate would be some sort of circus performer, maybe an acrobat of some kind. I thought up the Contortionist idea back then and I genuinely wonder if hiding inside item chests hasn't at least been floated at the design session at Behaviour.
---
Personally my favorites are Hex: Paranoia for Killers and Contortionist for Survivors.
---
it'll always look like that. You have to stop looking at each frame of that and estimate its speed
---
also, make sure to press a bit earlier (input delay)
---
Except the nurse has a cooldown on her blink and has a longer charge
---
I play in the US, games are easy to find as both survivor and killer. My friend from the UK is the same
---
It‚Äôs not just SWF, it‚Äôs matchmaking in general. I usually queue with another rank 1 and sometimes we literally get 2 ranks 14-20 teammates.
---
If this happens I might actually level up Quintin.
---
I cant see names of outfit.. i just guess, if u zoom in on her id card it says gamers only.. so i put that title there.. i cant edit title and grammar isnt my strongest suit :P
---
Gonna have to beg to differ on these examples
---
I've always thought it makes the game far more interesting to have Perks that are situation but strong rather than applicable all/most of the time but "balanced".
---
I already see nigh on every Killer running BBQ&amp;Chilli and every Survivor with Self-Care. The Meta is there because those sort of Perks are objectively the best pick but with everyone choosing the same Perks the game gets very samey.
---
I'd much rather see the Meta broken up to increase the variety of Perks people use. It'd make the game so much more interesting.
---
Also, all the time and percentage numbers in the above Perks are obviously wrong. I am not good with balancing that aspect of design. Look past the raw numbers to the ideas behind the Perks themselves.
---
I mean, the killer won‚Äôt time the perfect moment to kill you all. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è If they catch all the survivors after 3-4 minutes, so be it.
---
Can confirm.  The exact same happened to me yesterday.
---
CRONTCH
---
Yeah, the demogorgon yanks it like it's supposed to be ripped off. It's really weird that it stays in place after that.
---
Big CrONcH
---
I only saw this totem thru True's stream. But i had never seen it like that. He ran past it but he was gettin chased. But it looked weird.
---
So why is them "getting value" out of a perk a bad thing? Because it doesn't suit you? It's 60 seconds. And even then they aren't getting the full value of the perk or the points for using it. 
---
You said "They can run into you" if they are "running into you" then they aren't in a locker and can be hit and slugged. As for jumping in a locker, that is why I gave you an option for both. You can ingore them and go hunt someone else and apply pressure to gens but if them being in a locker bothers you so much then pull them out, take the stun, then they can't use DS once it's gone. Simple. hell, they might even miss it. It happens. 
---
I play killer and survivor and if I get hit by DS then so be it, my bad for going after someone within 60 seconds of them being unhooked when I could have gone after other people. Imagine getting so worked up over a few second stun...
---
Ow that is cool just wanted to rant and give my   Idears.
---
Claudete was the killer this whole time!
---
Nurse has to charge and has an actual cooldown when she misses
---
Most of what everyone else said. Ducking in corners works or just crouching behind a tree the fov on killers is very limited and take advantage I've juked so many ppl just ducking into a corner.

---
I've been thinking that maybe while on the hook, the emote keys (on PC 1 and 2) could be used to signal something like this. Alas for now the best we have is running kindred if you're not in a SWF :(
---
I agree. 
---
There have been many many times where I‚Äôd message my teammates not to come get me and just do gens when I‚Äôm getting face camped by a bubba.
---
Or the survivor was the cocky one, who didn‚Äôt leave through the exit gate but wanted the hatch.  
---
That‚Äôs when he got downed.  
---
After all, he knew exactly where it was and he was hooked close to it.
---
Exactly I was think for when you‚Äôre hooked (for pc) the animations could change for 1 to be come here and 2 be don‚Äôt unhook me.
---
I regularly play with my american friend on american servers (I'm australian). I typically have at least 250 ping and I've gotta say I never have the problems that you say you're experiencing. The worst I get in the average game is unfair hits or vaults but besides that nothing really. And if you're having serious issues at 160 ping on your own server then clearly something is wrong somewhere but it definitely isnt the games connection imo.
---
I had a stroke trying to read this
---
hooooolllyyyyy that looks trippy.... nice jukes
---
Took me a second, didn't notice the sub...
---
I only tested for 3-4 games. Queue times were long.
---
But thats how i felt. But it needs further testing
---
Or when your teammate tries to go in for a save while the killer is by you and when the killer hits, you end up getting downed again and now in struggle stage when you weren‚Äôt even close to it. I‚Äôve been through this and accidentally caused this to others I wish hooked survivors could just say don‚Äôt come.
---
So what that you know they have it? They are in the locker, if you grab them they stab you. 
---
You can't "down them and leave them on the floor", unless you wait by the locker for a minute, you just have to let them go. You can't do anything about it.
---
No it's a new perk obsessed basment camper for every single time you hook a survivor in the basement you earn a token if someone is all ready in your grasp spend a token to pick up one more survivor but the second survivor must go in the basement you may not attck will you hold two survivors 
---
           "It's so quick and easy to fool with prey" Random notes
---
Honestly it would be a great way to balance the solo/SWF imbalance that is currently in the game. Try suggesting this on the dead by daylight forums [here](http://forum.deadbydaylight.com/) to hopefully get the attention of more of the community and dbd staff
---
As long as demogordon doesn‚Äôt get nerfed then he‚Äôs up with Freddy
---
&gt;Unpopular opinion:ptb is to test new perks and killer power and counters. Not to troll
---
PTB is not a showcase of new content even though 99% of people treat it like it.
---
Public / Player Test **BUILD**. Older perks, mechanics, killers and environment have also been changed and requiring testing. Nurse is a huge example because more often than not, her blinks start getting stuck in some invisible prop in older maps like it used to be on Lery's, The Game and has been present for quite a while on Blood Lodge (still not fixed).
---
This mindset that if you are not testing the new content I am going to DC is plain wrong. 
---
Additionally, like someone already said it, playing the game as normal as you can is the best way to get a real understand of how weak or strong the new killer and all the new 9 perks are. 
---
If you are going to the PTB just to check how the characters look and how the mori is while bitching that survivors are "gen rushing", don't bother.
---
If by "news" you mean "rumors"...
---
There was never an official announcement about DBP event at the start of September
---
They shouldn't do that because then all you're doing is getting extra bp for survivors which doesn't make sense and you're doing the same thing but with aura reading for killer and that would be too strong for just a base kit. It makes sense to keep it as a perk, they're the only one that have affects outside of the trial
---
For me it seems like your character either is Trevor-like or Michael-like. No in between like where Nea would be.
---
lmao
---
There is something you can do about it though. Go chase someone else who hasn't just gotten off a hook within the last 60 seconds. It is that simple. You seem to be ignoring that as an option. 
---
It's kinda like when I see a survivor running me to an area where there isn't any gens. I just ignore them and go apply pressure to gens. It's the same prinicple, if the DS user is running to a locker and you can't reach them, go apply pressure to gens. More often than not by the next time you come across them it's ran out. If they are on the gen then pull them off and let them use DS, then they are no longer on the gen and their DS is gone.
---
Check Nancy lol
---
What's this lawsuit?
---
Chasing people who aren‚Äôt being productive isn‚Äôt really pressure. Pressure is keeping survivors busy, interrupting them and distracting them from their objective. If you chase the guy who just got unhooked you‚Äôre not applying pressure, especially if he has DS, since the others are free to do what they like.
---
Okay I will thank you~!
---
DM me and I will give you the whole pack
---
another person who thinks its a me issue......Everything is clear on my end, havent had a single internet issue in 3 years, nothing is blocked by my ISP nothing, 160 ping is near unplayable, game is on an SSD, i have 100down speed with 0 slowdown ever, the issue literally can not be me related in any way but okay.
---
No One Escapes Spirit
---
Ash too
---
True lol
---
Replying to your edits. I have played against plenty of competent survivors, and I am a comepetent survivor myself. Yes it can be impactful, I never said it wasn't impactful but there is no blanket way for it to play out. Map pressure is exactly what I am talking about applying right now. You can also do that by aplying pressure to those survivors working on gens, not jumping in and out of lockers. Also tunnelling one survivor is generally a very bad way to apply map pressure. You waste so much time on 1 person, what do you think the others are doing? Gens. With no pressure.
---
I never said assume they will mess up, I said it's posslbe, even by those who are good. I wasn't giving an argument, I was giving an example of one of the many ways games and situations can play out. For you it's very much "Oh they'll jump in a locker and use DS then I lose the game" I'm saying that other situations do happen. I have seen DS come in clutch and sometimes prevent a kill but I've very rarely seen it turn an entire game around. If DS has cost an entire game then I'm sorry to say you weren't playing well enough to begin with.
---
Then just wait till they come out or the minute is over, or just take the DS. There is nothing more you can do ;)
---
Actually, MEGAN, I can't sit anywhere...

I feel freddy and the top 3 are all still stronger. Hes in a good good place though. The counter to his lunge is the counter to everything! Dont be caught in the open. People will adjust
---
We'll get one, just not anytime soon.
---
&gt;Go chase someone else who hasn't just gotten off a hook within the last 60 seconds.
---
&gt; if the DS user is running to a locker and you can't reach them, go apply pressure to gens.
---
You are ignoring the fact that said survivor won't just sit in that locker all day, the moment you go away they will get on a generator. I said like 3 times now that the guy who's going to the locker can be doing a gen that is close to it. So you either give up a gen or eat the stun. 
---
&gt; If they are on the gen then pull them off and let them use DS, then they are no longer on the gen and their DS is gone.
---
"The way you play around their escape is to let them use their escape and then they won't have it again in the future." That's not counterplay, it's directly eating the effect.
---
They have no hitbox for the survivors head. Their entire body has a single hitbox. It‚Äôs impossible for body locations to have different effects
---
It was even mentioned in the guides (written by users) on Steam. Have a convention instead of a technical solution.

We really need another strong killer. I hope they let him be strong.

Playing against nurse is a completely different game from any other killer
---

---
The guides don't really matter. It's about being the change that you want to see instead of asking for a technical solution. This isn't even hard. Don't save people who spam unhook in one game and explain it afterwards. It'll spread again.
---
I never said they will sit in the locker. What do you think the other (potentially) 3 survivors are doing? Gens. I'm not saying ignore them and go play with yourself in a corner. I'm saying you can go chase someone else off another gen. Either way someone is going to be on a gen. It's down to you who that is but you can be chasing someone who doesn't have DS to fall back on at that point, meaning when you get back to DS user it's gone. Why could you not figure that much out for yourself? 
---
Yeah, eating the stun whilst getting them off the gen and using up their perk. It's about being smart and deciding what is the best thing to do in that situation. You maybe need to stop focusing so hard on one perk and on the match as a whole.
---
If a survivor cleanses a portal do you get it back?
---
Which is precisely my argument, you can't do anything about them besides completely giving up the chase or letting them use the escape.
---
A tunneling perk is supposed to prevent you from getting hooked again, not make you immune to getting downed for 60 seconds.
---
Omg I love it xD. Looks like yearbook pictures üòÇ

You do realize the request was likely made (and shot down) when they first purchased the rights to the licenses when they first made the chapter? New Line is VERY finicky with the rights to ANY Nightmare on Elm Street content.

I have recently been wanting an option to ‚Äúhold shift if you don‚Äôt want to be unhooked‚Äù option. I could see the situations where that would be detrimental to the team, somewhat unlike not wanting to be healed. It just pisses me off when I don‚Äôt have DS and a teammate farms me

Thank you for trying it is appreciated. I was unable to find the deleted post. Man that sub is fucked lol

Why is everyone throwing the word OP around, is it the new ''literally'' of this sub?
---
He is one of the most fun killers. He is definitely not op
---
But I thought Nurse was super broken and so easy to use?  A guaranteed 4k?  Remember your buddy who 4k'd against 4 rank 1 survivors his first time playing Nurse?
---
Of course God tier Nurses are amazing, god tier of any killer is pretty much unbeatable.  That's what makes them god tier.  The original thing we were talking about is that you said Nurse is super easy to learn and so crazy broken that anyone can just destroy survivors with her.  Well, you just admitted that's not true.  Thanks for finally seeing it my way.
---
I do, but they probably didn't have the actual actor's will back then. Now they can add his will into equation

The script writer for the original Friday the 13th movie hasn't recoeved royalties for all these decades. He was hesitant about suing for a very long time because he didn't want to hurt the fan base or franchise in any way but now he's in a full lawsuit over it. I guess he's had enough. So the lawsuit is still ongoing but a cease and desist was put out over everything with the 'Camp Crystal Lake', 'Pamala Vorhees', 'Jason Voheese', and 'Friday the 13th' name, image, and all associated items. Unfortunately, because of this, F13 the game was caught in the cross fire and could not add any more content to the game. That game studio has to move on to other content for money so other than a few bug fixing patches the game had to be abandoned.
---
He's so disgustingly greasy. There should be lots of zits and pumps on his face.
---
How much is it going to cost for the whole dlc
---
No, not at all. Wraith was strong and unfun to play against, but you could still win if you played well, if he played perfect, since he started so weak.
---
That‚Äôs fair, when this skin was first data mined I didn‚Äôt like it that much but it grew on me.

---

---
It makes me very sad because I both think low settings looks best and I can only play on low settings without lag. They already made my favorite Meg cosmetic hair look tragic and now all hair looks terrible. For fucks sake, not everyone can afford a new PC every year and us plebs with low end PCs are people too. It doesn't even need to look like that, it's a deliberate choice by bhvr to change it without consideration of how it looks, even for auric cells only cosmetics.They charge 4 euro per piece for those you can't tell me its not OK to be annoyed.
---
This sub is often the perpetrator of bad balance decisions, not the other way around. You have people that still try to excuse Nurses existence, or decisive strikes existence, the nerfs to freddy so on and so forth. Not that its exclusively bad or anything, but man people will fight so emotionally on this sub to protect overpowered shit its unreal.
---
Well, now i can't unsee it. Thanks.
---
the portals seem great. I feel like you could do lots of mindgames by hiding them. Like someone is looping a killer shack and you place a portal down and teleport to the one you placed in the basement prior and catch them off guard. Stuff like that.
---
Map pressure too obviously.
---
The devs won‚Äôt alow it cuz the game would be banned in some places if the head were removed.
---
Then get the timing down
---
They make the game scarier.
---
Shirtless Myers or get out tbh.
---
The point is that it's a toss up. Often times the people who only play survivor or only killer are oddly vocal while simultaneously understanding the game minimally.
---

You can counter Dead Hard in the following situations:
---
(1)  You catch the survivor in a bad position and there's no safety around.  You just bait out the DH and then hit them.  Sure, no problem there.
---
(2)  If the killer is right up behind the survivor, and I mean right on that ass, then the killer lunge animation is longer than the DH iframes.  So if the survivor DH's directly forward, the killer can hold their lunge through the DH animation and still hit.  But again, that only works when the killer is directly behind the survivor, like the models are touching.  
---
Obviously, in these situations, DH is a totally fair, balanced, counterable perk.  My problem with DH is that in a looping situation where the killer is just barely in lunge distance, DH becomes completely unfair and has no counterplay.  If the survivor gets greedy and takes an extra loop that lets the killer get into lunge distance?  Time to DH to the pallet.  What can the killer do?  If the killer lunges, it's a miss because DH.  If the killer holds their lunge, the survivor still just makes it to the pallet and is safe.  
---
I think that situation is completely awful and really bad for the health of the game.  It's really frustrating to do everything right as a killer, try to capitalize on a survivor mistake, and then get punished anyway because oops, Dead Hard!  
---
It's the same reason I dislike NOED, because it really sucks as a survivor to feel like you played the game well, got the doors powered, you're gonna survive!  Here comes the killer, whatever, the door is almost opened anyway.  I'll take a hit to protect the guy opening the door....oh....NOED.  That's a really awful feeling.  And yes, NOED has counters, but it still feels really bad to get hit by NOED, same as it feels really bad to have a chase get extended  by DH where there was no chance to counter.

---
It doesnt do it all the time, but people will go to the fucking mat to protect survivors from getting nerfed and it's been like that since the game came out. There has always been a group of self motivated survivor mains who purposely downvote, lie, gaslight and obfuscate to try and protect their role so they can continue to bully killers. I've literally argued with people trying to claim they understand stats and have absolutely no understand of why survivors are broken by the numbers and even the devs stats show it. In the same conversations they even attempted to convince me that some of the summation of two averages can somehow become lower than the lowest of the two averages, which violates a law of mathematics. The emotional attachment people have to protecting their "side" in this game is insane, and warrants it's own case study for developers as how to identify bad takes from the community a la freddy original nerfs.

So just to be clear in your opinion you want easier loops, lower height objects so you can see the killer removing mind games and finally easier/safer vaults??? 
---
Well In my opinion you're a little bitch.

I like the vault on the new map with the shelf and the two sets of stairs, but every streamer is already complaining about it being too toxic.

Look at the subs top post
---
My type of boy
---
&gt;Do you ever thought i said that every player that uses nurse 4k like ever? Looool wtf. I mean actually good players using it.
---
You literally said Nurse is a guaranteed 4k.  And you never said anything about "guaranteed 4k....for people with 2000 hours in the game and are already amazing at everything, but just somehow haven't played Nurse yet."  You just said Nurse is broken.  You're moving the goalposts now because you've admitted that your original premise is wrong.
---
Also, you understand that if using her well requires 2k+ hours and 3 years of experience in the game, then she's not broken, right?  Like, the amount of people who play this game that have that many hours and that much experience is less than 10% of the playerbase, maybe less than 5%.  It's kinda insane to say that a killer is imbalanced and broken *if you achieve a level of experience that 90% of players will never achieve.*
---
&gt;It's just insane to me that anyone says remotely anything like this after the original freddy nerfs.
---
Who exactly is asking for freddy tier nerfs? I clearly said adjustments. Just because i don't think the killer is perfect on arrival doesn't mean I want him gutted, stop assuming things I didn't even say.
---
Lots of maps have heaps of those pallets now. You pretty much have to get the stun or you die. Lots of strong vaults becoming forced slow vaults as well with new boxes or tires and objects appearing right beside the windows.
---
Finally... Salvation

I kind of hope we get to keep crackhead goblin as an alternate head cosmetic. It would feel kind of weird to have him just disappear.

That doesn't work at all, but regardless, assuming it did - devoting man hours and resources into a project you know will end up in a legal battle isn't the most prudent business move, even in Canadia.

It's a Map addon. You can put a beacon down to show your teammates what gen you're working on.

4x - 6x BP would do the trick tbh
---
It'd be very nice to also test the new bloodwebs and unlock stuff to try
---
And while they're at it they should add Robert Englunds' Freddy!
---
There should be a secondary component to the lunge that gives the player more control on what they hit, like pressing M2 while lunging would cause the demogorgon to 'swipe' in a 180-ish arc in front of it, stopping the lunge but triggering an extra long recovery if you miss.  
---
  
---
This would make good killers have more control on preventing jukes 
---
and hitting right around corners, at the risk of losing more time though.
---
We did it boys, next target - Jamie Lee Curtis.
---
Not to mention, even if a survivor is camping inside of a droppable pallet, they can easily bait it out (or just get the hit if they aren't quick enough)
---
Man. I'm not the only one saying this. A lot of streamers are saying this killer is bad. For example, watch "zeb89" stream of yesterday night (even if you're english and you don't know italian). He tried to attack with the M2 and he had to be a fukin sniper to hit a survivor. The hitboxes are fucked up.
---
I really hate when that happens. I had someone saying they recorded the match and reported me for lag switching and I'm just sitting here like "wtf is going on?"
---

&gt;Like, the amount of people who play this game that have that many hours and that much experience is less than 10% of the playerbase, maybe less than 5%.  It's kinda insane to say that a killer is imbalanced and broken   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;if you achieve a level of experience that 90% of players will never achieve.
---
 first of all, i never said this, you are twisting what i said to your benefit. i never said she took 2k hours and 3 years, i mentioned that for my friend which you are refusing to belive. you CAN do pretty well with her with much less experience, hence the easy and broken. but if it's powerful for even less experienced player, you can imagine what a 5kh player do with her.
---
so you are just admitting to everything i said before. there are levels to this, the thing is, you dont experience this, whereas I only play with and against those players. within your reality it's 'kinda insane' because you dont face those, only the idea thats less than 5% tells a lot for me honestly , if you ONLY faced those, you would share the same opinion, but i do doubt you have experience as survivor enough to knonw what it feels like , if you  were consistent rank 1 survivor you'd face regurlarly the likes of Gammalunatic's nurse, Zubat's nurse, tru3's nurse, and even better nurses which would make you feel the same way. Broken, unbalanced, in desperate need of a rework.

If you're inciting a killer to camp you by teabagging and pointing then that's your fault and I don't hold that shit against killers cos it's annoying af. If they're just a shit killer then think about it like this. They're staring at you for 2mins not patrolling gens, protecting totems or stopping your team from opening the gates so they're losing bp every second and pissing off the royal demon facehugger in the sky. Sandbagging and farming should have penalties for the survivor doing it tbh but there's no way to implement that outside of maybe an unsafehook penalty?

---
I think killers shouldn't get penalised for being hit by it when there's nothing you can do to counter it
---
Depends on what playstyle you enjoy most. If you like stall games then go for pig or Plague. Plague has a lot more stall potential than piggy does since you can just vomit on everything all the time. She can kinda work around loops to get them in the injured state but her fountains make it easy for the survivors to heal fast. If you like Stealth then go for Michael or Ghost Face. They each have their own unique playstyle that's a lot of fun if you like the slower games. If you like to keep your opponent in a constant fear that you will appear at any second with no warning, then I would go for Spirit or Hag. Spirit can mind game better than the hag, but the hag can apply more map pressure with her traps. Legion is also fun but they're basically an M1 killer. His perk discordance is really good on Freddy and Spirit though.

I mean... do you see hook progress bar? Maybe OP's teammates left in a fear because of Bloodwarden and OP took this clip immediately after so killer didn't even have time to close the hatch?

No release date it. It could be in one week or it couldn't. There is no guarantees until they announce it officially.
---
so its boring to not be able to run the same safe loop for 3 minutes? good to know
---
Based on Samination
---
Sucks to suck

OPEN UP THIS PIT!

---
Prayer beads Spirit is only as toxic as the DS, Self Care, Borrowed Time, and Flashlight carrying, hook farming Neas out there. Hes upset about them DCing when they saw Spirit.
---
And? That doesn't mean Demo's lunge with no charge time or fatigue isn't busted
---
My name is Meg Thomas, and I am the fastest woman alive.
---
Got a good laugh this morning while I was listening to relaxing video game music on Spotify. Thought some of you would enjoy.
---
Have you gotten effective use out of them? The only one that seems any bit useful is Second Wind but it's single use and can be completely negated by just going back down before it finishes.
---
I'm just curious if they are somewhat usable.
---
Spirit Main here. Next time bring an Ebony Mori and show them what toxicity is lol
---
I don‚Äôt play enough for those numbers XD
---
I just enjoy the game. Plus I suck as a killer so I miss out on a few dailies.
---
Reading this made Me want to die even more than usual
---
They are but as i said they are made for risky playstyles. Ive been using nothing but his three perks since i havent gotten him to level 15 yet and i get way more use out of them over nancys.
---
1 player left in the game and he's on hook with the possibility of escape. No teammates left to rescue, and he didn't die instantly, which means they left him there. What's the killer supposed to do? Go look for a single pallet to break in the meantime? He's for SURE going to try and escape hook.
---
That's just their new throwing knife add on. Read the patch notes.
---
No, it actually takes the same time
---
Play each character until level 40 at least to get all the teachable perks. Spine chill is a great perk against the stealthy killers.
---
I guess it's because like a "NICE JOB! YOU FUCKED OVER THEIR STBFL/PWYF/DYING LIGHT!" bonus. 
---
Or maybe it's because I tunneled them cause they were a toxic OoO teabagging flashlight clicking POS. Either way I find it kinda funny. 
---
I think we should just get a "Stylish Death" bonus for being Mori'd.
---
YOU CLEARLY DONT PLAY KILLER AT A VERY HIGH RANK, IT MAKES NO FUCKING ODDS TO PURPLES AND ABOVE IF THERE IS A RUIN, GETTING A 4K WITHOUT IT IS POSSIBLE BUT FUCKING STRESSFUL, RUN SMALL GAME IF IT BOTHERS YOU THAT MUCH AND BREAK THE TOTEM. RUIN MAKES IT SO THE KILLER CAN CHASE WITHOUT 3 GENS GOING OFF DURING THAT ONE CHASE. PLAYING WITHOUT IT IS SUICIDE AT HIGH RANKS.
---
He still did BM
---
This... isn't just hitboxes.
---
Even though Billy's chainsaw detection is kinda messed up since they tried to get rid of false chainsaws, this was 90% ping.
---
Nobody knows the exact date, typically 1-2 weeks after the ptb
---
I checked the video. The comment posted by this guy last year, with 1k upvotes and 7 replies has nothing today with Stranger Things.
---
I swear this subreddit has to be 90% thirsty gay teenagers. It's crazy how much obsession there is on Steve and shirtless Myers.
---
&gt;Plus some of them have high walls so you can get mind gamed very easily.
---
That's not killer-sided though.  If the killer can mindgame you because of high walls, it also means you can mindgame them.
---
To be honest, that game was pretty laggy for me and my friend.
---
That was absolutely beautiful, and I love that killer. LOL
---
I just wish there was a way to stop the rescue. Like, kick the survivor away from you. It's so annoying when people go in for the save right in front of the killer. Then you get downed instantly and rehooked.
---
Alright thanks
---
&gt;U arent discussing you keep on whining about something.... 
---
&gt;  i already said you should accept it.
---
That's not a discussion, you are just saying to accept the problem.
---
&gt;starting useless discussions
---
Yeah what's the point of talking about dbd on a dbd forum, crazy idea right?
---
Healing yourself without a medkit is a huge waste of time not helping the team. You're better off using bond which is useful all the time and finding someone, having them heal you, and then work on a gen together.
---
Dont count on it yet
---
Oh yeah that's why I stopped playing Quentin after I got him to P3 :/
---
Man how broken that's would be right? Not even BHVR would leave a killer like that alone for almost 3 years right?
---
I watch Monto and Puppers the most but Otzdarva holds a place of honor after my shitpost made it into a thumbnail of his.
---
Quick, somebody call Shawnee Smith, Jaime Lee Curtis and Danny Glover.
---
I never said the same loop. Brain dead reddit back at it again.
---
What is killer supposed to do except from BMing the hooked guy? Idk, breaking the pallets, closing the hatch,
---
and also
---
hear this out
---
not BMing?
---
If he just stranded there waiting for kobe and not revving, he would got OP
---
I feel bad for trapper, imagine looking for your traps randomly spread around 3 levels of a map. That must be a so tedious.
---
Sadly Robert Englund didn't play Freddy in this version.. but I'd like to see his version as a skin regardless.
---
But my hopes are already up now D:
---
Alright thanks haha I was just so mad at getting tunnelled and screwed over by the purge vomit that I just had enough
---
I‚Äôm not sure that you understand why nothing will come from that because the license holders can‚Äôt DO anything currently because of how complicated the legal issues surrounding the licenses are.
---
It‚Äôs the weekly post again guys üëçüèª
---
Bro I can‚Äôt find this format anywhere i look
---
This was funny as hell tho
---
The oblivious icon just makes it perfect.
---
No, why? Did you see anything remotely official about an event?
---
Thanks for the tips man. Much appreciated.
---
I haven't played against Freddy since I made the post but will definitely keep your advice in mind.
---
I hope for more of a ‚ÄúI win I win at least one game every 5‚Äù over making it out every game. Starting EGC and knowing you have a 0% chance of making it and have to either go for it on a suicide run or just wait to die is a pretty shitty feeling though.
---
Wait until chapter release and Scoops Ahoy Steve.
---
Oh my god!
---
Lol
---
I play as survivor but ive reached the point of i dont care anymore
---
Don‚Äôt do this. Robert Englund has no control over it.
---
They still don't need to be an asshole and rev their chainsaw right in front of their face. I would've probably taken the time to go find the hatch and close it, or at least run some laps with the chainsaw.
---
i put emojis idgaf
---
ü§£
---
I know I know
---
And it's prett easy to compare: try and listen to music, eat a bowl of cereal or look at your phone while playing killer (things you can casually do as survivor while still doing your objective)
---
Yeah and just started DbD roughly 3 weeks ago, loving it so far. Great, i hope to see you there sometime, its the same as my name here.
---
Since the survivor's head doesn't get removed I'm dubbing this Mori the S U C C.
---
Praise be!
---
I mean I say on leaks by daylight there was gonna be double blood points from the 4th to the 9th but was just asking a question dude...
---
The new loops are mindgameable, I think the only braindead here is the one that cant use the brain to trick the killer instead of running in circles
---
If they changed his look it truly would be a wet dream.
---
Cells only. 1080 AC for the full outfit
---
Yeah I'm sure really don't understand why nothing will come out of this. So let's just wait some time and see what will come out of this
---
did they think they added all regions? because they didn't lol 
---
still the ptb was better for me ping wise but yeah....not all regions were there
---
Bloodpoints of course

I love his hair(?) style!
---
Story time here below.
---
Based on a match in which, after a bunch of minutes from the start, I  was hooked, but nobody came: two immediately disconnected while the Jake  remained with me got caught. Killer was carrying him towards me, to let  him unhook me, but he disconnected, too. 
---
Post game chat was like:
---
Killer: "I wanted to let him save you, but he DCed!"
---
Me: "Don't worry: I understood you had good intentions, but not him,  sadly! :P"
---
Killer: "I really wanted to help you"
---
Me: "Thank you! I was really hoping you could unhook me!"
---
Killer: "lol xD" 
---
Thanks to all kind players outside! xD
---
if you could read the comment you replied to, you wouldnt understand my comment
---
Tends to be more like 1 week of PTB, then 1 week of touch ups before release.
---
That said they completely broke their pattern by announcing the chapter weeks before the PTB, so don't bet on anything.
---
he needs to aim, mr demo is totally fine, killer mains needs to adapt just like survs
---
It is if you love scraping makeup off of peoples faces with your teeth, or love having tooth marks on your face
---
Since this on your screen are all perks you got I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs solid. You can rotate with hunted ground and spirit fury for thrill of the hunt
---
Well then you have learned a valuable lesson that you don't trust leaks.
---
I‚Äôve.... literally explained why the legal issues surrounding the licenses make it very, very difficult for even the minimum amount of Nightmare content to be made. Maybe you should look into it yourself and learn about the issues with the licenses if my explanations were too complex.
---
Im pretty new myself, started last December, hope to see You in the Fog, and when Youre streaming! &lt;3
---
I'm excited about this. I am curious if it's gonna be a cosmetic option for people who liked Meth-Head Quentin, or if they're gonna replace his face entirely.
---
Okay thx
---
Thanks for this
---
Whats the yellow perk?
---
Hmmmm wonder what the difference is between whining and talking.... find out for yourself when reading this thread :)
---
Yeah, sorry I guess.
---
no problem :3
---
D- did you make this? Holy SHIT OP its amazing
---
Nope since Robert Englund didn't portray Freddy in the reboot.
---
Personal*
---
Damn, I‚Äôve been looking forward to the event...I didn‚Äôt know it was a ‚Äúleak‚Äù
---
Thats not how the meme goes captain obvious
---
Ultimately, I suspect its all about money. Most times the person sueing just wants a suitable check and will go away. The issue here is that the check he would have gotten before the first one came out would have been substantially smaller at that time becuase they would have had no idea the franchise would do as well as it did. After tge fact its easier to demand all sorts of things.
---
Get thanotophobia and replace bbq
---
Hey man I think I played with you yesterday, I gave you the hatch remember
---
I see you dont have moniter and abuse yet. You should get it , its a good perk for sport.
---
Yet again, I work with licensing so I know how it works. I know it's not an easy matters, but also it each time depends on case to case basis.
---
And no, your explanations aren't really any complex. What complex can be in the repeating mantra "I know it won't ever happen because of the reasons".
---
But yet again, the time will surely tell.
---
Change your region to Denmark then you can download it and then change back. Then you can play.
---
add peanut to dbd
---
Having the event when the characters drop would be nice...there are 9 perks we need to unlock and purchase.  Hopefully it all happens with the new web.
---
I wouldn't mind a video of Kyle Gallner.
---
Yup
---
The methheads have had their time, the return of the king is imminent
---
Oh no, nobody‚Äôs told him that‚Äôs just how ugly he is?
---
I‚Äôm just kidding, I‚Äôm all actuality it would be cool to see his character get the same likeness level of ash, Steve, and Nancy.
---
Thrill of the hunt
---
In his natural habitat
---
You said yourself you work with car licensing, which is vastly different from licensing involving characters from a film or show. The license holders that have the minimum rights to the Nightmare franchise (since Wes Craven didn‚Äôt pass on the rights to the characters to anyone before his death) cannot do anything with them because of the legal battle involving Warner Brothers. That is why no new content, basically besides this DLC, has been released. Additionally, the license holders have been pulling and not renewing the licenses, making it so literally no one can do anything else with the content. Is that really so complicated?
---
Offerings created by the entity are uniquely labeled as iridescent.
---
I mean, yeah his addons are kind of an issue now. But I find myself doing better on Legion now than before the rework. He actually feels like a real killer, and the new, normal movement speed will grant smart killers downs.
---
DAAAAAAMN. That looks absolutely fantastic. Is it coming next patch? Please tell me it is coming next patch.

Can't wait.

Let me know if you have an criticisms!

I've literally said it's quite simple

Same. I really think he is perfect where he is

Yet again, let's wait and see, shall we?
---
Sssh. A man can dream
---
It isn't busted, it's quite easy to dodge as long as you have some freedom of movement and it does have a slight stun.
---
If you hit someone you're locked in place and literally cannot look around, if you hit an obstacle it's like a billy chainsaw to an obstacle.
---
It's not as good as nurse since it still needs a clear line of sight and for the survivor not to move, with no obstacles in between. It's good, but nurse's power is still stronger
---
Killer mains who don't experience the issue
---
Yes please!
---
I like that you can see a glimpse of his actual face under it
---
That would be pretty cool to see too!
---
Can't because he can't be used for commercial products apparently.
---
Again, i don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt understand about any of this. Just because they want to and are going to talk about it doesn‚Äôt mean the license holders are going to let them change the license they already agreed upon.
---
How do you know he won't. Freddy wasn't nerfed

Use iron will. Lmao

i should have tweaked roughness sliders a little less i was only watching arm and elbows dint notice wrist was so greasy :(.. it will probably look better in video since eevee skin shader kind of handles them well.
---
I‚Äôm confused by this. Do you mean that your items and add ons get used after a game when using a ward?
---
The point of it is to give more tools to survivors, not make them impossible for any aide to play around.
---
Let's be honest - you know what I don't understand about it, and also you know what you don't understand about it yourself - all the tidbits and legal nook and crannies that are involved.
---
That's the reason I can't just agree with the randoms from the internet who talk like "YOU SHOULD STAY PUT AND LISTEN TO ME" without talking anything really specific to the case. I mean, why should I?
---
I would rather simply wait and see.
---
"What am I looking at?" This is a game I just finished, in which I decided to torture myself. Armed with nothing but Insidious I, I stood on a hill on Suffocation Pit and went into treatment mode. And then I waited. I waited for so long, the survivors found me. Dwight cleansed a totem right in front of me, then he came up to me and two Megs soon joined him. They teabagged, pointed, signalled me to follow them, dropped their items and ran around me, but it was all for nothing. Because I was standing still, the chase never started, and because I didn't do anything the whole game I managed to finish with zero points without disconnecting. As you can see by the screenshots, survivors were confused as to what was going on, they thought it must be a bug or that I was hacking.   
---
The truth is, I was just messing around, and apparently I messed with their minds as well. 
---
In conclusion I would ask you not to do things like this as it is considered trolling and may ruin the fun for others.
---
Could y‚Äôall take it to r/DBDgonewild plz
---
Loving that Leon Kennedy cosplay
---
I CANT HEAR YOU!!
---
‚ÄúInsidious is op on doctor‚Äù
---
imma get this skin asap
---
It‚Äôs not like spirit fury. You either hit the survivor then they drop the pallet, or they drop it early and you destroy the pallet. But the hit isn‚Äôt larger it‚Äôs the whole build up and charge of it. It‚Äôs not even OP. He‚Äôs comparing it to nurseüòÇüòÇ. If the charge gets nerfed then the demo is gonna be like a wraith killer
---
But then you wouldn't test the new webs
---
1) ghost face is not that OP
---
2) this time hitboxes are really fucked up. Just watch his stream at the start, he charged a guy but didn't hit the survivor even if he was literally infront of him. He tested with one of his friends, and he got him 1 time out of 19.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but he portrayed Quinten in the Nightmare on Elm streat remake, not his ingame voice?
---
No. If the killer could see it, then it would be counter-productive.
---
No.
---
They need to rework Chaser. Right now, it punished any 1-shot Killers.
---
You'll have the same problems with Hillbilly, Leatherface, Myers and Ghostface.
---
Because I know someone is going to want it in that format, so I converted the music to 320 Kbps for that reason.
---
Um yea, ok lol. So basically you disagree with me stating the game could be made better?
---
They really messed up many hair styles on the PTB.
---
If there's one thing I don't want them to go live with it's the new hair textures.
---
Jeff looks so happy aaaaaw
---
The Hunter and a Bill cosmetics.
---
Overhaul his perks too pretty please? (Except Pharmacy that one's fine)
---
He had extended range add-ons
---
It's not just low setting. It's happening on all setting.
---
Jeez, why do skins have to be $10? That's insane.
---
Killers and survivors have wards.  Killers wards allow them to keep their add-ons after a match.  Survivor wards allow them to keep their add-ons after death. 
---
When a match is canceled, your load out stays the exact same, bar the offering.  You keep it, but it's not automatically equipped.
---
I appreciate that the Killer kinda realized what was going on and just went with it. That's always nice.
---
Maybe for Slice of Fried Gold make it always killer in aura for 30 seconds but have the ranks change the altruism speed? Like +20, +35, +50?
---
She‚Äôs been my main since 2016 rip
---
Me neither. ;)

I think people on Reddit want to hold a standard for how people communicate it is always good to read up on Reddiquette so you know to what standard people want you to type. It makes things a lot easier to understand:

Also Redditors like it if you have a source for the info you have used and of you make edits to write them at the bottom without changing your main body of text unless it is a typo.
---

---
Finally he won‚Äôt look like a goblin on meth!
---
Dark mode with orange color in the settings. Simple as that.
---
Yeah, there was somebody who tried to copyright the SCP logo, but it‚Äôs all in the public domain. No way to monetize it. Just imagine tho
---
I have the exact same feelings on the issue. Killer is in the spotlight - his performance, his attitude.
---
Hey, I don't mean to comment on a 2 week old post
---
(even though that's exactly what I'm doing)
---
But I kind of know this guy, not personally, but we were on a discord together where he would talk sometimes. (So not a lot lol)
---
He would be an ass to everyone who wouldn't share his opinion. I actually saw him argue with someone over if kids still went to the mall.
---
He really likes to try and put out the "I'm so hardcore" look, and it's a little cringy. 
---
He actually even stole the website domain of a game called "Last year" (which died lol). That wouldn't be so bad, but he formatted it to show his own Last year videos.
---
 [http://lastyearthenightmare.com/](http://lastyearthenightmare.com/) 
---
You can watch the video on it, but I really doubt he was going to give it back from the kindness of his own heart. Even though the devs of LY are really not good at doing dev stuff, it's still douchy to steal a domain name.
---
Like he seriously went through the process of buying, formatting, and putting his videos into the website. I'm not sure if that was before or after talking with the devs.
---
I really don't think he would have just GIVEN it back. I think what he was attempting was a "pro gamer move", but it ended up getting him blacklisted. 
---
He also got banned from their discord, but I don't think the ban was really just. Biker is a complete asshole tho. 
---
\--------------
---
I also remember him talking down to smaller channels as if he's better. He hosts giveaways on his channel which artificially inflate his numbers, even though he has like 34K subs, he can't average anything near that amount for most of his uploads.
---
TL:DR - Your typical "I'm hardcore fuck you beta males" type of guy who doesn't really deserve your time. (Says the person who wrote an essay just now)
---
People may be bad, but the game does not know that. It‚Äôs only recognizing somebody has just been unhooked therefore, being able to use DS in case if the killer decided to go after them again. 
---
You have to remember there are some matches a survivor will never be able to use the perk, making it completely useless if the killer slugs constantly.
---
Candyman is getting a remake/sequel in 2020 produced by Jordan Peele starring Tony Todd. I hope we get a tie-in.
---
Unless amazing specific build comes out for him probably not, from the very little testing so far I wouldn't say he is a top killer.
---
Because the entity takes meemerioes
---
lore wise, nothing to do. pretty sure you made up the fact that it‚Äôs huntress. artwork is amazing but why is she holding a zombie head? why are her clothes so well kept, at this point she‚Äôs been living alone, in the wild, for like 5 years.
---
Hear him DBD please
---
OOOH . That makes sense . It's hard to see the name at the bottom
---
It's because once a match starts to load in, the offering is no longer in your offering part of the load out, it's put into the match settings. Upon match cancellation it simply doesn't get put back into the load out but into the offerings selection. Complaining about it is kinda silly seeming you still get to keep the offering its just not equipped
---
You‚Äôre joking right?
---
You ever just noclip out of reality just to escape the demogorgon
---
Who‚Äôs scuba Steve? I keep on hearing about him lol
---
Cringe
---
The same thing happened on one of the reworked Badham maps. They patched it pretty quickly. Still a bummer it happened to you
---
apart from last perk it‚Äôs super solid perk ideas. Love the first two, especially cleanse speed for countering noed. good ideas
---
you'd hate the hell out of my doc build then. (bbq&amp;c, bloodhound, nurses calling, and overcharge)
---

"Wtf with my hitbox"
---
What does the rarity change since everyone can have it ? I've always been confused about this.
---
I know it's stronger, that doesn't mean it's not busted, missing the lunge doesn't matter when the recovery time is so laughable,  he can just immediately lunge again, I played ad the demogorgon I know how strong that ability is, you don't even need his portals to win

We dont know, there is no current date.

I‚Äôm very opinionated when it comes to games because I only play about 3 or 4 games at a time and rarely divert to other games. But when a game that I like the concept of isn‚Äôt a good as it should be then it upsets me because it means I‚Äôll be stuck playing same game hoping for something to improve and it never does, all they ever do is add new content because it‚Äôs a quick and easy way to make money of course. Feels almost like a lost cause because the developers would have to spend time and resources to rewrite the mechanics. So I guess this is me ranting haha

There's literally no reason to obfuscate this info.

i use bloodhound to track better. it helps a lot when you injure someone or they get unhooked and they decide to walk/urban evade you can see the blood better. i have horrid eyesight so it works well for me to see the blood brighter lol

Shes a really good killer wich can destroy at any ranks. One of my mains and a super fun killer. Also has 2 super strong perks and one fun situational perk.

Check Fumgoose plague videos on YouTube and see her potential.

I started playing this week and I realised that's the best way to do it, I always have at least 20k and then add the bonus, I'm happy to see I wasn't bamboozling myself :)
---
Survivors with passive abilities would be pretty great ngl. Something different and new. Hopefully they wouldn't end up too overpowered. 
---
I would honestly like to see more new original content of both killers and survivors as well. Theres alot of potential that can be put into origional content too.
---
btw its "their"
---
Karma farming... sigh.
---
huh interesting it shows a bit of human wraiths skin is this skin canonically before he was the wraith fully?
---
People claim this is going to happen basically every time. There will be more of the new killer for the first week or two, before it settles into whatever level of popularity its actually at.
---
If vomiting all over people is boring I don't wanna be interesting.
---
Well if I was playing Demogorgon in the PTB and saw four Claudettes with DS, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, and Dead Hard I'd be pissed and probably DC too
---
I guess? Sure.
---
That is me in the background debating my life choices.
---
Have you heard of anyone getting banned for it? And do you have modified usercfg aswell?
---
Oof
---
1) I didn't say he was. Do you even read?
---
2) No, they're not. Dedicated servers are fucked up, it has *nothing* to do with the hitboxes. Every killer has the *exact same* hitbox, every single one. Try playing the game instead of using one streamer as a reference for everything.
---
I love it when a plan comes together üòÇ
---
Yeah, they have weird texturing.
---
I went there after finding out it exists....ill stay away from that place
---
Plot twist: he's gonna make Kyle look like the dbd version D:
---
Obviously creepin on Jane's feet.
---
I thought someone was calling a nuclear strike when I first saw it in game lol
---
This is some serious gourmet shit
---
yeah agreed I dont think I've ever brought anything other than a green mori for rituals otherwise you lose about 50k points taking an ebony mori over a survivor pudding or BPS/gateau
---
My stock build since they fixed Head On has been #2 with BT instead of Dance With Me. Haven't tried that actually, maybe I should! Excited to use it with Nancy's locker heal perk too.
---
Honestly, when I bought the plague with shards I regret it on a number of levels. I recommend either buying Spirit. Spirit is a really good top tier killer. In my opinion anyway, she‚Äôs one of the killers worth buying with shards. I‚Äôm just saying. Survivors are no match for the plague. I won‚Äôt stop you from buying her just giving you my honest opinion.
---
You make a fair point, so why not add a few reverse bear traps at her side
---
Lol shushhhhh ikkkkk
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
The drawing is insanely good
---
Paul blart for killer?
---
This is pretty typical when a new killer comes out.
---
No I like that part but not having corrupt because survivors don‚Äôt cleanse is so boring
---
I'll settle for a giant framed photo of Shawnee Smith in the game map.
---
SPIRIT HITS ME FROM ACROSS THE MAP BECAUSE OF LAG. WASN'T AWARE THAT SPIRIT WAS HUNTRESS.
---
Imagine being so proud of this piece of shit zero creativity meme that you watermark it
---
You mean louder then bill man Nancy mains better start bringing iron will
---
Holy crap!
---
The reason why is because vocal Minority on this subreddit is thirsty teenagers. The actual player base doesn't give a shit about shirtless Myers and Steve's bulge.
---
Do you have a link for that? I'd love to see it
---
&gt;Have you heard of anyone getting banned for it? And do you have modified usercfg aswell?
---
I have never heard of anyone getting banned for it and I've been using my edited files to remove vSync since 2017.
---
Il fucking do IT again
---
I was about to say that Claudette isn't giving no fucks in that t-pose. lmao
---
If PTB is anything to go off then it will be at the top of the hour.
---
why would you put adam ash and jeff in the 
---
**P U N I S H M E N T Z O N E**
---
And an ebony mori only only procs if you let yourself get hooked. If you're playing great you will never get moried. If your team has a single weak/ careless member then anybody can get the oneshot murder. If you got some weird special music when you were getting creeped on it would be different.
---
Only v-sync?
---
It was never confirmed.
---
It could be today or another month from now, we don't officially know.
---
Some say while she was at ram ranch she acted like a breed of ram, wanting to rut.
---
Yeah, you can tell by playing as or by looking at it, you can tell that it is not a human, but rather a beast. A monster. An animal.
---
Then what about Billy on lerys etc, it would be hard to balance
---
Head On + Dance with me is not that much effective as Lithe + Dance with me because you con't have a speed boost but still sometimes it gives you some freedom for a juke
---
One of the best reasons to play Nurse
---
BHVR hasn't announced any double BP.
---
can still one shot, but trapper is literally useless. if he‚Äôs right behind the survivor while holding chainsaw he could in theory still get them
---
We have orange as a national color? Goddamn did the Netherlands invade us?
---
I cant wait for semis redraw with shiny sparkle and shit around quentins new face
---
why would i use any sight perks? its a troll build... people already hate the doctor as is and i love making people suffer to the point of rage quitting.
---
AND the hatch opens right next to him
---
But much less likely. Same way as trapper is on some maps
---
Spine chill still works, because it activates as long as he's looking at you within the range, you can also use it to identify insidious ;)
---
David can literally run around shirtless
---
in theory you can still get them though, but have you ever gotten a trap/ gotten trapped in lery‚Äôs?
---
I would agree with you except I like spending bloodpoints
---
But yea if it was all unlocked on other ptb's I think that'd be ok
---
Yeah but just blame it on hitboxes anyway why not lol
---
Kyle is the actor of Quentin in the movies.
---
Multiple times, you just have to put them at vaults etc
---
Give it a few days
---
Good trappers have no problems on indoor maps. Windows and certain doors can be trapped to give you superior control.
---
and they never get saboed? my traps (on vaults) always get saboed on indoor maps, he‚Äôs unusable.
---
What about 343
---
The originals of the new one?
---
When did they nerf ghostface?
---
Rule 8. but yeah that sucks.
---
Sometimes, but that happens in all maps for me
---
[Here's](https://clips.twitch.tv/HorribleRelentlessTruffleSpicyBoy) a clip, you can go to the vod from there.
---
*The Demogorgon proceeds to take the expressions "pick up" and "hit on" way too literally, hitting every survivor twice before picking them up over his shoulder.*
---
**P T B M A G I C**
---
If four people are on gens and you can‚Äôt find anyone then you need to work on your killer gameplay honestly.
---
https://youtu.be/pmzZbtLCEpE
---
It‚Äôs them lol
---
I play on low because high ia so damn dark, Jesus I can't see nothing
---
Frank West
---
I mean what do you expect from a guy who considers whacking people with an IV stand a form of treatment :3
---
Ok now everyone see if Jamie Lee Curtis and Danny Glover have twitter accounts
---
Wait the bottom one isnt a thing or is it?
---
How much for just the cowboy hat?
---
Specific to Tombstone Myers that makes sense but it makes no sense for the entity to give someone like Pig the power to kill all 4 survivors by her hand and then get pissy when she kills all 4 survivors by hand.
---
facecamping leatherface, hits you with m1
---
9000 iq confirmed
---
I remember when clown was rated just as good as huntress and now without a change he is worse then doctor and on par with wraith. Something needs to happen.
---
KaBOOOM.
---
It was cancelled because too many people were pirating the show instead of watching it on Starz. No revenue = no show :(
---
Big brain
---
So you're saying there's a map where my Ruin has a chance of staying up longer than 30 seconds?
---
Pain definitely turns her on, I had to equip both Calm Spirit and Iron Will on her to shut her up lol
---
Pig face with no pig when?
---
Even Claudette wouldn't be able to fix that
---
It‚Äôs honestly pretty decent if the hatch gets closed and the doors aren‚Äôt too close together.
---
Why doesn't take the demogorgon takes the survivors head off with this mori? Is it really that much work to animate it? 
---
Like this he takes a little suck and from his stinky mouth smell the survivor dies or what?
---
in a situation where there's only two left, if the gates arent open you struggling on hook is just being selfish. dude couldve got hatch, but your stubbornness on "no one left behind" took the other guy down with you. well played
---
The very first ghostface ptb he could get spotted through walls instantly. Currently the janky detection is his strongest ability
---
Wait how is this a concept? This is just the power of pig...
---
It allows you to play as the Pig without having to buy her, there are others you can get such as Freddy Krueger, Leatherface, and Mikey Myers, these are the ones that I‚Äôve gotten through the bloodweb but I think you can also get the spirit as well, unsure about the plague.
---
Although you get one free run as the killer in the offering, you don‚Äôt have any of their add on‚Äôs and perks which I think you should be allowed since it‚Äôs a one time thing, or that they should come with their teachable perks but that‚Äôs just my opinion
---
nothing from the ptb transfers to your official, so no
---
May be my personal opinion, but I feel Tapp is close enough to Glover that he doesn‚Äôt really need a rework.
---
THAT‚ÄôS THE POINT OF THE DISTORTION THOUGH...
---
Is that the character from dead rising?
---
No I‚Äôm on the normal version on Xbox
---
It was datamined and leaked on the wiki, they have since apologized for it as it was never a confirmed date
---
Thank you
---
Yes
---
This is when we call him and your team all types of mean words in chat
---
&gt;*COMPLETE Power Description* Concept
---
It is really unfortunate that the optimal use of her power, getting survivors to max sickness and then hitting them with the basic attack (a use of her power which is encouraged by her daily) gives you way less points for emblems compared to chasing them around as if you were trapper without any traps.
---
Because it‚Äôs the PTB
---
MFW I got adept David
---
this. no need to hide a trap if it's in a good spot
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d021fs/didnt_know_that_the_entity_can_be_generous/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I was getting a ridiculous amount of hits through pallet with demogorgon. As surv and killer it looked super funky seeing him hit through pallets. Hope they fix that.
---
It's not the same character...
---
OH BOY. All my wettest dreams come true!
---
DON‚ÄôT FORGET THE MUSIC
---
OHMYGOD THE CHASE MUSIC IS üî•
---
Pig should have add ons to slightly, moderately, considerably, and tremendously increase the range of her dash attack. If you could increase the range of the dash attack from 16 to 28 meters (with an appropriate increase in attack cooldown) then it would be the strongest loop-breaking ability this side of Nurse.
---
Because its BHVR
---
HOLY SHIT, IS IT FINALLY HAPPENING?
---
AFTER ALMOST [**2 YEARS OF QUENTIN ABUSE**](/intensifies), US QUENTIN MAINS HAVE FINALLY BEEN NOTICED

Can we also get daddy Quentin thx

You got out gamered dude that‚Äôs why
---
Changes her mind?
---
I think it‚Äôs being moved to soon after the DLC drops
---
It hasn‚Äôt been confirmed anywhere yet when it will be.
---
It‚Äôs supposedly been delayed. No one really knows when it‚Äôs coming.
---
Apparently it was a mishap and there is no blood hunt this weekend
---
I mean not really, seeing how absolutely brutal some of the deaths are
---
ok and
---
I really hope they do it for the prestige version as well.
---
I‚Äôll still buy it if it‚Äôs a separate cosmetic but I want my prestige version of the face.
---
Aw, that‚Äôs sucks, I was really looking forwards to it
---
Did you just complain about his fucking lunge? What are you? Rank 20? This has to be bait...
---
Or mostly because the dash is a stealth based attack and would be pretty unfair if you could use it with insta down potential.
---
Remember the old days of silent billy?
---
It'd honestly be dumb to nerf the Demo lunge when the Nurse exists.
---
Same here, I had around 90 total bloody party streamers and gruesome gateaus saved up
---
It happens to mean all the time.
---
I mean as killer I've encountered a lot of really toxic survivors on the PTB. Multiple T-bags, pallet-blinds, endless looping, etc. Had one match with four Adrenaline and around two DS
---
My friend needs to learn this lesson he‚Äôs kind of an asshole but you know still my buddy he‚Äôs clueless about the game and wants the bps even if I say I can win he won‚Äôt do it even in kyf
---
I don't.
---
Demo's lunge is easy to predict and dodge plus you can't turn when using it.
---
Pigs dash is a stealth attack that you can turn while using.
---
[Mr. Cote was aware](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9akgi7/jamie_lee_curtis_on_a_charity_livestream_playing/e4web7f/).
---
She's also cosplayed as [Vega from Street Fighter](https://twitter.com/jamieleecurtis/status/622500719954800640?lang=en), she's no stranger to a joystick, I'd be pretty surprised if she's never played the game.
---
That‚Äôs all.
---
Ikr Clearly calculated  üòÇ
---
I didn‚Äôt think saying that would work, but then I scrolled back up to upvote. Good job. Ya got me.
---
ruin is weak wtf lol just keep repairing the gen
---
They might've moved at JUST the right angle to avoid it somehow, or the ping was wonky.
---
Nah murica kate is where its at
---
Since I saw people playing as the Demo I couldn't get the idea of it being a person in a suit out of my head and this just adds to that.
---
They cant delay something that was never confirmed.
---
Killer good survivor bad
---
This is bloody great
---
I don't DC but i came close yesterday. 
---
Wanted to do my daily, and got nurse blink hits.
---
So i que without addons and offerings and got... the game.
---
Haven't played nurse in a long time, so i was quite bad, but so were the survivors. They couldn't finish gens or lose me, but the chases took forever with all those corners.
---
I just wanted 4 blink attacks, but since there were still 5 gens left after minutes i had to chase them down one by one. All the while asking myself why i punish myself like that.
---
Point is, sometimes this game is the opposite of fun. The things we do for BP
---
Nuuuuuu stay. We have cookie.
---
Remember there is a huge influx of new players with the announcement of Stranger Things release. They're likely to quit like many newer players tend to do.
---
Yeah no, Doctor with right addons and perks is still the supreme king of 3 genning.
---
I LOVED that Mori! It looks so brutal and the "breaking" noises you can hear while it is shaking its head with the Survivor's ome inside is just so gnarly! I wish that the Survivor's face could look shredded after the Mori, but other than that I loved it so much!!
---
He's around Huntress/Hag levels, which is pretty great. Maybe not top 5 but definitely top 6 or 7.
---
I don't know, why are survivors rage quiting so much?
---
WHEN WILL IT BE ENOUGH? WHEN THE KILLER GETS TO SEE US AT ALL TIMES?
---
u/humanwannabe, u/AutohavenMeg, and u/XXLEspressoDepresso , Thanks for the great feedback I will tweak them and then release a new image detailing the changes, I now realize that speeds in this game aren't to be F\*cked with and understand that Toxic SWF can easily take advantage of the perks. Again Thank you for the criticism!
---
Exactly. We saw how Spirit, Legion, and Ghostface needed significant changes but that was because they were underwhelming in previous PTBs. But now they've hit the nail on the head with the Demogorgon in this one. The devs have learned their mistakes and actually brought out a well-rounded killer this time. Let's hope it stays that way.
---
*Stridor has entered the chat*
---
Damn and I thought overwatch had a toxic community
---
You only get a set amount of portals, and once you place all of them you completely lose the ability to place another until a survivor arbitrarily destroys one. So if the situation arises where you are in a chase, and survivors complete gens with portals next to them, they can choose to leave those portals untouched so that your teleportation/map pressure only stays on a portion of the map where it doesn't matter to be in anymore. Even more so if you decide to use portals on hooks/totems/gates/etc.
---
That how he was balanced. Save two portals for end game switches. Don't blow your portal load right away.
---
Not even surprised this happens considering those border things when cloaked as the Wraith were no longer at the edges of the screen when using Shadowborn. Which was super weird because it is his own perk.
---
The reason it was like that was because they had to move the camera's for the killers POV because certain killers were so tall that their cameras would clip into roofs and certain walls. Because of this Flashlights DID have to be pointed at the neck because that was where the killers eyes technically where.
---
Yeah, personally the new tier list would go...
---
1. Nurse (duh)
---
2. Spirit
---
3. Hillbilly
---
4. Demogorgon
---
5. Hag
---
6. Huntress
---
7. Freddy
---
8. Ghostface
---
9. Myers
---
10. Plague
---
11. Doctor
---
12. Pig
---
13. Clown
---
14. Trapper
---
15. Legion
---
16. Wraith
---
17. Leatherface (duh)
---
I honestly think that when people master Demo‚Äôs dash he could be up their with the big boys.
---
Nah m8, just the likenesses
---
Better to just remove the cap entirely.
---
Yep, she needs a change ASAP. Currently, she looks like the crypt keeper!
---
It can be sustained because it's fun... Yes there's a lot of meta cucks, but hell it's awesome to play against people who run something that's different from the meta! Hell I even love going against scratched mirror Myers
---
I think everyone has been asking this for a long time now. The devs just don‚Äôt do it.
---
i dont see any reason to post this, he might be new and playing killer for the first time and this kind of posts are so full of toxicity like "lol look at me i juked him and he dc'd", he might have just lost connection or he might just be done with the game since it can be frustrating at first, no need to post a video of this
---
Well for the killer yeah but what about for survivors? Did they not think that would be confusing for new players who are aiming at their eyes to blind them? It was stupid. No matter how you rationalize it.
---
A lot of people want unique chase music the problem is that it would cost a lot of money and time.
---
No. You can destroy the portals (relatively quick i might add, especially if more than one is doing it), You can also see him emerging for a few seconds before they regain control so you have ample time to start running, and they have a limited amount they can place.
---
I'd like H20 Laurie and Myers too!
---
How to get easy karma: 
---
*inspect element* 
---
Pick a thing that just happened. 
---
Make some old post say that thing will happen
---
Profit
---
He was rank 2, and I felt like it so I posted it.
---
It's crazy that Survivors used to release with 2 full, unique outfits (not counting Prestige) and now they have 1 and a single shitty recolour/reskin of their torso cosmetic. All for the same price.
---
Because there just aren't many people who want to play the support role which Steve is all about.
---
the dash isnt a insta-down like billy tho and he can only dash in a straight line. He is very dependent on the map and loop to get his dashes to work well.
---
He's pretty much huntress/hag. You can bait your lunge like a huntress throwing axe.
---
Yeah pretty sure they cared more about the functionality of their game from an engine standpoint than a consistency or realistic view.
---
They definitely need their own music. At least for all BHVR owned content.
---
This isn't a contest, I fucking hate Survivors who ragequit as well.
---
But Killers never really did that a lot before. At least in my experience.
---
It's literally less content than we used to get seeing as Survivors usually came with their default outfit and a unique full alternate outfit.
---
For me, I've become more stressed as i learned, i think some less healthy mindsets have rubbed off on me for killer too tbh
---
I'm not talking about the PTB, I'm on Xbox.
---
Because some countries laws would deem that as too violent and likely ban the game.
---
Probably because they did originally and did not want to make the same mistake twice on the same killer. They already pre nerfed Surge in the ptb so i wouldn't be surprised.
---
Someone explain
---
Hand it over now
---
Ikr, I don't facecamp but I always go for chainsaw if I know someone's unhooking.
---
they do not have the same map pressure. billy at any point in the match could run off to the other side of the map if he wants to. demo has to already have a portal on the other side of the map have extra portal on him to place then he can travel to a specific spot. id kinda say he is a mix up of hag/billy. but yeah id say mid tier fits him well he isnt a nurse spirit billy or huntress level
---
Stranger Things 3: The Sauna Test
---
actually fake zzzzz
---
***JUST*** noticed this twice on Hot, oops. But since I made the OG tweet I'm gonna keep this up lol. Again, so excited!
---
This is some quality shitposting in the tall grass
---
I assume it's the same "Biting" that your dog does when you play with it.
---
IF YOU GET 4K QUIT SENDING ME MESSAGES ABOUT REPORTING ME FOR NO REASON OTHER THEN YOU BEING POTATOES
---
I might buy him then
---
You just run him around like every other killer. If he‚Äôs using fast charge add-ons he‚Äôs gonna try to get right behind you since he can‚Äôt make much distance while in the frenzy. If he‚Äôs using speed add-ons, then his charge will be longer giving you time to get to a pallet/vault. Every other add-on LF has is literally broken as in doesn‚Äôt work.
---
Okay that's a good point. Still though
---
playing against a demo with purple ruin and not even running any of the new perks sucks when you don't have anything yourself
---
Thats a Mori waiting to happen
---
That still doesnt help, again, they made the portals reliant on survivors to break them
---
The only time weeping angels were seen moving in DW was when characters weren‚Äôt actually looking at them. Weeping angels would be very hard to implement into a game like this where chases happen and are a core part of the game. Seeing a weeping angel actually move would be weird and probably goofy. I just don‚Äôt think it would or could work without it not staying true to what a weeping angel is.
---
Huntress below hag? And I‚Äôm pretty sure huntress is better for looping but demo is better for traversing the map so it‚Äôs a hard tie IMO.
---
they should at least make the bloodweb faster
---
Nah.
---
Right, but as it stands right now they're probably already stretched thin with other priorities. It would be great if it happened.
---
If they could afford to outsource the music to someone else that might work
---
I always get called a useless troll when i escape
---
Padded Jaws. Traps don't damage, points for trapping increased by 100%.
---
What you don't know is that on his screen, he's pissed off because he should've grabbed you. Instead you're injured and run tf away
---
shhh
---
And as a proof, the current PTB has friends groups without dedicated servers: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/84219/3-2-0-player-test-build
---
&gt; We are currently reviewing the feedback and reports from the first day of the PTB and have disabled dedicated servers for the time being. The rest of the content will remain active and the Stranger Things content has be enabled as planned. We will keep you posted as soon as we have more information to share.
---
I bite my girlfriend's face when we're like play wrestling sometimes. Although now I'm self conscious about it so thanks for that
---
How would you know?
---
Could have put a demodog but ok
---
bad players need to stfu
---
Because killers can NEVER be toxic right? For every t-bagging survivor, there's a killer that camps the first person they hook &amp; vice versa. Both sides have idiots that ruin the game...
---
Well console have special edition so we get them free
---
Is this Paladins? That's just Furia
---
Nurse should never be compared to other killers because of what she can do. Hillbilly and Spirit are as far as it should go when comparing new killers to existing ones. They are never going to create a killer like Nurse again so the definition of top tier should not include her. She has her own place and no other killer comes close to what she is capable of.
---
It would be better if trapper was huntress.
---
I‚Äôm all for the change because he looks like a human scrotum but I‚Äôm gonna miss the days of 4 man Quentin squad where you‚Äôd group up and just look into those huge nasty baggy eyes
---
She actually played DBD last year, and she likes video games as well (she even cosplayed as Vega from street fighter!)
---
he also doesn't like being told that internet sometimes doesn't work. lol
---
Oh dear
---
He's cool, but, ah, he could use tweaking.
---
* Fix his lunge range
---
* Fix his Shred hitbox
---
* Maybe add an option to do the regular chase music
---
* Remove the limitations on camera movement during Shred's CD
---
I play survivor to calm down after a killer game ngl
---
Yeah, if you bait it into the wall the cooldown and camera lock really sucks
---
Knew she's into vidya but wasn't aware she's played DbD, that's pretty neat.
---
i'ts exceptionally easy to dodge and mindgame at pallets. Demo really shouldn't be using it except in open space to close distance or when they have the surprise advantage. lunging around a pallet and hitting the wall behind it for 5 minutes isn't a good use of it, especially when they completely ignore portals as a power and just try to lunge at everyone.
---
But it was moreso if i saw him i would drop my current chase for that sweet sweet dying light sooner than later
---
It‚Äôs happening a lot to me on PS4 too. Idk what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre just quitting when the game isn‚Äôt going their way. I see killers quitting more then survivors.
---
Pig definitely can.
---
I haven't noticed any penalty to camera movement on Pig under any circumstances.
---
Billy has a comparable penalty, but only when he runs into a wall, and even then he gets his camera movement back pretty quick.
---
‚ÄúDurrrr‚Äù? I‚Äôm sorry, how old are you? Reddit isn‚Äôt going to pat you on the back for tunneling, kid.
---
Thanks :)
---
So you... tunneled...
---
The plague has special music when waiting in a lobby. Why couldn‚Äôt they just carry it over or make some just similar?
---
Jamie lee Curtis is so cool
---
Pig's lunge should be treated as an M1 too.
---
That's because it has a bigger fan base of kids that like to play a. Shit game
---
This is sad boy hours
---
Should just make them like hag maybe? Unless it can spam the tp. In which case nevermind
---
Mature conversation between two intellectuals right here.
---
I'd say he was lagging and eventually lost connection and not quit tbh but I could be wrong.
---
So focusing on your obsession is frowned up but a swf group with flashlights and all that is fine? But a killer wanting his perk is frowned upon?
---
She‚Äôs on a thin line to be honest, but the fact that she does have counterplay stops her from being as bad as Nurse.
---
When I play against a P3 Quentin, they are usually really damn good at looping and they go out of their way to get my attention. I tend to avoid them for most of the game.
---
This is a dumb response to people saying the hitreg is wonky.
---
Thank you.
---
...Looks to me like his posture got changed.
---
Live version is more slouched, PTB version is standing up straighter.
---
Look at the position of the shoulders and legs.
---
The reason most licensed characters don‚Äôt have new cosmetics is because they aren‚Äôt legally able to add them
---
IT is basically the Entity itself. But I guess it could work still. "Fine. I'll do it myself." But this is fake regardless.
---
Some proficient killers are saying he's better than Billy
---
After people disconnecting all the time and dealing with survivors whining yeah. He disconnected so I didn't even need to go after him anymore lmao
---
I just hate losing my items and not receiving ANY bloodpoints when the killer disconnects.
---
i tried it a while ago, didnt help, its just a game issue i guess.
---
I actually think I would add him into my survivor rotation if he looked like that render. But I refuse to play as Gollum.
---
No it‚Äôs not.
---
So wanting a perk when he can do everything 50% faster is tunneling? Isn't the goal of dying light to kill the obsession first?
---
That might be me ngl I usually go out of my way with an insta heal and pharmacy just to waste time
---
Don't get how people think it's broken (aside from literal bugs).
---
If anything it needs slight buffs (hitbox fixing and camera movement during the CD mostly)
---
I just cant see him as a survivor :/ and as a killer surely he would have a chainsaw and punch survivors for m1
---
Just a heads up, calling someone a bitch via PSN messages is liable to get you suspended or banned if they report it. I realise that this dude also called you a bitch but there are people who‚Äôll try to goad you into insults and then report you to get you banned.
---
That‚Äôs true but even Huntress mains like Scott Jund can get juked by survivors who know how to be super unpredictable. Huntress has zero map presence, whilst the Hag trap‚Äôs existence slows the game down. Also like I said, tons of maps fuck over Huntress like,
---
Autohaven tile hitboxes
---
Coldwind corn
---
Literally every indoor map
---
Yamoaka‚Äôs Estate bamboo and tile hitboxes
---
Jungle gym maze on Macmillan‚Äôs 
---
Tile hitboxes
---
Asylum/Badham center building
---
Haddonfield house loops
---
What about Tapp?
---
You could‚Äôve just corrected him without being rude...
---
Oh wait the fave rework wasnt a meme and is actually happening?
---
: ( 
---
At there's a game we're getting hahaha *cries*
---
What was said prior to this? You're only showing the second part of the conversation
---
Doc needs survelince to tell if they touch gens, Demogorgon doesn‚Äôt. I had my longest game of dbd ever with the Demogorgon yesterday, until the last two people dc‚Äôd, they couldn‚Äôt get any progress on a gen and I had no gen perks. Doc needs a whole kit to 3 gen effectively
---
This is why Trapper is one of my favorites. So satisfying.
---
I feel like this is the case. Often times I have the same issue with Hag where the hit looks like it didn‚Äôt connect but because she‚Äôs so small and her hitbox is the same size as everyone else, it feels wrong when you‚Äôre hit from a certain distance away.
---
Mathieu: "Who would've thunk?"
---
Jay W: "I called it back when the curtain call chapter was released"
---
Mathieu: "Wait, that's illegal"
---
I know how the system works, this is my secondary account anyhow so I'm not too worried. I just don't get everyone getting upset and saying I'm trash for killing my DYING LIGHT obsession as quickly as I could. I didn't face camp and i still chased other survivors and hit and hooked them in the process of it all

Your teammate follows you and tries to save you XD Mine just run off and say BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

---
Yeah
---
That's literally the beginning, him saying that, you want another  SS?
---
I‚Äôd put him at around the 5th or 6th spot for now. I think putting him any higher would overrate him a bit but his power and lunge alone is enough to make him better than the rest of the killers.
---
A good Hag has great map pressure, can teleport quicker across the map and is quite decent in chases as she can cut off looping with her traps. These are things that the Demo can do but not as effectively IMO.
---
And with a good Huntress well she can cut chases to a fraction of the time and counter most loops and vaults at the cost of some map dependency. But again the Demo is not this powerful in chases and can still get looped a bit more. But he has way better map pressure.
---
For me it‚Äôs: 
---
1. Nurse 
---
3. Billy
---
4. Huntress/Hag
---
5. Demo
---
This and mix in some latency and there you go.
---
They would have to put in blinking as a mechanic for survivors but at that point the killer might as well be that one scp
---
He‚Äôs small and he‚Äôs hitting you with his hand, as opposed to a big machete or sword or whatever. So it looks weird, but it‚Äôs technically the same range as everyone else.
---
https://i.redd.it/8sr9tk23qrk31.png 
---
Nothing is set in stone yet but I'm sure we'll get more information soon‚Ñ¢
---
Even when down
---
I know man it‚Äôs bullshit
---
I believe that you gain 5k blood points
---
Agreed. I play different survivors purely for their appearance/cosmetics, since they‚Äôre all just costumes for the most part. Even without any outfit cosmetics, New Quentin would be one of the cutest boys.
---
There was no way this guy had played the game before, the jukes you put out were something rank fifteens would do and the killer still fell for it
---
Its your fault he can heal 50% faster, YOU put on the perk and at the end of the day you still tunneled them.
---
I think claudettes are the worst. 
---
I find Aces, Jeffs and Jakes are pretty good.
---
It's a balancing perk designed to help killers against SWF and better players. That and BBQ have become so common now, it's expected in a match. Typically, once the totem is cleansed, it either becomes a camp fest or an easy escape.
---
Why tho, it's the ptb
---
BHVR riding the hype as they should be. New map looks fabulous and im pretty excited for the future of DBD if they play the cards right and improve QOL for the game to make it user friendly as much as possible.
---
\*shrugs\*
---
im with you
---
Can't wait to unlock that perk. Sounds super great to use with Lithe + Dance With Me.
---
I already main him because I like his body build and clothing. His face being changed would be quite welcome though
---
I just wanted her perks
---
Amazing. Commenting so I never lose this.
---
is it?
---
The same thing has been happening and I‚Äôm a red rank on PS4 now. Mostly people who follow you around the entire map for 4 gens and RQ after the 5th and Killers who can‚Äôt find you or the savior after getting unhooked, RQ. I‚Äôm starting to think they actually have feelings.
---
They aren't going to save to the main game.
---
A prophet
---
Whilst true I feel his character wouldn't kill no matter how much entity tourcher he goes through, so I made him a survivor
---
I wanted to use her perks when I play as Steve
---
Ohhhh
---
background girl is meg?
---
Shred feels like it only hits when it wants to
---
She's super fun and my favorite to play as. Not cleansing is the meta, but as the majority of people will tell you, there will almost always be someone that cleanses. 
---
She has two apple add-ons that add corrupt fountains as well, and I usually run one of those. If everyone is broken and you have a corrupt fountain, it causes a panic, and will oftentimes force people to cleanse.
---
If they don't cleanse, she does turn into an M1 killer, but everyone is not only down in one hit, but they are VERY noisy to the point the Iron Will doesn't help them.
---
It sounds like you facecamp
---
That's cultural appropriation /s
---
This is so good, please buff Doctor along with this skin
---
Will she show leg? O\_O
---
So that‚Äôs why my lawn‚Äôs covered in shit...
---
Its probably better to put near gens or hooks so you can use the killer instinct to help patrol
---
Oh, only reason I thought so was cause of the bar on the right is half way down, idk how that messaging system works though
---
Who cares what he looks like? His perks are 10x worse than how he looks.
---
Yeah, i guess so.
---
Because it helps killers slow the game down, which is the biggest thing killers need. A longer the game lasts, the more they can snowball and control the map. Why do you think most new killers have more ways to slow the game down
---
The only thing in the game that doesn't activate spine chill is a tier 1 myers. Yet.
---
Source: am a filthy spine chill user.
---
LOL so ur admitting to tunneling
---
Not going to happen. They made that inteintaol where you cant get portals back.
---
Shred has an larger hitbox than normal and I read somewhere his regular lunge is a tad smaller
---
That moment right before they step on the trap and  their cockiness thinking they can loop you is priceless

This is very helpful! Thank you for this.
---
Eh..unless they are bascally touching portals the killer instinct wont apper alot
---
That LF wasn't the clown, he was the whole damn circus.
---
If I see someone running toward the hook i'm gonna chase, it's up to them to decide if they want to drag me toward their friends saving someone or not. If they do, oh well. Forgot this sub was full of salty survivor mains so I guess everything is facecamping.
---
Me neither
---
Pisses me off beyond belief when I have to go hunt for totems...
---
I‚Äôm still fairly new but I‚Äôve learned that their spawn points can be either super convenient or extremely infuriating...
---
Would it have to be "Mr Skinnerrrrrrr" from Hot Fuzz as the killer?
---
Because hes like Freddy. He has good map control and mobility, probably one of the best in the game, a powerful chase ablitiy to help down, and some very minor stealth, stall and tracking. 
---
However, his portals if used badly don't help alot, and his lunge attack can fuck you over more then help if you miss
---
Oh god I love it so much
---
Tapp is both not like his actor, and yet still kinda sorta. If you pull a picture of Tapp and Glover, you can see it‚Äôs not far off.
---
Great work! You should go actual axe throwing with that cosplay lol
---
I had a game an hour ago where the killer quitted when we had 5 gens done and I didn't get a quitter bonus
---
Because LF has no stall, no map control, no tracking, no stealth, his chase really isnt that good, and hes slow.
---
Are SCPs copyrighted? They‚Äôre basically just creepy pastas right, with no real owner?
---
Nah just buy head on from the shrine. OP LOCKER STRATS
---
Yeah I had made this post prior to even checking Reddit. Checked Twitter right off the bat. Where was all this uproar last year? lmao
---
I dont think Demo is bad, and persronally i think mid tier is good for killers because every killer but nurse and spirit belong there
---
I KNOW IT'S NOT WEDNESDAY ANYMORE BUT I JUST HAD A GAME WHERE A LEGION KNEW EXACTLY WHERE I WAS ALL GAME (EVEN WHEN I WASN'T LEAVING SCRATCH MARKS OR MAKING ANY NOISE, COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BBQ EITHER BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HOOK ANYONE) AND AFTER KILLING ME THEY JUST LET THE OTHER 3 DO ALL GENS AND ESCAPE. WHAT THE FUCK
---
I'm not sure if it's 5K but I think I received the blood points for what I had already done up to the point the killer disconnected. Obviously 0 if killer disconnects as soon as the game starts. I could be wrong.
---
How the fuck is that scummy? Are you new?
---
In case you don't know, Dying Light does this after gaining stacks in a game. Something about it isn't working quite right.
---
I saw this happen before. I think, to balance just a bit, the Demogorgon‚Äôs lunge hitscan is very narrow, more so than a normal attack.
---
Billys map pressure can acaullty be worse depending on what map it is. Like for instance billy is garbarge on indoor maps, but amzaing on outdoor maps.
---
... Is it you? Are you the person playing Legion every game?
---
Nope. This is intended to be the way they work, so you need to be smarter with portal placements
---

Hans, Get ze luger
---
Wasn't confirmed. Just a possibility.
---
He can't get around the map what? He can place 6 portals and can use them every 15 seconds at will, what do you mean he can't get around the map. 
---
They aren't useless at end game, its called being smart with your portal placements instead of using them willy nilly.
---
yes  uWu
---
No announcement has been made
---
That‚Äôs what I heard too. Don‚Äôt have any sources for that though.
---
BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME THE KILLER ASSUMES YOU HAVE LEFT THE HOOK SO HEALING UNDER IT IS FASTER AND SAFER THAN HAVING SOMEONE CHASE YOU IN THE DIRECTION OF THE KILLER TO HEAL YOU.
---
Someone from Behavior has a vore fetish confirmed.
---
Leatherface and Freddy have both been in MK, Saw has no reason to oppose Gore, and Myers has a ton of grotesque Gore in his own movies.
---
I don't think the licensed characters would prevent anything

You didn't make the edit u/chattywindow did stop taking credit for other people's work

I was acting foolish as well tbh

Kyle: *"Does that feel good baby?"*

MCote: *"Pretty good job so far"*
---
edit: Thank you to whoever gave me silver. First time ever that I've received a reddit award like that :)
---
Shes honestly not that bad, I just think traps need to be less RNG based and work at end game and then she will be fine.
---
You'll just have to be smart about portal placement. It's a reasonable limit and it adds skill without taking too much away. If you're good enough with then survivors should be disarming them on the reg
---
Ironworks doesn't have a spot you can launch off of well (likely to hit a wall). Coal Tower on the other hand...
---
I think Tapp looks good. Sure it would be nice to get the likeness of the actor but he‚Äôs not a mess like Laurie and Quentin.
---
What‚Äôs the link???
---
a year ago it was more complex than that. there were different signals that players would use.   
---
Press the unhook button and hold it almost until it registered as an attempt (long hold): means that the killer is camping or near, so just go about the game as normal and dont come get me  
---
Press the unhook button repeatedly (mash the unhook): meant it was safe to come get me  
---
this was used for about a year then new players came in and it stopped completely. it would also give you the type of idea of how the killer played for if they got hooked a second time (whether they were a camper or if they left the hook) because they already signaled you last time.
---
MICROSOFT WILL NOT ALLOW TWO VERSIONS OF A GOOD GAME ON YOUR CONSOLE.
---
I feel like lately whenever someone explains why X thing is not happening/not possible (like the post about the Demogorgon not being killer material b/c it wasn't a human) BHVR just goes out of their way to prove them wrong and it gets funnier every time lol  
---
Good for Quentin mains though! I've always thought Kyle was very cute as Quentin, so I might consider buying him if they really do change his face.
---
Why am I aroused by Quentin
---
Search for the Curtain Call DLC Spotlight on YouTube
---
I hope this gets more likes. This is really funny lol
---
Same here. I was 2 seconds away from escaping and the killer left.
---
Its only funny when it happens to someone else.
---
The list should be the same as pc , nurses are rare and rarer if they‚Äôre good but she still dominates along with billy and spirit those are most certainly true . Tbh dbd should make a stat website where they show killers with the highest win ratio and least . To help end this ‚Äúdebate‚Äù lol and to help new is players who to choose
---
Dying Light: You become obsessed with one survivor. Your obsession gains a 33% action speed bonus to unhooking and healing other survivors. Each time you hook a Survivor other than the Obsession, if the Obsession is alive, gain a token. If the Obsession is alive, all Survivors who are not the Obsession get a 2%/2.5%/3% penalty to Repair, Healing and Sabotage speed for each token.
---
It is now an anti-tunnel perk that encourages killing the obsession last, if possible.
---
*Here comes the trapper!*
---
I love that Quentin is looking at her like "Yo Meg WTF"
---
I saw the full vid when it was recorded
---
So basically she watched as some guy who never touched dbd in his life try to play Laurie. It was really painful to watch. Like "I should attempt escape from the hook" kind of painful. Curtis even asked the dude if Laurie could take something like a knitting needle and stab the killer to escape, and he said no
---
Nope, it was a contest entry or something like that.
---
"Let's work together and *make* this happen."
---
It‚Äôs a sub he thought he fell for
---
Hell they could even add new chase/terror music to the store and get some more customisation for killers as a result.
---
Tinkerer and Discordance would be pretty good. Surveillance too.
---
I am not allowed to browse any non work related sites at work.
---
It's because it's on console and the killer is playing at 15fps and everyone is on wifi, and he has to use a controller. 
---
Mix all that together and a slight left/right turn can make them whiff.
---
A classic phrase that means positivity. We have no idea if the holder of Quentin copyrights will be fine with it.
---
The perk itself is designed to benefit from "tunneling" or focusing on one survivor which can be a frustrating experience for them I guess.
---
You went too far.
---
Underrated movie.
---
Discordance can kinda be done with his ability as is though. 
---
Surveillance sounds awesome though.
---
But I posted him being salty about it and asking why the obsession of all people would get mad, and all anyone did was say you're bad! Get good! Like, what am I suppose to do let everyone escape or something?
---
Did it once for the steam success, I've never played with a Highbilly that was so bad before, lucky me
---
&gt; Thank you for coming to my TED talk. 
---
Fuck you.
---
Shred hitbox is intentionally larger.
---
Clearly missed
---
That is how I got my adept david, escaping the nurse by actually having to use no mither and dead hard for a dramatic escape.
---
Survivor mains will complain about anything you do. It‚Äôs best to just not worry about it and let themselves be miserable.
---
Huntress is super map reliant. On some maps she can even compete with Spirit and Hillbilly, but on others there is almost nothing she can do. Hag works on pretty much every map.
---
The only time I'll suicide is if we're down to 2, and the killer has a solid 3 gen strat going.
---
Other than that, i can likely still get more bps, and or escape.
---
I think it looks weird on her, but that‚Äôs ok. Different tastes and styles for different folks.
---
I‚Äôd personally enjoy the hoodie with bunny ears for her, but here we are
---
Damn, that's a really cool way to die. I learned something today!
---
Thank you sir
---
See I play both S and K and I only get salty when I'm against a Freddy lol, I just hate him. I just don't get all the salt
---
Been playing for three months and still terrible at finding totems. Sometimes the totem spawn is really good and you just gotta power through it. If you hit a good skill check wait about 2 seconds before starting on the gen again then it will start progressing again.
---
But this has white and no red at all. You're doing me a conf√ºsion, man.
---
I play survivor and killer so you‚Äôre assumptions about me are incorrect. This sub needs to stop with the us vs them mentality. You give the person on the hook zero chance when you stay nearby. Hook someone, leave, and let them get saved. It‚Äôs a waste of time to hang out near the hook anyway
---
Thats some monkey paw shit, right there
---
Interesting hack
---
At least you're doing SOMETHING. I always end up with teammates who just crouch and hide across the map while someone else is being chased. No attempt to make a save. I go from first hook, to struggle to death and NOTHING.
---
Who's the owner of Quentin's likeness if not the actor himself?
---
WHY WOULD SOMEONE NOT GUARD THE GENS
---
did you know that meg does sport????????????????????
---
Alright good... I was worried about my wallet xD
---
Deditated servers
---
Absolutely, though I doubt the licence holder would object to them using the actor‚Äôs likenesses. That being said you‚Äôre absolutely right that it all needs to be run by the license holders and that they can refuse if they want.
---
when you cant secure a kill as leatherface you should just uninstall
---
It was never confirmed
---
You leave a hundred per day? Go outside
---
YOU! YES, YOU, THE STUPID FUCKING MEG WHO DECIDED TO THROW DOWN EVERY FUCKING PALLET IN EXISTENCE WHEN I CHASED YOU WHILE TEABAGGING AT EVERY SINGLE ONE, FUCKING OVER YOUR TEAM IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE AT THE END OF YOUR LITTLE RAMPAGE THERE WERE ONLY 2 PALLETS LEFT ON THE ENTIRE FUCKING MAP! I'M PLAYING KILLER OVER HERE AND I'M FUCKING FUMING, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST'VE FELT LIKE FOR YOUR TEAMMATES! GO BACK TO RANK 21 WHERE YOU BELONG YOU SORRY EXCUSE FOR A SURVIVOR AND LEARN TO FUCKING LOOP!!1!
---
I have a better idea. Nerf everyone else you mentioned until they are weaker than her! I‚Äôm a genius I know.
---
But its only rank 1, its barely even harder than a normal skill check
---
The owner of the franchise... Just because you acted on the movie doesn't mean you have the rights of the character
---
It happened to be 2 times so far, both games I was running dying light. My best guess is that it's related to the game attempting to apply all penalties, resulting in some error where the game literally can't function.
---
I want both. One because it looks cool, the other for research purposes.
---
oh. lol
---
Red + yellow = orange 
---
Plus the first actual german flag was red, black and WHITE 
---
I know we're supposed to be known for our accuracy but god damnit you guys are ruining my joke
---
Yeah but hag is a lot more counter able than huntress.
---
And the one time I don‚Äôt cleanse the totems, the killer actually does have NOED
---
Why GhostFace mains is annoying? pls explain
---
This is him now, feel old yet?
---
well it's good in team situations too. lol
---
"You can't use any helpful perk as a killer or you're toxic..." - survivor mains
---
I mean at the end of the day survivors are just skins so you don‚Äôt even have to worry about his perks
---
Idk I swear those claws give him an extra couple of inches through a window vault....
---
I think as players adapt, he won't be as strong as Billy. His lunge is very good, don't get me wrong. I just don't think he's Billy strong.
---
You and me both any totem I see gets cleansed.
---
I wish the animation style was better tbh. It‚Äôs like watching a dumbed-down Family Guy.
---
Agreed. I just find myself as being the last survivor alive in EGC a lot
---
So you're telling me people don't have the right to their own likeness? I'm not talking about changing Quentin's story as a character or adding cosmetics that weren't in the movie - just his face to actually look like Kyle.
---
I think New Line owns NOES (and Quentin as a character, but we're not talking about changing the character), but Kyle owns his own face.
---
Clearly you still understood what he meant though
---
He's getting high on his own supply
---
Lol yes survivors think its BM if you kill them or go for a 4k. Apparently you're suppose to let the last survivor win.
---
I love the blue name(idk new to reddit) but I understand the hate for face camping but everyday it's a new complaint it seems
---
Look, you‚Äôre young, the back story has a lot of errors with its writing, mostly spelling and grammar. It also doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense, yeah, you probably liked the area 51 meme. But her bringing her child to work makes so sense whatsoever, literally the entirety of earth knows nothing about what goes in in area 51. And its highly doubtful they would allow a kid into a top secret facility. Second, Francis is unrealistic, 7‚Äô9, thats literally one of the tallest people on earth.  Three, why the hell is Jeff the Killer involved in this story? Four, poisons would not melt a person even if it was ‚Äòcustom‚Äô as you said, he would have to be injecting acid into the guy, and the acid would dissolve any poison that would be put into it. Five, I‚Äôm gonna assume you‚Äôre either at the end of elementary or in middle school, you cannot just go to a class that you choose. The class gets selected for you, anyways, thats all I have to say for your backstory. Try and learn to grow creative and have better spelling and maybe some day people will accept your idea of a killer

You misread, dingus. I made a Tweet at Kyle Gallner a year ago when u/ChattyWindow uploaded the photo because I just wanted to see if they can make it happen.
---
Not long ago, despite the Tweet nearly being a year old, MY tweet I made @ Kyle got washed up on the front page of this subreddit.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cwuy9p/you_probably_saw_a_quentin_edit_post_earlier/

There's the post^ If you read the comments, I credit u/ChattyWindow for the edit (NOBODY ELSE WHO MADE THIS POST THAT DAY HAD DONE IT, ANNOYINGLY ENOUGH) and I mentioned how my name was poorly cropped from the Tweet, as you can see me Twitter handle in Kyle's response. Simply stated I had tweeted the edited photo at Kyle, never once stated nor implied it was MY edit. I *wish* I could do that kinda stuff though lol
---
Sometimes if I feel generous or think they're a baby survivor I do, but often i get 4ks
---
Should‚Äôve noticed that sorry my bad.
---
I like the head, but something about Dwight just seems off to me. In all of his skins it seems like his torso is way too long or something.
---
YEET!
---
Good point. But yeah, I‚Äôm definitely gonna be running Surveillance, probably with Enduring and Spirit Fury for using Shred while a survivor is going towards a pallet (because you either hit them or get hit by the pallet, then free hit with Spirit Fury), and maybe BBQ and Chili to level quicker.
---
I feel you might be onto something there as again I feel he launches himself out the window to hit you.
---
I just hate that if you don‚Äôt take Ruin/Corrupt Intervention, you will most likely have 2-3 Gens pop before you can Hook one person, especially true if they‚Äôre good at Loops.
---
No way.. There are MUCH more violent games out there. Also ripping out your heart and eating it whole is ok (Hag mori)? 
---
For me the mori doesn't look complete like this..
---
Ur right but this sub is majority killer mains so they don't want killer nerfs. Plague will definitely be nerfed in the future like legion
---
You are not guaranteed it is a gamble. The Survivors could just spawn on ruin or they just hit all great skill checks.
---
You really think at 6th best he's too good and needs to be nerfed???
---
So it's tunneling to focus when you see the chance too on someone who will literally be game changing to kill? He had his 3 hooks, well 2, since he left lol.
---
Technically if everyone ran No Mither, No Mither would become more effective because it would remove the slugging strategy
---
I don't actually face camp on purpose unless it's a toxic tbagger. No matter what killers do it's a toxic move, I'm kinda sick of it.
---
I'd say he knows at least a couple things
---
I'm playing Michael, idk if that makes any difference 
---
Teabaggers need euthanized
---
Just before I left on vacation, I bought it and played a round as the trapper (I plan on maining the Demogorgon, for it has been my dream to be the Demogorgon in a video game). I am hooked (no pun intended). I NEED more, but I cannot play again until I return.
---
Also as a side note, at the time when I played, I was not aware it was poor etiquette to strike your prey once hooked. To all survivors of my round, I apologise, for I got so enthralled in my role as the killer, and was not aware that such an action would be frowned upon.
---
I plan on playing this often. It scratches that asymmetrical itch Evolve left in what remains of my heart.
---
Yeah, if it's a bad survivor I'll normally let them live but I still get yelled at for a 4k.
---
Does anyone else LOVE the footstep sounds ? It‚Äôs so meaty and heavy and actually intimidating. I think his appearance and sound effects are by far the best of any killer yet.
---
Gentle Bubba
---
I'm thinking that Pop Goes the Weasel would be good, especially with Surveillance. 
---
Pair that with tinkerer and the demo one that blocks the exit and it'll be a fun time.

yeah lol, its feels weird when you hit a survivor who almost finish a fast vault from across a window when your arms are a 1000 miles away, thatd ok btw, just want an fov change to not look weird in the killers perspective
---
But changing THE CHARACTER QUENTIN inside of the game DEADBYDAYLIGHT, affects copyrights. Doesn't matter who it would look like, as long as it changes something about it
---
I'd understand like tbagging in halo or cod. But a survivor tbagging is just straight up stupid... "oh look at me I'm good at zero mind game loops."
---
Us 30yr old gamers enjoy the 90s nostalgia of GF
---
hes not fucking myers but you do you, a clown
---
You're not alone friend
---
I'm not saying it won't happen. I'm just saying it's not confirmed
---
My only issue is that if survivors don't destroy your portals, once you place 6 (or whatever number) you're out. No picking up and replacing them like trapper. No deleting the first one to make a new one like freddy or hag.
---
Now I feel if you have that much control to traverse the map, you're probably winning but I think giving him a way to move or continuously place portals (like hag) could be a nice little buff.
---
Either way I agree. I love the demogorgan. He's creepy, terrifying to watch from a survivor perspective, and hearing him screech across the map adds a sense of being hunted by this
---
 demonic creature and I love that creep factor.
---
Yes I agree.

You monster...

Thx ( ‚ó†‚Äø‚ó† )
---
HOLY CRAP. PLEASE.
---
No thanks. It‚Äôs about the stupidest thing I‚Äôve seen on reddit.
---
It was never confirmed. So never.
---
Aren't there some big changes (e.g. to Huntress hatches) that deserve testing?
---
Honestly, I respect good loops  and dodges but I'm still here to win lol
---
Oh yeah, that sounds like a good idea
---
And just like that... their honeymoon ended...
---
I've done this many times before lmao. I use No Mither, Spine Chill, Resilence, and Prove Thyself
---
Why has our comments been downvoted through the fucking floor, were speaking the truth üòÇ
---
The negative association is too great for them to just use it. It would be like having a perk called ‚Äúdomestic abuse‚Äù it‚Äôs not tasteful. Having a perk with a less catchy name is better than having a perk that could turn people off to the game.
---
I respect the mind game loops. But theres so many unmind gameable loops.

I enjoyed playing as a clothed florida man
---
You have to buy them. Cosmetics pretty much.
---
You're absolutely right
---
Ok. Well neither of us are law experts so I'll just keep my hopes up high. If Mcote says he'll make it happen then I'll just wait for it.
---
Anyway, I don't think likeness is the same thing as character, which you keep brining up.
---
Yes but windows and pallets are against him, so it is kind of a mind game. He is easily loopable as he is now.
---
It just keeps getting worse and worse
---
that is an insult
---
late hook + 250, entity summoned + 200, late sacrifice + 500. Multiplied by BBQ.
---
Id put money on $10
---
Nothing, it's really cool art. I made a small connection with the Axe as Huntress has one. I wanted to share with the community hoping others would also like it.
---
The whole concept of being unable to move if somebody's looking at them would completely kill the Killer.
---
Hey Karen why don't you just watch the killer whilst we all work on the gen and gen rush him. Don't forget to teabag in their face while they can't move
---
I actually got an escape exactly like how they were probably hoping: I got downed after rescuing from the basement hook and they chased the other. I had tenacity and made it into the corn. Because I didn‚Äôt bleed and grunting was 50% muffled they lost me in the corn. They even spent a solid amount of time looking for me. I got back up and got the exit door.
---
doesnt Change the fact that he shouldnt be able to instantly attack after cancelling his dash
---
I thought Quentin already did that.
---
OH MY GOD!  ‚ô•
---
Neither in the Hospital or the Game, and yet Trapper can get it done in certain spots
---
Do girls actually like that?
---
You forgot about all the 5 IQ hypocrites who bitch about 'perk X' while running a full build of meta perks.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to submit a bug report.

I'm just hoping it comes out after the chapter hits not before
---
That achievement was pretty hard. Thank god for dead hard

BOTTOM TEXT

You can unlock characters with play time, technically for free. 
---
Out of 12 DLC killers (already counting Demogorgon), 6 you can unlock for free. 
---
Out of 12 DLC survivors (already counting Steve and Nancy), 6 you can unlock for free.
---
This is for the PC version.
---
See I play as both survivor and killer so I can show interest in both parties on my thoughts.
---
yep was doing kyf and would slide right past them they need to work on the collision for the lunge
---
This was so easy to dodge tho. Like, just don't run in a straight line and you're good.
---
This is still bad if not worse.
---
For me theres the Overpowered tier that needs to be changed in some way, the tier for everyone else, then bad teir
---
&gt;You can 100% reach far through windows with it
---
that doesnt look like FEEL to me its more like IM SAYING THIS AS A FACT but ok
---
We have to be able to test all 3 tiers of the new perks.
---
I don't know if you remember it, but back when they reworked Tinkerer, there was a bug that only affected Tinkerer 2 (making it never end)
---
Thank you, someone gets it
---
They can just do a skin, Robert Englund is really passionate about the nightmare franchise and really enjoyed playing the character Freddy even appearing in Rap videos about the character back in the 90s. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if BHVR hit him up.
---
Yeah, it's a double edged sword, and made that much harder with so much demand from the players. But I'd say it really paid off in this case, especially with the Stranger Things chapter. I definitely feel like they went above and beyond with this license, and the implementation. But the appreciation of such things can sometimes feel buried with all the 'WHEN ARE WE GETTING THIS ONE THOUGH' posts :/
---
Yeah, I only focused him because of the the perk
---
Didn‚Äôt know tunneling Quentin was a thing. Any reason why?
---
Non licensed characters can be bought by grinding. But to play licensed, u need to pay
---
And yeah, most perks that u will need is in standart characters. So don't worry.
---
Aaand most op killer is free too.
---
I just wish survivors could tell the difference between  tunneling them and their own mistakes. Like is it really tunneling if I left, chase someone else, and your dumbass self decides to drop a pallet on me mid chase so your now the closest person? Or when you run straight to the nearest pig boxes and are surprised when I show up? Seriously learn how to play before accusing people of shit.

let's not start a trend of bugging people outside of BHVR for things like this though, we don't need more reasons to be scorned by the public
---
Are you telling me that was just paint or something the whole time? Damn. I'm blind.
---
With the end game collapse, I don't see how you're going to get that many stacks, then there's the fact you're dragging around a useless perk for most of the game.
---
This plus his weapon being small compared to most others adding to the visual confusion.
---
DOOM Slayer could never be a survivor, he'd kill literally every killer with his bare hands. He's just too badass.
---
Doctor equipping Infectious Fright, Distressing, Knockout and Ruin with a side of purple Calm and burning The Game offering would like to introduce himself.
---
Yes I was saying it as a fact in my opinion, doesn't mean it's right though. Do you know what opinion means?
---
I don't. I'm a rank 30 meters finding the best perk builds for me.

What people don‚Äôt seem to understand, is that both sides are toxic. I‚Äôm a survivor main, and yes it is frustrating when it seems like the killer really just wants you dead and won‚Äôt leave you alone. I understand that as the killer, you want kills. Why would you not? It‚Äôs easy to focus one survivor down and just get them out of the game. But as the survivor, it‚Äôs not very fun at all. If the killer is good and wants you dead, it feels like you barely got to play the match because the entire time, you were either running for your life, on the hook, or slugged. I‚Äôm not the type to send hate messages or even say anything to them about it at all, I just go to the next match. But some people just get so frustrated that they feel like that HAVE to complain about it and I guess calling the killer names makes them feel better, idk. As far as camping goes, it‚Äôs basically the same thing. We get so frustrated because we spent our entire match on the hook, with the killer staring at us, sometimes hitting us over and over again. It‚Äôs not fun for us. And I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs fun for the killer either, but to each their own, I guess. And after matches like that, we see that we got probably less than 6k points depending on how early the killer caught you. It‚Äôs just a wasted match to us. So yeah, survivors can be toxic and so can killers. I‚Äôve had killers bully me on hook when I did absolutely nothing that could even be considered toxic. Just did gens, saves, and ran from him, and then he catches me and decides that he‚Äôs gonna sit there and hit me for the rest of the match while I‚Äôm on hook? Yeah that‚Äôs definitely toxic. I‚Äôve also had matches once again where I did nothing toxic, was just having fun playing the game, and I‚Äôm the last survivor and I get out either through hatch or the gate if he closes hatch, then I get a message from him saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre trash get gud fucking noob‚Äù and all I did was escape. And in reality, he‚Äôs just mad that he didn‚Äôt get a 4k and decided to talk shit because of it. I have friends who will send the killer hate messages calling them trash when truthfully, they just played poorly and got caught.  I‚Äôve seen plenty of survivors tbagging and clicking flashlights at the killer, bullying him all game for no reason other than to be an asshole. This game is full of toxicity and that is never going to change in my opinion, because even when you did nothing wrong, people are assholes and it isn‚Äôt only survivors or only killers, it‚Äôs both.
---
As some anesthesiologists do.
---
Haha! Thanks for the love. Glad you like it
---
This made me laugh! Jeff Goldblum memes are the best! HAHAHA
---
Only see people running no mither to get adept David or for a challenge
---
Ok my bad thank you for clarifying
---
i've seen far more steves than nancy personally, i imagine once it goes live and scoops ahoy is live you'll see WAY more scoops steve.
---
Yes it's tunneling lol.  It just happens to be understandable tunneling since the perk works best when you do tunnel.  Good news is Dying Light is completely changing and you won't have to tunnel the obsession anymore to get it so less salt for you in the future.
---
The pig dash sucks, uncrouch is better anyways
---
Gen jockey no mither david has a good chance
---
Is that a tat on his hand ?
---
How Dare you 4 work as a Team!!!  Toxic POS!!!  REEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!
---
That's one of the reasons Dying Light is getting changed. Using it effectively is going to cause one person to have an absolutely shitty time. If you're not using it that way, you're wasting a perk. Also if you're going to make a thread everytime someone says something in the post game chat like this you're gonna be a very busy dude.
---
no, if  a boy did this to you i‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôd die
---
When the Demogorgon mori's you*
---
Hmmm
---
Killers get vision of their totems? Fun...
---
It‚Äôs almost like it isn‚Äôt broken
---
I used to regret having P3‚Äôd Quentin when he was released. Not anymore
---
He was great in Veronica Mars in the early 2000s, understated actor for sure.
---
Monto, is that you?!
---
I don't plan on it, I wanted to see how others feel about it
---
No I ment disturbed ward
---
Why did he use both them attachments on a medkit, what a waste
---
I‚Äôm a meg main big brain, David‚Äôs are usually the best teammates who get fucked over by bad luck and Claudette‚Äôs and Beas are the least helpful teammates
---
Nah, calm lowers your Terror Radius in punishment mode, so Infectious doesn't pair well with it. Do Distressing, Infectious, Knockout, Ruin, BBQ. Any of those latter three, then run something gross like Obedience so they can't exhaust their way away from you.
---
OR, if you want to see the ABSOLUTE scummery of Doctor, do Haunted Ground, Thrill, Ruin, and Huntress Lullaby/Devour Hope. 
---
Use the High Stimulus Electrode and the Interview Tape and snipe people off totems from a distance greater than your own Terror Radius.
---
Do people actually bite face like that.
---
hhmmm ok you are changing the point of what we were talking about because you fucked yourself by saying FEEL when you actually said it can hit through windows with 100% confirmation by you making you saying your statement of it FEELING ironic, sorry if i used FACT incorrectly but still, you done fucked
---
W... what's wrong with his feet? Are they... rotting?
---
Sounds like 90% of my games xD
---
Not really, but I've had a really infuriating game against a plague once. I refused to cleanse (cause' if your a survivor, that's what you do), however, the P3 Nea, P2 Feng, and baby Dweet, all cleansed. Thing was, the Plague was really shit. But, with 1 gen left, almost 6 fountains ready to be purged, she found me, vomited some nice red christmas lights onto me, in the basement, got farmed, decisived. Still, 1 gen left, I found a gen, 99%, and then a string of red christmas lights come flying over to me, killing me. Up onto the hook, gen pops, both gates open, around 20 seconds left, plague on the opposite side of the map, and dead.
---
Solo ques, aren't fun.
---
Must not have browsed Reddit much
---
the concept is that it makes no one left behind an alternative to we‚Äôre going to live forever. considering it‚Äôs so bad no one would consider it in its current state i‚Äôm fine with making a farm perk, if likely inferior to wglf you can run both so
---
This meme is painfully true...
---
The only thing that I want is different ultra rare addons. They usually throw a twist into the killers power, but right now they dont change the power that much. Other than that the demogorgon is in a good spot.
---
All killers have identical lunge/swing ranges (except Tier 1&amp;3 Myers and Nurse who have different lunge ranges but identical swing ranges) This means that even though Freddy‚Äôs  a t-rex armed manlet swinging his nail extensions at you, he has identical reach as the 12‚Äô20‚Äù Huntress swinging an ax as tall as the survivors she‚Äôs killing.  This is to make killers more uniform so that it‚Äôs easier to balance them and easier to pick up new killers (though, personally, I wouldn‚Äôt mind having a few killers with different stats on their basic attacks to make the gameplay more diverse.  Having a killer with a wider but shorter basic attack, or one with a longer lunge but a shorter basic swing, etc.)
---
Check pinned post
---
Used to do it when I first started for the gen jockey
---
On endgame collapse with the opened door 3 meters away? Nothing else he could have done, the Leatherface was securing his only kill (he failed miserably but not much else he could have done here).
---
This is the truth
---
Robin... is looking very happy about it tho. Maybe she already knows? You know, because she's homosexual, then the demogorgon must be a female... idk what I was thinking...
---
Demigorgon got your tongue?
---
I'd put this on my wall as a poster.
---
did you just assume demogorgon‚Äôs gender?
---
Apart = separate from 
---
A part = what you're looking to say
---
Ye definitely. The only time I really use it now is for bait or to close distance.
---
Mjr. Chip Hazard for Killer
---
*assume the position*
---
cool mori, but i still think this game would be awesome with an optional higher gore setting.
---
This is beatiful, oh my...
---
Props to the artist!
---
the distance gained seems minimal with the amount of time lost to the stun
---
BHVR said back in a dev stream when Nightmare was released something like the remake Freddy was the only one available to them to be licensed since they're still trying to push him as the new Freddy
---
That‚Äôs when I proceed to let them try to get out while shaking my head to down them after(to the toxic cunts)
---
and it ignores collision, has incredibly further range both horizontally, and vertically \[and can move vertically\], can lunge out of it in any direction you chose with a stupid hurtbox, and can do it at a base 2 times in a row, if not way more with addons. And a killer shouldn't be balanced so that they're overpowered without addons, and then even more so with addons. they should be good without addons and better with addons.
---
also demogorgons does have to "charge" in the process of a few animations, and does have a cooldown when you miss, just not as long as nurses \[unless nurse runs addons\]
---
Hentai waiting to happen.
---
Nea is beautiful tho
---
Hmmmm
---
Yeah who needs game mechanics when breaking them is so much more fun
---
It depend on an scp to scp basis. For the most part, the scps aren't copyrighted and are just creepypastas, however, there are some scps that use copyrighted material for their photos. For example, I'm pretty sure that scp-173 is actually a photo of an art piece, so you would have to get the rights for it's likeness.
---
Yes, I can feel the nuclear waste coursing through my veins! Thank you, stranger.
---
The hitting is not wonky. It‚Äôs hard and new. It needs practice just like billy. May seem hard for people who never played him. But it‚Äôs not
---
You need to adapt and learn.
---
They literally can't hit good skill checks without perks at that level lol!  Survivors are insanely bad at that rank.
---
Flashlights are the survivor equivalent to a trapper who doesn't lay down traps, not something to actually care about. If you are halfway decent you will never be blinded, and at least one person is going around wasting time.
---
Ehhhh idk about that, some of my friends who just picked up the game only suck for their first 2-5 games
---
Demo discussion aside, I‚Äôm so excited to play Hag on the new map. So many tight corridors, hallways, entrances/exits, oh god
---
Always give the no mither the hatch if it‚Äôs a 4k. Unless you‚Äôre going for the achievement. Give them nothing if you‚Äôre shooting for that.
---
demo's lunge is weak and honestly overrated, it's super easy to juke and only useful if the survivors run in a straight line/are in an open area. Also it's buggy as hell- demo has lunged OVER me a multitude of times when only slightly above me in vertical space, not to mention the times it absolutely should have hit but just didn't. 
---
if anything it needs a buff, but since they have portals to compensate, i think it should be fine the way it is, maybe a TINY bit of tweaking on the buff side, but not substantially enough to make the lunge the centerpiece of the killer.
---
I did this yesterday in the Preschool (you can hit totems in the basement area from above ground BTW). I stood near a house and a Meg in shack kept touching a totem til I shocked her into madness 3 then she disconnected.
---
I mean he could have ran towards the exit to chase the other guys out, allowing Third guy to get save and then chase the last two, possibly getting two kills. 
---
I get that there‚Äôs not much killer can do when they have someone hooked by an exit gate but I still don‚Äôt like camping
---
r/dbdgonewild is a crused land, don't click it, click r/dbdgonegay instead

I'll file this under things that didn't happen

Survivor bad, killer good
---
Hm ok that makes sense
---
yeah she'll be scary to play against on it for sure.
---
...
---
I wanna see Jerry Seinfeld as a survivor now.
---
Numbness will subside in a moment
---
Uhh it‚Äôs exactly what it looks like
---
I dunno about that, I just always assumed the devs never even approached any of the original actors, hence why Kyle didn't even know Quentin was in the game till release.
---
This is the best comment today LOL
---
Anecdote: my sister met him at a con and said he was the nicest damn guy and taking a picture with Freddy was an absolute treat.
---
Demogorgan just separate the two and ate simple to remember
---
Your friends are way above the curve then man.  It isn't even an opinion yellow rank survivors are infamously terrible at the game survivor has a bigger learning curve than killer at that rank and the majority will plow skillchecks be them repair or heal throughout the game.
---
It makes sense for huntress as a range attack to have a dampening penalty and the demogorgan as a semi medium-short pounce to not have one. Both ‚Äúlore wise‚Äù since it‚Äôs a creature and mechanics wise. I think most killers should be around where Billy/Huntress/Freddy are and the Demogorgan is looking great. Good to great map pressure and decent/high kill potential. Unlike the other killers that only have one decent area
---
Her voice sounds very Royalty/Sophisticated like her lore would imply. I like it
---
Nah, survivors are better.
---
Oh wow ok thank you so much! I knew the beginning was demo just wasn't sure how the rest of it was spelled lol!
---
Depends where I am, if i can get to a pallet before the survivor ill use it or if I have the high ground and i see a survivor going to a gen/hook save, ill use it to launch myself over to that direction
---
Your welcome 
---
Also I‚Äôd recommend watching it it‚Äôs a good series
---
No, they didn‚Äôt go far enough
---
you get 4000 bloodpoints if u are unhooking someone when the exit gates are opened. I am very satisfied with that already.
---
I've managed to escape as no mither against spirit before
---
then that would just be "using it" not gaining ground
---
There are 2 types of people
---
Actually lately the blood hunts been coming out before the chapters.
---
You can hit them though. Literally nothing can be done to counter this.
---
Is ash even a playable survivor???? Would be awesome if not
---
[Naughty Nancy likes it in the bootyhole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-08iFX8ScI4)
---
Lol you think hitting will stop body blocking. oof
---
Demogorgon: oh god oh fuck
---
Gotta get them struggle points
---
I agree. Hopefully the devs will fix it one day.
---
Ez karma
---
And nookie.
---
I think that‚Äôs just a bug unfortunately, happens a lot with the game crashing. looks pretty cool though
---
Jerry Seinfeld Teachable Perk:
---
Cold Open
---
At the start of the match you gain 3 charges. Each charge can trap a hook, causing it to break when a killer tries to hook someone. Trapped hooks have a small visual tell, highlighted for survivors and difficult to see for killers.
---
Breaking a hook on a killer causes them to become stunned for 2/4/6 seconds.
---
Layer of Mud
---
I love Trapper mind games. Simple but effective.
---
It does? Two hits and they go down. Just keep hitting them.
---
The best advice is to try them all out and see what works best for your play style. I'm not running the same perks I ran in my first year or second. I adapt to the killers meta. 
---
One of the best perks I've used lately is Kindred. It lets other players know NOT to rush/farm my hook and work on gens. I'm really digging some of Nancy's perks. Since I always cleanse tokens, I don't need to bring in self care as the closet works. Especially against BBQ.
---
This happened to me too a while ago... i got t-bagged by them so hard
---
Weird. Never really noticed that part of the design. I kinda thought it was like...bark.
---
no surprise there haha
---
That‚Äôs just Freddy‚Äôs incredible stretching arm action.
---
Lotta weird shit in dream world.
---
Really hope that's not the case this time I've been sitting on a million bloodpoints for a while and even if I were to spend them I've got every perk on my mains already so I would literally be only doing it for killer add-ons as I don't see much point putting points in Min as she also has every perk and if I wanted items I could just do a loot build
---
Not even a Ghostface main, man. I can't main a single killer. It would get too boring. I love Ghostface for all the cheeky shit I can do on inside maps, though.
---
Thanks for the info, now it makes a lot more sense.
---
Okay but youre assuming i'm right next to a hook. A lot of the maps you have walk a bit to a hook and by the time you get there a quick body block fucks you over. And what if they have borrowed time or insta heal?
---
I need context on this scene.
---
lmao the way he's just standing there looking defeated
---
No I did not have that problem even though I deinstalled and installed it again I stall had the progress. But its not that bad because progress wont get transferred to live servers anyway.
---
If Hillbilly can't have that happen then the Demo shouldn't either. Billy needs to be punished way more for using his power then he is.
---
No problem. Hopefully you can edit the post since it‚Äôs kind of misinformation.
---
Huh?
---
gonna need this as a cosmetic
---
&gt; ‚ÄúStraight forward‚Äù
---
I see what you did there
---
And he is playing on console it would appear
---
Trapper...is op? I don't think Tofu is the one who saids that as he is decent.
---
That's just evil.
---
epic and funny
---
WHEN BLOOD HUNT
---
I think he was going for the grab but wasn't close enough, or took too long
---
I love his power at the moment! I think the only thing I'd tweak is *maybe* make the portals take a little longer to destroy? They're not gone SUPER quick but I dunno it feels slightly too fast. Only slightly, though.
---
Also maybe add just another second onto the "undetectable" when leaving a portal - the duration is pretty much nothing. 
---
But overall I love this killer so much, I'm gonna be P3-ing him for SURE
---
That sounds like a good way to have a all 4 survivors  escape, because as a killer you don't know the survivors perks, the rescuer could have borrowed time and the person off the hook is 100 % safe, or the rescued could have ds and is100 % safe (and if the killer eats it both are out with time to spare). You may not like to camp, but don't blame people for trying to get a kill in this situation.
---
when the map has 18 super safe pallets back to back and your Ruin can't even save you:
---
I kind of felt bad for him then. Only a little bit tho
---
Because if survivors try to bodyboock, hunters can just drop the survivor, slug the survivor, equip Mad Grit, etc. When a hunter tries ro bodyblock in a way that hurts the game experience as opposed to deepening it (like bodyblocking a Jigsaw box or the Thompson house staircase, as opposed to merely bodyblocking pallets/vaults/etc.), there's no way to physically move the killer without their permission.
---
The difference between getting bodyblocked as a killer and as a survivor is that killers can counterplay.
---
With that said she referred to Hillbilly as "Angry Groot" so we also need to contact Marvel about cosmetics
---
Yeah I was thinking about kindred, yeah I should try perks tho. Thanks man!
---
Gotta blast!
---
Thanks to all for the comments guys, I endend uo buying the game. We'll see noe :D
---
P3 quentin would look so good.

Alternate version to hopefully make it a bit easier to tell.
---
This is a salt-bot, guys. Ignore/block this thing.
---
Designed to spew out biased comments that are barely comprehensive in the context of the conversation, but cause you to WANT to respond and try to reson with it, it gets what it wants.
---
I waited it out. I messaged back that the game kicked me (even though it didnt) and just waited for him to leave lol
---
Why would he use the chainsaw? Worst play ive ever seen
---
Tbh, he looks like mint rag hag, with killer instinct, and a better pig lunge. So basically play him with your eyes open and you'll be fine. On a more serious note. Put portals where you know you'll need to be, that being totems, gens, or points of interest. Then activate them and walk around the map checking killer instinct by tapping your leap on and off. Aside from that, just learn your leap range/timing and you'll be fine.
---
You litteraly said u don't see a difference YOU SAID THAT
---
So what ur trying tell me is that dropping a survivor completely ends ur game INSTANTLY opens the doors and u loose? cuz this kind of body blocking ends the survivors game
---
You should run Bond instead of Self Care and Empathy, it kind of takes the place of both perks as you can see survivors and have them heal you, far faster than self care, you can also see survivors getting chased at 1/3 the distance.
---
he's pretty tough if you don't have the perks to delay the game long enough to get kills.  he just doesn't have enough mobility to stop gens from going down quickly
---
Thank you for not teabagging a LF who is already dying inside. +respect
---
Now closed mouth so it looks like a scrotum
---
I didn't say I was good at DBD. I never said you can't counter play it. I know what perks do. I shouldn't need crutch perks as a killer. It's why every uses Ruin because this game isnt balanced for shit.
---
I SAW A POST A WHILE BACK THAT THEIR WAS GONNA BE A BLOOD HUNT STARTING TODAY UNTIL MONDAY BUT NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT IT SO I DONT THINK ITS ACTUALLY GONNA HAPPEN WHY WOULD SOMEONE SPREAD FALSE INFORMATION
---
No friend. The difference is more experienced players who better understand the game and its mechanics. On both sides.
---
Killers can reach through Windows. 
---
You don't have to be vaulting, or even up against the window/wall. Just as long as you are close enough that, if the wall and window wasn't there, they would be able to hit you.
---
In case you haven't noticed, there is a special interaction with windows, that you can see with Billy's chainsaw, where the killer can reach through if the weapon could hit, and it hits the wall if there is nobody there to hit. Billy charging at a window hits it like there is no window, but Billy charging a window with a survivor on the other side, and he doesn't hit the window, he reached his full reach through the window.
---
Edit: Autocorrect, in my car, wearing sunglasses. I'll leave the mistakes.
---
They nerfed Ghostface? When? I thought that he was buffed from the joke he was on the previous PTB.
---
Your next goal is 69 and 666.
---
Why is this happening. What is going on.
---
i knowwwww. im hoping they do something really good for himü§ûüèªü§ûüèª
---
.....Yeeees... that was... intentional
---
Thanks man, this post is good. Although it still doesn't mean they won't be able to change Quentin's model, it's still a lot of stuff to arrange with no guarantees.
---
Licensing is never easy. That's why I don't envy guys working on Star Wars games, it must be really tedious at times.
---
It depends on if they quit through the menu or not.  If they quit normally, the survivors get any points they earned so far plus 5k survival.  Otherwise, they get 0.
---
I agree, probably solid mid tier like the demo itself.
---
It was unconfirmed. I thought it was this weekend too but nothing was ever confirmed.
---
‚ÄúYOU ARE SUCH A BAD TEAMATE!‚Äù
---
Different license holders for original Englund Freddy? Really? New Line own both iterations of the character, surely there‚Äôd be no need to seek out a separate license holder?
---
i'd rather have slower gens than 1 hit downs and free moris thank you very much!!
---
YES!!!!! This meme is on point! I was so excited about Quentin when he first came out, and was quickly disappointed by his creepy face! Can't wait to use him again!
---
I got tbagged by the rank 3 in this match :( Like chill, I'm just here for the better bp payout killers get
---
its from stranger things. billy is trapped in the sauna and his sister is outside. the reasoning behind how they got there is the spoilery part
---
No detection perks work on Tier 1 Myers. Spine Chill, Premonition, Object of Obsession, Alert, you name it- Michael is immune to all of it.
---
You want them to just let you hook them and kill them for free? Trying to survive is toxic, right?
---
Not to mention a tunneler!!!!11 :((I((
---
I bet you think flashlight saves and pallet saves aren't "skillful" either.
---
Body blocking to prevent a killer from hooking someone is fine, body blocking to get a guaranteed chainsaw or hatchet attack on someone is fine. Body blocking to hold the game hostage is not.
---
Are you new here? Ash is definitely playable in left for dead
---

---

---
Lol I‚Äôm talking about dead by daylight first of all and second what is going on
---
Dr Denim - I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about this.
---
So all survivors is annoying too?
---
I had a rough idea of how many factors there were, but goddamn I didn‚Äôt think it was quite this complicated. Thank you for the information!
---
I‚Äôm very curious as to what game you were referring to. It sounds like it was a project from hell with all the previous complications!
---
do you play on low settings? if not, change it to low. most people and streamer do that.
---
Body blocking is toxic. Survivors already get favored. They have a million other ways to live. Stop being so dense.
---
Hell no if I've been working on gens and running the killer around all game and I see you Urban Evasion around the map doing nothing at all. please believe you are going to die, YOU DON'T DESERVE HATCH IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING !
---
I know the feels. I love how Myers held the T-pose for the arm stretch.
---
That chainsaw!
---
Ah shit, I didn‚Äôt mean left for dead. Ash is playable in dead by daylight.
---
Maybe they might do a face scan?
---
Here‚Äôs hoping they actually improved something
---

---
No they don't, it's a super cute dress. Every character has multiple outfits that are "out of character" for them.
---
I don't remember how many points I got yesterday but I did 3 1/2 gens,  3 saves,  4 heals, healed myself, clensed totems, ran the killer,  only got hooked once,  escaped and STILL didn't pip. Pretty sure i was around 30k as well. I was so confused by it. Guess we have to do all 5 gens,  every save,  every heal, and run the killer somehow lol. I know it's hard to pip in red ranks, but this is a little ridiculous.
---
Shit I get them all the time while playing Myers on PS4, I‚Äôve had them 6ft in front of me and hit the button by accident and it connected! All green ping and I‚Äôm on a 100mb wired connection. If it‚Äôs a shit hit I walk away whistling like nothing happened. Unless they have been a toxic ass, then I hookem!
---
The character of original Freddy was created by Wes Craven. The movie about his creation was produced by New Line. The person that played him was hired by both.
---
The character of Remake Freddy was NOT created by Wes Craven, simply based off of a character created by him. The actor was NOT hired by the original writers/creators. The only thing that stayed the same was the production company.
---
A single person does not hold a piece of paper that says 'This gives anyone I want permission to use everything in this movie I funded'.
---
This is why people are so clueless as to what is going on with the F13 court case. There many MANY more hands that movies and characters go through than just the production company, and one single person does not get to decide everything.
---
Lmao I hate that glitch
---
That was fast.
---
I know, the friendly killer glitch is so strange XD
---
I was thinking more the new players - Steve's a clear fan favorite, tenfold, so I'm thinking that the experienced players will be running Nancy, but if this thing sells like hotcakes, the Steves will absolutely show up in force once the new players show up
---
Yeah and then just start again if you only hit a good, so many games I spent running around the map for no reason when I first started.
---
All the time. It's really frustrating.
---
Which one Trump's the other, T1 Evil Within or Kindred?
---
There‚Äôs a face rework?

---
Inb4 racist
---
&gt;I was seriously curious how hitboxes are in this PTB but this is quality content haha
---
Hitboxes are the same since they have never been the major reason why some hits connected even if the distance was considerable. 
---
Also because ping is still a thing on PTB, most of the hits are still the same and won't be fixed ever. 
---
The only thing that needs fixing is people going around saying wrong stuff about hitboxes and try to become educated on how ping / latency works.
---
Oh dat good
---
BHVR would have to ask the license holders if they can use Classic Freddy instead of the remake. 
---
Classic Freddy was a cosmetic for MKX Mobile, so it‚Äôs possible, it would most likely just come down to price.
---
&gt;"Dedicated Servers Should Fix Hitboxes."
---
-Said no one ever.
---
Wow you were totally stepping on the dangerous ground here man. I'm not sure I really agree with all you're proposing here, but I still like the fresh ideas.
---
Why would Billy be on the hook? Isn't he a killer? 
---
I'm here all evening.
---
Geez downer
---
You're incorrect, and I have the receipts. It was actually confirmed in Dev Q&amp;A session 5 on October 26th 2018 that Survive with Friends was always intended and not due to some made up "outcry".
---
Source: https://youtu.be/gTpZSllfMmw
---
9:30 is the part in the video you'd be most interested in.
---
You're welcome.
---
Jesus why does anybody think that?! It was never Official confirmed. The devs also destroyed that fake
---
wow!! It's really good.
---
I‚Äôll give my left nut for Classic Freddy

And that my friend is not how you argue. That's how you make a shitstorm.

Best tip i can give you: play both sides. You'll understand the game as a whole that way. Not just one side of it.
---
In spectator Mode ui bugs sometimes happening. It's classic
---
Pig's power is very flawed tbh, it's never reliable due to luck and sometimes bs like this can happen
---
My favourite killers are the ones whose power is just a power fantasy. I fucking love micheal because his insta down + increased lunge and vault speed make him so damn intimidating to survivors and the demos lunge is also really fucking spooky and deadly.
---
I'd do another exhaustion perk for lithe, I bought it in the shrine but I've found if you make a vault you make it and hardly need a sprint burst after. AND if a killer hits you through that vault it uses your lithe. And dark sense is getting a buff so I think its gonna be a much better perk now! Now anytime a gen is completed you see the killer. Also kindred is a must have for solo survivors hahah
---
She a freak
---
Once, I was in a game with a no mither David. When he got downed at some point, I was very close by and luckily managed to get the killers attention. I looped him long enoigh for the David to recover and get away. I didn't survive the match, but I'm glad to say David made it to the hatch in time. It was beautiful.
---
Wait is that the killers Mori ?

The "Evolve" Gorgon! I played her exclusively for quite awhile. Such a good game ruined by such shitty practices. Makes me sad every time I think about it. :(
---
Not monsters exactly, but I feel like they could either do The Predator or Alien

WHAT MAKES IT WORSE IS WHEN YOU SWITCH TO SURVIVOR... LIKE, HAHA, I TOO SHALL GO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A LOW-LEVEL TO FARM SOME BLOOD POINTS!
---
... WAIT. WHAT IS THIS? A RANK 3 KILLER, WITH ME, RANK 12, A RANK 15, AND TWO RANK 20'S?!

Only time I camp is when I'm trying to secure the kill in EGC. Only once in a while will I get a message from that. What do they expect me to do? Hook someone then run away from the door?
---
I won't even camp toxic survivors. But I will tunnel you when you're being a douche.
---
it would be nice if slow down perks didn't feel necessary for sure
---
&gt;Looks at forums well I think they'd beg to differ Pompous Laugh
---
I mean... no one with a brain would say that but if you want to use people with zero technical knowledge about the issue I bet you can find a few hundreds posts.
---
Like this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d00le0/hitboxes_what_are_those/
---
Uhh sprint burst is op? Ok then...
---
...it's flaired "suggestion".
---
He's stronger than Billy. Basically 115% short range huntress without reloads and an unmissable hatchet, that can't be thrown over pallets or through gaps. Way fast than Billy, without the instadown but you shut out a wider variety of tiles.
---
It's a strong power, but it should require more precision if you're using it right as you obtain it, and a tiny bit more punish for cancelling it. Fun killer, easy to juke bad survivors, but he's like double engravings billy basekit, with a map control power on top.
---
News to me.
---
I BOUGHT BBQ, TOOK MYERS FROM 1-30, CLOWN FROM 11-28, AND DOCTOR FROM 9-25. KNOW WHAT HASN'T FUCKING POPPED ONCE?
---
BBQ. THIS GREAT PERK I'VE HEARD ABOUT, AND WANTED FOR THE FOUR MONTHS I'VE BEEN PLAYING. THIS PERK I DROPPED 2000 SOME ODD SHARDS ON. OVER 50 BLOODWEBS, NOT A SINGLE FUCKING BBQ.
---
wym? its aura is revealed?
---
No worries! All good c:
---
Oh no, Meg has the power of ZA WAURDO!
---
awesome!
---
Yeah, Gorgon was one of my favorites too. I leaned more towards Meteor Goliath though (love dose DPS characters). 
---
It's still my favorite asym. But sadly, now I mostly play against bots in Legacy.
---
Yeah, so many things lead to it's downfall. You could say that it was doomed from launch. So unfortunate.
---
I was going to make a comment but yours pretty much encapsulates what I was gonna say. I‚Äôm just gonna add that bond is more useful than empathy in most situations.
---
Pig main here! Bad post op
---
I bought her and was kind of underwhelmed
---
Totally agree. I‚Äôve been stuck at rank 3 for 3-4 days now because it‚Äôs taking that long.
---
IT SUCKS, MAN, THE HIGHER YOU CLIMB, THE MORE BONED YOU ARE WHEN YOU TRY TO LEARN SOMEONE NEW. I GOT TO RANK 12 ON MY PEEPS, AND NOW GOD FORBID I TRY SOMEONE NEW.
---
Her eyes aren't blue otherwise cute .
---
Oh so I guess the developers don't have brains either considering they did say Dedicated Servers should fix the hitbox issues. Which as I've seen in the PTB isn't the case, killers are hitting people who aren't even in their grasp but go off
---
I'm getting tired of explaining to some Survivors that when I can hear AND see Survivors roaming around the basement I won't just go and walk away from it. What is the other choice I have in that situation? Leave the basement to go to gens that aren't even getting repaired and allow Survivors to just unhook and heal? Oh well, they'll still say that I am a trash shitty camping tunneler boosted Killer that should just die in a fire to make the world a better place (someone actually told me that) so I guess that it's better to just say "gg" and move on.
---
Sorry for the rant, it's just that sometimes you get tired of shit like that happening. This is a great meme btw.
---
as someone who uses the pig quite often, this really pisses me off.  who does that? how is that fun?  do you feel accomplished in your win?
---
No Dead Hard? Low ranks confirmed lol
---
And the 50% Iron Will is useless if you‚Äôre actually in red ranks the killer will mop you, doubt you are
---
Nice! Xbox is pretty hard to play at green, purple and red ranks.
---
After 2 hits. Yes I do.
---
What does it mean??
---
Laws are weird. And just because more violent games exist doesnt mean they havent had to deal with laws and possibly being banned. 
---
No ones Mori leaves behind altered models. Billy and Wraith would split them in half, Trapper massive chunks of spine.
---
... IF YOU SEE SOMEONE GOT DOWNED TRYING TO UNHOOK, WHY WOULD YOU SHOOT OVER THERE?
---
LIKE, WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN, NEA? DIDN'T WANT DWIGHT AND MEG TO BE LONELY LYING ON THE GROUND? SERIOUSLY WHY.
---
THREE MINUTES INTO THE GAME, DWIGHT GETS HOOKED... FIVE MINUTES IN, DWIGHT IS BACK ON THE HOOK, MEG'S ON THE HOOK, AND NEA IS SLUGGED.
---
WITH EXACTLY ONE GEN DONE.
---
I know this is a trendy thing to say now, and that people aren't thinking about it, but this phrase is poking fun at trans people. Unless that's your intention, I'd suggest finding a new catch phrase.
---
Huntress: fuck I won't hit him let me take a sec to put my hatchet on my belt or whatever.
---
Demogorgon: though I'm a predator/killing machine with no human instinct or reason the act of raising my arms and lowering them compels me to slow down.
---
I never understood the lego meme. Anyone ever step on the plug in part for a cord? Way WAY worse.
---
\*Obligatory Loud Noise Warning\*
---
i dont feel like its too survivor sided. theres a few drop downs near vaults so killers can get to the ground faster and some vaults are set up to make you fail. theres also a room or 2 that are total traps lol the pallets are completely unsafe. excited to try a few killers on the map once its live on console.
---
Play with your Food is your friend
---
Using Nurse as a comparsion is dumb and everyone knows it.
---
Does anyone have the discord link
---
And some assholes even unplug their internet cables, so you don't get any points at all.
---
same game, why?
---
ALWAYS GO CLOCKWISE, HUG THE WALL, TAP YOUR A AND D KEYS RATHER THAN MOUSING THE TURNS, AND KEEP LOOKING BEHIND YOU FOR THE RED STAIN. LOOPING DEPENDS ON KNOWING WHERE THE KILLER IS/IS GOING.
---
HOPE THIS HELPS.
---
ALSO IF IT DOESN'T HELP... PLAY FENG. SHE'S GOT A WHOLE BUILD AROUND ALWAYS KNOWING WHEN/WHERE THE KILLER IS COMING, ALLOWING YOU TO AVOID THE KILLER MOST THE TIME.
---
Tbh I like when I'm dying light. It usually means a baby Micheal and I get a major altruism boost. Hooray
---
Because Nurse is broken OP so its unfair to compare them to her.
---
Bubba and Billy actually have an add-on that makes their chainsaw larger.
---
I'd let the demogorgon do it, it's the only action I'll ever get!
---
YOU SHOULD PLAY AS SURVIVOR ONCE ... ONCE. THEN YOU'D KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE. BUT WAHHHHH
---
lol why did you do this? this is not what the guy said.
---
With Ghostface (who's very simple but very representative of his movies), reworked Freddy (the visuals of him teleporting are *amazing*), and now Demogorgon I'm very hyped for the upcoming year for DBD. Behavior has really learnt a lot and are making well-balanced (the past 3 Killers listed are solid mid tiers for me) and well visually designed characters. Steve and Nancy also look very impressive which gives me good hopes for the Survivor-side too.
---
Along with some tweaks to old content (rework Haddonfield *please!*) I think Year 3 will easily be one of the best years for this game!
---
Sorry was sleeping but yea I just feel stun could be longer making it a little more risky giving survivors more distance if you mess up
---
Every high rank killer will expect dead hard on a no mither survivor - makes more sense to use another exhaustion perk.
---
This is interesting, it made me think about how there isn't a "good" force in this game, it's just the Entity, just its unending game.
---
:)
---
Just type it in google it‚Äôs the first thing that comes up
---
Eh yes and no, Pigs dash is bigger than the regular lunge and you're able to control it so technically it isn't a regular m1. It's weird on what and what isn't considered as a M1
---
Dont think too hard now
---
The time it takes to destroy a portal is in line with everything else.
---
You only get notified if you use your M2, and you don't have it on all the time so you can easily miss half the progress. 
---
Also add-ons should not be a basis for dictating a killer base power. If an add-on makes a part of his power only *serviceable* instead of too fast / too short, then the base needs a small buff.
---
Again - I cannot stress this enough - SMALL buff.
---
I mean it's pretty brain dead and basically a free hit on corridors or open areas. Imagine fighting him on Shelter Woods which is almost completely empty.
---
At the very least it should have a longer stun time so it's punishing if you somehow misuse it
---
I could of sworn the other day on the wiki it said DBP was 8th &amp; 9th September?!
---
What's the "everything else" here?
---
*Spine Chill intensifies*
---
Don't be a douche. Killers are already running BBQ, Ruins and all other player handicaps w. him. The killer is fine the way he is. It's the player who need to get better.
---
I guess bhvr just hates min maxers and people who try to win, because its just a wAcKy rAndOm spooKY paRtY gAmmE wooOoOoo
---
It's not a one way street in DBD. Survivors and Killers do enough toxic shit in this game to make any new player quit.
---
It's happeniiiinnngnggng 
---
Omg!!
---
Hits too close to home
---
Imagine thinking someone is toxic just by the killer they play. It's all about the play style that makes someone toxic. Not the character.
---
Kill it with fire.
---
Wow that looks pretty good in-game I expected it to look worse and it isn't just red it actually has some of the demogorgons actually skin visible
---
I camp toxic survivors. If you tea bag me repeatedly, then I will have a staring contest with you at the hook. it's an even trade.
---
Thank god theres only one useless blindness addon, unlike with rework freddy üòî
---
Yeah I keep telling folks Dedicated Servers isn't going to fix a damn thing. DeDicAtEd SuRvUrZ wiLL WeRk
---
Agreed its really not worth it if there are particular killers or survivors you want, only way to get them without spending money so.
---
Imagine taking seriously a comment from a random person online
---
Yeah it worked, I accidentally opened it through steam and I tgot me in. I don't know why It doesn't work with task bar though, its faster than going into steam
---
So in short the devs don't even know what they're talking about
---
My experience is Bill is either the best or worst survivor on the team.
---
It's not really ultra rare worthy
---
Or just get the 4k and make sure no one gets to the higher ranks.
---
I always assume something much, much worse is coming if the killer didn't turn on ruin
---
Cursed üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
First thing that comes to mind is totems. Since most killers are running ruin lately, it's really easy to tell the difference.
---
y not.... both??
---
Like.... put portals near gens. Use them to teleport to other generator portals. Instant map pressure. The portals also tell you if someone is near them, and the portals themselves act as a delay like you said. No reason to avoid using the portals, unless you are REALLY adamant on not having them cleansed.
---
People just can't believe you can't fix lag...
---
Trust me I am always leaning towards killers on a regular basis and I will always say that I want to keep her as a viable option.
---
The thing with Nurse is that she ignores the whole design of DbD which is based on finding save spots in a chase (being windows and pallets). She just completely circumvents this formula by being the way she is.
---
And let's be honest playing her really isn't that hard once you get your distances down.
---
Playing trapper is a guilty pleasure. He's really shit and gets completely destroyed by good survivors but oh dear he's soo fun to play
---
It's because of easy anti cheat can't load without opening though steam.
---
The addons are functional but kind of lame, none of them change the way he is played in any way except red moss, and even then not too much is changed.
---
Or... you know... you could teach your friends how to deal with campers instead of trying to find ways to troll killers in a potentially bannable way (holding the game hostage when the killer has no way to trigger EGC). 
---
When I brought my friends to DBD and started SWFing with them, the first 10 campers we faced they used to complain and curse a lot. Each time I tried to teach them how to deal with campers and after a few hours of session, they started being thankful whenever we got a camper because it was often a free win.
---
Against a camper you rush gens. You save with borrowed time and switch places to buy more time. You unhook tech to bait out a hit instead of being grabbed. You bodyblock the killer while taking a hit so another survivor can perform a save. If the killer tunnels whoever got unhooked with borrowed time, that person tries to punish him as much as possible with looping.
---
THANK YOU FOR THE ADVICE, I CAN SEE WHERE SOME OF MY MISTAKES ARE NOW.
---
 I ONLY HAVE 2 SURVIVORS AT LEVEL 40 AND ONE AT LEVEL 25 BUT I'LL WORK ON FENG NEXT.
---
I'm the same way.  Even though I main a stealthy survivor, I always end up salty, and it's usually my own team that pisses me off the most.  People will:
---
1.  Let you die on first hook
---
2.  Not do gens
---
3.  DC the second after they go down
---
4.  Farm you off the hook without BT
---
5.  Run the killer to the gen you're doing
---
6. *Never* stop running and wanting to constantly follow you, leaving scratch marks everywhere you go
---
The list goes on.  I pretty much don't play without Bond, and it's really an eye-opening perk that shows you how much your own team screws you over.
---
Or a "Civilian" pose you non source1 engine user
---
Why would you have an option for regular chase music? Mikey doesn't.
---
I'M A 12 SURVIVOR VERSUS 13 KILLER DUDE.
---
UNLESS YOU'RE PLAYING ON YOUR GRANDPA'S OLD TV FROM THE '70S... IT TAKES UP A SMALL CIRCULAR BLIP FOR LIKE TEN SECONDS.
---
EITHER WAIT THE TEN SECONDS, OR  LOOK AT THE SURROUNDING AREA AND RUN THE RISK.
---
"OH IT'S NOT FAIR KILLERS HAVE A THING THAT MILDLY INCONVENIENCES ME! WAH! ASYMMETRICAL? WHAT'S THAT? DON'T MAKE ME PUT EFFORT IN! YOU DON'T AGREE WITH ME? WAH, YOU MUST BE KILLER ALWAYS! WAH!"
---
Do you have all the Survivor teachables unlocked? If not it‚Äôd be best to level up some other Survivors to get them as the Chapter likely won‚Äôt be released for another 2 weeks so you‚Äôll have more than enough time to grind more BP.

I remember this exact meme when spirit was first added to the game smh
---
He's standard speed atm but I heard theres something weird about his walk cycle or something that makes him feel off. That's unsubstantiated at the moment though.
---
FUCKING PREACH IT, BRO.
---
I was confused for a moment when I saw this post too. I was starting at the blood web wondering what made Boil Over 3 so great. Like was it his last perk? How were we supposed to know that?   
---
Anyways, 'grats on Rank 1, OP.
---
I don't use Dead Hard since I'm going for a gen rush set. No Mither keeps me injured while Resilence give me a 6% speed increase in repairing, opening gates, etc. plus Prove Thyself for more speed to gen rush.
---
We do rush gens.  3 make it out.  1 doesnt wanna play anymore. Nice fix?  But you're wrong on your attempt to "fix" the issue at hand.  You lose players everyday, and their pathetic attempt at remarketing old killers simply wont save the game from bad players.
---
Its Jonathan byers lmao
---
yeeeaaa.. sure I thought about the same thing when seeing that. I wasn¬¥t thinking about that dbd is a really buggy mess. not at all
---
I thought it was meant to look like the actor, in Quentin's case, though? I mean, I agree with everything you say here, but outside of the new Stranger Things patch, the face modeling in DBD has always been a little spooky. Or maybe the texturing, I'm not sure. At least when looking at the concept art to model stuff.
---
&gt;So in short the devs don't even know what they're talking about
---
They know, people reading what devs said are the ones that don't know what they are talking about. 
---
&gt;* HITBOXES AND HIT REGISTRATION
---
&gt;When a Killer attacks, the game checks a cone shaped area in front of them to determine if they hit or missed a Survivor. If a Survivor is inside this area while the Killer swings their weapon, the game will register the attack as a hit.
---
&gt;All Killers share the same attack cone in order to maintain consistency; this ensures that your regular attacks feel the same no matter which Killer you play. From the Survivor‚Äôs perspective, this could cause some attacks to appear like they should not have hit even though the conditions were met. A Killer with a smaller weapon (such as the Hag) would have the same reach as a Killer with a large weapon (such as the Trapper). In the 3.0.0 update, we reviewed the attack animations for all Killers and modified them to match the attack cone.
---
&gt;This is our first step towards resolving hit registration issues; basic attacks should now more accurately reflect the size of the cone. Following this change, we will be targeting desynchronization issues. **As mentioned previously, migrating to dedicated servers will give up better tools to handle desynchronization, reducing the edge cases where the Killer and Survivor feel too far apart for the hit to connect.**
---
Completely unrelated but I love your name
---
True. Both need to be looked at heavily
---
Someone name Ted hurt this user very badly I think.
---
If you don‚Äôt already, I would unlock the ‚Äúbest‚Äù teachables... self care, adrenaline, balanced landing, bond, prove thyself, leader, borrowed time, empathy, quick and quiet, and decisive just to name a few of my favorites (in no particular order).
---
I hate DC‚Äôers with a passion but I‚Äôm glad that person DC‚Äôed and denied her that kill
---
I get it you can't fix lag, but this happens even when there's no lagging but I'm sorry am I playing a survival game or a fighting game. Killers shouldn't have whiff damage on survivors already clearing vaults or clearly dodging the hits. Especially killers like Plague, Freddy, Pig, and Legion who doesn't even strike straight but in a circular motion.
---
IT IS BROKEN RIGHT NOW. UP UNTIL A WEEK OR SO AGO, YOU'D GET RANKED WITHIN 3-4 LEVELS OF YOU AT MOST, BARRING A SWF SITUATION. LATELY, IT SEEMS LIKE THE SMALLEST DIFFERENCE IS AT LEAST EIGHT LEVELS EITHER DIRECTION.
---
Borrowed time exists, if you do a rescue within the terror radius and aren't running it or actively blocking hits you are a farming asshole or a newb
---
Don't give claudettes any ideas
---
Maybe the name was too long for the text box ?
---
I swear, the moment I got into a lobby, those things scared the shit out of me
---
Huh? Jeff‚Äôs is more noticeable than this
---
WHY YOU NO YELL? CAPS LOCK BRO.
---
They claim it would cause an issue because then their data would be unreliable, because of flashlights and insta heals being used.
---
I've been playing games since yesterday and haven't gotten the new map once yet. I need to know what it's like but my luck is fuck-all. It's good right?
---
Body blocking the hook when if you dropped the survivor they'd leap off your shoulder (long walks or long blocks). Survivors also then trading body block hits (2 or more survivors blocking) to make sure they all escape. Yeah yeah yeah not toxic. But me stopping one survivor from taking a helmet off while the others are free to do whatever or escape is super duper toxic. Yeah okay. Lmfao nice jokes.
---
I have no clue what the best way is per se but I for one am so gonna get Demagorgon because I'm really excited about how energetic and feral his movement is.
---
I can't even decide if I want to beef him up with physical/defense perks or more magical perks because his lore works both ways. I'm loving the idea of Surge, maybe combining it with Infectious Fright? Unnerving Presence, Overcharge? Bloodhound? I'm mostly just excited to experiment
---
Surveillance seems like it would be useful with traps, but imo I'd rather keep Surveillance on my more human slasher killers. I don't want to play a "smart" Demogorgon; I want to play for chaos
---
No ETA for DBP
---
Dracula with an sarcophagus :')
---
Good write up. Good job.
---
Sort of already happens. Often Baby Dwights get hatch, etc.
---
I'm pretty biased, so I only do this for Nurse players (who I always have fun playing against no matter what, it's such a freaking thrill) and Huntress players (my killer main), and that's only if they didn't get a single kill. It also depends on how generous I'm feeling and how toxic the killer was. 
---
The only time I do it for other killers is if they had a really, *really* bad game. Of course, every once in awhile, I get that one loser who takes advantage of my kindness and strikes me while I'm hooked, even though I'm giving them a free kill (like they've actually accomplished something, lol). Then I usually wait a while before doing it again.
---
Tbh when I play killer if I see people do this I kinda hate it. It‚Äôs almost like ‚Äúsorry you‚Äôre bad, here you go!‚Äù pitty kill. I‚Äôd rather just take my 0 kills and walk away
---
But I do see where you‚Äôre coming from
---
I call bullshit if that's the case so when killers do meet the certain requirement and still miss I'm guessing that's the desync issue? What about dodging the killer hits in a full circle killer swings straight and still gets the hit desync issue? Sounds like a bail out answer to me.
---
Same exact sound?
---
HAG IN ANY BUILD BRINGS OUT THE SALTIEST OF ALL SALTY, TOXIC PEEPS.
---
I PLACED A TRAP SOMEWHERE? CAMPING!
---
I USE RUIN? CHEAP PERKS, CHEATER!
---
GOD FOR BID I PLACE A TRAP ON MY RUIN TOTEM. I THOUGHT MY COMPUTER WAS GONNA EXPLODE FROM THE SALTY TRASH.
---
Yes! I just really want some classic killers I love the new age ones but damn seeing Dracula turn into a swarm of bats or waking up in a sarcophagus would be amazing!
---
the lunge will definitely get nerfed.  
---
No cooldown, Massive range that can go straight across most jungle gyms, no punishment for missing (actually hitting someone has an almost twice as long animation), 45 degree aim assist.  
---
Well, atleast thats the opinion of FunGoose, I'm just a noob but after watching his streams of it I just can't help but agree it's bs.
---
Literally 99% of my games against a Pig are just like this. And they always TBag like their good. Even when I and the other survivors don‚Äôt play toxic.
---
Well there's No one escapes death and we're gonna live forever, so i think that's fine
---
I'll body block the stairs on coldwind farm all I want as long as survivors still body block my hooks.
---
ohhhhhhhh...............  well I just couldn¬¥t  figure out what OP finally did. Maybe OP really is happy about boil over 3.
---
A vampire, a werewolf, a zombie (the flesh-eating variety, not Nurse or Spirit, who are both undead). Frankenstein's monster would be boss.
---
Yeah pretty much
---
IDK man, I kinda like the noise.
---
Hook goes where?!
---
Baby dweet just doin his best
---
Is it me or does #4 look like Tommy Jarvis‚Äôs outfit from F13 VI
---
I know folks shit on F13 but I played that game enough to recognize gnome Tommy Jarvis.
---
Precisely.  I don't have that perk.
---
The throw delay was horrible.
---
I think the real Dwight is behind
---
lol that shit looks like it was made with the mspaint spray can
---
I need the next stranger things season now really
---
How about a dude that can send a falcon out to track a survivor
---
Nicely informative, OP. 
---
I understood this back when they were discussing Ghostface because getting the Likeness of the Mask was miles easier than getting any of the cast members or likenesses and/or rights to use any scenery from the Scream movies. 
---
And this gave BHVR more creative freedom to make their own backstory for GF because the mask isn‚Äôt the killer but we all recognize the mask. Take this well deserved upvote.
---
What's amazing is trying to equate every person playing one character into one group.
---
Its illogical and stupid to top it off.
---
Insert "dirt megan dum" here
---
And you can counter him with garlic and wooden spears :))
---
Do it. You gotta do it, man
---
I can't hear a difference at all
---
I‚Äôm behind all of these 1000%! I‚Äôve always thought it‚Äôd be really cool to see a zombie in this game!
---
How is this an unpopular opinion? Do you really think most dbd redditors support camping?
---
Also how would it make any sense to remove the unhook animation? Physically, it would make no sense. If you were to pull somebody off of a hook it would take immense strength to lift them up and pull them against the friction of the hook. Secondly, it would allow players to farm each other much easier, as it would provide no risk to the unhooking survivor.
---
I'd much rather they come out after the chapter release anyway.
---
YOU KNOW WHAT GRINDS MY GEARS? WHEN SOMEONE FACE CAMPS AND I NICELY TELL THEM ITS NOT A GOOD STRAT AS YOU ONLY GUARANTEE ONE KILL AND THE TEST USUALLY ESCAPE. THEN THIS BOY DECIDES TO SAY FUCK U I DONT CARE EASY GAME.BITCH WHAT YOU CHASED ME FOR 5 MINUTES.
---
I just played a few and I was hit 10 feet away twice. It‚Äôs bad
---
I like it it‚Äôs very interesting and well thought out I think it would really good and still not overpowered to use
---
*FUCK YES*
---
Salt Pouch
---
Eh for me Jeff's isn't
---
No, there are longer perk names like Unnerving Presence and Hex: Thrill of The Hunt. Too bad, the original was better.
---
You can see that op is in purple ranks at the end, so it‚Äôs not that unbelievable
---
yea its mind boggling.  i guess one of the reasons i only play killer is because even if the survivors are being toxic, i'm in charge of the game.   
---
if the killer is being an asshole, you cant do anything.   and that sucks.  hope you guys get matched up with me more often :)
---
STAY FUCKING CALM
---
Just go full Buffy the Vampire slayer stake them and the games over lol also Buffy in this game as a survivor please? Dracula is honestly like my number one I want added or werewolf.
---
I mostly support this, of course the numbers would require testing. It keeps the theme of the piggy up there. 
---
But why would:
---
silent ambush be a common add-on?
---
Rules set no. 2 pretty much make matches be over in 10 mins and completely neglect the dolls?
---
Actually most of the add-ons are op. You probably had too many ideas you wanted to throw in. Pretty much every single add-on is one or two tiers too strong for their rarity.
---
Too bad we cant test killers that can be affected by servers because this community doesn't understand the meaning of test "build".
---
Trying to re-test huntress to see whats changed from Tuesday's servers and people keep DCing while saying "*wHeRe Is DeMoGoRgOn*"
---
The few matches and hits that I managed to land looks like they fixed 1-shots even without iri heads. Don't know about hits going through and injuring multiple survivors lined up.
---
Sound design is great.
---
The lunge can be mindgamed. If survivors are watching for the hand-curl that telegraphs it, you just RMB, let them swerve in circles, then wait. 
---
Trick for portals. Survivors can‚Äôt see them till you activate one. Drop one by a gen, leave it inactive, then late TP back to the gen when sone reason to go is triggered.
---
Myers should also have it.
---
I dislike Demo's chase music, I despise Myers' chase music.
---
Has there been a ban wave?
---
She wouldn't really be The Pig without the mask then, would she? Also I heard that pigs play a pretty important symbol in the Saw franchise. Something to do with Kramer's son being born on the year of the pig. If that's the case then I don't think we should have an unmasked Amanda
---
As I have just yesterday finished watching ST (low key binging), this is ... TOOO SOOOOON
---
But still ridiculously accurate :P
---
And please the map be Bran castle from Romania :))
---
...... more?
---
Not arguing against your points here, I do agree with you, but keep in mind killer can trigger EGC by opening the exit gate
---
The falcon just shits on the survivors and you have to dc in shame. It would be really interesting to see a killer with like a pet that can run around and track survivors or even put them in the mend self state.
---
I happen to be of the opinion that killers can't be toxic, only survivors can.  And I say this as a survivor main (I can't stand playing killer anymore).  
---
Really the only things a killer can do to be "toxic" is: 
---
1) run noed
---
2) camp
---
3) tunnel
---
4) slug everyone and leave them for the end game to kill them instead of hooking and getting the game over.
---
The first 3 are actual game mechanics that can all be easily counted by survivors.  Do bones, gen rush since patrols aren't happening (killer will be punished with a Max 1 kill), body block and flashlight ...  Number 4 is admittedly a dbag move that only a specific perk can counter.  
---
Killers on the other hand have to deal with t-bagging, getting swarmed by swf groups with flashlights that don't worry about gens they just want to blind you, and survivors staying in game after gates are open for the sole purpose of tbaging, DCing as soon as things don't go their way, and more...
---
The wonkiness you are feeling is the 45 degree aim assist on his lunge.
---
Copyright has a gray(grey? where you from?) area. Now I'm not saying this is exactly what happened here, but it's something to keep in mind:
---
When creating the script for the movie, they said 'Quentin looks like this'. They then went and found an actor that fit their vision. But, you can still create the character Quentin based off of what the script says he looks like, without actually having him look like the actor. Make sense?
---
Again, this is where licensing gets complicated - The rights to the character do not mean the rights to the actor, so the person that owns the rights to the character can say 'yeah he looks like that actor'. But if it's TOO close to the actor, then a lawyer can step in like 'surprise bitch, we found out you're using my clients likeness. Pay us.'
---
And THAT is why you'll see characters in a game that look like someone suddenly get changed. My favorite example of this is the Catwoman skin for Bastet in Smite. Here's a link to the reveal video: [CATWOMAN!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D6IbpsJsvY)
---
Now, fans of Michelle Pfeiffer Catwoman will notice that not only is the likeness incredibly similar, but she even does the little flippy-flip-'Meow' move that she did in the movie. Keep in mind, this skin isn't called Catwoman. It's not mentioning anything regarding Catwoman. But we know. We ALL know. And guess what? That skin was pulled in less than a week. The skin was then transformed into a mercenary with guns n shit. Sad times. God I love Smite's skins....
---
I play killer to chill out and get BPs.  A lot of times, I'll even intentionally let everyone live as long as we're all getting points and nobody's toxic.
---
Not gonna lie, though, I've got *lots* of ebony moris saved up, so I frequently bring one.  As soon as I run into a flashlight-clicking t-bagger, they're gonna die.
---
All these legal hurdles are pretty openly known if you care to look into it yourself but the issue is most people *dont* and just *say* what they want in the game and people just echo chamber the meme and then a few people decide to get prissy about it in this meme echo chamber and like to say shit like ‚ÄúJust add this it‚Äôd make you rich idk why you can add this but not this‚Äù and ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just too lazy to make changes‚Äù are usually the same people who take to social media or posts to be vocally negative about the game in general. 
---
While I appreciate the write up and how informative it is I unfortunately don‚Äôt think anything you say on a technical or legal basis will stop or prevent the people who you are describing in your post because those people are just going to say ‚ÄúWell yeah but that‚Äôs stupid‚Äù or deflect any facts to attempt to spin BHVR in a negative light. While the ones who actually want it or are just joining the memes understand these reasons or accept that if it were that simple then they‚Äôd of done it and that BHVR has in the past tried to explain how difficult it is for them to alter anything that‚Äôs a licensed character because almost ALL of the approval stems from the company providing that licensed character and the red tape surrounding it.
---
While there was someone who did that it isn‚Äôt why 173 can‚Äôt be used. It‚Äôs a statue made by a Japanese sculptor who has its design copyrighted. So it can‚Äôt be used for commercial purposes, hence why everything it‚Äôs in is free.
---
&gt;Not arguing against your points here, I do agree with you, but keep in mind killer can trigger EGC by opening the exit gate
---
Only after all gens have been done. If OP and his buddy are hiding with 1 gen remaining, the killer is a hostage.
---
An interesting opinion. I've always wanted a unique chase theme for EVERY killer, but perhaps a better option would be a pool of chase themes to choose from, and you could select your personal "favorite" as your default.
---
You completely missread the unhook animation part.  I meant the killer being able to GRAB you from unhooking. Him hitting you and canceling it is fine.  But the one shot from full hp simply SUPPORTS CAMPING.
---
And yes most reddit users I've ran into say camping is a legit strategy. So.... yeah.  They kinda do.
---
Feels good man
---
Shut up grammar nazi
---
Something that crawls on the ground and has some sort of tracking built into it's power. Give it a sprint ability like billys chainsaw but it doesn't give an insta down, isn't quite as tight for turning, and has a longer stun
---
Any lovecraft inspired tentacle horror that messed with your sanity and could appear in odd places (having it spill out of lockers or hooks for it's traversal power
---
Some kind of beast that has a vision blocking mist ability would be awesome.
---
I laughed way to hard at this
---
This post is just survivors wanting good perks to be even better while chanting in a ritualistic circle and when a killer main tries to comment on that same behalf, everybody just downvotes them like a crowd of champanzees crowding something while picking fleas off each other.
---
We need more of the classic monsters. We have a ghost with Spirit, a Wendigo with Hag, a demon with Freddy, a literal monster with Demogorgon, etc. We need a werewolf, a vampire, a mummy, stuff like that. More classic monsters would be nice for the game.
---
The Survive With Friends host rank exploit already breaks killer match making. And good luck getting killers to intentionally lose.
---
not anymore crushed than Quentin's face rn
---
That's what this whole subreddit is for. Posting Dbd related things and commenting on them.
---
Oh well I assumed gens were all done since OP said 99 the doors. If they‚Äôre 99ing gens then yea, they‚Äôre worse than the camping killer
---
I haven‚Äôt been doing that. I‚Äôm pretty sure literally every argument has had a counter argument laid against it. Not a single post against this was just plain downvoted, but rather discussed with or shown to be wrong
---
The killer made our friend a hostage so expect it buddy.  Get mad.
---
And the Lone survivor perk buff will exacerbate this.
---
The meme is about Quentin being tunneled, the comment I replied to brought up that the player had enough with being tunneled for picking Quentin, I extrapolated on that by saying tunneling based off of survivor is stupid since you can level a survivor enough and use literally any perk on any character so some people think that because someone is Quentin they will be a healer esque character so they'll tunnel them first to make the game "Easier" even though they could technically be anything.  They may not have one Quentin perk equipped. 
---
It's not that hard of a leap I thought but I put out a short comment without tons of context so I can see where you got lost. My main times being tunneled was playing Claudette to unlock Botany Knowledge as I REALLY wanted that on all my survs so I could run Pharmacy, Borrowed Time and that for basically nonstop fast heals. I also had quite a few people dodge those lobbies because my Claud looks nice from random free gear from all the DLCs and that stuff.
---
Nah this is, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the useless garbage that doesn‚Äôt help my team‚Äù build
---
&gt;The killer made our friend a hostage so expect it buddy. Get mad.
---
Being camped isn't a hostage situation.
---
cause they dont know what toxic actually means
---
*gets tunneled and killed* 
---
"omG y R u SO ToXiC!!?"
---
add doge eyes in the demogorgons mouth
---
Yup all gens done 99ing doors.  This guy obviously cant read and posts off pure emotion
---
Can we get this same meme, except Demogorgon is in Steve's place and the Demogorgons are replaced with Nancys and Steves?
---
and then u don't get sh*t after all
---
These commons are modeled after Wraith; moderately powerful unique effects. Silent ambush is pretty good, but doesn't alter your numbers at all, so not exceptional.
---
Rules Set No. 2 is exactly what it says on the tin: a different ruleset. The base power encourages survivors to take their time in the match; find a doll, do a gen, cleanse, repeat. Rule Set No.2 encourages a constant mad dash for the exit gates. A 10 minute timer is short enough that you're definitely in danger, but long enough that it's definitely possible to get out alive.
---
Every add-on is good, which should be the goal. The only one that is definitely too strong in hindsight is Interlocking Razor, and Tampered Timer would probably be more fair as a 45-60 second timer reduction.
---
Hahaha
---
Yes it is.
---
I wish they actually gave you something for levelling your devotion level
---
Yes give us Cthulhu! It has like a dream power similar to Freddy, but actually makes your character hallucinate seeing fake gens/survivors, and can make tentacles pop up out of the ground and be stationary and if I survivor is in close proximity it can see their aura.
---
 I honestly thought that was what Plague was gonna be that she would be hidden in a mist and you knew she was close by how thick it got.
---
The four of us, we did it
---
I'll be honest, I thought it would go to 100, never knew the Devotion thing.
---
alright so how about THIS: a shawnee mask ON TOP of the pig mask???? keeps the pig shape, and we get a horribly distorted/stretched image of her face
---
gotta thing w ur whole big brain here
---
Actually the diversion can be useful, you just need to know when and when not to do it.
---
And I totally agree 100% I‚Äôve actually been known to try to educate people on here about game mechanics or balance or other matters and you‚Äôre right even if the vocal ones who refuse to accept any facts or be reasonable don‚Äôt learn anything from what you‚Äôve said then at least people who either were unsure or maybe just upset but not vocal or stubborn on the matter can at least be educated and maybe they can move forward and try to educate people they see in the future. Good write up I just wish that the stubborn masses weren‚Äôt so stubborn and could just take emotion out of their complaints and accept the hard facts and legal barriers and hoops that are genuinely the reason for making some fan favorite requests just highly unlikely and the examples help paint a realistic picture. Any hints on what game you worked on? ;)
---
I thought he could only see survivors if they‚Äôre sealing the portal, not just near it?
---
I do and this takes the cake.
---
Honestly the new chase music is amazing to hear, i dont really care if its better or worse then the OG, i just think its a breath of fresh air for a killer i have been looking forward 2 :D
---
Only problem is not everyone agrees camping should be looked at. It's their crutch for being bad killers
---
It looks so real I thought it was an action figure at first
---
&gt; he is most watched 
---
wut
---
Get ready to see it downvoted for each pro-killer relpy there are about 4 butthurt survivors, that get click happy!
---
It def does work with HG but it might be a bug since on the release stream they specified the lunge didn't count as an m1?
---
But they already have the rights for the character, they just didn't have the rights to the actor's appearance because he had nothing to do with the deal. If he directly gives him their permission like he has, then there are no legal issues.
---
The only reason there COULD be an issue is if the people that own the rights to the character, for whatever reason, don't want the character to look like the actor. That seems very unlikely and, depending on the contract, might not actually be something they have any legal control over.
---
Congrats on those bandaids OP
---
*Hawkins
---
Makes sense. That‚Äôs the face behind any toxic survivor.
---
EGC refutes any argument. Either it's all allowed, or none of it's allowed. I'll be happy if they remove all body blocking, or keep it the same. It's not my choice, I just play the game how I want. And I won't get banned because I don't cheat, add people and talk shit, or exploit bugs. The day I get banned for playing how I choose, is the day I move to another game, plain and simple.
---
Alien is always #1. i've been saying they should do Alien forever. they can have facehugger eggs around the map that pop if you're 1m away at 5gens, 5m away at 4gens, 10m, etc., and only another survivor could pull it off, and if a chestburster results, that survivor is dead, and the killer instead takes control of the resulting alien, that grows very fast, and is permanently a faster deadlier version of the alien, with lower POV, acid spit, farther reaching tail strike, walk on and over walls, etc. alternatively the eggs can simply be an option that you can bring bodies to instead of hooks--which no killer has ever had before--so that if you put them to an egg instead, they get the facehugger. then u can also hook them if u have enuff wiggle meter left.
---
This was just tweeted this morning.
---
he should be easier to spot. GF was nerfed the same reason why legion was. He doesn't work.
---
No, it wasnt a lie...The dbp was never officialy posted, just a guy editing the wiki and people thinking it was real
---
No problem.
---
They did yes, but they might have changed it to.
---
Well nah, he‚Äôs fine where he is. If anything was to even change I‚Äôd say he gets a longer cooldown for missing his Shred attack
---
Mark Zucc as The Reptilian. 
---
Not the killer we deserve, but the killer we need.
---
He tweeted about it a while ago as well.  That‚Äôs why I said yet here we are months later and at the time BH did not contact him yet.  Quite happy to see that will change now
---
I can at least understand why you'd face camp with the gates open, but golly bob howdy this lad doesn't even know how to *that.*
---
Yup.  Especially true if you have a stealth guy like ghostface, or pig.  Sometime the hurt survivor literally runs right to you.  But if you down them expect a DC and a whole lot of messages about you being a toxic/trash killer.
---
litterally the opposite in my experience, over 15 is sweat city.
---
I don't think the demogorgon's mouth can open up that wide tbh
---
So taking hits to protect a Survivor is toxic? Are we not allowed to protect others?
---
I think her terror radius and stain should disappear immediately after crouching and traps should activate as soon as they‚Äôre unhooked.
---
Haha well unfortunately, I can't say. But i've worked on a few. The only one I'll give a hint about that may or may not be completely obvious is a music game. And that's the first time I encountered 'cert'. And cert is awful. And considering the amount of 'WHY ISN'T THE PTB ON N64 AND GAMEGEAR' posts i've been seeing, that may be my next rant lol.
---
The nea dcing is the cherry on the cake
---
I am so glad I am not the only one that thought that!
---
With Vaults and Lockers? sure.
---
With the finite amount of objects that help you not die within 20 seconds of a chase? no.
---
Enjoy getting banned for that, if you hate hook blockers so much I recommend you run the perk Mad Grit
---
badass laurie would be PERFECT!!
---
Thanks mate! This is only my second time posting. I‚Äôm glad to see that I made a few people laugh.
---
I'm old, Haha what do you mean?
---
i mean securing a kill by facecamping, if you cant facecamp well as leatherface you suck, thats what i meant
---
I had this thought about trapper today:  why is it that trappers always wait until the last second to set traps at the exit gates?
---
I don't ever play as him, but it's something you could do even at the beginning of the game, and it always gives him a huge benefit during end game.
---
As a survivor, I'd never expect it.
---

What platform are you getting it on?

Fuck me i've being playing too much Bully
---
Me at 3am going to tell my mum I threw up
---
I didnt say anything about taking hits. Body blocking a hook is different.
---
It should be between 1- 3k shards
---
Maybe I'm missing a reference. What games are you referencing in the OP? I figure this is probably a can't rather than won't situation, but I'm still curious.

Lol great game

Yeah if they think steam red tapes bad wait until they see the weeks long cert process for Sony and Microsoft. From what I‚Äôve heard though Nintendo is far more lenient with what content is ‚Äúallowed‚Äù and the PTB would need to be created as a temp time gated update that locks it afterwards but then they couldn‚Äôt even do that because the PTB changes and updates as its ongoing and shortly before release which means that 2 week time window comes back into play for touching shit again.
---
We don't know if the character's facial appearance is part of their contract with the copyright holders.
---
Seriously! I remember thinking 'If I ever develop my own game I'm not putting it on consoles' and then was immediately like 'holy shit...it all makes sense. Everything makes sense now oh my god'. 
---
It also answers the question as to why games barely do demos anymore!
---
Rip
---
I'M HONESTLY GOING TO OCCASIONALLY RUN IT WITH A FUCKING KEY FOR THIS VERY REASON.
---
It only looks like there's a few halls he can actually use his saw in poor billy
---
Am I the only one who wants more survivors around the campfire ?
---
It‚Äôs not that big of a waste. It only takes 15 seconds for me
---
It's still bannable my dude. You can also hold the game hostage outside of the EGC.
---
I use Make Your Choice, Haunted Ground, Thrilling Tremors, Pop Goes The Weasel with double windstorm add ons.
---
She didn't deny her kill lol, the Pig in that clip is being a dick but if you DC the killer will be even happier. Not only does the killer get points, the survivor gets -2 pips and 0 bloodpoints for everything they have done.
---
The best thing to do is just die, you will get bloodpoints and maybe +1 pip or 0 pips.
---
But in their contract I doubt they said that BHVR could change the in-game character to the actors face as long as he agrees. It will still be a change in the character inside the game with the copyrights of Quentin.
---
*cries in English formatting*
---
1k each time for a max of 3k sounds good. Motivation to get it
---
And here we got salty survivor number one, welcome sir... are you a random or do you travel in group of 4?
---
Edit\*: It's not even posted as a bait post and it's attracting salt like cow dung attracts flies!
---
You clearly don't know. So try again.
---
This one just looks like a SWF group. The leader is Rank 16 so the matchmaking counts them all as Rank 16. They are going to fix this and it will take the group average instead... one day..
---
I'd love to see the 1 key overlay an opaque green circle on your "hooked" icon in the bottom left, and 2 overlay a red one. Maybe give it a few second cooldown, and you've got an interesting game mechanic there.
---
That would make sense
---
it came from the upside down so it‚Äôs physical, and they turned the sauna wayyyyy up
---
Nice slipers
---
We really need to stop using the nurse to gauge balance. No killer needs to be as good as her
---
Imagine making fun of a Test Build.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre pretty spot on. Every single one of Jigsaw‚Äôs (Kramer, Hoffman, Young) disciples wear Pig heads as masks
---
She's thicc u uncultured swine
---
Oh, only a year late is all
---
I WONDER HOW USEFUL NOED WILL BE WITH NANCY AROUND.
---
Only if you're being chased
---
How do you get tunneled to 5 tokens when devour only gets a maximum of 2 from each survivor?
---
"Shouldn't need crutch perks as a killer." So you want Rank 20s with zero perks rolling Rank 5 survivors? Where's the balance in that? You're complaining about balance while simultaneously complaining that killers need perks? Maybe you should go play F13 then.
---
They uploaded today so yeah it should be them
---
My favorite part is the sound design, but also its so weird how similiar it feels to the show. Going against the Demagorgon is exactly how it seems to be in the show.
---
It‚Äôs not about the points, it‚Äôs about the message.
---
Coming from someone who tries to never dc but that 1 out of 100 games that just reallllllly rubbed salt the wrong way, I just let loose lol
---
Actually, ruin either stood all game or all survivors disconnected after doing one gen that was around the bubble. I'm not sure tho because my hud never changed and I couldn't move entire match
---
First of all that is not a perk but an offering. 
---
And back in the day Bloody Party Streamers were common (Brown) instead of green (like it is now)
---
But they are both equally ridiculous. A team of 4 no mithers will be crushed by a halfway competent killer. Just as a team who doesn't do gens has no chance. 
---
My point was, something doesn't counter something else if the strategy to "counter" it is completely unviable. For example, running no mither on 4 players or not doing gens. While they technically counter that one thing, they are also counterintuitive to the actual goal of the game. Surviving. And thus they simply cannot be considered a true counter to anything.
---
But hey I also thought we were all just joking. Becuase surely no one actually believes no mither is a counter to anything? HA I countered your one hit kill! Now you... one hit kill me! But becuase of my perk not yours! Somehow that means I'm countering you even though you are getting the exact effect you sought after!! Haha! I win!..... I mean come on lol
---
From rabies or from adorbies?
---
Non-licensed? A werewolf
---
Licensed? That bear from annihilation
---
What about Nancy moaning when down lol
---
Lmao exactly why I haven‚Äôt bought him yet, just a fugly character model
---
I'm pretty sure he meant **literally** tunneling, as in through the ground.
---
May as well.  Survivors are all running instaheals.
---
He 100% should not be easier to spot, its already tough enough to win staring contests as him, he doesnt need to be hobbled further.

OH MY GOD.  SERIOUSLY, FUCK TEAMMATES THAT OPEN YOUR LOCKER WHEN THE KILLER IS COMING.  
---
I'VE HAD PEOPLE LITERALLY STOP TRYING TO RUN OR HIDE FROM THE KILLER JUST SO THEY CAN SHOW THE KILLER I'M THERE MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT.  FUCK THOSE PEOPLE.
---
The message you are giving is "I am so mad that I DC and don't get any reward for the things I did this game" and I think killers like that like it when you get mad.
---
i.. this hurts my pride as a survivor main. 
---
i still love playing against trapper though.
---
It's not even that hard to grind 1 million BP... Why not put in some effort?
---
Good
---
Oh thanks daddy-o
---
It only stops when the survivor is hooked, downed, or in a chase, the Pig is crouched, so a chase can't activate.
---
But you should recall her making traps impossible to escape on purpose. That's why jigsaw tested her which she failed.
---
If the contract doesn't specify a specific face or appearance for the character then it doesn't matter. Contracts to use a character under someone else's copyright usually have specific clauses for certain things but given that they didn't have a specific face to use, BHVR was probably given a lot of creative license in that regard.
---
To be honest, this Pig is pretty good for being able to find out where they both had to go to disarm their traps, then capitalizing on it for the double kill.
---
Without a medkit that is a straight up lie

Wow you truly are an idiot, I give you a chance to elaborate on your idiotic stance, you instead call me ‚Äúsalty‚Äù for no reason. üòÇ 
---
10/10
---
Do you think the copyright holders told them to make the face look like it does or do you think they were given creative freedom over that aspect?
---
I was just thinking that too... Doesn't seem to have any orifices either.
---
If I dc it‚Äôs cause I‚Äôm already getting 2k points bc my game was going THAT badly. Everyone gets salty on this game.  I feel bad afterwards but in that moment, that killer is gonna take all my salt from the past 100 games. 
---
Killers can like it idgaf im just saying I‚Äôm done with that game, onto the next. I also only dc when I‚Äôm on death hook. I‚Äôm not a monster to deny bbq stacks. 
---
Also lol pips

Edit: grammar
---
I got to play the new map in PTB once and is there a downstairs? I found some stairs that lead up to a hall of small cubicle offices but I just know I missed another chunk of the map because I kept seeing the same geenrators over and over and could not find a single totem when I was trying to use new Nancy's perk that heals you after cleansing a totem and going into a locker.
---
Pc
---
This is part of the point that I'm making. The copyright holders don't care what the character looks like beyond his clothing.
---
We don't know what the contract looks like but even if they have complete creative control over every aspect of the in-game character, they'd probably be on board with the character looking like he does in the film. It makes the character more accurate and it doesn't cost them a dime on their end.
---
I don't act toxic, I just play casually. During the entire PTB I only had maybe 5 killers that didn't just camp the hooks.
---
Although I want new cosmetics for Lauri, this post was pretty informative and provided a lot of insight. It definitely isn't as easy as it is to demand it.
---
You‚Äôre not listening. I said the guy with BT takes the hit, that gives him a 3 second boost to escape. The guy without BT would have enough time to vault the window on the left safely, get Lithe and then escape during the chainsaw cooldown.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a regular 3 man high rank SwF and you want to play with your friend who just got the game because of Stranger Things? No, you suck. My entitlement to the 4K says so. You don‚Äôt choose what killer you get or the shitty matchmaking chooses but you are clearly abusing the system‚Äù
---
Lmao, yeah I just realized that
---
I don‚Äôt like insulting someone‚Äôs intelligence without good reason, it‚Äôd be intellectually dishonest. 
---
You obviously hold a stupid opinion.
---
 &gt; Just look at all the toxic perks you have gotten each DLC, where Killers get maybe 1 decent Perks per killer if they are lucky!
---
If you cared about being intellectually honest, you‚Äôd know that each ‚ÄúDLC‚Äù and update are filled with survivor nerfs and killer buffs, aside from Legion re-work and making moris require one hook as opposed to at first down. 
---
I asked you to explain what are these amazing perks you are referring to for survivors and garbage perks for killers. But you can‚Äôt. Instead, you felt ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù enough to call me salty for no reason.
---
‚úåüèø
---
Anyone who claims they already have the most effecient method is lying to you
---
Well they're not always the same and you're right that the ball is almost always in the court of whoever owns the copyright as far as what happens with the character. It just seems odd to me that they'd write a specific facial appearance into a contract unless they had the rights to the actor's actual appearance, in which case they'd want the character to look exactly like they do in the movies.
---
I think it's likely that BHVR would have to obtain approval to make ANY change to the character but I don't know that for a fact. I also think it's just as likely that they'd give permission for this over just a short phone call.
---

Most people will think your browser is on pornhub permanently but saving your eyesight is more important than what people think.
---
Killers are literally as bad as survivors, the only difference is generally there‚Äôs more survivors due to there being 4 for everyone killer. Doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre worse than killers since there‚Äôs many toxic killers out there. Killers can turn new survivors off of this game just as much as toxic survivors can do to new killers.
---
As a pig main I 100 percent hate when people accuse you of tunneling or being an ass for predicting their box paths and catching them in rotation. Don't be predictable and you wont get found, mix up which boxes you go to. Any good pig knows how long it will take you to search each box and they WILL use that to their advantage. It's like telling someone they cant react to a red stain mid chase. If you have the information, use it.
---
That's because he has nothing of substance.  Just another babykiller whining instead of learning the game.

How can i Unsee it now?

How the fuck do people pull this shit on console

That's entirely dependent on the killer. I'd much rather have dropped pallets against Nightmare or Spirit.

SWF host rank exploit is the most commonly abused bug that has been ignored by devs.

"I'm just playing with my smurf friend and we prefer to bully rather than play killers our own level."  is what you are really saying.

I love this so much, the perks are just good enough while not being too extremely op and the power sounds perfect.
---
You can never fix lag, but you can fix how you deal with latency. Rollback netcode works fine.
---
And? I don't play Quentin for his perks. Just like I don't play Jake for his perks etc.

The perks i run, i can run on any character. So the character is just my preferred aethetic for how i want to run around in the game.
---
All the people saying that his Lunge is OP really does annoy me

Unless all the totems are broken then nah not really

They sort of do. BPS mean instead of everyone getting 200% BP during the event, they get 300%.
---
Exactly
---
I'm his girlfriend and I disapprove
---
&gt; It would be dumb to remove the grabbing animation. The point of grabbing is that you left yourself wide open, so the killer should be able to benefit off of that.
---
That‚Äôs not a fair argument; unhooking is not the same as passively doing gens/slow vaulting/hiding in lockers, where killers are rewarded a grab. Even though OP is a crybaby, he‚Äôs right, grabbing of hook saves just promotes camping. And if a survivor is committed to saving, it turns into a hatch standoff situation where both sides play around the grab mechanic. Survivor baits killer into missing the grab and killer baits survivor into starting the grab animation. This has nothing to do with survivor unawareness, as you base your argument on. They reworked that for the hatch but not unhooking for no apparent reason.
---
Thanks! I put alot of tought into everything,while also trying to keep it in-character for the Witch. Pretty amazing i was able to just come up with this today,to be honest. Guess i'm pretty creative :p

Dont think its their primary goal. Still need to figure out dedicated servers
---
It's worse on PTB then it is on live though. On PTB  I was consistently getting hit through windows when I already had control of my character again and continued running away/ completely done with the vault and not near the window anymore. That rarely happens on live.

---
Except for T-bags, none of those are toxic.
---
I only hate keys for those few occasions when survivors 3 gen themselves, there's only 3 survivors left in the game, and one of them happened to find a key to escape through the hatch. Two of them escape and leave the third to die. I hate that so much more than if all four survivors escaped by hatch. So, I'd either be fine if keys were removed or only allowed one survivor to escape through.
---
Still a dick move by that survivor? Sure. But at least two survivors have a better chance at getting out than 1.
---
And before anyone goes "BUT WHAT ABOUT-" I hate Ebony Moris, Iridescent Heads, and NOED as well. When I've played survivor I've only felt good about using a key once and that was once we had both exits open, I saved someone from hook from a clown with NOED who was standing right on hatch, and opened the hatch and jumped through to survive in the time it took clown to swing and down me - and the rest of my team got out safe.
---
12 IS NOT A HIGH LEVEL. THAT IS WHY I LAUGHED. I'M 7 ON PC AND 3 ON XBOX, BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT IT UP. REGARDLESS, YOU'RE EITHER A HOOK FARMER, OR YOU RUN AWAY WHEN IT HAPPENS TO EVEN NOTICE. FOR THOSE OF US THAT KNOW HOW TO GET A SURVIVOR OFF THE HOOK WITHOUT THEM GETTING TUNNLED IT'S A PROBLEM. 
---
YOU COULD HAVE CHOSEN A LOWER LEVEL SINCE YOU WERE MAKING IT UP TO BEGIN WITH.
---
WHY OF COURSE!!
---
Do survivors really need this? I feel like the sound was more than enough. 
---
And Tbh It kinda reminds me of how people always complain that NOED is unearned. Literally incentivize letting your teammates die.
---
This isn‚Äôt confirmation of anything. Please stop spreading misinformation. He‚Äôs saying that he and Gallner are going to talk about it (meaning they‚Äôre going to attempt to discuss it with the license holders). That absolutely does NOT mean the license holders are going to agree.
---
SERIOUSLY, I PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO WHERE THE KILLER IS WHEN I'M ON THE HOOK, AND IF THEY ARENT IN A CHASE ACROSS THE MAP, I'M GETTING THE FUCK OUT OF THERE.
---
THEN I TRY TO WALK AWAY TO NOT LEAVE SCRATCH MARKS AND THE UNHOOKER FOLLOWS AND HEALS CONSTANTLY.
---
that's more like... flabby
---
honestly i feel like placing them right on top of hooks and gens is just the fastest way to destroy them and just waste time. if you actually want to teleport the survivors should have to make a sacrifice- should i find and remove this portal before unhooking, or should we make the risky play and try to get out as soon as possible? Instead it's usually just like let's unhook and then destroy it before demo has a chance to even get to a portal to TP to us.
---
at least, most demos i've played against do that and fail to capitalize on portals except to leave hooks by.
---
Thankfuly its short so cropping it out doesnt make all that much difference
---
My first time against a tombstone myers I thought the same at first but instead of whining and accusing I waited till the match was over and checked the add ons
---
Well if we go in detail, the main menu doesn't have a theme i believe, the killer and survivor menu do instead. They are much different from one another, the sruvivor one having a classic guitar whilst the killer one Being a heavy metal kind of tune. The Sony changes for some killers like spirit or clown. I havent played DbD in a while. But if u search DbD theme on YouTube u will prettt much fine everthing i guess.
---
I haven't stopped laughing at this! I can't! 
---
Demogorgon is the best thing that happened!
---
Downside is because of the fact it would get banned in some regions it doesn‚Äôt properly decapitate the survivor
---
As someone who regularly plays both, they‚Äôre both shit. The reason you run into more toxic survivors is because survivors outnumber killers 4:1 so the chances of getting a toxic survivor in a game is significantly higher. It‚Äôs really not that complex, the gaming community is just full of shitheads.
---
I didn't say every survivor is a toxic little shit, truth is most of the survivors I've met are this way, they stun and then teabag, they opened the gates they teabag, they are literally in front of a pallet teabagging and guess what I did, nothing, I didn't camp, I didn't tunnel, I'm literally playing normally and they still act toxic, hell I've lost a match and had survivors come at me being toxic for no reason
---
Honestly I think she was beautiful when she wasn't sick, her more healthy side of her face looks good.

`say it back`

Great play! I always unexpectedly Kobe when the killer is standing right in front of me.

I'd do that too, but it's already a proper resolution. shame
---
Does sbfl affect his lunge attack?
---
The new lobby system is still in place even though the dedicated servers themselves aren't.
---
On a side note, this causes really weird issues with Kill Your Friends games where you go from the lobby to the "Connecting to players" screen then back to the lobby and then to the offering / map loading screen.  In KYF you're already connected to all the other players in the match because it's a different lobby type.

r/DBDGoneGay has been a thing for a while

That must've been funny.
---
Regarding PTB, I've been playing nothing but Huntress (to see how servers are affecting her and how she is on the new map) or my main survivor (Feng) with Nancy's perk. I have no real interest in the new characters so playing as them doesn't make any sense.
---
U already know he was trying to pull some bullshit lol
---
No but I like combo of a normal attack followed by his lunge
---
It blows me away that you literally just said
---
&gt; I happen to be of the opinion that killers can't be toxic, only survivors can. 
---
And then immediately after made a list of ways killers can be toxic
---
Of course, Jesus is always happy
---
Theres no servers in live game
---
I considered Charger,but i feel like his power would be tricky to come up with,since charging is already a thing Billy does.

I did come up with an idea for a Smoker killer tho,i'd call him the Strangler and have his power be obviously,his tongue pull. Maybe i'l make yet another post sometime.

The Original Killers and survivors are obtainable by either buying them from the Steam/Xbox/Playstation/Nintendo/Googleplay/Apple store or by buying them with *Auric Cells* which are the premium currency for dbd (think Vbucks or whatever other game you play) OR you can buy them with *Iridescent Shards* a currency obtained from leveling up and playtime.
---
The Licensed Killers/Survivors can only be obtained via the steam store or with Auric Cells
---
However there is a feature known as the **Shrine of Secrets** that resets weekly on tuesday that contains 2 survivor and 2 killer perks from various killers/survivors (it could be a free, original, or licensed killer/survivor no guarantee). You can buy the perks from there for 2000 iridescent shards (or 2700 if its the first appearance of the perk) so if a licensed killer or survivor has a perk you want but you dont want to/cant spend real money on them you could wait and buy their perks from the shrine.
---
In general Surviors are almost entirely cosmetic, they dont have any unique powers to them like killers so the only difference is body size and the amount of noise they make but like I said it doesn't really matter at the end of the day.
---
Killers on the other hand have unique powers to them that cannot be used on other killers.
---
In my head the demogorgon is just giving the survivors a big whopping kiss!
---
Who would win: The mindflayer or a pair of thick wool socks
---
I try to give someone hatch everygame if it was a good game. No one was toxic all match. I dont understaaaand.
---
You guys have lit hexes?
---
So satisfying, for real
---
Ah, ok. Is it strange when he screams? Does his scream play as normal or is it still in sync with his animation?
---
Freddy is pretty annoying because his lunge seems like its double the length
---
Why not get a fast kill with three gens remaining? It's not like the pig was taking the game hostage, it's pretty obvious by beeps that those survivors had just a few seconds left.
---
A toxic survivor will PM you almost every game. Just block them and move on, and be sure to report them if they're mean! Nothing you do matters. Survivors are just toxic.
---
You can also turn off the option for non-friends to message you and it's a lifesaver!
---
Thankyou.gif
---
Finally someone else that understands.
---
Yeah you got a point there with the Charging, and also another name for the Smoker would be the ‚ÄúThe Constrictor‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Snarer‚Äù
---
Should have just left since meg is not a man
---
As trapper you have very little extra time to place traps that aren't going to give you an advantage until the end of the game.  Plus, you often will know when the last gen is going to pop and can go trap one exit then - if you trap one exit and then find survivors at the other that is still a win.
---
No one said there won't be a bloodhunt any time soon..
---
Tru
---
Ooh I really wanna use these, but will I be banned? That‚Äôs my biggest concern tbh
---
Let's be honest, they more than likely will.
---
Well it clearly would make enough people uncomfortable that either BHVR or Netflix decided they didn‚Äôt want it to be associated with the Stranger Things DLC. 
---
Also, no one is saying that they don‚Äôt have the right to call it cruel confinement. It was clearly an internal business decision so that dead by daylight or stranger things wouldn‚Äôt be one of the first google results when you look up ‚Äúcruel confinement‚Äù. This was never an argument of if they can, but rather an argument of if they should.
---
Yes, it fits the game and what the perk does, but it‚Äôs a matter of handling someone else‚Äôs property in a way that doesn‚Äôt put it into any kind of negative spotlight.
---
You obviously don‚Äôt know about the immense legal complications involving the licensing of anything Nightmare On Elm Street related. It‚Äôs simply not that easy.
---
As I trapper main I disagree, I‚Äôve never had a problem playing lery‚Äôs and the game is actually my favourite trapper map, (for reasons I‚Äôll never tell anyone).
---
There are maps some killers can apply more pressure and some where they have little. Same goes for survivors applying gen pressure.
---
Your opinion is generated from High lack of killer experience.

YOUR STUPIT

The add-on is extremely strong on him, this has been proven already. If it was base kit, making room for another add-on? No

---
I'm pretty sure body blocking a jigsaw box isnt an intended mechanic.   But hey if you wanna secure the kill then go for it.  
---
I play this game to enjoy myself.  I dont enjoy doing shit like this.  If others do, cool.  I dont play as survivor specifically to avoid douchebags like this.
---
this would make the pig insanely op at low ranks and awful at red ranks.
---
Yeah, dude had the luck to find two Survivors about to get SNAPPED, AND the Jigsaw box they were going for. It is only logical that they take the opportunity to have a double kill.
---
Where can i see this render?
---
Bottom lines is they are just increasing the amount of perks that show up in a higher level bloodweb and how many you can get per level before the others get locked out. It's not as major as people were hoping for but it is something.

---
TAKE YOUR SHITTY OPINIONS AND PERSONALITY AND FUCK OFF.
---
But survivors have some stereotypes. I never saw a selfish Jake for example or a urban evading David. Some things are very rare like a tbagging Meg for example. It's just my opinion tho
---
Why is he on Pornhub?
---
That was just my title haha, the tuber just says efficiently. I think it's really nice, helped me out. But hey, whatever you wanna do
---
Everybody's OP at low ranks, and she's already awful at red ranks.
---
It's stronger than live Pig, which is all it needs to be.
---
The devs are wrong.
---
It's resource pack now, get with the times
---
YOU CAN DO IT. I BELIEVE IN YOU.
---
YOU FIRST SWEETIE! LOL
---
Domt u dare to say things like that to my Peppa-Chan
---
Yeah Bills are a lil bit weak too. I face some good Dwights which counters that meme of Baby Dweet XD
---
About what?
---
I dared, you CANNOT STOP ME!
---
what rank are you? these suggestions make her way too lethal. playing the pig would make you depip every game when everyone just dies instantly.
---
For the demogorgon the lunge makes me feel iffy because you can't control it however it has low cooldown if you miss and if you cancel it you can just instantly hit someone and the distance it gives is alot I feel it deserves atleast a bit more cooldown then it's perfect, for portals I feel they're alright they give distance but you need to be smart when placing them as you can't pick them up. For the survivors perks they're good nothing more to say. Hawkins is really glitchy between missing textures, unusable hatch spawns and unreachable totems, it looks great though
---
Yes but you cant tell which direction shes dashing to, and making them give up a loop means they aren't looping you
---
Thanks for the help, that clears it all up!

I MEAN, IF THE KILLER IS OBVIOUSLY FAR AWAY AND I UNHOOK YOU WITH WE'LL MAKE IT, I'M GONNA TRY TO CAPITALIZE ON THOSE TWO THINGS. IF IT'S A HUNTRESS OR WE'RE STILL IN TERROR RADIUS, I'M BOOKING IT WITH YOU
---
I love the idea of a decoy gen which vanishes after have 20% progress
---
Calm down there buddy. Just saying that they are more than likely to agree due to their history and past negotiations with BHVR. On top of one of the actors giving personal permission. It will just take time. I bet you.
---
Who‚Äôs to say they did nothing all game? I understand getting mad about them hatch camping instead of saving but still why just assume they did nothing? Maybe they were chased and worked in gens? I bet a majority of the time your teammates do shit you didn‚Äôt see and you just assume out of frustration they did nothing. Downvote me if you want but ‚Äúrandoms do nothing all game‚Äù is said too often.
---
Green Medkits are better than purple medkits
---
Those bitches had it coming, cleansing both ruin and TOTH against a Spirit. Good on'ya, OP.
---
OMG THIS IS AMAZING!
---
Bills seemsl the easiest and Lauries the hardest
---
So in that case, there should never be a double BP event? They made the ‚Äúgame health‚Äù excuse when they called off a summer event. Tf were they doing?
---
OOF THIS SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA AND I WILL BE TRYING TO DO THIS NOW. IM LOWKEY WORRIED THAT BC IM A GIRL (MY USERNAME HAS MY NAME) THAT IM STILL GOING TO GET HATE BUT THAT JUST MEANS IM A BETTER PLAYER
---
Incorrect. If you've dealt with a certain company before, then your chances of them accepting your future negotiations are more likely. Same with BHVR and their history with the licensors of NOES. Back when they first introduced the DLC, Kyle was not even contacted, so how can you guarantee it was because of the licensing company? Maybe BHVR just thought it's not worth paying Kyle. I don't know why you're so upset by this, but how bout this. When this happens, I'll be back to brag. Fair deal? ;)
---
I get that, but when playing swf with randoms and having them leave puts you at a huge disadvantage, and when using good items/add ons/offerings it can be a serious pain
---
[New bloodweb at level 50+](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cz6oug/new_bloodweb_at_level_50/)
---
In terms of dbd gameplay, what a douchebag. In terms of accurate portrayal, it's spot on. Amanda wasn't interested in the games being fair, bitch just wanted to *kill*
---
Old Quentin, new killer DLC confirmed.
---
I honestly wasn't going to respond to this but jesus christ. You're the person we talked about in a comment a little above this one.
---
And guess what? When showing license holders the game, they show what goes on in the game, like 'here this is what's going to be done to your character'. Still has to be approved.
---
Also, killers and survivors come out with new perks. Which, surprise, come with new animations.
---
And...
---
Have to be approved. Don't try to trivialize an entire topic by saying 'lol but that's already in the game tho', my man.
---
I have a suspicion that you can only see scratch marks that the killer can see. Meaning yes I think you would be able to see your diversion scratches. But if you are up against a legion or spirit with mother-daughter ring you won't, because the killer can't see scratch marks.
---
But that's just a theory.... A GAME THEORY (sorry had to)
---
A fan site mocked up a Double Bloodpoint Weekend post for September 5th to the 9th.
---
None of the official Behaviour account‚Äôs posted it, I should‚Äôve known better lol.
---
I feel like you missed the intent of the post...  I made a list of ways they are "toxic", as in thing people call toxic bit are actually legitimate and easily countered parts of the game.  
---
So let me rephrase.  I would define toxic behavior as act done for the primary purpose of pissing off a player, not acts done in an intent to win the game.  
---
That said.  If you are  genuinely outclassed as a survivor, the killer won't go out of their way to piss you off, taunt you, and prolong the game just to make your life hell.  99% of the time he will down you, hook you, and move on.  The only exception being at the slugging that I described earlier but that is rare and often more new players wanting to see the animation rather then toxicity.  
---
If however, you are a killer and genuinely outclassed by a survivor, or worse still a swf group...  Expect that game to be be deliberately extended.  Expect gens to not be done so the can seek you out and loop you for days. Expect farming.  Expect t-bagging... Lots and lots of it...  And expect everyone to sit by the exit untill you come by just so they can tbag one last time before they exit.  Why?  Cuz toxic and no other reason.
---
Lucky I guess? Somebody burned a salt pouch before the match. Maybe that‚Äôs why? I don‚Äôt know the odds
---
The mindflayer would just make him take off the socks though
---
something ain't right here chief
---
To get add ons someone must have ace in the whole, so maybe they traded the flashlight for another item?
---
That's good to know, but still confusing!
---
Because you clearly don‚Äôt understand what is going on with the Nightmare franchise specifically. New Line and Warner Bros have been in legal battles for years, and New Line has been pulling/not renewing licenses for a while. It‚Äôs more complex than just ‚Äúwell they‚Äôve worked together before!‚Äù Also, there‚Äôs nothing to brag about if anything happens? I‚Äôm simply stating the facts of the situation involving the licenses. Gallner only owns the rights to his likeness; BHVR bought the licenses for the character, and going back and changing that is incredibly complex, especially in the situation of a Nightmare on Elm Street property.
---
There are times when you can see survivors auras and even see them in person, you know
---
I somehow managed adept David vs. a Clown with exhaustion bottles, I've never been so proud of an escape. No other escape I've had can compare
---
Ghostface could have stalked him
---
If I see someone camping the hatch all the 60 seconds it takes me to enter into stage 2 while other survivor is getting chased/trying to do a gen/getting killed, I'm gonna take a wild guess and assume that survivor was useless. In that case, if we end up being being the last two survivors, I'm gonna punish that struggle button the whole damn minute just the give the killer a chance to get that survivor.
---
Okay? And if he ran at him he would just leave ?
---
Such a bean-less existence is destined to be fraught with peril, and stricken with strife.
---
Godspeed, poor soul.
---
I was about to put that too lol.
---
I mean the people that are asking for a nerf are really only asking for slight changes to the lunge like a little bit more cooldown for a missed attack or when canceling shred you get a slight cooldown. But yea please don't nerf the demogorgon too much please god
---
Yeah yeah sometimes I experience it too. Though sometimes I have to admit I am that guy cuz I just get distracted or am playing too conservatively but not too often. But you also have to admit you probably assume they‚Äôre doing nothing when you don‚Äôt really know sometimes too.
---
I hope Laurie gets fixed too
---
But that is what ghostface was trying to do. Stalk him
---
YES
---
A rare occurrence in Florida.
---
Was the chest alredy opened, if so someone traded it in or had ace in the hole if not then the chances of getting that is none, i think you NEED ace in the hole to get even a single add-on
---
Stop i miss brown streamers so much
---
Yeah that seems like an extreme case though tbh. I don‚Äôt see stuff like that often at all.
---
WHY IS EVERYONE SO FUCKING TOXIC IN THE PTB IT'S A TIME FOR PEOPLE TO TEST NEW STUFF AND NEW BUILDS, ALSO IT'S A PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO TEY NEW PLAY STYLES. STOP FUCKING ATTACKING PEOPLE FOR BEING BAD WITH A BRAND NEW FUXKING KILLER OR PLAY STYLE. ALSO JUST FUCKING LEAVE WHEN THERE IS SOMEONE ON THE HOOK AND THE END GAME HAS STARTED, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO FARM FOR ALL OF ENDGAME BECAUSE SOMEONE WANTS TO FUCKING SAVE, I WANT THE GAME TO END GO AWAY
---
True but technically speaking nurse is the best . Lol it‚Äôs just people don‚Äôt want to try to master which is what I‚Äôm doing , LEMME TELL YOU , I am f.ing people up with her after a week straight 24/7 ( bc I‚Äôm currently an not working and haven‚Äôt stared college yet ) you can be a nightmare as her
---
THANK YOU
---
On console
---
Use Play with your Food to increase the lunge speed. It's fucking horrifying to play against
---
Gives off the Stranger Things feeling really well
---
This is legit live build Quentin if he was 40 years older
---
As a Doctor main i can confirm i don't sleep,laugh to myself and hate doing things.
---
It was the ptb that just came out. The chapter usually goes live around two(2) weeks after the chapter has been released on the ptb.
---
Another ghost face situation. Fun and good killer that isnt op asf but survivors dont get to have a good time. 
---
Idk if they know this or not but its a lot more stressful to play killer, so having something fun to play with is worth so much more than some survivors feelings.
---
I mean nurse can literally just (basically) noclip through pallets, windows **and** walls.
---
If he was then hed go 40m away
---
People need to learn to let the killer leave, and if the killer is face camping come in from two different angles so one gets hit and the other unhooked and then that person protects.
---
Yeah I get that completely. I actually play mainly surv. Grind up some points and shit em into a killer. I've only ever messaged other dumbass survivors. Or the killer if his internet is waaack. But never, "Your playstyle is bad. Blocked. Reported. Hur hur hur." The killers are hulking beasts of people, creatures, and mixtures alike. Survs are just peoples tryna survive. That's the game.
---
I‚Äôm making fun of the fact that people go out of their way to try to get a rework for something that literally doesn‚Äôt matter. There‚Äôs real issues in the game that should be addressed but the hill the community chooses to die on is about the face of a character. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm mocking it.
---
We hate you too. We aren‚Äôt the only ones capable of toxicity either. 
---
Shut up and give me my downvote.
---
Ps. If you can‚Äôt tell this is a joke. Not my fault if you read into it too much.
---
sydney is up there too
---
While I agree with the sentiment (change Deep Wounds to power Legion up instead of just being a speed bump), what you have listed would be way too strong.
---
I play Legion a lot and the times where I get two-three Survivors in one activation is actually pretty staggering, so being a untraceable Killer with no Terror Radius for the majority of the Survivors is already pretty strong, and on the off chance you get all four Survivors in it you suddenly become a 125% Movespeed blend of T1 and T3 Myers.
---
And that's compounded by the fact that people may not Mend against Legion due to it not downing them, and if they did mend then we're back at square one where Legion runs away, you find someone, and mend.
---
Oh my god. That is so savage.
---
VERY TRUE... he‚Äôs like the male Jane
---
Hey how's hope and adrenaline work combined? You fast af boy? Haha serious question I'm curious
---
Fair enough.
---
Balanced Landing.
---
YES &amp; when he runs he whines every once in a while too ?? like damn sir
---
my only problem with this is that you can't mend yourself aka if your the last survivor remaining your fucked, make it so you can self mend with a medkit or breathe some life into self cares dead corpse with the ability to self mend (but slower) so you AREN'T fucked.
---
Here's what I have to say
---
*Drum Role*
---
Oink
---
On this one it looks like tire
---
No do not click that, unless you love seeing dicks. A whole lotta dicks.
---
DOWNVOTED FOR LOWERCASE
---
No teabagging. That is honorable.
---
Imagine.
---
okay right tho i‚Äôm not complaining at ALL
---
Out of all the character backstories, The Huntress has the most intriguing one for me. It‚Äôs because of this why I main her as a killer.
---
So you also what Borrowed time nerfed because BT and deep wounds from feral frenzy are the same mechanic half of the survivors I meet never want to heal anyway and run off to go hide and heal themselves. We should be allowed to mend ourselves plus there are add one to increase the mending time for legion. Legion right now is probably the most balanced as he was compared to release of him (like missing a hit takes you out of your power ) if you use him correctly use his feral frenzy more as a awareness to know where other survivors are near you that works so much better
---
Yes I do thank you very much I will now take my blue arrows
---
For the Scooby gang
---
Let‚Äôs split up, gang! - Progress on all actions is 10/15/20% faster when there is nobody within a 20/15/10 meter range 
---
Scooby snacks - Scooby will search for the killer if he‚Äôs nearby, but your health state is reduced if you don‚Äôt give him a Scooby snak 
---
Let‚Äôs see - See who the killer is prior to the match (loading screen)
---
UNDERSTANDABLE. WON'T DENY ITS FUN TO BE TOXIC SOMETIMES
---
How should i do it on PC?
---
I mean you kinda want survivors to keep playing . I personally feel that survivors feelings are kinda important (not saying they're feelings outweigh killers but you get what I mean)
---
Whats even worse is when your against a freddy or playing on maps like lerys or the game
---
quentin is ugly tho. take one look at him then tell me he looks decent with a straght face
---
And they DID get the rights with no restrictions due to the legal battle. The lack of Kyle Gallner's likeness was solely on him and BHVR. Look at you" very tiny brain." Awww, using little boy insults when you know you're wrong due to cognitive dissonance. It's okay fella, stay mad when Quentin's face gets reworked.
---
Who gets the profit then?
---
Love when there's one gen left but the other person lets me die on first hook
---
Oh that's pretty good!
---
Yes digitalize
---
Of course there should be more events. But this game needs quality of life improvements first and foremost and if that means events get delayed or cancelled for the time being, so be it.
---
Atm no. But the movie actor wants it (check his twitter) and a dev dm'ed him about it so hopefully they take him in for a face scan (like Joe Keery did for Steve) and after that hopefully they contact more actors
---
except, they could have asked for the licenses for the likeness..... that could have been arranged, but it wasn‚Äôt..... I‚Äôm a Quentin main, I have no reason to be mad, I just think everyone sounds absolutely braindead saying it‚Äôs confirmed when it‚Äôs literally not.
---
Think of how hard it is to do it though, you literally have to guess which one they have to do and if they get it right they deserve the kill
---
NAH MAN, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU ARE HERE, ONLY MATTERS IF YOU CAN GET AWAY OR GET THOSE KILLS. GOOD LUCK
---
Thx
---
Back off bitch, he's mine.
---
Dont be a shitty killer an let them do 5 gens before killing someone.
---
It‚Äôs the FPS and sensitivity , I know , there‚Äôs an actually video of it side by side pc vs console. I want to try spirit but I‚Äôm committed to nurse already üò™
---
he doesn‚Äôt look as bad as everyone says. I‚Äôm a Quentin main, and I think he looks fine. I think the issue is y‚Äôall have nothing better to complain about because BHVR has given everyone what they‚Äôve been asking for and y‚Äôall can‚Äôt just be content for five minutes ü§£
---
Curious about this myself... I can only think Star Wars? Maybe LotR?
---
Except it hits when it goes through &gt;83
---
That was up there for awhile and no one addressed it? lmao
---
the fact that you've defended this confusing pile of shitpost is truly awe striking. either make it clearer that its a shitpost or delete
---
As a Nea main, we do our best to protect the baby Dwights
---
I get ya. But a lot of survivors treat killers like the enemy team when in reality its another human being behind the screen
---
This is the only way to die to the trap
---
Congratulations! A round of applause! What is your reward you ask? It‚Äôs... LESS SHARDS PER LEVEL!!!
---
I second "block and move on". I have played killer only once but I've also had that toxic behaviour come at me from killers as well. I was accused of hacking the game because they couldn't see scratch marks. Well there won't be any if I don't run ü§∑ there's a lot of idiots on both sides, they might only be salty they weren't the last survivor
---
Don't forget the dedicated servers
---
I think gjostface is freddy teir by this list as well, below hunt hag meyers
---
But what if you are gay as well
---
He just threw them through a defenestration!
---
It‚Äôs literally tagged as a shitpost and is written in the most idiotic way possible. What the hell else should I do? It‚Äôs not my fault y‚Äôall are out here ignoring a flair and blatant sarcasm because you wanna be on the defensive xD
---
Not all survivors are bad, I've met some pretty good ones. I've also seen some pretty bad killers to.
---
I think the survivors are more toxic is because of there lack of control over what the killer does. If the killer does well, they can be accused of cheating. If they don't do well, they are insulted. Both sides need to learn how the other works and realize it's just a game, with a real person on the other side of the screen, at the end of the day most of us are just doing the best we can. If you start getting frustrated, take a break at the end of the match to calm down.
---
Balenced. It is easier for a killer to hit you while valuating a window then falling. If you have dance with me already, then lithe
---
I just disregard "the rules" survivors have.
---
I don't concern myself with ranking up anyway, so it's not like they can use the "you'll never rank up if you camp/tunnel" because I don't care about rank so if I decide I want to be a complete fucking twat I can do that.
---
That being said, when I actually feel like winning the match, Camping wastes time I could spend finding someone else to kill and the only time I tunnel is when I literally cannot find anyone else.
---
I'm not refraining from camping because you said so, I'm refraining from camping because it's inefficient.
---
I *did* play a match as Leatherface a few days ago where I only wanted to go to the basement and camp it regardless of whether or not the survivors ever came down and some poor meg was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Got a 4k for camping the basement the whole match.
---
boi I cant climb higher then rank 12 stfu (partly a joke and part truth)
---
Wouldn't Laurie be a bit harder to do now since the huge age gap between the original Halloween and now unless BHVR has de aging technology that we don't know about
---
Green rank detected

You basically mash wasdw or wdsaw while turning your mouse the opposite direction your character begins moving. So if you press wasdw you move your mouse to the right, wdsaw to the left. Pressing wdsaw/wasdw and doing it correctly will quickly 180 your character, so do it twice for a 360.

 No demo lunge is easy to dodge that‚Äôs why there is a very little cool down his lunge only works in tight narrow spots he doesn‚Äôt need any nerfs at all.

Scanning is but to make Laurie look younger they would need the tools marvel used on Samuel L Jackson in Captain Marvel to make him younger that would be a way and just use original Laurie from the movie. Or better yet add the new Laurie and give Myers a new cosmetic to be the 2018 version

What is no stagger?
---
Why?
---
Like there aren‚Äôt salty killer mains all over this sub too. This sub is just full of general salt. Why can‚Äôt we all just be lame casual players like me?
---
Oh I thought it would of been cool if the killer would have the ability to have a flashlight of some sort or something like that
---
Ok what about the insane range,barely any risk to missing at all, easily canceled still allowing the demogorgon to gain distance(basically instant charge) I just want some tweak to so it has some negative if you cancel it like every single other killer. I'm not asking for his shred to be completely useless just a little more risk to it if you miss
---
Pharmacy is fine
---
I don't care how many Huntresses or Freddies there are at red ranks. I think Freddy is better than Huntress. 
---
Huntress has the worst map pressure in the game, being a 110% killer without mobility. Add to that, she is only good at punishing extremely unsafe loops, provided there are no tall obstacles blocking her throws. Which almost never happens to be the case. Huntress also has a rather large audio warning of her arrival in her 40 meter humming radius. 
---
Huntress addons aren't very versatile either, since she has 
---
- more hatchets 
---
- on hit effects ranging anywhere from blindness to instadowns
---
- windup, cooldown, or reload speeds
---
Meanwhile, Freddy has an above average map presence due to his gen teleport and 115% speed. He also has the ability to shut down even safe loops by using snares, or can punish deadzones by using fake pallets. 
---
Freddy addons are more versatile in nature since he has
---
- random on hits that do very little
---
- aura reveal on his dream snares
---
- dream pallets ranging from basic to aura reveal
---
- game slowdown addons
---
- invisibility addons during the awake state
---
- different sleep cycle addons ranging from permanent sleep on the obsession to all survivors starting asleep
---
No. But I DID!!!!

---
You‚Äôd get more for surviving, so it‚Äôs more of a failsafe
---
Alot of people since the devs said a long time ago all killers were to be humanoid.
---
Ffffffffff... fine, take your upvote.
---
What rules have to do with Killer's ability?
---
Edit: I think you answered to the wrong person XD
---
Really hmmm maybe add a way for the killer to destroy his portals should be an idea like let's say you put one on one side of the map then the rest on the other but that one lone one does nothing because you have no reason to go over there
---
Balanced Landing is much better as it also gives you a passive of not slowing down to a crawl after falling which let's you get to the next Pallet/Vault much faster.
---
Then you have Shelter Woods and like one or two variation maps where the spots you can use it are so out of the way that it's not really worth going over to the area.
---
When I say stagger I mean like when you fall from high spots you slow down a lot for a bit before being full speed again. BL prevents this.
---
 I added a survivor to the chapter
---
This is Major Tom to Ground Control  
---
I'm stepping through the door  
---
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way  
---
And the stars look very different today
---
It's cool and I like it! It's just that It's not powerfull
---
it's fine :p
---
Demogorgon gets stuck under the stairs in the new Hawkins lab map lmfao. dunno how he ended up there
---
It's a shame indeed.. I guess that's why we got baked potato pedo Freddy.
---
I cant fr the life of me figure out to to utilize his portals. I know they are good, but without some tracking perks on him they dont feel amazing
---
You're 2 days too late for that correction, but thanks for pointing out that I forget to edit this comment as well.
---
Eh, it‚Äôs okay. Not exactly a build since it‚Äôs really only the 2 meta perks and 2 good perks, but whateve-
---
Wait a minute...
---
Ew who wants frozen waffles? At least toast them over the fire first.
---
It‚Äôs pretty hard to believe people calling killers op anymore. Any time a killer wins the survivors call him op.
---
Agreed, we are not as toxic as people think. Toxicity is left to the Blendettes and Ash mains these days.
---
As a red rank survivor, the times I see anything more than 2 survivors in deep wound state is insanely rare. Furthermore I‚Äôm about devotion 7 into this game and can confidently say that the vast majority of the time Legion gets about 2 survivors at deep wound state in a given match at max. Furthermore, I think this would incentivize survivors to run perks which give auras of allies as they are often condemned to being a solo queue perk.
---
Demo missing let‚Äôs you gain distance be smart and don‚Äôt fall for it loop tightly and use windows this killer is absolutely fine
---
Freddy was always an implied pedo but they never said that he fully was a pedo until the remake
---
&gt;Can you please clue me in on what you mean by 1 shots
---
Huntress has an add-on that allows her to immediately down people by hitting them with 1 hatchet.
---
Dedicated servers carry a bug that may cause this effect to happen at random even with regular hatchets, no add-ons.
---
True true. As a surv player I'd loop this Hag for like 4 mins. And she'd eventually catch me. She'd then body grind on top of me and tunnel me all game. Just cause she got outplayed. Happened again a few matches later when they recognized me. Same GT. Sad peoples nowadays.
---
Why does he have pubes on the top of his head
---
Nah, bad vision sucks, but it‚Äôs not the end of you if you‚Äôre the last one remaining. It‚Äôs a consequence of getting mended before that point. I guess though requiring a medkit or self-care is a good compromise for that. I just don't think that they should be able to do it by default.
---
I wouldn't say it is just this game, i think toxicity does seem to be more of an issue with PC gaming in general.
---
I just realized I want a Tobey Macguire survivor. Not that he was in any movies that make sense...but for the memes.
---
Thx man
---
It barely let's you gain distance though the cooldown is pretty damn fast. I don't want him to become bad but he definitely needs some tweaking for his cooldown or his cancelling besides that I think he's fine
---
There are some cases when you need to place portal in the map corner to reach some palces fast and later those corner portals become unused and survivors won't even bother destroing those.
---
dude charge your phone
---
How would you make it powerful?
---
It's possible, I mean I'm yellow rank and I still see a fair share of toxic survivors, and it's not even being toxic because I'm being an asshole, they're just being assholes for no reason
---
Probably a lunge attack got him stuck there
---
Yeah, the Trapper could even write his own theme!
---
No, he's balanced around survivors having to destroy your portal. Smart survivors will keep them up when a bad killers places them.
---
I will only take pants ty. I don't like the glasses and her hair looks fake.
---
The truth
---
unless she was doing this at every box I don't think you would've made either way. There is too little time left on your trap although you might've been able to get it off last second. That other guy especially was dead though even without pig doing that if you were using the box.
---
read flair
---
Silly survivor, blinks are for nurse!
---
 I mean I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs much of a nerf of borrowed time. So the  trade is that instead of running off and healing themselves, they have  to go find another survivor or deal with shitty vision. This sounds  perfectly fine to me and I‚Äôm a red rank survivor with 7 devotion.
---
I think it was less about fixing the lag and more about getting rid of lagswitchers... at least that's how I was thinking about it.
---
It's also completely pointless.
---
[This literally took me about 15 seconds](https://i.imgur.com/5YzMsk2.jpg)
---
Its illogical and probably a design flaw
---
Delete your other reply, I'm on mobile and was replying to someone else and clicked on another response and it went to this one. Sorry.  
---
You're asking for the Demogorgon to be in total control of his portals, when we have a say in them as well. What happens to us if you want to add a new portal and we're in the process of closing one? That would be a problem for the development side. 
---
If they made it more like the hag, he wouldn't be a different killer. That's a good balance the way it is now. You're asking for them to unbalance the game.
---
It's not. The devs post about it already.
---
That's not the killers fault, your team is the one at fault, if the killer DCs you get the escape points, otherwise it's just what you have to put up with in your game. The lost points in chases, hooks, hits, and gen damages mount up to way more than the small amount the killer gets.
---
In chase a few seconds is enough distance I‚Äôm curious what rank are u? Not trying to be rude just wondering
---
Don‚Äôt forget quick and quiet to activate it silently in the first place.
---
This *would* work if it weren‚Äôt for one glaring flaw; witches aren‚Äôt hostile. They‚Äôre docile until they are bothered. Not to mention that killers are single individuals (plus the Legion), but there are countless witches in the L4D universe. The Entity wouldn‚Äôt just pick one mindless crybaby zombie for a job like that.
---
Skemooo whos is your favorite character in dbd?
---
Huge parts of the map have no terrain even if you count the trees. And his lunge is super fast with minimal punishment if you miss, especially considering you've closed the gap even if you miss.
---
Fair, yes theoretically a killer just say F the win and tunnel down 1 guy for the purposes of being jerk to that person specifically and happily leaving with just that one kill because of toxicity.  Ya got me there.  But you have to admit that is pretty darn rare.
---
I return to my example of being outclassed. 
---
Killers rarely deliberately ignore their objective (getting kills) just to lengthen survivors pain.  Rather (unless they are having pitty on you) they go for the easiest kills,  even if that means ignoring then heathy survivor doing the unhooking for the injured one.  That act is not toxic. Survivors will happily ignore their objective (escaping) in order to get in a few good tbags.
---
Are those prosthetic toes or you're actual feet? Good lord.
---
To be fair, the Entity can't seem to do anything of real significance either.
---
Self sustaining? Can't do that.
---
Be an interesting character with any personality? Can't do that.
---
Take smokes away from 80 year old war veterans? Too hard lol
---
I am honestly convinced that what is really going on is random cosmic events and "the entity" is just some made up bologna crafted by the journalist who is a guy that lost his sanity a long time ago and needed to centralize all of the random events to one culprit as a coping mechanism.
---
Yeah. I mean in higher ranks there is still the couple of oddballs that are toxic. But I feel in purple and red ranks you've played the game enough that you just wanna have fun now. Which a lot of people do, including myself.
---
They dont give buffs post trial though, just during the trial. 
---
Each of the 4 categorys has a 8000 bp cap, giving you 32000 max per match.
---
Beast of prey, thrill, and distressing only help you reach the 8000 bp cap for a certain category, meaning you they dont give you that much bp. 
---
BBQ, however, applies POST-TRIAL, which means that it gives you 2x bp at 4 stacks, up to 64000.
---
Thats why the other bp perks arent usually run for bp farming, because they only apply inside the trial for earning bp. BBQ exceeds the cap and affects you outside the trial, which is what op meant
---
Same. And the way I see it is you're rarely looking at his face.
---
literally just don‚Äôt look at him
---
I mean as in fix his power so when im looking at him it actually counts. But I wouldn't mind having him be easier to spot since he can just retreat behind a wall for half a sec and force exposed on you, and only assholes play him at high ranks
---
This isn‚Äôt shit compared to what happened to me last night, im a level 13 killer and got matched with 3 level 2s and a level 6.
---
With Kyle and MCote
---
But i mean in this case, hitting them or blocking it doesnt make a difference because they'd be dead regardless. (timer was almost up)
---
 Standing there for 3 minutes as the timer goes down , now that's ridiculous and unnecessary.
---
The game I played with them wasn‚Äôt in to but it‚Äôs still cool to see them in game
---
If they can give a new face with the beanie and be p3 I'd be happy.  Never liked not having beanie quentin.
---
It is just the Longer Guide Bar addon DUH
---
I get frustrated for the teabagging for no reason, for harassing me even when I lose and things like that, I don't mind losing at all, it's part of the game. I've also seen some nice survivors, one said sorry for winning by looping me, another just sent gg but for every one of those I have a full lobby of teabagging bloddy megs with a full build and 5 ranks on me
---
Humanoid, but not Human.
---
Not gonna lie, I REALLY like these perks and the character being in the game even if it isn't a likelihood.
---
Actually now that I think of it, when I watch streamers and youtubers in high ranks they seem to have a good time and the survivors are toxic at all
---
Yup! The problem is people don't understand the difference between "human" and "humanoid"
---
&gt;Bottom lines is they are just increasing the amount of perks that show up in a higher level bloodweb and how many you can get per level before the others get locked out. It's not as major as people were hoping for but it is something.
---
Not as major? It literally cuts the amount of total bloodweb in half past level 50. Before this new bloodweb I needed 1.000.000 bloodpoints to get recently unlocked teachables level 3 on 2 old characters.
---
In this PTB after unlocking Nancy's perks, I got all of her level 3 perks on 2 other survivors with half a million.
---
Saying the Demogorgon's mori is brutal is a bit of an exaggeration, especially when thinking about how he could've mauled the survivor's face or completely bit their head off in comparison to what we got.
---
I mean. Portal gets destroyed and survivors will get their action canceled.
---
Same with unfinished generator, when other survs finish the last generator while you sitting in the middle of repairing another generator.
---
Or just give the ability to directly destroy his holes when hes standing on them.
---
This is comedy gold idk what you're on about
---
Well you asked for the down vote so I'll give you an up vote out of spite
---
wouldnt even be a look of concern/worry, itd just be impatience
---
True,but hey,can't blame someone for dreaming right? I mean,Demogorgon also isin't a single entity but they just got into the game. So yeah,not that far fetched.
---
About the hostility,well,Leatherface isin't hostile unless you disturb him or his family,and he's still here. Same for  Witch,she's only hostile if you disturb her.
---
Link? Not calling you a liar, but i just want to be sure.
---
Can definitely see the Autohaven influence in this.
---
are you in pc
---
I had white pallets the other day and they scared me more than the Michael on my ass
---
&gt;Or just give the ability to directly destroy his holes when hes standing on them.
---
That would be the best solution. Make it double the speed of a survivor closing them.
---
From what I've seen Shaun is a pretty highly suggested survivor. So you never know
---
I'll have to go back through my 50 million posts where someone posted it. Give me some time.
---
Hell yeah. Devs and numbers are right. Every streamer I play against is toxic. Tell me they want my parents to die and want me to get shot in the next school shooting. Streamers are the last place on this planet I would get info from.
---
I can feel your pain
---
We make a werewolf and rework demogorgon but how do we do so?
---
To be honest I don't much care about frequency of any of it occuring and debating the mental effects of being outclassed. I was simply flabbergasted by you saying you didnt think killers can be toxic
---
[Watermarks are pointless.](https://i.imgur.com/AC4M7b2.jpg)
---
Rank 3 for survivor for killer since I haven't played that side in a month rank 9 . In a Chase a few seconds is enough for distance but for the demogorgon missing I believe it's only a second maybe? Honestly I hope I'm wrong and it's just me being salty or something but in my opinion him missing or cancelling could need 2  or 1 seconds. This is just from first impressions and watching YouTubers and maybe I just haven't learn to counter it?
---
Wait so can someone explain to me what the lunge does? Does it instantly down the player? Does it have a multiplier? Does it just hurt them?
---
I have a better idea. How about we make the killer actually viable first?
---
[Watermarks are pointless.](https://i.imgur.com/z2i6FVN.jpg)
---
fake
---
[http://prntscr.com/p2evws](http://prntscr.com/p2evws)
---
Yea that's kinda the point it's forcing you to play smart with your portals and think what could happen later in the match
---
Do you think I run dead by daylight? I was just sharing a concept I've had for a while no need to be ratchet.
---
I second this. 
---
And before people say "LeGiOn Is StIlL vIaBlE.... Reeee"
---
not pictured: the person with a flashlight and head on following you

thankyou.gif

I don‚Äôt know if monsters are ‚Äúa thing‚Äù. This might just be a one-time thing.
---
[Watermarks are pointless.](https://i.imgur.com/f4902bd.jpg)
---
Is he Quentin's actor?
---
Yeah one of them was guaranteed dead anyways.  Might as well take the extra kill.
---
Let's say you get blinded when your looping, you lose all direction and the chances of you just running into a wall is very high causing you to get a hit
---
This is very toxic, but it is pretty funny.
---
Idk dont use the keys i guess
---
It is almost exactly the length of the Killer Shack.
---
Source: I'm boosted af and got looped around it for 3 gens
---
It‚Äôs at least 3 seconds also play more killer and you‚Äôll see why he is fine
---
Sorry not a better shot, she changed back after getting into the locker
---
Bald as a peach, as they say
---
somebody watches no0b3 lol
---
I'M SO FUCKING TIRED OF GETTING INTO A GAME WITH 2 YELLOW RANKS AND A GREEN ONLY TO HAVE THE GREEN RANK QUIT AT THE FIRST SIGN THE KILLER ISN'T TRYING TO DERANK. IT'S PITIFUL TO SEE A GREEN RANK WITH 4 LVL 3 PURPLE PERKS QUITTING AGAINST A LVL 3 SPIRIT OR GHOSTFACE. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED YOU FUCKING CHUMPS.
---
LAST NIGHT I HAD A GAME WITH A BABY BUBBA A RED AND 2 GREEN. POOR BUBBA.        FIX THE FUCKING RANKS YOU GUYS PLEASE. I BET YOU CAN GET IT DONE BEFORE THE ST DLC GOES LIVE.
---
still not worth a power, less if you have to wait to change to it. maybe a good perk tho, with a 1 second blind, maybe every time you hook obsession you gain a stack, pressing e blinds surv and uses up a stack
---
That sounds like a you problem.
---
Have you tried doing gens?
---
Here‚Äôs the thin; the Demogorgon *is* a single entity. They didn‚Äôt show us multiple Demogorgons in Season 1. Meanwhile, in the campaign Hard Rain, you‚Äôll encounter about 5 witches in one part.
---
As for Leatherface, he‚Äôs aggressive to those who enter or even go near his domain. The realms of the Entity are his domain now. A witch just sits around, and occasionally walks around, crying.
---
And I just remembered another factor that details the suggestion- witches are known for their ungodly speed and ability to instantly down, or even kill, with one swipe. This speed would be far too overpowered, and the witch would be extremely slow when not enraged.
---
But yeah, a gamer can dream.
---
Freddy, pig, and plague are great choices. They all have pretty solid powers and pretty good ability to win except those games only nurse or spirit could pull off. 
---
Edit: and hag too, as the one person said previously.
---
Hm that sounds interesting
---
The Plague was released in Spring. They joined in he Summer. It was likely Ghostface‚Äôs theme.
---
Survivors are squeaky toys full of bloodpoints.
---
That‚Äôs scary
---
Great!
---
I edited it essentially saying that survivors wouldn't be able to mend by default, much like heal. However, they'd be able to mend if they have a med-kit or self-care.
---
Bruh if the leatherface kept charging the chainsaw, the unhook wouldnt be possible because the leatherface would down you before you finished the unhook animation
---
*laughs in bamboozle*
---
love it when the lore matches up with the gameplay, except people couldn't ragequit in the movies when they found out the traps are inescapable..
---
99% Pig proxy camps and tunnels.
---
Pretty much lol
---
It's during a chase. They talked about making it inside her TR, but that didn't even make it to PTB iirc.
---
Good for you, for me the game ends when the survivors leave or die, and I keep playing until either of those happen. If I can make the game last longer I sure as hell will, better than waiting in fucking queue.
---
Well I‚Äôm pretty bad. I only managed to sabo hooks.
---
Damn
---
Definitely but I hold Laurie higher tbh she‚Äôs the OG
---
Same same....
---
If one of them was legion that'd be a pretty cool bit.
---
Your telling me you dont join em? Bro they groovin
---
How did they even get into this situation?  This is either some serious potato play by the survivors or some 200 IQ play by the Pig.  
---
Either way, well deserved.
---
Ha got'em
---
Make sure it's not your internet. I'm not saying it is, but you don't wanna lose anymore precious items if that was the case.. right?
---
I'd agree with that, except we both know that this game has the shittiest match making in gaming. 
---
Only in DBD is it possible to pair up a max rank player against a literal 1st time player.
---
And from the way that GF was playing, they were either completely new, or the only 4k they were getting was in their ping.
---
nnnnnnYOOM
---
And then it's just a Shroud of Separation instead
---
I was told demodogs were young Demogorgons and i tought that by extension that meaned multiples since another Demogorgon appeared in Season 3, but ok,coudl've been the same one i guess.
---
I was pretty sure the entity could just torture and shape the witch into whatever it wants anyway since its what it did to other killers too.
---
You do have fair points still tho.
---
Except the last one.
---
Like c'mon man,Freddy can literally reshape the dream world to what he wants and kill people whenever  he wants in them,yet he's not doing it in DBD. Why? Because the Entity dictates that he can't. Why not apply the same for Witch?
---
Anyways i don't want to turn this so far wholesome comment section into a heated discussion so i'l just stop here.
---
I do lol
---
"LeGiOn Is StIlL vIaBlE iF yOu DoN't UsE hIs PoWeR" 
---
Like that?
---
I mean, it should be hard, right?
---
Just you, those perks are common
---
It's my signature
---
I got a message once being called toxic because I ran the killer for 5 gens and I got face camped for it and died, apparently according to that person looping the killer for too long is toxic and I deserve to die.
---
This is funny, image for April 1st there is this as a taunt and it actual blinds the killer for 5 seconds.. lol
---
Whoever put this together is definitely going to the ranch
---

---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d08go1/thats_a_lot_of_leveling_up/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
If Freddy gets a rework Quentin should have one too after all!
---
I personally think that ever Killer is way too OP. There's a lot of games where you're literally helpless against the Killer.
---
Yeah as far as I understand, according to the show (spoilers obv), the mind flayer somehow produces the eggs which the demogorgon spawn will hatch out of as basically a slug in phase 1 and grow through phases like cat-size and dog-size and so on until fully grown as what we've seen is gonna be added to the game (phase 5).
---
The demogorgons are controlled as vessels by the mind flayer and i think the mind flayer itself is 'laying' the eggs. It self-reproduces but its offspring aren't clones (since they don't grow up to be their own mind flayers), but they still share identical dna presumably.
---
The demogorgon we're getting isn't gonna be some special one according to the lore more than likely, it'll just be a generic escaped demogorgon got eaten by the entity and pooped out in dbd or something.
---
so no it got no dick or pusy me think, it just an it
---
true
---
I just want him to be fast again. They can literally keep all the nerfs. I enjoyed being speedy gurl and boi
---
No .. and the DLC is not free.
---
unfortunately, the game runs the best on low, my computer isn't the greatest :(
---
It did, the wiki has no connections to the actual devs, it was a straight lie which devs have said on the dbs forums
---
Damn dude buy a lottery ticket because that's some real bona fide luck.
---
Honestly, this is the right mindset. Fuck whiny survivors/killers. Play however you want.
---
First off i think it should probably work as a charged ability, like the chainsaw and release the light within a cone in front of you, without the need of switching, i think survivors should probably be oblivious while blinded and that you should do some addons to support the ability.
---
Repost
---
People are wild man. Im waiting for a "powering exit gates is toxic."
---
Some people tell me this game melts pcs for some reason. Beyond me why tho. It's a game where a dude walks behind another dude and smacks him with a hammer or some other similar weapon.
---
If you instantly cancel as soon as you start charging it and do a regular attack then you will still lose/gain STBFL stacks normally.  Otherwise, it doesn't interact with STBFL.
---
Never saw it but if you say so
---
Never fails that the comments have the answer. Shame this comment reply cant be stickied.
---
Where did you get the image?
---
Oh that's great! Looks like toxic Nea to me.
---
pretty much lol, hopefully other people speak up about it so the devs can get wind of it.
---
Every time that happens I just chase till they are dead. Typically the other three escape, but yes bagger is dead.
---
In a post on twitter
---
You do realize that simply giving **bonus bp's** to survivors when teammates dc doesn't hurt or take away from the killer in any way, shape, or form. Are you acting obtuse on purpose?
---
you re right on this situation, but at least in my experience 9/10 Leather face are campers waiting nearby with the chainsaw ready
---
They should just deactivate items in the ptb
---
Dab on the void to assert dominance
---
Jason already has his own game and I don‚Äôt think they would give the rights to use him
---
I can hear this image.
---
And HOW many people complain that Nurse is overpowered and needs changes? Oh right. EVERYONE. Thats a shitty example. 
---
He doesn't need any changes, hes fine.
---
Replace pig with myers
---
I‚Äôve been having the same problem, sitting at 1m + shards for all shrine perks, waiting to dump them all into Demo and Nancy for perks then probably going to prestige Steve.
---
Other than that I just keep dumping 100k points into trapper for some extra bags and iri stones
---
So? That means there can be more than one if they can grow up. You just proved me right :/
---
So the same argument applies for noed then?
---
Thats what the fucking ptb is for you tard
---
Decaitation is probably a big stepping stone in terms of maturity rating. I think it looks good, but doing something as simple as removing the head would make it better.
---
I'm sure with camera tricks, or removing the body from the map, it could happen - it just might not be as faithful to the series.
---
No. That's not what I was referring to. Ignoring everyone in sight/closer, to target someone whose at a considerable distance.
---
Oh my god thank you so much
---
Pallet Freddy is A+

Bruh that's the meme i made a year ago

It's not completely prevented, it's a 75% reduction.

Downvote cuz nobody

I feel like you were trying to make a joke, but you accidentally... didn't.
---
Sadly I live in my own apartment, It also looks more like a yellow on my screen \^\^
---
Yes, and adrenaline, hope, wake up, etc. end game perks mean you‚Äôre playing 90% of the game down however many of your perks only work after the last gen is done/you‚Äôre the last alive. This build is basically playing like you‚Äôre a baby Dwight who didn‚Äôt know how to put on perks until either everyone is dead or the last gen is done
---
Tbf, in my screen it looks more like a yellow.

It's a little bit more nuanced than that. The goal is to get them off generators. You can divert them from that and still give them fun gameplay. Holding mouse one and occasionally tapping space isn't really the height of fun.

I swapped a Teleport four times with the Hag and hit a survivor and got a Teleport four times with the Hag and hit a survivor.

Jeff's eyebrows look like they've been attacked by fleas
---
My stomach was making the rumblies that only heads could satisfy.
---
They better make it a cosmetic.
---
ah true,it's probs ghostface then
---
Which is already what most of the game is anyway so this doesn't REALLY fix that all that much. Unless you rework the entire gen system and other interactions it wont make enough to matter
---
The entity really wants you to play hag
---
If I was the killer I would end up only using it after the second hook to get more bloodpoints.
---
I never run flashlights even in custom games because I never think I can pull off a save.

*He says, having pulled a successful flashlight save almost every single time he has tried it.*

The only time I use flashlights are when the current item I brought has been used or is laying on the floor somewhere thanks to Franklin's Demise. I just need something in my hands.

To this point I believe it works like this: the copyright allows BHVR to use the name Quentin in an official capacity as a direct link to the character portrayed in Nightmare on Elm Street.  Because BHVR never had permission from the actor to use his exact likeness they didn't bother crossing that line to find out what would happen.  However, the model they created belongs to BHVR, not New Line.  The name in the capacity it is being used as belongs to New Line.  Depending on the language this will probably allow BHVR to change the in-game character model to whomever they choose at any given time.  They could even use the likeness of Tom Holland if they wanted to.  Of course that wouldn't go over well if Tom didn't give them written permission, but in this case Kyle is giving his expressed permission.

It doesn't incentivize selfish play.

Does car insurance incentivize you to drive recklessly?
---
You can only do so much, but if your teammates literally cannot stay on their feet, it's nice to have a perk for insurance if that's how you feel about it.
---
I dont know, what are people on pornhub for? Doing taxes
---
This meme would be a lot better with more realism, I agree with the first picture but the second one should be replaced entirely with the golden glasses black guy. That‚Äôs what I imagine my teammates are doing when they see me dying on a hook.
---
Just because their faces don‚Äôt get ripped off like you want them to doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not brutal lmao
---
That‚Äôs rad
---
Woah, why are you getting mass downvoted? It would be stupid to ignore your obssesion if you have dying light, the perk demands that you DO tunnel him. I wouldn't go to any extreme to do it, but if I had line of sight of him over other survivors I would 100% chase him.
---
Plus, in my eyes you don't even need the excuse of that perk to tunnel if you want to, 90% of the time its the wrong move, but if it works for the situation at hand or you just want to mindlessly throw the game just do it, whats the problem?

every time I see this I audibly yell
