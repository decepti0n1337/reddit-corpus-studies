Why would I stay at one place and wait for heal, as I wrote in my og comment, if I can contribute to the game?
---

---
Seriously a person with a measly 100 hours in game knows better.
---
---
---
The music makes me think of the ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù. And it also really makes me want a western themed DLC.
---
Name would have been GobblinxKing. Loadout would have been: Tier Two BBQ; Tier one Agitation; Tier one Deerstalker; Tier two Brutal Strength. I was the trapper that game.
---
I specifically remember that triple stun, in that order, on that map, and at that pallet. You were giving me the runaround all game, but I felt like I did fairly well on that chase. Save for whiffing that attack before picking you up, because console aiming is HORRID.
---
Worst part of it all? I practically wasn't even mad. A triple stun off of a decent chase? It's like, I'm not even mad at that point. Just impressed. But also, extremely tilted. I play much better on PC everyone, I promise D:
---
Never thought I'd run into the situation where I found someone I played with on this subreddit, even though you see meetings decently often. But, uh. Yeah. The comments in this thread are all correct. I assure you wholeheartedly. That trapper was not okay ;x.x
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\*\*EDIT\*\*
---
I think I was probably confused? The comments led me to believe this was a console game. But I think it was actually a PC clip. In which case, I have precious little defense. But, it was still me.
---
Name would have been finnpanther. Loadout would have been: Tier three BBQ; Tier three Agitation; Tier three Save The Best For Last; Tier three Pop Goes The Weasel.
---
In either case, it was a decent play you made. And a completely unfortunate series of events.
---
I try to reward decent players by letting them go after I slaughter the weak. Clauddet is a 30% D/C so I never have to worry about letting them go XD.
---
Adorbs he just wants to join the fun
---
Can't slug me for the 4k if you can't slug me. Checkmate killers.
---
You should see someone, Posting here is like posting in the wild west. Everyone has these feelings, some people have them worse than others, some people less..
---
you didn't ruin anyones day.
---
Your brain is lying to you, you opinions have value. You matter. Please don't let these intrusive thoughts run your life. Take our advice and call the suicide prevention number, they are really, truely, there to listen.
---
You know what? 99.999999% of people who commit suicide don't really want to die. They are just confused, and in pain. Just like when you hurt your back or break a leg: you do therapy to get better. Talking to someone REALLY helps! I promise.

Pack is amazing

Next Christmas update this should be the lobby theme

---
Thank you! Axe-FX ;)
---
Actually many have, Everyone who uses him tends to  cry 
---
 "Another nerf?!"
---
Yeah I‚Äôm surprised this isn‚Äôt her chase music. The license owners seem pretty chill with how bhvr does cosmetics for them. So I‚Äôm sure they would be cool with the chase music being this. However music is a little tricky because there can multiple people to pay royalties to if they do get a deal.
---
Whats the third perk you use?
---
Its a decent build but i would run spirit fury over either monitor or tinkerer
---
You‚Äôre saying that plague cannot hit a survivor over a wall with her corrupt purge? I mean huntress can also hit targets she can‚Äôt see
---
In this photo it‚Äôs deliverance but this build isn‚Äôt what I like to run typically
---
All bad builds
---
What's the problem with the two fossils having a meeting?
---
She‚Äôs one cool cat
---
Jake looks like Levi from AOT and its beautiful.
---
They work for me ok, i just want to know about Billy :(
---
congrats
---
I'm not gonna lie I did cry originally that legion was nerfed. However all my fellow legion mains out here. This was a buff as now his power shifted to now cover mobility and if you use bamboozle on him it's pretty disgusting how you can engage in powerful map tiles or loops and force the survivor to either take a hit or ruin the loop for the whole game
---
Imagine no mither getting worse?
---
What would you run besides DS Dead Hard and Adrenaline?
---
There should be a "has a considerable chance of not working".
---
Southern region. Deep southern, lol.
---
If it was you what character did you sacrificed at the end??
---
Lithe is by far my favorite exhaustion perk, iron will is amazing, bond is amazing, sometimes I like to run botany knowledge, and non-meta perks
---
He's telling me his bowl is empty üôÇ
---
If an over haul and making his power something different is not an option I‚Äôd say make deep wounds more scary in some way considering right now its literally a joke
---
Gonna cry Frank?
---
literally everyone will run it because itd be a get out of jail free card, and all killers would facecamp to deny it. its literally pre-rework ds
---
*Feral Frenzy insta-downs*
---
Actually Pepega
---
Hawkins and The Game as Survivor.
---
Mt Ormond and The Game as Killer.
---
Playing Trapper or Hag on the Game is painful, and these are the Killers I play the most. I can't see any auras properly on Ormond.
---
I hate totem spawns, hook spawns and generator spawns on Hawkins and the Game as a Survivor plus most of the map is simply a deathtrap.
---
 But those benefits aren‚Äôt worth it
---
As a Clown and Doctor main (when I actually play killer), without add-ons, probably Clown.
---
With add-ons it's closer, I'd say Clown actually has pretty good add-ons, even excluding Pinky Finger, but it really feels like you need 4 add-on slots or something. Most of Doc's add-ons are just kind of gimmicky or make your power worse for chase but better for farming.
---
Lmao killer goes afk "I hate campers"
---
Thank you! Once i get it in my blood web I'll definitely try it
---
If you ran enduring he would never need mad grit because he would already have it. Plus you call him tyant and tyrant.
---
The deal would basically be along the lines of:
---
&gt; BHVR will pay X amount to which party owns the rights after the lawsuit is decided.
---
So long as each party would be happy with X, then neither would have a reason not to. The two parties aren't making a deal with each other.
---
I‚Äôm the exact same way. I was forever around rank 10-20, because I‚Äôd play other games, etc...I‚Äôve recently set down to try and am a couple pips away from rank 1 myself! After I hit it, I‚Äôll go back to doing personally fun builds that might not be the best for ranking up.
---
You se him moving fast because he's big af
---
Blood orbs aren't blood pools, so the perk works perfectly ;D
---
I'd really like even a basic bot mode with AI who do simple loops or something, just to get used to powers like Nurse, Huntress, and Oni.
---
Lots of people have said how lmao
---
I'll add some perks to the ink collection (DS and BT, still thinking about the other two). Maybe you should check their icons and choose the ones that represent your personality, your actual loadout or the ones you think that look better :) Killer's power icons look great too!
---
A cup of water next to a cat, next to a computer... you‚Äôre playing a dangerous game
---
yes you do. you can not point shoot over a wall that is taller than the killer as the puke becomes useless as it drops back down. it has an effective range, once it travels to that effective range it no longer causes infection or damage. the same goes for huntress, if the wall is taller than the killer, you can't hit a survivor on the other side if it
---
i think in tier 2 he vaults windows as if he has bamboozle and in tier 3 he vaults it even faster
---
NoEd on Spirit is overkill and is just toxic.
---
How
---
They didn't kill anyone, it was those damn knives.
---
I like the M&amp;A and Tinkerer on Billy. They're gimmicky and fun when they work
---
If they don't want to get one shot they can do totems
---
I like legion a lot, my second go to killer (I play casually)
---
When you‚Äôre pig crouching and someone you haven‚Äôt seen all game slams a pallet on your face
---
Blind as they‚Äôre hooking a survivor it still counts
---
lay down some symbols
---
5 HAG DUPLICATES JUMP IN FACE AAGGHHHHHHH!
---
i mean, haha, scared you didnt i survivor
---
He's pretty good, drinks from it but if it ever gets knocked over I did it.
---
Ironic how if he let you crawl for 2 more seconds you would‚Äôve died loll
---
It honestly sucks.
---
Using certain perks ain‚Äôt toxic lmao
---
These were two randoms, and while they might be in a SWF I've never seen them before.
---
Also bruh. Stop being triggered.
---
Hey so ive had dbd for a minute now and I levelled up my Meg to a level 17 and Claudette to a 4. How do I get the self-healing perk for Meg or do i just have to wait to find it on the bloodweb
---
Alright. Just making sure. :)
---
to reiterate; LoS is when you have a clear path with or without an obstacle in between you and the survivor with an opening large enough for you to either stalk or launch a projectile at the given survivor. LoS is NOT only when you have the ability to walk at and M1 the survivor
---
I made it better
---
So many sweaty survivors in these comments that only run DS phew. It‚Äôs like a sauna. Play killer once in a while holy Jesus.
---
what device can u get it on
---
Gonna give it to ya is fucking hilarious
---
Ah, a fellow daywalker I see.
---
I'm on Xbox in red ranks for killers and survivor. Solo survivor queues take 5 mins tops. SWF takes like 10. And killer is under a minute.
---
Mans can't he has little man syndrome
---
Same matchmaking issues as it's always had... We get it...
---
All the killers to me are Saminations representation of them now lol
---
A great April Fools joke would be for BHVR to replace Trapper's chase music with "Here Comes the Crapper"
---
hentai *haven*
---
Congrats!
---
Everything about this was incredible. Your wife has a lovely voice and the clips were hilarious. 
---
Also... you got all four Legions with Jeff in KYF? That's all sorts of amazing.
---
Legion overperforming, pls nerf
---
I really like it but the stats are a little bit unbalanced  
---
1% or 0.5% per 10% would be the best, so he can stay at normal base speed without being "op chase killer speed"  
---
It need the current "if they stun you, you lose your power" thing and the pallet thing is too low you need to increase it tremendously or you could make it to not to only pallets but for any vault actions with a considerable increase  
---
not hitting anyone needs to be more punishable, 3 seconds is too low, make it 6 or something like that    
---
also a little bit of balancing: he cant lose his terror radius or his red stain.
---
As a sector main I see where your coming from but once you get the timing down on zapping your un beatable stoping saves vaults and just about anything really helps out all he really takes is skill
---
Looks like you did fine.
---
On the right side, on his arms
---
Oni is a very fun killer to play as, you won't regret buying him. Sure, you might not do too good in the beginning with him but once you get used to his power you will find him pretty great to play as (unless you're in console)
---
"The Corpsegrinder" i met him once. he lives a few hours (or lived im not sure if he moved) from me. him and his dad were fishing in a resort town near us and i just happened to run into him. sweetest dude ever
---
You're so patronizing
---
That doesn't work at all
---
Anything to get rid of Buckle Up. What a garbage perk. And I feel like it doesn‚Äôt even fit Ash that well.
---
Flip Flop: Perfect for Ash, he survives against the odds.
---
Mettle of Man: Decently fits him, he‚Äôll put it all on the line to save someone he cares about, and it encourages Ash to be noticed and targeted as he so often is. The killer seeing your aura and obsession downside also fits with his uncanny ability to get into trouble. 
---
Buckle Up: Is Ash really all that good at getting people out of sticky situations? Almost everyone he knows ends up dead. 
---
I like OP‚Äôs perk because besides Ash‚Äôs obvious connection to the Necronomicon, it shows how Ash is willing to make a deal with the devil at the cost of his own safety
---
?
---
üòÇüòÇ I don't get snow :(
---
Well your CLEARLY not listening, a killer will still pip if he camps minimum of 2 people. And I actually have freinds that might be difficult for u to understand
---
rancor?
---
Edit: Also, doesn't make your choice work in a similar way? You could speed/phase/teleport back to the hook, down the survivor and still go after the unhooker despite its purpose to deter camping/tunneling.
---
Clown needs addons
---
Same with Doctor.
---
Compare these two addon changes.
---
Bigger radius with tonic
---
Or
---
Old Freddy, but instead of slowing them down in actions, it's stop whatever they're doing.
---
Clown is worse, but they're a one at a time killer which is a problem... Doctor has tools to slow down the game atleast.
---
You didn't really present him with an argument to counter, so he's kind of left dead in the water. It seems to be a consensus anyway that a lack of sensitivity changes on console make flicking with oni impossible, which needs to b changed.
---
&gt;oh boo fucking hoo. one killer can in some way counter your precious little playstyle. cry me a river
---
Only he doesn't just counter something (indicating he's effective but not flawless). He completely nulifies it, unlike other killers
---
Cry more, survivor main
---
I mean rank does matter though
---
Scott's got two great guides, one specifically for huntress.
---
How to not be bad at killer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UoymuGcBzY
---
Huntress tips: https://www.youtube.com/watch?
---
They 100% do discard all of them for they wont ban for something that is a part of game's mechanic (camping n' tunneling). Everyone play the way they want to, even though it can be unfun for some, it is allowed
---
sounds terrifying. i‚Äôm in. but let‚Äôs make his terror radius ‚Äúx gon give it to ya‚Äù üòÇüòÇ
---
I just finished a culture win as Cree today. So much fun.
---
Clown will
---
Fuck. Your. Shit up. In indoor maps.
---
They have ceilings, good Clown mains ALWAYS aim high, so hitting one of those will clog the entire map up it feels like. That map sucks in general
---
So you got a survivor who was dumb enough not to recover immediately to full once you slugged him? That's one in a million, and doesn't make me wrong.
---
Not really. I‚Äôve met so many purple/red rank killers and survivors that were absolute shit. Rank just means you put a lot of time into the game, but I would strongly disagree if you say that the only reason people get to red ranks is cause of skill
---
Once you pare down the information you process, once you start really getting used to killer, the crows become helpful. It's remarkable how much information they give, especially when someone is on the other side of a rock while you're checking the gen they were on a bit ago.
---
I don't use that perk, Spies from the Shadows, and I find myself noticing crows landing more often than taking off.
---
It‚Äôs more their characterisation and the backstory of how they came to killing someone.
---
No, I slugged him. Then slugged 2 survivors while he got up. Then downed and hooked him.
---
Cringe
---
If ya a killer it's a way to find servivers early in the game but it's very unlikely. 
---
Other things like crows returning tells you a person came by here recently
---
They're basically just little hints to the killer.  But I don't think most even pay attention to them just kinda there
---
pairing this with ds so i don't miss it and look like a clown anymore :(
---
Okay, Loud Mouth Hoe.
---
Well, your hard work made an amazing video and I'm so glad you shared it with us. Enjoy the silver!
---
I honestly thought this was a BBQ joke until I read the title and comments.
---
I've been saying this for a while. They could make a lot of money.
---
Don‚Äôt you love the rank 20 fengs who never look back in a chase and drops pallets despite the killer being 20 meters away.
---
I swear the amount of crows has increased or maybe I'm going crazy. But I'm on the "idc" boat. It's only if I'm trying to walk around a killer where they shit me. I'd prefer to just run and not be exposed.
---
Well done
---
Because every totem is super easy to find.
---
Oh. I play two trap killers, I've probably just trapped it without thinking.
---
Do not mind him
---
Yup
---
Hillbilly &amp; Claudette.
---
Tbh I‚Äôd get rid of noed, it‚Äôs better to have 4 perks the whole game, for legion I would add bbq &amp; chilli and for spirit I would add devour hope or ruin
---
Also I‚Äôd swap out ruin on billy for infectious fright
---
Everyone just looking to pick a fight on reddit I suppose?
---
Who censors god damnit...? In an M rated game?
---
Ezplain please op buddy ol pal?
---
One thing that keeps on scaring me all the time is the Doctor. That first initial scream you get when you level up madness because you do not know who the killer is and you didn't see them. Gets worse for me when I'm the one who screams first, so I have nothing to prepare for.
---
Perks should cover your weakness or enhance your strengths. Personally M&amp;A is good but I would rather go with BBQ , Whispers or Bitter Murmur. I like tracking perks with Billy.
---
OMG. That's my first silver in my whole entire time on reddit. Thank you so much ‚ù§  I'm so glad that people liked what we shared with them ü•≥
---
Bill gang out here
---
I don't know. Her bio said she started sleeping around lol.
---
Thank you
---
Just because one rando slugged one person doesn't make my statement wrong.
---
Imagine not being able to read and just responding with a quote out of context as your only defense. 
---
When Peanits said if you have them you keep them, he meant in the context of the patch going live. If you had Bill's perks on any characters, they would stay on those characters and would not be removed. If a character didn't have them, you would have to level up Bill to 40 to unlock all his perks on all bloodwebs.
---
So if you don't have his teachables and you prestige, you lose everything associated with that character. Now that Bill is on console those perks are locked teachables, so you need him to be level 40 for them to show up on other characters' bloodwebs.
---
It's your own fault for not looking into it. Why would it make sense that you get to have unlocked teachables for a character you never leveled up? They were only non-teachables beforehand because the devs didn't want console players to miss out on his perks, so they made them generic. When Bill came out, they became teachables.
---
*Crying in the lowest quality*
---
Aww it sucks that happens to you, i only miss the ds skill checks when the killer is laggy
---
I hope you suffered
---
&gt; doing gens, you?
---
Someone introduced me to that video last week and I'm still in disbelief. Nobody can be that terrible and self-assured, right?
---
Cleansing is bad sometimes but you do have solid points. If you are good at juking corrupt purge, have a good map with a lot of debris everywhere and don't stick together corrupt purge won't do much if you and your team play your cards right. People who get mad at others for cleansing are getting mad at the wrong things.
---
For me even though I‚Äôm not great with her it‚Äôs. Huntress because I love the lullaby xD, and survivor is Bill because c‚Äômon...left for dead!
---
I believe people just don't wanna be stunned.
---
High ranks killers don't ever respect them and more likely just to swing through it.
---
But then again high ranks sometimes just throw down the pallets depending on the killer
---
Whats respecting the pallet?
---
And more time into the game generally means they are better players.  I took a break from the game long enough to get triple rank reset so I speak from experience when I say there‚Äôs a drastic difference in skill level between ranks
---
be careful tho, too much counterplay could be a issue too but it looks fine for the most part.    
---
also looks like you have a lot of creativity so i'm looking forward and hoping the devs notices your rework ideia
---
A couple weeks ago years old
---
I main Ghostface as killer because I quite enjoy just sneaking up on folks and catching them off guard. Using Nightshroud for to throw them off in loops is pretty cool too.
---
As for survivor I main Ace for the dad energy.
---
I‚Äôd love to see this chapter, as I loved the game and mr X terrified the shits out of me. Just a few comments.      
---
        
---
- Brute force sounds fucking incredible and I‚Äôd love it. However it would be useless on maps like rotten fields and shelter woods sadly. Maybe it allows him to just demolish a vault/window Locations instead of random walls. Otherwise there would be some busted af tactics on maps like the complex.         
---
         
---
- Evolve would be painful to face. The killer is rewarded for failing to secure his objective? It‚Äôs why people hate NOED. Maybe it‚Äôs another form of progression (idk). Generators would make endgame extremely hard on survivors. Imagine blood warden, NOED, remember me and fire up with him. Busted af.         
---
           
---
- persistence is meh, bloodlust can be good but there‚Äôs more to work with than it just being quicker.        
---
          
---
- Same for killing machine, idk bit too basic to be useful or interesting. The odd one of these work but it‚Äôs not enough to justify a perk slot.       
---
- I like the idea of gone give it to ya, could be tweaked but the gem punishment is fantastic for when survivors get cocky and risk being hit to complete a gen. It‚Äôs like a guaranteed haunting grounds to an extent. Imagine that on a mid teleporting Freddy with technician (the billy perk 
---
right?).      
---
- mixing herbs is too complicated, maybe reduce the variety in herbs and combos. Otherwise I like it cuz it gives survivors a new possible objective.      
---
- grease monkey is fucking genius. I Love it. Best thing suggested on this post. If anyone from BHVR takes anything from this please let it be this perk. I love it. And it‚Äôs not even real yet.            
---
- Tough as nails is alright. Idk if it should be an exhaustion perk, but yeh could see it working.           
---
- Rookie cop also really interests me, it‚Äôs not broken but the amount of new mind-game potential is hilarious and smart. Imagine rolling from one tree to the next mid loop and losing the killer. Defo a exhaustion perk tbh. Love it.       
---
- I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the hand spray, Mrs kits already exist and so does healing normally. I get it, but I find perks that have multiple functions in a game to heal work better and are usually also less broken, like the Nancy totem locker heal perk (you know what I mean). This is basically a free insta heal. AH HELL NO.         
---
- Handgun. Could be interesting, probably broken, but really doesn‚Äôt fit into the theme of dbd. The survivors don‚Äôt have weapons for a reason. + this sounds more like an item than a perk. Survivors don‚Äôt physically fight the killer, with the small exception of DS. A gun is cool but nah. Would be overused and remove any ‚Äòhorror‚Äô from this game         
---
As I said I live the chapter idea. And notably brute force, grease monkey and rookie cop all sound like fun, fair and interesting powers/ perk ideas. The rest is either too much of too basic. Either way I rate this. Man I just wanna set off a smoke bomb and roll on the scene now, while the big lad comes pile driving through an infinite loop window
---
Remember, any killer is good in the right hands!
---
weird flex but ok
---
Thank you for that
---
Yes it does. Because you said "no killer." I was a killer who did it.
---
Lol. Played this game for over two years before I noticed and it was like getting hit in the face
---
Yes! Why is that a fucking thing right after running out of the basement!
---
I thought it was kinda strange too. I mean people literally get put on meat hooks, eaten alive, cut to pieces, sawn in half, and stabbed to death but we should avoid saying goddamn it?
---
Teaching: If a survivor is running you around too long, break away and find someone else, map pressure is more important than letting 3 gens go before your first hook.
---
Playing: *lens flare* **I can catch em**
---
Honestly, that sounds like a them problem
---
Legion and Nea üòÅ I really enjoy the cosmetics and perks they both have
---
Hopefully bbq or infectious fright gets in the shrine soon
---
Honestly, NoEd sounds like a shitty killer problem. I'm a red rank survivor and killer and I can admit that NoEd is bull shit.
---
I absolutely agree. just like every killer in the game you NEED to adjust your playstyle to succeed. that doesn't mean spending the entire trial injured, it just means learning how to juke properly.
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
I main Huntress because i can‚Äôt do many things without listening to music. Plus throwing a damn good hatchet is fun.
---
DIO Feng
---
I was playing last night and it‚Äôs seems the peak times at the moment are 12-1am (possibly later but that‚Äôs when I played). I played 5 matches in a row as killer with no wait time before I went to sleep.
---
David and Freddy
---
üîµüî¥üîµüî¥THAT WAS AN ILLEGAL DS YOU ARE UNDER ARRESTüî¥üîµüî¥üîµ
---
A few weeks ago. Really made finding them a lot easier.
---
10/10
---
I rarely DC no matter what the killer is but give me a minimum of 10 seconds to get my bearings.
---
This makes me want a krampus killer so much more.
---
Aye. I was on my wife's account. BHVR sort of has me by the balls lol. I've got the game on PC, PS4, and Switch. And on PS4 I've played plenty of time on both mine and my wife's account. Too bad all that progress can't be synced. But it's like, I think I have a tiny bit of a problem ;x.x
---
Ah that's interesting. Literally stand near the hook and while the hook animation is happening just shine it in their face?
---
Free it is.
---
So your problem is that you cannot speak to players mid lobby? As when the survivors load in?
---
I haven‚Äôt heard of any chat button bugs.
---
Man, this sub has an insane amount of legion mains lol.
---
Not bad, I enjoyed it. üòÅ keep it up
---
If this isn't allowed, let me know and I'll delete it. I don't use much Reddit at all!
---
David looks like Dick Gumshoe
---
Main killer is Legion, and currently playing through different survivors to level up to get their perks. My main survivor will be Feng, with Nea as my side bitch
---
Guess you couldn‚Äôt handle the Neutron style
---
I love seeing Legion cosplay. Have you cosplayed any other killers?
---
A few of the other killers don‚Äôt really have any lore-power correlation either. 
---
 
---
- Wraith: how does killing his boss give him a magic invisibility bell
---
- Nurse: she strangled people, why can she teleport
---
 - Spirit: she‚Äôs technically dead so naming her power ‚Äúhaunting‚Äù is relevant, but her lore doesn‚Äôt mention anything about phasing
---
I actually just found them recently thanks to YT suggesting their videos, he's the Korean animator, right? Part of me feels like they don't get as much traction just 'cause the first part of the titles of their videos are in Korean and that might drive people away that are just scrolling by or something.
---
For the trapper's keyboard
---
So do you shit blood or what ?
---
u/vredditdownloader :D I LOVED THIS
---
If the killer picks you up and shakes their camera left to right, do you stop struggling?
---
Genuinely asking because I had a dwight the other day I tried to give hatch to, but getting him to stop struggling was such a pain in my ass that I almost gave up.
---
When DLC comes out, the map tends to be a higher percentage of RNG. It would explain getting Yamoaka alot.
---
It's basically at the point though where the % has settled back to normal like the other maps have, and you're just having terrible RNG
---
Get rid of no ed on legion. Put on bamboozle you'll be surprised how well legion is when you adapt to using his power to get a guaranteed hit and force off most tiles
---
It's really not. You just have to know how to use your thumbs and position your camera beforehand
---
Awesome job! Got a few good laughs out of it.
---
I noticed a few weeks ago. I also noticed yesterday that the Hex icon is a hag trap, and Freddy makes snorring (sleeping) noises.
---
Spring burst is my favorite exhaustion perk rn ngl
---
Dude this is awsome and i watched with a smile on my face! Nice lyrics and it seems you put a lot of work in the video, i enjoyed the last "one" that changed each time. Good job :)
---
Leaked wraith hook charm.
---
You know she‚Äôs hungry for the totem. She‚Äôs ready
---
I think you mean making a decently running game
---
fuckin that right there.
---
Are add ons glitched? I don‚Äôt see much of a difference between my med kits but I can still used styptics and needles
---
I wouldn't be surprised if, lore-wise, the Survivors started out trying to fight back, discovered quickly that it was impossible, and decided the best use of their time and energy was simply to run away from Killers and take part in the trials as required.
---
I play xbox and get instant rooms for survivor(level 19). But my killer at levelv16 takes at least 10 minutes.
---
At least those killer‚Äôs powers all feel unique to them. Spirit‚Äôs phasing is hers. Nurse has the last breath or whatever, she phases. Bing Bong Boy‚Äôs Bell. It all feels like *their* power. 
---
Legion, on the other hand, feels like their power could be applied to literally any other killer. What‚Äôs to stop Freddy or Billy from just running around and forcing people to mend? Absolutely nothing. On the contrast, it would make no sense if Frank or Julie could suddenly turn invisible or started teleporting everywhere.
---
Every killer‚Äôs power genuinely feels unique. I‚Äôd argue that Nurse and Wraith, in the real world, obviously wouldn‚Äôt teleport or turn invisible, but their powers (granted by The Entity) still at least relate to their story. (I think, not positive on Wraith, but definitely Nurse). On the contrast, Legion‚Äôs power does not feel unique, could apply to anyone, and has absolutely nothing to do with their story.
---
Fuck off
---
I main doctor because he was the first killer I really had synergy with and performed well with, even if he‚Äôs considered low to mid-tier.  For survivor I started with Meg, but honestly I‚Äôm probably going to main Dwight since he looks closest to me.
---
Aiming isn't bad at all, as long as you have thumbs and a working brain you can use them just as good as anyone on PC.
---
Why does everybody think that there's some hidden secret to using a flashlight?
---
See you in hot, seriously anything thats cute and related to dbd gets upvoted.
---
*lady ;).
---
Look, I play survivor too. If I find they have noed on, I play smarter/more cautious, or I go look for it before a rescue. 
---
It's a fuckin' perk intentionally put in the game. If you have an issue with it, take it up with Bhvr instead of telling killers you want them to be easier on you.
---
i love ghostface bc i think hes neat  :3,I love his lore and gameplay a lot tbh! its so rewarding scaring survivors when you pop outta nowhere... as for survivor mains I love Laurie and Yui! laurie bc shes a badass (and i love the halloween movies)and Yui bc her backstory rly resonated with me plus shes also a badass and her cosmetics rock too! üòä
---
Clown and dwight. Clown because  I like bis power even if its mostly trash. And i just like dwight.
---
I finally got a few different maps after a ridiculously long streak on the other two. 
---
I had a follow up question: with this new DLC the devs added the new intro cutscene/campfire setting/and main menu song. Have they done this before and if so how long did it typically last? I'm already growing tired of the new song haha.
---
Breh 1v1 me civ V. Ill smoke you as Brazil with a fat culture victory.
---
What they are labeled as: (left to right) Nurse, Shape, Legion
---
I know this is just an idea, but you gotta take two steps back and realize this will ruin the game in so many ways. Many people will run it, a ton of those people will not do any gens at all and instead try to go for the save, highly-organized SWF group will abuse the living crap out of this, and it enforces a gamestyle that the dev's are trying to push away from [your points get deducted if you farm someone as they'll go back on the hook right away, as an example of the counter-measurements to farming]
---
CUJO CHAPTER OR WE RIOT
---
(lmao yeah no we ain't getting uncle Steve to grant BHVR rights to his stuff anytime soon...)
---
Well in any case best of luck with your future cosplays.
---
This has been my best keep-it-from-happening option as 
---
well
---
Awesome man, thanks for the detailed response :) Sounds like quite solid builds!
---
Let me mention my own favourites without ruin and see what you think:
---
Trapper: Corrupt intervention, Devour hope, STBFL, NOED
---
Wraith: Nurses calling, Pop, Thrilling Tremors, sloppy butcher
---
Billy: Bitter murmur, BBQ and chilli, Pop, infectious fright
---
Nurse; Whispers, thrilling tremors, pop, corrupt intervention
---
Huntress: Corrupt intervention, nurses calling, BBQ and chilli, discordance
---
Myers: Monitor and abuse, infectious fright, corrupt intervention, Whispers
---
Hag: Monitor and abuse, corrupt intervention, make your choice, STBFL
---
Doctor: Corrupt intervention, haunted grounds, overcharge, NOED
---
Leatherface: Play with your food, nemesis, pop, discordance
---
Freddy: Pop, surge, surveillance, corrupt intervention
---
Piggy: Corrupt intervention, Whispers, Thrilling tremors, pop
---
Clown: Corrupt intervention, STBFL, Thrilling tremors, Pop 
---
Spirit: Thrilling tremors, pop, sloppy butcher, thanatophobia
---
Plague: corrupt intervention, thanatophobia, play with your food, Whispers
---
Ghostface: Nurses calling, sloppy butcher, Discordance, pop
---
Demo: Corrupt intervention, thrilling tremors, pop, make your choice
---
Legion: Thanatophobia, corrupt intervention, pop, Whispers
---
Oni: Corrupt intervention, Whispers, pop, sloppy butcher
---
What gives you the impression that I am angry? as far as you're logic goes it makes no sense. you struggle because the killer letting you live is not guarantied yet it's because you struggle that the killer kills you. would it not make more sense to not struggle in the event they let you live rather than struggle and ruin any potential mercy the killer may have on you.
---
Isn't the spirits power based off Japanese horror movies? See them far away from you, then they are right next to you?
---
I was playing on the new map as legion for the first time today and i got spooked twice because I can't see anything
---
A few times were the exact same of chase music randomly starting while rotating gens
---
The last was when I was trying to move and I was like what am i stuck on and it was am immersed Claudette

Oh man, I‚Äôve been checking this community for a while, never knew yall are overly sensitive to Tbagging. I remember in Battlefield 4, me and my friend got Tbagged by two team mates and it started a 2 v 2 Tbag war, all we did throughout the session was look for these 2 players specifically and Tbag each other, it was a lot of fun with no words ever exchanged, I believe they even got the last Tbag. I never got mad at it or took it seriously in any game, I guess I‚Äôve taken that for granted.
---
I think you‚Äôre severely overestimating the ability of joysticks, it‚Äôs a well known fact that they are just not as accurate as KBM. It‚Äôs definitely possible to get blinds but it‚Äôs not nearly as accurate or quick as pc
---
You like to play short killers too?
---
Third panel is giving me DBD Gone Wild vibes :o
---
\*cough\* go fuck yourself \*cough\*
---
Get the petition
---
Edgy teenagers like it because they wanna self insert is the only reason I can imagine.
---
wait to be fair, bipedal killers would require changes in the engine, so like, they kinda get a by on that one
---
am just... a small creachure...
---
yea...your right. I guess let's just hope for a little more of a stern punishment for continuous dcs. If you disconnect in dota once you get a 5 minute ban. twice low priority matchmaking. Dota is quite a bit longer in terms of match time but I'm still hoping for some tougher punishment for DC
---
No charge add-ons work for any items right now.
---
Rip the batteries I used then
---
Amanda, because The Pig is honestly an absolute blast to play. Plus, when you get an RBT kill it's a satisfying feeling since this is so rare
---
I mean yeah but a mouse is way easier to do such precise aiming versus a controller in general
---
Happy Cake Day
---
A few times crows have really helped me out in finding stealthy survivors. God bless you annoying feathered bastards
---
We want emotes
---
Thank you. :)
---
Dude the dev's should hire you for your ideas alone lol
---
Ruin needs to be reworked imo. It's annoying that it's such a necessary perk. If you dont run it, survivors have the game done in 5 minutes. If you do run it and nobody finds it, you're borderline guaranteed kills. I just wish they would adjust generator repair speeds so we didnt have killers having to default to certain perks. Same shit can be said about BBQ. They're not perks that add anything interesting to the game
---
As a pretty meh killer, I don't even notice the crows.  I know I should be using them, but it just...doesn't seem that helpful.  I'm probably just bad though...
---
For me it‚Äôs between billy and spirit (billy when I want to play normally and drift like a chad and spirit when I get bullied in billy games not out gamered but bullied) I good at both but there are times when I can‚Äôt do anything against gen speed  and awith billy at times I love because of amazing curves I make . I like huntress but she feels really slow and I play Freddy when I just wanna pip and nothing else . All in all I play all killers when in a good mood and want to try something different (at times I get stabbed in the back and get gen rushed ) but the ones I mentioned are what I usually play
---
I tried picking up a survivor as trapper earlier and I guess he freed himself as I was grabbing or something and got yote into the sky. Like I could‚Äôve landed on the second level of the jungle gym on backwater swamp. Confusion ensued.
---
Those steps he used to take
---
I know, I know, Survs are all basically reskins of eachother. That said, I main Jeff cause he looks like PS1 Hagrid, the beautiful bastard. I main Kate cause there was a veritable flood of Megs and Neas, but now Im gonna switch to Yui.
---
I main Freddy and Huntress. Freddy because the Nightmare franchise is my favorite of the Big 5. Huntress cause she has an actual fucking bear skull on her head. Eat your damn heart out DiCaprio.
---
Clowns power slows survivors and makes chases easier. He also has addons that change his power, making coubterplay difficult.
---
Doctors power deletes stealth and can end a chase quickly if used well. He also has amazing tracking.
---
Legion can get the first hit, then he has no tools to get the second.
---
Stall does nothing if you cant catch anyone at a decent speed, and he cant track nearly as well as most of the cast
---
So a Stab Wounds Study add-on rework.
---
Return the slab killer,
---
Courage the cowardly dog survivor
---
1. Legions map
---
2. Yamaoka
---
3. Swamps
---
Back In the day playing quake III Arena my cat would just sit on the keyboard like what u gonna do now.
---
A way to look at it is that certain perks aren‚Äôt not strong enough, it‚Äôs that perks like Ruin and BBQ are too good that it‚Äôs not the best idea to not take them unless you‚Äôre confident enough. The detection value of BBQ is too valuable but it does have a couple of counters. Ruin is too RNG based and it needs to be replaced with a new base game mechanic for survivors to deal with that extends the match‚Äôs duration.
---
If you have spirit then I'd get neither and instead just save your shards for a better perk but if not I'd say you could get rancor since Meg is a free character so using shards on adrenaline would he a waste imo
---
Fellow Oinks, unite for battle!!
---
Killer: Ghostface. Having a terror radius always felt weird and I wanted to be able to scare people. The other stealth killers felt awkward and cumbersome with their various downsides to their powers. When GF came out I pretty much immediately fell for him as my main, but I still rotate quite a bit (especially when I don't feel like spending my good addons)
---
Survivor: Kate. First survivor I got good perks on after spreading my points to get a bunch of teachables just because I had a lucky bloodweb on her. Eventually unlocked all the perks and now it feels pointless to play anyone else.
---
I think thats only there because of Kill Your Friends. People switching between killer spectator and survivor means that there need to be extra positions to put people when there are too many on this side.
---
So like the biggest problem is if everyone is broken and you cleanse, the rest of your team is one shot and the plague now has the best range weapon in the game. Youre gunna get your team wiped.
---
I like pointing at legion to fuck off so I can mend and continue working on a gen.
---
Decisive strike
---
Pig because *sneaky*, though Trapper is fun too
---
Meg because um...honestly no idea.  Triple prestiged her, but I don't use any of her perks.  I actually use mostly David King perks.  No Mither, Dead Hard, Iron Will, Urban Evasion.
---
I guess every new generation needs to learn to "not feed the trolls" again.
---
Any feedback for toxic players is good feedback for them. They want a reaction out of you and if they get a reaction, they will try to escalate and get you to react even more. 
---
If they manage to get you to message them, even better.
---
It is a sad reality that there are enough bad people ~~on the internet~~ that limiting ones interaction with people you don't know is a good idea. Almost nothing of value is gained from interacting with them.
---
I might throw out a gg every once in a while, but unless something truly exceptional happened in a round, I will leave the results screen without saying a word. And I found my game experience to be better for it.
---
The number of times where I had a close round, maybe killing 2 or even 3 survivors, but having to fight tooth and nails for it and then chasing the last suvivor(s) out of the exit gates or through the hatch, only to get told how bad of a player, how shitty of a person or how whorish and cancer ridden my mother is have taught me that it is just not worth it.
---
Is this sad ? Quite a bit so, but my enjoyment of the game has skyrocketed and my stress level flatlined.
---
That would be cool.
---
Watch Saw, Detective Tapp is a lot worse in close quarters than you‚Äôd think. He gets his throat slit in one confrontation and loses a wrestling match to a man half his size in another.
---
Or a 1,000 copies
---
Inner Strength is easily one of the best perks after Oni‚Äôs release. It kills his tracking and slows his power somewhat. I can‚Äôt count how many time an Oni will hit me then abandon chase just for me to heal like 15 seconds after
---
Also spine chill I‚Äôd agree is high S tier. If it isn‚Äôt Oni, stealth killers are likely what you see in Red Ranks and is even useful against Freddy and Spirit
---
Did they shrink his stride?
---
This.
---
Honestly the detection of BBQ doesnt feel as unfair to me as the point gain does
---
His strut was *sexy*
---
Until people take spine chill.
---
People will DC against anything. Oh you smacked me once time to DC or oh I got a map I didn't want DC. Honestly if they get a excuse to DC they will
---
So lore wise do all ‚Äúlegionaries‚Äù hunt together or are they separated like in-game?
---
When someone runs you for 4 gens and you finally catch them... But they have decisive strike.
---
I use balance since I have a knack for attracting killers and having them not wanting to go after anyone else but me until I'm hooked or dead so balance helps me extend chases
---
Tapp also looks a lot younger in game than he does in Saw. I kinda assumed the DBD interpretation of Tapp *was* younger than Danny Glover‚Äôs version of the character.
---
Even then, you could swap out Tapp for Jake, Ace or even Quentin. Any of the guys, really, would logically get the jump on a Legion member.
---
Right, that would make way more sense, but that's not what the fluff said.
---
Same here. Me and my friend both brought party streamers. I then proceeded to get hooked after the killer spawned on me. And after I got unhooked I instantly was green mori‚Äôd
---
Did... did you read the breakdown? Clown's slowdown is barely existent and does nothing to stop vaults, and Doctor's power does nothing against experienced people and only deletes stealth early on since madness 2 and 3 take long to build up from the static field. He is superior to Clown though
---
ofc a plague main would want us to cleanse
---
next thing you know the cat is gonna nibble a little too hard and you'll have to rename it "sparky." Gives shock therapy a whole new meaning
---
I‚Äôd love to see bill pull Pig off a window vault and then beat her up likes he‚Äôs a grade school bully.
---
Werewolf
---
I'm not a plague main. I'm a billy/trapper main
---
You red rank on PlayStation? You must be playing against my squad. Thanks for the bloodpoints :)
---
Done üòÇüòÇ
---
Wait, I used Billy. But I only started the game days ago and have been a Doctor Main.
---
The game is M rated. Not the comic. I'm pretty sure there are R rated movies that make kid's toys, like deadpool. What if there was a funko pop of deadpool? The toy itself doesn't have to be M rated...Plus bleeping stuff out is more fun UwU
---
Demo and Hag have the cutest relationship!
---
My biggest frustration is when going against a good swf i get a really good chase in and actually mind game a dude to get them down and in my excited state of mind i dont fully face the wall and get blinded by the guy off screen losing my reward for my hard work. I silently rage so hard.
---
Alright, I'll put in my two cents. Mindbreaker was never meant to be the best perk. First way, eh, doesn't really change much, and honestly, have you ever seen anyone run Mindbreaker? It's only really good on stealth. Second way, is an absolute no. In the event that you actually get to use mindbreaker, the 3 seconds is enough. That gives killers a big window. Third buff would screw literally any team with ruin, and is incredibly strong. Too strong.
---
Cruel Limits. First change, Absolutely not. So, first thing would be blocking everything. This makes almost anybody running any type of loop suffer for it. Second. Honestly, it might be decent, but it's still strong. Given the fact a generator takes 90 seconds, you're getting half a gen's time as a perk, five times. That's good, but Cruel Limits is a situational perk, for stopping survivors committing to gens. Third change, no. This makes any killer with an instadown incredibly strong when paired with this perk, and hearing a gen. 30 seconds is also a long time.
---
Surge. Believe it or not, this perk is actually good as is. First change you propose, that's 10% of the progress gone, which is maybe at max, 10 seconds. Coupled with Surveillance, it's way too good of a combo. The second change, basically negates around 5 seconds worth of work, globally. That's a huge problem, due to it being able to couple with surveillance. Also, the reason it doesn't work with any attack is due to certain abilities being powerful, and coupled with a perk that blows up gens in a decent range whenever you can instadown someone, those two do not mix well.
---
Ah yes. Almost every rank reset for me lmao
---
Clown can capitalize on his power quite well, especially with addons. He has really good add ons.
---
Doctor can still ignore stealth, track well, and force pallet drops.
---
Legions addons with few exceptions make it easier to injure everyone, which he still cant do much after 
---
They also just gutted his perk synergy
---
Not on console. Cannibal ends chases better than both since that's what his power is meant to do, and he performs surprisingly decent and is not abysmal on console. An insta-down is an insta-down, not to be taken lightly. I established Doctor as superior to Clown, but Legion is better than Doctor since his tracking is more consistent and applies damage AND bypasses loops thanks to the vaulting.
---
what a cutie
---
They will be found and its Bill and his smoking addictions fault
---
Censoring is more fun ;)
---
Thank you so much!
---
Ok this is cool but how in the world are you in games with multiple killers?
---
Thanks! I'm not even in red ranks and getting infinite looped, pallet flashed and gen rushed is not fun at all......!
---
That's why I love Hag &lt;3 One of the few killers who can beat god pallet, other being Spirit, Nurse, Huntress and Doctor.
---
I fucking hate solo que.
---
The same could be done to ghost face
---
I‚Äôm scared by that ugly pink ass mouse
---
If you're entitled to use any tactic to win then you're entitled to be able to counter any tactics. How the hell do devs want survivors to have fun when killers like to tunnel when they fail to pressure the game and 3 gens get popped in the first minute because they respect pallets to much.
---
;)
---
It gets worse. Just know you arent alone. Is there a Killers Anonymous group?
---
Survivor: David. Originally it used to be Laurie but that was because I got the DLC for free. Then I went to David because We're Gonna Live Forever = more BP, but eventually I just stuck with him because he's a somewhat similar background with myself in terms of rugby and basically being an alcoholic and I love how his lore/perks basically go from someone who couldn't give a shit about anyone to is more than willing to get the shit beat out of him if it means someone survives plus the fact David lives for the thrill of it. 
---
Killer: I got nothin', not much of a Killer main, I guess Billy or Michael?
---
I'm dying
---
Legion's add-ons also help his tracking and power efficiency. Legion also has more consistent and precise tracking than Doctor thanks to killer instinct, the Clown's only really amazing add-ons are the Bleach (should be base kit imo) and Solvent Jug, but the rest don't really change effectiveness as much as they exist for convenience and easier application. Also the "perk synergy" with Legion only hurt Sloppy and Franklin's, Dying Light and Thanatophobia still work amazingly and actually work well with the pin and blade add-ons
---
Dude your stuff is amazing!
---
Keep it up!
---
We'll Make It is a staple perk on my build. Recently I put Deliverance too for that ''unhook yourself 50 times achievement''. 
---
I haven't been able to do use the healing perk since then, due to to the amount of tunnelers and campers. No joke.
---
Trapper's a hefty dude too
---
oh I'm so glad you appreciated that &gt;w&lt; It's little subtleties like the lighting, his pupil size, and lil sweat drops I put on the mask &lt;3
---
Not feeling it üòî
---
Crossplay could help though as I am a killer main on xbox. Xbox has this game for FREE on the gamepass. So a free game getting into a crossplay pool can help.
---
Legion doesn't have fun mechanics to play against.
---
I'm just maining both when I level up my Yui.
---
But tbh I like playing all survivors, I just don't have perks on any of them besides Feng, Claudette and Kate ;\_\_\_;
---
legion has no way of downing survivors, no mindgames, no reliable way if stopping loops, mediocre map pressure and mending does nothing but waste 12 seconds of time. Also he has terrible perk synergy.
---
Lore kinda just blurs into gameplay balance at some point, so I don't think you need to look too hard into this. I mean, you have things like the simple act of putting up a pallet being literally a special skill and whatnot.
---
By the way, you forgot Bill being a combat veteran. He took on multiple zombies hand to hand before.
---
Why do I imagine the entity sending ghost face as a substitute, then he snaps a pic of Frank and runs away selling said photo to everyone else
---
Where's the 3rd stun?
---
I saw your original bruh lol
---
I only played against the plague once so far, but like why is it a bad idea to cleanse without no mither?
---
Love the roast in the corner üëå
---
do the original ones unlock again for chrsitmas cause I was on a break during that time so will skins like Dwight‚Äôs Christmas sweater reopen
---
I am on console. Also my best is probably hag
---
Neither do Clown and Doctor, all of these killers are m1. Legion doesn't stop loops, he runs you down and bypasses them. Clown has zero map pressure at all, Doctor's is minor, mending is more effective than Snapping Out of It.
---
On xbox its 20
---
Tiffany and Chucky.
---
&gt;Also does anyone know how the matchmaking work? Because it is upsetting that I am a rank 14 killer and then i get freaking rank 7-8 survivors all the time,and they acting up aswell which honestly wtf you expect from there you know I am not suprised but still I have no idea how the matchmaking works and if its normal But I sure do that I play this game roughly 2years now,and before this never happened,so I am confused a bit about it
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;*We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019
---
](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
Does this stack with bloodlust?
---
To be fair, barring Frank, the Pig and maybe Ghostface (who still look dangerous as fuck) a lot of the killers don't look like people you COULD fight against, I doubt you'd want to try get their attention by arming yourself and attacking. Most of them are monsters, or fucking huge, or packing super brutal weapons.
---
Ok
---
I don‚Äôt know about selling points but I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to them selling boosters. Can be time based (24,48,72 hours, 1 week, ect) or amount of games played. Could even get a better deal during the holidays and sell them at a discount so that more people buy them. Idk. The idea is nice but it would probably take away from the game too much since everyone would have every perk and wouldn‚Äôt have anything to work towards after a short while.  That‚Äôd cause them to be stressed about releasing more perks quicker (adding more bugs quicker)
---
Wasnt trying to sound rude, honestly it sucks on steam. You play survivor and your team sucks, you play killer and they get the gens done in no time.
---
Lerys, Hawkins, and the game. The game gives you LOTS of jump scare spots
---
I just finished that one. Use a green flashlight with green bulb and green battery. Use apathy and wait. You don't have to save them to get the blind. I tried to make sure I could only see the killers head and torso on my right shoulder and it worked.
---
I really don't see the point in emotes, all it's going to do is bring more toxicity in the game. Some people are already complaining about survivors t-bagging behind pallets or at exit gates etc... now imagine if the survivors can just dance in front of you to troll you, what's the point ?
---
And then you downvoted or an idea, you‚Äôre a joke, jeez.
---
Simple answer no. People would probably be mad even if you were a no perk, no add on Spirit.
---
Mad or not respect is gained for that David
---
Cause she can then go to the cleansing site and then be able to vomit damaging blood vomit
---
My idea is that everything in his terror radius is black and white and at any point he can see through the eyes of survivors (he'll know if there nearby if there vision is in black and white). Movement ability that removes his ability to attack but makes him nigh impossible to detect and increases his movement speed.
---
Way to go! Still haven‚Äôt gotten there myself. Then again, I only play once a week!
---
Im not interesed in the Gameplay of Last Year, but i love the idea of every killer being of a different kind of horror. They made human killers, now in chapter 1 they explored the arachnophobia/animal horror and i really want to see what they come with next. The developers said they'll try to make every chapter killer a different horro style. I really want to see some kind of bodyhorror
---
I need a scramble on all fours when climbing up stairs animation
---
Get decisive Strike
---
‚ÄúObi Wan has taught you well‚Äù
---
That certainly gets your attention
---
Awesome chase 
---
though your perk selection got me wildin. how dare you run lithe and dead hard together and ya nerfed boy self care!! üò®üò±üò±
---
Anything special to install it?
---
Tbh i'd unironically want that. Cujo, Jaws and andaconda
---
Awww nooo. He'll be fine there's no way that will happen.
---
Woah calm down
---
Doeant everyone play in low ranks when they reset? So shouldnt most players at this point into he game life cycle have more subjective experience? I think he may just be under rated.
---
But finger guns... :(
---
r/StabbyGang
---
I think it does, I might be wrong but I think last time I was in this situation the haste effect did appear for a bit, making me think that he wiggled faster too.
---
We all this, and I do this once every week at least
---
Yeah gizzmo would either sit on the keyboard/mouse pad or the shoulders  just to let me know he is there lol
---
If every killer in dbd stopped tunneling killers would still have to deal with ds
---
And then you vow to never use Dead Hard again because you use it and still get hit, but the next game it's the same all over again.
---
I recognize that. I joked too.
---
Legions own perk Discordance is a good information tool. It let's you know when 2 or more people are working on the same generator, so you can use your power to get more hits.
---
Thanatophobia is good to help stall for a bit. All injured, dying, or hooked survivors will give a penalty to gen repair and healing speed of all survivors.
---
Surge let's you regress gens when downing a survivor since your power can't down people. Surge regresses all genes in a radius around you when you down a survivor with a basic attack.
---
Pop goes the weasel will let you regress a gen by 25% after hooking someone. You have a minute to use it after the hook.
---
Ruin is obviously always a good perk. Makes it so survivors who hit good skill checks regress the gen by 5% and greats don't add any progress.
---
I'm all ears let's you see a survivors aura forn6 seconds whenever they fast/medium vault, or rush out of a locker. Can be helpful for ending chases fast with the info it gives.
---
Nurses calling can let you see survivors healing within 24 meters if you. Can be useful if someone is trying to sneak a heal near you. Especially if they want to heal to stop Thanatophobia.
---
The Slash Street boys need to reunite!!!
---
They are also given supernatural endurance, they don't get tired, they don't slow down...
---
I played against a Bubba today that said, "Camping is fun for me".  
---
"If I have two survivors in the basement, camping is okay."  
---
I play both survivor and killer. \*sigh\*
---
Story of my life!
---
and i'll make a post like omg dead hard is still broken yet use it in every single build üò≠üò≠
---
i mean, it would take the devs a lot of time to do those things when they've got a bunch of other things to worry about, like new cosmetics for the rift, and the next chapter, and bug fixes. devs said emotes would ruin the immersion of the game, too. customizable moris i'm actually down for, but i feel like that's a LOT of animation to do. there's a reason they don't do non-bipedal killers but i can't remember why.
---
if i get downvoted for this, just remember: don't shoot the messenger. :)
---
I got insta queue on killer and about 5-10 min on survivor (ps4). Killers dodging lobbies is a mayor issue tho... They see 4 people loading in at the same time and they're out and i usually play solo.
---
https://pics.me.me/youre-gonna-need-a-bigger-bait-61066356.png
---
Aw, best friends
---
For real, you won't regret it.
---
I'll do one respect if I suspect a survivor greeds to mindgame them
---
I've gotten some survivors who were so greedy and didn't throw pallets down. One was a Claudette who got hit and downed at 2 different pallets because I didn't respect them. Next time I chased her with Make Your Choice on her and she still didn't throw it and got downed again lol.
---
I KNEW IT NEA IS A KILLER
---
I enjoy cutting people off in the treatment center but it's a gamble. There is a chance that I could be wrong about the layout or if my survivor knows im trying to cut them off can just go the other direction. Its deffinetly something to be done sparingly against smart survivors.
---
"new generation"? Not hardly, I've been on the internet since AOL's inception. (not wonderful times, obviously.)
---
I just tried it on Hawkins and it went swimmingly, by the end of the game they only had 2 gens done, I'm just waiting for the one match where I get a shit match though.
---
Idk why but I just get so thirsty when I fave plague üòä
---
And if every survivor stopped using DS survivors will still be tunneled off hook and get sent back to the main lobby in less then a minute.
---
Im not saying gen rushing is bad but it does exist. A 4 man SWF running good commodious and literally waiting for the the final second to save the hooked can get all 5 gens done in literally 3 minutes.
---
Why would I prestige a character if i don't want the cosmetics ?
---
I thought so, thank you!
---
Really just bragging rights
---
*Miss me with that gay shit*
---
You're done with all these retarded voodoo tentacle hentai worshipping headasses. Once per match channel all your will to live into a mighty throw that launches the killer into orbit for 10/20/30 seconds. 
---
"I'm sick and tired of these motherfucking killers in this motherfucking place!" - unkown
---
My favorite is when I get a lone message that simply says ‚Äúreported.‚Äù
---
Well, the lesson here is to save your $10 and not waste it on the next "battle pass" because you have to play the game like it's your life to complete it, or spend money to do it :)
---
Lol I knew you were going to say that. You‚Äôre so focused on the tunneling that you completely ignore the point of what I said
---
That for sure until my son took the reins of that spot. Now he's the pro and I'm the padawan.
---
I think he‚Äôs in the same boat as The Nurse where he‚Äôs obviously more difficult  to play because of controller and system limitations but the killers themselves aren‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù on console, just harder to learn/play.
---
So if you‚Äôre willing to go through the process of learning him, he‚Äôs definitely worth it. He‚Äôs certainly one of the most fun killers to date in my opinion.
---
Yea it's a stupid point that can be said by both sides. Ppl will always tunnel and ppl will always use DS.
---
‚ÄúGoodlooking‚Äù like David...
---
LMAO bro that‚Äôs insane I just versed an entire team with decisive strike, dead hard, and borrowed time I was laughing the whole time my karma I guess
---
nah
---
Watch the beam. It will start getting smaller if it's in the right spot. Aim for the chin. It also takes 2 seconds to work.
---
Why do so many survivors spin in a circle after dropping a pallet, is it just a new way of being toxic or does it serve a purpose?
---
I can‚Äôt believe I forgot about Ruin that shall be the 4th perk.
---
This is actually accurate gameplay for most of the killers.
---
I don't think you need to post this but I achknowledge you're having a struggling and if the dbd subreddit is your plea for help than so be it.
---
Godspeed to you. I don't recommend posting something like this on this reddit ever again, like other people have said r/offmychest or r/depression are good places to find support. This is a subreddit about dbd, try to keep it that way :)
---
I wish you pure love man though and I hope whatever you're going through will ease and you can find some relaxation from whatever it seems you have been dealing with.
---
I've been there before, it's never easy eh
---
Either Lunge for tracking and sping along with them or just wait while they do start spinning and then hit them after they finish
---
I'm a killer main and never really used a flash light until these challenges but that worked for me. I give props now to people that blind me. It's hard.
---
looks like a binding of issac mob
---
You know maybe a little touch up her and there and Hag just might be bae.
---
With the Battle Mullet cosmetic atleast
---
Not on PC.
---
New killer perk, Hazmat suit
---
You avoid the Cooties at all costs if a survivor stuns you that survivor is put in a **Containment chamber** and won't get out until they are cleared of the **Cooties** status effect.
---
Cleanse where there are completed generators.
---
Flash
---
Light
---
Then we'd have people whining about "tryhards" in the casual mode instead of whining about them in the current ranked-only mode.
---
Scream film?
---
Yes they are making another one which is kind of pog
---
Yes, and they have to share the same bathroom with survivors.
---
Finally, a place to confess I'm a legion main.
---
Scream AND Nightmare? This is the best timeline
---
Kinds reminds me of Don't Starve
---
New game: Don't Get Hooked
---
Oh shit I just checked. How did I miss that news? Another Scream would be so good.
---
It's almost like ruin isn't a perk anymore lol it's a way of life
---
I feel so dumb when that happens.  But I look around and there's literally no scratch marks.
---
*Laughs in deliverance*
---
I'd trade dying light for sloppy butcher
---
Btw, I love how the "earn 50,000 bp" isn't effected by addons or perks. Nice.
---
Yup my fav horror film
---
Yes
---
Ooh I'm waiting for mine to be delivered this week and I too bought it cause it was pink &lt;3
---
New Survivor: Uncorrupted Evan MacMillan
---
You‚Äôre curious why we love to tbag goodbye at the exit gates? Because since release we‚Äôve been nerfed to hell and back so when we get that 4man escape we‚Äôre gonna give you the tbag exit &lt;3
---
it's like you didnt even read my post
---
Wow okay lol
---
Yeah. that kind of monetization can go to fucking hell along with the battlepass.
---
It's more or less as a way to react better and being in more vantage places or just antsy in general. Killers can choose to not kick the pallet in order to zone the Survivor out.
---
Hah i like to have options.. incase there isn‚Äôt a window near by i can go to Plan B! And yeah man self care is doo doo but playing with randoms is a struggle so i need to rely on myself to heal
---
It's more than likely a stress button
---
It's in my top 3 for sure.
---
Didnt Jakes animation was different
---
Dawg id rather 0k every game if the survivors are outplaying me at every pallet than 4k every game if it means i have to play hit and run to the god loop 40 times.
---
Huntress doesnt have a mini gun with a huge hitbox.
---
Forever freddy already exists you ain't new
---
There's a fair few toxic players in most online gaming communities to know my knowledge, each being shitty in their own ways. I think some of the challenges are still a bit too difficult like hooking two people during the end game collapse. That requires too many things to line up in the right way if you're playing fair. Which challenge were you doing?
---
I mean, the screaming Koala's make is pretty demon-like: [https://youtu.be/x8oLu7znwQ0?t=51](https://youtu.be/x8oLu7znwQ0?t=51)
---
Rift levels completed just from earned by leveling rift shards- still missing some of the challenges- condolences lol
---
I. Am. Dying. üòÇüòÇ
---
That worked! Thank you!
---
DS
---
r/UnexpectedJoJo
---
I was talking about the money I spent on the actual game, not the battle pass.
---
Very cool! Is it handmade?
---
How do you crawl so fast? is that part of urban evasion?

I know its not exactly what youre asking about, but for the contradictions with Dead Hard specifically, its the best exhaustion perk *when it works*. Its the most controllable one and if you use it right, you can extend a chase a lot longer than it should be going.
---
Issue is that it just doesnt work a lot of the time. It can also be predicted by the killer, but you shouldnt really be using it during those times, it should be used for gaining safe distance to a pallet/window.
---
Bill already has his, it‚Äôs free for everyone right now
---
I‚Äôd smash
---
Or dead hard, that would‚Äôve helped there too
---
They‚Äôve always been in the store, that‚Äôs the only way to get them
---
Hell, being completely inept is probably more dangerous to you, because you can't predict stupid and can be caught off-guard by it.
---
by 'low rank' on this sub do people mean low number or low skill?
---
Like is the lowest rank 20 or 1 in this context?
---
r/stabbygang
---
Ngl, I'm jealous of your keyboard.
---
Really? Do you buy them in the shirts category in any survivor? And can you get them with iridescent shards?
---
Im level 35 with Laurie so theres no point in getting ds at this point lmao
---
TINY LEGS
---
Thank you ‚ù§
---
Lmaoooo I didnt even downvote your shit. Idc
---
Waste of a perk. Survivors will prematurely leave after the perk goes live.
---
I gathered that, your reply still doesn't make any sense though.
---
I wasn't trying to offend you I'm just tired of being misunderstood
---
There is always the dev recommended solution of "Go play Civ 6."
---
All I want are skins for m2 weapons like hatchets, chainsaws, and now Oni‚Äôs Kanabo
---
Forgot all about that honestly.
---
I used to main doctor, but now I main ghost face. I just happened to try ghost face, and I couldn't get enough of it. I rarely have matches where I don't kill everyone as ghost face. The few times I play survivor, I play as Bill because I got slugged about 20 times in a row and I invest little to no bloodpoints in survivors.
---
Probably just another bug, just restart your game and they should show up.
---
Same
---
Wow, you must be fun at parties.
---
I main Jake since he was my first survivor and I prestige 3'd him first. Besides Jake I like playing Quentin, Steve since he's my favourite character in Stranger Things since 2016 and I play Laurie too because I originally bought this game for the Halloween franchise which I grew up watching.
---
I don't play killer too much but I used to main Michael as killer but now I play more Ghostface because although I don't love the Scream franchise more than Halloween, Ghostface is my second favourite slasher of all time and I find him more enjoyable to play than Michael.
---
Dev: "Spirit needs an actual vaulting animation, just teleporting from one side to the other isn't cutting it."
---
Animator: "I'm just gonna make her use the basic vault used by all Medium Killers, even though her character skeleton is unique and won't fit that animation; thus making her look like a chimpanzee as she, a spooky magical ghost, pulls herself over a window like she's some edgy teenager or a tiny lady in a pig mask."
---
Dev: "Sounds great! The community will love it!"
---
Cause it's obviously one of the Toxic Blendettes. When I play Blendette, I make my intentions known and just PLAY lol. Being toxic makes me feel icky.
---
Oh boy, I remember original freddy... that fucking dimn ligjtning, and the fog, like someone always brought a pink fog offering by default.
---
Idk if this is you or not but one thing I always see against Bubba is people try to stealth around him when he's close by. I'm not saying this is specifically you but for real if you see him moving towards your gen don't try to mind game or be stealthy just GTFO and elongate the chase. Makes things way harder for him than the chance of him finding you hiding and can chainsaw you
---
Meg is a free to play character, so I‚Äôd say get Rancor unless you‚Äôre willing to shell out the money for the Spirit DLC later. You can just level Meg up over time to eventually unlock Adrenaline.
---
Alternatively, I play survivor probably about 80% of the time, so I usually prioritize getting survivor perks over killer perks, since I know I‚Äôll use them more often. Get whichever one will be more useful to you in the long run. Just something to consider!
---
I spent 2000 iri shards thinking the 150,000 BP would count for the 200,000 challenge, mistakes were made
---
That would be the point. He would get other powerful things, but have a harder time as the game goes on. (Like he did in the movie.)
---
Meg is my bitch.
---
Yup. A dev posted on the official forums at for Sony to change trophies they pretty much have to be impossible to get. While the huntress one has been changed on other platforms it hasn't been changed on PS4 because its not impossible to get.
---
Keep in mind that you don't need to save the survivor by blinding the killer, so you can wait until a survivor gets downed, as soon as the killer picks them up, run in front of the killer and go for the blind. Sprint Burst can help you get into position.
---
Rank 8. Not the best but I try as best as I can. I try to focus on more of being a good teammate and helping others rather than rank, but I really like having my main objective as ranking up for the game as a whole.
---
I downvoted you just because of this comment of yours...
---
It has a bug where it can fail?
---
Too bad it wont effect iridiscent head from my beautiful huntress
---
The biggest scare of my life was as Plague on Springfield. I was dicking around and patrolling a house for no particular reason; there was zero indication anyone was there, it just had the popular upstairs gen. I heard a distant noise of a failed gen check so I detour through the room with a pallet intending to drop through the hole. Then an Iron Will Jake fucking drops the pallet on me he had been crouched beside, apparently terrified the whole time due to my heartbeat. I had LITERALLY no idea he was there and just this horrible SLAM of the pallet made me jump and drop my mouse as he ran away. It took me 10 seconds to kick the pallet.
---
After the game he said he thought I had Whispers so was waiting to drop it on me the whole time and had no idea why I just stood there as he ran away.
---
One, nurse is OP.
---
Two huntress doesn't "ignore pallets and windows" not even close. Three, if you can't loop, you can't complain about better players using a strat you don't understand.
---
That means pipping 3 times. 
---
I imagine that aside from those people who bought the game and never played (1 of my friends can't run it on his PC but has it anyway) there are also people who are discouraged from playing after a game or two.
---
Add in long Killer queues at Rank20 and smurfs this will lead to significant player drop off.
---
When someone starts the game and gets put against a rank 20 killer with a build like Ruin, BBQ, NOED and Franklin's they may think the game is bs. Same with R20 killers facing red rank survivors.
---
Ye thats pretty good and same lol i run breakout &amp; mettle of man to protect team mates
---
One thing I don't like about Deliverance Users is the fact that they unhook themselves not at the last second of going into the struggle stage but literally 5 seconds after the killer leaves making them a target of tunneling.
---
Please, wait a little bit longer to apply equal pressure between a generator being worked on by another survivor and and killer's distance to you.
---
Because they think they're good when they get all of the gens done. If one door is open and nobody leaves, then they're the typical survivor who waits just to tbag the killer. Just go to the opposite corner of the map or camp the door that isnt unlocked and read the cries because they push their luck thinking they can open another door
---
I do it to keep my fingers busy and to see how killer reacts you also leave tons of scratchs marks and in those rare really rare ocurrences can confuse the killer and buy you a tiny bit more time since the killers look down when breaking the pallet.
---
They doing the 5 survivor and 2 killer glitch
---
Nah it got played out like a month after it started
---
What rank are you
---
6*
---
Mood
---
All the killers have Entity powers, nerds. A survivor could never beat them in a fight much less kill them. This comic is just for laughs.
---
bill would shoot him
---
The most toxic I get is wearing bright colored cosmetics and over-flashlight blinding after I pallet stun them for the 20th time
---
Multi-Killer trials starring the Legion.
---
I got lucky with this one, I thought for sure the Nea would leave because I hit the Claudette but nope, sat there and gave me just enough time to get her. They probs also thought I‚Äôd be really nice since someone DCed but not if you‚Äôre gonna play like that.
---
True, let's hope he gets something good to work with
---
Youre not wrong
---
This is gunna be a dumb question and pretty straightforward but, how do you go about getting animated photos of these based off original images? Is there a kind of technique and photo adjuster you use to tweak the locations of the photo? Is it frame by frame tweaking or is it more tweening? More curious on the technical sides of all this id really like to look into this and try it myself but dont know where to start.
---
I teabag at exit gates if it was a facecamper and we all or three of us escaped. I give toxicity to those who are toxic
---
Wow.. you want anti-totem perk specially ruin that would last 5 secs instead of 20 seconds and anti regression perk.. and a map and key function on top of that.. have you any idea how hard it is to be a killer against swfs on red rank? Wow just wow..
---
Im confused what your complaining about here?...
---
So hes not letting you do gens?.....  which is what a killer is supposed to do...
---
You never fired up a game and fucked with it once and said "not for me"? I did that for League of Legends. 
---
DBD is a pretty niche game with a LOT of knowledge to actually understand what you're doing.
---
Ignore them and dont go near the opened doors, dont give those typical survivors the satisfaction...
---
Like 1 in 15 games, maybe?
---
I usually just get Trapper, Wraith, Spirit, Billy and ESPECIALLY Onis nowadays.
---
Same. Except I usually bag at the gates just to give them the extra BP for a hit
---
You good Feng bad
---
1 tunneling stabby teen* 
---
Fixed that for ya
---
I mean if you're rank 5 or 6 you're a purple rank and can face anyone from rank 1-11 quite often.
---
Also just because someone is red rank doesn't mean they have 2K+ hours or godlike skills at the game.
---
Thanks! yeah the grinding has been unrelenting
---
i'm missing 
---
Taking One For The Team &lt; This one is the mount everest of grind
---
and
---
Bodyguard which is easier imho
---
Nurse is most definitely not overpowered. best killer in the game? sure I guess, but not OP. nurse is the same situation, if she can't see the survivor, she can't reliably blink to the survivor.
---
Yes huntress "ignores" pallets and windows, she throws hatchets over/through them. any decent huntress will try to hit you from range when you make an unsafe vault, which is the same thing that plague does.
---
i'm not complaining about better players, i'm complaining about killer games as plague where nobody cleanses then i just one shot them throughout the game. i'm also complaining about teams where 1 or 2 don't cleanse but the other 2 do, because they get other people infected and then die super early as a result
---
Just play with killers you're bad with to derank
---
BHVR, stop all productions and make this a top priority.
---
I want a killer that can break walls and make entrance to where he sees fit(obviously would be limited)  or a killer that could use the crows to spot survivors and maybe cause different effects
---
makes sense but iirc unless you stay in one corner the whole match just buy doing at least one gen and dying you pip at rank 20
---
just wanted to show love for you guys
---
Sure does!
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is... people complain regardless of what happens lol
---
I main huntress if he takes over I will eat the developers and you both
---
Reindeer are *not* better than Steve
---
Main Ghostface because he's monstrous in the right hands. I always know when I've scared the living shit out of a Survivor with him; and that's exactly what I want.
---
I main Quentin because just like him, I'm very tired and relying on other people's perks.
---
They match you with players within 6 ranks of your current rank. Is it fair? No, but they have to expand match making because there are so few killers at red ranks so they are dumping the excess red rank survivors on to poor fucking new killers that are just barely out of greens. Welcome to thunder dome brother!
---
I want a killer that can transform into a survivor and do things like that but while a survivor he is as slow as them. He would be able to stab them as a survivor and transform back anytime.
---
P3 claudette on that map = gg no bbq stack for me
---
So he can ask you out on a candlelit date, of course
---
Any MacMillan, Autohaven, and Coldwind Farm map can suck a dick.
---
Yui also. And they're all coming Wednesday
---
Yeah you are right it takes too much time and knowledge of the ingame stuff to really enjoy it
---
Probably a week or two into getting the game. Played KWYF and was reading through the perks.
---
 Was annoyed when Bond wasnt on page 1.
---
I'm sorry I love Feng but Yui keeps grasping my attention :(
---
Why are the tally marks purple too
---
Oh damn really? I knew I forgot someone after typing it.
---
Funny how my post didn't infer that whatsoever huh? Almost like I never encouraged that because it's just as BS and unfair when they do it, like gameplay breaking bugs suck in general!
---
Low key would be a pretty cool idea if they started adding killers before they were corrupted as survivors. Think of the lore value
---
I really wish they would overhaul the tutorial. Unless people watch streamers or YT vids to get an idea it's almost become an impenetrable nightmare.
---
Gen rushing and tunneling are the same thing change my mind. 
---
Two sides of the same coin.
---
Steve's jawline tho...
---
I usually avoid the doors even if only two escape. Two can still be mean lol. This door just happened to not quite be open yet when I was going to it
---
My team all cleanse we take it to the far side of the map and make her walk. By the time she gets it we pop a gen lay low and boom its gone
---
I feel a kinship with that cat
---
Not to mention he could also easily take down pig and maybe hag who don't seem physically menacing like other killers
---
This is why DS needs changed. Puts the Killer in a lose-lose situation no matter what.
---
I emote and do a bounce, I‚Äôm always nervous they‚Äôll read it wrong lol. Also I managed to get the video! So if you‚Äôre interested I‚Äôll be posting it soon
---
The first time I played killer, I ran into a survivor and screamed my head off. lolol
---
Literally noed
---
I feel like it‚Äôs a daily thing at this point, explaining how utterly useless this would be for a killer, and yet people keep suggesting it anyways
---
Survivor is Jeff since the Legion DLC as I love Distortion. Used to play Bill as I came over from L4D2.
---
Killer I play almost exclusively Hag. I love her Mori, animations, traps and cosmetics. She's just amazing for me and I know that my traps terrify people.
---
E t h a n E v a s i o n
---
He has come to face. You for title of stronger killer
---
Sorry my bad
---
Didnt you read the Survivor Rulebook for Killers? It's obviously rule #12948369476, subsection 254, Paragraph 3.
---
One Killer left me alone the entire match until I was opening the exit, then downed me so my teammates could farm two more hooks. The other match the Killer dropped the other survivor (who was on third hook) and searched around until they found me so the other person could get two unhooks off me.
---
It was infuriating.
---
Never. But when i play as him i often get my ass whooped even though i feel i am doing well, getting short chases and pressuring with portals. Idk im used to red rank gen speeds but whenever i through on demo the games just over after like three 20 sec chases and i dont know how.
---
I was thinking that you could put on curtain traps that would confine them to only being able to do certain things. Reverse bear trap you can only do generators and unhook. Venus Fly Trap you can heal, but as soon as you get off of a hook it activates not when a generator is completed. Bear arms can be the trap at the end of the game. The only thing the survivor can do is undo the trap. They can‚Äôt use items and the only way they can escape is by getting it off before it goes off and open an exit gate and go. Or wait for hatch to open. Or have somebody else open the gate.
---
It's like, kinda implied that she might be giving what The Observer mentions about her. However, the Devs said during the AMA that she isn't, so either it's not really there or it's some other disability that is similar. (Hell, maybe it's another accidental mistake by the devs who forgot one part of the lore again.)
---
If you say so.
---
This is actually how the legion was advertised in his trailer lol but it didn‚Äôt turn out to be true of course lol,
---
Except the Ghostface in DBD isn‚Äôt related to the movies, so if there is a new outfit, DBD wouldn‚Äôt get it :/
---
I feel like a lot of people used to main legion but lost interest after his big rework but now that he‚Äôs been nerfed again, they‚Äôve gone back to him to either protect him or prove he‚Äôs not garbage tier.
---
Weird Question but... any chance you might do commissions at all? I am loving your artstyle and would absolutely kill for an avatar from you. (Or Mori, whatever works for you.)
---
Another good YouTuber not yet mentioned is PainReliever. His videos are to the point and categorized in a helpful way.
---
*HOW DARE YOU!*
---
I would love Resident Evil chapter. Especially with a Tyrant, Nemesis, or Mr.X for killers. Nemesis especially, tenticles etc
---
Hell, they could easily just add skins based on what skin you get for the primary weapon
---
I'm rank 11 and have been going up against nothing but fucking red ranks for the last two nights. Something must have happened with the recent patch because I'm seeing lots of posts here and on the forum about people complaining of the same thing.

A lot of Killers who farm try to make sure everyone gets maximum points, so they‚Äôll gather all four survivors in a group and take turns hooking everyone so each survivor gets two unhooks. Then the Killer will usually follow people around to pallets and gens to get destruction points before letting everyone exit.
---
In this particular instance I can‚Äôt get hooked (otherwise I lose the challenge), so I don‚Äôt want to be a part of the hook party.
---
Honestly the only killer I‚Äôd want to full on fight with would probably be Nurse but that‚Äôs just bc you could definitely knock her around with some shit. 
---
But then again idk, she has enough endurance to literally pierce holes in the Spirit world and forcefully travel through them which the devs have said is excruciatingly painful for her.
---
Rin Yamaoka as a survivor, and she has to face what she's become
---
One night I was having fun playing with my swf group and the at some point they went offline because of irl obligations, but I stayed on to play one game and I went solo. I did 3 gens by myself, unhooked my entire team at least once and fully healed them with we'll make it. Endgame comes around and I get downed and hooked, all 3 already had the gate opened when I was getting hooked and all 3 did not bother to walk away from the exit gate to check if they could save me (imo they could have) and they all left without attempting to save and hell even one of them tbagged from the distance right before they left. Made me realize that solo queue can be shit sometimes.
---
You forgot Yui too
---
There is. They added a Christmas tree
---
*BACK OFF BOOMER!*
---
Hell, Oney is useless on it. It baffles me that they release a map with a new killer that you can't even use his power on.
---
ah damn
---
Yeah, I do. This eye for an eye mentality just begets more and more toxicity &amp; game busting and gets no one nowhere in regards to making this game better.
---
Link to the Scream trailer? The only one I saw was a fake one using clips from season 3 of MTV‚Äôs Scream tv show
---
I know there‚Äôs a Christmas tree I‚Äôm talking about a dbd logo ornament for one
---
Only reason I forgot Yui is because I didn't expect her to get a Christmas sweater and I forgot about Jane because I just hate her character
---
Wait. You still drop blood orbs with no mither? Or is this when you get downed while having no mither? because if you get downed and drop blood orbs then thats fine because everyone bleeds when they are downed or hooked
---
Glad it's not just me who thought that. I like the design but you're right in that it's way too Survivor friendly. Every Killer match I've had I feel a sense of dread when it ends up on that map although it's good for Scratched Mirror Myers and Trap Daddy with darkened bear traps. I learned the latter the hard way but surprisingly escaped. You could have half the map dotted with Blendettes and the Killer would notice. Urban Evasion Blendettes with Iron Will on that map would just be broken.
---
There is no trailer it was announced that it was being produced lol
---
Ah yes how could I forgot about the rule book! Silly me
---
I understand and I know it's a common issue, but it's also a common issue on any other game which doesn't allow you to change your contrast/brightness settings. I told you my experience with it and just wanted to make sure you knew that not everyone has the issue. Up to you what you do with the information. I'm learning nothing new by seeing that you're not alone in that problem.
---
isn't that what unbreakable is for? (Lol tho seriously solo queue is the worst experience)
---
Depends on how much you love the franchise.  Much more casual friendly at the cost of more intricate systems from previous games.
---
113 Clips in total to be accurate ü§≠
---
Blendette, blendette, where art thou? üòÇ
---
Oh. Well it‚Äôd be cool, but the ones we have now already clip thru the characters arms and clothes. I can only imagine how strange the ornament would look clipping thru everything lol
---
Yea I get ya but yea it‚Äôs real and confirmed seems like the success of Halloween 2018 really made the old timers feel safe to give another go apparently for N.O.E.S (lol) is going to have original Freddy back in the role at least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard which would be amazing
---
I mean, Jane has a perk that literally has her charge the killer to stun them when she's in a locker.
---
"You're on top of a hay im reporting you for cheating"
---
-Toxic Nea
---
I do the same thing as the guy did in this clip, but its always at the start of the trial and it turns out to be hex: haunted ground and I unknowingly time it perfectly so that my teammate gets hit after it goes off. Sure enough they dc or suicide on hook and leave a raving review on my steam profile.
---
I am sorry about rough times ur going thru. I don't feel like I need an apology, I understand. 
---
Also, for what it's worth, I'm a good listener if you need a stranger to vent to üòäüíñ bc I am weird and really do care, even if I don't know you.
---
I'm having a similar problem on the Survivor side of things because I reached rank 4, edging on rank 3, recently and keep running into red rank Spirits. I had three to four red rank Spirits in a row yesterday. I can spike in difficulty across most Killers I play against now but it's just a game of steamrolling when it's a Spirit. I'm not a great Killer (decent depending on my concentration and mood) so I don't get to the ranks you're talking about and I also actively try to avoid ranking up because I've felt the pain of toxic red rank Survivors. I've had a few of them before, somehow.
---
It was a problem with my connection lol I apologize
---
Neat! How‚Äôd you do that?
---
Matchmaking is fine...
---
Dropped ur /s
---
With the exception of perhaps Inner Strength all of the perks from the Stranger Things chapter are weak or otherwise worthless. For example why use Mindbreaker over Blood Echo?
---
I think the biggest problem is that they keep adding these insane conditional requirements, restrictions or cooldowns that snuff out the potential of what could be good or even meta perks. I mean just look at Second Wind. You have to fulfill absurd requirements just to **possibly** heal yourself when you could legitimately run any other form of healing perk.
---
Surge is only a measly 8% apparently, and it doesn't work with all of the perks that require you to damage a generator. Now perhaps being able to apply PGTW to multiple gens would be way too strong, but at least let us overcharge multiple gens as a fun combo...
---
Sorry for kind of ranting but it just really sucks seeing interesting concepts be ruined each chapter.
---
Ah, I see your are a man of quality as well
---
So long as the swing is downward, it's charged enough to be a 1-shot. Which you can charge pretty quickly.
---
I don't blame survivors for doing objective. Still call it genres tho.
---
That‚Äôll be super exciting honestly. It‚Äôll be nice to watch a NOES movie with the original Freddy, but with upgraded graphics and special effects. I just hope they make the movie scarier than the new Halloween movie haha. I mean the new Halloween was great, but I feel like I was more scared of being scared than I was actually scared by the movie.
---
"Galaxy of a brain" üòÇüòÇ
---
I hate it when they kill themselves when I'm just about to get to the save üôÑ
---
Oh sorry i'll pop that in right after i get done getting whipped by red rank swfs.
---
No. No it shouldnt be what its based around. Literally how many times do people have to say that a killer pretending to be a survivor is bad power
---
That sounds annoying, hopefully they‚Äôll make some changes to it soon. I saw some posts about a chest that spawns behind a statue, and is unobtainable.. that looks fun.. I just want to get the map specific achievement, and then I‚Äôll probably never want to play there again haha.
---
yea for sure it is a exciting time for horror fans the start of a new decade :D
---
Cant david just like... steal the knife. Or grab a hachet from a locker
---
I didn't say it didn't. I said "as if". Your comment makes next to no sense.

Which is why I run Sloppy, even though it really doesn't add much benefit besides Mangled.

That's cause he thinks you tasty. You a snacc to him.
---
That is the best thing you could have said
---
Devs released them to everyone to stop scalpers.
---
And why do so many people stop playing killer before they hit red ranks?
---
Ah ha......
---
I found David and Laurie to be the hardest survivor adepts. David obvs for No Either, but with Laurie it's very easy to misuse Object of Obsession if you're not used to it.
---
They gave all purchaseable exclusives to everyone to stop sellers from making alot of money( Aces Big hat was 1000$)
---
That's kinda one of the things I thought about it. You get this rare offering, that the most common one requires to either 4k a survivor group, or leave someone slugged or entity forbid get devour hope to it's full stack and you get only one animation to kill a survivor with, some of which are just bland. I wanna see a mori that actually says something about the trapper and wraith, not just have them be the exact same ones, were trapper just steps on their ass to stop them from crawling and wraith drags them back to make them different.
---
Literally this game right here
---
I dont get whats stopping her from standing still for 3 seconds and charging without being in a locker
---
Oh I could see something like that, where shoves it in, breaks it then the survivors fall to the ground, choking on a mix of the tonics gas and the bottles glass shards.
---
+/-6. So a rank 11 can go up against an Average Rank 5 survivor group.
---
So a Rank 1, Rank 1, Rank 1, and a Rank 19 would average out to about Rank 5 - Give or take the Weighting of those rank 1s.. Maybe they're Rank 2s instead.
---
Matchmaking working as intended!
---
Never gonna happen, game is killer sided
---
I just want a Classic Freddy cosmetic
---
Respect for staying in queue during this lol
---
The upside down right now is better cause it isn‚Äôt on fire and kills your lungs, being here is sad rn
---
No idea ü§î wonder what it could be ü§î
---
I take back everything i said devs go fuck yourselves you fucking idiots
---
He was just some entertainment while I was waiting :)
---
Child molester reincarnate?
---
You act like red rank 4 are some pinnacle super humans. In reality you lot are potatoes more than purple ranks. All escaping isn't some impossible achievement. Get over yourself.
---
Hell, if they get the rights to it, they could make ones based off of the kills the licensed killershave in their movies, like the one where Michael stabs the nurse in the back with a scalpel and lifts her up with it.
---
I mean, yeah it sucks, but when you get to the post lobby with the highest score, iridescent emblems, more BP, and pips, who‚Äôs really winning here? Like in these situations, post lobby gives me a lot of validation whereas if my teammate comes back for me or not doesn‚Äôt.
---
I honestly think it‚Äôs dependent on how skilled/confident you are at running The Plague around and surviving in general.
---
I main Plague and I‚Äôve had teams who were all fully infected and I couldn‚Äôt down once just because they were really good at running me around, and I‚Äôve had teams who I 4K‚Äôed in under 10 minutes because they didn‚Äôt know how to loop but refused to heal themselves
---
TLDR: If you‚Äôre confident with looping and running the killer around, don‚Äôt cleanse. If you aren‚Äôt as good, definitely cleanse
---
those look good
---
because changing maps takes a lot of time. It's not just moving some stuff around, it's making sure all textures, lighting look good, all geometry has proper hitboxes and many other things like this
---
Changing Balanced Landing took them 10 minutes. Move the stagger recovery from outside to inside the "if" statement, add a line about removing fall sound, adjust the description, test if it works.
---
This is what basically amused me. A perk should not give away your location in this case even for a specific Killer at least if they have add-ones or perks that increase this type of effect. And overall, if you're gonna be against four no mither players then let's say it shouldn't give blood orbs at all. Because it is one hit only and besides you gain 50% meter gauge filled when hitting Survivors.
---
Just because it‚Äôs the easy way to do things doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the right way to do things
---
Aw man, I was the huntress earlier ): I suggest changing your name to your challenge. That's what helped me get mine done with nicer killers.
---
&gt; My point is that 3 red ranks and a purple rank facing down a green rank killer is not at all fair. That is the EXACT issue people had before BHVR "fixed" matchmaking.
---
Well, this is how they fixed. Now up to 6 ranks apart is intended.
---
That's understandable. But that is if the Killer brought one, otherwise it doesn't have to be that difficult to manage knowing what to do.
---
Hey you put some respect on bubble‚Äôs name
---
The Game and Hawkins were still the most deadly maps.
---
The Game is straight up unplayable as survivor now
---
Haha!
---
but that's what they went with
---
I might have to for some of the harder ones. I did finally get the Spine Chill challenge done, but holy hell was it annoying.
---
I‚Äôm usually up for farming, but this was the one night where I was sweating buckets not to get hooked. :(
---
Im red ranks, i prefer lithe over dead hard
---
Glad someone in this community doesn't use their talents to make smutt.
---
Bruh i know the feeling if i dont check it its insta cleansed if i do check it no one is there and i just led someone there so its a no win situation usually for me haha.
---
[I broke down all the "BL" maps once](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e2p62q/rip_no0b3/f8xkulo?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
I play plague a lot and I'm still amazed at how often people cleanse against her. Almost every match people cleanse.
---
Pop and sloppy butcher on huntress...
---
When will they learn
---
Ok seriously who is going to actually fall for this bait
---
He has one! I will never win what's the point.
---
Yes, 2 many honkeys.
---
Basically never lol which is a shame cuz he‚Äôs a fun killer to go up against.
---
If they start selling fortnite emotes im fucking done
---
 Watch OtzDarva and Tru3Talent on youtube and twitch. By far some of the best players and they explain everything they do so you understand why they do it.
---
The biggest problem with Lithe is that you waste it a lot. You can't doublevault, vault a loopable window, dance on a pallet, vault a window into drop down etc. without wasting it
---
It should work exactly the same as on PC since there is nothing different between the two platforms when it comes to window vaulting for killer.
---
are we in 2018?
---
That's not how you use it.
---
I was playing as Ghost Face and got revealed by a survivor in a little patch of grass in the corner of a wall. The killer instinct was flashing in the corner and I walked over the Claudette like 3 times before I actually noticed her. The chase music kept activating and I couldn't figure out what was going on. That Green Jacket grants her the Undetectable status apparently.
---
We have hag, doctor, Claudette, feng, Yui, Jane, adam, Frank (legion), plague, oni and spirit
---
Up yours would be a more fitting and emotive gesture
---
He was disliked because he told the truth
---
Im pretty sure he is way stronger and faster than a normal human!
---
You are brave having that glass of water on your computer desk!
---
They are, the mal is getting a rework, seems like it will comeput in mid chapter
---
Reeeeee
---
Oh thank you :D
---
Whispers is necessary as it allows you to check gens from a distance and also allows you to find a survivor quickly.
---
Iron Maiden is unnecessary as you can just reload before picking up/hooking.
---
(Note) I would presume that you'd use IM because you're reloading whilst chasing?
---
If so, That is very bad since Huntress is a 110 movement speed killer. You will never catch up.
---
if you hear corruption pop you should hide in the first place if you hear terror radius
---
That makes sense for when I searched it up how people were selling them for hundreads of dollar's thanks
---
I disagree. Legion‚Äôs power is pretty unique and feels completely different than the other killers‚Äô powers. Being able to sprint at mach 10, vault over pallets and stab multiple people within a few minutes is unique and I am glad they didn‚Äôt make Legion a ¬´¬†disguise killer¬†¬ª because not only it wouldn‚Äôt work but it‚Äôs also very stupid and boring.
---
Also, their lore fits their power. The entire idea of the Legion is that it‚Äôs a group of teenagers wanting to experience new sensations and escape their boring reality. A teenager is usually sporty and has a lot of energy so I can see why Legion is ¬´¬†the sprinter ¬ª of the killer pool. Their trailer was misleading yes, but I highly doubt Legion was made only for money. They put a lot of passion into his cosmetics and lore and while he‚Äôs not perfectly balanced he‚Äôs still fun to play.
---
Well, BL had too powerful of a passive in their eyes and the map is getting reworked, im guessing the rework will come out in mid chapter patch
---
Sounds to me you should just find a different game to play...
---
The map is getting fixed
---
Congrats! :D
---
Yeah I understood, I literally played like a bitch to get mine via urban evasion and crouching around the entire map
---
Oni be like:(Demonic screeching)
---
Yeah that is why fuck console mang
---
Give [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e8hv6y/start_cleansing_against_plague/) a look. It seems to be getting people from both sides
---
Mangled makes healing take longer, so it makes them leave more blood orbs in one place when trying to heal, which is kinda good enough
---
Lol, I was trying not to have to use Urban Evasion since people get salty if they feel you‚Äôre being too sneaky.
---
I wasn‚Äôt mad at you - you were trying to help us out, which I appreciate. I was mostly irritated since I had about 4 games tonight where I made it to the end only to get hooked at the last second. :(
---
Wait? Wasn‚Äôt frank 20 Years old or something?
---
Using feral frenzy to run away lol. Hilarious
---
def get the killer that interests you the most, perks can always come up in the shrine plus bbq isn't always needed. it's more about fun since this game is repetitive
---
It's no problem as helping people makes me happy, have a good day
---
Myers is better than Ghostface in every way
---
He hasn't knocked one over yet so I'm not worried. He is careful.
---
Thad‚Äôs why I use macros üò≥
---
I do enjoy this
---
That map alone convinces me I need to unlock BBQ
---
Bubba and Myers. Bubba is actually fun to play and Myers is a beast when played right.
---
If you want an interesting killer then going for Demogorgon is a good choice. His perks are all pretty poor but hopefully should get a buff in the future but other than that he is a fun killer with a relatively high skill gap.
---
Wouldnt bother picking up Myers if you have GF. Myers only has one decent perk (STBFL). His other 2 perks are mediocre with PWYF being good in a couple of killers like Bubba.
---
BBQ &amp; Chilli is a really nice perk to get if you want bloodpoints. I doubt it will appear on the shrine anytime soon as it barely ever because of its popularity. You could wait until christmas time when all the killers are on sale to purchase bubba. By then you should be able to buy him pretty cheaply since he is just a killer.
---
i promise you, this legacy will continue.
---
Tell that to console Oni lmfao
---
Literally every single game I play with plague, once one survivor cleanses, it's all over. I cant believe people still cleanse against her before Endgame. Even if you do cleanse, what's the difference between being healthy during corrupt purge and being injured? You die 2 seconds slower, as it takes no time at all to puke on you two times in a row. What's the alternative you ask? Never cleanse and get good 1:15 loop chases with every single chase because she can never reach you, unless you're not good.
---
I love Myers, but I gotta disagree. I hate being so slow as Myers, and sneaking around with ghostface gives you a huge advantage
---
Myers &gt; Ghostface
---
Don't buy original characters with Auric Cells, since you can buy them with Iridescent Shards.
---
Between Leatherface, Myers, and Demogorgon, I'd say Leatherface for BBQ (And his playstyle isn't bad. If you like M1, he's basically M1 with a charge attack chainsaw that'll one-hit) and Demogogon since you like that style.
---
I got the demogorgon and he's really fun to play. Even if I do suck at him
---
Decisive strike?
---
Genrushing is misused a lot...
---
The real genrushing is when at least 2 survivors bring commodious + 2 repair speed add-ons / purple + BNP, 30 charges and they refuse to unhook eachother just to get the gens done.
---
I still, tho, say I've got "rushed to oblivion" when the match ends early, but it's not blaming the survivors, it's my way of saying "I suck"
---
Yes. Figured the /s was obvious enough. Need to remember not everyone can read my thoughts.
---
Those of you who can... You know... Yeah. You know.
---
It takes 5 seconds for plague to hit you twice with corrupt purge, while you can loop a jungle gym for 15 seconds to a full minute before she downs you.
---
People already complain about ‚Äútoxic‚Äù actions like t bagging or pointing I fail to see what benefits emotes would bring
---
"Lunge" 
---
More like anytime I play the game or do anything even remotely risky. Do it all the time as killer, never much as survivor. Just goes to show how much more focused you are as killer.
---
If you‚Äôre on console you‚Äôre probably not seeing any Oni because he is barely playable
---
Bro is jake that dude from shingeki
---
Sinister Studios
---
If they added The thing, it could work like that. Transform into a survivor that's not nearby, and it's actions could slowly tear down generators and stuff. It would be cool to see
---
Grass so tall it makes you completely invisible
---
Any decent plague will keep that from happening, trust me.
---
I just started playing him today, he's really simple and fun
---
I hope they'll add the aged Myers mask
---
Dying light is really bad
---
More than anything Buckle Up being a base survivor ability would really just be a quality of life change. I doubt most people would even notice it.
---
So getting to find the killers hex totems for free, only downside is showing the killer your aura for 15 seconds?
---
Yeah, no. Any swf is gonna have one person run it every game
---
Yeah you‚Äôre in green ranks that‚Äôs going to happen
---
Damn thats cool! Can you do the same, but with leaked "Ugly sweaters" picture on r/leaksbydaylight?
---
damn your setup and nails are e v e r y t h i n g
---
The reverse of this is when you‚Äôre trying to do a gen on haddonfield but your character decides they wanna jump out the window next to it instead
---
People will DC against literally any killer &amp; some rando will find an excuse for why its justified or "understandable"
---
That would be awesome
---
You are a scumbag for that one.
---
He was hated because he told the truth
---
The looksi
---
Awesome! I'm planning on getting one as well, but with a wendigo skull underneath it and a mori hanging from the skull. Good thing it turned out well, seen a lot of dbd tattoos on Google that look awful.
---
theres a difference between asking someone to shut up and telling them to shut the fuck up buddy
---
Controlling Oni on console is sketch tldr
---
if they do that, you traded a perk slot for a lot of free gatekeeper score
---
Decisive Strike is a teachable Unique Laurie Strode Perk. It can be unlocked for all other Characters from Level 40 onwards
---
Using whatever is at hand, you stab at your aggressor in an ultimate attempt to escape.
---
After being unhooked or unhooking yourself, Decisive Strike will become active and usable for 40/50/60 seconds.
---
While Decisive Strike is active, when grabbed by the Killer, succeed a Skill Check to automatically escape the Killer's grasp and stun them for 5 seconds.
---
Okay, we can fix this easily... uhh... now huntress doesn't have to reload her hatchets!
---
I main Myers and my current build is BBQ, Ruin (or else you will get genrushed by the time you get to Tier 2), Discordance for gen control and to find survivors quickly, and for the fourth slot sometimes I switch perks, I like to use Infectious Fright because it saved so many matches for me or made them easier sometimes, or Save the best for last, to end chases quickly; a month ago I was using the combo Spirit Fury with that other Billy perk, but it used two slots so I wanted to change things a bit. Hope that helps.
---
well if you went down that fast you clearly don't belong in purple ranks
---
This stupid comment is what will get you downvoted just FYI since you obviously care so much about them
---
You are unfunny and your attempt to ruin the moment is a failure.
---
I wasn't trying to gate keep but they make it pretty clear that it's more than just animal instinct. That thing kills for fun, which is something animals *rarely* do, and is considered a morally evil thing even in the context of animals. see; a mother and daughter monkey pair who acted as a serial killing duo throughout africa 
---
 [https://www.livescience.com/1518-female-chimps-kill-infants.html](https://www.livescience.com/1518-female-chimps-kill-infants.html) 
---
You are correct that your interpretation is just as valid as mine, I'm not saying it's not, but it's credence as to why Demo doesn't really stand out to me as a truely realistic killer in terms of the lore.
---
Legion killed in the heat of the moment and it forever stained their souls. Demagorgon is just, a story book monster.
---
I do. Do you see what I'm writing?
---
If Switch has 100 Survivors and 20 Killers, and Xbox has 100 survivors and 20 killers, and PS4 has 100 survivors and 20 killers, and PC has 100 survivors and 20 killers... That's a 5:1 ratio each.
---
Then adding crossplay and combining them is 400 survivors and 20 killers. That's still a 5:1 ratio.
---
Where do you think there's a difference?
---
Yes, if there is a discrepancy between the platforms, then Crossplay helps make slower queue platforms have a faster queue --- At the expense of the other platforms having a slower queue. You wouldn't be helping the overall issue, you'd just be averaging out the wait-times **AND** causing concerns about latency, compatibility, as well as keyboard/mouse versus controller.
---
PLUS you'd have to get Nintendo, MS, and Sony on board, which is hell in and of itself. AND you'd need to code it all together, which is a special sort of hell in and of itself even more.
---
There's so many issues with getting crossplay initiated, let alone working, and all for what amounts to "Averaging out the wait times."
---
Add crossplay and you're no longer just waiting for Switch's Survivors to find a killer in line, you're now waiting for PC's, Xbox's, PS4's, **and** Switch's survivors to find a killer in line.
---
How is this a hard concept? You wouldn't be only gaining the other platform's Killers, you'd also be waiting for all those platform's survivors to also queue. You gain nothing.
---
Because Ironworks is a giant area location and only having one pallet and having the area be useless is unfair.
---
It's okay that you have to vault a window once or twice. It isn't an infinite, you'll catch them.
---
1. shit bait
---
2. if you are actually for real with this crap, piss off games are not meant to send any ethnic propaganda they exist to be played for fun and if you take it as some white privilege shit then the problem is in your head
---
At least we have Kingfield tho
---
only affects 3 people
---
only gets stacks when hooking affected people, so if one is hooked and one is being chased, affects one person
---
gets good values when affected people die
---
buffs the obsession
---
doesn't affect the obsession, making them the most dangerous target that you can't chase
---
values only seem good when ran with Thanatophobia
---
Effect dies if you happen to kill the obsession
---
so far so good. should I go on?
---
I oftentimes cannot see at all on other games in dark environments and I'm on a \~15 year old 720p tv which is incapable of actually running at 720 on my pc (for some reason). Everyone's experience is indeed different because of the things you mentioned.
---
Another game I play is Escape From Tarkov, and I can tell you on that game I absolutely cannot see a thing in the dark in situations where most others can see moderately well. It's not an overall setting in my case which lets me see decently on dbd, at least as far as I can tell. If that was the case then it's very confusing because dbd is almost the *only* game in which I can typically see fine in situations where some others report having issues.
---
In case it helps at all, I can tell you that most of my visual settings are default for a gtx 970 graphics card with basic nvidia settings and I have no HDR.
---
Can we get Freddy on switch..........please.
---
Bill doesn‚Äôt have guns and the fight would look just like the right between Jason and the black guy in Jason Takes Manhattan.
---
Ash has stupid luck but when he knows all odds are against him he kind of gives up and it shows you that in the show. 
---
Ash could handle the Evil Dead simply because his gadgets and he knows how. We don‚Äôt have Deadites so Ash is out of his area.
---
Dying Light works for me.
---
I feel comfortable around 2 gens left, lots of people can agree with this.
---
Sure it's not op, but none of them are.
---
bruh. this is in response to Nea being the real killer
---
MATCHMAKING
---
Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents.
---
We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works:
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible.
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players.
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule.
---
If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019
---
If they're looping the wall in question, they shouldn't break the chase. As long as you keep the chase on for 3 vaults it'll be blocked.
---
Awesome idea. What would his weapon be though?
---
I have a better idea. Remove hatchets from lockers, give her a limit of 20 hatchets. She starts with 5, 15 scattered around the map and whenever she throws one, she has to go and pick it up from the ground!
---
Nono.. Not saying it's not flawed. It's flawed as shit.
---
And it's a downward spiral sort of flawed.
---
Survivors at low ranks can't get matches because of a lack of killers.
---
BHVR expands the matchmaking, making mid-rank killers go up against low-rank survivors.
---
Mid-rank killers get frustrated at being stomped by low-rank survivors and give up being a killer - Either deranking on purpose, switching to survivor, or just quitting altogether.
---
Mid-rank killers quit the killer aspect, thereby creating a larger lack of killers.
---
Larger lack of killers makes more mismatched games as now Mid-rank survivors are having problems finding mid-ranked killers (who have quit), so they match mid-rank survivors with high-rank killers.
---
High-rank killers get frustrated and start doing what the mid-rank killers, and the low-rank killers before them, did -- Leave.
---
It's been a trend over the past two months. In September it was "It takes 5 minutes to get a game! This is so weird..." In October it was "Why is matchmaking taking 10 minutes? I watched a YouTube video and wasn't in a game by the end!" Now it's "My Switch went to sleep while waiting for a game! That's a 15 minute timer!!!"
---
You don't see patterns like that and not connect the dots...
---
Its a nightmare before christmas Haha
---
You have mini rainbow parrots that squawk in the early morning. You have spiky bite lizards. You have birds that will attempt to eat your eyeballs if you walk outside on a nice day. 
---
They are demons, sir. One of them screams, one makes you scream and one of them screams at you while making you scream.
---
But that doesn't make sense entirely, for example, DS. You literally *stab* the killer which not only means they are strong enough to fight back, but killers themselves can feel pain to some degree. Hell you assault them with pallets with enough force to stun them. I get that survivors aren't given weapons though but ever since I saw that one animation just made me curious.
---
his planet needed him
---
yea that would be so cool :&gt; Englund is best freddy
---
its a mask :D and it was quite expensive
---
I thought nea was the en***tit***y (Õ° Õ°¬∞ Õú „Å§ Õ°Õ°¬∞)
---
Killers are boosted by the entity to be unkillable
---
Last time a killer dc'ed on me, the only thing I did was walked a few feet and slow vaulted through a window and I somehow got 5600 points lol
---
Agree across the board with you, and well said. The Grease Monkey perk is very very creative as is the tactical roll perk (I would LOVE to run that with Adam's pebble toss perk, could you imagine?).
---
Most of these are really close to perks we already have. Also with Kindred being a thing why run a perk that only lets you see the killers aura? BTW they used to have offerings that adjusted map lighting but removed them so doubt they would bring it back as a hex.
---
The one about increasing killer speed after a successful down is original though so good on ya for that one.
---
The new killer is a massive spider
---
Very well put. I just wish the developers would realize this and do something about it. Not sure what exactly it is they need to do but you're right this is a downward spiral that's going to lead to longer queue times for survivors. If you figure you need 5 people for a match so you only need one killer for every four Survivor players. That's 20% of the player base. But long Survivor queues show that less than 20% play the other side of the game. And yes I'm one of those who is slowly becoming too frustrated to play killer anymore and while I somewhat enjoy Survivor, by itself it's not enough to keep me in the game.
---
So you decided to go out of your way and make a post to demonstrate how much you don't care?
---
Imagine if you cared.
---
Ok, this is interesting
---
Nice
---
I love it
---
Would have been even funnier had you included a super tall, noodly Legion removing the trap off his leg. (This is what happens when shorter killers step into a Trapper's trap).
---
What I'm saying is in a situation where they can't escape such being cornered; of course they'd all run if they could escape. I also understand that they have super strength seeing how a young women with a tiny frame can pick up survivors with ease, but that raises different questions when you have DS and pallets. In which survivors literally have enough strength to stun killers (I mean if they are so strong I could see trapper literally old it up with one hand as the survivor tries to drop it and slap them with his blade) and with DS literally ***STAB*** the killer with enough force for them to drop the survivor. Which means the killers are susceptible to pain.
---
Hey let the man smoke! It's Xmas after all!
---
Remember Me is a pretty terrible perk, 16 seconds of extra gate opening time is definitely not worth a full perk slot.
---
You used to be able to go to the support page and get your shards back (I got them back for Spirit) but they decided they won't do that anymore and I didn't get my shards back for Clown and Kate
---
Context or otherwise, you are an asshole.
---
There aren't enough killers on ps4 and too many survivors. That's why it takes forever, that and its trying to take the few killers and match them with their ranks. It sucks.
---
Using NOED lmao
---
So you dont care so much, you decided to post about it. Genious
---
I get the unkillable part, but even so. I could see someone picking up a 2x4 or something trying to stun the killer to buy more time is what I am getting at. And of course what *would* *happen lore wise*. Seeing most response is that the en***TIT***y would punish them.
---
I need to become a pizza dwight main
---
Noed on huntress. Yikes
---
And thus, a toxic Nea was born
---
if there was a way to inform survivors you're playing without the sound, there would be
---
ü§°
---
Even the killer waits are forever but, I get what your saying. Thanks for the feedback. üëå
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter who you are Getting hit with a pallet doesn‚Äôt feel good in general, that doesn‚Äôt mean they are easy to kill. 
---
2. They pickup anything to stab them with and they have to be able to pull it out. Texas Chainsaw Massacre has a good scene with a Decisive Strike reference. 
---
The killer essentially pulls out whatever they get stabbed with but it‚Äôs more of sharp quick injure pain which is why they are distracted and have to pull it out. 
---
Being susceptible to pain doesn‚Äôt mean you can be killed or be killed easily it just means you still have nerves that allow you to feel pain.
---
because they don't want to get hit with a piece of wood and get stopped for 2 seconds
---
also anyone else always get huge frame drop the moment you use it on console
---
New bug I just found. Killers can get stuck to Generators AND LOCKERS by interacting with them.
---
I guess we just can't look for survivors or kick generators....
---
BHVR, fix your broke ass spaghetti code.
---
Got reported for using franklin's demise
---
How scaary
---
Don‚Äôt be upset. I know y‚Äôall would do the same exact thing
---
Smh xd
---
I was expecting some ridiculous nerf, but this ones aren't totally out of the question.
---
Not particularly unless you‚Äôre on a very specific loop. Most loops with windows either have 2 windows or are very close to other loops with windows so it doesn‚Äôt really do much
---
Im lost too. He got a few upvotes so i think we might be in the wrong sub... ü§î
---
I dont blame him, when someone literally says ¬´i main¬ª and then the character i just stop reading cuz i dont really care about what they main, i just want their opinion on something
---
I like how it‚Äôs a mini Shrek with a throwing knife
---
Lol no, best build for legion rn: thanatophobia+ruin+bbq and blood echo
---
And if you are getting gen rush too hard change bbq for pgtw
---
I don't think moris should be changed. While it sucks getting mori'd, that's the game sometimes. And survivors don't need to survive every match.
---
But, that said, this is one of the more fair and balanced suggestions for moris that I've seen in a while.
---
LMAO that poor Legion
---
How it feels to play against 4 DS
---
Unless she crawled over like demo i dont see how else she could do it. I think the window phase was a legitimate option but apparently survivors found that too hard to deal with ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
---
A nice herbal blendette tea
---
See what she does to me, making me typo my OWN post
---
imo they only seem helpful when they begin circling campers who forget to time themselves
---
Typical signs of a neglecting pet owner lmao
---
Huntress in the right hands can be utilized well, ZubatLEL, Umbra, and ScottJund (I Think) are all great examples, but smart survivors as you will see in the high ranks will bait out hatchets, will force you to hit them so you have the cooldown. The four I have said are your best chances at staying high ranked, other killers have to be utilized in such a way that makes them un fun to play as. Sometimes, you‚Äôll get some dumb red ranks and you‚Äôll think ‚Äòhey, maybe so and so isn‚Äôt as bad as they seem‚Äô just to get pwned and insulted the next match.
---
For a popular killer tier list (plus my own opinion)
---
S: Spirit, Freddy
---
Reasoning, spirits versatility in mind games is far beyond any other characters, her nerf will change that slightly but it really doesn‚Äôt matter. Her speed and ability to catch up is what makes her so good. Freddy on the other hand, he‚Äôs probably the best killer right now, blood snares have the ability to stop most loops in an instant. Gen slow down builds are common on Freddy, he‚Äôs seen to have been over preforming lately. His map wide pressure is immense with his looping capabilities and his teleportation.
---
A: Nurse, Hillbilly
---
Nurse is still a really strong killer, just can‚Äôt have people spamming her omegablink and 5-blinks anymore. Hillbilly is by far one of the most balanced if not the perfect killer, i do not need to go into much reasoning, his only changes that need to be done are insta saw.
---
B: Trapper, Hag, Huntress, Oni
---
These people are situational, depending on what map, what build, and what survivors there are you may do really good or do awful. 
---
Everyone else is not viable up in the higher ranks very often, I encourage you to try them and have fun with then, as I did with doctor but when it comes to it, survivors can be very strong and at the same time do awful. You will eventually be forced into a position of using the highest ranked killer due to how survivors play. As someone who has reached rank 1 on killer/survivor on both console and PC, take it from me.
---
Lol now imagine get moried on the first down crazy huh?
---
Except for trapper!
---
The map is so full with grass and so dark that my traps just literally become invisible!
---
Perk should‚Äôve just been called ‚ÄúRun‚Äù and it plays AWOLNATION through the whole match
---
Cleansing takes time away from doing gens and she spends less then a secondpuking on gens, keeping you away from kicked gens quite some time. 
---
seriussly, I was agains't 3 cleanser an one non cleanser. The game lasted maby 25 minutes? with only 2 gens done by the non cleanser cuz I keept him alive, but he also started cleansing after a while. and I gave up on the hook while all injuired achv and killed 3 giving the non cleanser the hatch.
---
First post on here but I‚Äôm so happy! I manage to finally get the EGC save challenge done and had my first HO save. Wanted to share with others!
---
Nothing is more annoying as a killer than being decisive striked during the end game because you avoided decisive strike the whole game and then get called a filthy tunneler for eating the ds because you have to or being called a filthy slugger because you played around the decisive. It gives the survivors easy wins and sometimes they can completely devestate whe game with a full group of 4 decisive strikes if the survivors are a swf or not. The best thing is survivors hiding behind the "it's an anti-tunneling perk" when how they use it is, let's commit to a generator right infront of the killer so they grab me and get ds'd, lets jump into a locker so they can get ds'd and head-on'd when they grab me out of it.
---
Red rank here bro... not a beginner. You clearly have never done what I said. Wake up and be less toxic
---
Better hair 
---
Pls
---
Now I kind of want a map that takes place in a desert but also has that auto haven wrecker feel
---
I once Dead Harded into a hook on Preschool, stopped right there and just did a few teabags out of shame as I accepted my fate. 
---
The killer promptly let me go there and ran off out of pity.
---
Oh no now it‚Äôs fucking on, the pig is my homie and I ain‚Äôt about to let you walk into this part of town and think you can shit all over the place
---
New Survivor Perk: Fed Up With This Bullsh-
---
After suffering through thousands of trials in an endless hell, you have decided that enough is enough. Once per match, pressing interact on a locker will allow you to pull a hatchet out of it for 120 seconds, you and the killer are shown each other's auras for 2 seconds every 7 seconds for the duration of this time, overriding Undetectable. If you hit the killer 3 times, the trial ends and all survivors escape; the killer is not allowed to play that killer for the next 3 killer games while the entity repairs the damage. As punishment for your insolence, you cannot remove this perk from your survivor for the next 5/4/3 games as them, which instead makes you move at 75% speed until you complete your punishment. Only one survivor can activate this perk at a time.
---
If you are downed by the killer during the 120 seconds, the killer can perform a special mori on you worth a full 3 hook sacrifice amount of points. Dying to this mori doubles the duration of your punishment. If you stay alive for the full 120 seconds but fail to kill the killer, your punishment will last one game for every successful hit you get on the killer. 
---
*"The entity just wants us to suffer. That means all of us"*
---
I would run son of medic with autodidact.
---
the nurse is literally a ghost with telekinetic powers. she could Darth Vader your ass, lol
---
I do this for the extra points but take the last survivor to a door. I'm hoping you were nice like that lol.
---
She only seems to be able to do that if someone is weak, since she can only do it if the survivor is injured or dying. If ur perfectly healthy it seems like her telekinetic powers aren‚Äôt strong enough on their own.
---
Or you just make it so the timer runs completely out when a different survivor is hooked
---
No we wouldnt. I would hook them and get it over with and not be a dick about it.
---
It gets cleansed sometimes. If it doesnt it wins games.
---
Even if ruin gets cleansed though, those 30 seconds that a survivor isnt doing generators can make a big difference.
---
Personally I prefer PGTW
---
Now you can get 4 Legions
---
As the embodiment of the John Mulaney "They expect a 100 year old blind dog texting while driving, drinking a smoothie, and instead they see a 29 year old man trying his BEST." bit, I thank you for your patience, sir or Madam. Have an upvote.
---
By the way, as what I consider to be a fairly bad survivor I legitimately do appreciate honest, polite advice, and I don't feel like 'loop better' is condescending at ALL if you provide more specific qualifiers ("Don't just run in circles, T-structures are better than L ones", etc), so don't feel like you have to avoid saying 'try to loop better'. A couple shitcans might get offended, but people who do are usually going to be offended if you do anything but praise their play anyway.
---
i love your art
---
If you are getting gen rush too often start using perks like pgtw,surge or thrilling tremors or just play Legion lol people say they are kinda weak but with thanatophobia, ruin, blood echo and pgtw with some annoying add-ons like the legion pin or defaced smiley pin (mangled and broken status effect) the survivors waste so much time healing that they can't do any gens and when they start doing one you just kick it with pgtw lol Im in rank 4 btw but if you ever face a strong swf survivors then there is no counter for the gen rush they can easily run almost every killer(except for the spirit) for a decent amount of time.
---
Getting the trick of it has too many things that change with tiers with is hard to read and has weird number differences. 10/10/5 and 1/1/2 are not values BHVR would make. stick to one.
---
Tier 1 takes 20 hooks to fully stack increased success zones
---
Tier 2 takes 15 hooks to fully stack increased success zones
---
Tier 3 takes 15 hooks to fully stack increased success zones
---
Solution: make it always start at -5%, give 3/4/5% per stack and set the max to always 15 stacks (max zones would be 40/55/70%), might as well chance amount per stack to 4/4.5/5% to make tier 1 not useless (max zones 55/62.5/70%)
---
The second and last part should also be normalized. I'd just make it that every stack also increases your skillcheck chances by 2% no matter what tier (+40% on all tiers with max stacks) and set the time to always 150 seconds.
---
That‚Äôs basically the huntress
---
Congrats man. I just need the flashlight save, I suck with flashlights and even more on console which is what I'm trying for rn. Lol ;-;
---
I'm currently running Ruin, BBQ, PWYF and Nemesis. Just recently tried PWYF and loved it, amazing to surprise the survivors with tier 3 and 3 stacks of PWYF. Ends chases pretty quick.
---
Im running pgtw, thana, sloppy and bbq. With freddy i never get rushed but with spirit i always get rushed. Is it beacuse survivors want to get out fast with spirit?
---
You forgot one of the major points on both survivors and killers wanting to loop. As in that's one of the 4 categories where you can actually get Blood Points. On the other hand, you get nothing directly by being stealthy.
---
I honestly don't know why so many people butthole over Bill. He slapped a few shambling corpses around, big deal. I don't understand why people think he'd have any chance against an eldritch-ly empowered mass murderer. It'd be a stretch with the physically weakest of them, like Susie or Amanda.
---
Freddy has built in slowdown and a lot more pressure than spirit.
---
He passively puts pressure on the entire game while spirit has to build it, so its easier to punish a spirit.
---
Practice with her, and I'd reccomend taking out thana for something better.
---
It's not as good as it seems.
---
Nahhh you gotta be toxic sometimes üòÅ
---
I am the Lorax and i speak for the trees: GG EZ
---
He can hide in the lockers and #suck survivors in them
---
Nahhh I know you play toxic sometimes don‚Äôt lie üòÅüòÅ
---
Mkay. Maybe dying light? What would you recommend.
---
Of course!
---
But now I must run is not very good
---
first of all, too many things values which change with tiers. Tier 1 is totally useless.
---
Set the value to always 12 meters. 
---
look at the difference. 3% speed for one second at tier 1 and 5% for 3 seconds on tier 3. The saddest part is that both are useless and unnoticable. Always 3 seconds, Always 15%
---
When it comes to the rest, always set the value to maximum and make only the cooldown change with tiers
---
I wish that you were awarded for getting rank 1 besides the achievement for getting it for the 1 time, like, 500k bp or so, since keeping rank 1 in that game is quite challenging
---
Just had a game where my friend and I unhooked and healed this other dude twice, did 3 and a half of the gens between us, and evaded the killer soooo many times. Dude opened the gate and hauled ass out when my friend and I were both on first hook. Killer didn't even have NOED.
---
I don'tend up in Haddonfield enugh to know, which fence are we talking about (with picture if possible) ?
---
Short answer is not really. It can be useful on very very specific loops, but realistically those aren‚Äôt the majority of loops so you‚Äôd be better off running a different perk
---
why not tho?
---
overall, you're trying to make too many values change with tiers, the mistake bhvr used to make, which makes tier 1 versions of perks have around 15% of the power instead of intended \~70%
---
Dying light is nice, but it has to build up, so it's not great for the early game.
---
I never play spirit, so I dont really know her optimal perks.

Like a pi√±ata.
---
'Last Year' is another asymmetrical killer game.
---
As a killer main for the most part I would personally just make it to where Mori‚Äôs only work on players who are dead on hook anyways. If they go down and are gonna die on the hook anyways then a mori isn‚Äôt game changing. Being able to kill someone who otherwise would have had another chance though is completely game changing
---
Nah, it's not fun only for survivors who give up immediately they see such build.
---
That is the most amazing thing I‚Äôve ever seen
---
The killer loses a token the moment he attempts to attack with anything. including if he misses. consider being immersed if you're the obsession, and if the obsession changes upon a stun, that person should hide once they can, and others take note not to stun him later. 
---
the fact is, new perks have new counters. from now on, pallet usage might have to be different on some killers. that's not OP, that's just change.
---
Aww. My favourite part was when Michael tombstoned the air and Laurie was was just there fo the ride &lt;3
---
Merry Christmas!
---
Does the Upside down have emus ? I don't think so...
---
Now I want a pic of David, Bill, Jeff and Tapp high-fiving and drinking beer while all 4 legion members are hanging in the basement xD
---
Yeah, sorry bud, but most of us don't play like this. Winning ain't everything. Sometimes it's nice to make someone's shitty day just a little brighter.
---
If you ain‚Äôt first, you‚Äôre last
---
I did this a bunch last night.  
---
Just imagine a Huntress that can hit 360 around her and over walls.  
---
It's beautiful how strong Blood Spit is, tho I hate it when survs cleanse because I'll close out games too fast to get max BP.

How did you find my diary

Only when the other side does it too. Never when its a fair game
---
Can someone explain to me what the biggest part of his nerf has been? I quit the game about a year ago and came back about a month ago so I hardly knew legion before hand. Despite him being nerfed and everyone being upset about it, my games against him usually go poorly for everyone on the team and I just got to rank 1 a couple of days ago so the players are usually better.  He seems to be a pretty power killer from what I have seen?
---
‚Äúsurvivors who have friends aren‚Äôt allowed to have fun because i said so :3333‚Äù
---
I really think the game's too old for that. It's a giant and risky change that could kill the playerbase
---
Imagine not only using the imperial system. You also for some unknown reason put months first when writing out dates
---
Anyone else think this sounds kind of sexual? Just me?
---
I‚Äôve notice most of the female survivors have some pretty long hair cosmetics, but that is not the case for Kate. I created an idea of what it could look, perhaps someday she‚Äôll get something like it
---
Got it! You don't care. Have a good day sir.
---
this is definitely the description
---
if anyone says otherwise, they aren't me
---
because I am always hooked first when I have Deliverance
---
When you really look at Demodoggo, that sucker is very humanoid in general bone structure. Technically speaking, at least. I feel like I see all the same bones as a regular human character

Haha for messing around with a friend!! 
---
Amazing lol
---
Thats super bait.
---
I‚Äôm getting a seven feel (seven the movie).
---
What
---
Having that music in the menus and chases would be amazing but I‚Äôd imagine licensing it wouldn‚Äôt be easy
---
Well the title says KYS which isnt KYF. You can understand my confusion.
---
Don't worry man. I have a friend who used 30 flashlight trying to get the "blind the killer twice" challenge (over 1k hours on survivor btw)
---
I cried laughing when he used the entire flashlight trying to get blinds on pallets, and then killer went AFK and he had no flashlight left. He was desperately looking through chests but only found brown medkits
---
the anger in his voice... the most beautiful sound I've ever heard
---
I opened a locker as Demo for the first time and scared the shit out of myself. Just the locker. Nobody was in it. I wasn‚Äôt expecting him to be so loud and aggressive!
---
Just asked this in another thread but figured this is probably an even better place: Can someone explain to me what the biggest part of the legion nerf has been? I quit the game about a year ago and came back about a month ago so I hardly knew legion before hand. Despite him being nerfed and everyone being upset about it, my games against him usually go poorly for everyone on the team and I just got to rank 1 a couple of days ago so the players are usually better. He seems to be a pretty power killer from what I have seen?
---
Also nurse tends to get stuck a bunch on all the obstacles making it very difficult to reliably blink.
---
R.I.P Trapper man :(
---
I knew it.
---
How much time it takes for two people to heal one survivor at the same time (without any medkits/perks)?
---
And is it true that one survivor cant be healed by 3 others at the same time?
---
u/OIVV_ you can‚Äôt expect everyone to be 200 iq players like you. Yeah people like you and zubat might be gods of the game and only use dead hard for distance but we just don‚Äôt have big enough brains to do that. It‚Äôs just annoying because dead hard used to consistently work for avoiding hits.
---
 &gt; you can't even use his power on
---
Highly disagree with how easy it is to control superspeed and how easy blood is to see floating in the air
---
Was that a DC attempt there lol?
---
Omg. Thats totally it. Last year the game! Ty!
---
I love you daddy.
---
Oh shit haha I never even noticed that lol
---
Damn it haha
---
Daddy Myers loves you too, my child.
---
You can just blind the killer when he is picking up a survivour, you don't have to actually save him
---
Happy cake day
---
11th?
---
I saw Bill's was leaked and I was ready to spend some Auric Cells, then I realised it was free and it was the best thing ever.
---
I wish there was an option to skip rarity and just sort alphabetically
---
*title should have said KYF not KYS haha 
---
Sorry about that lol
---
Yes !!!!
---
Very nice of them to give it free .
---
What!? A low tier killer being played well!?
---
DC
---
Surge works with Surveillance which can be decent but only works on m1 killers and isn't very good on most maps
---
You‚Äôve never gone down early?? Dickhead.
---
This so cute omg üòÇüòç
---
Clearly do as I‚Äôve obviously had enough good games to be there. So you have NEVER had a bad game? Never gone down early? Wow, that‚Äôs amazing!!
---
I have never wanted to upvote somthong 3 times
---
Haha I run kindred on PS4 (im pc player so PS4 don't have anything on them...I'm LV 29 meg) and it's so funny watch all these yellow ranks crouching and just doing nothing when killer hooks me
---
....even though killer is nowhere within kindred range or heartbeat to be heard.
---
If killer is camping...again they don't do gens. You know I can (and all the others) see your aura right?
---
if it's meant to be a trailer for the game, I'd want clips to show more of what survivor's teachable perks do.
---
Like, new player could think Jake's good for Pallet Dancing after seeing this one
---
Devs i am so sorry about all the disgusting things ive said im sorry deeply. I love this game alot and i just hate when i get fucked by getting hit thru window and stuff but ill stop with the hate because you guys dont deserve it at all. Love you guys! You guys have an amazing game! Continue to grow it!!!!!! Maybe a winter event with exclusive cosmetics??? Love you guys if you did that would be fun to grind for
---
Granny pants.
---
Imagine being bullied by literally everyone
---
This post was made by Piggy gang
---
Even just applying her passive phasing effect to the default animation or adjusting the animation slightly so her arms and shoulders don't visibly elongate would have been nice.
---
If the really wanted to go all out, they could have her teleport up to the window and down to the other side, with freaky flickering after-images popping up during this, each stuck in frozen poses of pulling themselves up and down through the window.
---
It'd be some extra work sure, but it would have looked a lot nicer.
---
Haha fair point!
---
Dahmn boi she T H I C C
---
No that‚Äôs just the truth
---
send bhvr hag nudes until they retcon it
---
When this sub become karma whoring at his max level so you just have to post your cat to get to the front page , i dont care about your cat bitch
---
Good in indoor maps.
---
Good survivors can give you a hard time on Hawkins tho, as you can't do much to the strongest spots and there are many long walls that let survivors stand in a safe spot and wait for you to come from either side, removing the mindgame.
---
Gens usually don't go very quickly tho, as everyone is extra cautious (Spine Chill users and SWF when someone knows where you are will sit on them to pressure you tho)
---
No. The last thing we need is assclowns using real money to add more moris/keys/insta heals to the game.
---
Congrats! I wish I was done with mine, I spend all my time studying tho.
---
Vibe check.
---
I think it's more likely now she will . They seem to be getting better with making longer hair like yui's.
---
They could very much,put in non human characters, the only problem was supposedly the hook animation, all they really have to do is get creative with the hook animation considering it‚Äôs basically the same for all the killers
---
It depends if they‚Äôre getting skill checks and if they‚Äôre hitting good or greats, some killer perks also slow down healing. I have been healed by 3 survivors at once
---
Maybe in tests? See if players like it? I mean even for survivors its m1 simulator.
---
"You tunneled us all at the same time."
---
You get bloodpoints if they quit to the main menu, but not if they alt+f4 or pull their lan cable
---
I and most people I talked to about crows very rarely notice them flying as the killer, but my one friend (huntress main) is always like "I see a crow there", throws the hatchet at the other side of the map and lands it so... I guess most don't give a fuck, but some do
---
She flashing her panties yo.
---
I can relate to this. Charging as Oni looks more fun than Hillbilly (Hillbilly's third person animation hasn't been updated ever since to sync with chainsaw sprint).
---
Sorry Hillbilly players but Oni kicks it more.
---
I jump scare myself when I‚Äôm playing Huntress and there‚Äôs someone in the locker I‚Äôm reloading at.
---
* door opens*
---
Jake: Ah!
---
Me: AHHHHH!
---
We had underground complex before which is a survivor nightmare so it balances out
---
Bring back old grab. Make it only for fast vaults and make the slow grab for generator grabs and slow vault grabs
---
For real? I checked and didnt have it the other day, might as well give it a go today
---
Thanks for the explanation! I must really be missing something with the looping then because I can't really figured out how to loop him since he can vault
---
r/TheLegionLegion
---
For spirit: BBQ, ruin, sloppy and nurse's is a very strong option. Alternatively, bbq, ruin, whispers and haunted grounds can be good, but more rng.
---
Dying light requires a lot of build up for little return. Thana is a mild annoyance.
---
Talk about karma
---
Seems like you should join the stabby gang
---
After every game, I go onto the killer's line, click report...
---
And then check the option saying I had a good game and they were a fun killer.
---
GG friends, regardless of what happened :) &lt;3
---
So this is why i can‚Äôt find a game as a survivor..
---
More like buff no mither.
---
They look pretty nice but I'm not that excited as Ace already has his and I don't see the Oni in a Christmas sweater but hey atleast all the survivors have Christmas stuff (besides Laurie)

---
No totem perks or BBQ?
---
Although it doesn't look that bad of a build. Did she / he perform well though?
---
Cant fucking wait to rock nancys sweater like the disgusting nancy main i am
---
I go against more Plagues than Demo's at this point which is surprising.
---
Would be great for just joking around
---
That‚Äôs like my cat with my headphones. Took them from my bed ran down my ladder and went under the stairs.
---
For her rank she did pretty decent. Smacked us around with a few hatchets and secured a couple of hooks. 
---
She honestly wasn‚Äôt enough tho. You could clearly tell she wasn‚Äôt a red rank Huntress. It‚Äôs not at all fair to throw a green rank killer in with red rank survivors. My friend (Vibe check) and I were even on coms and we felt terrible after this match.
---
I'm trying to get flashlight saves to work on console. Half of the advice says to aim at the chest/neck while the other half says the face, and a small handful of people are saying aim slightly above the killer's head.
---
So which is it? I don't have friends to test this in KYF so I'm burning through my BP trying to figure this out faster than I'd like.
---
It's within 6 ranks and that's how it works. Rank don't mean shit anyway. Most rank 1s I see are boosted potatos
---
For sone reason I find playing the killer way more scary than playing survivor.
---
I do think they should give Balanced Landing some passive/active effect that works regardless of map.  It's a perk that is a roulette on if it's usable or not, which isn't a good thing.
---
Perhaps a one time activation trigger that you could force it, but with double the exhaustion timer.   Would give it a use case even on Shelter Woods (No, the tree fuckery doesn't count, with how inconsistent it is) or the flatter corn maps where you have just one-two combine harvesters on the entire map that can be used to trigger it.
---
It's more obvious with the chase halfway in the video, but after hooking you could see some visual choppiness while moving.
---
we gotta remove hatchets from huntress for a patch, change the achiev to whatever her new power is, then change it back to hatchets and change the achiev to 20
---
U don‚Äôt see boosted killers lol. 
---
Plus I never got to red rank by looping like a god. I got to red rank by using stealth and evasion to my advantage.
---
Did everyone get the Dweard?
---
Take a break,even a long one if you need to
---
He's gonna act like baby dwight to confuse others
---
In the time it takes for you to get a single hit in on the "god loop" of Ironworks, three gens will be completed.  
---
The only counter play is to walk away the second a survivor looks like they'll be going for that loop, the same as any other "god loop" in the game.
---
Yeah repair 4 gens and escape while not been seen by killer - depipe.
---
if they're not teabagging/being toxic or not waiting for teammtes, they're probably waiting for you to hit them out. 
---
Survivor point gain is pretty weak, so when you hit them it starts a chase, then they escape the chase when they leave. On top of that, you get points for hitting them too.
---
The lore doesn‚Äôt translate to her power intuitively. Billy‚Äôs and Leatherface‚Äòs lore explicitly mention chainsaws and that‚Äôs what they use. 
---
It‚Äôs intuitive that Plag weaponizes her sickness since her lore was being sick. 
---
Ghostface‚Äôs lore says he stalks people to make them easy targets that‚Äôs directly integrated into his stalk/exposed mechanic. 
---
Nurse stole people‚Äôs breaths but it‚Äôs not obvious what her power is - it‚Äôs uninititive, unlike a lot of other killers. The developers did a good job creating additional material that bridges the gap between her power and lore which helps it feel unique.
---
DS as an anti-tunnel perk is fine, but when i can literally chase and hook someone else, find the person that was previously hooked, down them again, and get ds'd. That's a problem.
---
Give the kitty the mouse!
---
If you didnt have to buy stuff to get Hex:Ruin maybe. I find its a good alternative getting up to 16% gen speed reduction vs 5% reduction on failed skillchecks (-2% great ones). It will be better than any perk that doesnt allow you to slow survivors down. Too many uneffective perks.
---
The game is a mess everywhere
---
As long as there was fair amount of pressure. Having Discordinance lvl. 1 is great but you know, it's all about simple performance. At the Killer tries is all that matters.
---
actually pig is probably ALOT worse than legion without powers. in the movies we see amanda get beat up and thrown around alot. also notes that she isnt strong enough to carry an 100 pound female body on her own because amanda weighed less than 100 pounds (on top of that being 5'3) and needed Hoffman to do it for her. in the game, pig looks smaller and skinnier than the male legion. she got beat the shit out of a dying cop with a broken leg, thrown around by someone who looks like david king ,  chased down by david lookalike , rescued by a 14 year old. they had to literally resize her to be around 5'10 (thats what the male survivors look like) or else she would be tiny and unbelievable as to how the survivors arent beating the crap out of her
---
not even a few months
---
&gt;I mean besides the obvious cheating one
---
Not even that one, lmao
---
Woah, sorry to upset you. I can't imagine the rage if I were to step on your lawn.
---
It doesn't, but it makes healing take longer, which makes them injured for longer, which makes them drop more orbs before they heal up and discourages them from healing
---
its way more frustrating to have to wait 15-20 mins to get into a game as killer only for it to end in 2 minutes from commodious toolbox and all that stuff, than it is for a survivor to wait 2 seconds to get into a match and get killed after 6-7 minutes. thats why people hate gen rushing, it feels like the killer doesnt even get to play the game and the slowdown perks killer has are inconsistent at best or instantly destroyed at worst.
---
Wow. Bad Cat!
---
Neverrrrr
---
All jojokes are expected anywhere so no
---
Read /new. Killers don't complain nearly as much as survivors.
---
Both sides might have an equal *percentage* of shittiness, sure... But a 25% toxicity rate means you'll get 1 shitty killer every 4 games. Or you'll get 1 shitty survivor every game.
---
Bit of a difference there, yeah?
---
Make buckle up activate when you heal yourself or a non-dying survivor. It'd actually have decent utility.
---
On pc reporting barely does anything for either people. If you have video proof you can report in game and write a support ticket to maybe achieve a temp ban for them. It shouldn‚Äôt affect matchmaking at all, it doesn‚Äôt pair cheaters with cheaters.
---
Hey I understand losing teammates sucks so I won't blame you for venting about it as we can't keep out emotions in forever
---
They are the hardest maps to play on, but when learned, they are map-wide infinites
---
Same used to go for The Game, but without old Balanced Landing it's almost impossible to get anything going
---
Most of them.
---
I'd personally delete all Coldwind farms (especially Rotten Fields)
---
I'm a flashlight novice on console, and I went in with a yellow flashlight (no add ons) and aimed for the neck. It worked pretty well for me - I got my blinds that way.
---
I meant without any perks on survivor and killer side changing healing speed, no skill checks, just base healing. Does it work like gen repair speed? So two people is 44,44 and three is 33,33 or is it different
---
Well, yeah. If they gave no mither a redeeming quality, they might overbuff it from 'meme perk' to 'situationally useful'
---
Discordance gets worse when you tier it up cuz BHVR didn't test it and refuses to switch it around
---
Oh yea totally you'll encounter more because of the way the game set up(4v1) causing survivors to seem more toxic because the higher number of them you encounter while actually it's the same number of shittiness.
---
Her kit screams awkward and it's my biggest problem with her.  Every other killer has some ways to deal with them \[Unless it's a Billy who's literally just sticking his chainsaw inside of you while revving\] but not Plague, she's just awkward.
---
That‚Äôs because there‚Äôs 4 survivors to every 1 killer.
---
Restart application?
---
Lol all u gotta play is huntress
---
Well, that sound like something that could totally be the scenario of an horror movie, so that‚Äôs good enough for me.
---
This is really shitty. As a note I've always wanted to ask killers who do this why, it wastes your own and others time and makes you look like a shitstain.
---
Exploits can be banable. I hear a streamer got a ban for standing under the killer after a drop to get him stuck. 
---
I imagine most reports aren‚Äôt about camping, but a bunch of cowards claiming wall hacks and speed buffs. Is it even possible to change your speed without triggering an anti cheat? I don‚Äôt think so
---
i wish there was a way i could replace the game's sounds, i love it
---
I'm now maining billy, after maining Ghosty for a while. I'm getting bullied like half the games at rank 1 now, since i'm trying to M2 only.
---
Probably more
---
But it‚Äôs still good to have the option of buying it instead of just not existing
---
Can't be mithered with it all anyway, you know what I mean?
---
incorrect. you can keep perks you had but you have to lvl bill up to unlock the ability to get them again
---
equip an item/offering or restart the game and that should do the trick
---
well from what we know the entity feeds on hope and every time a survivor is killed they wake up at camp but they lose a small part of that hope till they eventually lose all hope and the entity sees them as "broken" an send them to the void so i like to assume the survivors that would fight back did try to at first, got themselves killed and decided to avoid fighting after that
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Ok new system me bad. Dont play mutch on connsole so good info ty
---
U know that with the fixing there‚Äôs always gonna be a few problems and also the cosmetic team is not the same as the bug fixing team
---
I was just thinking, hillbilly vs hillbilly would be hilarious and so would myers
---
Its so cute when they do that! My boy tries to kill the other team when my partner plays CS. It's so damn cute him trying to help üòÜ
---
Okay youre my favourite artist now. Luv u.
---
Lol. Didn't even notice that.
---
Something along the lines of "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
---
Some people aren‚Äôt in red ranks
---
Yeah goodluck using DEAD HARD on dedicated servers mate.
---
But we are talking about one specific player who said he doesn't want to use it because it makes him stop chasing and start kicking.
---
I don‚Äôt see what gets a killer *HOOKED* on camping!!!!
---
GET IT?!
---
I face him two days ago (two No Mithers in team :( ), but it's true that I not seem him often. Like twice time in months
---
Meg (although I may switch to Kate) and Spirit/Hag. I chose meg because the first role I played was survivor and I always choose the female character and megs perks worked for me; Spirit because I love her lore and she was one of the first killers I played, and Hag because I love her mechanics, even tho I suck at placing the traps or timing the teleport lmao
---
I main the pig. I got hyped by the saw chapter. And I like being a sneaky b*. I also play Legion, Spirit, Plague, Demogorgon and hag.
---
As for survivor I keep swithing between Nea and Claduette.
---
read the original post again to get what we're talking about. a specific user that chose not to use it. I'm showing you his reasoning.
---
The billy part has me dyingüò≠üòÇYeah you‚Äôre damned if you do, damned if you don‚Äôt. I was always told not to cleanse but if my team mates do I do because you might as well.
---
In console i cant download the huntress dlc and its free, anyone with the same problem?
---
That's so cute ‚ù§ thank you üëç
---
There should be David, Jeff, Bill and Ash not two girls one pussy nad one man
---
You shouldn't regret anything,if you play enough at one point you will want to have all anyway
---
I know, i brought him to p1 before his nerf, got him to p2 very short before the second nerf and didnt touch him cause he sucked to bad after that. Old freddt was fun af tho. Maybe not balanced, but I really liked the Dreamstate invisible killer you could never be to sure if you properly hid from, and it was redicolus fun to watch a survivor trying to figure out where the fuck I am.
---
Ash. I bought him for mettle of man and then they nerfed it into ground.
---
Man and here i am only halfway through tome 2, congrats though
---
Dafug? I just say git gud lol nah just dont use his dash attack where they can 360
---
They should just fix both
---
Apparently this song has a different copyright holder.
---
Its like left 4 dead but instead of zombies and survivors its killer and school bois.
---
*visible concern*
---
https://youtu.be/oTJF1h2Oi_E
---
I honestly hate having to just walk away from a chase because of super safe loops. If a survivor outplays me I'm frustrated, but I acknowledge they did a great job. When it comes to super safe loops and multiple super safe tiles spawned together I get tilted as fuck at the shit RNG. 
---
I just find it funny how some survivors don't understand the strength of certain loops, or how much they waste time. Had a match against ttv player on Elementary. After the match he was bragging about being a god at looping cause I chased him through the school and got a 0k. I had to roll my eyes because I intentionally went into that shit loops because I wanted to see how long it would take to catch someone.
---
Repair 4 gens - 99 the gates - loop the killer and escape?
---
Eh see I don't want to have them all if I don't even like them like the spirit for example she's just so unfun to me I'd rather have purchased a McChicken because I'd have more enjoyment then playing that weeb trash
---
Self-care? Ah another survivor who wastes centuries in game and wonders why they lose.
---
this right here is legion's origin story
---
And that's why you never buy a survivor or killer for perks because BHVR can just take your money and then nerf them
---
Honestly Pop is a better choice on freddy than ruin
---
Blood echo is just bad, as legion you don't really mind exhaustion perks anyway, and thana its just not amazing, you have no info perk for the early game
---
I'd pay to see that.
---
Now I want to see a killer with four legs so badly, like his front ones would be ended with claws or some kind of stingers and he would smack survivors with them.
---
Yeah, I just couldn‚Äôt get used to her... I play her now and again to try and get survivors to boop the snoot but that‚Äôs it üòÇ
---
Well maybe we could have a proper Stalk Off if you didn't strap a giant red flashlight to your forehead that keeps shining in my eyes
---
Multiple times
---
That ass is so flat I iron my clothes on it
---
Well, there's always a nerf after the PTB anyways, right? ;)
---
I bought Kate and Clown separately with shards so I didn't get her white top
---
everyone with their opinion but i will buy and level up all characters to have acces to all the content and be able to play with any character or perk
---
The game is not for you if you can't take being chased a long while
---
And screaming (in English) at the English for using different words. Funny that.
---
that includes self healing. but if it would say other survivors then self healing doesn't count
---
And legion

It's pretty bad, read their subreddit.

I bought Leatherface when I first started and I didnt enjoy playing him. So I just leveled him up to get BBQ. It's worth the price just for BBQ because you will probably not get it from the Shrine of Secrets any time soon.
---
Gotcha, thank you! I was having a hard time doing it and was going to go for self healing but the last game I just did I managed to heal 3 people so in the end it didn't even matter... but its good to know for the future. Thanks again.
---
I'm a survivor main. I've been sending positive messages to cool players, killers and survivors alike. People are usually cool back too! It's just sad because it's so against the norm that people don't know how to react. I told a guy earlier, "Survivors need killers to run from and killers need survivors to kill." Spread the love! Still if a survivor teabags you behind a pallet for no reason, they should be tunneled to hell and back.
---
Can‚Äôt be healed
---
It‚Äôs a joke friend

This happened to me. Was playing trapper on badham 2, just patrolling and setting traps. Random ass injured Dwight pulls the pallet on me, vacuums me onto the other side of the pallet, I turn around and grab him off the pallet vault. Scared the absolute piss out of me and I got super confused when I nabbed him

And we all know who's the best Legion member...

I

The left-most survivor kinda looks like Konan from Akatsuki

You're taking what I said and reaching really hard dude.

literally everyone with 2 brain cells:

"literarly"
---
That's just stupid isn't it. Oni should be reworked on.
---
Its because of tbagging, pointing, nodding, skill animation spamming etc. that I fail to see what new emotes would take away. 
---
Evidently most of the community doesn't take this game as a serious horror-toned game and goof around when the opportunity arises.
---
I'll never get over how ridiculous a bi-pedal demogorgon looks.
---
I'm not sure if your comment was /s or not but people unironically think that if you like something edgy you yourself must be an edgy teen trying to relate.
---
When they're using their power there's not much you can do other than take the hit if there's no pallets nearby. But once they've hit you once, they'll either leave you to look for other survivors, or have to come out of his power (which stuns them). Once their power is down, they can't fast vault windows or go over pallets, so you can loop them safely then.
---
Should‚Äôve left them on, it‚Äôs actually hilarious knowing that those comments will be there until either A. They pussy out and delete them or B. You delete them. I like looking back over the salt and trying to find players in game that previously commented on my profile
---
I've been of the opinion for a long while now that Billy has to travel a short distance to instadown \[Like 2 or 3 steps\] vs being able to do it from ANY distance but that's just cause I HATE that type of Billy when I get matched with em.
---
You brought a pipe to the trial? Fucking cri- BONK.
---
I‚Äôve had it happen to me before for juking killers and looping them. Usually wind up getting face camped at the very end and shit talked :/
---
It‚Äôs time investment getting better perks or all perks to a single survivor is outrageous and gotta take into consideration learning to loop a killer. Time is an investment. Probably doesn‚Äôt have close to maybe 1000 hours.
---
I actually never read the title xd
---
Personally I use Ruin or corrupt intervention, Remember Me, Devour hope (no one ever sees it coming) and either BBQ or Discordance
---
Emotes would just make the game even more toxic
---
No Mither has ascended. It has surpassed being a useless perk, and now has truly become a throwing perk

Like the hatchet noises, her screams and her humming don't  already spot her on the early seconds in the game.
---
Was playing earlier against a trapper and a nurse. Both of them got demolished, but the trapper stuck around. I left immediately when I opened the door (was doing adept Quentin, and learned that Blood warden is an absolute nightmare, so I don‚Äôt risk it), and my teammates stayed behind to teabag. I was hoping the trapper had noed or blood warden just to teach them a lesson. Sadly, he didn‚Äôt. The nurse basically got one hit in the entire game, opened the exit gate, and I left while teammates teabagged. Nurse blinked over, stared, and DC‚Äôd
---
While I appreciate his perks very much I run Pop constantly I have never and likely will never enjoy playing Clown.  He's chronically unfun for me.  I don't enjoy his kit at all.
---
Legion. By far the worst killer the devs have designed. Bad power and not even remotely fun. For some odd reason, so many people in this sub love them though.
---
It reduces the fail penalty for attempting hook escapes

---
Feels like this all the time. Except when I'm survivor, then my teammates are a bunch of terrified sheep who only know how to die
---
This is a good argument but then comes about the whole "swf shouldn't be allowed" if we're playing for a team then why is swf unfair? We're a team so we should talk and work as a team. Or are we not a team and therefore your argument is invalid?
---
But where's Dwight? :)

I mean, you don't have to "buy" Hex: Ruin.  
---
You can unlock it in the Shrine using an in-game currency that is only obtainable through playtime. If you don't want to rely on luck, however, you can instead unlock the Hag with that very same in-game currency, as you can with all non-licensed killers, and then level her up until you reach the teachable.  
---
There is no real money required for Hex: Ruin.
---
I bought One and want the cosmetic for Yui so badly.. don't know if I should just buy her too with auric or wait for the DLC on sale and buy her that way..

And the camping is horrendous.

You're lucky that you can get into games as a killer, man. No matter what I do I always get half an hour of waiting.
---
I wonder if it was 'fixed'? The only fixes in Ch. 14 patch which can fit are: 
---
* Fixed an issue that caused medkit healing not to count towards the Wounded Healer achievement.
---
* Fixed an issue that caused achievements measured in percentages to reset when the user rebooted the application.¬†
---
What are 'achievements measured in percentages' anyway? ;P is Wounded Healer measured like that? 
---
Can we have someone wise confirm Wounded Healer fits into that category and thus, our problem is resolved, BEFORE we try it again?
---
Since, if Wounded Healer is measured liek that, that means we need to start from the scratch (as it was always going back to 0/50 up until the patch day)
---
If no, it is still broken, since the second point doesn't apply to it, and the first one means only medkits, not the general problem.
---
Demogorgon and Oni, i just dont like neither.
---
I actually did this whole challenge on survs because I noticed the bug. I found it much more guaranteed to get 2-4 kills in match while playing with my sometimes-derpy SWF than getting those with killer lol
---
If you don‚Äôt care about the opinions of others, why should people care about your opinion.
---
I don‚Äôt play Legion incase you get butthurt, just posting the question.
---
*slams papers on desk to apply pressure*
---
same when they report you for looping :)
---
Most people use it wrong which ends up wasting a lot of time. It‚Äôs not a chase perk like Lithe or Balanced. Use it to get around the map and it‚Äôs a nice safety net when you‚Äôre on a gen. You can increase usage by 99ing and is probably the most useful sprint perk if you do get it back in a chase.
---
If you are saving it however and walking everywhere it‚Äôs a complete waste of a perk.
---
Well you have to consider that the entity gives each killer supernatural strength.
---
To be honest, I'd pay to see a a 5-man Billy race. 3 laps around the map
---
Honestly they were smart not to run any hex perks that match.  OP brought in a map.  Never run totems against a swf with a map.  That hex is gone in 40 seconds or less almost guaranteed.  Key and map together too oof.  Harshest item pairing left in the game.  Yeah this killer had an uphill battle ahead of them in that lobby regardless of rank.
---
He just wants a smooch, what‚Äôs wrong with that?

Imagine not being able to down survivors with one hit very easily

Not sure about the best,  but I get a 4K around  75% of the time with this Shape build.

The perks I run are Monitor&amp;Abuse, Ruin, BBQ&amp;Chili, and Nurses Calling.

Add-on combos I typically run are dead rabbit/hair bow or a mirror shard. However occasionally I‚Äôll run J. myers memorial/fragrant tuft of hair for an absolute bloodbath

The ranking system is terrible. I hope the rework for ranks that‚Äôs planned soon will be a lot better.

I was about to comment this, hahaha.

Never. All I get nowadays are trappers and the occasional nurse and ghostface (like every 1 out of 30 matches)

You're either trolling or a cartoon.  It's physically impossible to take that comment of yours with any degree of seriousness.

---
‚ÄúWait no I‚Äôll wait after the clip ends‚Äù
---
A cool ability where the killer can set up like sensors that will ping when survivors are within X distance of them.
---
The only way to go down ranks is to throw multiple games. I won't bother though. Any survivor can get into red ranks by just playing it save.
---
Legion on console definitely.

Fair enough. Just sick of getting bullied every second game.

---
There are a lot of survivors in red ranks now, which have over 10 minute queues and they "steal" all killers up to 6 ranks above them because of the 6 rank rule
---
the 6 rank rule doesn't always work tho. I keep getting rank 14 killers as a red rank survivor
---
I wouldn't complain. It takes ages to find a match sometimes.
---
Survivors - long queues in high ranks, short in low ranks
---
Killers - short queues in high ranks, long in low ranks
---
Played a match on hawkins as trapper against a SWF with flashlights, and they were being stupidly altruistic against me. kept trying to go for bodyblocks and flashlight saves, fell for the stupidest traps, and I literally downed 2 of them while I was hooking a Claudette. Went to pick up one, she DC‚Äôd, and it wasn‚Äôt even first hook. Left to find the last person and let my precious slug Meg rest on the floor. Came back after finding the person, threw Meg on hook, and midway through the sacrifice animation she DC‚Äôd. Apparently she didn‚Äôt want her points
---
A lot of games I‚Äôm currently playing have either a battle pass I want to grind or cosmetics I want to buy and DbD is one of them. I‚Äôm conflicted
---
its really good, but its hard to compare with the other 5
---
Legion for gameplay, Oni for perks.
---
You could've just tried it out... But yeah, each attempt takes off 1/12th of the bar, rather than 1/6th, so you have 6 attempts before you reach 2nd stage.
---
Do they work??
---
Legion. Oni is fun but you need higher sensitivity that you can have on console
---
That is the way of life now. Bully or be bullied I guess.
---
If you want the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù it‚Äôs spirit fury, enduring, BBQ, and ruin. It‚Äôs the bitch build just because you DEVOUR pallets and basically ignore the counter play, but it‚Äôs the strongest build at the moment.
---
THERE IS A DAVID DAKIMAKURA? I NEED IT RIGHT THIS SECOND I WILL SHOOT SOMEONE
---
I think they should give each survivor a different 1 and 2 emote (on keyboard) that you pick. Each survivor should have two unique emotes that fit their personality and once you purchase them you can unlock those emotes on all survivors, but still have more emotes for purchase or unlockable through challenges.
---
Some fun examples:
---
1. shoo/go away
---
2. Flip off
---
3. Shake head
---
4. Nod head
---
5. Facepalm
---
6. Clap
---
7. Rub hands together
---
8. Up yours
---
9. Cry
---
10. Laugh
---
11. Finger across throat (‚Äúyou‚Äôre dead‚Äù)
---
12. confused John Travolta
---
I think they really should wait on the next chapter and do a huge QOL chapter instead. Not only fixing bugs and game breaking issues, but bringing in some animation, texture, and model touch ups. They could really fix some of the survivors ugliness and make them look better and more like their concepts. Also give each survivor their own animation style. Meg could have more athletic animations, Bill has a slight decrepitness to his movements, Quentin seems sleepy, Jane acts more elegant, etc. Same goes for killers, give each one uniqueness to their movement based on their personalities, or movie references.

Only way to stop getting wound up by better players is to play better, Same stands as what I said previously it's very full filling wiping a full team of flashlight clicking neas and megs and if you can learn to counter that then you'll be able to take on anyone üëç
---
If survivors can wind up the killer and continously escape chases with them they will continue to do so my mindset is that they can't be toxic when they're on a hook practice against the high rank players because eventually you'll be up against them every game.
---
Not trying to be a dick either genuinely Ive been in your position and know how annoying the learning curve is if your getting wound up with the game just take a break and remind yourself the games not set up to let you win every match. Besides if all your intrested in is farming some blood points you don't have to secure 4ks every match :D
---
Peter Dinklage &lt;3
---
I‚Äôm not toxic in game. Most people lead with their emotions, hence, the countless posts under controversial. 
---
Your rank is arbitrary fam. But keep up those ggs!
---
This makes the Legion seem so much scarier!
---
The chase officially ends when a survivor gets downed I know this from when PWYF used to proc after u downed ur obessesion bc it though u just gave up on the chase
---
If you want monitor and abuse and infectious fright, your terror radius stays for enough time to affect the infectious fright
---
This is me every time I play killer. When I go for cheeky and very ballsy lunges, I always lunge myself forward as I go for it. I get so into it that I actually nearly bang my microphone‚Äôs boom arm and knock shit off my desk
---
dude im playing on a console and i have never seen any invisible trees in my 3 years game time
---
and how even is an invisible tree gamebreaking xD how do  you even know it was a tree if it was invisible?
---
Survivor plays completely fine fps wise, some killers can lag but thats like -10 fps in some cases.
---
worst ive had is doctors shocks.
---
I mainly report other survivors
---
Survivor : Feng and Meg
---
Killer: Legion
---
Ok good to know
---
Just like ghostface it matters what your terror radius is when you down them. As him if you use his iridescent add-on that makes auras visable of people outside your terror radius when you down someone in your nightshroud it shows everyone on the map even if they're right next to you.
---
And good players can Dodge the hatchets and put the huntress in a situation where she can't hit you with one. You can loop a huntress at a majority of pallet loops if you know what you are doing, but you can not Dodge corrupt. 
---
You say hiding is a strat but there is work arounds, what happens when you cleanse and someone goes down near you and the killer had infectious? I will tell you what happens, you kill you're self and you're teamate.
---
Your in the rank range so hard to avoid honestly.

You vault quickly enough

Already do but wasnt sure if someone made a vid on it

I hate when people make the cosmetic argument even though they barely got thir 3rd cosmetic. Ghost Face, Spirit, hell even Pig got 2 cosmetics before Legion got their 2nd cosmetics *a whole year* after release. They could have technically gotten their Christmas sweaters laster year as well but they didn't. Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Doctor get WAY more cosmetics than any other killer in a short amount of time, it makes me sad for Plague mains.
---
You dont even have stable 30fps on console. Getting stuck on invisible trees and seeing through them is not game breaking? What I'm saying is game with playerbase this size shouldn't be in this state. All they ever do is spam content they can sell
---
I still have survivors straight up run into me sometimes. I'll get the first hit, they lose track of me, mindgame themselves, and then run into me trying to figure out where the fuck they went lol
---
Watch 'Touch my totem' from Otzdarva, pretty good combo shown
---
Legion has far more than 3 cosmetics lol...
---
They paid good together since M&amp;A's terror radius increase is a quick fade out not an instant disappearance so it'll last long enough for infectious fright to go off.
---
Neither have I since I started playing back in June when Ghostface came out. It also sucks I never got to play around in a Summer lobby either since they decided to not do a summer event to focus working on dedicated servers.
---
If no one cleanses and all survivors play optimally without getting hit, they are denying the plague her power.
---
If one survivors starts cleansing while everyone else isn't they are either forced to cleanse as well, or they face the risk of getting downed in seconds because sickness prevents stealth and they are still broken/injured.
---
If every survivor starts cleansing immedeatly once they get sick, the plague pretty much always has her power, but survivors can play stealthy/wait it out or get chased and are able to take 2 hits.
---
I'd say those are the facts and the worst thing to happen to survivors is paragraph 2.
---
BL is probably the least busted survivor perk, and the ‚Äúbalancing‚Äù they did to it kind of just made it trash. If a survivor is looping me hard with BL then I just go onto someone else. If u get Infi-looped and gen rushed that‚Äôs kinda ur own fault. Just sucks to see another good perk get shat on rather than fix any issue.
---
Killer sided? Yea, sure. When a mediocre solo survivor like me gets to rank 6 and in one night makes two killers in a row rage quit . Sure, it's killer sided.
---
Congratulations, you have clearly taken peanit‚Äôs comment entirely out of context, and it seems that all you can do is spam people with the same copy and paste message of ‚Äúthis is clearly not true and bullshit.‚Äù
---
To reiterate what others have said before, and to make it clear if you‚Äôre that dense:
---
You have to unlock the teachables just like everyone on PC had to. The teachables were originally generic on console, and thus weren‚Äôt locked behind teachables. If you had the perks before bill was made available, you kept them. If you prestige AND LOSE EVERYTHING or buy a new character, then you lose access to them until you get the teachables and get them through the bloodweb.
---
It doesn‚Äôt take a degree in Astro-physics to understand this, and nobody gives a shit if you spent your (not at all) precious, earnable, and TOTALLY FREE blood points. You fucked up by not thinking it through and checking, get over it
---
I agree
---
I run Ruin/STBFL/Agitation the 4th is whatever I feel like probably corrupt intervention once I unlock it.
---
I'm not the best trapper main out there just saying so take that into consideration.
---
Prep time for trapper means u have to give up a gen or 2 bc trapper is all about mid game or end gsme. Traps should usually stay in one area that you can protect bc if u spread them out too far chances are they are going to get disarmed and u wouldn't wanna walk that far just to rearm a trap.
---
Add-ons are also very important always a trapper bag even brown the second one I like to run tar bottle bc on some maps his traps become pitch black and impossible to see, plus when trapping u want to predict where survivors are going to go in a loop or in the map think of it as survivor highways they usually travel on, and u never really wanna trap directly on a pallet bc that's obvious cos u have to remember if they see u place a trap chances are it's pretty much useless.
---
And also sometimes RNG is going to screw u over to the point u can't win or sometimes survivors know that they wanna be on u 24/7 keep u busy from placing traps, u also have to know what chases to give up and which to start.
---
I would honestly recommend watching Otzdrava to learn trapper

I don't really regret buying any of them since I'm a completionist and I *NEED* to have every perk regardless of useless or niche they are. But if we're talking like who has the worst perks in the game or someone you shouldn't buy. Definitely Ash. His perks range from OK to dogshit bad. For killers I would say Freddy. He himself is an absolutely amazing killer, A tier no doubt. But his perks are really lackluster. Fire Up on paper sounds cool since you gain more momentum and power as the game tilts towards the survivors favor but the % amounts are so bad it's not even worth using. Blood Warden is the definition of a hit or miss perk. It can be the difference between leaving with a 1k and Entity Displeased. Or getting a 4K Merciless Killer. I find it to be way to luck based as to whether you actually catch a survivor while the gates or open, or if you even use it all if you finish the game before the gates are powered. As for Remember Me, I'm not even gonna talk about it, it self explanatory.
---
the mend time is nothing right now also who heal against a legion anyway? They are like the weaker version of Plauge just push gens my dude. If he sees you in a healthy state he can just use his power

Thana is a most have on legion lol and when you have some knowledge about the game you don't need a info perk

Trapper because I love the feeling of 'i bet your going to step here' or just area denial in general

I think Bubba vs Billy would be a cool matchup. They could be like dueling with their chainsaws like swords.

They just need to buff his flick on console a bit more he can't 180 on PC anymore so that would be enough of a change

I can agree to this. It is like with Michael Myers, he enjoys killing. He doesn't give a shit about what the entity wants. He just wants to kill, and it is why he has shit like Tombstone, which outright ignores the entity's demands.

You need to report people in game if you want any ‚Äòreal‚Äô reports (Reporting through BHVR support) or they can‚Äôt do anything as the reports log the game information.

Imagine that happening just when you get hit and the blow pushes you on the stairs forcing you to run on a fours until you eventually pick up yourself.

My favorite part is when people say it should not be changed because people can just run No Mither and make the Oni‚Äòs power useless.....as if someone would ever use No Mither just for the off chance they might face the Oni....and even then they would be an insta-down so he wouldnt even need this power in the first place.

Get gud.

I tried to do the Evil Incarnate trophy. Once.
---
It's the greatest example you can ever see of survivors switching from Sore Winner to Sore Loser. They thought I was just a baby Myers so kept teabagging and jumping over pallets in front of me, and flashlight clicking. As soon as Tier 3 hit, I immediately tombstoned the nearest clicker, and by the time I grabbed the second one she DCed. The remaining two ran into lockers and refused to come out. Eventually I just hooked one and let the other run off to the hatch.
---
Such fucking toxicity. If I had been UNABLE to get the trophy through normal gameplay I'd have been ok with it. Even if they'd played normally but then tried to sabotage me, I'd have understood. But to go from one toxic extreme because they thought they could bully me, to absolute toxic sore loser when they realised I wasn't a baby at all, was ridiculous. If you're going to try to be a bully, at least take it with grace when you get fucked back.
---
I heard of someone who used dead hard and balanced ( pre patch) so they would dead hard and use the stagger reduction from balanced to keep loops going
---
Adorable
---
Not every killer is going to let you run them for 5 gens unless they're rank 20 buddy also it only takes one irritated killer to face camp tunnel you when you get hooked no matter how long u ran them for.
---
I'm not sure about that, could be

In the words of Otz "Trapper is like playing poker and even when you have all the right cards you could still lose" but personally I would say trapper has one of the highest skill ceilings bc there is so much u have to understand and learn

---
That‚Äôs not an answer to the question
---
Crossplay is available between steam and Windows store only, I believe
---
I don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm looking at. I‚Äôm new to the game. Why would the killer be running away from survivors?
---
Ok boomer...
---
Then you don't play very much because I get ds'd all the time when I'm not even tunneling. As everyone has already pointed out, 60s of immunity is a long time and in addition to not being able to pick them up, them going for unhooks or jumping in lockers is a thing too. 
---
It's like when Scott Jund said in one of his recent vids and said "I have thousands of hours and have only gone against sweat squads 3 or 4 times", which is total horseshit. I go against them every day at red ranks, since the percentage of groups in red ranks is way higher than others.
---
I‚Äôm actually very surprised with laughter that people want no mither buffed like this. Even if it did, would anyone even consider running it outside of this Oni hype period?

Like this irrational fear of 4 NM like that‚Äôs not throwing the game against every killer except Plague and Oni. Like why are y‚Äôall stanning such a terrible perk to be maybe sometimes somewhat decent vs one killer? 
---
Plus even if you didn‚Äôt drop orbs passively from just being Brokrn, you‚Äôd still trigger game events like vaults and working on gens and being hooked. Even if NM reduced all blood orb generation by Half, I doubt anyone would seriously consider running it outside of full blown memeing because against the rest of the killer cast you‚Äôre just throwing the game away. 
---
Y‚Äôall are so wild on here lol
---
So happy for Bill
---
What happened here?

Ash and Tapp sweaters please

I got reported by a tombstone Myers for speedhacking. "You where faster then me"

You cannot be healed by three survivors at the same time.
---
Switch to killer, you'll have 10 minutes to defuse the situation then.
---
Imagine having to play around loops.

This post was made by Nurse gang.
---
I'm gonna say it again, SB is the best exhaust perk in the game, change my mind
---
Try it on the game with perks that end chases/ resume them quickly: play with your good, brutal strength, ruin, etc. got it first try that way. Found it on a guy on YouTube called jumpscare myers. If a guy dc‚Äôs during the animation, it will still count as long as you get the kill points.
---
I'm a spectator main now. I am above all your pettiness, foolish humans.
---
Definitely other way around hahahahaha
---
I know, i wanted to be tahxic, but it didnt work. My goal before rank reset is to go from rank 1 to rank 8 so i end up in green. What I plan to do tomorrow is just join games and find the killer right away, and just goof off. It helps with the depipping process. If you dont want to wait until rank reset to decrease rank, i would just join lobbies and go afk or the likes. DCing can now "ban" players, so i wouldnt necessarily do that
---
&gt; it turned out to be the other way around, and that‚Äôs just too much.
---
Yeah you're right thank god killers now have a counter for no mither!
---
I think you can use your common sense mate, to see that the only perk that stops bleeding could potentially stop a character from bleeding (in a different form).
---
Nobody is acting as if it got nerfed (not like all these whiny legion mains who have taken over the sub again - he didn't get nerfed). It just seems that people were hoping the perk might finally have a (very situational) use, but alas, nothing.
---
No mither has long been overdue a buff. But only a minor buff. I would quite like reason to use it without it becoming meta or OP.
---
Even the guy you a replying to who got downvoted was only joking lol...
---
Pretty close, ngl
---
Who needs hatchets?
---
*whips out the strap with religious intent*

ah yes, Sweater Susie :3
---
After the update I wait 30-20 sec as killer and 1 hour as survivor
---
I made a funny comment, which no one replied to, hey other community, look at my funny comment...  
---
why
---
And if its killer, just afk after u ready up then go back to it
---
This comment went to +16 and then to -9 lol. Seems like the serious people woke up and were confused by the entire discussion being a meme
---
Personally, I don't play shape because of my experience with them(ever get exposed from across the map) but your friend can have all the mains he wants. Also, happy birthday jc.
---
Why do people think Freddy isn't overpowered
---
I upvoted and it turned the number to 69. I win peasants
---
What if they added a way to kill the killers or atleat temporarily like put them down like we kill them and then at the end there will be a cutscene of them rising back up and coming back to kill you
---
It does change balance wise. Before you had to kinda guess if she was vaulting a window.
---
I mean, I did it
---
Eu4? My man

As a legion main I must say....

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

how is this not on top of the main page? nothing extra charge gives extra charges on medkits and toolboxes.

They should have given her the Demogorgon‚Äôs vaulting animation. Have it look like she‚Äôs coming out a TV like in The Ring.

---
Still pipped lol
---
Probably the only problem would be right now is the frequency of Blood Orbs being dropped from players. If you tend to stand still and heal or do gens. Both are crucial thing and you need to stop the bleeding before Oni takes a huge advantage of your positions and suck up from 30%-50% and already be done by he time he chases you. I don't mind giving blood orbs from downed Survivors IF it drops only one pint at a time.
---
If I'd take the shot I believe Oni's blood sucking idea is from the Plague? If it was the opposite of normal vomit. (But you know, no fountains to cleanse instead)
---
Issue there: that's a game mechanic, remember in lore the killers remain on their maps, meaning Huntress would only be found in the Red Forest locations meaning hatchets would only appear in lockers there.
---
It'd probably take a LOT of frankly unnecessary coding to make hatchets only spawn in the lockers if the Huntress is in the map, so they just leave the hatchets there for game purposes. 
---
So, against Huntress they definitely could try to gang up on her using the hatchets. But remember how skilled she is: she's wiped out towns by herself and took apart a German platoon.
---
Or small changes. Every perk now and then gets to be outdated when changes are implemented or new Killer  / Survivor is introduced with more perks to add. So yeah, I can agree.

Have you not seen the image of everyone with their sweaters that was posted like 10 times
---
Also rather than release incremental balance changes they let the game die for nearly a year without adding obvious improvements that they finally added anyway.
---
They could do it like Tekken 7 where every character has a separate rank and whenever you reach a certain rank, for example, rank 16, all killers go from rank 20 to rank 19 even if you don't play them.
---
There‚Äôs not a lot of people saying that mate, it would be a good power if done properly. It would be weak against SWFs, yes, but most killers are weak purely because of the communication aspect which takes away half of what it means to play DBD. That‚Äôs just your personal opinion
---
Step on my legs susie-kun uwu rawr X 3
---
Is that still an issue? I mean there‚Äôs loading text that says who you‚Äôre facing occasionally.
---
should just let legion repair gens at this rate
---
And when you open them, the survivor is gone. Great solution, bud
---
I don't agree nor disagree with that statement as it depends, is SB the best perk for getting a start definitely, is it great in a Chase obviously no, is it the best perk when you need to save a teammate yes. It just depends  on what you need and playstyle etc
---

Yellow one do things when you finish them e.g: in the temple underground it will open a gate
---
I feel like I need to define what I mean when I say natural. But oh well.
---
Eh, after thinking about it, it would need changes in how they calculate animations on slanted/uneven surfaces, unless you want a long killer that‚Äôs halfway in the stairs and halfway floating. The engine might not have that kinda functionality built in.
---
In her PTB she used to have the vault animation similar to the previous one but you would see her slowly phase through the window. They changed it for some reason.
---
Yeah this guy doesn‚Äôt have any trouble because she‚Äôs busy range 1 shoting all his teammates before they can get 10m from the hook. He gets the hatch every time, plague is ez.
---
This is 100% what people don‚Äôt realise. When you cleanse you‚Äôre not hurting yourself, you‚Äôre hurting your teammates. Plus you‚Äôll get sick again if you interact with teammates or the killer, so you are entirely useless. But you‚Äôll probably get ignored and may get the hatch...
---
its the best exhaust perk in chase if used properly
---
Lil baby wraith I LOVE IT
---
Isn't it not supposed to be activated in a chase?
---
Exactly
---
Window by the preschool.
---
You only get it when they are healthy, so you would never get your power as oni and you would just need an m1 killer
---
on second hook there is no hearthbeat for months now, its a bug for sure
---
If 99%, which actually works 1/5 times or you leave Gen and run with 99% to hunter just for "use SB properly"
---
you can activate it whenever you want, if you think about it.
---
the basic version of using SB to its fullest potential has you just 99%'ing it and using it whenever you want, so if you think about it its almost every exhaust perk on command. 
---
Its main strength over the rest though is the fact it can be used in dead zones
---
To be fair..I play on console so it's laggy..
---
To not be fair.. sometimes on the rare occasions it doesn't lag I still miss them..
---
Im very surprised how little people play him, i literally dont play anyone but him.
---
Ok boomer.
---
Pretty sure they're separated
---
Well shit better switch to SB that's actually pretty damn good point.
---
I mean that‚Äôs the power of a corrupt purge plague vs an infected survivor... hence why we don‚Äôt cleanse.
---
I would argue against that but I can definitely see where you're coming from. That good 3-4 second headstart you have on a killer can be the difference between making it to a window or pallet or taking a hit. The main reason it's so lackluster is that it's makes moving between objectives slower as you have to walk in order to not use it up or walk to end your Exhaustion . The only way to avoid that is to just edge it but that eventually doesn't work once you start healing or working on a gen.
---
There is already the Roblox DbD btw
---
If you cant 99% an exhaust timer then thats a personal problem. 
---
You can do a gen with sb active, you dont have to walk everywhere, you can use it to get to the next gen and then just lose exhaust in chase since it will be at least half way gone by then
---
I wanna meme like this but I don't have friends to do it with.
---
I have never played this game but did these madlads ready add on of their own Creepypasta OCs?
---
How did you get stuck in there?
---
Oh I know that but its just a lookalike
---
If you want i can teach you how to use it the best you can, it takes a bit of time to get used to and it also takes a fair bit of game knowledge and practice to get it down
---
I regret buying Myers cause i kinda got stuck on Legion
---
Just want to point out, the official Cult of Dwight wear was changed. It's the Pizza Hoodie, Pizza Beanie, and Watermelon pants now. r/The_Fairfield has this information.

Agreed. Somtimes you should get during a stun. Not everysingle gine it feels like

David is good looking with a beard. Without it he looks a bit off but with the beard he's pretty hot, especially with the body he has

No. It's THEM who would have to let you go
---
Meg looks rapey.....
---
Based off of how close the Feng was with a flashlight she was probably lying in wait for a flashlight save. She probably was paying too much attention to where you were and got caught out once you were already swinging. As for the other 3 games, idk.
---
When you stop, you activate it to ‚Äúwaste‚Äù it and let it recharge while you‚Äôre working on a gen or healing
---
Killer main here noed plus spirit equals fucking ochido fanboy's shit up

It's too bad the one game we shared, my internet took a dive. Suddenlink is the worst...

---
I've always wanted some kind of incentive system for ranking up
---
When you get close enough to swing against someone who has juked you, just stop for a second before swinging. You'll make them look stupid and they'll probably stop trying it. "Jukers" are actually alarmingly predictable.
---
Maybe adding a S1 / S2 / S3 at the bottom the charms to indicate what season you earned that reward in? To give it a bit of variety? But the rank would be on the current highest rank, not the highest overall. In hopes to stop some players from intentionally depipping. /shrug
---
Well that works out perfectly with my name.
---
I love Dwight's chase music. Poor legion :(
---
Oh I stopped using DH after dedicated servers made it feel like dog shit. Stopped using it for Balanced Landing.
---
Oh what fun I have trying to utilize perks in this game...
---
If you let go of shift while vaulting you lose exhaustion, it might not seem like a lot but it adds up quickly.
---
"you just run to other loop and you lucky if its not the same unsafe loop. And SB still dont give you invincible power, hunters still can hit you."
---
Which exhaust perk would let you live in that situation?
---
I hate when people do this. Hurry up and fucking leave so I can get a head start on my 10min queue time
---
THERE ARE DOZENS OF US! ***DOZENS!***

I think yellow gens are just gens for areas too short to accommodate the big pylon on top.

"My cousin works for Valve, enjoy your ban for killing me."
---
It's borrowed time. Whenever a survivor who has this unhooks another survivor, in the event that the killer attacks the just-rescued survivor, they won't go down immediately, but they'll have to mend themselves.

Lmfao

That's ridiculous.

Oh yea definitely just saying never by a survivor or killer because of their perks because well look at MoM
---
to be fair, I had similar matchmaking last night, 4s and a 5 vs a 9 killer and he got a 4k.
---
Not sure myself. Hit a survivor who was there and then I was stuck all of the sudden.
---
I think i played with you yesterday. We were the only last two left against a leatherface on rotten fields and we fucked ourselves with the gens lol, i was mechanic David. Not entirely sure it was you tho:p

I see those emojis on r/dbdgonegay more than I see them here

Yeah! Fuck people choosing to play where their friends are!

ooh yeah, the clown game? haha yeaah that game was laggy af but it was kinda fun tho.
---
I always use it as spirit. Normally I can get a Moro or 2 out of it. I feel like people don‚Äôt check the totems like they use to when it first came out. With that being said my load out of Spirit is DH, BBQ, BM, Nurses Calling. When I typed them all out I realized I really hate searching for Survivors.
---
well adding like a S1 / S2 on the charms could indicate the seasons you earned them in as well, so a little brag ya know :P But yeh there is NO reason to be in reds since you get nothing, i see so many ppl de pipping and playing in greens because they can, and it becomes very unbalanced. hopefully this will "encourage" ppl to stayin their ranks if they want their charms.
---
Seriously, introducing exactly zero new modes or meaningful changes to the game mechanics over the course of three years is embarrassing. There aren't any other games like this. Compare this to any other multiplayer game that's been active for this long and you'll find that all of them have more variety in gameplay than DBD apparently ever will.
---
There are multiple loops on several maps that you're either forced to Blood Lust 3 to get a hit, or leave the survivor alone.
---
There shouldn't be such a situation at all, it's insane.  
---
And that's not including the "god loops" like Iron Works where you can't Blood Lust because line of sight gets broken so easily for so long.  
---
The Badham rework has made that map so much healthier when it comes to looping, and that's with 2-3 pallets that the killer is forced to break because they close off pathways entirely and have zero alternative options.  
---
Suffocation Pit can spawn three LT walls right next to each other, and a smart survivor can turn that into an infinite loop, especially against killers that aren't Spirit/Nurse/Hag/Trapper.
---
Anyone know a good clown build?
---
New survivor: Wilson
---
New Killer: Charlie
---
A full swf of no mither with toolboxes and perks with synergi around no mither would be miserable for the killer. You say playing against only injured survivors is easy, but Plague says otherwise.
---
Not to mention, if there's a killer you can pull 4 No Mithers off vs, it 100% would be the version of Oni that gets no blood from No Mither injuries. His power will not passively recharge past 99%, meaning the only time he ever gets access to his power is from the 2 orbs that spawn when you hook someone AFTER waiting it to charge all the way to 99%, meaning even if you put good pressure on, you'll at most get his power twice before either everyone is dead or the gens get done.
---
Which means he's stuck as an m1 killer with no power for the majority of the game. Not only that, he's the worst m1 killer in the game when he's in his normal form. He's huge and easy to see over every loop, and the few loops tall enough to block him his loud ass footsteps make even red glow mindgames not work as well as other killers. Only being one hit down vs Oni really isn't that big of a deal because it's so much harder to get an m1 hit as Oni than any other killer.
---
You‚Äôre right there‚Äôs a difference, and full immersion is bad.  The issue on this sub is often times someone says ‚Äúhey try stealth in X situation‚Äù and get the reply ‚Äúimmersion is trash noob strat gtfo.‚Äù
---
The ideal gameplay is a mix of stealth to get objectives done and looping when you do get caught.  If you‚Äôre bad at looping/extending chases, you‚Äôre not going to do well.  If you‚Äôre bad at focusing objectives, you‚Äôre not going to do well.  If you‚Äôre bad at staying undetected when you need to be, you‚Äôre not going to do well.  It‚Äôs that simple.
---
Stream snipers would abuse it, and Plague would like a word with you.
---
it should be a trapper add on
---
all traps are now legos. insta mori, even for the trapper himself
---
If you use dead hard and get hit because dead hard is ‚Äùbroken‚Äù you‚Äôre not using it correctly. The most efficient way to use dead hard and the ‚Äùcorrect way‚Äù is to use it to make distance on the killer so you can make it to the the pallet or the window. You don‚Äôt use dead hard just when the killer is about swing you use it before he can even hit you.
---
I haven't had it happen as Oni but I've done it to him a few times. It's getting pretty regular at red ranks in my region for Onis to not really get their power up for at least 2 gens. I'm still rank 8 killer or so this season cause I've been focusing on survivor so I can't really judge based on the survivors I've been getting with him because most have been pretty easy 4ks.
---
It's not really about the shark itself. The movie is iconic, so even if you look at Jaws himself and don't see anything too impressive in isolation, the fact that it's tied to such a popular movie is reason enough for people to want to see it.
---
Or you get a charm of the survivor that you played most of at the end of the season.
---
Thats alright! use the perk that works for you, if you are having fun with lithe then lithe is the perk you should run

That was my first game of the day after work, and it ended up being my last game of the day. After you messaged me about how bad the game was, and after another person message me to tell me how bad the game and threatened to report me, I looked at my upload and download and the upload wasn't even one megabyte. It was disgusting. I had even messaged that Dwight in the middle of the game because I thought he was the one having internet problems lol he was not running from me and it look like he was walking into a wall and that's why I had dropped him and left him in the middle of the room because I was showing Mercy if I couldn't properly take care of him if it's internet was being shity. Turned out it was my internet but everything was running smoothly on my side lol
---
I kept checking to see if I can get back online because I wanted to play, I'm trying to reach level 70 before the rift closes. I just ended up playing solo games for the rest of the evening

Not enough to regularly consider her the top killer. I've come across good Nurses and escaped. If she can 4k, it isn't as significant as it is on PC. The only time a Nurse was threatening was when she had Infectious Fright. Still lived tho
---
i tried her for the first time yesterday and only managed to cage 2 of the survivors. One got it off the others head blew up. I re caged the second one. But i was having the hardest time finding the other 2.  I main a Doctor and have gotten used to the sounds of screams and hallucinations from the survivors.

I always forget that the demogorgon is in fortnite.

   Can‚Äôt wait for the survivors to take the L or floss on me

Imagine the bugs and problems we have with dead by daylight. And how every time we're told something is going to be fixed, other things go worse and it seems like nothing was actually fixed. That is ironically very close to having Suddenlink as an internet provider LOL

LEGO killer would be hilarious. LEGO gens, boxes, studs instead of blood, there‚Äôs so much potential
---
I've actually had an idea to make it better. You start the game off at full health but then your downed you have the chance to pick yourself up if you successfully pick yourself up then you cant heal or be healed for the next 100/80/60 seconds.
---
i mean i main kate so im down, only collecting kate charms xD However, how would they be able to determine that ya know? tracking what survivor we play?
---
Then again, the map has the same issue that makes Resting Place one of the most killer-favoured maps, namely that the map is split into two halves separated by a "choke point" in the middle. This allows for an easy control of gen clusters and hooks, by controlling that middle choke point. And as opposed to Resting Place, Sanctum's choke point consists not of T/L-walls, 4-walls, bracket and gym tiles, but of a pyramid structure that not only has very little chase value (especially with Balanced Landing having been nerfed) and only spawns 2-3 ridiculously unsafe pallets, but also functions as a watchtower for the killer to make controlling one half of the map even more easy.

Ah alright, perhaps I wasn't clear enough. I think a lot of what makes the killers interesting, particularly for a supposed horror game as this, is how different and twisted they are.
---
I feel Legion is the weakest in this aspect, as they are plenty of antisocial and edgy teenagers in real life, and there are bound to be some that are capable of doing much worse than just killing a random janitor.
---
Yea, thats why i was confused in bill main
---
No it affects nothing, BeHaviour doesn't ban for this bs. And i'm also on console and here BeHaviour doesn't care
---
Sounds like a really bad idea that only promotes more BM. Plus the whole ‚Äúkill the bad guy‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really fit in this games lore because none of the killers have ever been meant to die and the Entity doesn‚Äôt exactly swing that way.
---
Nooooooooo, I for one love the crease marks on the survivor faces, same with Quentin, they ARE beautiful but being in an endless hell causes a lot of stress and strain and it‚Äôs taken a toll on their appearance, just like how meg‚Äôs hands are incredibly dirty their face has also suffered with these marks. I feel that it makes the survivors more sincere since they aren‚Äôt in pristine condition. That‚Äôs just my opinion of course, but the slightly crustiness of the survivors holds a lot of appeal to me.
---
No way a bill did all that
---
Maybe he is wearing one with a jumpsuit and he's normally a tabby?
---
Red ranks are already chock-full of painfully subpar survivors, to an extent where competent-and-above killers already win the vast majority of their matches there with relative ease, and with the new rank logic, there will only be more and more worse and worse players piling up there. Give it a month or two and your average red rank games will be indistinguishable from green rank games.

Is this a gonewild meme I'm too christian to understand
---
If you're running solo survivor, run Kindred. I would rank it up near Decisive and Dead Hard as far as solo surv perks go. Randoms usually just assume somebody else will come and get you and just keep doing what they're doing. Also, after the buff it recently received it prevents you from doing the same. As it now let's you see everyone else once someone else is hooked. If you're playing solo survivor pick it up, it's easily A+.
---
Imagine having a useless power cant imagine
---
Piggy gang
---
Happened a lot to me yesterday, kept getting the most selfish teamates so I just got off. Like the survivor with borrowed time heals, then points at me, and proceeds to leave. (The killer did not have no Ed)
---
Well I feel that it‚Äôs a little bit presumptuous to ask someone to change their face, you might hurt Quentin‚Äôs feelings talking like that, sleep deprivation is no joke after all! Haha, still you‚Äôre right maybe they could make some adjustments, but I‚Äôm assuming the nightmare on elm street license still needs time to settle, considering that it‚Äôs still not on the switch BHVR must not be in a position to make those kinds of changes right now. It must be complicated since Wes Craven had nothing to do with Quentin.
---
I could do but don't want to use a perk slot for something that just requires common sense.
---
One was being chased which should have been obvious to them and instead of keeping an eye on my bleed out bar and coming for me, one decided to heal the other first.
---
That wld be pretty funny if other killers step into trapper traps, but it doesn't matter cuz as a trapper main I still step into my own traps hahahahha
---
DbD? Fun? INCOMPREHENSIBLE. (j/k I meme with my survivors 95% of my games).
---
I thought Myers hated Spinechill.
---
Well duh, she's the entity.
---
For that you have to maintain a constant sprint. You are tiptoeing way to much around the perk for it to be the most useful. Especially when lithe destroys it, because there are windows everywhere that you can jump through 'on command'. Also dead hard is on command, but obviously you don't get the boost.
---
Not gonna get into balanced landing just yet. It definitely used to be the best.
---
Take my money now!
---
It's all of the above. It just compounds to be this all around obnoxious experience.
---
there is no common sense when you are playing with randoms, sadly.
---
You can make Dying Light affect more than 3 people.  Just change the obsession mid-game.
---
Steam reviews:
---
"new killer op ruins the game"
---
"new killer too weak cant do shit with him"
---
But this would be a sick gamemode though. Survivor with Killer skins WHEN!?
---
I already use bond though so I don't want to run both really. I have spine chill, ds and exhaustion perk in my other slot. I know kindred got a buff but still feels like red rank team mates should be able to make good decisions. It was obvious the killer was chasing the other survivor but they chose to heal instead of get me.
---
Yeah, the point here is not exactly beauty, it's that they mess up with their models in some weird ways. I hope someday they can optimize the game well enough to do a major graphocs overhaul and even allow 4k resolutions and higher framerates.
---
Seems like BHVR to me.
---
Haha yeah agreed :D
---
You can lose exhaust in a chase with any exhaustion perks
---
Apparently a joke was too much. I mean, what now?
---
hahaha I hope so
---
What is that from
---
They give power to light up a building lights or street light.
---
The more you know!
---
thats also good thanatophobia is also one to
---
RBTs dont really slow the game down for me as killer so I just save them for endgame so remaining survivors cant leave right away 
---
its actually been a pretty solid change for me  
---
tunneling pigs completely waste the hat
---
Use Spine Chill, great perk to know if you're being watched by a stealth killer
---
Alternatively, consider Vanity Mirror, Scratched Mirror's underappreciated sibling that can be used on more open maps as well.
---
To be fair, Scratched Mirror can actually be reasonably strong if used correctly on the right maps, Vanity Mirror is more-so a gimmick that doesn't work out nearly as consistently. But paired up with Play With Your Food (and now Nemesis) it can be used to quite good effect, using the wallhacks to find survivors, protect hooks and hexes, and most of all to try and outplay survivors in chases.
---
3 months is way too long, I saw your comments on overwatch and other games. However DBD has a limited ranking system unlike overwatch etc. An SR system where you can keep gaining would be good. E.g a DBD leaderboard in game where top1% of players get a reward then top 10/25/50/75/100. As an example, could be different intervals. Obviously higher up more the reward. So it keeps track of your pip loss and gain, so after you reach rank 1 you can keep gaining pips to exceed and perform higher on the leaderboard. This can link in with matchmaking as you get more skilled games, as the ranked mode we have isn‚Äôt competitive as in overwatch or siege. It‚Äôs still casual
---
Probably because they don't feel like mending
---
A graphic nov adaptation of a book series called ‚Äúwings of fire‚Äù. The main characters are dragons, you really got to check it out
---
Nah I‚Äôm on console so wasn‚Äôt able to unfortunately.
---
Just buy the cheap shit and only go for perks that‚Äôs what I do
---
You act as if she had any character in her face in-game.
---
This just goes to show that you dont have to draw in 2160 p and ultra HD to draw something good. Well done sir
---
No wonder people in society have fake goals and are insecure or their looks. People are scared of expression, BHVR did a great job of expression and flaws, literally all this is just meg with 1 yr old baby flawless skin.
---
Thanks for the feedback! Made some adjustments.
---
ITS NOT DELIVERY, BITCH
---
ALWAYS go for the save!
---
Im saying its the best bc it has its own strengths AND it does basically what every exhaust perk does
---
The last time i can remember doing anything that toxic was stabbing the last player on the hook or maybe shaking my head after people fail miserably
---
I want daddy Myers to stab my ass with his big knife.
---
Treat as a regular M1 killer and use a meta build. 
---
If you're someone who typically doesn't juggle people then go with:
---
Enduring, Spirit pallet perk ( forgot name atm ), Ruin, Perk of your choice here can be nurses, pop, bbq, pretty much anything.
---
Addons I typically go for extra trap + extra trap box to waste survivor's time as much as possible.
---
\ &lt;3 &gt;w&lt; ty!
---
Thx!
---
IMAGINE ACTUAL HALLOWEEN COSTUMES FOR OUR SURVIVORS
---
"lithe destroys it"
---
with SB you can vault a window 3 times and then use it to get to the next loop. You dont have to 99% it, i often times 97% it so i can vault a window a few times and use it whenever. Its once again, lithe on command.
---
Love it.
---
I like seeing Bill as the old, wise man of the survivors
---
Glad to hear that .
---
Eh, fair enough. It really doesn't help that video games and movies really accentuate the idea that everybody should look like a model and they can have no flaws. Dead by Daylight actually does a pretty decent job as far as body and facial representation goes and it does help to remind you that not everybody in the world looks like a supermodel.
---
If you dont know how to use the perk properly, then sure you will be walking around the map. But thats not how you use it.
---
I want huncback billy back &gt;:C
---
That's not an outright fact.
---
If you're skilled as killer you can get there quicker. It also depends on the context. I.e if you've applied zero pressure up to that point
---
People don't really get more than two laps against me when I'm killer there.
---
I mean you were camping basement by looks of it, Kate was still on stairs, ash had endurance from BT, Kate was out positioned, feng was the only bot in this clip.
---
I think the game thinks you didn't finish the tutorial
---
But meg is perfect? She always has been.
---
i mean, its literally just better, why would anyone prefer a worse version of a perk that you also have to spend BP on
---
Legion is pretty fun to play as tbh. Oni is a bit harder to get the hang of on console but he gets great results one you get it. 
---
I still like playing as Legion better.
---
Sprint burst
---
Thanks very cool
---
Where i can finish the tutorial? :(
---
That pun was laid to rest already, please let it go.
---
Imagine not being able to see survivors on half the maps because your power nerfs you
---
I do too my friend. The supposed "crooked" Hillbilly standing upright is just wrong.
---
Yea i did that for a while 2, i highly suggest running perks you use perks you enjoy before you start using the best perks, if you cant win without the best perks, you are not that great. its very good practice
---
Both of those Hag sets are dogshit. Mint Rag adn Shackles are garbage for literally anything but camping hooks. 
---
Ataxic Isn't as good as Heavy Panting on Nurse.
---
Not overpowered but pretty well balanced.
---
His kit is just solid right now and he isn't hard to play.
---
If anyone is overpowered right now it's definitely Oni and ghostface with certain builds.
---
Why can't survivors have 1 really good loop on a map?
---
I don't think killers understand that a huge portion of pallets are unsafe and outplayable unless the killer majorly fucks up.
---
I get that you guys want to turn the map into one that's easy for killers to get wins on when it might be one of the harder ones, but you have to be less obvious about it. Replacing that window with a pallet is ridiculous.
---
I would agree that some of the maps are so dark that I have a hard time seeing, even on max brightness for my monitor. I haven't been playing long enough to know if it's survivor or killer advantage (started 2 weeks ago and got to rank 7 survivor), but if there's one thing that bothers me, it's the basement is super central and a lot of the killers at my level end up just camping it, which is just no fun for anyone.
---
Ther must be some starter ritual. Its in the patch notes
---
While her backstory is very similar to that of a Wendigo's , there are a few key differences.
---
First off, she's African. The Wendigo is a Native American legend. Second, Wendigos live in cold places and are often associated with winter, the opposite of the swamp. Third, Wendigos transform after they eat someone for the first time. The Hag got her powers before she ate the other canmibals, which is how she escaped in the first place.
---
However, they are both very similar. Both the deformations and hunger for human flesh are the same. Its kind of like the difference between ogres and onis. They're extremely similar, but not exactly the same as they are from different regions in the world.
---
There should a starter tutorial
---
My main build I like to run is Borrowed Time, WGLF, Decisive Strike, and an exchangeable 4th perk depending on how I'm feeling. I usually run Deliverance since it pairs nicely with BT since it guarantees a safe unhook which also guarantees a WGLF stack.
---
None. I never buy anything for perks or strenght, I knew Ash perks were getting nerfed, anyone who thought MoM would be left untouched or that Legion was healthy deserved to lose their money IMO.
---
Just walks through the wall I mean she is a ghost
---
This never gets old doesnt it
---
The point is your gameplay has to work around the one time you want to use it. Sometimes that involves walking and sometimes that involves sprinting. Either way it is not ideal.
---
I mean, that‚Äôs true but stream snipers will always be unfair since they, you know, stream snipe. They know what perks to choose to counter the killer and where to hide from the killer. Like I said, you are still an insta-down do you wouldn‚Äòt necessarily need your power (it does suck when you can‚Äòt use the killers power but so does using a perk that literally brings nothing but negatives into your gameplay lmao).
---
My current main build is:
---
Resilience, SB, BT, and DS. 
---
It works very well with my build, people are going to disagree, but resilience is a better version of adrenaline. you just 99% heal yourself and you do everything faster including vaulting, so you can just heal yourself whenever you know they killer is going to hit you
---
I am extremely alarmed at how much just the beret and cigarette make him look like Bill.
---
Very cute
---
I figured that‚Äôs what they were doing but I had NOED (I know, crutch perk blah blah) and even after downing the Claudette she still waited. Idk I‚Äôm not a pro with this game so I‚Äôm probs looking at the situation super wrong lol
---
Lithe is on command, and the purpose is to lose the killer, not extend the chase. But if it is an extended chase you want then you can Lithe, then just vault twice normally. Either way SB gives you nothing extra.
---
Unlike BL which gives you more variety of options.
---
What about all the pallets that are unsafe now?
---
Except for those 3 pallets you mentioned, the rest are basically outplayable from the killer side. It's ridiculous the amount of pallets killers can just leave down and ignore because of how useless they are.
---
Well I got bumrushed by all 3 after I had Ash down there. I was carrying the Kate, Feng tried to blind me, and Ash got saved all at once. Then the clip happened.
---
I can't wait for them to do something with him. I know they're currently looking at the doctor but he definitely needs some quality of life changes at some point.
---
Borrowed time
---
Of course, they need to run small game or not complain :) /s
---
So you are saying it has its own strengths...
---
Being able to do what all other exhaustion perks can do, when comparing it with other exhaustion perks, really doesn't add anything to your argument.
---
 I still can't agree with you dude, and I have tried all the exhaustion perks thoroughly. Been playing for a long time.
---
Also need I mention the whole building is basically a trappers wet dream? Basement is there, the bottom parts of the door frame completely covers the trap and if they the darker traps add-on they will be unseeable

It‚Äôs a new page in the ritual screen, it opens automatically, as opposed to the daily rituals.
---
I'm really happy to see Resilience starting to climb up the tier ladder now that people realize how good that 9% benefit really is. Plus, like you mentioned, you can just 99 heal and just take a second to finish it off once the killer comes. It also works wonderfully against killers with instadowns  like Bubba, Billy, Oni, etc.
---
I wasn't offended by your joke at all, my fellow dbd gamer, but I guess the other fellows didn't like it
---
Yea smh so toxic they should just learn how to counter very fair traps
---
Im a Legion main
---
This clearly means legion needs to be nerfed again
---
The only way this window is even semi abusable (and even then it isn't that bad) is if the survivor is sitting there and always at the farthest point in the loop from you as you approach it.
---
A situation where you're actively chasing someone, they hit the window and loop for bloodlust 3 isn't going to happen unless you massively fuck up as killer.
---
Shrug
---
If she would close her mouth you could see that someone really made an effort to make her look beautiful and then someone said just give her an terrified expression and ship it
---
Imagine arguing about what killer is the best just to prove a point... please, can we just stap and agree that Susie is the best Waifu
---
pretty sure she's a child sooooo...careful what you post lol
---
Ive had this happen when i was like at 99% so that noed instant blew up xd
---
For real I had someone post a salty comment on my profile every 10 minutes (I didn't delete them), this went on for 3 hours, was really fun to read tbh.
---
He deleted them the next day I go to check my profile. I mean, I get the fact that you can get salty if you get tunneled/slugged all game and you can't do anything about it, just leave a salty comment if you are THAT insecure and mad, but come on, dude. 10 damn comments with different phrasings, clearly written by his hand. That just shows how desperate you can be for attention. No one cares about your rambling, just go on and turn your PC off, because venting like that won't get you anywhere. At that point, you might aswell go and check yourself for anger problems, make sure that you won't pop a vein in your forehead from such sweat.
---
Stopped deleting comments ages ago, it's cool to keep them there, then after a while (a few months), add them to friends, talk to them for a while, play a few matches, only after a couple of days tell them that they actually hated you and told you to die (check comments for proof)
---
This game changes people, man. And not in a good way.
---
so you are saying lithe is better bc you can lose the killer? why cant you do that with SB? 
---
Most of the time you cant slow vault a window 2 times in chase. And even if you do, you are prob wasting your vaults in the first place, so by default you are just giving an easier chase to a killer. At that point why not just fast vault with SB?
---
BL lost what made it amazing, sure its still good, but thats bc its an exhaust perk. Lithe is better then BL now
---
Cant wait when does the cosmetics drop
---
agreed
---
Hell yeah i'll take a wall hack and one shot for the whole duration of the game, that's awesome
---
Please reddit keep it up with the "don't ever cleanse" shit, i love it
---
As much as I hate to say it you're going to have to get the angsty teenagers. They're much more easier to play at the moment on Console then the Oni. Plus the only has a few balancing issues
---
Hey what IOS does this need? I searched it on the App Store but it won‚Äôt come up.
---
Oh yea its still very painful as trapper but the main building is basically a death sentence if he gets a basement hook hides his traps in the door frames and windows maybe?
---
Capcom is doing their own spin on the 4v1 multiplayer concept, highly unlikely they would team up with behaviour
---
Because all other exhaustion perks can do it.
---
The point you were making was that you can lose exhaust in a chase. You can do that with all of the perks you are comparing it to. That is not a reason why it is better. Similarly it is not a reason why it is worse.
---
I understand the benefit of using it mid chase at the right moment from a perfectly timed 99% bar, but it still really isn't worth it IMO. You are planning a lot just to get the same benefit as lithe. Sure what you are doing takes skill, but it is unnecessarily making the game harder for you.
---
Nah, she flamed me afterwards
---
Can they seriously remodel Claudette?? Nobody even looks like that... Her and Nea are the ugliest characters in the whole damn game (killers included).
---
Ignoring abilities that more or less reward you for respecting pallets/punish you if you don't, in general chase play it is possible to respect a pallet just enough to avoid getting stunned while not giving the survivor enough time to make it around the loop another time either. The stun duration is only 2 seconds, but saving that time can be crucial in chases.
---
That said, good survivors will definitely abuse pallet respect, and even against killers that know how to respect pallets "just enough", they can get a few seconds more time out of pallets due to that respect, or yet force pallet stuns by using various techniques. And a good survivor will get a lot of use of any extra seconds in a chase. Enduring is still one of the best chase perks for that reason.
---
It definitely needed changing but they hit it entirely too hard.
---
You are aware they dc anyway and we're trying to get our bbq stack/give you a free unhook, right?
---
Obviously I was exaggerating but all the statues on the map certainly don't make it easy.
---
If they afk they gonna be hooked.
---
Are you good there‚Äôs no reason they can‚Äôt move yet unless they are afk? And if so it‚Äôs their own fault literally
---
Same its been about a year since i played. I stopped when Doomfist came out.. so yeh it's probably changed since then xD
---
Yeaaaa, survivors have so much shit still going on for them it's crazy
---
his body at the end good lord
---
what about lining it up with the rift pass? 2 months? new rift, new season?
---
I got no coins but here is a mental gold award
---
It's only useful if the other players actually give a shit. I can't count how many times I'm on a hook and I know everyone sees what's going on, but continue to work gens or fuck off on the other side of the map.
---
I wish there was a system where after a survivors hook progress finishes the killer has to go manually go back, pull them off the hook ( or have the hook break),and kill the survivor by hand. I know it would have balancing issues but it would go really well with your idea
---
Tunneling isnt a good idea with DS the way it is. I mean hard tunneling, as in chasing the person off the hook. Its mainly done by low rank killers because they have more time to do this as low rank survivors are shit on gens. Its also a bad habit inexperienced killers still rely on once they find themself in high rank due to how easy it is to rank up. Tunnel &amp; NOED is often the strategy.
---
Slugging is very strong. Best on certain killers. I dont mind slugging as a tactic. Its only boring endgame when you‚Äôre left on the ground forever as the killer goes to hunt the claudette hiding in bushes who is waiting for the hatch. Thats because pips sometimes depend on the 4k.
---
I actually regret buying the new killer because even though I play this game on PC and console I primarily played this game on console. He's not very good with the sensitivity not to mention that I've learned that it doesn't matter how mini insta Downs you can pretty much land if you're going against a survive with Friends team it won't really matter
---
Is this an otz reaction vid?
---
I dont think I'll ever take off Jeff's sweater.
---
You played since Starnger Things?? Me too! (If you do) and I am currently rank 4
---
Yeah there is actually. Fortunately turbo genius here can bring the light of knowledge into your life and inform you that sometimes survivors get into the start of the game slower for various reasons so everyone else has started but they are still in the phase where the camera is circling in 3rd person with the name of the map
---
Not important, no one cares, barely anyone agrees
---
I believe yes!
---
oh yeh you'd get rewarded regardless of the rank you earned. you just get more the higher you go.
---
The only free one is bill
---
I ain't stealing fun from myself if it means free points from smacking them and hey got a kill early on which is neat because my objective is almost done
---
Incorrect
---
But accomplishing the goal of the game... to kill survivors.
---
It is already unlocked, just tap the rituals button on the main menu, you'll notice the hillbilly and Claudette as rewards, if you have already completed a trial as survivor you can tap the glowing button to unlock Claudette again.
---
"You don't know what you're talking about"
---
"Freddy can be looped like any killer"
---
To be honest that would be an interesting idea. Two killers on a mission to see who can hook the most before the match is over. However due to the excess of survivors. It's probably going to be hell for both. Not to mention do you have to understand that survivors can be toxic and Petty so don't expect to be the ones in charge
---
Idk who was who, Im talking about the person that was laying down as the base. Do I have to upload the whole thing?
---
I think No Mither should have you leave 25% / 50% less blood for the Oni. Kinda like how Small Game increases your chance by 25% to escape Trapper's traps
---
Lmao. I used to hate Pig so much for this reason.
---
mmm that is true... i feel getting a ranking charm every month would be to often as well though. like obviously this is just suggestions but i would def love for dbd to incorporate some form of reward system though :) i love the sense of achievement and goals to aim for, that's just the kinda person i am.
---
Oof I'm a console player and have been enjoying the Oni immensely, sad you don't enjoy it hey you win some you lose some that's why it's best to get them after a week or so to see what people say
---
OMG i see it thank you so muchhhh
---
so close, thank you none the less kind stranger!
---
My bad It wasn't the Kate it was the purple haired girl. Honestly I couldn't keep track of all of them being there at once
---
Hey, if you're one of the people who give hits like this to killers, just stop. 
---
I mean no offense, and I know you're trying to be nice, I'm not insulting you but, killer mains hate that even if there is no BM involved. 
---
We would prefer if you'd left, queue times in high ranks are nightmares and we just want to jump right on another game. 
---
Sometimes seeing survivors give hits or BM at exit gates is more tilting than the rest of the match.
---
What's wrong with Claudette? She looks pretty normal to me.
---
Please tell me this is becoming a weekly series? I need at LEAST 1 episode a week
---
I agree however im not talking about the viability of these strategies. Its more of an explanation of why killers employ them. That the pressure generated by survivors can be overwhelming and cause the killer to feel the need to play lame.
---
Not quite. The outfit is nearly identical, but there are some differences. The movie outfit:
---
Has a wider hood, generally has a sparkly appearance, isn't tied around the waste, doesn't have spikey cuffs and doesn't split at the legs.
---
What we've recieved is the Fun World costume.
---
Honestly kindred should just be base kit. at least the old version
---
Good thing I‚Äôm a legion main
---
Absolutely not. She's hideous. I have never met a Black woman that actually looks like that. She's needs to be redone pronto.
---
Crows flying off and landing and the timing of it can tell a killer quite a bit about survivor movements. As can crows that are not disturbed. They are definitely a useful game mechanic, and they can also warn survivors of a stealthy killer's approach.
---
Good sir I am playing the game at rank 5 and I constantly cannot stand going against Survivor friends with a killer this loud and with a hitbox so small. Playing him in low ranks of course I'm going to smash people but the higher I go the more resistance I face and the more hope seems absolutely lost... seriously I believe I lost roughly five games in a row before I just said screw this I'm going to go back to playing Jedi Fallen order
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Micheal never killed a single cat even tho he saw a few?
---
Claudette is beautiful. Fight me.
---
hawkins and the game. i don't know what's wrong with me but i get lost every time
---
Yes way a Bill did all that
---
I‚Äôve messed about before with slippery meat, Ace‚Äôs perk to increase luck, and myself and a friend brought the purple luck offerings.
---
Its a free deliverance every time.
---
aha ggs gottem
---
the game map should also have the beginning's theme as a jingle, similar to haddonfield
---
Yeah, I'm glad Joey isn't 1080 cells only now, this let's people be him for cheaper
---
Yea but when they just dive into the nearest locker right in ur face you cant say that its not annoying and you wish you could kill em for that
---
&gt; You can use them defensively as well
---
I guess? But they really are for ending loops and chases quickly. All they do "defensively" is tell you if someone is by a totem or hook
---
&gt; Plus his Snares are useless if the survivor is awake.
---
As I said, they are for ending loops quickly, and the survivor should be asleep by that point. There's no reason to not have hit them yet.
---
&gt; and Hag's are meant to be placed during loops to cut them off by quick teleporting
---
not unless you have speed add-ons
---
In my case the timing was totally random. I think I bought it dirty cheap somewhere just to give it a go and 2 days later I bought all the DLCs on steam :D
---
Any advice on the Spine Chill challenge?
---
I honestly feel like Sloppy Butcher (along with the Begrimed Chains effect of slower gen speed) could be interesting for Feral Frenzy. The effect could go away when you heal yourself to incentivize healing against Legion, but after having a match yesterday against a bunch of chucklefucks who'd constantly Self Care against Legion I can see the problem with Legion being able to injure people too easily.
---
They need a lot of work, or Deep Wounds needs a lot of work, but regardless something needs work.
---
Lmao imagine thinking the new Legion changes are an overall nerf.
---
Did it to buff Borrowed Time because BT needed more buffs lol
---
Its a video game, regardless of the intended goal do you not play to have fun or excitement or satistfaction or something similar?
---
I mean if you get those things from punching bag simulators then by all means go ahead and play one of those but DBD is a multiplayer experience with other people to take into consideration (if you aren't a thunderous cunt that is)
---
So, like a less useful unbreakable? (I think that‚Äôs Bills perk right lol?)
---
I never get tired of survivors who tbag me in a loop and then hit me with the surprised pikachu face when I "tunnel" them to death. I'm sitting here like, I thought that's what you wanted?
---
Wow, why is Yui's so cheap?
---
Finally, i have them all.
---
I started off as a Hag main and then I drifted into the survivor side with Claudette. Hag was easy for me to learn and Claudette had self-care and I was solo queueing. 
---
Now I don‚Äôt really main anyone on the survivor side. I like to play each character lore-friendly. (Claudette is a healer, Steve goes for the saves, Jake is my sabo guy)
---
But for killer I mostly play Spirit and Michael. I play spirit bc when I play killer now, its for the Archives, a Daily Challenge, or I need to let off some steam. She‚Äôs my best killer and its easy to grind Bloodpoints. I use Michael bc the jumpscares in tier one are hilarious. Other than that I jump around from killer to killer as well, bubba is my most recent favorite.
---
Borrowed Time is BT, short for Borrowed Time.
---
If you‚Äôre killer, I highly doubt you‚Äôre concerned for the survivor‚Äôs experience they have while playing the game.
---
I will never abandon Susie, even if they make legion Bubba-tier
---
Haha same happened to me, I bought the game around a year ago and a week after my first day playing I had already bought almost every DLC I could
---
*laughs in bubba*
---
I hate ds. I hook a meg. then chase down a claudette meanwhile meg gets saved. I go away looking for other survivor meg is fully healed again and randomly appears in front of me i manage to down her quick. Literally last second of ds hits me. Ds should be able to work if i hook someone else after after the meg got a save rescue. Ds shouldnt be a punishment for fairplay only because you doing well
---
Yeah. The Smasher i believe was the name.
---
Coolio
---
Probably because of the rarity?
---
The new survivor is Ned Flanders
---
Stop telling people, I‚Äôm sick of having to deal with SB every other killer game already lmao. It doesn‚Äôt need to become any more popular.
---
Doesnt matter if you can stay in a choke point if you cant catch anyone. At least on ps4 the map is a slide show leaving you guessing because they can go in any direction.
---
oooo nelly
---
If you mean by attempt escape only then that‚Äôs still pretty bad.
---
I did that a few times, there was a time I used both depending on the situation before I decided to switch perks around
---
Nah, complete character erasure, 100%%%%.
---
Megs face model was a completely complex character, who I could FEEL when she was scared. I related to her SO much. Seeing that static face constantly, with her face never changing, was the only joy in life I had. 
---
Now that they might change it though, it feels like she a very different person. Im definitely going to delete this game now!!!
---
Survivors don't fight back for the same reason killers need to use an offering to actually kill them: this is the entity's game, not theirs. Tombstone Myers represents him being hard to control, and the Rancor perk is a covenant of rage between the entity and the spirit. If you want to fight the killer, there are three other games you can play. This just isn't one of them.
---
Thanks for quickly fixing that bug it was horrible you would travel into space int the basement
---
I didnt DC I failed at pulling myself off the hook and didnt struggle
---
Not the pad, I already had one, but the headphones I did
---
On ps4 is pitch black and gets like 10fps.
---
I mean, it counters, like, 2 perks and some offerings, and even those, in the rare occasion that you get a basement hook, so, I would say it would be a welcome change, but if that is your opinion, I respect it.
---
these are truly terrible, yikes $60...
---
&gt; It's only useful if the other players actually give a shit
---
nah, it also gives you, personally, map wide info on the other players if anyone else is hooked.
---
I hit rank 12 and it got incredibly harder to play killer for me I‚Äôll get only 1-2 sacrifices and I‚Äôd get looped easily is this normal or did I go to high in rank by going against bad survivors
---
Killer on dark maps: Have you seen a little girl named Claudette?
---
Yikers
---
P3 face isn't worth it
---
I'm not saying it is worse because it is harder to use. I am saying it is worse because you do have to spend a lot of time managing it for very little benefit.
---
In order for your plan to work you have to either enter a chase at the optimal time, walk slowly round the map, or spend the whole chase attempting to recover your exhaustion.
---
I'm sorry but this just isn't how games work. You have to be prepared for more situations than just one. Your tactic is useful if you want to spend the whole game as 'the runner', but I think for anyone who is looking for the full 32K, it becomes more of a hindrance than a benefit. Especially when you can get the same benefits from other exhaustion perks.
---
Oh so that's what the meme was about devs being afraid of making animations. I get it now. Recycling assets smh
---
Whispers is useful on Trapper for avoiding survivors, the opposite of how any other killer would use it. It lets you know that nobody is watching you set traps, so you can prepare without worrying about your traps being quickly disarmed.
---
yo that's like so cash money of you
---
Of course! It took a few games but here is what i used: Spine Chill, Prove Thyself, Sprint Burst, and empathy. So i can get away fast if the killer comes close, do gens quick with teammates, and know where the killer is with empathy. I also recommend a toolbox with very fast repair speed, you could also bring a medkit if you wanted. And i just focused only on gens, i didn't help my teammates at all, besides healing.
---
I forgot how Spies from the Shadows used to work but they changed it at some point and there was a pretty noticeable decrease in killers using it. It was a small nerf I think. Since I stopped seeing that perk being used in general, I stopped caring about the crows.
---
Now I only see it on killers that are low level, like when you first get a killer or prestige them and are leveling them so the perks you have arent great.
---
That's almost worse because then I'm getting hit for no reason since I was running over there to save you
---
they are just that 1 piece, it isn't an entire outfit. Joe and Susie still have their default masks on.
---
He‚Äôs one of my favorite to play even though he‚Äôs weaker
---
There are so many missee variables here though, one example being ruin. Most games with ruin will find maybe 1 person on a gen, one chased and 2 blindly looking for ruin. Ruin pops by the time first survivor gets down and the one on the gen has it at 60%(assuming the chased one didnt bring the killer by it). Killer hooks first and sees the one on the gen and then goes and kicks it with pgtw and chases that one(gen will be dead) 1 other person starts a gen while the other goes for hook save. Saves off the hook and heals while the 2nd chased gets downed and hooked. The saviour and hooked surv are on a gen, killer goes that way and pgtw it then proceeds to chase, 1 gen gets done by the other random while the one out of the 2 the killer chased goes for the save. By the time hooked person gets saved, another surv gets hooked and killer goes to the 2 healing with bbq, chases the saved survivor and hooks while the other gets saved. Sees them with bbq, chases the healthy one while injured self cares and the last remaining survivor can either work on a gen or save off the hook. This is the kinda stuff I see all the time js
---
No one likes edgecore teens, whether they're survivors or killers lol
---
"We are farmers"
---
For Killer: Ghostface, he a sneaky boy and I can teabag.
---
For Survivor: Steve, because it‚Äôs Steve fuckin Harrington
---
Exactly,I'm ver close to becoming a survivor main, because I don't want to wait for 20 mins for a match,when I could find one in 3 mins if I'm playing survivor.
---
pc and windows store only atm... which is a little redundant but is a step in the right direction i suppose
---
Steam users and Microsoft store users only, this feature is out for like a month now
---
I was just a little bit confused lol
---
Im not saying you should cater your playstlye to ensuring survivor fun, it would be near impossible to win then. But i think killing a survivor by being better than them is more fun/satisfying than while theyre litterally helpless.
---
Its the same line of thinking as why high level huntress players dont run iridescent head and utility belt every game
---
It‚Äôs even worse when you die on first hook when the killers not camping and  there‚Äôs still all four people left and only one is doing a gen
---
You will be forgiven brother as you did what you had to do to complete the challenge. Hell I kinda ruined a game as survivor just to get self care heals.
---
I always thought a radio perk would be good for James. It would stop you from being able to hear killer , terror radious, huntress humm, freddy lullaby, ect and instead replace it with a directional static radio sound at standard terror radius  range or If not just slightly smaller.
---
I really like James blood point perk tho (pyramids is a bit gimmicky imo). I would run it on my farm build in an instant.

I would never criticize a killer for camping slugging or tunneling with 1 or no gen left. We've all been there as killer where it's all you can do to get 1 sacrifice. It's just those employ those tactics on their first survivor they down. They are tactic you should only use when you're losing.
---
Does it not go down with sprinting like legions or did they only change it for legion?
---
It had to be hit hard as it was two strong of a effect
---
I miss wraiths old lobby animation
---
Its not true though. Killer is instant queue at rank 1. Games are also generally pretty easy if you actually want to win. Facing bad survivors is boring. I hate games where I tell myself "well I don't want to win yet" so I have to let them recover.
---
Survivor rank 1 queue is like... A couple of minutes at most. Your teammates are sometimes good, but sometimes you have an idiot who brings their rank 20 friend along which you can't dodge anymore (thanks bhvr for that "fix"). Overall better than having 99% chance of potatoes on your team at rank 8+.
---
Plus, as a survivor you can carry games pretty hard if you're good enough. Winning or losing has very little to do with your teammates, as long as they're not completely brain dead... which if they reach red ranks they at least have a basic understanding of the game.
---
I'm pretty sure he ate a dog in Halloween 2 but idk about cats.
---
That's how we call them in my country. That's the name people in my country who wear their hair like that use. That's how the in-game skin descriptions call them. So that's how I'm gonna call them.
---
The only one offended here is you. I don't even know for what reason.
---
So whatever. I hope your day gets better.
---
i want this now i really do
---
Please stop, my brain can only take so much info
---
Any coordinated swf can dominate any killer. That‚Äôs how this game works and is a reason this game doesn‚Äôt have a built in voice chat
---
Im going to give you my idea on each of your build
---
**Trapper**
---
Devour hope its just like ruin, a gamble perk, it might work, but it might not do anything, and even if they dont find the devour right away, when they have 100% sure you have devour they ill look for it and they will find it without trouble, cuz that happened to me at least 1000 times. 
---
STBFL its good, but i dont like it, not my playstyle, im not a hit and chase person, i like to hit and get something out of the way like a pallet and then move away from the chase a make pressure on gens, tho, STBFL is godlike on clown, cause you can just bottle and slow them down and a hit with STBFL , they will get 0 distance on you.
---
NOED it works 1 out of 10 times. I mean, you can get 1 game where you kill all 4 with NOED and probably your next 10  games you get like 1/2 max, even 0 if they're good .
---
Before continue , I advice you to a little bit of everything on your build for exemple 
---
1 Info perk ( thrilling, BBQ,discordance,whispers,nurse, etc..) Map awareness (you might not need it, if you're a good killer you 're able to "guess" where they are based on spawns/crows/scratch and game knowledge,
---
1 regression perk (pop,ruin blabla) Seems obvious, makes games longer which means more time for you to win
---
1 crutch perk ( stbfl,MYC,infectious fright , etc..)  It helps you turn the game around if it goes wrong
---
1 utility perk ( enduring, spirit fury, brutal streght, etc) Helps you in chase and speed the game up in your favor
---
On your trapper build, you're missing some regression, it means for a 4k vs decent team you'll need a lot of slug, cause even if you're hooking survivors every minute, you'll need at least 12min to finish the game and it might be hard to hold the game for 12 min without ruin or POP, unless they are not doing gens.
---
the utility perks, trapper is maybe one of the killers who dont need an utility perks, cause you can simply put a trap on the pallet or bait it and force them into a bad position.
---
With all said, looking at my build 
---
 Thrilling tremors, corrupted intervention, Pop and infectious fright 
---
I've info from thrilling tremors, corrupted intervention for instant game stale (to set up my traps) POP for regression and infectious as a crutch perk, cause if the game is going to fast and i want to come back, I'll just slug and go for another survivor who screamed cuz of infectious.
---
**Wraith** 
---
Its perfect like that. You might want to add 1 crutch perk for a possible come back just like make your choice or STBFL instead of sloopy butcher, it works wonders on Wraith cause they wont see you coming  back for the hook( they like to heal a lot under the hook x) )
---
TIP of make your choice , if possible hook in a corner of the map, that way to can see exactly where the savior went, and even if you dont see them, there's not a lot of options, or right or left xD and even if they dont run away and just hide, if crows are still there ' it means they didnt went in that direction. crows spawns every 20 secs btw.
---
I like to use Haunted grounds, if they pop it right away, since I've no terror radius, i can just sneak on them and its a insta down and a pop stack .
---
**Billy**
---
Its just fine, you might want to replace Bitter murmur for Enduring, and do not respect any pallet, cause there's a lot of greddy ppl who goes past the pallet , and once they realise you didnt respect , they ill try to run back to throw the pallet down and u just block the pallet and rev your chainsaw.
---
**Nurse**
---
its fine the way it is, if you want some DC's ,replace corrupt intervention for infectious fright and slug if needed or just want to BM.
---
**Huntress**
---
Since huntress is really slow, you need to avoid waiting time patrolling gens, so whispers intead of corrupt is really good cuz it tells you right away if they're there or not.
---
**Myers** 
---
Myers is the only killer which I highly advice using bamboozle, monitor is really good if you use Dead rabbit, but you missing missing some regression, cause after all, myers its just an m1 killer with a insta down and sometimes vs good survivors its a pain to play, so I would advice change whisper for POP.
---
**Hag**
---
Really good and balanced build for every situations.
---
**Doctor**
---
I see you use alot corrupt interventation, my advice is only to use it on killer who need that extra time early game ,such as Myers, plague, trapper , hag.
---
I really like Haunted grounds on doctor, I do not know if you use it for the same reason as me, but I'm going to give you my little trick. Do not use treatment mode ever before haunted grounds pop, if it pop, use it right away, and you'll find 4 survivors screaming , all of them exposed by haunted grounds, cool ah ?
---
Pop goes the weasel instead overcharge, once they know you have it, they will pay more attention and hit 95% of those skillchecks.
---
and for the last perk, a info perk, thrilling or discordance and you're good to go.
---
**Bubba**
---
5/5 stars build.
---
**Freddy**   
---
No need for surveillance, i mean its a good perk,but anything compared to discordance or thriilling tremors, i actually use both of them on freddy, Discordance + Thrilling tremors + POP and for the last perk you can go with some crutch perk such as STBFL which works really good, even MYC, TP back to a gen close to the hook or if you want slow gens with the right addon, sloppy butcher
---
Sloppy butcher with the right addon = Slow gen , slow heal.
---
this is your brain on survivor main
---
King of the Hooks, not aware if it's a skin from last years Halloween event since I stopped playing the game for 2 years and just came back to it recently but it's sexy and I need it. Reminds me of the Lambent from Gears.
---
**Pig**
---
Corrupt interventation is actually good, as pig. it blocks 3 gens, so you can just crouch and thats -3 gens you have to check, normally as pig, the first hit is always free so -3 gens to check is a lot time saved especially if you're using whispers.. you might consider monitor, cause when whispers pop up, you can crouch save and 100% sure any heartbeat will be heard. 
---
As you can see, i do not use an utility perk on most of my builds, but on pig enduring or Brutal S is important, cause you benefit from them going down , so you can trap them before the 1st gen pops. Having a utility perk on her, helps a lot speeding up the game in your favor cause of that.
---
Last perk, Pop goes the weasel for regression as always, hands down the best perk for it.
---
At least its better than a ruin that last 30 secs xD
---
**Clown**  Clown: Corrupt intervention, STBFL, Thrilling tremors, Pop 
---
80% of my build, I use Brutal S instead of corrupt intervention, if they throw a pallet down, i just use a bottle of them and break the pallet, they cant go far if they're slow + the fact  im taking pallets down 20% faster.
---
**Spirit** 
---
Spirit doesnt need a lot to do well, I'm a lethality spirit player , that mean's I use
---
Haunted , Devour , Pop and MYC
---
I know i said devour is a gamble perk, but im confident with spirit, so that means I dont mind play with less 1 perk on her. If it works, its awesome, if it doesnt work, doesnt matter, cause I'm confident enough with her to win just like that.
---
Regarding your build, I dont know your skill level as spirit, you might consider stridor vs Iron will users if you having a bad time tracking them while phasing.
---
Sloopy is really nice on her, if they dont heal and you can track them, it will be really easy for you to down survivors.
---
Im not a fan of thanatophobia honestly , i mean, 16% its not a lot for 4 survivors, and sometimes build those 16% might take a long time, cause there're always immersed survivors and ppl who waste 1min self caring on a corner of the map.
---
**Plague**  
---
My current build on plague : Discordance, POP , corrupt interventation and infectious.
---
reasons behind the build
---
\- Block 3 gens
---
\- Infect all other gens
---
if they dont want to get infected, they gotta wait 30 secs, which gives me more time to do some damage.
---
Discordance - if 3 gens are blocked, they will stack on a gen, which gives me a notificantion, it means 2 infected survivors for free.
---
Infectious- If they dont cleansed, they will be broken all game, with infectious fright, I can just down 1, and slug and go for another one who screamed which is an 1 hit down.
---
POP - Regression
---
thanatophobia works on her, dont get me wrong, you can use it and works wonders, you might want to change whispers for discordance, it still is a info perk but if it is early game it gives you the position of 2 or more survivors which results in 2 infected survivors, and late game , it gives you the info where 2 one hit down survivors are.
---
 **Ghostface**  
---
its good the way it is, that kinda of build works really good on killer who can sneak on survivors.
---
**Demogorgon**  
---
Same as mine, I just use nurse calling instead of make your choice, if you're travelling on his tunnels, you can look around and see them healing all over and since I'm a hit and run killer, it works good for me. 
---
**Legion**  Legion: Thanatophobia, corrupt intervention, pop, Whispers 
---
I havent used Legion after Oni patch, i dont think STBFL still works with his frenzy. If it do
---
I would use **STBFL**, stacks really fast with frenzy, you can just 2 hit the same guy if anyone is around and tcharan, 2 stacks in 10 secs, **pop goes the weasel, Discordance (**2 free frenzy hits and info) and **Sloppy butcher** for some extra time and 1 hit downs if survivors dont heal which might help a lot as legion since he's not that great.
---
If **STBFL** does not work anymore, I 100% would go with **Thanatophobia, Dying Light, POP** and **discordance.**
---
Regarding you build, I think you know what I'm about to say Discordance &gt; Whispers.
---
**Oni**
---
I havent mention the build for Oni on the last post and I came up with: 
---
**Pop goes the weasel, discordance, infectious fright, thrilling tremors.**
---
**Scenario 1**  : 1 goes down, discordance gives me info that they are on 1 gen, I run there with my power, 1 goes down, the other one screams, TDRL 2 guys slug, 1 being chase... 4th as to go for the save = 4 survivors under pressure, no gens being done
---
**Scenario 2** : 1 goes down, gets picked up , thrilling tells me 2 gens are being done, use my power on 1 of them, if i get him down quick I might go for the other one... once again, 1 guy on hook, 1 guy slug 1 being chase, 4th survivor gotta go save, once again, 0 gens being done
---
Your build if perfectly fine tho, I just dont find whispers that good, I mean, its strong with huntress/Pig/billy/nurse other than that, I prefer other options.
---
***All of this is just my opinion how I see things, everyone plays whatever he pleases,X perk might work for me and my playstyle but dont work for you, so adapt your builds to your playstyle, at the end of the day, there's a lot of streamers who use their own builds and works really good for them.***
---
**Another mention**
---
As you saw, I never mentioned **Spirit fury + Enduring combo**, or **NOED** and thats why I dont enjoy having everything easy. I'm not the kind of player who runs with my forehead on every pallet just for the spirit fury , I don't like win cause of noed at the end of the game when i didnt deserved it , so I try to avoid those kind of perks. Same as addons, I do not use addons on any killer, some are broken , some are Ok, but still , I try to avoid addons.

Is it cheaper than buying the game+DLC? Because that's starting to be a pretty big barrier to entry for the game.

---
As someone who wants to main Yui (already have her at P2 :) ) it pisses me off to no end that Yui is slowly becoming the new Meg.
---
The one good thing about Yui being the new Meg is that I've learnt something about this game: you'd think edgy cosmetics like bandanas would be the "toxic" cosmetics right? **No: hair bobs. Hair bobs are the single most toxic cosmetic in this game.**
---
Think about it. Pink Hair Nea: Hair Bob. Blue Hair Feng: Hair Bob. P3 Feng: Hair Bob. Meg: Has a Hair Bob as an option. Hair Bob = Toxic, no exceptions.
---
Pink / Light Blue hair seems to also equal toxic. It's weird cause there are lime green cosmetics in this game and my time on r/tf2 would make me think that lime green = toxic. But I guess this game's community has half an ounce of visual understanding to know that lime green looks godawful.
---
If you are a good legion you always gonna have 4 thanatophobia stacks, good legion players make survivors give up on healing ;) also lmaoo 3 gens poped? Do you even play legion? The survivors need to mend and at the start of the match at least(if you are good enought) 2 injured and 1 of them is hooked wich grant already 2 stacks of thanatophobia then 1 of them must go for the save and theres just 1 survivor who is on a gens or maybe even looking for the hex totem if you are just decent as legion at the second hook there will be just 1 gen poped maximum and Im tired of writing this shit thanatophobia is probably the best perk for legion and the plague, Legion can injure survivors so fking easy that not take that perk with you is just stupid Im not saying you are stupid but is my opinion I'ven maining legion since january and Im pretty sure of what Im saying but you can build whatever you want see ya around corrupted intervention Legion lmao.
---
what do you want changed or introduced? the reason i play this game is because of the current core gameplay and I would stop if anything changed that affected the uniqueness at all
---
You are underestimating Hag, and getting that first hit can be hard as Freddy since his powers don't help that. And its easy to wake up
---
They were thinking?
---
Tbf they put a lot of working into creating spirit for her unique design. Which only serves to back up the question: why they would get lazy on her design now?
---
This is the draw for some of us just fyi. like, based on the ideas i've seen, more game modes sounds fucking terrible and corny
---
Oh yea that's from last years event. All I got to say is the face bothers me because I'm so used to trapper being so filthy and dark skinned. The mask and cleaver combos well into P3 stuff and legacy. I prefer to go with the classic Chuckles and P3 weapon and body though.

It's rank 10
---
She got it from her ancestor.
---
Banned for what?
---
If you don't find your first survivor quick enough or you find him but they are split up without and information perk trying to find a second one will be just a lottery, and yes at high ranks 3 gens pop like nothinf if you don't have pressure
---
They can fix a perk though without nerfing it into the ground. They changed DS and it‚Äôs in a pretty good place.
---
Then go after someone else and don‚Äôt tunnel. Let them stay in the locker until their DS runs out if that‚Äôs what they want. You should be going after the person that rescued them anyway.
---
Any killer can be strong if you play them well.
---
And getting better at the game
---
I'm a fan of Chuckles and honestly am debating on getting the Halloween skin for Hillbilly instead but most people avoid me like the Plague when I play him so bwing a friendly survivor is next to impossible when everyone thinks I'm gonna slug them. Nothing beats Escaped Patient for Myers though, people always assume I'm friendly with that skin.

"Reported for winning too easily"

2v6 confirmed?
---
Aren‚Äôt they changing rank reset?
---
And this sub has made it perfectly clear that survivors aren't allowed to have any situationally useful perks.
---
Good survivors will usually position themselves to fast vault it. And if they have lithe, it makes it that much easier to abuse the window. Unless a killer is already on their ass or forces them to take it with a slow or medium vault it's pretty common for survivors to get 2-3 loops in before a killer catches them at red ranks.
---
It still has one, its just not as bs of one
---
No I'm not. She's A tier. But without add-ons for trap speed it's too slow and half decent survivors will just leave then she gets to slog after them at 110
---
&gt; and getting that first hit can be hard as Freddy since his powers don't help that. And its easy to wake up
---
if it's hard to get the first hit then they're probably wasting pallets so meh
---
Let's not, you were literally offended because you thought I was attacking your cousin who I don't even know nor about their existence. 
---
Not sure why you tried to make this about yourself or make the comment an attack on you but people love to victimize themselves these days even if it doesn't relate or involve them. Unless you are Black, or look like Claudette, I'm not sure how or why exactly you chose to take offense to my comment. I said the exact same thing about Nea and you never even mentioned that once. Sorry sweetie, but we don't actually look like that, therefore I don't like it. And if they are going to keep her that way, then they should come out with more Black female charaters.

"Dreadlock" is a derogatory term, no different than the term "Mulatto". People still use both terms commercially, that doesn't mean they aren't rude or offensive. Thank you.

---
I hope so, I‚Äôve always felt like the American Kate hair should‚Äôve been longer, likes Meg‚Äôs carnival locks. I never understood why they decided to make medium length
---
This is false. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you tunnel or not you can still get ds‚Äôd
---
I mean to be fair you are talking to the dumbass that saw a no0b3 video and said "alright time to buy DBD"
---
and you can use them as effectice in chases if not better
---
This isn't ALL the DLC compiled, actually - if it were, it would be a great deal. 
---
The description suggests that it's just the BASE game plus Doctor DLC, Hag DLC, Clown DLC, Spirit DLC and Stranger Things DLC.
---
Which is weird, because the PS4 'Special Edition' usually comes with Huntress and Nurse DLC, too, but the description doesn't include those. So for some reason this version excludes Nurse and Huntress? Maybe that's intentional? Swap out Huntress/Nurse for Clown/Spirit? 
---
It also doesn't include any other licensed DLC, or indeed Legion DLC or Plague DLC.
---
Take ya lumps sinner!
---
How are you gonna get ds‚Äôd if you don‚Äôt tunnel??? Please let me know
---
bro I did the same and I thought u were calling me out lmao.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
No
---
I usually just laugh it off if people are healing me and miss a skill check. It happens sometimes...
---
Nurse and Huntress are free on most platforms.
---
Yeah, if everything plays out perfectly and the killer doesn't start chasing you when you still have 30 seconds of exhaustion left.
---
Understandable
---
Most of the videos are made using voiceroid and require Japanese but some like this one are more accecible. 
---
Heck even the Japanese ones are full of meme and fun to watch even if you don't understand a word of Japanese.
---
They have similarities but they are very different in style, Kate has that country girl, pop singer, cute babe vibe, Yui has a kick ass energy, very rebellious attitude. I love both tho, but I‚Äôm a Kate main so...
---
Wait, *just* the beret and cigarette?
---
So what you're saying is that this hasn't been altered in any other way?
---
It‚Äôs not even all the DLC like originally rumored lol. It only includes Curtain Call, Shattered Bloodline, and Stranger Things (plus Doc/Feng, Hag/Ace but they were already free on console). And the Head Case.
---
&gt; Literally happened three times in the last six months.
---
Let's stop pretending that those changes weren't needed.
---
lmao
---
Technically Huntress wasn‚Äôt included in the Special Edition, you still had to go to the platform store and download it, even though it was free
---
Why would you want it to be a base perk and  no longer a teachable?
---
Definitely killed a dog and ate it in Rob's version. He also killed the guard dog in the first Halloween I believe.
---
Huh, never even thought about that. Thanks for telling me. I might try it out.
---
This new map is a dumpster fire
---
How can I shine a mask in your eyes when you are wearing a stupid mask like that despite everybody knowing who you are anyway? Wait.......
---
Because it lasts 60 seconds. If I hooked you and you got unhooked, I could go halfway across the map down another survivor and hook them in 30 seconds. Find you again, down you in 20 seconds and if I picked you up I get ds‚Äôd. 
---
How am I tunneling if I downed and hooked someone else???
---
I don't understand why so many killer players think they deserve a 4k everygame, 2k on average per game seems pretty damn fair to me.
---
That made me bust up laughing cause all I imagine is a survivor violently getting killed with Jeff just flossing in the back
---
Well if you know the killer is not in chase or they are going to come, then you dont use it. Its mostly just when you know the killer is chasing or across the map.

Have they said who will specifically get Christmas cosmetics? Only the people in this pic?
---
Ah you know what, I guess that's what's happening. I only remember that I just never had to buy her. Looking at the Special Edition now, it doesn't mention Huntress or Nurse either, so I guess they're just included as the "base game".
---
So aside from non-Stranger Things licensed DLC, and Legion and Plague, this includes everything else.
---
I like it better that way...
---
Oh...
---
*sigh*
---
Agreed got lag switched by a oni because he couldn't catch us on infinite loop barn was cute a mile away then rubber band rubber band rubber band oh hey I died. Look no more lag okay other survive starts infinite loop so I can get rescued I get off hook heal up both lag same survivor after finishing 1 gen weird another massive lag spike out of no where followed by a hooked survivor not realizing he even went down.
---
Remimds me of Johnathan Reid from Vanpyr with that beard. Very nice.
---
Common advice is to get Leatherface, aka The Cannibal for his BBQ &amp; Chili perk, which highlights all survivors whenever you hook one of them, and gives you additional bloodpoints too.
---
He's a licensed killer though, so you'll need to drop real money on him. Still, in the opinion of a great many players, BBQ &amp; Chili is worth it: you'll see it recommended and used often in build guides.
---
Among the free killers, Trapper's good right now because of the Rift Challenges event on-going; and Nurse is good if you want Nurse's Calling, which is a very strong perk.
---
For non-licensed killers you can consider buying with iridescent shards for their perks, Plague(projectile killer), Ghostface(stealth killer) and Oni(high-mobility kller) are all fun killers and have very worthwhile perks, like Corrupt Intervention, Infectious Fright, I'm All Ears, Trilling Tremors, Nemesis etc.
---
George Lucas as next killer and Abrams as next survivor?
---
And take longer to rank (as in more pips per rank needed). 
---
Since it now takes longer to reset.
---
Yeah, but some killers are definitely stronger even if you‚Äôre a potato killer like me. Honestly I don‚Äôt feel wraith as one of them.
---
So latency has huntress hatchets hitting me through solid walls?
---
*sick ass banjo solo*
---
No revival, your bleeding out!
---
Because people are self-obsessed losers who have so little love for themselves so to make up for it they try to tear others down in every little possible way in order to make others feel how they do.
---
Is it really that hard to predict if she‚Äôs going for a vault? It‚Äôs a part of the whole guessing mind game that Spirit entails. There‚Äôs tons of other changes they could‚Äôve made if the others weren‚Äôt sufficient. I said it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúmuch‚Äù of course it‚Äôs a fucking change. Can you give me a decent example of when this is broken? Only times is when you get greedy going for loops at the killer shack.
---
ahh, I see your a man of culture too.
---
I died when eurostep started playing LOL
---
Oh definitely but most survivors even smart ones don't focus on small maps like theater and the game so they don't know it very much only people who play killer and switch to survivor or the ones that like to play on theater and the game will stand much of a chance
---
It lasts for 60 fucking seconds. In that time you can get unhooked, heal, start working on a gen, get found and downed again
---
imagine being so petty you get upset at someone for missing a skillcheck in a video game. maybe they had an itch? theres lots of ways how, tru3.
---
Haha yeah, what am I thinking ;D
---
I just wanna play my stealth killers in peace üò≠

lul thats great

It doesnt even counter deliverence

I‚Äôm really about to do it. Send link op

See, Micheals more of a cat guy

And like I said you dumb ass bitch you can get slugged so like I said dc is barley useable as it is now so suck a dick

Has Tru3 never missed a skill check is that how good he is? His survivor gameplay is really that optimal? Ugh difference in survivor am I right smh

are you okay

---
oh wow did that really offend you that much?
---
feel better soon
---
If I did that, the killer can say gg ez baby killer to me.
---
LMAO. Thank you.
---
I don't understand why so many survivors object to maps being mind gameable for either side. I don't like super safe loops or structures in the game that can cost a killer 2-3 generators by trying to get 1 survivor because there's no way to outplay the survivor. I don't mind getting a 0k when the survivors are better than me. I do mind getting a 0k when survivors abuse god window setups, or maps that have super safe loops.
---
It‚Äôs a new killer, what do you expect lol, this content isn‚Äôt gonna get itself. Survivors üòÇ
---
There‚Äôs players like this on both sides. It‚Äôs not just survivors, and pretty sure its not most, just like its not most killers. 
---
Look at it how you want to, but when I play killer I just take the free hit at the gate and push them out. Its easier than waiting for them leave. 
---
Also, if it really bugs you, you absolutely reserve every right to take NOED and knock em out. I love a good NOED / Bloodwarden surprise. It‚Äôll pressure them to leave faster during EGC and you can kill the rude ones.
---
I‚Äôve got 1000-1250 hours. I just don‚Äôt usually make it a habit to go after freshly unhooked survivors. Only times ever ever been hit with DS was when it was deserved. 
---
Just bc YOUR experience is you get hit with a bunch of DStrikes doesn‚Äôt mean everyone‚Äôs experience is the same.
---
I actually did this recently and it was such a wake up call. Yeah, the games where the killer was green ping and not on wifi were better than dedicated, but that was less than 10% of the games I played. The vast majority of the games had stuff like this happen constantly, not to mention issues like lag switching just not being a thing on dedicated.
---
Inb4 a bunch of killers say something along the lines of 
---
‚ÄúUh pardon me but he wasn‚Äôt facecamping nor did he down you the millisecond you gained control of your survivor after being unhooked so he was not tunneling and therefore that decisive strike is just proof that the perk is OP.‚Äù
---
The legion is in a much better place than people think and clown is def the worst killer
---
Mobile charges you for both.
---
I think it's possible to read Yui's perk in a way that makes sense. All the other survivors are usually too scared and trembly (Claudette, Dwight, etc.), or too thick or adrenaline-fuelled (David, Ash) to either dare to or to think about propping it back up again. 
---
I mean, thinking about it, it seems obvious to us because we play the game tactically, but most people thrown into the challenge won't automatically think, 'oh yeah I need to prop these up in a certain way so I can drop them on the killer if need be'. They're more likely to think 'ooh something to hide behind here'. Yui just instinctively has that tactical, forward-thinking idea, and other survivors can adopt it too.
---
I agree.
---
I feel like Legion is objectively better than Bubba now, which isn't saying much but is still saying more than before.
---
Here to cash in my 100 upvotes.
---
But with Mint Rag you have a 15s cool down on teleport, which means in chase that's 15s of a 110 m1 killer. You have to GET the down.
---
Shackles remove the force camera switch, which often makes people mess up their movements because it shifts so suddenly.
---
Its an effective combo, but you have to work hard for your first down.
---
Usually the person in the group that has Wake Up more than likely finds themselves to be safe from the killer across the map and then just opens ONE gate and either leaves immediately without helping the team or is just too scared to leave the exit gate.
---
Next update lets Legion repair generators and pallet stun themselves for negative points
---
&gt; But what if they weren't.
---
Well but they would be, this this entire Argument becomes pointless^^. The last part is understandable, but practically impossible. First of try figuring out when people are faking and when they really have dcs. Unless they implement immens programs for that alone it would be almost impossible to tell which survivors have a really shitty connection and which dc every 5 games. Even if you managed that, you cant ban people forever, if you dou they can sue you, because im pretty sure its not allowed to set ingame conditions or permanently reclaim an item which someone rightfully bought.

How to feel about this? Cool but they both should have 3 personal perks. Passive ability should be one. And escape artist is another windows of opportunity clone

why does this have 5 downvotes but the one in caps that was posted later has 23 upvotes???

As much as I want pyramid head, I do not want konami's filthy, greedy, franchise murdering fingers near this game. I simply would not trust them with a licensing deal other than a 1 off payment and fuck off.
---
I have but I don‚Äôt really care. I literally said I don‚Äôt rune it or care for it but regardless you don‚Äôt get to give someone shit for a perk they want to run.
---
Oh it really is. It's so much fun to just #YEET# yourself off the hook the moment the terror radius is gone and book it.
---
Then I'll die with my honor intact
---
Spirit is what Wraith should have been from the beginning in my opinion. Just make him completely invisibile and make him 170% like Spirit
---
You can swap NOED out for something to help with pressure while the gens are up. Make Your Choice or Haunted Grounds will give you instadown potential which always helps. Bamboozle can help you deal with windows and shorten chases considerably. Thrilling Tremors synergizes really well with Pop Goes The Weasel. Nurse's Calling synergizes well with Sloppy.
---
We Are very cautious in my house as we have foster kittens too. Never unsupervised  near a power cable  plugged in. He doesn't usually go for them only when he wants something because he knows it gets my attention. And he's an asshole ‚ô°
---
Reddit is weird sometimes
---
Did you not check the news tab of your game?
---
It doesn‚Äôt always mean ur tunneling but more often than not yeah it does lol. 
---
If you are chasing another survivor when the dude gets unhooked, down the guy, hook him, and then return to the unhooked dude, then you don‚Äôt have much time left on the DS and one slug isn‚Äôt gonna end ur career. And if it is gonna end ur career, then you aren‚Äôt in a good position to begin with and that‚Äôs not bc of DS. 
---
And just bc streamers say it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true. Streamers say Nurse is still good when statistically she‚Äôs one of the most dogshit killers in red ranks and a bunch of actual Nurse mains are a pissed at the changes (she wouldn‚Äôt still be good if we were angry about it). Streamer=\=correct
---
come take a closer look 
---
Dur hur

Rank reset is Friday, and with the new reset rules currently you will only go back to rank 8. But if you derank to 9 then you'll get reset back to 12 and should be able to have some relaxing games for a couple weeks at least until you rank up again. I am at 10 and also constantly facing red ranks so my plan is to derank to 13 so I get reset to 16 and can have some fun playing killers I don't usually use. That's also the easiest way I've found to derank, just start trying out new killers that you're not good with and only their perks, maybe if you're lucky you even get an adept achievement with one of them.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt agree that it‚Äôs throwing. If someone wants to waste a spot on a crutch perk that‚Äôs on them. Do I think it‚Äôs useless? Yes. I‚Äôm not going to give someone shit for what they want to run though.
---
It does not. I had someone get downed while I was being carried and my bar went from yellow back to grey right when they went down
---
God damn my soft spot for all things Christmas
---
This is exactly the point I was trying to make. All the other perks that "counter powers" don't completely shut the power down for the entire match.
---
Reading that convo made me want to commit no mither
---
DH &gt; SB &gt; BL &gt; Head On &gt; Lithe
---
Dead hard is just good all around. It extends chases, saves you from mistakes, etc.
---
Sprint burst allows you to get a head start on a killer and most importantly it lets you get out of dead zones and work on gens where all your resources have already been used. You can hold it at 99, or for those who know how to do it, you can still hold SB while running without exhaustion.
---
BL is just amazing on some maps, good on others, bad on others. Being silent while falling allows you to make some stealthy plays now.
---
Head On is a fun perk, but it can sometimes shine in chases, to save teammates and pairs very well with quick and quiet.
---
Lithe is just awful. Its like a worst sprint burst because it doesn't really protect you or gains you an advantage. If you safely made it through a window you most likely still want to stick around and keep using your good position, and If you got hit through a window you already got the speed boost to get away and would probably rather have any other exhaustion perk on at that point. Its like a shitty conditional sprint burst.
---
You will also be rank 5.
---
Ruin is a necessary killer perk and other lies you tell yourself.
---
Just give him a "Homemade Yeezys" add on like the ones that Billy and Bubba have to muffle their chainsaws.
---
Then people need to stop saying it‚Äôs only for tunneling killers because that‚Äôs just a lie. Imo DS should only work if you are actually being tunneled. If I am tunneling someone and I get ds‚Äôd then that‚Äôs fine I deserved the ds.
---
You bring up NOED as if I think it should be in the game in the first place.  That perk is bad for the game and generally the player using it as well.
---
They can do what Hearthstone does work card backs, but with charms instead.
---
I would also like individual character ranks. Rewards can work off your highest rank. This matters more on killer since survivors is just different skins. This will allow people to show off their character mastery.
---
They also need to add a black rank after red to increase the bar. Too many people in red ranks when they shouldn't belong there. Imagine League of Legends if Platinum was the highest tier - you'd have Platinums, Diamonds, Challengers, Masters, whatever all in one group.
---
Healing speed is not penalized for co-op action, so if 1 person healing takes 16 seconds, 2 people healing takes 8
---
Honestly, I agree. The only nerf he actually received that's actually done anything is the nerf to STBFL and Sloppy no longer working on feral frenzy. Besides that, the changes to the pin add-ons are phenomenal and the faster window and pallet vault times really do make a difference in catching up to survivors in the limited time you have with your frenzy.
---
I searched for this specific item only , and all posts on both reddit and steam forums were folder than 6 months. I thought that is was for one item only, my bad
---
very neat story
---
yesterday i was on the north way of a gen, and the hillbilly was chainsawing from the south. i didn't move away from the gen, he didn't curve. i got hit as if the gen wasn't there. i almost broke my keyboard.
---
ffs bhvr
---
my dude that is directly effecting ur life span if they are letting u go stage 2. I won‚Äôt give someone shit for running the perk itself, but I sure as hell am allowed to if they feel the need to waste that much time and let me die. If u play shitty, it‚Äôs perfectly fair to expect people to call u out for it.
---
Oh agreed other perks are better but at the end of the day I didn‚Äôt buy their game and I can‚Äôt tell them what to run. When I play survivor I go in thinking most of my teammates aren‚Äôt going to have a build I personally build something that can help me in most situations.
---
I haven't played as much Killer as Survivor. Currently 100 hours in to this game with rank 11 Killer and 4 Survivor so I'm not really high rank in Killer yet.
---
From what I've experienced trying to get Adepts (got Adept in all survivors :D) and Challenges done, is a crapton of Disconnectors, Gen Rushing (Just yesterday 3 gens got completed within the minute, maybe I'm bad but seriously...) and toxic players (I feel like I'm getting slightly toxic just being exposed to then).
---
Only recently have I heard people calling me a Tunneler or being called bad when I'm just trying to do my best and have fun, I aim to try safety pip and if someone gets unhooked near me, I will go to them. I don't feel it's my fault if the closest survivor I can down is the unhooked one, most of the time I run off to try get the unhooker, I will then go back if I can't find them, later on in the match they usually appear near me for god knows what reason and then they get death hooked, I feel bad but It doesn't seem fair to be toxic to me to be honest. And I specifically don't camp because I know it will reduce my bloodpoints and overall won't let me get double pip for Adepts.
---
Now on the other hand, I solo'ed my way to rank 4 survivor, it's extremely fun but only recently have I noticed how toxic everyone is, calling you out for not helping when a killer is camping their corpse and you was at the gate trying to see if you can rescue them or if it's not worth the instant down, death hook risk, come on guys it's a game, have fun. I also get how awful it feels to get tunneled several games in a row because you usually die within the first minute, however I also feel it's my fault for not being a better survivor which is understandable if I'm easily spotted, but also sometimes the time the Killer somehow walks in the right direction, in to you directly... xD
---
I get what it is like to be toxic though, If I have my best gear and I instantly die, I'll be quite salty but it's not like I can't get them back and I will just lose them all when I start prestigeing anyways, or if I get gen rushed by a SWF within the first 20 seconds, I will get pretty pissed and will either perform badly and hide in a corner as a ghost face because it was my first time playing him or try to Oni Smash them. Or  if someone escapes through a hatch and you were so close to getting them and double pipping, for say an Adept, that makes my blood boil but at the end of the day it's a game and its supposed to be fun and you will have countless opportunities to try again. 
---
Quite a bit of it is the developers fault for the achievements, challenges in Tomes, unbalanced against the Killer, unbalanced mechanics and atrocious Matchmaking with highly mixed ranks and long waiting times that cause this behavior, I may have only owned the game for 4 weeks but seriously? 
---
Just try have fun and play it the way you want and learn at your own pace, do what ever challenges you want and don't listen to other people being toxic. At the end of the day, you can earn back what you lost, you can keep trying if you lose, you can be unmotivated at times so just take a break, you don't get anything out of being toxic.
---
Also this is my personal opinion and you can disagree if you want, I'm still pretty much a noob compared to people I know with 1000's upon 1000's of hours poured into the game, but this is just what I picked up within my first 100 hours.
---
Also, maybe hit me up if you want to help me improve at this game? :3

People expect you to find a teammate and heal, but half the people that play are so immersed its nearly a waste either way. I just do everything while injured.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt care. If you have a key at all you die asap
---
CONGRATULATIONS! BRAVO! Now, with time, you'll understand how utterly worthless that number is :)
---
I see an idiot like you, I call it an idiot
---
Yes, it's a bug that's been there for a while. You've been BHVR'd and you can't really do anything about it but send a support ticket. They'll give it back to you eventually
---
I've been browsing this subreddit for the past dea days, didn't see any of them, since they weren't that upvoted. No need to be all passive agressive about it
---
Lmao I don‚Äôt know the answer to this question but I love the build.
---
You must have a lot of friends.
---
Good strategy. I get intensely mad going for killer adepts so unless I want to burst a vein I‚Äôll just try meme build
---
Considering you weren‚Äôt in the game I was in you don‚Äôt know how they played. They played perfectly fine.  No one was healing in the corner letting people die on hooks. I‚Äôve had people use medkits while i‚Äôm dying on hook.  My point is running the perk itself is not why someone dies lmao. If someone has it and plays properly you can‚Äôt blame them for running it in their kit. People just play shitty and that they can be called out for. Their perks are whatever they chose and that‚Äôs up to them.
---
Hey I don‚Äôt use it :D and I‚Äôm rank 2
---
Besides that I believe it‚Äôs the hit boxes on the character themselves. Tell me why just the order say I was working on a gen and right behind me there was a gap then a tree (mind you the gap was big enough for someone to walk through) but for some reason one of my teammates had to go around me even tho the gap had enough space.
---
the problem its not the perk, but the mindset that normally comes with self care, if u have it for the insurance of healing without a medkit or a teammate in certain situations, then its ok, but if after every hit/unhook u gonna be under a pallet for 50 seconds healing and ignoring everything else well then...
---
While I love the idea of a silent hill chapter, the perks don't seem the best. We don't need more 2x BP perks that essentially do nothing as a perk itself. Nor do we need another perk that is just even more massive slowdown, Creature of the Fog when combined with other perks will give survivors like ~60% slowdown on actions which is starting to be ridiculous. Deliverer of Punishment just encourages hook camping and also seems too strong with BBQ. Escape Artist just seems like a better WoO. Promise seems ok, but does sound like overkill when paired with BT
---
My main killer is easily Wraith, my reasoning is that I hate dealing with people just hiding and not playing and if i play as wraith it's a lot harder to hide from me when you have rely on more than just heartbeat to know if i'm coming, and for a survivor Dwight simply because I kind of look like him
---
You could always gift them some Microsoft money, they can use it on Autistic cells.

That's no problem. Keep up the great work. ‚ù§Ô∏è

finally a meme similar to this that i actually agree with

O thats great! thanks for the answer
---
I can hear it o_o
---
Hmmmm
---
It seems like you‚Äôre implying you already have the Spirit but not really leveled up. If that‚Äôs the case, I would get Adrenaline out of the two. It‚Äôs an amazing game changing perk that will save your ass more often than not. 
---
If you don‚Äôt have Spirit and don‚Äôt plan on getting her, I would get Rancor for the same reasons everyone else in the thread is suggesting. It‚Äôs better to get a perk for a locked character than an unlocked character. 
---
Rancor is really one of those fun gimmick perks that I only really use to get a mori daily without using an offering that makes people dc. There are some people who actually use it for its tracking, but Adrenaline is just an unequivocally better perk.
---
Thanks
---
I'm not going to get mad with them, if I like die on hook due to someone selfcaring when it's safe to get me then I'll be annoyed but won't flame them for it, they'll probably learn anyway that it's not good over time or once they run different perks.
---
I used to think self care was still the best perk (after when it wasnt good anymore) but between then and now I just was trying out some builds and never really re-equipped it on characters that have any better perks. Only planning on equipping it for challenges
---
I agree on it being a nerf but it was a justified one. The reason they nerfed it was to remain consistent with other killer's alternate attacks, Pig's Dash Attack and Demo's secondary attack for example.
---
Following to find out
---
Yesssirrrr
---
No, not the same.
---
No, I didn't check it
---
Gonna work on that
---
I don't
---
Don't forget the absolute joy that was running 4 sprint bursts! Even though it was broken and the devs took forever to fix it, this bug was the most fun I think I've ever had in this game. I got a chance to try all aspects of it, including hag with a chainsaw (Queue'd for Billy and a survivor used a splinter.)
---
Now I want the Lego Legion

The Lego Leg would be fine too
---
Oh, she will. Don't you worry.

Ash would demolish them too.

This looks way better!! Everyone is so generic bow

No it isn't, that will get you banned (if it's possible at all). Editing chase music can give competitive advantage
---
Shes behind you *hears drill* yes piggy yes
---
Fuck I really hope the Developers are paying attention to this. I'm seeing multiple posts here and on the Forum for the last two weeks about this. I'm also around the same rank facing the same problem. It's going to get to the point where nobody's going to want to play killer anymore and Survivor queue times are going to go up to 30 minutes. Then the game slowly dies. They really need to do something about their matchmaking or figure a way to incentivize people to play killer so that there are more in the queue to be matched with red rank survivors. I've had the most frustrating games lately constantly getting stomped by red ranks. This is the third post I've seen here in the last hour about this.
---
And this is implying your chase goes well and you're not getting looped in a god loop.
---
Eu so n falo q o cara √© burro pq eu fiz a msm coisa ontem conta aquele GhostFace
---
You should see the entrance to the preschool Bedham. It's similar to this and you can see like not even 10% of the trap
---
I could swear if I had the data it would show my % of being hooked before unhooking someone skyrockets when I bring Deliverance.
---
Good answer, but Ghostface is licensed so you need to use real money on him
---
This brings me back. Had so much fun doing this during the olden DBD times.
---
Also tunneling you despite that they have make your choice and that you have an active beartrap on your head.
---
Deal with it h Web is a big boi
---
Ss v√©i, triste demais
---
Yeah I was survivor rank 13 at the start of the month and managed to get to rank 4 this week. I‚Äôm not playing survivor again until the reset hits. Now to work on my killer at rank 12.
---
Hell yeah, drive that knife in me deepüòé
---
They should really make hatch and totem spawns truly random..
---
Let's be honest, we all know who's the real survivor in Legion matches
---
Swf is a part of multiplayer games and always will be so you might as well get over it.
---
Daddy ASMR back at work üòå
---
You can play against ruin with split pressure, don't necessarely need 2 people searching for ruin. 
---
Red ranks are still able to apply split pressure with ruin being active
---
I feel like the higher rank I am, the worse I perform.
---
As a Legion/Ghostface player, true. But as a Legion/Ghostface player, fuck you.
---
Ah, I see you too have run into red ranks Piggy.
---
That takes a lot of resources for something that most likely will be deleted
---
I know many things about game design are like this, but it's a total game rebalance so it will take A LOT more than an usual scrapped idea
---
That's a bug
---
They use deep wound to run away
---
Yay i dont have to play purple ranks anymore!!
---
what
---
Considering my argument was focused on Ironworks and Elementary, both having super safe loops that are huge time wasters that require a killer to give up enough time for a generator or 2 to even chase around unless said killer is already on top of the survivor, I dunno how your argument is relevant other than to make a separate argument. 
---
Though, since you want to make that argument, maps like Hawkins are way too fucking killer sided unless you're Huntress. It needs to be fixed since BL can't be abused on there. There are other maps that are really killer favored, but in reality those are far less than maps that favor survivors.
---
LOL I was with you all the way until you called her weeb trash just because she's a Japanese character.
---
You didnt say anything about moris being used when killers are tilted. And there arent any doibke standards here. I want keys fixed. I want moris fixed. I just want to balance the game
---
Time sensitive content?  Are you referring to the battlepass?
---
If you actually watched the video, Otz does make sense. Wraith can do really good, but claiming he's the 4th best killer is kind of a stretch, I believe the latter reason is why Tru3 is getting mocked so much.
---
The reason this is even such a hot button issue is because the stupid narrative people threw around for years that it's physically impossible to win at high ranks with like 13 of our killer cast. We have such more balanced game now, that assuming you have access to all perks and use the best add-ons of a killer, you will have a fair chance of doing well, if anything I feel that's what this experiment proves.
---
If Tru3 didn't have such a high standard for "viable" I'm sure he'd see that.
---
But that could actually be quite useful, though. By standing at the door with it at 99%, you're essentially giving your teammates an unlimited timeframe to get to an open exit gate. I agree that it's more likely the survivors will either escape or die within those 2 minutes anyway, but waiting at the 99% door is definitely more useful than just leaving.
---
I like pop, surveillance, make your choice and whispers on her.
---
Step up your game.
---
I have 28
---
Nobody - it's already out for free!
---
Not the point I'm trying to make though. A lot of people say BHVR won't make humanoid killers because 1) costs more to make and 2) no way to put survivors on hooks.
---
Having a game made by a small company have a non-humanoid killer in it kinda shows that the budget excuse is a load of shit, right?
---
I have no idea why this made me laugh so hard
---
What the hell?
---
Had a rank 8 match like this last night.
---
Was this made in LEGO Digital designer?
---
Awesome
---
"self-care is a huge waste of time"
---
No, it only makes this game less boring for killers. Stop being sweaty little shits, you can win easily even with self-care.
---
He isnt really bad, hes actually pretty fun to play with, shred destroying pallets much like Billy's saw and being able to use the portals manually, being like a more aggressive hag, along with just the general fun bit of having him screech. The main problem is that he is kinda the killer manifestation of the dj Khaled suffering from success meme, where while the screech is a nice little bit on him, it also informs the other survivors that he is chasing someone else. Leaving through the portal also leaves an area exposed, meaning they can destroy the portal or whatever totem you left behind, a gen beside the portal or any survivor you just hooked. Due to shred destroying pallets, it will prioritize destroying the pallet instead of hitting the survivor if they vault over it or drop, meaning the chase is extended a bit long, with at least a pallet destroyed in the process.
---
Oh my build is Monitor and abuse very underrated for legion then bbq ruin and discordance but probably can switch discordance if you want
---
Demogorgon. I'm sure he's good but to me he is boring as hell to play.
---
What‚Äôs the consensus on Furtive Chase? Is it good and why?
---
Freddy‚Äôs sweater best sweater
---
The 18th.
---
on pc low rank killer has a 15-20 minimum queue time
---
No I think it‚Äôs the 16th but maybe
---
If silent Hill comes in.. Resident Evil Should too
---
Maybe they just want to keep Bill's lore canon.
---
u/babiedumpling
---
Not really. A spider can't throw an adult human onto a hook without being rendered completely immobile without carrying them or having them just.. get off. Also, it's more of the animations for non humanoids, because the engine can't really support that all that well and people already hate the animation bugs already, so they don't wanna add more fuel to the fire in that sense. The budget is also there, because they have more wages to pay and more resources to put towards other things like bug-fixes and the like.
---
I've once had a Pig t-bag me for the entire endgame collapse.
---
I think it is the 18th as well.
---
No, just happened to me last night
---
Repost
---
Clown is definitely the worst killer in the game, there is no doubt about that
---
Very cool! Would actually be even cooler to have a whole lego set lol
---
It happens tl me almost every match, hope they fix it ASAP
---
No one ever jumps on the bandwagon when I play pizza dwight. Makes me sad.
---
You can also use it to launch yourself off of things with height but some maps have stupid hitboxes you run into, like ormund
---
Same happened to me last night. I did 4 gens, looped the killer, and saved each of them at least once from the hook.  Once that last gen was done I went down saving someone from the basement and everyone bolted. Not one of them made an attempt to come back for me.
---
Salt in the wound: I run kindred so I know they know the killer wasn't camping or anything. Bastards.
---
D A M N .
---
Ah yes,enslaved exhaustion
---
Oh yeah! I‚Äôve seen that before in some streams. The only thing left to do is pray I get destrike in my bloodweb soon lol. Thanks for the help!
---
I just double checked it is the 18th. You can see for yourself if you open the news tab in game, you just have to scroll down a long way but the dates for all levels are there.
---
Not sure why it takes so long for you to find lobby‚Äôs but I find mine in less than two minutes
---
"winning" in your scenario is nice but 5k more blood points would have been nicer.
---
Getting stuck on gens, for one.
---
I only read up to the part where you said its all broken and immediately knew what you were going to say. Rank reset makes rank a joke in this game. I am a rank one survivor who plays against rank 10 killers every rank reset
---
[Bill coming back to see the gate untouched](https://youtu.be/RRe3XvaOrW8?t=11)
---
Being a furry is the closest you can get to beastiality without it being beastiality tbh
---
You are not playing him right then
---
You mean the game that has only 4 killers and was pretty much dead on arrival?
---
Now that's just some fuckin bullshit mate. It feels like you HAVE to be SWF to win a survivor sometimes because of how stupid teammates can be
---
it would be appreciated if the hit that cases them to leave counted towards my daily ritual. i can't tell you how many times I've hatched someone or pig leaped someone and got the hit byt it didnt count because he left due to the hit
---
Yeah. Guess I should've been more clear.
---
I agree so much. Visually and stylistically it's incredible, but I absolutely hate playing on it as both survivor and killer. It has so many issues.
---
You seem to be one of the lucky ones then, there's been an overwhelming amount of people complaining of long wait times.
---
You got a point there
---
yeah i afk and watch videos after the gates are opened and its obv they are standing in the gate. the only time they are wasting now is their own
---
Freddy can't help the fact that his teleporting gets weaker as the game goes on and needs to charge. I play him fine at red ranks, I do believe he's very good.
---
right? op is a genius
---
Because this community is terrible and they talk shit/hate/try to make peoples days worse for literally no reason at all other than to be a toxic shit
---
Pig's a bitch
---
I have been playing ALOT for about a year and a half and if I didnt prestige characters I wouldnt have anything to spend bp on. I like having p3 characters wkth every perk on them so I can use what I want with who I want
---
I mean it probably just depends on your rank tbh if you aren‚Äôt at least green rank lobbies for killers are going to be slower
---
lol no if you can't 4k a great team and killer isn't viable to him
---
I just do other things while I'm in que. YouTube I have to catch up on, research I needa do and RuneScape for the real grind.
---
You can run any perk at red ranks. I‚Äôm rank 2 and currently just working on adepts for everyone XD
---
my flair has been called once again
---
"Don't forget, you're here FOREVER!" -Forever Freddy
---
YES. I made a post about this long ago!
---
Last Year as in the game that already died once and was basically just a literal beat up the killer simulator?
---
Try it during rank reset that‚Äôs how I got it, I don‚Äôt think I even had ruin at the time.
---
I was more so adding a comedic effect then actually being serious about Her being weeb trash. Seems I triggered some weebs though considering the downvotes
---
Um. Queue times take longer, which means it takes longer to level up battlepass, so yeah...they're correlated. Don't worry champ, you'll get there. Best of luck.
---
Welp new desktop background!
---
Except like i said every myers wants to get out of tier one as soon as possible. Unless your running mirror there is literally little to no point in staying in EW1 and having to walk across the map in 105% and having no lunge.
---
I dont have an issue with spine chill since it doesnt give away my exact position on the map.
---
That‚Äôs sadly not going to happen when playing an online game. The closest you could get is hosting a match as killer but even then survivors are getting the opposite experience. This is just like in a FPS where you can hear your weapon fire but the server rejects your shots because it read that someone else killed you before hand, it‚Äôs just that in this game it doesn‚Äôt reject the fact that the pallet is thrown after it read you were dead and instead allows it to go through after the fact. Believe me shit like this can get worked on and improved but it will never be perfect.

I think I might, yeah. Good idea, thanks.

With all the other great advice you've gotten, I leave my own 2cents, which is just to remember to enjoy and have fun with the game :) Play, try out different characters and perks, fool around with different strategies and builds, and have a great time with it all! The absolute best way to improve is to play, so play and enjoy!

Ds is disgustingly over powered because its anti momentum and killers rely on snowballing to win

*Made some significant modifications based on feedback.*
---
#New Location: Silent Hill
---
##The Pyramid Head
---
*Music: [Chase](https://youtu.be/WShknpNpHbY)*
---
###Primary weapon: Great Knife
---
###Power: Strangle
---
The Pyramid Head grabs a Survivor by **tapping the Power button**. Once the Survivor is in The Pyramid Head's grasp, he begins choking them. The Survivor will be faced with a skill check, giving them an opportunity to escape. If they succeed, they free themselves, but are put into the Injured state. **Strangle** has less range than The Pyramid Head's standard attacks, but can bypass the Injured health state, if the Survivor **fails** the skill check. If a Survivor is already in the Injured state, they will not be given a skill check, and The Pyramid Head can carry them to a hook immediately.
---
###Passive: Terrorize
---
The Pyramid Head's presence is so distressing to Survivors, that repairing generators and using items takes **20% longer** while within his Terror Radius. This ability scales with Survivor perks that buff repair and item-consumption speeds.
---
###Perks
---
**Creature of the Fog**
---
You have a way of getting inside the minds of your victims. If a Survivor is rescued from a hook, both they and the rescuer are afflicted with the **Dread** status effect for **40/50/60 seconds**. While this effect is active, affected Survivors take **20%** longer to use items and repair generators.
---
**Exhilarating Hunt**
---
You are aroused by the thought of tormenting the sinful. For every Survivor you leave in the Dying state, gain a **2%** speed boost, up to a maximum of **10%**, every **10/8/6 seconds** that the Survivor isn't hooked or revived.
---
**Deliverer of Punishment**
---
You can sense the hope building in your prey. When a Survivor is hooked, the aura of any other Survivor within **8/10/12 meters** of them is revealed.
---
##James Sunderland
---
*Music: [Lobby](https://youtu.be/6LB7LZZGpkw)*
---
**Promise**
---
You have vowed to protect one Survivor. Their aura is revealed to you when they're within **32/40/48 meters**. Additionally, if you rescue this Survivor from a hook, they are granted a **10%** speed boost for **5 seconds**.
---
**Radio**
---
You possess a radio that is specifically tuned to the Killer's presence. When the Killer is less than **32/40/48 meters** away, you hear static when looking in their direction. The static grows louder as they draw near, and is replaced by their terror radius once inside of it. You cannot detect Killers while they have **Undetectable** status.
---
**Escape Artist**
---
You perform well under pressure. While being chased, you vault **10/15/20%** faster.
---
*If you'd like a concept for Maria, let me know!*
---
I tried that on iOS the app is in another language and only lets me follow things not install any app. And when I look up dead by Daylight tap tap on safari it just directs me back to the AppStore

I still do it now if the killer did douche things. No shame, this sub just has a lot of overly sensitive killer mains.

---
He‚Äôs pretty decent but he can still get looped. Even if you have snares just put down the pallet early just like if facing clown.
---
Yea I mean it's kinda hard to hear her literally spasm
---
I'm going to feel bad for my team when I do the spine chill challenge of not getting hooked and escaping. I'm about to out all blendettes to shame. Urban evasion, iron will, spine chill, left behind, all p3 clothing, pink key with milky glass(add on to see killer?)/beads to add 15 seconds, yamaoka offering.
---
Yeah like its just a joke get over it
---
I actually pull people off of Gens as Oni. You may be able to hear him coming but apparently people don‚Äôt actually care? Don‚Äôt even have Monitor on him.
---
Yeah, the queue times are long because because the game is broke, that‚Äôs obviously what‚Äôs going on there. There are a multitude of factors that go into matchmaking for any online game, including this one. Do you want longer queue time, but fairer matches, or shorter queue times with players massively above and below your rank?
---
Sorry I should've known. Forgive me.
---
What douche things do u mean? I don‚Äôt mean that killer doesn‚Äôt have them, I‚Äôm just asking a question that what kind of douche things they did.
---
Dont you know your objective isnt to kill its to ensure the survivors are having fun
---
Honestly, I'm just tired of all the excuses these sheeple give them.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt
---
Anyone who mains killer 100% of the time, I respect the hell out of you. Makes you feel like shit when you come across people like that non stop.
---
Ah, the rare 2% of higher ranks that don‚Äôt use it. gg piece of shit.
---
...or he could just sit on his left shoulder?
---
His power is really strong if he catches you off guard or in the open. If you can get to a pallet or window it is near useless. If they like to rev there chainsaw as you are about to loop thru a pallet you need to keep looping and not drop it. This will waste a LOT of time if they keep doing this
---
To be fair, I'm only rank 11 right now, but I'd chock that up to just not playing nearly as much. I still queue up with my red rank friends and so I'm usually playing against pretty experienced killers. 
---
That being said, I know that this isn't the "ideal build", it's just to have fun and try playing differently every once in a while.
---
Sheeple is such a worn out insult for people who don‚Äôt want to immediately grab the pitchforks and burn down BHVR HQ every time something breaks and/or doesn‚Äôt go their way
---
I'm at 900 hours but I've only been playing since a couple weeks before Ghostface came out.
---
Except he doesn't lmao
---
I bought Legion because i liked their playstyle,  and I knew they were going to nerf him,  but never expected it to the point it is now,  i dont regret the purchase tho,  i think that with some creativity of perks and use of their power there has to be some very good build hiding around somewhere,  or maybe i am just delussional looking for hope
---
This happened in the killer shack, I had been running the killer around all game so I decided to get him on me while the others opened the gate. I was in the killer shack doing pretty well, still healthy, and went for a vault but jumped in a locker instead. He had Iron Maiden.
---
with BVHR, this is to be expected.   Sorry man, you got BVHR again
---
I rarely complain, if ever, but when they're taking people's money but still shrugging about their shitty ass work ethic that's a different story. Sorry not sorry.
---
her hair is pretty long this is just kate but the entity loaned her a straightener
---
I'm pretty sure the entity disagrees considering the multiple challenges telling me to Butcher, brutalize, Crush, scratch, Devour, and to literally kill them by any means I mean hell look at the rift the entity is literally encouraging me(also it's the only way to end the match as killer)
---
flashlights and body blocking are only things that can happen if ur not careful as a killer. I see nothing wrong with playing optimally. at the end of the day, all you can do is get better.
---
I don't see bodyblocks or flashlights as a big problem. They are tools that all survivors use so that they can all try to escape. BM'g though is quite unnecessary. It's all a cycle. Toxic survivors BM a fair killer. Then this fair killer gets angry and takes it out on innocent survivors. Rinse. Wash. Repeat.
---
Your wish has been granted ;)
---
Ashy Slashy?
---
Or when the killer is just about to leave. "No! were not done here! Lets go another round"
---
Personally I feel like getting 150 shards per rank is a little much and would lose BHVR a lot of money, especially if someone plays both and gets to rank 1 on both sides. If it was rewards for your lowest rank it would have more incentive to play both sides equally since that seems to be the path that BHVR is trying to take, but that's just what I think about it, maybe I'm wrong
---
Check out my changes. You'll probably like them better.
---
16 and 12 is pretty normal though plus it is like 3 days until rank reset
---
I think 2 months is the perfect amount. I don‚Äôt have time to grind like I used to so that extra month can help with that. As for the charms, I also like the idea of it. The main thing I truly want thought is bp or shards at least. That‚Äôs the kindest way to say ‚Äúhey, here‚Äôs more blood points to feed your addiction to the game and make it a bit easier when going through the web‚Äù
---
Only problem is the charms might not be enough for the people who have had the game for a while, they probably don‚Äôt need BP or iridescent shards and the charms still probably aren‚Äôt worth it to get worse matchmaking times at Rank 1 especially
---
As a killer main(kinda because I do play a decent amount of survivor also) I usually send nice messages to people that insult me to make myself feel better as they are usually left confuse and apologize
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm only rank 14 and very new to killer. Most of the time when they‚Äôre toxic they aren‚Äôt even good to back it up. But when they‚Äôre genuinely decent survivors it just makes you feel like shit. I don‚Äôt camp or tunnel etc... will just try and get better to decimate teams like this because I refuse to DC even if I‚Äôm getting bullied lmaooo
---
I never said the game was perfectly balanced, just that it's better than what it was. The game will never have the killers be on equal footing, it's impossible to have Nurse = Leatherface in terms of ability, chase potential, map pressure, etc. unless you fundamentally give them the same power.
---
Balanced should mean that a killer has a chance to win. They all do, but you got to factor in the 4 other human players into the mix who also should have a chance to win. It sounds like most people are talking about a Single Player experience when they bring up killer potential to win, which isn't the case.
---
Also keep in mind just because killer A is stronger doesn't mean killer B has to be equally as strong, they just both have to be capable. I'm not saying every killer is at that point yet, but we are getting there with the slowly but surely balance changes
---
Also worth mentioning if you pay for the pass and complete it you will acquire enough auric cells to purchase the next one, meaning if you play a lot and complete every pass, you only paid $10 for a qhole lot of cosmetics
---
what are you talking about
---
That‚Äôs a really nice idea, I‚Äôm going to do that next time. I‚Äôm playing surv for now because I‚Äôm so angry I can‚Äôt face another toxic team hahaha
---
I know. But like having a challenge with purple ranks and not playing farming simulator with yellows. Not saying that all yellow ranks want to farm but its what all my games have been
---
Ok?
---
Oh I can totally agree on the fun side, but running No Mither basically forces the killer to hook you right away and it happened that if the killer is carrying a survivor, that said survivor gets dropped on purpose to hook the No Mither runner. But yeah sometimes can be fun if you don‚Äôt get tunneled to death üòÇ
---
I‚Äôve not seen them shrug off any major issues, in fact they‚Äôre typically pretty good at providing some level of communication with the community, even when they don‚Äôt have to. As for this issue with queue times, it‚Äôs not an issue at all. People wanted fairer matches, or at least as fair as possible, this is the price you pay for that. The fairest match possible=longer queue times a lot of the time.
---
Or the bug where she can hug a wall and yeet through them.
---
No perks or killers are broken
---
Yeah. I don‚Äôt want to be a killer that‚Äôs had so many horrible teams that they‚Äôre toxic non stop because it‚Äôs not fair. The game I just had, as soon as I downed someone or was in a chase, they‚Äôd all swarm me and block me in to corners etc. So unnecessary.
---
No. Oni needs a nerf. No mother can be worked on after all the balancing issues are taken care of. No mither is a perk for people to challenge themselves. It should not be looked at as a counter to anything in this game.
---
Sure is, if you're new at the game.
---
A lot of the best strategies and plays are easily considered nasty.  
---
Body blocking a hook to get the survivor off of your shoulder might feel nasty to you, but to the guy on your shoulder, those other survivors are blessed angels saving them from inevitable doom.  Same for Flashlights.  
---
Now as killer both of these things are easily preventable, body blocking your hook won't matter if you choose closer hooks to use and if they try anyway that's a free hit in your favor.    
---
Flashlights?  Just aim your body directly at a tree or a wall so it blocks the part of your face that would blind you, again no big deal.  If you're on the farm or in an area where you don't have line of sight blockers, stand directly over the person and listen for foot steps, hit the survivor with the flashlight and go back.  Do the same thing again and see how greedy for that flashlight save they are now.
---
I meant that too
---
Excuse me
---
Feels bad man
---
It should deactivate after downing/hooking another survivor. I'm so tired of bad survivors being rewarded for not running away and getting caught a second time even after I hook another person.
---
I‚Äôm Rank 1 for Survivor and Killer and trust me I‚Äôve seen what happens in those ranks. You can literally end a chase in 5 seconds and the gens can still get done in no time because gen speed and map size.
---
I was actually thinking the other day that a Silent Hill skin pack would be good. Heather‚Äôs outfit for Meg, Mary/Maria for Kate James or Harry‚Äôs for Dwight, and Dahlia and Cybil‚Äôs for someone etc. SH nurse skin for Nurse. Throw in a Silent Hill map (like maybe the hotel or prison from 2 since we already have a hospital and school), and I‚Äôd be good, doesn‚Äôt need to be a full chapter.
---
Though if we got PH and James Sunderland, I wouldn‚Äôt complain either.
---
Nah if I get caught on the gate I usually just point and nod.  No reason to play the will they let me finish or won't they game.
---
I'm honestly suprised I got 0 hate messages lol
---
Thank you.
---
Tried this at release and no it doesn't
---
Remember that Spine Chill can light up even if the killer is not coming directly at YOU, but just looking in your direction. There's no substitute for time and experience when it comes to being able to locate the killer in game, but keep your wits about you and play smart. Is the killer patrolling gens and headed to yours? Hide! Is the killer chasing someone else sort of nearby? You're fine to stay and work on it unless they run the killer right past you, usually - sometimes being aggressive about generator progress is the right play, so use Spine Chill as a tool to gauge your safety rather than an alarm bell to tell you to GTFO the first second it lights up!
---
Regarding 2, that's super situational. Generally if I don't know who I am up against, I will run by default for the first few seconds of the match as the likelihood of the killer finding those early scratch marks is SUPER LOW, so there's no real risk. Otherwise, I always just play it by ear whether I am walking, running or crouching. If I know the killer is safely away from me (on a chase, hooking someone, etc.), I'll feel safe to run if needed. Otherwise, it's all up to what the individual situation calls for.

Again, the ability for certain killers to get kills at higher ranks it there. But to accomplish this is more based on killers being way better than the survivors, survivors making major mistakes, or getting unfavorable maps. It has little to do with the killers actually being effective. I can play in red ranks with Freddy really well,  it ask me to do that with Clown or Legion and I‚Äôll suck, because I don‚Äôt have the game knowledge to get the same results. This has nothing to do with a single player experience and  everything to do with the false logic of killers being viable at every rank irrespective of an individuals skill at the game.
---
I'm fairly certain I can out trash you lol. Don't test me!
---
I‚Äôm the exact opposite of that. I usually run WGLF AND No One Left Behind when I‚Äôm after bloodpoints, I‚Äôll turn around and BT someone off the damn hook take the hit for them for doing it and die happy with my stacks.
---
I main killer and the only teams that actually concern me are swf on comms (and they still have to actually be competent). There is an obvious problem where those teams are overpowered, but I'll gladly take any 4 solo survivors any day.
---
Or they could make so the entity carry‚Äôs the survivor for them, it already blockes gens,gates, and kills survivors when end game ends,
---
Parab√©ns! :D
---
Nothing is more embarrassing when you wear your sweaty neon fit just to miss a simple skill check
---
&gt;Can i have your queues please.
---
Sure mate, just rank up.
---
&gt;The average player is garbage though, even at red ranks.
---
Which doesn't really affect your ability to have fun, as long as they don't just stand still the entire game.
---
Oh i meant in our personal lives
---
Just saw that Otz PWYF Bubba video and it seems like the most uncounterable thing in the game. Not complaining, just agreeing that Bubba is easily underrated.
---
Someone needs to be caught first anyway. To fuck over your team like a baby when downed first is just garbage and you shouldn't play.
---
Bootlicker?  Sheeple?

Nah she has medium length hair, that‚Äôs not long at all

Who would win?

---
Time is b for t short Borrowed
---
If you don‚Äôt want the aggro that comes with having a key then simply don‚Äôt have one. Killers can play well and survivors can still get gens done. 
---
Also it doesn‚Äôt matter if green keys exist because they have the same model as the others for some reason and I‚Äôm not just going to assume everyone with a key has a green one
---
Def not till mid chapter . I'm guessing she will have a outfit in the next riff tho .
---
Can't say I've ever been penetrated by a lovecraftian spider god but you keep living your best life.
---
There could be other ways for the spider to dispose of the survivors besides just throwing them on a hook. Especially with all the spindly legs a spider can possibly possess as well as fangs to do so.
---
Also they using the Unreal Engine for this. They're not using Unity. I been using the Unreal Engine for the better half of 2 and a half years. If they can't make an animation work especially a spider one and unreal I don't know what you. Also I thought they making a lot of money selling that stupid currency for skins as well as the battle pass thing which you can still pay to progress...
---
Uhhh it‚Äôs not like DS lasts for 5 minutes.
---
Rip
---
So I guess if we're playing this game we're in good company. Lol
---
I got 4 with bubba's chainsaw. They were all in the small room upstairs in Hawkins trying to do the achievement gen. I have the vid on my account somewhere. I let them get up though it was literally 15 seconds in.
---
yeah baby
---
A. The budget is being spent elsewhere on all the wages they have to pay, licensing costs etc.
---
B. As other people have stated there is a problem with the engine on animations. It would cost an crap ton of money to fix as they would need to first set up a completely new engine for the game to run off, transfer assets, animations etc etc to said new engine and have the team capable enough to do this. (Which they dont.) 
---
C. We currently have 10+ killers all with balancing issues and the like, I prefer they spend there current resources on fixing the balancing issues, rather than waste it on a new killer being non humanoid.
---
You completely missed the point of the thread with that "hate boner for Last Year" of yours.
---
Yea but doesn‚Äôt have to for this to happen.
---
wow humble brag
---
Funny considering the hatchet has flown through the wall for me in the past.  When there is a wall between me and the huntress and has been for a second or two.  Yeah, that's some 1000ms+ ping latency.  Or getting hit through trees.  Huntresses hit boxes are broken.
---
Playing on the dedicated servers as well has not fixed these issues as well.  If anything, in my experience, the hitbox issue multiplied under the dedicated servers.  The dedicated servers also lagged horribly at times.  I've heard this "dedicated servers will fix all the problems" talk before with F13.  Dedicated servers didnt fix the issues with that game, and they wont fix them here.
---
"NO MAN LEFT BEH-*STABBED THEN HOOKED* Well it happens, we'll leave no man next eternal cycle of sacrafice.
---
‚ÄúToxic Nea‚Äù would only be using DS because the baby trapper tunneled her. It‚Äôs normally easy to tell who the new killers are after rank resets or if I don‚Äôt play for a few months if they tunnel and do a poor job of tunneling someone out of the game.
---
Are there preset hatch points? and i thought they were on the map the whole time just not  open.
---
&gt; Which doesn't really affect your ability to have fun
---
That's subjective :P
---
Nope it doesnt
---
Exhilarating Hunt on Oni with Infectious.    
---
  
---
*Oh baby* ***yes***
---
Strongly agree, I‚Äôve had this happen at the start of the round on multiple occasions and the killer shows no mercy. Although there would have to be a certain rule set in place, for example someone would have to disconnect within the first 2 minutes for everyone else not to lose a pip, if anyone disconnected after that it would be treated normally.
---
Then you'd have people DCing to make sure their SWF doesn't lose any pips on death.  
---
Every quality of life or game play improvement in this game is almost always immediately exploited to be toxic.
---
What cant you do if your teammates are bad?
---
You can loop killers, you can hide from the killer, you can try to escape (do gens), you can plunder for items, you can be altruistic.
---
Unless the only fun part for you is to escape through the gate(not hatch), then how good/bad your teammates are has 0 impact on what you can do in the game. 
---
If you only like escaping through the gate, then I suggest you find another game because a few seconds of non-guaranteed fun with minutes of non-fun in between is not a great ratio.
---
Takes 5-10 min to get a lobby another few min to fill it on ps4.  It use to be instant.  They broke it.
---
Thank you for understanding haha.
---
I‚Äôm the nice killer if I kill 3 survivors I let the last one run away
---
Killers who don‚Äôt tunnel will get ds‚Äôd by either playing too well or the survivor knows how good ds is and forces the issue especially if they have unbreakable along with it.
---
the problem here is swf, you want killers to be able do dodge swf teams ('cause this is what they dodge let's be real) but not be punished for doing so? so i could play killer and dodge every single lobby for the fun of doing so,without consequences. Slowing down the waiting in lobby for other people but who cares about others, right? Swf teams should have a separate playlist like it was once, so dodge could be punished. No point dodging a team if it's not swf. Btw getting dodged all day leads to people leaving the game and not playing survivor anyway, just saying.
---
&gt;As we all know, the ranking system is broken.
---
Broken as not working or broken as you don't agree with.
---
"Ohhhh my goddd man my survivor is floating fuck this game bro omg man"
---
Can only do 1 challenge at a time with no way to get credit unless you have that one selected!
---
Hahaha r unexpected subreddit, hahhaha unexpected dubs I fell for. Hahaha third sub hahaha am I funny yet give me updoots haha
---
May god have mercy on your spul
---
"Don't do that. Don't give me hope."
---
For context: I was doing the NOED challenge. Claudette got the 4%. I caught her, hooked her again. She remains frozen in the animation frame when a survivor first gets hooked. [Her bar doesn't progress](https://i.imgur.com/HIUk6vE.jpg) and she begins accruing crows. I can't cloak, close the hatch, open lockers, etc. Even when EGC ends the game continues in limbo, and even after she DC's, I remain in the game and also have to DC. 
---
The very next day, I went down for absolutely no reason while running toward a generator. Killer wasn't next to me, I wasn't in deep wounds, etc.
---
I really want to like this game, but my patience for it is just gone. The devs clearly don't give a shit. They're not a tiny team, and making the fucking game work is their one job, and they can't even care to do it properly. At this rate, I'll uninstall once the season is over because I'm just so tired of BHVR's consistent incompetence.
---
That dude is a dumbass. Should've messaged him if he was so good then why'd he die to a purple rank.
---
Hey Luis, you can still kinda see the name of the person lol.
---
The ego on this one "I always escape" someone is bullied at school
---
Whatever. Shitty killers who need to tunnel and camp cant be reasoned with.
---
Well they would take noed, no sympathy I'm afraid üòÇ
---
After I spent so much time looking for any names. Thanks for letting me know, I‚Äôll repost it without it.
---
So select the challenge?  Is this even a complaint?  
---
it's free extra blood points for doing things like healing ten survivors, or some generators.  For the most part these are things you should be accomplishing anyway and over the course of only a few matches.
---
I always just laugh at randos messaging me. Or send a few love hearts
---
I could really use it because I never pay attention to the bubbles that show you where the exit gates are.
---
Sure, good luck trying to make an optional thing a issue
---
In red ranks right now finding a match as survivor is disgusting whereas killer lobbies are nearly instant. Though you are right about stress levels generally speaking.
---
Exactly. Unbreakable has started to lose a bunch of value lately because killer‚Äôs literally slug through it, and unfortunately Unbreakable only works the once.
---
I don't care if i escape or die but i like to have a chance at it :) 
---
Looking at people urban evading in a corner of the map while i'm going to second stage on my 1st hook while 5 gens are still up even though i ran the killer around for enough time to get 3 or 4 gens up... That's not really fun.
---
Red rank survivor queues are way worse than killer queues right now.
---
Fearful eye is the opposite of kindred, being able to see the killer within 14m is completely overpowered and prevents any kind of mindgame. I want it
---
Q with my sister and friend for SWF fun to get our Archives challenges
---
Wait in Q for 10-20 minutes, and then:
---
‚Ä¢ One of us just doesn‚Äôt spawn in with the others
---
OR
---
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúFailed to connect to host‚Äù
---
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúAn unknown problem has occurred‚Äù
---
‚Ä¢ Killer dodges
---
‚Ä¢ One of us gets kicked mid-game bc ‚Äúoops! unknown error teehee sry :)‚Äù
---
Idk it really doesn‚Äôt last that long. I don‚Äôt know why this is even an issue for y‚Äôall.
---
So you have no argument nice. Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll just start bringing moris instead
---
I said it's generally faster, just because at this moment it's not doesn't make this the new normal.  
---
Plus that just also means more people are playing survivor at the moment (probably to use the new pallet reset perk?)  than killer.
---
There are sections you can look where the probability is higher but it is never spawned the whole game. At 1 gen it spawns regardless of players still in the trial. It spawns based on players alive to gens completed.
---
Are you using a good pair of headphones?  If I can hear their injured sounds during a chase, I generally use that more than I do scratch marks when I don't have line of sight.
---
No, I would dc because no one is obligated to play in this conditions, and I would just die anyway, so yeah, I‚Äôm not ‚Äúbeing cool‚Äù I‚Äôm just saying there isn‚Äôt much to do in this situation, either you die, without doing anything bc the game is lagged, or so you dc, I rather dc than waste my time, I‚Äôm sorry for my teammates but I always try to help them in the best way possible, and if you gonna blame someone, blame behaviour for their massive connection issues, if this never happened in the first place, I would have helped my teammates
---
Should've said that instead of posting a picture screaming like a maniac.
---
Ye
---
Ye, no problem manüòé I'll remove your name from my comment too!
---
Do what almost all other players do if u got a nvidia card, up the brightness so theyre easier to spot aswell :p
---
You have to open the Geforce Experience, go to your account and it should say like opt in for beta stuff, if you do thst then ingsme Alt + Z(thats it for me) you should have a extra option on the left i thought, there u can play with tons of settings even addin crosshairs etc
---
That's the main thing, to stay calm and collected.  This game is significantly harder to play when you're tilted, and a lot of survivors will go out of your way to frustrate you.
---
I can barely spot it on most maps, I've tried.
---
Leatherface and Wraith are definitely worse so neither
---
You got Behavior'd. Nothing more to it. Accept it and move on
---
Got it, thank you!
---
T H E  P I P E
---
It's just sad that we don't get any benefit from Hemorrhaging. It's not like we can use Blood Hound since it would be pointless because you can find people using the orbs themselves.
---
That's because any time I'm blatantly sarcastic, the majority of reddit users still can't figure that out without an /s
---
You have to unlock it (buy it) from the bloodweb before it will show in other characters' webs.
---
Yeah if you want to play like an asshole I cant stop you. You're clearly not good at the game. Besides, I dont play survivor much so it doesnt affect me.
---
I took it to mean actually broken (as in mechanically). For example, spirit and wraith are broken this patch because the acceleration they are supposed to get after using their power is bugged.
---
My only problem with NoeD is I just don't like relying on hex perks, it's so unreliable.
---
and does it auto show up when you hit the level for that perk or is it random after you reach the level
---
Survivor queues have been longer at red ranks for a while now. Even before the new chapter dropped.
---
No problem my explaining can be crappy normally i show it to people instead with screenshots but im chilling on the sofa atm haha, hope this will help you out, it did for me, no more blendettes :D
---
Lmao same, I felt so bad cuz i let everyone die
---
He's solid upper mid tier. I think many people are just not very competent with using his abilities to good effect.
---
With the portals, for general use, rather than place them close to just any objective such as a gen or hook, you want to kind of section the map into zones, and make sure you have at least 1 portal in any of those zones. Usually that's 4 if you just mentally draw a cross through the map, and the middle area, where the lines of the cross overlap. Having a portal in those areas allows you to have great map mobility since no matter where you are and no matter where you want to go, there will be a portal relatively close. You also want to hide your portals in off-corners away from objectives, not only so that they won't get cleansed, but because that way you can take some advantage of the surprise effect lent to you by the Undetectable status effect after traversing. Of course portals can also be used in more specific ways, such as close to gens, hooks, gates or totems to use for their tracking, but unless you are using a very specific build, the tracking is not something you will often make much use of at all, and even with some of the specific builds it's often better to hide the portal to try and get the jump on a survivor on a gen or totem.
---
Shred is a strong chase ability. You have to think of it more like a hatchet, you can actually make some very tight angles work with it. If you know when to charge it and are comfortable with the angles and distances, it can punish survivors around longer loops and on gym tiles of much of any kind. At 400% movement speed and coupled with the killer's latency advantage, you will hit people through windows and pallets constantly. As for breaking pallets, I see too many people that pre-charge Shred before the survivor drops the pallet and then simply shred it if they do. Not only does "charging" Shred (so holding Of The Abyss) reduce your movement speed and can potentially allow the survivor to make another loop they wouldn't have made without you charging it, but rather than immediately breaking the pallet, at a lot of pallets it is better to zone the survivor first, and then Shred at the pallet from a distance. This can even be used to get hits, but usually it will at least reduce the distance the survivor has on you after the pallet break. A more general utility of Shred is to catch up to a survivor - especially once add-ons get involved that reduce the cooldown after shredding (Mew's Guts, Black Heart), you actually are faster when you spam Shreds than you are if you simply walk (and if you shred off of elevations, you go much farther). Use this to close distances to survivors.
---
Trash. Currently does nothing useful. Why on earth would you care about your Terror Radius *while in chase*? You can't even hear the Terror Radius over the chase music anyway...
---
I guess it might be useful as part of some kind of niche build that revolves around rotating your current obsession, but if so I don't know what that would be.
---
In theory one build of that sort could be combining it with Nemesis and Make Your Choice. The idea is that you hook your Obsession, then Furtive Chase makes the rescuer your new Obsession, Make Your Choice applies Exposed, and Nemesis should show you the new Obsession's aura for a few seconds and make them Oblivious. It sounds like a neat idea, almost like it turns you into a temporary Ghost Face against one rotating Survivor at a time without having to actually play Ghost Face... but there's no telling how well it would work in practice because currently *Nemesis doesn't work with Furtive Chase*. The good news is this was included in a list of "known bugs" from BHVR recently, which implies it is *intended* to work with Furtive Chase which implies that it *might* in the future... someday.
---
A gun Kappa.
---
But really I could see like a revolutionary type killer that has musket work. Where they have to reload every shot and have extreme fall off of the bullet so you cant cross map with it.
---
Or just people who think it was a pretty cringey thing to say.
---
Just a normal day on the DbD offices?
---
Or the sentient killer waits for BT to run out and slaps you. Feelsbadman :(
---
Maybe for SwF lobbies but I haven't experienced that myself.
---
This still wouldn't work because the person DC'ing in this scenario doesn't care about themselves all they care about is saving their SWF ranks. Not to mention, there isn't a restriction on who can play with who so even if said person who DC'd depipped all the way down to rank 20 they would still be able to play with their SWF.
---
Yep. Nothing to see here... except some more Pig nerfs.
---
Surveillance.
---
What killers are broken? Some of them like Legion, Clown, and Bubba are lackluster but none of the killers are broken
---
I think Huntress' Chinese New Year costume is more akin to a fursuit than Pig's getup, tbh.  That bitch is full on cosplaying, while Pig was just wearing a rubber mask to disguise her identity and The Entity morphed it into an actual Pig head for the lolz.
---
Gotta love them high rank players.
---
When you‚Äôre at the point where you start insulting the person you‚Äôre arguing with, you have no other comebacks or arguments at your disposal.
---
Well I'll still do stuff, just making sure I escape. Playing super safe about everything.
---
You do realize people don‚Äôt have keys every game or even most games right? So most games I don‚Äôt play like that. Don‚Äôt have a key and it won‚Äôt happen simple but hey say whatever you gotta say to make yourself feel superior bud. Now go cry to someone else
---
DH is my personal fav, good for getting around the killer to get to a hatch/exit/pallet
---
Did get 2 full heals before the medkit got depleted? Someone else had the same problem a few days ago and turns out that they were depleting the medkit halfway through the second heal lol
---
Dude it's not a bait...the Legion we have right now is better than the Legion we had before.
---
Do you play survivor? Maybe more broad situational awareness might help?
---
e.g. Where are you in relation to the map's landmark(s)? Where are the survivors running *to?* Are there finished generators or pallet deadzones nearby? Can you use your ability to threaten them away from a tile? A lot of survivors will be routing you away from the other survivors towards the finished generators. If they escape, they'll probably route back towards the others, a new generator, or just hiding right nearby to self-care.
---
Reading your individual survivors is important too. I like to think of chasing as a conversation. The more you listen, the more they tell you: are they always looking back? Ducking? Sprinting to the next thing? They're reading your intentions so make sure to mix up your approach behind cover, otherwise they'll play off your gut instincts
---
Lastly: Stridor with headphones (and the headphones setting checked in options) really helps me. It is awesome to be able to use your hearing to narrow it down instead of just relying on your vision
---
Good luck!
---
I main Myers and try to get gen grabs on T1, I also feel him
---
With the noed challenge, do I have to let the entity sacrifice them or with the hook. I've done it like 5 times and haven't finished the challenge for some reason.
---
What would you define as boringly immersive? Someone who doesn't purposefully let you see them at any point? If you need survivors to show themselves so you can find them, you just need to work on your tracking skills. In the same way that it takes skill to chase down an experienced survivor, it takes skill to outsmart and catch one off guard when they're trying to hide.
---
You saying that "immersive" survivors don't last long in chases is exactly what I'm talking about though. Because they would rather stay hidden all game, you assume they're no good at the game. Everyone lumps stealthy players in with noobs, I guess because throwing insults at the people you lose to feels good.
---
Nah, More like living in two worlds, I'll be playing both
---
Rank reset as we knew it is gone, bud. As of the new chapter, rank reset will only take you back to the previous color. I.E., red ranks only reset to rank 5. Def agree about the old rank reset, though. I'm cautiously optimistic the new rank reset will solve that problem (we'll see in a couple days, I guess), but that's really a separate issue from what I was talking about.
---
Obviously ://
---
We have been begging for rewards for years. We have been begging for a rank system rework for years. 
---
It seems like they should have done this before a battle pass. I say this as someone who is doing the paid bp. 
---
I don‚Äôt know why they are so afraid to give us rank rewards.
---
Stand being a wall for 3 seconds without the killer looking at you then
---
I will definitely play it, since, c'mon, it's part of Resident Evil 3 and who doesn't love Jill Valentine? But since it's a very narrow IP, new content will probably not be added at the rate of DBD.
---
Nah, after a while you just dont care lmao. I'll take my depip and just play better next game. I'm not going to let a mori ruin my day or my fun.
---
Just take away his knife already
---
Im on android so idk how to do it on ios, sorry
---
^^^B
---
             _T_
---
A trapper 4K is usually where they slug because the survivors are dumb enough to of constantly walk in the traps. Trapper does need a nerf lol. Survivor intelligence needs a buff ;) and I rarely see a wraith 4K, he‚Äôs weak enough as he is at top tier
---
Ass
---
Also something else I‚Äôd like to add why I love DS + locker combo. If I get on my first hook and a killer brought a mori, tunnels me immediately after the hook to get his mori in within 2 minutes of the game, you best believe I‚Äôm jumping in a locker. I shouldn‚Äôt have to lose a skill point after waiting for a match for 15 minutes and my game is over within 2.
---
Aight , imma head out
---
nice
---
Yeah I did. They were both healed completely by me with a medkit and the perk. t was definitely a bug for me. Got the challenge complete the second time. So it‚Äôs all good
---
Oh look, it's this again.
---
Waste of perks to have more than 2
---
How are you helping your teammates by dcing?
---
Limits god loops that waste around 1.2 mins of killer‚Äôs time
---
How did it happen so I don‚Äôt do that when i spawn on this map .
---
Stud.io, bricklink's lego designer program.
---
Bloodhound is one of my favorite perks. I made sure it was in my build when I was fairly new to the game. It helped me track injured survivors easily. Once I got more seasoned in the game, I didn't need it. You'll eventually learn survivor tendencies.
---
And a second life in the next game of course.
---
What does obsession do for the killer? Cause when it's on me, they beeline straight to me and even find my locker easily
---

---
Strongly disagree with your assessment of DS. Like most "meta" perks, it's very rank and playstyle dependent. At single digit ranks it may seem mandatory (even OP) because matches move so fast that the Killer not being able to hook you for one minute is like being invulnerable for a quarter of the game, it lets you pull off obscenely ballsy plays, and most Survivors can hit greats with their eyes closed.
---
At double digit ranks, it's a different story. Matches move a lot slower, so one minute is nothing. You'll just straight up never get to use DS unless you're actively being tunneled‚Äîand if you are being tunneled, you're pretty much gonna die no matter what you do. And there's definitely skill involved, because a lot of Survivors at those ranks can't consistently hit great skill checks.
---
You have stepped on they way that has no way back...but pretty good job so far, good luck in the fog.
---
Imagine instead of seeing the crows it‚Äôs just the cat
---
Ooo is not op because it literally shows you exactly where survivors are if you are at tier two you shouldn‚Äôt have trouble finding the person using the perk and stalking them if anything that makes it easier for you to find and stalk them
---
There's no such thing as best perks when it comes to killers. Sure,  there are meta perks which makes the game easier for most people, but most of the time it comes down to what you are worst at. If you're not good at gen pressure, Ruin and Pop are good choices. If you're not good at ending chases, try Enduring and Spirit Fury. If you can't get many kills until endgame, try NOED and Blood Warden.
---
I can already hear the Entity's whispers...
---
Thank you!
---
No matter how hard I try the survivors I go against won‚Äôt boop the snoot so they all die. I always give the last guy the option and they would get the hatch but instead they run.
---
What if they were swf?
---
Thanks üòéüòé
---
Which ones? I havent noticed any?
---
The BEST feeling
---
That's what I was thinking, but every game i've played recently but always be SWF cause this is always happening atleast every other couple games. When i played killer games, i'm barely rank 12 &amp; i loaded into a all purple rank lobby. üò≠üò≠
---
Tomorrow
---
When I first started I didn't know anything about scratch marks, so I thought running had no consequences other than it being louder. Also thought you could play as a killer with friends, in a public match. I got disappointed when I found out you couldn't but now understand why it is the way it is lol.(I had come from Friday so I just figured it'd be the same since they got compared so often.)
---
But...the only strong thing it has is the exhaustion on teir 3....
---
How, Bill Gates is still relevant as ever lol
---
* Discussions primarily about games similar to Dead by Daylight (e.g. Deathgarden, Identity V, Friday the 13th: The Game, ‚Ä¶) are considered offtopic and better suited for /r/coldwindfarm or their respective subreddits.
---
Tobey Maguire approves of this pizza time.
---
Can we get a parts list and building instructions?
---
I'd say make it open the hatch for the person with the key. And make the hatch unable to open again. It would suck for the last person left to not have hatch open, but it should be a personal escape item.
---
Prestige removes items, offerings and perks, but higher the chances of better items in the blood web. Prestige cosmetics depends on survivors and killers.
---
For killers, they get a bloody for I, bloody body for II, and bloody head piece for III.
---
So overall, it's a good idea to get pIII on the characters you use most.
---
Honestly I hate this phrase. Obviously we can't do better as most of us aren't developers but we should still be able to criticize the game and point out the problems. Like idk great perks being locked behind a paywall or you wait a century just to get what you wanted in the shrine or hell killers just having very bland designs like Legion were they seriously the best they could come up with when thinking of a band of misfits, or the Spirit for example she's just a generic long haired ghost woman looking to kill people.
---
You can try to run bloodhound+sloppy perks to follow the red juice they leave on the ground, run predator for tighter path of scratch marks or stridor to hear injures louder, it also counters iron will, which is nice.
---
Moris don‚Äôt make me mad, that‚Äôs just part of the game. Tunneling usually doesn‚Äôt either. Most of the time if a killer tunnels they aren‚Äôt very good and I can just run until all the gennies are done so it works out. Face camping for sure though.
---
I would love Pyramid Head as a killer
---
Oh god now that‚Äôs terrifying
---
I thought it was memeing...dang now I'm a r/woosh victkm
---
Trapper, Hag, and Myers all require more setup than Demo, while lacking its secondary power.
---
You can just setup portals on your normal gen rotation.
---
I can get a parts list, instructions might take a bit!
---
When people are completely unable to play their game, that should be fixed immediately. I was among a few dozens plays, as far as I'm aware of, that was unable to play for three days this past week.
---
How you get them
---
Prestiging is basically resetting your character after you reach level 50. You lose all items, perks and add ons. The only thing you keep is the teachable perks if you unlocked them. It is highly recommended that you save up some bloodpoints before prestiging unless you have another character with perks you like.
---
For survivors, prestige 1 gives you the bloody top cosmetic. Prestige 2 gives the bottoms, and 3 gives the head. I'm not sure which order cosmetics are given for killers.
---
Definitely. If I escape a camp or save someone from getting camped they get teabagged at the gate every time.
---
It still works on legion in the best way possible... Which is the normal way. Since that's the only way possible, it's the best way.
---
A technically correct moment. ;-)
---
That could work. You'll still feel robbed but not it's more like they only took the money out of your wallet not the whole thing.
---
Ooh I see! Thank you so much. Was wondering what was the point of PIII other than cosmetics.
---
What platform? I assume PC? Also what region?
---
The problem is I've been accused of shit like tunneling and camping as justification for toxic behavior when they were just flat wrong. Survivors get a very limited picture of what's happening so whenever I see "I only so it when it's justified" comments I role my eyes a bit.
---
That said, I also just don't care about it. Getting tilted over other players tantrums is just a waste of energy (plus it can make you play worse if you target a toxic player in a non-optimal way), so I also agree some killers need to learn to brush it off better.
---
I‚Äôve been dabbling in killer recently and that‚Äôs what I do too for the most part. Unless the last one was a garbage teammate.
---
1. That running in a straight line is a good way to live (I would even ignore pallets)
---
2. My new friends and I were very conflicted if running or walking everywhere was better. (Instead of doing a mix of both.)
---
Pig mains who let you boop the snoot before killing you are great.
---
when you get a character to level 50 you can prestige them,doing this sets you back to level 1 and deletes all your perks and items and add ons but you save your teach able perks and get a new bloody clothing
---
for survivors you get the bloody torse for prestige 1, bloody pants/shorts for prestige 2 and the bloody face for prestige 3
---
for killers you get the bloody weapon for prestige 1, bloody body for prestige 2 and bloody face for prestige 3
---
I play on ps4 and have to wait a pretty good while for survivor but I get killer games as soon as I press triangle lmao
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e8va22/perk_idea_inspired_by_the_recent_basement_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
You can win against high tier survivers but top tier is a no go for a lot of killers
---
I know right, what a flawed defense that was. It doesn't warrant a response.
---
Mori on death hook defeats the purpose, they should only be usable after everyone has been hooked.
---
Keys are difficult to balance as they are either win more, useless because hatch hasn't spawned,  or a get of trial free card.
---
The only way I see to balance them is to remove the ability to open hatches, change the key into another item, and double down on the aura reading capabilities.
---
yeah, we sound like a broken record because it‚Äôs a good reason dumbass. we don‚Äôt need more because we right. dont ignore facts just because they are actually fucking used. sure, my life isn‚Äôt over because I lost one match. that doesn‚Äôt make dying first hook because I have bad teammates any less frustrating. just because one match doesn‚Äôt matter in the grand scheme of life doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not allowed to be annoyed by what happened in it. With that logic, people shouldn‚Äôt complain about keys, moris, anything overpowered because ‚Äúit‚Äôs only one match omegalul.‚Äù People play video games to have fun, and dbd is heavily reliant on the other players in ur match. If i get an unfun match due to ur teammates, using ur own logic, why do even U care if I tell my teammates not to play like shit? Ur logic is so flawed it‚Äôs painful.
---
You'll get better times as you move up the ranks. At 10-13 it's only a couple minute wait.
---
what streamers? they could just be sarcastic, anyone who has played the game long enough know wraith isnt op
---
If you have Bloodhound teachable, it makes it so you can track someone perfectly in a chase because their blood is bright red and stays for longer.
---
Pyramid head uWu
---
&gt; Moris are an easy balance. Only make it so you can Mori on death hook.
---
This essentially removes them from the game, not balances them. Choosing to mori when you could squeeze out another hook and thereby get BBQ, Dying Light, etc. means you're trading all those interactions for an animation and the time it takes to carry them, some of which is spent in the animation anyway.
---
The problem is the same for moris or keys - you either make kills or escapes substantially easier, or they don't compete with other options.
---
Wait whaat we get to keep teachable perks? That‚Äôs amazing. Thank you!
---
I think he means that sometimes on maps, depending on RNG, a window can spawn open, or closed, and if it's closed there's a different path open. Easiest example I can think of is in one of the farm maps, with the slaughterhouse looking area, and the metal railings surrounding the gen.  Sometimes the map spawns with the window on the left side open, making a god loop, other times it spawns closed, but opens a path through the metal railings instead.
---
Yeah but survivers will still be stronger at the *highest* level than the mid to low tier killers
---
Hey man somebody gotta open that gate and stand by it, pointing with indecision
---
they had their owm animations? that's new to me xd
---
What bug were you experiencing?
---
I‚Äôm rank 2, and still suck at looping killers.
---
I'd say the Oni if you're on PC but on console he's harder to control(still very fun) and I personally find running around and bonking people  insanely fun although if you're looking to win alot spirit is a no brainier. Even after her nerf she still demolishes.
---
Yeah like if they‚Äôre the only one that was just hiding all game and not unhooking or repairing gens they get no mercy
---
take a look at every other constantly developing game like ARK or Rust, with lots more money and staff, they are full of a lot more bugs, its a natural progression with games like this, every update fixes some bugs, but others get introduced, its standard
---
It‚Äôs like cold wind with all those stupid plants
---
Maybe its ths map that would come out with Pyramid Head, the map would have intervals of being enchadowed then being normal.
---
Well, you can run FD and after some hits the key will be destroyed.
---
Sorry for the clip being too long, but I wanted to save this moment
---
Cool?
---
I'm not great at looping, but whenever I manage to hold off a Bubba for awhile, it's either by a) getting a head start (I run SB) and running pallet to pallet, dropping them liberally without trying for a stun, or b) sticking to a tight loop where he can't maneuver his chainsaw easily and getting him to tantrum out.
---
That said, I firmly believe tier lists are mostly for red ranks. They might be relevant at purple, but where I am at green every Killer is deadly.
---
Because it's nothing special. Just the game being rereleased on console with dlc.
---
The other traps are too close. Idk why it still does this
---
Are we really gonna become a subreddit where we rate each other's outfits like some sort of fashion game?
---
Wow dbd actually looks decent on mobile.
---
Yeah that sums up why I play more killer than survivor.  It's not really because I particularly enjoy one role more than the other, I like them both equally, and I tend to play survivor with the 1 or 2 friends I have who are way worse to just mess around and have fun, but the queue times are just so much longer and I just want to play the game.
---
It is a small bonus, but it works.
---
Dude, this is literally the same outfit I've come up with like 2 days ago, she looks like a hard-boiled mechanic or smth
---
I got the game sometime in November, I thought it's intended behavior
---
True.
---
They just gave them to you(the bill sweater and pink cosmetics
---
When I first started playing and watched people move through bloodwebs incomprehensibly quickly, I thought they were magicians. I'd never be able to...
---
...oh, wait, I prefer two to three addons for each killer and use common items simply to get to the next web.
---
To make it a little more clear, percentage values are additive when stacked on each other. So grunts of pain sound reduction is 100% (from iron will) + 50% (from no mither) - 50% (from stridor) ending with a 100% reduction in pain sounds.
---
You're saying the game isn't successful (even saying it is less successful) because they added a non-humanoid killer into the game. I'm at a loss for words so I'll just wish you to have a good rest of your day
---
Mate.  My first comment.  End of second paragraph.  Pay attention.
---
how about this one:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFmhkR33Fgo
---
I hear each time your prestige you rarity from that bloodweb goes up by 1%. 
---
I'd recommend if you are going to prestige go ahead and use up all your pudding, streamers, and any ad-ons you like using before hand and save up points.
---
Congratulations!
---
It should already be available for you. Just go to Bill‚Äôs customization tab and select the torso slot. If it‚Äôs not there, maybe see if there‚Äôs an update available for the game? It was there for me randomly so idk if there‚Äôs a trigger or not.
---
you should find it in the cosmetic section thingy! when it came out it automatically gave you the sweater :D
---
Congrats gamer
---
I think it would be better to give rewards based on the season high not the final rank so people could still play without fear or deranking a tier and missing out on some rewards
---
Except maybe old Object vs stealth killers but they fixed that
---
It happens but I just want to make no mither somewhat viable
---
Yes.
---
this would be better so 3 people dont get to jump ship when they 3 gen themselves in the end
---
Doesnt matter if moris being used arent gonna get you to pip. People dont care about pips. Doesnt matter if they are only used when killers are tilted. Its still unfair for survivors. How do you think they feel when they get killed immediately after being unhooked
---
Better than it was
---
id like to see you try and develop anything, even a no graphic 2d shit fest, and actually see how hard it is to remove all the bugs, to even find them, just develop anything and see how much effort and time has to be put in
---
I saw this in a GAME store a couple of weeks back.
---
Clicker from Last of Us
---
Blind Guy from Don‚Äôt Breath
---
Aliens from A Quiet Place
---
That flashlights were really really frustrating and difficult to deal with as killer.  Over time you learn how to counterplay them in every scenario and they don't seem much more effective than broken keys in my lobbies these days.
---
Me too. Rarely do I play SWF.
---
Here's an idea to not make the EGC completely useless, make the gate lever regress when someone isnt on it. That way survivors cannot 99 the gate anymore and completely circumvent all end game mechanics designed to help the killer.
---
I just derank all the way down to 15 from 6  completed most challenges withing a week tbagged a few killers then ranked back up real quick. Ezpz
---
If you're having this much trouble skip it and save it for last, then when it's remaining just play like normal and the next time you see someone hooked during EGC prioritize that safe unhook over everything else.
---
Lucky :/
---
and ghosty boi too ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
It depends on time of day and your internet and location.
---
If you run Whispers it purrs when survivors are near
---
You know that animation when killer picks up a survivour? Well, you can blind the killer while he is picking the guy up, you don't have to save the survivour to actually make it count
---
Yeah he's referring to the rng involved in the tile generation where the game decides which window in the buildings to open and which ones to leave boarded up and unusable in game.
---
\&gt;Pig  
---
\&gt;Red ranks  
---
\&gt;Make Your Choice  
---
Pick two.
---
i played killer first, so I thought all survivors were morons bc i didn‚Äôt know that only i saw scratch marks. 
---
the person that introduced me to the game once told me that he didnt know camping and tunneling was bad. he just found the game, no one guided him so he didnt figure out how much they hated it until he got hate messages.
---
Nah I'm good.
---
I thought I was good.
---
You don't mention if you play solo, but easiest for me was to find someone willing to sacrifice himself for one game, Borrowed Time him, then trade spots. It's helpful too because you can let the other two survivors leave, essentially ensuring _you_ get the unhook.
---
It may sound difficult if you don't have folks around, but the effort to be social is easier in this case than hoping for the stars to align.
---
Play with a friend and ask him to intentionally get downed during endgame so he can get put on a hook for you to rescue.
---
Because you think you have the right to police how other people play the game, that's the problem. Because you're fragile little ego can't stand not escaping every match. I'm going to start running it every single time I play Survivor just to piss off people like you. The point is stop trying to make other people feel bad for the way they play the game.
---
I‚Äôve been doing this for days lol
---
great idea, ability definitely needs changes along with the perks

that billy one is my favorite

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e8vlr1/oni_cosplay/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

---
Then don't worry about it and let it come naturally, I believe in you :)
---
I actually just did it! Woooh-ee!
---
Early Advantage seems broken.  Can't give that type of speed boost to killers.  Just run it on instadown killers while you rack up down after down since you only lose 1 token per hit and they can instadown.  Throw it on Bubba for a tier jump right there lol.  That type of speed would be uncounterable for the first couple downs.

some might be kidding, but tru3ta1ent legit thinks wraith is top 4

---
Huh, that‚Äôs a strange one. I guess I‚Äôm not so used to seeing no one left behind and lithe, the most underused exhaustion perk.
---
I personally run iron will, dead hard, adrenaline, hope
---
I just recently started using iron will + dead hard and it‚Äôs now one of my most favorite combos
---
Was a bug on that map. IIRC devs recently changed the spawn of the tree in that tile so that you can walk between the wall and tree.
---
That man tall
---
Fucking hell
---
So what is a hill-billy? Fast moving guy with a one-shot capabilities. So Bbq is a really good choice, since he can see survivours on the other side of the map and close the gap quickly, putting pressure. Next good choice would be Pop Goes The Weasel, since when you see survivours, whey usually work on gens, so interrupt then and killing the progress would feel so good. Then you can have Ruin/Corrupt Intervention, it depends on what you consider more viable, either limiting the area you work with in the early game, or make survivours suffer through red skill-checks and make them look for a totem which is a waste of time as well. Last but not the least, Whisperes or Eduring. It again depends on how you want to play and where do you have problems during the match. If there is a problem with tracking, use Whisperes, and if you need help during chases, you can rush every pallet and have almost no penalty for doing so, using Eduring.
---
So: Bbq+Pop are really good, Ruin/Corrupt, and Whisperes /Eduring. Good luck in the fog.
---
Its like nobody even bothered to read the post. Jesus.
---
You said ‚Äúyou‚Äôll soon notice‚Äù when I probably have more playtime than you, hence the ‚Äúarbitrary‚Äù rank drop. Ummm, have fun not sending ggs?
---
It‚Äôs my play style, especially after the changes to No One Left Behind
---
No we don't
---
Nope, so move along with your attitude.
---
if you let a killer hit you then thats your fault.
---
if you bump into somthing thats your fault.
---
SB is a really good counter to nurse.
---
Ig?
---
yeah he had bt and ds and I was dead on hook so the killer just killed me lol
---
Such a good arguments, guess you are a AI who never make any mistakes
---
Because he was on here about him playing DBD I guessed him on Masked Singer lol. Never heard of him until a few days ago.
---
No, it doesn't. Let me reiterate, then. No *smart* killer will slug a No Mither.
---
The wait time for a match is fucking unbearable
---
Huntress at least still throws her hatchets in the lobby, which is better than nothing.
---
Eh I've heard he's actually been trashtalking killers and gets carried by a swf so I wouldn't say we forgive him
---
Bill doesnt deserve this, he should be in peace dammit!
---
After seeing the video Bhvr took the only logical next step and nerfed Pig
---
GUYS STOP DOWNVOTING HE'S BRINGING POPULARITY TO THE GAME THAT'S ALL IT MATTERS.

You lose add one Everytime as killer

You won't lose anything if you survive and also bring items from trials

&gt; I wish there were mode game modes implemented as well
---
nah fuck that
---
Nurse came with my Xbox special edition but Huntress was free DLC I had to download from the store
---
Yes, that would be purrfect
---
Honestly I find more nice killers than survivors. I play both sides and almost anytime I get a toxic or nasty message is usually from a survivor. Either as killer, or as their teammate.
---
Honestly out of all the games to take seriously, why is it DBD? Maybe this is just my opinion, but DBD shouldn't be taken seriously at all, just play and have fun.
---
But no, why play a game for fun nowadays, right?
---
Except he says "on first, second, and death hook" which would put you on a hook and exactly way would that be better then your teammates seeing his aura?
---
Hmmmm I love using Commando Proüòçüíñ
---
Nope next time search up sweater and you‚Äôll find your answer:)
---
I think you mean he's bringing 12 year olds that will whine when things don't go there way. This community is enough of a trash heap so I don't think adding more garbage will help(not referring to people as garbage more so people's personalities)
---
Weird that pyramid head is in silent hill 3 then... and weird how his daughter HEATHER who is actually alive would have nothing to do with pyramid head
---
I actually enjoyed his video on the game and if it increases the popularity of the game then I'm all for it.
---
For me it's the opposite. Sometimes, in specially active matches where I get chased or when I keep close to the killer, my limbs go numb for the stress of having to keep hidden. I think I don't have the guts for playing survivor. On the other hand, also being a bit stressful, killer feels really good, it's being the chaser.
---
It could be  because I'm fairly new to the game, but I prefer killer.  Side note: I recently made to rank 18 on killer. I dropped out survivor in rank 16.
---
Time to finish up all my add-ons before they remove Wraith from the game I guess
---
Basic guide:
---
Each killer and survivor has 3 teachable perks that can be unlocked after you level them up to lvl 30, 35 and 40.
---
Teachable perks look different in the blood web, they are orange in color, once unlocked those perks will be able to appear in any other survivor/killer bloodweb respectively.
---
Once your character level is higher than the teachable requirement it will keep appearing in your bloodweb until you unlock it.
---
Alternatively you can unlock teachable perks using the shrine of secrets without owning the character, each week 4 different teachable perks will appear, 2 for killer 2 for survivor.
---
^this so much, op it‚Äôs okay to trace as it builds up confidence but you gotta credit the artist since it isn‚Äôt your creation.
---
&gt; you can infinitely repeat waking each other up
---
Good luck with that, each consecutive wake up takes much longer than the last.
---
Update: the same bug happened again and now he has decisive strike, and he has inner strength on the bloodweb to pick.
---
everything on reddit is a repost of something else, get over it
---
That sounds like a great idea, but maybe we could add a perk named "I'll be back." or something like that. I'm not sure what the perk's effect would be but it could involve being able to move a little faster when you lose a survivor you're chasing, or your stun can have a chance to last less time.
---
The survivor to counteract him could be Sarah or John Connor, with perks involving better stuns or better repair abilities.
---
Plus maybe the map that goes along with the characters could be the police station or the government bunker we see in the movies.
---
Enjoy hell
---
Right at the buzzer!
---
New game modes* No harm in having some new options to keep things fun. You can "fuck that ", all you want though lol.
---
The question is, how would they make them different other than just thier perks and face.
---
For the last time. U realise the design team and gameplay mechanics team are completely different things?
---
Love the art direction.  Keep em coming.  We need cool shit like this to break up all the salt and toxicity posts on here.
---
Yes!
---
Well the only killers I ever reached red ranks with were Doctor and Legion, that comes down to personal experience with each killer. It would come down to how much you know the killer. This goes back to my original point, just because it's substantially easier for a master Nurse player to 4k, doesn't mean it's impossible for a good leatherface to do the same, even if more challenging.
---
They should also fix the spawns on some maps like Crotus Penn. Bedham preschool is a good example of amazing totems spawns being snuggled between bushes and trees being really difficult to find. Crotus on the other hand, oh boy.
---
It's a shame this will never happen because... well, Konami is Konami.
---
*u h*
---
I know what you meant
---
The primary issue is that the game has a healthy userbase, but not one large enough to accommodate that split
---
Oh, you‚Äôre right.
---
I should stop giving people hatch
---
This is all I think of when I hear "The Machine."
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paG1-lPtIXA&amp;t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paG1-lPtIXA&amp;t=4s) 
---
I dig your idea, though!
---
Leatherface doesn't get to use the chainsaw unless you stand there and wraith has no chase utility.
---
Use their "stories" as inspiration. Meg being atheletic... Feng being a gamer... Kate being a singer... etc.
---
Nah I used to have long hair and I know what am talking about too, this is not the same length my man
---
i loved that video nice to now im not the only person who watches him
---
Actually yea that could work.
---
Some of us are, don't lose hope. =)
---
This is true. I‚Äôm a red rank pig main but I run every meta perk in the books, so no MYC
---
The doctor is a great killer to start with because of how easy it is for him to gain BP.
---
My recommendation is to keep using him until level 50 then use the bp you earn from the doctor to level up another killer until you either get their teachables thena bandon them OR until you have also decent perks on the next killer to start using it.
---
Also, your best bet right now for new perks might be the shrine of secrets so just keep playing and save shards in case something good appears on the shrine.
---
Aren't all insta-downs effectively like that? That's what makes them so brutal. It cuts chase time way down which means that survivors have to save their allies more. As for Wraith, I don't think he's good, but he's at least better than Clown and Doctor.
---
My primary point was that saying "any killer can be strong if you're good" in response to conversations about tiers or viability is ignoring that you make those arguments assuming the person playing them is good. It's like saying "this boat doesn't rust" then some one saying "all boats can rust if it comes in contact with water." The assumption was already made.
---
As for testing the viability of the killer you wouldn't play randos and hope you get the sweat squad, you would just contact the sweat squad and say "hey what up let's test some things" and run matches against them. It'd be like me playing Beerus in DBFZ then declaring him high tier our tournament viable because I keep beating the randos I find in ranked.
---
One of the weaknesses with feeling out tiers in DBD is the lack of a proper competitive scene. If I think Beerus is top tier I'd get that shit sorted out real quick at Evo when some one tries to play him against people who play the game professionally. If I think bubba is top tier in DBD, well there's no DBD Evo. Dead By Daylight doesn't even have a Final Destination, even a sweat squad can get a real bad map.
---
Have they confirmed when the worldwide release for DBD Mobile is?
---
I just noticed you were still going on about that developing argument. Dude, if you pay for any fucken service and that professional you paid doesn't fix it right, are you going to sit there to yourself with that same " Well it's not like I can do any better". It's their damn job lol. I've taken several programming classes and have a little experience with game development. It still isn't acceptable. Your argument is fallacious.
---
Ofc i make mistakes, but thats not the perks fault, nor have i made those mistakes.
---
Skill checks do not though. Either way it's easy and necessary to wake up.
---
I thought survivors could only sometimes see across the map when another survicor messed up a gen skillcheck. Turns out it was a destruction of a Hex totem...
---
Does it include Inner Strength healing?
---
You mentioned waking up another survivor, so that's what I was talking about. Also, skillchecks from gens become harder and harder to get as the game goes on and more gens get completed. So it will take longer to wake up as the game goes on.
---
Last Year even though it seems like the same type of game is completely different. It's more about setting traps and surprise attacks. I would love a spider type killer or another crazy looking killer but I don't think it would work in DBD. They could maybe make a half breed human spider though.
---
**Marked For Termination** 
---
3/5/15. Wtf is this scaling? 4/5/10 is also not good. Tier 1 should have at least 70% of the Tier 3 power.
---
Make only one value scale. I'd set it to always be 16m and duration to be 8/10/12 seconds.
---
Perk still sounds weak but has synergy with Nemesis
---
**Phone Book Killer**
---
1/2/3%. Those values are almost non-existent. Deep Wound duration should also be listed.
---
Set faster cooldown to 15/20/25% and deep wound to 16 seconds at all tiers.
---
**Model 101** 
---
1/2/3 seconds. The same thing. what's the difference between 60 and 61s effect? 1/3/5 is also a terrible scaling.
---
20/25/30 seconds longer. Deep Wound (which isn't a status effect btw) should, again always be reduced by the same amount as you don't want too many things to scale. (set to always 4 seconds)
---
Surprised that someone hasn‚Äôt posted all the post of people asking about how they got an ultra rare cosmetics yet
---
But it won't matter since the more gens done, the less Freddy can teleport. It really matters to wake up mid game, when he's at his strongest.
---
Is there a way in? Me and a friend are growing impatient
---
I didnt jump ship completely, ill play with solo survivors or 2 2man swfs but i dodge everytime its a 3 or 4 man. So if i have to dodge like 5 lobbies in a row i just switch to another game. Id love to host more lobbies for you red ranks but im not about to get fucked by swfs all day sorry :/
---
This feels like it'll kill Haunted unless it's definitely carried with some other hex perk, since by the end of the immunity window they'll probably know if you have anything else. It definitely hurts Inner Strength.
---
I wonder if you could make cleansed hexes (other than Haunted) move to surviving dulls. The curse finds a new home unless it doesn't. By the process of elimination, the hardest-to-find or best-protected totems will end up with the surviving hexes. It doesn't put a hard stop to the survivors' efforts, but it does mean that your job is harder if you want hexes gone.

I was mainly referring to the game speed overall. I don't heal against Legion. I just run ded ard in case it's the more plague. My teammates however are always the worst thing on the planet and choose to self care against Legion with sloppy Butcher and thanat.
---
Hard to not want to heal when the killer has four stacks of thanat.
---
these are all great suggestions

NO the endgame colapse never killed me once

Yeah exactly! It‚Äôs just hide and seek with blood!

---
Thickening the fog just makes it a bit more difficult to see distance. Lessening the fog does the opposite. Generally, the killer will want better visibility, and the survivors will want less visibility unless they are facing a killer like Ghostface or The Pig.

It‚Äôs so weird to see posts where people are like ‚Äúthe skins are too expensive imo. I do not want to buy them at this price. So I will not‚Äù

It can be worth more than just 600 points. Keep in mind that using a special hit (hatchet, phase-strike, etc). It can also be the difference between pipping and not.
---
Mikey is weirder than usual these daysüòÇ
---
Not much really. Thick fog might help to hide survivors and help them blend in. It may help to hide traps and thrown hatchets. But overall I'd say it doesn't have much effect besides adding atmosphere. Though it does irritate me when the fog is really thick and I'm playing killer so maybe it does have a bigger effect than I think.
---
Woop, woop
---
The killer has almost no reason to check the basement and the survivors get BP for staying in there so it‚Äôs a real good spot to hide
---
Meme makes no sense. Nothing implied he was slugging. 
---
0/10. Try again.
---
It's probably uploading right now, the file size must have been large.
---
That is my cats name
---
It's a mixture of bad sensitivity and skill. I have Oni prestige 1 right now and since I've started I've gotten to the point where I demolish survivors because when I demon dash I try to predict how the survivors will move to avoid it, and see how they react and how my add-ons will effect my success rate.   a Oni with faster Add-ons will be able to succeed more as he gets to them faster and barely gives time for them to counter, for demon strike walking back does the trick because a up close survivor is harder to track. Oni is a very high skill cap killer even more so on console but when you learn him he's great.
---
Y'know, your scaling is a helluva lot better
---
I always end up with weak ass perks and I guess the scaling is what makes it sound so shit
---
I've yet to see anyone say that it's physically impossible to climb with any particular killer. And in all honesty, how the game is setup for many players it IS impossible. Not everyone has the time to learn to use all 13 killers effectively, they don't have time to collect the necessary BPs to unlock all the perks, and they don't have the time to farm for perks from the shrine of secrets. I know streamers and YouTubers will play with random builds and show they can win with those, most of those people have thousands of hours in the game and you can't really use them as an example for the average person.
---
So when you say "the game is balanced" there are a LOT of aspects you're completely ignoring, which is where my comment is direct. Sure, it's POSSIBLE to use any killer at any rank, it isn't even close to being balanced.
---
I remember when everybody kept saying Dedicated servers would fix the hitbox issue and it's only gotten worse lmao
---
Your account is full of reposts that's why you don't mind
---
entity shenanigans keeps the kitty healthy
---
What rank are you? Because red ranks spin me the fuck around with oni.
---
his flick is 100% worse on console, but the regular instadown attack he has is fine. you know you only have to charge it for a second for the instadown right? don't have to go through the entire animation
---
Right?
---
Yes, which goes back to the game not being balanced and that the effectiveness of killers has more to do with aspects other than the killer being discussed.
---
Goodjob.
---
Nothing in the Gatekeeper category? Damn a couple gens must've went up fast at the start. You safety pipped at least. Just barely tho :(.
---
i believe they said sometime in 2019. so, soon.. unless i‚Äôm wrong?
---
I've went against red ranks and purple ranks around there but rank 10 or so(I don't think rank matters much as most actually derank too to around my rank)
---
literally everybody on console just stands there until I force them out, and they never let me hit them :(
---
I mean, sometimes I wait if I still have teammates in the match so the killer has to waste time forcing me out, but when everybody's in the exit gate and you're not getting extra points for healing or something it just feels like a dick move.
---
Not really, at least in my experiences with him. Usually by the time you come across a survivor doing something and you see their aura, the survivor will hear your footsteps and start running. If they don‚Äôt hear footsteps they‚Äôll hear the bell, which in that case is sort of better for the wraith player since he gets the little speed boost to get a hit off early in the chase. Using that add on with any of the clapper addons is a broken combo imo.
---
Everything but oni
---
Hmmmmmm I wonder what that thing glowing in the middle of a wide open area is?
---
I like to watch him, because he looks like he‚Äôs enjoying what he‚Äôs doing.
---
Wasn't going to leave my friend behind  :)
---
Have only played him for a day, but I really suck with him. I usually play Huntress, so I'm used to the bad sensitivity on Console and can predict survivors movement alright. But with Oni I can't hit shit. I don't even see how I will get better, because I can't even see how I missed the survivors. I just press attack and they're gone.
---
Could offer constructive criticism
---
 Cheers  :)
---
We already have a trapperino guy
---
i wouldnt really say its your drawing, its ok to trace as long as you use your eyes, thats what i did when i first started, but please credit the original &lt;3
---
I just figured this out today and oh Lord does it help a bunch. I usually missed because I was waiting for the animation to finish giving them time to react but since I've learned he has barely any charge time to one shot it's been easier.
---
I could see the pallet one being really useful but not the gen one.
---
Either that or there are too many killers at your rank waiting around for not enough survivors. The higher ranks you get the more people gravitate towards Survivor so Killer times become really fast.
---
Its the video clip, the gameplay actually runs smooth at 60fps
---
I even had ruin and pop. The game lastes somewhat like 3 or 4 minutes, even though I was constantly hooking people in the basement with billy smh
---
Will you be doing the art for oni at some point? I'd love to see what you can do for bam bam
---
Since we're talking about exhaustion perks, Getting a boost of speed after you finish a generator would be hard counter by Mindbreaker, which would make it the only exhaustion perk that has a hard counter to using it.
---
I mean, these aren't bad but no matter what they release I'm still repping dead hard gang no matter whatüòé On a serious note the pallet drop thing sounds cool but how about it activates on a killer stun? It'd be a nice counter to spirit fury/enduring.
---
Saying a killer is viable while only using his best add-ons. Using that logic we could say Clown is viable if you only used his instadown add-on.
---
But doesn‚Äôt mindbreaker only work on gens that are below 50% progress?
---
I assume by hook trade you mean rescuing someone from the hook only to be immediately hooked themselves? If so, the main reason is usually going to be that the person is being chased and going to die, so they go for the unhook in the hopes of getting some extra points. They're also saving someone else before they get hooked so that can be a good thing, unless the killer goes straight for them anyway. 
---
If the person is on the hook is about to reach the struggle phase, then trading places with them might be a good idea because having two survivors hooked once is probably better than one survivor hooked twice. That's because it means they're only one hook away from dying, AND the entire team actually lose points in altruism if a survivor isn't rescued from the hook before struggle phase. 
---
To summarise, try and avoid hook trading because it's not really accomplishing anything. But there are some cases where it's worth it.
---
Literally happened to me last night üí™üèº
---
Object of obsession nerf.
---
It only applies exhausted on you when you start one below 50 progress. But it also has "Any existing ***Exhaustion*** **Status Effect** timers are paused while the Survivor is repairing a Generator. After ending the Repair action, the Survivor is afflicted by the ***Exhausted*** **Status Effect** for **1 second**."
---
Look, Jason has his own game. His abilities wouldn't be too interesting and it wouldn't be creative. I very much prefer creative storywriting like with the Oni than adding every EXISTING Horrormovie Protagonist in existence. That's why I like the Huntress, the Wraith, Hillbilly, Spirit and the Oni most. They're original.
---
The only way I'd trust a tier list for killers is if said person made it based on collecting more info than most people have to date. They'd need to record their rank, hours played, each survivors rank, the average rank of the survivors, time played from each survivor, perks used by survivor, etc. Otherwise most of the ranking and talk is anecdotal and you could say "x is the best because look how effective I was at getting 4ks in with y killer." Outside of killers like Nurse and Spirit I don't know how ppl can give an accurate read on killers being good or not.
---
Yeah I kinda feel like if you're running Sprint Burst, if you're doing a gen the cooldown should expire by the time you're done. Then it's meep meep all over again to the next one. =)
---
bruh.... just bruh

---
I actually really like this but more in the way one would like distressing or beast of prey cause it gives more points, yeah it's alright.
---
Gotta choose early on how you want to use your portals, then go for add-ons to enhance your portal gameplay. I prefer a portal build that makes Undetectable last longer when exiting a portal, but the ones that increase detection range or portal movement speed are also viable. Figure out what suits your play style.
---
Also, it helps to plan out where you want to put your first handful of portals at the start of a game.
---
It does. I'll be sure to record it for you.
---
My Killer is rank 14 since I haven't played the role much in a few resets, and all my queues are 10-20 minutes and I end up in full purple/reds. The main thing that bothers me is the horrendous wait time, so I can't even get up to where I belong.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019#latest
---
&gt; Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
This is when it started, 3 months ago. Considering the experience people have been having for months, I have to laugh at the irony of the reasoning they gave.
---
Basically, *sometimes* you would have *one* high rank survivor playing with a bunch of low rank people to "abuse" matchmaking, and they used it as an excuse for a change *that completely fucks matchmaking and queue times for anyone that isn't a red rank killer*.
---
To top it all off, anyone trying to get into the game with an experienced friend has their matches be a complete stomp because they're constantly forced to go against experienced killers when they barely know what a skillcheck is, let alone how to run and use pallets.
---
This also has an effect on Killer, because the higher you rank, the more new players you face because they're dragged into your games with their high rank friends, making red rank killer almost no challenge at all in 90% of matches.
---
My in-game name is basically "I suck" and I really do. Not sure how I got to rank 1 only by using stealth
---
Seriously, I WISH I was only being paired with people 4 ranks off from me
---
That's great, still waiting for a fix for killers getting stuck to generators, getting stuck to lockers, and being blinded by the flashlight and their vision not returning.
---
Fix your game BHVR
---
Congrats mate, i've just achieved rank 1 with my baby huntress today
---
The game ranking killers as easy - hard doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not balanced lol...  They‚Äôre differing styles and some are just easier to play while others are harder but excel when you play well. 
---
You‚Äôre supposed to build your killer to either boost your power spike that it covers your weaknesses OR cover your weaknesses from the start and play your fundamentals well enough that it doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs why we have early game killers that can truck survivors in 2-4 minutes and others that it feels hopeless with 4 gens left on the map. 
---
It all comes down to building to your play style, killer, and sometimes map. Unfortunately in the end everyone flocks to the most consistent killer/perks because honestly it‚Äôs the path of least resistance... though everyone does that until a clown main rolls up and smashes your hopes and dreams

I think he's pretty good on consoles. Not going to say that he's just as good as in PC because console is limited by FPS and lower sensitivity. But you can still make some decent plays, and his map pressure is among the best. I have him at P3 LV. 50 at this point. Been playing him lots, just as much as my main Huntress. It's tough to land shots at times but I think with time and patience, you can be quite lethal with him.
---
Yui and onis entire dlc is 7 dollars. And that comes with 2 characters and 6 perks. The outfits are clearly way overpriced then if im only paying for "one new character" that is just a reskin.

If there's an obsession in the game, it means a killer or survivor is using an obsession perk. There's a whole bunch of them for both survivor and killer, and a small number of add-ons. The effect that being the obsession has depends on which perk it is. 
---
You say they beelined straight to you: being the obsession probably won't make this happen so maybe they saw you go in the locker or something? It may be that they had a perk that shows your aura to them such as BBQ &amp; Chilli that reveals your aura when they hook someone, or bitter murmur, that reveals auras when you do a generator. There are others too. 
---
There's a full list of obsession perks and their uses here:  [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Obsession](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Obsession)
---
The problem about mori is the fact that it reward tunneling and camping. Mori should become active for a survivor only if the killer put on hook another survivor. To mori the second survivor that has been hooked, the killer must hook another one. Same for the third. Last one is dead anyway, let him die with a cool animation!
---
The only unbalanced thing about key is the fact that hatch spawn even with zero generators repaired.Equip a key in lobby it's a suicide since every killer will focus on you, finding one during a match is very rare, if you find one and manage to escape you deserve it!
---
He's a high skill killer, I'd say he's probably a tier or two down from the PC version but you can just demolish with him with practice/luck.
---
I mean to be fair you lead your post with an inaccurate statement.  Dude just politely corrected it.  I think that's fair.
---
The post is labeled "suggestion", and in the title I said they should lower it. I dont understand your point, but I think you're a fool if you pay this much money for nearly nothing. Im just saying that the skins should be less, or they should offer bundles at the price they are currently selling.
---
In my opinion (killer main) flashlight saves and bodyblocking are parts of the game and legitimate strategies. Being though I agree is very annoying. But the worst is the endgame chat.
---
And Oni‚Äôs power would be redundant if he can one shot everyone anyways
---
Good headset helps with audio.
---
Increasing gamma helps with video. In Windows, search for Calibrate Display Color setting. Drag that window to the monitor you run DBD on. Click next until you get to the gamma slider. Adjust to your liking and alt-tab to your game without clicking next or exiting out of the gamma slider. When you are done with DBD, cancel out of the calibration.

What would this look like if he played against a nurse? O_o He'd scratch his own throat open
---
He has limitations on console, but he‚Äôs still a fun killer to play. A lot of people saying he is terrible just aren‚Äôt good as killer imo I‚Äôve been doing well with him. Very few bad matches but I like him.

Couldn't be more accurate.

There are folk out there that can‚Äôt play Freddy and do well on Clown, it‚Äôs just a difference in play.

The end of your post seems to contradict what you said, the killer is viable but you lack game knowledge to make it work. 
---
That‚Äôs not the killers fault, and you even pointed it out?  You shouldn‚Äôt be able to just pick up any killer at red ranks - they‚Äôre very different styles most of the time with some sharing some fundamentals but like in the end just because I can run legion at red doesn‚Äôt make me any better at Trapper to do it as well.
---
No way if he‚Äôs applying constant pressure I said. I don‚Äôt doubt it lasted that long, I doubt the pressure.
---
Lol no, because the devs said they didn't like it doesn't make what you said a fact at all.
---
I think you‚Äôre missing the point. We don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a detection issue, hitbox issue, latency issue, or whatever kind of issue it may be, we just want BHVR to fix it so we don‚Äôt get hit through pallets and windows
---
I hate the purple ranks. Never had as many fellow survivors DC and play as selfishly as purple ranks. Also a lot more killer DCs when their Ruin gets destroyed and the team can successfully run them around and do gens.
---
I'm looking forward to rank reset.
---
Yeah that's what I meant lmao
---
Everything except the Oni.
---
Same thing happened to me last night quite a few times. The game just disconnected all of us, while we were still together and able to talk in the chat. =/
---
The best way to look at hit detection 'issues' is by thinking of the game like its a game of Tag (which dbd kind of is). In most child hood games of Tag, if the person who is IT (the killer) says the tagged you, and it made since from their perspective that they tagged you, they tagged you. Even if it doesnt look like it on your screen, and it looked like that hit was bullshit to you, to the killer from their perspective you were with in a few meters, they swung and they made contact.
---
The only time I have thought of this to be false is when I was playing New Nurse on Red Forest. It has that tile that is a hill with two areas to go up, a wall and a cliff on the fourth side. Ash fell off the cliff and I blink to him, end up on the otherside of him and swing and hit him somehow. I was going to let him free because that hit was bullshit but he DC'd
---
Thank you!!

What rank are you? At rank 1 I get matches in under 5 minutes
---
Do survivors lose pip if killers dc. I only play killer and I thought that survivors black pipped at the minimum
---
No matter what, even if it's not fun to be camped, face camping is not a reportable offence. I do not recommend face camping myself but sometimes it is a valid strategy.
---
A survivor who t-bags is a survivor not doing gens / running away, it goes to the killers favor. Facecamping also makes the game easier for the remaining 3 survivors, and I think the dev has said it's an "allowed" playstyle. Though how many bloodpoints / pips the killer will get is not gonna be a lot.

I play pretty selflessly, usually getting myself killed if I know it'll benefit the team. I haven't had many killers DC, but I have seen a lot of ruin.

---
I didn't tbag haha not even a little.
---
The pig does make the cutest noise when she gets stunned...
---
The upside with dropping keys tho is if they dont have plunders its going to be a bit time consuming trying to find it again
---
I run it sometimes, but that's mostly due to lack of better options. The moment i can get my hands on M&amp;A, it's never being used again.
---
Current rank system couldnt handle this. Far too easy to pip and would cause massive proliferation of high rank players. Maybe if they made it easier to derank it would be better. Personally i feel like after rank 10 or so they should remove saftey pips if they were to go for a longer season
---
Idk I mainly play survivor but if I play killer I never use noed because it's so annoying as survivor but that may be just me
---
speed after dropping pallet sounds rly strong
---
Tru3 I think, he's been making that claim for a while now.
---
It depends on what you did in the game. I repaired like 3 gens and ran the killer around til she gave up. But yeah, if killers dc early survivors lose pips or that's how I remember the game being. I dont know if they changed it but that must mean they had to take away the pip i earned in that match as well. And I did get a pip for that match so idk.
---
Soon all dc will be dealt with in a manner deemed appropriate by BHVR standards. 
---
Personally I wouldn't care because I like to keep my ranks as far from red as possible as I don't want to have to "sweat" every game or wait in long queue times.
---
I main her at red ranks, but i do often say fuck it and switch to Spirit or Freddy if i've had a particularly toxic team the previous match.
---
Why tf are those wrinkles even there, who has wrinkles like that aside from boomers?
---
I'd say Demo's are a bit worse. Trapper's can work as soon as you set one, whereas Demo has to have at least two in order to teleport. and there's no point to placing two unless you put them quite some distance from each other, which means you have to go across the level to find one good spot, then go across the level again to find another. All the while taking time away from hunting and chasing survivors, your objective. So most of the time, you end up using them to make up the time you lost by prepping them. And you likely won't start in a good place to put portals either.
---
and Trapper's add ons tend to make his traps' base functionality stronger, which Demo's add ons don't do much if anything for his portals. 
---
also unless you have an aura reading perk that reveals a person near a portal that isn't activated, the only dangerous portals are the activated ones, which are so conspicuous they're quickly deleted by survivors before you can do anything with them.
---
‚ÄúI got a 3k bc they wanted the 4 man escape‚Äù
---
They all hung around after the gens were done, there‚Äôs your answer.
---
I fear to know where this is going
---
I mean... she does....
---
Haha I respect that. I personally enjoy getting into the red ranks and "sweating" every game. I don't find it fun looping a rank 10 for 3 minutes and escaping.
---
Deadass had a game as Huntress in purple ranks, and this Kate couldn't loop for shit. Every time I started a chase she ran into a wall, and rarely fast vaulted. I genuinely thought she was some rank 17 that got fucked by the queue system. The rest of her team played great and were as low as rank 8.
---
Turns out this Kate was rank 2. I don't get how you can be that bad at looping and be rank 2.
---
No map movement is huge my guy. Theres a reason plague is trash, its cause she is effectively a m1 killer with permanent exposed and only better if survs are dumb
---
it looks like they just removed all of the shadows and somehow that worked out, guess shadows are more taxing than we like to think
---
And general equipment. Bear traps and RBTs would be nice
---
Because the survivors stayed waaaaaaaaay too long. Also EGC is too long. why slow it because someone got downed? too much coddling.
---
Something good for the strangle would be to have it start as a high percent chance of it even happening, say 75% chance to get a skill check to break free and then that way some of Pyramid Heads addons could be to reduce this percent chance. One ultra rare could be to always have it be 0% chance. What do you think about it?
---
You and your friend look like idiots
---
How u manage to play this? Beta tester?
---
It's very helpful, but i wouldn't say it's mandatory. Check out Scorpionz on twitch, he mains Pig in red ranks without any slowdown perk whatsoever, and he still 4ks.
---
As survivor I wouldn't be able to get to red ranks atm as I'm poor at running killers. But even If I could I'd only run random perk wheels.
---
original killers doesnt mean they have original powers, they stoped doing new powers, look at oni, its literally billy and myers, its not that the chapter is licensed or not, it is the lack of creativity to devs.
---
Demodoggo running up to a generator with two people on it and immediately starts working on it.
---
I think that the pig is able to tunnel much better than other killers because you need some time away from the killer to get the trap off. However I think she isn‚Äôt op. She just needs a buff and a change to easy tunneling.
---
So you think they were just letting themselves get hit and downed?
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
Except he's not... He DOES appear in Homecoming but he's "The Boogeyman", looks more like the film version than the SH2 version, and still fills the role of punisher... But that's Homecoming, he only appears in 3 in like a painting.
---
SH3 has Valtiel, who fills a completely different roll and doesn't even have anything on his head, much less the iconic pyramid.
---
So you literally only speak in idiot and memes. Yeah that sounds about right
---
He did that in the original too. Loomis and Sheriff Brackett find a dead dog in the Myers house, Loomis touches it and says it's still warm then says myers must have gotten hungry
---
If I kill three (as I did here) I don't use NoEd. I only use it if I get bullied all game and have nothing to show for it.
---
Damn straight
---
They dont mean those animation, they mean while your in the lobby with your back turned to the camera in the corner
---
Basing things you say on assumptions won‚Äôt prove your point; I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a way to track hours played on ps4, but if you know of one, and want to.. by all means, feel free. 
---
HeY sAyInG gGs WiLl EnD tOxIcItY.
---
It won‚Äôt, but at least you‚Äôre no longer toxic?
---
Fair enough then
---
well yeah, but the bits you can see look nice.
---
I‚Äôm on this grind right now lol. At 2 trying to get to 1 and I can‚Äôt really loop. Somehow I‚Äôve been better against red rank killers then purple though ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
He wasn't in Silent Hill 3? Only in Silent Hill 2 and those bad movies which aren't canon.
---
Yeah I mean it helps.  Or it can help at least.  Keys are just really rough to counterplay in general.  Franklin's becomes a must.  It's limited counterplay but it's still the best option we got.  But yeah I don't see the durability effect ever helping against keys.  Unlike flashlights or boxes you just don't spend charges prior to ending games with it through the hatch.
---
I do it through a mixture of luck, panic, and doing my best not to be mindgamed (meaning I do suck at the really unsafe pallets where I can't keep LOS of the killer on, but do pretty well at safe pallets).
---
That and the fact that the movement speed bonus for being hit, combined with the killer being immobile wiping their blade, is ridiculously unfair to killers without extra mobility or general.
---
Even just sprinting away afterward in a straight line gives you a good 40 seconds of distance if you can keep the chase broken with an obstacle so they don't get bloodlust, letting the other 3 survivors do 50% of a generator each + however much time you spent looping before the hit + however much time you spend looping after the hit + needing to be hooked + the killer having to reach one of the other survivors if they hope to stop one of those generators (if for any reason 3 haven't popped yet) from popping.
---
Like when you think about the loops and safe pallets in the game, it takes a hilarious amount of time to down someone even if they only use two safe loops per chase, one before the hit and one after, just pick one you can always see the killer around and ride it out, they'll lose if they commit to it unless no one is on gens, you don't even need SWF, just smart solos.
---
Until they fix the bugs every copy of the game is nightmare edition.
---
Don't know/don't care about the rights-and-wrongs of BP ethics but if yellow is your friend then please find a new one.
---
Sees Claudette running to a killer shack: Where are you going? Hey wait, stop! Static intesifies.
---
Pipping =/= being a good killer. Just saying.
---
To be fair- they do have sales throughout the year on outfits. Also we can pay with shards. It's a matter of either being patient or paying full price. That's how it is with a lot of things.
---
Never said it was lol. Camping is also absolutely necessary sometimes, but when a leather face face camps everyone first hook I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a dick move for the last survivor to t-bag on hatch
---
That would be OP as shit.
---
Give the succ, get the hatch.
---
They hated him because he told them the canon.
---
Yeah I probably need more frineds
---
Well, considering that there never were and never will be new ideas, but just old knowledge reshaped, I think that is an impossible thing anyways. But in all seriousness, it isn't easy to come up with new powers that would actually fit the game. Look at the Killer ideas on this sub. Half of them also use a already known mechanic and tweak them to make them different and better, the other half is original but also incredibly unbalanced. I don't think they are trying their best, but they are also not lazy.
---
&gt; even though I was constantly hooking people in the basement with billy smh
---
No wonder you couldn't pressure survivors... Basement hooking is not always the best option. You waste too much time and can't take the best out of your BBQ readings.
---
Dec 25th.
---
Only if the gens are unable to be repaired for the time being.
---
I‚Äôm at rank 18 right now. Any tips on how to be a better player in general? My current build is adrenaline dead hard self care and decisive. I was at rank 11 before taking a long break and now I‚Äôve lost a lot of my already subpar skill. Thanks
---
I thought you were gonna say something along the lines of "rawr XD"
---
I play selflessly as well. After all, the goal is to pip, not necessarily survive. 
---
Mostly console players are pissing in my cheerios.    I've had more fun in yellow ranks helping inexperienced players get out then trying to carry a team who doesn't care.
---
I'll be far more careful next reset keeping to yellow
---
Generally don't BM.  90% of the time it's completely unwarranted.
---
But if they played like filth with facecamps with gens up  feel free to teabag away to your hearts content.  If they play like trash they should feel comfortable getting bm'd like trash.  
---
Plenty of players still take the high road but I fully understand anyone's personal decision to bm in those scenarios.
---
yup
---
I just want Killer emotes because when a survivor DC's and nobody is going to pip I have to try kinda hard to get everyone to agree to farm.
---
Lets say I'm using quick and quiet. I can stand still, hit shift without moving and get into a locker without causing any scratchmarks, right?
---
Same I went against this really strong legion on Haddonfield the other day .
---
Haha no man. 
---
It's my first flashlight save, give me time lol
---
All BHVR announcements get stickied even if for a couple hours, theres no reason this one shouldnt either
---
I feel you. I always switch to spirit after a loss lol
---
Doesn't completely rule it out. He could be saying it's possible but not before June
---
Killer ragequit like a child and ruined the game for all parties involved.  I have zero issue with a survivor giving killer a hard time in post game.  What they did was inexcusable and has no place in this game.  Ragequitting toddlers deserve bm.
---
Not sure if it‚Äôs a bug but it doesn‚Äôt work like that. If you‚Äôre working on a gen affected by mind breaker, once you go above 50% your exhaustion automatically goes down. No need to stop the repair action.
---
[speaking of...](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/777364566001950985/76B3B1A80FDCD4D789E7B24845DDBFF3ECA6FFEB/)
---
Hey guys this gen over here is moving, let's leave
---
I only prestige if my first 50 levels are full of shit perks but I make sure to use most of my bloodpoints offerings so I get something back at least.
---
Toxic survivors VS toxic killer!
---
It's like watching bigfoot riding a unicorn, an incredible and majestic spectacle! You can get blind by watching stuff like this!
---
Maybe I'd have to test ti to see, too bad it's hard to test since no one uses mindbreaker
---
idkkk its more like 60% of the time it works 60% of the time
---
i swear the perk just breaks sometimes
---
I‚Äôve never been a fan of silent hill,I always prefered resident evil,But darn this looks so cool
---
Then why did you have nothing to say about the survivor who rage quit first?
---
I mean come on.
---
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
---
For meme builds it‚Äôs fun
---
It‚Äôs not bad but it‚Äôs not really a top tier perk either. It‚Äôs okay.
---
If you're putting up with suffering so much you want to die, I reckon other people can put up with you reaching out in a DbD forum. I wouldn't sweat it too much, stranger. Regardless, I hope things get easier for you.
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH!! You should post this on one of the lego subreddits
---
thanks g, that means a lot
---
&gt; it's virtually impossible to win against perfect survivor play with like 13 of our killer cast, even with perfect killer play
---
This is what people actually say, and it's still true. If all 5 players play perfectly with their strongest builds, Nurse is the only one that will consistently win, and that'll still partly come down to RNG of whether or not the early patrols result in a chase and how close they spawn to Ruin. And if we're counting wins as pipping then arguably no killer could do it consistently in those conditions because games tend to spiral out of control either to gen rush or 4k, so depips and blackpips all around.
---
The only reason this game still works is because survivors fuck up a lot and most games have at least 1 or 2 solo queues.
---
Reddit in the nutshell I guess. I enjoy him even if he's not perfectly viable. He might actually be my favorite killer atm.
---
That's not what you said, and it's also not true.
---
would've been funnier if it said ds instead of unbreakable not gonna lie
---
Yeah i've had multiple times a whole team of R1's who i though were yellows or greys...
---
Do you actually get to play against rank 8 players?  I'm rank 7 and EVERY match I've got at least 3 red ranks
---
It's worked for my friend while I was on the hook, so I don't see why not. Unless you're talking about the speed boost. That also probably works but even then, will barely work most of the time that it probably isn't worth using for the speedboost alone.
---
Its like going to a restaurant, and they didnt make your food exactly how you wanted it, so you give them -10 stars and go back every day to give them another -10 stars
---
It‚Äôs only (kinda) mandatory if you‚Äôre going against one of those rare sweaty 4 man squads, other than that plenty of killers at rank 1 have done well without it
---
When core game design comes off as toxic, for both killer and survivor, it makes you stop and think "Do I actually have fun when I play DbD?" And if you answer yes, theres a good chance your opponent(s) would say no :P
---
_...and my arms are very tired_
---
I can guarantee you any further conversation with you would not have been an intelligent one, so thank you for sparing us both. At least now you have the extra time to soften that next DC!
---
I'm all for Sir. Ian McKellen as a live action Bill
---
What happens when you're up against survivors who know the gen placements? Making a killer slower than the survivors is an enormous deal; the only killer slower than survivors is Nurse, and her ability is absolutely incredible, by far the best one in the game.
---
Is there a reason console players don't have their daily rituals spawn? I'm down to one more left and none have spawned in the place of the ones I've done and it's been a couple days. Do I have have to wait to finish them all? Or do they spawn after 24 hours of completing one at a time?
---
It‚Äôs seems like the devs are learning, though. Badham rework and Hawkins Lab have amazing totem spots. I haven‚Äôt played the new map enough to see if it has good spots as well.
---
Will this version come to the switch? I‚Äôd buy this for the switch since it‚Äôs bundled with dlc.
---
Wait what
---
Too OP please nerf
---
Lmao nice try on that one, but no. You're attempting to compare to something subjective. In this case, it is simply objective.
---
&gt;I looped you like a god
---
If I'm correct they did not live long enough to escape, which would mean they are probably not as skilled as they think.
---
That's literally just a shot of Gandalf the White. The beret and cigarette are the only additions
---
It very well could be, when I was on xbox i was getting near instant matches as killer at 4am so lol
---
BMing breeds BMing. Some people say "X BMed me, so I did it back" or "I got BMed in one game, so I needed to do _____ in the next game to feel better." It can become a cycle that isn't broken unless someone decides not to get involved.
---
No response is often the best response to BM.
---
I mean Luigi typically rhymes, but good meme
---
Tbh the sweaty 4-man SWFs will usually have no problem working through it, or just outright finding and cleansing it before a minute has passed. Corrupt Intervention or PGtW would usually be more effective in such situations.
---
So odd but thanks for letting me know it gets better if i keep powering through!
---
I've always said that Wraith is **criminally** underrated but good lord Tru3Ta1ent has been touting Wraith as the 4th best Killer and all I can think is "bruh where can I get that dank kush you're smoking?" I think the top 4 is quite firmly set in stone: Nurse, Spirit, Hillbilly, and Freddy. You can shift those four around as you please but I don't think anyone will deny that they're far stronger than the rest. Hag and Huntress are also very high up and while they are a subject of debate (I know several very high-end players who argue that Hag isn't as strong as people say) I think it's safe to say that those two are also very high up. That's 6/18 Killers who are pretty much set in stone, and if we also consider that Tru3 says that "Wraith is just worse Ghostface" that also means that Ghostface is above Wraith, putting Wraith quite nicely in mid tier at 8th best Killer.
---
I think Tru3's "constantly injured" build is fine but it's nowhere near Wraith's best build. It works for him because he gets good use out of Thanataphobia but I personally think Thanat is very unreliable, and making a build that's almost completely reliant on that perk is overkill. I also personally find A Nurse's Calling to be very overrated, both on stealth Killers and as a whole. Yeah the whole "just don't heal in the Terror Radius lul" rule doesn't apply to Killers who *have* no Terror Radius, but most Survivors with half a brain will heal somewhere safe like under a pallet or near a window.
---
A perk I think is very underrated on Wraith is Save the Best for Last. At risk of sounding like Otz STB4L is extremely strong on any M1 Killer and Wraith is no exception. The thing that makes STB4L so good on Wraith is that he can get stacks very easily. Wraith gets surprise attacks very easily and his biggest asset is his element of surprise. STB lets you capitalize on that surprise element much more, since you give the Survivor less time to run to a pallet or window. I know Otz also personally really likes Play With Your Food on Wraith and while I think Otz puts *way* too much faith in that perk it's still great to combine with STB. Add in Dying Light if you're so inclined and you actually have a pretty solid build.
---
I also think Wraith makes good use out of Pop Goes the Weasel because of his movement speed while cloaked but I don't have much to say beyond that. My personal build right now on Wraith is Ruin, BBQ, Whispers, and Pop. I will admit that I rely too much on Whispers to play but Pop has been serving me well, and I've lost faith in STB4L after playing against a lot of really aggressive Obsessions. Brutal Strength and the typical Spiritduring build is also great on Wraith but it's good on any M1 Killer.
---
But back to Tru3Ta1ent's claim: Wraith is nowhere near Ghostface. There's a number of factors that make him far weaker than Ghostface. One of the biggest reasons is Wraith's bell, publicly broadcasting when he's stealthed versus when he's visible. There's also the fact that the *literally invisible Killer* is much easier to see than some idiot wearing a white plastic mask and a black cloak. There's discussion to be had about Wraith's visibility but I won't get into it. Will mention that Wraith's loud as shit growling also doesn't help his visibility issues. Ghostface can also use his power to hide his red stain which is criminally underrated in a chase. Along with the fact that there's no public indicator when he uses his power a Survivor can often become confused and think you lost them, which is your time to strike.
---
The biggest strength Wraith has over Ghostface is that his power is constantly available, but this is more of an issue with Ghostface's over reliance on cool-down addons (Chewed Pen lol) as opposed to Wraith's strength. I think if you're comparing addonless Wraith to addonless Ghostface, Wraith wins out. This isn't to say that Wraith isn't addon reliant however, but Wraith can be played with far weaker addons and still be viable (Bone Clapper + "The Ghost" Soot is a 7000 BP addon combination that I honestly consider to be top tier.) All that being said a Wraith running top tier addons (double Windstorm, Windstorm + Decloak Speed, Sneak Wraith, pallet muncher Wraith, etc.) doesn't compare to Ghostface's best build. (Chewed Pen + Ghostface Caught On Tape.) Wraith has a lot more build options than Ghostface but GF still has the incredibly powerful asset of an instadown and the ability to 99% a stalk. While I do agree with Tru3 that you're far better off playing Ghostface "like Wraith" and only stalking Survivors who aren't paying attention it's still an option that's far more potent than any mobility or utility Wraith can get with his bell. And as discussed earlier Wraith has far more innate weaknesses and shortcomings when compared to Night Shroud.
---
Wraith is not top tier and I don't think you can really put him in high tier either. But I have had him in mid tier for quite awhile and I'm glad that people are starting to realize that he's a strong option. My hope is just that overexposure doesn't wind up forcing Behaviour to Legion him and gut everything unique about him. I think Wraith has a very fair and well-balanced power which while it can be a little annoying for new players it has some really obvious counterplay (camp pallets and windows, equip Spine Chill, "be more attentive lol") and doesn't provide nearly as much strength as the top tiers.
---
That's just my two cents as someone who plays a lot of Wraith, and has been saying that Wraith is good for a long time now.
---
I kinda regret P3‚Äôing Ghost Face because I don‚Äôt get a lot of Chewed Pens/Olsen‚Äôs Address Book, but the bloody mask is badass so in the end I think it was worth it.
---
Too weak please buff
---
Funny how a beret and cigarette makes him look like bill. Take a upvote üòÇ
---
Rawr XD OwO, what‚Äôs this, Nuzzles your Belly welly. Merp, fuzzy wazzy nosey nose.
---
Happy? (Insert distorted cry emoji)
---
I've only had one match against an oni but its was the most fun I've had in dbd in a while. His dash is so fast I actually freaked out and froze once. Everyone got away still but he's definitely the most frightening killer by far imo atleast.
---
Too buff please OP.
---
but in the game Ash can't even kill an Edgy Teen
---
I disagree, programming is closer to an art than anything
---
HOW DID YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T ESCAPE?! :0
---
Too nerf please weak.
---
I watched him and it helped me
---
Get better at wraith.  I need to level up nurse now so I can try this build fully.
---
 Hey, isn't that The Horse from *Horsin' Around*?
---
console right? yup this is matchmaking on console rn. broken af.
---
Fuck yes we NEED that
---
At this point, with where the fanbase is at, playing the game is toxic.
---
Probably because they‚Äôre trying to use dead hard to avoid a hit rather than using it for distance
---
Every time I use Laurie I always gotta out unbreakable just in case if they don‚Äôt pick me up
---
I'd suggest [the big thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d5elu7/guides_resources_for_new_players/) and then OhTofu's [videos on loops, pallets, and maps](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA/search?query=loop).
---
If you can find an educational streamer doing live content then that's a good time to ask any specific questions, but the above guides should point you in the right direction.
---
I've been playing for nearly two years and still don't know this. What does the border around certain players in a match mean while playing killer? I believe they resemble to entity's big ol' claw tentacle things, and my top theories are most points and marks the obsession, but I was never sure.
---
He should brush his hair
---
When you're playing dbd with someone new to the game, so you want to show them a good time,but they are on their second hook. You and him are the only two left. You go to unhook him and start to heal him. The killer gets here(it's michael) and you know he'll down your friend and hook him, and you haven't been hooked yet; so you crouch infront of the killer, effectively blocking the way in. You want your friend to run so he just runs in circles behind you. The michael hits you and you stay there, you haven't been hooked its ok. Your friend stops running in circles and starts healing you. You start screaming for him to run, and the michael hits him. He's down. You start shaking no at the michael. He...listens? You heal your friend fully. He hits your friend again. This goes for a minute. The michael asks you to follow him. He shows you to a gen. Every time we finish a gen he downs me and lets my friend get me back up. He leads us to exit. My friend starts to open it and the Michael downs him. I go to heal my friend. Michael says no. My friend is playing bill, and instists he'll get himself up. I stand there. The michael tells me to open the door. I listen. My friend gets up and Michael downs him again, im scared he made michael mad so i crouch over him. Michael tells me to open the door again, so i finish opening the door. He downs me. He walks twards my friend and swings. I crawl behind my friend whos just laying on the ground now. The michael says no and swings at the exit. I had to tell my friend many times to start crawling through the exit because he didn't understand. We lived.
---
I am very greatful to this michael.
---
How does that happen and I have dbd and mobile  but wait there was an update but I still have store credit so I can‚Äôt update it ;-;
---
Dead Hard is better to continue loops, Sprint Burst is for people who just want to get out of dodge but it‚Äôs a hinderance cause you can‚Äôt run to new areas in case the killer shows up.
---
This is what I said to a killer:
---
"Thanks for the selfie dad"
---
Now what killer did I face detective Pikachu?
---
Otz is so cute :)
---
yes but... actually no
---
The joke is that it looks just like Bill anyway
---
If you change your region on iOS to Denmark or selected regions on a twitter post from the dbd mobile team then you‚Äôll get it
---
For Android: download tap tap and search it up on there
---
I miss the old lobby lighting so much
---
This is wholesome as fuck.
---
It all depends on the skill of the killer you're playing against, a good killer will bait your Dead Hard after the first use, but Sprint Burst requires you to learn how to use it the right way.
---
If I have to resume it I would say Dead Hard helps you survive a chase, Sprint Burst helps you evade the chase.
---
I get so many bullshit hits playing killer though, like I‚Äôll lunge way too early through a pallet or window and it‚Äôll somehow still connect
---
I can just imagine being the super confused survivor watch you open the doors and then down them...
---
Mid chase it should do that thing the spine chill perk has a cat doing. (No idea what that's called)
---
Turn lights off. Get kitchen knife. Put ketchup on kitchen knife. Get ghostface mask from literally any halloween store. Pose. How original
---
Means the obsession
---
It doesnt affect killers, so no
---
More people want to play survivor so it destroys everyones wait times.
---
Its like when you queue for dps on an MMO it takes ages because tanks/healers are needed more.
---
I have it on mobile so when ever it takes that long I just reset it and try again get killer and survivor in like a min
---
Spirit if you want to win, Oni if you want to have fun( hes hard to control if your a console gamer just saying) and plague for her perks since hers are probably the best of the three imo.
---
I'm a rank 8 survivor, I have played in lobbys with ranks 18/17/18, the killer was rank 20. I tried to carry the team, but they didn't know what they were doing and I ended up using the hatch.
---
I didn't know this was console so the M1s are understandable. 
---
Unfortunately consoles aren't balanced differently than PC and you guys end up getting the short end of the stick. 
---
Wrecker's Yard can be tough on Billy because this map is the LT wall heaven so unless you manage to mind game someone going for a vault (by double backing while revving and hitting him as he comes out of the vault), you are screwed. 
---
If I knew this was console I would've come up with different arguments but the general idea is the same. Basement for Wreckers Yard is in the dead center so you probably didn't get any auras on BBQ and BT would always proc since there is no way to go away from the basement. 
---
I always try to hook people towards the edges of this map so I can pressure by travelling the map with chainsaw.
---
Love this game
---
Add ons. That's all there is to say about it. Killer loses add ons no matter what. Survivors can keep theirs and potentially bring items out whereas they didn't take any in.
---
thanks ill try it!!
---
Doesn't feng's perk counter it out anyways?
---
Anything with a pallet.
---
Legion can be found post-Trial sitting fetal position in a corner and muttering ‚Äúthirtyminutesoritsfree‚Äù over and over again
---
Was busy.....LOOPING THE KILLER, LIKE A GOD!  
---
I got the Boob3 joke. I just wanted to reply that.
---
appreciate your passion, but i aint reading that man üòÇ
---
Ha, so I've been burning add ons thinking the game was glitching in my favor. Good to know!
---
The meta is largely in regards to Red rank killers versus (potentially coordinated) Red rank survivors. The further down the ranks you go, the less "relevant" the "meta" is.
---
It's important to separate "meta" from the each perk's individual strengths. At high ranks *most* survivors will heal other survivors, but when you're just starting out you're going to struggle to find survivors that understand this - and you're not going to have enough med-kits to help you either. This is why at low ranks you'd see Self Care, Plunderer's Instinct, etc. at a higher frequency than you would for high rank play.
---
Same thing carries across to killers - some killers and perks are "safer" at low ranks than they are at high ranks.
---
Hahaha thank you kind stranger omg thank you thank you R slash winning hahaha
---
Look at a killer‚Äôs build and bloodweb. If a killer brings a yellow and green addon, that directly costs 9k bp to use whether the killer wins or loses. It also costs whatever bloodpoints are spent to buy the nodes between the center of the web and the desired nodes. This is an expensive process and can easily cost 50-60k bp to reacquire even a single extra copy of two addons for a build. 
---
Contrast with survivor, I‚Äôve not spent any points on Jeff, the survivor I usually play, in like 6 months. Yet I still have lost only 2 or 3 commodious tooolboxes since then and I use those fairly frequently. A green item with two yellow addons costs 13k bp ignoring intermediate costs, yet I can use this as many times as I can escape. Further, I can also choose to bring no item and find one in the trial from a box. Can killers perform small tasks midgame to have the opportunity of coming away with some addons? Nope. 
---
Killer is a far more bloodpoint expensive process and the increased gains they receive is justified. It‚Äôs also why they shouldn‚Äôt buff or give a practical immediate use of WGLF. It would make very strong survivor items and addons far more common.
---
It is, quite literally, an exploit. It was not an intended feature of the game, the developers had no idea it existed at launch. Pallets were to be used as distraction tools for the survivor to hide, but everyone thought it was fun to loop/chase and they had to do a lot of patches to make sure it wasnt SuPeR survivor-sided and instead only ExTrEmElY survivor sided. But, like all things in DbD, the m1 killer gets fucked by it if the survivor has decent teammates, which seems to be why people consider it toxic. Same as 'genrush' (it's a real thing, it just has nothing to do with survivors playstyle and everything to do with game design).
---
I know what I said
---
Wow i didn't know the hitboxes were supposed to be shaped like Micheal Myres from the hit comedy movie Friday the 13th
---
i dont own freddy what do those addons do
---
The only "counter" adrenaline has is killing the survivor before the exit gates are powered and that's not really a counter.

However NOED does legitimately have a counter and that is cleansing totems. It adds another element of fear to the game when somebody gets downed with NOED and you realize you must've missed a totem. I personally don't mind going against the perk. It can be unsatisfying when I play great throughout the entire match only to get downed by NOED, hooked, and abandoned by my team but I feel that it adds to the horror theme of the game. You're not expected to win every match. So all in all, I feel that NOED, although annoying sometimes, is a pretty balanced perk. Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk, lol.
---
and it worked
---
Unless you‚Äôre the last person alive, it‚Äôs usually a good thing to wait until Killers ‚Äòforce‚Äô you out. Because that extra time spent on them hitting you/cooldown/staring at you to leave is all time you are giving your Team to do whatever it is they need to do, let that be Heal/Open Gates/Etc.
---
It‚Äôs annoying as a Killer but totally viable as Survivor. There are instances where 3-4 man SWF will just waste time to be a dick, but you still get all those points for Hits and Downs.
---
Kapwing is awesome
---
He doesn‚Äôt need buffs he‚Äôs fine where he is maybe some add on changes but his juggling is very good
---
this is something that the community has been asking for a long time now but bhvr doesn't seem to care about this issue.
---
at least now they give us extra bloodpoints from the rift missions lol
---
I know your not supposed to win every game but your supposed to have a chance. I just feel like no ed and adrenaline boost one sides chance a lot more while lowering the others by to much.
---
If anything, Amanda would rig it so the hatch automatically closes when you try to jump through, or it's actually a trap that eviscerates you, or whatever.
---
Ok but which Michael Myers? Thats the question.
---
No. BM breeds BM. It's stupid and toxic. Besides, facecamping is an auto-loss even with a 4k.

I was expecting the downvotes but still, she was a drug adict and all her traps missed the point of beeing in one if jigsaw's trials, you couldn't escape them
---
Quentin gang rise up!
---
Its the fact that there are less killers than survivors, that means that is more probable for a low rank killer to get matched with higher rank survivors, often SWF, that destroys the killer.
---
Always the claudette isnt  it..
---
Does that affect killer matchmaking??
---
I agree the first time I went against the oni in Hawkins Laboratory,that was a pretty intense match, to bad I pretty much only play against hags and wraiths
---
Can 100% agree
---
Need at least a green flashlight to do it well. I just can't get the timing for flashlight saves. Get the blind but no sgun
---
the scratch marks, in my memory, appear directly ON the locker, not around it really, so they aren't super visible. Again, i tested this ages ago (year plus probably), so who knows if its changed.
---
...and you stayed at that loop because why?
---
I don't think that Tru3 thinks Wraith is *powerful,* he just thinks that he might get nerfed because his play pattern (and ultimately the play pattern of all stealth killers) is different from everyone else and thus he might get nerfed because BHVR could want to make the experience of all killers in the future more uniform.
---
I do actually, Red Rank 4. It's not exactly fair if that affects matchmaking though.
---
I think adrenaline definitely improves the survivors chances of winning since there is no real counter, and it's game changing when all 4 survivors have it equipped. 
---
NOED has the chance to snowball and overtake the survivors but it also has an equal amount of chance to fail since it's reliant on a totem that can easily get cleansed moments after it's activated (before anybody gets downed) or never gets a chance to activate since all of the totems had already been cleansed. When it's activated it's almost like playing as if you're injured. So in some circumstances it can make the game feel "unfair", but I don't think it's on the same level as adrenaline. It's pretty counterable.
---
Yesü§©
---
I don‚Äôt bm personally because I‚Äôd rather just get my next game started but I think when a leatherface face camps it‚Äôs justified
---
I don't think fighting fire with fire is ever a good idea, if someone is being rude I personally believe the best course of action is always to move on and give them nothing. It's often more fun for them the more you interact, but it's your decision, you should never ask for permission to act a certain way.
---
Imagine Myers vomiting on the survivors
---
It isn‚Äôt really a nerf, just needed balancing so she isn‚Äôt as insane and so that people cannot abuse old mechanics like bumping into survivors while phasing. It only ‚ÄúNerfs‚Äù baby spirits.
---
like a GAWD!
---
B R U H
---
Judging from screenshots shared by streamers the length of a lunging swing is a full pallet‚Äôs distance from the killer‚Äôs torso. I‚Äôd be fine with this if their weapon actually made contact with the survivors body.... but it doesn‚Äôt.
---
&gt; STBFL is a must on trapper since it shortens chsses by a lot if there are no traps and it has the added bonus that you can get a free hit on people in traps if they are not the obsession while the obsession you just pick up with space bar. 
---
Saw this 1 in another comment, main issue is I'll be waiting for a shrine to give it to me :/
---
&gt;ruin or corrupt intervention to me seem like must haves to compensate for your set up time. I def. don't think I am good enough to play Trapper without those against decent survivors  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;other than STBFL, I usually run more perks that help in chase: Brutal strength, Enduring or Bamboozle are all decent enough since they help you with your main weakness, the fact that you are just a basic M1 Killer. Maybe also think about using the Enduring/Spirit Fury combo  
---
&gt;Pop goes the Weasel is also very good to defend your 3 gen effectively
---
Considering running both ruin and CI when I eventually unlock them (but may limit my other perks too much). But had not considered bamboozle/pop, even have the clown just didn't bother leveling him up. 
---
In relation to trapper knowledge, is there anywhere outside of the game one can look at the common game tyles? So one can memorize the loops
---
Pharmacy is good but compared to a perk like say adrenaline its garbage
---
R6S also allows for kill trades so as long as you pull that trigger the server will read that you shot and you will get the hit for it. They also aren‚Äôt working on brand new dedicated servers either. Like I said there is plenty of room for these servers to get better and I‚Äôm not acting like they‚Äôre fine as is. Do we even have any info on the tick rate? Because I almost feel like that‚Äôs playing a huge part in the bullshit that goes down with servers right now
---
An...exploit....just wow
---
Adrenaline, Decisive strike, Unnerving Presence and Rancor
---
Well I will not give up on booping the snoot. &lt;3
---
Both of these, in their current state, make the game shorter (aka BAD) and are extremely unfair for the other side. Having Mori's be flair and not game-breaking is awesome, and there is still some tactical play involved (instead of picking them up (flashlight blind, pallet stun), carrying them to the hook (bodyblock, wriggle out), putting them on the hook (and being deafened by the entity for doing a good job), you just kill them in a timely manner and move on with the game. Keys cannot be applied with the same formula, since it's about abusing an already broken holdover mechanic from the games design/hide-and-seek phase. Not to mention the amount of times I've found a key in a chest. The only way to balance keys would be replace the entire hatch mechanic.
---
I'm not that experienced though. 
---
I have played maybe 10 or 20 hours of Killer. Compared to 80 or 90 of Survivor. I mean I have 105 hours in the game and consider myself a good Survivor, hence my Red Rank (all though I notice people are a lot toxic at this rank so I might purposely drop rank).
---
Survivor mechanics are all the same, compared to Killers which have multiple different abilities. I have only played about 6 Killers properly and don't fully understand how to best killer a survivor, do I run at the generator that was just fixed, continue chasing this survivor and get looped, stay near this hooked survivor or run to a new generator? I don't know these yet, I'm still learning. Therefore if I'm against 4 Red Ranks that can rush generators, evade and hide, loop and what not then it's not right.
---
Yeah, it would make more sense if it was clear it uses both rankings to determine how it matchmakes. If I was experienced, I would've known this sooner. But just because I'm a great survivor against also great killers, doesn't make it fair I have to be a bad/good killer against great survivors, if that makes sense.
---
Ngl I would actually main Myers if this was a cosmetic. I've never been a fan of him otherwise
---
Hell yeah, I'm gonna need to farm you for stacks of WGLF tho, you understand right? I need the stacks to feed my kids ;-;
---
Looping is basically the best way to draw out a chase. When you are in a chase, as a good player you are wasting the killers time so your teammates can do generators unhindered. Also if you get good at looping killers can get frustrated and leave you alone
---
I love how the chase music starts when the Dwights get up from crouch walk and start running after Julie.
---
I want to hear people's thoughts on this.
---
I‚Äôve also heard 99% a gate is toxic and a ‚Äúbannable offense‚Äù. He was running NOED, lul
---
Talking appearance wise not personality wise.
---
It's Julie, she!
---
I know.
---
Killing survivors and preventing generators from being finished are the two main goals of the killer. That isn't a direct counter to adrenaline, that's just what you're supposed to do.
---
Finishing generators and escaping the trial are the two main goals of the survivors. That isn't a direct counter to NOED, cleansing totems is.
---
If your claim is that killing survivors/preventing gens from being done is the balanced "counter" to adrenaline, then there should be no issue with NOED as you can just twist that logic around and say that NOED's "counter" is doing gens and escaping lol
---
Poop
---
My guy I‚Äôm not tripping over anything. I never really played Spirit nor am I a killer main so this isn‚Äôt coming from a ‚Äúmake my role stronger‚Äù perspective I just think this change ruins the cool killer aesthetic she had. I never really had trouble with the whole vault mechanic since to me it was the same as standing still while phasing, irritating sometimes but now that collision is gone many of my issues playing against her have as well.
---
I guess if the devs are trying to appeal to the kind potatoes you‚Äôre getting matched with that have no idea how Spirit works than the change is fine. I just wish they could‚Äôve given her an actually cool vault animation and left it as is until then rather than implementing this half-assed shit.

---
He‚Äôs right
---
They weren't needed. There were many killer moves and addons that instant down, thereby countering them. But we better just nerf survivor perks and not touch the killer moves that stopped them from working, am I right? Typical killer main, lol.
---
Heh
---
Camping is balanced if the survivors bum rush hook killer has the advantage. If the survivors do gens they have the advantage. 
---
Still it suck being camped and I hope my death is what causes their defeat.
---
Yes and no. Camping guarantees a kill but thats it, the others easily escape
---
I was on console and I had the same issue. We all added eachother and it worked
---
I want Freddy to be the Ryze of DbD; reworks every year
---
Apparently he is unplayable on console because just him existing hammers FPS.
---
As for PC though I love him, he just supports a peculiar play style. Keeping people off gens is more important than chasing for a hook usually, I have the most success when I get a hit and then find someone to irritate until I have active portals on the majority of gens. 
---
I think he's great and I don't play any other killers but him, so take it with a pinch of salt.
---
Sprint burst does both of those and why would you want it to activate when you drop a pallet that just wastes a second of the ability
---
That technically is a counter. But still the idea of a perk that rewards a killer for not doing their job well enough and punishing survs for doing their job too well just seems stupid. Just like adrenaline punishes survs for not doing gens or for not being able to be good enough to survive.
---
Unnecessarily camping is for incels. But, there are jerks on both sides of this game so it‚Äôs nothing new really. This topic gets posted x35 a day.
---
Why would you ever bring a mori when you can bring a Game map offering
---
\^ This. Agreed.
---
Imagine Meg carrying Ash üò¨
---
Wait, I somehow missed something. He stood differently before?
---
&gt; And I don‚Äôt see how this is problematic as I clearly disclosed the information and am not calling for any changes
---
okay, fine. fair enough. but trying to talk about how a killer works without having first hand knowledge isn't great
---
&gt; The thing is that he was only getting hits with his power by mid game.
---
You guys let him go half a game being an M1 killer? I'm sorry but he's among the weakest killers in the game without his power so I just don't get how you had this issue. You should have gotten a good amount done in that time.
---
&gt; Does blood ever de-spawn?
---
No, but it only spawns when you perform actions, mostly healing and gen rearing. Otherwise if you're moving about running it only spawns 2 orbs every few seconds
---
This addon is the equivalent of a brown lens flashlight addon

---
Oh lol i thought you were doing it as a joke like youtube videos being put in the wrong category
---
? How do you get that from what I said. You said that the game is unbalanced because some killers are obviously better given the difficulty ratings. I showed you that the difficulty ratings have nothing to do with how good the killer is. The game may be unbalanced, but it's an assymetric game lol, it's always gonna be unbalanced.
---
I got a message from someone last night talking shit because I had NOED. My response was that A) I mistook the icon for Thana and B) we didn't even make it to the endgame for NOED to turn on...

Well done man! I still remember how proud I was of my first pallet stun
---
I'd argue that legion actually does a better job of stalling the game out than a pig does. Pig only has 4/5 hats to give out, and the hats only stall the survivor wearing them, which pig has to down that person so even put it on.
---
Legoion's stalling may not be as powerful on its own, but they can apply deep wounds so easily and so constantly that the survivors are constantly mending. Then run perks like thana to make it even better
---
Thanks.
---
I mean yea, but its an easy win
---
This must be the work of an enemy stand
---
Well how fast he gets his power is dependent on the survivors lol. If he got it really fast that means he was doing well and hitting/downing you guys really fast.
---
They three gen themselves, not your fault
---
I feel your pain
---
OK thanks! Gonna test this with no mither as its a shit perk anyway

Wtf
---
I can't play. Looks like servers are down
---
Spirit is nowhere near on skill level of nurse and demogorgon. That‚Äôs not saying she doesn‚Äôt take skill, but I‚Äôd easily justify that there‚Äôs killers with much higher skill requirements than her. Just get good headphones and practice. It‚Äôs nothing extremely difficult to pick up really
---
I've been playing DBD on and off over the past year (I'm a CNA and work lots of really long hours and dont have as much time to play video games like I used to) however, I'm not sure how the ranking system works still. Could someone explain this to me a little further? Thank you. Very much.
---
Ah, that makes sense. Probably more valuable than 80% of my chases
---
Wasn't the guy the one that was rigging up fake traps that nobody could escape? I thought the only thing Amanda did was kill the doctor even though Jigsaw told her not to (which resulted in everyone dying)

Wait, the "Nightmare Edition" doesn't come with Freddy? That's...a choice. I know it's probably for licensing reasons, but the name choice is a thing.

They should add more secret offerings. I‚Äôm tired of baby survivors dodging when I bring a shroud

We all have each other as friends so not it

That Tapp better be grateful, you ran half across the map to save him, good job! It also took me like a year to actually start using flashlights and get saves
---
Whining about a perk they didn‚Äôt even know about or experience in game? That‚Äôs a new one!
---
I run NOED on one of my killers and honestly I‚Äôm fine admitting that I personally run it because I‚Äôm a bad killer at the moment and need the crutch hahaha (side note it does look so much like thana). 
---
I play survivor 90% of the time and noed, whilst it‚Äôs a pain, it‚Äôs fair because there are counters like DS, unbreakable if you‚Äôre slugged, deliverance etc. Also, it can be cleansed...
---
&gt;for self care you have to have time to heal yourself when it's easier to find a teammate to do it for you and for deliverance you still lose a state on hook and cant be healed for awhile you also have to let one of your own teammates go down and get hooked before you can even have a chance to use it.
---
Exactly. All of these perks, although helpful for you, have their own shortcomings or need something extra to activate them. It's the same with NOED, although it gives that killer one more chance to turn things around, it's not very reliable since it's only activated if a totem is still up and by now, most experienced survivors know to cleanse totems.
---
Adrenaline doesn't seem to have a shortcoming, besides the exhausted status but it gave you a free sprint burst so that's not much of a downer.
---
Dont feel bad. They 3-genned themselves

Ez. Door ways you know theyre running too (door ways as in entrys to jungle gyms) pallets you know theyre running to, and on some maps between rocks/trees or on lerys or the lab. But i just find oni works for me so.

You start at rank 20 and work you way to rank 1. Each game based on your emblem points, you either lose a pip, gain a pip, or stay neutral. You need 3-5 pips to go up a rank depending on what rank you are. If you hover your cursor over your rank, you can see how many pips you need.
---
Ok thank you :)
---
And now you have to ask a question
---
Found one of the many Survivor biased users in this fanbase.
---
I wouldn't call it a "exploit", but it would explain things if pallets were never meant to be used the way they are now.
---
Shiiiii, why dont you answer his question?
---
Dying Light
---
Its short coming comes at the fact that the gens need to be done. Yes that's something survs need to do but saving other survs is something they should also be doing. The killers job is to kill survs. Stopping gens is something they should be doing to increase their chance at winning same as survivors saving each other.

---
Thats OK, everyone has an opinion, mine just seem to be rather upseting to most people
---
Same reason they try to escape, and go second stage 0.3 seconds after getting hooked. People aren‚Äôt smart, and they don‚Äôt understand. I would say like 80% of the playerbase don‚Äôt even acknowledge killer perks, or know how to coordinate with their team. That‚Äôs why you have to be altruistic, but watch out for yourself no matter what. Don‚Äôt die for people who won‚Äôt do the same.
---
What if dull totems actually did something?
---
How is the OG Michael Myers not verified on Twitter? WTF?
---
Some of the killer stuff is bad too, I mean people complain about tunneling all the time but I mean, are we supposed to let you live as long as possible? Is that what a killer does? Camping is annoying as hell but I get called a camper for playing wraith and zooming over to a hook because someone unhooked them 3 seconds after I hooked them. And then I've had people call me a noob for chainsawing them with hillbilly rather than just m1ing and at this point I'm just at a loss for words
---
they have totally different uses and drawbacks, so it really depends on how you prefer to play. personally, even though i'm not great at using it, i much prefer dead hard for its versatility
---
Yeah I personally use Sprint Burst over Dead Hard to evade it altogether. It's nice to also be able to move quick from gen to gen, or if you suck at loops like I still do, it's nice to have that head start.
---
Dead Hard is still fun though. I've made some pretty decent moves with it that completely confuse the killer. Downside is that good killers won't usually fall for it twice.
---
no. Pig is a meany.
---
No i does not  ,i have made the experiment i am a rank 12 or so survivor yet when i played killer i got matched with red rank survivor a lot wich came eith positives like i learned and now im at red ranks but it is also very stressing and tbh i tough of dropping the game cuz of the feeling that no matter how hard you try you just got to git gud or have a horrible game. Remember this is my personal experience.
---
Tbf its frustrating as survivor when i wait ten mins for a match only to die right off of first hook.
---
I don't think it does, my survivor rank is rank 15  and my killer rank is 12 (barely had chance to play due to life) and I still get matched with red ranks when playing killer
---
Hitting survivors with a lunge grants 1 stack, and you need 10 stacks to activate his ability for only 60 seconds? If you hit every single survivor twice you wouldn't even activate it.
---
Nice last minute save!!
---
Thanks bud, weird mechanic but ok
---
I agree. They can still 4k, in the hands of a competent player.
---
I went against a bunch of them yesterday, and they all did well. It does take them a little longer to get the kills rolling, but they have a bit of door pressure, and can easily defend the last 3 gens if they want to.
---
why does being a former addict make her a bad person?

---
Right up there with people who think killers downing somebody who got farmed are toxic.
---
Hell, you're right. Maybe 4 hits?
---
Yeah. It's a bit misleading. Should have just called it the Stranger Edition or something given ST is on the cover.
---
fuck no it is even more frustrating when you for no reason get moried and u had no idea about it. I love killer but I wouldn't bring moris anymore just bc how unfun it is to play against
---
Nah, Amanda's traps, as john said and was proved by cops, were unwinnable. Said something like then people you test are not subjects but victims.
---
Example was the woman strapped to this device that would tear her apart unless she unlocked herself with a key in a jar of acid. She got the key and unlocked it, but nothing happened
---
THAT WAS FUCKING BRUTAL
---
It's a joke, this is a glitch. lmao
---
Oh no that has nothing to do with beeing a bad person, i just think her behaviour is bitchy
---
That exposed meant the killer could see where you were

This is absolutely it chief

---
Jesus Christ you better be joking rn. Or I‚Äôm gonna lose my shit
---
I feel like the Luigi bit needs to rhyme
---
I understand that getting killed off the first hook is annoying. Believe me I understand but it's part of the game so we sadly have to deal with it because the dang developers are not going to just change that. They already changed it once so you think they're going to do it again?
---
I don't even play the nurse but damn I want that nurse one. It's beautiful!!
---
As a newly rank 11survivor on xbox, yes. But get some detection perks on him, like nurses and/or barbecue. After you hit/hook two people the game becomes considerably easier for onis if the team is altuistic, but you have to find some first. Theres been times where an oni just walks right through four gens because he can't find anyone.

---
trans rights color scheme with that mask
---
That's respectable. At least get something out of it.
---
Haha the slug race up the stairs is hilarious
---
Also i dont know many killer detection perks so use what you see fit, oni becomes extremely fun after the blood orbs come
---
I was agreeing that the art and design department are seperate dude, I kinda worded myself poorly tho. It's the design team's job to look into that stuff, but what I meant was that they should halt work on new killers and survivors for a bit to do bug fixes and balance changes, maybe skip a chapter or something, do an Operation Health type deal?

---
I don't think this one was lag but I've TOTALLY done that before! Happens when I go to save a teammate under a pallet! Feelsbad.
---
Broken... the logic is broken.
---
It *used to be* the neck, but as of Patch 2.3.0, 16 October 2018, you want to aim at their head.
---
The "easiest" way to get the save is to do the blind while the killer is picking up the survivor, because it locks them into an animation and means they cannot simply look away from you. YouTube has plenty of tutorials on that - be sure to use a recent one.
---
On PS4, I aimed for the head using the advice from one such tutorial - and that's how I got the Decisive Light challenge.
---
Yeah they did that to themselves so you can't be mad or feel even remotely bad about that.
---
Oh right! You're 100% correct, for some reason I was just attributing all the shit to Hoffman. Man Jigsaw is... not great at making apprentices.
---
"even a rock can be an infinite" -McCote
---
There are two main reasons: the first is what people refer to as "farming" someone-just unhooking them with no regard for thier hook health or safety, or thier own, to score a few bloodpoints. Never do this, it feels horrible to get farmed.
---
The second reason is that there are plenty of times when it is strategically valuble. If someome is on a hook, and they only have a few seconds before stage 2 or even death(1 hook state,aka half the bar, takes 60 seconds, for reference) then trading is often a good idea if theres no one else in a position to save. After all, assuming you arent dead on hook your team then has a whole minute to save you before you lose a state. Borrowed Time helps make those kinds of trades safer for the other person.
---
Congratz, nice save friend!~
---
Same here
---
Adrenaline is one of the best survivor perks. Kinda situational but when it pops it gives you such a large advantage
---
Good fucking lord....
---
I'm gay but damn that's too much I'm never gonna unsee half that shit üòÇüòÇüòÇ.

Game skin and character designers are for the most part graphic/3D designers. They have likely 0 skills for programming. You can‚Äôt just pause their job for other people to work harder? No expect them to do that job. That‚Äôs not how that shit works. I agree that the game needs a health boost, but skin design is a completely different department to bug fixes. Yes the game programming design team have that job, that‚Äôs what they are still doing. U can‚Äôt expect an employee to stop doing their job...
---
Yup, this is the big one that messed me up at first.
---
Me neither if you know what I mean
---
are these going to go on your redbubble account?
---
I'll say it:
---
Ebony Moris and Skeleton Keys are crutches and don't have any place on this game.
---
Change my mind.
---
There I've said it. You can downvote me now.
---
Yeah, that's why I primarily come here for the memes and to everyone now and then give my opinion on something.
---
The fact that the Entity forces her to give her current victims a chance to escape must be horribly frustrating for her.
---
I played as him and against him and no he doesn't get his power "that fast". Especially at the beginning of a match he is incredible weak because he just has his M1 and nothing, absolutely nothing secondary he can do. And after that first hit, he get about 2/3 of his power charged and has go chase the survivor. I hooked multiple times a survivor and the power was about 90% filled because I didn't got enough blood when hitting, chasing, collecting.
---
In addition to that.. what about hillbilly? He has unlimited chainsaw with huge map control and he can instant down too. Oni isn't that strong and I find all of his add-ons nearly useless (I only like the pink ones)
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
...Yeah? I've been agreeing with you dude. I never said anything about stopping the art department's job for game health, that's ridiculous. They do cosmetics, that is something completely seperate from design and programing. That's why I said the DESIGN team needs to look into a health patch, not the art department.
---
I was just saying I think the meme is just a joke and people shouldn't be taking it so seriously.
---
The totem spots on the new map are so good. It's often impossible to find find some totems because they are always hidden behind bamboo in completely new spots.
---
i _knew_ bhvr would work with netflix again for a new dlc
---
I literally watched saw 3 last night so this was fresh in my mind
---
Fun fact, the actor who was on "the rack", the limb twisting device, said in some behind the scenes interview that the prop he was strapped to was surprisingly comfy, kinda ruined the scene for me knowing that
---
This is the likely answer. I don't know why, but red rank survivors act like it's impossible that they'll get hit. I get so many free kills as a green rank purely because red ranks just suddenly forget how to play.
---
sure but getting hit while vaulting when there is a 4 foot gap between you and the killers weapon is frustrating, and telling someone "on your screen he was behind you" doesn't make the situation feel any better. 
---
dedicated servers are objectively bad right now and they need to iron them out asap but i dont think we'll see any fixes for a while if it all
---
One of the things I do in some other games to improve performance is to lower shadow quality or turn it off when given the option tbh. I can understand why that's not an option in DBD on PC though.
---
Killers can get stuck on lockers and generators after interacting with them. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs broken when people can‚Äôt play the game
---
He‚Äôs really fun but completely unplayable on some maps.
---
Why would they all keep running at him like that? Like... that‚Äôs.... why? Didn‚Äôt people learn to not do that when leatherface came out?
---
Mori's and skeleton keys are nothing alike, Keys require the player to survive long enough to use them whereas Mori's are just treats for tunneling
---
Well then maybe you should point out what I misunderstood but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case whatsoever
---
The hunter has become the hunted
---
Well thank god it's in the game because there's red and purple rank would be just about unwinnable for survivors if looping pallets whernt used.
---
Thats what he wrote
---
*casually walks in the other direction
---
I feel like no one here actually read what the killer wrote
---
Assassin's creed gone wrong.
---
Found the survivor main.
---
You forgot "free legacies for every fucking casual" on the top tank.
---
Ah once again bad wording on your part. Dw bout it. Either way people genuinely seem to act like skin design is an issue and they should focus on big fixes. And there are defo people in this thread that think that. It‚Äôs just dumb seeing the same complaint constantly when it‚Äôs not even related
---
Wait, what the actual fuck? If you run in to Oni while the smash animation is going on can you still get smashed? I thought once he hits it's just for show. Damn!
---
In all my hours playing DbD, I have NEVER come across survivors who "play fair" or played nice.  They all play dirty because they're trying to win. 
---
Do you remember when the BNP was instant?  That addon was treasured by survivors because of how dirty it was.  It was so dirty, it was nerfed twice!  
---
I never saw survivors apologize for that and I never see survivors apologize for keys now.  And yet, the killer is made to feel guilty for wanting to win or burning an Ebony.  This is what I mean by double standards.  Keys are not even close to a Mori.  Killers sacrifice the match for it most of the time and yet survivors can still "win" with a key whether it was a good match or a bad one.
---
It'll finally have its use
---
To all the dumbs downvoting this that‚Äôs not the window it‚Äôs too big just look at how massive it is compared to spirit this is the fence along it the window is to the right
---
Ah I remember my first time the survivors three genned themselves. 
---
Only I was playing Hag with three token Devour Hope.
---
Pink cosmetics.
