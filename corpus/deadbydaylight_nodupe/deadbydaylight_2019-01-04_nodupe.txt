They don't owe the survivors nothing, sure...but-
---
I had been given the hatch by 2 killers in 2 days. Why?
---
I like to believe they thought I earned my ticket out as I fought them valiantly and I was the only one still standing. 
---
Must confess, the first given hatch was a surprise, I didn't know what he wanted to do so I kept fighting and escape his clutches. After a while I saw the hatch, didn't struggle anymore and let myself being carried there.
---

---
I sent messages to thank them of course. Honestly, I think is nice to do this. I do it too as a killer if they deserve it.
---
---
---
Yo am I retarded because all the legion cosplay masks seem to be made out of paper in my eyes.
---
I DON'T MIND THAT AT ALL.
---
Well done :D
---
&gt;From watching it it looks boring all i see is a person just running away from a monster or repairing a generator. 
---
Anything sounds boring when you dumb it down to that level.
---
THAT'S NOT HOW THIS GAME WORKS.
---
i wish i was on pc i would use the shit out of this
---
Ah, I see. Liked it though!
---
I thought the same thing and never bought it. Got it free on ps4. Worst mistake i did, this game is strangely addicting and ive played it ALOT. Notes of caution, this game is indeed a grind fest. To get anywhere decent character you would have to play quite frequently. So its like paying $20 dollars just to have access to 1/4 of the game where everything is behind a paywall and is very grindy to get perks and whatnot. Hey, but its pretty fun atleast.
---
Yes, but he wasn't the first one to post it
---
Information has value in DBD. Knowing exactly where your teammates at regardless of distance, health, etc. is worth 2 perk slots (Bond + Open handed). With enough practice SWF survivors can achieve that kind of communication without sacrificing perks.
---
Knowing killer location is worth a perk slot (Kindred, Alert, Dark sense). SWF can communicate this information to each other without using these perks.
---
Imagine killer being able to get this kind of information without using tracking perks.
---
If you think this is boring I don’t know how you played F13, I’ve played both for a good amount of time and I would take dbd over that anytime. But yes, you should buy it 
---
IM A KILLER MAIN AND EVEN I WAS GETTING TIRED OF HOW SOME OF THE OTHER KILLERS WERE PLAYING TO THE POINT I STARTED RUNNING SMALL GAME AS SURVIVOR JUST TO NUKE TOTEMS SINCE THE NOED MORI COMBO SEEMED LIKE A CONSTANT. OTHER HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE
---
FACECAMPING CANNIBAL THAT GOT A 4K BECAUSE ONE PERSON DCED ON THE HOOK AND THE OTHER GUY JUST STOOD AROUND TRYING TO SAVE THE CAMPED PERSON INSTEAD OF DOING ANY GENERATORS
---
HUNTRESS ROUND WHERE I RAN THE HUNTRESS AROUND FOR A GOOD 2 MINUTES, THE OTHER SURVIVING NEA DECIDED INSTEAD OF DOING THE 75% GENERATOR, OR HEALING HER INJURED ASS, THAT SHE WOULD SIT AROUND WAITING, THEN HOOK RUSH ME AND GET BOTH OF US KILLED BECAUSE HEY, CANT DO THE 4TH GENERATOR QUICKLY ITS REGRESSED TOO MUCH.
---
GETTING THROW UP ON A HOOK AGAINST A TUNNELING NIGHTMARE, FAIR GAME, ONE GEN LEFT WE HAD 3 SURVIVORS AND THE ADVANTAGE, NOW AS THE TWO SURVIVORS ON THE FINAL GENERATOR DO YOU
---
1.FIX THE GENERATOR THEN PERHAPS GO FOR A HOOK RESUCE WHILE THE OTHER GRABS THE GATE SINCE I WAS ONLY ON STATE 1 ON THE HOOK.
---
2.HAVE ONE PERSON GO FOR THE RESCUE WHILE THE OTHER GUY STAYS ON THE GENERATOR
---
OR 3. BOTH RUN OFF THE NEARLY COMPLETED GEN TOGETHER, UNHOOK THE PERSON BOTH GET SLEPT, HAVE MYSELF DIE BECAUSE AS WE ESTABLISHED THE FREDDY WAS TARGETING THE INJURED PERSON, THEN FINISH THE GENERATOR, FREDDY POPS HIS NOED AND BOTH OF THEM DIE BECAUSE THE GENS WERE DONE AND NEITHER WAS INJURED SO THEY CANT WAKE UP.
---
AND BASICALLY EVERY OTHER MATCH HAD A DC, OR SOMEONE KILLING THEMSELVES ON THE HOOK OR PEOPLE JUST OUTRIGHT PLAYING LIKE IDIOTS. 
---
First escape/merciless victory of the day then?
---
oh my..
---
thank you a lot for this answer!
---
this helps me a lot
---
[Original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pfgrT2Qdo)
---
Had to stop playing after the Legion update due to this, feelsbadman :(
---
I looked up a killer today on steam because he got some shit in the chat from a teammate and he immediately left. I told him that he did a great and fair game and my teammate was just a cocky whiney bitch. 
---
Yeah, I feel you. It’s the most annoying and unfair thing. It isn’t your fault that the killer decided to stay on you the entire time?? I really hope they change the way points are earned 
---
AND I'M OKAY WITH IT CHANGING. I THINK I'VE MADE THAT CLEAR.
---
Yes they were xD
---
It is really easy to rank up. I’m at 7 currently and if I wasn’t so afraid of being one of the people that has extremely queue times I’d have already made it to 1 multiple times. 
---
I THINK I'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE.
---
Dude that was so good! Usually I'm insta downed (scrubs skills myself) when I try and keep the killer busy! How was the killer after the match?
---
Mask scent wpuld be way too weak if it was only 2 secs tho. It would be a lot more balanced if it were like 4 seconds or 5. Imo tho  but thanks for the feedback.
---
You're meant to do things other than running the killer around. That's why there's four emblems and not one.
---
God can you even read?  Apparently not...
---
gamer grill
---
Then who was? 
---
I HAD A MATCH WHERE LITERALLY IN THE FIRST FIVE SECONDS OF THE MATCH, A NURSE TELEPORTED ONTO ME AND DOWNED ME.
---
I don't know
---
I'm willing to bet that Reddit is at least a little skewed, as people who are very invested in the game are more likely to spend time and post on the game's Reddit page.
---
I'm a Rank 1 killer, Rank 6 survivor, btw.
---
Pretty much anything works on him.  The only add-ons I haven't really gotten used to are the Movement Speed ones.  Range + Skillchecks is a beautiful combination and one of my favorites alongside Omegarange.  Action Speed Addons are eh on their own, but tack on Remember Me with them, or combine one with one of the Skillcheck Addons and it's also a solid addon.  It *is* worth noting that the Uncommon Dress (confusingly named Green Dress), is better than it's Rarer counterpart in regards to Skillcheck odds.
---
Another powerful addon to keep in mind is Class Photo, since it allows you to keep people asleep far more easily.  Pair it with a Range Addon for maximum fun.
---
Watch Scott Junds Huntress Guide on YouTube it’ll help you be a better huntress. 
---
He is right
---
Just get caught, get saved and go do some gens
---
The more time you waste the killer the more he wants to hook you
---
Repost num #3407
---
There are 4 categories that you need to fill out to get more points. 
---
Running the killer is 1/4 of those.
---
Are you this dense?
---
Operation: Self Care
---
I’m at red ranks and get full lobbies in under 30 seconds. 
---
How about bring his walking speed down to 110-108%, but make revv walking speed equal to normal walking? 
---
Fair enough, I still think that Legion needs slight tweaking.
---
I don't think I even played dbd back then, jeez
---
You guys are suggesting he purposely get caught?! Wow, now I’ve heard everything!
---
Never said otherwise. Just pointed out they never said everyone was included.
---
Initially I assumed you'd get 1 and the others would be in the store, then the PTB offered 2 so I assumed you got them all but the others weren't completely finished or being held as a surprise or something. But they offered them as premium cosmetics, and since that's all they functionally are, I don't really care.
---
*Shrug*
---
But it's funny my post got down voted so much for truth. Not the first time.
---
Usually everyone will get hit then healed for points. The other day this happened and the killed had NOED and 3 of us got downed. The 4th almost did as well but got body blocked by one of us accidentally. 
---
They are farming blood points and they hit the air because they don't want to get kicked
---
[removed]
---
Kinda off topic but are they dating? Or is it a different Scott he talks about? Lol
---
You come here often?
---
Crutch perks like hex: ruin and sloppy butcher are good. I like to use monitor and abuse because legion have a super small terror radius already. Maybe late game perks like remember me or fire up? Ive been wanting tk experiment if it takes me longer to feral frenzy then m1 to down a survivor or if i use feral frenzy 3 times to down a survivor. You really have to read the situation as legion
---
Dont gen rush and thoose pwrks wont be necessary
---
How does Green chain add-on work btw? Does it only proc when you sleep them 2nd time, or it keeps working the entire match once you sleep them twice? 
---
Devs dont care
---
the longest
---
God can you even not be rude to strangers? Apparently not...
---
It's not that though. The issue is that you shorten the game by killing them one hook earlier. That means one less hook, less hits and less chasing. Furthermore, it also means you don't get to use a BP offering for yourself. 
---
New perk, The ankle break!  When a survivor is hooked for the first time the killer has the option to perform the ankle break manoeuvre, when unhooked the survivors speed is lessened and any evasive perks are considerably less effective.  
---
Perk can only be used on 2 different survivors once, only one ankle can be broken per survivor! 
---
Crutch perk that!
---
You're welcome!
---
You deserved that
---
Yeah it’s a old bug that somehow seems to comeback every now and then 
---
I dunno, survivors expect killers to leave the hook so they can get rescued...
---
Get em frank
---
Don't say stuff like that, next he'll be insinuating that you can't read.
---
I think that would make dodging and counterplay a lot harder, there'd be a lot less downside to just back-revving constantly. IMO there's not really a way to make a 110% killer viable without a looping deterrent.
---
Voice chat would be so fun in this game. It was my favorite part of Damned. A super low voice talking at me when I'm being chased would be dope. 
---
Also addons like frank's mixtape and both the filthy blade and the rusty blade addons are good. I like to use susie's mixtape for speed. It just depends
---
I’m confused, you just implied there were survivors as Kill God Michael 
---
Ive gotten that a bunch too. I dont see how they would be farming. And then as soon as the survivors leave the host disconnects immediately which makes me think that theyre bots
---
Ahh thought you mass printed them at first 🙁
---
When did valve agree to add bill from l4d 2  and why
---
Exact post and they credited the post 
---
Just simply pointing out that it's much easier for you to change the thing you're doing.
---
HAIL
---
I would hope not, they are extremely frustrating and broken as a killer cant even hear the fuze and the animation is hard to depict too 
---
Are you trying to imply that there *is* a way to win a match in DbD? Because, if so, please, enlighten us all. Post a screenshot of the game saying, "You won the round!" or something to that extent. I'll be waiting. 
---
Personally I prefer rotating the stick when Wiggling than pressing the X button (Ps4 controller) to Struggle.
---
If you're getting chased by the killer the entire game how are you ever meant to fulfill any of the other categories? Unless the killer is stupid, it's pretty much impossible to fully escape them without getting downed.
---
1. Its been like this from the start and isnt that big a deal. 
---
2. I dont care about this one either way so no comment.
---
3. The hatch is fine as is, there doesnt need to be a "fix".
---
4. What exactly is wrong with the code?
---
5. They cant just yeet out a buff without testing shit, give them time.
---
6. New objectives wont change how stale it is. If gens are going by too fast it's the killer's fault for not applying enough pressure.
---
7. If you DC too often, you do get banned. So I have no idea what this one is about.
---
🤣🤣🤣😋
---
Actually im good with the amount of friends i have, its all about quality. ;)  
---
But you can do this easily by yourself, it costs me like 7$ and 3 Hours of work from wich 2 was sitting and waiting for the  papier-mâché to get dry enough to paint on it. :)
---
It's not like you really get a chance if the killer is tunneling you until all 5 gens are up.
---
R 9 killer R11 surv . 2xbloodpoints best
---
Juking, having teammtes help, pallets, windows, the fuckload of perks that are literally built to help survivors get away. Need I say more?
---
He’s saying he doesn’t like the point system, and if the solution is to let yourself be hooked then he’s absolutely right. That’s seriously the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard with regards to this game.Yeah, let me give up this chase and go stand under the hook...and possibly get camped. Sounds like a good plan.
---
Then you simply won't get that many points.
---
Hot darn!
---
If a good killer is tunneling you then it's practically impossible to fully get away from them. The only real way to get them completely off your ass is to get downed, hooked, and rescued. It seems kind of weird for the game's point system to encourage failure.
---
I have this issue with various characters. Some characters have their outfits fully reset and then someone like Feng has the body and legs reset, not the head. It's really weird and pretty annoying.
---
Yeah but is that really your fault? Why should you be punished for managing to waste the killer's time on your own the entire match while all of your teammates just sat on gens the entire game? 
---
*Will Smith meme*
---
Tunneling can be a challenge to get around, but it's not impossible. Killers like Freddy are literally built to tunnel and still have a tough time doing so.
---
Don't need the BP I do it just to ruin other people's day
---
Appears to be the fatigue sorta thing when Frenzy ends. I don't know if it's just me but I really don't feel that Cold Dirt is worth it.
---
*So we let a person have invincibility because of a perk?* People constantly say that as a counter statement for Decisive. But having to just not chase a person fundamentally breaks the game, because if a person who can run around a T well has this perk, they essentially become unkillable with the “just don’t chase them” mentality.
---
i’ve had more farming games in the last week than i’ve ever had playing this game in total
---
You mean that you added new words to someone else's photo? This is a repost.
---
I do similar shit with spirit, baiting people into thinking you arent the real you is fun
---
I’m gonna assume that’s your way of dismissing his argument because you’re too dim witted to come up with a clever response. 
---
Not saying it's the survivor's fault, just that they won't get much points for doing just that. Also note that the other survivors won't get any altruism points or very many boldness points as long as the killer's chasing the same person.

Good thing 2019 is the year of the Pig ;)

I like the pig because shes stealthy

Gbo runk

Honestly a sequel would be the best option.  The game is old at this point.  How much can they really do to improve it?  It has exactly one game mode.  Look at Last Year: The Nightmare.  The gameplay takes the DBD formula and greatly expands on it.  They need to look at that and figure out how to make their game fresh and exciting in this ever changing industry.  Their biggest problem is that the game just isn’t that interesting anymore, and I think they know that, so they implemented the cosmetics store to earn some money (I hope) to fund a sequel.  I mean, I love the game, but I don’t play it much anymore because I don’t see the value in repeating the same thing over and over with very little reward.
---
Make sure it's safe to weild in case of accidents... Wouldn't want to lose a foot now would you?
---
That’s amazing! You should draw Laurie getting stalked by Michael next. 
---
Maybe a game mode if they ever add those in, it would certainly be interesting. 
---
I like her hair a lot :0 
---
Jake and... Hooks? Like a passionate... hooking? xD Also, thanks!
---
Stop being a salty sack of shit killer main lmao
---
Lmfao, lmfao, lmfao
---
It's amusing that someone who plays this game with a coordinated team using VOIP is complaining about an add-on. SWF gives an advantage to the survivors beyond any perk or add-on in the game. If you don't think it does then you're biased.
---
:)
---
I hope so. I used to have a lot of fun playing it and I know I’m not like.... super talented with it but like I said I used to play way better just because the game wasn’t a dumpster fire 
---
4. T-pose, people slide around like were playing quake, survivors just run on spot at the exit gate. Tons of broken shit in this game my dude don't deny it
---
hahahaha
---
let me tell you a story, op.
---
this one time I was playing with me friend. she's a bit toxic and likes to abuse the game. aka taking killers on infinite loops, abuse pallets, L and T-walls. some could say it's okay to but for me... I do not like it. maybe because I'm killer main, maybe because my favourite superhero is Batman and my sense of justice got hurt in early childhood.
---
so it was Badham. game just started and I straight away got found by a Pig. took her on two loops around the school. let her smack me once and then changed direction instead of abusing the fact she will lose Bloodlust on there. dropped a pallet and went down. this only gave the team time to find and cleanse the Ruin and I was pretty happy about it because I got my chase points, didn't abuse anything and the Ruin is gone.
---
what happened next? well, I got face camped. saved with bt, tunneled, face camped to death.
---
obviously, I stayed till the end of the match since my friend is still there and I'm actually pretty salty because I don't know this person and was curious if they're just like that or I got some special treatment.
---
well, my friend and everyone else were just doing gens. Pig let them do that. in the end chat the killer on my question "wtf?" replied: I hate toxic people. you were abusing preschool window 10 times and dropped a pallet. I bet you abuse Ironworks window too. come on, it's Christmas.(&lt;- see the irony, right? :D that was painfully idiotic, hypocritical and funny)
---
this person literally insulted and punished one of the fairest dbd players. I specifically choose to not be toxic. it's my decision disregard the fact *I have the technology*.
---
naturally, this led to me losing temper in the game. and unfortunately next killer was Pig(not the same one but I held a grudge against all of them that evening). I kited, taunted and abused everything I could to remove that undeserved frustration. for 5 gens, yes. my head does this stupid thing - what's the point in being good if they will say you're bad. be bad, at least bad treatment will be deserved. 
---
so, yeah. it's actually real easy to kite any killer that is not so good for 5 gens. if the killer is good, you won't last longer than 2 :D there's nothing you should be rewarded for because I know for a fact without abusing the game mechanics there's no way to kite a killer for longer than 2 gens.
---
and don't fukin forget that because you "did the hardest part", others missed out in altruism and chase. therefore no one got good points and pips cause you decided to be a little rat and "what am I supposed to go down if they can't catch me?". yes, yes you are if you want better points. 
---
if you just like being toxic - by all means, abuse the game how you like. but don't come and complain and insult people telling you how the game works and what you should have done to get the points. this system was specifically created so everyone would be more motivated to engage in chase and do all possible objectives too. 
---
like holy hag, people...
---
I just received the December one a couple days ago here in England. Thanks so much it’s going on my wall 😎
---
So dokkaebi from siege as a psychopathic killer, cool
---
Do you run to trap your totems? I absolutely follow the Hag using Urban Evasion whenever I spawn near enough.
---
That’s amazing. Although one question has the clown been working out? He looks like he’s getting into shape lol 
---
Know when to spread pressure and when to go for a down with Legion. When all survivors are healthy try to get 3 or 4 of them injured and the go for a chase with one.
---
I like the drawing :) hate the killers 💀
---
They are going to be doing little update patches. So it’s going to get better hopefully 
---
I was asking, not denying. While those are issues, they arent game breaking or bad to the point of needing to be prioritized. Idk about t-posing as it hasn't happened often enough for me to take notice of it, but the other two dont actually prevent you from doing anything.
---
To be fair if you do manage to get good on nurse on console she’s amazing 
---
Why is kate naked?
---
I giggled :3
---
*"Are you going to do the ora ora thing?"*
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**"YES YES YES!!!"**
---
Myers is a weird killer to me. He's all about waiting, so if you are patient and smart, you'll do okay. Same goes for the survivors too, outlast the tier three and... he's pretty eh.
---
Thanks. I hate it
---
Sounds like you're already decided against it. I'd look into Last Year or whatever, seems more like F13.
---
Play kyf 
---
Who ever designed the legion legit let their 5 year old do it
---
rank 1 myself and I have only seen one or two good nurses but when they good they destroy its pretty scary 
---
i had a meyers burn a lerys offering and one of the randoms put up a swamp offering, loaded in on swamp and the killer left right away
---
You can get through ruin without hitting greats, its pretty easy as long as everyone is working on gens. Instead of half the team looking for ruin.
---
OP can be a little bitch baby and be right at the same time.
---
I completely agree. I’ve gotten stomped but do you really want to go through the hassle of learning the nurse?
---
Guys be afraid to moan,  meanwhile me in my girl's ear like:
---
"You want penis enlargement pills"
---
Thanks for going into such detail!
---
Unless the exit is nearby, in which case you're screwed either way. 
---
Yeah but they worked fine till they updated the engine 
---
Reposting an ages old meme "with slightly different caption" doesn't equal to having made it yourself.
---
When you grab someone but the game makes you stay stuck in the grab animation for 30 seconds while they run away.
---
I haven't played for a while. Did they finally put shirtless Meyers in the game or is this a nice photoshop 
---
They want their pity escape, they can earn it.
---
Yeah, yeah I stole it and reposted and all that stuff 
---
Depends honestly once you do learn her you can have a lot of fun although since you would be ending games super fast idk how fun that would be after awhile 
---
Trapper has just given up in the background 
---
i like him
---
When the myers is using a scratched mirror and some random burns a game offering.
---
One perk no add-ons Hag 4K challenge. What’s her Twitch?
---
Sometimes I think Billy mains forget M1 exists!
---
So it's stupid to expect players to be well-rounded and play the objectives? Are you serious? If someone wants to play a single role, they need to go play Last Year which rewards fixating on a role. 
---
As the other person said kill your friends would let you practice, but honestly rank doesn't have a very strong correlation with skill and if you're good then you will rank up and getting better is more important than ranking up. Don't be afraid of the losses, especially when learning a character and experimenting. Rank means basically nothing and resets every month anyway. Accept you might have some rough games in the learning process and just keep at it.
---
It’s how I feel with Freddy. I played him and had so much fun until I ran out of class photos. I still have fun with him but can’t play him nonstop like I used to. Variety is the spice of gaming. 
---
If only there was a way to nod at killers while on the hook
---
I'm curious. How can I find it on Instagram? 
---
I get what you're saying BUT I THINK the game is saying "Hey, you weren't able to break the chase and do other things you only ran in a way the killer could find you."
---
Always Max sense. 
---
It's a fan made piece by someone with much more talent than myself for this sort of thing.
---
&gt;  I don’t want an unrelated debate on my post
---
Yeah, that's not how Reddit works. You don't get to moderate your posts.
---
Same honestly. I don’t know what it is, but I love these shitty Canadian teens. (Except Susie; she’s precious nobody be mean to her.)
---
/r/dbdgonewild
---
I'M SO SORRY MEG I WAS ONLY FAKING HOOK IT WAS JUST A PRANK BRO, WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU HATCH WHEN YOU DC'ED :( &lt;/3
---
Ah yes, I've had that spot too.
---
I think I stopped using Ruin around that point.
---
they are probably just mad and "try" to get you mad. Dont know tho, Survivor Mains think in strange ways
---
JUST ALWAYS ASSUME BBQ THO
---
What/who is this from?
---
Always max sensitivity for both sides otherwise your at a disadvantage
---
Me 
---
Oh it's this post again. Must be Friday.
---
I used one green mori all event, by your hands kill a survivor with the trapper nice 60k used it on the guys final hook 😁
---
Do you have a Twitter/website/place I can support you and your awesome art and awesome attitude?
---
I doubt he’s seriously playing the game to purposely get hooked as has been suggested though.
---
At what point are we going to blame the killer for being a complete idiot? Somehow, this has gotten spun into being the fault of a survivor that the killer keeps chasing them instead of changing to a new target.
---
That’s what I’m running   Just makin sure there isn’t anything else I can toggle   Thx
---
OH I DEFINITELY DO
---
Cause it’s so easy to break chase in these big ass open maps
---
That’s what I’m running. I was just makin sure there isn’t anything else to toggle. Thx
---
It’s all about making sure tier three is ready at all times and not spending too much time prioritizing chase over gettin tier three. Especially when you have a survivor hooked, try to get tier three up for next chase. Then it all comes down to timing on when to use it. I always like to see if I can get someone to loop the shack so I can bait down god pallet
---
Depends on the ranks of the survivors and how many survivors there are in the party, I believe 
---
looks great man! you should do the huntress' axe next!
---
For some reason when I play swf with my friends on ps4 we either find a game instantly or never. When I solo queue it works fine. I swear this game hates console, it runs at like 2fps and turns my ps4 into a jet engine 
---
Did I threaten to call the Reddit police ? No. I said please move along. And they are continuing to argue so I’m just being petty and downvoting their comments instead of saying anything. 🙄
---
I would love if killers could speak but survivors couldn’t. It would ruin the scariness of the game but it would be hilarious and wouldn’t ruin the balance. 
---
I like this but the conflict perk would have to be changed because every other obsession perk only allows 1 obsession so maybe have a different way of telling other than obsession.
---
I’d say anything that lets you do what earns you points faster works best. Your build seems very heal off hook however instead of Self Care maybe some exhaustion perk to help in chases. 
---
Out of curiosity, what are the ways to max survival and boldness then, in a normal way. You cant go near the killer, you dont have items and there are 3 other survivors. How do you max boldness and survival? dont think I need to add that afking the basement for boldness doesnt count. It has to be done in a timely manner or there is no point to it. Serious question, no sarcasm.
---
Susie with bloddy smirk mask and the overpriced Karambit
---
If your TV has game mode, use that mode instead of the normal one.  It really is like night and day.  I previously missed some checkskills but now I can hit them easily.
---
DEAR SIRVIVOR, IF I AM A FUCKING KILLER, IM TRYING YO FUCKING KILL YOU, HAVENT YOU SEE TERROR MOVIES? SAW? FINAL DESTINATION? JASON? WHEN THEY DIDNT CHASE SOMEONE AND FUCKING KILL IT? IT IS NOT CAMPING CHASING A RESCUER THAT IS HERE IN THE WINDOW WAITING FOR MI TO IGNORE HIM.
---
I just set my ps4 profile to not accept pms except from friends. You can’t talk sense into these people and you’ll continue to get flamed randomly when you get above two kills. I’ve never had a survivor pm me with anything overtly positive, just one request to farm.
---
On console it's probably between Billy and spirit although if you are on xbox if you pick spirit I will hate you because I hate her and everybody and there mother plays her it seems.
---
this nurse reeks of stupidity.
---
If you play 4-6 hours a day you can get 4k in a weekend...
---
SURVIVORS DISCONNECTING ON THE FIRST TAKE DOWN OF THE MATCH AS I GO TO PICK THEM UP... WHY!?
---
Had a Freddy that camped and tunneled the entire game. It was my friend and I and two randoms so no gens were getting done during this. He’d just put both survivors asleep after the unhook and tunnel the hooked player down. Pretty much every Freddy I’ve played has done this tho so I wasn’t necessarily surprised. I understand Freddy is tough to use but man... that isnt enjoyable for either side
---
Yeah but that one literally makes all of your blinks doo doo
---
Sadly not the problem
---
Yeah lol. Keep up the good work 😀
---
I got fooled by OoO the other day. Didn't pick him up cause I thought he had DS aswell. Nope, only had OoO
---
*Sees Blood Warden*
---
Ah, I see you’re a man of culture as well.
---
Sure hope so
---
Tell that to my teammates lol
---
Meg shaking her head killed me.
---
As an old metal head, I can relate to him. Poor Nea sees no action anymore. My bloodwebs weren't as kind as yours, but some amazing games along the way. So many moris dodged.
---
The Frame rate.. he's the best!
---
Meta perks are your friend. Ruin. BBQ &amp; Chili, Nurses calling, sloppy butcher. Monitor &amp; Abuse is great for most killers (best on myers, zero terror radius). Enduring plus spirit fury is a fantastic combo for wrecking pallet loops. 
---
Fun Fact: The skull in nurse calling is winking to yall ;)
---
If you don't mind me asking what killer do you play?
---
yup I like playing freddy as well though windows piss me off lol
---
4-6 hours a day EVERY day isn’t healthy. I play maybe 1-2 hours every other day. 
---
If that’s what Behaviour expects for people to grind for items, that is horrible.
---
Had all four survivors standing around my totem as I was crossing the map when I spawned in. 
---
Bills perks are still available on console just as regular perks like hope or plunderers
---
F
---
You replied to the wrong person OP said that not the one you replied to
---
I don't think there's been a new one since before Freddy.
---
I just want "The Clown is Gassy"
---
You drop any chase that’s being dragged out because it’s not beneficial for the killer. Any survivor could get a killer into an infinite loop, with or without DS. Getting tunnel vision will cause you to get gen rushed and without NOED, you’re more than likely to end up with one or no kills. Leaving a survivor allows you to pursue another in a different location that is more favorable to you. You can later pursue the previous survivor once they’re no longer at their set up, allowing you to get the kill. It’s a common high rank killer strategy, not something that breaks the game. You want to earn your points? Learn when a chase is worth it. 
---
They are always surprised when it actually happens. Just like with Urgot. Freddy will be reworked 2019.  
---
But lets get spicy: Hatch and DS probably won't cuz fuck you.
---
I had encounters with few of these.  They usually want to de-rank so they do nothing but hit the air the entire game.  
---
Just finish off the gen. Then once all gates are opened, if you want just run around him for a few times, get hit, heal yourself for extra BP then leave the match.  Easy BP.  
---
I don’t exactly agree with it being easy to rank up as survivor as my friends have had a tough time doing that recently. I do definitely think it’s too easy to rank up as killer though. I’ve had many games where I thought I did terrible but somehow managed to rank up or at least not depip
---
Claudette can be very hard to see because of her small size, dark clothing and hair/skin. She can be so hard to see on some maps that it borderlines on being broken. Experienced players who main Claudette are also often toxic to both the killer and survivor, so it’s a bit of a running joke at this point. 
---
Im not saying every day i'm saying on weekends. 4-6 hours a day every weekend  is 15-20k shards a month.
---
Literally only playing on weekends too. You could spread this out to 2 hours a day.
---
I’ve been able to hook a taunting survivor once and yes, it felt EXACTLY like this.
---
Hilarious and delightful. :D
---
This is awesome, dude. Will it come with real blood?
---
These are fantastic! If she ever sells them, let us know!
---
I never disputed your “once in a while”. I never claimed you did anything, every game, I merely quoted you. We all paid money for it yeah? So we can all play how we want.
---
I dont think you have the right the call other people not the brightest or put yourself above them, seeing you are one of them judging from your words here.
---
And yes, I must be a salty survivor main because I quoted someone who afks to noed people. Good thing you arent a salty killer main eh? 🤭
---
Oh okay my bad lol I misunderstood 
---
Thanks, and sadly no. Don't want to end up on a manhunt lol
---
I run Moris just to kill the more problematic survivor, u know, the one that save everyone, everytime, in front of u, don't let you chase another survivor... and then you kill that annoying survivor, just to read on the postgame "camper" "toxic" "reported" f... douchbags they deserve all the moris 
---
And they went and added dark cosmetics! I believe this is a conspiracy used to help people who don't wanna p3 Claudette.
---
Good for him! Glad to see him not giving up on his dreams!
---
lol. I love that it looks like the survivor is just standing still. 
---
Bästa planen någonsin
---
Ok so you give up so the killer can get a hook, and they camp you. What is your response then? I also asked how often you purposely get hooked? I’d like to know. I saw your story below where you got camped/tunneled...all that does is prove my point that its stupid that someone should have to allow themselves to get hooked in order to get decent points.
---
Chris Walker or Trager. Hell, maybe Marta.
---
“ONK”
---
-Every Pig chasing someone.
---
Ah fuck. Didn't expect the stuck Micheal. I laughed way to loud at this.
---
Thought this was a nice find, and as I couldn't find anyone else who made a post about this, I thought I might as well make a guide on how to enable this feature. Here are a few notes about this feature.
---
\-Enabling this feature shows every cosmetic you currently own, whether it can be bought from the shop directly or not. However, for prestige cosmetics, you must own the character's prestige skin in order to see it in the shop.
---
\-This works for every character, including licensed characters.
---
Legion makes me want to dc sometimes too but I think I’d rather follow through with my pledge to never DC in a game.. cuz I know this will be the killer’s reaction anyway
---
[waaaah](https://youtu.be/GwtLrn9ACW4?t=30)
---
That Nea is lagging.  Had this issue before where after 15 seconds they finally had a stable connection to the host and continued the unhook animation.
---
I would love the legion DLC, but I'm happy to earn it over the months I play the game. :)
---
Oh huh! I had never heard of that game, it looks interesting. Is it dead now?
---
My point went completely over your head. If survivors think I'm "afk" and bang out all the gens right? Then neglect to open the gates because t-bagging is more fun....then yes, dumb survivors. 
---
Where as you take my simple comment as a direct insult to you personally. In the end you only prove my point about dumb survivors mains. There's a reason you play the mouse, and I play the cat. 
---
just say gg and leave the lobby, dont even read anything. instantly solves any sort of actual toxicity 
---
It's called lag/bad ping. Also if you're self caring (idk if you were but this is good to know) your hit box is bigger than your actual character.
---
Honest answer, for someone like me who has every single teachable unlocked on everyone both killer and survivor,  what is losing points matter? Not that I do that often...it truly depends on the scenario. I actually typically only dc if I get slugged for more than a minute or obvious lagswitch. But there have been times I've done it out of rage. Getting tunneled or farmed 10 games in a row makes people do stupid things. 
---
Why tf is that a thing
---
what's a big ass map then? Mother's Dwelling where you can literally hide anywhere or abuse the main building? or maybe Ormond with thousands of corners? or do you mean Swamp maps with tons of obstacles and hiding spots where it's easy to juke, break the chase and hide? what do you mean by big ass opened maps? only big ass opened map is Rotten Fields where you have all that corn at your disposal. 
---
You unlock the teachables at 30,35,40
---
Ah my mistake. 
---
Where’s the Yakety Sax music? Jeez that was glorious. 
---
Miss Piggy can teabag, albeit very slowly. 
---
VERY slowly. 
---
U can also just repeatedly gen tap it so u don’t get skill checks. There are quite a few ways to counter killer perks with just normal gameplay mechanics right now. Bbq for example has I think half a dozen counters give or take
---
I have my TV set to game mode, and all my other games are crisp and I have fine control. I wish that was the problem but sadly it’s just dbd’s FPS. Thanks!
---
Better graphics. Sound cues you’ve never heard. Fairly certain you can’t see your teammates blow a skill check on Xbox. On pc you will. Overall better experience IMO.
---
Trust him guys, he's a doctor
---
For the most part, solo players can be almost just as coordinated or aware as swfs. It's just, the ranking system is so bad, most players at high ranks are pretty bad and shouldn't be there.   I play killer too. Yall exaggerate the swfs benefits.
---
Most of the time when I swf it's with no voice and the killer always blames his loss on "coordinated swf bs" we lel everytime bc we never spoke a word to each other. Lately solo has been like playing against 4 killers.  
---
Extra BP plus presents that give rare stuff like moris.  
---
  
---
They should just be free and give a random amount oo extra points.
---
Seems fine to me. Climbing steadily on my survivor. My killer rank not so much. Feels like those games last maybe 5 mins maybe 6. I’m about to just stop dealin with swf groups
---
smoother frames (hopefully) and killer and some survivors are better at the game
---
hey rory didnt expect to see you here
---
Sound cues? I noticed on xbox I cant hear survivors nearly at all unless they are 3inches from me and I use a headset. 
---
So you're the artist?
---
You said it's just people being salty for choosing to go into a high ping game. I'm telling you you call get into a green ping game and still get into a laggy host's game. 
---
Hatch seriously needs to be changed though. It makes me mad because it was so close to being balanced when Killers could close it. All they needed to do from there was make gens get done quicker after the hatch was closed and have Survivor auras revealed after they didn't do anything for long periods of time. 
---
the ostrich should have the dc symbol on it. it's ridiculous how many people dc the moment they realize it's a Legion
---
That  mask didn't exist in the game until December. That man is obviously a time traveler.
---
At least I’ll die with a raging boner
---
This looks like those drawings from scary stories to tell in the dark.
---
Equip Ruin, Bbq, Sloppy Butcher and bloodhound. 
---
Stab someone twice, walk backwards 5 steps. Then look at the red carpet. 
---
Follow red carpet to easily down survivor who has no escape options and is an easy down.
---
Proceed to play your single player game where every down is 20 seconds regardless of skill, and feel good about yourself for getting to the top on the cheesiest pile of macaroni you ever did build.
---
Na, they don't impact your BP gains much in a positive way.  If you Mori instead of hook for your third hook, you gain some bonus BP compared to hooking them (About 300), but otherwise you are losing some potential BP if you are Mori'ing on the second down.
---
Notably, the only BP you can't "farm" is Sacrifice, all other BP can reach the cap without more than a single survivor to continuously mess with.  The only way to go over the "cap" of 8k potential BP (getting all 12 hook stages across the 4 survivors) is to use Moris on third downs.  In this case, you can miss one, maybe 2, of the hook stages
---
The big advantage of Moris is they let you shorten the survivor's game.  By killing one instantly on second down after that hook, you reduce how much gen pressure the survivors have by a lot, and makes them VERY skittish of you incase it is an ebony and not just a green mori.  Mori'ing instead of third hook/down meanwhile is a BP bonus to you, keeps your hook from being perma-broken, and overall doesn't impact the BP the survivor would have gotten.  Its a far less assholish thing to 3 down mori.
---
Btw is there a designated keyboard/mouse cleaner person for these events? I'd be scared to touch anything if not...

Killer mains who bought all the other killers by the store DLC don't get killer shards.  This means they are flooded with Moris or other ultra-rare addons.

I GO AGAINST A TRAPPER WITH RUINS,AND IN LIKE 2 MINS HIS HEX GETS CLEANSED SO HE DISCONNECTS, MEANING I GET NO BLOODPOINTS,AND I DE-PIP??? WTF WHY DO I SUFFER BECAUSE THE KILLER IS SALTY EVEN THO ONE GEN WAS DONE!!!

It's not worth it, save your money
---
I just camped 2 people because i asked them if they wanted to farm and i put my party streamer and they said no thanks so i camped them and i finished with 75k and they got 4k. Word of advice is that you do what the killer says because he might camp you
---
Not a negative comment about you in any way but he'd have had you dead if he'd just used the hammer. Multiple times he'd have gotten a hit. You don't need to chainsaw *all the time*.
---
Yeah she definitely has an eye for detail!
---
Lol I'll let her know
---
So that obvious killer main deleted all of his comments.  Sorry for the heat on your post but like I said, this sub is mostly salty killer mains who you’ll get no sympathy from. Im on ps4 as well. If you wanna SWF sometime lmk.

Can't be picky it's a Christmas present from a someone who doesn't game at all lol she did a fantastic job
---
Upvote because Bob Ross is my hero. 
---
I lol’d when I saw they were deleted. My tag on ps4 is the same as here without underscores 
---
Yes my good sir. Hybrid Panda has given me way to many lol's with it to not be one of my favorites 
---
I'll let her know!
---
But i have fun playing him. i know not everyone loves him but i do.
---
yeah it wasn't, I think you should add a bit more tone on the "collar" of the tank top for that. Nice drawing though!
---
Too many hilly mains to change that
---
That's what I said!
---
Lol word, sent.
---
i gave up on huntress in ps4, that impossible
---
I don’t get it too, people who do that are dumb because like you said they the only person who lost out there. For me, that’s just even more of a win because he’s rage quit, and have me extra points. Even if they dc before I get some points, all your doing is being toxic too your other survivors. It makes the game easier for the killer when you dc lol
---
Oh, I didn't think of that, makes some sense as well! Thanks for another explanation.
---
I was going further and looking for any leftover totems and items as the killers don't seem to disconnect, but I got bodyblocked the last time I did that.
---
I wonder why that is...? I thought it would just be a common thing during the event, I hadn't met farmers like this before the event ended. 
---
Billy and Legion Rank 1, no addons, am I big pp?
---
“They should change”
---
LMAO!
---
why does this one have tefillin? are they cosplaying Jewish Trapper? very progressive, finally some good fukin recognition of my people 👌
---
Same. I always say “darn” in post game if I have a bad game with Freddy
---
Maybe if billy and nurse weren’t so ahead of the pack when it comes to the rest of the killers they could then move all the killers in the right direction rather then just having 2 viable 
---
Yeah I'm a spirit main and she's stupid strong. I think she's the best killer on console and second best on PC.
---
I feel bad for that billy
---
Upgrade Jeff for aftercare because it is much better than bond.
---
They made these new things that are 100% lore now, they are called books.
---
i love playing as legion
---
Damn, I'm on rank 1 killer from 3 seasons, yet I never got to &gt;30k BP, how's that even fair? Yet u did it with your first game
---
Legion. point and pip making machine instead of a killer. 
---
FACTS. It really be like that. Smfh
---
WHY ARE THERE 5 TOTEMS, 200+ HOURS AS A SURVIVOR MAIN AND ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WERE 4
---
no mistakes just happy accidents ;)
---
What about spirit and huntress?
---
I noticed that too, got 1 kill and pipped at my 2nd game
---
Unpopular Opinion: 
---
Metal theme is really meh, I’d rather have the OG music
---
This is absolutely incredible. You should sell these. I'd buy one.
---
In a perfect world, but most likely what would happen is that lot of survivor mains would just start crying for nerfs.
---
Yea that exact thing happened to me earlier. I was killer and used party streamers plus the survivors used party streamers plus envelope plus escape cake so I really tried to help them farm. None of them responded to that and they were also clearly SWF as well... I was just shaking my head at them at the end of the game like smhhhhhh
---
Spirit w/o cooldown = Nurse 2.0
---
Huntress can be severely limited by the kind of map you get so she stays mid tier, Spirit is 4th best because she has good mind games but lacks map pressure and sometimes you can guess wrong
---
I know right!? If i want to play as a 3 man group then were fucked cause we have to wait ALOT. I dont know why it takes so long, even as a 2 man it takes considerable amount of time. What i dont get is if i solo que then i can find a game pretty fast, less than a minute. Its pretty mind blowing.
---
I had a legion hard core tunnel me till I got downed because I couldn't mend myself as he was chasing me along the edges of the map. Jesus, dude. If you are this bad at the game, you should stop tunneling and work on other stuff. 
---
Gen rushing doesn't prevent the killer from playing his game. Tunneling prevents survivors from playing theirs. Simple logic. If you feel that people gen rush, use ruin and no Ed. 
---
Good advice, except for one thing. 
---
You can not play around with the first survivor, you have to down him/her asap to apply pressure to the survivors.
---
The art is called 'Undead Giant' by Christian Bravery aka The Brave, I can't find an original post or link to it though
---
I literally got Adept Legion playing them for the 5th time where once it was on ptb. all on red ranks. nice assumption. I even mentioned I can't do Nurse cause she hard and I suck.
---
 I hate Legion because they don't require skill or time when using their good add-ons and very annoying to play against. and how ridiculously easy it is to rank up with them which leads to more and more unskilled killers on rank 1 that will most likely camp and tunnel like it already happened after Clown update where they turned ranking into a joke. I remember before Clown update Billies were never main campers. they were skilled players who never tried hard on already strong killer. and overall red ranks were sweaty but definitely more skilled on killer side. now they're pathetic. 
---
Then you are not a good killer. Even if I am having a bad game, I don't tunnel. I don't want others to have a bad game just because I am incompetent as fuck. 
---
Because huntress is unplayable with smaller hitboxes. Also we dont have server yet, so you have to deal with 140 pings most of the time.
---
I think dcs lose 2 pips. 
---
I do. I ignore them. But again, it depends on the time. If I see them after a lone time (probably 40 seconds after they got unhooked), I will down them. They got 40 seconds to get to a pallet or even hide. It's their mistake.
---
Mirror addon lets Meyers see survivors througg walls up to a certain distance but prevents him from leaving tier 1 Evil Within meaning that he's quite slow and has a shite lunge but has a super small terror radius allowing him to go full stealth mode.
---
As a huntress main on xbox i feel all your pain.  Every ounce of fps drops the second you release a hatchet. All the why didn't that hit?!
---
I feel you
---
Scratched mirror makes it so Michael cant go above Tier 1 Evil Within, but in turn let's him see survivor auras within 12m or so. 
---
It only really works on Lery's and The Game where you can actually sneak up on survivors. If you run it on any other map you're basically fucked.
---
Ah, you said it felt balanced with an accompanying photo of a 4K so I just assumed. My b dawg. 
---
now I'm curious
---
haha I remember reading those and freaking out at the pictures :P
---
thanks! 
---
If Mortal Kombat X can have it, why can't we?
---
Yah I feel you when you say that. My swf group is just a bunch of dummies (me included) who act stupid and have a good time. I do still hate toxic swfs as I’ll always be a killer at heart, but it’s nice to see nice swfs and I make sure to play in a way that provides a fun experience for everyone. But yah toxic swfs can go rot lol
---
Bruh, the first thing I did when they added the shop was get all of her dark cosmetics because I didn't want to prestige. LOL 
---
I didn't say you gotta play around :D I specifically mentioned that IF time allows, you gotta milk out the chase points. like if there are two people left, one hooked, one in chase. don't just down them, spend few more seconds in chase to max it if you need it. 
---
It’s hag, she’s a lot better with her recent buff of faster trap placement and a reduced terror radius.
---
Wait until they start leaving comments on your profile ... Wear them like a badge of honor my friend 
---
Yes they do
---
I'm tempted to upvote just 'cause it's not a picture taken with a phone.
---
weird. that's really weird. but I still think you should do the three killers I listed. from my Clown games I never got 32k either. something was always missing. 
---
I DON'T REALLY LIKE TALKING IN ALL CAPS BUT I DONT KNOW WHERE TO PUT THIS. WHY IS ANGRYPUG LIKE HE IS? I PLAY ONE MATCH WITH HIM AND HE CALLS ME "HOT GARBAGE" AND HE AND HIS CHAT PROCEED TO CALL ME OUT AND "TEACH ME" HOW TO PLAY THE GAME. I'M LEGACY 3 AND THE SAME RANK AS HIM ON BOTH SIDES. I DON'T REALLY GET HOW HE CAN KEEP ALL OF HIS SPONSERS BY BEING A COMPLETE DICK ALL THE TIME, I WISH HE WOULD JUST SWALLOW HIS EGO FOR ONCE AND ACTUALLY BE A DECENT HUMAN BEING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE.
---
Yes, but imagine doing 3 gens and bringing hope as well. Holy 116% move speed
---
Wait so is the Shockwire Trap just "You are injured now"? Because if so then that would be incredibly overpowered.
---
Oh okay I didn't know about that. Thanks 
---
At least for survivors. You make dick playing survivor. 
---
You're just bad. 
---
so you dont actually have to survive or kill all 4 to climb the ladder?
---
I visited my buddy out in Philly but I brought my Xbox, wasn’t missing out on those bps. 
---
Things voice chat would be used for:
---
A. People being toxic as hell at each other.
---
B. Playing rap music really fucking loudly over your mic 24/7. 
---
it's not a good question to ask, you know. especially if something of this kind has happened to a person(which is really none of your business if it did). besides, after asking this "question not assumption", you proceeded to being aggressive. 
---
you might say you were not, sure but then I wasn't passive aggressive. I was and am frustrated because thing I liked got ruined. it has nothing to do with my life. and I don't sit here "asking" you why you reply on someone's frustrated comments, suggesting you might be really lonely and looking for at least some attention therefore using as strong words as possible waiting for a reaction. 
---
come on, mate. I bitch on the internet because I like it. doesn't mean my life is or was bad. I do miss father but oh well I'm 27 it is no longer an issue for me like it was when I was 16. 
---
I'm you shld play both sides until you can make that decision yourself, that an playing both sides will help your gameplay.
---
I love this response. 
---
Ayyye
---
But Decisive guarantees that the chase won’t be worth it.
---
That would be awesome, and at least with the quick heal it would hopefully encourage more altruism over hook dives.
---
So they can nerf the Styptic addon, Borrowed Time, and Unbreakable.
---
I'm glad I wasnt the only one who thought that!
---
I would recommend survivor if you have others to play with you. You can talk on chat and learn strats, how to save, etc while having a reliable net- and if you have 5, kill your friends is a great no penalty way to learn as you don't get it loose anything from playing.
---
If youre on your own though, killer is a great thing because it teaches you their viewpoints. I learned a lot about how to hide from watching the survivors I hunt and knowing exactly how the field of view works
---
Unfortunately the body of that post is deleted so I can't read it. What did it say?
---
His name is My Totem, respect his totems. 
---
-My Totem
---
Finally, a dildo worth my ti-I meeaaannnn... Cool cleaver!
---
god damn, op, I came here to bitch on you for using killer I hate but you turned out to be the only normal person in whole thread. 
---
I think a good change would at least be it only works if you have been hooked before or some stipulation. Its ridiculous when you can just clear house if everyone is at the wrong place in the wrong time.
---
When you grab someone but the game says ["go fk urself baby killer"](https://streamable.com/oik5t) and you get stuck in place very confused.
---
I mean...there's usually a reason serial killers have multiple kills and take a while to get caught...
---
But for real. This is one of the truest tips, unless you've been getting completely destroyed and that single weak survivor is going to be your ONLY kill, always save them for last. Usually I hook them at the most once, and then just continuously slug them. In a SWF they are almost 100% guaranteed To draw at least one person to come help them. Let them pick the weak survivor up, then go after the new one. Find the weak one again? (Usually those weak players are really easy to find and the more stress you put on them the more often you're going to run into them) Slug them again. If you can prevent them from ever healing fully back up, you essentially force the rest to play a man down. If you can do it while also chasing a second survivor or have a second survivor on hook, then they are playing TWO men down. Those weak survivors are less likely to do objectives when hurt, and will actively seek out their friends for healing, even if they have self care. And no, I'm not talking about tunneling. The point isn't to actually kill them. And it's also not really to chase them all game either. The point is to give them just enough attention to stress them out, scare them away from risks and objectives (basically anything can draw more attention to them) and make them call for help. Tunneling straight out on someone isn't fun and it's a scummy thing to do, and these days will likely just make them quit. And then you loose your bait.
---
Also! Learn to corral survivors into areas you want. Areas where there's little or no pallets, away from infinite loops, into traps, or one of my favorites, towards known locations of other survivors. 
---
Clown kinda spook I think.
---
Why is this a thing 
---
Weirdly enough i read that even before i noticed this comment.
---
I love it
---
I would agree if taken to the extreme with either of those plays. Only going after one player to the exclusion of all others regardless of the practicality is bad play by the killer and it sucks for the survivor. Camping is also kind of a grey area. Everyone has a different line for what constitutes camping. My rule of thumb is that a killer shouldn't be stationary, they should always be actively moving and searching for something, even if it is searching around a hook.
---
yeah, that's correct. iirc as surv you just need to get gold or platinum in 1 category to not lose a pip. I'm not sure about killer. 
---
So as survivor you can play boldly, altruistically, or gen focused, and still rank up if you do at least 2 of those things, even if you die.
---
 
---
it's probably better to, if you want to rank up. I was very stealthy before, I started ranking up much faster once I started doing more bold/altruistic stuff, just to try to get better at looping.

LITHE DEAD HARD BALANCED LANDING VIGIL YEEEEEET TIME TO NYOOOM BOIS
---
Yeah you 100% have autism, not daddy rape. You literally have 0 understanding of how anything works and cant understand social cues. Now give me another long ass insignificant reply.
---
You can bitch wherever you want, just dont cry when people put you in your placd for your delusional behavior.
---
Don't know if it's the post you're referring to but here is where I got the picture from.
---
Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9myjk6/shirtless_myers/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
How many died?
---
Forgive me if wrong. Chase music only starts if a survivor is pressing the sprint key right? Are you pressing the sprint key?
---
And you are the reason I scream and scare my dog lol
---
says a person thinking leading question is not an assumption. 
---
it's 32 mt actually and 16 for the vanity mirror
---
Also I would say that The Game map doesn't work very well either for him thanks for having most of the generators in the middle of a wall or a room and it actually has a lot of open areas making it very hard to sneak onto people 
---
*Bing bonging intensifies*
---
I run balanced landing, it makes haddonfield, the game, asylum, and swamp maps abusable. Badham becomes way more toxic. Any of the farm maps can be abused with the combines or lucky hill rng. The only map I find myself fucked by balanced landing is shelter woods.
---
Balanced’s strength is that it turns a dead area into a free speed boost. Can’t loop with lithe since it wastes the speed boost if you don’t run from the vault, sprint burst forces you to walk.
---
Dead hard and balanced landing are the best exhaustion perks in the game imo but only if the survivor knows how to loop properly/knows map spawns 
---
When it comes to corn and swamp, there’s a lot of talented hags who can use the foliage to a huge advantage. By the time survivors get wise, it’s often too late.
---
Also I’m probably the only one, but as a saw fan and someone who prefers indoor maps (especially since it’s two large floors), I have a great time with The Game.
---
Yeah and now fuck off to your psychologist, frustrated little autistic boy. Your parents let you on the internet unsupervised? Shame.
---
Even without scratched mirror any coldwind map will shit on Myers, you can't stalk someone 3 mts in front of you because the corn is denser than a wall
---
To be fair...it was a good perk to use on him already. But yeah. Since the bug is guaranteed to happen with him, EVERYONE runs it. And since it's not limited to him (despite what people think) a lot of people have been running it. But once again to be fair it's a good perk to use. 
---
Sad day
---
IMO you are asking for trouble. Some survivors think everything a killer does is toxic. 3 gen strat with overcharge? Toxic. Using BBQ? Toxic. Guarding two idiots who got caught in the basement? Toxic. NOED, Rancor, Nurse’s, Franklin’s all Toxic. Running Nurse? Toxic. I have literally had people fill my inbox for “camping generators”
---
They had a slug race to the exit, two didn't make it =(
---
I WISH WE COULD TURN DOWN MUSIC VOLUME BUT EVERY PLAYER WOULD DO IT FOR AN ADVANTAGE, BOTH KILLERS AND SURVIVORS. IN THE END THE KILLER HAS A BIGGER ADVANTAGE.
---
you really need attention, I can't leave you like that D: I feel bad you're so lonely
---
I agree. That's a good condition.
---
This boi fast as fuck. Also I don't quite understand the Sand Caked Sandals, sounds like that add on just makes everyone do in one hit
---
umm 
---
lmaooo what’s vigil do again ? Never used it before
---
This happened to me 2 games in a row
---
Camping is when you are near a hooked survivor when you could be going to gens? That is when you have not seen any survivors near the hook 
---
Eh, fair, but The Game is still a far better map for it than Blood Lodge or any Coldwind Farm map.
---
Dude you're severly autistic, for real why do they let you on the internet unsupervised? I guess while you're anonymous it cant hurt, but I feel bad as fuck for you.
---
We need a killer add on for this. 
---
"Grants the ability to teleport the last survivor to the Killer's private lounge, where they will be forced to watch the Killer dirty dance till they bleed out." 
---
Half the time I don’t get any bloodpoints, it’s fucking bullshit especially when I’ve used a rare offering and it’s basically like “oh I’m not doing well against them? Well fuck them this game sucks” 
---
Or the beautiful insta dc when killer sees it’s coldwind 
---
Honestly? I had two survivor mains tune in, and they were very happy to watch. They shared their perspective and i Appreciate it greatly. But Im asking for it, come hyper scrutinize me, I want to play in such a way that conveys the same love for this game that I feel. I talk shit on survivors all the time but I never really ask their perspective. So please, come educate me.
---
You can go Exposed Myers and make survivors shit themselves with the one-shot down or you can go Spooky Tier 1 Myers and make survivors shit themselves with jumpscares
---
but aren't you the one coming back to talk to poor little sick me? to flame my sickness? what does it make you?
---
From what I hear the console versions are buggy as heck, could be another one?
---
Sorry but I CANT
---
Recover from exhaustion faster
---
What hex?
---
He sadd
---
I'm just a regular dude who used to suck major ass at this game, forced myself to learn Nurse and Huntress, and got my ass to Rank 1 with a cheese build Legion to ensure I got that final pip so I wouldn't be tilted the whole night.
---
This is the funniest thing I’ve seen today!!
---
If I were that killer, I would’ve just slugged him while you were down. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
aren't you done with flaming my stupid ass? just few moments ago you claimed that you stopped and presented it as some achievement. 
---
Yep im done with you, your entire history is literally frustration and you're 24/7 on reddit. Find a life and try to get some social skills. Cya.
---
11:30 here too.. but last two nights I was up til 2am playing..the devs need to fix consoles!!!!
---
yeah but if you use the hammer then they call you a M1lly :c  
---
But hammering people makes you feel like a m1llionare &gt;:D
---
Agreed. It's taken me two seasons to get back to rank 1 (I was stuck at 5-7 because of Tunneling and face camping) and I finally made it back thinking it would be fun again like it used to be, smart teammates and challenging but beatable killers.
---
Nope. Hardcore meta perk builds and straight up Tunneling. And plenty of idiotic, selfish, and useless survivors as well. I personally think BBQ is stupidly OP. And started having to use Distortion just to combat it.
---
Siiigh. They really need to change the ranking system again. Half these people in high ranks don't deserve to be there. 
---
p3 50 legion with a majority of the perks xd
---
Worth it
---
I love that they are the most human
---
Just crazy teens
---
said a person with so many years and posts on Reddit who found a time in their busy schedule to reply to such a low life as myself.
---
Its ok dude. Not everyone is like that toxic piece of shit, if you ever need someone to cheer you on DM me.
---
Or if they meme hard enough 
---
Yeah it took much effort to ask if your daddy rapes you and the following 2 sentence replies. Im actually new to this game, i hope the rest of the players arent as toxic shits like you.
---
Give em the ol' working on a gen juke when they camp the hatch 
---
Nah they cant use Sprint Burst within 15m of you. They still get the fake sprint burst after being hit though so they can easily get outside of the 15m.
---
Also yeah I figured if it was hyena themed then make him a fast boi
---
Both, if you only play one side you won't understand the other and will develop a heavy bias overtime, not to mention playing both sides also makes you better at each one, as surv you learn how they think and vice versa. 
---
I'm way too happy over a measly little number next to my name to be brought down by anything. Well, unless my wife suddenly comes into the room and socks me in the jaw. That would probably put a damper on my mood.
---
I mean, its not like you can not look at him while you rev up your chainsaw or anything 
---
I appreciate that though. Sounds like youre a killer main. Tune in next time and give me some pointers! I love learning. MY onl;y goal is to make this community better than it already is.
---
Ps: I DONT recommend tru3 or Tydetyme as a source of learning, tru3 is okay but tyde is a terrible player and seems to think his opinions based on personal misplay facts.
---
No, but she's still devastating.
---
UE does nothing vs Hag if you play her right
---
Because Billy's saw has counterplay, Legion's Frenzy doesn't
---
Nurse, Spirit, Billy/Hag and Huntress are all viable (listed in the order of strength as well btw).
---
Inaccurate, you were able to look around without it looking like a slideshow 
---
and then amount of shit you said to me and continue saying that you forgot to mention.
---
how many more times are you going to be "done" with me yet still reply and spit insults? 
---
Camping the hook for me is when you are near a hook when you don't see any survivors. Simple. If you camp for 2 minutes, you are obviously going to see surviving near the hook. So, don't blame the survivors for being altruistic. It's their job to save them. You saw them because your ass was near the hook instead of leaving to the gens.
---
The last two nights were also double bp, so there’s definitely more people playing during those. Now that it’s back to normal there’s probably just less people online. But yes, overall, matchmaking is pretty bad. Lol
---
I am a killer main. Somedays it feels like the Nam
---
I thought so too, that's what's weird. All of the times i'm encountering it, i'm crouching and not holding the sprint key. 
---
if you were right, I'd admitted it. just like I apologized to op. 
---
Nah, I just recognize it from the way you type and your emotional state.
---
Why are you so frustrated, tell me
---
True. I think they need to remove this add-on and see how Legion does without it. Maybe add some baseline buffs too. Maybe add effect of FM when attacking already injured survivors, so not healing will backfire at survivors. 
---
Why did you leak my killer gameplay?
---
Lol thanks
---
Get BBQ and Chili on your Killers and We're Going to Live Forever on your Survivors ASAP. Makes life so much easier.
---
He seem to enjoy t bag u 
---
Admit it then.
---
Hi Chronos. I always post my new drawings here! :P
---
Aww, that makes me happy! xD Thank you!
---
Thank you!
---
Didn’t even think of the fact these could stack. That just sounds incredibly broken to be moving faster than the killer
---
You're so sweet! I only have Twitch. I mostly Stream DBD/Ark/Forest but I also do drawing videos. My Twitch is RoryDiesALot. I hope I see you there sometime!
---
Nice! I'm glad you like it!
---
Communication based buffs don't affect SWF much because they already know this info through voice comms. Meanwhile randoms make use of it to get closer to SWF in terms of power. After that you can balance the game with assumption that survivors do communicate. 
---
I already told you. my favourite game got ruined by the latest updates and new killer(Legion) is very annoying and renders skill and time completely useless since any person can take Mixtape or/and that other purple add-on and get easy 4k. also I have 7/10 migraine right now which is impossible to cure or lessen with pain killers and only way to deal with it is endure and try to distract myself. but because of pain and light sensitivity my options are limited.
---
Followed you! (KatTheWolf is me). Hopefully I can catch your streams!!
---
admit what? you're wrong. 
---
Do you have a YouTube channel? Would love to see more of your content :)
---
Its a fucking game, who cares. 
---
Nope im right, 100%.
---
Are you my totem?
---
I can now die in peace 
---
Nah, only on mondays, Wednesday, Fridays, Saturdays and sundays. 
---
Imagine conflict paired with ruin, overcharge and pop goes the weasel, that would be so great, yet so toxic!
---
Same. I mostly play survivor but also killer, and in my 250 hours I’ve seen at most like a handful of toxic dickheads.
---
look, you just started playing. you need to know something. been two years and one still can kill 4 people with 3 minutes if they use Nurse. she didn't get a nerf. been more than a year and Freddy is still getting hurt by his own power more than he benefits from it.
---
it's been almost a month since new chapter release and even more since ptb. after ptb they didn't fix the issues with Legion, maps, lighting and sounds. 
---
one of original first killers got fucked so badly after update he's unplayable. if you look at my posts you'll see the ones about Trapper. this is something that shouldn't even happen after game exists for two years.
---
you don't know how bhvr does. yet I do think most complaints are too much but not the ones about bugs. cause these are ridiculous. and after last chapter they're worse than ever.
---
Both sides have rulebooks. Use what you use as long as you aren’t cheating. It’s that simple.
---
you can use the steam "recent players" options to find him/her!
---
Hag will never be better than nurse/billy/huntress because setting traps wastes an substantial amount of time
---
100 dukes? Who is Duke and why are there so many of him?
---
Hardcore tunnel until you got downed? I don't think you know what tunneling means. 
---
Also tunneling does not mean that the killer is bad, it just sounds like you're salty. 
---

Yes, this was the bestest room for defending my totem.

I know what I said

I only give hatch when someone DC's early on or throws the game.

Watch, you'll close your eyes, go to bed and BAM. It's 2020.
---
Yea all 3 of my friends are trying to join separate games and can’t find one, one of us got a message that said “application expires in 15 minutes”
---
I don't really blame killers for using moris, its just annoying fighting a lot of them. What are they supposed to do? Not use them?
---
I get 4k in 2-3days

 A lot of upvotes for a basic repost.

Bloodlust Tier 18

And why's that?
---
Wow Xyex, how ever did you do that?
---
The Entity pulled a sneaky on the Killer. 
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse + Dead Rabbit add-on
---
Tier 2 No heartbeat is reallly fun to play. They just have absolutely no warningif its in a confined space.
---
The 3 I always use are balanced landing, alert and aftercare. A lot of people trash aftercare and say bond or empathy are better but those people have clearly never used aftercare to it’s full potential, it’s saved my life more often than not. My 4th perk depends on my mood but it’s usually iron will, borrowed time or lightweight
---
In my opinion (and I don't claim to be an exceptionally skilled player), he likes to blame his shortcomings on the design of the game itself. The example I see the community bringing up most often is his killer tierlists. In his most recent one, he ranks the hag very low, and puts leatherface at b tier. Also, in my opinion, he complains way too much
---

Been having the same issue. :(

What is your devotion?
---
Thank you so much!
---
More skill then hitting an invisible survivor as the spirit? It doesn’t take much I chainsaw ppl all the time and if I miss I just try again half a second later
---
Ty brozza, makes sense now
---
Aww! xD I don't sell them, but I do give them away for free on my Twitch stream. RoryDiesALot
---
Iron Will, Bond, Quick &amp; Quiet, and Lightweight. Allows me to be still be sneaky while traversing the map at a decent speed.
---
So if a killer doesn't play according to your made up rules they are not good? Even if they can do consistently well without following your made up rules? 
---
You're really nice. Thank you so much. :3
---
Ooo yus . Lots and lots of gens only for me? 
---
I like the booth, it's very simple but it looks great !
---
It makes sense, but by the time you’re able to play that Killer, both a new one has come out, and you don’t know how to comfortably play them yet.
---
Aftercare the new guys perk ? I’ve been on the other side of it after helping a Jeffit is helpful like bond. How do you use it to its full potential ?
---
Last game I had as Hag and had both of my lit totems next to gens. Thankfully one of them was TOTH but damn it was stressful.
---
Lol yea ok. How many hits does a chainsaw take to down you compared to frenzy?
---
100% all categories for killer 
---
for all the times I've seen that I never realized he was stuck. now the memes make more sense.
---
I love the addition of color they mix so well with the drawing.
---
You can dodge a chainsaw though but you can’t dodge frenzy hits. 
---
It is, because they aren't witch hunting. If the username was visible, then it would be against the rules. 
---
What's stronger, a magic catalyst that allows you to transport across great distances or one flashy boi
---
It probably varies on which one you’re more drawn to. I’ve never been good at trying to chase people in video games so that made my decision really easy. I’d say just play one round of each and see which one you like to play better and go from there. 
---
Its better if they didn't notice you have a tombstone
---
As someone who did this, I can confirm that it was HELLA uncomfortable and felt weird and really just made your nails prone to breaking. So- I shall endorse your effort to get it fixed, simply because now I remember the uncomfortable feeling of it and I am disgruntled. 
---
Depends on the time of the day to be honest. Killer ques were fine at peak times, but not so fine at the ungodly times I play on.
---
That sexy Mori though... 😏
---
Oof
---
Yes but now imagine being in the dream world and seeing Freddy chasing Freddy off in the distance 
---
What is the first offering? I don't recognize it
---
i like my meg with the p3 bloody face, dolphin hoodie with the black skinny jeans looks cool on her imo
---
I'm rank 8 too. No idea how i got there. I'm a survivor main yet I'm rank 12 as a survivor.
---
I don't think k you under what I meant. I got unhooked and the killer kept chasing me along the perimeter of the map till my deep wounded status meter was empty. Even when there were survivors on the way. If that isn't hardcore tunneling, I don't know what is 
---
Yes exactly make perks more viable, give them buffs or rework them all together.
---
* Some are easy to buff like why isn't [Prove Thyself](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Prove_Thyself) given the 15s duration like every other perk similar to it?
---
* [This Is Not Happening](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/This_Is_Not_Happening) could increase your chances of skill checks while injured so you're able to take advantage of the perk better, can also combo with other perks like [No Mither](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/No_Mither) or [Autodidact](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Autodidact).
---
* Why not make [No One Left Behind](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/No_One_Left_Behind) give the bonus points at all times as opposed to having to complete an altruistic action after the gates are powered, it's literally the reason I don't use it, quite a few times I escape without getting the opportunity to perform an altruistic action after the gates are open, just double the bloodpoints the entire match and give the 12% speed boost only after the gates open.
---
* Why does [Lithe](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Lithe) only activate during chases? Remove that restriction and it'll instantly bring the perk inline with [Sprint Burst](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Sprint_Burst)/[Balanced Landing](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Balanced_Landing).
---
* [Left Behind](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Left_Behind): Delete the perk.
---
Sure, mate. Just hit when I am unhooked and when there are no pallets nearby. Awesome chase. You killer mains need to play as survivor and get rekt because tunneling to understand what I actually mean.
---
I don’t think this belongs here.
---
Yeah. I have done that as killer and it feels bad. So many points just like that. It doesn't take any skill at all 😕
---
"Bunch of toxic lil shits, someone's dieing by daylight next round!" Then proceeds to create basement face.
---
I would too tbh
---
I myself am not an expert, but I have been playing this game for over a year and with spending a little under six months chilling at R1 for both Survivor and Killer I can 100% say that he is one of the best people to go to for a fundamental understanding of the game. (Also, I know rank doesn't really mean anything but I am just stating my rank to show where I spend my time playing DBD.) 
---
Also, this whole subreddit is dedicated to shitposts and complaining so I don't understand why people call him a complainer when 90% of the community is full of em. Especially when his complaints are, more often that not, completely sensible. He then proceeds to provide well thought out fixes for them that are favorible for most, if not all, players. But I digress. 
---
He may not be a Killer God like Tru3, or a Survivor God like No0b3, but he is definitly the one who truly understands DBD. 
---
PS: If you watch his tier list video, he explains his reasoning for each Killer's placement and they are very fair points. (At least to me) 
---
Or it could have been the other Claudette running around the map fast vaulting on purpose to get me caught. She could have rigged the gens to look like her.
---
She's my main, love it. You have incredible talent. 
---
I believe it will start if killer is looking at a survivor within 8 meter range. 
---
Ew ebony mori just get kills the legit way
---
Camping
---
A bug. I forget if it is required to email support but it may be as simple as restarting your system
---
Wait wut. Where can I find this
---
Had a game just now where a survivor teabagged me at exit on Wraith before they realized Blood Warden was active
---
This is that feeling
---
Ahh, thank you.
---
And it is the killer's fault how exactly? It's the survivors' fault that there are no effective loops nearby. Also I would blame that on the other survivor unhooking while the killer is closeby. 
---
Firstly I'm not a killer main, but you seem to be a salty survivor main, or just a salty person in general. The fact that your argument is reliant on me being a killer main and being a trash survivor shows how invalid your point is. 
---
So my comment was stupid, simply because I state facts? Righto salty person.

I feel this picture 
---
I barely show mercy. People DC and I spare the last person, I don't mind camping or tunneling. Survivors hate me lmao but the only good thing I DO though is tunnel and facecamp the traitor.
---
I already mentioned that there are survivor near me. He saw them. But he still wanted me because he had a Mori. He must have been a noob killer who can't play without tunneling and mori. I can understand his frustration though.
---
Is that chair 399?
---
Muh small indie company 
---
Same dude
---
Haha. So, it's my fault that some random survivor unhooked me when killer was near me and also when there were no pallets. Please join my killer lobby. I'll teach you how annoying  tunneling is, baby killer

I just did what’s your username

I think this will be one of the first things that changes with dedicated servers. Right now, it's a 50/50 chance if survivors actually get any BP, safety pip and keep their item. The mechanic doesn't always work, maybe it depends on if the killer chooses 'leave game' or just pulls the plug? Either way dedicated servers should make it consistent. Also crossing my fingers for getting our offerings back in the event of a DC.

Happy cake day!

I played it the first time without music and knew exactly what song was used
---
For real... This was all I could think about at work. 
---
Not too great. Will save maybe a few seconds of cool down and is a lot worse since exhaustion perk nerf
---
I would love to get Mike as a survivor. But let's be honest, they'd just butcher his face like they did to Quentin, since they only get the licence to a character and not the actor's face.
---
Welp... I just let the mods sort it out ;) 
---
Bill, he's licensed so no other cosmetics will be available. Plus he's all green, and with p3 he can hide even better.
---
She eventually wentAFK got 3 crows on her and as soon as she was hit down she DC’d
---
And how can you prove that he saw your teammates? Stop dismissing everything to try and push your point forward. 
---
Mori killers aren't noobs as you say. There are people who can consistently do well as a killer but sometimes use a mori because they find it fun and it is a welcome change if they are grinding or playing a lot. 
---
Noed users aren't noobs either, I personally don't use noed, although it still doesn't take the skill away from the user. Just because you don't agree with someone's perk choices in game does not make them a noob. 
---
What's next? You call all ds users noobs? Or are you just salty at killers for being better than you?

I am also done replying to you since you are getting worse with every reply.

Try hitting someone in a Jungle gym on in T-Walls with the chainsaw.
---
If that doesn't require skill I don't know what does.

You don't know to see if the killer saw your teammates or not? Are you that dumb or blind? Holy shit. Are you trying to tell me what I saw? Damn. This is funny 
---
In the clip, I could only pop tier 3 when they finished 5 whole generators, which is usually the case if not reaching tier 3 at all. Judith's tombstone makes it difficult to reach tier 3 for a reason, and Judith's tombstone also makes you slower. The tombstone piece would grant you 2 kills at most, and you'd have to be strategic on who to stalk and who to kill if you want more than 2 kills, which is very challenging considering you have to find who you haven't stalked at all and go around the map for them and waste time. All of what I mentioned are challenges when running a tombstone build. Justifying that you would sometimes accidentally down survivors by saying "tombsone OP" isn't a great argument. Tombstones can be punished because they aren't the best in the game. there are many other builds that top tombstone myers. I wouldn't think they would want you downing people if they gave you the ability to kill them in the spot.
---
There's a lot of things they should do, but they won't.
---
Yeah I've been wondering if this is normal, love doing this on trapper especially its like being in the intro video
---
As a rank 1 solo survivor, there isn't even an obsession 2/3 games.
---
I almost got the achievement, last girl tried to hide in a locker, I struggled her far from a locker into a corner where when I dropped her, I would body block her into the corner, then proceeded to go mori, only for the Kate to d/c and lose the achievement... I killed all 3 of them before and only one gen was finished and in the end game chat, one of the survivors has the nerve to say “gg ez baby killer” as if I didn’t murder (basically) every single one of them. Salty survivors smh
---
This post will most likely be disposed of, so instead of publicly shaming them, zoom in on the name and note it down, so you can in an email to bhvr's support in addition to the video.
---
Yes.  When Legion hits you with power while you are injured, you start as if you already had taken one hit from Legion in Deep Wounds state.
---
This is why I always run Lightborn whenever I can.
---
That’s because killers are nowdays so ez to play so you dont need any skill to get a 4k. Im a rank 1 surv main who bullys killers all game or gets bullied by killers all game and when there was 2x bp I played mostly killer and got every single game 4k and with 1 week i got to rank 4, and this truly made me understand that mathieu is a killer main and that’s why he buffs only killers and nerfs survivors
---
Well at least you got a choice to not play it anymore 
---
I think that they are bout 50% of games you see them if I am reasonable. I will say that you don't notice the obsession nearly as much if you aren't playing killer though so the perception is kind of skewed to which team you are playing on.

---
I imagine the problem is that should legion have no cooldown it would take very little skill to play him and it would be really annoying to play against
---
Personally I've found red ranks much better. Teammates aren't potatoes and killers seem far less likely to circle the hook waiting for the tunnel.
---
Only thing that gets old is seeing 10,000 billys with their broken chainsaws.
---
I did get bodyblocked last night though for 20 mins. Never had that before. (I did report it) So maybe when you do see a toxic person they're much worse.
---
I've also seen killers commit hard to hatch standoffs. Not gonna blame them but at green ranks they give up easily. At red ranks man they're in it for a long haul. You can watch youtube on your phone and they never get bored. Just gotta jump and hope they're distracted too.
---
I agree
---
I've seen it too. Guessing its working much of the time for them otherwise they wouldn't be doing it. These are the only characters who run and crouch next to a wall hoping to blend in.
---
Haha. I am toxic because I don't want to be tunneled? Damn, son. You are totally insane. 
---
I like Feng but man do I hate THOSE Fengs. So toxic. D-strike guarenteed.
---
Haha. It's so funny how you guys get riled up when I state facts. It's fine. I am done replying to your bullshit too. 
---
And this is why it needs to go.
---
You outplay someone and get them down, then you have to decide how you're getting punished for it. Take a stun and have them escape? Or leave them slugged and lose the hook?
---
Awful design.
---
This has happened a lot with me in the three days I've owned the game. It usually only happens after a killer disconnects - EX. I join a lobby and the killer leaves because it's taking too long, or the killer leaves after a game is won before I have the chance to leave.
---
If it's the same case with you, then I usually just swap to killer, play a round with them, then back to survivor. If it's not, I don't really have any advice. My experience with that bug is very specific to my circumstances ^^;
---
Well see for yourself by checking this website: https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/
---
It’s super informative and up-to-date
---
I actually caught fun footage of some hatch standoffs while I spectated the last fellas in some matches. Those killers really are passionate about that hatch lol.
---
I don’t get why survivors don’t just remain hidden and go finish gens? Gives you more of a chance than hatch standoff, since killer might come check it out, or might stay at hatch.
---
Survivors just need a BP gain bump so it doesn't feel like I need to either farm hooks with a do-nothing perk(WGLF) or play like 6+ games for 1 web.
---
For one make WGLF doing something so you aren't handicapping yourself down to 3 perks if you wanna double BPs. My personal thing is give it the Borrowed Time affect but for you instead of the person you're protecting, make it very minimal amount, like say have it last 5/10/15 seconds before going away from an unhook, doesn't apply if you just take a hit for someone.
---
Survival: Give the survivor a consolation amount of survival points in a lost match for living longer than others; 1st dead 0 points, 2nd dead 500 points, 3rd dead 1000 points, last survivor 1500 points. Have No Mither give 25%/50%/75% bonus BP in the category. Meaning if you escape, you're guaranteed 8k in the category. Have the chase escape bonus of 200 points be survival instead of boldness.
---
Objective: Have each generator completed give all currently living survivors objective BP (similar to how event generators worked for the new year/summer event) I suggest 500 BP or so. Meaning if you were the one distracting and looping the killer all game you at least get 2500 objective points, it doesn't undermine the others who did do the work, but you don't lose out on an entire category of points simply because the killer tunneled you.
---
Boldness: for the most part it is fine, but maybe just up the amount you get for stealthing around the killer. the random drips of +6 boldness you get every now and then seem rather insignificant. Have Object of Obsession give 10%/20%/30% more BP in the category, while the perk has it's niche/meme uses, this will give some more actual reward to basically letting the killer know where you are almost all the time
---
Altruism: This is really the only category that seems fine, you get ample points for hook saves, protection, distracting, helping people outside of a grasp and just regular healing. Maybe give a perk a bonus % like I suggested with No Mither and OoO, just not sure which perk associated with altruism needs the extra oomph or reason to run it.
---
Playing survivor won't seem like so much of a grind if even in a good match you're only walking away with like 16-18k BP whereas a bad killer match gets you just as much.
---
I was literally shouting at my tv the second time. Haha. 
---
Nice try Nigerian prince keylogger
---
We all know you want the big one bro, no need to keep that up :)
---
Yes just rarity. Every killer and survivor had a red/pink, purple and green perk (fully maxed) on release (fee exceptions were Meg with Sprintburst and Adrenaline). Otherwise, selfcare, sabo, streetwise, those were the perks back then :)
---
It is still very much in the meta but it got some indirect nerfs in the new chapter.  The aura detection is blocked by people being in lockers so pretty easy to counter by hopping in a locker when you see a killer carrying someone. Jeff also has the distortion perk which hard counters the first 3 activations of it. Basically, it is still good, still run on most builds but less powerful than it used to be.
---
Maybe the killer should grab them and bash/stab them a couple of times
---
&gt;can literally be prevented from activating with little effort
---
&gt;OP
---
What did you mean by this?
---
I prefer leg quarters at the barbecue
---
I did think about that, but surely they’d still give us the *chance* to communicate even a little bit?
---
Survivor of course, you can barely get scared as the killer
---
I think it depends on when someone camps, I've had killers camp right away with Ruin and that was terrible, but if we have the exit gates open and obviously camping the only person they could finally down is the only way they're going to get any kind of points, I can't really fault them...
---
I can immediately tell when facing a SWF because gens pop like crazy but I can't find a single survivor. Its disgusting how they call your movements over to their teammates
---
Well I mean, I get at least 25 to 30k per Survivor match and about 50 to 60k per Killer match. I think it just comes down to what you do durring a trial. 
---
As Survivor, if all you are doing is gens, you're are going to get very little bloodpoints. But, if you do what I do, and complete 1 gen, break a totem or two, and unhook and heal at least 3 times you're gonna get a good amount of points, even without surviving the trial. 
---
As Killer, it's a little more difficult, but not by much. I usually go for Trapper or Doctor for points. With Trapper, I have on Padded Jaws which doubles the points I get from catching a Survivor at the expense of the Survivor not lossing a health state, but that "negative" is also a point bonus as it alows you to smack that person twice instead of only once. As Doctor, I use his terror radius increasing add-on (the name of it escapses me atm) and just stay in Treatment Mode most of the match and make the game last for 20 minutes. This alows me to perform several hits on each Survivor AND at 2 to three hooks per Survivor. 
---
In the end, it all about making the trials last longer than 8 to 10 minutes.
---
Had this happen once on the Myers map. The leather face just patrolled the area of his totem and only went at people who got close to it. In the end game chat he was all kinds of salty because we “gen rushed” I mean what are we supposed to do ?Not do the gens?
---
not much
---
Lithe, dance with me, quick and quiet and adrenaline. I love vaulting things so it’s a perfect build for me. 
---
I mean, you could also add everyone in the lobby to a group. I've had people try that before, but I just ignored em.
---
Yeah  I don't see why she'd leave someone she caught after the gates are open. A nice killer isn't doing his job anyway lol. It doesn't sound like she complained either. She just defended herself. I'd say the same thing. Gates open? You come back? You know the risks  xD
---
yeah I'm a little surprised they keyed it all to the same button, because a lot of people like to use self-heal in the middle of the pallet in case they need to run on PC...
---
Oh I see now, you're just an extremely salty survivor main. You complain about everything that gives the killer an advantage in any way but refuse to accept facts and instead will say that your opinion is fact, when it is not. 
---
I didn't realise you were the same salty person who was saying that killers who use moris and noed are noobs. Figured it was someone else due to how bad your english was in that thread. 
---
You only get angry at killers and don't look at both sides objectively. Maybe get better at the game instead of complaining on reddit about killers all the time. 
---
You should have played years agowwww
---
That's gonna be a "no" from me dawg.
---
I don't really think there's a better way for them to have done it. If they made the one getting chased all game pip and the others not then it would be even less fair than it is now because it's not the other survivors fault that they're stuck gen jockeying all game while another guy loops the killer.  It's already really easy to pip even if you are the guy looping all game so I don't think there's a more fair way for them to have done it without boosting more survivors to rank 1 than already have been.
---
What does BHVR mean?
---
I'd only use it to call people cunts post game so probably better it's not a feature
---
I dunno, when I'm walking along minding my own business and a p3 Claudette I didn't see pallet stuns me I jump. 
---
Lotta cool ideas! They probably can't get Jason because they said they weren't doing anymore licensed killers supposedly, so they could do someone like him but not him exactly, which is a shame (they have him in that other game of course, and I heard that one ran into a lot of trouble and can't update). I like the vision blocking idea especially!
---
Then you dribble because it's the only counterplay (and even that is useless unless there is a hook really close to you) and they cry you're  exploiting the game lol.
---
It’s going to be hell for those killers though once they implement the change 
---
I haven’t tried that before but I feel like it would take a fair amount of effort, as well as time depending on whether or not it lets you select their usernames or if you have to type them manually. I might as well utilise it since there probably won’t be any chat functions added to console, but... I can dream...
---
When Im sneaking up on a survivor and he trips a trap I forgot about and it screams I jump
---
I don’t get it 
---
It’s small enough that often you’ll get close enough to get hits before they can reach pallets but you won’t be able to get gen grabs with it. Unless they have sprint burst in which case you get the pig treatment.
---
Yeah I don’t understand how when I am that last survivor the hatch only happens to be the last place I look but as kill they always know where it is. I feel like it’s a conspiracy.
---
A lot of people like the grind. If there wasn’t a grind you’d have nothing to aim for aside from playing the same rounds over and over.
---
A friend and I both got sloppy on us (it won’t stop bleeding no matter what) stood side by side and both of our games crashed at the exact same time 
---
Gen auras now match Survivor auras, allowing Survivors to hide behind them.
---
Hiding in lockers prevents Killers from seeing your aura.
---
Distortion blocks the first 3 times a Killer will see your aura.
---
Yeah lets make NOED even stronger. That's a great idea.
---
Last I heard they broke up because Scott cheated on Zubat with McLean. 
---
She had done it with the first person down though as well, when we only had two gens done. It would make sense if it was her only down and kill, but she had gotten another one early game where she did the same thing. While I was opening the exit gate on the other side of the map, she had downed and hooked another survivor, where I assume the same thing happened. 
---
He was downed, and since the other survivor was still on the hook, I was hoping to get away with a quick save. Instead, he was insta hit and I was immediately downed. I think it was because of Rancor since I was the obsession.
---
Point is though, it's not like she wouldn't have gotten any points, and she didn't make any real effort to check gens. She just stayed by a hooked survivor most of the game, which I think is what bugged me the most.
---
We don't know it isn't intended. They could hide perks but have chosen not to. When SWF came out, the game changed. 
---
Consider it a punishment for tunneling. Kill one person early, the rest have loads of time to counter your perks.
---
Wait a killer can damage a finished generator?
---
What??? It is obviously not intended... There's a reason the devs don't add voice chat... Holy shit... You're daft...
---
Hex: Haunted Grounds.
---
I pulled a sneaky on you
---
You remember that scene when Michael stalks Laurie behind the bushes in the original; I only played Michael once and decided to hide behind a bush and stalk Ace and David King.
---
Let’s just say that it would have been an easy 4K had I not felt so bad for the other survivors. 
---
NOPE STOP IT STOP ITTTT THIS IS TOO SEXY FOR ME
---
If not for the Black Ward I'd understand. Force quitting the game saves the Killer's add-ons. But if they already had a Black Ward, kinda pointless.
---
I'm a paramedic and know stuff...
---
excuse me what the fuck
---
I usually can shake off Legion playing as Claudette with Iron Will + Lithe, but thats literally the only counterplay to him I can think of
---
Whenever I end up at Haddonfield as Myers, I try to hook people in the front yard of a house and then go to a house across the street with a front facing window and just stare at them as they get saved. I hope they see me sometimes and think it’s spoopy.
---
WHY IS HE SO SQUISHED
---
Congratulations buddy, Rank 1 is tough to achieve and tough to play in, GL! 
---
See. I like this. It would make it even more fun to play killer to hear the survivors scream. 
---
Praise the entity 
---
That’s weird, I think Ormund is a good balance of killer/survivor friendly. I have a good time there. Killer main btw
---
I believe you get more BP if you can 4k in 5 min and get ~18k BP pre-bonuses compared to a fair and long 15 min game for ~27k BP pre-bonuses. 
---
The trees speak vietnamese
---
I imagine that fella doesn't just tickle people with his power.
---
Are you new here? This sub beats the same meme formats to death all the time.
---
&gt; I'm done talking about this
---
Doesn't seem like it
---
&gt; "The devs don't have to add voice chat because of discord and Skype!!!" Yeah, because every survivor is a swf group,
---
Most casuals don't want voice chat. It's the same as every other game. Maybe 1 out of 20 games of Fortnite you'll find someone speaking even though the advantage of doing so is huge. 
---
&gt; defended tunneling, camping as leatherface,
---
I tunnel like hell. Why wouldn't I? It's the best strategy. I don't really play Leatherface much anymore but Insidious chainsaw doubles were fun as hell.
---
&gt; and then complained about killer being strong like three times,
---
A lot more than 3 times. Killers have it easy. I'm not going to lie about that just because I play killer the majority of the time. It's up to the devs to balance it, not me.
---
Her learning curve has nothing to do with whether she's overpowered or not.
---
Nonetheless I prefer her over Spirit. Looping against spirit just feels like a coinflip. 
---
Would be a helpful change.
---
I HATE BEING RANK ONE THIS FUCKING SUCKS I CAN'T TRY OUT ANY OTHER KILLERS WITHOUT BEING DEMOLISHED AND I ODNT WANT TO DELIBERATELY DERANK TO A RANK WHERE EVERY SURVIVOR ISNT A **CLICKY FLASHLIGHT CUNT**
---
Love all these comments. 
---
You can that totem wherever you want in your trial. But it’s gonna live there in there in our world, right next to that gen :)
---
Dude, do you play at rank 15 or something? Billy and Spirit are the most used killers at R1 (or just red ranks in general). 
---
which rarely happens
---
I started using Premonition today because with Keen Senses (the cat perk or whatever), I can’t ever tell where the Killer is looking at me from. It’s a nice perk, if only it stayed active for more than a damn second when I scan my screen and accidentally swing past the Killer in my field of view.
---
I'd take NOED.
---
At least it ruins the end of the game, plus you dint immediately get hit. If killer isnt near you then yiu can hide.
---
With DS its the fact that the tbagging little toxic shit gets a free escape and theres nothing you can do about it. Plus it ruins the game from start to finish.
---
Ooooh the dream. A gen rushing team when the killer facecamps, we need more of thissss. She won't improve if she keeps that up. Baby killer or a killer with a burning hate for survivors xD
---
They can't, the game is now balanced around them.
---
Id love to see how the escaoe rate changed if just one of these was removed.
---
Didn't know you spoke for the entire casual dbd community. And tunneling being the best strategy holy shit. Yeah, why injure as many people as possible when ever I can just get one guy? What killer do you play bro? Only killers that are easy are the top tiers. Do you play against competent survivors? And don't say, "yeah, I was rank 1" because ranks mean jack shit. I was 4k'ing all day as a rank 1 Freddy because baby survivors don't know how to counter stbfl. They were shit but we're still rank 1 because crutch perks and swf basically the game for you.
---
I do wonder if voice chat is planned with dedicated servers
---
Great to hear man! :D
---
Iz there a place where i can see more of your artwrk. Like do you upload it somewhere or is twitch all u got? Loved it btw
---
When you think it misses but on the killers’ screen it’s actually right on you.
---
The Gen didn't even complete, I don't know why but it didn't complete.
---
Lol yeah
---
very dead
---
they don't see what exactly survivors have though. it can be a simple brown medkit with brown add-ons or a darn instaheal. or just some box they forgot to take off after previous match. as killer or survivor I've never had a problem with survivors having items or killer seeing what I bring to the match.
---
it might be a flashlight and might be a reason to change build sometimes but eh. I've never really encountered someone equipping Frankie's when I had flashies. cause Frankie's isn't that much of a game changer so I dunno, mate, that doesn't seem like something worth mentioned. 
---
In my experience, I get more points chasing everyone a little bit longer than just downing someone that was just unhooked and putting them back on the hook. Not always a goot strat to get 4k, but you definitely get more bp out of it.
---
If anything dribbling wastes more time. Dribbling him isn't going to get rid of his ds, so unless you have a mori, eating the ds is just better
---
Scratched Myers in a Nutshell
---
Whoops! fixed it. Half asleep, my bad!
---
Oh ok, I was amazed for a second
---
BBQ BBC it's all good fam
---
But yeah it's still meta. It's so common devs tell you to just assume the killers are running BBQ&amp;Chili. It has gotten nerfed lately, with survivors being able to hide in lockers to avoid aura reading and the new Jeff perk, but it's still strong AND gives a ton of blood points.
---
I would be more impressed if you were a console rank 1 nurse. God, what is that FPS while blinking awfull
---
Oh lord, I have zero interest in even touching Nurse, both for the frame rate and the fact that she's plain unfair. She's one of the only killers I've not levelled at all. 
---
Isn’t no father
---
Nyooms into the basement
---
Not for ps4. I swear I can never join a lobby. I waited 30 mins and still no lobby.
---
use DS and teabag at door.
---
"garbage"
---
:'''D might aswell delete survivor perks so every shitty killer doesnt need reddit to cry?
---
The ones who did the gens should pip because they avoided the killer. The one who looped the killer the whole time should pip for keeping the chase going for so long
---
Never happens and then she wasted a pallet
---
I think she's queerbait for Nea. 💅🏻
---
It isn’t really dominated by either side. There are plenty of both. I mentioned the extreme survivor mains, not the general populace.
---
As for not being able to see the perks, it is good to curb the behavioir of the worst players. Yes not every survivor group will do it, but you program to protect from those who act poorly, not those who are cooperative.
---
Yup, I run Premonition as well, I really like it. Helps me know in which direction I need to go to "hide" instead of trying to guess.
---
Tunneling is such a stupid complaint.
---
You are meant to kill the survivors!
---
It's much the same isn't it? He has serious drawbacks so on most maps, especially like corn, the survivors can basically just run in a straight line and not worry. On maps like Lery's with massive line of sight blocks everywhere, he feels unfair because often your first warning of him being near is him hitting you. It's also got corners so escaping him means he can perfectly watch where you go and cut corners.
---
So he's incredibly map dependant and is either an easy win or an easy loss.
---
Seems legit 😁
---
He is yeah, i was just curious
---
Ace, definitely 
---
Bloody party streamers. +100% BP for everyone
---
The only thing I can see being problematic, is not everyone runs SWF.. I’m sure a large portion of survivors run solo (could be wrong) and don’t wait around to see the final result of the trial. I run solo and  I’m always curious as to what build the killer was running, making me wait until everyone dies/escape is just punishing solo players. 
---
I do agree with your concept, maybe if there was a way for BHVR to strictly apply that to just SWF lobbies, I could see that brining some balance 
---
not sure about BBQ though. personally don't care since have all dlcs and teachables but heard it hasn't been in the Shrine for a year or so. that's a very weird coincidence. 
---
also, there's no chance to tell if one Obsession perk has higher chance to get Obsession. I've met several groups where my Obsession would be a person with *just* Object of Obsession while their buddy having ds and ooo, wouldn't be one. weird. like I caught that ooo Claudette, thought she has ds since I don't run Obsession perks, she started to wiggle at once so I assumed there's no ds in game. 
---
long story short I got hit by two ds's from non-obsessions in this match. 
---
Hahahaha improving Killer Gameplay ?!? What do you think the devs are competent in  decision-making  or balance ?
---
HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA ! 
---
Nah man 10€ Skins are the real DEAL ! 
---
The Man of the Hour, Dwight.
---
I don’t care about the shrine either btw, just trying to make a comparison. And obsession perks don’t stack, I know that
---
So you mean the entire Subreddit then ? Because all i encounter on her are the most toxic suvivors mains ever -.-,
---
That such a small little adjustment that actually allows for a higher skill ceiling, it's actually a great suggestion.
---
had a similar thing where the guy was called basement protector. The bubba down there would carry us back out each time we entered and shake his head violently before descending back down the stairs slowly 
---
not really. you clearly see sometimes someone with ooo and ds on 3 loses Obsession to someone with single green ds.
---
lol "simple mind answer" so please tell me the main objective of the "Killer"?
---
Hnnng
---
no you can't, thats why it should take longer to do gens.  2 Gens can be finished before you get your first hook and you waste too much time leaving the chase to go and find and then chase someone else.
---
Oh jesus. Your brother must be great. I get a lot of hate messages but nobody has tried adding me to a party before. 
---
&gt; It isn’t really dominated by either side. 
---
u/KuuPhone has a point. This sub is really dominated by killer mains, you can see that from any post that defends survivor crutches etc. it'll get down-voted with ease. Yet a picture of an Ataxic + Catatonic Nurse with Ebony Mori and Ruin will just get the "GG and they even had a DS user!" or something, it's silly.
---
&gt; I mentioned the extreme survivor mains, not the general populace.
---
Care to elaborate on this? What is an extreme survivor main to you?
---
Most aren’t that extreme. To be against tunneling ellijg and mad about getting facecamped is a fairly moderate position really.
---
I'd just love to be able to see the killers Steam name and check their profile before the game like they can do with me. You don't have to see the killer, just put it in the corner or something.
---
I'll keep it simple as to why it's a crap idea.
---
You can't fall into a double pip. Bad Ayers don't get them, and you can't accidentally do things that get you a double pip. In fact, generally speaking, in the current system you have to go out of your way to do things seemingly against your best interests in order to do so.
---
Depipping is not the same case and if there was a double depip, those games where you get completely screwed over, through no fault of your own, would be the ones you double depip in.
---
It would be a great way to make getting fucked over by the game and strangers that much more upsetting.
---
The kind that would say that using discord to talk to the other survivors doesn’t unbalance the game in favour of survivors.
---
His argument is invalid because Small Game is a garbage perk and isn’t even consistent to begin with? 
---
Hes only been playing about two weeks, and hes doing remarkably well! 
---
I have had migraines while playing this game after the update, you aren't the only one! 
---
if they ditched a lobby cause someone had a key, why do you even care? you'll find another one within 30 seconds- a minute.
---
if they dc on loading screen because someone had bps, that's bit insane but has nothing to do with items. maybe just a weird person. to counter your statement though, playing survivor not even once I saw people dcing on a loading screen seeing a secret killer offering and assuming Mori. 
---
besides, the game does crash quiet a lot. and gets stuck at infinite loading screen. many people don't disconnect, they just never load in.
---
New Hag buff: Is now 300 ft tall
---
Tbh, this advice is good against randoms as well. 
---
I play Huntress on console too, but I have mouse for PS4
---
All that guy needed to do was walk 3 steps to either side instead of instantly and directly towards the hook.
---
Miky Myers
---
Nop, dribblig is better. You can get DS and then their might be a vault location or even worse, a loopable pallet. In no world eating a DS is faster than just dribbling someone to a hook
---
(T_T do you equip Enduring or just cut your play time severely?
---
Pls post links. I did p1 on my feng fir nothing :(
---
I just cut my play time and play other games instead until BHVR fixes their shit 
---
Ever play halo 2? Proximity chat is great in theory but almost always is just some kid screaming slurs or blasting their garbage music, I'll pass there's enough toxic behavior as is.
---
did u only play legion or how were u able to get him to p3 lvl50 when ur only player level 40
---
Well, the Doc can’t kill ppl with his power 
---
😶
---
Yea true but to remove they could add like a little speaker thing by their name and if you press on it it would mute them
---
&gt;NOED  literally wastes a perk slot all game and is only active long enough to affect one guy tops
---
It's enough to make me consider when playing solo if it is worth risking my ass trying to rescue someone off a hook. With SWF it becomes a spoken agreement to save your own ass if the killer has it and someone goes down (we're competitive at trying to get each other killed in ridiculous ways sometimes for lulz). 
---
The biggest problem I have with it is it truly does affect one guy tops. which makes it a bit of a camper/tunnel perk no? One big fuck you to an unlucky someone before the game ends.
---
Quick he is facecamping let’s all look at it happen and not do gens 
---
Not really, were just see alot more disconnects during the game.
---
Hey, if the survivors get any kind of advantage might as well just ruin the game for everybody, am I right!?  /s
---
Because the killer is the nurse and she will be coming to me right off the bat when the last gen done but when I am in the locker I just noticed that the gen is bugged out with fear and confuse I will just wait in that locker.
---
Prob a lot more bans as well at least on pc anyway 
---
There are fair arguments for both. Empathy’s main advantage is the range it has. Because of that you can basically tell where the killer is at any point in the game. Bond has more utility to be able to tell what people are doing in general, but the limited range means you need to be sort of grouped up. Most killers benefit more from killers being grouped than far apart.
---
I mean it all depend on your playstyle. If you run a lot of healing perks Empathy, if you like getting chased use bond and if you are a stealth player use Aftercare. It all comes down to what you prefer the most. I play stealthy and I use WGLF (cause I am a cunt) so aftercare is really good for my playstyle
---
I mean you couldn't even hear her terror radius
---
Hopefully console will get the same system by the time Dedicated servers come in
---
Oh man, gotta build myself a gaming desk like this in the future 
---
Didn't realise there was gonna be sound, thanks for the heart attack! 
---
Possibly something tells me it won’t sadly 
---
Yes, I just don't know what to do and hopefully the gen just delayed a litlebit I guess?
---
I did say it *weights* towards them. It might not be as purely linear as this, but if, in your example, the former has twice the odds of the latter, then the latter still has a 33% chance of being obsession.
---
IF ALL PLAYERS ARE DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND NO ONE IS AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU I REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GET UP LIKE, YEAH I GET IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE REGULAR GAME WHERE YOU REALLY SHOULD BE BEING HELPED UP RATHER THAN DOING IT YOURSELF. BUT GIVEN THAT ITS THAT RARE THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET BACK UP AFTER BEING PUT ON THE GROUND I REALLY THINK THE DEVS SHOULD LET US HAVE THIS ONE, AT LEAST ONCE PER GAME
---
Looks like you were using self care instead of throwing the pallet. Even so, you're leaving it way to late and would have most likely got hit through the pallet anyways
---
But how would all the toxic players cope then without their free escape?
---
How do you expect them to have fun when their actions suddenly have consequences?
---
This doesn't make any sense.
---
People who are new or die often could see that as a form of progress. Any indicator that you're doing something right is good when you're a beginner ! :)
---
Just no, if the devs made this change in the first place because of how much of a pain exhaustion perks were duing a chase why would they want to re introduce it?
---
The definition of the word vigil means: a period of keeping awake during the time usually spent asleep, especially to keep watch or pray.
---
By that meaning why not change vigil into a perk where you can see the killers aura within 4/8/12 meters when iinjured.
---
Just a thought
---
They dc’d on hook/hatchet hits, and that’s my own handmade build(no tier 3s cause prestige) 
---
Ah i love your art! You did the tattoos too right? Your art style is awesome :3
---
It is very easy to rank up yes.
---
If I remember right, you did have to have the dlc to play on the dlc specific maps at one point in time.
---
Cool!!!
---
oh ok, makes a Bit more sense now.
---
But why would you use Beast of Prey and M&amp;A on Huntress?
---
Im blue, da ba dee

Mid Match I’ll explain in a bit

I’ve lost a pip every time this happens. I can deal with losing my offering, which still sucks...but a pip too? It frustrates the hell out of me. At least let me safety pip!
---
And that’s how it should be, plus bnp is really good if you can hit it
---
Only that you cant if you are used to regular flashlights. If you get used to the odd bulbyou wont hit regular flashlights
---
The Kate makes this screenshot even better, upvoted
---
Have another reply to downvote, sad idiots.
---
Cheers
---
Rank 1 plays
---
I’m talking about brand new parts, odd bulbs are shit because it drains faster
---
Not if you have ruin that stays alive for more than 2 minutes.
---
There is an issue that if BHVR starts "punishing" SWF lobbies with more restrictions like that they will simply play SWF without using the swf lobby, you just queue up together and most likely you're going to end up on the same lobby (assuming you're close to him but even then there are some ways to circumvent it).
---
Does it punish solo? Yeah, but the game already punishes solo players, its infinitely harder to play solo, even 2 man swf is just so stupidly different its not even the same game if you start with 3/4 man swf.
---
https://youtu.be/1grTFonnAak
---
But thats actually pretty dope :D
---
Same, I wanted to see Nea grind piggys face.
---
Light weight isn’t really worth it. You are better off getting quick and quiet or dance with me if you are looking for the ability to move quickly without giving yourself away. As for empathy, it is a generally good perk, worth using if you value what your allies are doing. Unless you plan to bring a med kit or change s perk to be able to cooperate though, knowing where they are isn’t that useful.
---
Dead link
---
Third seal is a bad perk and you should never use it outside gimmick builds. MYC is much better to support hag's immense hook pressure and if you feel living on the edge, just use Devour hope. Both of these are much better for hag. And stridor??? Why would you ever run a perk that can be substituted by decent headphones? Just put on a ruin so you have time to put down traps
---
Ranking up in this game is very easy on both sides
---
“But that’ll be our little secret”
---
Wait double BP is over? 
---
Oh god no lol, let’s act like that doesn’t exist ❤️
---
Blood warden vs swf is kind of useless... its just too easy to play around if you know its coming. It only works cause its a surprise effect.
---
Brand new part is shit. Hitting it is ez but you domt get anything out of it unless everyone has one. The 1/4 of a gen and when a killer notices you its all wasted. The less rare addons are just better. Now Im not saying the bnp is completely useless, but its not worth being ultra rare
---
Sounds like mother-in-law of the year to me ;)
---
I myself grew up with parents who did not worry about anything I did with my computer hehe
---
Gotta love to enter lockers
---
It’s the best toolbox add on so I guess it’s worth it, also if a killer is running a 3 gen it can help
---
I always do it, even if he forces me to wiggle I have enough time to run to another locker
---
No boldness or altruism points, survival is capped at 5k. It's a massive waste of time really.
---
How do I upvote more than 1 time
---
It is ultra rare but that doesnt make it usefull. Before the buff bitter murmur was also shitty and purple. The thing is: the addon used to be valuable but today its just not worth spending 7k bloodpoints
---
sure xD
---
The thing is, it never does. You're lucky if it last for more than 30 seconds
---
Link me because I've never heard of this being the case.
---
Did they remove the Christmas lobby yet or are we going to end up keeping it until like April?
---
This hit way too close to home
---
Keep in mind, the killer sees you where you were .1 sec ago, not where you are in your screen and if the killer hits you in his screen, you get hit. This goes to any p2p game. So as a rule of thumb, play like you were a metre closer to the killer than you are.
---
Spirit can traverse the map as well as hillbilly but with much more mobility but less range and the legion has no counterplay. You can’t loop him and you can’t hide from him. 
---
Me too. I figured it was like most games, I mean, young kids (my brother included) play south park games lol. I cant really control what he does, especially when it's my mom that buys them for him. 
---
As a killer main, I don't tunnel much, I feel like it's a dick move. I will rehook a survivor right after they got free from the hook if I can't find the teamm8 that resqued them, but I will not do this if they are on their last hook, then I will just leave them on the ground and use them as bait
---
Let him wiggle free... i guess
---
This feels so good to watch. Ever since last week I’ve hated Claudette with an extreme passion
---
I know this was posted a month ago, but I'm only just now discovering he even has a following and after falling down a rabbit hole of 'Noob is Toxic', and watching a few videos, I figured maybe I should pipe up. 
---
No lie, I used to play with this dude, in discord and all, back when he was a little baby player and maining Nurse as killer - back when he was trash and a goddamn Laurie main. He only became a Nea main later after someone gave him their save so he could get legacy gear back when the accidental save file wipes were a thing (It was a bug that I think has since been fixed, but three of the people who played most in my discord all got hit with it, including myself. No0b3 never mentioned he got hit.)  
---
I don't want to give away my Steam name or my discord server, and I don't think he'd remember me, or the group we played with but I can tell you this: Noob learned to juke from the people in my server. We used to do KYF on Lan, when you could fudge shit and play on Lan Africa or something in Steam settings and still get blood points, and Noob tried Nurse there a few times. He was so garbage he got memed on immediately. No flash lights, just 360s in the cornfield ad infinitum until we got bored.   
---
I watched a FAQ video he put out and he's made some lies and omissions I find sketch. Boy deadass mained Laurie, not Nea, and was determined AF to master Nurse but now nurse is toxic. Funny how he doesn't mention Laurie though.  Boy, be honest about your past, fuck.   
---
At any rate, Noob learned his shit from the people in my server, back at the end of 2016, into 2017, when the exploit shit was going on and people could Lan party and people were randomly losing their profiles. He was a different pleb back then. He was a pleb then and he's a pleb now.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Literally OP, when Claudette gets trapped killer gets blinded :D

I’ll give you your upvote before you get downvoted into oblivion friend

Thats some new killer buffs?
---
My life for the Ruin! *Hex: Haunted grounds appears*
---
first off take off self care that is the biggest waste of time and not very helpful to your teammates
---
When you try a window juke but killer knows
---
Just like a console nurse. 
---
He DOES 
---
I love it! it's amazing
---
r/killertears
---
The main problem is a Max of 2 perks can appear and Max of 1 can be bought. Increasing those numbers by 1 each would he very helpful. 
---
"Bills here" .Wrong game though.
---
Excuse me? Killer sided? Do you even play this game?
---
Don’t try to use logic- winning quickly clearly means you’re a bad killer by the questionable thinking that passes for “logic” amongst survivors.
---
And then you get looped through 5 gens and lose the game 
---
Agreed. Actually, doing that forced me to become a better killer. It improved my game. I made a rule to myself, no back to back hooking one survivor ever unless: 
---
-they are the last one left
---
-they're a toxic asshole (farmed teammates or sandbagged them or were just downright toxic assholes to me)
---
And even then it takes a lot for me to even go that far. At the most, I'll slug the person who got unhooked just to prevent them from doing objectives to buy myself more time before the gates are powered. 
---
It's always hilarious when there's one survivor in particular that just keeps running into me and has bad luck. To see them just stop running, crouch, and look at me...but I always feel bad. Usually if there's someone having a bad game with continued bad luck, I purposely let them live. I'll always let them earn enough to safety pip, because I've been there. Hell, STILL THERE half the time.
---
THE KILLER ALWAYS CELEBRATES INFRONT OF YOU. THERE COULD BE A PALLET AND A HATCH. YOU COULD HAVE ADRENALINE. WHY DO WE GET A SAD USELESS STRUGGLE BUT NO CHANCE TO UNHOOK.
---
This pisses me off so much I go to pick someone my totem and I just smack them.
---
Rank 20?
---
I think's that Dwight.
---
My idea would be that after level 50 each bloodweb has 3 perks. The ones on the outside and one close to the center. Additionally you can get 2 perks per level. It wouldn't double the progression time l, but at least drastically improve it.
---
On survivors it's somewhat ok to not have all perks unlocked but with killers BBQ, ruin, etc. are fundamental perks. There are 54 killer perks times 3 tires equals 162 bloodwebs you need to go through. And that grind is just insane for people who can't play many hours every day.
---
I tried playing killer on event, but lobby wait times were too much. Had to spend 15+ minutes in lobby for the first survivors to arrive.
---
What did he say? I wanna know :o
---
&gt;by my definition when i said i would describe said groups as people who argue that voice chat doesn’t give an advantage
---
From your definition you make it sound like SWF and communications makes the game unfair and unbalanced. Sure you get an advantage, but it's not unfair or screws the killer over to the point where it's unplayable.
---
&gt; but communicating in a way the game doesn’t allow you to do 
---
Game is on Steam, you could just as well be doing Steam voice chat. If you're already arguing SWF itself isn't a problem then who cares? If you choose your SWF you're probably already playing with players that think alike, that's why I don't do comms with my SWF normally. We just know how each person thinks. And if you're not playing with people who think alike, then the killer might as well be against 4 randoms.
---
And also, this game is a 4v1. What is the killer gonna do? Who is he gonna talk to? He is alone in this. I would maybe say your argument would hold up in a game like League of Legends where a lot of the top players started to do Discord because it helps a lot and gives a huge advantage because it's **team vs. team**.
---
TL;DR - sure voice communication gives an advantage, but not unfairly if you're competent at killer.
---
Bbq was nerfed into the ground after this recent update. I still use it for the point boost but other than for that it's completely useless now. Everyone cried about it being "over powered" because apparently being half across the map away from the killer was so overpowered because of "reasons." There were already a lot of counters to the perk but they ran it into the ground by making it so that anyone in a locker can't be seen and anyone using Jeff's new perk distortion can't be seen. The one good thing about that perk was to give the killer incentive to not camp the hook. If bbq doesn't proc then they'll camp the hook because either their close by or in a locker and no one assumes anyone is in a locker. Which there is legions new iron maiden perk that you can use with bbq if you want but that is also a waste of a perk slot for the simple fact a lot of people still use the old ways to counter bbq. There was nothing ever wrong with it. Hardcore survivor mains or most anyone in general don't like the killer knowing where they're at. Which is and can be understandable. But instead of admitting that's the issue they have they just cry that a perk is "op." The only perk that's currently op in the game right now was the recent change to noed. I'm pretty sure that got changed cause the devs are horribly bad at the game.
---
I personally think the core of the issue is the devs. They play casually and aren't very good at their own game to begin with. Most anyone here can walk all over them. They don't understand how their game is played or even how to play it optimally. They just understand how it works or how functions in the game work and work together and that's it.  They don't listen to the majority of the player base at all ever. And when they do they only listen to the mediocre players and it ruins the game for everyone else.
---
Nice! I have come across killers like you. You are nicer than me. But it is very very rare to see people like you. Yesterday, some leatherface felt pity on me and wanted to do gens since he wrecked us. In the end, I went to a hook and asked him to kill me. But he still wanted me to leave. This game still has good people left!
---
"unless you are completely shit at the game" you are aware that killer success is barely determined by his skill and by a way larger portion relies on svs doing mistakes? so acting like a good sv cant transform his ds in a 2 gen long chase is just lieing to yourself
---
But what if I play solo? Why do I have to wait for every single game to finish before seeing the killer’s build?
---
And killers can see survivors items and names even before the match, so they already have an advantage in countering survivors. 
---
I think it’s just ok the way it is
---
How bad are you all at killer that you need to moan about this stuff. Are you one of these people that gets no hooks untill noed activates? 
---
Curtain Call, my main is from there.
---
Just played against a hag yesterday and I spawned with her totem, at the end, I saw that ruin was the only perl she had
---
For that build I would run lightweight.  I see that it’s the unpopular opinion here, but I find it useful.  I actually run this exact build a decent bit, interchanging SB with other exhaustion perks here and there, and have a lot of success.  I’m not the best runner/looper and I find that I escape chases far more when trying to loop and running lightweight.
---
Empathy is a great perk too, no doubt about it.  But I personally only run it on my altruistic build and my sabo savior build, which never really gets any use because I seldom get to SWF.  
---
Not prestiging feels like you haven't maximized a character for me. And investing bloodpoints after level 50 makes you not prestige in the future since if you do, you would have lost a lot of bloodpoints. What if someday prestiging matters excluding the skins?
---
Cool. Out of curiosity: Hollow Shell or Ardent Wreath. 
---
People ask you how to be rank 8? I started playing the game 2 months ago and I’m already rank 1
---
Of you only play survivor I would suggest playing Miller it’s good to know the killer perspective. 
---
Well, thats a nice way to eat the ds, you didnt even have to chase them
---
Not to mention it's fucking suffering if you done want bad teachables in the Blood Web pool. I really want to get my Pig to lv. 50 and get Enduring on her but I had to decide between tainting my pool with Hangman's or Surveillance. I choose hangmans. Then I was only able to get 1 perk every level and I couldn't deal with it so I just had to get both of her dumb perks as teachables, just so I don't have to suffer everytime I get a bad perk. 
---
Having to decide between more perks would be so fucking nuce.
---
I agree. But as a non-swf, I want to see the perks before I go find another game.
---
So I'd like this to come when dedicated servers come and we can make it so only swf groups cant see the perks. 
---
How can you not catch after a decisive. The stun is barely anything lol. Killers moan about anything that does not result in a 4k. Decicive is useless unless you are at an open exit gate lol
---
Hollow shell
---
The aura reading will still work tho
---
I'd even be up for a system like paying double bp and being able to choose the perk you want. It really sucks when you're not viable as a killer until like lv 30-40 or even higher if you get shit rng
---
Nice.
---
"I had matches with zero contact to the killer"
---
As a survivor, I hope I don't q with you
---
The best shitpost to grace r/deadbydaylight
---
I don't see how you can believe that it isn't unfair to use 3rd party software to give you in game abilities that the game did not intend for you to have. You keep using this hyperbolic language that I am not using. It is an advantage, one that is unfair, because it uses mechanics that the game was not designed for you have to give you an edge that you were not intended to have. That means that the balance of the game that was designed for survivors who do not have voice comms will instead be skewed because of the additional information that the voice comms provide. I have at no point claimed it to be insurmountable or unplayable. But something doesn't need to be impossible to be unfair, it simply needs to be beyond the intended limitations of the game. The game was not designed and balanced with voice chat in mind.
---
Using a third party software to give you an advantage is absolutely unfair. It is ridiculous to argue it isn't. It would be just as unfair for a killer to use third party software to make a generator light up whenever a survivor was on it. "It isn't unfair after all, good survivors could still win if they are good at the game, it is just a bit of extra information. It totally doesn't unbalance it."
---
Totem security 
---
Looks like the game got bugged because someone died at the same time gen was completed?
---
This is what I was referring to earlier when I said 'directed towards healing in general'. I hear what you're saying but it's nothing that's specific to Self Care... Your points are just as valid to non-selfcare healing being performed.
---
Weird question but is your name Malygosa a combination of the names malygose and syndragosa (2 dragons from WoW or hearthstone) 
---
Yes. Oink time
---
Honestly it‘s not worth going for a 4k by slugging. You lose so much time for so little points. 
---
And as a survivor it‘s just annoying as hell. 
---
I just kill 3 and if I see the last one I go for him. Sometimes they try to block the last survivor I try to hook, then I drop them and chase the last survivor. 
---
Like sitting in the basement the entire game next to chest with insidious, if someone comes in, RIP
---
Idk maybe ?
---
I’m not sure you would. Before SWF was even in the game (also the time the shack was literally an Uncounterable infinite) you had to try quite a few times like this to get matched with your peolle. Considering the game has MANY more players now, the chance if getting into the same game is probably very low.
---
&gt;Mori
---
Had one like this called 'My box'.
---
He spent the whole game in the basement and defended his box. Left you alone if you left him alone. A silly Meg touched the box and that was the last thing silly Meg ever touched.
---
Silly Meg. 
---
Apparently so was I then
---
What if this is secretly Tru3 posting this here pretending to be a viewer so he can so he can be a sellout *thinking*
---
Try getting a perfect score on Pig. I'll wait.
---
I’ll go get my Bible
---
Yeah looks like you stated healing yourself
---
That counterplay only works if the Legion doesn't run Bloodhound.  With bloodhound, you can't shake them ever.
---
I agree with this, they should also do something about No Mither too. A killer seeing someone has no mither from the beginning is stupid. 
---
Honestly I found it easier to get the achievement using the lock of hair instead of the tuft of hair because you can hit tier 3 like three times I think, definitely at least twice, and so you can get kills earlier in the game because you don't need to build up as much Evil
---
It definitely is, but I swear to god I don't deserve to pip a lot of times that I do as survivor. Do like 1-2 gens and a small chase, get 1 hooked and somehow I feel like I always still pip
---
Yo I'm not watching an 11 minute video. Someone give me a TL;DW.
---
It still drops in chests... Completely useless item from chests feels badman
---
I am a rank 1 killer but a rank 10 survivor and that’s because I mostly play killer and not a lot of survivor 
---
True, especially Bloodhound + Sloppy Butcher. It's just a straight trail
---
lol yes, when i load into games and move, my game just shits itself for like 5 seconds and then unfreezes
---
He eats every 23 years
---
I too ferociously applaud people when I hook them in the basement. Start with a slow clap and build up from there.
---
Why you mentioning pennywise 
---
Clown is the only killer that I am genuinely still terrified of
---
I just asked how long you have been playing the game. I wasnt implying anything although yes, I do consider some matches a win.
---
Es baby surviv... oh no, not ochido’s quotes, he succ Ass
---
It's good that you're learning her early. I had her leveled for the teachables but never played a game with her until I hit rank 8. 
---
I do understand that people dont share the same POV but the issue thats going to happen if the changes happen would affect an entire community 
---
I think it's safe to say you're unoriginal and unfunny. Congrats I suppose.
---
This is how i imagine all of my teammates play in solo queue. Lmao
---
look at the top right corner
---
I don't have the pig T_T
---
Watched this video last night. Some guy follows him around sandbagging him, blocking him in corners, blocking pallets. Things like that.
---
hey, 9 points ! no bad.
---
OH AND TEAMATES THAT DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT RED, YES RED, FUCKING RANKS. I HAVE TO PLAY SWF BUT ALL MY FRIENDS ARE LOW RANK
---
Does anyone else spin around at mach speed to try and make the DS person miss? 
---
Hahaha, well at least I can afford losing I guess. And no, I only play 19/7  you think I have no life?
---
Gen tapping? A map with a killer belongings Addon? Totem hunting? Or maybe just focus on doing gens despite ruin. It takes longer but it’s more than doable. 
---
It's crazy how much info you can get out of Distortion, knowing the killer has Bitter Murmur or BBQ early on is super useful if you're trying to play stealthy. I'd honestly recommend that first. Urban Evasion is also an overall good feeling perk to run that helps. I run that on pretty much everyone I can now.  
---
I also really like Calm Spirit, but that's because I really don't like playing against the Doctor.
---
Ah. Good point. Though it would suck for one-trick killers once they get known.
---
I mean thats only true if you down them in an open field with no vaults or pallets within 16m as thats the max distance a Survivor can get in 4 seconds. But in 4 seconds you'll get 17.6m-18.4m in distance BUT thats an additional 4 seconds for them to get another 16m away so in the time you traveled 18.4m as a normal killer they got 32m
---
and all of this is a long winded way of saying you'll only get the DS User quickly if they really fuck up
---
just work on the generator like normal if you miss a perfect check stop working on it till the sparks stop (to avoid another skill check while its regressed) than continue working on it only other thing is to run around looking for the hex totem which is counter productive.
---
I mean if I see ruin I just keep working on gens just cause I know everyone else will be searching for it. By the time they find it more or less I'll be done with the gen. Atleast that's what I think this post is asking.
---
Bubba and Claudette?
---
All need to be spooky. Killers are meant to be spooky
---
Thanks! I find it really useful because I'm always trying to pallet stun and loop to get away from the killer. 
---
Nurse mains are hit or miss for me usually, like all other characters really but more so for the nurse, generally better the higher level they are but not always. 
---
Practice. 
---
Honestly, the higher you rank up, the more Hex: Ruin you should expect. It's very rare that I venture out looking for the ruin rather than committing to a gen. After a while,  you'll get used to hitting the red skill checks. It's only a pain if a survivor who can't hit them decides to sit on your gen with you.
---
Most games I'm in lately, Survivors will just play through the Ruin and destroy it late game should they stumble upon it.
---
It is not at all ridiculous to argue that it wasn't designed for it to be this way. The original design brief has no bearing on how the game is designed right now. And the game is designed right now without the ability to use voice chat without using third party software. If they add voice chat to the actual game then I would no longer consider it to be unfair because the game would be designed with that ability in mind. It is completely different to be able to do something with in game mechanics compared to using out of game software to give you abilities the game didn't give you. If the devs intended for voice chat to be a part of the game, they would have put voice chat in the game. Not force you to use third party software.
---
I see you take issue with my example because there are in game mechanics to give you information about what the survivors are doing. That isn't a problem there is a cost to doing that. It is not even slightly the same thing and it is completely disingenuous to suggest it is. Using a perk to get specific benefits from intended mechanics is totally different to using out of game software to get unintended advantage. I'll use a different example, the killer uses a cheat engine to get permanent aura reading on all survivors. Its just extra information, with the right perks they could totally know where they are anyway right?
---
Getting benefit from third party software to give you extra abilities beyond what the game gives you is unfair. It is outright cheating, same as if you use an aimbot in an FPS. Yeah, you could shoot that well, but the third party software just makes it easier. Same for survivors, yeah you could coordinate yourself without voice comms and the right combination of perks like bond or object of obsession does give you information on what the killer is doing, but voice comms gives the benefit of multiple aura perks without having to spend the opportunity cost of actually filling in the perk slots.
---
Now, even if I was to concede that the advantage of voice comms isn't all that much. I don't, but for the sake of argument, lets say I did. That is still a concession from you that it does give some benefit. Benefit that again, requires you to use third party software in the game to give you an advantage you would not have if you played the game without using third party software. That is unquestionably an advantage you are not supposed to have if playing with in game mechanics, therefore and unfair advantage. That advantage might not be enough to win the game for you if the killer is substantially better, but that doesn't mean it is not an unfair advantage.
---
When the nurse tried her best but she didn't succeed... I felt that on a spiritual level

Legion is my favourite killer to play against, we just love sliding around.

[Here is the youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NA1gs4VeCg)
---
I have to admit I was one of the killers that burned a mori when there were 3 party streamers. 
---
Didn't want to ruin it for the survivors and decided not to kill any of em with it.
---
Pretty much just bloody clothes and bragging rights. Hopefully they introduce better rewards with prestiging like higher prestige tiers with with new clothing rewards. 
---
Pros: Bloody cosmetic, slightly higher chance of rarer items becoming more frequent in your bloodweb with every prestige
---
Cons: You lose everything you've ever purchased on the bloodweb before -- your items, offerings &amp; perks all are gone &amp; have to be repurchased.
---
My guess originally was Michael/Laurie given that the new Halloween came out recently. However, given that nothing came of that--
---
I will continue to hold out and sweat for Freddy/Quentin cosmetics. Give me that speedo boy!
---
"Why does that work for ochido and not for me omg you stupid lagswitcher!"
---
Idk then, I'll just add it to the list of things I don't understand about the game, which was basically only why people who use BBQ and chili camp the hooks
---
Pretty much this. If you see Ruin, break it. If you don't, just keep working on gens -- they're still doable.
---
Epic
---
I had a duo swf  that had the names "Mori him" and "Nooo Mori HIM"
---
I mori'd them both and let the last two escape
---
Pressing F for you, brother.
---
I agree because I like Kate but why does it make it better?
---
Yeah I mean successful, not sure if that should be in context. The time for the ability should be around the same time it took for trapper to set traps before they buffed the speed recently.  
---
I didn't want over the top perks, I wanted things that would synergize or at least seem worthwhile to use in a perk pool for certain builds.
---
From my own experience and seeing other peoples blood webs, there's basically no noticeable differencen in the rarity of the items you get.
---
So if you prestige ir's only for clothes and bragging rights.
---
I prestiged a survivor for the achievement but I'm just going for all perks on all killers and skipping prestige.
---
Ah okay. I didn't know that's what the achievement required. It is a very shitty thing to do.
---
You should have seen the game on launch. Saving up to the 500k cap only got you to level 16.
---
Low effort cosplay like

Counter to Ruin? Spawn in the game.

There's a 95% chance it will be near at least one survivors spawn location.

I still find it hard to get over how ugly she looks as a child.
---
Your traps are gross
---
Or..... you could walk away and find a car spot or one to trap him.
---
Some options to counter hex ruin:  
---
Tapping. Doing the gen normally. Finding the hex totem. Running perks or items that increase "Great" success zones. Running Stake Out. Running Small Game.
---
Newer survivors let Ruin ruin (hahahah) their whole game. That's one reason why nearly every killer runs it, they have fond memories of getting 4ks with 4 gens remaining. I say the absolute best thing to do is just do the gens. A long time ago someone did the math and said Ruin usually will just add 10-30 seconds to a gen.
---
Yeah the achievement is for killing all 4 survivors in a match by your hand. I'm not sure it works with a mori. Most people going for it use Judith's Tombstone combined with something else, usually Fragrant Tuft of Hair so they can have unlimited tier 3 while also being able to kill people in t3
---
Ah, a Leatherface main I see.
---
true
---
doctor main
---
The other boob is big, too! It's just hidden by the ginormous ruffle. No worries!
---
Combat straps ;)
---
Why does this type of thing always get downvoted? It's true!
---
A SWF GROUP GOT SALTY WITH ME AND SPEND THE WHOLE GAME HIDING - SPENT FREAKING 15 MINUTES TO FIND THEM (THEY DID NO GENS AFTER THEIR DECISIVE FRIEND DIED)
---
THANK GOD I RAN WHISPERS AND SLOWLY CAUGHT A CLAUDETTE WHO THEN SERVED AS A BAIT FOR THE OTHER TWO TO COME OUT
---
TOO BAD SAID CLAUDETTE GOT THE HATCH
---
Survivor names and items arent that big of a deal. The only thing I would know is that someone has a tool box, I do not know the add ons, same with a heal kit, I just see the item but not if the survivor has insta heal or not 
---
It's BHVR, why would they put effort into this over bringing new cosmetics? Right?
---
No taxation without indentation.
---
Thanks for the tips. Going to learn how to master this skill. 
---
I like them all honestly all come with at least two good perks, and I like all the characters even if some need a lot of help, I grew up with Freddy so it’s great to see him in a game, just need Mr Vorhees though I know that’s never gonna happen. 
---
To be fair, when it comes to the legion blood hound exploit, no mither actually is the best way to counter it. I would be super on board to see it become a meta perk.
---
Can they see perks?  One of the most important parts of the game?

Hmm, I see what you're saying there--that is a lot of investment into injuring/using injured people.

You are probably not holding the button until the animation completes

I always check the outskirts on the swamp and j can usually find them.

If you're solo, then why would you need to see killer perks anyways?

I had 7 bp streamers that I was saving and I didn’t even know there was an event 
---
I legitimately yell "LEAVE ME ALONE BINGBONG" when he's chasing me/when I spot him. Every single time.

Windows + loops + balanced landing = killer :( 
---
Your ideas are bad and you should feel bad.
---
The Gang: "We'll counter Legion." 
---
Michael Myers: "OH BABY LOOK AT THIS." 
---
Playing addonless and playing perkless are two very large gaps, trust me. 
---
I seriously don't understand why people dislike camping Bubba so much. I'm no fan of playing Insidious camper mode but I really don't mind others. I mean, it's a strategy. sometimes they get 4k, sometimes they only able to get one. pretty balanced if you ask me. besides, suits the original Leatherface 100% it's some spicy rp right there. 
---
Direct counter is small game. 
---
This
---
I don't think that noed is a bad design, it sacrifices a perk slot until the end of the game, and then gives you a greater opportunity to get a kill, like a good final chance. The only problem is that every other perk is shit in comparison... And obviously it sucks if the killer already had the upper hand
---
Mannequin challenge is so 2016
---
Hmm. Same could be said for running enduring to counter ds. Though tbh both perks beed reworks to be fun. Noed just isn't as bad as some people say.
---
Piping in this game is sadly super easy as a survivor and there's not much reward for it. Killers and survivors can be potatoes in rank 1 as much as in the lower ranks.
---
Mannequin Challenge is so 2017 
---
Thanks for the guidance. I'm not used to hit Hex/Great skill checks every time, but doing so and ignoring the totem until later on seems like the valuable way to go.
---
FPS on console gets killed by anything that applies a status on S/K, it can be Thanatophobia, SB, Third Seal, even Bloodlust

Neither. It's just easy to rank up. 
---
No. He is actually trash because he takes a lot of time to do shit, in a game where time efficiency is the most important atribute. Just brokenly op as: theres no counter play and takes 0 skill.

---
Alright cool i like always pipped when playing killer been playing for like  12 days but same with survivor just as much but games fun so thats all that matters
---
I like where your mind is, but there are some real viability issues here.
---
For starters, you said you want this to be a tracking based killer.
---
It's really odd to me that the ability of a killer who is tracking focused reveals his location to the prey.
---
And there are killers, like Doc, who are much better at tracking. Especially since the 32 meter limit would be a way that survivors could just misdirect the killer very easily.
---
**Killer's High**
---
Not useful. Bloodlust is straight up just not needed almost ever. Having a perk that helps bloodlust would never be used and for good reason. It's similar to the problem with Monstrous Shrine.
---
**Extreme Hunger**
---
Okay, so the only perk needed for attack cooldown is Save The Best For Last. Nothing will probably ever be designed that could top that, and as the other guy said, if this is about missed attacks, then it's just a worse Unrelenting which is already useless, and since it's for successful attacks on injured survivors, it is advanced useless.
---
**Hunter's Instinct**
---
This one I like a lot. Kind of a reverse BBQ &amp; Chili. *Might* be OP with Make Your Choice, however.
---
I do like the idea of a tracking/hunting based killer but I think having killers like Doc and Trapper and Huntress the new killer should come from a place of modernity or futurism and have some kind of technology based ability.
---
Like, the killer could drop a tracker on the field and if a survivor steps on it it would give a blip to the killer occasionally.  
---
&gt; With the design of Legion being in the game, I wanted slightly less game breaking mechanics 
---
Legion is not gamebreaking. A couple of their perks are, but not the base design. Legion cannot handle large maps or spaced generators at all. Definitely has the worst map pressure in the game.
---
Also you can try window tech / juke against him. If legion is not stupid they wont fall for it but usually they do so yea its worth trying.
---
Yeah but you need a key soo.....
---
They should make it bound to E like Dead hard or Diversion. 
---
I consider playing four games that get forty thousand points each to be better than playing one that pays a hundred thousand if the time spent is equal... so killing people as fast as possible and moving on is my goal.
---
I always feel differently when events begin- but when survivors show no interest in playing nice, I slowly skip back to playing exactly as normal and enjoying the extra points as a nice bonus.
---
The worst is when there's still 5 gens left and the last survivor just hides thinking they can win somehow.
---
I use Bond, Lightweight, Quick &amp; Quiet, and Iron Will. I used to run Premonition, but with Bond and general game sense I don't even miss it now. With the other perks I can still be sneaky while still being able to maintain a fast speed.
---
Ife you drop him like 5times he wiggels free automatic :)
---
Yes (¬‿¬)
---
Iron Bill
---
I didn’t either!! Saw your comment and double checked and yup there she is xD
---
in my hundreds of hours killer experience, gotta say it's latter D: I mean I recognize it as strategy but hate it. on both sides. as killer it's just annoying in end game cause they always apart from my terror have some perk to inform them I'm close. like, yeah, it's given by Devs and all but to me it's much worse than ds players. ds players use their whole perk slot for one-time thing that doesn't even always work but these little rats only pick something they can be using whole game and it's something not to help their mates and be good sports but something to stay as far as possible from a killer.
---
as survivor I hate these types even more D: so what if they did two gens? they only were able to because other three were consistently in chase or saving each other. these immersed sons and daughters of jackal would never come for a save even though it's basically free points, would never tank a hit, would never take the aggro when you're on your last hook and they've never even been in chase. antimates. disgusting. sometimes I wish I'd run Bond instead of We'll Make It, Botany Knowledge and Borrowed Time for safe and smooth saves, just so I could lure the killer on them but I refuse to leave my teammates behind. and worst part with those is that they're leaving asap the gates are opened, not trying to help others to save someone who made opening real by keeping the killer busy. or sometimes they leave, scared of Blood Warden, before killer hooked you not giving you a chance to try and unhook yourself for at least additional 1.5k points. sheesh, way too many times my first hook was my last hook because of people like this. 
---
Dribbling gives you tempo so the DS user can't do gens because he's on the hook and a teammate can't do gens because he has to save. (Also a lot of people instantly go for the save so you could be wasting more than just 2 people's time).
---
You gain even more tempo if you run BBQ. (Which you should on pretty much every killer.)
---
I'd only eat DS while I have a dribble-able hook if I'm running enduring and the tempo swing isn't mandatory to get a lead.
---
Plus, most DS players are at least ok at looping and they won't just run in a straight line in an open field.
---
Saw! Amanda is guaranteed fun for me   
---
This running joke is not funny and makes me think there really are some sweets

---
no, because with fucked sounds and scratch marks more and more killers use Bloodhound because blood doesn't lie. and you don't bleed with No Mither. they also can't hear you AT ALL with the fucked sounds. as in you're constantly hurt therefore no breathing sounds even if they use Stridor. 
---
It remind me of one game as survivor with my friend. I rescued 2 other no premade ppl. Than my friend told me to stop cuz I'm killing them. And yea Spirit appear from nowhere, tunnel them and hook them again.
---
P3 50 rank 3 means something.
---
If you think it doesn’t you’re an idiot.
---
I mean, I've thought for years that the game should have in-game voice chat for survivors. It's a team-based game for the survivors, they should be able to communicate. You wouldn't say that a team shouldn't be able to communicate on a game like CS:GO, so why would it be any different for a team on DBD? It's not extreme to say that a team should be able to communicate.
---
The one good point he made was that it would waste time to have to wait to see what perks the killer had. Obviously you gain an advantage if you can inform your team of the killer's perks, but assuming you're a solo survivor it would suck to have to wait 10 minutes just to confirm that you died because they had nurses or bbq or something.
---
Damn and when you run the remaining 13,6m they will have run another 12,36m! And if you try to catch up to that distance they will be 11,24m away again? Itll take you another 2,55 seconds to catch up, in which they will just run 10,22 meters again! Man, DS is truly OP, you will never catch the survivor!
---

---
Had a person named MoriMeForChristmas join my lobby, now who am I to deny their request?
---
&gt; and I think misdirection with the tracking ability would be at least part of the skill with the killer, I don't want it to be reliable but at least make it so it at least tips him to the basic direction or area the survivor is in. The rest of it is reliant on him.
---
This is ridiculous. You designed a killer that can get easily fucked by survivors on purpose lmfao wow
---
&gt; In regards to bloodlust, I thought maybe something that catered towards it would at least give more value to it.
---
0 + 0 = 0
---
&gt;  if it was a natural ability such as better sense of smell and hearing would be optimal for me in regards to what I would design.
---
Run Stridor then
---
I usually do 1 gen and save someone, but i still manage to get a pip.
---
Ah now you add in rank 3 to show that you actually put time in survivor vs bloodpoints. Congrats.
---
What am I missing here? 
---
Hex: Trap Card - Anytime you are stunned by a survivor, the survivor is also stunned.
---
as survivor - do 2 gens(better with someone else), save one person off the hook safely, engage in a chase for a bit. guaranteed pip.
---
as killer - do your objectives. kick gens, break pallets, use your powers, max that shit. get couple hooks and a kill. that's your killer guaranteed pip. 
---
Dat great tho lol
---
Well what am I meant to do then? If your solution is for them to be led directly to the survivor then fine then, maybe I'm wrong.  
---
Stridor doesn't exactly fix the design idea I had lol
---
What movie is the can't hear one?
---
Alright im not gonna argue i guess, but:
---
&gt; more and more killers use Bloodhound 
---
Who are you talking about here? Yourself? I have not seen a single killer run bloodhound for weeks at EU rank 1. Even when i watch some streams on my second monitor while doing other stuff, never have i seen bloodhound anywhere.
---
No
---
My point is you can't instantly down the DS user again. Just 16m is enough to find a loop or a vaulting point.
---
In my example its just an open field but how many maps have 16-32m of wide open spaces? Theres gonna be a jungle gym, a pallet, or a building in that distance
---
I’m not sure if you’re being funny, but I genuinely like surveillance a lot.

Here is the link: https://discord.gg/deadbydaylight
---
You’re good, but this match was also in rank 12, currently rank 5
---
Is farming legal? Sounds like it's not the intent of the game.
---
Why is teabagging considered toxic? Cant you just hit them when they do that?
---
Shame that if this is the case, that you haven't provided me with the original creator so I can actually credit the person.
---
Yes!! When everyone is dead there's 2 gens to go and you hatch.. you didn't win bro it's just a pat in the back from the game so you won't feel bad
---
This happens against Wraith with Sloppy Butcher specifically. Not sure if you can use the addon to cause the effects. Some true spaghetti code.
---
10 fps \o/
---
farming is “legal” but it’s generally frowned upon in any kind of online game. it’s kind of like a big “fuck you” to the killer in DBD. 
---
the killer can try and hit them, but survivors typically teabag on the opposite side of a pallet or at a distance, so it’s unlikely 
---
I can't argue that. It does suck, but I think it is a fair tradeoff. Because you can't have it both ways, either you inconvenience the average player but allow for a powerful exploit that can shift the balance of the game, or you allow the exploit (in let's be fair, a small minority of games) in order to not keep a player waiting and watching the game to find out the killer's perks. I don't think you should be denied your score either way, but I do appreciate that it sucks for average joe.
---
Sounds like Jen
---
Well, there are four Survivors, so each add-on has the potential to be multiplied by four. But yeah, we could use less rare variants of the Brand New Part that have fewer skillchecks and such. The most interesting add-ons for the medkit might just be the needles.
---
Enduring is good for other things, not just DS. Small Game is ONLY good for totems. NOED pretty much completely counters teammates being decent
---
I've played against it yesterday on Rotten Fields... I almost ran into him right after losing him, luckily corn blindness saved my stupid ass.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
The only serial killer here is you killing all the fun. 
---
Except survivor teams running multiple streamers usually use the same logic of quick games for the bonus and genrush the fuck out of a killer, denying them as many points as possible. It really does cut both ways.  I'm much more likely to DC on a 4 party streamer game at the start than attempt fighting the cancer that usually follows.
---
I'm cursed with party streamers so almost never run them.   If survivor, I'm always found first and face camped.  If killer, its a seal team 6 SWF group.
---
There is a difference here though. I don't think adding an official voice chat to the game is a bad thing. In fact, I think it would be fine if it is added. But it should be added alongside a buff to killers to compensate for it being an actual mechanic in the game that gives a huge boost to the survivor's ability to coordinate. The problem with voice chat right now is that the game is not designed for it in the current build of it and you need to use third party software to be able to do voice chat. Using any third party software to give yourself an in game advantage is surely a form of cheating, even if voice chat is a relatively benign form.
---
Now, I will caveat my opinion that it does break the lore of the game just a little bit, like, the reason there is no voice chat is that the survivors are trying to be silent to not attract the killer's attention. In game it kind of breaks the internal logic if the survivors have a telepathic connection that the killer can't hear, but that is a side issue.
---
update your software, i play on lowest settings, i don’t have dips at all
---
Yeah, but Thanatophobia is a waste of a perk slot. It does way too little to slow things down. 
---
We’re Gonna Bill Forever
---
* Dwight blows up gen
---
* 3 Claudettes pop out of hiding
---
SHHHHHHH
---

---
Aha okay thanks
---
So teabagging is basically just DbD's version of bm, it doesn't give you an actual advantage in game
---
ecks dee my dude
---
You don’t have enough time when you’re chasing someone in frenzy to look at the ground for blood. You just have to be good at tracking survivor movement. Stridor is better for tracking, IMO.
---
Either i find ruin at the start or i lose the match because i couldnt find it. 
---
Exactly this. I made the same mistake when I first started playing killer. 
---
Whoa, whoa, whoa...end game chat??

chainsawing someone mid way through them unhooking another survivor is so satisfying. ive got a clip saved of me chainsawing a claudette at the exit gate from across the map. one of the best things ive ever done

A lot of my friends went home for Christmas (university students) and didn't have their PCs, and now they're all going back to uni only to have missed the whole winter event..... 
---
u did nothing wrong; they need to learn to wait until u leave the hook fully before unhooking. u saw them and reacted accordingly. its not ur job to make sure they have fun. when u play killer u play killer, so its possible a survivor will never have fun. just focus on urself and ur own fun.
---
I agree most perks dont matter if the other SWF survivors know in advance. 
---
There's a few though that can make a difference in the way the remaining SFW play though:  NOED, Make Your Choice, BBQ, Blood Warden, Deerstalker, Bloodhound, Whispers, etc
---
‘Camping’ is perfectly legit in certain situations. If they are dive bombing the hook then you have no reason to leave. This isn’t really even camping.
---
Play the game to have fun and expect salt from time to time when you win. These types of people would probably talk trash if you lost to them, so there is no making them happy that’s not at your expense.

Quick question for a Myers main, I know that the Tombstone+Tuft Of hair turns Myers into a killing machine, but what about Tombstone Piece+Tuft?  I know that the Piece says that the tier 3 gauge is significantly decreased with each kill, but shouldn’t the infinite tier 3 from the tuft counteract that?
---
I just ask because I tried the Tombstone+Tuft, and it felt really annoying because of how much slower my movement was due to the movement penalty of the Tombstone that the Piece does not have.
---
Yes please, and anyone saying blah blah what about kids screaming, cursing, etc......It's called a mute button, not that hard.
---
&gt; lockers hide auras
---
Wait, WHAT? My Spine Chill locker strats were actually not entirely nub? Now we just need the ability to Self-care in the locker.
---
Spawning right next to a ruin or devour hope totem is one of the most satisfying things ever lol
---
Legion is a gang of teenagers, if that shit isn't scary I don't know what is.
---
I think i’ll try that later. thanks for the insight fella
---
You gotta love the downvotes because you know people got pissed off that you're better than them
---
https://youtu.be/0iKRVFqp_5E
---
Nice try, survivor main.
---
Without joking though, you should check peoples claims before blindly accusing them of being wrong.
---
Rank totally matters to a certain extent. I agree that Ranks 3+ contain players with very similar skill levels, but if a Rank 1 killer plays against Rank 10 survivors, it will be a bloodbath. Same goes for Rank 1 survivors playing against a Rank 10 killer. By the way, I’m not talking about Rank 10 killers/survivors at the beginning of the season reset (as they would have been Rank 1 before), I’m talking about whatever rank those players would normally get to or stay at throughout the whole season. 
---
Good players get to Rank 1. It just happens. Bad players, on the other hand, don’t. And usually people who say that rank doesn’t matter don’t get to Rank 1.
---
Alternate definition of farming that is often used:  When survivors unhook a survivor in a completely unsafe situation just got some extra bloodpoints.  Being chased by the killer?  Unhook the guy on the hook and you get extra points and the killer will often chase them instead.
---
Do you get fps drops when you play on any corn map as the legion? When i use feral frenzy on a corn map my fps drops to like 15.

---
I'm a killer main you twat. 
---
You're confused buddy. We're talking about the blood following exploit, not tracking people in frenzy. The blood following exploit is when the Legion just looks at the blood on the ground, causing the chase to not start, and then following the deep wounded survivor's blood tracks. That way they'll have to run, but because they chase hasn't started, they'll get downed from the deep wound. And if they stay to mend, you can just down them normally.
---
Haha, thanks. xD
---
For some reason this is too Ochidoey for me to enjoy. Like just way too many dumbass unneccesary sound effects and earrape. Sorry OP
---
Bah, you made me blush! Not true, but thank you very much! :P
---
There is no meaningful difference between Rank 1 and Rank 10+.
---
Thank you so much! This one was really fun to draw.
---
Read the description, it says that it breaks pallets AFTER you've hit someone. Same applies for global heartbeat
---
People aren’t pissed off that you’re better, you continue to be a dick, so you get downvoted.
---
Most of the time DS users get dribbled or slugged. If not, they either miss the skillcheck or use DS once and that's it the perk is used and no longer does anything. Noed can be used to instadown everyone more than once and can completely change the game. Especially if the exits are right next to each other.
---
They're common giveaways on my Twitch stream, RoryDiesALot! At the end of the month, if I have a lot left, I'll also do a giveaway on Reddit.
---
Yes survivors which mean more than one. You should not be salty if you tunneling 1 survivor the entire match and he just loops the crap out ya. I have friend that tries to do that so everyone else just dose gens. Most of of the time it works. And killers get perty salty.
---
Except a killer seeing the item wouldn’t make a difference 
---
Is your discord tag 6666? It says you joined the server last week :P 
---
I did do the tattoos, yeah. Thank you so much!
---
I do prize giveaways on my Twitch (RoryDiesALot), and if there's a lot left towards the end of the month, I'll also do a Reddit giveaway if the mods are okay with it.
---
As a Killer main, I have to ask. What do you do against a cancerous 4-man SWF? (Looping, t-bagging pallets, more than one blocking the hook)
---
Ah. Never mind, then. I thought by “exploit” you meant that you can’t normally see tracks in frenzy, but you can see blood, so Bloodhound makes it easier to track. My bad.
---
Aww, that's really sweet of you! I just have Twitch and my Reddit post history, sadly. Not a big social media person!
---
&gt;I've seen console games. they're literally easier because the game itself is created for keyboard and mouse. anything that was created for keyboard and mouse when transferred on console becomes easier since you don't have same mobility with your controllers.
---
That makes no sense. If you have less mobility control how is it any easier?
---
&gt;consoles attract casual players 
---
Sure, I guess. Although casual players wouldn't reach high rank so why would you compare them to top pc players? Pc has loads of low rank potato survivors too.
---
&gt;PC gamers tend to be more competitive and spend more time mastering their skills. 
---
Lol. It's a videogame, hardly a skill. This game doesn't have the same kind of skill ceiling as actual competitive games. And if by competitive you mean salty and think they're superior to everyone else, absolutely. 
---
&gt;if I met them in my games and would just kill them all before they pop two gens.
---
 This guy kills. 
---
The game performs worse and looks worse on console, therefore making the game harder to play. Because it performs better on pc, players on both sides are obviously able to perform better than those on console because the game is more responsive. 
---
Most likely, because they had mixed ranks as well
---
I think p1 claudette has the bloody jacket which is *bloody good* camoflauge in most maps. I've literally gotten away with so much (and have messed up on the way) by just squatting by a tree. It's great fun, watching the killer circle you, clueless!
---
I often prefer Spine Chill because I know if the Killer is coming towards my location specifically. Premonition might just mean he's running past towards a friend. Also, if I'm out in the open, it's a good indicator of when Freddy or Wraith sees me.
---
But really, the right answer is obviously to run both at once.
---
I don't think I've ever seen a survivor main say killers are op. Infact I became a survivor main because of how weak the killers are. 
---
Having nothing at your disposal to outplay a killer is OP. This means you have to rely on mistakes that the killer makes.
---
With all killers got like 20 FPS in corn fields because optimization is shit,with legion its very laggy when you use feral frezy so i guess
---
Wow congrats bro. I'm getting really tired of survivors constantly saying killers are OP, and when I ask they just say noob.
---
Cool concept except I’d rather have tommy Jarvis as the survivor since he is Jason’s rival and the hero of the franchise 
---
To my knowledge, this is just happening with Wraith. It’s a pretty bad bug on Xbox too. Never seen it until recently. 
---
You have pallets, exhaustion perks, DS, Windows, 360 (not necessary but non the less a good counter).
---
It depends.If you like the perks, add ons and offerings you have now, don't do it.It's mainly for bragging rights, bloody clothes and getting slightly better add ons and offerings in your bloodwebs.If you do decide to prestige, I would highly suggest you have a backup character to use and have at least 1 million bloodpoints and that way the grind will be tolerable
---
Not sure how I feel about this
---
Good work OP, and great song choice. (Also Jameson).
---
Because killers  gripe they got gen rushed and that survivors are toxic when he did nothing but tunnel 1 survivor all game and that survivor was able to loop until all gens were done for the most part. Most people I know don’t care if they get tunneled because it means the gens going to get done faster.  
---
Yes with the blind warrior addon i think is called, you case the same bs effect
---
Okay buddy. You keep looking for reasons to be mad. Noed is almost never a problem for me, cause I actually know how to cleanse totems. Honestly, people just want something to complain about. It's ridiculous.
---
TIL survivors don’t have perks, items, pallets, windows, third person view, the ability to hide, and teammates 
---
I’m not sure you really understand what’s going on. This is basically a meme build, meaning one does not use this to try and dominate the survivors. It is being used (if correctly) in a way to just have a fun game for both the survivors and the killer. Going on a map like backwater swamp makes the build basically 100% useless and no fun for anyone (maybe a little for a high ego survivor who thinks they’re a god for looping a tier 1 Myers).
---
It really depends more on how often you play. If you play a few hours every day, you’re more likely to get to a higher rank before the season ends. 
---
I think a good change would be to make all the bloodpoint increase offerings way less cheaper. You can't really expect to burn a common hunter and get more than the 3,000 bp than you used to get it in the web.

Personally I don't run NOED on Myers,but I have seen players run that perk when they use Scratched Mirror.I am like you, I don't why players run NOED on Myers, but to each their own
---
If that happens I can agree that killer are OP
---
Everyone is using NOED because it's crutch and meta right now.
---
Nurse is the only op killer right? She can teleport across pallets and windows, exhaustion perks only give you one way to escape every 40 seconds, and DS only one a game.
---
No one says Killer is OP. Except for new players.
---
It’s reset at 100
---
Ds is a crutch perk
---
I ran it I prestiged him and I had nothing else to put on him. 
---
Yeah Nurse is OP, I'm asking why killer are OP in general.
---
I'm scared.
---
Yeah, I guess so
---
Can you show me proof of no one saying that killers are OP.
---
Speed boost my dude 
---
Only nurse and insta saw billy are issues in my eyes no ones op though. 
---
They really aren’t besides nurse and maybe huntress.
---
&gt;Except for new players.
---
That's not proof
---
I try my best to refrain from having noed but it's just so hard. Sometimes for me it's either put on toxic perks that make me feel like I can get an easy win or quit the game. I'm glad I decide to quit when I do, because you can't get anything easy in the game without ruining someone else's experience.
---
/r/lostredditors
---
Damn Claudette about to be double sandbagged. 
---
And me as well
---
How is Huntress op? She is like one of the mos balanced killer in the game.
---
Yes you can.Once you get to level 50, you can either continue to renew your bloodweb to buy stuff or prestige
---
That's killer specific. More like killers in general.

When you play Ana on a new map, but snof starts speaking Finnish.

Ah, thank you.
---
If you are close to her there isn’t much you can do to her, because if she’s good pallets and windows are a free hit for her.
---
It is always Oink time.
---
*whispers* click the upvote button 
---
Survivors think any amount of challenge is OP
---
Oh then no, killers are underpowered, games are completely up to survivors they control the pace of the game. 
---
I just followed you tip and it works wonderfully. Every killer so far does a straight march to their hex totem in the beginning of the match.
---
Yeah, that's just low ranking complaining. Camping is when you're sitting next to a hooked survivor to secure the kill without any other reason. If you can see a survivor going for the unhook, you have a reason to be there. Nothing wrong with what you did.
---
Is this a new cosmetic?
---
Damn he’s hot for a 30 year old. 
---
Ok sorry,yes you can you can get to level 100 and than you get to devotion and resets you back to level 1
---
This guy gets it.
---
Ohhh my bad. I swear I read it a couple times to see if I missed something lol
---
This guy also gets it
---
They're is not a single Dead by Daylight influencer that says Killers are OP. 
---
But please, prove me wrong.
---
In the pre game lobby it kinda makes a big difference.
---
i used to use it when i was new to dbd as a crutch, haha (my cousin gifted me the halloween pack so i wanted to use Myers and it happened that the bloodweb gave me noed pretty early)
---
Corn blindness is a real problem, off topic but true.
---
I understand that some people use it as an excuse to justify themselves. I'm rank 1 on both survivor and killer, but I know that doesn't make me good because it is so easy to pip and rank, it's a joke. The only thing rank does is match-making, which can be a hidden mechanic that doesn't need to be reset every month. Rank should reflect the player's skill, not how often the player doesn't disconnect. Rank should feel earned and achieved, and players should be rewarded for their achievements at the end of each season to demote depipping.
---
Thx. Apparently I have too much freetime. And no life, I guess. Haha ;) 
---
Get some distance. Don't try and run around her within 5M radius. If you know a pallet/window is unsafe move away or try and bait a throw.
---
It makes a tiny difference, besides you can already do this.. the post is saying about post game 
---
I never said they were. I am only asking why people consider them to be OP.
---
Teabagging, with when your lay flat on the bed, whilst your boyfriend/Husband squats above you, slowly descending whilst in the squat position and places his testicles into your mouth,
---
If you read my responses you can see I'm defending killers.
---
&gt;Balanced dab
---
Perfectly balanced. 
---
I rotate the killers when I'm doing this, Wraith is pretty fun for this reason. I run Distressing and the Soot that doesn't make your terror radius go away. So in theory, the closer they get to the totem, the more threatening it becomes. Bing bong.
---
Yeah your right there’s counterplay to her that isn’t there with the nurse.
---
We don't know you have decisive strike. We know one person is an obsession, not if they have DS. Not only that, the entire team could run DS and the only way to find out is getting stabbed.
---
Not if the entire team has no mither. 
---
Funny note: i had a really long spree of games where as soon as i saw the perk "huntress lullaby" pop up i knew it was a huntress. It was always a huntress every game that perk showed. expect one recent game where a trapper out of nowhere used it, Ruined my perfect spree :c
---
I only use NOED with the scratched mirror. There’s no other reason to use it.
---
SFW is inherently an unfair advantage in standard queue.
---
Yeah, np. The way bhvr explained it could have been better
---
You can also let everyone else die...
---
Sometimes it isn't your problem but the connection to the servers themselves. If it is a one off thing, that could be it. If it is a common thing, it is either your internet is the problem, or maybe you have a problem with yoru installed files that is causing it.
---
I dont care about Michaels im more confused why people use noed on Billy when you have instadown as chainsaw 
---
My cat goes apeshit when she hears the bing bong. He’s her husbando.
---
It practically determines whether Lightborn or Franklin's are used. Lots of killers will then add moris or such if multiple flashlights. So no, it is not a tiny difference.
---
I do know what the original post was. Hence why I said I agreed. I just added a couple of points that were similar enough to warrant consideration.
---
Yep. I saw people trying this against Zubat the other day on stream, he just turned the right direction and stabbed that ass
---
I know what you have said and I'm saying your wrong when you say *"...all Survivor mains say Killers are OP."*
---
I thought you guys were going to get it when the Dwight went upstairs and you blocked the staircase to slow me down. I almost failed my sole duty. That is roughly when the totem told me "Let the slugs race"
---
killers are OP because they win more then survivors do.  across all maps the escape rate was between 35 and 45 percent.  so in that fact alone is reason enough to believe killers are more over powered then survivors are.  
---
Also NOED and Sloppy is  meta rn  on any killer so yea have fun survivors
---
Well when it was it’s not even hex ruin there was no point in doing it. It was devoured hope but he was not chasing us. 
---
How detailed is that data? Over what time period was it measured? Are DC's counted as deaths? Is that escape rate of a single survivor? Can it be directly converted into probabilities of 1K, 2K, 3K and 4K?
---
Also, it is much more likely to die and rank up as a survivor than score 0-2 kills and rank up as killer. This brings us to the problem of defining victory conditions for both sides. 
---
Voice Chat = free aura perks.
---
Well then both of our posts can't be true, lol.
---
no I did not take a bait. I thought I would just ask and prove those who think killers are OP wrong.
---
Yeah, I give advice sometimes.
---
Once the unrelenting crying ends I'll stop. 
---
The idea that survivors have no counterplay at all is the fucking dumbest shit I've ever heard
---
Tbh i don't like premonition. It only gives you the hint once and then it goes on cooldown. It doesn't tell if the killer is looking at you it just tells that they are in that general direction where as spine chill tells you that you really are in danger, because they are looking at you and most likely know that you are there. Premonition doesn't give as much information, has a 30 second cooldown, gives a lot of false alarms, and doesn't give you that sweet 6% speed increase that you need in desperate times (healing a downed person for example). So spine chill&gt;&gt;&gt;premonition. 
---
I feel as though you haven't versed any god tier nurses yet. It's pretty much an instadown once she spots you. Your strategy wont work since the best nurses can usually counter such a thing. The only way that your strategy works is if you have dead hard and use it. 
---
Otherwise chases don't really last that long with nurse since she can precise blink and hit you. No god tier nurse is giving you that much time that simply running a different direction saves you. 
---
She's not overrated at all. Granted billy is much easier to pick up, nurse is still the best killer on pc overall for very good reason. 
---
they Talk about some dbd youtuber
---
where is it? 
---
Can we have a link to it? I can’t see a url on the picture 
---
Just cause the devs balance it by 2 escapes and 2 sacrifices and that killer have a slightly higher winrate all has to do with skill and also what the player is playing.
---
Yeah as I said in a comment above, I found someone who already was on the server who invited me.
---
Point still stands tho that it’s extremely hard to find an invite link which is kinda silly seeing how it’s the official server.
---
New perk - disgusting fucking shoe
---
I never said all survivors mains think killers are OP. All I asked is why/if you think killer are OP.
---
I don't feel like this is a good fix, but I also don't understand your issue.
---
If you're bored camping your totems, then why aren't you bored camping gens?
---
If staying by your totems means you get less hits and longer games, is that really how you want to play?
---
Does being an aggressive gen patroller and hoping your totems last work better for you? Some survivors act like your harmless after that (tbag, clicking, general aggro) and make more mistakes.
---
I always think about psychology, because "mind gaming" is very useful here, but otherwise, I'm confused, especially in your example.
---
Are you saying lullaby could have less percentage penalty per fail and be permanent?
---
I don't like that, because some people can power through those hexes while others cant.
---
Regardless, try and keep a trick up your sleeve.
---
Make them think you're out of hatchets, or that you're *definitely* teleporting to the trap on the other side of the pallet. 
---
Hexes are the definitive high risk - high reward killer perks (I still have yet to get and use a third token in owning devour hope for months) and I think they are good options for playstyles. There is no part of me that wishes to abolish Hex perks. What else would survivors do besides (maybe) heal and gen rush at that point?
---
I agree in terms of balance, that is what it means. It does take some practice to be able to tell people what the locations you are in actually are, but it absolutely lets you relay yours, and the killer's location to allies at any given time, and also lets you communicate on the hook. In the current version of the game, it is an unfair advantage. That said, I am not opposed to it being added if the killer side is also buffed to account for the fact that voice chat exists. But I doubt it ever would be, like I said, it conflicts with the lore of the game to have the survivors talking to each other without the killer also getting directional voice every time the survivors use it, and at that point, it is more of a debuff for the survivors.
---
Legions is an unskilled killer to begin with. Pill Bottle is a fun add-on to use but still Freddy is very weak and Pill bottle doesn't make him OP.
---
There is counters for most things. but a good Nurse is OP. A good Huntress can be countered a lot easier.
---
Streamer first and foremost. But like most popular streamers they have a youtube to cater to a larger fanbase. 
---
That sounds great, you dont really need selfcare when you can find help with bond. Like it. 
---
I don't know any of that but one side's dot was higher on a graph than the others so I'm gonna draw conclusions from it. 
---
Then you're lucky your teammates actually do gens in that time. Recently I've actually been bringing small game each match but my teammates maybe do 1 gen in the time that it takes and the killer has probably hooked at least one person already.
---
Unfortunately the tombstone piece causes Myers to lose his tier 3 after a mori. I believe there isn’t enough evil across the survivors to mori all of them, so you can’t use this build to get the achievement, but you could still use it to always be a threat if you want. 
---
ye...whatever, have heard about him, but never watched
---
Your literally just contradicted yourself but okay.
---
Is is that bad? I think I am very bad at looping so I avoid it. I am not helping my team a lot when I get hooked instantly. 
---
You either play on console, or you haven't played a Good Nurse...Period
---
Billy isn't OP, I agree that BBQ synergizes better on him than anyone and it can make for some chaotic matches, but I doubt most people hear the chainsaw in the opening seconds of the match and feel handicapped. 
---
I’m a fan of perks that let me see the killer periodically. It’s not a min max but I find it helps me with positioning so I won’t have to worry for a little bit. Dark sense I believe is the generator one?

Killer = 4 BBQ stacks 
---
Getting 4 bbq stacks as a killer :)
---
the only thing that makes me think "maybe it shouldnt be hidden" is noed, but that should just be nerfed
---
this change must be made.
---
Thanks!
---
2 seconds is not a cool down. We mean the power bar
---
Currently I don't have access toAftercare. I might consider bond though. Thanks man
---
Guess I misspoke. If you mean this:
---
&gt; I am only asking why people consider them to be OP.
---
I find it clear that I'm asking why the people who think killer are OP think so.
---
I thought a lot about it and, with the cosmetics store, I feel like its a big "meh." The only characters I might proceed are the licensed characters who don't have additional cosmetics. 
---
Survivor-Saving teammates and making sure they get out
---
Killer-At least 1 kill and Brutal Killer
---
Yeah and you're never going to get the ration *exactly* at 50/50, that's ridiculously unrealistic. 
---
Because its always a surprise when Myers has it, and its an insanely strong perk....I don't even run this but i thought this would be obvious...
---
I don't like it when people say controller so its harder i play on ps4 and its easy i think its just that the majority of the players are bad so most people would agree with you because there are more bad player than good players and you just fall in the category of bad players and i fall in the category of good players so i find it less difficult 
---
Nerf hag
---
To each their own. He's pretty decent and the stuff he puts on YouTube is never toxic and usually rank 1 play.
---
For me personally I don't like watching streamers/youtubers that aren't rank 1, since I won't really learn anything from them. Especially when they are consistently at purple ranks or just not consistently at red ranks. So some of the popular choices are instantly gone due to that fact. 
---
Exactly. I think the devs need to start shifting things towards skill gets rewarded not luck of the draw with blood webs.
---
Yeah, you are right, I don't really know how good this add-on is. It's pretty rare to play against and pretty funny, I must admit. The problem is that disconnecting players (on both sides) cause extreme frustration on my side =)
---
I suggest u get one then. Your art is rlly pretty and u have a talent so why not show it off. And i feel like more ppl would like to look at it, i sure would :)
---
I don't have bbq. Is getting 4 stacks tough?
---
You should bring up dead by daylight at work sometime casually and keep an eye out on the (subtle) reactions. I have a feeling you have a bunch of colleagues who take days off during the event and you get stuck with the post event era. Atleast a new event isnt that far off I think? Like isnt Lunar new year in a month or 2?
---
https://imgflip.com/i/2qdhfr
---
That's unrealistic lol. I play fair don't camp and even if a survivor gets unhooked in my face I go for the uninjured survivor. I still get dcs and hate msgs all the time lol. 
---
I would love extra bloodpoints
---
The most important statistic, to me, would be K/D ratio from matches where both sides rushed their primary objective. 
---
3k as killer, pip as a survivor. Idk how people consider a 2k a win.

---
For how easy it is to reach rank 1, i dont think thats worth it. I am still hoping for leaderboards though, that would be nice.
---
Basically. Ironically for a Killer who's entire power revolves around vaulting they're actually at their weakest when vaulting because you can't fucking see shit during the vault animation.
---
Cosmetics or bloodpoints would be nice.
---
For killer I classify a win as getting 3 kills. 4 is  just icing on the cake. but if I can get 3 kills; I consider that a win.
---
Nurse on console is hot garbage. In my experience the only way to beat a god tier nurse is with stealth. 
---
I think you can actually mori them all, just make sure you activate EW3 right before a certain kill, meaning not dealing with a chase first and then you drop to EW2 right under the EW3 limit, like a second or 2 stalking gets you back up to 3. Also make sure your first kill is the person you juiced up on to EW3 or they will be sucked dry.
---
Doesn't seem too much of an issue after the Tinkerer re-work, you can still use a Charge Bulb and a Tuning Guide but it's not quite the "insta saw" it used to be. 
---
I think we need separate statistic for each killer. It will add more clarity.

Can you clarify because I literally don't understand your point. 
---
&gt;No but you said everyone thinks so
---
About what?

&gt;Saying that everyone thinks something is just plain out wrong.
---
You're a hypocrite and about what?
---
To add onto what everyone else is saying: As a killer you have to expect survivors to be salty if you kill them. Play for your own fun and as long as you're not toxic and/or not cheating it is perfectly fine. Survivors tend to get mad at killers for not following their made up rules. Hell there are even survivors who will complain if you use a mori or noed, all while they run ds and use a farm map offering. People will complain, don't let it get to you. 
---
&gt;When people ask me how I got to Rank 1

Uhhh I kinda just held Mouse 1 on Generators.

Killer- not getting bum rushed. Having at least one moment where I laugh. Not being disappointed with my rating. Making the entity at least feel like I'm somewhat competent.
---
Survivor- throw all that out the window. Simply escaping is a win.
---
Nah i gen rushed the nano second i figured it out
---
Didn't they? I could have sworn that I saw even Freddy with more than a 50% kill rate. 
---
Get all the perks and teachable you want and then prestige someone. So you can keep playing with success to save up the points. I’m currently doing this with a survivor. 
---
It will give you the Skill Checks no mater what.
---
As soon as you touch a gen that has been applied overcharge you will be presented with the skill check. There is no getting around it. 
---
There should so many other things different too.
---
The killer shouldn't be able to see the 4 survivors at all before the match. He shouldn't been able to see if 4 man comes together into the lobby or separate (this would reduces quitting killer in a lobby a lot!) And he shouldn't been able to see which item they have.
---
&gt;I'm going to have sexual thoughts about this later.
---
Will blow up straight away. The instant you touch it, the skill check starts. 
---
I mean David has WGLF by default so...
---
Hexagon should've been Ruin.
---
&gt;I think a few survivors are starting to come across the Legions who have worked it out and they can feel really unfun to play against because they neccesitate the gen rush or they   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;will  
---
&gt; kill you.
---
I agree with this a lot.  I main Legion when I play killer, and I have to admit he has a steep learning curve.  But if you learn how to manage gens and your time you can easily come out of the match with at least 2 kills against competent survivors.  I still occasionally lose with 0k but not as much when I first picked him up.
---
As a survivor, not losing skill checks
---
As a killer, not being the one with less BP in the match
---
The skill check starts and it comes with you even when off the generator. Whats also funny about it is that when you fail it the explosion happens on you (this could be patched though haven’t seen overcharge in a while)
---
Michael hits like a truck since he can insta down people in T3, but his weakness is he doesn't give much map pressure because in spite of insta downing people, he is a normal speed M1 killer. NOED helps cover for his weakness from the survivors usually being able to reach endgame if they play competently against him by giving him the speed boost he needs to catch people. At least that is my reasoning, it isn't for the instant down since he has it in his kit, it is for the speed boost that helps you land your attacks when you need to.
---
Empathy all the way.
---
Killers are OP, because they can hit past windows and pallets &amp; that was before they nerfed fast vaults.  I've actually gotten easy kills this way. They can see where all gens are at all times. They have a much more generous margin for error. Even losing all 4 will still make great bloodpoints. Survivors get 3 perks while killers essentially get 3 perks plus a super perk.
---
This sub will probably downvote me and call me a whiny survivor noob, and that's ok because I don't expect anything better. My experience supports my opinion. 2 of 10 times I'll escape,  and 8 of 10 times I can get 4k, even with 1 perk killers. 
---
Viewing popular streamers supports my opinion. I actually counted out survival rates and was mocked as not having a good enough sample size. 
---
Lo and fucking behold, the last released official escape rates from across all platforms supports my opinion. The devs have the data that killers succeed way more.
---
M1 is easier than a chainsaw. You can M1 in tight spaces and at sudden vaults.
---
Besides, why have 1 insta down when you can have 2?
---
I'm a big fan of Moniter and Abuse, No one escapes death, Ruin and BBQ. Or could go with a low heals build. Sloppy Butcher, Clourphobia or however you spell it. Dying light and Thantaphobia. 
---
I do the same thing. Get a hit off before the sprint burst into oblivion 
---
Hahaha I lost it at the “I CAN DANCE ALL DAY I CAN DANCE ALL DAY!!”
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/dbdLFG/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbdLFG/)
---
I like walking backwards into survivors hiding in corners as to seem like i didn't see them then just turn around slowly and stand for a good five seconds till i hit them.
---
TBF, if they did this, it would probably make all of the pallets disappear on the maps.  This game code keeps getting opened at a programmer's home and their cat walks across the keyboard while they get coffee.
---
There has been no word on it since. I get that licensing is a long process but can it really be this long? I'm guessing it's just not happening.
---
We can all be quick learners at something others find difficult. That doesn't make you godlike and everyone else shit. 
---
Yeah that's why I said on pc. 
---
Basically play for the hatch, because once a god tier nurse has momentum it's a pretty easy 4k if she decides to slug, even worse if she has a slugging build. But I wouldn't really count a hatch escape as beating the nurse. 
---
I think too many get stuck on either tunneling one player or trying to hit all of them. The ability to judge whether switching targets is worth doing is key. That and when to DW and break chase and when to drop frenzy for the normal hit to down them.
---
Too bad it clips into her head so damn much.
---
I’m pretty sure last time it was mentioned was during Spirit PTB Q&amp;As
---
Power Bar? That has nothing to do with a cool down, that's an ability timer. Legion and Spirit have a time limit on their abilities to make them balanced as their abilities are easily controllable. Hillbilly takes good maneuvering and timing to use his power, thus it's unlimited. 
---
PS: If 2 seconds isn't long enough for you, all I can say is "get good." 
---
Fuck this makes me want to play Bill.
---
Good gameplay is entertainment..? They’re just different forms. Says a little about one’s character 
---
Brand new part sucks. Seriously, I would rather take ANY speed add on over it. It is just bad after it got nerfed into the ground. 
---
Camping is an iron lung in that case
---
They did on one of the streams. I am at work and cant load twitch right now.
---
Thank you
---
I’m happy to be on vacation during my holiday break, but sad that I missed all my games’ events 
---
A moment of silence for the console users out there.

Nani

Let’s get this bread.
---
As do I.
---
This brings shame to Pigs everywhere. 
---
There are 2 ways to play killer  
---
Toxic killer perks = get flamed and called noob
---
Non Toxic Killer perks = get EZed
---
I hate campers more than anything, sure if you sit there for like 10 seconds than thats fine but any longer your being an asshole
---
The data that wouldn't be trash would be those numbers with a sample size, date range that it was pulled from, controlled for survivor disconnects, suicide-on-hooks, and disregard kills/deaths taken from events. Even better(but unrealistic), it would be pulled from matches where both sides rushed their primary objective. 
---
[deleted]
---
Fuck off. You know damn well if Billy was made today he would have a power bar cooldown 
---
The power of killers is based on the rank of the survivors and the killers. In the early game when people are still new and learning the mechanics, killers definitely have the advantage. This is simply because it is pretty easy to catch a survivor if they don't know the tricks and mechanics built into the game to allow them to escape from a killer or to delay being caught for a long period of time, and they haven't learned how to quickly, and efficiently finish repairing the generators.
---
This means that killers win a lot of games early on, and escaping is fairly rare. It leaves the impression that killers are overpowered even though it is simply the result of lack of understanding of mechanics. Killers move faster, can attack through pallets and windows if you time it right, have more powerful perks and worst of all, have the dreaded mori offering. All these reasons make a pretty good argument that killers are more powerful.
---
Problem with these arguments is they don't take the full context of the game into account. Survivors lost a lot of games individually by dying, but as a team, survivors have a very high success rate. When you consider perks, individually the killer's perks are more impactful, but the killer has 4 perks while survivors collectively have 16 on their team, and up to 4 offerings which can reduce the number of hooks or make the survivors harder to see, or give more chests to get good items and many other benefits for survivors. In addition, once you are more skilled, you learn to loop, flash save, utilize perks to escape or extend the chase and shorten the amount of time a killer has in the game by doing generators faster. There is a point in the game where the balance shifts and the survivors are the ones who have the power role. Killers catching them becomes reliant on survivors failing to use their escape mechanics effectively rather than based on the killer's inherent advantage in a chase from their greater speed.
---
In short, the killer is more powerful than any individual survivor. This leads to the perception that the killer is overpowered because most survivors don't think about the full context of it not being the killer against 4 individuals but the killer against a team of 4 people. If the killer is able to catch you personally and it doesn't feel like you could have done anything (even if objectively, you probably could have), it will feel like they are overpowered.
---
The issue is if you combo that with waterlogged shoe, she turns into a 115% M1 killer who can preset blocks in the path.
---
And an always kept Mint Rag would literally be cancer if the hag ran the Devour-Ruin-Thrill build, where she has so much power and dominance due to those 3 together, and the fact that people can't stealth past the traps to get the totems because she can just teleport to the trap regardless of it being triggered.
---
Yes same
---
&gt;Dance With Me + Quick and Quiet is a combo suggested by HybridPanda, iirc, which lets you silently jump a window and not leave scratchies.
---
This, I use this on my ninja build because it allows me to disappear.  At it synergizes a bit with lightweight, and hopefully gives you  enough room to lose the killer due to them completely losing your tracks. 
---
I'm sort of new to the mindset of survivors since I always play with friends, so I didn't really expect that survivors had their own rules and was bothered by their salt. Glad to know that I'm not low-key cheating. I'll keep this in mind, thanks for the advice
---
You have been downvoted and reported for unfunny and inappropriate comments. Sir, please refrain from doing this in the future.
---
When you are so stupid and completly mentaly crippeld, that you dont do gens WHEN the Killer facecampes, then i am happy that they never play again.
---
Nice that this stupidity sort itself out ! 
---
As a killer:
---
1 Kill or less - loss
---
2 Kills - tie
---
3 Kills or more - win
---
4 Kills with 5 gens left - kneel before your master
---
As a survivor, a win for me is if I escape or if I did enough to allow others to escape. 
---
I won't down vote my dude. It is your opinion and I think that it is wrong.
---
&gt; Viewing popular streamers supports my opinion.
---
This doesn't make any sense. Just cause a streamer says something doesn't mean it is correct. The devs balance the game as 2 deaths 2 escapes. This doesn't mean it has to be 50/50,m which is almost impossible. I believe the escape rates for survivor 30-40% (correct me if I'm wrong). And this is pretty close to 50/50. If killer would have been OP I believe the rates would look different. Plus the escape rates doesn't take into consideration A: The killer B: The skill of the killer/survivor C: Perks D: Add-ons. It only counts escapes. 
---
&gt; They can hit past windows and occasionally pallets &amp; that was before BHVR nerfed fast vaults. I've actually gotten easy kills this way.
---
This can have with latency issues but also just poor timing.
---
&gt; They can see where all gens are at all times.
---
Well the killers job is to make sure survivors do not do the gens. By that I guess we can remove the exit gates being revealed to survivors, same with dying survivors.
---
&gt; Even losing all 4 will still make great bloodpoints. 
---
This does not make killer OP
---
&gt; They have a much more generous margin for error.
---
This depends on he killer. Nurse and huntress can bounce back. A bad teleport by the Hag can cost a a lot.
---
Just the painful truth. Luckily sometimes it works out. I had a Hag game the other day. No noed, no NC, no blood warden, no overcharge, no devour hope (because it was broken before I even got one point), no BBQ. Nothing. Got a 4k. Somehow got the last person even when we were chilling around the hatch. It was perfection and I got Adept Hag from it.
---
Is that Legion slightly handicapped?
---
Ok sense you deleted your comment on my post it kinda annoys me that i could not answer it their i was showing how many pips i had and i was level 28 at the time devotion 0 
---
I've noticed Legion tends to vault further through windows and pallets leading to loss of vision like this. Like, if you vault the harvester on Coldwind farm maps you'll fall down from the hay bale.
---
Thank you. 
---
If the killer is playing the nurse, the killer. If they are playing literally any other killer, then the survivors have the advantage.
---
A DC or a suicide is still a kill. You just can't disregard it because you don't like what it implies about killer success.
---
Good 
---
And miss
---
I want more of this 
---
I had a similar experience with an insidious leatherface. His very fitting name was "ruin security".
---
When I learned to play drums, I got the hang of it pretty quickly. I was able to learn a lot faster than most other students. This does not mean that everyone else who plays the drums is garbage and I'm the only one who's skilled. 
---
You are just up your own ass. 
---
Exactly. The floor is higher for killer gameplay, they're going to outperform your expectations in matches where both sides are inexperienced. But the skill ceiling is lower, so if you're able to eclipse, competitively, most similarly skilled killers after a while.  
---
A lot of people have decided to just play survivor due to the killer lobby times being atrocious. I would recommend that you do the same, unless you don't mind the 20+ minute waiting times. 
---
HMU brother, my psn is: SaladQueenVII

Jeff
---
Wow, why the hostility? 
---
I've heard that it's hard sometimes to find Killer games at White Rank.
---
Yeah that's why I said play stealthy. 
---
Basically don't be seen, because once a god tier nurse sees you, you go down. It's pretty easy to urban evade away from a generator you are working on and stay out of the nurses line of sight. But I really count any escape as an escape. Gg (;
---
&gt; outlast the tier three

Until they realize he is running Tuft of hair, thats how you know you are fucked

Lol that’s me when I see coldwind farm picked as an offering

Hex: This

i’m sure everyone else had as much fun as you did
---
It's a nickname so you can say it faster. Kinda how in CSGO everyone says A or B not "campsite A" or mid not middle. Relax. 
---
&gt;Trust me, no "godly" nurse Player will Fall for such a simple trick
---
Just because you can't do it doesn't mean it can't be done. I've done it before to sub rank 5s on PC. They can't undo the teleport distance because it is always increasing. Use that to your advantage.
---
Well, uncomfortable for starters 
---
If you’re new at the game it’s less stupidity and more ignorance. I want them to keep playing and figure out how to punish a killer for faecamping
---
It’s high rank survivors that don’t do gens that get me, they should know better
---
Chase music won't start u less you start running so your describing a bug.
---
&gt;Hex: This
---
&gt;&gt; Whenever a survivor does the pointing action, the aura of the nearest 1/2/3 interactable object(s) is visible for 3/5/8 seconds
---
No, u
---
Platform: Ps4
---
Type of bug: Ingame
---
- Unable to mend after getting hit by fetal frenzy.  - The game wont load in after the initial cutscene showing the name of the map. 
---
- Skillchecks just randomly stop popping up but I still get sound and of course unable to do gens or heal.
---
One of my favourite builds to run is the common Myers with Scratched Mirror and Monitor &amp; Abuse combo. That shit is super fun, thought only really on Lery's.
---
Yup, better get over it as fast as possible because you may not get another chance until the gates are open and the downed obsession is near them
---
She would not be welcome in my basement. 
---
Even if you kill right away with the Tombstone Piece, it resets back the same amount of evil. With any addon that requires more, going back to EW2 only requires you get the normal amount of evil to get to EW3 again, so the bar will be partially filled still. True story with killing the right person though, I wish it worked like DCs and the evil you don't use is distributed across the rest of the survivors. Too often someone feeds him and then disappears for the rest of the match, which works great for survivors sometimes.
---
I am p3 Claudette, so got one thing going for me 
---
I mean it's extremely obvious that you just urban evaded away from a gen if there are no scratch marks near a gen that was recently worked on. So it doesn't really work that well, especially against nurse who can show up out of nowhere. Also if needed the nurse can just teleport around obstacles (such as walls) to catch you waiting outside of her fov. 
---
But yeah I guess if you count hatch escapes as beating the killer then that's up to you. As long as you enjoy the match as much as possible either way. 
---
He took someone else's meme. ERASED part of it, and put someone else, and then said look at this awesome post. I made this all by myself. Give me karma.
---
Reposting a meme for karma is fine. Happens all the time. Don't claim it's yours. That's just scummy. Regardless of what it is. That's like putting a watermark on someone else's picture and saying it's different now. Its mine. 
---
That's from my experience with the player I have encountered. You are saying that everyone who is not a new player doesn't think killer are OP. TBH I'm not sure why we are arguing, we both agree that killers are not OP.
---
It was a good match, there was 1 generator left, they almost had it, no toxic survivors, they didn't sandbag each other. I didn't camp or tunnel, no salt at the end. One of the best experiences I've had on this game. 
---
They’re all good, the only one I’m kind of meh on is urban just because of my play style. But it’s still good
---
All of the perks that you named have their own benefit gameplay wise. I like all of them and use and combo of the three sometimes ( leader, bond, and urban evasion). 
---
survivor: being able to fuck around without getting tunneled or camped.
---
killer: 4 BBQ stacks
---
i’ve never tried monitor and abuse but i keep hearing about it! and of course ruin is a staple, especially in high ranks. i wish it wasn’t but the gens pop like popcorn if you don’t have it. i love sloppy butcher but t gives them more time to get out of the dream with self care :/ what add ons do you use?
---
Not too hard to go "Gen Trio by gas station!" Or "Looping around the boat!" Though.
---
I mean, aidentity V has built in chats that real the chatter to allies
---
really? I have a 1070 ti, that's very strange that you're having less issues than I am. Maybe I need to do some general pc maintenance then, since its most likely part of a bigger issue.
---
I'm guilty of this same thing and I agree they should be hidden.
---
It might seem like it is extremely obvious that we shouldn't be able to share the killer perks with our team by reading the post-game screen. It might seem like only horrible toxic survivors would ever think otherwise. Yet this is exactly the issue that caused an argument between myself and StreamDad, the absolute chillest streamer for this game, around six months ago.
---
Maybe he's changed his stance on it since then, but at the time he openly stated that anybody who said that letting the team know about Blood Warden is unfair must be trying to troll his stream. That's why I don't participate in his games anymore, which is too bad because I enjoyed it.
---
So it seems like, yeah, this should be obvious, but apparently there are otherwise reasonable people who think that it is obvious that this is completely fine.
---
In his defence, I wouldn’t expect someone living in the woods to have much fashion sense
---
I just realized, that the thing is, when you look at any meme image it doesn’t immediatley conjure DBD but that’s why people essentially argue the connection usually in a clever way by adding text or images from the game, but most memes won’t immediately hit you like you’re asking, that’s because the DBD connection is often the punchline in memes and not the other way around...
---
Franklins, Mad Grit, Discordance, and another perk of your choice. I suggest not running hex totems since they can communicate with each other on where they are. Something like sloppy butcher is pretty useful, but isn't the only option.
---
For toxic 4-man swf as much as I hate to say it, you gotta play on their level. If they're just waiting for you to leave the hook don't leave, *find them first*. Hit one survivor and then check on the hook again to see if another has come in for the save. Force them into a vulnerable situation.
---
Of course 4-man is the worst and super hard to counter, but I've successfully killed members of such groups without resorting to face camping. I wish you the best of luck
---
Probably, remember that leveling up gives you a fair amount of shards
---
&gt;lmao, you were below rank 5? man, you're a real Gamer!
---
low effort trolling. If you don't like the thread, keep on scrolling.
---
&gt;you must abbreviate words exactly like I do
---
K
---
Immersed players are bad for other team mates. If say I get hooked and the killer sees you on BBQ and heads in your direction, and your only skill is being able to hide from them. Then the killer has a lot higher chance of going back to the hook and tunneling. Imo either take the aggro or take the hits, as it's your turn. 
---
No i’m talking about leader but in general yeah you dont really need it in swf I guess since you can just coordinate locations. 
---
3K or at least a 'Ruthless Killer' screen. 
---
possible? yes. Fun? probably not.     You want to focus on quick games as after a certain point, you stop/slow down the amount of shards you earn each game.   Survivor probably best to use outside of the daily bonus for surv/killer game.  
---
They could add a new add on, maybe for the flashlight, that increases some of its stats pretty significantly. Maybe they could call it the "strange light"
---
I'm of the opinion that using voice chat at all is tantamount to cheating. It is using third party software to give yourself an in game advantage. It might not be as egregious as using a cheat engine to give yourself speed hacks or such, but it is the same offense. But it is only natural people do it, it is more fun to be able to talk to your friends as you play with them.
---
I see, thanks for clarifying that. I just remembered that I wouldnt be that far from EW3 after killing with the tombstone piece. I had to resort to the piece since every other tombstone game either gets dcs after the first kill or people didnt load in from the start, which was a huge problem awhile ago. So I wasted every tombstone and blackward until only the pieces were left. Thanks again for the info, I like to get my facts straight :)
---
P3 Claudette hard to see. 
---
What level are you? 
---
&gt; Blood Warden is something that is kind of pointless to know ahead of time, as you'll find out and have to leave the exit gates anyway
---
If you know they have Blood Warden, you won't go to the exit gates until it expires.
---
Like the Gru meme. Clearly people don’t immediately think DBD when they see Gru and his speech board, they think oh it’s Despicable Me and then they read the text and they’re like, oh I get it, they’re using it to comment on Dead by Daylight.
---
Just keep practicing. Everyone fails a lot. The game is based around split second decisions. 
---
Just practice. Dont worry about "winning" aka escaping, more focus on getting better and understanding looping and tile placements
---
When you are legion but still get looped
---
(23 would've been a good number for a Varg reference lol)
---
Pfft, you clearly haven't seen the "Off-The-Grid" catalog for 2019. So chic and modern. It says "hey, I'm not giving you any of my personal information 'mister census man'!" all while being practical and slimming.
---
Sure, I am just saying that there is skill to the voice comms to be able to relay information effectively. I still call it cheating to use third party software to give yourself an in game advantage, but it does take some practice to be able to effectively describe your location in maps which might not have a lot of landmarks.
---
^ This is the sort of thing I am talking about in another comment where I say that balance discussion on this subreddit has been compromised by team bias. Maybe killers no longer being able to see items is a fine idea. But if that is the case, it should be its own thread. Instead, it's coming across as a negotiation - "We'll give up our power to read off your perks in SWF if you give up your power to see our items in the lobby". That might not be what was intended with this comment, but other commenters are latching onto it and directing the focus there, and there are arguments in this chain about whether or not it is a fair trade-off.
---
All you did was list a few positives of killers. All your experience proves is that you suck with survivor and youre good at killer. Killers only succeed more because most of the playerbase is in the lower ranks. At higher ranks if you have a perfectly played killer and perfectly played survivors, the killer will always lose unless its nurse. You rely on the survivors making mistakes. Shitty players make tons of mistakes and killers are op in lower ranks but if they dont mistakes its out of your control. Playing survivor is so damn chill, while killers basically have a timer on their heads and have to make so many decisions minute by minute
---
Totems don't just spawn at your feet. They take 10 seconds to cleanse, but potentially orders of magnitude longer to find.
---
Nurse is by far the best killer in the game, the tactics you described work on trash nurses. 
---
imagine falling for the pallet mindgame after the vault distance change for feral frenzy. rank 21 confirmed
---
That's assuming they are good,  which swf's often aren't. 
---
Why not both?
---
mexicangirlhealdupbytown.jpg
---
Plot twist of the year
---
Thats like saying master yi in league of legends or noobstompers in other games are op. Most of the playerbase isnt high rank so ofc these characters do well in the stats. But obviously theyre not OP. Against good survivors killers are totally at their mercy
---
It still doesn’t do enough to justify bringing it over Ruin.
---
Yeah, the other guy made me aware of it. I’ve never been on the business end of that, but it doesn’t sound fun. 
---
And as soon as you see the blood warden activate, you're gonna leave the gates and hide somewhere anyway. You're only gonna sit in the gates with blood warden active if you don't know what it does to begin with, in which case it doesn't matter if you know ahead of time anyway
---
He didn't bm him... The killer is just so bad he quit.
---
You think it’s bad now? Once you hit the high ranks (12-1) lobby’s take 20-30 minutes each 
---
No dude im the best i can name all the games im good at ive never lost 
---
I didn't listen to a streamer, I compiled stats on a stream on that went on for hours counting survivors that made out out when he was alternating between killer and survivor. 
---
On the windows, I mean I actually hit someone who had finished vaulting a window and was t-bagging me on the other side, in lots of games. 
---
On the gens and exit gates, I'd be ok with removing anyone seeing auras without perks, as long as that counts for killer not seeing exit gate either.
---
If the killer needs to put in way less effort to achieve the same or more bloodpoints than escaping survivors, I would call that OP. We can disagree on that. 
---
It doesn’t prove you’re right, it proves you’re a dick. If I said, “All of you suck and I’m better than you,” and got downvoted, it just proves I’m an asshole, not that I’m right. That’s what you did here. 
---
Didn't wanna give him a chance, huh?
---
Probably ruin
---
Really Looks like it could be the company's art
---
Using light mode and upvoting ads? What kinda sick freak does such a thing?
---
130
---
Legion's a weird one (and IMO they need a complete rework), the chases take long but if you're vs a decent killer there's pretty much nothing you can do vs frenzy.
---
14 xp give you about 1 shard. So you need 17500 xp (plus maybe some more to get to next player level to collect the last shards). 
---
A „typically“ long game gives you about 530-550 xp I think (hope I remember this correctly)??? The first survivor/killer game of the day gives you a 300 xp bonus. For four days that‘d be 2400 bonus if you play both roles. So you need to play for ~15100 xp. That might be about 29-30 games (if they are long enough to give you max xp), so about 7-8 matches per day. 
---
That's why I bought Jeff first but I still want the perk. I think it can make for some really clutch plays.  
---
Lmao i need to try this

The issue in the lore the two unseen survivors say that people communicate and in a situation like this you wouldnt do a gen in utter silence last there is no way to fix the communication issue sorry to burst your bubble

Im working hard for that shit rn, ive never really had the urge to level my laurie for ds, but I know I need this

Take my +1 strictly for the fraj reference 💙💙💙
---
It will take you 6 levels. 25-34 is, on average, 51 games, so 30-36 is probably somewhere like 40 games ish
---
&gt;Rage quitting in high numbers is inherently symptomatic of bad gameplay mechanics.
---
You can speculate as much as you want, people quit for all sorts of reasons. From mechanics they don't like, to being a sore loser, to getting frustrated at teammates, to getting downed too quickly, to not liking the map or killer, to missing Decisive Strike, etc. My point is that for the purposes of balancing game mechanics, you need to assume that all players are playing the game and trying to win, it doesn't make sense nerf this killer or nerf that mechanic just because a survivor might quit the match. 
---
I pulled 3 friends into SWF who had never played before during a free weekend. Our first match was against a tombstone myers, the second was an iridescent heads huntress with an ebony mori, and none of them played again after that.
---
sharting while farting?

That's what I'm saying, thank you. Like okay sure, run it without experience, but if you are like better than rank 10? C'mon, step your game up

*Laughs in Borrowed Time*
---
I need more of this
---
When the killer doesn't give each survivor a turn on the hook, and instead rushes the objective. They'll usually target the weak/unhooked player to thin the survivor's numbers quicker. 
---
As a killer I always just hit them. I don’t mind the last one escaping out the hatch (no matter the scenario). 
---
I liked dwights better (Bill will make it)
---
tunneling is going after one survivor and ignoring everyone else 
---
Atleat they get his teachables as baseperks. We only get and old man we have to level.
---
It should be a lag issue
---
i call pipping a win mainly because i dont play too often so i need to stay around rank 10 so i dont get the fresh noobs
---
Yes, I already said they're rushing the objective. Sometimes it backfires, but that's not really the point.

Hex: Bill Of The Hunt.

*Platform*: All (I have seen people report this for PS4 and Xbox One, but I personally have encountered it on PC)
---
*Type of bug*: Visual, perk related (Sloppy Butcher), killer related (The Wraith)
---
*Description*: Sloppy Butcher (perk) is bugged when used by The Wraith in particular. When The Wraith hits a survivor, the visual blood effect that normally shows up (and disappears after a second or two) continues to play throughout the entire match. Healing, getting unhooked, or doing any other actions in the game do not make the effect go away. Every time The Wraith hits a survivor, there is another blood effect added on top of the already existing effect - causing a massive drop in FPS for everyone involved. The longer the match lasts, the more the framerate drops. I've had multiple games so far that crashed my game due to the amount of lag the blood effect was causing. All my friends, people in lobby and killer reported seeing the same thing in multiple matches.
---
*Steps to reproduce*: Have The Wraith as a Killer with the Sloppy Butcher perk. Hit a survivor.
---
*Expected result*: Upon hitting the survivor, the spraying blood effect will play. It will not disappear after a few seconds or upon being healed, as is normal. Upon hitting the survivor again, the blood effect will stack and reduce FPS.
---
*Reproduction rate*: 100%
---
I'd rather see it covered in oil, butter, and grease instead. Because "ice-skate survivors" is probably my favorite bug I've ever seen in the game and should just be permanent.
---
And my axe.

Legion is shit
---
There wasn't even any use of bm here other than stuff made in post edit which is rightfully deserved if you're going to purposefully disconnect as the killer or even as a survivor.
---
If he's getting looped over and over and over again there is legitimately 3 other survivors in the match to chase and he simply refuses to because he wanted to tunnel. I hate comments like this because it teaches people to refuse to acknowledge the difference between being toxic/bm and just being good/bad at the game.

Sorry for the bad gameplay im new to the game.

LOL, skill is the whole reason why certain Killer's have limited power usage and others don't. Simple stuff my guy.

---
I just left immediately to be honest cause I've got no nerves for an SWF squad.
---
I like this idea! Quentin could be elastic string? The kind you wear around your wrist and snap to stay awake. 
---
A good definition of actual tunneling is going out of your way (almost to the point of throwing the game) to kill one person. 
---
That exactly how I picture Dwight's brain
---
Lets hope this one is better than last years lunar event. DC galore
---
This is incredible thank you for sharing
---
You realize how unimpressive Rank 5 is tho
---
I’m just surprised at how little common sense there is. Waiting until second state to save a wide open hooked survivor. Being injured, chased and unhooking without BT at the beginning of a game. Not doing gens. Suiciding on the hook. Getting downed within seconds of being found at full health. These guys are next level bad game after game. At least do something!
---
Agreeeeee! I think it should all be hidden until everyone's out of the game. No reason to be able to see before the game is over anyway IMO.
---
Hey i am glad we get to play as a badass war and apocalypse veteran that can kick most killers' asses if entity permitted to.
---
Same, mostly David's. But, the most memorable was a FUCKING BILL with NO BORROWED TIME. WTF BILL. WHO PLAYS BILL WITH NO BT AND AND SAVES RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE NURSE WITH A MORI AND DYING LIGHT. YOU ASS BILL. /rant. 
---
In a week of what? 
---
So I got this game 8 days ago and I’ve been in love with it, I was wondering if getting to rank 1 on a killer is considered easy now? This is on Xbox.
---
Small Game; since all killers like to run NOED and Ruin in their builds why not spend the first minute of the game cleansing all the totems? 
---
Stealing that
---
I bought the game last week.
---
You seem to be assuming that a killer with Blood Warden couldn't possibly get to the exit gates before you have time to get away, which doesn't seem like a valid assumption to me.
---
Yea and it also gives the killer a free kill and makes free some hilarious fails.
---
Everyone kind of has a different line for what constitutes tunneling. But tuneling is a lot like genrushing in that it isn't really any kind of bad practice, it is just something which makes you ore likely to win and survivors hate losing. It is the nature of players in this game to basically accuse you of playing illegitimately for some reason whenever they lose. Tunneling is just the default reason when they don't have a better one. Unless you have hooked the same person three times consecutively, you probably aren't tunneling in my eyes though.
---
The perk you're thinking of is Unbreakable. 😉
---
Agreed. The best part? I pretty much sill always pip and even double pip quite a lot. I make more points playing the way I do than I ever have playing any other way. Even when I frequently let at least one person go most matches. That should say something. I also love seeing survivors do things like that. I mean, if NOLB was stronger I would run it. If I know I'm going to at least pip no matter what, I'll go to at least attempt the save. Even if it costs me my life. You never know, that person could potentially derank without that save. That's my thought process on it at least. 
---
You don't always need a 4K to get points and pip.
---
You don't always need to escape/live to pip. 
---
If more people realized this games would be better. 
---
I simply answered your question kind sir. 
---
I'm sure there is someone who knows what goes into the game and what doesn't, including both skins and balance changes, I don't think the balance team is allowed to change whatever they want to change, I don't work in a game development team, but that's a bit more than obvious.
---
I got the game on black friday 2018 and im already 130 hours 😭😭😭

But that still has nothing to do with a new cosmetic for one of the licensed killers so idk what this guy was on about

Odd Bulb already exists as a pink item, I simple forgot about it. Still, it increases battery consumption. I’d prefer a pink battery with a ton of extra time myself. 
---
You're fun at parties
---
...You could make that argument for literally any game that involves teamwork.
---
Yes it’s absurdly easy to reach rank 1. Especially on killer. It’s sad when you have to actively try not to double pip so you don’t rank up too fast on killer and have lobby times take longer.
---
Don't survivors automatically get the 5k surviving points?

I could be wrong don't play much survivor.

When you do a generator don’t hide, just walk away. Don’t run. Most killers who know what they’re doing aren’t gonna check the gen unless their already close by because they know you’ll be long gone by the time you get there. 
---
No idea. I don't know what you could do to balance it out. Even if you made universal voice comms a feature of the game, you would probably have about 25% of players using it. Those 25% would have a ridiculous advantage jus because voice comms, even if you aren't great at them, still give coordination enough to counter any ambush strategy by a killer and reveal the location of the killer. Any buff they give to the killer to balance out the voice comm feature would just imbalance the majority of games where survivors don't use voice comms. The way I see it, they don't use voice comms for a reason, both balance wise, and for in world consistency. You can tell from the in game mechanics that the killers all have exceptional hearing and can pinpoint the source of sounds. The fast vault isn't all that loud but the killer can pinpoint the location of the clack on the wall from a very big distance away. The logical conclusion from survivors would be don't say a word, don't make a sound.
---
Thanks for the reply, I was thinking it was levelling up too quick, I feel as though I should be in rank 10 or so while I’m still learning characters. Thanks for the lobby time info I didn’t know that.
---
And that's a separate issue. Start a thread, my friend! :)
---
Yeah, honestly it is. Console players suck. (as do most PC players but damn) Not that rank 1 players aint better than rank 8-10, but honestly they still make a shitton of mistakes and are so punisheable.
---
Still, r1 in 8 days is still good.
---
But of course :)
---
How about no. 
---
LOL....funny and true!
---
Dwight shares my fear
---
It’s really not though, aside from the fact the killer has a clear advantage in finding it first, all it would lead to is killers then complaining that the survivor is taking too long to do gens and hiding too much. If all the killer has to do is gen patrol, many will feel like their best option is to just hide to the point the killer gets tired of it and stops patrolling. I THINK that’s the reason they never went through with it after testing (I could be wrong)
---
It was late af on PS4 but it was on coldwind farm
---
no problemino
---
If you want to remove a perk for wasting 15 seconds at most of a game, then why don't we remove noed? Why don't we remove blood warden? Why don't we remove ruin? Get better at the game and stop being so annoyed at one perk because you aren't good enough to catch survivors. I play both sides and never run ds on survivor because it is completely useless unless I'm against a killer that is easy to juke.
---
My point is: stop crying about a perk. It isn't that good to begin with and every perk, whether it be on survivor or killer side, is beatable. Surprise surprise! Perks are there to help make the game easier.
---
Oh thanks, had no idea.
---
If it wasn’t broken, maybe
---
I hate this survivors who do this so much. 
---
I was playing as Legion in the Asylum yesterday where a Jake tried to do this. 
---
I had already hooked him once when I saw him the second time. It was kinda confusing, because he wasn't near any generators, and I didn't have any hex totems up. Then I saw the hatch, and I knew he was one of "those" players. I hooked him a second time, and went on to do my stuff. 
---
They had one generator left, with him and one other survivor alive. I found the other survivor, downed them, and thought, "Surely he isn't camping that hatch. This survivor still has one more hook to go." So I left that survivor on the ground, and sure enough, found Jake hiding by the hatch. 
---
Jake got his hook, and his teammate got the hatch. 
---
What do you mean gives a free kill?
---
I'm a Rank 1 Killer and don't need NOED.
---
I have ADD so when I used to run ds, the killer spinning or hitting something always threw my concentration off and I’d miss the skillcheck 9/10 times 
---
I have a problem where i want to let them go but they don't even find the hatch. So i leave and go in a corner, and then in after game chat they are boasting about how cool they are at finding the hatch. Its annoying
---
It's so predictable. 
---
I’ll stop tbagging and emoting when killers stop facecamping 
---
I actually do run both on my meg, but only because she was the first survivor I had leveled and I had a very poor choice of perks.
---
For her it's premonition, spinechil, sprintburst, and plunderers instinct.
---
I had no access to things like selfcare, decisive, urban evasion etc. so that was the best I could do :/
---
But you've invested so much of your time to get him it's like losing progress for me. If I'm already at a lengthy time dammit I'm gonna find ish what I started.
---
honestly in most games Claudettes are usually the worst survivors.  Not even toxic or skilled, just dead weight.
---
myers t3 its op
---
You have been downvoted for inappropriate and unfunny comments. Sir, please refrain from doing this in the future.
---
He answered your question that is what teabagging is. In the context of a video game its using repeatitive squat or crouch actions to simulate this act. Effectively communicating that someone can or should suck your nuts. Sir.
---
Meh, it can be countered after the first use. I find Lithe to be the best with balanced landing in second. Dead hard is better than sprint burst though.
---
I wish more Freddy’s operated this way. The worst part about my game with him yesterday was he did have dying light but tunneled every other survivor and saved me for last lol I was so confused
---
Is this a subtle nod to starcraft? Because if it is i applaud you :)
---
I can understand feng deciding minecraft because she's an e-sports gamer, but why did Meg and David pick it? 
---
This kind of stuff ruined my chances of getting my friends to buy the game after Steam's "free weekend" ended.   
---
They felt like there was no chance of winning as a survivor. I kept trying to explain that COD and all those new shooters have ruined their urge to get good at games because they expect to win early and often, like they do in those games. They just needed to keep at it, but they refused. 
---
This is a great idea and will make the game bearable. Pretty much everyone I find that goes down first disconnects, which makes the game near on impossible.
---
It's just a real shame that the devs despise survivor mains and want them to suffer.
---
If your will to live is truly gone play survivor, someone will come along to help you with that.
---
rubbing my belly and patting my head is a real challenge
---
Second this!!
---
How do I gild someone on Instagram?
---
That may be true but at close range if the nurse is bad then it gives them that 3rd chance which can make a big difference. 
---
I don't understand how "gen rushing" and tunneling are comparable. One is survivors actually doing their objective, the other is purposely being a douche. 
---
Are survivors just supposed to be like "hol up my boy killer over here ain't got a single hook and we've done 4 gens, guess we should let him catch up!"?
---
If the killer doesn't know how to successfully patrol the generators and deny survivors a free gen, then that's your fault. How could it ever be the survivors'?
---
Now going after the survivor who was just unhooked is not tunneling, but if you chase him around the entire game then yes, that is. Survivors are at complete mercy of their peers. It is, however, entirely up to you how far they get with gens.
---
I know, I was just playing around
---
I think your game needs an exorcism 
---
I both agree and don’t agree here. 
---
I agree survivors should get some compensation for a DC, but I think 4x is wayyyy too much. 
---
I’d think of it more of a reverse “We’re Gonna live forever.”
---
For each person that disconnects, you get an extra 50% of blood points on the work you do. 
---
1 dc = 50% extra
---
2 dc = 100% extra
---
3 dc = 150% extra 
---
So if everyone on your team dc’s you get more, but not an overly ridiculous amount. 
---
Or, you get their survival bonus divided (loosely) by the number of people left in the game
---
1 dc = 1,500 extra (5,000/3)
---
2 dc = 4,000 extra (1,500 + 5000/2)
---
3 dc = 9,000 extra (4,000 + 5000/1)
---
In fact, I feel the ladder is more fair because you probably won’t get to do a lot, and using a % just means if a killer takes pity. You get to abuse the heck out of it. 
---
The ONLY drawback I have is that I feel this would cause only more DC’s. People already don’t care about their team if they DC, so the idea that at least their team will get something out of it means that people who were LESS likely to DC before May do it more now. 
---
Did somebody mention art
---
Kris Jenner
---
What’s the source of this?
---
Yes now take that an report it to dbd support! Posting it on here wont help
---
P A S S
---
And most of them unhook infront of a killer so you get instantly hooked again
---
I’ve never run NOED on my Myers or any other killer. It’s just not a fun perk to use. Survivors hardly ever get the gens powered anyway against me so it’s not even active most of my games. Why use a perk that is only good when you’ve basically already failed?
---
what gets those points?  because i seriously coop on gens and healing and i barely get points
---
Well and there’s basically only competitive mode in this game. There’s no fun breezy version of t for people who don’t give a crap about climbing ranks or decimating every match. That’s the kind of game where people can learn how to play without it just being an “another killer ground you into the dirt” experience. I honestly don’t blame people for not hanging in there to learn a game like that. 
---
Gotta wash the salt off.
---
Incorrect. The words used to describe items etc in this game can be misleading; this is one of those instances.

Yeah, I use all of them. 
---
I prefer Empathy over Bonds because at level three, of a teammate gets smacked, I immediate know the killer in near them, so it gives away killer placement. 
---
Leader is great for gen rushing. As is Binds if you just want to team up quickly. 
---
Urban evasion is great for everything except the doctor who can make you scream and give our your location (unless you have calm spirit). It’s especially good in the hospital and stuff because killers will run right past you as your turn corners with ease. 
---
Alert USED to be crap because it only happened within a certain tiny radius. Now it works for the entire map, and killers do break actions MANY times throughout the game. So you’ll often know where the killers is, every time they break a pallet or kick a generator. 
---
Hope that helps.

Dead Hard is excellent for 10-15, and good enough 5-10. People start hit-confirming by then, so you can expect to dodge them once, maybe twice if you're smart about it.
---
My brother was infuriating about "but I used DEAD HARD!!" the entire time we grinded David for the event, like you don't still have to time it carefully.

Sunk cost fallacy. You have to instead find the weak link survivor to distract the looping survivors into making mistakes or keeping them away from loops

There's a pretty good guide on Youtube made by [Ussylis.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pshlJLOeX7k) Bottom line is that you don't ever want to use your flashlight unless the killer is locked in an animation such as a survivor pickup animation, vaulting a window, and breaking a pallet. There's some fun things you can do against a killer that doesn't look away to avoid your flashlight too, but for the most part you're just going to get smacked in the mouth. 
---
Removed - Oversaturated Content
---
I think that the objective of the killer is to evaporate all the survivors for the entity, thata not been a douche, that is his job, a killer can't be nice to a survivor, if he tunnel a survivor then all the rest have free pass to open all generators
---
Has a killer I have been called everything from bad player to looser and more, just because I have to accept the survivor to save all the others players and live? No man, that's not going to happen
---
One just not get a gamertag and say "I will make the life impossible to douchebag69" a killer search and destroy, and if the killer doesn't know how to successfully patrol the generators and deny survivors a free gen, it may be his fault, but he needs to learn somehow! And if one know that the game is lost, we'll at least I got some points for killing one person
---
You can drop &amp; pick em up over and over and they'll wiggle off.
---
Alright you wanna go all extreme EVERY external program is cheating? Hey are you using any graphic driver that changes graphic options that the game doesn't allow? 
---
External use of a program. If you ask some extrimists that's also cheating. 
---
You know what can be achieved without an external program? Voice comms. If you wanna go all out on extremes, you can make a LAN party and just yell the information at eachother. That wouldn't be the use of an external program now would it? Well external programs are just covering that not having to go to eachother's house and make a complicated setups.

Frank's is the only way to enjoy playing Legion for me. It's either play as intended and be terrible or cheese the chase and bored.

Chasing good survivors is how you get better at chasing. You may lose the game, but you'll win more later.
---
Dead by Daylight
---
Well if you’re concerned with being logically consistent and not a “douche” and letting the killer enjoy the match, yes, that’s what you’d do. You’re literally asking the killer, your opponent, to purposely avoid attacking the weak/freshly unhooked player because you want them to be concerned with your enjoyment of the match.
---
As a survivor- escaping.
---
As a killer- killing everyone.
---
As a survivor anything else is objectively a loss. As killer, three kills is a draw, anything else is a loss.
---
Funny you should mention that because in my SWF, unless the killer is a BMer, we tend to let the killer kill one of us. 
---
It depends on how well the player knows how to use Legion.  If you haven't figured out the tricks, they're terribly weak, but if you know what you're doing they're overpowered to the point of being unfun for everyone involved.
---
Okay MAYBE sometimes it's my fault for being stupid
---
I think Fuck Matchmaking would be a more suitable title here
---
Keep in mind that, just like in any game with matchmaking, if you were playing with them as an experienced player, you're dragging killers into their games that are MUCH better than them. Basically, as much as it sucks to say, YOU are really the one screwing the experience lol.
---
Doesnt that just mean the killer didnt find them while they were working on gens?
---
Again, that doesn't really work. They can just run to another locker as soon as they stun you and get off your shoulder (especially easy considering most lockers in this game are coded as spawn pairs that always happen around certain obstacles/tiles
---
Indeed
---
Yes that's why I specifically asked if it was available to obtain in 4 days
---
It is just making a strawman argument. It is obvious I am talking about external programs which impact gameplay. But yes, having two people across the room yelling to each other would be exactly as equally cheating, because it is still using out of game functions to give in game advantages beyond the limitations of in game mechanics. I don't expect anyone to get banned for using voice comms or anything, that would be excessive and draconian, but my stance is if you use third party programs (or non electronic exploits as the case may be) to give you advantages in game that is cheating. Why would you have one set of rules for giving you communication abilities and a different set of rules for giving you extra speed abilities? Both are expanding what you are capable of in game beyond intended mechanics in a competitive game.
---
Sir, your comments are not within the context of the game and are not appropriate for a devout christian. I hope you will take my feelings in consideration in the future. 
---
Trying to avoid hit. SO TOXIC. Jeez some people need to fucking chill
---
Tunneling, 90% of the time, is an excuse made by salty survivors for why they lost.
---
What you've described may or may be called tunneling, but in all honesty, it's likely just smart play. Go after the easy target... in this case, the already injured survivor.
---
If you ignore the easy target to ruin a different player's day, THAT is what I personally would consider tunneling, because you are acting against the interests of your role in the game just to be a dick. It'd be comparable to a survivor infinitely looping a bad killer after the gates are opened, instead of just escaping, just to hold the game hostage.
---
Thanks for the elaboration, but still such usage of inappropriate words makes my back tingle.
---
No problem! None of this stuff is well explained in the game, so I try to help where I can. :)
---
There is a reason I said extremists. I can see where people are coming from with using voice comms. It makes the game more fun to be able to talk to your friends while you play together, but I think most reasonable people also see that it gives an in game advantage that was not intended for you to have. Even if you are okay with voice comms though, relaying meta information like the killer's perks after you are already dead just seems like a silly thing to think is fair.
---
I can show you the proof if you want. Dude you're fucking trash don't be salty because someone is better than you. Yoy think huntress is hard on console but its easy for me. Maybe you're just ass so it seems difficult.
---
Implying dead hard is a bad exhaustion perk?
---
\*confused oink\*
---
What they really need to do is stop people from disconnecting in the first place, which is pretty simple.
---
Give them a 15 minute ban from being able to queue again and I bet they won't leave whenever they face a nurse/mori or miss their DS. Also, increase the ban length for every subsequent DC to 30 mins, 1 hour, etc. This would also stop people from abusing disconnects to derank and bully noobs.
---
I put 240k miles on a 2003 Dodge Neon. I don't know what people's problem was with it, they should try getting better at driving. 
---
I’ve got no problem with that either. Keeping a limit on it. 
---
I said in an earlier comment that missed action interruptions could count as a hit instead. BUT if we’re gonna limit it to 3, I say they don’t count as damage at all. 
---
That just sounds wrong 
---
I think OP is referring to the killers "grab" animation specifically. It won't protect you from taking a hit, but you can't get pulled off a window, pallet, gen, etc... 
---
Could be an interesting perk, time/tokens would probably have to be balanced better.
---
Ultra Rares for Spirit are pretty useless imo. Most of the Purple addons give her top 3 killer potential. 
---
Wow they should nerf Freddy
---
This is for killing and this is for the chase.
---
O of course 
---
Billanced Billing?
---
I've had the complete opposite of this, every game i've been the last survivor alive, I haven't found me no hatch, every game i've played the killer i've found hatch before the last person. I've even carried one or two people to it to save them the trouble of looking for it. Of course i'm still new so i'm sure i'll get out via the hatch one of these days. 
---
But it's really good?
---
Smallville?
---
SO amazing!!! 
---
No problem, glad you’re enjoying the game. Keep up the good work. 
---
I mean, I can see an argument in that. if the game doesn't have a brightness adjustment function and using the dark to hide is a part of intended mechanics, changing the graphical settings using third party programs would give you an advantage not intended by the game designers and that other players who don't use your out of game program don't have access to. Like voice comms, it is pretty low on the scale, but it isn't unreasonable to label it as cheating to use third party programs to give you an in game advantage.
---
Um whatever helps you and all your rank 20 buddies sleep at night sure. 
---
Dear God no. Random survivors are already huge assholes as it is. Yes it's hard to survive when someone DC. Know what else would be hard? Having a teammate trying to get you to quit. It won't be long before the last two survivors just hide instead of doing gens hoping the other disconnects. 
---
The problem isn't that survivors aren't compensated enough when someone quits. The problem is survivors quitting isn't punished enough. Quitting early in the game needs to have more consequences for the player. 
---
Also if you get an unhook and a body block that's two tokens in quick succession.
---
Also if your teammates farm you, the hit you take will count as protection and give you a WGLF token, so at least you get some BP for your teammates murdering you.
---
When you miss then you activate your hidden perk, Disconnecting Strike.
---
Hey, at least you can get rid of NOED
---
I rank 1 though... What?
---
Again, I kinda feel like that's just poor control over the map. It's not like the survivors are utilizing anything to abuse tactics the killer just isnt guarding it. When people say gen rushing I view it more as them just saying they had poor map control. Seems synonymous to me. If survivors were using an exploit or 4 people had brand new parts that completely finished the gen that'd be one thing but they dont. So it's just the killers control.
---
whats up with that metal lookin thing on billy?
---
Agreed
---
Why do you prefer facing randoms to SWF?

There’s a difference between not wanting to learn the game and getting your urge to play killed by getting thrown in against people that are gonna repeatedly stomp you. If you’re bringing a friend who is brand new to this game into a match with you, they’re not gonna stand a chance in a chance because they’ll be playing against experienced players and the part of this game that is really fun is the chase. It’d be like bringing a friend who is new to siege against a full team of golds when you’re a diamond, it just won’t be fun to them and will kill their urge to play. It’s not games like COD (where plenty of people are fucking trash btw) that made them not want to play DBD, it was probably that they didn’t get to play lower ranks and didn’t have a chance to learn how to play.

still kinda wrong to use WGLF without borrowed or if you do dont unhook next to the killer and just bodyblock

other than the hatch, grabs aren't really very common unless you as the survivor have made a substantial misplay to put yourself in that situation. Even your example you used was you vaulting directly into the killer and then trying to vault back away immediately. Other than that, the only grabs that are commonly seen are killers pulling you off objectives, and frankly, that is so hard to do that you deserve it for sneaking up so close on someone. The only thing I like about the perk is that it gives a definitive winner to the hatch standoff, and frankly, that has been needed for years.
---
Oh god, kill it
---
It's not that they can't, it's that they don't want to. There's no reason to go higher than about rank 7.
---
OMEGALUL without dumb memes dead hard is very predictable to most killers. Yea sure might get it off the first time but if the killer isn't absolutely fucking retarded he will expect it. also most of the time survivors will dead hard into walls and it's pretty funny. 
---
Actually every survivor tries to do that since his release.
---
r/slazo
---
Or maybe it sounds *right*
---
Interruptions should be allowed though, it’s a survivor fucking up and a killer capitalising off of it. Kind of a shit perk imo. 
---
I guess but to most everyone the drawbacks are way worse
---
With 4 No Mithers, Thanatophobia actually becomes pretty decent. Especially if it's a skilled 4 stack swf who would typically hit greats from Ruin anyway, then the extra 12 seconds Thanatophobia adds per gen may even slow them down more than Ruin, and there is literally nothing the survivors can do to stop that.  More realistically, if they're running No Mither, they are likely running Resilience too, but then you're still increasing the gen times by 4.8s each instead of them reducing the time by 7.2s, resulting in that same 12s per gen net bonus time for the killer.  
---
Of course you have no way of knowing if it'll be a 4 stack of No Mither before the match, and anything shy of the absolute max value from Thanatophobia usually isn't going to be worth the slot. Even with the max penalty all match, it's still not the best thing, but I think it's at least a pretty acceptable amount of value to get from a perk slot.
---
I mean yeah, I run it with Borrowed Time and We'll Make It, but if you're really trying to farm that's how you get your tokens.
---
That's Hot, that's really hot
---
I imagine for David it's just the type of stupid answer he'd choose because someone else chose it and either he did too because he thought it'd be funny or because it sounds like an easy ride. 
---
I always picture David as the 'kind of dumb, class clown' character. Might be the haircut though.
---
If he lost to the worst nurse then imagine how shit he his 
---
Even then rank doesn't really matter, I have played this game alot though, and dead hard is a damn good perk.
---
I misinterpreted it initially that you meant you couldn't be hit while in a vaulting animation, not specifically the grab and pick up function. It is a lot less powerful than what I originally interpreted, but also still kind of abuseable and kind of unintuitive. The example you give of pulling you off a gen failing is just really awkward in game that the killer just has to tug at you against a gen 3 times before you finally actually move. not saying it would be broken, just really awkward.
---
Lets put in offerings to increase/decrease pallets spawn, Ultra rare survivor offering adds 1 extra pallet, Ultra rare Killer offering removes 3.
---
Don't forget to reply with your hate.
---
It’s tough but make a break for another loop when the opportunity arises and then use he pallet to slow the killer. The windows with L walls in a square is what the community calls “jungle gyms.”
---
Yep, it explains why rank 1 is a joke now unlike how it was before the emblem update when everyone there was a sweaty fuck and you had to play full meta at this rank
---
All 4 stacks I’ve seen have been big time altruistic, so bad so they will try flashlights saves while injured right in my face lol  
---
Just need to adjust your play style 
---
And play on their weaknesses 
---
Death by Bills
---
Smallville meme using the actor who played Quentin in the Nighmare remake. Very nice meme 👌
---
IMO, Voice coms that were built into the game could infact be fair.  If the coms created localized sound in game that any nearby survivors or the nearby killer could hear, they would produce a very valid point of counterplay that I think survivors and killers could agree with.
---
It allows every survivor to opt into semi-SWF experience based on localized talking, AND killers would probably laugh their ass off if they surprise someone and cause them to scream both in game and IRL.
---
But that is probably far beyond possible at this point, and would require an even more major overhaul to the already shoddy codebase of DBD.
---
Sure. Of course if you know they’re all running No Mither it might be worth it, but that has such a minute chance of ever happening, that Thanatophobia is never worth using.
---
Psh. It would actually follow horror movie logic. All those scenes where the killer almost gets someone but they juuuuust manage to slip through their fingers. 
---
You could say the same thing about Dead Hard and Decisive strike. They help redeem a sticky situation against a killer that always has the ability to be faster than you. 
---
Um again you have to be a tiny bit smart to play dbd take swamp for example with balanced landing you have hills you have docks and you have the ship and other buildings etc there are many things to balance landing off of and it has a very good chance to get you away from the killer not like dead hard where dead hard like i said unless your playing against an autistic killer your not going to be getting away. 
---
Friends ask you out, but you stay home to play DBD cause you have fun for hours.  
---
DBD is baiting you to spend hours on it cause it gets addictive.  
---
Pretty easy to understand imo.
---
Hell I enjoy it more when they say something then delete the comment right after. Really started screen shotting my notifications just cause of it.
---
IS THAT BILL FROM LEFT4DEAD??
---
I looped a legion on lery's for 3 gens, got hooked and then proxy camped. I signaled by waving my arms but a claudette came to unhook me and didnt have borrowed time. The legion waited for the unhook and then downed me again and never chased after the claudette. I struggled and the same thing happened when a Kate came to unhook me. Legion again downed me and never chased after the Kate. Is this smart play for a killer?
---
Okay, sure. Have fun with your lack of a social life, douche.
---
Anyway, could the killer just get a hit instead of an interruption? Also, in horror movies, the survivors don’t rush towards the killer and t-bag them. 
---
Why don't you post all the comments so people have more context? We came to a mutual agreement at the end. I edited my comments a few hours after posting as they don't reflect my behavior. Have you ever gotten on the DBD Subreddit just after playing against toxic Myers?
---
I don't condone my comments... I just hate playing as a survivor against tryhard killers at low ranks, just like your post was made about getting mori on tryhard survivors at low ranks.
---
I love doing this as a killer, feels like outwitting the hatch camper. I still hook the other survivor though
---
Are you backing off on my offer? Yeah smart move dude 
---
The dude tried to change his comments, which would make you look like the asshole, but you caught on and now this happened. 
---
So not only did he act like a jerk and change his comments, there's even proof of it now lol
---
There is bad arguments for why it’s like that. The main one being “BHVR hates killers.”
---
I don't think it would be impossible to include a balanced voice system, but it would be very difficult. one of the problems though, is if they include an in game voice system like you have described that gives a limited range directional voice communication system, people won't use it. They will just keep using discord, because it is objectively more powerful for them. Global communication and the killer doesn't get alerted, why would you use the in game system? It would make it more blatantly cheating rather than now where it is implicitly unfair but not blatantly cheating to use discord.
---
Yep. I don’t play those games. I’m done arguing with such a juvenile person.
---
The first point is one reason why I'm really enjoying Bond.  It gives you a really good tell on if you can stay on a gen or not, in that if a survivor is running nearby (especially if injured) when the heartbeat picks up, then its probably safe to just keep on fix'n that gen because the killer is already chasing, and if you need to reposition to avoid getting spotted while working on it.
---
No you're done arguing because im right and you're wrong 
---
Tag what for crippling depression? 
---
*whispered a lone voice among a sea of blood, salt, and tears*
---
Idk why everyone immediately got so salty at you, lol. Gen, genny, who cares.
---
Your trick is good, but it'll only work a couple times against a nurse that knows better than to jump on top of a survivor every time. Nurse is about reads and adapting, and it's what separated a good nurse from a great nurse.
---
A nurse can shorten distance, however, by aiming at the ground. Yes, your technique works, but the nurse has a couple of options to counter it, so you need to mix up your jukes.
---
Uhm.. who is tum tums? 
---
Yes but that’s on the survivor then. They could stay still and burn all their tokens (meaning no easy hatch escape) or they could run. I’d say it depends. I don’t know how they calculate when you interrupt vs when you hit. If a survivor is sitting on a gen with tokens, I don’t think they should be able to get pulled off during that time. But should they be able to take damage and get hit and be downed? Absolutely. 
---
I think a simple “no” will suffice :)
---
Susie is luv &lt;3 
---
What do you have against single, white females?
---
Dead hard isn't supposed to be used in the open though? You can use it pretty well to cover a mistake when looping, or to save you if you cant make it to a window or pallet in time.
---
BL still has a fair chance to be on a map where there are no drop downs, or one drop down.
---
Which means you either can't get there in time, or you become predictable, because you are running to the same place every time.
---
I come from LoL and have 12 permabans. I think I'll manage the toxicity in game.
---
I disagree with that statement, but the ability to not end a chase faster isnt the survivor's fault either. When I started as killer there were infinites, insta blinds, vacuum pallets, and brand new parts that finished gens in less than a minute.
---
Even during those times you could pull 4ks before all the gens were completed. I think the mentality has shifted towards people complaining about gen rushing or DS and not focusing on getting better. You'll always have some games you get outplayed but I think just attributing it to something out of your control is basically giving up and not trying to become an awesome killer. I think that's a larger issue with the community now is 2 gens get done and people immediately just think they lost so they camp someone or just get super angry. It's a battle until the end and giving up doesnt help you win that or get better.
---
Holy shit, no wonder I have been struggling to finish it. And the points are so small for it too!
---
How is he annoying the killer? Isnt it normal to try and not get hit?
---
Yes, that 0 radius myers jump is VERY obvious.
---
Sort of why I hate M&amp;A.  It really breaks Myers with his naturally super low radius in T1 (literally goes to 0 outside of a chase), or a Dead Rabbit T2 Myers.  It also bugs out Borrowed Time quite frequently, which IMO should be reverted to the old form, and just be changed to work on if the killer is within 24M when the save is done.  Terror radius is such a dumb restriction when killers have the ability to have massively variable, or even no, terror radius (Pig charging ambush)
---
lol
---
Close enough. I think Nea should have been replaced with a treasure chest to convey it better.
---
And I thought I was crazy for running BBQ Chili with Hillbilly at rank 15.
---
Do you?
---
Not if they have a p3 claudette!
---
I can promise you I got this game last week, think before calling people out.
---
Unless that killer is a nurse because a nurse that makes no mistakes will virtually always 3k or better
---
Optimal freddy build: Thanatophobia, Dying Light, Sloppy Butcher, Remember Me; rare dress addon and class photo; ivory mori (for obsession once you've gotten all stacks for RM) or game map offering bc survivors are just potatoes on the map and it's small 
---
**\^\^\*THIS COMMENT IS PROTECTED BY A REVERSE BLOCKER, YOU CANNOT REPLY TO IT WITH A NO U TO RETURN THE COMMENT\*\^\^**
---
 What we're all looking for 
---
Say if a survivor flashlight blinds the killer. Killer chases him down. So far, so good.
---
Survivor gets saved, goes back to gens with his savior. Killer wanders up, both survivors scatter. Flashlight boy sprint bursts away, meanwhile the other sits on the gen a little long, clips the wall, gets stuck on a rock, whatever, and is much closer. Killer ignores this much easier target just to chase down flashlight boy, just because he thinks flashlights are crutches.
---
Personally, I only call something tunneling if a killer is purposely ignoring their own role in the game to stomp on one player. Mistakes don't count, continually hooking the same survivor just because that survivor is always the easy target doesn't count. In practice, tunneling is usually bad for the killer, and good for the other 3 survivors.
---
Leatherface's only strong point as a killer is that he excels at defending objectives (ie: camping). That's doubly true in tight spaces like the basement. People naturally will play to his strengths. On the flipside, he is very weak in a chase anywhere you can find windows and pallets, as his ability does nothing to help him in a chase. The exception being if you use add-ons to increase his chainsaw charge speed, in which case he may be able to end a chase sooner if he can catch a survivor before they reach a window or pallet.
---
I can promise you I got this last week, whether you believe me or not doesn’t make any difference at all.
---
Nah it's the simple question of Superman vs Goku. You have both sides jacked to the 9s with a primal instinct to win and see what happens
---
Maybe the blood web is what needs to be changed? Lower the cost of everything by 1K?
---
Nope. Definitely not easy to grasp. 
---
Because he’s the only killer that can kill both survivors as soon as the unhook occurs. And they’re also always running BBQ so they’ll know if they don’t see auras everyone is close.

Happens all the time whe running self care in a chase. I just move a little bit behind the pallet because the option to self care goes away when moving at all and the pallet option stays.

Ebony mori: 4 killed by your hand available

this is quality content right here, this is the type of thing I come to this subreddit for
---
It’s not just you. 
---
I just close the lobby and find a new one if they're mostly SWF it's unfair on the killer :/
---
Randoms can't communicate. SWF groups can coordinate gens and basically know who the killer is and where they are at any given time. Good example would be if I'm trying to protect my ruin totem and a survivor comes across it - against randoms I can usually chase that person off/hook them and still have a LITTLE bit of time. Against a SWF as soon as one person comes across it they all swarm and its much harder to defend. There are lots of little things like that. SWF have a huge advantage vs randoms because comms were not built into the game.
---
I never said anyone here does not have a right to express their opinions.
---
If you can't kill any survivors, get better at the game. It's highly unlikely you never get any kills if you aren't brain dead.
---
Of course you won't consistently be getting 4ks. What does that have to do with tunneling though? That doesn't help in the slightest. I'm not here to give you a guide on how to get better. You do that yourself through practice.

Yeah that happened to me when I first started playing. Rank 20 killer and I was up against SWF three of them rank 1 and one of them rank 2.

Leader is meh unless you build your entire class around it and get lucky with a killer that isn’t good at splitting people up.
---
Urban Evasion is really good if you’re on a corn map or have fog enhancing offerings but is otherwise unnoticeable.

---
A killer might drop all hex perks if someone has a map with them. Which promotes survivors to just wait until 7 seconds are left and switch to a character with the real items they want to bring in.
---
Freddy's never gotten buffed. He got nerfed yet again in the most recent patch.
---
I don't think that would work because of console. 
---
Wait what, does that stop DS like dropping them to the ground?
---
Most of mine are shit but I did them anyway, I just went for perks with more than 1 word except ones that would look stupid like dab care
---
What. I’m confused. Do you use NOED?
---
The virgin killer vs the Chad David
---
they would probably use another perk on console.
---
Ya I agree. I think most Freddy players just tunnel really hard, which doesnt really give your aura reading ability any time to be any use. It fine to let a surv go in favour of kicking a gen or putting another surv to sleep because you can find them again easily after.
---
Well you couldn’t. I’m pretty sure it’s person exclusive. For example, this particular dev has this Claudette shirt.
---
R1 on any platform is about the same. People suck all across the board, whether I’m playing on my Xbox or my laptop I get about the same amount of sucky survs and good survs
---
3 out of 4 isnt a bad game. You dont need 4 kills every game to have 'won'
---
I know man but I just said What IF
---
No Claudette, this post is invalid
---
Isn't it kinda the point to do whatever you can to not get hit and to get away from the killer after the ability runs out?
---
I mean it's not fun for the killer either lol. I get extremely frustrated even during rank reset, being forced into matches with survivors who are dogshit at the game is not fun. I'm basically just farming bots at that point
---
Exactly. There isn't much outplay either. You either drop and he vaults for a free hit, or you don't drop and still get hit. Hence why Legion is annoying to play against.
---
Fun killers are ones you can outplay. The Legion has to be bad or make extremely huge mistakes for a survivor to outplay. Otherwise you will go down real quick verse a Legion chasing you.
---
We need this game to have more interaction for outplay potential for killer and survivor. Legion is a step back from that. He is the most linear killer they have ever released in terms of game play. Find a survivor? You will down them at most in X seconds, unless you severely mess up.
---
I guess but it’s like getting a C. Your parents are disappointed and you still look dumb. I should also specify that it’s never a hatch escape, it’s always an escape and since most ps4 survivors teabag at the gate a free noed.
---
His aura reading has nothing to do with the fact that it takes far too long for survivors to finish the dream transition and there's no punishment for being in said transition.
---
Why not Self Dab tho lol it looks cool. 
---
No joke i have finals this week and considering last week was double bp event its safe to assume im not going to do great
---
Good point, I don't play killer so I failed to consider their point of view.
---
I don't think you can buy any of them. Those Artifact ones are real exclusives and not available for buying. The cosmetics from the Charity Case should have a different rarity than the "actual" streamer ones, but I don't own the Charity Case.
---
Can I get this template?
---
im really bad at hitting stuns without also getting hit, just wanted to nope the fuck outta there :(
---
I dont really know, it would be difficult to say the least. Balancing SWF isnt really the topic of my post either so I havent really thought about it.
---
I think maybe being more mindful that SWF use out of game comms while designing new killers, or balancing old ones, would go a long way. They should also start play testing them in that type of environment if they dont already because most lobbies have a SWF group of some number in them I think. It might no t be a full on 4 stack but even a 2 player group working together can give killers a hard time.
---
Yeah. Claudette really is the person to prestige. Her bloody stuff makes her super hard to see on every map EXCEPT The Game, where colors of blue and gray are more your friend.

PrEtTy GoOd JoB sO fAr...
---
Is your last name Toos-Wallow?
---
Not quite the same, but I had a game with some friends where we managed to convince the killer to do a reverse game of cat and mouse where we, the survivors, chased the killer. Was pretty dumb and essentially just a farming game but it's pretty funny when you manage to communicate with only gestures. 
---
Did you feel anger? Hatred?
---
Yes they do.

Thrill is only really good on Console. Skill checks are harder and survivors tend to rush totems. Thana is just not good. To put is in perspective 2 hits hurts a ruin a little bit and when someone dies it reduces the total amount. I suggest running MaA and NC or Sloppy if you have Myers. Trapper is really hard to play but fun to play. Try iron and agitation for the best basement build ever. LF is just not going to be fun to use. LF is not a good killer.
---
ngl I spent the last two weeks farming iridescent shards instead of starting to write my dissertation. no regrets though, I'm gonna cry about it later
---
You do kinda have a super decreased chance of winning if the killer uses one of those addons though. Can’t fault them for not finding that fun, it’s my least favorite part of this game.
---
Don't even need one of my friend's to tell me, i always take small game and assume the killer has noed
---
Yea that’s why they could have a mute button and a volume bar in setting and go to match details and it would be right by their name
---
she wasted a full minute and 2 gens trying to find me lol sometimes there is more than one way to play 💁🏻‍♀️
---
Or just not have one. It’s not really worth it. Just allows for more toxicity, even with a volume/mute button.
---
Why did you try to hide? He knew you didn’t run right so he knew you had to be to his left. Boil Over has to be the most situational perk but damn is it funny when it works.
---
Right away?? Sometimes they take 3 months to fix them
---
Do you realise how hard it is for them to isolate a bug and then figure out how to fix it? 
---
Wow that explains it. I just got this game a week ago and got the challenge today. I didn’t understand what was going on. Thanks for the details. 
---
Yea the game would be a lot more popular and hearing different people with different personalities it would be nice and you can always just mute that one person
---
If the killer isn't braindead it's only use is to get to a pallet or window.
---
She wont be too great because we are limited to our turn speed using a controller, vs a mouse's speed. Ill say though that she isnt unplayable on console imho, just requires loads of practice
---
I would probably stop playing if one was added tbh
---
Well that would be your choice and you could just choose to mute them all if you wanted
---
Ty
---
I take off work for double blood points, same with double xp on RuneScape.
---
How pathetic you are, absolutely laughable
---
Well I’m an idiot that runs into every trap so I’d say he is quite good :D
---
Good for you, did you get your anger out for the day? If the mods want to remove it they can. 
---
New killer that uses survivors as a weapon
---
I would love a shirtless Dwight to go with my shirtless David. 
---
That’s why it’s fun..
---
Smart man. That perk is the most underrated one IMO. I used to always run it every game.
---
I dont think thats true. If 3 players is a C then whats a B or an  A? Cause youre only missing one dude at that point. 
---
I feel like an 'average' game of DBD should end with 2 kills and 2 escapes. If you are getting more than that on average then you are doing a good job.
---
**Rule 3** - Shaming other players.
---
* Do not publicly shame other players.
---
At least 50% of players on this game play it because their friends play with them. Suggesting that they delete SWF just sounds like you are crying that players can enjoy a game with friends.
---
On a farm match it's easy, you and the other healer fail every skill check to make it take forever. It'll sound like an aggressive rape scene but you'll get the co-op time. 
---
I disagree because keeping people alive for a majority of the game makes it more exciting.  Having your perks potentially revealed to the rest of the group should remain as it provides a downside to the targeted destruction of a single player.
---
And we've all been that single player - it's almost never fun.
---
I just watched it...yeah, it wasn't really good...but I guess it wasn't just straight awful lol
---
Maybe. 
---
Yeah, I think I was figuring if I was sneaky enough I could get away, but overall I knew I'd be able to get out of his grasp a 2nd time if I stuck around. 
---
Why would I want to get screamed at by survivors who did nothing but teabag at the exit while I’m still learning? I know. I suck. I’m new to this. Don’t be a dick? 
---
It can never come close tbh, unless they add voice chat and it becomes a necessity to play (even then coordination with friends will still make SWF more powerful)
---
I agree that it is unfun for solo players, being one myself, but I think it's a worthy sacrifice. Waiting till dedicated servers is a great idea though
---
So basically, what everyone else says about her. 
---
I actually didn’t think of that. Smart decision making.
---
Yup lol
---
I mean then you could ask the same question for any neutral perk, it would probably say its owned and would give you bp if you bought it. 
---
they already tried this. it did not work
---
You put on that NOED just for that screenshot to trigger people or you are using it in every match?
---
Oh ok, thanks. I though it was like charity case and stuff. 
---
jokes on everyone that thinks this.
---
why not use enduring and pick drop him in a corner to be safe. 
---
after 5 hes on his feet, and if he is AFK, GG
---
I think those are uncommon rarity but don’t quote me on that.
---
Thanks, I though it was like the streamer cosmetic from the charity case. Do the ones from convention fall into this category as well? 
---
I once got 5 4ks in a row at rank 1 with Freddy if that means anything. I also got to rank 4 playing hag back when she was shit and I didn't even know how to lunge yet lol. So I mean, I'm pretty good I think.
---
Please appoint me the ToS rule that using comms software is breaking it. You simply can't and its just stupid to think so, you can't use any software that actively changes the game (that LITERALLY modifies the game) voice comms does absolutely nothing with the game, its the same as saying using a decent graphics card is cheating cause you get more fps/resolution so you see more...
---
Ugh stupid survivors running away from me they're so toxic that's why when i play survivor to avoid being toxic I run in a straight line away from all windows and pallets         /s
---
3? I think you mean 30
---
God. I thought it was only me. 
---
Someone said that they should wait to patch this with the dedicated servers and the perks should just remain hidden to swf ques and I stand by that. Also, names and items are nowhere near as strong of an indication compared to perks. Although I do think items should be hidden because of lightborn and Franklin's
---
nope, keep on camping so we can fix generators in peace
---
You should try Spirit Fury+ Enduring on Bubba. Really fun combo and its usually free chainsaw.
---
No sorry one X with 4k tv 
---
Survivors whine about countering BBQ+C, but outside of there being multiple ways of countering it even *before* the recent locker change and Distortion perk release, the nerfs go against the concept of the perk. Now the killer has no way to tell who's where if survivors get close or hide in lockers or have Distortion, etc. etc., which just leads to them camping (which is what BBQ+C is meant to reduce).
---
I very rarely, if ever, get flamed in voice chats in any other game.
---
I was about to make a post about this too
---
Anyone who teabags and dicks around once they’re done are toxic
---
As much as I like to moan that half the killer cast isn't viable at high level play, the game is literally 400% more balanced than it was at the start. I'm still getting two kills average with my legion at rank 1 with brown add-ons. Sure, the survivors are bad because you can be a rank 1 survivor by just grinding and having great perks and a swf team, but still. Pallet nerfs and jungle gym removal have been massive improvements for killer gameplay.
---
I see the downvotes and upvotes and I see everyone is a survivor main
---
If i am reading this correctly because everyone countered BBQ you camped the hook because you thought everyone was close and then snowballed because someone EVENTUALLY tried to make a save. Camping achieves this exactly whether or not they countered bbq. Basically you just camped a guy amd whether they countered bbq or not is irrelevant
---
Absolutely. Everybody on here thinks they are God's gift to survivor/killer. You're the first person I've ever seen admit that they at least occasionally make mistakes. Nobody here is humble or honest about their abilities lol
---
He says while running NOED
---
Boil over gets a lot of shit, but in the right place and time it can monster fuck a killer
---
And it’s true. 
---
Even DC’ing

---
I'm very open about how bad I am at the game. But wow, talk about thinking your special lol people obviously make mistakes in the game I don't see what's to hide
---
I don't approve of your suggestion. I like the many bings, gives my prey ample time to run from their impending death, and it makes the chase more interesting. 
---
interesting!! i never thought to use save the best for last on freddy! but spirit fury and enduring together would be great together since looping freddy is so easy 
---
Oh because suvivors had infinits early we should just shut the fuck up ? Are you mentaly crippeled ? 
---
WE WANT BALANCED ! If you would know what you talking about, you would no its completly balanced in favor of the suvivors !!!
---
What? You want all survivors alive until gates are opened for excitement? That's terrible gameplay killer wise and terrible balance wise as well. Tunneling or not, you should have your first kill by the completion 3 gens. Somebody is gonna see your perks regardless of playstyle unless you are just bad at the game or are being outclassed by survivors.
---
You do realize there a different types of Gamers, right ? 
---
Stuff like this is why I'm glad I got in during the vanilla days. DBD in its current incarnation is a hard sell to people unaware of all the salt and broken builds both sides are capable of using.
---
I totally get where you're coming from I was just thinking about slowing all survivors actions as much as possible
---
But its the same amount of bings...
---
i'm so confused now
---
What an idiot!! 🤣🤣
---
Yeah and anyone who legit plays nurse probably has her leveled enough for better addons anyway but I'm talking about the people who have just picked her up, likely have noed 1 and use 3 blinks because they're not very good with her. That extra blink can really make a difference up close and its just stupid that some people learn to play her with noed and 3 blinks. The common and uncommon 3rd blink addons just shouldn't exist IMO. 
---
Good
---
And yet you you got triggered about the first reply. 
---
You reached rank 1 with the top tier killer? wow, good one.
---
So you're so bad at playing killer, that people being able to communicate with each other really ruins your gaming experience? That's all I'm hearing.
---
I dunno I find her way smoother since the update but may just be me 😂 thanks anyway 
---
Those two things aren't mutually exclusive. 
---
 very ungood
---
Maybe have some fun with it? If all you do is grind bps what’s the point.
---
You just said devs don't care about balance and I negated your claim by stating that the devs are in fact balancing the game lol. Sure, there's still a way to go, that's why I'm advocating for this swf nerf lol. And if you play any killer better than hag, the game is just ridiculously easy unless you just get terrible map for your killer. Killers have it really good now unless you main wraith, clown, doctor, Freddy or something, lol. And even then, you should still be able to get two kills if you're better than the survivors.
---
Is that Jake from state farm?
---
My chilli is also pretty spicy ;) 
---
wHy dO yOu hAtE fRiEnDsHiP!??
---
That sounds amazing!
---
Oh, well, there are many variations of those creatures.
---
ready up
---
They were doing gens they just sent one guy for the save eventually and he got intercepted, thus killing the guy on the hook and from there I snowballed.
---
Big pp energy
---
I think I’ve 99d it before I went away. I always try to heal with a friend but it goes so fast those 180 seconds take the fucking piss 
---
&gt; you're playing fortnite at 25
---
I don't play Fortnite. I haven't played it in at least 3 months and when I did play it I played 1-2 days max.
---
Regardless, your hate boner for Fortnite is pathetic. It is the most popular game of all time. People of all ages play it. 
---
Do you think you're somehow a better person because you don't like what other people like? 
---
So removing infinites and nerfing pallets didn't add any balance the game? Alrighty then. I'm sorry that I can't understand your genius level intellect. At least I'm smart enough to annoyed aknowledge the game is more balanced than ever 🤷‍♂️
---
I don’t like either of them bc they come with hefty drawbacks so trying to learn with those or just using them at all is a nasty experience for me. It’s rare or bust for me man
---
Look at how many people have the dlcs.
---
Steam post was wrong. If you lose a pip you're back down to rank 2.
---
I usually just strafe in the direction I want to go and never have had a major issue with it while doing that tbh
---
i generally dont have an issue with NOED, unless the killer has a built in auto-down, like myers, hillbilly, leatherface.
---
They're changing it so everyone joins together regardless of the SWF/solo play so rip killers that like to adjust to swf. 
---
Reported :)
---
I agree. You’ll play a great game as survivor and get only 7-8K sometimes. Makes things very difficult. Where as if you’re a killer under 20K you had a bad game. 
---
Read the second edit. 
---
I see lots of use for this really. 
---
I think that if they combined WGLF and We'll Make It into one perk and I think it would be perfectly fine. Doesn't make much sense as to why BBQ gives a stacking BP bonus AND aura reading but if you look at survivors, one of the only stacking BP perks they have only stacks BP and does nothing else.
