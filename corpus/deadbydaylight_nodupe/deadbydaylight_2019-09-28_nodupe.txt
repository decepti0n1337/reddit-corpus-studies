I’ve tried this all day. They never get the hint.
---
---
---
This is exactly what I’ve wanted to say but couldn’t so I was accused of just hatin lol 
---

---
I’m saving your comment because this is exactly how I feel and I can’t express it in simple terms myself
---
Yeah if you go directly for a gen over a survivor higher levels will get the hint
---
I just stand still and teabag as ghostface but they don’t seem to understand that
---
hit surv and chase another that full health. smack gens will do too.
---
Pretty much this lol I love just running up on people pushing against them and they start getting confused til they stop and teabag and I get to shake my head yes vigorously
---
r/cursedcomments
---
Thank you!
---
Holy fuck, how can I hate and love a picture at the same time?
---
Time to turn my sens up so I can nod hard af
---
Oh, would you look at that. A Cannibal daily. I'll just delete that an- a Shape daily. Great.
---
Why is everyone getting downvoted lmao
---
Never trust a baggage
---
Idk if I'd say WGLF stacks are easier. Getting four safe unhooks while not putting your team in a bad position and/or not wasting a bunch of time isn't trivial. 
---
If we're assuming all you care about is WGLF stacks and you don't mind screwing over your team sometimes, then sure getting four safe unhooks isn't that hard, especially if you run Borrowed Time to guarantee the "safe" unhook.
---
No. Only BBQ WGLF party streamers and the cakes.
---
I mean I hit mine literally every single time it’s pretty rare when I miss mine
---
Just the way we are I guess, if you dislike it Inguess you gotta either deal or go to those other communities
---
Thats quite a long time
---
Ok, have to change my opinion here a little bit, because the killers addons dont directly add BPs on Top, but they help to fill the category-caps (4x 8k). But still, this is some kind of help that survivors dont have :/
---
Sooooooo you weren't actually banned then? Cause the shortest ban is 24 hours
---
Except “empty void person” isn’t a real thing. I’m not scared of werewolves or mummies because they aren’t real, but they boast the same “unfeeling killer” vibe. You know what’s real? Bad people, doing bad things, trauma is real, abuse is real, Michael isn’t unique because he has no character development, *Halloween* just did the masked psycho thing before it was big so it seems more legitimate because it’s a “classic” I watched Halloween 2018 and honestly it didn’t do anything for me. Because people decided they liked Michael better when he was boring so the whole movie other people had to contrive reasons for him to do anything, the podcasters tainted him, he does nothing (cool) the doc frees him (still really doesn’t do anything) he finds the podcasters and his mask and his suit in the same place (by accident) then he starts killing people (at random) until he’s found by people who were already looking for him and then they literally throw him in a car and drive him to the climax of the movie. Like why is this guy supposed to be scary? He seems like a moron who can’t think long enough to do anything productive. What was his plan? Just kill people until he’s caught? He must know how heinous his crimes are, so what does he plan on doing? running? Fight the police? Does he want to die by cop? Nope he’s just a bLaCk sOuL so we don’t have to explain shit, that’s how it feels. 
---
Look, I’m not really here to tell you what to be scared of. But all the time I get people who will defend old Michael to the death but then any time they try to add anything to his character suddenly he’s “ruined” H2 “ruined” Michael because he was going after Laurie and she’s revealed to be his sister (how dare he have a motive) H3 “ruined” Halloween because Michael wasn’t in it 4-5-6 “ruined” Michael by implying he was supernatural and/or connected to a cult/conspiracy h20 “ruined” Michael because JLC’s hair was short and you could see his eyes resurrection “ruined” him by saying h20 Michael was just some guy, and now everyone and their mother has to come out of the woodworks to tell me why rob zombie ruined Michael Myers, when all he did was tell the same story but believable, modern, and tragic.
---
That’s smart I wish console had chat.
---
What is that joke I never get it?
---
Games like these REALLY need trophy progress bars that's the problem with PS4 trophy system
---
Soooo you weren't actually banned then? Shortest ban is 24 hours.
---
Ok, thx, i corrected this :D
---
Loads of baby killers here downvoting. 
---
Spirit is ez as hell. 
---
Needs a nerf IMO to put her up to nurse skill level.
---
You have 36 characters at P3?
---
Later he tweeted it wasn’t actually his petition he was just drawing attention to it.
---
If the devs do all the cosmetics being demanded of them for Steve and Nancy we will literally never get another cosmetic for anyone ever again
---
I'm getting it too, played about 10 games of killer yesterday and every single one of them at least 1 person dc'd. This wasn't an intentional dc either.
---
He said he’s the one disconnecting not people in his lobby
---
You can change ini files dude, that's literally there for you to unlock a locked fps. It's also the file to change full screen stuff and sensitivity. There's certain file folders eac checks, and the ini file isn't one of them.
---
It's okay you're not the only one. Smh. I was given bad advice and was told to facecamp hooked survivors. I didn't realise until I played survivor how bad that was.
---
Hes also a perfectly balanced killer (speaking for whole rank range not just red ranks)
---
I feel bad for the vommy mommy,she literally killed no one but tried to save people instead,still ended up as a killer :'(
---
This shit ain’t cyberbullying.
---
All a salty player can do is:
---
* Make a few hateful remarks in a TEMPORARY post-game chat window or PM
---
* Leave hateful comments on your profile that you can delete
---
I see the word “bullying” being thrown around a lot. If people actually use this word seriously, then they ought to feel grateful because their lives are so sheltered that something this trivial can bother them so much.
---
This is a video game. You should be more concerned if you’re getting bullied in real life or social media.

---
Looping isnt being a shithead and neither is using items in the game
---
Well it's that pop works a lot better on him. Pop works well on killers that can get individual downs quickly, but fail to apply pressure on multiple survivors. Like ghostface. Killers like Myers, who take time to build his power and down a lot of people at once, are better with ruin. Ghostface can do well without ruin even at red ranks, where you start downing people relatively quickly into the match.
---
Jesus Christ you're pathetic, lmao
---
Give more points for doing other things. I shouldn’t get less than 15k points per game just because I was the gen jockey. God forbid I not run across the map to unhook someone.
---
Lotta problems on ps4 lol
---
That's his point. You get into matches as survivor so quickly because killers are waiting for enough survivors to get in queue.
---
Also. Small add on. Nea is another good one because of urban evasion and balanced landing. Both decently strong perks in their own way
---
Kate is the best survivor due to her small size, moderate grunt noises, and quiet breathing. David is the worst on all of these fronts, he’s big, loud, and loud again, but cosmetics trump all this if you like a survivor play them.
---
ok, the updated Engine may be the problem here. 3 years ago it run ok-ish, now I can just watch the demogorgon having a seizure in a bad graphic lmao
---
honestly I can understand the fact that there is a lot more content, but that alone isn't enough to just kill the game in the client (since you're not loading all the maps at the same time in game)
---
This is so fucking hilarious. The lack of awareness is astounding. You go into my profile and see me vehemently fighting *against the defence* of pedophilia and somehow think "He's a pedophile!"  because you can't understand context.
---
I hate to be one of those guys but the DVD Community seems extremely left. Same with the political and news like you had said. Anyone with a different opinion gets downvoted and insulted to Oblivion. Honestly most Reddit communities are just Echo Chambers and they kick out any dissenting opinions
---
Why do you have insidious on GF tho?
---
Hahahaha got it my dude
---
I used all my Gateaus months ago when they first came out
---
You play survivor and still think that doing the objective is genrush? You genrush yourself since you touch gens
---
smh, just use them with ghost face
---
Killers are always tryhards and this event makes them thirstier because not only do they get their usual 5x BP than survs but also double AND a chance to double fuck survivors.
---
As someone who always solos, yes, it does suck, but some randoms do know what they are doing. Trust me, I wouldn't survive even half the time I do if I wasn't carried.
---
Yes absolutely
---
Stalking gens
---
Why use sloppy butcher? I thought you couldn't see blood trails while phasing?
---
Never t-bag Michael when he isn’t moving, ESPECIALLY at the exit gates when you aren’t at drop distance to escape lol
---
His new upcoming cosmetic destroys your claim!
---
Bad luck I guess
---
No mate, you clearly cannot answer a simple fucking question and hide behind absolute bollocks. Then you engage in a conversation about pedo's. Dude, there is no conversation regarding pedo's. If you feel the need to engage with pedophiles then you must be one. Sick fuck. Kids do not deserve to be fiddled.
---
I feel differently, I run WGLF and Prove Thyself when I'm farming.  I can max out my objective points in about 2 generators, and I usually end games with at least 2 stacks of WGLF.  
---
Per game I could earn more as a killer, but since I can turn around games pretty quick as survivor I end up with more points on average in the same time frame as I would playing killer, and as survivor I can walk out of games with more items than I started, basically free blood points in a sense.  
---
But like I mentioned above, maybe I'll ry tracking it and see how it turns out.  I'll do a week of each, try to play same time each day) and compare the two to see how it comes out.
---
Mac has terrible performance for game anyway, they just aren't built for that (which is totally fine, I didn't buy it with gaming in mind at the time). 
---
&gt;Mac performance becomes terrible the older it is
---
Honestly I never experienced that, what was running years ago still runs pretty well now
---
I feel like I'm not even 360ing properly but it somehow works sometimes lol
---
The only reportable body blocking is the kind that holds the game hostage, like when killers use to be able to body block the basement and just sit there until the survivors were forced to dc. Stuff like this is fair game because it didn’t stop anyone from playing
---
I didn’t know you can down the killer in this game
---
Nah. It's the fact that they all bring toolboxes and there are about 3 gens done in the first 5 minutes. Probably does not help with the fact matchmaking is fucked and so I am matching rank 6+ at 14 killer.
---
I may not have all the terminology right, but, yes, I know what I have--- but a survivor might have perks, that I don't know what they are. That's what I mean.
---
I'll try reinstalling the game from scratch at this point, maybe during months and multiple patches something got messed up, idk. Everything is at the lowest possible anyway
---
Can't get banned for chaning the ini files
---
The people with no idea are the noisiest. Medium vault or fast vault affects hitbox. After you learn that, other scenarios  are lag.
---
Client sync issues. They've updated something and broken something else again lol. Been happening for a couple of days now, I just leave if im survivor.
---
I don’t get it but I agree
---
Literally nothing. I was on fence between killers and survivors until recently. Killers are definitely mostly made up of incel bags of shit who power-trip playing a game where they get to hurt but can't be hurt and then reee about it when they fall short of their own expectations. Been playing months and never have I ever seen so many fucking tryhards going out of their way to ruin everyone else's game. I'm not talking about people not farming, every single killer I've encountered is either deranked or bringing out their fucking A game and will DC on you 20% of the time if you do too well against them.
---
Right, still, kind of feel like if he supports it it’s eh... I took a look and he literally tweeted that there had been too many “unnecessary survivor nerfs” and like, boi, can tell you these were necessary.
---
20-30 fps on handheld, 15-25 docked, looks like how the game runs on low settings on PC, mass amounts of weird graphical errors that aren't present in the PC version, and a rank glitch where you can never get past rank 20 currently. This game needs patched ASAP.
---
Oh and hitching galore.
---
And still reportable and like, totally not endorsed by the devs. But at least take a moment to PM your survivors to see if they wanna farm.
---
They are salty little shitbricks who just want to fuck the survs out of as many BP as possible. They can't stand the idea of survivors benefiting from the event. It's been in about 1 in 5 games where we were winning. If we get down to 2 gens you can bet there's a chance the game will hop over to loading screen lol
---
Exactly
---
Those two and Dwight are the most obnoxious toxic players I’ve seen.
---
Yeah, I'm in now. Thanks.
---
This game runs like a dream on ps4 compared to what it runs like on Switch dude.
---
Not sure who you all have and this is just personal opinion but: 
---
Dwight - Worth It for Bond and PT
---
Meg - Worth It for Adrenaline
---
Claudette - Maybe eventually for SC
---
Jake - Maybe eventually for Iron Will
---
Nea - Worth It for BL
---
Laurie - Worth It for DS
---
Ace - Not Worth It
---
Bill - Worth It for BT and Unbreakable
---
Feng - Not Worth It
---
David - Maybe eventually for WGLF
---
Quentin - Not Worth It
---
Tapp - Not Worth It
---
Adam - Maybe eventually for Deliverance
---
Jeff - Not Worth It
---
Jane - Not Worth It 
---
Ash - Not Worth It
---
Nancy - Worth It for IS
---
Steve - Not Worth It 
---
Of course by “Not Worth It,” I mean I wouldn’t consider any of them urgent. If you’re a completionist like me, I’d just save them for later once you get the build you want. The only debatable one I’d say is David’s WGLF. That’s worth it if you don’t play killer. If you’re comfortable grinding points as killer, you can probably let it go. My favorite build right now is Bond, BL, Adrenaline, and Unbreakable.
---
Streamers are pure evil? Damn...back in my day it was Ebonies
---
they bought the license, i think they can just inject a new story with the entity without touching their previous background to not break legal stuff
---
T
---
They all just give points and useless stuff. If you can't see the last one it's a mori
---
Bro I play on PS4 and let me tell you it wasn't an exaggeration
---
He's not even short and he doesn't even have a peen.
---
Some tips I can offer: Have one or two people distracting the killer. Try and make sure that for the last generator, the open 3 gens you can do are all as spaced out as possible. Dedicate to the generator. Destroy the portals whenever possible. Basic stuff. If a killer, especially one as map pressure heavy as Demogorgon, is so determined to keep you guys in the game, then it's sort of tough luck unfortunately unless you're very strategic about how you play
---
For starts don't let that happen. It's understandable when it's 4 solos, but it's inexcusable when it's SWF.
---
Hello just dodge the lobby.
---
Yeah me too happened twice now.
---
Swear to god they break the most random shit every patch for no reason
---
Vommy mommy is good at stalling a game out if the survivors are afraid to get sick. Many games have slowly ended this way where I three gen and patrol and puke on every gen until someone touches one
---
Yeah it's bad
---
Welp not really. It feels cheap tho for how easy it is and how slot the camera movement is
---
They should increase the cap, even if it's set to 100 is slow af for both sides
---
Yup, sadly this is usually how most of the events have gone down for quite some time, event is implimented along with a hotfix patch, fkn the game up making lobbies longer and more bugs, ppl being more toxic (in general ofc) and games just usually being worse.
---
I have played the game long enough to know how to do my best just to enjoy the game but getting killed, tunneled and/or camped vs a sweaty omegablink nurse who just kills anyone on sight no matter how good they are resulting in no bp or fun for anyone except for the self-entitled "GOD NURSE WHO CLAPS EVERYONE" who's having a blast im sure.
---
Or playing killer vs a 4man who plays every game like it's a tourney when im not feeling like going full sweat mode or playing a killer I usually don't or running perks im messing around with then getting tbagged after they finish all gens in 2-3 mins, it's just more common for this to happen during bloodhunts / events sadly.
---
Sry for the wall of text :).
---
I haven't noticed any of that yet honestly.
---
The bloodweb is given its own lore (when you unlock the first one there's an entry from Baker's Journal detailing seeing the bloodweb while he rests at the campfire, so I think we can assume it's canon. 
---
It makes sense too, if you consider BP a reward from the entity, then the bloodweb is basically the entity's shop, where she only accepts her own cash, and you can buy things that make her happy. 
---
Sounds like a good deal for the entity really.
---
Sorry, but it seems we have very different tastes in horror. You can like 2007 remake ((I like it too as it’s own thing)), and I can like the 2018 sequel/reboot.
---
Claudette: HAHA GG EZ BABY KILLER
---
The Entity: lmao bitch you thought
---
The timer also wasn't bugged during that match...just an observation
---
Lol,  "MaDe Up SuRvIvOr RuLeS" but yet..  "DoN't BrInG a KeY oR i WiLl tUnNeL &amp; cAmP yOu." How about don't be a fucking hypocrite and play the game,  and don't punish people for YOUR made up rules? How the fuck does bringing a item encourage camping and tunneling? What because YOU personally don't like it,  but talk about survivor rules. How about put away your made up killer hand book and quit being a pussy? Run Franklin's to combat it and quit being toxic to people who run a key,  maybe surviviors should DC every time they see ruin because yanno they wanna do gens as fast as the can to escape and your running something that makes it take longer?

Because the mask is the iconic face
---
I’m on PS4 and killer queues are horrible. I waited for at least half an hour for a match, unfortunately I had no luck so I switched to survivor...
---
Rule 3.
---
Also he outplayed you, don’t be upset at anyone aside from your own inability to play well enough to collect enough blood points
---
Idk man did TrU3 beat the entirety of dark souls 2 including dlc without tak8ng a single hit?
---
Survivors like Syc and perfect make me not wanna play during DBP
---
Ebony mori isnt out playing survivors lmao.
---
I don't remember it only happening only when I've already rerolled - you could be right though. Just kinda sucks when I get the perfect daily for my main and then go to do it and come back with a "hit 4 people after nurse blinking" daily that I'm not going to be able to do lol
---
Normally I would remove a results post, but this is a huge milestone in any killer's career, it's up
---
I heard the Anti-hacker tool is acting against some Windows 10 users. Happens to a buddy of mine,  can't finish a match.
---
Aww we're on ps4 lol.. hope you play with better teammates in the future!
---
Yeah spirit’s backstory makes me sad.. she just wanted to be a good daughter
---
sure he outplayed me, as in run anal beads, get easy first hit, then shes obviously gonna catch up to you, cause shes spirit, I outplayed her in 2 loops however, wasted her time enough for 2 gens to get done. She downs me as i get unhooked. I get morid. yeah fun game.
---
It is when they're throwing up bnps and insta meds lmao
---
[removed]
---
How is it not lmao
---
If its a gen they keep coming back to or near completion, they think you're not around. Stalk and stab and kick
---
TTVs surviving with friends using instaheals. Let him kill you irl too pls.
---
This is what all gameplay on Switch feels like right now because of the "Rank 20 Hell" bug for those of us who are high rank on other platforms. 
---
My sweet summer children... please, follow me to safety as we navigate this minefield of 2000 Hour PC Rank 1 Nurse Mains and 0.5 hour Rank 20 Nintendo Switch Trappers that are all masquerading as Rank 20.
---
Nice name. 🤷‍♀️
---
Doesn’t GF’s ability get rid of his heartbeat tho?
---
Most of the OG killers were tortured I believe, trapper, wraith, nurse most definatly.
---
Yeah. It's a game...
---
If it's at its highest rank that takes quite a while and a killer with that and whispers can find you and down you in that time. It works especially well on Ghostface, if he plays it right he can potentially get two downs and hooks before a gen has even been touched.
---
Fun game? Then why are you crying on Reddit then lmao
---
????????????????????????????????????
---
I'm sitting over here, a sad console Boi with 10 fps
---
Don’t take it seriously I love Mcote but my comment got downvoted because people did not understand /s on reddit clearly xD
---
Yes. Usually they camp and tunnel.
---
So prayer beads, slugging, and an ebony mori on double BP isn't a dick move to you?
---
Can you not free a survivor from dropping a pallet on a killer anymore??
---
Hmm. Yeah I mean as I said, I'm still learning and it will take me extra time. I still maintain that I would like to be able to read why they are as the match loads. I mean, why even show them if they're just there for a hot second?
---
SWF intensifies
---
You can just spend $5 on cells for one character. If you’re asking yourself if its worth it, it probably isn’t to you.
---
Performance in games. Not the performance of the mac as a whole.
---
Well, you could wait until they're on sale. I'd say the Halloween dlc is definitely worth it personally considering the quality of the perks and how good the killer is
---
I like to run Stake Out, Streetwise, Plunder's and Pharmacy on my Feng Min, but I have a bunch of other combos on my other characters too. I treat every character like a different class.
---
I feel you. I play on PC/PS4/Xbox so many hours into so many of the same titles just to play with friends. Shit gets old quick.
---
Aye.
---
Did you like the chapter?
---
Holy shit why are you complaining about BNP which was nerfed to dust? Are you really that bad at killer?
---
I think it is completely fine on certain killers / when you're a new player, but a decent or good killer playing with noed when they clearly don't need it just grinds my gears.. 
---
Also u can't always just "cleanse totems and it's gone" if the killer is applying alot of pressure you either do gens to have a chance of escaping or waste x amount of seconds finding, cleansning all totems, that's not easy unless you're a 4man / have perks or items helping you find totems...
---
Also I do agree with you on the killer side, it's rly frustrating just trying to enjoy the game and you get 4 ppl playing the game like it's a tournament and just play everything to near perfection (look up "not otzdarvas" depressing clown game, good example of this), then getting tbagged like yeah, u 4 found eachother and learned the game, and now what, you just pubstomp and tbag every lobby u get into? I get it, it's their way of having fun and not everyone cares about other people but cmon man... some respect is due.
---
never said I wanted to farm? where are you guys pulling this shit from. I just hate when killers put on sweaty builds when its a time for everyone to have fun and gather points, they can still kill you its fine, but tunneling you when you get off the hook so they can mori you? especially when they are already playing an S tier killer, with her best addons.
---
I think it's worth it if you play killer. If you like one or more of the movies it's pretty cool to play as the character from them.
---
I mean, it is just people airing out their frustrations in a game that stills lacks optimization and seems to break things every patch.
---
I would venture on the side of it being understandable that there is always at least one person who is gonna say it. It is just how it is.
---
If you were banned, it'd say "You've been banned" So I dunno why you said you were banned.
---
Damn Champion for that long message. This'll help met lots. Appreciate it!!
---
I always feel like the white cat at the table meme when I get DS'ed by one of four identical injured swf Claudettes because I KNOW on mic they're probably like "THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR TUNNELING" when in reality I just can't tell them apart.
---
why are you barely replying to this?
---
Oh had no idea about that. Thank you! Miss Cowgirl it is
---
Thanks.

My discord name meg best girl
---
&gt;Killers are definitely mostly made up of incel bags of shit who power-trip playing a game where they get to hurt but can't be hurt and then reee about it when they fall short of their own expectations.    
---
    
---
What is it with you and calling killers incels every other comment? And a majority of people that play killer do it because of the blood points or simply having fun, not because of "muh power-trip fantasy" or to vent their supposed incel anger.    
---
&gt;Been playing months and never have I ever seen so many fucking tryhards going out of their way to ruin everyone else's game.    
---
Define tryhard. Is it only the people who run insta-saws, omega blinks, or prayer beads? Or are you going to just omit the multiple syringes, haddonfield offerings paired with balanced landing, and other equally shitty things survivors can do? Running OP shit and being a 'tryhard' are fine, adding harassing messages, BM outside of psychological mindgames, and other toxic things is what makes the difference between a survivor/killer that plays optimally and a survivor/killer that is a complete cunt.    
---
&gt;I'm not talking about people not farming, every single killer I've encountered is either deranked or bringing out their fucking A game and will DC on you 20% of the time if you do too well against them.    
---
Same thing can be said about survivors, yellow/white ranks from purposeful deranking, or bringing the meta with either a Commodious+BNP or a Syringe, and then DC'ing the moment they aren't able to bully the killer or if a low tier killer is able to start snowballing in the early game.
---
Because shock value is abundant these days even though most have long since turned into Spongebob in that flying dutchman meme.
---
Fine. I'll do it myself.
---
10/10 good art
---
Also just so you know, if you pause the game, you can hover over all the offerings again and see them.
---
Sometimes i feel like I ought to run kindred just so i don't end up with all three people dropping everything to run across the map.
---
Thank you! I didn't know this, that's very helpful. Thanks.
---
I resurrect the dead comments.  I am the Chapter 14 killer, the Necromancer.
---
Lol I can literally see the comments you deleted in your profile. What a goddamn loser. So you're a liar as well as a pussy. Figures.
---
r/evenwithcontext
---
The survivor and killer have the exact same thoughts in that moment
---
Nice going
---
Highest toxicity playing as a killer for me is: **Laurie**, Meg, Feng Min, and David.
---
Lowest toxicity are: Tapp, Adam, Steve, and Jeff. Those players seem to just want to mind their business and stay in their lane.
---
I have clips of me getting chased for 5-10 minutes at a time and no one manages top do shit
---
It was really bad, even on Xbox One X, before they started optimizing and updating the game. Now it's the closest to PC version. Which I also have and can run at ultra settings. It's not RDR, but this game does look really good for what it does. You're just playing it on much weaker hardware.
---
thats a big f bro and I'm on PC, so it's broken for everyone I guess
---
Only if you do it to hold the game hostage
---
It's pretty easy. Just practice with skillchecks
---
Day after the hot fix released I had this happen every survivor match I loaded into.. haven’t seen it since.
---
Still better than the real dbd's graphic, seriously, that 2015 game has some of the worst graphic ever, even a 2004 game has better graphic lmao
---
what?
---
"I want to play a game."
---
"Sure, you a Smash Bros or Mario Party kind of gal?"
---
First of all, put a space after commas and periods. Secondly, I'm not even a pig main, I'm a Freddy main. Third, Amanda's dead in the saw universe so there's no way that last thing is happening
---
What glitch?
---
Or just buff WGLF to actually be useful.
---
I haven't deleted a single one, but alright my guy
---
This literally makes me even more upset. What a waste of double bloodpoints when you get kicked from the game. It makes me not even want to attempt playing
---
The countdown timer is wrong on the survivor's end. It shows them as still having like 30+ seconds left when the timer ends.
---
N.,o.,
---
will we jump to where we need to be or do we start over? Also seems like you cant complete escape quests because theres a bug that says the killer DCs when the match is over.
---
Fukkin LOL'D! 
---
Have my +1, damn you.
---
too blurry cant tell
---
Sook some more, not everyone needs to confine to your stupid rules, let them play how they want without making a deal about it.
---
Since when? I have been playing survivor the bulk of the blood hunt and I haven't experienced this "on the survivors" end
---
I just want games to take longer because I play Pig and it takes years to get from one area of the map to the next compared to Billyboi, Spirit and Nurse.
---
So who's deleted them? Because they are definitely deleted.
---
only toxic thing here is how you couldn’t just take a screenshot
---
Alright, since your lack of social skills prevents you from understanding how not to be an ass I'll give you an answer. The shit you've been doing this whole time is toxic, teabagging is toxic, flaming killers *or*survivors with post game chat, throwing the game, disconnecting, spamming flashlights or camping. There's a decent list for you.
---
And STILL downvoting my comments! Lmao. Get a life! Hahaha. You really are fucking stupid. Do you even have triple digit IQ?
---
Cant upload to reddit from xbox one bro
---
demo stomps like a little babby
---
Truth hurts.
---
Self-explanatory.
---
True to a much much lesser extent. 1 to 100.
---
It just doesn't feel worth my time to sit around for half an hour at even mid ranks just to get a killer game. I can't do any fun builds or suboptimal plays. It's horrific. I can't even afford to dodge a lobby if it's a SWF squadette or some stupidly high ping. I don't even factor in what I can earn from playing.
---
Idk, mods? But none of them have been deleted by me, I still see them fine.
---
But you can send it to a picture *bro*
---
It was like that. Then they changed it for reasons
---
I can what the what now
---
Buy her cosmetic instead then
---
Just browse this subreddit and you will see SEVERAL examples. It's happened to me as survivor AND killer.   It's a very common bug since the update.
---
how is one purple insta heal and a shit brand new part bad get gud
---
Do you ever need NoEd here? Wouldn’t anything be better since you shouldn’t get to endgame with this build
---
Aka latency
---
Screenshot, get the app and then download the shot...
---
Yeah it's the new The Game. Horribly one sided.
---
My smol brain didnt think of this
---
Honestly at this point I'm starting to think you're underage, because you don't seem to understand reddiquette in not spamming my comments nor do you seem to understand acceptable behavior in social interactions, so I'm just gonna go? Have fun raging to yourself about that "sick pedo" that doesn't like toxicity in his video games.
---
Happens about 1 in 20 games for me. Once had my save files come into question and scared the shit out of me.
---
What does the Key even do?
---
if that’s the case, I don’t wanna see a single killer cry when they face 4swf w BL + haddonfield map offering, and instaheals on double bloodpoint weekend.
---
All is good, I only found out about 2 months ago too
---
How is an ebony and prayer beads bad get gud
---
Well im deleting this post then. Farewell citizen
---
ebony and prayer beads aren't anything like those
---
I salute you
---
This situation is perfectly summed up by my most used, and eloquent phrase when I partake in the role of a killer, *"what else was I supposed to do?"* 
---
*"bUT cAmpINg bAD"*, says the strawman toxic/salty survivor. Being the reputable killer main I am, I graciously inform them that their folly caused this camping business to begin in the first place, despite my unheard protests, for a killer is unable to communicate while in the practice of killing. So being unable to communicate what tom foolery their supposed "altruism" will bring, I do as I must, for even the most Savage to the most gentleman like of killers, like my ilk, understands the great reward that comes out of this situation, a situation the survivors can change, but a situation I cannot change without drastic and impairing means. After I thoroughly explain this, l leave on a powerfully put, "GG," as to avoid the kind of retorts that no decent man has to stand for.
---
Simple, do all three gens at once, they cant apply enough pressure for all of them, even if they are in a tight little triangle
---
He took back the time you borrowed for your friend
---
No... he didn’t pepehands
---
They're all strong you have a survivor bias.
---
Killer runs good stuff = bad
---
Survivor runs good stuff = good?
---
Shitting on killers for running good shit while saying its fine if survivors do is dumb.
---
Hey dude, next time you decide to challenge someone on a comment they made...be prepared to have actual fucking evidence or else you're gonna look stupid. Don't back out like this pussy shit you've pulled today. Be a fucking adult like you claim to be.
---
how are Brand new parts string
---
ahhhh. Then hopefully they approve bhvr's ideas?
---
50 seems a bit faster than I thought. That’s interesting to know though
---
If I was the Meg I would've straight up uninstalled
---
It does 15% of a gen in 5 seconds...
---
Its a gen rush add-on...
---
i feel its very survivor-sided? unless its just the matchmaking issues that made me suck on it
---
My guess is that it acts as an “oh shit, plan b” for this person if the survs do manage to power the gates
---
Oof
---
complaining about brand new parts and thinking they are strong christ your a baby
---
Well my comments probably deserve to be deleted more than yours. Hell, I've been trying to get you as angst as you seem to be when you're talking to your pedo pals but clearly the mods think your calm but witty retorts /s are worth deleting. I think not. I didn't come down in the last shower and you're a fucking liar. Facts over feelings, like you said ;)
---
i don't know why it's taking them so long to address this. my strategy may help though: just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. don't down them after u already hooked them. that just slows down the match. for perks use BBQ, Distressing, Nurse vision, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i'd never play any other way.
---
How do you know it wasn't?  Legit question. 
---
And why the downvotes?  Also legit question.
---
How did you get 450k? Highest bloodpoints possible is around 250k in one match. 32k plus 32000 times 5 plus 64k for bloodhunt and barbecue stacks.
---
I try and farm but survivors don’t get it and keep running so I just play normally
---
That is horrible. why, so weak killer mains can dodge a lobby even easier.? I'm a 60% killer, 40% survivor player and even I think this idea is horrible.  According to DBD's stats they released in a dev stream, SWF only survive at a 7% (I think...it was single digit) greater rate. Seems to me that some killers use SWF as an excuse for losing a match, instead of blaming themselves. When I lose, typically survivors play optimally,  I made a mistake somewhere (chasing a survivor too long), I got legitimately outplayed, or the map and RNG favored the survivors.  Rarely is it because of SWF (Though at red ranks , it does happen occasionally).
---
How are ebony moris strong?
---
The clown too. He saw the mist was just like "well, time to wing it."
---
Is that the t0x1v v01cr c0mm3 I sE3

They are killers, but everyone thinks they are survivors. Missing a skill check injures people lol
---
Or multiple dailies. Maybe you have two daily’s but they only last 24 hrs

You have to unlock the teachables before they show up in the blood web
---
BBQ and chili is a perk on Leatherface you would have to unlock him and progress his bloodweb to lv 40 to get all his teachables
---
Honestly... Just do skill checks...
---
Honestly, my biggest issue is certain players, both survivor and killer,  forget they are playing real people on the other end. They become so fixated on certain aspects of the game that they dislike, they overlook the fact that they are actually pissed off at the game mechanics and transfer that negativity to the opposing player(s). I used to fall victim of this until I decided that I can be the one to break the cycle. Get facecamped by leatherface...give him a gg after the match. Get genrushed and looped all game, give the survivors a gg anyways. In doing so, you have not allowed the anger and animosity to transfer from the opposing player(s) to you. If they start to get toxic, wish them a good night and close the end game screen. This is how you kill the cycle of toxicity that exists in this game.
---
Oooooooh Ik thanks
---
Yeah, it’s always hard for me when I go across the nap and just as I get there someone unhooks, making me sneak across again for the gen.

More misinformed and lucky I guess. I have not had this problem in game yet. And failed to see it being posted online even here. But wrong is wrong and undeserved is undeserved and I thought it was funny and that I somehow got them but only because this game is so... Perfect and unbroken LOL
---
Considering shed like to destroy your dreams id think shed go for that mario party
---
Not to be that guy but it’s they’re trash
---
Ah gotcha. Ya I play PC and occasionally Ps4 with my friends.
---
A fair point, and also we can both play as Laurie and Michael in the hot video game *Dead by Daylight*
---
Unless you don’t know what you’re doing, the maps super killer sided.  Billy/nurse/huntress are the only killers I imagine that have trouble with their power. but even then billy and huntress can easily destroy because all the weak pallets.
---
Had a jake trying to hide the game in a locker. I'm injured right beside him doing a gen and he comes out of the locker and I thought sweet I can get healed and we can do the gen together.
---
Nope goes over to the adjacent locker and climbs on. Let's me complete gen myself so just waited for killer to show and pointed at locker. He put me in dying state then grabbed him but totally worth it.
---
Jake then gets hooks and fast track kills himself. Was so funny
---
BBQ is a teachable perk from the Cannibal, you have to get him level 30-40 to unlock the teachable then you can get it on other killers. Or you can get it through the shrine of secrets sometimes
---
True, yeah it's been all over. I got undeserved kills a couple times from it myself. Was kinda funny bc it was a teabagging toxic Claudette :p yep every update they break something new!
---
stop embarrassing yourself, you make us killer mains sound like babies. BPS is in no way STRONG, it literally gets disposed after one use, survivors can make better use out of speed and charge addons. They last longer, do a bigger impact, you get to use them if you survive with the item. good day, cheers.
---
yeah, im sorry, its not outright SHIT, i do however think of how its 'shit' to make it all about the memes...
---
but then again, thats how fortnite got popular and im sure thats what DbD devs would love to have their game's popularity boom with memes and crap like that.
---
horror games should be about horror. Not tripping a killer, parkouring over some pallets, then hittin a sick dab followed by a floss at the map exit...
---
They're killers though. However they always accident kill people. Their attack is them tripping and hitting people. When they carry a survivor to a hook (with tucke/dale propping the survivor up instead of on the shoulder) , the survivor accident jumps themselves onto the hook. Their morie is the survivor falling down and breaking their neck or something. First killers to be VERY vocal. 
---
"Hey, you know where we are?"
---
"Oh man, are you okay? Didn't mean to hit you!"
---
"These teenagers out here killin themselves on my land!"
---
Fair enough
---
Can't watch those, not even using a VPN to see as if I was in the US.
---
Ok, in order, best to least, colors are red, purple, green, yellow, beige
---
Ranks reflect this. No perks ever red, only items, and even so, pretty sure only addons are
---
Imagine playing in 2019 and still thinking SWF is cheating, grow up. get good
---
Why mori him tho? Shouldve morried the feng
---
I lost two completed dailys at once a couple days ago on the PS4. Seems like there’s always a plethora of bugs at all times. Love the game but man it’s frustrating.
---
At least the game has safe pallets LMAO.  The design is fckn sick and I love the feeling of the map but my god is it shitty as survivor
---
She’s a killer tho so like
---
Chunky isn’t gonna be a killer u dumb fuck he’s to damn small
---
Technically the house is above the lair from the first saw, they took this location and the (mentioned in name only) Gideon meat packing plant and smashed them together for the map *The Game*
---
The vaults are very unsafe, not just the pallets.
---
Everyone. Leather face and Freddy are not in the game on switch so BBQ and chilli doesn't exist for now. It will probably added as a regular perk later down the line you can unlock without having to level a specific killer
---
Vigo's Part would counter BBQ pretty hard.
---
Switch doesn't have leatherface or Freddy atm. But it was said his perks were in the game as bills was for console at first.
---
Moments like this and when you help a Hag get points is deafening with a headset. At least you got a great laugh :)
---
Isnt he not on the switch? Thats what I heard. Him &amp; Freddy. So Both should just be random perks and youre just getting unlucky, + theres no way you have ALL the killer perks at t3 at level 46.
---
i think there would be too many shotgun shells, how about rare addon adds 1 and the very rare adds 2? just a suggestion, i think it would be a bit too OP
---
Honestly I kind of like it this way. Could be a big surprise for people teabagging at the gate too long
---
Bruh, you need a hug or something.
---
See that why I do half a gen *before* running for a save. If someone saved them, hey sweet half a gen is done and I'm probably safe to finish it. If they aren't saved, the killers probably after someone and I'm safe to run and vault straight to the person and they wont have enter the next phase yet hopefully.
---
Yet you have no proof of the "truth" that supposedly hurts, you just repeat the general phrase of "killers are incels because they're tryhards" with different wording each time you say it, yet I have proof in the form of PS messages, and all but 2 of the DMs I have received are from survivors who just act like an asshole for no reason other than the fact that they either escaped or died/DC'd.
---
I find Michael with M&amp;A, Infectious fright, ruin or something else to slow the game down like maybe corrupt intervention and STBFL to be really fun and effective personally
---
I cant get this image out of my head... headphones and all
---
The bar is bugged for survivors lately. Doesn't happen every game but it's pretty common ATM. You still get the three sound effects at 1:30, 1:00, and 0:30, so you have to work off that.
---
I’d rather sound like a teenage girl than be a dude in my 30s that doesn’t believe in climate change.
---
Wouldn't the crows show up and let the killer know they were in the locker?
---
Ad hominem bait, and it works like a charm
---
Huh thats strange. I play ps4 too and I normally only wait a minute or two max. Usually hanging around rank 2-6. Then again, I think there are less killers the higher up the ranks you go. I assume thats what it is.
---

The same crack as the community manager apparently.
---
[Dc,ing is one of the bannable offenses](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system#latest)

But what does she know right? Not like she's the lead community managers of the company who owns the game and also happens to be the exact person to handle these sorts of things.
---
I would assume so. Im hanging around rank 4 and it usually takes me only a minute or two.

---
To punish the killer I guess
---
Yeah, that's weird af. The devs are missing some perks in there.
---
Thought it was just me wow. Legit all these bug posts that have come up lately I can vouch for. Games been quite a mess since ST Chapter.
---
New players?
---
I've seen long wait times for killer on pc it it do seem to suck, but on Xbox at least it's managble.  I've been making anywhere from 80-120k a games as killer and since the event I've went from rank 12 too rank 7 and haven't waited over 5min to find a match it's great and way more effective (of course with bbq)
---
Haha true it's kinda our fault should of left that Laurie on the hook we got her off and she was gone lol.
---
Runs at a constant 30 fps for me ;)
---
At first I thought you teleported into a trap after escaping.
---
That's what I was thinking... Thought I was crazy at first. I don't REALLY need it honestly I just wanted the bloodpoints lol XD.
---
Dont know how, maybe it was a glitch.
---
You’re not wrong
---
A libcuck wants to be like the opposite gender? Shocking stuff right there. The climate will always be changing. If humans are responsible for all of climate change (which they're not), then maybe Greta should go bother countries with the most air pollution like India and china. By the way, I'm not 30 yet. Have a nice day lady boy.
---
I never claimed to be scared by him.
---
But your entire spheel about him having no plan is ridiculous because that's the point. He's not some mastermind with a plan and worrying about getting caught.
---
He's just a vessel for death. He doesn't care what happens. He is just there to kill as many people as possible.
---
If you don't like Myers that's fine. No ones saying you need to.
---
But that IS his character whether you personally like it or not. He's an empty emotionless void of a person and Evil Incarnate. He operates solely on killing. No other thought entertains him.
---
squishy noises
---
When the bar hasn't budged in 30 seconds you know something is wrong. Just leave.
---
That's still really weird.
---
If he doesn’t care I don’t care
---
Lol yikes
---
Yeah that and I’m having issues inviting people to my party too.
---
I feel like we may have to just start over unfortunately but who knows.
---
Do what I do. Bring a gaming laptop to the office and queue up at work. When you get in, count it as your break. You get to play and don't feel like you're wasting time in queue because you're still working.
---
Yeah, and the killer did eventually find them, but not til after going after the rest of us.
---
I mean, I’ve been trying to play survivor now for almost an hour. I’m still “connecting”...
---
Basically the plot of the movie is, two socially awkward hillbillies (Tucker and Dale) buy a cabin in the woods to renovate and turn into a vacation home.
---
A group of teens go out camping in the same woods and through a series of complete misunderstandings, the teens think Tucker and Dale are killing their friends, while Tucker and Dale think the teens are in a suicide pact trying to kill themselves "all over their property".
---
Hi-jinks ensue. The two links I posted are Tucker accidentally sawing into a Hornets nest with a chainsaw and running around/flailing with it with the kids thinking he's standard running after them with it, and the other one is Tucker throwing wood into a wood chipper, a teen tries to push him in it, but Tucker ducks just in time for the teen to accidentally throw himself into the chipper. Tucker tries to pull him out, but to the rest of the onlooking teens, it looks like he's feeding him into the chipper.
---
Cool dude Meg managed to dodge so many hits, and then idiot Nea threw it all away.
---
Not saying he’s going to be, it’s just an idea. If you read the post title, you’d see that.
---
Yeah, same here. I just ditched it for now.
---
&gt; Dc,ing is one of the bannable offenses
---
Yeah, just about as bannable as going 5 miles of the speed limit is illegal.
---
It's not enforced, there's not bans for it.
---
Only if we get a sweater for Ash as well.
---
You can shut the fuck up
---
To sum it all up neatly. 
---
* There are two kinds of perks, normal (available to everyone) and teachable (available to a single survivor).
---
* Teachable perks can be unlocked (to make them like normal perks and appear for everyone) by leveling your character and purchasing the teachable version. These unlock at level 30, 35 and 40. If you want a specific perk, you can check which level it unlocks at (Self Care is claudette's level 40 perk, for example). 
---
* To even things out (and prevent certain perks from being paywalled), there is the Shrine of Secrets. This makes 4 perks (2 killer, 2 survivor) available for purchase with iridescent shards (the player level currency). It changes weekly, and purchasing the perk through this method will circumvent having to level the character, and allows you to get DLC exclusive perks. 
---
* Perks come in various colours, these denote rarity. It doesn't affect the perk itself, just it's likely hood of appearing. The colours (for everything, add ons, items, perks and offerings) are brown (common), yellow (uncommon), green (rare), purple (very rare), and red (ultra rare). 
---
* Perks all have 3 tiers. These tiers are what denote the perks level, with tier III having better effects (more aura reveal time, higher stack caps, etc). The tier of a perk can be checked by looking at the white strikes on the top-rigjt side of the perk. Each stripe denotes a tier. 
---
If you have any more questions let me know.
---
No,make it to where we can lob a fucking semtex at them
---
Love that he stepped on his own trap
---
They need to lower the volume of his footsteps. I can't hear shit playing him. I don't even think stridor would help. This shit is louder than the chase music.
---
agreed we need sweaters for everyone who doesn’t have one yet!
---
Bruh why the hostility?
---
Yeah I understand you're frustration, Mine turned into a Killer daily too but it was at least on Myers who i like playing quite a bit
---
Never stay at the escape gate, i did it againts a myers then i got tombstoned like 1m away from escaping. I deserved it...
---
Gens Done Quick
---
Killer mains downvote this
---
Rank 1 survivor is miserable too, just Spirit &amp; Nurses still, playing maximum sweat.

It can open the hatch. The broken ones can be used for seeing auras.

How does the game run on Switch?
---
Have fun with that.
---
is there a way you could make the insta-down perks ultra rare? (e.g: NOED, Devourer Hope, make your choice) so when ever it pops up on your screen it's like "oh sh\*t!" xD
---
That's a damn shame.
---
Same. He just has a “Fuck it. Why not?” attitude
---
The power is really unique and the perks are pretty cool. I’m a little scared of how high the chances to scream get up to, but I suppose since it’s a hex perk it balances out. Nice job!
---
If survivors do not unhook baby Dwight the killer is allowed to ignore all other rules in order to kill and punish survivors
---
Yes.
---
once u see a secret offering...leave the match....now its ur choice not to go against this sh:t (it takes u literally 3-5 seconds to dodge).....u cant imagine how many try hard builds with red addons and an ebony i avoided during the bloodhunt
---
You know her last name is Yamaoka right?
---
Recently got a 31,900 game at 70 hours in 😔
---
He was rank 7 haha
---
I mean I’m not unhappy about being placed with the 4/8 but the yellow ranks that’s where it’s a little, man I feel bad :(
---
No one is gonna run that, because everyone knows it's a waste of good materials on a weekend where you supposed to relax and enjoy without worrying about how many bloodpoints you earn, except for a few idiots, such as the killer in your screenshot
---
Except the timer is still the same time, you just dont see it going.
---
They said they did... they also said they fixed multi killer matches. Turns out their words and patch notes mean fuck all
---
Is this why, aside from being ugly as shit, the whole "Nea's a Killer" thing is a Meme here?
---
Sitting at the gate is the best option for survivors if they can't find the hatch in the vicinity.
---
Yea it was super obvious the timer was not working. I honestly don't get people that BM like this.
---
It’s bizarre that you’re so upset about someone who cares about the environment. Is bizarre the right word? It might be pathetic actually.
---
They just don't know or they're still learning ,
---
No stress bud. I'm reasonably new myself so it's all fresh info for me, happy to help pass it on.
---
I stopped playing for a bit because of this. I’d always try to go all iridescents trying to get out of those ranks so I can get a little challenge, all I ended up doing is going ham on some poor dweets and a baby Jake
---
I get mad at those nurses but I remember most sweaty, cynical nurses are just disappointed wraithes
---
Don't know why you got down voted. The survivor timer could be bugged but we wouldn't know because we are seeing the killers timer which isn't.
---
Ok bro, have fun getting mad at a party game.
---
I started doing a gen right away, and 2 other survivors sat there tea bagging as i was doing it so I thought the match was going to go much worse than it did so I appreciate it!
---
Oh, thanks. This looks like a pretty funny movie, I wonder what their perks could be in game.
---
This is amazing.  Lol
---
Stfu
---
Long wait times in general. They should roll back a month to what was working.
---
Dead Hard through the trap
---
ya
---
Check out noob3 video on YouTube about 360ing
---
Yep, and the same can be done with killers. The beauty of survivors is that you can essentially use a survivor just as a skin with a multitude of perk matchups while on killer you have a unique power. You can have a Meg play like a Dwight, Nancy play like a Steve, etc. 
---
As you look up stuff on YouTube or in countless threads here, you’ll see that there are certain perk metas people run on survivors and killers, but the game is what you want your character to be. You can make a build where you are literally one shot the whole game but could add on perks that buff you when you are in that injured state. 
---
As the game gets more content, more opportunities to make more builds arise.
---
At least I think there's a Harpo. If there isn't, there should be
---
InB4 people who can't handle a single joke meme at their expense thus proving the point of the meme.
---
My theory is that Laurie was originally snatched by herself and Michael somehow tagged along without the entity knowing until he one day ended up in a trial while chasing Laurie.
---
Yeah the inconsistencie was causing me to no doubt put some noobs off from this game, but when I'm coming of three in a row against purples and reds and you are 17-20 unfortunately you are gonna have a bad time.
---
i didn’t get banned just somehow the files got corrupted, but it was talking about ban
---
I got fucksx over by a pig like that last night lol
---
Cool. For me, my files started becoming corrupted after I install the PTB. I had to completely uninstall the game for that to stop.
---
Some killers can force out a 3-gen from the start. I'm a doctor main who typically runs the 3-gen build and literally my first initial thought when I spawn in is where the "best" 3-gen is. I then defend the 3-gen more vigorously to ensure if it comes down to one gen left, I have my "ideal" 3-gen setup. 
---
I mean survivors can definitely 3-gen themselves but if a killer (especially Doctor) is playing defensively there's very little survivors can do.

Any spirit tips? I need to know how to end chases faster.
---
oh, just had to verify and redo the files
---
Well you're literally the only person on console to day some shit like that. It's a known fact that the framerate is horrible and the sensitivity is slow. No matter what you say the turning speed is bad.
---
But it will happen again when they update.
---
Can't wait for dedicated servers just for people like you
---
The thing is trapper traps are already tracked with the rainbow map and the red twine yellow addon
---
no i mean i didn’t like do the thing again i just verified my files
---
Ah that's right, sorry it's been forever since I marathoned the series, I should do that again.
---
Do the broken vaults eventually get fixed? Can survivors repair them?
---
I understand your sentiment but I think a ranking system is necessary. I mean, you've probably done it yourself where red ranks against a level 10+ killer is just not fair and you feel guilty.
---
At rank 1 though yeah it's not a fun time. Every game is Spirit for me and it just sucks the fun out of it to get sliced out of nowhere with prayer beads.
---
I loved it. It showed he movie actually had stakes in it. Too many movies are just too soft and any thriller or horror is basically a comedy. (I actually wish they had took some of the jokes out of the movie and kept with a more horror vibe instead of a comedy with a side of horror)
---
Right? I don’t know I think if they are going to keep ranks at least reward us for them
---
I think i'll shamefully try this on Myers map now, just to see if it works
---
Valid point! I just really enjoy dicking around so farming is a fun way to break the monotony/toxicity of the game.
---
There is some sort of bug happening where the timer is like lagging or something too
---
Not at all. That seems to be (maybe) 5% of my games. I put in about 15-20 hours on ps4 a year or two ago amd enjoyed it but for some reason I'm really getting into it more on Switch
---
Question, is body blocking two survivors in the basement and keeping them there until the remaining two repair the remaining gens and initiate egc, just for the two trapped to die in the end. Thats technically holding the game hostage right?
---
Mask: Split Screen
---
\- Pieces of a mask roughly stitched together so the hunt can continue.
---
Body: Smash Boy
---
\- Working at the mine left little time for games, but he managed to play a few of his own.
---
Weapon: Switched Cleaver
---
\- A synthetic frame molded for a controlled and powerful slash.
---
I'm at the spot where at rank 1, if I go against a mid or low tier killer I have fun. It's a competitive match, usually two people die, and I pip. That's where I like the game.
---
Then half the games are spirit or nurse or billy and they get a 4k because rank 1 killers will just pull apart solo players with those three killers. Tough spot for BHVR to be honest.
---
I've gone backwards, I loved playing spirit and hillbilly when I was new and around rank 20 - 16 but the more I explored and tried the other killers legion has become one of my favourite killers and I plan on trying to take him to red ranks (if I ever get there) xD
---
Lol yes it is bull but that's why you shouldve left dude it's been bugged since the patch
---
Instead of the shape he would be the shade
---
I've yet to me another green/purple rank after hitting level 6. I get matched up with continuous level 13's and 20's. Now I get some people are learning how to play the game, and sure, I don't mind. But please BHVR, at least pair me up with one other person who knows what they're doing
---
Yeah didn't realize I havnt checked Reddit in forever. Had it coming tho tbh
---
That’s funny, every time I get into a surv match I’m with potatos and an absolutely unforgiving killer xD deranked twice in the past 24 hrs.  Sometimes I wait it out with the nurse for some sweet revenge (and usually about 70k), survs I’m lucky to get 10k this bloodhunt
---
Worst matchup I’ve ever had was one of each except beige
---
It's almost like 360ing isn't intentional game design 🤔
---
When I played killer I also played that way. I also didn't play against a 4 person SWF group every match either. I used Myers, OG Freddy and then Spirt as I preferred the stealth approach. But it worked. But that was also dependent on the map and where they spawned. So luck does come into play. 
---
However, there's a huge difference when playing solo vs SWF as a survivor and it's much easier to for a survivor to dictate the gens when everyone can communicate the killers position etc... Even with a 3-gen setup.
---
Steve uses the unknown Cheeky perk.
---
Bro lol. You do realize the reason nurse is never seen on console is because of the framerate and sensitivity right? She's not viable on Xbox or Playstation
---
Some say hes still waiting for a game
---
k well i’ll be the nonhostile replier. good idea. not meta or anything but good for bp :)
---
What rank are you
---
Anytime I've filled out bubba's bloodweb, since I main him, the game offers me all the perks for bubba's basement before anything else and gives me more ebony moris than any other killer I play. It's like the game wants me to camp and Mori everyone when I play bubba but I just want those tasty chainsaw downs
---
From expierience I can say that my hopes and dreams always get crushed soooo, hold on them for me so it doesn't get crushed XD
---
Exactly this. Doc and Plague require a bit more precision and the frame issues their abilities cause make them lose a bit of their advantage. In Doc's case especially, he can only use his power to stop certain windows or pallets. He doesn't gain much distance by shocking at small loops because of the stutter causing you to get caught on scenery or rotate wide. 
---
I don't understand why turning feels so janky on console when other games have really smooth aiming.
---
Then you'll just end up being slugged to death.
---
Tell that to r/dbdgonewild
---
Wait, is double blade Legion still a thing?
---
Wait, they’re not the killers?
---
Maybe in your alternate universe. However, in reality, less people need to be using the same pallet.
---
You definately dont need any of those. Ruin is the only one you can argue for. Now with the Dying Light change it can be a great game slow down, especially coupled with curropt intervention or even sloppy butcher.
---
Whispers/discordance are a great alternative to bbq for information. And I dont usually run NOED, unless I have alot of shitty games and I feel like I could use it.
---
If you haven't learn how to use whispers properly, its an absolute game changer.
---
No
---
I think the reason they did it so it's emblem based is so you can't just take an ebony Mori in and kill everyone on first hook to get adept, though they do need to rework the emblem system at least a little since it seems very survivor sided
---
Awe man I can’t stop laughing.
---
Just split up... Youre making it easier for the killer if you're together, now he has 3 people busy instead of just one.
---
Perks that slow the game a bit ruin, thanatophobia, dying light. But you need to work for dying light, be super good managing your time for thanatophobia. Ruin its 100% working since the beginning of the match. It's up to you
---
Question about splinters! I got one for the pig and I’m currently using it but is it supposed to be good for one round? I’ve been playing pig for about an hour and haven’t bought her, just using the offering and it hasn’t switched me back. I understand why the newer characters aren’t offered through splinters but wow it would be such a cool addition, I’m definitely going to buy pig after trying her out ! Also should i try Ghostface, Legion, or Demigorgan next?
---
Holding the game hostage is very specifically preventing the game from progressing.
---
Slugging and waiting for them to bleed out isn't preventing the game from progressing (since the game will eventually end), but blocking someone in a room and not letting them move is because you're preventing the survivor from doing anything.
---
Ooooor you can wake up using one of the three methods available. Just a silly suggestion
---
I got a bluray set of the uncut ones. Now I just need Jigsaw.
---
Yah like you people at BhVR are gonna ban anyone on PSN! That’s laughable!
---
It’s luck based it could last 20 seconds or 5 minutes
---
PS4MouseToController let's you do this. I love that game
---
Are perks still showing up in your bloodweb since you have all the base perks already or is it only add-ons and offerings?
---
“What’s your name”
---
Ah the ole "Fuck You" ward offering...
---
Yupp that's another one
---
0/10 didn’t do creepy breathing 
---
For real though nice job
---
I honestly cant tell what you mean by that, but dope username none the less. Ebb and flow my dude
---
No. The definition of holding the game hostage is stopping either side from being able to complete their objectives for an extended period of time beyond 15 minutes. This used to be possible before the EGC but no longer is a thing because of it. The match will end.
---
Your team is doing gens and leaving which initiates the EGC. Therefore, the game wasn't held hostage since the match moved forward. The killer was just getting a cheesy ass kill at your expense. 
---
Sometimes I do this when I'm bored. I only manage to trap 1 person in the corner of something then go get some food and wait for the match to end while they die as I stare at the sky.
---
I’ve been hearing a weird humming noise, some games it’s their and some games it’s not. Has happened with different killers and different maps. Thought I was hearing shit but it’s there and very odd.
---
This is how me and my friends do it. I search for ruin because I can't hit skill checks, one of us gets looped, and hopefully my friend and the random are doing gens.
---
thank you for your help 👍

Actually I’m having something similar, except we aren’t allowed to start the actual game. Not sure what’s happening.
---
Huehue, demogorgon? More like demolish pallets
---
America does more per capita than India and China combined.
---
Skill based match making is absolutely necessary for this game. I consistently hit rank 1 as a survivor, and when I play yellow and lower killers there’s a noticeable difference and they don’t stand a chance of actually catching me.
---
To be fair this stuff runs on a macro and it would be a lot harder to detect than you might realize. For example for shits and giggles I made one as an experiment for nurse that teleports around the map and slashes occasionally (Id also like to say I don’t use these I was just curious if it could be possible to do.) so detecting no movement wouldn’t really be a solution, and could also negatively impact people who get frozen in place or stuck in objects. Just do your due diligence and report the account if you see it happen. (Also there’s the old “strat” of faking being a bot and “tricking” the survivors wile waiting for your no-Ed to pop.. which when I first started playing I went against a couple trappers who did this.
---
What do you mean "other 3 survivors"?
---
🤔
---
We all need r/eyebleach after seeing that
---
r/Vredditdownloader
---
This is so good
---
Actually it's because the framerate has been dickcheese for 2 years so nurse, huntress and doctor are annoying to play as.
---
Well seeing though I got pig to max level now, I do have some streamers with her! I've gone through most of this list now. Good farm. Now time to go out and enjoy the weekend.

Awe man I can’t stop laughing
---
They fixed swf, not solos
---
Why didnt he just drop them and start stabbing. I love when people try to body block because it means 2+ survivors are busy and I can usually squeeze out another down even if I lose the person im carrying
---
I usually do this when I’m killer but every time I play survivor and play the killer well with potato teammates I just get camped and tunneled so they don’t have to do it all over again lmao
---
Whu... how?
---
Even the locker tactic wouldn't work too well because of the crows, you'd have to deal with them too otherwise the killer would have a way to find you. It would just take way too long and be a pain in the ass to everyone
---
That really didnt effect you, you didnt even have a delay
---
We were wondering that exact same thing, any normal person playing killer would have started slicing lol
---
Color kind of doesn’t really mean anything it just depends on the actual gameplay.
---
I believe so
---
That's not even fucking funny
---
Register your data and know more accurately if your DC was intentional which leads to a ban.
---
I tried to make it as simple as I could since idk if you actually understand what a dedicated server do
---
This was amazinnnnng
---
LMAO, nice dodge. Spirit is very popular on PC and console. Billy too. You know why? Because they arent as effected as nurse by the trash framerate and sensitivity.
---
Same this has also happened to me. An issue with NAT connection.
---
Really what you have to do is learn the blinks there’s not much way around that. It’s a muscle memory thing which is why nurse has a high skill gap to play. Some of the addons help to learn with 3 blinks or longer range but nurse is soon gonna have a slight re work (if I remember correct) so getting used to them wouldn’t be the best idea either. Just practice if you really wanna get better, it takes time.
---
Literally no one cares
---
Been like that all day! Wasted a ton of BPS and cakes because killers just have been assholes, had one guy literally make maybe 15,000 as killer after the match was done. I’m not burning anymore because it always a waste, either people DC and killers finish’s us off quick or the killer has insta saw billy and downs everyone within the first 2 mins and we all get one hooked.... 
---
I’ve been able to play a few killer matches and all I have to say is my survivors made some points and we didn’t even farm, just slowed the game down some and also let them reset here and there along the way... 
---
Some died and some lived, but I still got GG’s post game and Ty’s for letting them get some points and not wasting BPS or grat cakes
---
Well look at that.
---
^ me with pallets 😔
---
Do you have any suggestions for perk load outs?
---
Give it about 12 hours
---
It's absolutely the frame rate and also controller being not as good for killer as M/K
---
No. Distressing is in game, BBQ is after the game.
---
The last 3 events I’ve played in on PS4 have had no friendly farming killers at all. Last year was way different and it just seems like now we have nothing but assholes running around being dicks to survivors.
---
The added mobility from KB/M makes Nurse terrifying on PC. Controller just can't achieve the same level of accuracy.
---
3 is 33 1/3rd secs 
---
4 is 28.57 secs
---
From what I've heard higher rank killers have less queue now since they changed the swf to use the highest rank player as the baseline for matchmaking.
---
This. Also The Oily Coil shouldn't be below the secondary coil, same deal.
---
It is scary to be unhooked in the basement and just hear the STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP
---
No they gave her or him the kill he said
---
You get them any time, but they can be pretty rare. Two characters I leveled to 50 recently didn't get a single BPS.
---
Just remove skill checks in general
---
Pretty much yeah.  Really short loops that the killer can easily mindgame for hits.  If they don’t have enduring and get stunned they can be good but besides that they are really bad for survivors
---
Well the thing is once you have 3 crows around your head it gives the killer a visual alert where you are, the same as if you fast vault or drop a pallet, so the only way to stop that is to keep doing things or eventually they'll find you, plus if you're the only person left and you go sit in a locker expecting to hold the game hostage the killer can close the hatch and start the end game timer. The lockers make the game take way longer than it should but eventually the game would end, if you body block someone in a corner as the last survivor left then there's no possible way for them to do anything to progress the game. Hiding in a locker until the crows happen is still a dick move though
---
I've done it twice and the killer just autoslides to one side of the pallet still holding the survivor
---
You can't loop a Killer around them for very long, thus making them unsafe. The only legitimate strategy to tackling Hawkins pallets is to throw them down when you absolutely need to and run to the next one. God help you if you don't have Balanced Landing 'cause once Hawkins' ten million pallets get thrown down, all you have left are the vaults.
---
Oh I see. I guess people only talk about them during a Blood Hunt because of the massive bp gains?
---
Not everyone likes to play “meta killers”.
---
The bug is only from the survivor pov, the killer still sees it progress. At least that's how it's been anytime I've seen the bug happen
---
I assure you that not a single soul will care. No matter how long you wait
---
Thanks for the reiteration!

My comment was the first one before the OP explained it.  Also I said might have been.  It's was a valid guess since there was not any context.
---
Wait a minute 🤔
---
Exactly, I been doing killer runs and farming bp entire fakes using what ever boosting offerings I can use along with perks that give bp ie bbq chili, distressing, and all stacks with any bonus offering, I usually hook all survivors once then chase them around smacking them and not hooking and then letting them all leave lots of fun and plenty of pts as well.
---
You’re doing it too early. You have to wait for the animation to be done
---
2 Burger King myers vs all no mither, dead hard, empathy, and borrowed time
---
Ok sorry
---
At the end of the game this person threatened to report him for body blocking and at the end said, "I'm gonna let you go this time" lol
---
See, IMO they deserved this.
---
My personal rule is if they are at the gate before I’m there, I let them go. Unless I’m chasing someone, or I have a grudge.
---
Nah, me too.
---
It doesn't reduce your BP. It gives you a minor hit to your malicious emblem. Like barely noticable.
---
And no it isn't against the rules
---
Congrats! Maybe you can get them to P3 before the event is over?
---
Yes but i'm saying that you can't be banned for it. When someone say "Punishment" to me that sounds like banable offense.
---
ohh youre right youre right
---
What she deserved
---
Yeah thanks I was super confused 🙏 you are so brave for correcting this
---
You know balances landing/lithe and dead hard are all exhaustion perks it wouldn’t really work
---
Yea I kind of love this new glitch... as killer.
---
*teacher grabs you and sets you back in you’re desk causing you to scream as they shut the hatch*
---
it just bugged , they havent fixed it. i counted 100+ heals and for some reason they havent even talked about it being a problem until i emailed them and they replied with " we are aware its an issue and we are working on it" whenever they fix that ill have platinum. sorry for the long reply
---
I've been having quite a few bugs since the new update. People losing connections randomly, text issues when you hit continue as host and not everyone has died, hair/clothing options messing up throughout a whole match.
---
It seems like the survivors and killers farming are never matched.
---
I play survivor I get 3 streamers from survivors and a try hard killer who says "fast game 4 fast kills, easy bloodpoints" and he got like 40k BP with 3 streamers.
---
I play killer and not a single streamer in like 30 games.
---
yeah, tho ruin and corrupt intervention prob wont cuz they were in recently
---
What do you mean you’ve seen it, it’s brand new.
---
Was it yesterday and against trapper, by any chance? 
---
It’s just that I was in a match yesterday and the only injured one on the team and as I just opened the gates and ran to the exit I got entitied while the collapse bar was at like half the progress, all 3 other survivors died too :(
---
Would someone please be able to explain the rank system? I’m relatively new to the game and curious as to how ranking works and where I’m at. Thank you!
---
I hope this wasn't the ebony billy game at blood lodge. That bitch just camped and tunnelled and mori'd after unhooks. Played her 3 times in a row. Smh...
---
Yea, but I watch TV, do work, read, etc. while in queue. So I rather have the killer side of things.
---
Myers is 100% a average joe stair climber. He's patient, he aint skippin no steps lmao
---
Are there any benefits to prestige or is it just a status thing?
---
2 v 6 would be ridiculously killer sided.
---
If they do a two killer mode it should be vs 8
---
The post says suggestion, NOT rant. I am making no demands, I am simply putting my 2 cents in. 
---
But please, pretend I totally didn't see you bitter people coming, and that I am oh so offended by your condescension.
---
Have a nice day, stranger.

First, i recommend yellow and above phasing speed and duration addons. Second, you can sometimes stand still to see what survivors will do to help predict their path, standing still as a spirit and letting them make distance isnt an issue as it is for other killers as her phasing catches up to them. Rely on sound more than scratchmarks to end a chance - you can pretty much chase a survivor’s initial scratchmarks THEN follow their sound of pain if they don’t have iron will and you don’t have stridor, following grunts of pain by intensity was easy enough to get used to and you’ll get better at it in time. Lastly, watch a spirit video by tru3ta1ent to see what i said into action, i got rank 1 spirit this way
---
I wish, most legion I go against hit you once then ride uour ass while having purple addon that reduces cooldown on recovery from feral frenzy.
---
its nice to see how the same killer can create different opinions! that just tell us how different our playstyles are and that's why this game is so fun, you never know what you will get!!
---
Nice! That’s more than I’ve ever gotten as a survivor.
---
There’s a glitch that’s been going on regarding that, I think.
---
From The Burning 1981, he was the first burned slasher before Freddy Krueger
---
Yo why the fuck is there a guy that says "why" in literally almost every clip that is uploaded

That add-on shaves off like .2 seconds. So it's not the add-on I'm afraid.

Very confirmed dio new killer jotaro new survivor venice new map

Ya at least a c
---
Basically, but add that with BBQ and you’ll have a fuckton of points
---
Status, you just get bloody cosmetics.
---
Also the demogorgon is hard to play
---
Status, new piece of clothing, and a slightly higher chance of getting rarer items in the blood web. 
---
Personally, I only do it for the status/“honor”.
---
That’s CRAZY
---
The first time she picks up something before she instaheals, the 2nd time the Steve might've instahealed but honestly hard to tell for sure, the 3rd time she could've picked up another medkit, maybe one the Meg dropped or something since you have Franklin's. You couldn't see the first item the Claud picked up, so i'm assuming it was bugged and made it harder to tell. Probably not the answer but hopefully you reported her just in case.
---
Are you bhvr official?
---
Dio’s Egyptian mansion as a new map.
---
Seems like they introduced quite a few bugs with this one.
---
"Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer."
---
Seems like a common behavior on survivors. Like "fukk this shit. bye"... Though I remain with the other 3 (or 2) idiots cuz I don't want my escape cake to be wasted :(
---
Just curious, is your bp resenting also? I haven’t played my switch yet so my plan was just just bank as much bp as I can not worry about levelling people up or ranks and wait out the bug.
---
You’ve been tricked. Quite possibly bamboozled
---
Holy shit! Congratulations!! THOSE BLOODPOINTS are amazing!
---
Doctor. ^^^
---
They want you to use the pallets and keep running, like an actual chase, not just running in circles. I think they did a great job with this map
---
Whoever downvoted everyone's comments ur mom's a hoe.
---
Skipping class has never been easier.
---
I'd piss myself if I walked back to a 4K.
---
That's a really smart spot tbh, kudos.
---
I love doing this on the Hawkins map, under the second open window. At least twice per game I'll get a trap.
---
We need bazookas!!
---
From level 40 you can get 2 perks of 3(from update 3.2.0)
---
Oh shit I watched that movie, I found it on YouTube. Also it's funny since I made like 2 killers already based on slasher movies from 1981. That being this one and harry warden from my bloody valentine. So cropsy will make a fine addition to my collection
---
Honestly!!! I manged to get Head On from the Shrine and it finally popped up on one of my bloodwebs. I have yet not managed to stun a killer with it cuz everytime I go for the  jump, the killer already starts the Open Locker Animation :'(
---
Why do her legs look so small
---
Oh that would be nice as well, the reason I didn't implement it was because Killer already have a stressful objective but sure, if they manage to leave it in game they should get BP as well
---
BBQ will double your blood points all distressing does is gets you to the cap faster. I'd get rid of destressing unless you're trying to have a bigger terror radius build.
---
The harm is that it's not the bloody subject that's why.
---
The guy managing this Twitter account could be posting about one of the dev dying and you'd still get this assholes continuing their bullshit and being like "fiX yOuR dAMn GaMe fIRsT".
---
Yea new update 3 to 4 perks will show up at a time after level 40 and you will be able to get 2

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dabngm/bhvr_releasing_a_bug_riddled_patch_just_before/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I’ve actually seen a major improvement in matchmaking. 
---
Killing and surviving. Maybe it’s bad luck?
---
Have you tried reinstalling the game?
---
Damn that should be a gold trophy
---
I played 6 matches in a row of coldwind as Meyers earlier.  You bet I started using map offerings after that
---
Holy shit can't believe Mike Tyson plays
---
I did even more. I read the whole post and the comments and you keep ignoring the solutions :) so.. you are A too stupid or B too entitled
---
Run where?  Pallets aren’t close enough to each other to not get smacked, considering there are almost no windows.  Plus some killers mind game and can literally swing around the pallet when you drop it making you lose speed going over the pallet or not getting the full boost.  They are awful and there’s a reason why there’s a balance of safe pallets and unsafe pallets on most maps is to make it fair.  Getting rid of looping is making survivors are such a high disadvantage
---
Youre dumb for thinking ur right just cause u have crowd favor. The game just doesn't hand you free points what do you think this is. You lost u get less points. What am I missing here.
---
Agreed.
---
We killers can be equally toxic, both party's can be extremely toxic.
---
I'd honestly love a 2 killers 8 survivors game mode, could change up the game a bit and SWF would be a little less problematic.
---
*To be Continued
---
I was honestly using filters bc I fucked up the cropping so bad I was getting rid of the background color it was ... just bad.
---
There are pallets everywhere. If you get found your probably going to take a hit that's just how the game works. There are so many corners and rooms to break line if sight with. Not to mention the gen in the portal room is a free gen, there's nothing the killer can do about it
---
What was post game chat like?
---
I have not, I will do so.
---
The Avatar is an intangible killer, capable of switching between their **Mist Form** and **Physical Form** at their whim. As the vessel of the Entity itself, the Avatar will swallow all Survivors in their **Dark Surge**, making sure no one can escape.
---
Their Personal Perks, **Lost Touch**, **Dirge** and **Entity's Embrace** allows the Avatar to exert their presence and pressure on Survivors, greatly hindering their objectives as they are lost in the mist of the Entity.
---
Glad i'm not the only one...i thought i was having internet problems with all the errors/waiting time for matches.
---
Bring deliverance and hide in a locker until someone gets hit.
---
Of course of course. But in the time leveling out all my survivors, I didn't experience super toxic killers. Outside of the few occasions people just played the game. But SWF groups are almost ALWAYS ultra toxic on PS4. Hate messages, teabagging and not even doing gens. If they knew they were better, it was just pure bullying and being toxic AF.
---
Where's the mori?
---
How the hell is he pulling that off? I try hard all match and rarely manage to kill everyone with 1 gen left
---
Your mind will be blown once you hit level 50
---
Clown. Takes more skill and will make you a much better player. Doctor is for low skill entry players.
---
Lemme bring my Kate to your S tier ;D nothing worse than being play by played to teammates because you gave up on me with Chases and I run OoO
---
20-13 is yellow ranks, everyone gets passed this by just playing.
---
12-9 is green ranks this is where most casual players are sitting at and coincidentally where it's the most fun to be.
---
8-5 is purple this is where people start to get good and mistakes get punished by killers or survivors depending on role, can be hard to get out of if you're not good at the game.
---
4-1 is red ranks this is where you play to make the opposition have as little fun as possible.
---
To gain ranks you need to get pips, these are the red dots at the end of a match to see how good you did. You can get 2 pips per match max. And to do so you need to succeed in 4 catagories for surivors its   repairing generators, healing/unhooking teammates, evading the killer(this means being chased) and escaping. Meaning you can't sit on generators for an entire match and not see the killer and expect to double pip. For killers it's how long you can keep survivors off gens, successfully using your killers power, winning chases and getting hooks.  That means you can't hook each survivor once and have them die on thw first hook and expect to double pip. There are usually 5 pips per rank. Good luck!
---
I seriously love running OoO
---
Nah bruh that's ICE scream.
---
The higher your number the lower the ranks, for example, 20 is the lowest rank while 1 is the highest. You increase in ranks by gaining "pips" which are acquired or lost after every match depending on how well you play.
---
Cough*everythingyousaidisbullshit*cough 
---
It can still be done in kyf matches and it ruins the game.
---
Not from a survivor main

Where's the shitpost tag?

Yea took me about a year. Most trophies just came naturally
---
So what do you recommend to replace?
---
You get an upvote for it being feng alone.
---
Aren’t Doctor and Wraith both free? And aren’t shards for buying perks in the shrine/outfits? 
---
i am confusion
---
You can also leave when you die and immediately start a new match, while the killer has to play it out.
---
&lt;3
---
At the very least it's on ps4. They report the same issues as well.
---
Here's a great vid on tips for doctor
---
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
There is more to it
---
If you want
---
Evader works as intended. You get points for a chase initiating and then escaping the killer. Yes, you get evader points while being in the terror radius and not in a chase, but the emblem rewards for that are minuscule. So are the bloodpoints for that matter.
---
If you find yourself in a lot of matches where the killer is hook camping, I recommend getting Borrowed Time so you can get the safe unhook.
---
I’m on PS4. 
---
As killer I’ve been getting matched pretty fairly thus far. Surviving, there’s been a little more of a variance but still better than it was before.
---
On Mobile, the only killers you get free are Trapper and Hillbilly--
---
You can buy others for 9000 Shards or 500 Cells
---
I’ve never seen a good spirit use collision to find someone. It’s laughably easy to track just from hearing, since footsteps and breathing are so loud. Not to mention the fact you can see grass move. Removing collision is a bad idea only because it nerfs bad spirits without affecting good spirits, not because it somehow makes her weak. Taking away an insignificant part of an unfun killer doesn’t make them bad, and spirit is far from the golden standard of killer design. Spirit is so unfun to play against that a majority of survivors would rather play against pre-rework legion with the mending bug. And before you tell me that I’m a salty survivor main I’d like to point out that I play killer 3 times as often as I play survivor, and that I’ve played spirit enough to understand just how easy she is to win as.
---
I've dced from games like 7 times today abruptly.  Lost 2 party streamers and like 3-4 escape cakes :p.  I have seen many people have similar issues today.
---
I was trying to level up my Steve but the Demogorgon got me when I was on my way to the gate but still far away and instead of hooking me, took me to the hatch
---
Your welcome
---
One of them is already a prestige level one.

Edited my post, my apologies-

"EnTIRe pOSt hIStoRY"
---
No dumbass. It's right on the front page not even a full second worth of a scroll. Thanks for the spam though. Real useful information here on the sub. Couldn't get through my day without seeing it... TWICE in a matter of seconds.
---
That’s the whole point of the movie. The teen think they are murdering hillbillies and kill them selves trying to take these guys out. Hilarious
---
I have...tragically some idea of why this isn't a feature in KYF.
---
All I seemed to go up against tonight on the Switch were Nurses. It was odd.
---
The game is bigger than it's ever been, especially with the Stranger Things chapter + Switch release. But i'm sure you know all the statistics and all of that and are not just talking out of your ass.
---
Not sure why you got downvoted, since you’re right. The ivory mori is still super boring to play against, but it’s not overpowered
---
Legion joins the EDF.
---
Well, then I don't know
---
Usually a DC.
---
When I play killer I play normally until it's obvious I'm gonna win then I play to farm. When there's a DC at 5 gens and you have 3 streamers, as the killer, if you aren't farming, then you're literally the sweatiest, probably dumbest, person ever. 
---
Why wait in 20 minute queues as killer during bloodhunt and then see 3 streamers and an easy game only to get 40kbp max.
---
Ohhhh, disregard my stupidity. 
---
I’m not big on either of those two, unfortunately. Wraith is the bane of my existence, however. Never struggled against Doctor.
---
Brother this comment chain wasn't even about you or ever addressed you, yet here you are calling me an idiot for actually discussing my opinion. 1000iq :)
---
I was talking about the animation, my bad. I swear that the hook animation you just did felt like it took too long
---
The salt at being hit with Za Warudo would be insane.
---
Combine it with We'll Make it and clean up one of the dead perks.

I feel like it was intentionally to strongarm people into paying for Leatherface.

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Good news! There are sweaty Spirits at EVERY rank!

I played Overwatch for the first time in a while last week and legit thought of my opposing team ''Do you guys really need Sigma, Reinhardt, Brigitte, and Symmetra." Shields and barriers. Everywhere all the time.
---
Well, people mean per-game. You know, the utopian fantasy where the matchmaking isn't a trainwreck and people don't overplay Killer because they want BP.
---
"We are the tribunal of shadow. Relinquish your innocence to us at once, mortal."
---
wrecking libtards with facts and knowledge /s
---
Wait, I thought the bullshit was the Steve fast vaulting without leaving. I'd be ok with no visual timer for EGC just to limit this dumb shit. Game is over, stop wasting everyone's time and leave dude.
---
Harry Warden was one Bloody Motherfucker
---
Man, that sucks. Hopefully they release a fix soon to patch that.
---
thank you
---
Uh, can the end timer suddenly go to zero from like 40-50%? I found hatch and was waiting for the last person to leave when all of a sudden it went to zero and died. Scared the crap out of me. I was keeping an eye on the timer too just in case, so no chance it crept down while I wasn't paying attention.
---
This was definitely a rollercoaster of emotions
---
Eh, it can take some time to get better at this game. Right now you're in the ranks where killers aren't very good because they're new, hence hook camping and whatnot. Soon you'll find yourself against better players who don't do that and if you don't take the measures to improve you'll find yourself depipping anyway. Learning to win chases is unfortunately imperative in this game in order to rank up, sometimes even in order to prolong the game long enough for teammates to get the objectives done. Escaping doesn't really do anything for you if the only thing you did all game was power the gens and nothing else. You need to get chased, go for saves, heal teammates, and do gens. One sure fire way to pip in those ranks is to get 2 gens done, 1 hook save, heal 1 health state, and either escape or be chased for at least 1 minute total.
---
But nobody appreciates attempting a late save.
---
Wasting everyone's time? There are still other people that havnt left
---
Can concur with the other guy, same with flashlight blinds. If you do them too early you don't save the guy.
---
The harder you are to kill the more likely you are gonna get camped.
---
I feel your pain as survivor I feel all I ever see is Spirit, Hillbilly, Freddy. With the odd Ghostface thrown in. And they all run the same shit. 
---
The survivors on my team do. I do.  I noticed too once streamers started running Infectious Fright on all their killers? So did a lot of the killers I was going up against suddenly.
---
Sure it's different, but it's a testament to the problem with this game for sure. Everyone just imitates. They never try to be different. 
---
''I saw ZuBat run Infectous Fright, so I run Infectous Fright!"
---
''Noob plays Nea! So I play Nea!"
---
It's alright!! 
---
Personally, I've only gone against a few of both and did horribly against them both 😂
---
This is cool and all but show me where literally one person who asked
---
Care to share how you managed to reach that as a conclusion?
---
Dwight &lt;3 Meg
---
One in your screen and another close enough to hear screaming. They weren't at risk with no terror radius around you.
---
Actually thought that's what happened until I read your comment hahah
---
disagree, survivor cooperation would make it way too one-sided if it was 2v8. 2v6 is fair.
---
Honestly, make that a feature. If you crouch too much too fast when you're the last survivor, just skip a collapse phase.
---
What's the image from?
---
How do you know it was for being male...
---
Anyway, it’s sort of give and take. Sometimes I’ll farm, only after killing a few. You have to be weary that a killer will just decide to stop farming. 
---
Even then - the game has to end eventually. Is all 4 survivors escaping any different from him downing you? Someone has to be dissatisfied. Sounds like you got sacrificed earlyish, but could be litany of things.
---
I imagine the killer just looking on in horror as it gets surrounded by 4 people who clown on him before committing suicide.
---
I have a friend who doesn't play anymore. We call him Elite because no matter what game he plays he's absoulty amazing at it. He got bored of DBD because no killer could catch him and he would almost always 4K.
---
He is a little bit of a douche though.
---
"I led the killer around for legit 8 minutes why hasn't a gen been done?"
---
"Elite. I did a gen and a half with Aaron. You weren't chased for 5 minutes."
---
No, that's the Clown.
---
And to think if you didn't play so immature you'd have lived.  Maybe reconsider the whole staying behind to bm thing.
---
Feng main best main
---
Which image? If it is the artwork I randomly grabbed one from Google
---
Every single game, there's a P3 Claud. Maybe she's on the Survivor list, maybe she's hiding in a corner, unseen.
---
I get it but it sucks i I just wanna enjoy a nice game and I get 4 flies around me buzzing.
---
They start showing up at 30, as The Doctor I got all three teachable perks before 50. Well, 2 of them. I didn’t want the third one showing up on all my other killers’ perk trees cause it’s trash, so I avoided it. And it came up like 10-15 times. It’s weird that you’re not seeing them to me.
---
Why do people not run spine chill? I take it over prem but I dont have a whole lot of time on the game, so?
---
Because they're insecure and need to milk a sense of accomplishment out of winning a round of a video game with terrible balance. They sure aren't getting it anywhere else.
---
What? No I think it’s the one all the way upstairs in Eleven’s cell from the series
---
He's pretty good. Him and Freddy are very similar and occupy the same area on the tier list. Good chase, great map pressure. I would give a slight edge to Freddy because I think his power is a bit more oppressive. So either low A or high B, below Nurse Spirit Billy and Freddy, a bit above Huntress.
---
People rage quit to “get back” at the killer, but it hardly affects you, just makes your job easier.
---
The wait times for both were pretty bad earlier. Killer was easily 20min waits every time, and Survivor was about 5min not including dodging bad ping. I hope it’s from high volume and not lack of players.
---
Seems everyone is stupid no matter the system they play on
---
What’s the issue? I have t noticed anything. (Tbf I started a week ago)
---
Get an adapter.
---
Or just message them through PSN
---
that's gonna be a "no chief" and a "lol natural selection" moment
---
If there are other people there, though, game time is not really an issue. I'm pretty quick to assume the worst of people, but if someone WANTS to be an asshole, they'll teabag. I don't think anyone too stupid to manage that, but who still wants to be toxic, is worth getting upset at.
---
Of course, hanging out at the gates alone is a dick move because it comes off as deliberately wasting the Killer's time. At the cost of your own, even, like an act of outright hate.
---
Imagine a game with nurse and spirit or even nurse and nurse.
---
6 survivors wouldn't be able to do **anything** to survive
---
Shrug. 
---
They didn’t seem to pickup that you weren’t farming after you started downing and hooking them? Lol
---
Just ignore it dude
---
Back story: I got a 4K as trapper. I’m rank 9. Two rank 4’s &amp; a rank 8. Two Insta heals &amp; two green toolboxes. (No I don’t think toolboxes are op I’m just saying)
---
Naah they kept running around me teabagging the ground..
---
Killer logic man we can't argue with it otherwise you get crucified
---
T-bagging isn't part of the healing process, so yeah. That's being a jerk.
---
I would say B but if I get to play him more then I might move him to an A but if it wasn’t used by a trash user(me) I would give it an A
---
Point taken. I’ll fix it
---
Oh bro what a meme. I bet youd have double the upvotes but the salty babies probs downvoted.
---
Okay, but are they WRONG? Are we about to burn down half the subreddit for this one?
---
Had this happen recently to a friend of mine. He wasn't being toxic, and there wasn't even a door open either, it was just killer closed the hatch. I watched him trying to heal because he already knew he wasn't getting out so he wanted his points and there was time left and just suddenly... ded.   
---
Also saw a freddy get stuck after teleporting to a gen a survivor was on... that was great fun to watch. He was stuck there till he could teleport again.  
---
Remember:  
---
"I think we've done a pretty good job so far"
---
Yes I've played against a few of them on PS4.  Nurses that just straight ran shit like their PC counterparts.  It's just much rarer to see them because it's more frustrating to learn her on console and most don't put the time into getting her down.  But I've definitely played against some scary nurses on console so it is possible.

Shrug, sounds like a good decision to me. I imagine it’s hard surviving on mobile - I know on console some of the juking and moving can be a little...nuanced? I guess you could say. On PC it’s even crazier. 
---
Pretty dope, though. Good luck out there in the fog!
---
I play on ps4 a hit it about 90% of the time, normally run BT, lithe, DS, and bounce around on the last one sometimes stake out if im getting to much ruin. Also big fan of autodidact.
---
It didn’t get to me I just found it funny &amp; cringe
---
Its a Demogorgon. I fully expected it
---
Stop being so obsessive, it would literally take you less time to either answer them or ignore them
---
Clown and Ghostface accepted the invitation willingly. Lisa messed up a symbol and became bloodthirsty and afterwards was taken by the Entity (I am assuming here based on her backstory), Rin was asked if she wanted revenge by the Entity, and the Plague was given a choice by the Entity who she belived to be her god.
---
Afaik, these are the only confirmed killers to willingly hunt. The Doctor most likely does as well though.
---
Frank I also have to assume loves it, as well as Freddy, and Amanda, while taken unwillingly does follow the Entity's orders.
---
The rest are either forced or have no mind of their own left
---
You got the link or a high quality picture of that sad cat right there?

Is this dbd mobile or on switch??

I used to play a lot of IDV, and a lot of the things I learned there help me out here and with every trial I get better ^.^
---
Thank you, and to you as well!
---
All I used to play was OVW, I was even a tank main and I just can't anymore. Its so unfun.
---
Might help to learn The Hags add ons first.
---
Well that’s typical, scared the shit out of me
---
Wait so they had powerful items and essentially had a massive advantage and Still Lost to a trapper?
---
Fail
---
Some fought back however, and are now either forced to kill or have no will of their own
---
lol... not that any of you would stick around that long but how does a game keep their servers running when the company no longer exists?
---
It was a close game not gonna lie. The guy ended up balancing right into my trap &amp; pretty much handed me the 4K by doing that. That made him mad mad I guess
---
Killers try hard sooo much against solo survivors and then they wonder why everyone plays swf
---
Not at all what im saying, thats like saying -camping, yeah lets not let killer be anywere near hooked survivors ever
---
As someone who semi-mained Old Freddy I miss the old one. He wasn't as weak as everyone claimed he was but his playstyle was very unconventional and he was garbage if you just tunneled one survivor to death at a time. He was excellent at rapidly switching targets and juggling survivors which gave you potent stall (And if you never hit them until you're ready to down you deny self-care wakeup) as you could harass everyone, catch them out in dead zones, and mindgame with Old Freddy's tiny terror radius. (I THINK it was 24 meters. With M&amp;A which was great on Freddy it was 16 meters. Add Red Paint Brush and it's 0 meters outside of a chase which was one of my favorite builds on him)
---
New Freddy is a chase oriented killer now. (Something Old Freddy sucked at besides easy first hits from the dream transition and catching people off guard in deadzones. Otherwise he'd just have to stall the game out via sleep to get all the pallets broken) He lost his tracking and stall in exchange for being better in a chase.
---
Dream Snares are decent if you're smart (I'm not the best with them) and you don't slow down when placing them meaning you can spam them as you move through loops. 
---
Dream Pallets are mindless (Place them everywhere) and lead to easy hits and downs if survivors fall for them. 
---
The gen teleport isn't particularly useful on it's own besides mobility  and the occasional mind-game/"Gotcha!" by teleporting to a generator in front of the survivor during a chase. It really shines when combined with BBQ and Pop Goes The Weasel though.
---
Farming is WAY too boring for me
---
I understand,it’s just frustrating when it’s bloodhunt weekend,like I want to farm but these people be leaving
---
What
---
Ended up on the lab as killer, didn’t want to deal with the immense amount of pallets so I yeeted out of there
---
P3 da scoops
---
Nobody did but whenever has anyone asked about 90% on this, or any subreddit. Infact show me one person who asked for your opinion?
---
The timer's bugged atm and is out of sync between the killer and survivors
---
Be better? Honestly you can't blame only the killer for games going too fast. Its both parties' fault.
---
Mint rag &amp; rusty shackles! Classic
---
If you get a 4k as trapper or another weak killer either surv are brain dead or the killer is a god.
---
So you have to play in Chinese?
---
Mobile
---
Oh look, unrelated content
---
Who asked you to post why your using moris?
---
Must be because you’re a Doc main.
---
Turned into a microwave lol
---
The first and third perk are ridiculously strong.
---
I like them.
---
Can it affect items? I got out with the rainbow map I brought, but it said I lost it. I have video of it too.
---
I returned to DBD after not playing for quite a few months, so I haven't been up to date with all of the changes. Are you able to reopen the hatch with a key after its been closed or no? If so, why couldn't I do it?
---
You should try dying light, than, sloppy and coulrophobia
---
I just snorted lmao
---
Right after he said “hmm no :)” 
---
I said “big yikes” 
---
He said “honesty right? A streamer that plays at 
---
rank 9. Sad. You weren’t even good”.
---
I replied saying; “good enough to get a 4K” 
---
He didn’t reply
---
Again nobody. But who asked you to comment your opinion on my post?
---
like what?
---
This post burnt my eyes out of my fucking skull
---
Play with a killer that has a large terror radius
---
Because you were in the dying state
---
Haha considering the type of dude this guy was, I’m gonna go with brain dead survivor lol
---
I wanted comment on it saying it’s cool and all but who literally asked
---
You can open hatch after its been closed.
---
In this clip it looks like she either blocked the prompt or you got glitched cause she was standing too close.
---
Yeah I got called a sweaty wraith when I was against rank 3s who all had instaheals and did gens in 3 seconds but were overly altruistic and dive bombed hooks. I literally grabbed 2 people off the same hook. I hooked someone, someone came  I grabbed them, dropped them. Then another came I grabbed and hooked.
---
8 survs is too much
---
I think we need more game modes. I'd love a mode where 4 killers try to kill 1 survior. The survior can't escape, but gets 1 BP a second. The killer who kills the survivor gets 30K BP. The other 3 get 10K for each time they hit the survivor
---
What's your rank and what killers/teachables do you have unlocked?
---
And i posted cause i wanted to rant. Then you decided its ok to say who asked but acts like its bad when someone ask you the same thing
---
When did I act like it’s bad I just said who asked lol
---
Aww man, you get to play with Cthulhu??
---
Many thanks! Since I'm still tweaking the idea a bit, do you have any suggestions? I think the third perk is a bit complicated, so I'm thinking of simplifying it a bit.
---
Its why we need dedicated servers.
---
-_-
---
I don't think I've ever played against a myers with tombstone and tuft of hair that got tier 3 before all 5 gens got popped
---
Yeah at first I thought it was because she was on top of it, but when she was doing the hit animation, I noticed she stepped away from it a few times so I thought I could jump in. I was really confused and upset.
---
never bought him
---
-_- doesn’t answer my question and to me means you have nothing else to say goodnight king
---
I hear it in my nightmares : (
---
Instead of needing 2 survivors you only need 1 and they need to pass 5 difficult skill checks to continue progress and if they fail one they have to start over and until they do the generator Cannot Be Repaired.
---
Imagine this perk with the Doctor
---
Surprised he didn’t disconnect.
---
Half the people got their messages on private, and rightfully so.

The game looks to have a steady growth over the last year though.

This is a TERRIBLE instakill myers build. YOU DON’t EVEN WANT TO INJURE PEOPLE
---
I don't know how i feel about it overall right now, but I believe people are way to use to safe pallets where there were no possible mindgames, like those damn trucks in autohaven.
---
The unsafe pallets are pretty fun to me playing as survivor and killer. Though i think they went a bit overboard with how unsafe they are.
---
I can't fathom the fact that people pick Ghostface just to facecamp, it's just beyond me lol
---
Same here. This is the first time i took a break with DP because of all the bugs on PS4 since the hotfix.
---
Good for escaping shooters

---
Have you not played Legion in a year or so? Almost all of this post is based on launch Legion.
---
So the screenshot they sent you wasn't even from your game together? Ridiculous.
---
I know your memeing, but that would also be good for tornado warnings too, every lower floor classroom should have a hatch.
---
I could say the same.
---
You can't be that stupid thinking that change gives a free pass for camping
---
You can't be that braindead
---
I don't think I've seen anyone saying they didn't wish for any of these things to happen, so what
---
And for when History Class comes
---
Yea its pretty solid, no complaints about it.
---
still gonna be hoping that the chapter after this one is back to being original creations though
---
Why do people think posting about them being a dick will get them anywhere. Whatever dude enjoy being shitty during an event
---
Hi killer
---
It should be harder to rank up and rank reset should be every 3 months. Really though I'd rather faster queues than getting someone exactly my rank
---
Yesterday I have seen a Nurse disconnecting after attempting to blink to me multiple times (I am a shit juker btw)and few games later a Wraith disconnected after failing to hit three guys in a row. That shit costed me 2 Bloody Party Streamers, so I'd like to say FUCK YOU, GUYS.
---
If you have impossible skill checks doctor, or doctor with distressing it can be useful but the shock rarely helps in a chase. The timing to shock someone just right to hit them next loop is too inconsistent. And if they drop the pallet at say, one of those azarovs resting place loops, as a survivors just take the shock and keep running.
---
I had survivors 99 an exit gate and shocked them so they couldn't open it and I think I got one of them but borrowed time wins. What's also annoying is Otz showed us if you spam doctor's treatment, you can grab survivors if they unhook. But for some reason, survivors bait the unhook and doctor does an attack instead of grab. which is how I lost that scenario -_-
---
Doc is not the worst but honestly needs help, I would have his shock instantly hit survivors as soon as it's discharged and not have a 2 second delay so it makes his pallet loop strong.
---
Holy fuck can people stop posting about this, BHVR knows it's problem and 100000 posts have been made about how bad it is.
---
Not saying that, it’s just on that map you can find 2 pallets in almost every room and more outside the rooms
---
WHAT'S THAT SOUND??? THE WRAITH.... no the wind
---
Shit you not though the pallet could be a good restaurant name
---
Yes. BHVR does nothing to punish DCing, so there’s no reason not to do it if yuh want.
---
So ive played a bit more with new freddy and im getting it, but again im bored that hes just an m1 chase.
---
I totally agree with you on old freddy, its how i used to kill it as him, i would find 1 and sleep them by holding in power and dragging it through cover, when found they would run off while i stomp gen, then i would go to somewhere else to find more while looking over my shoulder to check their aura, when i saw them hunching over i knew they were getting woken up = another awake survivor, so report over there and sleep them both, i would improvise from there, most likely chase one and down them to get Pop Goes off and start the steamroll, use BBQ to keep the momentum and dont tunnel ever, but if nearby just put them to sleep again if theyre under the hook they saved from.
---
By behing this way they would be confused, from what they see early game i walk up, sleep them then leave, so later when i want to chase them i do the same but then double back and catch them out of cover, with nurses this was great, and if theres a self car person just look in the closest corner where last seen and then pallets, they always run to the corner to self care which is great because theres no windows and pallets nearby. 
---
Its guerilla warfare, ducking back and forth constantly to ruin any sense of safety, all while seeing how they work together (do they split up, run in pairs etc) and knowing when theyre in dead zones.
---
As for starting a chase, i can usually get a lunge through pallet because again they think i sleep them then run off, but actually i stomp their gen, run off then come back when they go back to tap it.
---
With new freddy i just use teleport to jump in front of survs im chasing, and combo teleport with pop goes the weasel.
---
Huh fascinating well hopefully the next one will not be for awhile so we can prepare for the frozen apocalypse
---
in red ranks and purple ranks..  I genuinely hate having to use Ruin, I don't like hex perks that can be made non-existent and a regression perk like Ruin that works on its own without me doing anything (unlike Surge and Pop), it's a boring perk but every time I took it off 3 gens popped after i win a chase that lasts less than a minute.. ZubSAD
---
I've always wanted to ask people who do this why. I'm always cringing as a survivor when my teamates run around like idiots at the exit.
---
This is so sad, alexa play despacito

---
That's the whole point of the perk because it helps Trapper and Hag (and maybe Demogorgon) setup their early game before anyone can do gens
---
Against good killers you wont be able to do it. Poor killers will lunge and you can spin them during this
---
And this needed a random picture of the demogorgon to farm link karma because?
---
Uh well. It kinda is. Nothing wrong with it but it is.
---
Yup. If you look closely, it also says open hatch, but it quickly disappeared and I was knocked down.
---
Gotcha, yeah that’s annoying and a little slimey. It’d be one thing to play, then farm. It’d be one thing to farm, then kill at the end. It’s another to play-farm and then kill off. That sucks, man.
---
Are you on about the "lost connection to the host" thing, if you escape/die last?
---
WALLUUUIIIGGGIIII!!!!
---
Coming from playing Legion nonstop who I would say is roughly low B tier, playing Demo after getting used to shred feels borderline S tier.
---
I'm being downvoted for this, so I wanna clear up some confusion. I was unaware that you can only jump in if it was already open. But if you look closely in the very beginning, I tried to open the hatch before I was even put into the dying state. It said open hatch for a split second, and then quickly disappeared and I was downed.
---
I’d make it activate by healing 80% of a health state and call it a day
---
Whoosh
---
I presume you mean the people unhooking you in front of killer and the like? 
---
Yeah, it's annoying to say the very least, but considering this game is as toxic as they come, it's just a part of the game at this point. 
---
I understand that the hyper-focus on bloodpoint gaining can compromise a trial, and put you on the hook. 
---
No fun.
---
Me and a friend have been just doing achievement hunting to spice it up a bit. I know she was on the verge of quitting altogether, and I was mostly motivated by getting Rank 1. Now I’m just trying to get achievements and we are both enjoying a lot more that way. Running perks that help with certain situations rather than meta and what not. 
---
The game by design is repetitive, and I can absolutely see why people get bored of it. Maybe it’s just because I’m a couple hundred hours in, but I still find it fun most of the time. Rarely finding killers that tunnel hard, but a lot of try Harding at high ranks which I completely understand. If I’m tunneled/mori early I just move on to the next game and it’s usually a lot better, but I don’t get worked up over games really. I’ve proven to myself I can hang with the Rank 1s after staying there 10 matches in a row and I’m content with just working on killer/ achievements now.
---
You get a mori fairly often in blood webs. It's just decency to not bring one
---
What about the Reddit post where he ran into Demogorgon and Doctor? That's pretty new
---
Any chance of an Android release?
---
go to deadbydaylight website and submit a ticket
---
It’s not, as the game will eventually end.
---
If the remaining survivors refuse to finish the gens and leave, then THEY are the ones holding the game hostage
---
*skeleton key with milky glass and weaved ring appears*
---
Check your survival points next time you escape mate. Not sure if it’s affecting all players and on all platforms, but it’s been confirmed as an issue on PS4.
---
This site is notorious for downvoting separate opinions, I've had several downvotes for expressing opinions against survivor role to the same backlash. It's a game split between people who play one side or both, so theres gonna be a few bias's
---
gotta love killer mains 🙄
---
It helps if you report from both ends, they even ask you when you submit a ticket.
---
I love your drawing, nice one
---
Okay thanks.
---
I think PYS is taking the
---
That's a decent load out but be aware it is wholly dependent on survivors healing. Going against newer players with that will help you starting out, especially people who like to self care and waste time with that. I like nurses calling but when you go against better players they'll catch on real quick to you having it and will just heal outside of your terror radius or even not at all. I prefer nurses on Myers or Ghostface for that reason because the terror radius is small/nonexistent. Infectious fright is probably one of the best perks to run on nurse, so I would try and get that either from the shrine or when/if you get the Plague.
---
R.I.P., Reaper and Firefly :(
---
Literally happened to my billy yesterday, my post is still up actually
---
What the fuck man? You made it that 3 tries give you less chance than 1 try and you still didn’t notice it?
---
(0.96)^3 = 88.47% for failure after 3 attempts 
---
1-0.8847=11.53%
---
Bing-bong
---
I prefer Koosh
---
His calculations are wrong. Look how after 3 attempts he ended up with less chance of escaping than after one. Check my reply to his comment for the answer
---
Survivor or killer?
---
"gens are being done to fast"
---
Will the killer just be a tree though, minding its own bidness?
---
I finally got my sister to play DBD with me and I always feel so bad. I’m rank 9 and she’s a 20 just starting out, so you can imagine her pain lol
---
You DC and stop wasting everyone’s time
---
\*They're
---
Idk... I can see it being lower in the case of 3 attempts then 1 success. 
---
Because if A B C ect. Are independent, then P(ABC...) = P(A)P(B)... ect.
---
In other words, you're calculating the probability the 4 specific events occur. That 3 failures are followed by one success.
---
I also want it
---
games these days can go on well past the companies life cycle with peer to peer dedicated servers are just a drain on the company and leaves the game on a clock as to when the servers are shut off...
---
You can still get hit two steps after a medium vault, one step after a fast vault and half the character model after a vault with a drop. This is intentional. 
---
I hope this helps
---
If you refer to getting hit after more than that, it’s 100% lag and devs can do nothing about it
---
How to combat it? Don’t vault when the killer is too close to you.
---
Could be. It was just a really unfortunate situation for me overall lol
---
No, I calculated the chance of all 3 failing and then calculated the opposite of that, which means “at least one ended up working”
---
Dang, downvoted for saying what they didn’t want to.
---
I know and killer had a survivor pudding and did that
---
You will never reach the truth
---
I wish they’d prioritize optimization
---
I don’t know if your new to the sub, but search 
---
“ new to” and you’ll probably find some threads with great input. 
---
That being said try and loop pallets, instead of waiting at pallets. (Don’t be scared to take a hit, and waste as much time as possible) 
---
Try and keep and eye for good looping areas
---
While working gens I look for a possible quick escape away from the gen 
---
 
---
Only use the “god pallet” if necessary (killer shack/ regular shack)
---
That makes sense actually. But that doesn't isolate that the third attempt works. Your percentage is just one of the chances working.
---
I'm looking for the chance that there are two failures and THEN a success.
---
Apply pressure to the objective, and switch targets if one chases you around for too long. They’re just trying to waste time for the gen rushers lol jkjk.
---
Bruh
---
Didn't you post the exact same clip yesterday?
---
Oh my god
---
This meme applies too so much thing in Dbd.
---
SWF, strong addons on top tier killers, mori etc...
---
anyway during BP event, some killers just dc at the start if someone used a bps or cake...
---
I do believe it was  [u/Chattywindow](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chattywindow/)  on r/deadbydaylight
---
Probability is my favorite part of mathematics and I get very "religious" whenever I see a question about it, especially because there's a lot of misunderstanding around it
---
it's more that the Devs allow so much toxic bullshit in this game that you have all the reason to DC. And not only as killer.
---
Everyone is playing killer to maximize how many bloodpoints they can get.
---
Contact DBD support. When I lost hours of progress they gave me 595,000 bloodpoints.
---
Thanks I appreciate it

He was rank 3 and I was in a solo with 3 other red ranks. :(
---
Yeah it’s stupid as fuck lol, more catering to killer as usual. I’ll be solo queuing and a rank 1 with his rank 10-15 friends with a rank 1 killer. It’s an automatic loss. Fucked up thing is it’s nearly every game

Yeah, I often find it difficult to know what equation to use for a given problem. I just need more practice.

I'm so tired I thought it said Dead brain Ace plays, in a way I wasn't wrong.

Knowingly playing host connection when you know your internet is trash to the point where a vault animation takes 3 seconds, makes it only fun for one person, the killer.

I wonder if that rank 3 is gonna go on the forums and complain how the new matchmaking is broken because of his low rank SWF friends now ha ha.
---
It's definitely a great map for me. My teammates don't usually do gens but I love taking the killer on a five gen Chase almost every time with balanced landing. You can literally create infinites against most killers by using that window above the washroom and have the protection of 3-4 pallets in just that one area of the killer catches up with you
---
I like it. And it helps with hex: ruin too.

Not really, there’s a glitch which shows the EGC timer incorrectly for survivors.

Yeah, it's very cringe
---

---
#MYERS SWEATER
---
If you just pick a survivor like Claudette or Meg and just pley them you will soon be racking in the perks, but as a lot of things getting over the skill curve takes a bit of practice. Just not necessarily 400 hours.
---
WHO’S THAT POKÉMON?
---
If you don't have the dlc play wraith he is pretty straight forward and you'll get a lot of points for smacking people, i would stay away from billy and nurse untill you've learned more about the game and maps. 
---
Killer is the best for points but no its not easier than survivor, at low ranks ywah it might seem like so since most new survivors run in a straight line but trust me survivor is waaay easier, problem is you don't get as much points.
---
Disconnecting needs to be punished. I can understand bad internet. Or the rare case where you might HAVE to DC for some reason... But it's really bad in DbD.
---
I think DC should cost players bloodpoints. Every DC you make that day costing you more. If you don't have enough points. You're not allowed to DC.
---
Killer is very easy at the beginning because Survivors at low ranks don't know how to survive very well. At some point Killer actually becomes a challenge and then you realize Killers are usually on the losing side of a match at higher ranks.
---
Yes, having all the perks in the game is a grind -- but that's kinda the point. It's a grindy game, and most people that actually play it for a long time enjoy the grind. It's rewarding. But there are easy ways to cut down on the grind, and the first is to play Killer. You will get astronomically more points as Killer than as Survivor because you are guaranteed to be in the match the entire time. No more getting hooked 3 times within 2 minutes and getting 6000 bloodpoints, more often than not you'll be making 20-30k bloodpoints per match.
---
I would wholeheartedly recommend playing The Cannibal (Leatherface) as your first Killer, not only for his easily understandable power (a chainsaw he swings in front of him for a while, instadowning Survivors and breaking pallets), but more importantly for his most coveted perk, BBQ &amp; Chili, which grants a 25% bonus to bloodpoints at the end of the match for each Survivor you hooked at least once, making every match drop double what you'd regularly get. He's also simple to learn the basics of Killer, and as a result you'll see how Survivors counterplay.
---
Don't forget to always play both sides to learn how each other thinks!
---
Considering DS has been nerf’d to 60 seconds after hook instead of being used at any given time. This post is ridiculous, get a 60 second egg timer you smack after downing somebody previously off hook if you’re that upset over it lol
---
If you're not having a good game, finish it and hope for a good game next round. Don't be a baby and DC because you're not winning.
---
Yes
---
&gt;I have like 4 hours in the game and so far I feel like survivors are too hard to play and the killer is too easy.
---
Yeah it can feel like that, doesn't help the tutorials are bare bones.
---
Dwight, Meg, and Claudette are usually good starting Survivors because their perks are more simple to use and don't have big requirements.
---
&gt;Do i really have to grind so much for them?? 
---
Yes, the bloodweb is built around the grind but there's perks and offerings to help lessen it.
---
&gt;Also what killler should I play?
---
Ultimately who you enjoy to use the most in the end but for starting out I recommend Trapper, Wraith, and Hillbilly because of their more simple powers.
---
Trapper does rely on some map knowledge and match knowledge to know the best spots to set bear traps so Survivors step in them more often.
---
Wraith is the simple Stealth mode for holding down a button then getting out of stealth with the same button, struggles in higher ranks due to being Add on dependent and Survivors are better.
---
Hillbilly is probably the easiest to practice out of the top 3 Killers (Nurse, Spirit, Billy), power can be used for quick map travel and ending chases faster while still having 115% movement speed.
---
Hawkins is my favorite map in a long long time, the game actually feels spooky again. Being trapped in those claustrophobic hallways with a killer coming for you from an unknown location is an awesome change from the wide open maps BHVR loves for some reason
---
I played a survivor match on pc where the killer mentioned they waited an hour.
---
Cold wind wouldn’t be so bad if it was just that the corn is annoying, however playing as mike or ghosty the corn actually blocks your stalking and it’s fucking stupid
---
I'd say Clown. Doc stomps newer player but in my experience a good clown is harder to deal with. Sadly both need addons to do well against good players though
---
My butt clenches when I hear a heartbeat.
---
But what's winning? I personally play for the points and prestiging, so if a Killer is going to deny me those things, guess what, I'll deny you the same.
---
That being said, I only experience a shitty Killer like once a day, and I hardly even DC -- was just explaining a reason for certain players I guess.
---
Tho there are days where i'm not able to hit a hex skill check at all. While other days i miss maybe only 15% of them which make ruin almost useless against me.
---

The fact that we’re only just now getting DC penalties with dedicated servers is really unacceptable, especially when it’s a HUGE problem in the game
---
Literally the worst kind of players tbh. This just happened to me against a Demogorgon and only got 28k.
---
I've been having the same thing with autohaven. Although I'd pay to have Ormond removed.
---
People dont like getting memed on by survivors
---
Hi survivors
---
Meg teabags too though
---
I somewhat agree with this and think it would be a good idea. However, (piggybacking off the tutorial comment) I’m also thinking it could be good for low ranks to see/play with higher ranks to learn how the game is really played instead of just going through the tutorial and then thrown into gameplay. Though I get higher ranks die a lot due to this. It’s a double sided coin I guess.
---
On the front should have the Necronomicon with a Santa hat, surrounded by beer cans. On the back it should have Boomstick and his chainsaw crossing over, or something like that. Honestly, I’d love this.
---
Lol imagine being that big of a baby.
---
Well done!!

---
Oooh that's a good combo.
---
Splinters are just supposed to be just one round
---
Responding to own post xD I’ve played killer multiple times and I’m the only one bringing a bps during surv breaks. 28k is damn good for a survivor xD
---
I hear you more props to you! If you wanna play lmk! I have 700 hrs on pc not sure about ps4, but I play it more frequently just made rank 11!
---
I put a comment cause I didn't want a long and cluttered title?
---
Bro I thought they meant “what does bhvr mean by this appearing in game”.... I need some sleep
---
It's also as equally horrifying, when you think about it.
---
It’s actually my first time that a killer camps on me. Two other survivors did escape tho and the other one actually DCd
---
Ooooo “this post is ridiculous” but yeah
---
I've played about 8 games and I've been the only one to bring streamers every time
---
Had to play Bill for 3 matches for my Daily Ritual, imagine my pain.
---
i usually run Lithe, Borrowed time, self care, and unbreakable
---
Thank you! Even if I know it’s going to be a shit game I try to make it worthwhile for my teammates and the killer (if they are super good)
---
min master race
---
Had a game one time where the killer managed to Franklins a medkit out of my hands because two dipshits bodyblocked me to do a quick T-bag.
---
Another reason i will never consider t-bagging a viable form of communication in this game.
---
I feel like this is directed towards me lol
---
It's one of the best perks in the game, it would still be top tier without the BP bonus.
---
even if killers didn't "try so hard" against solo survivors it wouldn't reduce the amount of people that play swf
---
Considering how strong it is, it would need some huge drawback like 'while repairing a generator your aura is revealed to the killer'.  Likely no noise notification on its reveal, similar to object of obsession.
---
I'd definitely run decisive strike if I were you
---
Sample build could be Alert, Lithe, Q&amp;Q, DWM. The Lithe, Q&amp;Q, Dance With Me combo is good for confusing killers and disappearing after a vault. Alert is good for a little bit of map knowledge as to where the killer is. Don’t really see much of a use for Technician unless you miss skill checks a lot.
---
Totally valid. Been running into a lot more killers wanting to just tryhard and brutalize anything they see- especially during bloodhunt it’s not super cool. Even playing as nurse I give 1-2 survivors pip points (I play bothe 50/50)
---
Killers love when survivors drop good pallets so pointlessly like this.
---
No, if they dont want to be morid, they jist shpuldnt play, see how stupid thay sounds?
---
Ot was just gg, but everymatch was somw form of bs
---
Gotta get them bloodpoints
---
That wasn't pointless it bought me time to hide..
---
you actually do get BP if you leave the correct way
---
I see most dcs as surv against Freddie :(
---
doing something while knowing it's bullshit is the definition of being toxic.
---
I stopped caring about the bp, i couldnt get mutch due to insta heals and keys
---
Well 2-3 survs usually yields a decent score for top 2 survs and killer
---
Now that is what I call a hot piece of ass
---
love that song
---
Theres also selective bias, you remember the most annoying parts and forget the good ones. i.e. surv/ killer that run different perks
---
Yeah I just murder people.  Farming and being friendly got boring fast with ice cream wraith back in the day
---
Yeah sorry I meant, gen about to be completed? Counter it by going to protect another one.
---
Learn the nurse, she is boss if you get to understand her perks. I personally like Dwight, Nancy wheeler, and Jeff’s perks
---
I fucking love scary movie
---
Good thing getting hit by Legion in Frenzy is literally a worthless undertuned mechanic!
---
GO AWAY SHOO SHOOO !NOOOOO!
---
Serves them right for acting like shitheads instead of escaping
---
Just as soon as Legion is playable I'll get right onto playing him, guys.
---
Using perks though is toxic? No. That's just playing the game and nerfing every perk gets old after awhile so you can only do that so much.
---
Can't wait for a proper rework not a slap on the hand
---
"The same killers repeatedly"
---
If the game wasnt so borderline unbalanced, you would see somthing else then Nurse,Bill or Spirit, but most players are cunts and then tbag at the exist gate the poor wraith that had a daily ! 
---
You reap what you sow.
---
Soooo does my math work out? Lmao didn’t know who that was directed to
---
Trust me there is face campers in purple ranks. I would also like the unbroken emblem to be changed based on the number of gens finished in the event you die because if all 5 get done in 3 minutes and you're killed you only get a bronze medal or no medal at all which can make you depip
---
That's where you're wrong kiddo
---
LMAO didnt think of that
---
Maybe not an immediate efficiency bonus. 
---
"Hitting Great skill checks grants a token of 1/2/3% toolbox efficiency bonus up to 5 at 5/10/15%. Missing a skill check removes all token and hitting a normal skill check removes 1 token."
---
The only reason why Bubba exists is because BBQ
---
Most people agree that winning as killer is killing 3 survivors, not 4. But I'm pretty sure winning as both killer and survivor is pipping, and trust me, you can de-pip even though you escaped/got a 4k.
---
You’re free to believe what you want, I won’t bother arguing you on this.
---
The only reason legion exist is-
---
Uhh...
---
Hmmm....
---
Selling cosmetics for 4 characters
---
And to add a new status effect, which became a bug
---
I personally havent seen a P3 Quentin or Jeff
---
I know but spending the full match injured is annoying af... So I get why people do it.
---
I just kill myself on a hook so I can get out and get my points. Cause fuck it, she's just not fun to go against.
---
Shame about the dc. That usually makes me give mercy to a surv
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
Laurie
---
This bloodhunt I've spawned next to a lit totem like 10 times as a survivor
---
People get her for decisive and discard her
---
Yeah with 3 bps. I’m sorry, it never happens when I play (solo surv or killer).  But a normal game 28k is great!!!!!!!
---
Fair enough I guess. Still kinda seems like a waste.
---
I am in red ranks lmao I know there can be face campers in these ranks. I tend to get face camped a lot because of head on. They should maybe tweak the numbers for unbroken emblems but I don't think they should directly relate to gens. And, let's be honest, sometimes you're gonna get thrown into a match with an insidious camping leatherface. No, it's not fair. You're not gonna pip. But it be like that sometimes.
---
Very cool, thanks.
---
Quentin, Jeff and does anyone even play tapp anymore? Does he even exist?!

I got sacrificed because I wasnt in the 3 man swf. They blocked me in the basement so I could be killed, and farmed.

honestly a great experience 10/10.

It's no good against flooding though. Maybe a hatch and a ladder in the ceiling.

how do i get a body like this 😩
---
I said gg and they said nothing lol
---
The new rule is if you DC in the first 10 seconds of a match, it’s a cancel and you get your offering back. That SHOULD be the placeholder rule.
---
Ah, the karma
---
With each stomp that draws nearer, your urge to DC increases.

Hold up there buckaroo. That is not toxic. You’re using that word all sorts of wrong. Griefing people in or out of game with the intent to make them frustrated, DC, or play worse is the correct definition. You can play 5 blink Nurse, Iri Belt Huntress and RPF Clown all you want but using those addons isn’t inherently toxic, they’re just imbalanced. 
---
Same as a survivor running instant heals every game or toolboxes with high speed addons. Will it massively tip the game in their favor? Yes. Is it punishable? No. No one should expect to win every game they play and calling people toxic in this community is a synonym for “you’re doing something that minorly impacts my fragile rules of fun” 
---
Please, take several seats.

---
What you play on? Killer on xbox is waits but balanced. Had a 117,000 game yesterday
---
People in red ranks still out here using self care without a medkit when thanataphobia and sloppy butcher active. Alright, I'll see you in 8 minutes when you finish healing yourself as I die on my first hook.
---
you do not have to leave in the middle of a game though you can easily put the controller down and leave the room for a little there is never a good reason to dc and screw other ppl over
---
*A decisive pummeling!*
---
Getting twerked by the demo. Nice update, I like.
---
jane in bikini when?
---
Bro it’s RNG. Prestiging gives you another goal because after you get everyone lvl 50 you got nothing to spend BP on. So might as well prestige and get cool cosmetics.

Do you find clothing a valuable experience in gaming? If yes, prestige.

Yeah you posted that one 11 hours ago but what about your next one? That was an hour ago. Besides, it's common sense. I told you, ignore the whole 'commenting' part. You never questioned for a second what the hell is happening and you just automatically assumed OMG SURVIVORS TOXIC?
---
I haven't played in awhile so my rank went down to 20 as killer and I think I'm in hell like this is my torment. 3 dcs everygame and every game takes 15 minutes to find I want to die but I also want to kill
---
There is nothing to argue. Harming others by voluntarily using unbalanced stuff is toxic by definition. It's not an opinion. 
---
It's not about knowing if blue is better than red, it's just like that.
---
The fact Devs allow you to act in a toxic way doesn't make it less toxic. It's not because one country allows you to kill your wife and children 'cause "reasons" that doing this isn't horrible.
---
What jsut bloody happend ?

---
You seriously feel like a huge asshole when the NOED Blood Warden combo works, but god damn does it feel satisfying when I see them teabagging me at the gates with no where to run.
---
yes you get the same think as killer if you DC correctly. It consider that the survivors DC and you get the bonus BP for it + the "no one escaped" bonus too
---
Yall think the demogorgon got a bootyhole?
---
He thinks it was lag dragging the same Claudette back into the trap. Actually it was 2 Claudettes being spectated and switched between them when the first escaped
---
40 downvotes. A lot of people not familiar with the ballads of the rape dwarves
---
Well I just ran into a friendly one and it was so sweet, no camping or anything
---
I think it really depends on the killer. The Game vs Nurse or giant terror radius Doctor is absolute hell.
---
Killer's shack is one of a few places where the hitboxes or however it is called are smooth therefore it is safe to just hug the wall and don't be afraid of getting stuck due to an invisible pixel on the way. 
---
This game does not slow you down by running along the wall.
---
Dead hard for the game ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
It's so 'funny' they had to put fake laughter in the background.
---
I couldn't care less when it came out on console. Came out 2016 for pc. I dont care how long you've been playing so why did you say you've been playing from release. You're on console buddy, you cant even turn around in less than 3 seconds. You drop safe pallets against against a myers like that, clearly your lack of knowledge and understanding of the emblem system and chases has got you puzzled.
---
Michael Jackson before losing his n-word pass
---
It’s happened to me to a couple of times
---
Ya there’s been some stuff going on with them, they’ll switch mid match too. I had a sabo hooks daily that switched during my match to a tier up Myers daily (luckily I was playing Myers and got it but it was still weird.)
---
Wooden pallets bitch
---
I'd have looted the chest first for extra BP &gt;.&lt;
---
also completely destroys your medal progression so you don't even rank up 90% of the time if you kill as soon as you can.
---
My highest is 137k not sure what the max is. Wish this lasted more then 3 days. I got other shit to do fuck.
---
Then don't write things that aren't fucking true to try and buff up your weak points and expect not to be corrected lmfao. Literally can't even have a decent argument with someone that can't even get their facts straight and assumes things from a few seconds of a video which doesn't even make sense because it made me get away anyway it's hilarious.
---
No.
---
You have to get all your perks again, in exchange you get so blood-covered cosmetics you'll never wear, because they aren't 1% as good as the stuff you can get from the store.
---
What's with all the complaining xD there is nothing wrong with what she did in that video. The aim of the game is to survive, she did exactly that so stfu :)
---
I think by "fun killers" he meant "killers that can be easily bullied"
---
I always walk away with 5k+ if I escape...
---
Has anyone used the distraction perk against spirit? Is it worth running?
---
No. I support people not playing like dicks...
---
3 people dced so the hatch spawned and opened right next to him
---
I find a lot of toxic David Kings, as well as some Fengs.
---
You're literally incorrect lol
---
Badham in general is still disgusting. Still guaranteed 2 god pallets in the preschool proper, the new window loop at preschool is ridiculous, still has shack, double story house is safe with balanced landing, the basement house usually has good windows and pallets, and the maps as you said are some of the biggest in the game.
---
You can throw as many mindgameable pallets as you want outside of the buildings, but if you're going to make the map super huge with all the gens spread out and still keep the structures mostly the same (if not worse), you've done nothing. Preschool II is the only one that seems hilariously bad for survivors, which I'd say is a problem as well.
---
That's just my opinion anyway.
---
I will
---
These guys are noobs. They can't do anything productive without heals. It's so annoying to be the only 1 working on gens, just so one of em can escape via hatch. 
---
I'll run iron will to  remain productive while injured. Empathy to locate someone to heal me. 
---
 Teammates don't understand that every second counts. Instead they waste time healing/doing totems (no where near escaping game) /chest boxes (when no progress has been made/hiding/ everyone looking for ruin.
---
I lose more games when everyone's healing consistently, while I finish 2 gens with ruin. Self care is the meta for bad habbits. I don't  see none of the pros running selfish perks wasting time.
---
Yes, that sounds fun.
---
Your laugh is so evil it's perfect.
---

---
We all have at least one thing that's rated highly we want to see less... for me its map offerings
---
there's a clear reason why you have about 30 downvotes
---
hahah I noticed after the fact and though it was a bit too evil
---
lul
---
I'm a sucker for exclusives so this is me lol
---
I agree with this. I saw another guy come up with a good idea for a Clicker killer, though. Very nice, I just can't remember where. It would be nice to have one, but Joel as a standalone is more than adequate as well.
---
It obviously wasn't a joke because you defended yourself before stating it was a joke. Your backpedalling now
---
Lol thanks !
---
I really really really like this picture
---
It was probably me. I decided to make it just because so many people asked for it but I did say in the post I didnt agree with it
---
It's usually pretty obvious if survivors are new to the game, so I go easy on them.
---
Ez baby killer
---
Dont forget distressing
---
Who put Myers and Claudette together?
---
What color mori did he have?
---
And my point is I got away anyway so it's stupid to even say that. It's what works for me and if you don't like it then that's your problem not mine.
---
except you can counter this camping by not being completely dumb..
---
They think they own every pallet in the game. I bet they save the pallets and it's what gets them killed xD
---
Please god don't make gens longer, it's so boring. Give us other objectives T_T even if it's just holding M1 and skill checks at least it's not eating cricket noises.
---
I've never seen a wraith that didn't camp/tunnel since I came back to DBD for Stranger Things but tbf I've heared that wraith is really bad so im not gonna be mad about it
---
Because I didn’t think someone could be that idiotic
---
where does it say that?
---
What curse have you brought upon this sub
---
Hope you get tunnelcamped into oblivion for the rest of your dbd days :)
---
First of all, calm the fuck down. Take a deep breath and try to relax; literally *all* I did was explain why people are mad at this post. I will reiterate, Tier 1 Myers is quite literally *as slow as a survivor*. You would’ve outrun him either way, and you didn’t need to drop the pallet. That is ALL that I’m saying.
---
Feel like it isn’t a problem and you don’t care that you misused a pallet? Great! There isn’t a huge problem with playing wrong, but you, fundamentally, *did* play it wrong here. You could’ve dropped the pallet on him to buy your teammates time, or you could’ve kept running and gotten away because it’s a tier 1 Myers.
---
Yeah lol. memes are meant to be stolen though so I don't mind
---
So you’ve been playing for over 2 years and you still don’t know how easy it is to outrun Scratched Mirror Myers... ok.
---
I think its dumb
---
1. That's offensive, and misogynistic. Enjoy a report.
---
2. I rarely go into the basement against Bubbas.
---
3. I don't prestige any character. It's pointless.
---
4. I don't play Claudette, because I know how annoying Blendettes are.
---
5. I don't care about *me*, but about the health of the game, its community and keeping matches enjoyable.
---
Still can get thicken the mist on killers, if anyone is going to argue that its useful for stealth killers, its not, it just makes it equally as hard for survivors and stealth killers.
---
The main reason he's fun to play against is because he is pretty weak, which in turn is why not many people play him..
---
If, in your experience, it's either; "camp the basement as Leatherface" or "be a punching bag"...
---
I think you need to get better at the game. Relying on cheap, unearned kills won't get you there.
---
And literally what I'm saying is I do not give a fuck how can you be so damn hypocritical like wow. I didn't misuse it, it saved me therefore it's not a waste. And dropping it isn't going to buy my teammates time when they're no where even near him or in danger you wet sponge lmao.
---
I'm rank 6 mate so yeah ok.
---
Time to find out
---
Lowkey thought that was hag
---
Stolen meme from another subreddit
---
Is a new bug, killers sometimes don't DC, they receibed blood points and stuff
---
Also it gives you a goal again. I am closing in to having everyone lvl 50, so apart from unlocking all perks on everyone(Which takes insanely long anyway) there's not too much to so so starting over from square 1 and trying to survive/kill with a few perks instead of all the best ones is a nice challenge
---
This is why you're rank 12, you waste all pallets and still die and lose it for your team
---
I'm rank 6 LMFAO
---

I hate teammates that think they can control everyone and everything.
---
Yep. I finally got the new key add on(the one that let's you see the obsession), and played a white ward. I ended up dying (After my obsession DCed straight after they went down 2 minutes in. I was real salty then), but my key and add ons were gone
---
Baby killer
---
Still not reportable because of EGC.
---
I can hear him breathing from a clip on my phone, and you can’t hear him with headphones? I even have bad ears. And no one owns the pallets, but it’s resources for whoever needs it. You didn’t need it at that time.
---
Lol that hit me hard.
---
It's amazing on gf if you decide to ever get gf
---
Tbh, I’m clearly right if you read previous comments. It’s whatever, if it happens it happens, it’s just a big waste
---
Because she was bugged. She literally cannot control it. Either she disconnect or you do.
---
IIRC rarer items was confirmed to basically be a lie

---
I think its a must on wraith!! If you """stop chasing""" them and make they think you are not around, they will starting healing and you can ambush them very easily.
---
I had an entire team DC within 1 minute of the match, just because they all decided to camp a single Gen, and as Ghostface, I tagged them all, and boom. Hunted. Each DC'd as they went down. It was super annoying especially when I had just used Ultra-Rare add-ons and a Mori, only to lose them to sore losers.
---
yes i realise now. it seems odd when they crawled there under their own steam though.

maybe i'm just paranoid from being bullied too much by survivors haha. The survivor added me and talked him into dc'ing since i'd clearly won the game
---
Me actually
---
Its pretty simple really
---
Double BP lmao
---
they added me, then left the game. i'm getting downvoted to hell over this and i have no idea why :/
---
Because the killer DCing apparently gives the survivors nothing now or something? Ran a billy around for like a solid 10 minutes, adrenaline popped, the billy disconnected and I got a phat 0 in all categories, a depip and 0 points...
---
'I heard the quietest breathing with my headphones on my phone therefore everyone must have heard it.' like no.. Yes I did it saved me from getting downed it's one pallet get the fuck over it cry baby.
---
Inner Strength activates after you cleanse a totem, so it can be used a maximum of five times. Second Wind activates after you heal a survivor for one full health state, and goes into effect after you are unhooked *if* you’ve healed a survivor for one full health state. So it can be activated a maximum of twice per trial
---
I love it on billy and huntress
---
I’m not using headphones and I just woke up lmao. And the pallet didn’t save you, once again cry baby.
---
The numbers mason
---
That's strange considering it did and you're the only one crying over a pallet mate.
---
Feels bad. Idk rly but it was probably a bug since it's not like she had anything to gain - u'd closed the hatch so idk.
---
ngl demo got some nice thighs tho
---
How do you use "we're gonna live forever" wrong? It took my friends a few games to understand how dead hard works. Also self care is trash, don't level claudette. You sound like a moron who runs and self cares in a  corner everytime you get hit. L2p
---
You’re right, I shouldn’t’ve commented because someone LITERALLY listed why it’s a waste of a pallet. Have a good day/night.
---
It doesn't seem like it too me whenever I play lmao
---
New Perk: Once hooked you pick up the whole thing like an IV bag holder and walk around looking for the RN on duty.
---
That’s because matchmaking is still as fucked as ever sadly
---
Some people just wanna watch the world burn.
---
I believe it has to do with the fact that 3.2.0 was supposed to introduce dedicated servers, but they were delayed.
---
With dedicated servers, all players connect to a server. As it is now, all Survivors connect to the host. However, the 3.2.0 was designed with the former situation in mind. As such, it's wigging out for the last Survivor, since it is ending the session.
---
Hrrrrrngh, Nancy, I'm trying to transverse the upside down, but I'm DUMMY THICC and the clap of my ass cheeks keeps alerting the survivors!
---
Yeah you're right
---
With that lag the chest probably would have looted him instead.
---
Imagine bragging about being rank 6 ahah. It's almost end of season and you are still purple ranks, which this shit was cross platform.
---
I'm more worried about the "-" sign.
---
For the lazy
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
was it lag that caused them to dc? I just assumed they bounced when they saw the killers name/map or something
---
You gotta do what you gotta do for that 4k
---
That's not bragging it's correcting and I haven't been playing since a few days ago with my friend so you're digging yourself in a hole.
---
It doesn’t. It just doubles the match bloodpoints you get, it doesn’t double the total with all the bonuses applied. That’s why there’s no point in really saving BPS or Gateaus for double bloodpoint events. 
---
Think of double blood points as a permanent bloody party streamer offering until it’s over. That’s all it is. 
---
E.g. you’re a killer who’s burned a bloody party streamer. Double blood point is active and there’s only ONE bloody party streamer active.
---
Killer gets 32k.
---
32k (match points) + 32k (Double blood points) + 32k (streamers) = 96k. 
---
It does NOT do: 32k + 32k (bloody party streamers) = 64k x 2 = 128k.
---
Actually if it's not lit it's only 1000
---
Am I the only one who collects every Jigsaw Piece I see, not because I like the map, but because I'm a massive cunt and like making my SWF suffer

---
Im still laughing on how i stated what you said with a little bit more detail to it and i got negative 7 on it now man them leatherface mains sure are salty over us talking about them
---
As all things should be, my brother 😌
---
You can run deerstalker+infectious fright, trust me, it really helps at the end game and it's a really good combo for pretty much any part of the game
---
r/maybemaybemaybe
---
Any good killer will know this and spot it early.
---
The killer in my games started to bring a Mori every round
---
Yupp. I play red rank killer with sloppy (often not always) and it honestly amazes me how many people will self care with no medkit and then wonder why they lost. 
---
And then people on here still wanna argue with me and say self care is S tier and an absolute must on every build.
---
here's my template: [https://imgur.com/a/n3pNJH7](https://imgur.com/a/n3pNJH7)

With all that rage bubbling inside you must be a joy to play games with, guarantee you shreik at your screen when things don't go your way
---
Well yoy take it spirit fury takes a while to charge up and unlike insidious and Noed this is something where you actually have to do stuff to get it so i consider it fair vs insidious which is just a bi### perk that i still see rank 14s use for crying out loud its sad and its pathetic again im talking about bit## perks and not perks that kinda are fair like spirit fury and devour hope
---
Yes I know, so stupid. As killer you literally need to slug for the 4k. And even if you close the hatch, they can still have Adrenaline and a key to open the hatch again. And if they don't have a key, they can have a good rng on the gates and survive anyways.
---
So even if you're doing a great game as killer (clearly for a double pip) you can get fucked just because of the hatch that spawns regardless of the gens they did.
---
Legit trying to head their footsteps is like trying to hear a mouse running right next to a rampaging elephant.
---
Legion is not a chad and does not deserve to be with the chad two-steppers
---
*unzips pants* well shit
---
I can tell that the people who did give me negatives are killer mains only that dont know how to look at it from both points of views now some people may disagree with me but the fact that people like Truetalent have hard times surviving in games tells me that communication makes all the difference if you want a 4 man escape
---
Then they teabag at the exit gates thinking they just destroyed you
---
she was standing on top of the location you jump in on and that somehow blocked you. thats super weird
---
1000% this. Players DC cause of the BP discrepancy. Honestly I'm starting to support it. If DC'ing denies you that 25% stack which equals 4-5 times the BP I'll earn in the fucking match, then fuck it.
---
Sure, watch the player base drop to fuckall in a month. How about address the core of the issue and give survs the BP they deserve?
---
Jk my ass. This is the most toxic place I've ever been XD
---
r/dontputyourdickinthat I'll just leave this here.
---
?
---
wrong, the reason for waiting times is that currently most People play Killers
---
This game is still going strong
---
When someone DC’s, I drop the controller and jerk off. That usually gives the remaining survivors anywhere between 3 to 40 minutes to escape depending on how recent the last DC was.
---
It’s a really nice map as in the beauty and detail of it.  But if you think DBD wise the map is really one sided
---
&gt; literally 
---
Well, you literally don't know what that word means.
---
If you can't 4k without slugging, I feel bad for you son. I camped the last hook and I got my 4k done.
---
Second wind is trash
---
&gt; If there are other people there
---
Of course, but that's not what we're talking about here. Cymraeg was explicitly referring to waiting at the exit gate as the last survivor in a match, so that the killer get points for a last hit or by closing the hatch.
---
If you camp the last hook, the other survivor doesn't go for the save. He can already be on the hatch.
---
Great job! How long did it take?
---
Thank you
---
Was in a game where the hatch spawned right in front of a locker. Couldn’t get the prompt to jump in unless I approached it from a different angle.
---
I hate insideous as a perk, but I think you're right
---
Months
---
A lot of months
---
Well still a good accomplishment
---
Completely disagree.  Jake's hair looked so much better before:

Yea that's what we want more people to camp no insidious can just stay bad so we don't have more campers plz
---
thank you 
---
for this post of those jane lookalike cheeks has breathed life into my day
---
when you hit your obsession, your terror radius gets put on them, it works well on Legion since then you can frenzy stab your obsession and then run towards other people, even if the obsession goes far away enough that the killer instinct goes away, it's still good because the survivor has no idea you're coming because no terror radius and you know their approximate location
---
Not sure why this got downvoted but I totally agree. However, i think the bloodpoints that they lose should be redistributed to everyone. Overwatch has a similar feature for competitive matches.
---
I  safety pipped i think
---
Chainsaws I dont think need to get silenced. That would be a little too much.
---
They changed this add on to a different rarity later in the games life so now it’s a relic from before

It’s not a survivor rule least not for me personally if someone tries to bm their team I let that person go or I let em farm the guy

I wouldn’t find it pleasant if someone decided to point towards me after I got unhooked.
---
I love Spirit, she a bad bitch. And completely tweakin our on meth apparently
---
This is actually funny as helll and I get it, dudes a douche but it happens 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
Say it gives undetectable for like 5 seconds after doing something that would be better than unlimited no terror radius standing still. That way you can’t camp with it.
---
Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill!
---
Just use Unbreakable, they can't slug you if you have Unbreakable.
---
I just reinstalled this week and wanted to see the Demogorgon Mori. :(
---
Isn't this just a kyf lobby.....there's only two of you showing in the bottom left survivor list so either you got a bug where two people didn't load in but the match started or this is just Reddit bait with kyf footage (also could be how console displays stuff but I don't play that mess so idk)
---
Not really funny after 4 minutes
---
Why does that matter? It's the luck of the draw. Sometimes the reverse can happen and a camping 1 hook killer can find the hatch before the survivor who did all 5 gens.
---
It's double bp right now anyone who wants to farm effectively is playing killer thus long queue times play survivor and you'll get almost instant queues
---
Oof, thats a toxic group. Hopefully you dont encounter too many more of those, I've played DBD for a bit and thankfully dont run into too many of these.
---
Seriously, I’ve noticed the people who don’t teabag tend to be the least toxic. Had a game a bit back where one guy was confident enough to loop me a bit more even though he had the gate on his side, teabagging and spamming his flashlight, and apparently he forgot NOED is a thing lol. Needless to say, major salt in the postgame chat even though his death was totally avoidable and he only had himself to blame for being a cocky prick.
---
That's rare and only the wee babes think it the case. Might help their self esteem a little to let them go, but it's a good life lesson to maybe keep them on their toes.
---
Inner strength doesn’t activate “nurses calling” so it’s the best healing perk
---
I feel like only five seconds would be kinda useless, stand still for 3 seconds then be undetectable for 5?
---
Waited 30+ min to get my rituals done this morning (Pig, Plague and Spirit) and  absolutely dunked on everyone despite not playing for a few months.
---
how the fuck 3 people disconnected after 2 seconds the match started
---
Oh shit oh fuck better find the locker quick
---
It doesn’t have to be standing still. But look at demogorgon he has undetectable for like 3 seconds coming out of portal and I catch people off guard all the time with that.
---
Did you camp? Or they just saying that
---
Seriously, am I the only one that thinks this is unfair? Hatch spawning regardless of the gens done and survivor can still have a key to escape...
---
thank you!
---
no but in that case it's totally fair because I only play killer so it doesn't effect me
---
I'm a killer main and I'd appreciate some help learning survivor, I've leveled a survivor and have been collecting perks by way of shrine but never gotten past rank 15. I'm on ps4 all day today may for psn info. Cheers!

-mmu!

idk, will probs end up doing more than one a day cuz i have alot of stuff to draw for spooktober. Will do salty lips today.

No arrogance here, just trying to help another player get better. I’m not gonna argue with you since you’re the human equivalent of a broken record, repeating ‘tHe PaLleT sAvEd mE’ no matter what anyone else says, so I won’t waste my time. Have a good day :)
---
That window loop lmao. The design seems to go against what they were hoping for, which means they either didnt give a fuck or are so bad they completely didnt notice it during testing. Not sure which is worse.
---
Yes, I'd rather deny the killer those points for being a twat :). Also, you don't lose pips anymore, where have you been ?

Always loop never wait at pallets learn how to run good loops (eg cow tree,shack,jungle gyms learn the timing for saves (flashlights, pallets body blocking hooks) don’t waist time learning how to 360 you can’t 360 a good killer, always be doing gens when your teammates are being chased. Good luck!
---
Two perk slots tho
---
Especially with the silent bell, that’s my favorite.
---
sad
---
I played a game with doc, BBQ 2, and a survivor pudding, every catagory had 8,000 bloodpoints, except sacrifice because a textbook toxic nea that got caught twice dc'd.  *I will never forgive her*
---
Did I ask for 'help' No. Have I made it clear I don't want your 'help' Yes. So it's clear you still being contradicts that. The pallet did save me and that's what's not going into your ape-brain therefore I have to keep repeating it.
---
Yeah that egg timer really introduces so much counterplay once the exit gates are open. Totally changes the game.
---
Sr Pelo should do a dbd parody like with Undertale but instead of Papyrus, Spirit is Waluigi
---
They did say they did a pretty good job so far like haven't you gotten hit when you've dropped the pallet before they could lunge
---
The bottom right skull is obviously Claudette/Adam/Tapp
---
It's not bad. But the others are definitely better. Take it from me I've been playing with this one since the DLC launched. 
---
I think second wind just compliments an altruistic-aligned survivor. It could definitely use a buff tho. Something like reduced time, comboing with deliverance, or not being consumed when downed. 
---
Otherwise it's alright. Nothing spectacular
---
Or I could use my brain cells to kill David and then get more blood points for myself for getting the other guy
---
Ape-brain. Ouch, slinging insults straight from preschool, lol. You don’t need to take my advice, obviously, I’m just offering it to you. No need to be such a sour bitch because a few people are critiquing your gameplay.
---
So that’s what’s in Area 51
---
The entity was like "fuck it here you go"
---
Killers who have inherent stealth negation will be more favored. Also it’s a timed match so yes the survivor could stay hidden all game and get a low amount of BP or get more from stuns, chases and the like  I didn’t write out every last detail so I would expect BP gains from the more to be fast and decent. 
---
Hell maybe there can be objects like the Chinese New Year event the survivor has to try to grab for more points and the killer has to destroy them too.
---
GG ez
---
Oh sorry I never DC so I wouldnt know lol and you realize you are doing the exact opposite of your intentions right?
---
What you are trying to do: piss the killer off, ruin his match, punish him for camping, and make him regret the decision right?
---
What you are actually doing: encouraging the killer to camp more. Hes gonna think "hey when I face camp people they usually just leave the game. I can do this to the first one or two people and the match will be easy af" then they proceed to facecamp everyone in Hope's of an easy match.
---
What you SHOULD be doing to piss of the killer: just sit there through the entire struggle phase and everything. Unless your other survivors are all braindead they will basically get a free win and the killer will only get 1k and almost no points. He will start to think "hey when I facecamp people, I get crushed by the rest of the team. Maybe facecamping is not a good strategy after all."
---
''Ouch, slinging insults straight from preschool, lol.'' ''such a sour bitch'' - Could you fucking get any dumber..
---
You said to go celebrate in a locker. That’s being stereotypical lol
---
I'm actually rank 17 messed up the title
---
And you asked how u were being judgmental and it was because you made a judgment
---
Giving inexperienced players the hatch and knocking out good players ASAP is bad?
---
You do you.
---
Thank you so much I'll make sure to put this to good use
---
I've been getting that and numerous other errors keeping me from joining. On top of waiting 5+ minutes to find a game.
---
I think a non gens objective would be great. Like you have to find a hidden object somewhere in the map, and then bring it to one of 3 or 4 set locations. So the killers have a chance to see you running about but cant just camp the locations
---
From my own experience on this subbreddit people get extremely mad when you propose killer buffs or when you object their "balanced" new perks
---
Example: one guy argued with me about a perk that allowed you to throw your Item to stun a killer, basically a reloadable decisive strike 
---
Meanwhile in another post where i suggested clown buffs people rushed on me and flamed because "clown is fine because his power counters looping"
---
People in this game dont want diversity or changes
---
They want to feel the power role and abuse it as much as possible - dont believe me? Check for how many people thought mettle of Man was a balanced and ok perk or how old legion was actually healthy for the game.
---
I normally slug to slow the game down. If I know someone is dead on hook I like to give them a chance of being revived to do gens while I hunt whoever picked them up. I just think games go way to quick i.e. if you're good killer and getting fast hooks or you get gen rushed. The long 15 minute wait isnt worth it if the game ends in 10 minutes.
---
Nearly similar to what I said, to shorten his hair again but the bangs should stay since it is in his portrait but I do think it It should be shorter too to match his portrait.

I wish I had these totem spawns as survivor. Feels like literally every game the first 3 min are spent all the survivors just running around the map trying to find it.
---
This is the thing, most of time when i vault when being chased the game will stutter in a frame and then the killer hits me or if i try drop a palette. They need to get rid of that shit where the killer is our host even with trash connection. Why can’t they just give host to the best connection in the lobby 🤦🏿‍♂️. I know dedicated servers take some work but idk what they’re doing about that. I like the game but the lagging, getting popped after I cleared a pallet already is annoying and it kills momentum (at least for me).
---
Maybe they should fix their damn game then.
---
I think I know where you’re going with that and I would advise choosing out the only black characters in a game. Just don’t do that.
---
I had this problem to on PC. High ranks i.e. 20 to 15 take forever to find games due to the lack of players in that rank range with combo of bad servers and double points and everyone is playing killer.
---
You get like a 3 second head start which isn’t that much tbh
---
Yuuuup. PS4 too.
---
Rule #837
---
"Killers should not be able to win"
---
- Survivors' rules book for killers
---
&gt;They did say they did a pretty good job so far like haven't you gotten hit when you've dropped the pallet before they could lunge
---
Well, like I said, the example here is running in a straight line against a basic M1 killer, why bring pallets to the discussion? 
---
There are situations where hitboxes and hit registration aren't working properly but this thread isn't the case.
---

---
That’s Everyone after the latest patch trying to deranged themselves 💯
---
omg you got looped 5 gens noob
---
BBQ makes it so that whenever you hook a survivor you see all survivors that are outside a 32-meter range of the hook, I believe 
---
It also makes it so that each time you hook a survivor for their first time, it increases all the BP you gain by 25%, so you can get a 100% BP bonus at the end of the game
---
Dont make a locker your home, if a gen is 99% and the killer approaches just finish it and take the hit but dont get grabbed, leave dull totems allone unless you have inner strength or you have a suspicion that the killer has noed, dont farm ur teamm8s, remember to do the but dance when at the exit gate
---
That pisses me off, then I'm like "I just left, what do you think is gonna happen??"
---
Yes and no, sometimes it's better to bail while other times that speed boost can help you pop the gen before the killer gets there especially when it's crunch time. I used to run spine chill a bunch but am learn that it isn't really that great except for stealth killers, but even then you should have a basic understanding of where the killer is before working on a gen.
---
But my emperor, we already execute that one!
---
How about order 69 ?
---
So, this is going to sound, like, really bad, but...
---
Just get better. You have to keep playing to be able to outplay and outmaneuver them. 
---
Unless this is ironic.
---
So, whenever you hook a survivor it shows the aura of everyone else for a few seconds. And you get a stack for hooking a survivor. 1 stack for each survivor you hook. You can earn a total of 4 stacks and that means you'll get double blood points at the end. Very useful perk for leveling each killer so it's very smart to get leatherface to 40.
---
No doubt, Lisa might have had it the absolute worst.
---
Meanwhile iron maiden:  ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
---
Yeah
---
If you aren't doing it to be toxic, then just kill yourself on the hook lmao much less toxic
---
Each hooked survivor increases your bloodpoints by 25% up to 50%/75%/100%. When you hook anybody, reveals other survivors aura, if they are at least 40 meters away from the hook. The catch is, you need to hook different survivors to gain the bloodpoint bonus.
---

Of course lol and i run BT like a self respecting survivor

I've noticed a drop in respect with players recently. Used to let someone get hatch every so often and now I see it very rarely. (don't wanna sound like an annoying survivor main I know survivors can be dickheads too.) Seems like people are losing view of the fun and are just getting greedy nowadays!
---
Have a nice day :)
---
Gorges gotta poop 2 you know
---
The killer didn't even kill you in that pic.
---
It would be technically possible to lagswitch individual players.
---
Perks need to be rethought but the concept of the entity itself is a good one. I personally think mist should be default form and it floats around finding survivors and has a hard time holding physical form long.

---
Should be yellow again tbh
---
I don't think you should expect a killer to just *give* you the escape. Sure it's nice when they do, but it's not necessary at all
---
No no no, it goes like this:  
---
Hex: Ruin
---
Causes a random explosion in 15 seconds after a match started.
---
The Hamburglar DLC when?
---
It´s too complicated. All that setup for a heal that can be achieved with different perks. True, Second Wind is a bit more practical than Self Care or sitting in a Locker, but all that setup and conditions required for it make it not worth it. Not to mention how easily you can get screwed when a friedly teammate starts healing with you.
---
Meanwhile I can just do a totem at the start of the game with IS and have that heal primed and ready anytime.
---
oh, must be misinformed :D

10/10 funny meme

remember that the timer is de-sinc'd for survivors, they didn't commit suicide

It is random. I have ran past it chasing people with more than one alive.

Very. But you still have games where everyone cleanses always.

You leave Quentin alone. He's suffered enough :(!

She did not have mettle of man when I saw her perks post game.

It only took *one*

50 second heal if everyone is injured lol
---
Not when there is 5 gens to do.
---
Agree that Doc does need buffs. Your suggestion is good since all too often I zap a Survivor and they drop the pallet anyways. I'd also honestly suggest that Mouldy Electrode should be baseline (or at least its range increase should be) since base zap range is really bad.
---
Doc needs to be way less reliant on addons overall.

Bro, just press struggle twice. It's not hard. Just because you aren't doing it to be toxic doesn't mean you aren't toxic. You aren't some level headed fountain of logic, You just throw a mini tantrum and quit whenever things don't go immediately your way.

It's not like the streamers, envelopes and gateaux are cumulative, they are additive.
---
Toxic gen rusher
---
Killers like... what the fuck...
---
I don't respect killer who go out of their way to slug, rather than taking an opportunity to get 2 players at once.
---
\*shrugs\* I still want it cause two demogorgon are better than one. Also double legion
---
fucking yikes
---
Oh I gotcha. Then yeah it is a luck of the draw thing. But normally when 5 are left the lone survivor got screwed my teammates or dcs. I let them live. If they played the game right why would I punish them
---
Unless they blind at pallets. Then fuck you and your flashlight. Your the entities problem then.
---
I only get killers who don't want to farm even with multiple BPS. It almost seems like most of the games I get are killers trying to end it as fast as humanely possible so survivors only get 7k max bloodpoints and then it adds up to what a good game of points would be if it wasn't the blood hunt. It kinda sucks because I was hoping for more for my first hunt ):
---
I mean your right but I thought it was weird that I just stood getting games all of a sudden. I had no problem connecting earlier and now I just can't
---
They do nothing but encourage the "us vs them" narrative, but please, keep thinking these are quality memes.

---
Yeah, I play both but I get bored of the long waiting times in killer. Also Happy Cake Day!
---
Only when there’s a franklin’s and that’s a given but I usually hold on to my items when I’m not against a bubba.
---
This is the people we need spread the message!
---
Yh ikr why do they make it so bad for
---
That's my whole point of this discussion and I'm not sure why I'm being downvoted. With 5 gens left and only 1 survivor alive I think it's pretty obvious that a hatch escape is unfair, because the killer did a good game and still can get fucked by a random hatch spawn and maybe a clutch stupid key.
---
I'm not waiting for approval to use it. I find it funny, I'll use it.
---
Ohh so you are telling me i have to be good at the game to get this. Welp looks like my Steve will stay untouched
---
I don‘t get it.
---
Nope! Just gotta pump enough points into Steve
---
Don’t play Legion? Legion is probably the worst killer in the game right now so you’re kind of setting yourself up for failure.
---
Hopefully between this and a few other issues *cough EGC timer *.... They'll extend this out a few more days
---
It is rare for a killer to dominate like that with out DCs, or other help from survivors. Why punish the one guy that stayed in the game? Or the one guy who didnt kill himself on the hook. Or the one guy that actually tried to have fun playing the game the way it is supposed to be played.
---
Well I enjoy playing legion but you are right
---
Double bloodpoint event is on at the moment. Killers earn more BPs than survivors per game mostly, so killer ques are longer.
---
It's not pointless shit, I dont want you ruining games for other rank 16's on console. How are you same rank as new players. PS: stop getting triggered you're embarrassing yourself
---
But only works 5 times.
---
I'm missing out on double BP weekend sigh
---
stereotypical
---
He was being sarcastic
---
They just discovered a bug that allowed her to have arms.
---
Are you a fucking child I can't believe what I just read..
---
Long is an understatement
---
Thanks ill try :) since we are talking already do you know is there a page or something like that where i can see prestige rewards in dbd? So i can know who will get all the bloodpoints :D
---
Sucks to be you
---
Bro I got into plenty of games and people are just leaving no lag perfect internet and all they just trying to derank trust me seen it at least 15 times since the last update I and it’s not cause of a lag at all
---
no the problem is you trying to communicate
---
I hate it as killer too, it just makes the game feel way to easy and not fun at all
---
Wow, that was pretty much amazing xD
---
I constantly have to switch my NAT type back to Open
---
Or maybe don't slug the second to last guy in hopes of circumventing a game mechanic? I'd be all for Blood Warden stopping hatch for 30 seconds tbh.
---
Record your game show that the game is removing your BP and send it into BHVR on their website. They'll probably compensate you with BP and or have a fix for you.
---
Legion needs certain perks to help him out. Nurses Calling and Sloppy Butcher is a good combo, it should help slow the game down while you get your hooks. Also Hex: Ruin and maybe even Thanatophobia.
---
If it was dc's then yeah I give the guy the hatch but if it was only my merit I might as well want to double pip, I think it's fair.
---
funny how i found you from a really old minecraft post and now i see you also like dbd
---
Nothing about the game is fair. You don't need a 4k to have fun. And you aren't supposed to 4k every time, just like survivors don't need a 4-man escape to have fun.
---
You poor soul. Foggers in chat for this poor person
---
No that's fair. I was inferring to the more common event of the guy getting screwed over. Hell if you dominate get your perfect game.
---
And also I don’t have hex ruin unlocked
---
I wouldn't say they were toxic, far from the worst team I've been against when it comes to toxicity. 
---
It was all good fun and they were friendly enough at end game (apart from the guy who dies at the beginning of the clip cross map, he was a bit salty).
---
It's ok if you want to attack my hobby instead of the argument, it's cool.
---
Doesn’t come across.
---
Thanks for understanding this. You're the only one in hundreds of users that just downvoted without reading.
---
every time i've tried to do that something goes wrong and the killer has internet problems.
---
I don't think he's underrated as a lot of people put him high on tier lists. I do however think people just don't enjoy playing him since he's been in the game forever and or he's just not as fun as other killers, despite him being good.
---
I can taste the salt from here, would hate to be that guy.
---
No problem! Ruin will be a good investment if you plan on maining killer. In my experience, when survivors see the lack of ruin they go right into gen rush mode.
---
"In Soviet Russia..."
---
that was 600 before. When did they change that ?
---
It’s a 40 meter range not 32.
---
Thanks for trying to help me
---
Legion: how’d they know?
---
If you plan on maining killer Ruin will be a great investment in the long run. Survivors tend to go into gen rush mode when they don’t see it, and when they do see it they sometimes spend way too much time looking for it.
---
How many people were killed/sacrificed?
---
I dont get the point of camping in general but jfc the Wraith is perfectly designed to hook someone then haul ass and start harassing generators, why would anyone camp as him it's almost as bad as camping with Billy
---
"BuT i CAnT trUST My TEAmaTEs !"
---
yea if you run in a fucking corner at the other side of the map instead of coming to a gen to repair we won't find you genius.
---
I think the hatch spawns if you have a functioning key after the first 2 gens are done, that'll be what happened.
---
There's a hatch that opens if a couple gens are done while some survivors are dead.
---
I completely killed 1 for sure, but im not sure if i completely killed another 1. Basically 1 or 2
---
I think you meant a broken key
---
If you need to heal more than 5 times in a game idk what to tell you
---
It’s good on every killer except plague since survivors don’t have to heal against her they can just cleanse. Works best on stealth killers like pig and ghostface who can sneak up in healing survivors, ranged killers (huntress) who can just throw a hatchet and down the survivor, and nurse who can just blink to where the survivor is healing.
---
Oh okay thanks
---
The Claudette was right in front of Michael as he used tier 3
---
OP had not yet explained that when I typed out this comment. I was guessing about what may have happened before there was any context given. But thanks for pointing it out.
---
The hatch spawns when the amount of survivors alive + 1 gens are done. 
---
It’s impossible for 3 gens to be left and the hatch spawns
---
oh ok but it still takes aloooot of time for survivors
---
Np! If you find it and it's open, you can close it btw
---
I know that so I will try to get ruin
---
Im sure it was 3.
---
Its the number on the bottom left of the screen right ?
---
It was 3 am sure
---
Is this a thing?  
---
  
---
I've got a whopping 10 hours in the game so far. Super noob.  
---
Last night I was against a Wraith and they managed to kill all three other survivors, and hooked me twice through the match. They caught me at the escape gate and downed me, then carried me to the hatch and dropped me on it.  
---
I had no idea what was going on. All of my other games have been survivors disconnecting in the first 60 seconds of a match and killers hooking me once then standing there staring at me waiting for the timer so nobody can come pull me off the hook.
---
The most common one is that some textures will flicker with a bright purple light, but it's not so bad where it affects gameplay. Then some maps cause my frame rate to tank pretty bad; like Gideon's and Hawkins Lab. I had a match last night in the lab and could barely hit anybody because the frame rate was so bad.
---
These are issues I've only experienced while playing killer. Survivor side has been pretty smooth for me so far.
---
Not yet actually
---
I didn't dc cuz I got juked
---
Cool thanks
---
I didn’t mind that fact she killed me but the fact she didn’t let me just finish opening the gate since she was standing behind me like it’s extra BP fest.
---
I edited my reply. I think you’re right and yes that’s the number at the bottom left of the screen
---
Alright thanks!
---
Where do they get the key from though ? How can i protect it
---
You mean like a freddy with swing chains and paint brush who mories everyone on first hook and then just says it's for a daily?
---
The why did you say “lit or not it’s 1500 points” when it should’ve been “if it’s lit I get 1500 if it’s not I get 1000”
---
I didn’t mind the fact she killed me more the fact she didn’t let me open the gate for the BP since it’s extra bp fest. She was standing behind me she could of at least let me open the gate.
---
I should have clarified I didn't DC because I got juked, I was bored and wanted to play Minecraft
---
The hatch allows people to escape before all the generators are done, it will appear when either only one survivor remains or the amount of completed generators is higher than the amount of living survivors, normally the hatch will only open for the last survivor but the survivor can use a key to open it even when more people are alive
---
Giving hatch is something some people do. You shouldn't really expect it because it's a competitive game, people aren't dicks just because they get the 4 man, but it's something nice some folk do.
---
Some people do it for respectful and strong survivors, some people do it for baby survivors because they feel bad for slaughtering their team
---
They can find it in game (unlikely) or they bring it into the match. 
---
Pay attention to the pre-game lobby screen. You can see what the survivors are bringing into the game and adjust accordingly. Franklin’s Demise is a good counter
---
Yeah I’m on PS4 as well and I’ve been 8 minutes to get a match as survivor.
---
Best perk in the game. Slows everyone down.
---
Been disconnected a few times during the blood hunt. Just super laggy.
---
Two of three of my SWF group has this happening to us before. swapped games because in the end were just wasting item/offerings
---
NOED on Bubba lol
---
On the same token as a killer main even if I try to farm I just get sweaty survivor lobbies that do all gens with toolbox amd get out with barely 10k points for anyone that didn't get chased for a bit because they do all gens in 4-5 mins and just ditch
---
*sorts by controversial*
---
This should be fun
---
So then surely you should understand why in this instance that’s not a good idea. Regarding the picture in the post
---
U can camp hook and ppl not know thats why I don’t care for him, typically i play killer anymore but when im. Survivor and its wraith I typically get camped
---
So you just assumed they were toxic and called them assholes?
---
Where is bond??
---
I never saw a Freddy doing such things, my such nasty encounters have been mostly with Spirits, Bubbas and Trappers which is a shame coz I myself am a trapper main
---
Clown Bug. If you are hit while in the gas and using BL you will have infinite haste without the buff effect being shown on the right until hit by the gas
---
Same, still have a red envelope from the first event
---
Well yeah Coxcombed Clapper + Ghost Soot addons are his best.  All Seeing Blood as well. But using him with no addons at red ranks is a GG most of the games
---
He’s a lot of fun to play as. I definitely don’t put him in the top 5, though.
---
Completely level up hag to 35 i think maybe 40 and get nurse to 35 maybe 40 as well and get their teachable
---
The closest I've gotten to actually getting a game is when it started loading in and them mid-load I got the "DISCONNECTED FROM HOST" and "MATCH CANCELLED" messages. Bout to go play something else because I haven't been able to play at all in an hour because of these issues.
---
Jeff and Jane, seeing another one of my kind is rarer than getting a Killer lobby.
---
ah that makes sense. didn’t see the spectate at the bottom
---
But then that godly bill comes and saves you and has borrowed and you are just so goddamn happy
---
Ghostface
---
Yeah it wasn’t I had camp and to get one person  which I normally don’t do
---
They reload when you grab someone out of a locker.
---
Same. As survivor as well. I have been trying several times for 30 min now and still no games.
---
I mean I'd say 10 seconds or less. 1 min is overkill
---
PS4 playing Ace with rainbow map, escaped and was informed I lost the item. Confirmed it's not in my inventory anymore. I have video of the match if you need, though it's on my PS4 and not sure how to upload it.
---
Maybe they’re referring to how much of a big brain they have that pallet stubs don’t have to touch the killer to stun in red ranks
---
You’re 100% 13 years old
---
Yeak ikr fuck you lol
---
Why do I feel like this is the exact luck that Steve Harrington would have?
---
HAHAHAHAHA OMG
---
That’s what I was worried about. Some people were talking about them being there but I am getting nothing but purpose of the same basic perks. I can’t imagine the bloodpoints grind for characters without BBQ. 
---
I hope something will be done about this.
---
Ghostface is a better version of Myers and Plague is kinda boring
---
His points/second rate is enormous though.
---
Didn't know being born in 1996 makes you 13 that's strange..
---
plague is fun ghostface is better
---
Honestly didn't know he was getting a rework XD I haven't been paying attention to Dev streams and stuff... I really should lol
---
Reddit moment
---
Ghost because mix and match cosmetics
---
I just got a lobby
---
But the entity is meant to be OP
---
His rework will probably come in a few good months tho. They gotta rework nurse first.
---
So not too soon, but hopefully it will be worth the wait
---
“That’s the spirit!”
---
No that’s the legion
---
Dang
---
former-jane main here, just wanted to say that she's thicc in case u didn't know
---
r/angryupvote
---
"What's with camping (insert killer here)?"
---
Nothing, just your luck. People camp and it has nothing to do with the character they are using.
---
that’s the legion
---
Literally watched it happen with Unbra. She didn’t even know someone was there. She was reloading hatchets and they refilled as she pulled someone out. She hooked them and went back to the locker, not realizing they refilled. And then she opened the locker again, doing the hatchet refill animation. But her hatchets were already at 5 so that’s where they stayed. Unless they changed that in a recent patch, or if that particular one was a glitch, then that’s definitely how it is.
---
where did you get your perks from, they look cool!!
---
[deleted]
---
It’s probably ur internet then
---
Killers have longer queue times than usual because of the Bloodhunt. On average you make more BP playing killer, so more people are playing killer to grind out BP
---
I've had 1 good game where the guy let us do some farming when 2 people dc'd, about 80% of my other games are full of camping and moris
---
That is I’m trying to do right now
---
It's great fun. For survivors and killers alike. The rush of the hunt and hiding from the killer, finding survivors is intense and satisfying. 
---
Great game! I wish I had found it sooner... but xbox Game pass!
---
FBI this post right here
---
It’s possible she didn’t know. I’m new to the game  (a week in) and that wouldn’t have even crossed my mind. Level 48 doctor main atm, and I body most parties. I probably would have just grabbed you without thinking too tbh
---
Negative 4, RIP in the chat
---
Killers that don't have any sort of mobility really need a buff..game is ridiculous in the current state
---
I think i figured out it works, would like a dev to reach out.
---
1 BP a second would be awful lol
---
Yeah but hey life is never gonna be fair there are gonna be those dick heads and the match making can be better it still takes forever to get into a match
---
That’s why he won’t play for a week so he can regain his luck
---
Bad bad me.
---
I wish you luck and thanks for your word
---
Internet works solid in every game I play. I did not have these issues with dbd until recently when I picked up the game again.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Honestly, I think add-ons should ehance play style, not be required to play them. Much like Myers
---
I usually run Selfcare with Botany Knowledge, so I can mitigate the penalty, and do a lightning speed heal on others
---
I wish his mori cut scene was revamped. His mori is kinda boring in my opinion.
---
Yeah you didn’t deserve these downvotes, all you’re doing is trying to give new players that are matched up unfairly against higher level killers a break.
---
Gamer girl water
---
Or tea
---
Nice one
---
I just had this happen to me in a game as the Doctor. I used a Bloody party streamer so we all profit in the end, and had every intention of letting them just leave at the end. I just abused Shock Treatment for the points, and stalked all over, hooked them once so they could get points, until they DC because of said hook. I mean, I wasn't even playing to kill, it was so obvious! I just wanted to share in the BP earnings (And maybe a little sadistic torture on the way :P)
---
I recommend Michael since he's pretty easy to use as well as being fun and effective
---
Jane for looks
---
*AYAYAYAAAA*
---
I got 69420 bp once
---
Gg Ez
---
One time I did that
---
METHIONYLTHREONYLTHREONYGLUTAMINYLARGINYLISOLEUCINE I know long words too😲😲😲 🎤v
---
Yeah that happens. Try checking it twice before you do em
---
It's why I always take triple trap bag. He is really powerful the more traps he can put down at the start. Those are the secret traps as I call them since no ones around to watch you place it.
---
Meg earned it
---
With huntress the problem is the design of the killer. Her ability to hurl hatchets encourages players to proxy camp hooks from a distance, looking directly and aiming the hatchet to release just as the save occurs.
---
As a survivor if I save I try to take the hit. If I'm saved, I always bring DS. Not much else to do.
---
sure he sometimes presses m2 on them.   
---
I mean he doesnt expect the traps to be stepped if they do then whoop. he just lays them out on windows and pallets to get rid of them. Otz on the other hand plans traps, herds them towards it and plays around it.
---
With GF he only stalks when theres an unsuspecting surv. break him out once or twice and he'll play like a powerless m1 killer throught the whole game. Otz on the other hand, stalks mid chase and 99 them for later, while pressuring other survs.
---
yeah Tru3 is great at the game, but i dunno man when I watch him i feel kinda sad. Once he meets a toxic opponent i switch streamers, since he'll go on ranting for a long time
---
What’s noclipping?
---
nobody wants to play against nurse, but it's not a reason to dc
---
I just don’t like her scream
---
It would lead to killers dodging swf lobbies wayy more. I would be fine with it if both survivors and killers could only dodge a certain number of lobbies
---
I’m having that issue as a survivor too. Been 15 minutes and no lobby yet.
---
Well actually I'm Irish so I drink whisky
---
Do you know how? :(
---
*When someone thinks that DBD is a competitive-level game.
---
FTFY
---
First of all, I'm not talking about mysel, I'm a survivor main. When I play killer, I rarely slug but i can understand why most of the killers slug for the 4k.
---
If survivors did a good game (1 gen left for example) then yeah don't slug because 1 survivor at least deserve to have the hatch. However, if you kill 3 survivors without any gen being done, it's TOTALLY UNFAIR for the killer that the other survivor escape. And that only happens because hatch spawns regardless of how many gens were done.
---
a fellow rivatuner 62 fps cap gamer
---
I've been waiting for a change on no mither. I'd love to have full health until you're injured, and then you gain the broken status. That way you aren't immediately fucked when the killer finds you.
---
If it's in the game and it works, why should killers gimp themselves sp survivors can have a more fun? I don't see survivors deciding to not do gens, not bring instant heals, or not run exhaustion perks. Blame the developers for not making better perks. Off meta builds can work, but one you hit Sweatyville you're better off just defaulting to the top three killers and their best add ons. Or you're gonna have a bad time.
---
I am as well, we literally only get to play 3 man games because if we have 4 people it keeps saying that.
---
&gt;nobody wants to play against nurse, but it's not a reason to dc
---
I take playing against Nurse over Spirit any day.
---
I like getting heal points.
---
true
---
i like to live life on the edge.
---
Wtf are you even talking about?
---
So toxic, didn't even give the killer a chance smh
---
Isn't winning technically anything that isn't "Entity Displeased"?
---
Same with Trapper's. 
---
Really wish Trapper's had him like, place a bear trap, and then grab the survivor by the head and curb stomp them into it (which is a really weird thing to wish for lmao).
---
Not everyone uses headphones
---
Wait, what happened? Survivor was to his right, then suddenly was behind the brick pillar.
---
Not the skill check ones, the ones that increase how many boxes there are or gives you more traps, or even the one that decreases the amount of time they have
---
Imagine bragging about any rank at all like you ahah.
---
Yeah. Let's Legion-ify every killer. Make her screen completely black while phasing, and if she hits you during post phase somehow it just applies deep wounds and can't down. Also, make her movement speed equal to the nurse so she can't chase without BL3. Perfect.
---
Can’t get in a game as survivor. PS4
---
I play all three of them and I don't agree with ghosface being better than myers. Their stalking capabilities are different and so are their playstiles.
---
With Michael you can play hugely different styles depending on his addons, and you can stalk even if they see you.
---
Ghostface has the advantage of having no terror radius, but experienced survivors will get you out of stalk mode over and over again. He is extremely fun to play, though. 
---
Plague is an unique killer which becomes almost invincible if survivors cleanse.
---
About the perks, I'd say both Myers and Plague have better perks than Ghostface.
---
Save the best for last and the new dying light are great, corrupt intervention and infectious fright too, while Ghostface's only strong perk is thrilling tremors.
---
I feel like the key there is “when I’m far ahead” that’s one thing, but I really feel that losing and then using farming to get a sacrifice is slimes.
---
This is an interaction in the game that some players don't get right, and still act like it's on the killer to search the bushes when they just saw someone run away. 
---
If you are going to go for a save, and not be ready to take a hit so *actually* save them, then you are not good at survivor. Sorry.
---
Sometimes the killer has no play, and the noise notification is all they have, so you need to take the aggro, or simply trade if the situation calls for it.
---
When there is no collision to something so you go right through it
---
began with an N and ended with an R.
---
Were you just in the same game as me? I just played against the huntress and they were hardcore camping the last 3 gens and wouldn’t let anyone near them but wouldn’t chase you either.
---
I thought it was just me cuz I wasn’t seeing any posts here about it. I had to quit playing last night cuz it just stopped connecting me to games.
---
PS4. Trying to play killer, get stuck in the pre-lobby screen searching for 30 minutes. Never found a game. Been like this for 3 days.
---
I know thanatphobia isn't great on with those Myers addons but at the same time typically there isn't a point to healing once the addons activate but now it's making the already injured survivors make the choice between trying to do gens or waste time healing the point is to buy time like hex ruin.
---
This is every Nea player in the community. It’s expected for them to BM and get reprimanded for it.
---
Please expand servers.
---
Ghostface for sure
---
Because there's no advice needed nothing I did was wrong. I've been playing for 2+ years and I'm rank 6 from the past few days it's just cocky idiots like you looking for the smallest thing to let loose your internet rage. Also if we're going to go by your logic and give random advice then here's some for you - don't claim someone is 13 then write 'tryna' it makes you look silly. xo
---
Since you seem to be big on affect, my opinion shouldn't affect you. So I don't know why you keep trying to change a stranger's mind.
---
No, it's hidden.
---
Meanwhile calm spirit
---
Why? Pubg mobile is pretty fun. Dbd mobile doesnt seem to be on the app store so why would people assume there are a ton of players? I'm so super duper confused by your comment. Am I out of the loop?
---
I can play how I want. Not everyone plays games to get better.
---
Trapper is also one of the killers that Otz plays most so of course he's better with him. I agree Tru can get salty sometimes and Otz is known for the opposite. Regardless, ppl are entitled to their own opinion who they like more.
---
Be patient. You have very weak perks. When you get some of the good ones you will start winning a lot of games. Legion also grants you lots of points.
---
I have only about 100 hours as killer, and the correct mindset is to play killer for points and learning experience. I also don't have/use hex ruin in half my killers. Get bbq and chili ASAP. Good luck with your games.
---
They tried it, it broke the game.
---
I laughed so hard I squeaked
---
It’s taking way longer than normal for me too. Gave up after assuming something’s broken.
---
They are not half bad. They are one of the best chaser/tracker killers of the game and they tend to get a lot of bloodpoints.
---
I also await the rework since the last one they did turned Freddy from a joke to arguably the 3rd best killer in the game. Thrilled to see what they could do to the killer gang.
---
It makes no sense for them to be survivors, they should 100% be a killer, but one that accidentally kills people. So all the animations of them killing and hooking would be survivors tripping and jumping into hooks and whatnot
---
Advice doesn’t have to be asked for, people do genuinely do it to help others. Why not just appreciate it lol. Also no it doesn’t tbh because I’m not heated like you :)
---
Unfortunately not since you have to perform the 'Damage Generator Action' but it's still a great perk to run with those 2
---
It doesn't go away with time, only gameplay. Sacrifices must be made to compensate for this clip.
---
I love legion. Just be prepared for extra salt :/ In my experience, my legion brings out the salt way more than any other killer I play
---
yep im definitely biased
---
Yeah I’m trying to play on ps4 right now and it took over 20 minutes as a survivor to find a lobby. :/
---
Oh ok
---
...They could be in a 3 man group? Which would make it quite likely...
---
Yes it absolutly is. This game has a Ranking system, so whilst the thought might seem nice at first you are actually punishing good people for teamwork and keeping them out of higher ranks, whilst forcing new players to play against higher rank killers ruining future games for both them and their teammates who now have to deal with a noob in a much more difficult game.
---
Maybe, I go afk a lot. 
---
But I think at least 200 of the hours are before the level system.
---
It sucks for characters you need perks for but don't play. First of all has to buy hag and then grind them to 40. That's alot of BP going into a character you don't want to play.
---
No! Even if they are a 3 man SWF, there is no way they all DC at the same exact time. Also its a known bug atm that some people randomly disconnect at the beginning of the match.
---
Can confirm I saw this yesterday
---
I thought the hatch never spawned above basement or on second floor of buildings
---
PC. I occasionally get this weird thing where my clicks do not register, M1 and M2 on my mouse. I don't seem to have a problem in any other game so I know my mouse is still good. Does anyone know what this might be caused by?
---
I don't have to anything or appreciate 'advice' that I know would damn right get me killed. You sure like to project extreme assumptions for someone that's not heated. Also I'd like to give you some more of your own medicine by adding things like smiley faces and saying you're not heated out of no where is usually put when people are actually raging inside to desperately convince the other person they're not.
---
I usually expect it but sometimes it's just nothing I can do about it, even tho I have DS. But also I kinda don't like the idea of having an obligatory perk to wear
---
It’s only available in certain countries right now I think
---
If I know all the survivors are already at the gate waiting I'll just go look for pallets I didn't break yet or the hatch, I'm fine with them staying around to try to bm it just means I get a few more points because of it
---
When you're nurse on the underground complex and can't keep a chase for 2 seconds, are literally teleporting into areas where you're just floating in the air &amp; teleporting out of bounds, the game completely loses its fun and a DC is completely justified.
---
If they ban someone for DCing when a map is fundamentally flawed and outrageously bugged, then they're going to be getting a lot of support tickets.
---
the reason why this occurred is because the killer was standing on the hatch, you can't interact with the hatch if another player is standing on it.
---
Well if/when you make one, I’ll be here to check it out!
---
one of my most proudest fap
---
if she's relatively new it's understandable. Seeing that behaviour from players with 300+ hours is pathetic tho
---
So basically, in that case it's kind of on you.  Either a killer wants to farm from the beginning, or they want to give "pity points", but a killer that's behind will always want to farm just so he can get kills. At least 99% of the time
---
Yup :(
---
Yeah because that won't be abused at allll.
---
Great xD haha
---
I'm haven't found a lobby either, idk what's wrong
---
I fell asleep waiting for a lobby, you know its bad when that happens
---
Look up differences in the skeletal structure between races. Alot of people can. Tell what race the person was just by looking at the skull.
---
I feel like this pic is me when I'm playing killer and played a bad game and am omw to the open exit all 4 are about to run out. Donning my hazmat suit "I'm ready for my flashlight clicks and teabags Mr. DeVille!"
---
Ye kinda dumb but “you can’t use items in the dying state”. I rather see an exception made to the key.
---
Same
---
I’m using puddings cause... you know... 
---
I CANT FIND A FCKING BPS ON FREDDY.
---
Forgot Jane. Demogorgan thicc asf
---
Idk why I got downvoted
---
ruin is garbage
---
Dude forward your ports what year is this
---
The Entity could kill him anytime it wants.
---
I can hear it in my wet dreams ; )

Elaborate.

Best map in the game :)

On the Surge topic, another PSA for survivors:
---
If you don't let go off the generator when it explodes, you'll be able to continue progressing it even with the sparks going out but the killer won't be able to damage it when you finally let go. You can do this to prevent Surge into PGTW. 
---
This is definitely a bug but still.
---
PC Insane long queue search to play killer, I bought ghostface and I couldn't use it. Because the game doesn't give me a lobby to begin with....
---
Just imagine 5 gateaus in a single match while using BBQ and there's also bloodhunt going on
---
That's literally 715% more Bloodpoints
---
I’m waiting like 8 minutes to find a Killer game
---
Franklin's Demise is pretty good and fun.
---
The DC at the end really makes it.
---
Oh lol
---
Just played as killer and had a team that was excellent, I should have messaged them. Very organized and had each other's backs. I hooked several of them multiple times, but they maintained well and ended up all escaping!!
---
Surge and Surveillance combo is very strong
---
Like at then end of the day you have to give it to the survivors but its annoying
---
WikiHow to be a moron.
---
He could've ran out when you came too but didn't. 120% deserved.
---
Not on 2nd floors but def above basement
---
I'm even having trouble getting in a game as a survivor. Ps4
---
Honestly. At that point I would of tried to find the killer to convince him to farm
---
Rule #2069: Under no circumstances may The Legion use any add-ons. No exceptions.
---
Ugh, this event has been the worst experience for me so far. I've been trying to play with fairly new friends (rank 8-16), and in two hours I just got 90.000 BP. I am rank 2, so since they fixed the whole facing baby killers, I just can't play with my friends without dragging them into red rank killers :(
---
Ebony moris, slugging billy, infinite tier 3 tombstone myers with play with your food... I haven't escaped a single match, let alone reaching 10k bps. Also, killers dodging lobbies or with 300+ ping. This is the complete opposite of fun, and it's been so freaking long since I've been so salty. :s
---
You know damn well u started it stfu
---
Legion and Doctor, I also max deviousness with Hag and Freddy a lot. Leatherface with Distressing and/or Speed Limiter can max deviousness in a few chainsaws.
---
I feel Demo might also be good for BP.
---
It’s Satan claiming both of your souls
---
These nightmarish creatures can be felled! They can be beaten! (how do I do italics? )
---
Spent 3 hours on the game last night. Out of those 3 hours, I only got into 2 matches. Was playing as Killer.
---
When you get -1 kills
---
I would,  David here being a snitch, hook him and let steve get hatch or a gate
---
It’s garbage
---
Well most people rate the perks number 1 balance landing 2 dead hard 3 lithe my personal favorite is dead hard but I recommend trying all out to see which you like
---
Same on Xbox. At LEAST a minimum 20 minute wait, just to connect to someone.
---
Pretty good job so far!!!
---
Fool, there is no death in the entity's realm
---
And then next bloodweb you get two awesome perks like Adrenaline and Dead Hard but you can't get them both.
---
So really steve got lucky and not nancy.
---
I'm a Survivor main as well, but I'm gonna hard disagree with you here bud. I play more then my fair share of killer, and the way it works now is well balanced. If the Survivor is lucky/prepared, they escape. If they found hatch first, found a key during the game, or brought a key, and they escape, then good on you bud. And, for your argument on 'the person who did nothing gets hatch' that's true! Sometimes the person who did nothing will get hatch and live! But you know what they won't get in high ranks? A pip. Or, sometimes, even a safety pip. AKA: if that's the only way you play, unless you're in low/mid ranks, you're going to be falling hard.
---
Killers don't need to get a 4k every game. It's not fair on them or survivors to believe that should always be the case. And Survivors shouldn't be punished for that. (Plus, I mean, what killer wants to stand there for two minutes looking at doors?)
---
Should've yoinked the flashlight
---
They promised optimizations months ago and couldn't keep it so it more than likely isnt happening
---
Yeah I’ve been getting DC’d a lot these past few days.
---
It’s the first ten seconds. Literally in the opening of the map before you get to move around at all. This Halle s when a person fails to connect, not “oh I found out who the killer is and I don’t like it so I’m gonna DC. When you get a match cancel it’s not something people intend to have happen.
---
Don't just stare at it, EAT IT!
---
PC. Every time I load up at new match my mouse sensitivity changes. VERY frustrating.
---
These are the survivors that end up calling you a camper and tunneler
---
It’s not playing favorites, it’s just chance. I prestiged my Steve and never got self care once
---
Happening to me right now. Have to reset the game every couple of trials
---
Wha-
---
3 years later game breaking bugs still haven't been fixed, did I mention 3 years
---
Think I will go for STBFL
---
Ez gg
---
I love the feeling as a survivor when you find it maybe not so much when the killer is attached to it though lol
---
is the brightness and contrast turned way up or what? this game was darker than i remember
---
I agree that he shouldn't start with all his traps, but he does need some boost so that he's not punished so much for having to go after his traps and waste so much time in the early game.
---
One option someone mentioned is that if a trap remains unset for a long amount of time, it will disappear and appear in the Trapper's inventory, with a fairly long cooldown. Long enough of a thing that he does still have to collect most of his traps, but for traps that you never grabbed which are miles away from the remaining late game gens it would really help out
---
GG EZZZZZZ
---
Necessary if you are playing Bubba I'd say.  
---
Anything between green ranks or above is hell.
---
Believe me when I say that it's worth buying leather face for just his perk.
---
This.
---
Self care is such a time wasting perk.
---
Oh thanks god, I was starting to think that my internet is trash
---
Surprisingly they were friendly afterwards, just "gg"s but better than rage.
---
wait times are incredibly high for killer due to double bloodpoint making people queue as killer for max bp gain
---
I'm using an Nvidia freestyle filter which makes the game brighter
---
I would frick that
---
Oh thanks I didn't realize
---
You're literally asking for Myers mains to downvote you. Take away a killers ability to be awful the whole time and get free kills? You must be crazy. Free upvote to counter the massive shitstorm that's coming your way.
---
I don’t mind facing against good survivors, it’s provides a fun challenge, but why can’t my teammates be half as good as them
---
Haunted Grounds though
---
I've always wanted to run a full scavenger build
---
Not justifying his messages but it seems you wanted him to join the party - which we all know is equally shady.
---
Right!! Some scary shit
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Lol I was in purple with about 300 hours (a bit more)
---
I love the concept but feel it needs more fleshing out. Someone with more experience may be able to help you finish this idea and, once finished, word it so it’s easy to understand but still matches the DBD style.
---
I would never stop playing Brenda lol please behavior
---
Thicc
---
Idk maybe it has to do with patch or something? My friend keeps crashing now.
---
How's the game sided towards the killer? It's a 4v1.
---
I never understood the point of hanging around in the gates. I might heal my teammates for points but that's about it. Besides going for saves, once the gates are open I'm outtie, especially if the killer is *right there*
---
At least wait for the other 4 other people who are farming. If I see someone who isn't on board and trying to speed gens I just kill them.
---
why dont you just bring a brown or yellow medkit if you are going to bring botany? Then you can drop selfcare for something useful
---
I CAN'T FUCKING BREATHE
---
Ive DC'd probably 20 out of the 50 games i played this event.  Its the game kicking me, not me leaving.  Servers busted.
---
This just makes the game take longer bc once you pick yourself up either you or your teammate goes down and the killer slugs again
---
Ghost face is a stealthy killer who can sneak around and make use of his power to mindgame. Myers is a fucking train trying to plow straight through your whole team once he activated his ability. I’d say both are around the same place on the tier list, they have similar kits but require different play styles
---
i said the hatch mechanic is side towards the killer not the game as a whole 
---
and i explained why so you have to be trying to miss the point of what i said
---
lol oh no, he stole your fucking meme!!! And...deleted your watermark? THE HORROR!
---
imagine caring this much about a dumb picture
---
Now you need to realize the difference here, you’re saying it’s BS when a killer has poor connection, and it is. But when the survivor is the one with poor connection then it’s their fault I’m not saying when a survivors ping is red it’s their fault. I’m saying when they are the only one lagging it’s their fault. Sure distance might be a factor but are you going to blame either sides because they live somewhere else?
---
It’s not cool when you steal memes and remove water marks credit goes to jake_farts on instagram !
---
At least be courteous and don't speed through it as fast as you can.
---
The servers arent out yet tho
---
7+ minute queues :(
---
Cause it's just a build that I like. All of Claudette's perks plus Spinechill
---
Because they want a really easy win, they want it to be as easy as possible, they are scared to lose. They well know how killers have no chances when they bring items and franklin's demise is a joke of a perk.
---
Pretty nice way of describing it. Similar but different enough for different perks to work better and worse on them.
---
Doesnt matter, the game itself is unstable as all hell right now.  Theres a reason there have been multiple front page DC posts every day since patch.
---
I feel that, but I’d rather they fix the broken lobbies instead of re-balancing certain killer add-ons because low rank players have a hard time not feeding the killer
---
Hey how you doin lil mama? lemme whisper in your ear
---
Tell you sunthing that you might like to hear
---
In 1k hours, i've met a tombstone myers once. Cmon now
---
Yeah broken lobbies are extremely stupid
---
Yeah I get a rare match as survivor and just nothing as killer. My survivor matches end quick though because its always a prayer bead spirit as well
---
They need to bring out a patch and fix some bugs, such as lobby errors or your skin turning black at the ending screen. Just so many small things that are buged.
---
This isn't KYF. I have WGLF2 in this clip and in KYF the perks are always level 3.
---
The only username I didn't censor was mine in case you guys were wondering.
---
Inner strength gives you healing points.
---
Thanks!! I suck at writing so that'd be awesome. :D
---
i think it’s not very courteous to expect me to waste my time in a game i’m not enjoying because you wanna break the rules.... farming is reportable, not that i would ever report someone for it. i just want to leave
---
I hate it because 90% of the time they ragequit when they get juked at a jungle gym and I don't get the BBQ stack.
---
And de pip
---
I ALWAYS seem to DC at the 4 minute mark on the dot when I do, like the game is checking for authenticity or somthing and I fail the check.
---
Probably connection issues
---
gg ez
---
Dbd mobile isnt officially released yet
---
Yeah...
---
Alright, you win.
---
A. That is either a lie, or you just don’t know how to count. B. You can’t use your own personal experience of gaming to state whether something is op or not because everyone has different experiences whilst playing. What if I played 1k hours and experienced him over 200 times? C. Even if you want to use your anecdotal argument as a valid one, how often do you see other shit that is really annoying to play against or something that’s op? Even in many games and hours
---
The pallets are unsafe, as long as you know how to play unsafe pallets, you won’t have any problems as killer
---
when discordance pops but dream projection is on cooldown
---
Had a clown bring an eboni Mori so we immersed hard and managed to not go down once, opened the doors and we all left. We all had streamers and the killer was very salty after the game.
---
Finally some love fpr Julie.
---
IK I was playing with my rank 4 sis when I'm rank 14 ATM and it gave us Garbo teamates
---
I think what he means is killers ALTF4ing when a Strode Key gets burnt or Survivors process killing when a Puzzle Piece is burned
---
Report him to Xbox if his IP address does it enough it will get him an IP ban, or even console ban.
---
This is incredible, big props to you for running them around for so long omg
---
I had this happen to me years ago (so of course yours could be a different version of the issue) but for me it was my graphics card. Which seems weird, but the game was basically unplayable for me at the time without disconnecting about every third or so game and after reinstalling the game, updating drivers, etc. It ultimately was only fixed once I swapped my graphics card out with a spare my friend had. My previous card was a Nvidia GeForce GTX 670. At the time I couldn't find anyone else having this issue online after searching, but I've never had the problem since. For some reason though I feel like I've seen a post on this subreddit in the last year that mentioned something about Nvidia issues. 
---
But yeah, could be completely different from my issue since mine was from probably closer to 3 years ago, but if you're as desperate as I was it's some food for thought. I hope you find a fix!
---
You should consider yourself lucky, run Inner Strength or a perk that lets you see survivor auras like Bond or Empathy, they’re all much better alternatives to Self-Care
---
What's wrong with a nurse using NOED?
---
You're*
---
Whats so peculiar about this? M1 only killers all make good use of it
---
Oh no no no no no
---
Where do I report him on Xbox or online?
---
It's the one thing that really annoys the hell outta me. I've only been playing for a couple of months now, so I'm not a vet at the game, and most times, I don't do great as the Killer, but it really hits the wrong spot when survivors feel the need to be absolute pricks about winning. I'm happy for them that they won but there's a line between gracefully winning and just being a dick about it all. As a survivor, the only time I'll ever hover in a exit gate is if theres one or two survivors still out there and might need help. I guess thats more down to my personality that I can't just leave someone behind knowing there was a chance they could have been saved. But, that being said, if the other player is intentionally taunting the killer, all bets are off and I'm gone.
---
I had two in one bloodweb. Well, +2 red addons on level 4 wraith
---
I want this as a cosmetic.
---
Yep, that’s simply the reason why. Same thing is happening on PS4. I really wanted to grind all weekend with Michael Myers but pretty much gave up and committed to my survivor BP build.
---
Gg wp
---
Probably the most disturbing image I've ever seen.
---
There has been a bug where Dying Light has caused crashes as it gained tokens, but BVHR has been working on it.
---
I like it only because I don't have to worry about med kits or it getting knocked out of my hands o I can heal whenever without limits
---
Myers is really easy to see compared to Ghostface. 
---
Ghostface doesn't need perks to reduce his terror radius. 
---
Ghostface gets a notification if you reveal his power, showing your position.
---
Ghostface stalks you way faster compared to Myers and can straight up oneshot you.
---
Ghostface has the option to not stalk and stay at 0 terror radius until he hits you
---
Ghostface doesn't have his movement speed reduced, ever. So his early game is way better
---
The gens on it suck though
---
“Quite possibly”? What the hell are the other contenders?
---
Yea, it is reportable, everything is, but it isn't bannable. Just don't get mad when the farming killer kills you because you bum rushed the gens
---
Not really but when you see those offerings and do that, it’s kind of a dick move to be honest
---
On pc It takes 15 minutes to find a game. I'm a level 16 killer
---
Useless. You may as well bring a medkit.
---
noed with nurse can be handy sometimes. imagine infectious fright and noed...thats a nasty combo...
---
The perks I listed are all still better alternatives, self care is a big time waster and it’s usually recommended to run something else in its place
---
Oh my god the story of my life
---
is the battered steve a costume? or is that just part of the scoops ahoy outfit?
---
over 200 times lmao, ok
---
Looool imagine getting affected by people spam crouching😂😂😂😘lil bitches
---
That arch. Oooooweeee
---
I mean, I wasn't disagreeing with you, was just trying to mitigate the storm. I personally think add ons like that need to be changed. Not sure why I'm a clown, but good luck in the fog none the less.
---
Are you slow you clown? I said what if. A hypothetical. You simp. Learn to read before you type back you filthy degenerate
---
That kind of teabag is the 'Yeah, I survived, haha, you dumb killer' after getting dumpstered. Watching this kind of person die makes me happy
---
When the killer cheats and still loses
---
r/pathofexile is leaking
---
Did you depip?
---
Salty survivor at its finest. What is wrong with people in this game. Killers get this salty too but still.
---
Don’t forget he’s slow AF once he actually gets tier 3, and by the time it usually goes off most/all gens are done. I did a Tombstone-Hair build and the only reason I was able to get all 4 was because they wanted to try loops and BM. Fun game though.
---
If that’s what you want to go with, I’m gonna be optimistic about the optimization coming in a few months.
---
Same reason a ton of killers are using UR add-ons and offerings. They have a surplus of items, or they're planning on prestiging, or they want a good game. Or all of the above.
---
I have arguments, you have insults. That's the end of the conversation for me :)
---
It’s been said that there simply aren’t enough players for there to be 2 playlists, it’s would make the wait times so considerably worse, it’s really not worth it just to appease the casual audience
---
r/megaten
---
Looks like the embodiment of :(
---
It could be worse, it took me to level 43 to get rank 1 of bbq on my huntress and then on Michael I got it at level 10-12...
---
PS4. I’ve been experiencing a load of frame drops and lag playing as demogorgon, issue only started today
---
Generally knowing exactly where your team is and what they are doing is far from useless when you can't communicate with them.
---
It's really bad right now. I have a ton of anniversary cakes left on my killers so I figured with the bloodhunt it was finally the time to use them, but after being in que for 20+ minutes I realized that for once it was going to be faster to gain bloodpoints on survivor. Makes me sad because I'd been saving those cakes in hopes that a BP event would encourage a bunch of other people to use offerings as well so the gains would be amazing but I guess that was a silly dream.
---
This is the power of requiem.
---
Gg ez baby killer
---
He'll need to use at least 3 after this
---
Surprising enough the devs would call it exploiting. They have banned people before for something as dumb as this. Stop fucking hating fucking cunts.
---
Share it if it is
---
Go through and select each vulgar message and report it. With that many no doubt they will be experiencing a long term ban or ip/console ban. Then report the profile with a short description of what happened. That is probably the most toxic thing I have seen on Xbox lol. Poor guy probably had a stroke dealing with that much salt.
---
Perhaps they just wanna play and not farm

leatherface mains camp anyway
---
thank you sir
---
Tombstone **Piece** is actually very weak because of how easy it is to counter once you know he has it (unfortunately not for the first soul getting killed). The amount of EW he can get out of all survivors is extremely limited. If you play in the most optimal way possible, you can kill 3 survivors but usually you only get 2 before being unable to tier up to level 3 again. As a survivor, all you have to do is jumper in a locker, he won't be able to kill you and his EW ability will be gone for the rest of the match.
---
**Judith's** Tombstone is also balanced because you can't use it without Fragrant of Tuft Hair which makes getting to EW3 extremely long (you need to fully stalk 3 survivors if I am not mistaken). By the time you are finally able to kill someone, the match should be over. Unless survivors feed you but then its their mistake. 
---
These add-ons are fun to **use** and extremely easy to counter.
---
We have it better than them
---
Yep. Happening to me left and right. Support “we can’t restore items”. Well then introduce when auto dc’d - before match even starts - give back the item. -_- 
---
Lost at least three good things this week...
---
It's just the bloodhunt bonus don't worry
---
:( that's awful
---
now do it with Bubba
---
And you remember you're playing on the game and there are 10 pallets left
---
Nice little detail of the footsteps as Steve approaches the pallet.
---
Yeah, let me rephrase my self. I think they should rework it. Make it so that he can charge the evil within a bit faster and he gets blood points for it, but in order for it be used you gotta knock down someone first and then you can use it
---
A cat and mouse preventing you from playing a game of cat and mouse? Now thats meta
---
Trueeeee
---
Damn I can’t wait for my game to start. I’ve been waiting for days so I can end my game under 10 mins with my ebony mori .-.
---
Devs dont care about your cat :( sorry
---
this, take my upvote
---
personally im using all my ‘expensive’ items now because im prestiging my characters...but i doubt all do the same especially swf
---
Ghostface moves slower when crouches though
---
Mmmmmmmmmmmmk dude, imma just keep crying over here thanks for the dislike for my differing opinion
---
What time of day? At night I get matches instantly but in the day time I get them after 10 mi utes. It's the opposite for survivor as well where the day its instant and the night its forever.
---
Ghostface doesn't have to crouch, he is not tall
---
Xbox is really strict about this stuff. You could probably get him a long ban if you report
---
Yea but I like as it's gotten me out of jams and since I'm more of a lone wolf trying to survive it helps
---
Doesn’t change the fact you’re still wrong
---
&gt;What I would do is make so you can charge tier 3 faster but you gotta knock them first and then if they been knocked you can use it. You also get blood points for it.
---
Perhaps you should play Myers with Tombstone to understand this add-on better?
---
This change would make tombstone completely broken. Currently all you have to do is prevent Myers from getting too close to you and just press M1. If he lunges by accident, you won't be tombstoned. Now, if he can simply down you and then tombstone, all the existing counters would be gone and there would be absolutely nothing you could do.
---
See I've submitted a ticket and posted about it on the forums so I'm trying my hardest to get a response from a Dev for everyone on switch.
---
I think of it more like Zelda.  
---
Dun dun dun DUUUUUUUN!
---
They're preventing you from encountering toxicity
---
Man but you got dead hard AND balanced landing immediately tho
---
Dude it's September 28 now. Are you living in the past?
---
i wouldn’t get mad at the Killer for Killing me :)
---
&gt;Yeah, let me rephrase my self. I think they should rework it. Make it so that he can charge the evil within a bit faster and he gets blood points for it, but in order for it be used you gotta knock down someone first and then you can use it
---
If you can Tombstone slugged survivors, the few counters available against these add-ons would be gone. Perhaps you need to get a better understand of how these add-ons work before suggesting anything.
---
I have played Myers and this wouldn’t make it broken. This would make it so that if you the survivor are better than the Myers you will beat it. If you can loop and avoid for long enough for gens to get done then you will most likely win unless when he knocks you he camps you or you mess up. It will entirely become skill based for both the Michael and survivor to play.
---
He is slower when crouching ok, but if he doesn't crouch, he is not slow. And you are not forced to crouch while  Myers has tier 1 by default and you can't change that
---
&gt; Intentional dc's make sound, unintentional dont make a sound at all.
---
That's not entirely true. I've heard the DC sound on multiple occasions in 3.2.x with my friend and he has heard it from me too when neither of us had done anything to DC.
---
Nurse is hard as hell to play on console, I can’t blame this person for using NOED.
---
Trust me, especially in higher rank games, the time you save by getting heard instead of self caring is very valuable

I can't even get into a game as survivor... Came back after 4 months to find the game wait times are still shit lol. Should have expected as much.
---
I usually only hang around the gates at the end if the killer had a real bad game, I try to give him one or two free hits for some points. If the killer did well and the other survivors are dead/out, I fly out of there. Why stick around? Just to show somebody up?
---
Get deliverance. We all had to endure it while climbing. Be safe in the fog.
---
Getting Myers out of Tier 1 is super easy
---
Sorry bro just please don’t hit me.

They are certainly not welcome here on this subreddit.

Just why

---
I get the saltiest killers in existence that only play the double BP event to ruin it for survivors
---
Or “lit or not, it’s atleast 1000 points”
---
Even so, if the match fails to find, the only thing wasted is people’s time. If you get your offering back, the harm is baby survivors and baby killers wasting each others time because of a map offering. While it is annoying to go against, yes, the devs can track that sort of thing once we have working dedicated servers and it will fall in line with more punishment rules when people get reported.
---
Do you happen to have any pics of those perks being on bloodwebs? I haven’t seen other and some people have got ALL base perks and just have no perks on their web. So they’re not showing up for most people. Not trying to be a butt head just want to see if it’s a bug for some players or if they’re just not there period for some reason.

I also don’t understand when people get that upset about it. It’s like they don’t have an actual life and think that trying to make you feel bad about your game play makes them feel better about themselves. Smh
---
There are plenty of ways to enjoy this game which don't ruin it for everyone else involved.
---
So fucking close...
---
If you report "stolen memes" please provide evidence thanks :)
---
It's a waste of time dude, too many survivors only players(aka mains) that will defend this system because they get to win easy. They know the game is really easy on their side and they want to keep it that way
---
They need to get rid of that new door.
---
At least you can kinda counter-rotate it...
---
I have a p3 laurie. I was hoping the blood would make her look better; it didn’t
---
Nea is the most toxic character in the game, they should just make her a killer already
---
* Screenshots highlighting multiple iridescent emblems (use our weekly smile sunday threads).

TBH I much rather using green and purple add ons and have every survivor run items it’s 10 times better then going against a SWF with 4 commidus toolboxs or insta saw billy and iridescent huntress.
---
I'm about to face camp your ass.
---
PC: Endgame collapse timer freezes and you're also frozen in place. It has happen twice to me now. Will post video in a bit.
---
Yeah the patch itself seems to be pretty messed up
---
It's funny how some killer's cling onto NOED like the game is unplayable without, if that's true.. get good   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Well, the issue with rewarding killers for killer 3-4 players..is that the game isn't made for the killer to kill players to quicky. The game is designed for killers to gain rank points, that the killer need to chase a total of ten times (Win), Hook survivers 8 times, find survivers 15 times, and so on..So if you start add perks where "Killing" a suriver is a reward, is goes against the base game design...reason devour hope, is honestly a wonderful perk in my mind, requires you to nearly complete a part you have to to get max "sarcifie" points and so on.  
---
So i see were you are going with this, but to me, this will make Noed, be a bad perk from a "fun" point of view, more so then it is now.   
---
Noed as it is now, does two things. Make surivers do bones, even if they are "empty", this will reward the survivers, with both rank points, and blood point(Survivers like that), and something to do when there isn't an open gen, or you have to wait for exhausted, or the like. And it makes it so the survivers, have to be more careful at the end of game, avoid the killer entirely, instead of baiting or lureing the killer, or trying big risk rescures, and for a killer, as it is designed right now, it helps killers who have a rough earlygame( due to the killers skill, or maybe even the survivers skill level, map or many other factors, that can do this), and still help the killer get both some blood points, and some rank points, without being a dominant factor is large parts of the game.   
---
I understand Noed can be annoying to go against, but it is by no means overpowered, it just a tiny bit annoyed..and its not even that good a perk, nor does it effect 80-90% of the match. If you view streamers, they often avoid it - because it isn't a good perk... So i don't think the focus of any game designer, or any player should be on Noed, more ways to fix spirit, nurse, and other killers who have issues, maybe even look at perks that you see 99% of players run, like dead hard, balanced landing, etc etc, so we get more varied perks, and thus more neurance gameplay.
---
There is lot of thing i didn't understand in this video.  
---
1. How the hell you used a Red Key and ended up with a Red Map?!  
---
2. Why did the hatch open?!
---
3.That escape was pure luck!
---
Poor Killer :(
---
Another point, making perks that reward on player deaths (Like, killing 3 survivers) allso rewards camping.
---
Yeah I know, was just making a joke.
---
uhhhh wow she’s hot
---
I think this would be more fitting if it was tagged as Shitpost/Meme
---
How bout down the person on the gen? It’s a fair mechanic to me and I’m a killer main
---
"Stop complaining about the game, I'm having fun so there's no issue. There's no reason to complain." - Some person.
---
Bruh the guy above me compared ghost face to nurse, billy, spirit, and Freddy, only 1 of which is a stealth killer. And you absolutely can compare stealth killers to nonstealth killers.
---
If someone says that Billy is better then pig, would you argue and go “Actually their play styles are too different to compare,” no you wouldn’t because you would sound like a jackass, which you do.
---
3 seconds or until first skill check.  Whichever comes first.
---
Honestly I don’t find gen tappng an issue, but if they were to change it, I believe this way would be better.
---
I sit in red ranks most seasons and I wish there was a casual mode as well. I play a lot so usually only a day or two after reset, I’m back to long waits, the same players, and lots of sweat. 
---
It’s especially apparent now with Bloodhunt. I’ve been using BPS and Gateaus all day for the group and all I get in return is red Mori killers and a team of escape cake survivors that want nothing more than unhooks. This is probably the first Bloodhunt that I am regretting even sharing offerings. That’s saying something. That combined with the sloppy matchmaking and queue issues is making this the worst Hunt for me so far. ):
---
wow looks like were not even going to get original killer this year :/
---
I’ve been using my ultra rare offerings because I’m building up the blood bank to prestige. Might as well use em before I lose em.
---
If you know it keeps happening working a short period of time start looking around there is probably some cheeky fucker doing it you can catch. Look at it as an opportunity to catch someone who is occupied not actually DOING the gen.
---
shitpost?
---
Lol come on man this is bullshit and you know it.  Just don't be downed a single time isn't an intelligent response or counter.  There's a reason devs added 3 hook states.  They didn't intend trashcans to stand there and do staring contests all game.
---
As a person that has used both, there is some merit to stacking them.
---
To I had this happening to me on console haven't experience this on PC Yet
---
Double blood debt!
---
you forgot the shitpost, hun
---
Yes 😂
---
The killer would probably think you are taunting him by hanging around at the gate.
---
Doing it like the Demogorgon portals and have a restricted area in front of it where you can't place a Trapper trap. But you should be able to put a Hag trap imo
---
i wanna gen tap her if you know what i'm saying 😳😳
---
Farming is and has always been a lame way to play the game, and I will absolutely try to end the game early so I don't waste my time and don't give you what you were out for.
---
Yeah, now give me my downvote.
---
Because having instadown attached to no terror radius without needing to stalk is better.
---
Use  overcharge
---
Ah I guess that does make sense
---
Shocking fashion sense

How to add shit post flair to someone else's post. Wait this isn't google

Looks like something Freddy would do in Nightmare movies
---
Revoking his killer card.
---
Monitor on prayer beads spirit is a thing.
---
Did u check endgame survivor perks? One had tenacity
---
Nope, would ne bullshit. Think about it before you troll
---
If you are facing a bad killer always use it as an opportunity to practice 360. True it doesn't really work at high ranks but if u know how to do it right and the killer isn't expecting it, it may work
---
Source: been to red ranks before as survivor
---
During the reveal screen, secret offerings just shouldn’t pop up at all imo.
---
XD hell yeah
---
I dont know man. Must be that pesky dyslexia of mine
---
This is the kind of content I love to see, instead of survivors bullying killers and facecamps
---
That would make sense normally, but three matches in a row they all disconnected simultaneously as if a system kicked them out.
---
None of them were fun for me or anyone I met without the opposing team/player suffering in their stead.
---
Woah woah woah hold back the insults it was only a question. It would have just made games last longer and give survivors something else to do and get some points. Just to clarify I didn't play during those events so I don't know what it was like
---
I mean... 25% is close to 1/3
---
what music is it?
---
*plank plank plank plank*
---
Oh ok sounds like a plan
---
Just fucking get rid of leatherface mains. Almost everyone I encountered during this 2x bp event they always face camp lol
---
Lmao saying “fuck you” cos he used dead hard when someone has DC’d and you’re chasing him with borrowed time so he’s clearly just been unhooked.. Nice, dead hard OP right?
---
Beautiful😂
---
Just run good perks. Inner strength is just another self-care in the end. Lol
---
This is my headcanon about why the licensed killers are in DBD
---
Ghost face was chilling, somehow contacted the entity, and is quite happy doing what the entity wants 
---
Myers don’t need no Entity, and does whatever the hell he wants
---
Bubba was abducted and offered free chili and treated kindly by the entity, as his family was abusing. 
---
Pig was driven by her fanatical devotion to jigsaw and the entity just gave her traps and let her go to work.
---
Freddy was abducted and nerfed by the entity, and after complaining a bunch, got a buff. 
---
The entity sent a survivor to the Upside Down to see what would happen, saw a demogorgon, used the survivor as bait, and got a good boi Demi. 
---
What do you think
---
Please indicate your post is shit for all to see your full glory
---
someone is bias and love Michael more
---
Lame post.  I hate NOED but that's a green rank killer man.  Everyones still a noob in greens they're still learning the game.  Same reason they often still camp and tunnel up there.  I expect them all regardless of killer to have NOED at green and yellow.  The perk was made for them.  No need to shame any entry level killer for running NOED regardless of their selection.
---
Best addon combo is Pincecone + Ataxic Respiration. But for practicing her, use no addons for muscle memory
---
have at least one survivor, have a killer, have spectator(s) and as soon as the survivor and killer ready up the spectator(s) click switch role to killer
---
My brain has melted  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
You probably weren't on his screen. 60 FOV is a bitch. But he was definitely deaf if he didn't hear you.
---
Gen regression isn't supposed to give you a free gen back. 
---
If you regress the gen while knowing someone is in the area that on you.
---
Killer main. I’m fine with it as is.
---
I don't farm so you can bing all you want ima just rush gens and go on to an actual match.
---
I did that exact same thing before. I’m red rank but I’m also really stupid
---
Ghost faces ability stalk, literally built in noed.
---
Fair. I give a nice GG message as well, even if I'm sacrificed. Makes me feel good
---
No, but at least you can get to the next game quicker.
---
The endgame timer gets stuck at the start so you don't know how much time is left
---
hold up, you got ur first 4k at rank 13?
---
I played survivor for like 2+ hours last night, got to play 3 games, and two of them had shit ping. That's a Friday night, East coast US. I can't even bring myself to play the game right now because of how dogshit matchmaking is. I'm actually make less on double bloodpoints, because the queue times are longer than the games. When you do get into a lobby the killer often has 200+ ping.  
---
They just launched a popular new chapter, and there is a double bloodpoint event on a weekend. You can't tell me there aren't enough people on to have short queue times.
---
I thought it was good too xd
---
Sprint burst 
---
Adrenaline 
---
Unbreakable 
---
Self care + green midkit
---
Meg left at 5 gens but her teammates died
---
That's never used as a question. Let's be real here. It's always an accusational statement meant to demean someone and is always done out of pure ignorance.
---
Anyways. It promotes selfish gameplay and farming. No one liked this shit. Especially since it was one sided. The killers only objective has been to hook people on event hooks while survivors had to fight each other over secondary objectives. This moonlight event was even worse. The killer still got their points by playing regularly. Meanwhile survivors couldn't just complete the secondary objective since the killer could smash the lantern and remove it from the game permanently and you lost it when you got hooked which gave the killer the opportunity to destroy it or for someone either random or your own friend to take the lantern. Sure you can sabo an event hook but it respawns and is still usable. The same can't be said for the lanterns in this event. It wasn't so bad of an event at the very beginning because if at least 1 person escaped with the lantern everyone got the points for it. Apparently that was a bug because they hotfixed it middle of the event to where if you didnt escape with it you didn't get shit.
---
Everything about this screams no.
---
No problem I'll keep ya updated! See you in the fog!!!
---
That's it, you get you mori.

Thats Legion's power. When he or she hits someone, everyone else gets followed by glowing pentagrams (I think thats what they are, correct me if im wrong.) So all they have to do is go where the pentagrams are, and bam. They found you.

New player here, I got an anticheat error called 000001 of sorts... it happened after i crashed in the map loading screen as a killler and i ended the .exe changing windows user because taskmanager didnt work (after a ridiculus 15 min waiting time, is impossible to play killer in this game)
---
It boggles my mind that you don't realize what you're proposing is actually a massive buff to Tombstone.  You are removing all counterplay we have against being Tombstoned while making it insanely easier for him to execute them.  This is basically a mori on steroids.
---
My head says Adam, but my heart says Jeff
---
The WABAJACK
---
Yup
---
I think a survivor is reviving next to exit gate with unbreakable which causes a push forward through it. No friends to test with
---
Hmm, I would like something like this.. but.. seems like the more good things we get, we get.. the triple of annoying bugs.. So.. I vote for NO
---
Just take the damn thing
---
I always figured that a dc was the equivalent to the survivor dying of a heart attack.

Jojo to be continued theme
---
I can test it with you and I be your friend
---
Someone put *boing* sound effects
---
Wow i didnt know it was so low
---
No, I don’t mind if people escape, my problem comes from the fact gens take 3 mins for them too be complete, even as nurse you can only chase one survivor at a time, thus leaving the other three to do gens. I don’t care if I get a 4K I just want some balance.
---
Certainly has
---
Killer instinct, as long as you can keep getting hits off it'll you can find everyone. It's literally what makes them viable with their powers lol
---
I think it's fine, if it annoys you so much, you could play Doc with overcharge

Im out for the evening but thanks :)

I unlocked all the teachable that I wanted : Balanced landing, Adrenaline, Sprint burst and Bond.
---
Is Claudette the stealthiest survivors ? So I can level up her to unlock them.
---
She blends with the environment and she is small.
---
Meg already have everything I just need to get the lvl 3 of the perks.
---
Because not everyone cares about BP
---
I mean, some people don't care about "property" but that doesn't mean stealing candy from a kid isn't a dick move.
---
Not only killer, survivor too, i only got 2 matches in an hour and it keeps getting worse. This is really sad, since we have bloodhunt and we can't play properly.
---
You're welcome :)
---
That map has the worst pallets in the game.  They're all terribly unsafe.  There are only a handful of legit pallets on the map.  The rest you ignore and take your free mindgame hit.
---
It's almost as if it was put there to tell you to leave so really you should be gone already
---
nice
---
DAMN he is STUPID THICC!
---
Ok the Nurse was camping the exit and I was looking for totems on my way to the other one. 🤷‍♂️
---
To be continued
---
Guess we will never kno
---
It’s so bad on switch. I’m a new player that’s been watching on twitch for months. Everyone camps and tunnels.
---
There is also a certain stigma against leatherface players because 9/10 times they are played by people that respect pallets and camp hooks. Obviously it is not just leatherface players, but it feels like it is mostly leatherface players.
---
It's almost as if the bar drastically jumps all over the screen right in front of your eyes
---
Man I hate tryhards. Oh im sorry I meant trihards
---
Bbq and chili is not especially good on myers, but all around you should have it on all your killers. Those bloodpoints are just too important.
---
Ruin/infectious fright/ monitor and abuse and bamboozle should be a great build for myers
---
But the killer wasn’t even running NOED.
---
Sadly
---
It's almost like you should have just ran instead of getting points cause the point is to survive
---
Yeah it is. Please use it not like that. If you get unhooked after being hooked under 1 minute, you can get hooked 3 times. If you fail to unhook yourself, you can only get hooked 2 times. And if you try to unhook and fail, and someone comes 1 minute and 1 second after your hook, you are already dead.
---
So please don't try unhook yourself (there is a special perk that gives you 100% chance, under the condition that you unhook someone before you were hooked..  it's okay but not meta)
---
Decent killer IMO. Could use a buff tho just like Legion.
---
sex number
---
No, it would do work like a mori. You gotta hook them first and everything like a Mori. If the add on worked like that it would require a skill matchup for the survivor and the killer. Michael would have to be good and so would the survivor. You probably wouldn’t be able to comprehend a skill matchup.
---
What do you mean it almost as if, that did happen pff lol
---
Game is beyond broken, not even fun atm. Matchmaking is a horrendous mess, wait times are terribly long which is weird bc every other dc release I had 20 sec wait times this one is really bad and on top of it you may not even get into the lobby its so broken. Might just take a break from dbd until they fix this. For how much this game has grown, its also been neglected in other areas and it shows when its in the worst state I have ever seen it. I would be very happy if BHVR didnt release another chapter for 6 months instead of 3 and focus on ironing out bugs and increasing performance please. You cant juste keep releasing content and breaking the game more and more.
---
So let me get this straight. You set off a Hag trap and she should...what....just ignore it? Survivors really are a special breed of entitled lol
---
There is no kick option mid match or even in the lobby screen. You don't know someone is going to do it until they do it. Hosting matches has the same results as just joining one. You just have to leave. Sure you can kick them from chat but how you gonna remove them from the game without making everyone rejoin on you. So no, hosting isn't the solution either. They need to fix this shit. That's the solution. Lock the sidebar specifically for kyf when everyone is ready. Simple. 
---
The absolute only 1 time I actively participated in this 2 killer cancer is because I had a group of legit friends who I play this game with regularly had only ever seen pictures and video of it on the internet about it and thought the idea would be fun. I told them it wasn't going to be but just like everyone else who thinks 2 killer games would be fun in theory, had to see why it isn't fun in practice. We all had fun with it and got a kick out of it but eventually even they said it's bullshit that there are no usuable loops and it's an instant down for the survivors with 2 killers. It's busted and ruins the game.
---
somebody said this on leaksbydaylight aswell, so it might actually be real
---
🤣
---
The song is Roundabout by Yes, you goober
---
Why kill him though? The entity will reward killers by letting them mori so I imagine micheal still causes enough suffering to be extremely useful. Dudes pretty scary.
---
Exactly my point, rather than acknowledging that its bugged you're sitting here like "HURR DURR YOU SHOULD BE GONE ALREADY"
---
how about if the timer gets slower for survivors...she should get her black vomit (through fountains) every time a survivor gets to a broken status.
---
People do that all the time, I don't know why considering I'm 50 feet away from the pallet
---
You have all the tools you could need at your disposal to not get caught by the killer. Especially to not be the first one caught, which gives you an even bigger advantage because then you’ll likely know what killer you’re up against.
---
If you can’t do better thats on you.
---
Havent seen this one, sounds hilarious though
---
I think at this point I prefer the old party system then this. Ps4
---
I mean I've been dealing with more than average prayer beads spirits, tombstone Myers, insta saws, insta hatchets, so...yeah...I feel like they wasted it, usually my team agrees we try not to bring in more than 2 super good items
---
It looks like gears from the generators
---
X1. Search times as both survivor and killer seem to be ridiculously long the last few days.  Searched as a rank 13 killer for 20 minutes and gave up.  I always can find matches pretty quick, even at terrible hours.
---
Hey I see people are downvoting this post. It’s understandable to not believe me, I would be hesitant as well, but downvoting won’t do shit. If we get this post more recognition you guys will really be able to see that I’m telling the truth. It might seem like I’m scavenging for karma, but I could give 2 shits about it, I just want people to be informed. I promise you guys the SECOND I get evidence that the notification was a fluke or maybe I’m just crazy, I will delete this post. I’m not on reddit that often, so I don’t know if they have this power, but I want the mods of this sr to hold me accountable. If I don’t delete the post, then ban me. I don’t want to be known as a liar on this sr, especially because this is my favorite game. Thank you for reading if you made it this far.

Everytime ive ever heard some say they doubt something will happen in dead by daylight it seems to happen.

Can confirm ladt 3 nights its been about 2 games an hour. Matchmaking is super broken

Thanks

It almost as if he was using the available time to find the hatch/ door. Regardless that shit is bugged and not working as intended.

Sure you were
---
First off you said nothing of the sort about them requiring a hook.  You simply said knock down once as a requirement.  So practice accurately communicating your ideas when posting comments because you messed that up.
---
Also why the douchey dig at me in the end?  Bro I promise you that if you are on here whining about one of the easiest ultra rare addons in the game to counterplay I am miles better than you as survivor.  Like it wouldn't even be close man.
---
I’m all for this! Nancy a cutie
---
Maybe the cogs represent the never ending teamwork that is doing gens.  
---
or it's just a dumb icon. idk.
---
Running thana on that build, what a noob
---
Other games generally don't do this. They usually limit rank disparity in lobbies, or use some kind of weighted averaging system to ensure that matches are as fair as possible. Does it seem more fair to you for a team of ranks 15-15-15-3 to be matched against a rank 3 killer, or a rank 7 killer? Do you think that a 15-15-15-3 team is going to experience a fair match, in which they have a reasonable chance of success, playing against a rank 3 killer? Do you think that a rank 3 killer is the *best* match for that team?
---
It stops survivors from screaming so the more ear piercing ones aren't heard that's all
---
Ggezzzzzz
---
Yeah I wanted to rephrase what I said but I forget how to edit posts. But anyway you aren’t better than me at the game. I can garuntee you. You are some fuck boy who never peaked ranked 6. Go throw yourself into traffic, simp.
---
This is spoken like someone very baby and new to the game.  That's not how it works man.  You trashcamp a lot of survivors yourself because this sounds like the go to justification for someone that does?
---

How about you get two killer rituals and two survival rituals, and get one new one of each type every day?

That way, you're still incentivized to play both roles, but you stop getting streaks of Leatherface mori rituals.

I don't get your point? Stealing is general is a dick move, being a child is irrelevant.

Someone who doesn't care about BP is going to DC regardless of the event going on or not. Implying it's somehow worse because there is an event is stupid.

Currently there's about 2x players compared to before the release of ST DLC,there's something obviously broken.
---
Sorry, that's incorrect. Do you want a hint?
---
Buddy did you not read what I wrote at all. Why are you so butt hurt over what some salty losers think about you? It is camping but camping isn’t wrong.
---
Fuck it; I'm dropping out and remaining rank 20.
---
My favorite is when i ran killer 90% of the match, so much so I get jack shit for points because boldness caps at 8k.
---
Then after I leave/ die and spectate, I see the megs, claudette, and nea gen monkeys teabagging at the exit gate like they somehow outplayed the killer
---
Lol you are so pathetic it hurts man.  You're the infant survivor that posted about an addon that literally should never kill you.  You should always recognize it when they have it and again use the lockers noob!  Lol.  Easiest counterplay ever.
---
You are beyond petty and immature.  I've got over 3k miles and hit rank 1 most months so again wrong assumption.  You're just another boosted scrub I usually carry in my games.  Learn to play the game, learn counters and maybe you won't come on here to whine like an infant and wish death on people that reasonably responded to your dumbass post lol.  Your personality is so ugly to go there man.
---
I mean I guess but some of them keep hitting me the whole time I'm on there too.
---
Dude if it's that loud for you how are you handling survivors literally screaming next to your ears when you hook them? Lol
---
Yes, now you use false claims to make it seem the person you are arguing is worse. Fucking kill yourself you pathetic beta male. You have no life. All you do is play games and eat food you actual obese cunt
---
Before my time, but it was a good ending :)
---
When I started playing I did it to stop the screaming, but nowadays I only do it to BM the survivors who ran the BM windows all game.
---
Tldr to stop screaming or to bm
---
Beacuse i dont sleep from 3 days
---
There was no noed so you could’ve gotten out if she blinked and hit you or hit you normally, you have a speed boost and she has a fatigue delay or a hit cooldown. This was poor planning on your part as well as karma for staying longer
---
Pls i have 3 karma:(
---
the chainsaw is constantly a droning noise on the menu
---
I play on PC with headphones?
---
I'm here to hook people not do math cos I suck at math
---
well, as long both side cannot see perks and what killer to against it. i think its fine. since almost everything have counter. like ruin with small game or other perks. spirit with fixated, iron will, etc. tunnel with DS and BT, facecamp with kindred.
---
You used it right as you got downed so it double insta heals you, which is kind of dumb
---
I mean I suppose, I just dont see how it's that loud to cause a headache if other things in the game arent also hurting your ears
---
So you’re saying the killer should not use NOED?

---
Good job! 👍😄
---
Is it a wraith? If so say hi and thank you for me
---
Naw. Look how clearly unfair this match was for the killer. They said it would use the highest rank survivor, but the killer here is only rank 6, and the highest rank survivor is rank 3. Surely the only way a fair match can be achieved is by pitting this team against a rank 3 omega blink nurse. Only then will both sides have an equal chance of victory. /s
---
Steve next killer confirmed
---
they should make insidous make killer can go into locker and head on survivor lol. it will funny
---
What tier lists are you possibly referring to?  Wraith is consistently placed in the bottom tier among the weakest killers in the game in every tier list.
---
It was The Cannibal, I was a Claudette.
---
But take a free upvote instead :)
---
I know these survs just got trolled, because they thought they had plenty of time left, but EGC timer is bugged for survs right now.
---
Mb, I associated 3rd year anniversary with being on par with the year 3 roadmap, Plague is a year 4 however she isn't included due to the fact that that was last years road map at the very end, although I guess you can half count ghostface as his orgin or story is from BHVR and not a direct character like Demo...
---
First time is always the best time
---
This happened to me and my friends a few times. Seems to happen after a custom game. I even submitted a ticket but they told me they wouldn’t do anything 🙃
---
Tapping is honestly fine, they waste a second tapping it and load into the animation where I can just smack it again for 100 bp
---
Imagine complaining about the Plague.
---
You do realize Myers is already called "The shape", right?
---
It depends if a killer has to wait like 15 minutes for a game just to dc that's pretty funny that they're that triggered and have to spend time waiting again
---
Survivors can find games super ez thats why I DC if its prayer beads
---
Okay how about adrenaline only works when generators are done not when the hav is closed
---
Why does the Killer seeing me mean I can't escape?
---
I can 100% escape the Killer who sees me leaving through the gates.
---
Mic drop.
---
Multiple team members are usually strong at looping so they're good at eating up chunks of your time.  These survivors are also much better with situational awareness and will often spot you approaching even when running silent wraith and position themselves in the safest spot possible to begin the chase and avoid the first uncloak hit.  They just get stronger to the point that some games it may feel like you have no power.  Also they get better at cleansing totems so NOED gamers usually only boost so high before they reach reds.
---
I've been liking Blackout club as well but we already have a killer named the Shape
---
Nope. Is your skin purple with yellow polka-dots btw? Because you are speaking like someone with purple skin and yellow polka-dots. Only people with purple-skin and yellow polka-dots try to insult people for pointing out that you can do better at the game instead of blaming everyone else and  probably have a better time.
---
Who gonna tell em
---
personally i want to see The Boogeyman. one of the skill is make trap inside the locker, the survivor who is pass the locker will get drag into it with fast vault with notification and make them injured while they strugling going to escape from locker.
---
Imagine this was an april fools map
---
Myers: am I a joke to you?
---
Destroy it! Cast it into the fire!
---
This is why I'm in this sub
---
I saw that coming, and I support.
---
I particularly love ussylis because hes not toxic and play extremely well
---
Most impressive.
---
If they can only get kills with NOED then yes, because it just means that they basically let the survivors do all the gens (the killer's have 2 goals in the game, to stop gens being done and to kill survivors) 
---
If you can only get kills with NOED then you are not a good killer and there is no way about fighting that fact, tell me how it's not true.
---
Gen rush? Use ruin, ruin got destroyed, your gonna have to have tighter checks on all the gens, try and get a triangle gen set up for end game if you can, but good survivors will not let that happen
---
Toxic survivor/s? Toxic how - by gen rushing? You mean playing the game whilst you chase the same one survivor for 3 gens? Or toxic for t-bagging and flicking their flash light? They want your attention, they know you will go for them and they know they can run you around, just don't follow them when they want you too, chase them when they aren't doing this...
---
The game isn't hard man... ask me anything you want, be really with me
---
It's obnoxious. Of course, if Ruin did its job more effectively, gen tapping wouldn't be an issue.
---
Watch out for the big room

Ps4- not everyone playing swf gets put into the same lobby,its a miracle if thats even possible, a whole bunch of game crashes,extremely long wait times to get in game, ive spent the past 20 mins trying to get into a match as survivor, and matches as killer take twice as long to find, please can you not focus on cosmetics for once!?

I'm having the same issue on PC as a survivor. Last night I just couldn't get into games at all. Friday night, with a bloodhunt, after a popular DLC releases. Something is terribly wrong with matchmaking.

Its all rng, you have to get lucky with the teachable, though since you probably don’t have many teachables you might be able to get it. But instead of running self care, get the teachable for bond and use that in place of it

Alright, nice. Good to see we are on the same page
---
Honestly I only ever do it when the game screws me over, like lagging/glitching.
---
It’s only in extreme scenarios though. I just can’t stand trying to escape a chase while injured, the game lagging me in spot for 3 seconds, and suddenly I’m teleported backwards on the floor next to the Killers feet. Shit is annoying and frustrating because it wasn’t my fault.
---
Sorry the game is too hard for you bud. That's gotta be rough.

I'm not defending camping. 95% it's a dumb move by the killer and costs them valuable time and other kills.
---
It's not like Myers can fucking teleport in T2 dude. He has a smaller terror radius sure but he's still easy to spot. Maybe you should have more situational awareness instead of staring at a gen. Move your camera around some.
---
I have led Myers around a full use of T3 without going down, and I wasn't using perks. I really don't see how you saying "WELL I'M BAD AT THE GAME, GUESS IT'S MY FAULT I'M BAD AT THE GAME" is any kind of valid argument.

Yeah, it's a infuriating trick used by good survivors all the time. One the reasons I play Billy is that I can rev my chainsaw the second they randomly stop and start healing themselves right in front of me.

one person had the glitch with me but the other survivors didn't

[https://imgur.com/sWhN5YW](https://imgur.com/sWhN5YW)
---
P(AB)= being seen and escaping = 30%
---
P(B) = being seen = 20%
---
P(A l B) = escaping given that you were seen
---
Using the conditional probability formula:
---
P(A l B) = P(AB) / P(B) = .3/.2 = 150%
---
You say “you have a 30% chance of being seen and escaping” therefore, unless there’s an error on your part, I’m right
---
Thanks for the reply. I’ve been working all week so only able to play 1-3 games a night so haven’t leveled up any other killers yet. I plan to get a few other killers to 15 that I like to play just for 4 perk slots so I’ll keep an eye on those webs and let you know.
---
Did you screen shot this, yikes
---
Thanks! 😃
---
The survivors still can prevent NOED from happening it’s not that hard please tell me how hard is it to cleanse 5 totems?

No, do you want a hint?

Can you close the bloodweb and open it back up. Does that fix it. Maybe restarting the game? That truly sucks.

Boys, i think we found the person who didn’t buy the game

I dont understand
---
It's a video game, if someone brings luck perks/offerings you might as well try. People are so uptight in this game. Lol
---
I'm not asking what the probability of escaping and being seen is. I'm asking the probability of escaping IF you've already been seen.
---
It's a conditional probability question and it's worded correctly.
---
Que the influx of people on this sub that somehow think that's a fair match. I thought it was a fucking joke when they put that in the patch notes.
---
Hiding your aura from BBQ at all costs is not always the best play. It prevents the killer from going after someone far away from the hooked person. The killer will leave the area but since he had nowhere else to go, he will come back immediately after the unhook happens. 
---
There is a reason BBQ shows auras that are far away. I hate the fact that devs made this perk and added aura block to lockers on top of it.
---
Which one? If DBD, look at my flair
---
Nice! But I got my first 4K with billy on my 2nd or 3rd game...
---
Or you play a cake with your killer running beast of prey, hex: toth, distressing, and bbq planning to have a nice fun match where everyone gets points but the survivors rush gens and body block hooks as a team preventing you and them points forcing you to camp for one kill in the endgame. 
---
Both sides can be dicks guys.
---
I believe BHVR said if you get banned by the anti cheat or the custom perk colors they won't be unbanning.

Mhm, original meme, 10/10
---
Lol I'm at fault for a 99% Meyers now?  Dude I am quite good at this game.  I rotate my camera at all times during repairs and can loop.  That being said if a Meyers is 99% stalk and pops it on you midchase there isn't much you can do.  Smart killers pop it when they're right up on you and you can't make safety.  They gain haste and further lunge.  Sure I've outran T3 durations before but that isn't easy to do remotely.  You ripping on me for not playing well in that scenario us a fucking joke man much like you're jUsT dOn'T gO dOwN counter.  You literally know nothing about how to play this game if you seriously think any survivor is bad for going down a single time.  Even a shitty shitty killer will probably eventually down a strong survivor if they're willing to commit long enough chasing them and are willing to lose gens in the process.  Devs added 3 hook states not 1.  You claiming players are bad for going down to a killer a single time is a fucking joke man.  Like the whole circus type of joke.
---
It used to be just killer but now apparently it's killer and survivor because I'm having trouble too. Wtf did they do to matchmaking?
---
"RNG was godly this run, we got the WR gg boys"

Yea I mean I can definitely see how it is for some people that's just my opinion

To be honest when I play killer I feel like a bully for killing people lmao I know it's my objective it just feels wrong to me because of how much I play survivor lol kinda weird but I cant help it
---
I dont know
---
That's actually a pretty good way to balance her.

Going to suggest it to the developers.
---
Not to mention that it randomly doesn't save progress. I put 1 mil points into Demo this afternoon before coming off, went back on tonight to find he was back down to level 18. Really annoying

---
Doubtful since that would allow for sole really really nasty combos
---
The offering was waste. And we couldn't heal them because of knock out and the killer sticking around the area. 
---
The point to this rant is the fact that they wasted a bps offering just go and safety/depip. I see a lot people screaming "toxic survivors" but if anything, during these events it's the killers who go out of their way to be toxic and not let survivors actually get bps.
---
You’re wrong

it had the nuts to steal Freddy away from the Dream Demons

though the Dream Demons probably couldn't even compare to The Entity or the Mind Flayer

I mean, I would burn my BPS if I had them, but every time I do I get tunneled down and am the first person dead every game for a grand total of 7k BP, so what the fuck is the point?
---
Omg.

I have literally always seen it as a face too. I knew that had to be wrong but I’m glad it’s not just me!
---
Ez clap
---
Since the stranger things dlc releases, I’ve gotten disconnect and lag issues like crazy. Or just general connection issues. It’s annoying. Especial when you’re in the middle of adjusting your load out to go into the next match and it kicks you back out to the main menu for no reason.
---
Yeah and the game was probably going so well because it usually takes up to the third or forth gen to fully charge a tombstone Myers in reality the Myers was probably actively not hitting you so he could build up his tier 3 without you guys running away.
---
I don’t mind when I’m killer I just go on my phone :p
---
forsenHobo
---
Purple and Iridescent keys can be used to open the hatch without attachments when it normally wouldn’t be open. The other keys can be used with attachments that do things such as reveal the killers aura or reveal other survivors’ auras.
---
Honestly they really shouldn't if they aim to improve.  If they're new or just casual players it doesn't matter though really.  That's the target audience for the perk.  It teaches horrible game losing habits that are difficult to break like not pressuring gens and overcommiting to long chases.  Killers that play without it get much better much faster.  This is the main reason I don't mind them running it.  Killers that run NOED are usually mindlessly easy to loop and get gens against.  I run Small Game so the one trump card they hinge their whole game on usually gets prevented from spawning more often than not.  Good survivors basically have their way with NOED gamers.
---
I now want this skin on my minecraft account, I also want to play as this skin in dbd. Nice job!
---
I posted first, i decide, this is totally meme battle

Devour Hope is SO DOPE when it actually works. Yamaoka or Hawkins are pure evil when it comes to totems. Game and Lerys are not bad as well, although most people know the totem spawns by now. Still I gotta say they are now WAY better than they were back in 2016

Alright. So, if I have a purple or iridescent key I still wouldn't be able to open the hatch until it pops up late game right? I cant like find it mid game or anything correct?

I don't find them hard to find, it's just on some maps (ie new ones or the swamp) it's alot harder to find them

My xbox character lost everything and support have replied to tell me I am wrong. But my stuff is all gone it's like I never played. Its taken months to even get this far with them. Kills me I played since release. I dont know how to get my stuff back if they wont help.
---
You’re right, nobody cares.
---
Played all day yesterday &amp; today. I have finally have p3 Jeff, my main. So many games where the killer is obviously trying to prevent survivors from earning points. Left quite a few games with less than 10k because I was tunneled to death. P3 5 blink nurse, go fuck yourself please.
---
Switch to killer and I don't know if it's my rank (13), but it seems like absolutely no survivors want to farm when BPS or cakes are burned. Unless I absolutely destroy them, then they'll happily want to farm as opposed to death. All round a very painful experience and one that I'll be skipping in future.
---
I know, and I agree with you. BUT when you think about it, licensed killers bring a lot of players to dbd. So idk ying yang I guess
---
Yeah that works as long as the survivor doesn't realise they can still hit the skillcheck when they are running away from the gen.
---
😐 Wow, that's rough.

**Corrupt intervention but for hex totems**
---
Not the gen tapping he's talking about, I made the same mistake. Lol
---
Not fun for the killer though?
---
I run pop goes the weasel and then them tapping the gen often leads to extra regression because you use pop, they tap, you hook someone and pop again.
---
I can make more minecraft if you want
---
Greeting from America 🇺🇸 👋🏻.  
---
I followed.  Always good to find more good streamers to watch.
---
Because the hatch being shut can litterally give a survivor 0 chance if the killer has high map pressure or the doors are close to each other
---
You don't understand probability then...
---
i play mobile dbd. usually take 5-10 minutes to killer match, to survivor take around 1-5 minutes
---
Yeah killer fov is a nightmare lol
---
The hatch will spawn at this rate. If you see it, you can open it and leave:
---
4 People Alive - All gens done
---
3 People Alive - 4 Gens Done 
---
2 People Alive - 3 Gens Done
---
The question is why you were waiting in front of the exit gate instead of running out
---
Has been the same on Xbox. Tried playing last night and it looks live a lot of people were having the same issue. (I was scoping out Twitter.)
---
I keep posting this in here, but I played for 3 hours yesterday. Out of those three hours, I was in TWO short matches. Sad times lol.
---
Farming is against the rules of the game. That killer could be banned now
---
You can see I have 35 days played but not a single point spent on the webs???? This has actually been a heart breaking ordeal haha I'm gutted.
---
Just messing around man, but I hope someone comes along and takes it seriously for your sake, you sure do love your probabilities. 👍🏼
---
Yes and no. Sometimes theres one survivor who did 4 gens by themself while no one on the team did anything but go down. Plus the survivor is slower than the killer, meaning the second argument isnt valid since it isnt a fair comparison. And I get it, a survivor shouldn't be handed hatch if no gens ever get done, but you can just be screwed over as a survivor who wouldve escaped if your team was made up of at least decent players
---
This is how every other killer works. Make your choice doesn’t work on hatchets and save the best for last also depletes on hatchet throws. Just one example. Any aggressive action that hurts survivors depletes stacks for STBFL.
---
Who cares? Whether your team lives or dies isn't my problem. Don't get me wrong, I'll save when I need to and still do gens, but it literally doesn't matter if me or my team win or lose.
---
Negative. Theoretically in a game of situation, that isn’t possible it’s more likely you have to multiply, not divide. You can’t have 150% chance of rain, more likely you’d have a .06% chance, and even so, there are still hundreds of factors that can contribute to it getting higher and lower
---
u/jarkortheburninator explained it to me, I just corrected it :)
---
Then run overcharge. It's fine.

thats fine and dandy but why not just keep P2P in the game as an option all the time...

He chainsaw'd me thrice and slugged me while chasing the others around for 10 minutes...I'm sure he had his fun. 😅

I sent pics of the stats where it shows time played, total blood points and more of my profile and killers/survivors all with no bp spent on them.

I don't get it
---
Do you want a lvl 1 rank 20 to play like a rank 1 ?
---
So... just hit it again? And if they hit it while running away that's genuinely impressive and they deserve it.
---
If you look anything up on wiki how you’re already a moron
---
LOL! It wasn't farming! It was just a really balanced game with randoms and we all managed to get out.
---
What it means is you can't have a 30% chance of escaping and being seen if being seen has a lower % chance.
---
This is what makes it a trick question.
---
You’ve already lost being allowed two exit gates and a hatch is unfair on the killers side and they will always lose. Imagine having a goal keeper that is required to defend three goals. It’s impossible even when the opposition only has one ball.
---
Killer would be required to camp hatch or the survivor instantly escapes but he escapes by the gates anyway if killer doesn’t move.
---
Kittie&gt;dbd
---
I don't blame survivors... I blame the devs
---
Your not wrong that it’s hard to find them in the swamp and the new maps but you still have perks to help you find them.
---
T H I C C
---
The survivor has just as much chance to find the hatch as the killer does. Neither player has any real advantage it’s just whether or not you find it first. 
---
I have also had plenty of people mind game the gate situation even when they are kinda close together. 
---
I object to everyone always trying to find some way to make the game easier.
---
when this is a repost that everybody's seen
---
Well, 4 and 10 rank isn't that balanced, but if u was not farming, im sorry
---
Tbh, I thought a perk would be nice that would be like 
---
*"Hide 1/1/2 activated totems behind a disguise of a dull totem".* 
---
To balance things out you could throw in that you also don't know which totem is the hex. Or as an alternative you could say that the disguise falls after a certain amount of time.
---
This would considerably slow down the game since everybody's doing totems JUST IN CASE it's a hex totem. That would probably be the death of NOED though.
---
Still not a waste, if he hooked them and the last one got away then he misses out on more points. Letting one bleed out then killing the fourth still gets you more than letting one go entirely. Also go ahead and say the killers are the ones being toxic and whining not letting survivors get points etc. But from what I see they aren't the ones making posts complaining because they got slugged
---
when i play surv and killer closed the hatch. my hope win is gone
---
My bad then. Didn't actually know hatchets depleted STBFL. I think they should update the description of the perk. But thanks for clarifying :)
---
Care to provide us with this proof? Maybe someone can actually figure something out with all of the evidence out in the open.
---
I don’t think killers with NOED  cares about improving they just want to have fun like survivors.
---
That's one of the main reasons I'm a killer main.
---
Why are people in here being creeps
---
I have around 200hrs, if I lost my mediocre progress, I'd be soooo pissed off, especially since I just bought the game now after playing on XGP.
---
Yeah sure, how?
---
Dang the head is big also well done 😄
---
Imgur. Copy and paste the link.
---
Lmao I see now I done it to the hillbilly as well
---
PC: 24h Rollback, I lost 700k+ BP and 3 survivor ranks :(
---
Most killers stay around the slug in my experience, I'd honestly rather bleed out than risk somebody else going down.
---
Oh dang, someone has a different opinion to me. Allow me to just throw around bullshit because I'm incapable of making a valid argument.
---
Did you read this before you hit reply? IT takes the form of a clown, a killer, that we very certain already have, I don't see Myers or Ghostface running around looking like a plant with down syndrome
---
I guess it's impressive depending on what skill level the survivors you normally face are. I usually play against survivors that can hit DS through Unnerving Pressence, overcharge is not that difficult even if you are running. Usually when a rank 1 misses a overcharge, it is because they didn't know you had it and wasn't expecting it.
---
Personally I use all my good items because I’ve been getting a lot of tunneling and camping killers, I want to prevent that
---
Had a Plague daily quest this morning so loaded up the ol' vomit vamp and waited for a game.
---
And waited for a game.
---
And waited.
---
Finally after 30 minutes of forming in classic Wow I get a lobby, load up my perks and use a BPS. Run up and puke on someone, and they insta-DC. Find someone else, puke on them, down them and...another DC.
---
Sorry to the last 2 survivors but I'm not waiting for another 30 minutes to get my ritual done.
---
*laughs in order doctor*
---
That's the second fastest escape I've ever seen!
---
If you’re rank 20 queues might be bad.
---
cat-&gt; animal-&gt;mammal-&gt;predator-&gt;killer-&gt; DBD
---
check mate libtard
---
/s
---
she’s played by gays and girls, so she can’t be toxic, those people don’t even know how to play the game. 
---
And yes I’m one of them
---
Shall I call PETA?
---
Cool idea! Will the chainsaw power (billy) just be some sonic meme?
---
It would complete decrease the flavor of the game because people will only choose the good survivor with the best ability and that's all you'll see
---
I agree, they should be unique. Idk how survivor mains don't complain about that.
---
But it'll die anyway
---
As long as Nea gets a horrible unique passive so Nea mains cry i'm okay with it
---
Balanced, as in points and hooks, ranking really means nothing these days with players intentionally depipping to be 'pros' against brand new players. 🙄
---
Gross.
---
You kinda need your team to escape unless you rely on hatch. And who cares? I do. I don't really care about my rank but I'll always try my hardest to escape and it triggers me when my team does dumb stuff. What's the point of playing any game if you don't try your hardest to win?
---
Cube map would be sick as hell
---
It's something I'd really like as well, but it'd need some other thing to balance that out like a downside or even one fewer perk slot
---
Every other comment is plebbitors filling the void in their heart by trying to earn karma.
---
I forgot the exact meaning but I learned it in school and when you are writing a letter its often used for an after thought. (Postcript maybe)
---
I wish that would happen to me
---
Omg nooooo 😭😭
---
\- \_ -
---
Ps4 - go to leave the exit gates and you keep running, can’t escape. Eventually you fall off the edge of the map and respawn in some random spot on the map til the end game timer kills you. 
---
Have had this problem for about 6 months now and it’s really quite frustrating they can’t fix this?!
---
Well DBD is a team based game at least from a survivor perspective if you guys can't work as a unit then you guys deserve to fail, by reversing your logic a killer main could say that survivors that work well together and get gens done quickly should be punished which doesn't sound fun or fair.
---
[Imma stop you right there.](https://youtu.be/tPB84Plv8tc)
---
The point remains. Just hit it again. I don't know why killer mains have to act like everything is the end of the world if it's not unequivocally in their favor. And I main killer.
---
This is why the games relatively balanxed at low lvl play... but highly skilled players and god forbid swf make the game skewed heavily in the survivor favor... and the only killers that have a hope of combating this are nurse billy spirit and huntress, hag if the maps are kind
---
This just sent me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
survivor could be the mentally challenged one thats good with numbers, One of his abilities could be too calm down other survivors like iron will but with an aoe effect around him.
---
sounds like you’re fun at parties
---
**M E G S L E G S**
---
All the uncommon ones in my inventory switched to red, so I think you're likely right that it will switch to red once purchased.  I love hanging onto the old things that get removed, I have all the common/uncommon map offerings stopping me from prestiging Claudette.
---
It would destroy the diversity of the survivor selections though.  Naturally one survivor would have a more appealing benefit and most players would play the same survivor or couple survivors.  At least with them being just skins you'll see all manner of survivors selected for games.  In summary the idea isn't a bad one it just would make games more boring by seeing 3 or 4 of the same character routinely.
---
It would be funny if you did air traffic control. Well funny then probably sad.
---
Baby Killer dud ez
---
this is all wrong my dude
---
Myers :(
---
Right? It also wouldn't really be OP and makes the game last a little bit longer. Even if you haven't got the perk equipped, the fact that this exists would make survivors more paranoid than ever about Haunted Grounds f.e.
---
Devour Hope also maybe gets more chances to shine with it
---
Same.....
---
God damn it
---
Sweet. I knew there were certain conditions, but never paid enough attention to figure it out. Thanks for the info kind stranger
---
Seen it before, downvote
---
Yup error code 8,012
---
Thank you. I thought it was just me
---
it just happened to me as well, is it dbd or steam?
---
(PC player) my game just won't even load at all and i got d/ced a couple times today... Their servers must be fucked.
---
nah im just not a douche. I like how you logged into your alt to reply after deleting the post though.
---
Here too. W-EU.
---
Steam is down for me
---
Just happened to me too, man. Maybe double DP will get extended for this. Unless they fix it quickly
---
Thanks for the reminder,I love my Saturday nights
---
Yeah i dont know if its bad luck but this event every killer has been tunneling and camping hooks.
---
Steam issue
---
But, the double bloodpoints...
---
I’m fairly sure it’s steam
---
Steam itself is down.
---
Me too. Damn...
---
Sorry guys. I legit just bought and downloaded it and it broke before I could get into my first game.
---
Obviously my fault.
---
We get it. No need to post twice
---
Just got a perfect game and it crashed as soon as the endscreen came up, ill be sad if i lose those BPs
---
Just be smart and dont cleanse
---
Steam is down
---
Oh my entity... yes
---
just called this guy a cunt cause he sandbagged me at the end and left wo rescuing me, then the error came up :( I wanted to see his ugly ass reaction, im sad.
---
RIP. I was in a farming lobby and thought I got banned for being a nice killer lmfao
---
Servers went down I'm guessing, so dbd
---
dammit, kren
---
My team suddenly turned into a coordinated seek and destroy totem team once I started using inner strength :(
---
Steam
---
https://steamstat.us/
---
Good to know I'm not alone.
---
Steam. It's not working
---
I just finished a match and it disconnected and i cant get back in game it says error code 8012
---
The hatch was always meant to be a last ditch effort for survivors who got screwed over by their team. Now I definetly think it was both powerful and annoying before EGC, but now the use for the hatch has changed to a way for the killer to start EGC instead of a last ditch effort. I feel this recommendation brings that balance
---
it's not on BHVR it's on Steam
---
😭😭😭😭
---
All in order:
---
**God Tier/Has no equal:** Nurse
---
**A Tier/ Able to defeat even the toughest SWFs:** Spirit, Billy
---
** B+ Tier/ Able to defeat almost all SWFs:** Freddy (you did him great, BHVR), Hag
---
**B- Tier/ Able to defeat most SWFs:** Myers, Huntress, Demogorgon
---
**C Tier/ Solid all-around but don't count on doing well against SWFs:** Ghostface, Pig
---
**D Tier/ Hope that survivors make some mistakes:** Trapper, Wraith, Plague
---
**F Tier / Hope that survivors are complete and utter potatoes:** Clown, Leatherface, Legion, Doctor
---
or stop being stupid and don't cleanse.
---
No, i ment the regular version.
---
Got the same error too.
---
I also noticed that after the most recent update a few of my steam files were corrupted and I'd join a match with EAC kicking me after about 1 minute. That made me disconnect without warning.
---
I thought a lot about that, but that already happens with killers, and it's much more extreme, but I think it wouldn't be that big of a deal, as the perks are desirable, it gives them another reason, because if the perks are already bad, thry wouldn't buy the survivor anyway.
---
maybe don't post twice
---
Why? It's fine as is
---
Quality ear rape
---
same :(
---
i was still in a game for sure when this was posted but yeah i was just now DC'ed and Steam is down for me
---
same here. crashed at the endmatch screen.
---
I hope it saved, or at least a troubleticket can be filled for BHVR to give those missing BP. =\
---
Legion is not that bad. Doc is not that good neither is freddy.
---
I would love streaks of leatherface moris dailies
---
\*Ackerman voice\* im in
---
well, it's over
---
I feel it’s fine the way it is. Once it becomes a hatch game, it’s not supposed to be fair. The survivors failed their objective, the killer earned the advantage he’s gained at that point in the match. You’re given one last Hail Mary chance at salvation, but it’s not supposed to be fair, the odds are supposed to be stacked against you once you’ve made it to that point
---
Just here to say that this guy is very sad individual who takes pleasure from the suffering of others
---
Could you all pls stop complaining about this game?! Honestly. *some reddit snob*
---
Needs creeper sound effects from steve
---
Steam is fully down I dont know whats happening
---
Now that’s hot
---
You want a 20 second cooldown for her standard Vile Purge that is non-lethal?  Tell me this is a shitpost.
---
^
---
You're right, we really should put huntress hatchets on a 20 second cooldown
---
Legion is that bad and Freddy is that good
---
It’s steam for sure. Logged in to my Xbox dbd without an issue
---
Same with me
---
Yup... it's just steam everyone... BHVR aren't the culprits this time
---
Had a definite 2 pip match, then it says "entity displeased" and I get kicked out of the game.  
---
If I lost rank for that shit, I swear to god...
---
Has been happening for me too for the past 5 min
---
Doc needs to be put down a few tiers, he's kinda bad without range ad dons
---
that's headphones
---
PC-
---
70% of the time when I exit DbD, I always have to shut off DbD via task manager, or I will find out that my computer is lagging through the next time I try to play, Discord, or Steam that tells me that I have been 'playing' DbD for 24 hours+. Is this a normal thing?
---
Same here honestly. I kept confusing it with Iron grasp until I took a closer look just now
---
Agreed, along with Billy chainsaw, Nurse blink, and Sprit phase /s
---
If it makes you feel better I’ve been playing killer all morning and keep getting at least 2 yellow Ping survivors
---
I would assume then that is would be reworded to something like...
---
You have a 100% chance of escaping when unseen by the killer. You have a 30% chance of escaping when seen by the killer.  The killer has a 20% chance of seeing you. What is your chance of escaping?
---
Got out of a game and got kicked.  Tried to log back in and got this error as well.
---
you sir, are an idiot
---
So this is the Entity’s overarching evil goal? To get us addicted to BP before leaving us with an insurmountable blood debt. One that we’ll pass to the children of our children all the while addicting a new generation and perpetuation game the cycle further.
---
Personally the only thing I think is completely wrong here is Doc. Base Doc with no perks or add ons barely has a power at all in higher ranks.
---
Everything else is about right, give or take.
---
I'm sure BHVR salutes you protecting their BP economy, bud. As for me, we just got around 20,000 new players, I'm willing to cut slack for the event.
---
I bet at the end of the match she claimed huntress to be OP aswell
---
I’ve had it up to hear with DBD. I was really excited to play on the double blood point weekend with my comrade, but the servers are broken and I can’t express my frustration in any way possible. It really ices my buns and pickles my cucumber. It makes me want to say the N word; I’m not going to say it as I’m not mixed race/black
---
Well...yeah...so....I CAN USE WHATEVER RESOURCE I WANT GUY
---
Haha good joke
---
But Carrie tho.
---
Spawned next to mine, oh god i hope they don't find it.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/Pd2hdRR](https://imgur.com/a/Pd2hdRR)
---
She claimed me no skill trash pathetic
---
Same, I guess servers just decided to die
---
not bhvr, steam servers are down
---
Another screen shot meme, jesus man
---
To be fair, spirit goblin-trots.
---
It's not BHVR's fault, it's a Steam issue.
---
Whelp, happened to me when I finally got the new map as the survivor!
---
Ebony Mori Hag. And Hag is one of my least favorite killers to go against &gt;:(
---
This is so unfair. I demand the Bloodhunt to be extended.
---
NOOOOO HE DIED! BINGBONG WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP
---
we should make repairing 20s cooldown when leaving the gen. also make 20s cooldown on crouch and running
---
Maybe try reinstalling the game?
---
They really should, about like 30% of so of waiting in que / unknown errors. I’m pretty sure they are aware of this issue, so hopefully they decide to give an extra day or two
---
Lol misplaced hate. Nice job
---
No, besides the one mistake I made in wording it's a functional conditional probability question.
---
You don't need the 100% info.
---
P(A l B) = P(AB) / P(B)
---
i think he want daily ritual cleanse the totem lol
---
Can’t you leave with a trap on your head when the EGT starts?
---
You did not provide enough information.  We don't know the percentage of won games without DCers.
---
He said he had the timer glitch, so he had no idea that he was in danger :c
---
Of course steam has to broke down now when the bloodhunt is on. I really hope BHVR will make it up for us even tho it's not their fault
---
The best feeling is when you finally alt-f4 and play a fun game.
---
*sad bingbongs*
---
It sucks that he died

killers have the advantage if the survivors arent all on discord or something lol
---
I was a bit off my rocker that match. IIRC he dead harded for distance which is something that always annoys me. Yeah I get cranky but no actual harm meant towards the survivor. Might have been doing the mori for a daily, clips like a year old.
---
find and kill as many as possible within 6 minutes.
---
When you dc, they still get the 5,000 points for you dc’ing and you lose two pips so why?
---
Steam is down. Give it time.
---
ok, got it
---
All of Steam is down globally... this was the entity's mater plan all along.
---
There are no servers for DBD. It's steam that is down.
---
you sure its purple i think it's a red one
---
No, if the trap is active, you cant leave through the doors (If the killer placed a RBT before the last gen is done...if she puts it after, you can leave as the RBT isnt active). What I dont remember is that the RBT activates if the killer/survivors open a door (if thats the case, then you cant leave either)
---
Sounds like you want to play Identity V. That game where they have survivors that can stun killers or block hits from anywhere. Imagine being a camping Leatherface and someone just snatches someone off a hook from 32 meters away.
---
You get 1500+ the normal 5000=6500. Why not look at what points you gain before jumping to conclusions.
---
the last update i heard about made it so only active traps did that. did they change it again?
---
If I see someone with a key I'm bringing a mori and killing them on their first hook.  If they want to skip part of the game to get out early i'll help them
---
I’m pretty sure you get the escape points plus the 1,500
---
why yall talkin bout balls so much
---
Press Space when healing. It doesn't give you a prompt for some reason  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Sorry, i didnt mean to be rude but you saying hatch is unfair made me a bit wonder because i think its a good game mechanic, sure sometimes it can feel a bit unfair of the killers point of view but remember youre the last survivor and lets say there are 4 gens left what are you gonna do if not go for  the hatch
---
While healing with the medkit (R2/RT) press L1/LB.
---
Then again I always pay attention in my games at rank 1 how long ruin lasts. On average it's there for half the game and the killer had 3-4 hooks at that point. Somehow, it is these type of spots that people tend to remember and not the everlasting ones which happen way more often than the bad ones.
---
It would make it pay to win. E.g imagine a licensed survivor has extra speed( which is game breaking for survivor).  Only way money comes in atm which can be considered pay to win is licensed killers, which isn’t too big of a deal as you can get nurse spirit billy without money
---
No problem. Also, yes that's quite a funny coincidence!
---
5%
---
Good survivors don’t need to verbally communicate to gain an advantage, and the game should be balanced for the highest tier of play, so my point stands
---
So they use tools and strategies in the game to be successful, and you don’t like that, so you DC? 
---
Yeah, they’re the problem.
---
So go try hard on everyone else trying to take it easy?
---
I love ghostface too, but there are better killers
---
Dirge would be very strong for doctor
---
You d/c'ing doesn't hurt them at all. It only hurts you as you lose all your BP, not them.
---
So you not only look like a baby doing it, but also don't negatively affect them in any meaningful way, only yourself.
---
Steam is down.
---
Heileges Kuh!  Thank you so very much! I wasted 3 in a row trying to figure it out!
---
Sadly, the wording seems to be the crux here.
---
They definitely have issues with their systems. About 2 year ago, I lost all progress and they gave me 10M BP to compensate. After a 1 year break, I came back with all my characters P3, even ones I never played or leveled before.
---
It really is always the one with anime profile pictures
---
It's not a DBD issue, steam is currently down so we can't play DBD, or any other online game sadly
---
Why is demogogorgon not in C. He sucks
---
Ohhhhh. So that’s what that is
---
What did you say?
---
yeah the game should be balanced for the 5-10% of survivors who play in a stack with level 3 perks.
---
Do u know when they will be back up by any chance?
---
Who?
---
Body blocks are free hits I don't understand why people complain about this.  I wish everyone body blocked honestly.  
---
Also gens are their objective? Doing their (only) objective doesnt make them dicks
---
I said in my post I'm on PS4.
---
Yea, the focus on your camera....
---
i replied with the title of the post to him. but he messaged first
---
Two no emblems, an iri and a gold right? Or do you get evader since you don’t get chased?
---
Do you get gold altruism if no one gets hooked?
---
Everyone should strive to reach the highest tier of play, and thusly that’s the level that games should be balanced for
---
I tried, I searched the lockers and looped around everywhere, when I looked at the ranks they were all 4-6 with brand new parts add ons. One kept trying to get my attention so he could run me around, I swatted him but then my tinkerer went off for two nearby gennies so I tried sneaking up on one of them but they were both done and gone by the time I got there.
---
XbxOne- Unable to play Custom Game with friends. Loading screens for days and disconnects, along with unable to play SWF (at least in my experience) since new update. could be just a me problem but I don't know exactly. Either one of my team DCs mid loading screen to lobby with killer or we end up unable to ready-up if we go back out to the Survivor lobby
---
4 people rank 4-6 with brand new parts
---
Thx for the info have a wonderful day :)
---
man I hope you never get into games development
---
That would be cool. Traps don’t kill too many people so her being able to get one back would be an interesting reward.
---
G2 a,, f🙏👌😜😜🙏😜😐😲😕😪🤣😢
---
She needs a buff to be sure and I think this might work but at the same time I think it needs to be seen in actual gameplay to see if it's balanced
---
Play how you want, You don't have to farm for anyone.
---
Yup, lost 45M BP here. I had P3 Ace and Billy with all perks and most characters were 50 with decent perks :( The most upsetting bit is losing the items I hoarded.
---
I Dc'd one match this entire week, pretty sure there's plenty more people that do much more, but yeah I'm the problem.
---
"When the game goes from hard but fair, to hard but FUCK YOU." -videogamedunkey
---
perhaps they were just better than you then, i guess.
---
You sir are what we call an asshole.
---
Seen this before on this subreddit
---
they're assholes for using keys too so it's fine
---
4 people severely outranking me with red toolbox add ons and genny perks , the match was over before it even began.
---
Are you a masochist?
---
Steam is down for me too :(
---
You are bugged. On PC all you have to do is restart your game. 
---
It was happening to me yesterday while playing with my friends. It would tell me the killer DCed and finished with 0 points on the scoreboard screen but my friends would continue on his lobby, even chatting with him in the post game chat.
---
I have no idea. AFAIK Steam is still down, so you can't play any kind of online game on Steam atm. I hope it is fixed soon tho; wanted to play and get some bloodpoints before going to bed.
---
So because people do it more, then it’s no big deal? 
---
They used toolboxes and got gens done. Nothing wrong about that. Being a sore loser and DCing isn’t the answer.
---
Keys are for hatch escape witch = More BP
---
Because I didn't feel like seeing teabagging at the exit gate and no pallets were dropped.
---
keys are for skipping the last few gens = free escape
---
The tenth repost of this meme I’ve seen this weekend
---
You sir, are a salty ass killer main. Go back to running NOED to win your games
---
You don't need that. It's a conditional probability question.
---
Did not know this was a repost, sorry ))
---
Art by me. Have a wonderful Blood hunt weekend, guys! -Love, MW.
---
Yes, it's a conditional probability question.
---
You have to get it just so you never get it again
---
Wrong.
---
That’s the object of the game for survivors though? Plus i only use keys to escape after killer closes hatch
---
Not really, most would assume being seen meant by the killer.
---
Steam is indeed down.
---
I concur. I was looking for ways to counter the red toolbox add on as I don't have ruin or any other good anti gen add ons so I have more of a chance in future games. Only two had visible auras with bitter murmur and only two had visible heart beats with killer instinct
---
Same, PS4. Happens almost every other match and I have to restart the whole game in other to play again.
---
With the EGC, they can only stay around for so long before being automatically killed, so there’s no need to go to the gates and forcefully chase them out anymore (unless you want to) :D
---
So the object of the game makes it okay? guess it's fine for me to mori them since the object of the game is to kill them.  Debate done I guess
---
Minecraft good paleta bad
---
Hag without Add Ons is far lower than you put her. Swap her with Myers and your list is reasonably accurate.
---
You the host buddy
---
Yeah, wait times are crazy on PS4 (Europe) right now :/
---
I love it. Also yeah the hair is kinda weird
---
I know they were lol, I just want to know of any tactics to counter red add ons for toolbox that aren't temporary like ruin
---
Love the idea. If a survivors removed a reverse bear trap, the trap falls to the ground and stays there. The Pig sees it's aura and can go retrieve the trap to use later.
---
i'm rank 4 and you ?
---
You don’t get as much bloodpoints if you Mori after first hook tho
---
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen on this subreddit. Quality job.
---
I’m so sad when I see my Jeff boy, he’s absolutely bald in a game.
---
Gg eZ NoOb UnInStAlL reeeeeeEEEEEEEE
---
Originally made actually... just joined reddit.
---
It's so hard to tell on this sub what is supposed to be ridiculous 🤷‍♀️
---
find and kill as many as possible, is the strat.
---
we already saw that a lot of times and in every games subreddit
---
The SWF I'm paired with: The bois fresh from whooping spiderman trolling some killers.
---
Me: Casually doing gens, unhooking, and other shit watching these idiots run around before I get found and camped to death for "being in a toxic SWF"
---
Please don't punish the rando.
---
We’re not all bad... 😔
---
And they're rewarded for ending the game early, if I used a red Mori and 4k with 5 survivors I literally depip. I need to know how to prevent them from using their red add ons without slaughtering them too early and being punished
---
It’s when survivors spam the crouch animation rapidly; it denotes the survivor dropping their nuts on your face, to further humiliate you in the success of whatever they’ve done (colloquially speaking: to add insult to injury).
---
Fair. But two of them had the Ninja perks and genny perks, I couldn't even detect them with my aura perks
---
Yep steam kicked the bucket like 45 minutes ago I am sure we will see it back within the hour hopefully they are not down to much longer was trying to get a few games in before I start my nightshift job especially with the double BP event going on I need my P3 Freddy.
---
Edit: looks like they are back in business
---
Yeah, i was really hoping to procrastinate and not do my final. Guess ill fucking work on it then....
---
Good thing this game has a test server... would love to hear (console peasant) how it would play out there
---
With my luck they'll visit the gen i'm working on when the game begins, then tunnel me everytime i'm off the hook.
---
They aren’t. If they all gen rush without chases, healing, totems, boldness, unhooking, etc. it’s the same thing. And you didn’t know they were using red add-ons when you left.
---
Ah I see you're a console peasant too
---
That’s exactly how I figured it out. I left and won with only 1,500 survival. Plus some self heal chump change
---
I stayed for the end game lobby after I Dc'd.
---
Lord please forgive me for what I'm about to do.
---
And doesn't a gen completion defacto guarantee you won't depip?
---
You’re supposed to. But in this case I didn’t. That’s why I’m complaining
---
What? That’s insane why would they DC, even if you get demolished and everyone escapes you’re still making 2-3 games worth of BP in that single match
---
Agreed. Too many tiny brained people with access to words and internet. It's all a cesspool of stupidity. I'm just here for the memes.🙊
---
Welcome to dead by daylight.
---
Only real issue here for me is that now you give her a Aurora reading of where that survivor took the trap off at
---
You can go to the character customization selection then go to the store from there. Afterwards you can return to the main menu. A more convenient workaround to the bug
---
Good post OP. I love destroying SWFs when they t-bag or flashlight click at me. Even better is when said toxic player is downed at the end of the game and I carry them to the hatch but drop them a few inches from it, close the hatch, nod, then watch them die to the entity.
---
I once suggested to my group 'what if one survivor perk was their power, like only Claudette could use self care or bill being the only one to use unbreakable?' They immediately kicked me 😂
---
For me whole Steam aint working at this Point.. So this is Worldwide Problem?
---
We got Leatherface, Freddy, and Pig one after the other, so I don't know why people are surprised. I'm all for year of original, then year of licensed, then back to original.
---
PS4, too. Same - "host unreachable", I can then no longer cancel searching for a new match (it is stuck "searching" but does not actually search) or back out entirely and have to restart my game in order to try and get into a match again. Happens the whole damn time.
---
Well jingles is a clown completely separate from AHS. The clown in AHS name is twisty. Jingles is from the 2009 horror movie jingles the clown. And the season of AHS that had twisty premiered in 2014 where as the curtain call dlc was released In June of 2018. So if anything the clown from dead by daylight is possibly based off of twisty.
---
And incredibly long waiting times, indeed! Up to 15 minutes for me in Europe!
---
It’s all of matter of gaining the attention they never got from their parents/loved ones in their life. They seek some kind of power and seek to be noticed, because their sad life is full of being ignored and bullied, so they bully others back to try and get some kind of emotion out of them to feel like they do, in fact, matter.
---
They’re sad human beings, just say gg or don’t respond, it’ll get them more angry and you’ll be able to laugh at how pathetic they are as they rant and rave at you hoping to god you’ll listen before slinking back to the toxic corner they choose to fester in, whining about Nurse or Spirit being OP and trying to do everything under the sun to be annoying and make others feel worse than they already do.
---
just shut the game down and restarted my system, hoping that fixed it.
---
Yea but everyone in my game was a solo. He had no reason to be upset
---
Pay attention after the end game screen pops up, it will say you have at least 6500 survival. It pops up “Obsession Escape 1500” when you go through the exit gates and then about 5sec later it says “Escape 5000”, you just have to watch for it.
---
Survivors bitch about this shit but don’t realize Killers just went against like 5 SWF 4 mans who teabag at every pallet and the exit gate and swarm to block every single hit so you can’t even hook.
---
100% agree. The queue issues make it very hard to enjoy this event. You have the choice to solo, wait forever, and get teammates that unhook like crazy for WGLF stacks or you can try to play with friends despite the fact that someone always gets left behind and you all gotta requeue. 
---
I have to say if BHVR wants to leave a good impression (on all the new players especially), an extension of Bloodhunt would be a simple and easy start. 
---
I’m dealing with it because I’ve loved the game a long time and I know the drill. If I was a new player though, I’d be super turned off.
---
Give it a delay
---
The blood on michaels suit is his own, he has 2 teeth left and internal bleeding
---
I brought a red mori, but only killed people by hand if it would've been their death hook. It gave me more BP
---
Yesterday i was playing against a demogorgon and 3 gens where completed after the chase so i was being camped and then i got unhooked and this dude was ready to tunnel me but somehow my friend ran between my scratchmarks and mixed them and the killer got confused and ended up chasing my friend, so the killer straight up rage quitted. it made my day. lol
---
From the side who's been doing the latter, I just literally don't have any. I came back to the game literally one day after the anniversary event so I didn't have any Gateaus saved up.
---
I'm not complaining I got slugged. I get slugged all the time. I'm just saying they wasted a bps offering by slugging and losing out on all the points. But sure, take it that way lol 😂
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking otherwise in the times when you are on the clock to get it off and don't have a chance to get back to full health just to get her coming back to you would be bs
---
Sure bud. Haven't run NOED for a couple years now but I'll put it on just for you since you asked so kindly. Sounds to me like you're a salty ass survivor main. Go back to running your balanced landing haddonfield infinites with your key. See how stupid it makes you sound? Oh, who am I kidding? You're not gonna realize that you're a dumbass
---
I love how the survivor goes into his inventory
---
I think it’s pretty balanced
---
Make it an add-on. Any discarded traps will cause an effect like when someone messes up on a gen. They start to generate an aura when you get in range.
---
Ow? I quess sorry, but i actually made it with meme maker.. someone must have made same kind of thing before me :(
---
how do I do that
---
Play F13 then, Jason can insta kill you hahah
---
He’s tall he gets more distance per step
---
Well considering dedicateds aren’t out yet, I don’t see why you’re ruling they wouldn’t in the future.
---
Personally I want it to be extended because I wasn’t free this weekend and now have to play without extra blood points.
---
IT will never be a chapter. If it is, my name is not Soldat. You may call me Meyer.
---
Lightweight exists so the first perk is kinda useless but otherwise it seems alright
---
Now I want the ability to jump as a survivor lol
---
I prefer two charge time decreasers.
---
Stops them from using windows most of the time and breaks pallets fast.
---
He was hiding his red glow, not a bad move if you think the survivor is waiting at the corner to see if you're coming thru the doorway.
---
I like to put one on with one speed tbh
---
&gt; Also gens are their objective? Doing their (only) objective doesnt make them dicks 
---
The problem with the community is how one sided these justifications usually are.  
---
Survivors 'rushing' gens ==&gt; They are just doing their job.  
---
Killers 'tunneling' a player to eliminate one threat and slow down the game ==&gt; HOW DARES HE TO BE TOXIC LIKE THAT?! THATS AGAINST THE RULEBOOK! -Rep -Rep -Rep.
---
A KILLER IS SUPPOSED TO BE NICE SO THE SURVIVORS ARE HAVING FUN!  
---
I wish people wouldn't complain about basic and counterable game mechanics like camping and tunneling.  
---
I don't do it. It's not BP effecient.  
---
But I can see why people do it. And I can see how it's the right call to make (atleast in certain situations).  
---
But if you do it, everyone will hate you for it.
---
Some will even report you for doing it aswell as harassing you in the post game chat.
---
Why?   
---
Because it's "not enjoyable" for the survivors side.  
---
Meanwhile the survivors do similiar stuff which is unfun for the killer and nobody cares.
---
20
---
That's a subjective thing to say.   
---
You make it sound like a fact, which is wrong.  
---
Because going by your logic basically anything could be an asshole move.  
---
Bringing a key? That will deny the killer BP.   
---
Sounds like an asshole move.  
---
Or how about just rushing gens and escape early? Less BP.   
---
Asshole move!  
---
Like ... the list goes on.  
---
There are legit asshole moves like holding the game hostage, sandbagging someone and similiar stuff.  
---
And then there are people like you who state their opinions as facts.
---
You can't yet. But it's not that hard to upload to YouTube, and it's better for everyone that way! :) Only takes a little more time, and the jump in quality is well worth the slight bit of patience you have to have.
---
microtest. microtest. microtest.
---
You see sportsmanship in videogames!!!????
---
Nobody on the internet would congratulate a total stranger on a minuscule accomplishment unless there was a reward behind it, which is Karma.
---
Yes do it
---
I mean, it's *her* perk. I get the feeling those show up way more often in their respective characters' blood webs, don't they? I'm relatively new still so I'm just guessing.
---
But I had Dwight at Bond 3 before he was even level 20 for example.
---
Also since I'm pretty new still, I haven't unlocked a lot of teachables yet. So my pool of perks the blood web can pull from is smaller than veterans'. Bigger chance for Meg's own Adrenaline to show up because of it, I guess.
---
\&gt;  **Don’t start Self Caring** 
---
Just don't start self-caring at all. Use a med-kit or bond or any of new perks from Strange Things chapter.
---
This is a dead perk for low ranks who doesn't understand the basic principles of the game.  No discussion.
---
###
---
What the fuck
---
:/
---
U r gud person
---
You'd think but I've been high 40s before some show up (usually post prestige if that matters)
---
You can see whats going on can't you
---
Woof!
---
Yup, steam be down Mr Worldwide
---
kinda meh
---
Fair point. And to be honest after dealing with the Trapper having to collect his traps for all these years I change my mind. When a survivor removes a RBT the trap should just go back to her inventory. That way their location to her isn't revealed and she doesn't have to stop patrolling to retrieve the trap, win/win.
---
I got another buff idea for her traps - active ones grant the oblivious status effect, but with non-active ones you can hear the Pig's terror radius. Puts a little more emphasis on survivors with an active trap to get them off asap since they won't be able to know if the Pig is coming at them.
---
sounds like a bad killer LMAO
---
I play to have fun, besides, there is no significance difference in the bp you get from just playing normally, especially if you're playing killer.
---
How?
---
Yes just the 3. 
---
However, use any add-ons or offerings you want/need to get the job done, you can still get the Adept. The perks are the only restriction.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dam7q7/ghostfaces_expose_in_a_nutshell/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I don't? I just said overcharge isn't really effective against the survivors I usually play against. Lol
---
Or I am a Nurse or Spirit, you can shove that flashlight up your colon.
---
or... make them kill if you try to leave with them on, but put a jigsaw box that guarantees to remove out the door or something?
---
I have gotten a 4k with the demo and got entity displeased(with no mori) and the game said i disconected ( i also got 29k bp)
---
If the killers running light born, both sides lose lol
---
This has happened to me way too much after the update
---
same here. dont think theres any fix
---
&gt;I play 50-50, so don't try and call me biased.
---
I didn't call you anything. I only responded to your response which only shows one side of the picture.  
---
&gt; and it's killers fault for not having enough map pressure. 
---
I would say it's just bad gamedesign. Majority of killers "should" lose by default if the survivors are competent.  
---
I don't blame the survivors for rushing through gens. But I wouldn't blame a wraith either that won't be able to do anything against it.
---
&gt; There's little to no reason to flame someone in post. 
---
I didn't flame you?
---
&gt; just say gg and leave if you don't want to talk nicely. 
---
Yes, that's what I am doing. But thanks for the unasked advice, I guess?
---
Because you're cheating and getting reported directly to BHVR. /s
---
1337 hours for 137 cheevs. Dank.
---
Nice! 
---
I’m always happy to see a first-hooker make it out in these situations.
---
He wasn't a bad killer, he kinda did make someone DC, and two of us were on last hook.
---
Hahah!
---
Did you still ignore bones, bring toolboxes, and have one person flashlight-harassing the Killer to try to lure them away? It looks the same to a lot of players.
---
That’s what I wanna know
---
They're all going to heal each other but there's not enough space so it's bugging out and causing them to climb
---
Because you're gatekeeping half of the game.
---
No dude, his connection is green.
---
Dbd isn't that type of game, if you want to play competitively you're playing the wrong game. The fact that it is so unbalanced makes it silly to take the game seriously. On top of that there is literally no reward for winning, you just get bloodpoints, big whoop. I don't go out of my way to troll people, but at the same time it really is not a big deal if I do something that is not "optimal".
---
The last paragraph wasn't directed at you specifically. You gave your opinion on what was wrong with the community so I gave my take as well
---
Yep, I agree. The game isn't without its issues, but my friends and I used to wait forever for matches, have to requeue over and over, etc. Sometimes we'd only get one game an hour. I've only been playing for about 10 months, but my experience now is so much better than it was when I started.
---
You can take a few moments to upload a higher quality video, can't you?
---
you're the minority
---
Games from two decades ago that are P2P, I can still play. The majority of games from 1 decade ago with dedicated servers I can't pkay.
---
You decide which is better. I'd always rather be able to play with my friends than forced to play online.
---
Nice idea. 
---
I’m on PS4 and not a new player, but I wish more friendlies like you were out there. My sis and I have been playing so long that we like to adopt newer players to mix it up and it feels good to help out the community.
---
It’s almost as if people just want to play the game instead of farming. But idk, could be just my imagination.
---
Just one question, why specifically the Demogorgon?
---
i think he has STBFL confused with PWYF
---
You’re spamming random fucking probability/statistic math problems in a subreddit about DBD, and you have the fucking balls to tell someone who uses the subreddit to fuck off, gtfo lmao
---
Me too, but you don’t usually think to screenshot a notification
---
 Ccx  v v c vggfc.   C bv xxxxdxxcx ',xx ccj b vcd... mlm...

Or that.
---
Here are the [patch notes](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/84930/patch-notes-3-2-0-ptb) 
---
If you can find the change, tell me.
---
sure double bp events are nice but a lot of killer players use the most op shit all the time. good point gain tho
---
No. It almost as "I camp hooks when no gens are done, no ruin broken and just tunnel unhooked until he dies. Repeat.
---
It was when we popped 4 Bloody Party Streamers.
---
You're actually an idiot lmao. Killers are so much faster than survivors and y'all literally gain bloodlust and you're talking about infinates? Yeah. It definitely seems to me that you're a salty ass killer main. Go back to running NOED, Hex Ruin, BBQ and Chilli ETC. It's the only way you're going to win any games at all. You're probably a face camper as well 😂 you're the dumbass.
---
But e doops
---
Every time you crouch there should be a 1/1000 chance of the entity grabbing your leg and holding you in place tbh
---
&gt; because i don’t get the fun out of playing that match
---
I'll hit you with a 500 IQ hard hitting fact which might destroy your world-view:  
---
A PvP game like Dead by Daylight isn't allways supposed to please both factions, especially if you are on the losing side.
---
Someone is tunneling you? Camping? Someone uses an overpowered perk? 
---
SWFs are sitting in coms, break the balance of the game and ruin your day? 
---
Your totem gets cleansed in the first 20 seconds of the game? Someone is using an insta heal, key or mori?  
---
All these things are allowed to use. The devs gave us these tools to use and play with.  
---
Using these things doesn't make your opponent(s) an asshole.  
---
It's frustrating for one side, yes.
---
But I wouldn't insult a person for doing it.
---
I play on PS4 but I respect what you're doing here!
---
the games worst state was during the legion release when ormond could crash games, there were infinite load screen and then there was also the worst killer release in the games history, but the game is in a pretty bad state matchmaking wise but otherwise its probably in the best state its ever been
---
Yes tis be idubbsuz but looks like the  doctor
---
Idubbz, on the contrary, is more intelligent than the average person. This is just for those who might've thought he's some Murican fool.
---
Another reason why you shouldn’t take loans from the entity.
---
you are a demomolegon now boy live with it
---
Id prefer something original.
---
Ik he's big smart he just acts dumb
---
I was thinking like he’d be a DS counter. But yeah in general any stuns would activate his rage.
---
Yeah your playing the worst survivor in the game
---
camping gets rewarded, toxicity is more then ever, i do like the event, it just works on the opposite way towards people that dont wanna play killer and play survivor they just get tunneld every single game and face camped aswell above rank 10. its kinda sad this camping doesnt get punished in some way its not effective or usefull anymore..
---
He really do doh 😂
---
Ik
---
Pros: prestige clothing (bloody varient of default) and it also says you get slightly better things on blood web
---
Cons: reset to level 1 and lose all offerings, addons, and perks
---
69
---
I think he got an email asking for his account stuff and what happened. I lost like three levels, so it wasn’t enough for me to want to submit a ticket. Hopefully you can get yours back. :)
---
Literally just got done playing this.
---
People are toxic in every game, I play this game frequently as both survivor and killer and barely ever see toxic activity.
---
Okay so unchanged from before. I dunno maybe I'll prestige for the bloody piece and then move on to the next killer I need teachables from. 
---
Thanks much.
---
You forgot insidious
---
Of course. Good luck out there.
---
Happy bloodhunt
---
In our mom's basement? Yeah
---
I built my BP bank up to around one million before prestiging. Gets you to the 30s, which should be enough to get most of the perks you want unless you’re really unlucky. 
---
I do it so people know I mean bidness (AKA that I play way too much).
---
&gt; If you camp the last hook, the other survivor doesn't go for the save. He can already be on the hatch.
---
Those *are* your words.  If there is a last hook to camp, then there is, by definition, no other survivor to go for the save or the hatch.
---
The trapper isn’t naked ?
---
I DC against 1 tap clowns.
---
"Fuck you Entity, this bitch is about to get stoned!"
---
I would contact a supervisor within the support and show them the videos. Any smart person should know that within 34 days, you would have touched the bloodweb. Who plays and doesn’t get perks, items or offerings?
---
i dont think he dced. i think you only need to restart the game cause the game had a hiccup or something. it happened to me aswell multiple games in a row and i jsut restarted it and it never happened again.
---
4,76%??
---
I doubt they’d get Joker (but I also doubted Demo). 
---
I’ve been beating the drum for Creeper from Jeepers Creepers, but I’d be all for an original. Maybe a werewolf, swamp thing, creature from the deep, or demon/devil type of thing.
---
Today I wanted to DC for the first time in a really long time, maybe since I've started playing the game back in 2016. I would never DC just because the survivor outplayed me.
---
I had two guys in my match who I just couldn't hit, I thought it was a bugged collision but I quickly realized there was something wrong, because they obviously knew about it. I could hit the other two, and killed them however it was fucking annoying when those cheaters were farming them and I couldn't go after them. 
---
Like after killing those two normal players I had to wait before those fuckers decided to end the game. It was fucking annoying and yes, I was thinking about quitting. After the game they even admitted they were cheating without any fucking shame and then started insulting me in Polish, of course those two were SWF. Next time I'll actually DC against people like these and I'm not even ashamed about that.
---
The PS4 playerbase is decent and I don’t run into the same players too often or anything. It is less stable than PC but certainly playable. 
---
Just be aware there is an event happening right now (until Monday) which leads to a lot of players queuing as killer and less playing as survivor. If you want to play killer, it’ll be a few days before the wait times return to normal. This isn’t typical so should be considered if you buy/play this weekend.
---
I’ll do you one better! Mrs. Foster as a survivor
---
happened to me the other night during a game as the Demogorgon, two survivors DC'd so I caught the other two and used the unspoken DBD language to signal I wanted to farm and we just did that and I let them escape
---
also a tip of farming for the Demogorgon, place many portals near each other and keep teleporting between them as the survivors seal them and keep opening more
---
147
---
I actually fucked up, it's impossible to solve.
---
Also, when he jumps over pallets he goes "Blehhh!" Like a true vampire.
---
150
---
This is how my back feels after work
---
Nope, can't beat that.
---
If losing badly (especially after a lot of time off) and trash talk is making you doubt your purchase, you may want to try and thicken your skin a little bit. It’s just a game.
---
Cmon fellow killers, respect the 4%..
---
Wanna play as killer? Wait times broken. 
---
Wanna play as survivor? Collapse timer broken.
---
Wanna play either? “Error”
---
What is going on? My GF and I both rushed to buy this for the switch instead of waiting so we could take advantage of this event. Something has to be done.
---
Unless you're positioned perfectly the prompt will appear and she can close it as you're jumping in. It's really hard to block the prompt from the killer.
---
Even if one survivor lets me hit them, if they use the speed boost from getting hit to get further away from me than the survivor they just unhooked (especially if they also have an exhaustion perk like Lithe) then goes who I'm still going for? The fresh unhook still.
---
You have to be willing to hook trade if you're going to unhook in front of the killer.
---
155 is my guess. Good luck to everyone who enters!
---
Reporting it won’t do anything because it isn’t against the rules to camp. 
---
It’s understandable for to be salty about it, though. It’s a stupid play by the killer in many cases and it completely ruins your game, so plenty of people get salty about being camped. But you’re best off just moving on to the next game and forgetting about it.
---
          * Oooooooooh *
---
“Gimme a straw, I want to suck your blood.”
---
I dont know how to escalate further than support to be honest, I have tried to PM Not Queen on discord.  I replied to the email protesting my innocence and the sincerity of my claims. Hopefully someone will review and see the error.
---
Bonus points for it actually being September.
---
Devil would be cool his power could be something like desire take the apple totem for 3000 BP but you and your whole team suffer 6% movement penalty
---
Cause survivors want 5k Escape points.
---
JuSt DoNt GeT DoWnEd
---
Lol.
---
I never have streamers but i always try and burn for everyone.
---
Tbh camping makes them lose since most of the time it will end up getting them 2 kills at most
---
The event isn’t in the switch version.
---
I don't play for that long yet and I find teabagging hilarious sometimes. Just like in Mario maker versus. Great way of communication! 
---
I know I'm nub, but If I manage to get one at the exit gate because he tries to troll me.. I don't have mercy :D
---
Just being a dick in the chat is annoying.
---
I love it. It's like those memes I see on YouTube.
---
they are noobs just like you and do not even know better. hell I doubt they even know this sub exist
---
Same! Then Steam wouldn't open for about 30-45 mins for me. Bruh. I was mortified because it said if I launch the game right now, I'll probably lose progress. So that's why I didn't. I restarted my PC 2 times and nothing happened until the last time I tried, Steam finally opened without giving me a warning about losing progress on DBD if I launch it.
---
Nah. It's actually a mistake for killers. It can suck for the one person, but as long as the survivors start doing gens, he'll be so far behind once the one actually dies.
---
End of the match there's a hidden option to the very right of each players column just hover over it with your pointer.
---
And then the killer hooks you once and insidious camps until you die
---
Regardless of camping, you shouldn't expect killers to want to farm or play a certain way bc of an event/certain offerings.
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
well then you must detect them with your eyes instead perhaps.
---
Faster, stronger than any other killer. Impossible to outrun. Has no hands, couldn't hook a single person.
---
Yea fck those guys
---
smash or pass?
---
When I run out of BPS and cakes I think I'll run ebony moris but not use them just to scare the survivors.
---
Hopefully someone responds back to your follow up email. I can’t believe that’s happening to you. Definitely unfair, especially to someone who plays their game.
---
Look at the comment I replied smh
---
Is it a normal tactic?   No. Not really. It happens. And really the only penalty for the killer is a drastically lower score if your team does gens while you hang and that dumb for him.
---
Ashamed?  I don't think so really. Unpopular opinion around here but I get more salty when someone tells someone else how to play the game. The killer is shit posting you for doing gens. I have gave camped assholes that teabagged all match or really pissed me off some how.  Did I feel ashamed? Nah, justified is more like it. And I basked in the salty comments post match with a beer and laughed. 
---
Nah be salty. No shame in it. Everyone gets salty. Everyone. The one's who say they don't are liars. 
---
Not reportable. If you wanted to go to super cunt levels you could post some hate on their profile (assuming steam).
---
I wouldn't pair the 2, when ruin is up, survivors know to look for totems, which increases the chance of them finding and cleansing both. I usually do devour hope alone tbh, they usually dont notice until its too late
---
Maybe the glitch where the timer doesn't go down to survivors? Another dude also died
---
Someone put Magic Jump from Labyrinth to this
---
If killers keep hook camping a way to be cheap , then survivor need to mic up.
---
You know if they’re toxic or not by how long they wait. If they’re gone in an instant they’re probably not, if they don’t you dodged a toxic ass bullet by not going to the gate
---
The Teletubbies are 7 feet tall.
---
My thought too after I saw this clip over and over again . I was under the impression too that the killer was going to chase the other survivor while I was finishing up but later made his move to head over my way.
---
this is the funniest thing i've seen today
---
Newer player here. If you're the killer, are you not supposed to go after someone if they've just been unhooked, even if they are the most likely target?
---
I’ve literally gotten that. Like people have thought they outplayed me and that I didn’t intend to give them the hatch and I’m just like
---
Mmhmm. Should’ve hooked ya
---
Not reportable but it is a premium dick move. If it makes you feel any better they got practically nothing from it and you get to move on from a shitty killer quicker.
---
Yeah made my day that's for sure haha was my first time playing legion as well so felt pretty good to get a toxic message first game
---
Gotta proxy too, even non-SWF survivors will show each other where the totem is in case you tunnel, ideally you have to catch the fresh unhook, but you also have to keep the hook outside your TR.
---
Though if I can catch the rescuer on the way and down them before they unhook, I will usually let the survivor who saw Ruin go.
---
Survivor A is hooked, Survivor B is caught going for the save and hooked, Survivor C unhooked Survivor A, catch Survivor C.
---
It's still soft-camping but if you can get two for one, it's usually worth losing a totem over.
---
Might have to yoink your flair
---
I think it would be better if the door spawns were fixed as a solution. Spawning at least a certain distance from each other because I've had a lot of games where the doors were right next to each other which is kind of wacky but I don't think the hatch needs to change.
---
It's already a pubstomp perk. Do you just want Survivors under green to lose every match forever?
---
NOT STONKS
---
The line "you were seen by over 97462 people" is funny enough as it is, it's such an oddly specific number but then he adds the "over" at the beginning. Was he trying to say you were *actually* being watched by 97463 people that he totally has watching his nonexistent stream? Man all the DBD streamers better watch out for this dude pulling in 97k concurrent viewers, on YouTube no less.
---
I've had like five different people message me for the same reason though, they think slugging is reportable and they all say shit like "enjoy your ban, I'm sending this directly to the devs"
---
Entity will always create an odd number of things and stick you with the fog offering.
---
But if Killers are waiting a long time, and Survivors are waiting a long time...
---
...then who was phone?
---
Lots of issues happening yesterday and today. Twitter was wild last night, people are mad. I spent 3 hours on the game, only played 2 matches. Rest of the time was spent in the lobby, due to a lot of people wanting to play the killer.
---
I see those cosmetics are finally paying off.
---
it really shouldn't be
---
100
---
I recommend trying to play again with them after Monday, if possible. Hopefully it will be worked on!
---
Ghostface above Myers *shocked pikachu face*
---
I do get why you feel this way. Playing against killer who do this is most certainly not a fun experience. But punishing players who play a certain way seems unnecessary. If this would be the case and we punish tunnelers, why not go ahead and punish players that make killer games unfun? If we start punishing certain playstyles it would be a matter of time before we cant play the game without following strict rules. The only thing that should be punished should be hackers or cheaters(people who exploit glitches) and not players because they play a way that is unfun for players.
---
At Green rank and above it's found within 2 minutes more than 90% of the time
---
The illusion has been ruined! (Lol)
---
Spirit would've known Steve was in the locker due to him being injured regardless, I'm assuming that's why she doubled back.
---
Like I'll let people go if they've been genuinely snitched on, but if I was going to find them anyway, aren't they still mine?
---
Steve would've been caught here without the pointing, ergo one shouldn't let Steve go.

oh
---
Legion is pretty bad with no add ons but leatherface should be in Z tier
---

---
This says it perfectly
---
This is happening constantly on Xbox but I found a way that prevents you from having to totally restart the game. If you go into the cosmetics tab for your current survivor that's selected, and then go to the store, it cancels your matchmaking and you can try to do it again.
---
pretty much, but you get two of the best killers in the game to start with, so
---
Newer player here. Just tried playing as her and I'm pretty sure I looked like a drunk...just blinking into walls and completely missing the survivors lol.
---
This is a repost
---
Or maybe a lot of people aren’t a total shitbag like you?
---
“I miss the part where that’s my problem”
---
Yeaaahhh, you’re the host, so that’s you’re internet lol
---
haha me play spirit me have big brain why people dc me play most fun killer that takes biggest brain to play haha why surbibor die on 1st hook
---
Well if you dont want to play enough to unlock the characters, you could buy them...
---
Same deal with legion, I only get smoking splinters and fucking pudding
---
i find them all boring tho...
---
This is happening a lot now during the 2x bloodpoints.
---
Touché
---
I started playing her yesterday after a couple of months. I was playing on a new account so I didn’t get sweats and I’ve learned so much of how to blink around loops and get really good map pressure and hits with her. It takes some practice and a lot of tracking perks. I’ve actually started playing in my main account which is around rank 8 killer and I’ve been able to keep up with survs
---
what if there was a camera there and we could see the moment he blew his head off while all drunk
---
thinking about it is thrilling
---
"daddy what was that loud noise? DADDY!!!"
---
Ok
---
It's not an exploit. The prerequisite of the stab is there for a reason. If it was intended to kill you through lockers, it would be designed as such. Considering it's also the only form of legitimate counterplay, as pallets aren't reliable as teammates may have already thrown them down
---
You could buy the new killers with actual money?
---
I hate killer mains
---
Whatre you looking for in a killer? Maybe just spend money on someone you like and play them a lot?
---
Nah, I'm allowed to have a flair without sounding like a biased whiner for either side
---
Buy them
---
U can use real money to buy the other ones
---
Personally, I'd swap off monitor. If you have silent phasing your terror radius won't matter. You could slap pop in that slot, so you have that and ruin on the same build.
---
* Screenshots highlighting unbalanced matchmaking (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
No reason I guess
---
thats what you think, but if michael gets power from sucking evil out of something to make himself more evil, if he stalked the entity hed go into tier 4 and then shit would hit the fucking fan
---
I feel like you shouldnt rely on 360s because basically only new players fall for it. If youre on console probably just crank up your sensitivity until you reach a speed youre consistent with.
---
Idk I guess it’s for ppl who can’t get kills idk
---
He’s not even going to get the iri the time you’re alive has to also exceed 540 seconds
---
**New map:** kino der toten  
---
**New survivor:** Edward Richtofen  
---
**New killer:** Panzer Soldat
---
I find it's hard to get close enough to gens without survivors leaving them when I don't have monitor.
---
Although you go really fast with the ring, you can't go quite as far as you think.
---
A quite unique specimen in the sense that they’re so dark and so terrified of helping other survivors, that they can hardly ever seen except when healing themselves in corners and tea bagging at the exit gates
---
Because I was bored
---
i love how at the end when you YEET it sounds like you're tring to be quiet and not wake up your parents lol great clip btw JUSTICE
---
43
---
As a player who plays both killer and survivor, I understand the need to mori more than one person, but I believe that mori-ing right after one unhook is bad for all involved. Killer said you get less bp and survivor side, you basically get no chance to escape. I personally that they should change it to two hook minimum to allow both sides to get more bloodpoints, but sometimes survivors are really toxic and just need to get moried. On a side note moris should be illegal during blood hunt!!
---
if killers have ruin, all survivors should have small game.
---
at the higher end survivors all use cooperative perks at max rank, items,  and communicate over voice chat. of course it's skewed at the higher end. this is indisputible. at medium and low it's killer skewed.
---
Can play to earn or purchase them.
---
That's true, but I still think you'd be fine without it. Most survivors will keep working on the gen if they only hear the terror radius briefly without seeing you.
---
The higher level you are the more you get from leveling up
---
watch out every body, we got a bad ass
---
Go to Help and Tutorials, then to Contact Customer Support, and then Submit a Ticket
---
A lot of people do this. A small but noticeable amount of Killers gain pleasure out of making the lives of others miserable. Just move on. Don't say anything in post-game chat as they feed off it and post screenshots of the game here to show off.
---
Don't focus on 360s since they barely work, do what I do (and I'm sure what many others do), lean left, then quickly go to the right or vice versa.
---
I can take a lot of bs, but it is unfun when I have people twice my rank pubstomping and teabagging telling me how bad I am in 1/4 games I play.
---
I only know how to do it on PS4. If you're on PS4, go to settings&gt; account settings&gt; restore licenses
---
That sword one taps and instantly mori's any survivor in it's path
---
Oh shit, i just saw you're on xbox. My bad
---
Wow very original you must be writing a book with those levels of creativity
---
Bald by Daylight had me in stitches. 
---
Fixed the shitty hairs, Devs!
---
This rank 8 life is starting to hurt m8.    Thanks for the advice!
---
I haven't played against one yet. Just picked the game back up after a year being gone! I am excited. Just had Freddy and I had no idea what to do lol.
---
I run BBQ, Ruin, Noed an bitter mur murs 
---
Bitter helps if you get stuck an cant find anyone an they pop a gen then its jus a chain reaction after that cause after you hook them then bbq pops an you see more people an noed plus bitter helps because 7 seconds of seein auras after gens are completed can help in some situations.
---
lol when they start tbagging I DC
---
121  
---
TY!!
---
Naw, survivors need to die
---
If you rotate your camera don’t whine when a Myers “pops out of nowhere and gets an automatic free down”.
---
I didn’t say survivors are bad if they go down a single time. Most do. If you ran the killer around long enough, good. The killer made a mistake in chasing you for so long and they’re going to pay for it. Killers cannot afford to waste time in this game.
---
I’m saying if you play better you have all the tools you need at your disposal not to go down. Don’t get caught in the open. Thats largely going to be your own fault. There are plenty of safe and reasonable distances between loops and vaults if you play them correctly.
---
I'll try it out.
---
If I were to leave monitor though, what would you recommend?
---
Still, an impressive set of balls to make enemies of demons from hell.
---
why?
---
If you go after the person who was just on the hook, they won't have any fun. That's why you go after the guy performing the unhook. Also, you get more points going after the unhooker because the game will last longer (most likely).
---
Man, dbd got me hooked
---
SWF?
---
Eh, lullaby is pretty decent if your running an impossible skill check build
---
Kate is one of the quietest survivors so if you wanna play stealth go with her. Adam has deliverence tho
---
The pallets in the corner of the stairs are not safe
---
REEEEEEE
---
fuck your pun and take my upvote
---
So, returned for the bloodhunt and promptly uninstalled again... when are we going to start banning people for dcs?
---
There is a need, the gens arent all done therefore they need to be done.
---
It can spawn with five gens left and 1 person .
---
I always try to work on gens if it's the survivors first hook. I don't understand why people immediately try to get off and force themselves into struggle when the team is trying to get a good portion of the objective done.
---
Dude... Her ability is making you a 1 shot down. You are basically exposed the entire match.
---
That's a solid two minutes of time it bought you, then. What really fucks it up is if it gets found within the first few seconds and it wastes a perk slot.
---
I see nothing wrong here tbh
---
so u wanna be a Widdle Console Boi or Girl eh??
---
well u best get in shape Kiddo, if u want to pass the Daddys Test
---
pump up them pecs
---
pump em up
---
I've used the bloodhunt to level my ace and since i started at zero i used plunderers instinct + ace in the hole.
---
I thought it would be decent, but i'm surprised what i pull out of the boxes more often than not.
---
Multible medkits with instaheals and toolboxes that last the whole game.
---
Still feels odd to use 2 perk slots, but i feel the items helped me more than other perks would have.
---
173
---
Emem wen a sa siht tnaw I
---
As long as I don't go struggle phase before being pulled off please keep working on gens
---
Quick and Quiet, Lithe, and Dance with Me is referred to the Houdini Build.
---
Doesn't pharmacy just give you guaranteed green medkit? Seems like it would be counter-productive to getting rarer items since your first chest will always be a green medkit.  Plunderers and ace though is definitely a good pairing to farm some items.

every time I try to play nice as killer during BP events i get 2-4 insta heals and gen rushing immersed gamers.  not to mention if I mind game someone they rage quit. I'm pretty much done trying to but nice to the survivors unless they go out of their way to make it clear to me that they're not boring cunts
---
You get 25.3k shards for 100 levels
---
Welp I guess that I know who’s comment I’m downvoting
---
I mean you kick them either way because of surveillance.
---
Why did he step back and not hit him
---
Yeah eventually but there was 2 survivers doing that gen, 1 could of easily came to help me.
---
Ah, thank you.
---
I love using that combo! I haven't been lucky enough to get quick and quiet in my bloodweb since I got the teachable but the lithe + dance with me is a favorite of mine.
---
You’re spamming story problems, but instead of Fred and Watermelons, you’re subbing it for Killer and Survival. You’re the one spamming and you think memes are annoying
---
Had this been a Hag I would have been sure this was me.
---
well thank for trying to help
---
True, I wasn't really thinking about that. Fun fact btw, the new demogorgon perk Surge can actually activate surveillance on any gen in damages.
---
Bought him and he's level 30 already. Pretty good overall
---
Most recent update that added Demogorgon has made the game crash a lot more frequently for some players. I wouldn't take any DCs too personally until the next patch comes through, the game's unstable for most players right now
---
You knew what you were doing. Its a common dumb survivor trick that shouldn't exist.
---
Some of the DLC killers are only like five bucks. If you’re too young to have a job ask your parents to do some chores around the house and actually do them and then pay for the ones you want.
---
very imbarassing
---
I get that but 2 of them were doing the gen, 1 of them could of stayed and continued whilst the other came and helped me.
---
Idk what a churl is, but  I know that guys one and I don’t want to be one.
---
I mean isn't this kinda hypocritical?
---
You're trying to take the moral high ground while brigading a user...
---
I literally explained that to another guy
---
I thought so too. Until I woke up one day and decided to become a Jeff main.
---
Do you think surge would be better then?
---
Dude wants to trash talk but can't even spell lmao
---
This is why I always go for maximum altruism in the end of games.
---
I actually got a Meg who was being camped by a Nurse off the hook at like half endgame timer once. The Nurse blinked behind a wall, poor sod. All four of us got out and me and the Meg had a laugh about the save after.
---
Rip Nurse.
---
Annoyingly though, both my teammates just straight up left without giving a toss about helping while I ran off.
---
Im actually happy to see a good looper. Once i realize i observe what they do to get better at my own survivor plays
---
&gt; then they'll happily want to farm as opposed to death
---
This is what i always do. 2 hook everyone and then farm :) I have no desire for "winning", i just want P3-50 everyone with all perks. So all i want is BP &amp; "winning" does not equal max BP.
---
Although, i have not played during the event since i knew what a shitshow it always is. No thanks.
---
I have a bad case of the needle farts right now
---
i was a pig with bbq/make your choice/surv/iron grasp
---
survivor pudding and combat straps/face mask add on
---
i barely play killer but damn people are toxic
---
It's a team based game you're supposed to work together. There were 2 people doing that gen, 1 could of came to help me.
---
5*
---
These are the biggest, try-hard, CS, toxic killers I have encountered in the 6-7 months I have been playing.
---
It's definitely an option, but I don't think it will slow the game down enough on it's own without like ruin / lullaby to back it up. Some maps are too large to make great use of surge, so it's semi-situational. I just thought it was interesting to note that it works with surveillance.
---
Yeah, nice, glad you’re enjoying him
---
I’m level 45 Ace rn with Rank 1 Ace in the Hole, and Rank 2 Up The Ante and Open Handed. The game doesn’t respect who you are and kinda just gives garbage when you’re really hoping for good perks.
---
If you REALLY want to invest time and main that killer, go for it. Unless you are at low ranks, I suggest either 
---
A) Grind to 1 million BP to make losing everything less painful
---
B) Wait until Rank Reset, so you aren't getting destroyed when you only have the killers 3 teachables
---
And of course, don't forget to use all of your addons and offerings. Right before I prestige is the time for maximum toxicity. Use those UR addons and Ebony moris.
---
Dont
---
If they get you off the hook before struggle phase then they managed their time correctly.
---
I personally sit back and give them a couple free gens when a DC pops up at the start.
---
Definitely Joe.
---
I still occasionally scream when I don't know the killer and Myers pops out of nowhere
---
It's almost baffling that killers don't understand the simple concept of risk. If you take the *very* powerful perk, there's a *risk* it won't be in a location you don't like.   
---
Get. Over. It.   
---
Or better yet, stop relying on powerful passive perks to win the game for you. \*gasp\*
---
Or they could get the gen done almost twice as fast. If they got you before your struggle phase they did the right thing.
---
Btw, it's Friday the 13th on GWG next month, not Dead by Daylight.
---
Think of it as built in self care and the quieter chest search time and increase chest search speed makes it well worth it for any looter build
---
This is high art, it would be a shame if it were an only child.
---
Are you telling me that that isn't my beautiful boy?
---
I've had like the exact opposite problem. I've had one single group of farming survivors in about 20 games now.
---
that makes no sense. Pennywise getting teased/released anytime soon wouldnt make any sense at all. im not saying i dont believe you but i cant really see what video theyd make lol
---
4 months ago I would have scoffed at any minecraft  joke on this sub. Now, I think this is the best quality meme I've seen here
---
I don't have these issues that much at purple rank except the totem thing which is every 3 games or so but I mean I guess you could deliberately derank idk?
---
It is a normal killer tactic, one that is punished by rushing generators and leaving the hooked survivor to suffer
---
Ye
---
It is not reportable
---
Partially due to constantly broken match making and partially due to less and less people wanting to play Survivor. I remember back in the bad old days killers would always tote out the 'this game needs us killers!' complaint whenever asking for balance changes or nerfs to survivors, and well, apparently it also needed survivors.
---
Often a shortage of killers between updates on PS4 tho.
---
Ha nice repost idjit
---
Xbox. I even played a game with the perks so it had more than enough time to save them.
---
Why would he run back in regardless? He disrespected your kindness.
---
Lmao thirsty for a 4K? I don’t main either side so I know that that’s exactly what the killer’s goal should be.
---
And anyways, maybe he wanted the adept Demogorgon, which is a giant pain in the ass. Don’t blame the player hate the game
---
I recently went against a myers with an Evil Within 1 build. Dude just walked around and grabbed people off gens cause he had 0 terror radius, it was rad af.
---
medium pallet vaults don't exist I doubt they'd add them just for clown when clown already does good at pallets
---
Same. I have nothing to use shards on.
---
25
---
I’m noticing a pattern though. Bloodhunts (almost) always happen when the game’s in a buggy state. I’m pretty sure it’s more of a “hey, we’re sorry it’s pretty buggy, take double bp as an apology?” Thing. So extending it would be nice, but not owed seeing as the event in general is a nice bonus.
---
Dbd has a good amount of audio bugs. That isnt uncommon, it has a good amount of bugs in general.
---
Don’t you fucking give them ideas she’s been hurt enough.
---
Best experiences in order: SwF&gt;killer&gt;solo q
---
I woulda ran after the first miss, then wait for him to lose me and go back
---
I just never go to the gate because the desynced endgame timer will most likely catch a few idiots who want to tbag me
---
oh alright, I just misunderstood, sorry.
---
When I play killer during dbl BP I try so hard to be nice. If I know I'm gonna win, I just farm. 
---
When I play survivor during dbl BP, every killer is so sweaty and they all fucking tunnel
---
Unite for bp
---
Maybe it´s because of Bloodhunt, idk...but most of my matches have been pretty terrible.
---
To be honest I feel like other than the satisfaction of knowing you've reached high ranks theres literally no reason to be there, it's just all the best perks every game for both sides and no chance to do any fun builds, not to mention wait times are horrendous.
---
It doesn’t take much to rank up. It’s literally just a problem of reaching the incredibly low skill ceiling.
---
I'm not sure you have? No rework was mentioned here, just addon updates and minor tweaks.
---
Ah yes, the mythical survivor rulebook.
---
To them it probably looked like you struggled all game and were face camping out of desperation for a single kill and you couldn't even manage that.
---
ah makes sense
---
Most people dont have a lot of streamers and stuff saved up. They use them the moment they get them.
---
Why you complaining about survivors at high ranks running all meta builds as if killers don't run the same 5-6 perks themselves.
---
Have you played with him alot?
---
Tell me why when I saw this title of this post I thought of exactly what happened in the video...
---
I wasn't "whining" about anything.  I was defending myself when you absurdly questioned my skill level all for disputing your ridiculously ignorant claim that it's a survivors fault for going down once and if they really are good they have the tools to not get downed a single time.  This isn't a reasonable statement.  You're entitled to your opinion but it is objectively a silly one and you'd be hard pressed to find people that will agree with you on it.
---
Holy moly. I understand the concept of how it can be the survivors fault, im not saying its always the killers fault like some killers are saying in this thread that survivors are always to blame. I was talking about a specific instance where all survivors DC because of horrible lag from host. did i say every single time someone has connection errors it's the hosts fault? No, if i did i would have said that. I specifically said, and i fucking quote so you guys stop twisting words "why play host when your internet is trash... It takes 3 seconds before a vaulting animation happens." When not one, not two, but four survivors have the same issue, it's not one "whaaa whaaa" survivor, it's that some dick with .5kb of upload and 2mb of download speed hosting the fucking game.
---
Look up what conditional probability is... I can see that you don't understand it even after I explained it.
---
The reason it's over 100% is because your probability of escaping and being seen is higher than just being seen...
---
Look up what conditional probability is.
---
here are my galaxy powers and action! (NOTE: the middle one on the bottom row is the action icon you get when picking up a survivor! you put this icon in the "action" folder). hope you enjoy them! &lt;3

---
Every 8 seconds he gets a bottle? No, that’s bullshit lol. A good Clown will make sure you’re intoxicated so this just makes for braindead M1 spam and free downs, very little counterplay unless you make his movement speed while throwing a bottle very slowed and the cooldown after thrown also longer
---
Okay I'll stop, to show you I'm grateful I'll body block the p3 Claudette's from exiting :)
---
I think it's a bug. Sometimes I'm moaning even if I run Tier 3 Iron Will, which shouldn't happen then. I noticed it began with the 3.2.0 update.
---
Hey OP just wanna day don’t crawl at the killer if you have DS crawl away it has a much better chance of working. Or hide in a locker and there forced to either wast time in front of it, walk away or grab you out and then just hit the skill check. Hope this helps &lt;3

I used to run bond instead of better together but I like seeing all the auras when somebody goes down and the fact it brings them to me not the other way. Then once we like 99 a gen I get them to heal me, people usually understand.
---
Definitely headphones. Sound is extremely important with her. 
---
Try to use your phase as often as you can. It is great for getting around the map, but try to practice using it mid-chase. Once you practice mind-gaming with the survivors in a chase, that’s where she really shines. Don’t be afraid to come out of phasing early if you know you aren’t on the right track, so you can readjust yourself and get a full meter faster. 
---
My favorite general add-ons are the haunting duration and speed ones. Prayer beads are a lot of fun, yes, and are most survivors’ worst nightmare. Don’t feel like you can never use them. But try to be fair and give the survivors a little slack. PB Spirit is probably one of the top 3 worst things to go against. 
---
I mix up her Perks a lot and she is great with a lot of different builds. BBQ is probably my only real staple, but I’ll run Discordance, PGTW, Whispers or Stridor, etc. 
---
I also have been running Infectious Fright, Surge, and Surveillance. Takes a lot of slots but I find it really fun. Combined with BBQ, I can almost always chain my downs and spend a little less time at gens. 
---
One thing I like to do... sometimes if I see a survivor, I will turn away and start phasing. Once the phase is charged, then I’ll turn around and go for them. Often times if they see my husk facing another way, they assume I’m going that way. Just hold that direction til it’s fully charged, and you’re good. If you rotate back before fully charging, they will see your husk rotate as well.
---
his skillcap is unattainable, try playing him at high purple/red ranks, you'll see what I'm talking about. 
---
Unlike the nurse where it's mostly muscle memory and predictions, the doctor has to deal with lack of pressure, shock delay, praying that survivors make mistakes and most of all, timing his shocks to the millisecond to be able to get a hit afterwards. As you may already know this, not everyone is a computer and plays like a robot. At low/mid ranks, survivors make mistakes, which are used by the doctor to get a hit or two. but at high rank play, unless survivors royally fuck up, there's nothing you can do against a good looping survivor. Watch what Tru3ta1ent, NotOtzdarva and many other people have to say about him... Many things need change in his kit.
---
That's my problem: I **don't** want to run those perks. I don't want to run BBQ, Ruin, Nurses and whatnot every single game, because I want to try out some more interesting combinations with other killers.
---
But I can't, because whenever I do that I get bullied.
---
I do both
---
thats so lame. so many licensed chapters and we already have a clown who is in desperate need of a rework. Rework freddy made clown even more obsolete than he already was. 
---
honestly tired of the licensed chapters
---
I can agree with that tbh.
---
I know what conditional probability is.  I also know that your question doesn't work *because* of that.  You can't have a higher probability of being seen AND escaping compared to just being seen.
---
I don't even WANT to be there. I couldn't care less about rank. If there was a casual mode I would play it in a heartbeat. I just happen to be in purples because I naturally ranked up...it's a really terrible system.
---
The new Ash and Feng Min skins got leaked pretty recently
---
Why would they need to mention it, there is no reason to do it beyond griefing.
---
Had this happen the other day me and my buddy recorded the whole thing and we both sent our videos to behavior they were pretty interested. Did you record it otherwise I dont know if much can be done
---
Its something people are actually coordinating atm because of the event. You COULD report them, or you could take advantage of the occasion and know what you experienced was in no way unique atm.
---
let's call it an update then ;)
---
Don't you think it's a dangerous precedent to add things to their ban list without making a community update? I'm not saying it shouldn't be. I just think they should maybe update their list.
---
I can relate. A guy I played against got really mad after I got a 4K with a mori, said I was tunneling after they unhook the second I hook them without borrowed. He then proceeded to send death threats and I wished him a nice rest of his day.
---
I'm on pc and it looses my save all the time.
---
They do exist......there's 3 types of vaulting
---
It's hilarious when it's one little claudette. When it's a whole team of baby survivors I wanna rip my hair out.
---
I would understand if the gen was half way or more done but they literally started that gen 10 seconds after I got hooked.
---
I'd like to assume the dream demons are powerless against the Entity considering they don't have influence over Freddy Krueger's actions so any influence that comes in from the physical world outside the dream world is beyond the dream demons. Regardless I don't believe the dream demons would care as it wouldn't be the first time they left Freddy, they would most likely find another host and easily.
---
What servers lol
---
You're trying to kill us. Outside of face camping most things are fine in my book.
---
And 4 gens are already done
---
not gonna lie, when it comes to toxicity, this game takes takes the cake. Seriously, League is fucking nothing compared to what this community is capable of. If you want to enjoy this game, just play whatever and however you want and never say a single word in post game chat.
---
That's when I tried to hit upvote a second time.
---
And then you realise killer ques are a mess because of bloodhunt. Time to play civilisation.
---
Am i missing something? There's the slow vault with only space, and then the fast vault with space and shift. Only windows have 3 types of vaulting.
---
Nah man, I totally get you, and I don’t hold it against anyone who doesn’t have any, or are using characters they haven’t earned them on yet. 
---
I think my frustration is more directed at the veterans who I know probably have them, but burn their 50 cakes/puddings instead. 
---
I think I’m realizing more and more that I should just use them right away and stop saving them for these events. All it does is make me resentful lol.
---
I was just curious if it felt worse than normal this time around to anyone else. It’s not my first Bloodhunt by a long shot but this one feels more sodium-rich than normal. 😂
---
Looks more like a mimic from darksouls. 
---
(And no, I dont belive thos joke has been made)
---
Lots of people trying to be killers not enough survivors
---
Boooo
---
How in the hell did you do the achievement to pull someone off a gen with the Nurse after multiple blinks
---
What?! Impossible!
---
If you get bullied and lose then you might derank?
---
So I see you have some sort of disability then
---
Calm down son, it’s just a picture
---
I think you might have displeased the entity, my dude.
---
yes, I agree. it is a team based game. however, if they got you before you struggled on first hook, then I don't understand why you'd be upset. it's rare that I am lucky enough to have a team that actually does gens.
---
Slugging for the 4k or situational slugging isn't bannable. I think the most constructive comment you got was "if you see them both you know you're gonna go for the random". Of course it's bannable because 1) the game instantly becomes 1v3 which is not balanced, 2) you give a person extra points and pips and 3) even though you are not on comms it's still a situation you both benefit from by not playing the game as it's supposed to and it is "working with the killer" since you know who's gonna die and who's not. I hope you stopped doing it.
---
Becaus no one likes to be survivor during the bloodhunt
---
yes, we should, the two things are quite different, and Behaviour tends to be VERY specific when it comes to those.
---
It's not holding the game hostage because eventually the slugged person will bleed out.
---
Lmao maybe RUIN is a powerful perk at rank 13-20 
---
but once you know how to hit great skill check is just worthless even if you dont hit every great skill check it will still get completed
---
Deranking is not the problem. The problem is that those games are unfun AF.
---
And even if I derank, I might win a few more games later on and get into the same situation.
---
If you prestige without getting teachables you have to get back to that level to get it again
---
Yeah, I bought him on release, he’s my favourite to play as.
---
Isnt the first pic SWF?!?!
---
Just enjoy the game people are gonna say they report you or spam you with messages post game no matter what. They are just angry
---
You get unlimited bloodwebs at 50. So if you unlock a new teachable you just have to finish your current bloodweb and will get the new perks on your next bloodweb
---
I'm guessing it may be related to the connection pretty sure legion can't blink haha
---
What are the best perks for him?
---
indeed they are, let's hope his update won't be as bad as the wraith's.
---
Yeah I love spending 5 hours playing dbd and getting in 4 matches. It's great.
---
I want an original killer, please.
---
I have the same problems as you, hope they fix it soon (Ps4)
---
Your guaranteed to get the teachable perks at level 30, 35 and 40 and they continue to appear on bloodweb untill you unlock them
---
I've learned to stop being generous to survivors. Was learning GF earlier, on like my 2nd game of him ever and used a BPS and got 3 insta heals on cowshed (which they fucking humped the window obviously) in return. Now I just use personal bp offerings during events and use bps when I play with someone I know.
---
This. I love playing Ghostface but his detection range is so inconsistent it drives me off from playing him at times.
---
People will be salty/toxic even if you follow the unwritten rules of survivors. Just don't be a dick and play how YOU want to. If someone gets mad, just move onto the next game!
---
Doing it 2 or 3 times is probably fine, I heard Hexy did a very excessive amount of spamming.
---
Right? Especially during double bloodpoints. Unless the survivor was BMing me.
---
I wish that would happen to killers i play against.  Instead its mostly start gen, find out ruin exists, try to power through it, fuck up one check, get found first, get hooked, notice 2 people workibg on a gen, get un hooked, run to the 2 gen squad, notice they are right next to ruin and dont even notice it
---
It’s cause the gen is finished but it still says 5 gens left so they would have to do 6 in total
---
2 people DC on him and you shake your head when you down him.
---
I’m toxic and I was hyped I got there in time
---
Hey sometimes you just gotta stomp on people as clown a couple dozen times.
---
Sorry, I should’ve been clearer. I mean, what if you fully prestige a characters, before you unlock another characters teachables.
---
I’m perfectly aware
---
I personally don't want Pennywise as a killer in dbd cause while he's interesting and fun, we already have a clown. And I don't want to hear about how Pennywise is actually an alien and all that jazz, I've read the book and seen all the movies I know all about him, I just think another clown will be boring
---
I just don't want to get taunted at the end. I did everything survivors said I was supposed to do and I still got taunted. I think they are just toxic because that is what they are and not because of anything I am doing. I tunneled and got the 4k next game so I think I learned my lesson. To them, bullying a killer at the end is just part of the experience and why they bought the game. The game is basically marketed as bully a killer simulator after all.
---
Will do for now on.
---
Well yeah the fact you can’t see it is the issue lol. It wouldn’t surprise me if they release him soon(ish)
---
I think you are talking about Mac milian estate
---
Apparently you did all this today
---
The feeling of a 4K after not even landing a hit until the last gen is the best feeling
---
Lol I meant on the games end
---
Also to add he was running ruin, surge, remember me, and fired up
---
Apologies if I sound rude while talking about you. I simply shared my perspective and hearing yours helps me understand more.
---
While I agree with your sentiment, the counter to Ruin is Stake Out.
---
Wait they were actually interested? I have videos
---
Steams up now
---
So is your mom
---
what's sandbagging?
---
i downloaded last week please forgive my ignorance.
---
Survivors have keys though which are equally cheese.  You willing to remove keys from the game if it meant ebony's would be gone too?
---
I mean, you were camping though right? I'm not saying you did anything wrong necessarily to try and secure a kill, but for somebody who says they followed every rule, it sounds like you broke the biggest one of all.
---
Also you need to turn off chat if you can't handle it, I'm not saying this as an insult but you seem pretty thin skinned.
---
OP commented that the Bill actually did have the timer glitch. Looks like killers can see what the real time is but survivors don’t always
---
Great Value Lament Configuration
---
As a killer main, what is the point of closings hatches? For any competent survivor it just becomes a free escape.
---
Poor Bill :(
---
The Entity was displeased because you failed to save him (Even tho he prob had the timer glitch)
---
Think you were the only one who actually understood the question lol
---
I completely understand your frustration. Because he didn't want to kill me I assumed he would treat you the same. It was when I kept dodging his attacks and then he just kept staring at me that I thought he decided he would be nice and want to farm
---
They don't need to give you anything. It falls under their rules, just don't be a dick and play the game. It's not hard.
---
Where they least expect. nice
---
13
---
Ohhhh good to know, thanks! I’m gonna check my switch when I can and see
---
I dont know why people downvotes those who correct grammar :/
---
I like how you said "feature". Thanks for this improvement bhvr!
---
🙄
---
Hey i am Jeff main, big boy is the best
---
Um..... 38?
---
I'm a Claudette but I'm the type to be seen :)
---
Colored? It’s just black.
---
How do the obsession perks work? I couldn't understand them. How do I know which survivor I'm obsessed with?
---
I always feel like a POS teammate when someone is getting hooked or needs a body block at the end .... and Rancor is on me. Sorry buddy gotta go :(
---
Keys at least need either most or all of the gens done or multiple survivors dead. Keys are incredibly powerful but nowhere near a Mori imo.
---
Also keys have multiple uses don't take away my shitty meme aura reading keys :(
---
Apparently. The Bill said he saw it still halfway full at least
---
Also would I have to buy the cannibal just to get BBQ and Chili?
---
This happened as well with a 3 man. 2 got into the lobby while the third was waiting in the invitation area. After about 15 seconds he eventually showed up, so i suggest not touching it and hoping they connect.
---
You also miss out on a lot of bloodpoints if you leave early tho
---
Whenever I get salty messages I just start talking to them about random shit like Jesus and the weather  until they realise I just don’t give a fuck about what they have to whinge about.
---
Was just about to ask the same question.
---
What say you, OP? I'd be down for removing ebonys so long as keys are removed.
---
THE SHADOW!? 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJjhtQiUzRY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJjhtQiUzRY) for reference
---
Their rule is no griefing but they've given very little to go off to describe what their list of griefing is. If anything they've said more about what isn't griefing.
---
Such as saying facecamping isbt griefing.
---
I think it's interesting that you're so offended at the prospect of wanting to be kept in the loop as to what the actual rules are.
---
that's why i exclusively play billy with speed limiter
---
Yikes short game. Sorry man
---
I think you need video proof. Idk for sure tho
---
