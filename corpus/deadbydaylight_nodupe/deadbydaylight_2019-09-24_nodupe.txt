No? You can be a rank 10 p3 ghost face. But idk if you know this rank 10 to 20 is a huge skill difference
---
---
---
When you're so dedicated to torture, you mutilate your own face and stick rods in your body so you won't rest. LOL  
---

---
Great picture btw
---
I don't get why they don't splurge a little to get the actors to just record some grunts. But no I gotta pay TEN DOLLARS FOR THE SCOOPS AHOY OUTFIT.
---
He did look like he did  it cause he was pissed cause he walked off afterwards
---
If its before the game realizes you left (BHVR servers) and he did it in a specific way then yes, you lose everything because the game can't do anything about it when you give one player the game server.
---
Dedicated servers were pushed back due to some problems but when it comes it should solve those issues but idk if they will release servers all over the world (I hope they use AWS for that since they've got great coverage)
---
You get the basic 3 killers, plus Nurse, Hag, Doctor, Huntress, Clown, Spirit all free of cost. 
---
Plague, Leigon, Ghostface and Pig are unlockable 
---
Ash the survivor is also unlockable.
---
Freddy, Myers, Leatherface, and Demi are yet to be known, but more than likely will be DLC a short while after release. Hope this helps!
---
We get maps for free because matchmaking would break even worse if they had to segregate players based on purchased DLC. Don't act like that's generosity.
---
What's the ranking system for if DbD isn't competitive? Because it's very clearly not for matchmaking, and if it were, the ranks wouldn't need to be visible.
---
Sure, you can be a tryhard and play meta without paying a second time, but if for any reason you don't want to main Nurse or want to experiment with builds, or just want DECENT BP income, paywall.
---
And that's assuming no new top meta shows up behind a paywall, which could absolutely happen. DS is already P2W.
---
&gt;Excuse me. WTF.
---
Upvoted just because of the meme.
---
It will be A L L THE WAY NOW!!!!
---
(Casually slaps on distressing)
---
HAHAHHHAAAHAHHAAHHAAHAHA
---
Yep, very weird.
---
The shack is a hard loop for some killers, but since you mentioned that you’re a huntress player, it should actually be pretty easy, if a survivor vaults a window, they’re locked in place for more than enough time for you to throw a hatchet, if you bait god pallet drop, they’re locked in the drop animation long enough for you to throw a hatchet, just practice learning when to throw hatchets and you’ll be fine
---
Huntress has a low movement speed compared to most other killers, so if you tried another killer you might find it easier to catch people at shack and other loops until you have more practice. The reason she's slower is because of her hatchets - they can make up the distance that you aren't able to.
---
Prove Thyself just helps you get max objective faster, doesn't actually let you get more than 8k.
---
Holy fuck this is the 5th time I’ve seen this shit this week
---
CHEATING!?
---
Doesn't matter, event BP and offerings aren't multiplicative.
---
Persona 5 lets go
---
Define OVERpowered, because I say it counts if the skill ceilings are hard to reach, but still give absolute advantages.
---
If only they had a separate game mode that allowed you to play with your friends with all perks unlocked.
---
Or if they had a tutorial mode that rewarded you with some bloodpoints to start off the game.
---
Or if there were hundreds of thousands of hours of videos/tutorials/commentary on how to play the game on a free platform.
---
Or if there was some sort of technology that would allow them to watch you play the game and/or allow you to communicate with them through the computer.
---
One day, the technology will be there - today is just not that day.
---
Stop... Get some help..
---
Well it’s also unfair for the killer who just bought the game and has to deal with toxic high ranker swf
---
No, I watched the streamer after the round because I never saw myself play as killer before.  I felt stupid when I saw myself walking past him like 3 times during chases because he was crouched in weird spots.
---
Derank your killer and play at 15 or so, the lowest I've gotten was 10 and the toxicity lvl is so high I can't be bothered to play against those fuckers. I mean i can camp and get 3 or 4k but that's boring as hell.
---
When I'm Ghostface: How did he reveal me so fast!?
---
When I'm the survivor: How am I not revealing him!?
---
Boy I sure like that we are forced at Entity-point to take a ton of offerings we'd rather be shot than actually use. What a great shop system.
---
#uwu
---
I agree, when you play with nice killers or survivors who make silly stuff, you forget it's supposed to be a scary game and it helps out a lot for people who can't really deal with horror. Honestly I really dislike the genre but still I manage to play dbd because I've had so much fun with silly stuff before it doesn't even bother me! ahahha
---
I'll try to get some friends to do that messing around too ahah! Thanks for the words and happy gaming to you too &lt;3
---
I mean is it really though? It's more so mutilation then decapitation or hell just make the demogorgon rip only a little bit of flesh off just something
---
*cries*
---
 [Counterpoint summarized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfYJsQAhl0)
---
Doctor is fun at low ranks, but there's no fun in a "fun build" at high ranks. Using your power is basically broadcasting your location to the entire map, so you're forced to use it as little and as sparingly as possible. It's great for tracking, or flushing out survivors, but that's about it.
---
I'd say go with your gut and pick Doctor, since it sounds like you're going to enjoy that more. Just remember that his Shock Therapy has travel time (which is how you play pallets and windows) and that his key milestones are when you first put someone into T1 Madness (ideally with Monitor &amp; Abuse *outside* of a chase, so that you're right on top of them) and when you put them into T3 Madness (which is when you'll start seeing their hallucinaatory Doctors). T2 Madness is not something you ever want survivors to be in.
---
I would definitely suggest Make Your Choice (presuming you don't have Haunted Ground, because no Spirit), Ruin, and Monitor &amp; Abuse as your key perks. Make Your Choice because it's next to impossible to hide from him and survivors will fear that, Ruin because he lacks pressure and needs time for T3 Madness, Monitor &amp; Abuse so that you can use Static Field and Shock Therapy outside of chase. 
---
Flex perk can be Brutal Strength for pallets while you learn Shock Therapy, Barbecue &amp; Chilli for Bloodpoints, Whispers so that you can track without having to use Treatment Mode, and so on.
---
Again, I really don't recomment trying to meme it out with a TR-and-skillchecks loadout. It won't intimidate high rank survivors, and it won't spook them either - it'll just give you a very boring game of chasing their ghosts while they run all over the map every time they hear you coming from the other side.
---
Yeah, I don't like that scenario, and your solution seems the most logical to me
---
*Looping him for three gens is both provoking him and the complete opposite of losing him*
---
#HEY MAN, YOU HERE FOR THE PHANTOM THIEVES MEETING?
---
Seems easy enough now.
---
Of course, if you'd rather have Survivors view in first person, it'd be necessary, but I can already hear the screeching at the concept.
---
The people I let out are generally
---
* Baby dweets
---
* People who give up in front of me as the last survivor
---
* Someone who made it to the endgame as the person who generally kept my interest, but who's team abandoned them 
---
* Anyone who gives me a good laugh
---
Oh yeah, it’s big brain time.
---
It would be cool but the freddy on DbD is from the remake
---
Theres a tutorial in the game bro, you get bloodpoints for completing it.
---
A note on Pig: in her official lore, it states that she perceives serving the Entity as the next step in a test by Kramer, and so she does it completely willingly and even refers to it as "her new master." It also calls out that she sees the survivors as nothing more than meat to be sent to the slaughter, much like how she perceived her victims in the SAW movies.
---
you're safe w me lil buddy
---
It should be optional. Almost every controversial feature should be optional. They should make more options.
---
Very lucky! Where do you get your copy?
---
Bc its gonna be dookie
---
I feel like Peanits actually hates the playerbase and just does his best to troll the forums.
---
Lag switch?
---
Ash's screams actually sound like he's hurt, though his downed screams are hilarious.
---
GET IT OUT! I COULD’NT STAND IT AFTER STEVE GOT HOOKED.
---
Oh my god, are you telling me that taking a hit resets the meter?
---
I never knew that, Jesus now I wish I had
---
i know but still
---
Join our DBD Nintendo switch discord https://discord.gg/2AS5yyw

That be a lag switcher
---
YOU mind game HIM lmao you run to the pallet, chances are he’ll go back thinking you’re gonna jump over it. But some killers don’t do that. I guess you’ll have to watch how the killer chases other survivors
---
Just saying, the game doesn't explicitly say anywhere, just Manchester. And I'm going on the assumption of the whole concept of when Greater Manchester was formed which is labelled as separate from Lancashire from what I know.
---
I fucking love The Game
---
Getting random errors connecting to server when starting game. Tried searching for match and got bored waiting. Played a few rounds of Tetris 99 and back now trying to find a match in dead by daylight. I will need more popcorn and pepsi.
---
Never jump pallets unless it’s the only way to avoid the killer until you e practiced looping
---
Wraith is almost fun because you can try nearly any weird buff and it'd be better than what we have now.
---
-Make an addon that REVERSES his bell's direction indicator.
---
-Let Wraith walk through pallets while cloaked.
---
-Let Wraith grab while cloaked.
---
-Make the full invis from standing still persist for a few seconds after moving, or even be resettable like the Cloak and Dagger in TF2.
---
Any of these or your suggestions would be improvement.
---
im kidding dude dw i done that too
---
Lack of map pressure makes for a low tier killer in most instances
---
It's just something that can happen when the killer disconnects from the match. I think I know why it happens, but it's impossible to test without knowing or asking the killer. If my theory is correct, it should be resolved when dedicated servers come out in the fall.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Prove_Thyself
---
Isn’t that ban able?
---
Yep, it fucking sucked and made me derank, but watching this one David being stuck on the ground for most of the game was pretty funny lmao
---
EB Games. Lucky? Don't get too excited. It's buggy connecting to servers when game loads up and so far haven't found a match.
---
If I was that leatherface, I'd think that was just you flexing on me.
---
I think i still have a screenshot with ace of the time this happened.  This is what the menu should look lile cause it looks awfully good
---
Yep, first time I’ve experienced one before🗿
---
I imagine in the background of every Demogorgon mori the Entity is going, “No. No..! Spit that out! Spit that out right now!”
---
Yeah seriously.  Why would you put in a decapitation just because it looks cool, and have it banned in several asian countries and a few middle eastern countries?
---
Shimmer in light and shortly after recloaking. Still audible and moves grass.
---
Oh my god that's dirty, I didn't realize what Autodiadact did, now I wish I had it haha, I'm assuming it doesn't proc off of self - care for balance reasons? 
---
Also when using Autodidact, does it completely remove the great skill check zone, or does it allow the zone to appear but does nothing?
---
Dam that is the worst lag switch I've ever seen haha hate how people exploit this.
---
I was always under the impression that Ace was a big con artist. 
---
If we really want to reach we can also say that Ash and Steve (Season 1 of Stranger Things) aren’t good people either.
---
[deleted]
---
*Tier 3 noises*
---
I even have a clip of me on the hook and the entire fucking screen glitching out and forced to me die 😟
---
I think R1 is put to a lot of good use, but I hope in the next patch sprinting and item use are also bound to R1.
---
lol relax
---
Oooooooh that makes sense ok thank you!
---
Servers aren't up yet I'm sure. Prolly gonna have to wait like us digital folks
---
I was playing at rank 16
---
The base game would also have to be free, or could the SCP just be a free DLC pack?
---
Oh, good to know. Sorry, didn't know it's get the game banned. I'm used to playing stuff like God of war and MK, so it seemed strange to me.
---
That's brutal, I had a trapper lag switching a few days ago... It bugged out so bad that when I was on the hook I was spectating the killer in third person as if I was still on his shoulder hahaha
---
Some actors cant voice act if their life depended on it
---
I just got a jake park daily just now
---
he has a beanie and jacket but thats it
---
Red rank premade with low rank for bully low rank killer ?
---
Just give more shards at reset for highest rank prior. There are already a lot of currencies.
---
If higher ranks are just bad people, I don't think many people will put up with that just for a new outfit.
---
# Or, OR:
---
both sides have terrible imbalances, the weight of which are impossible to calculate because of the incredible variety and asymmetry intrinsic to this game's design present in each individual match that, if attempted, would take years to analyze properly.
---
Too true. I just keep it simple and say gg after every match.
---
On top of, "Why the fuck do I not get to play as who I want?"
---
I can’t see why ranch would be a counter to spirit. I would take her to haddonfield. And balanced landing
---
Entity op plz nerf
---
Would explain a lot. Just searching for match........
---
I have practiced, I just don’t know what to do when this happens
---
Its not buggy, it isn't up yet...
---
When they running Sawdette build...
---
Would explain a lot and why I can't find a match :-)
---
Eh I saw some footage didn’t really look that bad
---
It’s best to not always be jumping back and forth across a pallet. What I tend to do is fake jump across by turning towards the pallet, then run the loop. Whenever he gets too close, it’s now your turn to mind game him and make a decision. Fake the pallet and see if he doubles back, or jump across and take the chance. It’s all about reading the killer and predicting what they’re gonna do based off their past action
---
Tho you can actually use balanced landing here. Come in from the pallet and drop straight into basement. Idk how useful it is buts its a thing
---
Had a killer who killed everyone without farming, like come on
---
Yeah I get why it would strange but its supposed to be black metal corpse paint and a lot of guys also paint their beards with it so it makes sense actually
---
I just did it unintentionally to a bill the other day. I was looping the killer near some lockers, decided it was "Head on" time since I use it along with quick and quiet, and was out of sight. But the Bill was inside, I got hit and he got hooked, I just couldn't stop laughing for a while.
---
Loved your video i would suggest watching youtubers like no0b3 and monto to learn this game
---
I mean, it was a bug that was caused by them copy and pasting Huntress' code for the Pig. It was like a ~3% increase in her speed while carrying Survivors, so it honestly isn't even that noticeable of a change.
---
Coop action in general\* but still doesn't get you higher than the 32k max
---
Lol you die. If this happens every time then you’re jumping to early, either bait the killer by running to a pallet and *not* jumping it or wait until there’s no chance the killer will circle also if the killer is on the shorter side of the loop don’t even try to loop just run.
---
Lightborn. Let them waste their time in futile attempts to blind you instead of doing objective. And Mori.
---
I could make a survivor for the chapter... lol
---
I feel like at the end of the day, assuming skill levels are about even and everyone is using meta perks (and a good killer) it mostly comes down to luck. What map it is, totem spawns, pallet spawns, the other side making bad plays, etc. 
---
That's why you should never go into a match expecting a certain result.
---
Trapper should spawn with base 2 traps and generate new ones over time.
---
Wraith could use MS, but almost any buff would make him better but not broken. This is a great opportunity to get bold. I'd like to see him retain full invis if he walks for less than, say, 4 seconds, meaning he can move in bursts to close in completely unseen, but slower.
---
Doctor should have sniper ON TOP of his AoE shock by default. Then he can both detect and disable Survivors with proper reading and timing.
---
Let Clown reload while carrying, but not hook while reloading. Encourage thinking ahead a bit.
---
Scrap Legion as-is and make a Multi-Killer mode based around them.
---
Make more doodles! :)
---
Well, it's in the handbook...
---
It is 60 seconds after unhook, not down.
---
Well fingers crossed then cuz ive missed out on 30k+ BP lol
---
Anyone below top movespeed has a really rough time in places like that. You just need to learn to read your target, or if it's looking too dire, leave and chase another.
---
Anybody know whereabouts the Demogorgon goes on the teir list and what's a good dlc killer to get (no other dlc characters) for someone who mains hillbilly mostly, I want to use a variety of killers.
---
More often than not, that’s what they want you to do, it gives their team more time to bang out gens uncontested
---
Shouldn't it average the killer rank?
---
We aren't 100% sure yet, since they haven't released them yet. From what they've talked about so far, it will add in some amount of extra lore, as well as unique challenges.
---
Then they cross beams
---
Then maybe we should start asking what's killing Michael so we can stop seeing it
---
How's the performance?
---
Honestly this is the first time I've seen this picture
---
No there was definitely more than one fucking chase.
---
I am new to the game and I keep getting groped with ranks 1s and 2s. Rank 17 killer. It sucks. 
---
Please elaborate on understanding the game? I would like to at least enjoy a match and not have it end I 5 minuets while I flair around looking for a team. It sucks...
---
Edit: spelling
---
High ranks, there are only four viable Killers and he's not on the list.
---
Lower ranks, he's just relatively dull with his power of "throw stuff." We have someone for that.
---
When you are outside of her 24 meter Terror radius, and she is phasing, you'll hear the whoosh sound. It isn't 3d, so it won't tell you direction or distance or anything, just that she is phasing near you. I'll double check what the sound emission distance is, but I believe it's ~16 to 24 meters or so.
---
Drug dealer that got framed for murder ends up dyeing to the electric chair, wakes up in the realm. He could be dressed in a prison jumpsuit and have cosmetics like “striped jumpsuit” where he wears a black mask and striped or “escaped con” where his top is rolled down with a tanktop that says “city of x penitentiary”
---
I’m sure there was, but are you positive the game realized a chase had started? (Chase music begins, survivor found score event)
---
No, I haven't been matched with Otz yet.
---
But I have seen mismatches of over 10 ranks more than once.
---
I was going to give someone hatch but they tried to get away so they where assigned hook Duty
---
This, plus I'd have to rebuy my DLC.
---
I'm already planning on buying Ash's new cosmetic. I don't want to buy it twice.
---
Yes, all of this, multiple times.
---
Are the archives going to be free?
---
Second time I’ve seen this same remark get upvoted. a good killer using nurse/billy/spirit will smack all survivors. No question about it, do we just disregard them as being killers? Orrrrr?
---
I don’t know if we’re thinking of the same type of mindgame, the ones where you’re on one side of the pallet the killer is on the other side and he goes near the side you’re on but he doubles back to his side to try to get you to vault so he can hit you,
---
Leather Face is by no means smart but he does have a far bit of intelligence in his own unique way, he was def tortured and my main evidence for this is in one of his addons The Beast's Marks  "jagged marks cover the Chainsaw's body, punishment from the dark beast that lives in The Fog. Memories of violent reprimands fill its holder with the fear of failure".
---
Servers not up yet. Error code is shown and a quick Google shows someone got the game on sept 19th and they can't connect.
---
It's not ACTUALLY that good, on the grounds that you should have things under control by the time/if they get the gates powered (although BHVR balances around 2Ks so they don't see the problem), but it's a massive boost in that phase unless a lot of time was taken to cleanse, so it's frowned upon as a crutch perk.
---
I don't feel bad for anyone rushing so hard they ignore bones, though. Just don't get USED to using it.
---
ONE stab is to cancel the scream.
---
Subsequent stabs mean they're a camping douchenozzle.
---
[removed]
---
*Laughs in Inner Strength*
---
Unrelated to the hotfix but i asked for a few posts now and i don't get an answer.
---
Where will the Scoring while chased be released?(33% progress on Gen, Totems)
---
Only when you’re injured
---
I don’t know any good perk ideas. I wanted them to be mature based. Something crow related. But idk
---
If you don't have Bubba, put him back on the list for BBQ &amp; Chili.
---
Doc, Clown, and Plague can all be bought with shards, so I'd say Pig just to be efficient with your money, but she's been nerfed into the ground and still going from the looks of it.
---
hotfix is tomorrow. should fix the problem along with other issues
---
Yeah start counting how long it takes for a killer to walk all the way around the pallet, it takes forever, staying on the other side is the safest you can be, don’t vault until he’s literally beside you. I don’t know what else to say.
---
I don't need to be able to bully killers. I just want to play with my friends. If they low ranks, thats not my or their fault. And just because they are low ranks, doesn't mean we can't play toghether. Blame Bhvr for making their stupid matchmaking to work the way it works - not us. If you see every swf as a bully squad, then you have a problem.
---
Thank fuck
---
I'm well aware of that (big black metal fan, hence I main Jeff) ...my issue is that since the last update, it's a very bright white. Like they messed the color up or something.
---
It smell like rank 15 in here
---
How to ID a troll team 101😂
---
I just smack anyone doing that, unless I have a good reason to like them.
---
From listening to a fair amount of high rank killers/streamers, most of them put the Demodog around the same tier as Huntress or Billy, so decently high tier.
---
We honestly don't know at the moment until they release more information.
---
That doesn't make her better, it makes her accessible.
---
Thank god lol my noob self was not prepared for this swf group
---
That shack isn’t the killer shack so there’s no basement,that’s why it spawned there
---
Spirit is very slow when she isn’t phasing
---
I got Billy on the game once...  I was just an m1 killer
---
Why use botony knowledge when you can use no mither? :))))
---
I love it know every match youll just have to play wraith(if its gonna be for different killers too)
---
You'd better feed yourself to the baby Killers each game, then. They have it hard enough.
---
I’m saying this as somebody who plays survivor for fun but for all intents and purposes is a killer main. The beads aren’t necessary to do well with Spirit, just a fun item to use, so not being able to stockpile them as easily wouldn’t hurt my feelings.
---
Thats not how it works. He was teasing you
---
STONKS
---
But honestly, they should toss in a fast and loose multi-Killer mode. At least a Killer/Survivor number setting in KYF. Add first, no rank impact, adjust after arrival.
---
What does that have to do with what they said lol. And anyway spirit is only 110% while not phasing, its not that bad.
---
spirt is crazy fast and doesnt need to uncloak
---
You know, I don't think it's the number of people playing that's the issue. I think their matchmaking system sucks and that's a whole other issue they need to sort out.
---
Dude probably thought your were being TOXIC
---
Well he should have stopped chasing me at that point and went for someone else that's his fault lmao sorry I'm surviving in a survival game 😂
---
Odd, sounds like your shit bugged
---
(rad) ah okay i can see it now, yeah not sure how the devs manage to make hair look like crap with each patch. I don’t play Jeff but now I can see the annoyance in that
---
That’s the community.
---
Back to rank 5 now as it’s the same red rank survivors almost every time
---
no 4 man teams then, since no SWF would take way to long to queue, just do a max of 3 swf able to queue up
---
What we REALLY need is a bot that reads our opponents' search histories and automatically spoils whatever they're watching.
---
Yup! An optimal SWFs team vs Ghostface can strategically trade aggro between the survivors to prevent him from ever actually getting his stalk off at a meaningful spacing, effectively turning him into a two-tap m1 killer. An optimal Ghostface won't actually take every opportunity for a hit given to him in order to preserve a survivor's meter. 
---
That being said, letting yourself stay in the injured state vs a stealth killer is a fundamentally bad idea. You don't want to take a hit if you don't have a reliable way to heal back up, either self care, a medkit, or bond to find other survivors. Plus, you're gonna want to assume Ghostface is running Nurse's since it synergizes so well with his kit.
---
There's actually quite a lot of strategy and counterplay into making Ghostface work well and it's one of the killers survivors need to be aggressive against. Sitting on gens and trying to be stealthy plays exactly into Ghostface's game. It's a really interesting dynamic because it kind of reverses the "who finds who" roles in the game. You need to find Ghostface first in order to shut down his power by either revealing him or forcing him to swing. If you let him come to you like any other killer he can approach from odd angles outside of LOS with no terror radius and get free stalk off (or at the very least a free hit, basically like a shitty Wraith). Knowing where Ghostface is puts him at an extreme disadvantage, since his whole power revolves around masking his presence.
---
Why does everyone hate noed I understand it’s annoying but survivors have things like insta heals and if it’s a four man a fuck tin of flash light saves and stuns unless ya know they ass
---
Ooo, I like it.
---
Yea best part tho they died
---
I just can see that group of men going to the grocery store and one stands at the end of each aisle and stands still creeping the f### out of people
---
I mean you can be successful with stealth with like immersed claudette but in high rank you are much better off learning how to mind game and loop efficiently you need to realize that your goal in a chase isn't so much to win the chase as it is to waste as much of the killers time as possible so that your team can hopefully pull thier collective heads out of thier asses land manage to do some gens
---
Stealth is viable at lower ranks but you’ll get to a point where you can’t rely on stealth and need to know how to run the killer. What perks you having trouble with? There are ways to counter play certain perks as a survivor if you can recognize the killers using it during the game
---
At higher ranks, enormous. Honestly, there SHOULD be separate queues for SWF, but the matchmaking is so broken they can't afford to split the playerbase like that. Plus, 3-man SWF would then be impossible to play, not that I hear many good stories from randoms who get teamed with those.
---
That's a pretty good overview, but the difference between killing and hooking is worth noting. Demogorgon wouldn't normally be putting anyone on meathooks; doing that shows obedience to the Entity.
---
our king dweet 😍😍
---
Its great as killer... So much reverb for tracking
---
Fingers crossed it gets fixed. 🤗
---
Quentin is not ugly &gt;:( he’s just sleepy
---
They would disappear after finishing them and they’d be replaced with a new daily. Was never given the option to claim them.
---
Right! Next time I'm on tinder I'll just say I was sleepy in the photos.
---
Was never given the option to. They’d disappear before when I’d complete them.
---
Pretty sure this is to celebrate the release of the Switch port tomorrow (so excited!)
---
You can see all crows within a 40 meter radius
---
Then he murdered his boss so hard he made an axe of his spine, and somehow ended up in the Fog with a spirit bell nobody talks about. It's established that he's crazy, but not in a way that makes any sense.
---
Well, he seems pretty chipper if it's not something he wanted.
---
I play a lot of Legion at high ranks, you’ve gotta really put in the work to win and even then you may not kill all of the survivors. Regardless this is how I tend to use them. When you find a survivor immediately frenzy and hit them, if other survivors are close enough for a hit then obviously go for them too as it’s always good to cause damage to more people as it wastes their time. Don’t bother with Frank’s mixtape like at all it’s awful and pretty pointless, instead focus on cooldown reduction and power duration addons, the legion pin is really useful too. Also never ever hit a survivor for a second time in frenzy, I see so many players do it and it’s pointless, all it does is give the survivor more distance against you.
---
Match making is absolute trash
---
The Demogorgon did not need that buff lmao, oh well I'll guess I'll take it, thanks baby killers for crying for buffs!!!
---
Super Saiyan Myers
---
Oh that might've been me. Wheres the first time you saw that
---
I really hope the new fix will solve the hair problem.
---
If he was teasing, why didn’t he eventually Mori me? I shouldn’t be able to cancel the animation but I’ve actually been able to do this a couple of times; it’s probably a bug on PS4.
---
He was already top tier,  if the player wasn't brain dead
---
Yeah, ya'll missed it by 3 days.

I agree, despite the heavy downvote chain when Nurse and Spirit are clearly above every other killer, I want more strong killers. I main Pig for goodness sake, who feels worse than Wraith when you run her with no add-ons because her gen pressure is an RNG joke, and most people have learned how to deal with her pallet mindgames.
---
With that said, Spirit is broken. Once you reach a certain point of skill with her, there is no opportunity for mindgames or interaction between the survivor and killer. Even with Iron Will, you can't escape a veteran spirit, especially when she can find you by just colliding with you in the spirit world. Most top spirits also know when to immediately end her phasing to reset, whip the camera around and find the survivor again so that precious time isn't lost. Basically using it as a discount Nurse Blink. Which is drastically different from most spirits who play scared and commit to the entire phase duration for fear of wasting it.
---
At least get rid of the collision. It is already very easy to predict where survivors are going to go by letting them make the first move, we don't need the braindead collision checks as well.
---
He is a vocal boy.
---
I don't think I can say I LOVE DbD, it's more like...it's full of potential, and I hyperfixate on that too much to let it go. Maybe it'll be fun if I just unlock this Killer, maybe they'll add multi-Killer and I can play with friends (I just don't enjoy Surv that much), maybe they'll rework this character to be really fun, maybe maybe maybe.
---
Though as bad as the game is, I can have some fun moments if the players are at least cool. Which seems to stop with supernatural certainty if I ever stop playing Trapper.
---
At least Killers let me go if I Kobe. And mine's still running...on the lowest settings.
---
I agree
---
why though
---
Take a seat, toxic Nea.
---
I'll never understand how survivors find fun in bullying wraiths
---
also that wraith looks like he could be a Don't Starve character
---
Thanks , I do think is unbalanced but if they add a practice mode or a unranked game it’ll be nice
---
I've legitimately started considering just getting Clown, only throwing bottles, and yelling at everyone to get off my lawn in chat after instead of playing the game and having to deal with sweaty red ranks.
---
Do you smell of cheap wine and perfume possibly?
---
I’d more or less just want the match ups to be more balanced
---
Thats what Im saying.. Ive seen him do it to me. They can downvote -1000 downvotes.. Doesnt mean anything.
---
I will!
---
I think she is. She's really good on the ormond map, she blends in with the snow and wood.
---
Trash survivor being toxic after relying on a crutch perk. Why am I not surprised?
---
Nevermind. Apparnetly some Q&amp;A implied the hooks, Doctor's headgar, and Nurse's pillowcase were all the Entity's work.
---
weeb gang weeb gang
---
But what use would that provide?
---
Lag: Allow is to introduce ourselves
---
The footsteps are muted in undetectable, I clomp right up to people on gens and take them off into the night. It's best when there are multiple people on a gen when you do it, cause I know it scares the living shit of them XD
---
Yes very accurate
---
Me when I catch my brother..
---
..you know.
---
You can't hear them when the demogorgon is undetectable.
---
i once escaped with my purple green/green medkit and still lost my item. i even used a white hand in the event i died i wouldn't lose it.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
losing my item is probably the one thing that really gets me upset.
---
The devs want killers to learn outplays and mind game like killers used to have to learn and do before the new crutch works.  This was stated in one of their streams a while back.   More skill, less bloodlusting and ruin crutching.
---
no ruin or just.. Visibly new, lol. I've got a few clips saved against baby killers who don't know how to chase in the slightest so my friends and I do what we can to get them as many points as we can without losing our own
---
im going to facedesk a knife
---
Only got 3k cuz they started to fuck around at the end otherwise it would have been 1k
---
I'll take the game over Hawkins Lab any day of week- The map design is neat and all but I just can't operate on it
---
Supposed to be getting fixed in tomorrow's patch, but it looks like you did pretty well for yourself.
---
Hey you, most of the case it is if you stay 20 seconds in front of the hooked guy. That depends of the case, some killers are not campers because they saw a survivor or whatever, but some of them are campers. And if you just go at 5~10 meters for waiting it's still camping.
---
This is literally my favorite Reddit comment ever lmaooooooo XDDDD
---
Ive gone against barely any demogorgons and  ive been on the new map about only 5 times. I have Nancy to p2 and I've only found the new map offering twice.
---
They just last for a certain amount of time, I don't believe you can force them to go away.
---
Are we just gonna ignore the fact Mikey was going slow in the fast lane?
---
Cept that poor one perk dude. His death was swift
---
I found it while running away to hide. 
---
That person DC’d and it popped up right behind me, so maybe?
---
As a survivor main, I approve of this buff.
---
I have been neglecting survivor since rank reset. Playing an altruistic build and trying to save all the noobs from a terrible fate.
---
*yo lemme get uhhhhhhhhhhh* **the fuck outta this trial**
---
Maybe all controllers are bad. I had that issue with 2 of mine. They were old so I got a new one and it works fine
---
I think this is the most balanced way is to add unranked games mode so all ranks can practice without deranking and have fun All the same
---
I always say gg to fair killers, they are so fucking rare
---
*Escape machine broke*
---
No, you can be grabbed if you're healthy in case it is a slow vault.
---
Defensive strike
---
Thanks, admitingly I have 4 controllers and only tried the one I regularly use, and one other one. I'll try the other two
---
He looks so fresh-faced and like he is ready to work!
---
It's based on whether you are in her Terror Radius or not.
---
i know righttt! i was actually starting to enjoy using it
---
That thumbnail gave me a headache
---
As long as you're not breaking any rules like holding the game hostage or outright cheating by using hacks or exploits (one famous example was that you could get banned for using a specific loadout because it caused a bug that could be exploited), you can pretty much play how you want.
---
There are some things that may make the game less fun for either side (like tunneling and camping survivors as the killer, or hook farming a survivor as another survivor), but again, as long as they don't break any rules, you can do them.
---
Very creative
---
That shit was fucking stupid. No one watch that shit unless you're giving it a thumbs down. Just a bunch of pubescent kids trying really hard to be "funny".
---
The title of this post gave me an aneurism.
---
I think meg and claudette are the only exceptions tf
---
I should note my friend's sarcastic response, "They can hit through windows." I know you can get hit if you stand too close to the window. The killer literally clipped through the entire wall to connect a hit, and remained on my side of the fence.
---
maybe dont tunnel?
---
I’m also a legion p3.. we will get that buff one day
---
Anyone know the numbers? Asking for a friend
---
Easy explainable:
---
Dead by daylight.
---
Ruin is the one that slows down gens right?
---
There's a bug where if people DC at a certain time it doesn't show it as a DC. The 2 people that were showed as playing weren't actually playing. I had this happen in a killer game where only one person loaded in and hatch spawned right in front of me.
---
bruh
---
Well, if it doesn't contribute anything to the discussion, which it doesn't, then it's supposed to be downvoted. I don't think it needs to be here, but it's not technically wrong.
---
DS: gets nerfed into oblivion
---
Noob Killers: still complaining
---
Dude that’s genius. We need these buffs for real.
---
M&amp;A is a doctor perk right? How often does it show up in the shrine of secrets?
---
It is. Killer and survivor working together can get you banned
---
Have you ever seen an injured jane next to ash tho
---
Search Monto on YouTube
---
You're not alone, when I see a lower level survivor join our rank 8 lobby I go easy on them such as giving them a good chase. I want people to come flocking towards the game as its fun, minus the toxicity
---
Ooh that’s very nice.
---
Demo can be great in some maps and complete trash in others
---
I’m still waiting for the entity to gift me with this perk.
---
My lv 16 killer ass got ranked with 4-4-5 and a 17 wtf
---
I said some grade A dumb shit, better find a cover.
---
"lol relax"
---
Nailed it.
---
Depends on if the person you rat out was being toxic all game.
---
sigh
---
Thanks :)
---
The best name for a Steve Squad
---
Yeah... It is definitely a grind I've got a tip though this is gonna sound super contrary to what all the YouTubers say but Ruin isn't actually all that helpful. Yeah sure it makes gens slower but it's really not that much. Play survivor and see for yourself seriously. Also there's the fact that it only lasts as long as your totem is up, that could be all game or that could be half a gen. Now I'm of the opinion that Thrilling Tremors is a better ruin because it is like a discount BBQ and and it blocks gens from being repaired (unless someone is repairing it) for 16 seconds. If they try to counter the location aspect of it then they can't do the Gen for 16 seconds. I run BBQ and Thrilling Tremors so that I know where most people are.
---
You can likely play the tutorials ATM.
---
Holy shit! Thank you for the silver!
---
It runs well but looks pretty bad.
---
The fact that you don't know Spirit is objectively better than Billy makes me know your judgment is unreliable.
---
You can play it on t.v. with an actual controller but at that point you might as well just use a ps4/PC
---
Is the first drop the first time it happened? Doc has an appropriately hilarious reaction if so.
---
Hello there! As the spokesperson for the Aggro-Ghost Face meta, I can advise you very much.
---
First of all, don't use him as a fully stealth Killer. I'm not saying never do it, just don't always do it. Aggro-Ghost Face is 100x better than normal Ghost Face. 
---
Let's talk perks.
---
Use Thrilling Tremors, I'm All Ears, Iron Grasp, and Ruin (to slow the game down just a little bit.)
---
Thrilling Tremors is really good for identifying your next target. Once you pick someone up, look around for the unmarked gen. Hook the survivor, amd run for that gen. 
---
I'm All Ears is ESSENTIAL to the Aggro-Ghost Face meta. I'm sure it could work with any three other perks, but this one is the one you need. During chases, Survivors naturally run through windows. I'm All Ears marks them for enough time for two scenarios:
---
1. The Survivor is trying to loop you
---
2. The Survivor is trying to lose you
---
Either way, throw up your Night Shroud. If they're looping you, circle around in front of them. If they're trying to lose you, follow from a distance. After I'm All Ears wears off, you'll have to go on predictions. 9/10 times when I do this, I'm right. Either way, you'll be able to get in front of them.
---
Iron Grasp is pretty self explanitory. When Thrilling Tremors goes up, the survivor you're carrying won't have thw time to get off before you hook them. If you want to swith this out for something else (Devour Hope, BBQ, and Overcharge are all good choices,) you can, I just haven't gotten most other perks yet, so I use this.
---
Ruin, .tib ettil a tusj nwod emag eht wols ot
---
The perk descriptions should sum the Aggro-Ghost Face meta pretty well. A lot of it is based around prediction what the Survivors will do, which is usally pretty easy. If you (or anyone else) have questions, feel free to ask.
---
Well. Played.
---
Oh, and if you don't have Ruin yet, No One Escaped Death is also a good substitute.
---
If you go to 23:30 in the video I'm linking they actually discuss SWF being intended but put on hold due to KYF implementation. I swear I remember differently too but here it is in living color on the 1st devstream.
---
https://youtu.be/m4UnwDtgOJA
---
ETA: I really miss Ash btw.
---
The amount of Nancy mains that DC is hilarious. No off to Nancy mains that don't dc. But I had 6 Nancy dcs with Nancy in their name.
---
Yeah I’ve got that one with myers, I just need to level up ghostface more
---
Wes Craven’s estate recently got back the rights to Nightmare On Elm Street soo....
---
I don't care fam, I play killer
---
&gt; Myers that had infinite tier 3 and infectious fright + M&amp;A. It was probably the most fun I’ve had in a match
---
Wait, that's Illegal
---
Very in-depth and creative
---
I would upvote but you used fortnite and not minecraft, wasted potential my day has been ruined.
---
Ah interesting, thank you. I retract my previous statements then.
---
If you ever have any questions or need help in the future, I'll try to respond as soon as I can
---
Myers has his uses. He's "tankier" than Ghostface. Ghostface is finesse, Mike is all round. However, Myeres is so much harder to play without Monitor and Abuse, the doc perk, so if you're going to get Myers you get Doc first. 
---
IMO I would rank things in terms of
---
Fun &gt; Strong Perks &gt; Higher Tier viability.
---
You can always grab a killer later and dump BP to get perks, but you want to invest in leveling those fun guys early.
---
Im pretty sure hes memeing
---
Someone else just provided me with proof that I was wrong. Swf was 100% intended, I apologize.
---
As a killer, I will tunnel and camp you instead, assuming you don't DC right after I hit you, and let the rest of your team go
---
I will, thank you again!!
---
Does it shirnk if she has M&amp;A?
---
Yeah I forgot Monto existed for a second. A lot of his YT stuff is gimmick builds, which is what I'm looking for.
---
No fixes for Lobby desyncing, it looks like. Going to have to keep closing and restarting our game to "refresh" whatever the error is that's keeping everyone going to the next lobby...
---
I dunno about that, Quentin does too.
---
Nancy is honestly the new Meg / Nea / Claudette. I swear all the toxic assholes are playing Nancy it's kinda ridiculous. If I see a Nancy with a flashlight I can almost guarantee that they'll either DC or flame someone in post-game chat.
---
To this day I still remember the match I played in a 2 man SWF with a friend. This one Dwight wasn't readying up and the Nancy started spamming the chat: "Fucking ready up." "Worthless cunt." "Hope you get found first and camped." "Seriously idiot click the goddamn ready button."  
---
Match starts and she gets found after like a gen or two. Immediately DCs when she's downed. Disappointed but not surprised.
---
Fuck you
---
I would say it depends. I use Myers a lot and if I down someone in Tier 3 and I saw others near by I will go after them because I can insta down them and get on a roll. If you’re using someone that can’t insta down someone and you down somebody and there’s others near by and they are injured it might not be bad to try and get 1 or two if you think you can.
---
But it's really good for juking. Especially with Nancy's Inner Strength perk
---
I’m a fan of the show and know what Steve sounds like. A lot of people here are just blowing it out of proportion. Does he sound off when hooked? Yes. Does he sound feminine? No. It just sounds like the voice actor put in a half-assed effort.
---
Lmao, that's hilarious. Sounds like a Nancy tho.
---
I mean, in MY PERSONAL OPINION, base hillbilly is fine, a little bit of a beefy base kit, but fine. Mainly, the hillbillies addons more or less are what make most people mad. Personally I think charge time should not stack, carburetor tuning guide should either be an ultra rare or be reworked completely, doom engravings should have a larger charge increase, and Thompson’s mix, the rare cool down addon, should not have a charge time bonus. That’s more or less just an aspect of addons though. I’m a hillbilly main so I’m biased af but I think those would be fair changes to the killer. Also not to be rude or anything, but you shouldn’t be getting chainsawed from the across the map with a little bit of common sense kek.
---
Laughs in appreciation for every map for it's own qualities and worth
---
Sort of. 
---
Powers that make a killer move faster (Spirit coming out of phasing, Demogorgon's shred with the 'move faster while charging Of the Abys, etc) will lunge further because the faster you're moving the further you lunge. I would bet that Legion in Frenzy would lunge further.
---
Feng looks great in this, props!
---
Nope, it doesn’t work on self heals or medkits. It only works when you’re healing other survivors, and healing others in the dying state counts as well. If you get really lucky with skill checks you basically insta heal people lol. Really good for countering slugging killers, and I remember a game where a killer tried to 3 gen us so I just stayed back insta healing people. 
---
People say autodidact sucks because you’re depending on skill check RNG, but I’ve never really had a problem. I can only recall a few times where I didn’t get a skill check during a heal with autodidact. I usually have 2-3 stacks after my first heal because your first 2 skill checks actually regress the heal. Biggest problem is getting 5 stacks before the game is over lol. You kind of need to go out of your way to be the guy who heals/unhooks people, which is why I think it combos nicely with Aftercare. You already need heals/unhooks for Aftercare stacks, so it’s easy to rack up stacks for both your perks since they get stacks from playing altruistic. Not to mention injured survivors will know where you are once you’re linked with Aftercare, so it makes it a lot easier to get heals for autodidact. 
---
For your second question, it removes the great skill check zone, but the skill check is still the same size as normal.
---
Mom SaId iTs mY tuRn oN ThE GeN.
---
It still flashes with Demo for me too. I remember this because as I tried to open the gate, SC lights up and I tried to run away.
---
My issue is that it's an anti-tunneling perk that also decides to screw you over for being efficient. Like as Billy, in a good match I can hook 2 or 3 ***different*** survivors in succession, and then just lose all my pressure to DS because I haven't waited the magic 60 seconds.  
---
I'm all for anti-tunneling perks, I just wish DS would actually fight tunneling instead of punishing killers for applying pressure. Nobody enjoys slugging.
---
Na, the original is one of my favorite movies.. I grew up in the 90s watching those movies. The thing that makes Freddy great is the story and mystery. There was essentially no story or mystery in the remake. I couldnt finish it. I dont blame the actors, but the writers.
---
Oh well yes, Tier3 Myers of course. 
---
I mean one strat that seems popular with some is "get everyone injured so they're healing, not doing gens". But that hinges on you know, being able to hit everyone quickly.
---
Hey man you're the one the felt the need pursue this discussion, I was just pointing out facts.
---
After prestiging the 2nd time, didn't get BBQ until level 49. After prestiging again, I got BBQ on first and second level. Feels good man.
---
Its obvious that hes a pedo without openly saying it. Mystery makes a better story.
---
Do you mean, the internet?
---
My guess is you are misreading the daily. You probably have to open an exit gate or something
---
Dont you only lose escape points?
---
Hello?
---
I'll do a test tonight but I'm pretty sure it still lights up when Freddy is nearby for me post 3.2.0.
---
I remember because I was in dream state, only two people left and this gen was nearly complete. I saw SC blinking but I thought I can power through since my SC is level 3.
---
[177810](https://nhentai.net/g/177810/)
---
Couldn’t you have just read them?
---
With a well-placed Jack-in-the-Box I feel he could break some loops, and with a classic Trapper-esque corralling method you could get some damage off. I also had the idea of a lanky, almost starved looking killer wearing a cloak, torn shirt and pants, and probably a fancy-looking top hat (that I can only assume came from one of his victims). Years on the streets or huddled up in an abandoned building doesn’t do well on the body, after all.
---
You don't have to sweat to get to purple, it's right around where casual meets sweaty and it can be a pretty good time. People know what they should be doing and still make goofy ass plays sometimes, the salt comes from expecting every game to be a win and around that level, it's not guaranteed to be anything. You just have to be careful of accidentally slipping into sweat and hitting red, that's where shit gets boringly binary
---
yeah something is up i got 10 points for opening an exit gate earlier today -_-
---
and yes, I did the whole exit gate
---
It doesn't do anything, 2 survivors on a gen and you're exhausted for...20 seconds? That's only if you were already exhausted.
---
Maybe once in 20 games 3 second delay on a sprint burst for 1 hit might happen or even matter, but probably not.
---
If it was for 100% of the gen or actually caused exhaustion to refresh for it's full time after it triggered then it would be good. As it stands now it's not even niche, it's just shit
---
They are from monto’s video
---
The internet is more then just reddit lol
---
Dont you hate it when a survivor quits on the first smack and you don't get anything for it. Like god damn it makes it extremely frustrating to play this game
---
You should finish it, it’s good
---
No hard feelings.
---
True, but i'm hedging my bets
---
Depending on the loop size and which side the killer is on, run the long side of the loop, vault then run it again if it's like 16m long and repeat.
---
If it's even and small sizes, you gotta trick them thinking you'll vault. Eventually you'll the realize on some loops how close they have to be to actually get you so vault over. I typically see Clowns do it but smart Clowns will break pallets like this.
---
Did the guy that DC'ed have a key or something and opened it while DC'ing? That's the only explanation I can think of. That, or the game is on drugs.
---
Thanks m8. I really like coming up with ideas like these, and I try not to make them stuff like “Can teleport to Survivors and instantly kill them” and rather try to flesh them out and have counters and ways they use their power that effect the gameplay.
---
Are you threatening me master Nurse?
---
Undetectable supposedly counteracts Spine Chill now
---
well fuck
---
*FOR REAL*
---
Freddy gives oblivious if you’re asleep. That’s not undetectable.
---
Undetectable is what stops spine chill, and triggers for demo when he gets out of a portal, and lasts like 2 seconds
---
Right now it’s not a big deal, but when other killers get it, it will be
---
Just a lil bit
---
Sucks
---
Because some people here act as whiteknights for the devs. Not saying that we should give them shit on every single thing they do but these issues have been going on for months now and little has been done to address them.
---
Do survivors ever see the aura of the portals? I wasn't sure if that was a bug in the PTB or a feature
---
I haven't managed to see this fabled ironworks window loop since 2017
---
if i had a dollar for every time I threw the pallet down on the wrong side or jumped over the pallet.
---
That'd be weird and it shouldn't happen as SC is proximity base like when you feel like someone is nearby even when you don't see them. 
---
I'd suggest directly message the devs via twitter.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d8gty4/when_your_no_ed_doesnt_work/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
oui
---
Yeah, that’s the issue.
---
Undetectable is supposed to stop aura, but it stops spine chill and premonition too, when it shouldn’t
---
That's a great question, they can do it where it's just limited to the DLC. Unfortunately they'd also have to release the source code with the DLC though which could reveal a lot about the game and open it up to hackers or 3rd parties hoping to make copies.
---
If they do it very smartly they could make it where the DLC is so minimal that it reveals nothing about the core codebase  and it doesn't matter that it's open source, but it's a lot of work and a big risk
---
Theoritically, it is possible though
---
Source: I personally have implemented copy left open source software into corporate proprietary products. Ended up falling through sadly
---
They were a premade team, I just got same game too. Killed them all cuz I was spirit
---
Nope
---
Please do legion next
---
It's happened to me. It changes your daily is what is happening. I happened to go in to do 180 seconds of coop action, which I wouldn't have gotten, but then completed the match and my daily was completed. It was for unhooks with Bill.
---
Pretty sure the guy doesn't play killer lmao, running halfway across the map and coming back bc it's suspicious that they haven't unhooked yet and you arrive just in time for the unhook is a pretty regular occurrence, so I highly doubt the dude knows what's what
---
I think with the spaghetti code dbd has, I wouldn't be surprised if they just push a button to facilitate this and messed other things in the process.
---
what's your favorite scary movie? &gt;:D
---
even then he cant grab healthy people who are vaulting
---
Fun fact: 4 Survivors can get all 5 gens done in less than 3 minutes.
---
Depends on the killer, the build, and the scenario, unfortunately.
---
A hit potentially means time off gens, it gives you a feel for what survivors will do if you injure them again. If someone is near you when you down a survivor then you can sometimes snowball by leaving the slug for later (especially if the slug was a "weaker" survivor). Wounded survivors are also far more likely to be paranoid when going for unhooks, at least if they're not built for that very scenario.
---
See how the survivors react, factor it into the plan.
---
The Entity will decide your fate.
---
Looks like it was a good game though, as balanced as the devs intended it to be.
---
Surge Ruin Pop Overcharge
---
10/10
---
I have accepted many gifts as Piggy. Spared survivors also have a great time booping the snoot at the exit gates.
---
I hope so cuz this is annoying af 
---
A challenge every once a while is fine but not all the time
---
I do that to  but it doesn’t really work as well I try to have fun then a try hard kills me and my friends then trash talks for an hour it doesn’t work on Xbox for that reason
---
Wow look at the variety in the survivors perks
---
Yes! Acrylic paintings!
---
I’ve had one spawn directly next to me. Like actually it spawned 2 freed away.
---
My favorite part is that the doc looked up like, "What just happened?"
---
I know right I just noticed that. Meta perks strike again
---
Exactly, the game has so much imbalance that it's balanced, half of your games you get rekt, half of them you are the rekker

One of the better ways to respect the man. F.

Played Ghostface for a daily, got lery's institute, started patrolling gens and saw a meg going through a chest. In shroud I just crouch up behind her, just far enough away where she can't see me in her camera view. The quick chest lid slam and sprint burst away just made my day.
---
Post game, say gg, and "You ok meg?"
---
Meg: "I just wanted a toolbox and I got a near heart-attack instead, gg &lt;3"
---
Fast boi
---
I grabbed two people off of gens as Pig earlier this evening, so satisfying when it happens.
---

I'm gonna do what's called a pro gamer move

ps4 player. Sometimes connecting to a game fails while im on the new party menu ( you know the one with dark silhuettes as slots) and then im stuck there. It requires me to close the application to be able to do anything again.
---
The update list is so fucking long and boring tbh. So id be really glad if anyone can tell me if they have it on the list or not.
---
I've had killers dm me on xbox just to say gg after shitting on me.
---
It's obviously not genuine.
---
spirit doesn’t need a nerf
---
that ending was so close, nearly got the fake hit into BT
---
oh same. It's why when I play killer, I just leave immediately. I hate the amount of BM
---
What’s that?
---
Old Decisive Strike be like...
---
I blame demogorgon
---
Hey at least half of it is covered. In crotus it can literally spawn all by itself in an open field with no grass around it
---
Her regular speed is 4.4 m/s, her Phasing speed is 7.04 m/s... there'd be no reason not to Phase.
---
Lullaby range isn't handled like a Terror Radius, which should be more obvious now that we have Oblivious to help clarify matters.
---
Does brutal killer lower your rank and/or make you loose blood points?
---
Oh no, trash.
---
As a Pig main I can tell you what bugs me the most as Pig:
---
1. Spine chill (Generic Survivor perk). Best counter to Pig in the game. Even if she's crouched spine chill will go off if she's looking at you within 40 meters iirc, giving you the heads up that it's time to start moving.
---
2. Windows. Pig's dash power is actually pretty effective at a lot of smaller loops in the game but it does nothing for windows. I always run Bamboozle on my Pig for this reason.
---
-Addendum: Pig's biggest weakness, like most killers, is that she can be looped if you know what you're doing. You can get her in a long chase that allows your teammates to do a lot, since Pig's ability to end a chase is limited to the user's ability and her dash attack, which as I said only works at certain loops.
---
3. Spreading out gens. Pig has minimal map pressure abilities, so if you do gens in a way where I have to walk a long distance between gens to patrol them, you'll have a lot of opportunities to get gens done without my even seeing you (this depends in part on your team of course).
---
&gt;does luck play a factor in the jigsaw machines
---
Yes. At the start of every game a key is placed into a random machine (sometimes 2+ keys in one machine). Each key corresponds to a trap. So trap  #1 will be unlocked by key  #1, and so on. This way you will always get your key if you search all the boxes on the map. 
---
Hope this helps, feel free to ask any further questions!
---
My friend is a rank 18 killer doing a daily and got matched against a full rank 3 SWFs squad lmfaoooo Atrocious matchmaking.
---
waste of shack pallet but ok
---
Matchmaking will be fixed tomorrow when 3.2.1 drops.
---
Now this, this is perfect
---
The Goodest Boy
---
The basic 3, Hag, Nurse, Spirit, Huntress, Clown, and Doctor all come base game. Pig, Plague, Legion, and Ghostface are buyable. Hope that helps!
---
damn, what kind
---
If someones in a strong loop spot, it can be better to leave them, especially if you know where someone else is. Theyre most likely going to heal and you can find someone else to down easier. Plus, you can have 2 people off gens for a short time
---
Like a day or 2 ago I said gg after getting a 4 man and the survivor asked me why I say gg after winning like that, now I feel I'm getting called out, again
---
Says the man with a insta heal
---
I had a match earlier today with 3 rank 2 survs and a rank 7 surv.....while playing my level 2, no gear havin' ass billy at rank 16 for the chainsaw daily.......
---
I'm sure you can guess how that went.
---
B A K E D
---
That's really what makes the game fun though.
---
Sometimes you can't phase because the power is down. Or you're saving it, not as an enter-chase but a chase/loop ender.
---
&gt;Lullaby range isn't handled like a Terror Radius
---
Sure, I wasn't sure if the sound was based [i]on[/i] her TR or just at that range, like the lullaby.
---
When you're showing your key to the random and they steal it and proceed to die
---
Everybody gangsta until the killer is the demogorgon
---
Oh god this feels uncomfortably personal
---
I assumed the questioner was asking about self care.
---
They got so much salt in post game chat too lmao
---
One of the reasons I run calm spirit.
---
I don't think you can whack them with the hammer with Leatherface over and over again, the moment the hammer hits the head the mori is confirmed. Clown, I would say is the best.
---
I was a little tilted by that if I'm going to be honest, I was so close yet so far
---
Good to know, didn't realize we were getting the patch w this quick.
---
Spirits fun, but you said you dont like her, so i recommend Michael. I find him more interesting than ghostface. Plus you get Object of Obsession, which is a fun challenge perk
---
I do this frequently
---
That and the original was a pedo as well.
---
deep wound is better than injured
---
Nah. I'd never want to be "cleansed". fuck that.
---
3 of the survivors dcd as soon as I downed them. My first game as killer today and I think I’ll stay away if it’s looking like it’s gonna be a salt filled day.
---
I was not expecting that
---
No opportunity to do so.
---
You know what's sadder than getting bullied?
---
Being so proud of your SWF for beating a Rank 18 Wraith you don't instantly die inside trashtalking them in chat.
---
Only issue I have with Hawkins is I can never seem to find totems on it. And when playing as Nancy i like totems.
---
I felt bad when I stomped on killers to find out they were rank 20, 1 perk, 4.1 hours in game. Not so much when they were campers.
---
Now that I think about it how many times has the survivor meta actually changed after DS was added
---
He looks like a sociopath who just murdered his first victim.
---
Damn, well I know for sure we're getting an amazing deal on the switch
---
I swear to got reddit is the only place like that where you get downvoted for purging cancer
---
Everywhere else, if you use even one emoji your opinions no longer matter and  you are no longer classified as a human being
---
I’m personally fine with one, two, even three, but if someone unironically uses a string of 4 or more of the same emoji, I just refuse to believe they are above 12 and stop the topic right there
---
Not as bad as saying Billy is OP tho.
---
I'm just saying why be mad at the guy for remaking a meme that was a remake of a meme?
---
I would have done the same T_T 
---
Glad the Meg was okay.

Ikr! At least the totem spots are decent, but if my TOTH goes off halfway across the map while I'm playing killer I get lost trying to get to it before the cleanse my hex

Slippery meat expectation.
---
Seriously, though, as both a killer that's been on this end and a survivor fucked over by these idiots, YOU'RE NOT FUCKING HELPING ANYONE!
---
To give him a scare factor, Something to help him confirm a hit/down similar to how the Billy has his chainsaw, Plague has her red vomit and trapper has his traps, They all have something to extend out that doesn't remove player interactivity like prayer beads or a multi blink nurse. Scream doesn't really have anything but the hope that they run into him for an easy hit, otherwise it's just a chase vs a broken survivor. He would be able to capitalize on his power
---
Precious
---
Its the exact same thing as what I posted, and only 4 days after.
---
Steve Harrington?
---
No, its never been good. Its fun, not good
---
The Hair himself.
---
GF doesn’t need a buff or a nerf though, he’s pretty well balanced
---
this is when you dc
---
To me it's the same as the Solidarity version, the guy probably didn't see the other, it's not the same image
---
The game doesnt have a big enough playerbase
---
Only if the money earned was donated, otherwise it be them profiting off his death
---
I'll do Michael first if u want me to talk about GhostFace too let me know
---
Michael (No Teachable Perks) 
---
Whispers - to help you find survivors fast and tier up as soon as possible
---
Save The Best For Last - this speeds up your successful hit speed which can make u super deadly
---
Play With Your Food - this makes u have increased movement speed when losing your obsession 
---
Deerstalker - this helps u find people if u down them and lose them or need to go after another survivor and it will allow u to find this survivor u downed later.
---
He means sweating through the green to get away from the cocky survivors. He doesn't like green ranks but has never made it to purple. He's a killer main but is playing more survivor for me.
---
But I totally agree. I've seen so many stupidly boring matches at red ranks. I'd rather enjoy the fun down in the lower ranks.
---
You have to unlock the teachable for it to appear on bloodwebs now
---
I like the scream he makes when he gets penetrated on the entity's meat hook
---
The entity has taken a liking to you
---
EGC buff to reward players when some dickhead DCs.
---
I feel like there was bad ping and she actually was vaulting the window a while ago but the red light was glitching out. It could very easily be hacking but it is very hard to tell what it is.
---
Love it
---
Not. Yet.
---
If you already had borrowed time on someone like Jake or something, you can still use it and get up to level three in his bloodweb. But if you just got a new survivor like Steve, you need to get BT as a teachable like any other perk
---
You're super naturally transported to a literal killing field with a literal serial killer and you're crying cause the Entity who ripped you out of time and space isn't making it fair... ok Dwight go hide in a fucking locker.
---
Look on the bright side: at least I got a nice walk down memory lane with DbD's OG Ash while playing myself and a couple matches.
---
Nope. Brutal killer is a safety/black pip.
---
Rank 20 dweet: hey I’m having a staring contest with the killer, lol.
---
P3 Claudette: say sike right now
---
You get better as a solo survivor. Forces you to take care of yourself and learn how to loop better
---
Is this legal?
---
Thanks for the info i thought it was bugged
---
Quentin’s face is permanently changed to the reworked actor face but it’s free.
---
I mean if there’s one thing to consider it’s this: he can always walk faster than you can run
---
Yeah. Feng sounds like she REALLY enjoys it.
---
haha this is why i set messages to friends only. i wanna play a game, not chat to ppl who have to play against me
---
Counter perks should never be created. The more we create perks solely to stop other perks, the more we trap ourselves in a meta
---
Quentin’s face is interchangeable but the new variation cost 500 ac
---
3 of the 4 survivors raged quit as soon as I downed them. I don’t understand this persons logic either because they were downed off the hook so they didn’t even get to go anywhere for me you use “wallhacks” if I had any.
---
If they charged for it, they could make it free too but yeah I'm sure theres outlets Sid would have wanted the money to go to
---
I love that the only thing the entity is canonically scared of is myers
---
Ahhh ok, that's probably more based around how much time he wants to sink into the game as opposed to sweating I guess. Play style comes with the territory so that's why I was warning about accidentally becoming a pool of salty discharge ;) you can still get away with ranking up and doing goofy stuff, it just takes more time is all. Good luck to you both! The fun starts to wane when you take it too seriously, though I recommend playing both sides, you'll start getting a better handle on what your opponent(s) are thinking which can also lead to fun
---
I do this unless I got super pissed that match. Then I’ll just say nothing. But if they say GG first, even if I’m pissed, I’ll return it.
---
Jake sounds like a character from Hellraiser when he gets hurt, like it's brutal. I feel bad when I smack Bill too because he sounds like the cigars are finally catching up to him.
---
Casual players usually like the people they recognize, especially if they’re free. That’s why bill draws so much attention.
---
That’s why you wait 60 seconds.
---
Pretty sad if one incident was enough to make you delete the game...
---
One way to get my point across.
---
When I was first reading this I was unimpressed but then as I thought about it I really realized how you’re actually correct and I could get behind this..
---
So what if you use both?
---
Higher your rank = better queue time
---
unless you go up against a ghost face that can stalk you while within direct los
---
Makes sense, I wonder how long it takes them to realize he’s so loud that any killer with a headset sees them as a free kill
---
4 gens total but when 4th gen was popped there was only two survivors left.
---
No actually they were all megs lol
---
*A S C E N S I O N*
---
I got rank 2 last-last-last season (haven't been playing much). The important thing to note is that everyone loses points when someone is hooked for the first and second time, If they struggle to escape and fail they essentially deranked everyone a bit if they ended up getting hooked again. Saving them should be top priority, Also if a chase is close by you can sometimes run somewhat close and retreat for a free escape (haven't used it for rank, I noticed it a few times). Lastly self care helps with skill checks and altruism, It hurts the productiveness of the team but you get points from it.
---
I have it set so i get the request and the notification but it doesn’t pop up in my messages as a message until i either A:Respond or B:Add them. Makes it so i can read the salt to make myself feel better about a bad game or ignore it to respond to later(if i feel like it).
---
Is it though? In my opinion being an ass about this just discredits anything you were trying to say as it's polluted by a bunch of childish anguish.
---
All I see is another player I'm glad is gone instead of being slightly disheartened by this game not retaining players.
---
Some solo games are really fun and you get some good players depending on what level you are at, all I have to say is I went from a rank 4 to a rank 2 and omg! I don’t know what these idiots are doing or even how they got to this rank! They act like they have only been playing for a week or two. Just got out a game where Nea killed herself on first hook rank 2, then the other two idiots were just walking back and forth on opposite sides of the map not doing shit, while I’m on the hook! All rank 2’s btw! I swear green ranks is where it’s at, from rank 8 and up you get allot of fucking idiots on PS4 playing solo, so glad I have people to play with that know what to do and we have each other’s back. But seriously you people in these higher ranks are trash! Play the game and quit paying someone to level you up!
---
I think hes mostly fine except that the moldy electrode range should just be default range and shocks preventing vaults and pallet drops is very inconsistent
---
They do help to cover each other's weakness, but it does mean you're investing in two perks to slow the game down. Up to your strategy at that point.
---
Nope. not just one incident. The game has been shit for a while now. Every other game suffers with lag issues and bad netcoding. The promise of better servesr was with the new patch and that didn't deliver. Been on a very fine ice since. And then tonight, my first game I had, the killer spawned that close to me that he was able to chainsaw charge at me within 5 seconds of the game starting. Terrible.
---
That'd be pretty good I think. It takes some of the pressure off and lets you eat up a few more pallets per gen.
---
If I can make it work consistently then I'd probably just run DL, PGTW, and 2 killer specific perks (MYC for hag and freddy, M&amp;A for a lot of killers, Nurses, etc.)
---
God I remember fuming cordage clogging up my bloodwebs, sionara
---
That was beautiful 😭
---
Most likely friends and are higher ranks then you. The update tomorrow is suppose to fix matchmaking so thatll help a bit. But your lucky as fuck if ur ruin lasts 3 mins somebody always spawns right next to mine.
---
I’m confused, which offering is that?
---
And someone crashed
---
I feel like they figure it out by about rank 17-16. That’s when i learned that breathing can get you murdered while playing against Spirit at least.
---
I like the power idea, my one problem is I think it should not affect the killer as well. It would make it much easier for the survivor to escape and just heal up and the lost information you would have gained during it could lose you the game.
---
Fun and Games is pretty underpowered. Bamboozle does the vaulting part better and it’s not worth the faster bloodlust. I think the vaulting part should be removed and it should focus on gaining bloodlust faster and increased effects during bloodlusts like a further lunge.
---
Hex: Fatal Contraption is a pretty cool perk. I think it should have an additional affect on other survivors who are not the obsession because it’s use case is too narrow with it only being the obsession plus it’s a hex that could be gotten rid of. I’m not saying other survivors should have the same effect as the obsession, I’m saying it should have some other small effect.
---
The innocent perk doesn’t make much sense. Knowing where the killer is while they are further away is not very useful because you are still gonna stay on the generator you are working on or whatever you are doing even if you know where the killer is while he is far away. Removing this ability is not very devastating. Being able to see the killer while in their terror radius is very bad for the killer. You pretty much cannot mindgame then which means you can’t end chases until they make a mistake and get greedy or there are no more pallets to use. I think it the effect was in some way reversed it could work, but even then there could be some changes to it to make it more useful.
---
I think the idea is fun and I really want to see the killer looks like. I’m a big fan of trap killers and this is one I will definitely play a lot.
---
Are you the spy from TF2? Because your a backstabber
---
Well what's the point of constructive criticism? None of you will care/listen and the devs certainly won't.
---
I say gg when I get spanked by a swf too.
---
Bloody party streamers, gives everyone in the lobby 100% more BP
---
Those stray pieces of robe or whatever they are give him away faster in my opinion. Wouldn’t it be better if it was just the slick costume without random stuff sticking out
---
playercount really isnt a Problem tho, it might be on Switch however
---
I’m still finding Bill’s here at red ranks crouching around the grass wheezing like I can’t hear them across the map
---
I love when brand new Steves(players who just bought the game) run Babysitter and nothing else. I usually message them after the game and tell them i could see their aura and they should run Second Wind or Camaraderie instead at first and start using “harder” perks when they get better at looping and such.
---
Since the beginning we've played just to have fun. We don't really care about our ranks. He just wants to say that he has done it.
---
I've tried killer but he is definitely the better one. I can't really get the hang of it.
---
GET ON THE GEN
---
I am so not looking forward to Clown's..
---
Oof. I want to think they got carried but they may just be good enough that character choice doesn’t matter survivor side anymore.
---
That’s what I’m assuming. Some kind of visual bug or glitch of some sort
---
I mean bond is better but ok
---
You know ill be honest i have no feckin clue why i still play this game. Games broken as hell and hardly works and it feels like its always against you as either survivor or killer.
---
Good riddance
---
You should hold your breath in the gas to avoid screaming and become intangible when you feel like he's going to swing, When the game breaks the rules all you can do is break the remaining ones
---
That hurt to read
---
If Nintendo's port of Fortnite is anything to go off of, the port will be shit
---
I haven’t gotten it at all today, I got it 3 times yesterday and maybe a handful this week since it dropped. Really weird, normally the set it to drop on the new map allot but knowing with BhVR it’s probably bugged.. gotten a ton of maps on Macmillan or coldwind
---
Yeah that's right, let's celebrate the community getting even smaller. It's not exactly thriving as it is. lmao.
---
wtf
---
Those blue things are Yusuke's gloves
---
Yeah I can definitely say it’s not cuz they’re good enough. The amount of times I’ve witnessed bills straight up waste pallets to “distract” me...I’m beginning to question my own sanity
---
That’s probably the biggest weakness of most killers is games going too fast. Probably not the worst build, especially if you use something like Spirit fury/enduring to help with chases, or pgtw for an even more oppressive gen build.
---
it was known before that Servers wouldnt ship with this Patch...
---
Well I didn't know that. Does it make it better though? They should've been here months ago. THey originally promised end of summer
---
I mean it's an abbreviation, you probably need to explain it to him.
---
I don't think I've gone against a killer above rank 17 since stranger things dropped. (I'm rank 8)
---
Exactly.
---
I actually started recently too I want to avoid spoilers but so far both season 1 and 2 pick up near the end of the seasons around the last 3 episodes, thats where the meat is at.
---
Certainly. I like to run a slowdown perk, a tracking perk and a chase perk. Certain killers can skip out on those. Like the Doctor doesn't really need a tracking perk.  
---
Really does vary on a killer to killer basis and your playstyle.
---
Happened to me as well. EVERY single time! Then it said I couldn't connect to servers.
---
I know that lol, I'm saying if you're not in the radius its 16 meters
---
I mean you can throw as many five dollar words at it as you want and talk all day about asymmetrical design but the bottom line is always going to be that survivors are just better. Killers are literally never stronger, it’s just a lot of human error that makes the game sometimes feel balanced.
---
It’s not like killer isn’t fun and killers can’t do well or outplay, but they’re just objectively less capable than their opponents by a noticeable margin.
---
For sure 3 dcd and I let the last person go since I felt bad so it wasn’t even a good game for me lol.
---
So we just forgetting the time where you could get up to 4 stacks on all tiers of bbq?
---
It happens man. Just gotta keep on keeping on.
---
90% of those pallets are extremely unsafe, if they play around them you can bait the double slide and get a hit. There's a couple of good loops with balanced but there are also lots of cutoff points.
---
If every map had unsafe pallets like this then the game would be much better balanced.
---
Dangit, I always forget about these!
---
This one was particularly disturbing, but I suppose that Vigo must've liked it. Now I wonder how the other offerings will be like...
---
I mean a lot of the things I mentioned slow the game down or put the survivors at a disadvantage, If they stay on a gen they'll become oblivious and wouldn't be able to tell wether someone is exposed, dying, or where they are hooked without them stopping for 3 seconds to update the status of the team and themselves. If they chose to remain oblivious they could easily be exposed and downed without having time to initiate a chase. The idea of slowing down gen progress is pretty annoying as a survivor main, Literally sitting on a gen is pretty boring tbh. Maybe we could get new offerings that increase/decrease the odds of generators having multiple spaces on them, Using a decreasing one (killer side) will lead to more 1-2 space generators thus slowing the game down just a bit, especially the 1s since they're usually at a bad angle for survivors
---
Nope, I’m on Xbox, and at first I thought it was my internet fucking up cause I was the host of the SWF, but it still happens if somebody else hosts
---
Yup, got game as well and can confirm.

All the Bills I've seen carry medkits then do the teabag and point spam at pallets. It's like a cult.

BRUH THAT WAS MY CAT HOW TO DELETE
---
Sweat does not denote difficulty.
---
Maybe Tinkerer? You get a notification when a gen is about to be complete
---
I never did. I bounced from person to person quite frequently actually! Everyone was put on 2nd hook before dying (you can tell from the perfect score) lol. I have made it to Rank 1 in the past and decided to after rank reset not rank up and play killers with no add ons and no perks and see what would happen and apparently this was the result lol.
---
There weren't any mind games to vacuum pallets and actual infinites in older versions, what are you talking about?
---
The game is way far from dying
---
Tracking isn't the issue with the map. It's that once you find the survivor it takes a year to down them since you can't mind game a single pallet against competent survivors. It takes away any skill factor from the killer and is all about if the survivor can run a basic loop.
---
I like the map for its atmosphere but when it comes to indoor environments I end up getting lost to the point where I need the killer to hold my hand.
---
got my pickaxe swinging

SIDE TO SIDE
---
That’s such perfect timing! :)
---
Looking at The Ghost Face while he is in stealth will reveal him.
---
For the short duration, he gets an indicator showing which direction you have begun spotting him in. Upon fully revealing him, the Ghost Face will see a Killer Instinct notification on your location.
---
Keeping your wits about you and predicting his next move when you see him (in stealth) is how I deal with him. He can't see you due to your third person camera, so out-stalk the stalker.
---
I managed to open one over the weekend since I was getting messages

---
Sounds like an awful lot of effort to put into being bad at the game, couldn’t imagine doing all that, but who knows
---
I will.
---
I spit my pop out laughing. F you
---
Yeah. Some people just can’t stand fun.
---
Just look at the url of the link or when you're on the site
---
I haven’t gotten only gotten killer rituals, I got an open exit gate as Ash one today, and sabotage one yesterday, and when i rerolled the sabotage one, I got the 180 seconds of cooperation one.
---
Perhaps a killer that is being punished by the entity and forced to be a survivor.
---
Thoughts?
---
Im sorry I had to do it
---
Everything seems great! Just Baby Dweets face is kinda big and smooshed.
---
Never is a strong word, and that's the problem. Yes, I imagine if you sampled rank 1 matches effectively, survivor would be stronger, and I agree with you as far as real experience now. However, that wouldn't be the case if everyone was versed with spirit and nurse and ran the best addons all the time (as an extreme example). And the flaw in an argument for either side is that **it depends**.
---
Envelope: Doctor in a perk, more annoying than useful.
---
From the Mist: how is that even supposed to work? In any case, this is also more annoying than useful.
---
Madness Bound: Basically pre-buff Spies from the Shadows.
---
Also, what does his power actually do besides  turn himself into a cloud?
---
Had this happen to me. I had to fully repair 3 gens and after the match it chnaged to rescuing 3 survivors from the hook with Ace.
---
It just changes mid-game to another daily
---
Don’t you dare. &gt;:C
---
I literally always check that chest. Lol. I think you’d be surprised how many survivors will actually wander down there for some goodies.
---
I've had 1 spawn under my feet once.
---
i thought the meg was being cocky then i realised she accidentally vaulted to the killer's side
---
Basement Bubba intensifies
---
and do you expect rank 20 killers to know how to play agaists rank 1-4 survivors?
---
For the killer, it was a gamble. You either get normal teams, or a group of a few high ranks playing with a low rank player
---
now you can choose. if you queue with a high rank player, you'll face higher ranks. If you don't want to, you don't.
---

---
So playing as a Killer I got called out for "camping" when I had a survivor on a hook, with the gate open, and the Hook was very near the open gate. I was running back and forth between the gate and the hook. Is this actually camping or were they just salty? 3 out of 4 still escaped.
---
Why is everything so wide?
---
Thinking the same!
---
The Game is full of safe pallets, but not much else. If your team is fast on gens and doesn't waste pallets too quickly, then you have a great advantage. If the team can't work through ruin, you are boned. Once those pallets run out, it's not looking good for the survivors.
---
If you feel like you can survive long enough to get hatch, sure. Otherwise you’d putting a target on you cause lots of people just dislike key holders.
---
That sucks, that hasn't happened to me yet. I've only had it change when I join a lobby or open my rituals in a lobby
---
If I buy a killer, do I have to play that killer to unlock their perks?
---
The wiki says a perk can be unlocked, but, how?
---
**You can rip my Beerfest pants out of my cold, dead, deformed hands.**
---
You are not an airplane it’s not necessary to announce your departure.
---
Level them up to lvl 30, 35, and 40, each one unlocks one of the three perks unique to that killer, you must get the red perks that show up during that bloodweb, and if you level up your other killers, eventually it may show up in their bloodweb

One thing is you don't really learn how to play killer as Spirit.
---
The thing about Spirit is that she is strongest when you already have a lot of game knowledge. I will say though, that Stridor has hurt me more than helped me when I play Spirit, you might try replacing that with a stronger perk.
---
He teleported up and left through the gate, the 2 others disconnected and I left through the hatch
---
Kinda pointless. Also Laurie and Bill have really good perks so why would you not just level them to 40 for teachables?
---
I don't play them either but they are both 40 for the perks.
---
OPS mad coz bad lul ^(/s)
---
oh maybe they adjusted it a bit then because I'm *certain* it was a thing, once upon a time at least. From experience...
---
One singular rank 1-4 survivor breaks the game?
---
Rank doesn't mean shit.
---
You could try looking for the hex totem?
---
*all 4 survivors in basement*

**WHATS IN THERE?!?!?**

I will
---
For a second I thought he wasn’t going to see you and teabag the corpse, classic Ghost Face
---
When the gates are open and the timer is halfway down, no time lol
---
I never said I was using constructive criticism you daft bastard. My point was that THERE IS NO POINT IN ME MAKING ACTUAL CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM BECAUSE NONE OF YOU WILL CARE. So, therefore, I resorted to a 'tantrum' status.
---
[RUN BABY DWIGHT RUN!](https://imgur.com/a/zDbhPQ4)
---
Or dodge the lobby like the way it's been. There's no way for a survivor to know what rank killer they're going to get.
---
Yes because everyone who wants to play a game casually wants to dump in hours of time into video tutorials and kyf games.
---
Wait, the fragrances don't grant the BP after the trial?
---
*My life is a lie...*
---
How many bloodpoints did you get (estimated)?
---
Have they announced a time it’ll be available? I’m just clicking and crying.
---
Has happened to me too on Xbox. Lost about 2 hours of progress. Send in a support ticket on DbD’s website.
---
Bruh, for a random, no way.
---
Played against a 3 blink nurse on badham. We were in the preschools basement and she blinked into a pallet I dropped. During her stun the last two gens pop and my adrenaline activates and heals me, I guess she didn't want to play anymore
---
Rank 2 keep getting matched with 17-20 rank killers. I feel bad until I'm camped for my full hook lol
---
Just gonna play another game for the time being, ive had bad matchmaking but its never been this bad
---
you are a very fun person
---
Current mood.
---
What sucks is that I can't sleep now do to excitement.
---
Now that you mention it, prior to her hitting me, the red stain does move back towards the window rather quickly. So you might be right that she was actually vaulting the window right before she hit me. My friend also said the ping was spikey. Keep in mind I didn't feel any sort of lag on my side.
---
**i need my fookin achievement why else would i be on a gen this unsafe**
---
My bad hehe its late here 
---
Maybe even the other demogorgon perk so they will be exhausted coming off a gen?
---
Exactly but the game doesnt take that into account so the game rewards emblems as if it were a normal game
---
thats the joke dude, literally the entire joke
---
Either midnight PDT or when it’s 09/24 for everyone on Earth

\&gt;Rank 1 Toxic Nea ques with two Rank 10's (Deranked from 1) and a Rank "18"
---
\&gt;Match with Rank 1 PIII Godnurse with an Ebony Mori
---
\&gt;Surprised Pikachu
---
A bigger deal is that during the first 40 seconds of working on a gen (solo, anyway, and from 0) your exhaustion perk isn't recharging if it was used up earlier.  If you are keeping good gen pressure up, you will end up with far more time where exhaustion perks are not recharging.
---
Is it the best thing ever?  No.  But it helps apply gen pressure of a form, where it makes sitting on the gen when the killer is nearby more risky.  I'd probably buff it to be the last 50% of a gen, rather than the first 50%, to make it more powerful and make sitting on a gen when the killer is close to finish it riskier, but the perk is fine as an idea.
---
Pay attention to what he's doing, If he isn't actively stalking a teammate don't reveal him, There's a high chance he's just baiting a reveal.
---
Where on earth has anyone said matchmaking is balanced.
---
Literally whole subreddit and devs have openly said it's broke...?
---
All I'm saying is it was disappointing to play like a champ and get bupkis
---
I know. Its just not funny.
---
Quadruple false rank 20 is fucked
---
:(
---
Well it is considered "area camping" but the premises of camping in general is just salty survivers in reality. As killer, it it your job to kill, not to baby survivers and follow their obviously one sided ru
---
I just yank them off the gen...
---
We need New Nightmare Freddy
---
Whats wglf stand for?
---
I’ve heard dozens of people say there’s nothing wrong with it
---
You generally aren't teleporting on CD anyway.  Having more power fresh after a teleport is better in that case.
---
WAZZZUP
---
As long as you are polite (no teabagging) I generally let everyone live. I’d rather them get the 5000 blood points than me getting a few for sacrificing all of them. Plus, I feel like it helps people get a break and hopefully keeps them from being toxic. Although I have face camped people as leatherface for teabagging and regret nothing.
---
They need to stop makin all his purple cosmetics cells only
---
Slender man would be fucking lit for a killer
---
Look like you got wacked.  That’s why you don’t fuck with the mafia
---
Not sure how exactly you mean that, you get their 3 teachable points at level 1 automatically, for them and them only. You need to get to levels 30, 35 and 40 for those perks to become available for other killers in their bloodwebs.
---
I've had the same thing happen to me with Claudette, and it was almost a death too
---
Imagine thinking omegablink ebony mori nurse is weak lmao.

I'm sure this is just something that's said in everyone of these types of threads but this is the first time I've heard that and it's hilarious
---
Just you wait till they add Tunnel Bandit
---
The clown my dude.
---
no, the topic was emoji usage. You forgot your own replies
---
It makes the sound of injured survivors 100% louder so yes. However Iron Will isn't a true counter to Spirit and not a whole lot of survivors run it anyways as it's not worth running just for 1 killer.
---
Poor killer got cucked by bad RNG
---
Take the "camper" accusation with a grain of salt, especially when said by people who just lost the match. Most will throw it at you simply for not staying on the other side of the map while they heal under the hook.
---
No the topic was a mad grit demogorgon lol 😛 a not serious topic at all?
---
yea not gonna argue for 15 hours about obvious shit. see ya man
---
Very true! ATM the ranking system is super messed up as well as matchmaking being garbage. However, the survivors played extremely well and the rank 2s looped me for a bit but whenever they started i would just leave so that they would waste time healing instead of gens. They were a very good SWF group and overall they did very good. The only issue I personally had was that the Rank 13 Meg kept flashlight clicking at me during the beginning of the match, so i didnt have much sympathy for her (did not tunnel fyi), which is why she was first to die :3
---
#BUT NOT THIS MAN! GET BACK IN THERE TEAR!
---
MAY QUEEN!!!
---
Uh.. what?
---
In that same light then, how come they don't work with Demogorgon either?
---
&gt; shes the single most powerful killer in the game so the devs nerf her at every chance they get to keep the game playable
---
Can't tell if you're rank 20 or being sarcastic

According to the stats BHVR released, you'd be waiting probably hours.

new meme template confirmed

You replied to the Emoji Police message and that's what the current thread you're replying to is about. Don't change the topic all of the sudden like that.
---
about Mad Grit on demo, it's cool.
---
not gonna feed the troll anymore, see ya man
---
Did you read the journal entry?
---
I like using BBQ, Save the Best for Last, Bitter Murmur, and my guilty pleasure, Blood Hound. I just love being able to track them regardless of whether or not they run after I hit them.
---
I'm going to say yes. Your connection was fine up until the point you juked him.
---
Also, you'll see one of your team mates disconnected. However, there was no noise. If there's no noise to go along with the DC, that means their connection legitimately dropped. Ergo, the killer's the one with connection issues and that caused them to drop.
---
90% sure yes. Report it.
---
Man you are dense.
---
How many more counters do you need?? Also repeat after me - there.are.3.other.survivors.to.chase.
---
Ok?? Goodnight?? Finally lol 😂
---
That is wrong, and in fact, the opposite
---
Sacastic my guy, if there were a way to describe something as more sarcastic than entirely and ultimately sarcastic, i would.
---
This change is insane. A lot of killers are going to be happy because this solves their problem, but it's now literally impossible for me to play with a lot of my friends list. You can't play against red rank killers with mid-low rank survivors, they'll just get obliterated in seconds. If I play with anyone of significantly lower rank they won't be able to have fun at all. The days of introducing new players to the game are over.  
---
  
---
The rank average system was not the problem. The problem was a mixture of rank reset, a poor matchmaking algorithm, and tons of bugs. Literally every game uses an averaging system for matchmaking because everyone else has come to the conclusion that it's the most fair.  
---
If anyone wants so shit on low rank killers, they're still going to. They'll just de-rank or use a smurf account. They just took a shot at those guys, missed, and hit all the casual players.
---
Only tunneling Wraiths. And Doctors. God I hate Doctors
---
Thank you for the info! I saw a YouTube video talking about how michael’s perks aren’t that great. The only teachable I have is rancor (my friend suggested I get it) but it seems like it’s kind of a waste. I’ve been using bitter murmur and noed consistently. The other thing I’m never certain about is what ad-ons to use.  Whenever I have both pwyf and save best for last I feel like I always mess up with the obsession. It’s either I get a whack in the beginning and lose tokens or I do what the perks are supposed to do but then when all gens are done I can never find my obsession. Thank you again for your suggestions tho!
---
Yes it's based on her TR. That's also why M&amp;A would be bad on here and Distressing is an underrated budget Prayer Beads.
---
Her TR is 24m. With Distressing it's 30m. Put on Whispers and whenever Whispers activates, just walk forward 2-3 more steps and phase.
---
I got the same thing
---
And meanwhile I’m on a level 41 legion and have yet to even get level one. “Uncommon” my ass
---
Yes it does!!
---
I got the physical version from Gamestop at 9 o'clock and have yet to find a match and get many errors for online services for now. It's better to wait for now, trust me.

Argh! Lucky!!!!! Wish I could at least play the tutorial and get my 50k bloodpoints to start leveling :(
---
I have a super toxic brother who genuinely thinks he's extremely good in everything he plays. He sometimes plays overwatch and ALWAYS blames his team. Before we got dead by daylight he used to play Identity V and thought that his experience in it would help him in DBD. He only plays survivor and loses basically every game. Why? "Killers are OP since survivors don't have special powers too"
---
He said there are "tons of counters to DS", I was just curious what he thought they where...
---
Please tell me I am comprehending this correctly. So the highest ranked SWF survivor is the one who essentially determines the killer rank the group will go against?
---
You mean Devour Hope or possibly Rancor? Dying Light has nothing to do with one hit downs.
---
Well I dont wanna talk to someone who is disgusting enough to play spirit with prayer beads bracelet
---
when is the blood point event?
---
Unleash her on the randoms of the DBD community... lol. Can you get a new account for her so she can play with newbies as well or not? GL though
---
Devotion 1 level 17
---
I mean yeah i get it but why should i have to go easy on survivers so they can get their BP? I just don't see why i have to cater to what are suppost to be my victims
---
You have to be really proactive. Always try to be doing the thing that will benefit the team most, be it gens, unhooks or a long chase. 
---
Don’t worry about shit games where you just die real fast because there will be a lot of those.
---
This is totally me when I try having a relaxed game as killer and I get gen rushed and looped till daylight and the survivors bully me in the endgame chat
---
Ah, I see now. Sorry.
---
Yeah, I meant that I might like a perk, but not the killer that it comes with. 
---
I'm going over them all now and it's really hard to decide.
---
2 days ago I matched against red rank swf with 4x borrowed time and ds. Im rank 17
---
I've been getting opposite. I'm a rank 12 killer and I get a lot of rank 18-20 survivors
---
As long as SWF remains unchanged, Nurse is kinda necessary. Nurse and Spirit are the only killers that stand any kind of a chance against a really good, coordinated SWF team.
---
Once they address SWF's inherent imbalances, then they need to adjust Nurse, Spirit and maybe Billy. But certainly not before.
---
Already found the answer. Changes to Demogorgon. Being able to break pallets with his base shred instead of using add on
---
it's 1 am
---
&gt;On top of the servers being so overloaded that there is constant lag in every single match.
---
This is exactly why BHVR doesn't listen at all to those posts...
---
26-30 september
---
I would drop Stridor and Thana. Practice being able to navigate with her power without Stridor will free it up for another perk like whispers or Eduring. Thana doesnt do yourself much favor as at max usage it gives a 16% gen repair speed decrease which turns a 80s solo gen repair to a 92s solo gen repair so its not all that useful on its own especially since its rare to have all 4 injured at one time for any useful amount of time. At the same time like u/a_angry_bunny said you wont improve as a killer as her youll only improve as her as she's very different form the rest of the killers. So playing the long game practice and improve as an M1 killer ghostface/wraith/trapper/doctor ect try to avoid starting with killers like spirit/nurse/billy/huntress as theyre relatively special inhow they operate and those skills dont transfer well to other killers. A lot a tricks you can do with the basic M1 killers can tranfer in a way to most the other killers. So learn an M1 or 2 and apply what youve learned about how survivors react to you to spirit.
---
Thank you kind sir!
---
Salty end tho
---
Yikes. Anime profile pic
---
That’s gotta be the best survivor I’ve ever seen.
---
You're a part of the problem, stop feeding them salt and stop posting this shit year. Just ignore them
---
Thank you for clarifying.
---
Now this is relatable
---
*gets 5x streamers
---
*facecamps pr slugs
---
*ends the game with 11k BP
---
It's a game. You do what you want to have fun and I think everyone would have more fun in a drawn out game for more bloodpoints. They aren't actually your victims, Satan.
---
A know many many people 18-30 years old that own a switch
---
Green about to be completed? Counter it by going to protect another one
---
This guy is right... The description of party streamers is:
---
&gt;Grants 100% bonus Bloodpoints in all Categories for all Players
---
It doesn't say "Grants 2x Bloodpoints". So if you combine an event with streamers, you only get 300%, not 400%.
---
I love the game, it's seriously my favourite map. But I understand that people have different tastes, but I seem to be the only person that likes every map and every killer/survivor. People need to learn to stop complaining.
---
This is being fixed today (It's 6:30am in the EU rn) so all should be good. SWFs will match with the highest rank in the SWF Group.
---
What an absurd post
---
People see twitch streamers and youtubers saving BPS for double bp events and assume it means more points... it just shows bigger number because 200% &lt; 300%... you should use BPS when you're tryharding for points and/or at low rank.
---
&gt;Killers are literally never stronger
---
I hate using party streamers because whenever I use them the survivors just gen rush the shit out of me and say shit like ”gg ez”
---
I don't think this is a good move. Out of my friend group, I play the most out by far (I average around rank 8 as Survivor). The others hover around ranks 20-16, since they just don't put in the same hours as I do. They're going to get really frustrated and turned off from the game if they're constantly matched with purple ranks that they realistically shouldn't be going against.
---
And at the bottom should be opening an exit gate as the final survivor.
---
Pennywise confirmed leak
---
I always try to help my friends rank up and if this hotfix happen, maybe i cant. My rank is 2 and all my friends rank 16-20. And they'll face killer rank pupple or red Jesus
---
Just hit D5 tonight. ^_^
---
Stevie honey, I'm sorry this crazy person compares you to that fugliness personification.
---
Those players are unlikely to be reading this, but I appreciate the sentiment :)
---
I just found it funny that they got mad at me for lunging and using freddy's power, and then said that they were a killer man, as if they couldn't be salty lol
---
Im a frayed knot
---
In this predicament - do the experienced survivors want their team mates to gen rush as the killer face camps? Assuming the killer isn’t getting baited to leave the hook and no one has a perk that will give them a chance. Legit question. 
---
I run BT when I survive because of how annoying a suicidal save could be for the one on the hook.
---
How does the killer not have a choice when they can literally decide who they want to play with by dodging?
---
It is funny, but they're looking for a reaction and you're feeding them that. If everyone ignored them they wouldn't bother sending messages
---
Yeah, I agree. I definitely came off as salty when I didn't mean to, I just couldn't believe what I was reading.
---
IDK you simply got outplayed
---
Just wait until tomorrow. Demo has tons of potential and only really suffers from pallet looping, but once he gains the power to shred pallets I think it's going to make a world of difference.
---
Yeah it's a shame :(
---
But the devs definitely have a say on what gets to happen first. Bug fixes or cosmetics. The devs are the ones who promote things, and they’re always promoting dlcs/cosmetics over patches and other things. For the money, at least so it seems
---
How’s he not much of a threat? Doesn’t his  very existence make stealth useless?
---
Swap him out with Nancy, then we're good xD
---
Hot nurse Freddy anyone?
---
I don't understand the memtality that bhvr have to fix issues in dbd before releasing switch version. I imagine they have completely seperate departments for the two.
---
It's creative commons.  
---
He can claim he has rights to shit, but as the ENTIRE SCP COMMUNITY quickly pointed out, that doesn't mean he actually does.
---
*Fucking stop your heresy*
---
That is true. This is my first time getting a salty message for no reason, so I guess I just fed into them for no reason. I'll make sure not to do that next time, so thanks for the advice!
---
I think playing against those types of killers will definitely help them learn. Quickly lol they could always watch some YouTube videos and learn that way too
---
If me and the bois put bloody party streamers the killer always have a Mori...
---
I feel zero stress playing survivor because I don't care as much about that rank, highest I've reached in survivor was Rank 5 when my friend bought the game and I spent a lot more time playing SWF than playing killer which I spend most of my time in. Reached rank 2 as a combination of Ghostface and Wraith before the rank reset hit a couple of months ago. 
---
It's easy to just discount your rank and take losses at Red ranks in theory, but in practice it makes the game feel much less enjoyable and my play frequency plummets as the season goes on. I find that I can basically only play my favourite role if I'm playing when I'm absolutely focused and not tired, because even one missed swing at red ranks can be the difference between winning and losing. Sure, it's good to have a challenge, don't get me wrong, but by the same token it can be hard to embrace that challenge when the people on the other end often try so hard to make you feel awful if you ever do make a mistake. 
---
I think the biggest reason for survivor feeling less stressful is the fact that your accountability for failure falls upon 4 people, whereas the killer has only themselves to blame for mistakes. For all the other things that negatively impact the killer we'd need a lot more time and thought to break it down effectively. All I'll say is that survivors have it pretty good right now. 
---
At least their perks aren't absolutely required and don't rely on good prop spawns to actually allow the game to let the killer play at a pace that is fair, and not at a pace that allows the survivor team to have 1/5th of their main objectives complete in the time it takes the killer to complete 1/12th of their own.
---
 "Look there's a bird, dude and it knows what's good. I'm telling you, I just heard it inside."
---
*"Suuuh dood"*
---
Is pretty much what I thought when watching this.
---
Everyone complains about the new survivors voice and screams. Just be happy that the game is getting new content and shut your yaps about tiny details
---
Sorry mate, looks like you got  OUT SKILLED
---
Nah for real tho, lag switchers truly are scum
---
I’ve gotta say, this bug with the matchmaking makes me feel bad for playing swf. Since the people I usually play with sit in the red ranks and I’m in them too, we suddenly are getting from a mediocre Rank 16, to a first match rank 20.
---
I’d never see the day where I feel bad for playing a video game.
---
I think they actually said it was due to engine constraints. If it was to avoid censorship they could just tone it down in those regions.
---
I just mean, what would you want to happen if no one is running BT and the killer doesn’t leave? You’d be cool with dying on hook and letting survivors gen rush? 
---
Just wondering. I’ve had close and no-good calls both getting unhooked and doing the unhooking.
---
The only ones I can really make out are aftercare and prove thyself
---
And then someone disconnects before the game loads.
---
This post gave me an erection, my last 5 games were all against red ranks I'm rank 9.
---
If I die because no one could safety get me off hook, I'd have no problem with that. They could have escaped rather than the killer getting a 4k.
---
Are you trying to kill people from jumpscares alone? That SOUNDS horrifying especially on a map like cornfield farm
---
It should have its mouth open so it’s hissing lol
---
Damn good show. If I was that myers (and I have been b4 lol) I’d be mad af at first then appreciate the skill lmao. And not a tbag in sight.
---
Actually a bit spooky lol
---
suddenly I have flashbacks of a Samination video
---
This hat is hiding my best features.
---
How do you think the devs pay employees? Some bugs take longer to fix than others. Most games there is usually a big patch in between every update so that as many bugs possible is fixed then. BHVR probably make a huge batch of cosmetics and wait for a specific day to release the sets.
---
Either way, would you rather get new content or just a bunch of bug fixes until everything is fixed even if it could take a year or more?
---
Enjoy staying below rank 10, fucking loser.
---
If rank meant any skill whatsoever a rank 15 killer would get steamrolled by a rank 8 survivor. They usually do, besides SWF should be weighted even higher since the game still isn't exactly balanced around it (granted it was WAY worse before but some shit just doesn't work the way they should with SWF and BHVR won't ever be able to trully balance it)
---
It's Bing Bong Man, Dam it!
---
Get it right.
---
I would rather them fix the bugs. Because clearly their content is breaking the game lmao.
---
*laughs in not actually having 5fps but 6fps*
---
This sounds good until you realize that matchmaking is still broken and solo queue red ranks get paired with greens and above all the time.
---
"Oh, Nvm it was Dwight coming over to finally help"
---
Legen... wait for it....dary.
---
It’s more terrifying with Wraith
---
Lmao Doc's confusion is priceless
---
lol just got done getting tbagged by ghostface before reading this
---
I do it when people discuss using coldwind or haddonfield offerings. They deserve it.
---
I mean it is stupid as fuck that Freddy can just mindlessly throw snares down with no slowdown. It's stupid and requires no skill. Why play clown at all? Freddy needs to have a set number if snares so killers are more careful with them.
---
They're working on it. I believe tomorrow's hot fix will patch it up.
---
Quote: "The 3.2.0 patch introduced an issue that caused Survive With Friends group matchmaking to be skewed towards Rank 20, which is also fixed with this change."
---
Wow I am not sure if this is just bad internet connection or console servers are just that bad... but that sucks.
---
Idk why I was downvoted a little bit. Acting and voice acting are entirely different jobs
---
With one you have a full script surrounded by props and other actors setting a tone
---
And the other is some dude yelling into a microphone in some booth
---
Last weekend when the game was free-to-play on steam I played with two firends who has never heard of DBD. Almost everygame I got both my friends out of the trial. I've been rank one survivor for a year straight before a break (now rank 16 as I haven't played survivor this summer) and the killers we faced was rank 20-13.   
---
I let the killers get a hit once in a while so they kept staying interested of downing me and looped them for 1-4 gen easily and if my friend got down I used flashlight to set him free. It was not nice for the killers but I wanted to teach my friends all I knew and now they are hooked for the game and both of them bought it. Bottom line is, one survivor can ruin killer's game alone and it is not fun for the killer.
---
I fuckin hate those rituals...
---
My survivor mortality rate is probably 80% and why would I take 25k for something I can't do well when I can get 30k for pressing M2 as the doctor a few times?
---
Sorry, I have to agree with them though. Just because youre trapper doesn't mean you have to place traps down! The correct way to play the game is to only press M1 and nothing else. How fun!
---
I thought this was an offering that was gonna let you just kill yourself in a trial.
---
*Boy, was I wrong.*
---
Blessings of the shadow upon ye
---
When you say “gg” to your opponents it means you’re saying they either A: did a good job beating you or B: put up a good fight. Gging isn’t exclusive to teammates
---
Do you realize that modeling, texturing, designing, whatever the f involves developing cosmetics has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with bug fixing? You do realize that whoever does cosmetics can't possibly fix bugs even if they wanted to right? They simply don't know, its like asking a eletrician to fix your house's plumbing.
---
The guys creating cosmetics are most likely generating more revenue than their salaries, therefore they are essentially funding people who bug fix the game... If you think they need to do more reworks, more development time in each expansion its one thing, whoever develop new content could work on those but they simply can't because BHVR is a company that needs to make money.
---
You should reply that to the other person.
---
Yea it was confusing as hell too
---
Rip papa franku
---
Was that guy literally blind and deaf??
---
They're fixing this next patch, no worries
---
Just really bad connection.
---
Clown's has a pretty big AoE though, and not only that, it affects multiple survivors and stays for a while, but Freddy's only effect one person and disappears immediately afterwards AND tou have to be in the dream world for it to work in the first place.
---
Saying EZ is definitely shitty as hell, but saying good game when the opposing team had no chance in hell feels bad too, even if you didn't intend it that way.
---
Hawkins's pallets are quantity over quality
---
Pretty much all of them can be mind gamed without too much trouble
---
Still no fix for rank up error that ruined the game for a small chunk of playerbase
---
And yet they still downvoted you
---
I like this bug. Removed my crappy 2 sacrifices with the legion, got a 2 sacrifices with Trapper. Exited out and went back in and it changed to kill one survivor by your hand with Nurse. Delicious 😍
---
Also inner strength is an option. In fact, replace Self Care and Pharmacy with Inner Strength and Solidarity.  
---
Self Care and Pharmacy both have secondary effects that are MARGINALLY useful.
---
lmao I OBVIOUSLY know the people who do cosmetics can’t fix bugs. It’s what the DEVS decide to push out. Cosmetics/dlcs vs bug fixes. And in MY opinion, it always seems as though they want the content out before the fixes.
---
Makes the Tunnel skill take longer to charge.
---
how can you be upset at getting over 60k points? thats a good match, unless youre going for the adept trophy theirs no reason to be upset
---
You would think they would’ve put this from the start XD guess they just like the new hunters to turn into spirits and nurses
---
&gt;NOED is just poorly designed. Gens need to take longer so that games take longer but slowing down everything else survivors have to do without giving them any type of advantage for it (ie. longer time on hooks) is also pretty bullshit.
---
In high ranks isn't even a problem. That's why, by the data, red ranks don't use it, it's a waste of a perkslot. It might be poorly designed, yes, for how easy it is to be destroyed tho
---
&gt;With loops it feels like bHVR just either makes a map so bad that as a survivor you want to DC on it (Unless you have BL which is a MASSIVE problem in itself with a lot of loops) or as killer maps with such safe pallets that you just have to give up and waste all momentum.
---
Whats BL?
---
Anyway I never seen a map so bad for survivors that you want to dc. Like, never. I'd like to see some example since I don't know a single map that oppressive for survivors that you wanna dc. Maybe the game, but even there is a big maybe since it has a lot of safe pallets.
---
As killer in the other hand I see many maps that sucks, especially for certain killers like huntress or Billy which can struggle in maps like lerry.
---
&gt;bHVR just needs to do a massive rework on a lot of things when it comes to balance and I think they just can't feasible fit the time in to do it
---
Most of it, imo, is about map design. Many perks has been created to fix poorly designed maps which needs less safe pallets, more unsafe and number of pallets at the same time. Cut some vaults rng and that's it
---
I don’t understand why you’re getting so hostile? The devs push out what THEY want to push out. What they think will make them money. That’s how any developer who’s money hungry is lmao so you’re completely missing the point and being a straight ass for no reason; how sad.
---
Jesus, you know it's a game right? 
---
Also if you paid attention to the set up, the enemy is the entity, not each other. The killers are as much victims as the survivors are.
---
This is so sad, alexa play despacito
---
*Hippitty hoppity you're now my property*
---
It'll be harder to sell cosmetics to players who leave when the game is falling apart around them. They gotta really go hard on operational health, game's been out for 3 years FFS
---
The last time I suggested stealth was a viable means of gameplay, I got downvote-bombed. It's all about the loops over here.
---
But seriously, while he counters stealth, he can barely keep up a chase, and looping tends to be Plan A for many Survivors once the ranks go up.
---
Imagine complaining about a killer using their power
---
This comment is pretty difficult to understand
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Fragrant_Bog_Laurel
---
It names a category. That means it's in-game. Which means it's capped at 8k.
---
This is why I always run DS when i'm playing solo survivor, and when i'm playing killer I never punish the dude getting unhooked for his teammate's selfishness. The only time someone should be going for that kind of an unhook is if the person on the hook is about to hit stage 2 or die anyway.
---
The other day as killer I hooked someone, started a new chase, and this dude decided to run straight to the hook hoping I would help him screw over his teammate. When I didn't take the bait and ignored the dude who got unhooked he DC'd lmao.
---
You're so trash that you apparently used both snares and dream pallets
---
Same :^)
---
I'm guessing he facecamped you...
---
Except it would make no difference?
---
Another good thing about injuring people is that they're a lot easier to hear/track with the blood, alongside them spending time healing up instead of repairing a gen. So what I do is that if I down someone and I see someone else close by I will go after them for about 20ish seconds and if I hit them great, if not I double back and make sure to hook the person on the ground. 
---
Also if someone is running Decisive Strike, you can leave them on the ground for 60 seconds and it will timeout so they can no longer use it. That's why sometimes it can pay off to leave the survivor on the ground and just patrol the area and see if anyone is nearby (just don't go cross-map as someone will definitely go in for the healing save on the downed person)
---
mad lad escaped too
---
Damn. Good on you for killing two of them though
---
killer has left the death garden
---
Nobody said it was a well-balanced game. It's intended to be competitive, and a large portion of the community treats it that way.
---
And no, that's not how it works. When I buy a game, I expect to get that game, not half of it. If I bought it before the DLC came out, I don't expect to have GAMEPLAY locked away from me, either. How is this acceptable to people? How much do you think this game is worth, because it's pushing AAA pricing with all the DLC by now.
---
You want to sell something, sell cosmetics. Recinding full access to the game is scummy and the grind to unlock even one character is an insult.
---
*Oooo, got games on yer phone? *
---
you cant lose 2 pips unless you DC, something you wanna tell us?

Hey there! I'm an Aussie chick that has been streaming in UK time zones and looking for some feedback on a match video I did [here on my youtube](https://youtu.be/K0U7JG9hJUY). Positive or negative, I really appreciate any feedback that can help me out! This time I focused more on commentary but if I should be chattering more or anything else please let me know so I can improve :)
---
No
---
baby survivor
---
A little sad since I play with my rank 19 buddy and my rank 18 wife.  (I’m at 7 right now.) I never tried to dominate the easy killers and would let them hook me at the end if they were really struggling.
---
Didn’t Otz get this like a month ago?
---
~~you forgot to reverse the addons to make it even more shit~~
---
I went up against a guy in my newer days, and this is my only encounter of a "gg ez" killer so far, but he got a 4k and in post-match chat said, "gg ez, fucking noobs, always near or on a gen!" like ??? do u even know the objective of the game??
---
So they effectively got 600% BP on this match
---
finally indeed! i once went up against a 3-man swf: 2 red ranks and 1 grey rank 
---
(I WAS RANK 13 AT THE TIME)
---
Hate to be that guy but...... what’s the Sauce?
---
Why don't you send it him instead of asking of asking someone to do it for you?
---
People still crying over noed in 2019.. really?
---
Use Google, these daily posts about noed are getting boring
---
We're making efforts to remove ANY end-game chats, salty or not, whether or not names have been censored. Sorry folks.
---
2-63
---
Happy otzdarva noises
---
Dont worry baby the bottles almost warm
---
I wish babysitter told the person you unhook that they have babysitter
---
they just have to like notice that they have no blood trail
---
BPS is additive, you bring one= you get 200% of all BP gains,  2=300%,  3=400%,  4=500%,  5=600%,         if you add a fully stacked BBQ'n chili, you get 700% of BP's!
---
Red ranks don't use noed. I wonder why
---
Maybe because get always cleansed? Rank up before crying and use Google. There are so many posts Daily about noed by rank 15 survivors that's insane
---
Where have you seen this?? Is there a link?
---
Pretty goOD JOB SO FAR
---
You are right. I know that. But 1k hours in the game I'm just tired of insidious camping leatherfaces who think it's fun to camp people to death on the first hook althought they have been spotted and their tactic obviously does not work. People who play fairly (no matter how good or bad) always get a "gg" and sometimes a piece of advice.
---
This is precisely why I keep psn messages on. So entertaining!
---
That's not the first time they've claimed that Matchmaking will be fixed. Watch it get EVEN WORSE!!
---
Aww
---
The big meat grinder (?) That a gen usually spawns by, you run up the stairs and hop over the safety fence on top and slide down
---
If you're watching YouTube before the game starts, then that is completely on you for not scoping things out. That isn't a problem with basic mechanics of the game.
---
Yeah, I like playing with my friends because it also reduces queue times. Red rank survivors are booty late at night when I play with friends, and I don't want everyone to wait.
---
After writing it yeah enduring with her might not be best for her and I suggested steering away from him because of the chainsaw. Practicing general dbd game knowledge, I think, is best done with charaters that dont have built in 1 shots. I suggested ghostface as his stalk is pretty hit or miss.
---
Then you get tunneled and camped to death for a grand total of 3500 BP
---
he didn’t even get the chance to hook me
---
i get it, but playing with my low rank friends is gonna suck now. can’t exactly teach them the game if they’ll just get continuously crushed. wish bhvr could have gotten the average rank system working as intended.
---
*well structured argument*
---
**nah bruh, I don't care. I don't like him therefore he sucks**
---
Such a poor future for that character   
---
I'm a bill main and i never did this idk why people do it
---
Nice.

---
Lol. Some play really oddly. Don't think some people understand when the killer isn't being toxic y'know
---
If my friend every find out about this change they will never play with me again lol (I'm mostly Rank 9, they are Rank 15-18 and already complain that I'm too high)
---
It spawns there quick often actually.
---
Haha balls of steel.
---
Let's get high.
---
I feel ya by they have to learn on their own. They can't just keep crutching on you to save them, they have to learn by themselves.
---
absolute mad lad
---
goodjob
---
And you get hooked with kindred perk on while the other 3 survivors are tbagging the exit gate.
---
At least its not nea. I swear she looks like billies younger sister
---
This is always the case. Survivors bring more points and the killer slugs everyone asap and we all die on first hook. He gets 11k points and de-pips. Nice.

There’s a ton of new players right now. I’ve been playing with them all day and they don’t think about unhooking safely and half the time are just trying to figure out what to do in general. :/
---
Other games don't let the highest rating players play with the lowest one. Is that what you want? You can already choose not to. The only people who have a choice there are the survivors choosing to play together.
---
I agree that a weighted system is better but this is way better than them getting a rank 15/16 killer that if rank meant anything would absolutely get demolished alone by the rank 1.
---
&gt; In what world is a survivor escaping against a rank 1 killer with green rank teammates.
---
In a world where r1 killer has 200 hours and every green rank survivor has 2k+ hours in the game. 
---
In a world where players on both sides do their best to stay out of red ranks to play for fun, but skilled enough to be r1
---
In a world where a players with hundred hours can legitimately stay at yellow ranks for months.
---
This change will be tough for SWFs with total newbies playing with veterans. But for regular mix I don't see this as a big problem. Definitely not a disaster.
---
The thing is you can use the shred to mindgame. Because you aren't seriously slowed when you charge it--if at all--and the jump comes out so fast, it's really easy to just bring up your power for a quick second but then stow it mid-chase.
---
I've gotten a lot of people to try to spin around and run towards me when I go to "shred", but it was just a bamboozle to put themselves in melee range. Or go to "shred" a window or pallet so they will run past or through it. The *threat* of it is just as valuable as actually using it since it intimidates people from using escape routes (sorta like how Clown can zone people with his gas).
---
Now that's what we got now, now remember that wereas before you could provoke people into an early drop by lining up your shred, now they have to question if it's worth it or not since you will always be able to destroy the pallet. If you act like you will shred but don't, you could make the survivor keep going under the assumption you will jump to the pallet and try to break it, but you don't and now they've cut the loop too short and you can get a hit on them.
---
Of course it all depends on how you handle it, but threat of being able to instantly destroy a pallet if they drop it early will absolutely make survivors make mistakes.
---
I play both on ps4, and as crazy as it sounds; I think some killers are kinda OP cause of how bad the lag is.  With killer being host the survivors take the lag worse.
---
Rank 5 Survivor
---
Rank 7 Nurse RN
---
So im not awful, but im not optimal so maybe idk what Im talking about.  You guys can correct me if the lag is just my internet/console.
---
Lots of people like Nintendo who aren’t kids. 🙄

Not if you know what you're doing, 4 safe unhooks is 6k altruism already, do some healing and take some protection hits and it's easily maxed. Objective is even easier, you just need to double stack on a gen and the points fly in.
---
Instead of the normal terror radius, the ground quakes if within 32m of her.
---
did you have fun though??
---
mm is broke bad yes
---
This will give you 500% bonus. Blood hunt doesn’t double this and give 1000% if that’s what you’re assuming. You’ll get the same bonus for this offering if you use it today or during the event
---
Why fortnut. U had the minecraft chance
---
So when does it spawn? I play killer and survivor. does it spawn at 3 gens it when all three survs are down? I swear I’ve seen it as killer spawned before there’s only 1 surv?
---
Is this a “thing” now for killers to use lag switches?
---
Crazy how close these votes are. Any official source for or against either claim!?
---
I'm just memeing lol
---
Yeah.  You should just ignore it
---
Near perfect game too, nice.
---
People think kids these days are playing nintendo games... people that are playing nintendo games these days are those who grew up with it and now are 19-34 years old. I know 0 kids with a switch and a few adults.
---
It's quite common to hook someone, hook 2 other people, then hook the first guy again minutes later, and get called a tunneler. I've had it in multiple games.
---
Yeah, playing the game for at least 25 hours and 29 minutes. Added the minutes because that's how much it takes to find a match as killer jajajaja
---
almost all the time. sometime my item goes along with my bloodpoints too.
---
Very good point, hell even Tru3 proposed that ds should be disabled on the unhooked survivor if you hook somebody else.
---
To, thats impossible
---
Autohaven: Pallet Town
---
**Hawkins: Pallet City**
---
Agree. I play both, it’ll get better with time spent playing.... I hope.... hopefull no one is playing devour hope rn xD
---
It's OK, I understand. Its kinda like another situation in a different subreddit I get annoyed about, so I see why its annoying here.
---
yike
---
I would've cried if it was 5 tickets to the meat factory. This map sucks.
---
Switch version has an update.
---
Yeah Deep Silver I think.
---
Fuck those d00ds
---
Godamn U rekt them. Yisus... I bet they uninstalled
---
I once grinded out 1mil to level up Jake and get the Iron Will teachable, next day it was in the shrine. I don't play Jake or plan on playing him so that was quite a painful RIP of 1mil BP
---
911, I would like to report someone who just attacked me.
---
pharmacy with the no mither heal build is gigabrain
---
&gt;Prove Thyself: Should apply to you regardless of other survivors proximity
---
So the gens goes even quicker?.. absolutely not
---
&gt;Leader: Should apply to yourself (leaders have to perform after all)  
---
I can agree with that if lowering what you get a little
---
&gt;Adrenaline: Nerf to remain exhausted the rest of match and increase run time to 7 seconds instead of 5  
---
Overall buff. Adrenaline is fine. Give more time means reach the exit gates faster and safer since the killer won't reach you at all. That debuff is meaningless if he's already chasing you. It's just a buff to escape and it's not needed
---
&gt;Iron-Will: Apply to dying state or at least remove breathing inside lockers.
---
I'm not sure if calm spirit does that. If not I can agree with that on the dying state
---
&gt;Calm Spirit: Remove hag jump-scare camera pull, remove trap scream but leave aura (someone else's idea)
---
Why just counter completely killers powers mechanic? No.
---
&gt;Saboteur: Increase 30 seconds to 60 and / or increase sabo speed with toolbox
---
I would increase it to 60 too
---
&gt;Object of Obsession: No change needed imho but this is a shitbrick perk  
---
Not really if your objective is to get chased 24/7
---
&gt;WGLF: Needs to include heals or something and needs a generator counterpart  
---
No and no. You're asking for more free stacks and a perk that makes you get even more of an it? So you're gonna make 60k in a match(at least), you won't see a killer lobby anymore.
---
&gt;No Mither: Remove obvious visual slumpage so killer knows someone has it but not who
---
It's a challenge perk. That's why is obvious
---
&gt;Wake Up: Increase to 20/30/40 gate speed  
---
Too much
---
&gt;Vigil: Change to a healing function where the Vigil can heal away status effects including exposed?  
---
Cure exposed means destroy a perk or killer power without repercussion. No
---
&gt;Stake Out: Every 15 seconds you are in terror radius gain a token up to 5, repair and stuff 2% faster for each token lose all tokens when hit  
---
Dance with Me: Increase to 5 seconds
---
No. Means 10% speed, plus a toolbox means a free prove thyself making gens take 60s to complete. Dude, no
---
Dance with me it's fine as it is. Combined with lithe 3s are more than enough
---
&gt;Windows of Opportunity: No cooldown ffs it's just an aura for something we already know the location of
---
True. It's a newbie perk to help newcomers.
---
&gt;Boil Over: Increase wiggle meter by 5/10/15% not just wiggliness
---
Nope. Just nope. They already made hooks further apart from each other, with that you just can't be hooked with 1 person bodyblock (hit)
---
&gt;Diversion: 30 second cooldown timer, remove terror radius requirement
---
Idk about that. Maybe a less time into terror radius would be better
---
&gt;Poised: Add totems and unhooks and reduce to 2/4/6 seconds?
---
Nope. Especially with the new perk that gives you aura reading, the new one would be useless
---
&gt;Buckle Up: This whole thing is just nonsense. How about add dying survivor recovery 100%?
---
Nope. Won't make much difference and actually be worse
---
&gt;Head On: Well if it worked more often that'd be nice, but seems ok otherwise.
---
You have to make it work. It's meant to A stun a killer that is picking up a survivor close to a locker (hard) or B stun a killer that's checking different lockers (easy) or C which is the useless one, make the ds-head on combo
---
&gt;Mettle of Man: If you gain a protection hit or unhook a survivor in the match gain self-based borrowed time, one time use like unbreakable
---
One time use isn't an excuse. Even old ds was one time use, was op anyway
---
&gt;Better Together: Really great perk if you can actually get people to do gens together, put on a Discordance blocker and it'll be decent.
---
Discordance blocker.. so a survivor perk has to be stronger than the power roles perks...
---
&gt;
---
What do you guys think?
---
Too strong things. Please play killer more, your suggestions would destroy the fragile balance it has
---
Hex ruin Or noed has to be compulsory 😂
---
That’s some good shit you’re an S tier teammate
---
4 Survivors Alive = 5 Generators Repaired.

---
Killerwise, in my opinion both pig and the demogorgon are very fun to play. Survivorwise, Nancy and Steve have average perks but Tapp’s ones aren’t very good. 
---
So if you play killer or otherwise like the characters, I would buy them
---
PlayStation policies..
---
That's probably the most accurate depiction I've seen imo. It's very killer sided when both sides are unskilled, but survivor sided when players know how to play. It's incredibly hard to balance both ends of the spectrum.
---
I will make it austic!
---
You pair stop being civil. Don't you know this is reddit.
---
What no. If they say "gg wp" then yeah, but if you just say "gg" that just means it's a fun game. A Good game you could say.
---
I can relate
---
Well or they all 3 sitting in corner or 2 are hiding and 1 on gen... every time..
---
Nope Fifa and EA in general are shit
---
Two conspiracies arise from this. Just as it did for J.F.K. 
---
What if someone shot her, and if so, where from?
---
Or
---
What if she just... did that?
---
I had one a game like this last night. Except i offered a Mori.
---
No.
---
As a killer if you put one of those green offerings and get a perfect 32k game, you'll get 40k bloodpoints. The offerings are the bloodpoints you gain in that category x 1.25/1.50/1.75/2.00 for both survivor and killer.
---
Perks like prove thyself and distressing affect the rate while bbq/wglf and offerings affect the amount.
---
Forgot the white ward so u keep the med kit after depleting it 😂
---
Welcome to another episode of "Shit that happens only when you are the killer"
---
Last night me and two friends ( all red ranks ) kept getting matched against rank 15-18. We never touched a gen and let the random do gens while we would head on the killer, probably had 10 games against baby killers. Felt bad every time.
---
Yeah, but you smashed 'em, so congrats!
---
They won't activate if you're near the hook... so the last thing you want is for them to instantly save.
---
Slap that gg ez in the post game chat
---
Peanits is an idiot community mod that can't even moderate. I won't take anything he says seriously, he's a buffoon

He's just a piece of shit who does nothing. Everything he says or does is meaningless, he can just post memes and laugh at it, that is what he does.
---
*spams ready button in response*
---
It's one of the main reasons I'm praying that deliverance will show up on the shrine next week.
---
I'm so happy about this. I really don't like playing against lower rank killers. I dislike the sweatiness of purple and red ranks but that is better than essentially bullying a brown rank killer. I usually just let them kill me at the end of the trial.
---
This ia true
---
Red Forest Boat One? 
---
Do you mean Black Water Swap, The Pale Rose?
---
That happened to me a long time ago BUT 3 people dc'ed and the killer didn't even farmed with 1 person :(
---
Fifa games are the same each year but they just add 1 to the number
---
Blessed by the wiggle timer, sometimes it's always JUST too long to let you get ooff. I can't count the number of times I've been cucked out of an escape cause of that timer.
---
Screw company policy!
---
Purple ranks or any half decent survive with friends
---
Yeah I wasn't thinking when typing that comment :/ 
---
I'm not exactly the brightest locker dweller
---
Snakes 🐍
---
She is best simply because it doesn't matter which map you get. Every other killer can have insta losses just be pressing "play as killer."
---
Hoes mad
---
This is ridiculous, Why not just take the average of the group instead of the lowest OR the highest?!
---
i know killers are struggling to get anything done against swf because the lowest rank was previously registered or something but What the actual fuck is someone rank 4 gonna do with his friends that might be new? thats gonna be the most shitty experience ever. this is coming from a killer main btw...
---
(besides that I will say I'm glad that they are taking a step in the right direction because the game has been a pain for killers rank wise for a while now...)
---
2-69 meaning I can't level up any more
---
Had this happen today. Killer was totally AFK. Spent the first minute or so shitting myself because of the constant heartbeat, then I found him standing on a hill
---
 Had a good time running around like a dickhead in front of him to build my chase.
---
If I think a pallet is gonna get dropped and I'm pretty close i'll try a  lunge to get em before they get that pallet. It works best on the second hit but you can use it to give them a speed boost to get them motivated away from the same pallet if it's the first hit. Hopefully you can get around quicker than breaking would be. Priorities and perks though.
---
Tfw tunnel to instant camp first hook dead
---
Wait is this weekend double bloodpointweekend? Can someone confirm pls?
---
That was a pretty crazy mori... I wish the devs would be creative like this more often.
---
All the stuff you've listed here are problems that come from people abusing the ranking system independently, and are not fixed by this change. These are problems stemming from rank reset, de-ranking,and smurfing. It won't be a disaster for all players, but for those with friends who are new to the game it is. I have many friends who are new, and it would be cruel for me to play with them after this change goes live. There is no way we could have a fun game playing together.
---
Cant wait for her to step on me and make me go to church on sundays
---
Then ignore it and move on?
---
Being a survivor is harder than killer because the difference of these modes is unbalanced just like few years before when being a survivor was too op
---
But how are you playing and filming the screen at the same time. That’s the real question
---
D4 L14
---
Nvidia shadowplay. Then recorded the replay with my phone.
---
Makes sense
---
Quantity doesn't equal diversity lol. Get outa here fanboy.
---
If you made some joke elaborating on the rating this might actually be a fun recurring joke on the sub.
---
As it stands, it's just meaningless.
---
Was the guys name Hex: Toxic? If so, I faced him a couple nights ago and he's just a straight up cheater. He had speed hacks and was zooming around the map as Meyers, got EW tier 2 and 3 in literally one second, then Mori'd all four survivors one after another while standing in the middle of the map. First cheater I've seen in a thousand hours.
---
Thursday is double BP up until monday
---
new huntress buff: she uses a glock 18 instead of hatchets lmao
---
Ok so I'm clearly missing something, I thought moonwalking was when the killer walks "backward" to not show the red stain, what is moonwalking as a survivor?
---
And until this hotfix, it's been the other way around:
---
Three rank 1 Survivors, with a combined 6000+ hours, and smurfing rank 20, go up against a perkless rank 20 Killer and bully that person so hard, they have absolutely no fun.
---
Honestly, this is better. 
---
From what I can tell, it will work as follows:
---
When matchmaking with SWF, the game creates a weighted average rank. Currently, low rank Survivors are given more wieght, dragging the average rank down considerably. So, 20/1/1/1 = 20-15
---
With this update, more weight will be placed on high rankers, but not to the extent that 20/20/20/1 = 1, rather 20/20/20/1 = 10-5.
---
Unfortunately I haven’t heard anything I’ll just try in the afternoon
---
The principles behind skill based matchmaking are applicable to any game. There are many approaches they could've. What they should be doing balancing the distribution of player ranks based on some weighted distribution.
---
Doesn't change anything bro...
---
... this has gotten me that 4th kill before
---
Yeah, been playing a lot with new players the past couple months and  a couple of them are legit brown rank survivors who do things like running around individual trees to try and get away from killers.  We definitely shouldn't be playing against rank 15-20 killers but we also definitely shouldn't be playing against rank 1 killers just because I'm a rank 1 survivor either.  Just put it back to the way it was before the update last week.  They don't need to swing the pendulum all the way the other way.  Put it back in the middle.
---
Really should’ve been here for a LONG time now, better late than never I guess
---
You can get grabbed while healthy at gen, totem, chest, locker and when uhooking someone
---
So... 3 r20 + 1 r1 will face r15 killer... Basically, it's me right now, because I can't stand killer queues and rank reset moves me to yellow ranks. So... I'm r15, with 700+ hours in the game (probably around 60% on killer), I have full "meta" builds (my meta, not reddit's) on most of my killers. Depending on r1 I may or may not have hun playing vs them. I will definitely not have fun playing vs true r20 novices. Do you think it'll be fun game for survivors?
---
What weight function would counter the fact that I'm way too skilled for the rank I'm currently at?
---
But the main question - who cares about winning? How do you make sure that the game is fun for all parties involved, if there's a quite skilled player in a team with newbies?
---
There should be a mini icon on the lower right like aftercare
---
Any streamers you would recommend to help learn to more effectively play survivor? The subreddit is the reason I started watching streams and its helped a lot

---
You didn’t get cucked by the hook vacuum, nice
---
Spirit with Mother Daughter Ring and the purple amulet is insane. It's like playing a Hillbilly with both engraving addons.
---
There's a max of 2 unsafe unhooks per person on average though
---
&gt; TL;DR add a casual mode thats like ranking mode without pipping and showing ranks.
---
Will you get bloodpoints there? At the same rate as in ranked? If yes, what's the point of playing ranked after you got achievements? If no, what's the point of playing casual?
---
Well I think its still wieghted by the people in the party I just think theyre making it more focused on the highest survivor. Like if you have 13, 14, 10, and a 3 SWF I dont think you'll get a rank 3 killer I think you'll get a killer +-4 or 5 of what the highest rank would be and in this case youd be more likely to get a rank 8/7 killer which still isnt fair for survivors who actually skill wise belong in yellow ranks but its better than yellow against a red. I have no idea if thats how it works but I feel like its the best outcome of changing it to highest survivor.
---
Not everyone will go for the unhooks. If you want unhooks you can easily get 3 to 4 every game unless the killer is hot shit.
---
I was expecting plot twist
---
Happened to me too after a 2k, did not dc
---
&gt;ck tin of flash light saves and stuns unless ya know they ass
---
Sometimes when you barely making it out by repairing last gen with struggle and only 2 survivors left... Hello Noed!
---
Damn dude your escape cake is bugged haha. Love it nice work!
---
It’ll have the same issue as causal in hearthstone, either super meme decks or people farming quests
---
That makes zero sense, more modes would attract more players. Seeing all these "it gets boring after a while" is turning people off.
---
Or people tryharding vs "casual" crowd
---
The players I was with definitely weren't new but I can see noobs not knowing when to safely save either
---
If you sack of the objective you can. You can't get 4 easily if other survivors also fancy some altruism points. You'd had to not be doing the objective and making sure you're close to the killer for the hook. Each person can only get a max of 6 unhooks.
---
Had a dwight DC because I downed him with a shred as Demo and in my cooldown saw a feng get in a locker. He DC'd imediately after I got her out of the locker. It was the beginning of the game no one had been hooked yet they wouldve been the first. If youve decided for yourself that you know youre not going to make it out you can still play for points and make it a fun game.
---
Nvidia shadowplay. Lolll your the second person that thinks this is a conspiracy.
---
Ghostfaces secret side job
---
GG should be said after every match. Since CS and rainbow six days 20 years ago
---
the problem is, while stated 'average' it really isn't. When you have 1 rank 20 teammate the killer would most likely be rank 20 too. Instead of changing it to the highest rank between teammates, they should really try to polish the 'average rank' matchmaking.
---
I want more.

You can’t. This is a lie that needs to stop being perpetrated and spread

bullshit. me and my brother are level 13 and 14 survivors, and were getting put against tier 7 and lower killers. its honestly frightening, just seeing them dominate our noob asses, like its a walk in the park
---
Which is weird because you weren't shaming them, You were shaming the matchmaking which is a completely separate situation.
---
Nah this sub is obvs killer sided.
---
Inner Strength becomes an addiction, I had a Nancy waste Inner Strength rather than letting me heal her, and then refusing to heal me
---
Yeah the 2 killer exploit is a thing still. I'm not sure if it goes into ranked matches and I honestly don't give a damn about finding out. I'll DC just as fast as I did after I seen I had 2 killers chasing me. If it starts bleeding into ranked I just won't play until it's fixed if that becomes the case.
---
As for now, people are doing it in kill your friends. The last I heard that was for PC and was patched. I play on console and it 100% works. 
---
I figured that I would take a break from ranked for the night and just have a chill match in a kyf because I can't stand the lag or bugs anymore. It's obviously still in kyf but idc if I lose an offering or item in a kyf because of the bugs and lag because kyf doesn't matter. 1st match I join. 2 killers and 3 survivors. 2nd match, same shit. 3rd match, same again.
---
I think this is enough Internet for today.
---
Disagree. You've watched tru3 too much. If 4 survivors do gens without a single unhook and escape, that's a win. But shit bloodpoints. Is, a 2 pip a double win?

That is true but something else doc can do is cancel actions with a well timed shock, this includes pallets and windows and the delay gives you enough time to switch to smacky mode and slap ‘em, this IS pretty tricky to do though

Well ranked match would be playing your best and trying to compete against equally good players. I would play casual if every perk is unlocked + item for the exchange of no bp rewards.
---
Those were far simpler times
---
Gen rushed a spirit and on all gens done i instantly found the noed and cleansed it and spirit dc'ed and i was laughing but also sad at the same time.
---
Not my cup of tea.
---
Yay, glad it worked out for you
---
Me and my girlfriend play together. Were rank 4 and 11 atm. We constantly get matched with rank 15-20 teammates for some reason and end up vs a rank 20 baby huntress or something.
---
You can. My jumpscare gen grabbing Myers says otherwise.
---
Had a dude get hit in the open, teabag, fail to blind me, run to a pallet and get downed. Immediatly quit
---
I'm just going to walk the other way.
---
I dont know about that, it should be like that now but the matchmaking system is spagetthi thats why they will get prefered higher ranked killers, i might be wrong tho.
---
I'm asking for a refund. Some people are absolute bullies. I can't learn if I'm matched with much better players over and over.
---
So I, a rank 7 survior, got paired up with a rank 20, rank 18, and rank 17 survior vs. a rank 3 killer.
---
Needless to say we didn't stand a chance, and then the killer just had to be a jerk in the chat talking shit about how hard we sucked (ye pat yourself on the back there buddy, nobody else is gonna).
---
The real TL;DR
---
We are talking about grabbing off pallets like what the video has. Gens are a different thing
---
Love a wholesome post. Gg you and your mum get the 2 pip
---
Read the discussion, you can see that at some point, it evolves into other categories aswell.
---
With implementing dedicated servers shouldnt there be lower queue times?
---
So it would seem...
---
Why you all downvoting my dude, he speaking the truth. I was with 2 random and a friend and we absolutely bullied this legion. We memed around a bunch but after the gates opened, one of the random got downed to NOED. I had done every totem I found and my friend remembered seeing one. We got the NOED, got the guy off the hook and made it to the door. Then the legion dc'd.
---
This happened me once, then my game crashed :/
---
I don't watch tru3. Watched him for 5 minutes and found him unbearable. And pipping is winning in my opinion. If I escape but depip or get safety pip while getting shit bp when I need BPs to get teachables that's a loss in my eyes.
---
&gt; Well ranked match would be playing your best and trying to compete against equally good players.
---
Why? There's no reward for ranking up, there's no leaderboards (and all perks are unlocked in casual). Playerbase would be very small I believe.
---
No lol. OP said “I definitely thought I was going to get grabbed” OP was talking about his pallet vault. The context was obvious
---
Bad if trapper. Good if billy
---
Removed - Spam
---
That's fair then, just the way I read it sounded like you were being toxic, when you said head on I assumed you meant the perk, is that the case or did you mean you literally just fed yourselves to the killer?
---
It's also possible for survivors to moonwalk, but is much harder to accomplish. IIRC, it involves rapidly pressing a and d to while holding s to keep your character from turning.

What about them? You want to throw them into tryhard games where they'll play against "competitive" players to get their r1 achievement. Right now they have a chance to rank up and get same achievement playing vs "casual" players.

How can you play fifa it's so fucking boring I played fifa 17 Once and got bored in about 20 minutes
---
I am incredibly okay with this. It is an honorable death worthy of Valhalla, and I would welcome the opportunity.
---
Your teammates are the ones that are left behind, ez
---
Finishing a game in the first 5 minutes is like the survivors gem rushing you whilst ur afk you’ll get nothing good try to drag out the game to get maximum blood points
---
No, why would servers change that? If you have 1000 players who want to play killer and only 3000 to play survivor, servers won't help.
---
Yeah I read some of the other comments after I posted that and realised I won't be losing out on any points. That made me happy haha
---
I have tried redownloading/updating three times with the same issue every time so I am with you. Hopefully it’s sorted later on.  Unfortunate.

This happens almost every game. Then when I ask them what they were doing they claim they were doing gens.

ITS POSSIBLE TO UNHOOK SOMEONE FIRST THEM GET ON A GEN YOU STINKY CLAUDETTE

That's actually scary

I played leatherface on the new map, sacrificed 2 survivors and had one on hook. I went away from the to look for the Steve. I found the Steve on the other side of the map and chase him. I M1 him once during the chase and he makes it to the hook. He in books in my face and proceeds to call me a camper after the game because I downed both of them with chainsaw. Guess people really can't handle losing to low-tier killers.

Wow it seems like everyone in this comment section seriously hates fifa. This year doesn't seem too bad as of right now. They've actually added new things but yeah if you don't like football or EA I understand that you're not interested.
---
I know you won't believe this but I had 3 games yesterday against rank 20-17. I'm rank 18 (cus I'm shit).
---
I HAD GOOD MATCHMAKING BOYS
---
I had wondered what was happening. Recently I've been joining games with my rank 14 survivor and getting paired up with 3 red ranks. I feel the need to apologise to them quite often. Although it's nice when I end up getting more points than some of them occasionally.
---
yea, because 15-60 minutes of your working for those 2$ is way too much
---
Parliament can't get it's own shit together never mind *that*. And yeah I'd love to see it happen also. Not to sound like an EA spokesperson but they don't force you to spend money. Kids using parents credit cards to purchase FIFA points is the fault of the parents. The odds of packing players are in the game to see. Yeah they know full well that a promo will get people buying points but guess what: you don't have to buy them. 
---
P.s yeah that definitely sounds like some EA pr crap. Oh well :)
---
Call it a classic dbd game
---
We're not saying that the current system works, just that such a drastic change seems like overkill. This means any of my rank ~10 friends I play with will get slaughtered by rank 1 killers, and we'll also have to wait in 20 minutes queues to get there. Just seems a bit extreme.
---
Wouldn't it be better to use only one circle which is bigger? I mean you don't need to hear them scream 3 times, first one is enough and a bigger circle gives you more time? The slow isn't short enough to make this here necessary?
---
True I should try that. But she probably only wants to play one game, so was trying to see if anyone would just party and let her go around a game. But ye I just get downvoted and no messages :o. Guess everyone is scared my mom will destroy em.

Undetectable status always on endgame? Too powerfull i think.

Ah okay, thanks!

The most annoying new bug is wait in matchmaking with friends and the game shows "Connecting..." While its in fact, bugged. I play in ps4
---
When you get 3 (safe) unhooks and heal all 3 and get bronze benevolent
---
That hit box actually look just fine, you circled around, got very close to window, swing, swing hits, seems fine?
---
Just noggers play fifa
---
Looks fine? No
---
I'd actually love that. Sometimes, there are those two people left on the farm that just urban evasion around the map, avoiding gens and shit and you have to either randomly stumble upon them, DC or wait for them to get bored after an hour
---
The opposite.
---
Im fairly new to the game. I thought killers wasnt able to do that? I thought i was close to that panel to the left of the window.
---
Pick the killer you enjoy, research their perk priorities, start with Bubba if you want Barbecue &amp; Chilli. Use him until the teachable is unlocked, then use him to generate BP for the next perk you want - potentially switching to that next killer if you get Barbecue &amp; Chilli unlocked on them. Once you've unlocked all the perks, level up your preferred killer.
---
If you can't wait that long, then look at a "basic" build for your preferred killer and just mix that into your rotation.
---
Using this method significantly shortened my grind - would have been shorter again if I'd bothered to use Bloodpoint offerings on top of Barbecue &amp; Chilli.
---
Why do people still think that SWF is some insane instant win button? BHVR literally released stats that showed a 4 man SWF survives 9% more than a solo survivor, and 3 and 2 man even less. Not every SWF is Marth's Depip Squad trying to destroy the killer with insane coordination, they're usually just friends playing a game.
---
It's so weird how he sounds like that
---
This bothers me the most!
---
Won't happen. Too much work for them. Too costly.
---
Swfs?
---
*the song is just an endless loop of pallets being thrown on the ground*
---
Not only that, queue times are absolute garbage at rank 1. I don't want to sit in 5 minute survivor queues to have my green rank friends get destroyed by a rank 1 spirit.
---
Everyone talks about survivors taking the game hostage, but if you willfully ignore chasing survivors to hard patrol the gens and stop them from getting done YOU are taking the game hostage by refusing to let the game end, and I play both sides.
---
Just accept the reality that you cannot guard three points at the same time *and* chase survivors, just chase someone and let the gen get done. If the survivors are just immersing themselves and are a no show...sorry to say it but if you can't find where they are hiding just leave the area and come back in a bit. They are more likely to show themselves if they don't hear anything for a little while.
---
Feels a lot like you're letting them win, but honestly if it's between that and just getting it over with so I can move to the next game, the latter will always be the better option.
---
Does wglf stack on top of the double bp?
---
Should've been 47 mins ago
---
I mean, the lunge connects. While you're holding it you have no hitbox but move quickly, but when you release, it sort of "waits" to connect with a target during the "swing"- but as you're whiffing there's then an extended hitbox that lingers in front of you for a little bit.
---
Like imagine each lunge you're holding a plate at the tip of your finds, losing balance of it as it falls forward. Lunge hitbox is like that.
---
Just add hatches to the outside of the map as a "fix" and call it a day
---
People said the same thing about dedicated servers. ~~oh wait it was too much work that's why it got delayed by a few months~~
---
Happy birthday bro! Love your cake!
---
Oh well... Yes, I meant from killer, but my experience that is. New killers might have a bad time. The map is pretty hit or miss for either side. Kinda funny ey
---
Thanks for all the tips guys. I will take in what you guys said and try my best!!!
---
I've never had a 3 gen game like this, they're low rank I assume? Higher rankers even when they 3 gen do not give a shit about the killer or getting a hit so long as they do progress on one of more of the gens in the 3 gen scenario. Depending on their perks and what they bought (Type of toolbox etc) it's a win or a loss at the higher ranks, especially on non optimal killers like Trapper or GF etc.
---
Saying if there should or shouldn't be a time limit is difficult to say the least, Killers will take games hostage, more so at the low ranks due to lower survivors being scared of the Killers Terror Radius let alone scared of the killer itself. 
---
At the same time you could also say that there was a hostage situation resolved recently by adding a way to stop it: Hatch Standoffs. However this has a major flaw, if the doors are too far away, the Survivor will probably escape unless it's like Nurse/Spirit and sometimes Billy if there's not a lot of shit in the way (Think the different between Lerys and Rotten Fields doors). If the doors are too close, every killer will win at any time.
---
So with the knowledge shown here, is it really worth putting in a timer?
---
Logically, no, cause it'll give survivors another "Instant Lose" Scenario imo. 
---
But given that the devs have put one in already that is almost always a loss for survivors? Yeah, maybe, they could put it in for sure.
---
People still using noed in 2019.. really?
---
Literally same 2 sentences
---
FIFA seriously?
---
This is the reason I'm not buying the game. I think more than an hour of 15h playtime was fucking around with the lobby issues &amp; restarting the game
---
Bond's 32m is surprisingly good enough
---
Why would you even care about something happening on the other side of the map? You'll clearly see when and if someone is getting chased around you with Bond. Empathy only gives you that info when someone is INJURED
---
Just run Bond.
---
I am red rank and you sound so irrational
---
thanks now i have pirates of the caribean in palletslams in my head..
---
Thank you! Honestly, I haven’t tried making coasters. Due to the nature of these being quite detailed, I do not think I’d be able to master that.
---
You can also do that with Bond, as you won't get further than 32m anyways.
---
why would you want the lowest settings to be more straining on your pc?
---
Any tips/playstyle for a good build surrounded on “object of obsession” perk?

By the end of this week I'll have them out! Been busy with Work 😭

I'll get them made by the end of this week, will aim for today though.

At that point why play it

There are reasons to implement servers other than "players demand it".

I don't understand how the player numbers were so high but there were huge queue times for killers &amp; still long queue times for survivors, you'd imagine it's one or the other

There are reasons to implement Prestiging having an actual use other than "players demand it".

Put more rank 1's in there and it's accurate

I need more context on this. Getting enough stalk for the tombstone + unlimited combo is taking alot of time. Then he chases for 3 mins and is finally getting the Kill. Still 3 gens left. 
---
All I can see is at least 3 Survivor in this Game just were afk or running around doing nothing.
---
That doesn’t excuse the devs for putting them in the game as an option in the first place.

Even IF you like fifa, just play double bloodpoints which is temporarily, just play fifa after you’re sick of dbd

Play killer, buy Leatheface and get BBQ perk, always use offerings, play A LOT
---
Ok cool, glad hes on sale then!
---
And these reasons are...?
---
I found that in eshop it says playable on the 25th.
---
Claudettes thinking their invisibility makes them stalk proof.
---
Neas teabagging. 
---
Baby Dwight's not knowing what's going on.

I realized that putting on Myers is wicked. Add a tuft of hair and that would be devastating.

I have no fucking idea. I downloaded mine and I still can't play

Looks cool, it would have been funny if she added "Death is not an escape" on it.

Bill's beard pried it open with his old man powers.

Do give players an incentive to grind the game? To give prestiging an actual purpose? To allow you to use whatever cosmetics you want (therefore driving up cosmetic sales) with something you spent a long time grinding for? I mean, why have a feature in the game if it is practically useless. It was fine before they added a cosmetic shop, but now it's an outdated relic that either needs to be updated or scrapped. Why keep something that serves no use?
---
Then the survivor pops adrenaline, teabags, and runs away.
---
That sounds great until you think about a killer running surprise noed, instantly downing the rescuer, then downing you 5 seconds later, now you're both downed, and your decisive is useless.
---
Yeah the difference is I can read and use Google.
---
Plus people post about noed daily and that makes it boring to even mention it at this point. If you have a problem with it, rank up
---
Really depends on what you're looking to get out of it.
---
Pig is quirky, not to everyone's taste, but Surveillance and Make Your Choice can be pretty strong on several killers. Tapp's perks aren't meta, but they can be good in a SWF.
---
It's hard to judge the Stranger Things DLC before the obligatory hotfix. For me the killer is mid-tier, their perks aren't likely to challenge the meta, and the survivor perks are kind of a quirky mixed bag.
---
I'd sooner wait out a potential Hallowe'en sale, by then we'll likely have the hotfix. Note that the Saw Chapter is far more likely to be reduced in price, which may make it more attractive by default.
---
This happened to a rando in my game I told the killer that he shouldn't do that to a survivor, just pick him up and put him on hook and then close hatch.
---
Yes, you do. I have this bloodpoint farming build with toth, distressing, and bbq. I get 60k plusbwithout any offerings most games.
---
r/woooosh
---
In short: Rank 20-ish teammates vs Rank 6 Myers happened
---
I’m not sure of the name but it’s possible they are the same person
---
OhTofu, and especially their various guides on looping and playing the map in general.
---
It was a 10 minute clip. Its just way faster to record the 5 second part with a phone and put it on reddit. Just a lil bit if fun, doesn’t need to be 1440p 60fps to get the point across lol
---
I don’t think it needs a drastic change, but the averaging needs a lot of work to be better. Most of those matches with 3 red ranks and one gray/yellow, chances are the low rank is just the token low rank that is meant to get newer killers. It seemed like it was really bad the past couple nights with how often I was getting SWF squads that shouldn’t be there.
---
I am playing in EU and most of the killers who are red ranks became red ranks with the help of NOED. My specific build is Inner Strenght, Head On, Quick&amp;Quiet, Decisive Strike. %70 of my games seems like i am the only one cleansing totems and i cannot tell my random teammates to cleanse some totems also i cannot see whether they cleansed any totems or not. So you are saying jUsT dO bOnEs 4hEaD is extremely irrational
---
If you were being a little shit (humping annoying structures or using insta-medis) then take it in stride
---
If the killer is being a dick just practice moonwalks while downed or something, pay them no mind
---
If the killer was bad the whole game (camp + tunnel) and forcing survivors to play a boring round, then it gives some motivation to get better at the game.
---
Usually the toxic players like that are generally trash at the game. With some skill you can put into the pool of strong effort any 4 man team (solo queue or other) can to dick over dick-ish killers.
---
And getting better isn't toxic or anything. Good killers are a joy to go up against, and if the teams are evenly matched but everyone in the lobby is experienced, you'll get interesting scenarios/ plays happening. Sometimes even meme'ing.
---
At that level, where everyone recognizes everyone as being good players, the toxicity you mentioned in your OP, becomes funny again. Your SWF teammate getting Mori'd by Ghostface? Run up and teabag + point while he's getting murdered, and the ghostface afterwards nods and continues teabagging with you for a bit. All while letting the survivor who ran up and waste time for some fun get away for an actual chase further down the line. Good killers and good survivors just don't sweat in games.
---
That's how trypophobia looks like
---
Don't worry, I once played against someone that had a mori and kept pressing and releasing the button for like 2 minutes. Post-game they asked me in a pretty toxic way why didn't I disconnect. They were angry about it, which makes no sense.
---
Alternative: Aftercare, for both ways.
---
He messed around with us for a little bit at the beginning but then he just 4k'd us and bm'd in end game

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d8lbkq/why_do_people_like_to_bully_me_when_i_say_glhf/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Wraith is generally understood to be in a bad state, if you want to give yourself a sporting chance then it's instadown perks (Make Your Choice, Haunted Ground) plus slowdown perks (Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel).
---
Don't play Nurse. You'll feel distaste to even try to play other killers because they don't break the game like her. Go with Wraith for the start. He's simple and always finds survivors quickly.
---
Imagine being hit by her vomit. It procs like a hit even if it's a status effect. Now even if she charged a full vomit she will hit you for 1% because you cannot be hit and you can pass through her. It would make her worse than LF since now you have to spend way more time to put someone in the broken state so at that point just m1 is better
---
Body block is something that devs approves. You can body block a survivor to use chainsaw, stalk with Myers at lvl 3, vomit to put them in broken status and yada yada yada
---
Take that out from her is a direct Nerf and so unnecessary, she WILL be worse than LF
---
Same here, what I am hearing is it will be available at 3pm, but not sure on timezone.
---
Trapper is dummy fun for the start imo
---
I just never talk to opponents ever.  
---
Don't see the point.
---
Can't get in either, someone else said 3pm but not sure which timezone
---
Yeah. If you know the answer why make such a post?
---
SWF = survive with friends
---
&gt; *but I find ways to have fun regardless*
---
Yeah, I also do this from 1 month till now. I had to find a way to have fun in that sweaty matches and I did it recently.
---
Every second a survivor is alive they have a 1/10,000 chance of instantly dying
---
Oh my god Lol
---
As someone who mains Myers, fuck Hawkins. I'll camp the shit out of it too. The map is completely broken in favor of survivors. Seriously, what was the killer supposed to do? Let you win? 
---
Hate survivors like that.
---
I'd say that you WERE camping, but in your defense, you hadn't gotten a hook until end game. In the survivors defense, they want to help their buddy survive. And, even if you did get the sacrifice, it sounds to me you were close enough to the hooked person/people that you actually might have lost pip regardless- the closer you are to someone hooked, and the longer you stay there makes you actually lose rank and points. It's a lose lose situation, buddy, I'm sorry :(

None of them had DS , or BT. possibly Adrenaline but the match finished before anyone could use it.
---
He camped a single generator because he was aware it had an achievement linked to it.
---
No I didn’t expect him to let me win. But he did by focusing a single generator to be a nasty, toxic troll. And still lost it anyway
---
All these reasons are from players perspective (maybe first one is beneficial for BHVR). So it's still "players demand". 
---
While servers give BHVR means to stop DC epidemic and potentially introduce crossplay for the game to stay alive for longer.
---
&gt; Why keep something that serves no use?
---
It's way more practical for them to remove prestige than to expand it to all cosmetics.
---
I would recommend hillbilly as he is not to difficult but there is a lot to learn like curving but his chainsaw sprint is what makes him super powerful. 
---
(The highest rank I have got as him was rank 6)
---
Haha salty noob :-D
---
Welp, just apologize. It’s all you can do. (And it wasn’t necessarily your fault)
---
If you're non-SWF, non-comms then you probably want to be as "obnoxious" as possible - go with mobility perks, get right in the killer's face, and then run them for as many gens as you can get away with.
---
In a SWF build with comms you just replace a meta perk and relay the killer's every move to your buddies.
---
Killers, particularly stealth killers, really don't like Object of Obsession - expect a higher than normal level of facecamping, and possibly nothing but low BP games.
---
It’s kinda weird to explain,But there are Youtubers who have videos that explain it better then me. Basically you kinda ride the wall while chainsaw sprinting and you will slide off instead of getting stunned for hitting the wall.
---
&gt;I am playing in EU and most of the killers who are red ranks became red ranks with the help of NOED.
---
I'm in EU too but from rank 5-1 I don't see noed at all. Since people do bones. Even before those ranks isn't rare to find people without it
---
&gt;%70 of my games seems like i am the only one cleansing totems and i cannot tell my random teammates to cleanse some totems also i cannot see whether they cleansed any totems or not.
---
So what? Bond exist if you wanna have that information. Plus totems are usually in jungle gyms and close to gens. They are easy to spot, gives you 1k BP and emblem points
---
&gt;So you are saying jUsT dO bOnEs 4hEaD is extremely irrational
---
It's not tho. Irrational meaning: not rational: such as
---
a(1) : not endowed with reason or understanding
---
(2) : lacking usual or normal mental clarity or coherence
---
b : not governed by or according to reason
---
I have the understanding that people usually cleanse totems more often based on ranks. Noed isn't being used in any platform in red ranks (data by BHVR perks usage) due to survivors doing bones.
---
The reason is because people like to take out any inconvenience, hexes and eventual noed, plus additional points since in EU the game lasts for approximately between 3.45/7minutes it's natural to do bones while 1 or 2 gens are left. More points, so it's rational to think that noed isn't a problem
---
In the other hand you are irrational by thinking you cannot do totems that you see, spending at worse 15s getting many benefits, to just instead wonder around and just do gens. Is irrational since you don't understand how much you lack in efficiency, since you would always aim to the highest amount of BP possible at the end of the game.
---
So tell me again, what's irrational about that? If you want I can pull it off the stats I'm talking about and show you how noed isn't a problem since red ranks don't use it, while adrenaline is been used by all ranks since you can't deny perks from survivors.
---
DS and Borrowed Time can serve as 2 bodyblocks per person. Even if you weren't tunnelling, they could still force hits onto the unhookee.
---
At this point the only reason I bring the characters I like to P3 is in the hope that they rework prestiging into something worthwhile and then my job will already be done.
---
As of now if you don't care about bloody clothes you have no reason to prestige
---
Sounds like he was farming
---
Ive tried.
---
It says "escape and survive 1 time will William "bill" overbeck"
---
Noob3 doesn't stream as much as he used to, and this community doesn't like him too much but he's pretty great at looping and I personally watch him for both entertainment and learning how to run around a killer even better.
---
Welp, I guess you can just cry about it and mock people saying "jUsT rAnK uP aNd dO bOnEs 4hEaD" when it's just the truth
---
I did after wondering how he teleported me to a hook
---
lol I know! Scumbag in the making.
---
At least your getting doctor i just keep get wraith wraith wraith as if he the only character that matter in the game. Nobody likes a bing bong boy
---
Yeah lol, if I play survivor and see my team being toxic I either quit or get them to stop
---
Sure as hell seems like it. I am fairly new to the game and already encountered a lag switching killer 4 times
---
This game makes a lot more sense once you realize that surviving is the least important thing a survivor can do.  It's all about the bloodpoints, and stealth ain't giving you none.
---
Thats right, but before that it dropps 2 wood planks and sticks.
---
Lets call it even shall we?
---
No. It'd do more harm than good.
---
Ya I don’t think going out of your way to be toxic is anything funny, no matter what level. But I guess I’m just not a toxic person
---
damn that's an actual use case, gonna have to swap that one out for solidarity
---
Teabag is for the weak
---
I'm still rooting for DS. :')
---
Flashlights you should tunnel or looper, cause before you know it all gens are done so game over.
---
Happens to me a bit. If I’m the last one alive I don’t wiggle, as I just accept defeat at that point. If the killer drops me at the hatch and then closes it I just hope adrenaline can get me the fuck outta there and buy me enough time to lose him and get a gate open. Mixed results, mostly death.
---
Throw that hatchet!
---
Matchmaking is confirmed as broken, it's a known issue, [the official Twitter account has said that they're working on it](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1174790992857354255).
---
But no bloodpoints making it a useless win
---
The pig is a killer I personally find incredibly difficult, and you also may not like the stealth playstyle and learning curve, but I've seen some decent pigs, so if you're up for dedicating time to learning her and persevering, maybe it'd be worth it. Like the other guy said, the perks are decent in Saw. In ST though, I've come or realize that Demogorgon isn't quite high tier but he's not bad either. He's a fun killer, just not as useful as the others. Everyone has their own preferences but I'd choose to play Ghostface, Michael, or Billy before him at least. If you do want him, he's easy to learn and his perks are OK though if you pair surge with a gen build it's better. On the survivor side, both survivors are kind of lacking, especially in perks.
---
Both, we would do stupid head ons and get caught and hooked, and we would run the killer to a locker were someone was hiding. The alternative is, do gens and finish the game in 5 minutes, so everyone depips and the killer doesn’t get any hooks, where both the killer and survivors are waiting more than 20 minutes per match, or have some fun and not take the match seriously, so the killer has a chance to learn the game and get blood points and a kill or two and at least a safety pip.
---
First survivor caught, first survivor camped!
---
🐷🔪
---
You’re the only one that comes across as new.
---
This is Dead by Daylight. Not Identity V and camping is only a legitimate strategy once gates are powered, otherwise you’re just throwing the match
---
So don’t buy candy 4 times to save up for a game
---
I never buy candy in the first place.
---
Unless you have the teammates in 90% of my survivor games.
---
Why do people keep dc'ing whenever I down them as Plague? I just want a normal game QwQ
---
LOLOLOL best change ever ... 
---
And for the ppl complaning that now there friends that are rank 20  " are in danger " ... maby u can train them ... instead of steamrolling the new killers while butt dancing ...
---
and dont think im acting salty ... during the last weekend i have played on killer on the pc whit the tag Decado and i avoided hooking or killing any surivor while still downing them " and helping them get up "just to help other players survivors.
---
and i got a lot of groups of players whit ranks 17 mixed whit red ranks ... and the only guys acting salty are the red ranks evrebody else just has fun running around ... but not the red or purple guys ... the are there to pown the killer to show me that the can run around gyms like a champ and blind me
---
Meg: I don’t feel so good... I don’t wanna go I don’t wanna go I don’t wanna go......
---
*Meg dies*
---
This started to happen to me so I started running resilience I’m telling you it’s a god sender perk man
---
I got bbq on lvl 1 as p3 ghostface
---
Fuck yes. I intentionally abuse a bug with multiple Xbox accounts every season to reset my rank multiple times.
---
Low rank games = fastest BP games.
---
They’re mostly perks for fun builds, nothing that I see replacing the meta though. Inner Strength goes nicely with Small Game and Head On, Second Wind is good for a healing build, Better Together is good for a gen build with Prove Thyself, Camaraderie is okay in a SWF.
---
I do!

I had something like this happen once but with cakes and streamers and the second the game started one person failed to join so the game ended instantly :(
---
*starts mumbling about how I shouldn't have brought Deliverance*
---
HOW?!
---
Every person in this thread has 100% ignored the fact that to get the most bloodpoints you need to drop the last survivor and close the hatch. Late hook and late sacrificing are worth far more points, and the only time a killer wouldn't drop the last survivor to close to hatch is if he's max bloodpoints already.
---
I mean yes currently matchmaking is fucked but less people qeueing for a game mode definitely isn’t going to make it any better
---
That’s one of the most stupid ideas I’ve ever seen
---
It's valid to do this thanks to adrenaline. If he just leaves you slugged he might lose out on a kill also you already failed to win anyway.
---
How so? I don’t see any harm. I just see a last chance scenario for a slim chance of hope for escaping the realm because your teammates left or got pushed out by the killer.
---
I got it at level 4 then later at level 7
---
They might need to make a separate daily killer and a daily survivor ritual tab. Otherwise the chanse is to high we will only get killer rituals due to fact more players play survivor than killer (4-1)? 
---
You might also have a DLC problem where not everyone owns all the DLC and therefore a killer or survivor will still not get used.
---
They are getting a lot of support tickets lately
---
I had the same, but the killer was a prayer beads spirit, and she was not messing around. We went down in about 3 min without finishing a single gen.
---
either that or Inner Strength
---
If you play alot of survivor, you will get more killer challenges and vice versa
---
Deliverence into ds into hatch, especially with a key
---
Make it 60/75/90% to make it balanced
---
I have a friend I play with who routinely hordes map offerings for the maps he knows I hate, and will then just use them all night to irritate me.
---
should I just wait more?
---
Even if I main survivor, I have to say : as toxic it can ne, camping is a strat. And in your situation, camping was your only hope to have your kill, moreover if your f1ce SWF team without Anti SWF perk. Dont bother about complains at the end screen.
---
holy shit thats one hell of a connection
---
I realised I was trolling them back only after they raged at me. At the time I was simply waiting for the match to end.
---
Better Together is meh. 
---
Second Wind has potential but needs to be less difficult to activate.
---
Babysitter and Camaraderie could be good for some fun SWF builds but they're not A-Tier
---
Fixated is a nice combo with Sprint Burst,but SB is not meta anyway...
---
Inner Strength is probably the strongest of them due to how easy it is to activate and how flexible it is.
---
No bloodpoint gains stack, ever.
---
They're all additive and only apply to the base amount of bloodpoints you get individually, they don't multiply each other.
---
Earning 20k bloodpoints with 4 stacks of WGLF will get you 40k, double BP on top of that will get you 60k.
---
If you want to learn how to play KILLER, don’t play the Nurse.
---
Nurse will teach you how to play the Nurse and will hinder your ability to pick anyone else up
---
Did you take hatch
---
Or hear me out, they just liked the outfit
---
Probably
---
Isn't it pretty much general consensus that nurse is above everything else in the game and only still exists because changing her in a way that would make her not op would require her to be changed beyond recognition or removed?
---
Billy is 3rd best for a reason, he is a balanced killer shifting a little bit on the weaker side due to how fast games end. Hope they do something about it soon
---
Ever play sneak king? Cause this is basically sneak king lol
---
Yea I know, but you still get more blood points, just not post trial.
---
OK, thanks
---
Pretty sure she is like legion; desperate for a buff. Plus the developers said somewhere they were eventually going to do reworks for most killers who are not played as much, but I can’t find the source.
---
I’m a little new so I’m not sure if “f1ce” is a term or a typo. And this wasn’t PC where it’s a text box at the end of the screen. This was PS4 where you have to manually bring up someone’s profile and start a message chat with them, it’s a lot more petty.
---
How about we base em over your most played so they are easier to do and people can get off their mains sooner to try something different
---
Their system works in charges (as often stated by McLean) so you have to heal for how many charges one health state is. So hitting great skillchecks and other survs helping you heal someone actually is not helping in contributing to your second wind perk, as you don't get as much charges because the person is healed faster.
---
Is it better to save bloodpoints or spend them immediately? Also, is it better to max our a character, or spread out your spending?
---
To some extend, it’s the survivors faults. A lot of people mindlessly do gens and don’t think to even out how much per side of the map, creating 3gen scenario where the killer could resort to winning the game. 
---
I hate it though, like I ain’t wanting to play half hour matches
---
You must be facing really nice survivors
---
Why should you need to ask, steve of course.
---
Which just encourages choking up the killer queues so I think it'd be smarter to base them off least played characters if nothing else.
---
95/100/at level 3 it can start affecting survivors in other matches
---
I see you’re a man of culture as well😂
---
I think the map is fine idk what you guys are on
---
Then you refer to metrics! It keeps tabs of everyone who plays so just have it go down the list till it finds something you own that needs to be played :)
---
Meh, all this is going to do is make my friends want to play less. I'm continually persuading them to jump on with me. They struggle enough as it is and find it hard to find motivation to play enough to improve as they always die early.
---
For us it is just about fun and not ranks.
---
Hex: Haunted Grounds? Never heard of it.
---
 Also none of the good killers I saw for the last 6 months used TOTH to succesfully prevent the deestruction of the ever so important totems
---
I only have to lose 71 pips!
---
But don't people stay on their mains because those are their mains?
---
God I hate daily rituals, they’re bugged for me.  Every time I do the ritual it magically goes to a killer daily and it’s annoying.
---
It's a shame that bbq isnt that effective on demogorgon because he has in built tracking, feels like a wasted perk slot sometimes
---
huntress is the best mom indeed.
---
The way he just ascends into the sky at the end killed me.
---
Dead by daylight
---
Tears and anger
---
You say good sportsmanship, I say unnecessary communication.
---
My guess is the killer was rank 16 that prob means your a low rank as well so your prob overreacting to a not even strong perk.
---
I never said that either, you’re just assuming I said let the survivor go. I’m all for killing the survivor, but if you drag them across the map, only to drop them informer of the hatch, and close it in their face, you’re toxic. And that spreading that toxicity is is bad for a community that is already steeped in it
---
Same. I'm not sure why they can't just make it average out between ranks instead of a reactionary change like this. The same problem that existed before will still happen. Previously you could get low rank killers and that could really ruin a new players experience. Well now if you try to introduce a friend to DBD on survivor side the same will happen.
---
Stop punishing both sides and just make it an average.
---
Before and during.
---
No, it is not and the game is already made this way. If you play killer, you will get survivor dailies and visa versa. On top of that, the rituals have a higher chance of being about someone you don't play. Something already implemented can't be idiotic, right? (Other than legion and the new matchmaking, those are truly stupid)
---
People play their mains to get bps fast. If you give em the boost they might be inclined to try lvling smth else
---
Hiding then all three walk to same gen........
---
*hey, don’t you ever accuse our boi of being disgraceful like that again*
---
Clown became a Nurse
---
Better to spend **if** you have something to spend them on. They don't gain in value over time, so if you need add-ons or if you need a perk, go for it.
---
&gt; *is it better to max our a character, or spread out your spending?*
---
It is *generally* better to max out a character with high-value perks so that any future character has a chance at getting them. Spreading your BP just increases the likelihood of you having several "high level" characters but with mediocre perks on all of them.
---
Consider a "standard" killer upgrade route -
---
* Play Bubba with Barbecue &amp; Chilli and spend on Bubba until teachable Barbecue &amp; Chilli unlocked.
---
* Play Bubba with Barbecue &amp; Chilli and spend on Hag until Hag unlocks a better tier of Barbecue &amp; Chilli than Bubba.
---
* Play Hag with Ruin and Barbecue &amp; Chilli and spend on Hag until teachable Ruin unlocked.
---
* Play Hag with Ruin and Barbecue &amp; Chilli and spend on preferred killer until preferred killer unlocks Ruin and a better tier of Barbecue &amp; Chilli than Hag.
---
* Play preferred killer with Ruin and Barbecue &amp; Chilli and spend on preferred killer *as necessary* until you need another killer's perk.
---
Ideally you do this during a Bloodhunt and/or while using Bloodpoint offerings, so that your time spent *not* being your preferred killer is kept to a minimum.
---
Lucky fuck your mom want to play dbd? You sir/madam have one of the best moms
---
Fucking finally
---
Yeah on their DBP post they replied to someone complaining about matchmaking that they were deploying a fix tomorrow (today, refrencing the tweet.) Should drop around 11amEST like normal.
---
your the reason i have crippling depression scoop troops4lyfe
---
If you aren’t saving BP for any particular reason just spend it. Also you have to ask why you’re spending BP on a character. Are you just getting teachables or is this a main?
---
Agreed. But your subjective way is that survivors aren't actually a team at all, and you only play it so *you* win, not the team.
---
As someone who plays swf I can say this is sort of true, and I feel like peer pressure is a big factor that contributes to toxic behavior, no one wants to go "um well aktually" when your friend complains about the killer tunneling/camping/whatevering them
---
Outplayed btw
---
Update ig: I can play killer again, I have wifi back finally
---
100%/it affects all currently playing survivors/it affects all currently playing survivors irl
---
How many bloodpoints did you get from this
---
your game didn’t crash from dying light?
---
Dont you know how it works? If youre a streamer with a large following that means you're an elite dbd GAMER and you have the authority to tell people the best way to play the game (seriously streamers swing entire metas, they were like "self care bad" when no changes were made to it and everyone stopped using it)
---
Love him or hate him he spittin straight facts
---
I have the opposite problem of getting farmed
---
Like dude you're getting chased please stop unhooking me
---
You cam see Ghostface if you look very carefully
---
I am not that sure. Doesn‘t seem to me like an intentional lag switch. Have had some a lot worse ones on PC.
---
You should make a separate thread for self promo.
---
I'm glad, playing against rank 17 killers when you have two rank one survivors In the lobby is not only too easy and boring  but also unfair
---
This does exist on PC?
---
This cannot exist on Xbox, iirc, because being able to see text from other players is a separate privacy setting from being able to play games with others. 
---
DbD would have to make their game unplayable by privacy protected accounts on Xbox to add in-game text chat.
---
Jane is doing Jotaro pose?
---
Fixated is amazing for new players as it does show scratch marks and gives players the concept of how they work.
---
But still, the extra BP to reduce the grind is amazing. I totally forgot how useful BBQ was regarding BP until I had to level Demo up.
---
Once the gate is opened, all rules on camping go out the window. Confirm your kill.
---
If you're camping while there's still gens and gates to open, then you're just ruining someones fun.
---
The sloppy butcher - nurses calling combo is what most high rank players use.
---
Apart from that, ruin / bbq /pgtw are also good on her. Thanatophobia comes into play in a slowing heals build. 
---
If you are having problems tracking survivors, stridor and predator are also good. Predator only works if u use father's glasses, but it is nasty if you do.
---
About addons, get rdy for survivor dcs if u use prayer beads. I usually find the yellow/green addons which increase yamaoka haunting duration/speed/recovery fairly nice.
---
Really? I play my mine because she has a nice ass.
---
Whadwu mean? I'm pewfectwy fwine. UwU'
---
thank you. i am already hooked up via ethernet and the problem seems exclusive to dead by daylight; i don't lag in any other games. i don't think i even notice lagging when i play as survivor. 
---
...maybe i should treat this as a freak accident instead of an ongoing issue.... i just wish i could reliably prevent it from ever happening again
---
Plot device. The bitter sweet taste of plot device
---
I’m literally dumbfounded at how it’s possible to literally come across as much of a spastic as you’re managing to.
---
I never said anything about ‘breaking a code’ etc. I said it was a toxic move. Because it is a toxic move and is no different to face camping in that regard which is also universally hated.
---
Go back to Identity V you monkey
---
DbD tried to code and "average" match making system and somehow fucked it up.
---
Kinda hilarious, kinda sad. They've discovered their mistake though... And instead of trying to fix it (lmfao) are changing to a NEW NEW matchmaking system that only cares about the highest rank person.
---
Always bring agitation and iron Grasp for my bubba
---
Yesterday, before they shipped it, it said it would get here on the 27th. Weirdly enough it's here now. I was close to just buying it in a store.
---
The game's still not live yet, so you've got time to go and pick it up in a store. Don't deal with that. You'll be hugely behind, and you'll miss the bloodhunt. Go, buddy!
---
Gitgud and rush gens
---
Not my dwight! ;0
---
Except Dwight, he will be spared
---
Patch today is supposed to address this - I'll believe it when I see it. At least there will only be two red ranks in every game.
---
Yes
---
Don't taunt me had a game last night with 3 of them. End result I get found first, not the end of the world it's a trapper and early first minute or so so don't have to worry about trapped loops since I took him the oposite way he came from. He gets me because I had bond and didn't want him to get the others working on a gen near by so I took the riskier loop. In short he basement hooks me and no one even goes in for a save until I'm in phase 2. Then two come in for the save and both proceed to walk into his traps while the Claud goes around the map to try and find ruin. Only got 1800 BP before streamers because I kept him on a loop for a while. Only positive is I might have gotten him that party achievement for having 3 survivors hooked in the basement at one time
---
Meanwhile knocking down Nancy sounds like you stepped on a parrot.
---
Wow nice upside-down Piranha Plant Cake!
---
Have you played it
---
Like yeah, it can be strong for either side, but it's not actually that interesting
---
What do you mean wouldn't work?
---
Yup, I'm a spastic because you literally cannot make a coherent argument. Kid you're dumb as fuck. You came here crybabying about camping and you're mad that no one agrees with you that what happened to you was "toxic". You need to grow the fuck up. The devs don't agree with you. The players don't agree with you. You're just mad, and you can get over it or find another game, cause "toxic" behavior like camping is never gonna change here.
---
Honestly, same tho
---
holy bloodweb, I need one like this, double BP event is coming.
---
PC Killer main here. In my opinion (as to how I play), camping is a poor choice. In that type of situation, the point gain from a single kill is less than the point gain I'd get in the other categories. Sure, I will not pip that game, however, if it was that late, I wasn't going to pip anyway so it's more useful to spend the remaining time doing anything else. I would have locked-on to one of those other survivors and gave chase, get at least a hit in, use my ability, maybe double back between the hook and exit gate to go for another survivor. Perhaps, I'd keep the chase radius shorter in case I can hunt another survivor. As the killer, I see myself as managing the fun-factor for everyone else and camping doesn't add anything to that. Morally speaking, Looking from the survivor's perspective, it is crappy to be on a hook but impossible to be saved and just having to sit there, spamming spacebar until the end... let them at least *feel* like they *may* have a chance. Additionally, it doesn't help to improve my gameplay as killer - there is always room for improvement in giving chase or spotting others. But, as an aside, if I were the hooked survivor late in game when or just before the gates are opened, I don't mind being camped on the hook: I should have gotten all my points -save for escape-and know I (hopefully) can signal to the other 3 that they can safely exit. In any event, we play tons of matches per evening and no two are the same.
---
Pizza! P-i-z-z-a
---
Mine are that The Game is the funnest map in the game and that Leatherface is FAR from the worst killer btw
---
thank you. i will probably ruminate on this some more 'cause that's how i am, but join the rest of the community in eagerly waiting for dedicated servers :)
---
Make the dailies killer/survivor combos.
---
ex: Sabo two hooks OR teleport with the Hag and hit 4 survivors
---
I've been playing this game for over a year. I've been in the high ranks as well. I know what the typical speed for Trapers are and he was so much faster than that.
---
So now I need to DC a bunch to be able to play with friends, great. 
---
Make it a middleground, not the max.
---
Just imagine getting 32k as the killer thats more than youd get buying a perk from the shrine you already have
---
This seems to happen rarely if you have connection issues. I saw the message myself was my internet was being dodgy
---
Jane's and Kate's tits jiggle when they run and when they are on the hook.
---
That happened to me once in a game. I was opening the gate and all of a sudden I realized I heard her wheezing behind the gate so I dipped and went to the other gate.
---
What is his built-in tracking?
---
understandable
---
Okay, think of this scenario: Other 3 are deqad, you get downed and hooked, now, you kobe, and have Decisive Strike. The killer is forced to keep you on the ground, wasting at least a minute from both players, or potentially robbing them of the last kill OR wasting their time.
---
Jesus, they downvoted you bc they took you seriously, I upvoted you , have a lovely day .
---
Mentally ill people smh
---
What does a tar pit taste like
---
That sounds good in practice until you realize 2 rank1s and 2 rank 20s would still stomp a rank10 killer, since the two rank 20s could just stay far away.
---
bubba op
---
Nah, you weren’t in the wrong. If they’re going to run around the hook without even giving you a chance to hunt, then that’s the result that they can expect. 
---
Ignore the name calling, though. It’s usually just salty players, same as any other game.
---
Its a risk. Theyll be splitting the playerbase in half, meaning that less people will be playing the mode you want to play, meaning longer queue times and more unbalanced matchmaking. 
---
Once they have a bigger playerbase they can afford to expand, but right now they can use stranger things and new updates ro build the game more and attract people. Unless a new game mode is the best thing ever, it wont be enough to grow the fanbase and avoid the problems above

do survivors have long queue times?
---
those arent new ones tho
---
Park tiers are a dumb concept and the real reason the game is super grindy.
---
"Friends don't D/C"
---
Not really, it was 2am so the queue times were very long, waiting up to 20 minutes just to get into a lobby. We could have just done gens and left once we realised it was a baby killer but we were consistently getting baby killers, for at least 3 hours straight. No one would have fun or get anything good out of it if we finished the game in 4 minutes and go back into queue, easy 4 man escape. The killer might have gotten a few concussions, but we made sure they would get some kills or at least hooks out of it. I'm pretty much a baby killer myself and I would rather a 3 swf thats fucking around and having fun with meme builds than them genrush me with meta perks while I'm struggling to down a person.
---
We’re making it 8!
---
just make a Macro
---
I started as Myers and he’s still my main 800 hours in. He does everything well, while starting with no heartbeat. Once you learn how to manage your power meter he becomes a blast. Once you learn how to counter looping (Mike’s one weakness), you can carry everything you’ve learned to any other killer in the game.
---
Could at least blur their names
---
This should be on r/fopdporn
---
Nurses (Wraith has an way time jumping healers), Pop, Ruin, Haunted,
---
Could swap in enduring, or go enduring+spirit fury as Wraith struggles and n chases. 
---
Also since Wraith can cancel a chase by going invis, you can run PWYF and just follow your obsession ringing your bell to get stacks easy. 
---
Wraith isn’t bad for grinding, he gets pretty good deviousness moorings and way. So Distressing/Beast/BBQ and ruin.
---
Two words: Dedicated servers.
---
They do this make player experience the whole game
---
I’m coming on to this late but I just dl the game because I heard about the chapter awhile ago. I haven’t bought the st chapter yet because I want to get into the game a bit more.
---
Plague is on the same Level as Huntress, even if they dont cleanse
---
Léry's is a really fun map to play on as survivor and Plague is fun to play
---
Maybe we should say it slower. Iiiit. Woooouldn't. Woooooork.
---
Hope they address it, could kill the game that crap
---
thanks i swapped to this setup 
---
Nurse- BBQ- NOED- RUIN 
---
not at all optimal but i dont have many perks maybe i should unlock Pop the weasel and swap NOED for PTW
---
Why are we still here... Just to suffer..
---
I was playing yesterday and was being very helpful to my team mates and it got me killed almost every time.
---
They completely botched the matchmaking in the last update. I would be in a group with ranks 3-12 and get matched with rank 18-20 killers.
---
If having to struggle in real life is the issue, then why not use the same controls as when struggling out of the Killer's grasp (when they're carrying you on their back)? It requires the use of 2 different keys (mine are `A`/`D`) but it's much more convenient to perform than continuously spamming the same key with the same finger.
---
\[I'm gonna edit this alternative as another suggestion on the main post by the way.\]
---
Wraith buff too strong
---
Thank god
---
I could never kill a Kate. :(
---
...how do i point out she made 6 petals instead of 5 while also reasurring i dont see it as flawed, just that good boi has 5 petals.
---
Like i just did?
---
Very weird...
---
Had a guy almost make it out. He lagged and I hit him right at the gate. I'm a honest killer I knew if it didnt lag he would have made it. So I picked him up to let him go and what does the little fucker do? Disconnects.
---
Wonderful!
---
Forgot to mention you always use BT and take a hit if need be, but they eventually came to save you, without BT, while you are being proxy camped, they don't take a hit for you and instead sand bag you at the ONLY pallet you have a chance of escaping with. Happens far too often, im rank 6 for gods sake you'd think the survivors i play with would be halfway decent.
---
Very rarely, I can find a survivor game in less than a minute but wait for 5 and sometimes 10+ for a killer lobby
---
of course not, that would improve the User experience
---
I didn't know about this till last night when I was bored and wanted to see how well the game run, so now I'm also gonna do it on my Xbox
---
Welp, guess I'll die
---
That’s a great tactic! Though i’m not sure a big child with a chainsaw making a tantrum, is less scary to me.
---
You cannot place the blame on the survivors for a long game. It is equally your fault for not ending it with sacrifices. If you were so upset/bored with it taking so long, you could have just gone to the  bathroom, eaten a sandwich, whatever, and let them finish the game for you.
---
Your mom is a certified gamer I can tell you that.
---
&gt;-60% fuck you that’s why
---
Unlikely to be the platform, we've not seen any numbers to suggest any one of group of players is saltier than any other. Some people just don't like playing against Plague, same way they don't like playing against Legion, or Spirit, or Nurse (though not always for the same reason).
---
DCing is Unsportsmanlike Conduct on PS4 (it tells you this on the report tab), so just use the ingame reporting tool and move on to your next match. Remember, a DC isn't "denying/robbing a killer of points", it's throwing the rest of the team under a bus because of one player's tantrum. Report them in good conscience, let BHVR sort them out.
---
The game gave me yellow moris on the first 3 bloodwebs lol
---
Hey man , coming back to this, are there perks for the stranger things dlc ? pink ones? :D
---
I still have got 6 gateaus from last event
---
I would feel disappointed because that’s a horrible combination of perks
---
It was buggy and constantly... um... wouldn't work. If you see the latest hotfix notes, it even said that's it was supposed to be doing an average. Clearly it wasn't so this is their current fix.
---
Use whispers and probe gens and exit gates. Saves a bunch of time
---
What supposedly good killers are you watching
---
Nice flair
---
I don't deny but seriously, there are ppl who blame teammates for playing selfish by using selfcare but teammates like i mentioned are the reason, u have to.
---
However with inner strength available now i switched to that, coz i know my teammates wont be doing bones either  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
he was a ghost face from scary movie not scream. xD
---
thanks
---
I never said that. But I mean, if you're always escaping then aren't you leaving your team behind? Ultimately I think the win is up to the player. Objectively winning is pipping.
---
Is it bad I've been using other killers to level him up
---
Game is getting boring as fuck, russians spamming spirit all day. And if it's not spirit, it's either Pig or Ghostface. I actually took a break from the game, going up against the same killers is the most boring thing ever. I don't understand how people don't get bored of playing the same fucking killer.
---
Random 🧂 fact: Salt is so essential to the body that if you drink too much water it can flush it out of your system and cause fatal Hyponatremia. This is what killed Jennifer Strange who entered a “Hold your wee for a wii” competition.
---
Not usually,  they’re often quick compared to killers but queue times for survivors can be just as long as killers, sometimes longer depending on the time, and the ratio of survivors and killers waiting for lobbies in your area
---
Its literally the most unique map in the game?
---
His killer instinct
---
Yes. The screen blurs briefly and you hear a sound.
---
Plague is S tier
---
Oh, that perk that makes you the first person to be found in the game.
---
My friend got alot of those. Its memories for him
---
is bill popeye?
---
I agree. I'm rank 12 but my friends are rank 3-6 right now. I'm going to be destroyed if I play with them now.
---
Was playing solo cue and someone played shroud so we all spawned in together near a 3 man gen. Three of us hopped on gen, cause why not at that point, fourth crouched next to gen. Ten seconds later overwhelming icon appears and the crouched one DCs before terror radius is audible. I started walking away and one of the others blew the gen then DC'd. Trapper got other guy and then he DC'd and I just ran into basement to call it a day. Got hooked, went to next game.
---
Please just have fun, don't be another sweaty tryhard
---
Stolen from a YouTuber with no credit to them...
---
I don’t think I’ve ever seen any of my teammates get mad because someone was using self care, that’s a stupid reason to get mad unless you’ve got a teammate right next to you to heal you
---
Dude people are disconnecting now if they hear terror radius too fast
---
Wrong. I've gotten yoinked by myers before.
---
I wouldn’t say that’s the reason he’s top tier. I’d say it’s because of a combination of things. He can traverse the whole map very quickly. Good billies can instadown people very quickly etc. Even for good players cross map snipes aren’t extremely common, atleast at higher ranks
---
What the hell do you mean? He literally just said how I think it should be. I don't think it's bad to say gg, just it doesn't look good when the game wasn't good for both sides. But you stupid hivemind morons downvote me anyway.
---
It's condescending to say gg after a stomp, which I assume is what the OP's meme is about.
---
Search this sub for self heal and see how many complaint posts you will find.
---
Hotfix today for matchmaking and some other bugs.
---
Getting gud is a choice in this game, you can run hex ruin,no ed, barbeque n chili and blood warden with nurse and you will win
---
thank god
---
Yes, that's how I think it should be. I don't know how it was interpreted any other way.
---
Immagine being such low lives that you and your monkey brain friends have to have fun by making other people mad
---
You also become the obsession if not already.

---
Oh god r/brandnewsentance
---
Is anyone else getting a bug where you’re unable to recover on the ground or wiggle? I’ve been getting it somewhat consistently (1 in every 10 games probably) and it’s remarkably annoying
---
Patience.  Back in 2017 when everyone was loosing their entire saves I lost 700 hours of game time, it took just over a month for a response. They don’t have an extreme amount of people to sort out support tickets
---
That's just a demo of the new killer, Light Yagami.
---
Ds wAs tHe oNlY cOunTeR tO tHaT
---
Ds used to be used up early game, lmao? It activated on your first down. It's very unlikely that it would still be active by the end game unless the killers been ignoring you.
---
Seriously just do totems, it's not that hard, if noed is truly a crutch that is used by bad killers as you say it is then you wont be in a rush to do gens because you can just run the bad killer around.
---
Won't help this guy. The matchmaking change is 100% killer sided and he's a salty survivor. The fact that this patch is making matchmaking harder for survivors is not the news he's hunting for.
---
Survivors precede to gen rush or killer camps and tunnels all game.
---
Then I’d say get all your potential killers to 40 at least. Play around and see who you wanna go with. You can even keep them at 50 and just not prestige until you feel comfy. 
---
If it’s survivor just pick one skin you like and take it to p3-50 and keep all the others at 40.
---
Wouldn't that be a fun power change? 
---
*Trapper can now pick up sabotaged Bear Traps and throw them at survivors, injuring them.*
---
You won't. You need to put in at least 10+ into the Nurse to get good with her. You just jumping in to play her for the first time in your life, you will 100% not win.
---
Bump
---
Tru3Talent, Otzdarva, some others I bet you dont know not care to know. You? You are changing subjects because you cant prove your point. If you want to use it, then use it, nobody will judge you. Its just in my opinion its kinda shit compared to Hex: HG or most perks for that matter
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
Yeah "rng". It feels like ruin and BBQ won't ever show in the blood web
---
I find nurse overrated and boring to play as.
---
I've seen them use it literally ANY time they do a hex only build, it is LITERALLY a staple perk if you want to do that type of build
---
Is it allowed? I've never used one before.
---
Psst it's an exaggeration
---
Thank fuck for this but this still doesn't fix the core issue of the perk IE "Claudette Self Cared for one milisecond guess I don't get to use my perk."
---
How about we put you onto a hook?
---
DBD Steve sounds like he could have a chance with Robin
---
dont know, havent been banned in the last 2 years tho
---
What if your definition of having fun is being a sweaty try hard
---
I agree. Unless the gen spawns are terrible to a phenomenal degree the survivors absolutely have the power to get the gens spread out and realize when they are narrowing the map a bit too much. Unless the killer is like Doctor, Hag, or Trapper with very strong area denial a competent team should reliably be able to avert a 3-gen.
---
I still think that after a point, 3-genning doesn't benefit anyone, and drawing the game out to three times longer than it should out of sheer stubbornness accomplishes nothing but delaying the next game.
---
thinking 1 step ahead. well done
---
Personally i got 4ks when i started playing nurse but even if you have to learn her, 10 hours is not a lot of time investment for a killer that has massive map controll, the ability to nullify palets and windows and 2 top tier teachable perks
---
Always run Franklin's if you see 2+ flashlights, especially as an m1 killer.
---
Can lag switching even make them speed at bullshit  speeds like that?
---
I think the downside is needed but the amount of downside is rather insane. The Undetectable effect is very strong but honestly I could just play Wraith to get similar mobility and stealth.
---

---
10 hours at minimum, just to get used to the range, but then there's add ons that you have to put time in so you can adapt to whatever add on, also prediction, mind-games, etc.
---
Her mind games are different than other killers. For ex. a survivor runs behind a wall and you need to guess if he continued to run or if he's waiting at the edge of the wall for you to teleport past him, a person who just picked up the killer won't think about that and you'll just guess where they are and teleport there, not thinking about any mind games. Also double-backing no new Nurse players will be used to.
---
I personally when I just started playing her spent 30+ hours learning her distance judgment, all her add ons and the mind-games there are, and I still got 3k's like every 8/10 matches when you actually get survivors who know what they're doing and not just running forward and doing the same old predictable mind-games.
---
I also forgot to mention: Cars/Boxes. New Nurses who don't know the distance well, will just tap the blink thinking they will teleport through the car/box but they just teleport in place wondering to themselves "why didn't I teleport through such a small width object" everything comes with experience and experience - Get good.
---
I myself am now a retired Nurse main who spent 500+ hours playing her, to the point where all my games were a 4k and it was just boring, it didn't matter if it was red or green - It's a 4k. I main Huntress and Spirit now and it's incredibly exciting to actually get matches where you have to worry about getting a 4k or even a 3k.
---
Aw, I guess I'll have to practice solo for a while lol
---
/r/boneappletea
---
It was really dumb.  I'm rank 2, my buddy is rank 1, and last night we were playing with an 8 and 11.  Almost all of our games was loading us in with rank 19 killers using 1 perk.  Completely unfair to that killer, and that's still way below our lowest ranked survivor. That said, what they are doing is overcompensating, and going to make it miserable for my new friends trying to learn the game.
---
The biggest problem is: the game has a small player base.
---
Let's  take a common peak of 25K players spread across South America, North  America, Europe, Asia and Oceania and assume it's 5K players per region.
---
This  is too small for skill diversity. By the way, we are supposing the peak  of 25K, it's even worse when you are playing at some hour with only  19K, 16K or 14K players online that is more common.
---
What was fixed from the PTB?  Certainly not the exit gate shenanigans. Certainly not the rank mess. It's not the hair issue either. 
---
They did jack shit from the PTB.
---
They hate accessibility options, colourblind people can barely even play the game right now and thats not a debilitating condition..
---
Which is surprising.. more people should know about this game. I'm going to get my GF and buddies into it.
---
You lived...
---
I would, but I'm pretty bad at making comics.
---
I’m not happy with the influx of new players. This past weekend was horrific as a survivor main
---
Pig can fake that’s she’s going to do a lunge mindgame then immediately come out of it and catch up to the survivor if they try to leave the tile.  So there’s counterplay there.  I’m not saying she’s a good killer, just that she’s like mid tier.  I certainly don’t like to play her and prefer hillbilly by miles.
---
I’ve always thought that the better option would to be able to apply the blood to any cosmetic, I get that they would probably have to go back and individually add blood to all the cosmetics and give them a rework and I get how this would would be costly and time consuming but some of the characters P3 heads are terrible. I always try and find a head cosmetic that changes their overall look (Eg: the “Dark And Light” head skin for Nea).
---
In ~200 hours (80 of which were spent as killer), I've only run into one guy who was toxic after I let him go: It was a baby dweet who I gave the hatch to at the end. Me and another survivor were giving him tips in the post game chat when he said to the other survivor, "I don't need to listen to you, I lived and you didn't." 
---
I was straight-up gobsmacked by it.
---
Why so downvotes? He is right. Right now the matchmaking it is broken and does not work, playing as killer (rank 12/9) the 90% of the time was premade with red rank and shit, I barely can do anything, when I play as surv (rank 7/10) I find killers with rank 20 or 19 that can't do a single hit because all of the survs have rank
---
Then you realize that people just wanna play with their friends so they’re gonna de-rank into your lower bracket and stomp on you if they want anyway? This just causes more problems for the game. You’re gonna have people d/c’ing and killing themselves first hook or putting forth just enough effort to not get into trouble themselves but still making all these matches one person down from the start. You can’t ban people for playing like shit either. 
---
I don’t get why people are rejoicing.
---
What if the totem was only a couple feet from the gate? You don’t know it you don’t look.
---
Plus that is enough time to give even your remote area a quick scan.
---
&gt;He asked if he won the game

This too honestly. Dead by Daylight is such a complicated game that while people bitch about the poor balance and bugs I'm honestly surprised that Behaviour managed to make it so relatively stable.
---
Reminder that before Dead by Daylight these guys made fucking Naughty Bear and Drake and Josh on the DS. They don't exactly have an impressive track record.
---
~~Something something Megan killer when?~~
---
Uhm.
---
Well you shouldn’t spend the whole match looking for totems? I’m suggesting a quick scan, not an in depth search of the map.
---
Is your list of potential mains just between Legion and Doctor, then? If you have Myers then Legion would probably be the stronger, since Save the Best for Last is *hilarious* on Legion.
---
You probably already know, but you can "game" your dailies by building specifically towards them, by not buying a killer until you can afford to unlock a basic set of parks for them, or simply by re-rolling any daily that's for a character you have no progress on (it's a shame that dailies do not take into account how far you've progressed the relevant character - it's why puts me off immediately buying new content if I don't have a Bloodpoint stockpile).
---
I personally wouldn't take anyone past 40 until you have a good set of teachables. For me, ~150k a Bloodweb for 3 almost guaranteed lacklustre perks is just not viable - I would need to be *really* stuck for add-ons in order to consider it.
---
Ruin is still one of the best perks for buying time. Sometimes it isn’t much, but if you get a game where it lasts awhile, the balance usually shifts greatly in your favor, it isn’t even close to being the killer version of self care.
---
Meanwhile, cut to me getting Hangman's trick 1 and 2 in my first 3 levels.
---
To be honest I didn't even know that they had changed the way dying light worked. I am a survivor main and this was the weirdest shit that has ever happened to me.
---
https://youtu.be/xNSfvlSkO4U
---
I literally don't care, murder them all equally.
---
It used to be like that and the killer would just wait next to the hook
---
I guess I didnt make it clear that we werent going out of our way to bully new killers or anything. We literally could only get baby killers so we took off our meta perks for meme ones, put on things like head on, pebble, no mither, and spent the match just fucking around. Why would we do gens and turn the match into a 4-minute gen simulator where everyone escapes on first hook when we could fuck around and sometimes die because the killer saw us get into lockers?
---
The lullaby gets replaced with some faint mumble rapping
---
I knew what was coming but I laughed out loud anyway.
---
This is why I don't play teams in PC strategy games like Warcraft III. One bad thing happens, and they unsummon all their buildings and quit or run their workers to the enemy base and quit. It's like they don't get that a game doesn't ever go perfectly. You can still win the game.
---
Running into illusions (Anything that the Doctor gets an aura from, fake doctors and pallets) will force them to disappear. It’s a great way to tell if a pallet is fake while not in a chase.
---
ur uh poppydace
---
She is more A tier when you go against random survivors, but B tier against 4 swf since they can coordinate when to cleanse.
---
That’s kinda shitty. It’s a team based game.
---
How do yall get your parents to love you
---
Dude, I love Lery's! There's a lot of vaults, places to squeeze in and hide, fun loops- it's just finding gens that's a bit of a bitch but I enjoy the map as both killer and survivor!
---
Plot Twist: The survivor is awake, ignores all the snares and just jumps in.
---
I feel a little bad because now I'm going to drag my Rank 15 friends into my Rank 5 games, but I'd prefer this over playing against my 5th team of 3 Rank 3s and a Rank 15 in a row.
---
I'm a little worried though cause this will probably encourage more deranking.
---
Cue 3 toolboxes and the hardest gen rush you’ve ever seen.  
---
We escaped!  (With 12k BP)
---
Oddly I find Ruin super early all the time, BBQ is completely absent until 50 tho lmfao
---
Why so late? Doesn't Amazon usually do release day delivery?
---
I feel like a lot of you never had to do anything on a team.
---
I feel like a lot of you should be forced to do team building exercises.
---
My goodness.
---
Dude I got it on level 2, nice.
---
Tunnelling is a legit strategy. It sucks for the tunneled survivor, but there is nothing wrong with it.
---
Survivor main, 10+:1
---
Whats with the offering though?
---
I guess my unpopular opinion is what people consider to be "toxic". Using flashlights or looping a killer isn't toxic. Body blocking other teammates, teabagging, and being an overall asshole just because you can- is a toxic attitude. 
---
Killers camping or tunneling is actually viable. Dickish? Sure, but like flashlights and loops- a game mechanic for a reason even if it sucks. It's not toxic. Stuff like smacking someone on the hook is.
---
**\[Killer Queen\]** Had already touched that meg....
---
Ask a killer, you win the game when you realize:
---
Ranking don't matter.
---
What survivors want don't matter.
---
What the entity wants don't matter.
---
Having fun matters.
---
Getting perks and addons that help you have fun matters.
---
Oh yeah its the worst when 3 wheels are broken
---
LF has litterally nothing going for him. Even with this minor change she would be able to slow the game down more, have a more viable 1 shot with her purged vomit (even at red ranks survivors cleanse) and a better tracking tool with survivors being so loud. Also if it was made so that survivors would only get the "Hit" effect on the initial hit, it wouldn't be a problem at all in my opinion atleast. Other killers also do not suffer from the "broken mechanic" i was arguing against. I was arguing a killer being able to block off an exit gate panel, while at the same time hitting you. Only huntress could do that, but the hit would count, and she would lose collision thus making you able to open the exit gate. 
---
I'm fine having the discussion about the change, wether its good or bad, but she will NOT be worse than LF, thats just simply not true.
---
\&gt; Adjusted the matchmaking logic so that Survive With Friends  groups are matched using the highest rank of all players in the group  (instead of the \*\*average\*\*). The 3.2.0 patch introduced an issue that  caused Survive With Friends group matchmaking to be skewed towards Rank  20, which is also fixed with this change.
---
What a dumb idea (using the average rank), of course most of SWFs have synergy or even comms. This "fix" should be the standard behaviour (pun not intended) since from the start.
---
I called hook recently because I needed a sacrifice for a daily. I saw other survivors standing around, told them no, they unhooked anyway. Ended up with two sacrifices instead of the one I needed. I apologized after the match to the two sacrifices and told them I was just doing a daily.
---
After not getting BBQ and chilli teachable for ages, I finally got it. Then got it on two characters maxed out within 10 levels. Felt so good
---
If we can't have a single account for playing on PC and console, I can't see how we can have this for mobile.
---
Does mobile version even have all the DLC?

---
I’m rank 7 and my friends are all 15, it’s about time, I hate going against killers who have no idea what they’re doing
---
This is what was getting me about it to. Let’s be honest, high rank players can be pretty toxic 😂 I’ve done my fair share of the Myers moon walk
---
Repost
---
I'd personally replace Thrill with Huntress Lullaby(if you have it, if not then Make Your Choice is a fun perk). Could run a basement build with body blocking hag and a preschool offering.
---
I loved to get it at lvl1 as well
---
When Myers tier 3 ends, sometimes there is a bit of stalk already, sometimes it's quite a big chunk... why is that and what it depends on?
---
Yes... usually. But even when it doesn't it'll be like a day late, not like this.
---
Yea because getting "WRAITH AND JEFF DAY" every other day is a fun and interactive idea that would 100% make the game more fun to play!
---
Pinhead. 
---
Totems are puzzle boxes. 
---
Mori is "Jesus Wept"
---
They reworked the ranking now , also if it’s s swf highest rank surv is the killer rank
---
Everyone complains about new survivor memes. Just be happy that the community is getting new memes and shit your taps about the subjective comedy 😎
---
Well, Demogorgon isn't from dbd
---
Ots not supposed too
---
Yeah, well with a 1 shot killer at 119% with no pallets left I surely won't risk my own life. If devs wants players to be more team oriented then why do they think this shitty perk is in a good place.
---
I asked people to play the game. Apparently that’s like cutting off their legs.
---
I’ll make this easy and direct it at everyone. Dead by daylight is a TEAM game. Just because you’re playing with people you don’t know, doesn’t mean you have to be selfish and greedy for those bloodpoints.
---
28 downvotes for suggesting you even make an attempt at playing the game properly. My goodness.
---
Mad oof
---
okay but as i just said you make there game unplayable. when you are on the hook and you are being camped your game is unplayable... what are u gonna do u just sit there 
---
there is nothing the survivor can do to make the killers game unplayable so what’s the point
---
eat
---
Think DbD Switch will go live during hotfix? Still shows as unavailable
---
Botany Knowledge does affect Self Care, yes. And Self Care has the same speed at all levels, yes.
---
What does it say at the bottom in black? :s
---
I wish, but probably not.
---
Pharmacy never works in this meme build, it actually has some decent use for healing others or potentially finding other items in subsequent chests more easily that CAN help you.
---
Making the game more fun to play isn't the goal here, making it more diverse is.
---
Happened to me too twice with both rituals last night on pc. Was so confused
---
Meme. But this would be slugging on steroids.
---
Grabbing off of vaults does require the Survivor to be injured, and I'm 99% sure it only works on slow/medium/pallet vaults as well. No grabbing fast vaulters.
---
&gt;Been suggested a billion times and I still don't know why it isn't in the game.
---
Get good as killer and farm survivors YouTube will prolly do u some good
---
Cool, thanks. Im really liking killer so far
---
Plague is the least fun killer to play against.
---
I felt really bad about it and wanted to message the killer to apologise but I was playing Nancy and the clown went for a Mori, I had to DC because I already cringe enough at clowns Mori but I can't watch Steve or Nancy get it
---
I ended up escaping thru hatch with a Red Key i got from a chest, with one Gen left  
---
Killer was a rank 9 Hag, if you are curious
---
... idk if u didn’t read or anything but as stated i said the matchmaking system is broken... so if there is a update to fix that why wouldn’t i want it?
---
And? So what? It's not about making it unplayable it's about removing the fun, which survivors do all the time. 
---
Anyway here's a thought, why not get better at the game, if you can't loop and escape a baby killer then the fault is all yours. I used to get camped then I picked up kindred and I loop as much as I can, now killers will start to leave me when the choose goes on for too long or my teammates can just focus gens whilst I keep them busy. And if I get hooked they know the killer is camping and out they go. I win because the killer only got me and lost out. 
---
I still suck at the game and have only made it to rank 14 as survivor, so I play against loads of baby killers, and they are so easy to loop and escape from that this isn't really a problem.
---
GIT GUD
---
It’s. A game dude. Not real life
---
This happend to me and now I'm a Killer main. I try to spare those who fall victim to these wicked ways.
---
Played against a rank 4 and rank 8 yesterday. I'm rank 12.
---
You have no clue how happy this makes me.
---
Played against Sxyhxy once during a BP event. We all put in streamers, including him. He presumes to demolish us and camp and then say “ggez”. I already hated the guy because of his toxicity but man, that was a whole new level of disgusting.
---
&gt;If you really think her banter is toxic
---
rofl. some nice mental olympics going on in the jen cult. "its only bants mate"
---
You escaped
---
BUT DID YOU SURVIVE?
---
just git gud trash killer.
---
It is. It's not like she wishes people to break their legs and kill themselves or something.
---
This sounds op not gonna lie
---
I mean to have the perk be useless you gotta break tótems, which is useful sometimes
---
Dude it’s shit game design haha when you design a game, you’re supposed to make the game as fun as possible. Struggling is a fantastic example of not doing that correctly. Honestly we shouldn’t have to do anything and we should just see the character doing it for us
---
These are confusing times
---
Solo queue in a nutshell
---
The same happened to me.
---
LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR
---
Or in my case, trying a new killer at rank 10. Happened with clown, really hard to adjust.
---
Barely anyones gonna transfer to switch dude.
---
Krampus from the 2015 movie would be dope. Some kinda ability to send out little minions like the toys or an elf, map could be the snowed in neighborhood, and survivor could be Tom Engel.
---
A pretty good DS counter
---
Several. Just to name a few:
---
* Tunnelling (as most Survivors define it) rarely happens, and is about as profitable as camping.
---
* Leatherface would actually be pretty high tier if his bugs were fixed. ~~Billy would still be better.~~
---
* Failing to ready up should make you start the match injured. This lets you use perks like Resilience without running No Mither.
---
* Darkness Among Us (IE Legion) wasn't that bad of a DLC. ~~Fuck you Bricky.~~
---
* Plague is the worst Killer to ever be released and Demise of the Faithful was the worst DLC to ever be released.
---
* Pig is one of the weaker Killers entirely based on bugs. She's not the weakest but she's probably in the (second) lowest tier, just barely above Plague and Leatherface.
---
* Deranking should be bannable
---
As I've said before, the map poses some trouble to her as she can't blink through the buildings I've mentioned.
---
Switch will probably have lower frames so I don’t think that’d work.
---
They should give us coach and the witch as a killer I think that would be sick. I like the concept tho.
---
Sugar rush would be an amazing replacement for DS and i think it would be accepted by both survivors AND killers.
---
People are already dcing and killing themselves on first hook lol. 
---
I’m happy for killer mains.
---
That's good sportsmanship! I only don't do it on facecampers - but those end the post-game immediately anyway
---
I don’t wanna play op PC nurses thanks.
---
A fellow LosslessCut user! It's so useful!  
---
You can also cut videos with VLC!  
---
And if you're feeling lazy just dump the shadowplay recording into gfycat and cut it in the upload process. Easy!
---
yes that may not be what it’s about but that’s what happens now it would be different if i t bagged a killer and flicked a flashlight maybe but me just being a normal survivor like what did i do to be camped and make my game unplayable
---
sounds like a tuesday night
---
Decisive Strike, Sprint Burst or play with friends who have Borrowed Time.
---
I don't feel so good Ms. Morel.
---
Happy Birthday and have a good match.
---
Like some kind of insect with hints of spice and anaseed
---
And this is your first hook, you have adrenaline and decisive strike ready to go. Additionally the killer doesn't have NOED
---
If only they were using a Altruism +100% Offering and Inner Strength. Then it would be the biggest meme.
---
Make Your Choice is incredibly meh on Pig
---
You can't place them too close together. So if they made a circle there would be clearer paths to run through. As opposed to the current maze like set up.
---
for me it's the complete opposite.
---
i can feel my heart pounding the second i start reparing a generator and the skill check comes up
---
I'd rather have a fun game than it made diverse for no reason at all other than people being bored with the balance.
---
What movie is this meme from? One day I want to watch it
---
Where is the "One man cheeseburger apocalipse" perk?
---
Friends don’t lie. It’s a quote from stranger things
---
Who’s gonna buy all dlcs that they bought again for phone though. Not me for sure
---
The matchmaking system is broken in that it thinks groups of survivors are a much lower rank than they are (an example, a rank 12 and 4 in queue get treated like a rank 16) after this patch they will be treated like a rank 4. The old system was to treat them like a rank 12. This "broken matchmaking" is just making easy survivor games.
---
givve me him.
---
# give me him now
---
Xbox :(
---
You do the exact same thing you do if a Survivor accuses you of camping, tunnelling, hacking, abusing OP perks, abusing OP addons, abusing OP offerings, tryharding, deranking, or anything else that Survivor mains like to complain about:

Without cross-platform save you will have just a base game then.

---
Claustrophobia is not very interactive gotta say. Imagine it from the survivor standpoint "Oh, well guess I can't vault windows the whole game, bad rng" I think it should be a different phobia altogether, or rework it.
---
&gt;unplayable
---
So, did the killer remove your ability to unhook yourself? Did the killer force you to struggle? It literally takes 5 seconds from being put on the hook to die. Doesn't sound unplayable to me.
---
Alternatively, you could just fuckin' leave.
---
but if your forced to kill yourself didn’t it just make that match unplayable
---
Does it make me a dick if I decide to not rescue someone from the basement during end game collapse against a basement camping Bubba?
---
and isn’t it a 4 to 5 % chance of that working without perks
---
Are you a child? I'm just so frustrated by your lack of basic communication skills.
---
Legion is fun as fuck
---
Also a pretty good killer
---
Yes it does go faster I run it all the time
---
The game is fun map for both sides, Doctor is actually pretty good, ghostface is boring and bloodhound is a great perk.
---
All the perks are OP except for Sugar Rush which is literally Second Wind without an activation requirement.
---
Peek-a-boo! I’ve come to kill you
---
Is hotfix today?
---
your honestly frustrated by facts?
---
Well I mean, DS is so strong you can chase a survivor for 5 gens and it still be active
---
&gt;!I did well, right?!&lt;
---
As a survivor main I will say this...you don’t owe us shit. It’s a good gesture but it’s a choice. Also people need to learn the difference between patrolling/heavy patrolling and camping.
---
Clown clown and clown
---
Yes :)
---
I just want my fucking ice cream man
---
Custom emotes depending on the survivor should be a thing. Since right now all survivors are just skins. Hell even put it in the shop, but I think having at least one default one for that unique survivor would be fine. You know how all killers each have a unique mori? Its like that, survivors don't really have that.
---
Just leave, please...
---
What I'm trying to say is that I run perks that are useless if I camp.
---
Ah ok. Wasn't aware of that. But can you really pass between two pool without triggering one?
---
Yeah Aftercare is like Bond but for real bros
---
Im glad to see fortnite wood instead of minecraft. All this FoRtNiTe = BaD and MiNeCrAfT = gOoD is annoying as hell
---
Pennywise would make a terrible addition to the game.
---
&gt;Small tweaks to demogorgon &gt; queueing new players vs top ranked during free play event, crashes due to various reasons, inability to connect to host errors, broken custom lobbies, broken swf lobbies, broken meshes, obvious as fuck visual glitches
---
-BHVR probably
---
Yeah no. The tiny balance changes are not good enough to say they really put in work at BHVR during this cycle.
---
is it just me or is this confusing?
---
I wish memes came with a tutorial of how they should be used.
---
Okay lol my bad
---
Because that's how competitive games work?
---
Why wouldn't you think that? Do you think survivors and stealthy killers should glow white to help people who are vision impaired? Do you think there should be a visual, directional indicator when you hear a survivor breathing or their footsteps? This is a current advantage people with really good headphones have over deaf people. After all, balance doesn't matter if we're making it accessible, right?
---
I agree that they should just change it to a single button to give up but unfortunately that doesn't go with the aesthetic of the game. Best fix i've seen so far is to bind struggle to the scroll wheel if you play on pc.
---
It's called being a good sport, mate. You throw a GG out there unless the toxicity levels are going through the roof.
---
Tough shit? You want to get better at something, you put in the time.
---
If I can’t be safely unhooked, get those gens done! It’s a great feeling when you hear those gens popping while your dying, it mean your death wasn’t in vain and that your fellow teammates have a chance to get out
---
Oh...my....Entity.... @_@
---
Thank Christ
---
Take that back. (omfg you're right)
---
I always assumed it was there to put anxiety on the survivor hooked (also bloodpoints)
---
Damn, must have been a gen-etic thing
---
Thanks
---
Plague with thanatophobia is _DISGUSTING_. It's almost like Billy with infectious fright
---
I can here Doc's personality
---
Sorry survivors but my bubba BP farmer needs NOED to actually score at least 1 kill :/
---
&gt; AW GAWD RED MOSS IS USELESS NAO
---
How the fuck do you get an Ultra Rare made part of your base kit and still find time to bitch?
---
Same for me but it was the 4th random who DC'd. Feel like they probably did that just to troll us :(
---
NO WEAKNESSES
---
Running the meta perks don't make you good. I'ma probably get downvoted like fuck for this.
---
No wonder the entity is pissed
---
What are you on about? I have no problem mashing the X (it's X, Sony, not cross!) button on ps4. Never even occured to me that someone would have a problem with it.
---
Hex: Diss Track
---
But if it wasn't a good game, and one side was demolished, it's just lying.  It wasn't a gg and to say it was even tho like, say I did complete garbage, feels kind of patronizing. I'd rather nothing was said at all.
---
What are out eyes?
---
I dont wanna go mr ace
---
&gt; It's also worth noting that in order to get the teachable, make sure you finish that bloodweb. I got the d-strike teachable on Laurie the moment I saw it in a bloodweb, and then immediately started leveling up Jake. I never got d-strike with him (all the way through level 40) until I went back to Laurie and finished the bloodweb that had d-strike. I got it in Jake's next bloodweb.
---
That's just a coincidence. I've leveled most survivors up until the point I could buy the last teachable and never finished the bloodweb. Still learned every perk on my main.
---
The game ends instantly when a Killer D/Cs, though.
---
That shit happened to me once.
---
[ONCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwMaTn5HFOA).
---
Holy shit I love this
---
My unpopular opinion is that these unpopular opinions are fuckin dumb
---
Pig picks up his traps and uses them in reverse
---
That is not a unpopular opinion...
---
Me when i play legion with insidious , shadowborn, monstrous shrine, and noed while basement camping
---
Getting a 4k doesn’t mean you won, or even that you played well.
---
Same thing applies to escaping for survivors.
---
I've never seen such beauty
---
If you have a couple friends who also play you can hop into a KYF and learn how to do flashlight saves that way
---
True
---
Same thing happened to me lol and then i got rancor at level 10
---
just level a character to bloodweb level 35(i think) and their personal perks should start randomly appearing in other characters bloodwebs
---
I think they may do the fortnite formula and do cross play with mobile and switch.
---
No killer main will answer this for you, but a survivor main such as myself will:
---
You need to run the small game perk and cleanse the totem that’s on fire.
---
I used to think body blocking a killer in front of the hook was toxic
---
I'd just keep working on the gens. If you fail a skill check, stop repairing for 2 seconds. After the fail you cant make progress for a short time, but you can still get more skill checks. You are also able to crouch walk over hag traps without triggering them
---
Yeah i think crossplay between console versions would be cool but i definitely wouldn't want it with PC.
---
I fundamentally disagree. GG isn't a reference to player skill levels, imo, it's a statement about effort put in and a reflection of sportsmanship.
---
I just power through the generator and deal with it. :/
---
It's level 40
---
And they only appear, when you buy the orange versions (teachable version) on lvl 30, 35 and 40
---
The perks he has are all the hex perks if I'm not mistaken. I think it's making fun of the length of all the killer's mori animations and how the second you go to do one the survivors will destroy all the totems you had due to how safe they are while you're out killing someone rather than guarding your totems or patrolling gens. I think that's what it's saying anyway.
---
Lol at all the survivor mains complaining about the matchmaking changes
---
Probably like a tar pit
---
Tuxedo Freddy from part 3 is needed as well.
---
I main trapper to get good at him all u have to know is how the maps work
---
Hangman's trick is the best perk in the game
---
ah okay, i only have level 20 characters, so i was just going on what others said
---
From a killer main, I would recommend you cleanse it if you find it, but most killers will get annoyed that you powered through ruin and did gens with it active. Basically makes the game useless.
---
This is really good
---
It's the same for every single killer though. Free 300 BP per hit you get on a person, plus you'll get a few chase BP too. Crying over tbagging in any online game is pathetic.
---
Like a bowl of nails, without any milk
---
F L O W E R P O W E R
---
As a killer main i shall help you. If you are not running map with add ins, small game, or detectives hunch, itll be really hard as a beginner to find totems. However, on most maps, there are very common totem spawns that you should check at the beginning of the match. If you cannot find it in 1-2 minutes (basic rule of thumb) stop trying to find it and just work on generators. Even though you may not hit every skill check, it is still faster to work on gens then attempting to find ruin without full map knowledge.
---
i seek it out and destroy it even if it takes 5 minutes to find just so i can get back on gens. either that or gen tap but if i see my teammates tapping or hitting the hex checks i just go search
---
I'm PS4 as well. I have seen it in most ranks though highest around the green/purple ranks range of survivors.   
---
 With how crazy matchmaking has been likely you see some of the more toxic behavior even at the lower ranks.
---
I had a game like this yesterday where the last person was on the hook and couldn’t die. The whole game was off cause we were all put on the hook multiple times (I was hooked 4 times) and no struggle prompt ever came up and we all couldn’t die. 3 of us got out and the last person, Claudette, decided to teabag the killer at the gate while noed was active. I stopped watching after a couple of minutes cause just watching her on the hook got boring
---
I mean if people want more, I can keep throwing clips together
---
Be rank 20 survivor, get paired with rank 20 killer and rank 14 team mates. Everyone dies, somehow I to blame.
---
You have to Level Up the survivor/ Killer you Want the perk from to Level 30/35/40 to get the teachable Version of the perk. The teachable looks just like the normal perk but the Background colour is orange. For each level of 30/35/40 you will get one teachable, which one it is you can see by looking at the information of the Killer/Survivor. After you get the teachables you can get these perks on other Killers/Survivors.
---
the dbd forums would still say these are all balanced or need buffs
---
There's no proof of that. That's an opinion. Switch is there for the sake of having the game on another console.
---
That’s in like literally flawless conditions though and is extremely unlikely. Still crazy though
---
Take the perk observation (teachable Tapp). It gives you up to 4 free great skillchecks. But you have to stay in the terror radius to collect max 4 tokens.
---
And... practice. You get better the longer you play.
---
We need a survivor who just Naruto sprints
---
We do not play to be merciful here. Mercy is for the weak. In this game, in the streets, in competition. A survivor confronts you - he is the enemy. The enemy deserves no mercy.
---
Yeah, but why would you choose Inner Strength over being healed? You could get healed and still keep Inner Strength for a moment where you will actually need it.
---
Sperm
---
I have much, much, much more vulgar words for the killer sometimes. But Xbox would ban me if I messaged them any of those words.
---
That was due to the glitch. Not due to matchmaking being based on the average. If it was based on the average, as previously intended, they would've been with a rank 5 killer
---
Or tar.
---
Hopefully its fixed in the hotfix now
---
Remember where totems spawn and check those area when you’re close. Don’t waste time running around the map trying to find it. Or use a map
---
Damn. I swear this used to be me. I started DBD a few weeks ago and currently I'm sitting in rank 16. I discovered that kindred is a perk which helps see the aura of other survivors when someone (namely you) is on the hook.
---
I figured this perk was set in a way to help establish who will go for the unhook. Rarely anybody comes when I do this for some odd reason. This happened to so much, that I ended up doing the same as them and rarely go for the hook save. Now before anyone attacks me, I need to point out, that, 
---
1) I realized that one person should stay behind and do the gens. If everyone goes for the hook save, then who is going to do the gens? Usually the one who stays behind for gen repairing is me.
---
2) When I stay behind, anyone who got unhooked recently, gets healed by me if they come across me as I always have a medkit with me. Not healing myself, (got self-care) but my teammates.
---
The only way you get better at the skill checks is doing them a bunch, so just keep on the gen and don't run around looking for the totem and be wasting time.
---
Bro a choice between fifa 19 2: electric boogaloo or double bloodpoints?
---
I agree this is the right action to take. I can't wait for the dedicated servers as BHVR has said that with those they will be able to finally tell the difference between intentional DC and loss of connection. From my personal experience though I tend to find the purple ranks the most salty more than red ranks or other ranks
---
I just go on and off of repairing the gens. It makes it slower, but it's quicker than getting constant ruin set backs because it completely avoids the skill checks. Yes, I am that asshole who needs to get gud at great skill checks but doesn't lmao.
---
&gt;And this is your first hook, you have adrenaline and decisive strike ready to go. Additionally the killer doesn't have NOED
---
Damn. Just damn.
---
She's depress and tired of living
---
Or you can just close it...
---
These are all totally balanced though
---
And one survivor jumps in a locker even though the killer is nowhere near them
---
Probably got walked in on by his mom after bedtime
---
I nearly always go back. Saving as many people is my goal even if it leads to my death. It's a team game even if you don't treat it as such.
---
&gt; Objectively winning is pipping.
---
"Objectively" lol. A killer getting no sacrifices but max bloodpoints would "objectively" be a win in your eyes.. crazy.
---
First of all it's *one* survivor, they'll likely still get 3 kills.
---
Second of all there are lots of posts on here with the uneven matchmaking showing the rank 10-15 killers getting a 3/4k even on a full team of purples/reds
---
Shit, my map awareness sucks. I can't remember what gens are done and where they are located in a map. Maybe there could be a map offering, or the map itself, where it creates a small map in the upper left corner of your screen. Not necessarily marking my gens, but just the general outline of the map.
---
I don’t think it would be nearly as bad if the games wasn’t constantly putting them in the same games as red ranks. 
---
If matchmaking weren’t broken, it would be fine.
---
Good thing his headphones are muted otherwise that moaning and grunting would've gotten you in a lot of trouble there
---
Tiny edge?
---
Tiny? Dude, giving even more gen speed overall is a really bad idea. That's not a tiny edge when games lasts for 3-7 min max at red ranks
---
It's an hard nope when you just wanna buff things over the top not thinking how players will abuse it and combine it with other things
---
Imagine getting white knighted by somebody even more worthless.
---
Dead hard should be on a cool down, not exhaustion.  It may be somewhat good but every time someone successfully uses it I just laugh in  my head knowing that they now have nothing else besides pallets and vaults
---
You were a noob once. You’re just being a gatekeeping asshole. Eventually people will learn how to play. Getting camped and tunneled is frustrating but it doesn’t happen every game and if you are diligent and play smart you can still steadily rank up out of the noob ranks. 
---
There’s lots of things in the game that are frustrating for players of both sides. One killer frustration is the loops that are in the game that are basically infinite because of bad map design. It just is what it is, it’s not fun and technically ‘unplayable’ by your standard but it’s not worth pissing and moaning about because every game is not going to go your way. 
---
I am an Xbox player. As others have said sometimes you need to just git gud. Be captain save a noob.
---
God no. You have little to no chance of escaping that and you are not in the wrong to get away from situation. You should try and save if you can but you have no requirement to be suicidal just because someone is being camped
---
It’s called STRUGGLE because you are STRUGGLING. How is this difficult to understand?
---
Before the server closes, there is a cinematic camera where you can watch the entity brutally kill the killer for dcing
---
Sweaty time is all the time
---
I'll give that a go! It's just painful watching my progress disappear every couple of seconds :')
---
If the last survivor hasn’t been toxic and has been playing  good and fun I always give them the hatch
---
You bring up a good point, it would be nice if some sort of middle ground could be discovered. Idk tho
---
Just keep doing the gen, if you miss a hex skill check just stop for 2 or 3 sec and continue. If you see a glowing he’d totem then cleanse it. The more you get used to ruin it doesn’t really affect you that much
---
No, her movement speed while crouching and uncrouching was increased. 
---
This is also a pretty stale comment
---
There is a lot to factor like the perks of the survivor team and what they be bringing into the match (Skeleton Key, Maps, Flashlights, ToolBoxes and Medkits) plus add-ons to buff the existing stats on said items.
---
Killer may not have items but they use add-ones for their ability to make them more dangerous along with killer specfic perks that would apply pressure on the surviving team.
---
I say if you put an average SWF team against an Average Killer then their is a **50/50** chance that either side will win.
---
But if one side is clearly more experienced against the other it would probably be **70/30** meaning unless the other team figures out a way to shutdown their strategy they will have a slim chance of winning.

I’d pay good money to see DvD Porn in game.

So true

Scavenge mode would no longer be the most toxic L4D related experience

Yeah I saw a toxic Claudette from last game and I only had ebony mories and turn out that of them were rank 2s

I was rank 14
---
A hex rooting its power in cacophonous noise. When this totem is active, survivors who fail a skill check will have their aura will be revealed to the killer for 5/7.5/10 seconds.
---
BBQ and Iron Maiden is a great combo.
---
What bugs does Cannibal suffer from ? Never really played him
---
Also why do you think Plague is that bad ? I'm curious to know your opinion
---
It's way worse on keyboard.
---
Happened to me trying to get Adept steve I made it out with this perks and a I believe a green or purple toolbox not only did I not get the achievement but I lost an item from the trial I got from a chest.
---
I’m also a console player, but I understand why they did this.
---
This is why you don't heal them before they heal you. I also have fallen prey to this as well. Nowadays, when I come across injured teammate while I'm injured myself, I make them heal me first so they don't end up screwing me over should they ditch if I healed them first.
---
@SirSethaneBlake I get your point I had your same situation it’s just the other guy is bad at the game and he’s salty af
---
The main problem I'm facing is that a Hag/Trapper will camp their ruin and if I set off/deactivate the trap they'll come straight for me. Because I play solo, no one else really helps me out, so it becomes an endless struggle :(
---
Well I mean if you put all your effort in, and with that, you couldn't even prevent yourself from getting demolished, you probably didn't have that great of a time, no? It happens, especially in this dbd, some games you just have no power in. Those games aren't enjoyable and are a flaw of the game as a whole, and therefore the games that are like that, I would say, aren't good games, regardless of skill. 
---
I guess it comes down to how you define what a good game is. For me, it doesn't matter about effort, because any amount of effort can still fuck you over at times.
---
1on survivor and 1 on killer.

Glad Im not alone.

So not being able to vomit to people for more than 0.2s isn't a Nerf and won't make her power useless. Ok.

You know you're asking for invincible frames for a non hit power right? If that doesn't make her useless I don't know what to tell you

Who hurt you jake

What about this:

We have 4 rituals, 2 of which are about your main, so you can get bp faster, the other two are about the characters you dont play

That's a bit farfetched

---
&gt; Fixed an issue that caused the Second Wind perk to activate under incorrect conditions.
---
Actually, what tilted me enough to post this was that raw not working. Just died on hook the second match I used it. Maybe they need an indicator for how frequently they want you mashing the input and I missed it by .000001s.
---
If you play other online games and nobody complains about your connection they are probably using it as an excuse for losing and they are just toxic. (not 100% sure but it's weird that it only happens on dbd)
---
You would think so, right? But honestly with the amount of post game msgs i get it seems to be quite unpopular
---
It’s been like that for some third party releases like cup head
---
Apex is an extremely popular game as of late and its ranked system works exactly the same dude. Highest rank in your group sets the people you’ll fight against
---
Very nice! I don’t know if it’s good or bad, but i feel like, the rabbit the Huntress’ mask depicts with a classic Russian art aesthetic, looks like a traditional american cartoon style here
---
And I hope all your games are againts P3 Nurses. Bad people.
---
Well I haven't tried but I can imagine.
---
It's so few BP I'd gladly trade them to have my anxiety relegated to the threat of not being unhooked over carpal tunnel.
---
With Trapper I often wait till he gets busy. Basically when he downs someone, I'll go break the trap and then the ruin. With hag, I'll just crouch everywhere
---
Bruh you're just spamming this Playlist everywhere I saw it on the gta online subreddit yesterday
---
Hey, thanks for the interest! I'm working on updating them all, I will update the post for you and let you know when they're done. I'm only updating these perks on request now since they're my older ones. I'll try and have them dine by the weekend. :)
---
that confirms the theory that everything in dead by daylight is really small.
---
As a killer main it probably won't be too long until you find it off spawn 1/10 chance if I'm running ruin and devour ruin spanwed next to first gen
---
The game and Haddonfield are my personal favorite maps in for survivors and killer. Even at high ranks i always have a blast on these maps.
---
First up if you can't find the totem or someone else is obviously going for totems just start working on the gens. If you can only hit good checks then my advice is to stop working on the gen when they start sparking from a good hit. You want to do this because if you continue to keep working on the gen while it is paused you run the risk of triggering another skill check and only regressing the generator even more. Also if the killer is camping the totem then they are not patrolling gens which will give you more time to do gens.
---
If you are expecting the devs to not fuck something up when they release a patch, you are ignorant. They are working with spaghetti with even more sauce code.
---
Each side has their own “meta”. Killer is perks like BBQ and Chili, Survivor is stuff like DS(decisive strike).
---
It's a game. It's not a popular e-sport. Fun should probably be a priority
---
Stop living in the past, man... The glory days of Saboteur are long gone. Unless you play in a full SWF that is.
---
Rank 1 survivor and like 13 as killer. I may be a bit of a survivor main lol.
---
This is why i prefer premonition. I know spine chill is the better perk, but the second it goes off i panic.
---
And if killers stops to play the game due to frustration for a poor matchmaking and swf abusing that sht you don't have a game
---
highly questionable
---
Is it deep within an update post? Or is in the title? I've never seen it in an update before knowing about through in-game. And why not on an event page?? I guess I could try following on Twitter, bit I rarely use it.
---
Maybe something needs to be done at red ranks then. Like the higher your rank the more gens you have to do and more BP you get. As it currently stands, the bulk of the player base isn't red ranks
---
I'm fast as fuck, boy
---
he may have had other speed boosts from perks like PWYF or NOED depending on the stage in the game.
---
Yes they got triggered after the DS to Dead hard pallet combo.
---
1000% yes!
---
It should in games.
---
I'm seeing a lot of sweat that disagrees in this one.
---
Except no bleed and you automatically get out
---
Yeah that is pretty ridiculous. Can they not find a happy medium? Survivors are going to get slaughtered..
---
Wait what does reversing the addons do?
---
Clown one is too OP. Every survivor would automatically run towards Ken wanting a peek at his weasel
---
That's a suicide pact, for sure. One SWF player probably rage quit and the other just left with them. That's funny
---
Nope, you get entity displeased
---
Smh Iridescent Mirror doesn't even extend EW3 time. Bad add-on.
---
Greedy.
---
Hangry.
---
I don't really keep up with it myself to be honest- since usually when a bloodpoint even is going to happen I hear about it through word of mouth or from other players, but it was made in a forum post on their website and was kinda tucked into all the other information so unless you actually read the post form top to bottom it kinda got buried under everything else.
---
Doing the god damn Hex skill checks. If you screw one up, stop repairing 2 seconds or 3, then continue. Also a good way to practice hex/great skill checks.
---
Completely disagree sure it’s not going to be a good time for new people who queues with red ranks or even green but it does stop people who get a high rank friend to join so they can “bully” new killers aswell least this way it’s somewhat fair
---
That Claudette is straight out of an early 00's RnB music video.
---
Ahk no worries thanks
---
Not sure why nobody hit you with a downvote, the man didn't know and added it later. No need to be an ass before knowing it was a mistake.
---
Could be because Purple is the uncomfortable area to be in. Yellows are generally new, Greens are generally playing for casual enjoyment, Reds *are* hardcore. To me, Purple is where you end up if you're not good enough for Red... or if the current matchmaking weirdness has put you up against one too many Yellows.
---
If you don't want to be Purple, you'll drop to Green soon enough, so that just leaves a chunk of dissatisfied players frothing at being denied their Red rank (for whatever reason). They're not playing for Bloodpoints, they're playing for their pips.
---
Gotta stack it with the Tuft of Hair or it'd be too OP
---
what?
---
8 on survivor and 16 on killer
---
The pools slow em down
---
Reading this made me want to uninstall
---
Just been looking for a group continuously for at least half an hour on PS4.  Is this game dead?  I tried closing lobby and readying up again. Zero luck.
---
Anyone that played the day knows the main server we all log into before matches are made was done. Ffs if it was totally a p2p the save files would still be hackable
---
So we're punishing 100% of the playerbase over what a small fraction of people did?
---
Well, I wanted to spice my Claudette up. Thanks for the Tip tho
---
Given the hatch to a many survivors, luckily none have said this and if they do, I will hint that person to the end, only for them
---
What’s the hotfix do?
---
Mom of the year.

Weow...

I earn freakin 300$ a month and pay 170 of them for rent, and I don't complain about the price, so neither should you

I take pride in my craftsmanship
---
Hex: Sniper
---
The Entity has hired a sniper to assist you and will take out a survivor every 5 seconds.
---
You put no pressure on the other survivors and let them freely work on gens.
---
Wow this is nice. :)
---
they announce it on Twitter
---
Thats actually exactly what happened. They kept pulling each other off after they tripped a hag trap thing
---
Say sike right now

I've been using toth for Bloodpoints for ages and it was all for nothing. Fml

Groovy Time
---
pro tip - every time you hit a ruin skill check (one that regresses), stop working on the gen for a few secs. you have a higher chance of getting another skill check (I think it’s something like that) right after you get one, thus causing further regression.
---
😄😂😂
---
Wrong

Get rid of pharma and bring the one nancy perk, i forgot the name
---
Wow that is a terrible add-on for him then if you get stunned everytime. I thought it would be cool to use if you could just stab them like 5-times to down them without getting stunned- would make for a really funny chase.
---
Who cares
---
Maybe it got buffed? Idk i don’t use it.
---
I fucking hate ghost face and his no terror radius, always cucks borrowed time too. Fuck spirit too XD
---
I feeling a killer main vibe here, well guess that means i should only play killer now because i cant play with my friends anyway.
---
Was running wake up, self care, balanced and better together for those wondering
---
Because they don't know where exactly you're going. They just know you're going *somewhere* on the map. That survivor was working on the most dangerous generator and just kept working the gen, 'twas a really dumb decision.
---
Oh my bad then. I dont understand how people play bing bong boy without getting bored.
---
"Killer main vibe" Nah, I hate double standards with a passion.
---
Game
---
If you learn the gen spawn patterns, it's fairly easy to find a gen. The gens go as followed
---
Permanent: 1 upstairs gen and 1 gen at fissure
---
Other 5 gens: 2 will always spawn at the corners of the map opposite of the fissure, past the stairs leading upstairs. 3 gens will spawn somewhere in between all of the rooms. 
---
The way I go through the map is find my way to either the stairs or the fissure, as those are pretty much points that you can use as reference, almost like a killer shack or mid building.
---
This update single handedly made playing killer 3 times easier overnight.  I remember being blown away at how efficiently you could down survivors after they removed this cheesy shit.
---
They are fixing that a lot with a hotfix today
---
Oh god did the demigorgon just dab?
---
I'm playing it for the first time in weeks right now on my PS4 Pro and is it just me or have they downgraded the graphics/resolution again a little bit?
---
Really?  I love to mori mask megs haha.  I know it's cliche AF but I'm always gentle with the basic Dwights.  I main David King and show him no mercy.  I know I wouldn't want any.
---
You found 2 people doing a gen and then left them to tunnel the Claudette. You had the opportunity to apply pressure right there and you didn't. Had you actually chased them off the gen, no body would have been working on a gen as the Claudette and her unhooker aren't doing a gen and the two people on the gen you force to run away aren't doing one.
---
Switch is gonna be a power point presentation
---
But double standards only really hit when the things that are talked about are the same, but with killer and survivor you have two completely different games.
---
Yes xD
---
Is anyone else having issues where their daily rituals change on them??? A few times I've reset one, played a game that *should* have completed it, and then after I have a completely different ritual in that spot.
---
This is a weirdly worded post.
---
That's just unfortunately unlucky
---
Gdi Greg... XD
---
Greg is what my friends and I call the demigorgon after a slip of the tongue from our group.. they couldn’t say his name so they said Greg.. and it’s stuck
---
It’s the game not fully saving to the cloud so your progress is perm lost
---
I don't roll it, I whip it side to side. Less motion
---
Solidarity has the second effect of healing you. You physically cant be healed. What secondary effect does it have?
---
DKs are always the cockyiest lol I swear I play more cocky if I switch to him for a daily or something (maybe becuase I run WGLF with borrowed time on him.)
---
Lets hope so, right now he feels lowtier especially since his shred is wanky as hell sometimes
---
What makes them bad people? Healing someone off the ground?
---
Ruin,devour, enduring, spirit fury. Survivors will die
---
I mean, if that fastens up the killer search, I don't care, but it probably won't. 🤷‍♂️
---
Well a SWF would be assigned a "rank", so if that was a 4-man SWF their average would be 10, so they'd face a rank 10 killer.
---
Let's say it was a 2-man SWF (rank 1 and 19), their average would, once again, be rank 10, so the killer would be rank 10 and the other two random survivors would be around 10 as well
---
Steve ;(
---
Lol you willingly gave up those 5 gens when you decided to mindlessly tunnel one survivor.  You may be "proud" of it but that babystrat cost you the game.  You created zero pressure on the other 3 survivors.  Tunneling is bad man lol.  Not because it pisses off survivors but because it loses you games when you aren't facing potatoes.
---
If that's the case, you  probably are overreacting
---
OOTL, someone car to explain?
---
Has that been happening? I’m on console, if it makes a difference.
---
No, making "infinite games"
---
Are you kidding me? You HAD to DC? It was physically impossible for you to look away from the screen for 10 seconds? 
---
That is not an excuse for DCing. Literally just look away if you are too fragile to handle it.
---
I hate this part of the spirit. I propose a change: while the spirit is standing still her power bar starts regressing slowly. That way the spirit has the choice of using their power or faking it, risking a miss and extending a chase.
---
Requires safe hooks and protection hits, I don't even know how you can be an ass with it.
---
I'm farming with it and I always unhook and then bodyblock if the killer comes back because that nets me 2.
---
Savor those moments my friend
---
My general thoughts when I play David King are "Yeah I deserved that."  Or "Yeah.  Fair enough."  Or the Unicorn play *Deliverance*  get downed  "Eat that DS bwahahahah"  *Dead Hard out the gate*
---
Quick question, who is in that picture?
---
Lol, bollocks.
---
When was I an ass? I'm just pointing out that you're being rude by assuming his intentions were ill. You tried to make your comment seem disrespectful with the... at the end. 
---
Me being an ass would be calling you a pos for not asking if he didn't know it was from Farmer John and if he could give credit, but instead just acting like it's a cynical attempt at clout.
---
Vacuum pallets were an old feature of the game - about a meter away from a pallet it seemed, you could get the prompt for throwing a pallet (even older was vacuum vaults too!). If you pressed the action key it would "suck" you to the other side - if the killer tried to swing they would only hit air as the survivor hitbox was already on the other side of the pallet. This gave plenty of time for teabags on the other side of the pallet.
---
Fair enough. I say that cause i often get that BL/DH, Adrenaline, DS, Self Care/OoO survivor who gets unlucky and gets found off hook but hits the DS.
---
I am 14 on killer but I also unplug when it looks like I can't get at least a 2k.  I am legit 16 on surv.
---
Dude chill out 😂
---
What are the best tips you can give me for the spirit?
---
I’m a shape main and I’m used to stealthy gameplay. I really suck as the spirit.
---
I said the same thing then ended up buying all of them and don't regret it.
---
Fortnite = bad Minecraft = good
---
You don’t play against top tier survivors every game, unless you’re bad and they’re just good in comparison. Even at rank 1. Not everyone is a looping god and if so it’s because you’re just not very good
---
&gt; Why would I ever get a game that's going to demand more money from me to play all of it later?
---
Again, you can play the game without paying a single cent after you bought base game. Noone demand nothing from you. You can't even claim the game is p2w.
---
Anyway, it's clear that this discussion is pointless. Have a nice day
---
I want a Mementos map now
---
Oohw. ;-; That's what I was afraid of. I just want an alarm, or notification. Like the Destiny 2 app I have for when the weekend exotic merchant shows up.
---
It really depends of the player, but this buff is for sure an improvement for the killer and will be helpful in lot of scenarios.
---
probably sprint burst
---
At first I was excited, then I read what people were saying and discovered I had it backwards. This just ensures I’ll never play with my friends then as they are all purple and green ranks and I’m at 17/16 . ... granted it’s not like it’s any different from current match making so eh? We shall see how this all works.
---
There are some problems with getting the update so can't even launch yet lmao
---
1 and 1
---
Yep, I'm sure they we're as confused/angry as me with the MM
---
How does that hurt? Something up with your body causing problems? If so, my apologies. If not, I don’t see how it hurts.
---
Extra-Ebony Memento Mori:  All survivors start on hooks.  If any survivor successfully escapes the hook, the hook collapses on them, killing them instantly.

Nah I don't think I will, I'll gladly call you on your BS if you're going to be rude.

Demise of the faithful has good perks if ur an experienced player, I wouldn’t really recommend it for someone new. The plague is a meh killer, and you defo need other perks than base to run her properly. I know you picked out a few, but depending on ur preferred playstyle, I’d suggest the Halloween chapter, or the leatherface for a first dlc purchase. Myers has decent perks, and Laurie has ds which is major. leatherface has a staple perk, bbq, and mid tier other 2 perks. if ur gonna play survivor tho, you really don’t need dlc for the best perks. you have nea (balanced landing) meg (adrenaline) bill (borrowed time) and David (dead hard) who are all free.
---
iends don't k
---
Precision German engineering on that chainsaw!
---
Still not as worst as instablinds tho...You could literally blind a killer mid chase and they wouldn't have time to react plus the very slow pickup animation and being able to blind them from the very side and in under 0.5 seconds. Nothing will be as broken as the very old instablinds
---
You get points for it after hooking the survivor too...
---
Often times totems spawn close to gens. Hex totems will have a crackle sound, like you're burning a log, and that's your audio cue that it's close by.
---
He’s one big doof then

Thats not what the title implies at all

Coming from you targeting me and not the post haha you’re funny

I'm with you I sincerely have zero clue how those people hope to play this game on there.  If you want a good laugh look up what their multiplayer experience is like playing Mario Maker 2.  Runs like a Tiger Wrist Watch Game.
---
Follow them on Twitter. Or join some discord (your favorite streamer, for example), people will inform you
---
I would get The Demogorgon, his shred grants 800 blood points along with the 300 for a hit, making him great for farming blood points while not completely throwing. He is also overall fun to play with.
---
Yeah all I saw was lag
---
Well that's fucked
---
Thanks to the long queues and matchmaking errors my friend ended up not buying. He said “it’s hard to believe this game is out for 3 years and it still seems to be in an alpha test”.
---
Honestly I feel like the matchmaking and being able to start the game are much more important than any of the bugs. If you can’t even start the game then that’s pretty much nothing but an interactive screen.
---
Yeah that makes sense.  It's about 4pm here. Not a good sign for the future of this game I fear.
---
This is what you get for working on electrical equipment without proper PPE!
---
Pallet City!
---
Not many things more frustrating than getting one hooked or two hooked. The best is when you’re getting face camped and the three survivors just stay crouched around the hook for the entire duration. Then run off once you die. Or do that and then when you start struggling they run in and get you without Borrowed Time.
---
As a Doctor main I love that map. Easy way to get quitter bonuses.
---
Doctor is hard to play and even harder to win with for most however is fun to play. With spirit I’d get her dlc for deliverance and her perks as all 4 are incredibly solid.
---
Why? They are both good games in their own right.

Oh it's dying light that causes these issues

Yesterday I had such a good round as Myers and just as I hooked a survivor my game crashed
---
We did a pretty good job so far
---
More matchmaking broken spam, hurray
---
Looking back I could've turned off the TV but I hurt myself more than him because I double depiped and lost my bp, if it were any other mori I would've been fine but you clearly don't have a fear of clowns and have intrusive thoughts about fingers falling off.
---
But anyway I never DC unless the match is a huge pile of BMing and that's probably the first time I DCed on a mori.
---
What? I can't even make out what you're trying to say
---
Is it worth buying cosmetics? I really want to get some for ghostface as they look really cool but I really get off put by just how much they cost. Do they ever go on sale?

Nah he was just salty because he didn't have a fun game.  Only go for those kind of rescues if you're confident you'll pull it off.
---
Im really done of playing against rank 2-5 when im 15-20 ffs
---
I mean, he didn’t give you hatch. You just happened to find it and instead of saving him, you waited at the hatch until he died on the hook.
---
This is not accurate. The majority of matchmaking posts on here are screenshots of low rank killers going against a squad with multiple red ranks. And I didn't say anything about taking vengeance lol. Just pointing out the hypocrisy.
---
Yeh
---
Hi thanks for the reply but I'll play much more and will have more fun if i play with killer that I like.
---
I'm not a big fan of Myers although he may be easy or recomended for me.
---
What do you think of the Demogorgon as u/Zauson said?
---
did you restart your console?
---
Rank 4 survivor
---
Reeeeee
---
Lol my rank 18 sister played with a rank 12 killer and he took her to the hatch, (she didn't wiggle), he hooked her right next to the hatch instead and just looked back and forth at the hatch and her. So mean!! 😂
---
To be honest I started playing since game pass so a few months now and all these bugs you complain about I only encountered once. Ive not been able to heal or do anything one time and I actually fixed it by pressing start and sitting at the pause menu for like 5 seconds. It could have been a coincidence that my game synced back up, but I don't have that bad luck. Maybe your upload speed is bad, have you checked your network?
---
And, lobby dodge if you're that upset about the idea tbat new players will get you killed. I personally just stay in because I play to have fun and even if I play with newer players, I'll stick around and watch them to message them tips. Such as, "don't try to instantly unhook yourself." Surprisingly, a lot of new players don't understand why that is bad. Also, if I get camped, I message them that I am being camped and to just work on gens, then I may try to kobe myself. That is also on the off-chance I get caught. Now, I'm not saying I'm the best survivor because believe me I can be a potato too, but that is life.
---
Finally I would like to address your concern of camping and double pipping. You literally told us why it is bad for new players to Insta-camp. Now, lets assume a brand new player starts as killer and camps all his/her life. As they rank up, they will pip less and potentially even depip against better survivors. That's when they will realize there are other things to do depending on the situation. They will then have to get better instead of constantly Insta-camping. Unless it still works at higher ranks (it shouldn't?).
---
So, try LFG and playing SWF either through LFG or with actual friends, or stop playing the game. It is meant to be fun, dont let the stress get to you.
---
*Dead By Winter*
---
It works like BBQ and chilli do with BPS. If i get 20k in the match i get 20k from BPS, 20k from BBQ and 20k from x2 weekend.
---
115% movement speed is slow? Weird flex but okay .
---
Haven't gotten the update, still says to check store if it can be played.
---
you need to own a killer, and level him/her up to unlock their teachables which allows them to show up on other killers webs. or you can get them from the shrine, but usually that’s not worth the wait.
---
So let the survivors play against the red ranks, by your own words they will learn more.
---
Right this way, sir.
---
All the wheels work great?
---
If everyone cleanse YOU should cleanse. You died because of your lack of brain cells.
---
Do we include chewing? If so...
---
Like you’re chewing rubber with granite sprinkled over it.
---
The way to get through this is knowing how to fake it, this is very useful and granted me lot of free hits, trust me on that ;)
---
I mean it IS technically a horror game, and that is a very horror game - like mechanic.
---
While I agree it should be skewed towards highest instead of just highest, most people against this change are missing one factor: SWF usually have an external communication \[Discord/Steam/Whatever\] - this alone gives a massive advantage over solo queueing and it makes it much more fair than if you were against a guy 10 ranks above you queuing alone \[which a lot of people get already with current matchmaking\].  
---
So overall I think it's a good change, improvable, but in the correct direction.
---
np
---
Lol sure it makes the survivors bad for playing into a camper but you are framing this like the killer isn't a no skill trashcan for camping survivors to death on their end.  And campers don't "best" anyone.  They camp specifically so they don't have to outplay the opponent.
---
That's incredible! I love everything about this.
---
I think second wind is fine as it is, it allows you to go back to working objectives rather than either waiting to get healed or god forbid using self care.  
---
I've been running it with Inner Strength, Bond and Adrenaline for my "Cockroach Steve" build.
---
Doesn't I'm all ears have a range cause alert doesn't
---
Aw man I was just joking - no reason to lose your head over it!
---
Here we go bois! 
---
They changed something to fix matchmaking and now (as expected) the complaints about queue times will take the place of "nIcE mAtChMaKiNg" screenshots. 
---
BHVR will never win this battle and we will be the ones suffering the causalities, having to endure the nonstop spam of new threads. 
---
&gt;Adjusted the matchmaking logic so that Survive With Friends groups are matched using the highest rank of all players in the group (instead of the average). The 3.2.0 patch introduced an issue that caused Survive With Friends group matchmaking to be skewed towards Rank 20, which is also fixed with this change.
---
That's a fair point.  However, the algorithm will continue to skew downwards even with this change for the same reason.  Even if you have a rank 1 survivor on your team doesn't mean that there will be a rank 1 killer for you to play against, so I guarantee that for most matches you'll be going 5 levels lower than your highest rank.  If you're highest rank is 1 you'll probably play against level 5 killers, level 5's with level 10 killers etc etc.  And that seems pretty fair to me doesn't that seem fair to you too?
---
I’m assuming u mean ds, which is decisive strike. it’s a Laurie teachable, and if makes it so you if the killer picks you up within 40/50/60 seconds after you’ve been unhooked, you get a skill check which allows you to escape the killers grasp instantly if you hit it. if you meant dc, that just simply means disconnect/disconnecting.
---
She's my favorite killer to play as, but she's honestly real hard to learn and unless you're fine with the learning curve, I'd probably go with a different killer to start with. I'd say Michael or Doctor, and *maybe* Leatherface are good starters
---
Is that eggos on the left and dustin's hat on the right?
---
Billy may be top tier, but god damn is it impossible to pip with him. Chases end too quick and if you're a good billy, people usually just kill themselves on hook. Denying you of your precious hooks, making me cry. Then I switch to freddy :)
---
didnt know this and will now always do this
---
The issue is called "no many people enjoy playing survivor". If 1000 players want to play killer there need to be 4000 players who want to play survivor for almost instant queues. Now imagine if there are only 3000... This is how you get long queues.
---
Assuming everyone is motivated enough to do that instead of refunding the game. I dont agree with how it used to be but I dont agree with how it is now either.
---
For the survivors I get they don't get easily faked out like they just fucking somehow has telepathy and know what I'm gonna do,
---
that helps a lot, thank you u/isaacjonesm !
---
Thank you so much for thiiiis! XD
---
Fuck the swamp
---
Kek, tentative... Oh Boi.
---
just... chill out guys.
---
There definitely exists good ranking systems. Just not in this game.  
---
&gt;"But that's what I meant!"  
---
Then be specific.
---
&gt; Not sure when gamers became so soft.
---
There's nothing "softer" than talking shit from a place of complete safety and comfort.
---
I’ve been getting back into the game after about 8 months and I used to be a rank 1 killer but I have degraded back to rank 19( though I was under the assumption that you can’t got past 15 anymore) most games I play are super easy but then sometimes I get that rank 1 toxic survivor that hits me like a semi.
---
yes, search up how to make a sub account, it’s super easy. and matchmaking is all fucked rn so it wouldn’t matter a ton
---
By then the people aren't going to bother with it, they'll only be focused in getting out, usually only go after a hex endgame when it's NOED
---
so is matchmaking perfect yet?
---
Not sure I follow the logic on why it isn't a good sign - it's rated 18 or M depending on your region, seems odd to me to expect there to be a significant population ingame Mon-Fri during the day.
---
That's also before you even factor in the asymmetric play - have you tried finding a match as both killer *and* survivor?
---
I just dip when I get matched with red ranks
---
Just continue doing that, they can't predict forever.
---
That’s okay, I’m sure the rank 20 killer will manage.
---
I’m saying that it’d be almost more unplayable than PS4... Just because others run it doesn’t mean it’s fine.
---
Of course it is.
---
Yes, this is how they fix couple of problems with matchmaking
---
Dunno
---
Unrelated note, I run agitation, iron grasp, brutal strength, and unwavering on my trapper. SLAPPY SLAP!
---
Have a gander at the person(s) dropping a deuce in the unkempt grass.

I really don't like Scoops Steve.

Now I understand why suddenly bill, bill, bill, song soudned in my head before I turned the audio on.
---
I was in a game like this. On Hawkings. Against a good Ghostface. 
---
I was standing in a puddle of my own piss the whole game.
---
^this ^image ^gives ^me ^the ^simplest ^of ^joys ^and ^I ^love ^it ❤️
---
Absolutely
---
*tonight I dine on turtle soup*
---
Am I the only one who’s team Feng?
---
Yeah, but there were a LOT of issues and then they said it was going to be during fall
---
The new matchmaking system (where it tried to make a balanced game based on the ranks of each player) got scrapped.
---
They reverted to the old matchmaking system of only one person's rank mattering. They now use the highest rank instead of the  lowest rank.
---
You can decide if that's fixed.
---
That was cool but youre playing p3 quinton so this is invalid
---
Yea I know it's a learning process and stuff but shit have I've been getting demolished as the demogorgon so I'm hoping this buff helps me a bit
---
Thanks but I have one more maybe final question and that is what do you think of the spirit?
---
You’re just gonna disrespect The Goblin King like that?
---
What you thought it fair for three reds and one rank 20 to fight a rank 20 killer lmao?
---
This blurry mess gives me a headache :(
---
Remember killers: if you bump graphics up to Ultra, scratches will go under the grass instead of on top. So if you're thinking "may as well play on Ultra if it's all gonna be blurry," you'll wanna stop at High graphics settings (at least for PC)
---
Hell yeah, Demogorgon buffs!!! Not sure if this is not way too strong, we will see, however red addon providing ability to destroy pallets with Shred was just laughable.
---
Welp... here we go agane
---
Pig should be able to break pallets with the dash attack if this is the standard. Yeah it would look dumb but it takes longer to activate the dash than it does the shred attack and Pig is already less mobile than the Demo to begin win.
---
The best part about this comment is It’s a valid form of argument. It’d called “reductio ad absurdum” or reduction to absurdity.

Get a group together and train them in KYF... There IS a dbd discord you can join and play KYF if you can’t manage a group of 5.

Can i at least ask what the face is?
---
**INTENSE GROWLING, NOBODY CALLS ME TUBBY!!**
---
high tier killer, super hard to loop if they are good. you have to understand her playstyle, but when you do she’s insane. I like to play her mindgame heavy, with add ons to reduce the charge time of her phase and a reduced cooldown time. she has a staple meta perk, spirit fury, a decent strat perk, haunted ground, and a mid tier meme perk, rancor, which gives u some vision (I use it in place of bbq when I haven’t gotten it in my web yet) and allows you to mori the obsession when the exit gates are powered. I actually leveled her up second, after nurse, because when I joined I wanted to be a pro killer main lol. honestly she’s so good I don’t play her much, and I hate playing against her. Then again, I hate any killer that you can’t tell where they are instantly (looking at u, Freddy)
---
I mean, that’s every killer’s nightmare..
---
The worst is playing on  swamps and seeing him coming through the tall grass all jolly and shit (because of the way he runs) about stab you.
---
99% of lag happens in the chases when the killer is on the shit end of the stick soooo yeah. Almost certainly every time you have lag like this it's a lag switch.
---
I'm 99% positive it should work, considering the switch and switch lite have almost identical hardware inside.  The only thing is you wouldn't be able to play docked, and would have to exclusively play in handheld mode, so take that into consideration.
---
Why calm spirit? I mean doctor can be a pain sometimes so I get it, though I think something like lightweight would be more useful. That reduced uptime for scratch marks can sometimes lose a killer mid chase before you even get into a locker.
---
I mean, I remember statistics earlier showing that the game has the least average escapes of any map, but I still hate it as killer because I always get lost.
---
I mean it can be both. Now everyone can know a demo can break pallet, rather then being surprised with an addon. Though i do think it should of been on a cooldown the ability to break pallets. He charges his dash up so fast and i don't know if he really suffers from any cool down when destroying a pallet with power.
---
it'll absolutely work!
---
Yep I miss those offerings though they were my favorite.
---
Your playing with players who are at the rank you should be. The dbd admins reviewed your games and use that for your matchmaking
---
I know i'm not the only one with the username in my region who plays DBD, they throw hard lol. I don't though :)
---
You're right if DBD devs make a change that you don't like it's literally (not figuratively) the end of the world.  I know I'm shitting pants scared right now.
---
Thanks, just got it in Eastern US
---
It's not hard to follow surely? A successful game will be populated well, a dying game won't be, age ratings or not. A new chapter has just been released and here we are...
---
Cod is 18 rated, no issues getting a game any time anywhere for example.
---
Even as a survivor, I hated vacuum pallets. Would get sucked it, but it would be on the wrong side. Or into the killer's loving arms.
---
He's just happy he's about to have some food. I would be all jolly too if I got some num nums.
---
No, I think it’s more fair to find a more equal ground, my swf is me rank 13, another rank 3, a random and a rank 18 and we get a rank 5 killer
---
Lmao no it's not. It literally just takes a few games to get it down. Also add ons make a world of difference.  Its why everyone plays him. You can be brain dead and do great with him or actually be good and do amazing.
---
Sweet so that means it’s the first one thanks :)
---
I'm up for the grind and that's what I'm looking for a killer to lvl up. Also I might buy ghost face as a started and will see later on. Thanks for the help tho, it really helped.
---
Finally someone intelligent :0
---
It doesn’t make sense to me, what is the joke?
---
Ugh, I hate it. Makes my eyes hurt and feeling like I'm not wearing glasses ;\_\_;
---
All three of us escaped after that. Definitely fucked up by getting in the locker tho, wasn’t expecting him to be so close lol
---
Yeah. Intelligent and downvoted. Guessing the guy who commented doesn’t like reason and logic.
---
LOL...sure, that was a good one
---
Just the Devs. They slow. 
---
It is faster since they work on balance on mid chapter patches, but killer reworks are not a high priority.
---
Or they could just make you hold a button-down. Same for when you're struggling on the hook. Stick-wiggling and button mashing is annoying.
---
Army of ashness
---
Wdym?
---
I used to fast vault into lockers to counter bbq. ah, the bad old days.
---
I tried it before. I just like having the awareness to be as far away as possible. It's like Alert (is that the one where you see the aura whenever they break gens or pallets?) it just helps to know. 
---
With Bond I didn't feel like it benefitted me as much personally. It was nice but seeing them on a gen I was already going to or seeing where they are within 32 didn't help me as much. It's a good perk, don't get me wrong, but I like my mapwide awareness
---
I’d probably change Sprint Burst to just be a little bit longer. Like 2 seconds or so. Just make it a bit more viable as a “off the hook run” perk.
---
What can you do? Redditors will be redditors
---
They absolutely will fuck something up. But they also have a test period and a variable release date. The ***amount*** of big game breaking bugs in this patch is insane. Defending them shows your own ignorance.
---
He would be more like the entity than a killer.
---
DC’s are always funny cuz the survivor just drops lol
---
My friends dont care enough to practice instead of playing for fun, so thats all I can say for that matter.
---
If you drop them at the hatch. And they say GG Easy. How does this make you mad? Like, you know what happened - and they are just being a tool. I really don't understand how people get so upset...
---
no that would take away from feel of the struggle
---
it's alright man this is probably the only excuse to DC that is valid
---
“But I also unplug when it looks like I can’t get at least a 2k”
---
“unplug”
---
Me, someone who loves playing killer, but accepts I will have 0-1k matches sometimes: well, off to **hang myself.**
---
The perfect noed counter.
---
I'm sure I'm in the upper spectrum of the playerbase at 34 years of age; but it seems really stupid to me that every single mechanic in the game is labeled as being "toxic"...
---
When I played basketball competitively and the elite players dropped 35 on me while trashtalking me the whole time I would've been laughed out of the gym by my whole team if I complained about "toxicity"...you kids have no idea what toxic behavior even is.
---
Now git off mah lawn, I gotta level up my old man Ash.
---
How tf you guys play nurse w.o getting dizzy?
---
Actually sounds like a really fun idea. Would make pallet play with ambush more interesting and wouldn't make her much faster at breaking pallets if she uses it after it's dropped.
---
Hello darkness my old friend
---
unless the killer is using it so you *don't* use your item. Making them go back to look for it is one way to use the perk, but just getting rid of the items for good is also quite desirable
---
Th only fix to the awful, blurry AA the game has had forever was to play on Low. Now even that doesn't help. And now since the "fix" to bad hair is forcing on the blurry AA instead of actually taking the effort to make it look good, we may be stuck with it forever.
---
Yesterday my controller died while struggling. So theres that.
---
Best meme in this sub
---
When mom comes to check on you and you're supposed to be asleep
---
np. I’ve played this game only a few months but I’ve put 400 hours in and I like to think I learn quickly. I know how frustrating dbd can be when ur new, especially if u come from a game like fortnite or siege, where dying always = losing. it was a hard adjustment to die so often at first lol.
---
&gt; Also that SWF change, maybe finally it will work as it should be and red ranks won't be farming rank 20 killers anymore. I hope so.
---
Unfortunately this also means red rank people can't help their new friends learn the game anymore without getting absolutely dicked on unless they get on a smurf account or something.  Good try, good effort BHVR.
---
They messed up matchmaking with the update last week to where even 12's and whatnot were being matched with 17-20 ranked killers and now they're just swinging it back the complete opposite direction instead of reverting it to what it was before the update messed it up.  It's hilariously stupid.
---
how many times the controllers die?
---
Hex: Aight Ima head Out
---
A hex rooting its power on bullshit
---
While this totem is standing, all survivors get a ping increase of 100/200/300 ms and their PC catches on fire if they stun the killer in any way
---
*"out of the womb and into the tomb" - The Demogorgon*
---
They do go on sale from time to time, yes.
---
As for "worth", that's really up to you. Certain cosmetics may confer an advantage by making you harder to see (or easier to see, if you're running that kind of build), but generally it's just style points.
---
I guess don't swf with your buddy who you finally convinced try the game LOL
---
Then you’ve done all you can for them and you get to play killers your rank and watch them suffer at the same time. I see this as an absolute win for you
---
I'm perfectly fine with that. They could make it changeable in the settings if people care that much. Still annoying as hell and not really fun to do.
---
New killer : The American Goth Kid
---
How...
---
As killer, this upsets me
---
**now every match I have is gonna have at least 1-2 baby dweets**
---
no dedicated servers yet :(
---
Wait... "highest rank" for matchmaking... so high to 20 or high to 1? cause i just got a swf with a rank 2 and a rank 3 in it while i was rank 7
---
First time it ever happened. But I hate spamming a button. Sometimes I miss a tap and just die. They should just make a "give up" button. After 10s it will just kill you.
---
Hex : Allah Akbar
---
It is a good time waster perk though
---
They should give a option for ppl who don’t find it cute. I for one find it really stupid and when even a hint of lag happens bam you die it’s a bad Mechanic for me anyway and they should give users a option
---
Actually I really like that, it fits a lot better with coach and is a lot more balanced. You're a lot better at perks than me haha
---
Ashley you will never find the truth
---
the fact that you got most of them is pretty impressive though, (and with only one perk too, what kind of red rankers are these guys). Good work man.
---
I want a happy ending for Bing Bongathan.
---
Lol rank 1's can't teach baby survs how to 🔦 spam fingerpoint and teabag
---
You still got almost all of them good job. Also theyre updating this in the hotfix i think so it will go with the highest rank player instead of the lowest.
---
Kill on person without having to hook them.  Ahhhhhh balance...
---
y'all are so lazy
---
TUTTI F'N FRUITY
---
Yes. I’m All Ears will still show you their aura even if they use Quick and Quiet. IAE is the counter to QAQ so if you somehow find people juking you with it constantly, running All Ears will help.
---
Wait no chest spawn impossible
---
If anyone doesn’t follow BHVR’s Twitter (like myself); the Switch version is still unavailable due to an issue with the game’s day 1 update

Please fix the slowness and frame rate issues, and the scratch marks disappearing for killers.

yeah, but compared to Cannibal, the Demogorgon can stealth teleport also.

That SWF change is more than welcome. Smurfin' bullies will get the treatment they deserve now.
---
oh thats why i was always caught across the map
---
Do pink hair Neas get a toxic guide with their cosmetic purchase?
---
I agree it’s kind of har to design a character in a gang who only steals
---
I believe that it does, since it can technically gain the benefits of it if you're running a speed limitier. (The same is true of NOED.)
---
It's actually just some hobo who found Jakes clothes
---
chill survivors
---
Y'all are over analyzing a meme lmao
---
That was my goal thank you sir
---
Same here! It's not every time, but somewhat frequently it happens. I play on Xbox and this morning I swapped out my daily for a different one. I completed my objective after a match and returned to the main screen, checked dailys again because I realized I forgot to claim it, only to find out it had been changed entirely! However, my new-new one was for more blood points, so I didn't really mind doing it, I guess. Though I can see it being a bigger issue if you did the Mori-based daily and didn't even get your bloodpoints afterwards...
---
Yup, that's Alert
---
I will just say that in general, the info that Bond gives you is more relevant, so it totally outshines Empathy.
---
But, as with anything, there will always be people that find the niche part of something more valuable than what the more reliable counterpart offers
---
I’ll be honest I don’t care for baby Dwight memes I treat them the same as any other player
---
Yeah that’s a dick thing to do
---
I ain't got nothing better to do
---
It's a very thick guitar pick
---
I literally just jumped on Reddit to look for a solution. Looks like it’s just XBox players. The reset worked for me too!
---
Why does everyone feel the need to spam about the matchmaking being broken, WE KNOW
---
It's all good, your other ideas were really good. I like the idea of sugar rush as it's like a polar opposite to second wind. Seeing how many times second wind has saved people in my games, sugar rush would be a very fun situational perk
---
Seems like a valid strat. Killer leaves you a pallet to use but not your item.
---
Yeah, this is how the game is gonna look now. Before, only Medium, High and Ultra settings had this blur (antialiasing), now they added it to Low as well. It can't be disabled, it's gonna look like that until the devs decide to use a better antialiasing method (which I don't see happening any time soon).
---
When you shine light through a prism
---
I too, am a baby steve. I was told to go on dweet, but who can resist Steve 'The Hair" Harrington?
---
Rotate the joystick in a circle, it does it just as fast but it won't damage your stick from slapping it from side to side
---
Well darn, so I should have just died with him then.
---
They already said dedicated servers needed more work. Better to wait for the good version.
---
I got it, buff the pig so the drill and saw cosmetics will break the pallet!
---
https://i.redd.it/caw6qzocov621.jpg
---
Thanks that might be it. I'll try and restart on ultra settings.
---
It literally happens in the first 5 seconds LOL
---
My fps drop to 30 when I switch to High or Ultra and I've never had such problem lol
---
I knew Dwight was a killer all along
---
i will never do it
---
Why are steve's cheeks bulging out?
---
Valid point, but my intent was more the thematic standard of humans with chainsaws and etheral nether creatures being on a similarly higher power level than lady with an assassin's creed cosplay spike.
---
There should be a brown mori that lets the killer kill himself.
---
Yeah i play trapper a lot and this made me really sad because I feel like survivors knew of this bug and were disarming more than usual.
---
He literally spawns on Ruin. He finds it in a second of the match starting. The totem spawn is completely broken.
---
Wha-
---
I like it! Very nice.
---
I don't like fortnite but yeah I got the point.
---
oh boy i hope i don't run into you with my Rush of Spring Ace
---
I just had a game where I had absolutely wrecked them (3 dead with only 1 gen finished) and the poor Nancy at the exit gate just stood there and shook her head no at me. 
---
I felt sorry for her so I smacked the gate and let her escape. She dropped her med kit at my feet for some reason? I guess as a respect sort of thing.
---
Then in the post game I look and I got 3 iris and 1 gold emblem.. I missed my damn double pip becuase of it lol feelsbadman.
---
I hate that the game makes you decide between being nice and ranking up.
---
This is literally the change I've seen numerous survivors beg for on this sub.  If you're a red rank survivor playing with noobs you're friends with you shouldn't get to bully a babykiller.  This is a good change and will make it harder for swf to play to bully the killer through inept matchmaking.  You already have the massive benefit of constant communication.  You guys can still do your thing it just means you'll have to teach your friends how to beat actual killers instead of smurfing your way through games.
---
10/10 updates
---
200 likes im buying dat scoops ahoy hat lets get there bois
---
Who knows? I can’t speak for the devs. It was probably implemented to make end game harder, like blood warden. 
---
Also, it’s a game, it’s not like you’re risking your actual life. It won’t hurt you to not make it out. 5k bloodpoints sure, but realistically that is one perk or add on. 
---
And like I said before, maybe the hex totem is like 15ft from the gate. You never know.
---
Seasalt flavor?
---
I'd make Technician have 100% chance to prevent failed skill checks notification and have a decreased skill check chance.
---
Make it very good for new players and a nice counter to Ruin if people need it.
---
Definitly not
---
I think Open Handed from Ace could use a rework.  It really just banks on your allies having aura reading skills and it's not a huge buff to them for a perk slot.
---
Even on ultra it's still blurry. Are you having the same issue by any chance? Or is it just my game...
---
They wanted to see if they could go without using the key
---
Well, thats a big yikes. 
---
Thanks though
---
&gt; https://redd.it/d8p8fb
---
It's good ice cream
---
No I dont because I am a grown man playing a mature rated game.
---
Alright everyone I admit defeat this is actually a good thing alright you win, I see the master plan, since the matchmaking was broken so much before we are all at higher ranks but once i lose enough badly I’ll de rank to a level of my TRUE skill and everything will be alright again...if not we’ll find some new friends to play with or stay with killer
---
As a gen jockey, I love this so much.
---
Yes choosing a cosmetic makes you bad
---
Why the heck is mouse sensitivity faster again? I am litterally sitting at 0% already and it's still too fast.
---
If I’m playing killer using franklins and someone’s key falls under a pallet I’m sure as shit not breaking it
---
I was originally only leveling Doctor for the M&amp;A teachable on Myers. I’ve found that I’m pretty good with Legion, and I’m absolutely interested in learning Huntress once I get enough perks/addons on her.
---
Unfortunately, I’ve already bought all the DLC up to Ash. I typically reroll any survivor dailies (I get pretty immersed and my anxiety goes off the charts) and any killers I’m not good at/interested in learning.
---
I’ll definitely start doing that once I get more perks. I originally thought doing it with very few teachables was best, so you’re more likely to get the ones you’re looking for. I’ve got BBQ and Ruin already (Shrine), so what would you recommend I go for next? I was considering Spirit Fury and Enduring, but after that I’m not sure.
---
Psychokinesis is just a demo perk and a spirit perk rolled into one that also applies to dropped pallets, clairvoyance is just bitter murmer with a blind added to it
---
Smart, ima do this
---
You missed the point, you posted a full video about something that was likely already reported to BHVR. Not to mention it didn’t happen to you, you watched a YT video and felt the need to share it on the reddit, despite it having nothing to do with you. 
---
People complaining about the game and their own experiences is bad enough, but you’re complaining about the game and someone else’s experience brings it to a fresh level of cringe.
---
Being scared of an animation?? That's probably the least legit reason lmao
---
It’s not a feeling of struggle, it’s just flat out annoying.
---
Yeah, this is what I tend to do. Love it when I see a Demo drop a portal at a hook with no gens near it.
---
Not true, and also not what I said. From my experience and the experience of watching many, many streams, pink hair Neas are the most toxic players in the game.
---
Can you defend why it should stay the way it is? Currently it’s bad game design. Not my opinion. But by today’s standards, it doesn’t make sense the way it is. The point of game design is to make your game as intuitive as possible
---
Really? I’ve been finding really good success on him even at higher ranks.
---
Imagine having to deal with a 4 man official instructions swf
---
I'm a rank 16 Survivor and a rank 13 killer and I don't know how to loop or defend against the loop, how have I made it this far?
---
-mmu!
---
Okay, sure, but he's barely even taken a bite of it. Looks a little goofy (though that's probably the intent). 
---
Still pretty nice work nonetheless.
---
Another example of why mercy is a mistake.
---
He specified all game camping killer.  Is he supposed to voluntarily offer a trashcan like that a 4K to be nice?  If Op's account of the game is accurate it's the random that was toxic here.  Reminds me of all the messages I got calling me trash for not saving a random against an Insidious Bubba.  An Insidious Bubba.........
---
Awaken my masters
---
The second the DLC dropped I was going to give people party streamers for easy bloodpoints. Only issue was I was playing trapper and I spent 5 games pushing survivors to traps I had set, appeared to be set, but when arriving there after pushing a survivor to it, it was deactivated.
---
*cries in trapper*
---
Uhm...they released a hotfix that was supposed to fix this. I don't know if you haven't heard about it.  - Adjusted the matchmaking logic so that Survive With Friends groups are matched using the highest rank of all players in the group (instead of the average). The 3.2.0 patch introduced an issue that caused Survive With Friends group matchmaking to be skewed towards Rank 20, which is also fixed with this change.
---
Yeah.  Like I said.  Wish I hadn't bought the Demogorgon now lol.
---
I'd be down for that. Would love that buff on the Pig.
---
I mean, if you give them the hatch, they probably did think that it was a good game, and an easy one as well.
---
Thanks for looking at it impartially. Yeah obviously there’s a lot of over complaining, entitles survivors, but sometimes the game is generally not fun because of piss poor treatment. I know made up rules are stupid, but the game is just very unenjoyable without them. Even as a killer I don’t camp or tunnel (unless it’s really needed), because I want to have a good time and try and help everyone else have a good time.
---
Doesn't seem that great imo shred recovery will be the best add-ons still until people master demo and never miss.
---
On certain maps like Lery’s, The Game and Hawkins it’ll be good. Open maps, not so much.
---
Well as a rank 16 killer (dont flame me) i just got a game with , 2 survivors at rank 9 and 2 ranks at rank 8. All running medkits and teabagging infront of pallets.
---
Yeah, that’s true. But I think this will work better for killers who are say, rank 10 and up. Because bringing in someone with a higher rank would typically take red ranks (if in the swf) to that higher rank. Which I think is they were worried about fixing
---
Why he arm so long
---
They are planning on adding to the stealth killers soon, from what they said in the 3.2.0 patch notes. Just a matter of time.
---
Honestly this comment made me happy, thank you!
---
I’m well aware, you’re about the 12th person to post about it still being busted. For the love of Christ, we k n o w.
---
I'm genuinely interested in hearing peoples responses.  The moment they announced this game I was dumbfounded at how the Switch could possibly handle it.  Let me know how your games are if and when you can actually get it to load.
---
where's the full vid?
---
I try. I know I’m not the best at the game, but I’ve seen how toxic this community can get, so I want to try to balance it out. Even if it’s just me.
---
They don't double up.
---
A game of 20k will give you 40k with a streamer, 60k with a streamer and blood hunt.
---
She only works against idiots otherwise she's no better than an M1 killer imo
---
i like the idea of all killer emotes just being jumpscares and other spooky dicketry, like jumping around a corner and hopping up from behind cover.
---
The way I see it I can throw my friends into the fire of decent and good killers and they’ll learn the dos and don’ts faster
---
Out of curiosity, what rank are you? I've never experienced this. Sometimes I'll have people insist on healing me first or refuse to heal me, but usually if you wave and teabag, they'll comply.
---
Literally. My brother just got the game. He’s rank 20, I’m rank 1. Now we can’t play together.
---
It has happened to my wife a lot, but only once to me. I put in a support ticket and BHVR gave me another daily and an apology. 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Can you explain more? That’s not a very good answer.
---
I AM A FREAKIN BLUR HER !
---
**ENTITY PLEASED**
---
Can't be disabled sadly
---
Leaving the lobby is actually working way better than that. Exact type of response I'd expect from somebody who puts a ton of energy into posting on reddit, btw. Be more stereotypical and boring.
---
that’s irritating. im on console and have yet to see that. guess I’m one of the lucky ones. I know I’d be really pissed tho
---
I'm more surprised that it was a 4k tbh.
---
You sound like you’re doing pretty alright for yourself man. LoOpiNg is just watching the killers red stain, running in circles for the most part ahahaha😂😂
---
Barbebue and Billi level one (\*|:-)
---
No flames. But damn, guess it's just still broken all around. I'm personally a rank 4 survivor so I know it can be unfair but I try not to be toxic. Sorry to hear about your experience lol.
---
You're being obtuse for absolutely no reason. Pretty much every killer playing with a Hex has experienced this. This is a clear example with hard video evidence of something unacceptable happening. I don't have a good rig (yet) that can capture my own stream. TrueTalent is also a really well known figure in the community? In what dimension of mental gymnastics did I do anything wrong posting this?
---
hahaha keep me posted!!!
---
The Killer still won to be fair.
---
Only idiots cleanse against plague.
---
Not every rank 1 is an asshole
---
Playing plague is unpopular in the realm of fun? I love her tbh.  And cold wind farm is a great map.
---
Isn't that kinda the point of the game? Jokes aside, the devs have said before that the goal is to have a 50/50 on surviving and being sacrificed
---
Which is weird as the day 1 patch has installed (for me at least) so...any update on the hold out?
---
No it isn't, if the killer is camping and there only 2 survivors left, the person on the hook should kill themselves so the last person has a chance.
---
This has happened to me as well and has been mentioned around here and by streamers so it's a known bug.
---
That is fixed. I play with friends who are low rank all the time and they should be playing against killer at my rank instead of killer at their rank and they think they’re not shit cause they juked a rank 20 Clown with T1 Bamboozle.
---
Okay, these perks are actually really good. The names don’t fit, but the perks are actually good enough to be put in the game.
---
Yeah it's all opinion in the end
---
Maybe they should revert the change so it's not so useless anymore.
---
Suimori
---
The killers have a red stain?
---
The latest update my Switch grabs is 3.2.0, so I’m assuming BHVR is trying to get 3.2.1 out
---
Still waiting for Gamestop to send me my code.  I just wanna play DbD on the go.
---
You wanna make console players encounter a pc nurse ? You are disgustingly evil, the entity would be very pleased !
---
NoEd NeEdS aBuFf.
---
Is that a thing that was probably happening in the last week with the broken matchmaking?  Absolutely.  Is that something every rank 1 survivor does with their friends who are new to the game and can't last more than 10 seconds in a chase?  Absolutely not.
---
The way matchmaking has been since the 3.2 update is bad and it should have been reverted to the way it was before 3.2.  Playing rank 20 killers with a 1 and 3 in my group wasn't fun for anyone.  But playing rank 1 killers with a 17 and 19 in my group won't be fun either.
---
I get that, it’s really frustrating when you can’t have fun due to the skill gap. If you decide to get a refund then that’s too bad, we could always use new players!
---
If you are new and want to learn but can’t in game.. may I suggest watching some tutorials/ tips and tricks videos on YouTube? It’s not like playing to game yourself, but you can learn a lot from watching pros. But anyway I’m sorry if you decide to leave. I hope you give us another chance :3
---
He is a well known figure in the community, people are aware of him (and broken totem spawns), so why did you post his stream clip? Get off the potato pc and post your own video next time so you actually have something to complain about.
---
Yes, the red light in front of them, that is to show which way they are looking. However they can use that against you as well
---
I’d actually be cool with that, I just hate getting these useless things in my bloodweb.
---
Ugh you’re probably right. 
---
I’m fine with 3.2.0 on the switch though. Everyone will be rank 20 so SWF changes can wait a few days. And pig isn’t available so her bug doesn’t matter. Sadness.
---
If it updates now prepare for the game being opened around 3:00 PM
---
Just do bones.
---
Drink bleach you downer
---
Also, when you break a portal, she suddenly knows where you are.  Free awareness.
---
Or they will just leave the game because it‘s unfun to lose every round.
---
Like I said, I don’t like the idea either, I’m just throwing out suggestions. Moris did use to be like that though, you didn’t have to hook someone to kill them.
---
Lolol good job man!
---
Sigh. When I’m at work and not on the way to work to play on the go. Sigh.
---
Old days? Happened yesterday. No there was no offering refund. People talking about "old days" like it doesnt happen anymore lol
---
Thank you for providing literally nothing of value.
---
Even with the average rank it was still incredibly difficult for killers to win since there's a big difference between rank 10 killer and a rank 7 survivor. Add the fact that swf already gives them more of an advantage to the fact that a high rank survivor with low rank killers can just waste all of the killers time unless they decide to explicitly ignore them and it becomes unfair and not fun for the killer. Plenty of other games don't even allow people at higher ranks to play with lower ranked friends to avoid this kind of thing but they also have a bigger playerbase and they don't reset ranks every month
---
Are you okay man? I was agreeing with you....
---
Yeah I read some of the comments in this thread after posting that and realised it didn't matter. I'm happy now :)
---
Everytime I have to kill a Dwight even when they are good i die on the inside
---
Not OP, but the gist of it is this - good survivors know not to cleanse against a Plague, at all. Sure, everybody is broken and can't heal, but if you know how to loop effectively, it doesn't matter. Now if you cleanse, you give her the power to down you from a distance, which means that you will not be able to loop her anymore (or at least not for long). 
---
And if you play Plague and noone cleanses, you are essentialy a normal M1 killer with no power. Sure, they go down in one hit, but if they know what they're doing (and maybe even have Dead Hard), they can still loop you for ages.
---
Ahh yes looping either you get screwed from a hit as a killer or you get screwed from a leap as a survivor I hate loops
---
Yeah how the hell did you get a 4K? Were they nice lol.
---
Because in spite of this being a well known issue nothing is being done about it. So I'm bringing this up to the attention of the devs and community in hope of it getting some more traction since it is obviously annoying to start games with 3 perks as killer. Feel free to keep telling me why I shouldn't though since this seems to personally offend you.
---
I'm surprised OP was able to down anyone as a Tier 1 Myers with a Terror Radius on either Temple of Purgation or Mother's Dwelling. Those Survivors must have made a TON of mistakes.
---
Well folks, after a rough few matches and toxic post-chat, people were kind after explaining that I'm new to the PC version. I bought the base game and a few of the packs, so I spent about $26.78 total. We'll see how it goes! I should have more fun now that I can actually play as the killers I enjoy.
---
Playing killer with sticks? F
---

---

---
Oh I'm blind. I usually do that when the killer is coming my way, I hide and work my way around until they leave. I suck at running away from them though, I try to loop but I always get caught.
---
It won’t even put me into a game rn
---
I have limits...
---
Is the survibir cocky/toxic?
---
Yes? Close the hatch,
---
Is there a bloodpoint in play that gives me a big benefit? Hell yes I'll secure both survivor and the hatch to gain a EGC sacrifice.
---
Otherwise I usually give the hatch or leave it open for them because it feels good to be good sometimes.
---
They used to be like that until the devs realized it was one of the worst ideas they ever had and promptly changed it.  Honestly moris are strong enough as is and very common on bloodwebs the last thing they need is a buff.  I usually see ivory and ebonys generate over Cypress anyways.
---
I play very experimental (and solo!) so i keep tilting from rank 14 to rank 4. But tbh higher the rank, more the dick like they behave.
---
There was this russian claudette once who intentionally denied to heal me whole game. Coincidentally me and her were the two last people who were left on the map and Killer had basically given up. I knew where the hatch was so i went for it and she was camping it, like crouching right on top of it, i got really pissed and waited on the edge of the exit and escaped the very last half second. As hatch takes a full second to open she was entity fodder.
---
Bitch had the gall to threaten me with a report after the game.
---
Ty for the closure 😂
---
I searched the Xbox Game Pass for PC and Dead by Daylight isn't on it. Gears 5 is though and I'm dangerously addicted to it, haha.
---
yeah this game is not new player friendly in the slightest.
---
Not everyone’s friends are the same. I’m sure we’ll get a better system eventually
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d8pndn/i_am_a_killer_main_with_bad_wifi_internet_and/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
The vomit takes a while to apply the broken effect so it doesn't really help you in chase because instead of just hitting the survivor twice, you're puking on them, chasing and waiting for the instant down.  If the survivors remain broken all match it's not too hard to play around the plague by keeping distance as much as possible or forcing her to chase you to safe loops.  
---
Maybe it's also the constant influx of new killers, so less people go out of their way to main and master her?  But from my perspective she suffers from the same problem as the pig, another M1 killer but with extra steps for a unique playstyle.
---
I’m not saying buff Moris, I just want the yellow one to not be completely useless so when I’m forced to get one in a bloodweb it doesn’t feel like wasted points. I’m not trying to buff Moris
---
Being nice to survivors is like tipping extravagantly when you're poor
---
it's a nice thing to do, but you probably need it more than they do
---
Also when I have two teammates DC immediately upon being downed, I should at least safety pip when the killer inevitably sacrifices the two remaining survivors.
---
You shouldnt have gave him a reason to rage quit
---
Thanos perk tOo OP!
---
I'm glad we can potentially have a civil discussion on this, the player who DC'd in question has coulrophobia (fear of clowns) sometimes phobias can cause severe anxiety among other things, although I agree they could have looked away I know that they didn't DC because they were toxic 10 yo's who were afraid of losing or wanted to ruin the game for the Clown player. That's why (in my eyes) it can be seen as a valid excuse to DC as it does phobias do affect peoples mental health. That's what I see anyway DCing other wise is toxic.
---
Saw this from farmer john tbh
---
It’ll take sometime to learn. Best way to learn is watch others do it, learn to watch the killer, and how to loop certain tiles. Also remembering what pallets and vaults exist (still exist) or aren’t blocked off will help. Also watching killer gameplay may help you learn how survivors are doing it. It’s honestly just a process lmao😂😂
---
Actually I think Borrowed should go back. I get sick of being farmed but I run borrowed anyway, Back in the day didn't brrowed affect both Unhooker and Unhookee?
---
Last survivor dies immediately on hook, I’d rather take the bp you aren’t entitled to the hatch
---
What? What swf change
---
I’m on Xbox One, and we played two games post update. In both, the end game collapse killed all survivors in the map long before the bar ran out. Seems like the timer is off???
---
It’s one of those things that’s good as a killer or fucking annoying as a survivor
---
Inner strength
---
They clearly weren't. There was a big window where they could've escaped right then and there but they waited specifically so they could use the key
---
They said "fall"  which ends Dec 20th.. so expect them around Dec 17th
---
Is this sarcasm? Sometimes I can’t tell on this sub
---
Sometimes when I play killer I get on of those hits and I just leave them on the ground and let their teammates pick em up.
---
Yep, this has been effecting a number of people.
---
Because your supposed to watch a mori you fucking idiot. Your not supposed to be marveling at your character fighting the entity’s claws. Quit being a whining bitch whose too lazy to push a button and go do something.
---
Lol
---
The gist of it is this - good survivors know not to cleanse against a Plague, ever. Sure, everybody is broken and can't heal, but if you know how to loop effectively, it doesn't matter. Now if you cleanse, you give her the power to down you from a distance, which means that you will not be able to loop her anymore (or at least not for long). 
---
And if you play Plague and noone cleanses, you are essentialy a normal M1 killer with no power. Sure, they go down in one hit, but if they know what they're doing (and maybe even have Dead Hard), they can still loop you for ages. The Plague is not a bad killer by any means, but there are simply much better choices against high rank survivors.
---
He's deepthroating the ice cream
---
Except he doesn't need to fully charge it to break pallets.
---
Yeah if I get decimated every game I don't enjoy it one bit
---
Plague is rated just fine. She’s usually considered A tier
---
Same bro! Thought it was only me. I think the devs did this on purpose just before bloodhunt goes live!
---
 Lot of killers quit if things don’t go their way dude. Even sometimes without reason. It’s not about reason lmao.
---
Ah. Fair point I guess. Also I didnt think I was being uncivil? But ok lol
---
My point is, from the killers perspective, it doesn't really matter to me WHY a survivors DCs, it's going to be just as annoying. I think if someone knows they have said fear of clowns, they should take steps to prevent themselves from having a panic attack or whatever while ALSO avoiding potentially ruining the game for the other person.
---
I didnt mean to suggest he was intentionally toxic, more so just thoughtless.
---
Hey i used one last night &gt;:c
---
No she hit the hatch closed imediatly so if she tried to jump she wouldent have made it
---
You can get to red ranks on survivor pretty easily just beelining around with SB or BL. It'll take a while if you get a lot of streaks of teammates that don't do gens, but it's not exactly skill-intensive to rank up in dbd.

The whole game is just Ghostface recording everything and when you turn on blurring you fuck up the focus on his camera

Back in the day, when a Survivor got downed bc of bullshit, i used to let them wiggle out. One crazy example was me hitting someone next to a pallet, and 2 sec later the pallet dropped. Creepy almost
---
But those days are over ^ ^ i'm tp salty nowadays
---
Yeah, but it was only a one-time use.
---
The other night I pallete looped a nurse for a 4 gen chase, was feeling really good ( Im rank 11) end game comes. Man... This m.f. rank 18, brah :/
---
Had this happen to me once. I SAFE unhooked 2 teammates, crushed Ruin, &amp; did 2 gens by myself. After I struggled all the way to death, I messaged the killer while spectating to tell them where they both were. One of them got downed right before they got to hatch. Ahh, sweet revenge.
---
All your fancy statistics would freakin mean somthing if a PIP, a victory aka the only thing you can us to say you lost or won, would only take kills into math ! You cant pip as a killer with 50% kills its impossible for MOST players and dont start with high ranks ! 
---
Its not about killing or surviving, the game is about piping! This is the only way to decide if you lost or won ! So again, your statistic dosnt mean shit, also it means even less if you cant provide the sources !
---
Calm Spirit doesn’t make you quieter, it just makes you not scream and also not trigger crows. If you want a stealthy perk take Dance With Me, that’s no scratch marks after vaulting.
---
I dont get the point. Ive never DCed. If im not getting to red ranks then that just means i have to improve somewhere. I dont understand cheating to top ranks because you wont be able to stay there.
---
At least this way cypress has an effect on the game, unlike currently when it does nothing to actually help, save for rare instances. My suggestion is an obvious buff to cypress without touching the others, you’re just being too stubborn to acknowledge it, and I cannot fathom why.
---
It's meant to punish survivors that just throw pallets early and you gain distance and a broken pallet which I think makes the stun fair it doesn't deserve to be lowered

I acknowledged it what are you talking about?  How does a mori that let's you kill someone on their 3rd hook a buff?  It still wouldn't do much of anything. It has nothing to do with being stubborn it's just a bad idea.

Here’s a secret,  Plague’s power revolves around the team coordinations. If everyone cleanse, she’s still weak. She only strong if one person cleanse and everyone else remains sick. Survivors determine how strong Plagues power is. She’s a catch 22 killer, either you give her permanent NOED or give her a deadly laser.

Does anyone know what time DBD is supposed to be released for switch? I downloaded it but I’m still unable to play. So excited for this release since the only way I’ve been playing it has been on my bf’s PlayStation.

#***EARRAPE SONIC THEME***

---
Spirit fury and enduring for extra yikes.
---
And kyf but whatever
---
Three total hooks, not three in the same person.....
---
That’s not really a nerf
---
Ah kk, thanks a bunch!
---
Why tho
---
When he starts charging his Shred he gets Killer Instinct around his active portals.
---
That would be so cool
---
Been a thing since I got here in about 20% of games. Killers shouldn't be hosting.
---
See if getting your rank up actually did something then i might understand. It would still be a dick move but at least id know why they do it.
---
I’m at 16 and got a match with two rank 2s and a rank 3. The rank 12 killer felt the pain as much as I did
---
Damn that is really cool to know, thanks!
---
I keep a trashcan next to my computer 🤢🤮
---
Before the group could consiste of 2 rank 1 and a rank 20 and you would get a rank 10 or 14
---
What do you expect. You were playing Overwatch.
---
I guess depends on if the Exit Gate is powered or not, cuz if it is, why not just open it instead?  He's gotta travel through it and then get his power back before he can come back so you could probably get the gate open in that time
---
Its a nerf to those groups who used low ranks to get low rank killers
---
All three of those perks are insanely powerful. 15% gen speed increase? Generators are already finished too fast, 15% increase on top would be beyond broken. The second one, you have just made a key. It doesn't scale with level like a perk needs to and is just  replacement or an already existing mechanic. It is also completely unpredictable unlike a key which is just unfair to the killer. The last one, you have just made borrowed time, except better in every way. It is borrowed time except they also get free sprint burst and don't need to be in the killer's terror radius to use it.
---
Fair enough, thanks!
---
Eh, but if you really want to just see it any will do
---
yeah that is at least a good thing. oh well, its been great talking to you.
---
Fear can do many things to someone, sometimes people will punch someone out of fear, others will run, scream and do irrational things. The OP probably was the last one and why they didn't look away instead of DCing. But anyways bye sir.
---
So three hooks period then you can mori any person you please?  Again that's not balanced.  With all the things that actually need addressing in this game buffing moris is last on the list.
---
How the hell did you do that?
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
Which is understandable. This matchmaking is basically the one thing preventing me from wanting to come back at this point. I see countless people complain about it all the time lol.
---
One person gets a red ping then goes to yellow but I see their profile and if they are not lying on it they are generally overseas from my location
---
I have a form of neuropathy and repetitive motion aggravates it; I had to set up a keyboard macro for struggling and hope I don't get banned for it (no word from the devs AFAIK on whether it's legal).
---
I guess BHVR wants you to derank
---
I let cowboy hat Jake live.
---
Lightweight is technically a 5th Killer Perk. Usually when you run, you leave a HUGE mess of scratchmarks.
---
Getting rid of the extra ones and making them stay for a little less actually helps Killers tunnel you. I used to run Lightweight all the time but don’t anymore for that reason
---
It takes longer than three seconds to fix my guy, they very clearly know about totem spots being broken.
---
You would have to act really fast. I believe his cooldown is 15 seconds and opening an exit gate is 20. It is possible tho your right
---
I thought 2 iridescent and 2 gold was 2 pips up?
---
Try out that build if you can my dude.  It's a lot of fun and sets you up for a some easy heal procs without having to waste any time to get them.  
---
Can you just imagine how strong it would be with pre nerf mettle of man instead of Bond?  Pure Cancer.
---
The og shreddies but they take 8x longer to eat!
---
You've never had any form of neuropathy, clearly.
---
Good day! 
---
And may the fog bless you in your trials!
---
What is this? Dead by Daylight for mobile!?
---
?
---
Oh I know. Trust me. The doc in that blurb is me last night.
---
She gave u the medkit in exchange for the escape lol, it's surprisingly common. Survivors without items who want to do the same thing will just crouch (like bowing) to the killer. It's pretty funny to me whenever I play Pig, as long as theyre the last survivor left I always let them go.
---
Dude you be arguin with vro
---
3 total hooks, then mori someone who has already been hooked, makes it useful, but still weaker than ivory. That is what I have been saying. clearly you’re barely even reading any of this so I’m not going to waste my time anymore. Later kid, see you in the fog.
---
Ah, yeah, I forgot the charge affects the range. I wonder what the minimum exact timing is then.
---
I mean those still sound like places i would order from.
---
Yeah that’s a fair goal to have. But high rank killers will destroy new/low rank survivors with ease. So it will essentially turn into a 3v1. 
---
Not to mention that having a new player on your team is generally detrimental, since they will have a tougher time with gens and most likely try to be too stealthy or get downed quickly.
---
Ah it changes based on rank. That is for green or purples I believe. In red ranks you need all 4 iri or it's a single pipper you
---
You’re complaining because the survivor didn’t immediately leave? If that’s what you consider toxic and that’s what makes you mad I don’t know how you survive in this community honestly. You could have a positive outlook on something for once and think about how closing the hatch gave the Hag extra points she normally wouldn’t have gotten. But nope, gotta be negative
---
with 7.5k hours XD
---
No I wasn't playing as Jane. I've had a similar bug a few months ago it lasted for weeks before they fixed it/it went away.
---
Zalgo text generator
---
Dwight, dammn this boi, always let him win, expect when he buttdance, dammn this booty i mori him asap.
---
I'd be fine with higher tiers dropping the percentage of healing that needs to be done for it to activate. Or allowing co-op healing to count as a full health state.
---
I’ve gotten to red rank the past two seasons but this one I haven’t gotten there yet so I probably just forgot about it
---
Imagine having a ruin thats lasts more than 20 seconds and still quitting after its cleansed.
---
The average game lasts for 10-15 minutes.
---
That's 600 to 900 seconds.
---
There are 4 survivors in the game.
---
So each game 2400 up to 3600 seconds of shared time ...
---
Honestly, the odds are decently enough that in 1/3 or 1/4 of all games one Survivor dies of heart attack ...
---
Here's a tip: Don't.
---
Seriously, there are things decent human beings don't do. Face camping, tunneling, teabagging, running NOED, running OoO... You have to be a real asshole to do stuff like that. NOED and OoO are both as close to cheating as you can get without *technically* cheating, since they are, for some reason, technically part of the game.
---
Seeing an OoO is one of the very few situations where I'll immediately DC. This doesn't hurt the Survivors much, but it means you won't really get any points, so it wastes your time in addition to any offering you burned. (To be clear, I don't DC specifically to waste their time; I do it because I want to have fun, and playing against toxic quasi-cheaters isn't fun for me.)
---
She already has a mini chainsaw on one of her coametics lol
---
Stats show whatever you want them to... also 9% is significant as fuck
---
Groovy
---
True but it's still a choice to play with a high ranked friend, and as long as they know beforehand that playing with them means going against more skilled of killers I think they'll be more understanding of them losing as fast
---
**LEFT BEHIND REQUIEM**
---
If I'm using Ruin and DH, I'd just as soon go full Hex build with Haunted Ground and either Thrill or Third Seal.
---
I read everything you said.  Just a poorly thought out idea and completely unnecessary one.  Good killers just use them for dailies anyway moris feel like total cheese  whenever I use them they remove all skill from the game.  Basically a killers skeleton key.  I agree though we should be done.  Also not a kid bro but nice touch trying to sound like a dick on the way out.  Enjoy mori'ing your way through your games legend.
---
The funny thing is once upon a time it would have been more valuable than Ruin and BBQ combined.
---
Lmao. That is one angry survivor. Was it a purple tool box? Commodious toolbox? Good add ons?
---
Or was it a brown toolbox? Lol
---
Bill-Bill’s Bizarre Escapes
---
Yeah Dead Hard is the one perk that does neutralize her power as long as you don’t cleanse. She essentially becomes an M1 killer with no power because she has to “hit” you twice still. Other than that one exception though, I feel she doesn’t have a lot of weaknesses in her game.
---
Make no mither have proper iron will
---
Actually allow protection hits to count for stacks of MoM and wglf instead of only counting when unhooking or taking a hit while a survivor is being carried.
---
Pop should work like we'll make it where you have 40,50,60 seconds and can kick however many gens. Maybe lessen the time but have that same effect instead of 1 time use.
---
Surge should be a shorter cooldown and have a larger radius.
---
Noed should only count for those on dead hook
---
Adrenaline should require you to heal others at least once. 
---
Really I think really strong perks should be earned instead of given such as adrenaline, noed.
---
200 iq meme
---
&gt; Better to wait for the good version.
---
What would be even better is if they got them working on time.
---
What your ISP advertises is often not your speed. 
---
Also if you're using WiFi you can have packet loss which drastically affects gameplay but may not show itself when you do a standard speed test
---
i need my second glasses i guess...
---
It also takes more than a few years apparently since this has been an issue since Hex totems existed.
---
I hate this especially when the guy doesn't even try to take a hit for you so it leads to me getting instantly second hooked or killed
---
You are right on the money good sir
---
fuming mixtape should be a cooldown add on that shaves off a full second
---
Awesome, thanks
---
We are spending so much more time trying to sync everyone and making sure we move to the next lobby. And then someone had to restart. Or we get the serve error or any other error that sends us back to the main menu. Now every one has to restart. 
---
Assuming it finally syncs and we move to next lobby, then we gotta wait the 5-30 min window to get to the lobby with the killer... 
---
Usually I play killer if friends aren't online. Sometimes ill just play solo survivor to try and improve. Usually it's SWF with 1 other if I get to and rarely do I get to do SWF 4 player... Especially once everyone starts giving up and switching to another game since we can't seem to play in DbD...
---
Matchmaking has nothing to do with it. I see games where everyone is a red rank and people still DC
---
I’d switch jane’s perk with urban evasion for that extra sneaky get away chance
---
I was waiting to see if I could leave without using the key you moron, if she hit me I could have left through the hatch which is why I waited
---
Are you using drugs?
---
I'm typically solo, too. I mean, might as well if she was being a jerk the entire game. Not really against the rules since she could just like leave out the open door. Ive been from rank 15 to 1 and haven't experienced that before, though it could also be due to location. Most I get are farmers, sandbagers and people who deny points. You let them heal you, then they run off to self-care or they won't let you heal them and self-care.
---
Am i
---
It’s impossible to loop a nurse forever. All it takes is one look down teleport and you do to a cheeky 360
---
Amen
---
No chat on xbox sadly
---
Not at all
---
"Fixed an issue that caused The Hillbilly's camera to jolt in whichever direction input was given when chainsaw sprinting into objects." This is a big one,  for better and for worse depending on your playstyle
---
This is big brain time
---
Yes but if you don't cleanse you deny her the actual strong part of the power.
---
They've honestly ruined performance again on PC. I am using R5 2600 with RX570 8GB OC and my performance on ULTRA is inconsistent as shit now.
---
Yeah they will understand it, for sure. Just it might make them want to stop playing all together, since it’s a shitty experience to get killed so easily when you’re up against someone with way more experience. I have a few friends who just don’t play often and I would hate to force them to play against the red rank killers all the time. I think an average of the survivor ranks makes the most sense.
---
It's good for intel, it's only bad because there are many better perks that benefit yourself and your team
---
Pallets of the Caribbean.
---
It has just recently been buffed so that any gen works for it to activate. Before it only activated when you completed a gen.
---
But the perk itself is indeed a good one for beginners but you grow out of it pretty quickly. You don't really need it. There are far better perks out there.
---
I didnt know that was a thing lol it was kinda nice tho, I got the gesture.
---
She didnt bring the med kit in so at least she didnt really lost anything. I honestly wouldnt mind her taking it with her lol
---
I think he is pretty good but he has the thinnest skin ever, which makes him unwatchable too often... Someone says or does something he doesn't agree with and he harps on about it for the entire stream being grumpy. 
---
Seemed a lot happier in general a few years back. Doubt he even enjoys playing DBD anymore.
---
I’d rather have stable, functioning dedicated servers I would need to wait for that we’re released right the first time than have the entire games servers be an absolute mess, cause a slew of newer problems and make things unplayable because they were rushed to a deadline. 
---
But go off, Karen.
---
Demi reminds me a lot of Billy. Great take down potential at medium range with line of sight, decent ability to travel and pressure the map with portals.  Solid mid-tier Killer.
---
Teabagging, flashlight clicking and things like that aren’t toxic. You just care to much.
---
It's whenever a gen is completed now.
---
It used to be whenever YOU did a gen but that changed last patch.
---
Dark Sense is weaker than Alert - That's probably why people don't like it. You will get more updates on the killers location with Alert.
---
Technician is good if your a newbie but once you learn to never miss skill checks it becomes pretty useless.
---
I always bring Franklin's Demise on rank 1 with the clown. Bully them before they bully you.
---
Nah. Dbd mobile looks better. :D
---
I play console nurse and it’s ridiculously easy
---
Another big thing to learn is that some tiles just aren’t worth it, some loop tiles are pretty much useless, so you’re better off trying to stretch your run to a better tile
---
I want that rework so bad 
---
Fingers crossed they won't mess it up
---
Tru
---
They're all really great except chocolate helicopter as a killer Main I simply  cannot allow that. But what killer would come with big man coach
---
Make the frenzy infinite. The only time it stops is when you make it stop or hit a survivor with the deep wound status effect or miss. It has a cool down of 35 seconds
---
Also rank means almost nothing, at this point it’s a little showing of your skill, but more about showing how much you play. Especially with how MM is rn, it’s pretty much a worthless system.
---
I am a baby killer and I will forever be Rank 20, I still dream of the first time I win a game. I did kill two people once, that's my all time best. And then there was a Clown game where I only saw scratch marks until I lost...
---
That’s a good point tbh
---
Shoot yeah that's what I meant
---
His movement speed isn't really an issue in frenzy, he can normally catch whoever he wants while frenzy is up.
---
The issue is frenzy is only useful if survs heal and a lot of people won't bother because they know you can catch them again.
---
What build are you using for your doc?
---
I usually run BBQ, Ruin, Pop goes the Weasel and Make Your Choice (or franklin's instead if they have 3+ items).  And then for add ons, an electrode for range and discipline for more madness accumulation.
---
Yeah thanks
---
He never moves either, just seems to be really hooked to that spot.
---
I wouldve left so fast no hesitation. It gets you killed she was lucky
---
The killer difficulty system isn't that accurate to begin with. my conclusion is that it is a measure of killer power complexity. 
---
Proof:
---
Ghost face: difficulty hard
---
uses for power: peek on survivors (like the devs intended), use killer instinct as bait, sneak up on survivors, mask your terror radius during chase so the survivor thinks you're Houdini. 
---
Nurse: difficulty hard
---
uses for power: Teleport long distances, juke a survivor in a chase, laugh as a survivor goes for the pallet, TP through and hide behind a closed exit gate with Insidious (yes you can do that).  
---
Billy: Difficulty easy
---
uses for power: be a fast boi
---
Leatherface: Difficulty easy
---
uses for power: be a fast but slightly slower boi than Billy, but can turn and also take out up to 4 survivors.
---
Poor Jeff... i think
---
Hell nah
---
F
---
We need that steve cosmetic
---
Dark sense got recently buffed, it used to only activate when you yourself completed the gen. Now it’s an average perk in my opinion
---
Technichian isn’t worth at all for experienced players because they usually hit the skill checks. Also it’s totally fine to like whatever perks you like even if others don’t
---
I actually don't know if the Demogorgon has a gender.  But I default to using she.
---
HANG on I’m gonna look this up.
---
It was for swf, and also matchmaking and connections are not the same thing. Completely different.
---
Playing w/ a low level survivor is harsh, though. No perks n all.
---
Why?  You don't want that on doc unless you're going for an impossible skillcheck build or using the add ons that increase madness gain from your shock aura.
---
All you're doing is making it easier for them to scream at madness one and then slip away after while you chase someone else.
---
So you’re complaining about survives working together?
---
You're right. I should quit being a lazy, whining bitch and stop asking for basic accessibility options.
---
Hahaha, finally I'm not the only one who saws that guy in the swamps.
---
Ye idk.
---
It's hard because having new killers get looped forever is not ideal but at the same time playing with your new friends at high rank is going to make them hate the game.
---
So realistic options are purposely derank, which seems to be a trend as of this morning or not bother getting friends to play.
---
Saboway and
---
Huntress inos
---
Dont forget your fried chicken!
---
What does that do ?
---
Thanks for going out of your way to knock down my compliment to someone else
---
Waluigi new killer confirmed
---
Initiate 50/50 time. Run to an exit gate and wait for killer to find hatch. 50% chance he checks the wrong door first and you get out. 50% you dc.
---
The thing you just mentioned, mouse and keyboard !
---
You don't scream
---
Techian sound decrease is good for mid ranks too
---
Then use thanatopia and the aura reading add on
---
It's hard but I'm enjoying the game. I'm getting pretty good with trapper
---
so it’s shit when you play against a Myers or ghostface?
---
More gen rush. Gotcha
---
Exactly, it's safe with the loyal DBD fanbase he has, but it can't be fun anymore.
---
I'm playing the matches out and dcing the last millisecond so everyone gets a nice game and doesn't get shafted bloodpoints wise or are down a player for the whole game.
---
Is *all* survivors and killers included or do you need to buy some?
---
Lol Spirit is even fucking easier with not even a quarter of the practice time. She’s so easy for how good she is. Easy 4K if you have a brain. I think base kit Nurse is fine, players like you put hundreds of hours to get good with her, but her addons need a work. Meanwhile Spirit can just stand still and that’s considered a “mindgame.” Absolute bullshit
---
Why don't you actually play a decent survivor? Nancy is fine, Steve is a fagutte
---
You're gonna give yourself an aneurysm if you don't stop being such a negative creep.
---
EDIT: I know the perks are OP y'all, I made this as a joke don't think these perks are balanced in anyway. The best way to form a good perk, is to make them as OP as possible on paper then work from there figuring out how to balance it while keeping it viable. I just want my cheeseburger loving boy in the game
---
If you get an exclusive cosmetic for having it on switch, why not create cross platform progression so it actually matters?
---
On the flip side I’m very excited to try this out
---
Closing the chest gives the killer a notification??
---
And Pig.
---
Look how it auto locks on survivors smh
---
It's not that gens are really quick, it's that gens are the survivors only objective. What else can they do? cleanse some totems? search chests?
---
Of course you’re right, next time I get teabagged, camped, or tunneled I’ll put a smile on my face, thank you for teaching me the error of my ways white knight.
---
Should be live.
---
Yeah
---
If Leatherface isn’t there does that mean BBQ is a base perk like Bill’s on console before they added him?
---
Killer main here, just do gens and while you complete them run around the area for the totem or check usual totem spots around gens before you start working on them, I play lots of solo survivor and thats how I deal with it, usually my teammates find it before I do
---
&gt;Wireless is a shared medium, everything has to take turns. If too many things are attempting to transmit at the same time then the wait times and thus latency goes up. Also more traffic on WiFi means more collisions that require packets to be re transmitted and increase latency even further. Modern Ethernet is switched and doesn't suffer these issues. Each Ethernet line is a dedicated connection to the switch. 
---
So given the correct circumstance you are unintentionally "lag switching"
---
Dude why didn't you just keep on looping the rock? There was literally no point in running around the other rock, and it got you downed.
---
Yep it just makes them more privileged
---
Baby Dweet is just for new players, there for “Baby”
---
You said there was one person on the hook and one person being chased at all times. That leaves 2 people, and one of which, I'm assuming would have to go for an unhook and presumably heal, not guaranteed, or each person hooked got one hooked leading to at least a 2k. But if your chases were quick, as you said, it would lead to either a 4k or jot all gens being done and one person getting the hatch.
---
After 10 minutes of matchmaking?
---
nah it has been fixed with the Trailer drop
---
It's great against doc, and the clown it also counters iron maiden. I use spine chill a lot of the time for Mike and Ghostface. But as I heard spine chill is getting a nerf so I'm trying to live without it.
---
Especially if it's a key.
---
It still happens though, way too often
---
Settings &gt; Account Management &gt; Restore Licenses
---
Usually fixes these digital issues
---
Ruin + Pop Goes the weasel + Sloppy Butcher (+BBQ). It's my build in any killer on high ranks. You NEED to slow the game with perks, which sucks because i would use others if i didn't get gen rushed every match without those perks.

We can't import progress from steam to switch isn't?

Yea ran into this last night. Had a meg that kept running to a group of lockers because she had head on instead of trying to get away from the area and after she dies she messaged telling me to “get good tunnler” I just try and ignore the messages most of the time but that one made me laugh.
---
But I thought all modern consoles could have mouse and keyboard via USB? That's what I understood anyway.

---
Hexy? That guy is a little bitch lol always complaining about something where it’s survivor or killer. But mainly killer
---
Dark sense recently got buffed to make it so you see the killer whenever anyone completes a gen. So those videos are probably from before that buff. It still isn’t an amazing perk compared to other options, but it is a lot better now. The problem with the perk is that it can only activate a maximum of 5 times, and the info it gives you probably isn’t that useful. If someone else completes a gen, there’s a good chance the killer is heading in that direction, so seeing his aura doesn’t give you much more info that you would have already had. Plus as you get better at the game, you start to get a better awareness of the killer and their location. You know the general vicinity of the killer once you see them and where they’re headed. Spine chill is usually just a better perk since it can give you more constant info when it really matters. That being said, it’s still a pretty good perk compared to a lot of other perks and it’s definitely a good one to use while you’re leveling a character
---
Is anyone else randomly getting dc after the update?
---
No Leatherface perks makes me hope it'll be like Bill's former situation where his perks were just baseline for everyone. Otherwise, uh oh for this whole new grind :(
---
The new add on is pretty trash. It should get rid of the global portal sound too
---
Should of cleansed all the totems
---
This happened to me with my Swf last night I was so tilted
---
And be a shitty team mate, sure. That’s on you.
---
That's how it be sometime
---
I went against maybe 5 during my no mither run to rank 1. Red ranks with good addons and good perks and she was still just laughable. I’m already broken? Why are you puking? And also who needs to cleanse when she doesn’t get any easy free hits so as long as you’re aware of your surroundings you can and I have loop her for literally the entire match. Once someone cleanses? Gg. And having everyone cleanse at once sounds good in practice but yeah not really a good idea to let Plague run out of her ranged down and then go to another pool and then another pool and then another pool giving her like a full 4 minutes of ranged hits. 
---
She’s just too easy to counter. M1 killers are mostly jokes against competent players. SWF destroy her. Against ransoms you’re way more likely to win because they’ll cleanse. Red rank survivors shrug off the sickness and just gen squat. Imo she’s a better Legion. Her power is only an inconvenience if you let it be or if she’s running her best addons.
---
It's even worse now somehow
---
Every fucking time fml
---
im implying that since they fixed the matchmaking meaning we r now connected to specific range of killer hosts...the bowl got smaller thus the probability to connect to a killer miles away is highly probable...
---
I'm not saying human in the terms of species, I mean in terms of outward appearance, and design. Jack Torrance is just a crazy looking man who dresses like my dad, and Patrick Bateman is a nice man in a suit (which neither are bad). While Ghost Face has floating strands, a big cloak, and a signature mask, same for legion, masks are a solid design choice for a human killer.
---
What map?
---
thank u for being so nice
---
Oh boy, so it turns out my SWF group has been artificially ranking up because we keep getting paired with level 18-20 killers? We have levels 18, 16, 12 and 5. We're about to get absolutely stomped by level 5 killers
---
Sorry for the quality. I was to lazy to stand up. Just used my zoom

You mean leave as in DC or what?
---
Some survivors get salty if you let someone go.
---
Just work through it, even if you don't hit all the checks you're still making progress. Stake Out is an underrated perk that can help.
---
However, avoiding working on gens with other survivors - missing checks with two people on a gen is more penalising since both your progress is stalled.
---
I was expecting for them to say GG because other than that they played well and the round was fun.
---
Wait until dedicated servers
---
How can SWF be smurfing? -\_- Well yes I kinda enjoyed the easy BP when the devs fucked up the matchmaking..But I sure as hell was not smurfing.
---
Stop! You have violated Chapter 6 of the Survivor Rule Book. Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence. Your stolen bloodpoints are now forfeit.
---
2 people doing gens and one with a green toolbox with addons, she was with a claudette and they were both together doing gens quick af. I swear I'm not here to cry because I lost, idc about pip or anything like that. I just want to be able to play other killers that are not top tier without being absolutelly crushed. They were just optmal af and I couldn't do shit. Maybe the chases took a little longet and a little less, but no more than 30 seconds I guarantee. It was really weird but I didn't have to deal with a single pallet on that game (it was the new map)

Complaining that there was nothi g I could have done because I'm not a billy/nurse/spirit, yes

There are so many ways to cut down a video my man.
---
Runs over 25 FPS but we wont know till tech analysis shows up on youtube.
---
What
---
Not quite. Just a part of the old Legion.
---
The old Legion could easily chase you until your timer ran out or just hit you with the frenzy until you go down.
---
Excluding that part, yes I do want some features of the old Legion back. I feel like they were gutted the moment they released that rework back then.
---
Just playing with my friend will make me derank.
---
First two are op af. Sugar rush is interesting though. Maybe put survivor into broken state if they dont get hit before theyre reinjured
---
Sorry I’m a bit on edge about a girl.
---
We'll just have to wait it out and see.  But we do know with information provided before from the devs that survive with friends groups were being placed in groups that was less than the average survivor skill level and there was manipulation done at a massive scale by survive with friends groups by pairing up with low level ranks.  It was extremely common for rank 1s to play against a rank 20 because there was just 1 or 2 rank 20s in their group. (which were also smurf accounts)  You will see people purposefully derank to do similar behavior, however, that is easier to track and the worst offenders will get banned.  This is on a whole a very good change.  And just going on twitch confirms it for me.  Just yesterday the majority of streamers were playing with low rank survivors (smurfers) to get easy killers and that's not happening today.
---
Is it really that slow ?
---
u heard me buying scoops ahoy hat
---
I was using ruin+surveilance+spirit and enduring. I didn't get to use surveilance because I didn't kick any gens since i was doing chases
---
Hot
---
You're welcome. It's no fun being constantly tunneled, bullied, and mori'd just for who you play as.
---
Was it on PC or ps4? If ps4 then you know that person has a mental illness.
---
Yesterday I looped a killer for 5 gens and got caught after being greedy with a pallet.
---
When I got hooked I obviously got face camped.
---
All 3 got grabbed while trying to get me... He would pick one up and drop them. They didn't even manage to unhook me.
---
This was a lobby with 3x rank 1s SWF, and a rank 2 (me at that time)... vs a rank 12 killer.
---
The best part is that I didn't even safety pip because I only had points for running.

What is this thread
---
Thanks for a quick reply
---
There are going to be games you lose and there is nothing you can do about it simply because there will be survivors who are better than you are at killing. Its not because the gen speed is too fast it's just because you got beat. I dont see you posting on here gens are too slow if you get an easy 4k.
---
i totally agree. theres a lot of people out there who are like “you play scoops Steve” mori’d you know
---
Friends dont eat friends or whatever that one kid said to his pet demogorgon thingy
---
R/dontbeacunt
---
The Claudette was probably crouched in a bush, the Meg throwing down the pallets after doing one loop, and the Nea was probably chasing the killer just to fail their 4th straight flash light save. You got nothing to worry about.
---
Xbox xD. So, huge ego.
---
You can buy a powerline adapter.
---
be gone thot
---
Scoops troop for life
---
If you play better with it why wouldn't you want it? :| I am confuse.
---
lol, I'd definitely do that if I was trying to die fast. I posted what I'm actually doing in another comment.
---
Brother unite
---
Sigh, and here I am only just now realizing that you can earn bloodpoints with one killer and spend them on another...
---
Is it first 3? I thought it was only the first time?
---
Yeah, if the ps4 struggle to run this imagine the switch
---
Any killers or survivors that straight up missing? As in not locked, but actually missing
---
Talking about Polly? Watch out for her she tried to rape me at a lounge act.

I wouldn't be surprised if you said mobile XD

Oh cool
---
This was surreal, the first game I did generators started exploding everywhere and people juked me so badly I thought it was high level mind games. As a brand new player this is MUCH better. I still didn't win, and all that practice against god tier survivors will hopefully make me ramp up a lot faster now. People just ran away and didn't head to pallets after I sped up a lot and I was like ?!?! what is this then finally was like oh I am finally playing dumb survivors.
---
Really?? Why did someone tell me pig wasn’t there?! Well that’s good then Pigs are fun to play against.
---
wasted "resources" imho. People don't want to start from scratch, Switch has no playerbase for games like this i think (Nintendo is more of a family console, which doesn't mean nobody will play it but u get my point here), I can't say how it will run but from time to time i see posts here or on steam that people still have bad fps on PS4/Xbox? How will this run then on switch lol. Also the Phone version same story , First who plays on a phone? Second stable connections? Wish the devs would actually add new stuff to the game instead of "wasting resources" into Phone games and bad console ports.
---
Got home and downloaded the patch. Loaded up the game and it's like someone smeared vasoline over everything
---
Only until you reach a certain rank
---
Maybe it’s different on Console (I play on PS4), but Dwights have a like a 15% higher rate of being BM.  Nea and Laurie are still highest, but I’ve never met a polite Dwight that I can recall.
---
No it's the hook I see it too Everytime I'm on this map
---
A ruin lasting more than three minutes 
---
That's a win in my book tbh
---
Hag? Seriously? Killers with instadowns I get, but... you do know about crouching, right?
---
I disagree. Especially if it’s an unsafe pallet, or in a area without generator. 
---
If I believe breaking the pallet and allowing survivor to take the object might be more detrimental to me than not breaking the pallet, I won’t break it.
---
It is a strategic choice
---
Learn what a "shit post" is
---
Holy shit. This was my only issue with Hillbilly, and i almost quit the game because this jerk. Having better control will make him so much more user-friendly and easily learned.
---
It doesn't *add* Scratchmarks, it just makes it easier to find you in short-range scenarios, like a chase or BBQ-location. Since it makes your Scratchmarks last less time, it makes it easier for Killers to pinpoint where you went in short chases.
---
In long scenarios where you're just sprinting outside their terror radius or you've sprintbursted away it can be helpful, but it really just hurts more than it does good.
---
I liked Nancy on Season 3, yeah a bit rude but she doesn’t take shit from assholes.
---
that's something odd right? It's not just all the hooks right?
---
Wow, you can see every single dropped frame. lmfao
---
I'd quit lol
---
RIP Jeff...
---
Dark sense is good but alert is better. Dark sense can only work for 5 gens Max alert is every pallet and every gen kick
---
Every brit has eaten this. 
---
This hits the feels...
---
Was expecting Dwight to be in the locker but instead I get Jake.
---
Seems like you've got Step 2 down already.
---
It happens on all platforms
---
Me, a rank 1 Legion, got told by a Rank 20 with no perks who I Mori’d “OMG You’re so bad! I escaped before everyone else!”
---
You can go to recent Players and the one that isn't a survivor is the killer
---
I'm trying to find ruin and heal/unhook only but sometimes I still safety pip if killer chases me.
---
I play Siege and Overwatch and yet DBD is easily the most toxic game I play. So fucking sad
---
Same got it around level 3 then Ruin at 6
---
What are you talking about the models look good
---
You could give that girl your heart in a box and all she would do is pump it full of lithium and she will milk it and drain you dry.
---
She's clearly a spitter my dude
---
The fast running is a glitch happens sometimes
---
It’s finger lickin good
---
Imagine rather than having a insta down , it was mori ? I mean the game did end and if they didn’t do all the totems it’ll be s fair trade I think
---
Ummmmm... close hatch?
---
Hope: so it also works when your the last survivor in the trial to help you find hatch.
---
Plus she smells like teen spirit. Better to just stay away than try to breed with that.
---

Hello fellow red ranks
---
F13 has a huge player base on switch, maybe you need to do some research before you post opinions that haven’t been valid for years.
---
Near activated portals, doesn't work if he hasn't used the portal yet.
---
Will they release the Stranger Things DLC on switch?
---
i think just near active ones... that you're also not too far away from?
---
Guess his just HANGING around
---
You should have told 'em "Death is not an escape"
---
because it's just m1 killer against survivors smart enough to not to cleanse
---
I think it’s when he channels the abyss and the survivors are near a portal he has previously used to travel
---
Yeah, smurfs will actually be more popular after this change since it's the only way you can circumvent the new matchmaking after this change if you don't want a low rank you're SWFing with to be matched against high rank killers.
---
Thanks! I’ll send them out asap
---
Only yellow portals, when holding down shred
---
Dunno about especially but I know PC players hate each other XD
---
This also happened against me like lmao meg kept running like a Road Runner 😂
---
Nancy is not that great, IMO. Her model is not immediately recognizable,  where as Steve is. I had to tell my sister that the character  was Nancy, and she still didn't believe em until I showed her the dlc page.
---
Ohhh nice wondered why my friend always got them
---
Pig isn't available? What DLC killers are on Switch? I'm interested in the Switch version to dick around on it but hearing things like this are making me wary.
---
You though Blendette was a pain before? Oh boy get ready for this...
---
ye, I think its 17 or something
---
If only The Left Behind DLC would’ve came out later on. Tapp could be Coach, Jeff could be Francis, Adam could be Louis, and Ace could be Nick

Apex was extremely popular for like a month. Everyone was playing it for a bit, and now I haven't seen a single person on discord play it several months. Here are some [analytics for Apex Legends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=apex%20legends), and some for [Dead By Daylight](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=Dead%20by%20Daylight) to compare. Note they are both normalized to 100 at peak. [Twitch viewership](https://twitchtracker.com/games/511224) is down as well. Apex is falling off hard because it lacks the ability to pull in new players, and retain its current players. I don't have a way to prove that their rank systems has anything to do with this, but I wouldn't call this game a beacon of success. Their system has failed to show long term viability.  
---
The reason for their initial success was the current extreme popularity of the battle royale genre, and an enormous marketing campaign. None of the initial success should be attributed to factors involving high level gameplay mechanisms, since the player base will naturally take a few months to reach the skill level where those things actually matter. After a few months when the meta strategies started to evolve and the ranking system reached equilibrium, the game started to die off.
---
new killer, everyone playing killer so many less games
---
Nope. Pig is available. Everything is available except Leatherface Freddy and Quentin.
---
BROWN TOOL BOX FOR YOU!

But 30+ minutes is absolutely unacceptable

---
Has everyone forgotten about that very short amount of time where killer’s would drop survivors even if you stunned them or blinded them during the animation. You didn’t even have to properly time the stun/blind
---
For your first time against a killer it will tell you tips against facing them, afterward just normal survivor tips
---
From what i’ve seen on the apex sub its a consistent game with good events and frequent patches, steady playerbase, and is also definitely steadily rising. Im not factoring initial popularity, hell ranked wasnt in there initially, but you cant deny that the ranked playerbase is extremely supportive of the system. It definitely isnt dying off man, i’ve seen things that counter the stuff you showed me, but hey, thats the internet
---
I was playing with my dutch friend, so we were talking dutch. But I found the bug funny so decided to share it
---
Are you an old man? You are incredibly out of touch if you think the switch is just a family system
---
Mine has changed 4 times today already 😐 do you get any blood points or is it just changing after the game too?
---
Yep!
---
It’s nice to hear good stories coming from it too. XD
---
This is why I wish both sides had more emotes and taunts so we can all better communicate.
---
Agreed
---
Pc so much smoother all around
---
Oh fuck I was gonna wait to buy the game now I feel like I gotta and grind BBQ on everyone while I can
---
cool stuff always happy to see cosplay
---
1. Just hit who you see and if you dont see anybody, walk away. Or let them go for the save and then hit them or try to grab them off the hooked person and chase them off. Dont worry too much about keeping the person hooked honestly. Maybe someone else can give you better explanation for this though
---
2.  Def level bubba, BBQ has been in the shrine 3 times with more than a year gap between the 1st and 2nd times. Itll reduce your grind time a ton if you just get it out of the way now.
---
3. If they found the hatch, theres not really anything you can do to bait them if they dont care about anything else. All you can do is slug the 3rd person and look for the 4th and hope they go to heal the 3rd instead of hiding. Try to find the hatch ASAP and then just stand there and wait if youre worried, but since you play Billy, just close it and zoom over to the doors as fast as you can. Something that might be useful is to camp the hatch with whispers, as soon as you see the perk light up, close it and you'll know theyre nearby.
---
I try not to worry about getting a 4k, if they find the hatch and are waiting there and I dont know where it is, then too bad for me
---
Ranking in general has always been broken since release, and I don't think there's any way to make it good due to all the factors in every match.
---
I'm disappointed its not leatherface
---
It is pretty awful, and don't think "temporal" AA means it's only a temporary "solution" - "temporal AA" is just the literal name of the technique used.
---
There is a way to disable it, but it involves modifying of game files that I would not advise modifying.
---
Because they thought they played well and deserve points for escaping
---
I figured as much. I usually play on pc but was thinking about getting it on PS4 at my girls house.
---
The hatch closing is very finicky so the hag was smart waiting for the hatch to open 
---
As if she were to hit the nea there's no telling what would happen, so there's no danger really to waiting for her and you probably won't get killed 
---
And as a killer main it is definitely frustrating but it's just that dead by daylight and I would be happy about the points and the fact that I'd killed 3 people
---
Also he was probably waiting for their hatch to open and he can save the key for another game
---
Best I can guess, they don't know how to fix the coding/bug. Before it was setup where it would use an average (as you suggest) so that it was still challenging somewhat for the better players. The last patch added the bug where those groups got rank 18 to 20 killers instead at times. 
---
But that's just a guess.
---
I've played a few games since the patch dropped. Im a rank 15/14 killer and the survivor levels were right on par with mine. I think the biggest deviance I've found was a level 8-- no biggie.
---
Searching for game times are up a little bit, but I'm not playing at peak times either.
---
I haven't ran Dying Light yet but otherwise I'd say the hot fix has done its job.
---
i switched from pc to ps4 and like it more overall. i havent played on pc since i started playing on ps4. it takes some getting used to with the controller but once you get the hang of it it feels more natural. some killers, like you said The Nurse, are harder to play but dont mean impossible. ive come across some wild nurses that tear my ass up
---
I’ve played since white noise and I’ve only ever played ranked. tkers used to be like so much more common, playing the game was a chore because you had to deal with gangs of 20 year olds on their 5th account throwing because they thought it was edgy. There was one who I saw again and again, on my team and the enemies. it literally got to the point where he added me on multiple accounts an I just only played when he couldn’t get in a match with me (even tho he liked me cus I just gave up). at least in dbd the toxicity is just profile comments, it wears on u to be yelled at by toxic tkers game and game again.
---
I only do it if they dont struggle, unfortunately most struggle....hook you go haha
---
Wouldn't that prevent the killer from getting 2 rank points?
---
Different reasons. Usually respect or good will. If I have a team of 3 jerks as survivors and have the chance I will kill them all and let the one who played well, acted altruistically, or just had bad luck in the beginning go. Especially if I’m just playing for fun and goofing around or doing dailys.
---
Wait, that’s illegal
---
I agree. Have fun playing with your friends who are new to the game now that they get paired with high rank killers every game.
---
The absolute worst feeling when playing killer is watching a four man SWF escape through hatch with a key.

---
Looks like its a bug that gives you the "after hit" speed boost permanently.

Achievement hunting is harder, the community is more toxic due to total lack of communication. Outside of this it’s a good game play experience. Some killers are definitely harder to play though. Lookin at Nurse and Huntress &gt;.&gt;

Dear god it's a god damn miracle! The hatch can spawn other places on that map?! :0

Not completely fixed though. Can still happen, it appeared set to me while behind a hook and when I got closer it wasn't.

Not everyone cares for ranks, like me.

So tell your friends to play solo and rank up... It's not really fair that you have the option to do "easy mode" DBD just because your friends are low level.

---
I don't think their resources are being wasted.  They are taking advantage of a niche game on multiple platforms.  Right now, how many asymmetrical games are doing this well?  As a company growing, it would be advantageous for them to provide their product on all available consoles before competition arrives.  I've played this game since 2016 and I've seen the growth of the game.  So, I say no, they are not wasting resources.
---

They should bring it back if you're solo and just disable it if you're in a swf group
---
Has the devs confirmed it's a loss? Does the game recgonise it as loss? As long as the the two questions are a solid 'no' then arguing/discussing this is pointless. Good talk, but we're just going in circles. Thanks, anyway.

No but just eyeball it :p usually pretty easy to notice if it’s consistently going below 25-30
---
Plus if the obsession dies, it’s possible to keep all 8 stacks which is super ultra mega noice.
---
So, either it’s playing on WiFi (doubt it), but frames are god awful on switch.  
---
I have this game on PS4 (original and pro), Xbox and Switch now.  PS4 is very playable, especially with the pro.  No difference on WiFi or wired for me and my setup.  
---
Xbox is awful, very laggy skill checks.
---
Switch: camera spins aren’t smooth.  Big delay with skill checks.  Yikes
---
Omg an R6 meme on r/deadbydaylight XD
---
Most exclusives have a counterpart that is either free or very cheap. Wraith’s is actually one of the most noticeable ones.
---
I only find good servers between 9pm and 3am.
---
I was excited because I genuinely like the meat factory as a map!
---
Demogorgon
---
Thanks for the response. 
---
&gt;I try not to worry about getting a 4k, if they find the hatch and are waiting there and I dont know where it is, then too bad for me.
---
Ha, I guess this is what I've been doing too. Suppose it's not that big a deal and that one survivor gets to have his fun while doing nothing to help his sacrificed peers.
---
Yeah it does dip below 30 :/ need to play more maps to get the feel of it
---
boomer
---
Especially with Hag. Running Franklins and putting a trap right next to the item is so fucking fun.
---
I get so mad when this happens, it’s actually uber annoying
---
It's what happen when auto correct doesn't know what words are.
---
He's the best starting survivor tho. Bond really should be used by every new player
---
"I didn't see Bubba or Fred so they aren't on the system."
---
Nah, its really not worth the time to practice for hundreds of hours just to enjoy a game. Another thing about this update is that it now allows high rank killers to bully swf when they have a couple low rank survivors. It will also encourage people to derank so that their friends dont have to go up against the top 3 killers each game.
---
Being Telekinetic is moving objects remotely, being psychic is communicating/reading minds
---
Psykokinetic isn’t a real word it’s a combination of both.
---
Main reason i will is because i just don't want to 2 pip.
---
I feel like I’m the only Nancy main in her Journalist outfit right now.
---
Noticing a severe lack of the Stranger things characters in general which is a shame as they’re all fantastic
---
*Ayayayaaaaaaaaa intensifies*
---
I'll try to address your concerns in order here.  
---
They have a ton of problems with the rank system. These problems caused by rank reset should be solved by changing the rank reset system to a rank decay system. That way you would only have player who legitimately haven't played in a long time being demoted by several ranks.  
---
Having a weight function would solve the problem where SWF including a couple red rank players dominate low rank killers. Having the red rank players pull the average up a bit more would result in getting a killer who is better equipped to handle them, without throwing a rank 1 killer at a team with only one high ranking survivor.  
---
Having fun is of primary importance in a game. Presumably player have the most fun when they are in games where they can actively participate, and the matches are close. Losing all the time is frustrating for anyone. When creating matches, there should be at least a reasonable chance of success for both sides. It's going to be rough on the newbies either way, because they will always be in a situation where they are facing a higher rank opponent. What they've done here is taken all the burden of that problem, and put the whole thing on the survivors side, where it used to be shared. If the killers had to deal with more than their share of the problem then the balance should have been shift, not moved entirely to the other side.  
---
The idea was that the killers would have a mix of a few stronger opponents and a few weaker opponents. With a proper balance of stronger and weaker opponents there should be some point where balance is achieved.
---
I’m fine with dips as long as it doesn’t go so slow that it effects the timing of stuff
---
As a survivor main who’s last alive and doesn’t struggle. This makes me happy
---
I feel your pain, its the same for me.
---
400 hours = they've had their rank reset multiple times. As of right now, their skill level is similar to yours. Matchmaking is trash, but in this case they're your skill level
---
I’m one of those noobs, what’s the difference between red and purple ranks?
---
Depends on the killer 1. It's because they're nice 2. They want to torture you and close it right in front of you
---
LMAO yes, meanwhile console and PC performance is still NOT fixed. But it's fine to put money and work into s shitty ass port.
---
It doesn’t matter where you are as long as your holding down shred, they as in the survivors need to be within 4 meters of a yellow portal. 
---
But a direct answer you can be anywhere on the map distance doesn’t matter.
---
Spirit is honestly the best killer on PS4.
---
I tough it was an improvement on Window of oportunity! The white aura looks way better than the yelllow one.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d8rd40/havent_been_playing_for_a_few_weeks_it_lags_so/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
If you're cuck enough to own all these consoles plus a PS4 Pro this game might be for you, yikers nigger.
---
Yes and they are also human. They are allowed to make mistakes (clearly the games balance and bugs are proof of that) but take a moment and ask yourself what would you do in this position. 
---
If you had to green light Dedicated Servers and your team told you “hey we still have more bugs, new unintended issues and our PTB testing confirms some problems with latency and hit boxes we didn’t intend”, would you just ship it out like that or apologize for missing a deadline and tell the players you need more time?
---
That's understandable. For me personally, I'd be a little creeped out being chased by a crazy psycho with an axe. Even if he looked like a drunk Jack Nicholson. I'd be more scared of him than Legion or Ghostface cuz I know that they're still just teenage punks(mostly) under those masks. That's just me.
---
Can somebody explain to me what new skull icons under the survivor names means ?
---
Well what else is there to say? You should be on my side as a killer main
---
It's worse then it's ever been, not kidding.
---
You have a fixed group now that stays together, but the game rips your team apart and puts it in lobbies with random people while the rest stays in the group lobby. It's awful. We're trying to play a single game for over an hour now.
---
Try playing it on low settings and with 0 resolution. Its a doozy.
---
Yep, this is going to be a problem.  I usually get to rank 1 if I play enough but I've got some friends who are fairly new to the game, legit yellow rank survivors, maybe green at best, and now if I want to play with them they'll have to play against red rank killers every game.  I know matchmaking was super busted with the 3.2 update but I don't know why they didn't just revert it back to what it was before 3.2.
---
Good to know lol hopefully I’m not too much of a potato on PS4 since I’m used to PC
---
I think if there are any DCs there should be a safety pip automatically
---
I think the "Chocolate Helicopter" one should be 5%/10%/15% increased opening gate time, and the first perk is just ridiculous.
---
Id only play on portable (gonan get the lite) - are the fps really that bad? I play now on Ps4 which isnt great on its own - do you know if its comparable? Thanks!
---
The people who dislike this change because "It means I can't play with my lower ranked newbie friends" are the same type of people who would claim to buy a Playboy for the articles.
---
Or like a friend of mine who'se inputs apparently get dropped sometimes, so she'll spam space and then just die
---
Any review links? How does it play? Any worse than xbox?
---
Self care only increases med-kit efficiency on the self heal action, i.e. its useless with no mither.
---
"Thanks to the DR and my build with WGLF, Deliverance, BT, and Spine Chill, I'm gonna get some mad bp in this game.... Oh hi Billy"
---
Why would I be on your side? 
---
Not all killer mains are toxic cry babies that don't understand that things happen and you have no power over it
---
I do vew a red key like a survivor mains vew a red mori 
---
But I'm mature enough to know that it's a game and these things will happen 
---
If OP Said "baby killer gets outplayed" and tbaged when he was on the hatch but no he just stayed there and waited for the hatch to save his key
---
Nice
---
Nerfogorgon
---
Spirit is a fun play on ps4.
---
If I meet a Scoops Steve that isn't a sandbagging cunt, maybe I'll stop eating them.
---
Mmmm. Mountain man.
---
Does the increased terror radius of M&amp;A in a chase influence how far infectious fright goes off? that sounds pretty strong
---
I have let someone escape or get hatch before when they played super well or as a good team mate, gave me a real run for my money, or had to deal with teammates who farmed them or whatever. If I killed everyone else I will probably pip so 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Your a good man, thank you.
---
it's in shrine of secrets right now
---
Lets say that for some coding reason, they cannot make an average rank of the group to use when trying to find a killer.
---
Senario A: Use the LOWEST survivor rank of the group means a lot of people will abuse it to bully low ranked killers while they are actually red rank survivors by pairing with a low lever rando or using a smurf account to bring all their friends.
---
Scenario B: Use the HIGHEST survivor rank of the group means a lot of people will avoid grouping with their high rank friends so they dont get a killer too skilled for them.
---
If you got only these 2 choices I can say that B seems a lot less exploitable than A.
---
Hes not even that strong.
---
It also spawns on the street near the houses
---
I would love the red jacket she wears! Honestly, give me all of them and I'll gladly splurge to buy them all. Especially the outfit Babysitter's icon is based on. 
---
I really hope their contract allows them to make cosmetics T_T
---
No sorry bro, I am very tired and tbh, I don’t really play dbd anymore (just when I am bored)
---
That's happens to me almost every other match. At least my WGLF stacks makes sure it wasn't a complete waste of time
---
“So no trap?”
---
Ive never heard of that problem. It must be new and the devs dont even know about it since its not in the patch notes. Are you sure you guys were in a group and didnt start searching seperately by accident?
---
Dart, the name of the friendly demodog from season 2
---
Yep, it’s a great movie, highly recommend. One of my favorite lines is “SIT YO FIVE DOLLA ASS DOWN BEFORE I MAKE CHANGE!”
---
Just played a few games handheld no problems so far frames were stable at 30
---
Yeah, it's been good for me as a newbie though. I like playing against the really good survivors once in awhile so that I can learn. It's really satisfying finally landing a Billy curve or moonwalk and taking them to the basement after chasing them for the entire game having them teabag and whatnot. If they've been taunting I usually do hook camp just to get the salt going.
---
Rip :(
---
I had a clown yesterday that facecamped everyone and had noed. Three escaped and 1 died. When I asked why play like that he said we had pallet vacuums and survivors were op... uhm.. we haven’t had pallet vacuums in a long time buddy.
---
I think it was the leaked dev version
---
It's kinda tricky. It wouldn't be fair for the killers to escape that easily.
---
This is actually one of the reasons I stopped playing survivor. I just couldn't stand doing this much effort.
---
Don't remind me that goblin exists
---
You could go afk for like 10 games then you’ll face nothing but noobs yourself after de-ranking. The only reason to rank up on this game is to add more challenge.
---
Haven’t played offdock but I’m having a load of fun docked everything seems to be smooth and nothing unbearable
---
Mr. Gordon
---
PogU
---
Yes. Il just pop out or other survivors pop out at very wier times making me think they didnt DC.
---
Flower face
---
Its not toxic to use the mechanics of the game to win.
---
I don't think the hardcore minority are what's going to keep the game alive. Since it's not a monthly charge probably make their money on keeping numbers up
---
Personally, I'll give the hatch to someone if multiple of their teammates suicide or d/c on hook as I know how unfun that situation is on the receiving end.
---
Every Myers I’ve ever had in the red ranks has gotten gen rushed with these addons. At most 1 or 2 gens maybe. Never more.
---
I feel like Pig should get her traps reworked rather than her lunge. Deomogorgonfy her lunge and now shes just a worse demogorgon. Buff her traps so she will get her own identity.
---
I really wish there was a cross-save -- don't really feel like rebuying all the DLC and cosmetics after rebuying the game
---
Virgin Survivor: DH, DS, Adrenaline, BT
---
Chad Survivor: This guy
---
Compare tutorial to actual game play, it's noticeable.
---
It's still fun though everyone with 1-2 perks, no coordinated swf BS, like back in the day.
---
1.9.2, never forget. Vacuum existed for 2 years while that was just one tiny patch thank god
---
They gave the killer 2k points for closing the hatch, so it’s actually a courtesy :)
---
Iron Will. I'd run it on everyone if I could get it past tier 1...
---
It's the most goofy profile pic I have seen on Reddit. I was crying so much when I saw that. Thank you and everyone else for using it.
---
Player prestige rank after reaching level 100.
---
One thing is to use the mechanics of the game and another one is abusing them.I understand that if killers camp,tunnel and use ebony moris survivors can use instaheals and Adrenaline.But if all 4 survivors abuse them and then I have to watch them teabagging at the exit gates and saying "gg ez baby killer" in the chat for three games in a row, that's toxic.
---
&gt; The idea was that the killers would have a mix of a few stronger opponents and a few weaker opponents.
---
Problem is - with genuine rank 20 mixed with rank 1 killer will face few way stronger opponents and way weaker opponents. Neither of those sounds like fun kind of opponents to me.
---
Hilarious vid
---
Well the teabaggingg at the gate and the messages are toxic. Being beaten by perks and flashlights isnt.
---
Here we go, a solution to the problem. Bravo my friend, bravo. And have an upvote
---
Yes never cleanse because the meta is TOTALLY No Mither + Resilience + This is Not Happening, nobody needs Adrenaline and NOED is so "fair and balanced" the killer basically gets to have it the entire match + noisy stinky survivors. /s
---
I cleanse vs Plague but I try to be smart about it. Don't work on a gen, infect it, cleanse, and go work on the stinky gen to reinfect yourself. If a survivor is hooked and broken, don't cleanse before rescuing and reinfect yourself. 
---
I play Plague semi-often and I actually prefer non-cleansers as I find corrupt purge hard to land hits on, and even survivors with Iron Will make noisy puking when broken. I also run thanatophobia and while it's not THAT strong, having entire gens completed start to finish with everyone broken (so max thanato stacks) is noticeably slower and adds up when multiple gens have to be completed like this.
---
IMHO not cleansing is a valid strategy but has higher risk attached as I only need to whack you once to down you + you are noisy. I have a hearing impairment and I can easily hear people coughing in lockers. Iron Will doesn't stop the puking noises. The stink clouds from vaults and gens mean I can tell where you've been.
---
Cleansing also has risks if the plague's good at landing corrupt purge but I have had times where i was looped around the shack for the entire duration of corrupt purge. It's hard because your puke has trajectory from your character moving, making it hard to land hits with at close range. It's more of a "Out in the open" attack. 
---
Also remember if you pallet stun the plague she loses corrupt purge meaning she'll often play very carefully around pallets. 
---
You can also cleanse and simply go immersed once she gets corrupt purge and wait it out. Often when I grab corrupt purge I am not engaged in a chase and have to find someone and smarter players will go hide. (Which is harder if you're broken because you refused to cleanse.)
---
Either EVERYONE cleanses or nobody cleanses. If 3 people don't cleanse and one guy cleanses the other 3 can get fucked over when I have corrupt purge and only need to hit them once. 
---
There's also the dreaded apple addons which give me a free corrupt purge, and when combined with Black Incense (Fully broken survivors reveal their aura) leads to a bad time for survivors as I can break everyone, grab the free corrupt purge, and then see where everyone is and rapidly down them.
---
TL;DR Plague Semi-Main argues not cleansing isn't always the best strategy. It's a valid strategy but this Plague Semi-Main actually prefers non-cleansers since they're easier to track and down.
---
How long was your wait time between games for survivors?
---
Yeah,but I don't want to face baby Dwights.I want a challenge, but a FAIR challenge not some rank reset SWF that is toxic.
---
But how hard can it be to create a code that merges 4 numbers?
---
Yes, had that with 2 completely different groups. Can upload a video later.
---
Alrighty. Never seen a guitar pick this slim tbh.
---
I have all the achievements in the game now except the latest 'Denied' (its half way done) and i know its seggragation but some regions are severely filled with cancerous players, given my location, Thai and Russian players are hardest to reason/sporty. And that is two whole countries.
---
Agreed. I just tend to think anyone who isn't Nurse-Spirit level (who in my opinion, are high-tier) to be strictly mid tier. 
---
Freddy feels stronger than Demi imo, especially with dream pallets. The mind games are just crazy.
---
I didn't know that. Good to know.
---
i Prefer that if the ranks are 5-10-15-20 the killer is rank 10 rather than 20 or 5 yeah.
---
What does the title of the video say dude
---
“ you gonna let me in?”
---
“How bout you let me in?”
---
Because "bullying" was and still is so prevalent and it was easier to do to newer players, thus making their experience shit.
---
OP isnt on console, pal
---
I don't get it : &lt;
---
I always felt that they’re just good at the game. They don’t T-bag or anything like that. (_my experience of course_)
---
4 hours and only 70 upvotes for this gem, damn.
---
As i mentioned above Bond would do you no good if your teammates are a-holes. Inner Strength is OP as you heal almost as fast as normal heal and you also take down one of killer's assets.
---
His perks are all really good except dying light ita just ok. 
---
Rancor is just a rich mans bitter murmur. Because it shows you where people are after each gen but aldo allows u to one hit obsession at the end and kill them.
---
Dont let anyone tell u Save the best for last isnt good, its a great perk and play with your food is great on some killers like wraith and bubba. 
---
For michael i prefer the dead rabbit which decreases TR in tier 2 and increases in tier 3 and I also like the addons that make the rate at which you fill evil within while stalking a survivor.
---
Stop complaining about moris since you are the problem to begin with, YOU , ON YOUR OWN VOLITION, DONT WANT TO GIVE US THE DAMN FUCKING ICE CREAM!
---
Oh it knows what words are, do you mean grammar and punctuation?
---
480p 15 frames
---
And much more important than introducing new content or fine tuning it
---
Every developer should be working on it as a priority
---
Green one should be Meg or Nea tbh. They both look terrible.
---
With the hit and the blood,sweat and pee on the floor &amp; shoes , you lost all kind of friction and kept your additional speed constant.
---
Or secound guess: It's a speed bug.
---
y?
---
I have no problems with this. It's will only 2 or 3 min to find a match
---
Yeah dude but you basically killed yourself. I don't understand your thought process, oh myers is right behind me so I'll run away from the pallet instead of looping it and get myself hooked. It isn't a case of being good at looping, it's about using your brain. There was no reason to go down in this situation. I know not everyone is great at the start, but don't run from pallets when you're injured and the killer is directly behind you.
---
I'll only give hatch if I feel like you deserve it but were cheated, like if someone escapes me all game and the rest all die immediately. If everyone  is bad or I get a team of loop gods, you all dieing.
---
I mean, if I wasnt talking about just the DLC, probably would be
---
*All visibly died* “Gg EaSy BaBy KiLlEr”
---
Survivor almost instant killer about 5mins so the usual I guess
---
I wonder if it would be possible to replace the sound file for the heartbeat and do something like this lol. Although I think the anti cheat wouldn’t like that. But I have no clue so someone should try this.
---
Imagine getting your shit pushed in so hard that you don’t even reach 10k points yet you still post ggez, he has to be memeing wtf.

You can bait dead hard. Walk up really close behind them and don't swing/lunge right away and it becomes a lose/lose situation where they either dead hard early and waste it, or you reach point blank range and can do a normal M1 with no time for them to react.
---
I havnt even tried it with max fog yet so Oof
---
This is too accurate
---
dont forget the instablinds or the places survivor could deadhard to so they can hold the game hostage like the little shits they are.
---
They can.
---
Beat me to it
---
As in on Michaels webs, it won’t appear damn it
---
I understand what you mean,and I don't care if survivors use adrenaline or I get stunned by DS.The problem is that if I use my game mechanics (NOED,Ebony mori,add-ons)without camping or tunneling,I'm using "unfair advantages" I'm a "baby killer that I only wins because of NOED" and I feel bad because sometimes when I bring the mori I actually use it against people that don't deserve to be moried.
---
Still,I kinda agree with you.Maybe I just have to improve at the game to beat them.
---
The thought came to me while I was doing dishes. Before the video I did this for like 5 minutes lol.
---
nice!
---
The only tip I have for playing against SWF is to play Nurse. Yes, she takes a long time to master but she is a rewarding killer. Take BBQ, Franklins, Knock Out, and Ruin. Just slug them all and let them drop their items. Looping is non-existent with her.
---
Instaheals aren’t really effective because you can easily hit them again. Many SWF misjudge the distance between themselves and the nurse (after a blink) which will cause them to nervously Dead Hard. I dont get to the end game often so Adrenaline is kinda useless. 
---
 
---
Take the pocket watch addon and the addon that gives you one extra blink (with no side effects). Its the only two I use and it will immensely help you.

Yeah you deserve it. Wasting the killers time for no reason is a dick move. Karma bit you real hard in the ass.

Imagine walking like a complete CHAD and DOMINATING those PATHETIC survivors with your MUSCULAR arms. Imagine floating harmlessly towards them and needing to teleport because you're too much of a wimp to face the survivors yourself.

Nope. I made sure to not have anything open.
---
I even went as far are reinstalling my OS in an attempt to fix this. No result however.
---
I have a really weird mental tick with certain words/ names where I just replace one letter and suddenly the name because absolutely hilarious/cute to me. I do it with a lot of words but I've taken to calling Demogorgon, Demogorbon for whatever reason.
---
is cute

What Meg did is bannable
---
Permission denied!
---
(I'd much rather have a "push to give up" button)
---
If she were smart she would’ve grabbed her when she opened it so it is a baby
---
That’s so odd! It could be a bug. The hot fix did just come out.
---
The frames are god awful.  Worse than Xbox
---
is this a buff for survivors or killers?
---
Just bad survivors and killers.
---
Demigoogly is my favorite so fart.   Thank you, Morf\_UK
---
Is bbq a base perk without bubba?
---
Oh, sorry for showing my Boner ^^''
---
I guess I'm a weenie and run ruin
---
Sadly no. :(
---
This is as real as it gets.
---
Got kind of the same issue. I join a lobby load the game and then i go back to the main screen with the message : "you need a network connection to play."
---
&gt;Best Perk Combos:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;BBQC, Spirit Fury, Enduring and Hex: Ruin  
---
&gt;BBQC, STBFL, MYC and Hex: Ruin
---
Daring today, aren't we?
---
It is quite odd. I used to get a constant 60 FPS with my settings maxed out but now I barely manage to get a weak 35-ish FPS with all of my settings turned down as much as possibile.
---
Had a game where I found the hatch (was close to the gate where I was) but couldn't exit out the gate due to this bug. The other survivor took too long getting out and I died on the hatch waiting for it to open..
---
Very quick. Not much waiting.
---
That's what I thought too but they kept on saying more of the same. :(
---
This is more a bandaid fix than anything, but... Have you tried running the game in windowed mode?
---
It doesn't permanently stop this from happening, but maybe it'll run smoothly. I had a similar problem with DBD up until a patch or two ago and running in windowed fixed my problem.
---
My game would, while in fullscreen, drop to something like 15fps. Every time I alt-tabbed, the game would run perfectly fine. I tried everything I could think of from graphical settings to checking background programs. Still, nothing.
---
The only temporary fix I found for myself was playing the game in windowed mode. Restarting the game didn't appear to help, though restarting my computer did. I'd assumed it was an issue with my computer, so I kept tabs on what was in the background. Finding nothing abnormal, I decided to stick with windowed. Each session, I would flip back to fullscreen to see if the problem persisted... because *sometimes* it was alright.
---
Well, I had my fair share of red rank survivors playing with their low rank friends in order to get a lower rank killer. And I'm sure that I'm not the only one.
---
Not sure. Im sure it would be since they did it with Bill
---
I was waiting Mario as exclusive killer,who could jump on survivors stomping them and screaming "it's me,Mario".
---
If we talk about perks, Steve should be the last one
---
All the dlc looks good though.
---
This happens on console all the time...
---
no quentin too
---
Truth be told. I still don't. 🙆‍♂️
---
Understandable
---
Is your internet connection good right now? That’s like the only other thing I could possibly think of. But an internet connection shouldn’t effect you like that, I think
---
They gang up on you at every hook and bitch when you don't want to leave without looking around a bunch because they all were in your face 3 seconds ago and you know gen's aren't being done yet because one will be healing while another baits you from the hook so the last can unhook. God forbid you catch on and bait the last person into coming out at the hook.  
---
That salt is like Himalayan sea salt to me.
---
I'll try runing windowed next time I'm gonna play the game. Restarting my PC will definetly not help considering I even went as far as reinstalling my OS to fix it
---
I can confirm that all of Freddy's and Bubba's perks appear in the bloodweb for everyone. Sweet
---
WHAT BHVR INTERACTIVE NEEDS TO DO IS ACTUALLY HIRE A TEAM OF CODERS WHO KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY ARE DOING AMD FIRE THE REST WHO KEEP FUCKING UP THE GAME! 
---
It’s 2019 and there are far better games out there with allot more shit going on in them with more people connected than this steaming pile of shit, it’s a management issue and they seriously need to get their shit together and start fixing the issues. I’m not spending anymore money on this game until they actually start rolling patches out that fix the game instead of breaking it more! Dedicated Servers probably won’t be till the start of next year at the rate we are going with this bs company...
---
Just wait till she finds a nurse that takes you to the hatch, closes it, then Moris you
---
Buff to killers
---
who is iron will for?
---
It's a nerf for the whole game, BHVR double downed are crappy matchmaking because they tired to fix it and failed miserable so they're throwing in the towel
---
My connection is definetly not the problem here since it's pretty strong and stable.
---
nioce
---
ah shit, you broke me out of stealth now I have to wait for it to regenerate
---
If she hit me the cool down between attacks would have left enough time to go through hatch
---
Seconded. I will neither confirm nor deny that I have a rapid-fire keybind for this that I just hold because the timing is SO DANG UNFORGIVING. Not everyone has an option to do this.
---
I lost my purple flashlight because of the killer disconnecting, I have a good internet but every time the killer DC’s if I’m doing anything that isn’t standing still I get counted as a DC and not a person who “escaped”
---
looks cute.
---
If the survivior is "the unhooker", then the killer is..?
---
it's sad how many people disconnect against legion I just wanna play my favourite killer normally
---
Damn now I might buy it
---
It's not an issue at all, unless you have noodle fingers
---
People are rude everywhere. It's just easier to be salty when there's a keyboard and a chat box right in front of you.
---
But...but...The Undertaker
---
Jokes on you I let all Kate and quentin players live.
---
The evil dead vs Ash
---
A Filthy Legion Main, duh.
---
There’s no way to avoid it friend, everyone has to face toxics at some point, best thing you could do is play both sides, study how survivors work and what they do during a game, switch when you get frustrated so you don’t burn out on repeat bad games.
---
ah ok. I misunderstood
---
Have they explained why they haven’t allowed custom graphical settings? I’m getting screen tears on medium but everything holds up okay.
---
Crotus prenn asylum
---
I definitely think it was the first guess
---
Yeah, when's the last time you updated the gpu. Usually when the gpu needs an update it cause the game to lag.
---
I'm your huckleberry.
---
I'd agree, but have you seen how often people CAN'T leave because of the game glitching?
---
Is anybody not receiving XP? I’ve played two rounds and nothing.
---
Duh.
---
I’m a rank 12 Killer and I just got matched with a rank 13, 7, 6, and 6.
---
I got stomped pretty hard that game
---
Or the guy from see no evil who was played by kane
---
Worse
---
Yeah those are all totally viable. I’d be super interested to see how they would handle it!
---
I play on LOW with 0% resolution and the graphics looked good until today.  
---
Now the game looks blurry as fuck and lags, if I try to increase the resolution I start lagging even more  
---
It's unplayable for me after the update..
---
With a motorcyle
---
That's actually a good idea.Thanks :D
---
YES! This is almost verbatim what I tell my friends when introducing them to the game. Especially the camping bit. Best way to punish a camping killer is to just do gens. Thank you for verbalizing this!
---
Still a bit better, at least for daily completion, but not very helpful since they’re dead when getting hooked
---
That was today. Still didn't have no effect on my issue unfortunately
---
Oh yeah. Need this one for sure!
---
\*gets puked on by the Plague\*
---
Other survivors: Ewww argh oof
---
Coach: BOOMER BILE HERE
---
Remember me icon looks like shit lol. It's dumb.
---
Yes it does! We were screaming across the map lol
---
Candyman maybe?
---
This meme is 10/10
---
Performance on Xbox on the new map is horrendous. I’m on an X and it felt like it was getting worse as the game went on
---
I was levelling up hag for teachables and I got bbq on 2nd, the lowest I ever got
---
I was a rank 20 with 1 rank 2 teammate and 2 rank 1 teammates
---
I'm rank 5, my wife is rank 13 and we're both very relieved to be matched toward my rank: theplayers - both survivors and killer - are better and the games tend to be more fun: less facecamping, more smart teamwork, etc
---
I agree, this is mainly meant as a joke, or for a few toxic survivors I know
---
The model is alright,not very similar to the real actress true. But voice,is the exact opposite.I am suprised that the voice from Demigorgon is more normal than Steve.
---
Calm spirit only stops the scream. The "location is revealed for 3 seconds" means that the survivors aura is also revealed for 3 seconds
---
Bubba is what peak performance looks like.
---
Clever
---
Behind the ambulance right?
---
I’ve never understood getting mad at someone for playing the game. There’s no right or wrong way to play. After I saw the term “gen rushing” I stopped taking pretty much anything said by half this toxic community seriously.
---
I really hope they work on improving visuals and frame rate. The game isn’t that bad to start with in terms of performance on switch!
---
Kinda looks similar to this art https://i.redd.it/gl3um1071jn31.jpg
---
I could of escaped from the other door lol He made the right call
---
If you're going for a 4K, you only have something like 15 seconds per chase. If you can't down someone in that time, you're wasting time chasing them, at least from a strategic perspective. You're better off pressuring the other survivors.
---
I handle toxic loopers exactly the opposite from you: I ignore them. Boy, does that piss 'em off. They run around clicking their flashlights at me, desperately trying to get me to chase them, doing nothing productive while I hunt down their teammates. Survivors rely on teamwork. No matter how good you are at looping, when you're the last one left, as long as I get to the hatch first, you're gonna die.
---
If you let them loop you the whole game while their teammates do gens, you're giving them what they want. And when you face camp them in the end, you're just showing them they got under your skin. A lot of these kinds of players thrive on that. So you may feel satisfied, but you're basically playing right into their hands and letting them win.
---
Oh god he would probably play just like Roadhog from Overwatch with that giant ass hook
---
Hippity hippity, the hatch is now my property
---
This sounds like an amazing and fair change tbh, no more rank 1/1/2/18 swf groups against rank 12 killers :&gt;
---
Dying light and Destiny came out before and are huge games and still run 10000% better. The difference is competent developers
---
New killer: John Cena
---
Power: You can't see me.
---
You can't see him.... ever
---
Is that Jeff's ass
---
It's not that bad. I was expecting worse from DBD
---
I'm not eve kidding when I say I think he is the most SWOLE killer
---
Thats what i do, find bones as early as possible and get it activated. After that i keep tabs on their locations as i find them and do another after i have to use the perk.
---
Depends on what you're tipping with. Rank doesn't matter to me, and as a killer I'm swimming with BP so it only makes sense to give the last poor fuck the 5k escape otherwise he's going to get next to 0 in that category. I've had many games where my BP was on par with that of all four survivors combined, so it feels to me more like tipping while being extremely wealthy.
---
It’s not misinformation. The game comes with 9 killers and survivors with purchase of base game. There are others available for purchase. They are referring to the killers and survivors that COME with the purchase of the game at no additional charge. For instance you don’t have to buy Spirit or Clown extra.
---
Stranger things is there?
---
The sound of people disconnecting, hatch, the salt bottle agitated in preparation for the end game chat.
---
why isn't she immersing herself into a bush
---
It can't be wrong if it's so right!
---
This is so cute! Love the Dwight peeking out
---
I thought about making The Undertaker, or a Brothers of Destruction one, but I feel like between the two, Kane would fit a bit better. Although I wouldn't argue with both being added!
---
Its not the survivors aura or else it would state it that way. It's the location of the locker via noise notice.
---
Jake
---
Play against Bubba with 3 stacks on Play with your food, then we’ll talk.
---
I love this I really love the look on Dwight's and Meg's face they look so confused keep up the good work!
---
My fiancé is R1, I’m R7, my best friend is R16 and his best friend is R10. We just want to play together because we are mates for FUN; I don’t see the fun in versing red ranks when 3/4 don’t have the ability. 
---
Yes, the rest could ‘get good’ but the game is a casual hobby for most players.
---
I agree with that, Im not lazy, but the struggle fucks everyone's controllers buttons.
---
His mori is him gouging out your eyes
---
I agree, Kane would be the better fit he was in a horror movie or two if I remember right, I just personally love the undertaker
---
Let him play solo and give him directions while he's playing (if you guys are in the same room)
---
Because it runs like shit on every platform, even PC, and all gameplay footage (from this and the trailer from E3) look like it's running in the low to mid 20s lmao.
---
Hol up, IS THIS MAN RUNNING RED INSTA HEAL AND PURPLE INSTA HEAL?
---
Yes. My first game as clown was in Hawkins lol
---
And three haling perks with no mither
---
Rank 16. So I guess newbie problems.
---
I think the wording is strange because they can say something about the dlc.
---
This is very well written and full of such great advice!
---
Oh my bad
---
Why does that make sense?
---
Trust me, it's not intentional. I just really really really suck at finding the door
---
That is great, so its 9 killers and 10 survivors in the base game + all DLCs except freddy and bubba. 60$ for 9 killers and 10 survivors seems fair to me considering normal prices on the switch.
---
Or use trapper and put a trap in front of a locker you think someones in
---
**Baby Dwights are too precious to even hook**
---
Official Instructions is beastly. Strong ass perk.
---
Chocolate Helicopter is also super strong, but situational. It also brings in a cool counterplay situation. "Should I actually search for the hatch? Cuz Coach might be camping a door waiting for me to find it. Or maybe he doesn't have the perk and I need to find the hatch anyway?"
---
Sugar Rush is very similar to Borrowed Time, and I feel would be worse than Borrowed (which is fine, you can't have every survivor perk being broken)
---
The dream world would probably be a nightmare for the frame rate
---
It doesn't know that the word "without" is so apparently not.
---
Shit, guess I'll skip it then
---
they honestly should add an unranked mode.
---
like yeah they have custom but custom is meant to be played with 5 players. they should have an unranked mode where its unranked against a random killer.
---
I cant figure out if we have similar minds or he saw me before in a previous game haha :)
---
All the puns here are cancer I mean they don’t even have a hook to pull interest they sorta just leave you hangin
---
Maybe shoulda said that
---
Demo
---
*heh*
---
Is that the real issue? Why would they remove the map then?
---
This hotfix is perfect for me as a Demogorgon main. That the pallet ability was only an add-on was really annoying, but good that it is included with his normal power now. Now spirit fury and risky shreds are much better
---
No problem, I run distortion quite a bit. This is how I know my aura isn't revealed with IM. Sucks that generators aura is still revealed with discordinance tho.
---
$40 for the base game
---
Right, I meant in general performance/kills, because the game is a little biased in favor of survivors winning. But I'm only like a rank 15-16 killer and red rank survivors can toy with me and guarantee I never get a kill without camping a hook (and I had a recent game where I think even that might not have guaranteed me a kill even if I'd done it - but I don't because it's not fun to do).
---
I'm with you there! The "Devil's Favorite Demon" would be an excellent fit in DBD. He did star in both See No Evil movies which are pretty good compared to most other WWE films.
---
Epic 20fps
---
I play on xbox and don't know what you're talking about. That being said, I do have a One X, but the game runs perfectly fine.
---
r/InstantKarma
---
I ‘camp’ when I watch the survivor die on their 3rd hook according to rank 13 survivors.
---
Spirit's power only makes it so you can't *see* survivors (and their blood trails unless you have the addon). It doesn't affect any audio in the game. Sometimes the whooooshing sound makes it hard to hear things like the hatch, but you still should be able to hear it just fine. Hell, she's probably one of the best killers at finding hatch because her mobility is so good.
---
well i reported her myself and told everyone else in the lobby to report her, but we all had a good laugh in the end.
---
I’m going to just put this out there: if you fire your entire coding team and hire an all new coding team, that new team has never worked with your specific code type before. It would take them months to learn the basics of how your code is set together and much more to make any adjustments without discovering any other unintended side effects. You’d be wasting more time and more money to bring a new team up to speed just to get them to be level the current codes operate now. 
---
Please never be a game development lead.
---
Try hag.
---
Nice try devs
---
You're arguing at something that Behavior's the owner of. Their code is literally an Italian restaurant with how much spaghetti they're using in their code.
---
Besides. They've yet to add things like RANK REWARDS and it has only been like.. 3 years after the game's release? 4? It has been requested since the first survivor reached rank 1.
---
If that Michael had ears he would’ve easily been able to get you
---
It doesn't play bad had no issues ignore him he probably hasn't even tried it
---
This. Stay awake as much as possible and half his kit doesn't affect you.
---
Also stealth is an effective tool as well. He has no way to find you outside the use of perks so try to stay hidden.
---
People that still use self care are living memes. Just use bond and chill on a gen until someone comes near. It's so much faster than that 45 second self care in a corner not doing anything to progress the match. It's even worse if the killer has sloppy butcher and they're busy trying to self care though it or the ones that self care while devour or noed are active. They're literally a hindrance to the match then wonder why they're always losing and stuck playing with other shitty players.
---
Low rank killers couldnsay the same thing about not wanting to play a R1 and a rank 7 being a R16
---
Good point.
---
I’d say since it was a part of the dlc, they just didn’t feature it period except the perks
---
If anyone’s salty at the end of the game say “mad cuz bad” and leave
---
Ruin is over rated and not actually that good, just run pop, or corrupt. It's most effective against bad survivors but then their is not rly any point of running ruin against them anyways.
---
Nice drawing OP, keep it up.
---
Hard disagree in your section about dealing with toxicity. Ragequitting games is a bitch move for weak minded people. If a survivor teabags, laugh. It is funny. They are probably having fun and laughing too. There are a lot of flavors to choose from, don't choose salty. Pick ghostface and teabag them back. Then it is really funny.
---
Some survivors teabag/flashlight spam at you before running towards a loop shack or jungle gym. I understand this to be a mind game, a form of psychological warfare and a **valid strategy** for getting gens done and winning the game for them. You all know that too, I'm sure.
---
I either confidently beat them on the chase because I'm a mlg pro modern warfare 2 hatchet thrower or I go pick off a weak link elsewhere but I don't salt it up. I'm a trash survivor in comparison who can't loop for shit and frankly if I get chased, I'm dead in 20 seconds. My SWF are loop gods and bait the killer all game so I get every gen done for free and we never lose. I assume this is actually extremely common set up in most SWF groups as the killer so I always ignore the dude who obviously wants to be chased and is willing to teabag at you to save his baby dwight's life.
---
This is an amazing write up! As a new player, I’m grateful for these tips and tricks, since I think it’s pretty common knowledge that this game can be rough for newbies.
---
It won’t be a instadown , just a mori , so you’ll still have to down them , I mean they won’t depip if they died
---
You can change it in the game files, but switching graphic quality in the application of the game might reset the value back to what the devs have it as (i.e. changing it to medium settings go to all medium, replacing the values you changed). I've already messed with refresh rates, resolution, true fullscreen, and some graphic changes, and I don't think there's any bans on them. You've gotta know what you're doing though, and in my experience, some settings won't even change the performance (saying it's frames you want upped) in some cases for whatever reason.   
---
TL;DR It's in the game files, I suggest looking up the community guide for "disable V-sync" on Steam, as it shows the exact file that the graphic settings are in. If you run into any issues, you can change the in-game settings back and forth to low and it should reset what you changed.
---
Like I said I think its a technical thing. Freddy is understandable but I dont get Bubba being axed lol
---
Lol OK thanks. I'm desperately looking for reviews / gameplay. I want to buy it so I can play in bed.
---
That’s because they aren’t directly from the game. The person who uploaded those isn’t official he gets the character models and uploads them to workshop. If there aren’t any on the workshop that means no one uploaded them. I’m not sure how to get them but you could try look elsewhere online.
---
No, sorry it’s hard for you, playing against better players however will boost your skill quicker than playing against baby players. 
---
The old matchmaking screws the killers in this situation who are matchmade to a red rank SWF team with a rank 20 smurf account. It happens and it’s been getting abused.
---
Like I see those model render videos on youtube of the upcoming skins and I can't find even find a skin that has been out for more than a year ...
---
Then get immediately downed because locker jukes do nothing
---
For a second I thought maybe it’s Nintendo not wanting a pedophile on their system but they axed bubba too so I’m really confused, it has to be an issue with obtaining the license right?
---
Now, don't go clicking any suspicious links.
---
It does. It's the same as bbq for killers. It awards it to you post trial and combines with offerings
---
Honestly, unless you're veteran rank 1, the green ranks (9-12?) Are the hardest survivor experience. Green ranks are when there's very little nonsense and joking around as compared to white/yellow, and killers start having mostly meta perks, but still abt half the survivors are terrible and do nothing of value.
---
So basically what I'm getting at here is that 50/50 you were within +-15% of their skill level.
---
Maybe they couldn't find anyone else since my teammates were taking a while to do gens and one guy was left on hook in basement up until he almost died haha. It was a weird match. Definitely stood out.
---
You have to get it yourself from the files I’m pretty sure. If it’s not on workshop
---
need something for demogorgon
---
Okay I’m glad, got a bit worried that it didn’t and that I’d been wasting offerings this entire time
---
Just another bug ig
---
What do you mean by “PS4 is rolling out progressively”?
---
Toxic Nea coming in clutch haha. Btw love the drawing very cute &lt;3
---
No. It just applies to whatever points you earned during the match. Any offerings that add bloodpoints also go by what you’ve earned during the match.
---
I guess so
---
I dont understand how gameplay would be an issue with him, it has to be a license thing.
---
My wrists are screwed up to the point that repetitive button-mashing causes some pretty intense pain.  I'm fine if it's normal typing and I can rest every dozen keystrokes or so, or if it's straightforward gaming that just requires holding down a button for short intervals, e.g. movement keys, etc.  But if I'm expected to *rapidly mash* some key or mouse button more than a few times in a row, then you're basically asking me to hurt myself to the point where my hand is useless, which, obviously, I'm unwilling to do.
---
Resultant to that, there are a great number of things in games that I cannot do; and that flaw in my physiology is one of two major reasons that I've never played survivor in DBD and probably never will.  I'd be fine for that first hook.  Half of it at least—but after that, nope, I'm done.
---
That being said, I think the tap-to-struggle mechanic is fine.  It's preventing me and a small number of others from enjoying survivor to the fullest, but I'm sure that, by-and-large, the majority of the player base is unaffected.  Also, there *needs* to be that active element to the second phase to provide a challenge, a sense of danger, and some middle-ground between "sup, man—just hanging out," and "spidey-stabby-dead-n-floaty."  Just adding a hold in lieu of something more active would just be a second first hook to anyone who owns some Blu-Tack, a roll of tape, or a sufficiently weighted object of approximate keyboard key size.
---
A better option might be the occasional skill-check pop-up, like survivors are already accustomed to.  During the struggle phase, have the Entity occasionally take a stab at you, and pass a skill check to catch, dodge, deflect, spit on, duck away from, UNO reverse card—what-have-you, and avoid sacrifice.  There would still be that active element you'd have to watch out for, but it wouldn't be quite so traumatizing to your tendons and ligaments.
---
needs “one man cheeseburger apocalypse” perk. otherwise perfect
---
Thank god that was only in for a couple days before realizing they made on of the stupidest decisions ever.
---
At least their perks are available to all killers.
---
The only to I can agree with there is haddonfield and springwood because the other to have enough room for people to move around in there then being stuck
---
So for example 100% extra objective offering will give 8k extra points and then WGLF will give me 100% of my total points excluding the bonus from the offering?
---
Yes. Swf needed some sort of nerf so im very happy with this patch as a higher rank killer (as in, level 13-15). Now i actually have a chance to have some fun consistently and not just get bullied!
---
Don’t you know you’re not supposed to be good at the game and doing objectives jeez what game do you think this is dead by daylight
---
Wow you really put thought into this, Great job!
---
Steve looks chonky
---
Imagine starving for positive attention to the point that you help the enemy team just to fish for a "thank you"
---
I think you mean Dem O'Gorgon
---
Wouldn't it make more sense for the game to add the ranks together and average them out.
---
Or was that the issue with the old system.
---
you got a thing for baby dweets huh ?
---
Yes, my friend were having this issue on PS4 with me, we gave up to play, but this was before the hotfix tho.
---
Welp if anyone can tell me how to extractthem from the gamefiles I'd be happy
---
thank you!
---
Yup, it stacks with offerings.

Idk just in case it’s a red ranked killer, I’m only rank 12 and I’m not that good.
---
I'm just spit balling here, if you have any criticisms let me know.
---
When this glitch happens you always spawn back to the hatch. Its like a "sorry lol" from the developers
---
All of aces perks need a rework. Maby was not ace in the hole but the other two definitely
---
I saw a post like this, since the update someone who’d get 60 on ultra is struggling for 20 on any setting. I would recommend doing a gpubenchmark test and it shows you how all your systems are running on your PC compared to how they should be running. Then you could possibly identify the problem if it’s PC related or game related. But just FYI the game is poorly optimised and the update has caused problems for many people. 1 more thing, it could be a memory leak, I’m not an expert on it but basically it ends up with your games running like shit, so you have to reset your computer completely like a wipe.
---
Yup.
---
Yup
---
Its toxic, but it can work
---
I'm honestly fine with the removal of Bubba, but I know it will make some people sad.
---
I will genuinely miss Freddy and Quentin because they werw going to be the first dlc I would buy.
---
Id be down to play this but i cant be asked to start over for a third time.
---
Borrowed time
---
I understand. What I would offer in terms of feedback and exposure is just to keep creating content and eventually you’ll reach an audience. If you stream or anything like that just keep going and you’ll get more receptive feedback. Whatever was on your previous post, I wish you the best of luck. Even the biggest dogs were puppies at one point too.
---
If I may ask a question: Since the perks of Freddy, Quentin and Bubba are base, how different is their perk icons?
---
Honestly, with this matchmaking it wasn’t even people queuing with their brown rank friend.  Me and my friend would play together, he’s a rank 2, I’m a rank 5... we would get survivors who are 15/16s and my killer would be 20s. It was abusing our ranks the matchmaking was just fucked
---
I can't spend the entire match doing totems and not gens
---
It shouldn't have a downside because the stealth is very weak
---
A trend die off
---
Btw still has more views than DbD
---
I've been patiently waiting for him.
---
dead link bro
---
Then Perish.
---
Today's patch did that, should've at least
---
Then you would rather take a complete one sided slaughter in the killers favor every time over a meh game, where there is some chance of success for the new players. In my opinion all they needed to do was shift the average up a couple ranks to account for the difference made from the red rank player. If you would have gotten a rank 10-11 killer, just shift that up to a rank 7-8 killer instead.
---
Noone said anything about gens on this topic, but if you ask me during my 300+ h of playtime I've never got bored of doing gens (apart from the times I've played against bots).
---
Besides, repairing gens only requires holding down a single key while pressing another during skill checks, is pausable and failing isn't that punishing. On the other hand, struggling requires the **spamming** of the **same** key for **a minute**, the player is unable to pause to rest and of course failing results in instant death. On that note, having a more accessible and convenient struggle control isn't that irrational.
---
I know, but I wanna be effective
---
Has any official BHVR employee commented on why there's no Leatherface or Freddy? I know Freddy's rights apparently reverted back to the Craven Estate or something of that nature? 
---
Hopefully it's not a ''They'll never be on the Switch" situation.
---
Well yeah, survivors need to actually try and play pallets now. Like I said, there’s no more running from one safe pallet to next one like you do on all of the older maps. Survivors need to actually stay at the pallet and try to play it now instead of drop pallet, run away, drop pallet, run away, etc 
---
The only thing that makes it lopsided towards killer is bloodlust.
---
Stop bullshitting. You get so little points for being in terror radius it’s not even worth it. Especially considering how much of the killer’s time you’re wasting.
---
Can't get the video to save on my phone,
---
Just do bones or get good
---
Dark sense is pretty great (for a bit) when you’re running poised. I’ve used it before to successfully run away from a killer that’s pretty close to the gen I’ve finished. Now even better since they buffed it to any gen just like poised already was.
---
I have probably 3k hours (mostly on survivor) I don’t really care about rank but I do care about having fun. And worse killers tend to chase me for longer than they should and proceed to facecamp me after they realize 4 gens have popped and they’re going to lose. I just wish there was more someone could do as a survivor to combat face camps. Ya there’s perks and and anti tunnel. But it never really works out unless it’s a swf.
---
You CAN do some tinkering with settings in the files such as Vsync and such.
---
&gt; Unfortunately this also means red rank people can't help their new friends learn the game anymore without getting absolutely dicked on
---
the fact is, SWF is responsible for who they play with. the killer player has no control over who they play against. the killer should not be punished for who they're randomly matched against. if new players want killers at their skill level, they should simply choose to play with teams at their level.
---
This is so good!! Keep at it!!
---
Wake up might have been slightly edited. I think it will be similar to unbreakable on console before Bill was released. Where it looked like David
---
They should buff distortion tbh. There should be more tokens or a way to regain tokens
---
I tried telling my swf group that its sort of our fault we ALL got downed by noed, and some of them told me "it's the principle of it bro" and then sent hate messages to the killer :(
---
Three obnoxious Killer perks against six obnoxious Survivor perks.
---
So, yeah. NOED and Ruin are both Hex perks which can be countered by destroying totems.
---
Adrenaline, Sprint Burst, Balanced Landing, Decisive Strike, Head On, and Buck Wild can't be countered in a direct sense.
---
Right ? Especially because of his love for the hooks if you know what I mean. 🙃
---
It’s just not fun all around. Playing against a new killer isn’t fun for me. I wanna have some sort of challenge, not just demolish some poor guy who has less than 10 hours.
---
weak troll
---
Its barbara's body LMAO
---
Buck Wild

Hol up

I think these new pallets are just useless for the most part, all unsafe and killers with half a brain can walk around them. Mindgames dont really matter on the survivor side since you're likely to get hit no matter what unless the killer is really bad. It requires no skill to just run and drop pallet after pallet, and to walk around pallets. As a survivor and a killer, I dont like this map. As a survivor, your chances of escaping a chase through a pallet stun is greatly lowered, as a killer, its really boring chasing someone for 30 seconds till they try to stun you with an unsafe pallet which you can walk around easily. Looping takes at least some degree of skill, on both sides. A good survivor will loop the hell out of a killer, and a good killer will mindgame the shit out of a survivor. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be. At rank one this changes up since a lot of survivors dont make mistakes and look for mind games to avoid, but at every other rank theres a good chance you can mind game a survivor if you really try.   
---
Long paragraph, mostly a rant honestly.   
---
TL;DR: I dont like the new map pallets as a killer and a survivor.
---
I mean I cant think of anything besides when they added multi directional hooks, other than that I don't think they can properly without screwing over killers defending a hook from crazy altruism
---
Also i thought my 2.7K hours were alot, wow
---
Leatherface feels as underwhelming to play as in game compared to this. Pls buff him
---
Is that not the name?
---
Ooooooh yeah!!!!! 😍
---
I agree with that. I say that should be in the perk level progression. Like 3/4/5 tokens
---
"We have such sights to show you..."
---
Boil Over. Buck Wild is part of the song.
---
Well I’ve been playing the game since release so it’s not that long. Plus frequent breaks from the game.
---
I just finished writing a big ass essay on survivor and killer play. Your comment inspired me lol
---
People saying ruin isn't that good. There is a reason it's the most popular perk taken by killers in red ranks. It's true that against a perfectly optimal team, they would just work through it by hitting the great skill checks. In reality, most people can't hit all the great skill checks, and it slows down the game considerably. Even if it gets cleansed quickly, as long as it prevents 3 gens from popping in the first chase, it has done its job.
---
Did someone do a voodoo spell?
---
Same here
---
He really needs to come already 😂😂
---
He already ate Jeff’s ice cream since he didn’t need it.
---
Same here, but most of it was killer for me since solo play on survivor was... meh
---
Recently the rights to nightmare was given to the estate of Wes Craven so maybe they don't have permission
---
Yup. It's been happening to me on XB since the Stranger Things update. It's annoying. At this point it's quicker to just restart the lobby, like we had to do before. :(

They said "100% faster" ya dingus. That means an additional 100% progression. Or, put another way, twice as fast. If they had said "open the doors at 50/75/100% speed" then you'd be right.
---
sadly a Meg 😔
---
You got caught by the worst killer in the game in 2min.. rip
---
r/UnexpectedJoJo
---
If I’m not mistaken I believe he’s next on the rework list. Not only is is power quite underwhelming, but his addons are ripped from Billy and his personal addons are literally useless, so I expect an overhaul in the future.
---
Well we're already kinda restricted. Some Survivors are now louder or quiter than others, Like Ash and Jeff are Loud af, kinda making iron will a must for them
---
Dont disconnect if someone teabags what kind of advice is this?
---
Ruin I can understand but NoED? Like I'm talking from rank 5-1. You really think NoED is required to have a decent match? I acknowledge the talk about skill level, in fact that's kinda what I'm getting at. Perks like NoED enable some killers to get to ranks in which the need for NoED is little to none.
---
I like it. High rank killer queue times have been arround 7 minutes for me before the hotfix. Today I am gettings lobbys under a minute.
---
Most of the community uses voice chat. And I was talking about COMPETENT survivors — against all others demo can be high tier as well, but not a full com coordinated team. Sadly, no.
---
The David in my game  was probably the worst affected by it, the poor dude was stuck in the ground most of the game and the killer just stood there 😔
---
THAT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE STRUGGLING. ITS DIFFICULT BECAUSE ITS SUPPOSED TO BE DIFFICULT. You don’t call the expert mode on a game “ too hard “ because it’s supposed too be that hard!
---
Finally, some good freaking analysis. Very good post. Will share with people that I can.
---
He’s just standing there. Menacingly
---
I would rather take a game where all 5 players are of similar skill level. But that's not possible with a SWF roster we're talking about. And I'm on killer's side. Survivors can at least make some fun of each other. Killer got no one to cheer him up during unfun game.
---
I mean sure I got it on day one and I love it
---
Playing online with the switch already sucks. I don’t think it will be a fun experience with the long wait times and disconnects.
---
Teenager faces be like.
---
What can not be countered about boil over
---
Obnoxious.
---
Not overpowered.
---
 Yes, they have counters, just not in a way as simple as "hold the interact button for 14 seconds at a time."
---
Also, NoED is an endgame perk as well, so saying that about Adrenaline is an... interesting choice.
---
They look bad on all settings now. I played on low all the time, and it looked good. After they added in the Demogorgon everything looked fine except the hair was atrocious. Now they've put a bandaid fix over the hair problems to smooth it out, and they really just blurred everything out. Hair still looks bad, and everything else looks worse.
---
You literally just missed the sale last week when the game was free to play for the weekend.
---
Already talked about this in the official forum after someone had issue with it
---
This person story is about his wife that can't ever survive in game during the struggle phase since her hand can't do the same movement over and over again without causing pain.
---
This game should be enjoyable for everyone so just make it hold it would solve the problem of this couple (his wife even) as well as adding colorblindness options. Different for every kind of colorblindness if possible since many colors DbD use would look invisible or very hard to see being so bright.
---
I'm on it to make it more enjoyable for everyone, even for whom have problems, that can be a visual problem or a more physical one. Anyone should be able to enjoy gaming, I'm glad some people on the industry are making step forward towards this goal and if even a company like BHVR can make it a little more simple for who has those issues to enjoy their game, it's just a win for everyone.
---
I don't have any issue with the controls or visuals as they are but seeing many posts about it.. well, I think it is a problem should be solved already. If not too priority for how easily these changes can be made. It's literally just color changes and an option to make you hold to struggle, that's it
---
Borrowee time, decisive strike, and breakdown come to mind.
---
Lmao 😂
---
This is disgusting, and fucking hilarious
---
EGC is broken. Entity is killing survivors before the end of time
---
I'm saying adrenaline doesn't matter because the game is over after 5 gens. The thing is most games with 5 gens done are quick and dont provide the amount of points to pip. NoED lessens the chance to pip because you're dead now at the end of a match where you couldn't do anything.
---
Well, if the idea of balance it to overwhelmingly favor the killer since they are playing alone, then I'm afraid killers won't have people to play against for much longer.
---
Is it not on sale for you right now?
---
Demo corgi
---
It slows the game down for the 30 seconds it's up
---
Ye I'm confused, there is iron grasp? 
---
Honestly Boil over seems shit anyway.
---
I always see this in the videos, but is this confirmed or just people getting lucky?
---
I'm actually not sure if you can see the hatch while phasing, I've never tested it out. I would assume no, but then again the coding of this game can be questionable sometimes. I know for a fact that you can still hear it though, I have tested that.
---
RIP captain, you will be missed
---
I looked through your profile, I’ve seen the horrors you’ve posted. What the fuck have you done
---
Seriously just leave
---
Shred now destroys pallets by default, and the ultra-rare add-on that used to do that now tremendously increases the undetectable time after coming out of your portals while also increasing the cooldown of portal travel to 24 seconds.
---
Okay imagine someone who like the game but has a problem with their hands. If they make a constant motion, their hands hurts, especially on controller, where you move one finger over and over to one button, stressing the nerve that for the person in the example has issues, making it hurt
---
Now another example. You are colorblind and you can't see hooks, auras or anything that's bright red or yellow.
---
In both situations people are unable to enjoy the game at its fullest. I've seen both example countless times and make a game more accessible for everyone isn't being lazy, is being human, a decent one at least
---
It was literally near the top, the trapper fix. Doesn't hurt to read a little.
---
Excuse me sir but teabagging has a very unique meaning and implication, the likes of which the phrase “clamslamming” can only somewhat but never fully replicate in popular culture. Furthermore, if we must get into deep biological reasons for which a woman can not teabag, I might point out that depending on the size of Amanda’s labia, while (hopefully) still will never be large enough to biologically replicate a teabag, can still suffice for the action of “dipping” onto ones face to induce shame and disgust. #Freetheteabag
---
If you're gonna start the killing, you best start it right here. Make sure I'm all the way dead, because I'll come back and make you my bitch!
---
Maybe they glitched through the exit gate
---
Level 50, good sir
---
Level 100 is the next climb in devotion tier.
---
I'd say on average they last longer than 30 seconds. Slowing the game down in the first minute is extremely important because it should be the only time that the three people not currently in chase can all work on gens. The classic example is after the first chase there should be one in chase, one on hook, one rescuing/healing, and one on gens. If ruin saves you from having the first 3 gens pop in the first chase, then it's already one of the strongest perks in the game.
---
Same here, I mained spirit and got all perks on her for like 4ish months after she came out. Game got boring fast. I feel happy when I out mindgame a survivor, when I played her it was just too easy even at purple ranks. I'm with Myers, LF, Wraith and other M1 killers at this point because frankly it's more fun Whats the gameplay of standing still to "mind game" someone
---
This happened before when I began playing I was playing legion and everyone left besides a bill that couldn’t escape because of that bug while I watched the timer run out
---
Nice! Good job, mate!
---
I wasn't being sarcastic.
---
I do understand not everyone has stupid amounts of hours into the game because life. 
---
With that said survivor is arguably the easiest part of this game once you have 50+ hours as survivor. Some games you might get unlucky and be tunneled and have 3k points. But high majority of your games you should be averaging 15k even without escaping. 
---
I know it is anecdotal but in my experience I often get 2-3k more than other survivors who escaped and I died. 
---
You just have to always be doing stuff. If your not on a gen, then unhook/rescue, totems, chests, heals. Or when you unhook someone, make sure the killer finds you and not them. 
---
I was looking for a ruin totem before but saw killer chasing a injured survivor and ran over there and took their next hit. It gave me points, help that other player from going down and bought more time. Also lucked out and after juking the killer I found the totem. 
---
Point of that is just be always doing something. As much as I personally want this game to be super immersive and be hide and seek, the emblem system doesn't really support that. Neither the points system.
---
I hope this doesn't come off as argumentative because I do not mean it that way. 
---
Cheers
---
Might be because with the current rights with new line and Wes Craven’s estate
---
Where did I accuse you of doing that?

Maybe in the process, or in the process of getting it out regionally ?

Not buffed really, it makes sense once you know, basically his ultra rare that allowed him to shred break pallets is now his base kit.
---
Yeah, but at *rank 6?* You aren't going against low tier killers that get looped for the entire game, you're up against Nurses and Spirits that only have to hit once, and Hillbilly doesn't have to go for a chainsaw hit. You're up against people that can counter loops.
---
Sounds like I need to come back then.  Was sick and tired of every game being 3 red ranks with their “low rank” friend so they would play against my 26 hour, rank 16 killer ass and get stomped non-stop.  It had stopped being enjoyable in the least.
---
That’s a fair point.
---
I really like botany knowledge, small game, lithe, and bond 😊
---
Who ownes wes’ estate? He’s dead right?
---
I'm on ps4 is that the friends button?
---
Yeah, this new matchmaking system is bonkers. Matchmaking isn't some new science that DBD is pioneering. There's a reason that other games use matchmaking algorithms beyond just taking the highest/lowest rank or even the average of the players. There are proper methods for creating fair matches between players using weighted averages and adjusting the weights of different ranks based on win/loss data. Having a proper matchmaking algorithm should be priority number 1 for a PvP game with only a ranked playlist available.
---
Pharmacy says hi
---
I’m with ya. 2 days of being in a 3 man red rank swf and matching with rank 18-20 killers was awful. We had to intentionally go down or get hit to get enough altruism to pip.

---
It is kinda a bummer that playing immersed and objectives gives you significantly more points than running a killer for a long period of time, though. Like if I run a killer for a majority of the game while my team does gens and occasionally heals each other, they'll outscore me.
---
Weird players met doesn't show up for dbd

It’s just too easy honestly. Hopefully they nerf her soon

I was just in a game and 30 seconds in the game tells me of an EAC error 4 and I need to verify my game files and then closed the game, I spotted someone had posted the same bug in the forums, maybe it could be this that is affecting a lot people since the patch.

---
Tuft of hair is basically a worse Plague ^_^

What I meant is, for a killer who can detect if a survivor is close to one of the two doors just by holding m2, he didn't use his powers to his advantage. He could have just stood still holding m2 and wait till he heard a heartbeat of one of the portals

Only 2 years?

---
I tried the game earlier, in handheld mode. I used to play at rank 1 both sides on PC. I don't know how can you guys play Hillbilly on console but that seems to be really really harder than on PC. Controlling view with sticks was not smooth at all. I did'nt tried survivor yet but I think it will be maybe easier than killer. For sure tho I will only be playing M1 killers if I give it a shot again ... not sure yet. I'm pretty disappointed overall but I didn't played a lot.
---
that genuinely scared me
---
I'm a rank 1 player, just to clarify. The problem is that many of my friends who were just getting into the game are going to have a terrible time now if I play with them. They've already told me that the reason they don't play as much is because they feel like they are just holding back their team.
---
Should be in the settings
---
At least you can avoid that, I can time a locker juke or something.
---
The vomit, she can sit there till I’m broken then swing. Not much counter play there.
---
I'm sorry but I'm going to have to hard disagree with you, disconnecting ruins the game for everyone, it's more toxic than anything else you can do in the game, if everyone just disconnected when the match wasnt going their way the game would be unplayable.
---
Better advice, if you're have a strong urge to press the dc button, go into a corner in the game and just stop playing, go on your phone or something until the game ends, take a break. This way you dont screw other people over too much.
---
Do you have a source? Cuz the one other comment says no &gt;,&lt;

It's not in the in-game settings

Groovy.

indeed

Exactly

Tell them it doesnt matter. Use high rank games as a learning experience for them. After all, a rank 1 giving tips on how to beat rank 1 killers while they’re going against a rank 1 killer will help more than giving tips to beat good killers against a potato rank 20 killer

Essentially meaning you can't have a low rank player or two in your survive with friends group and get matched against much lower rank killers and believe them the whole match or get an easy win. I can understand some people thinking that this isn't fair to the low ranks in the group... But they have communication and coordination. One red rank Survivor can easily carry a team against a low rank killer. Especially with voice comms or pre-match coordination.
---
Honestly this change alone has made me so happy. It's the best patch note I have seen in a long time. It feels like the developers are actually listening and trying. I really can't praise this change enough and I feel like it will eliminate a huge amount of toxicity from the community. I couldn't tell you how many times I've nearly quit this game when I was new because red rank survivors were bullying me while I was still a gray rank killer trying to learn the game. They have just fixed a genuine problem with the ranking system and all I could really hope for now is adding a reward for your rank at the end of the season. Even if it's just a certain amount of shards auric cells if you hit rank one.

Thank you so much to the balanced team and Developers for doing this. You guys are the unsung heroes of this community

Last time this happened to me they sandbagged me, gathered around me on the hook and all just pointed at me then escaped.
---
I hate SWF even as a survivor, soo happy with the new changes.
---
He’s one of the shadow people :O
---
Welcome to the killer experience with the previous matchmaking.   I've had 2 games in the last 3 weeks that did not have at least one red rank being a cunt.   Those games had purples.
---
It definitely should be green if it doesn’t have sounds
---
This is brilliantly cursed.
---
Yup, exactly. And sure there are always going to be people who derank, but now you have people who usually would never derank but are now going to so they can play with newer friends.
---
I'll give hatch to the last person if:
---
* that survivor wasn't overdoing the BM
---
* they KOBE because I respect the 4%
---
* I demolished the survivors by a landslide so they get their pity safety pip
---
* was cheated by having terrible team mates / DC's
---
* they weren't a fucking immersive blendette
---
“Speculation”, I think you mean leak.

Playing him like that makes more sense to me personally
---
If youve played dark souls, hate mail is funny because you know you made someone so mad at you to do that
---
But the Nea saw him placing the trap, that's why it's 1000 IQ.
---
love him or hate him he spitting facts
---
Literally walk around them, takes no skill on either side, coming from a survivor and a killer
---
Believe it or not throwing someone under the bus isn't always the best way to teach them, *especially for a game that's supposed to be fun*
---
yes
---
Feel free to add me on switch if you wanna survive with friends :p
---
Sounds incredibly tryhard and unfun to play but you can play however you want, you bought the game.  Personally I don't see the fun in ignoring my power but like I said whatever floats your boat.
---
Happens to me quite often since the dlc.
---
I haven't played against any SWF yet (rank 12 btw) that didn't have less than one red rank player and 2 grey ranked players. Still bugged. Still pissed. Currently planning to drink the pain away. Fuck SWF.
---
(Sorry for the rant. Got bullying as a Bubba by a SWF that wouldn't finish the damn game. The team consisted of 3 rank 1-3 players and one rank 20 player, whom of which looped me more than the other three did. Just needed to vent)
---
Weird that you commented that when I wasn't talking about anything related to it.
---
Same as wraith body blocking, unless they hold the game hostage, good for the killer for executing a strategy
---
Dbd and fun dont mix well. At least, thats what i’ve learned from how mad both sides seem to be at eachother 24/7
---
*spirit fury and enduring have entered the chat*
---
In a day and age where survivors are now getting healed for doing totems, ppl still complaining about noed
---
I really think the perk should work like or at least similarly to Aftercare. As long as you were there to heal the Survivor **to** full (regardless of how much healing they needed) then you get the perk.
---
Perhaps it needs some tweaks to stop people from 99%ing with Self Care and then finding Steve to heal them but honestly if people want to do that let them. It's a perk that can only go off twice in a match and it's essentially We'll Make It but for you instead of your allies.
---
Don’t forget us  killer mains at rank 15 and above having to play against rank 1s with a low rank swf
---
Say it with me:  PERKS AND ITEMS = TOXIC.
---

On average it slows each generator's progress down by 30 sec

**What Now?**
---
that's ok i didn't wanna play with all my friends who are new to the game anyways i guess
---
Excluding the Chili addons that have been bugged since release Leatherface has major slowdown when using his chainsaw. It's perhaps not a bug so much as it is a design oversight that makes him way worse. There's also the major issue of hitboxes where you can end up hitting a wall and stunning yourself even if you run into a pallet or something similar.
---
As for Plague I think conceptually from a pure balance standpoint she's fine and perhaps even on the strong side. A Killer with permanent NOED or Huntress on steroids is going to inherently be strong, because NOED is one of the strongest perks in the game and Huntress already has to have severe limits on her power (Humming and 110% ms) which Plague doesn't have when using Corrupt Purge. The main thing holding her back right now is the multitude of bugs that would make even Leatherface blush. (My personal tier list has Pig above Leatherface above Plague because they have "quite a few bugs but work at their core", "some bugs that affect their core", and "a ton of bugs that affect their core.) (Main bugs being with the vomit hitbox, because Behaviour can't make hitboxes for shit.)
---
The problem with Plague is that she is really, *really* **boring.** Plague is a lose-lose scenario for everyone involved. No one has fun playing both as or against Plague. Survivors don't have fun being permanently Broken all match, and Plague doesn't have fun not getting to use half her power and playing an M1 Killer with "permanent NOED." Likewise Survivors don't have fun trying to dodge an AR-15, and Plague doesn't have fun searching the entire goddamn map for a Survivor when she gets her AR-15. Plague's core concept is inherently flawed as it takes all control away from both sides. There's (realistically) zero counterplay to Plague's vomit since as soon as you touch it even for a millisecond it can not go away unless you cleanse, and again cleansing gives Plague an AR-15 so damned if you do damned if you don't. Likewise it's no fun for Plague to be at the mercy of the Survivors and their infinite pallet loops as well as their choice to cleanse or not.
---
A lot of people criticized old Legion (as well as new Legion) for the same reason and it's really great to see that Behaviour learned *absolutely fucking nothing* from Legion and basically made Legion 2.0 with twice the cancer and half the fun. It's actually kinda impressive how many similarities Legion has to Plague (injure Survivors very easily, force them to spend extra time to heal themselves) but while (new) Legion has a decent amount of counterplay from the Survivor's side with juking and good pallet usage there's literally no counterplay to Plague. And likewise while a good Legion can use their power strategically for mobility all Plague can do is play a default Killer.
---
tl;dr Plague is Legion but worse, and Legion is often regarded as the worst Killer they've ever released.
---
ive gotten a game like that
---
If you're being a dick then it'll be considered toxic, sure, but if you're just trying to bodyblock and kite the killer then it's on the killer's own head if they decide to fall for your ruse.
---
This blurry mess solves none of the hair issue.
---
I don’t get it. They messed up with the hair. They should fix the hair instead of adding blurriness to obscure how bad the hair modelling and rendering are post 3.2.0.
---
portajohn's that act as lockers for when you need to get out of a... shitty... situation
---
Look of the DBD tutorial on how to disable vsync. It makes the skillchecks bullshit and inconsistent. Get rid of vsync and then practice hitting the great skill checks.
---
&gt;[Self Care wastes time](/intensifies)
---
mmu!!
---
some of us play on laptops :P i play at negative resolution.
---
I can’t find anything in swf. But solo seems to be alright. Longer than before but not too long to handle. Still quite irritating
---
Don’t apologize dudes a child.
---
I mean I can tell u a rank 10ish is dumb both sides killer and surv, so it would be a look base game, either the killer destroys the ranks 20/15/10 or get destroyed by the rank 5 which is what normally happens, I would say that it is the killer problem, just don’t chase the purple(?)rank(tbh rank 5 is not that good but still a monster in front of a rank 10 killer)but as I pointed before players are dumb and they won’t gave up a chase, it’s the equality to a gen tunnel for survivors.
---
The ability to break a limited amount of walls or windows, I feel it would be interesting to have a killer break a wall forcing you to play differently and it'd and more counter play on both sides
---
O-oh
---
... RUDO!!!! TOKI  WO TOMARE!!!
---
Just leave them on the ground for a minute
---
Gotta love getting cucked by the hatch, shits happened to me way to many times
---
It’s alright mate everyone forgets some shit, how that helps
---
The tier list is always based at Red Rank. Being a M1 at Red Ranks can be tough. Sure she has great tracking and one shots, but she can be looped. Add that most high rank survivors run Dead Hard which is basically another health state and the Plague's problems are clear. She's okay, but she can't hold her own very well at higher ranks.
---
lol at the swf fix.
---
How about the fix for all the deranking killers? or putting green ranks with red? I'm high rank and I get killers around my level but survivors anywhere from 13-20. Killers come in with sweat, top tier killers, meta perks, NOED, moris and the green ranks I'm put with get wiped out in seconds.
---
Would be nice if they balanced it the other way but then they seem to be appealing to killer mains fragile egos at the moment so I guess that fix wont be coming anytime soon
---
I’m so sad
---
Yeah self-care is trash, I agree
---
The hatch can spawn in the other basement
---
Report them
---
Well it was an easy win if you gave them hatch that’s the easiest win you can get
---
Yeah, I've noticed a few times where it's been taking the average. I play swf with my low rank friends, I'm rank 5, and it's been constant green/yellow killers. Tbf, my friends are genuinely low rank, in skill, so it's not been an annoyance for the killer
---
So you're on the bus and behind you a kid screams "FUCKING BITCH STOP CAMPING LEARN TO PLAY FFS NOOB REPORTED!"
---
That's not *false* but misinformed. Custom perks currently won't get you banned, but if EAC ever gets updated to detect if those files are changed and you get banned, they said they won't unban you.
---
visual bug. you should be keeping your pips when a killer DCs.

To be honest you can’t really complain you just got a bad hand.
---
I did. waiting on a email from the devs
---
Unrelated but does your name come from Black Ops 3?
---
If I could gift you GFCOT and Security Camera I would lol
---
You have to close the hatch , it stops them from going in mid animation
---
If you look carefully, you can spot the alpha
---
Mostly I just see people with the title “so this happened to me, they still haven’t fixed it”
---
MYC on Huntress LUL

Git gud noob

Daft
---
Is your WiFi connection bad? Do you have bad WiFi in general?
---
Agreed as fun as it was to average 4 gen chases on Coldwind back then I also played killer heavily too so I knew how bullshit it was the whole time.  That was the first and most significant in a long series of survivor nerf patches that made playing killer fun again.  That's why it's annoying to see the players now still calling for nerfs when it's like bitch do you even know how bad we used to have it?  Killer has come a long way over the past year of balance updates.
---
Wait my computer doesn't have a delete key...
---
Drops a bit as in how much?
---
... nvm
---
BWEN! Sorry wrong!
---
A **camper** is a Killer who hooks a Survivor.
---
A **tunneller** is a Killer who chases a Survivor.
---
**Killers** should learn how to not frustrate Survivors by standing in a corner all match.
---
Any other use of these words is incorrect, and playing Killer in any other way than what is suggested is a bannable offence.
---
are you saying that the devs dont need to fix it?
---
Yea same, they threw themselves at the basement didnt played safe at all
---
Yeah they should only have one or the other!
---
Big brain time
---
A gem indeed
---
Thank you for sharing 
---
*v-v-v-v-v-vodka sex vodka sex

v-v-v-v-v-vodka sex vodka sex*

I'm more curious as to how they know what everything looks like smeared with vaseline.
---
What’s it like to be so salty you judge people for how they play a video game you weren’t even a part of
---
Nah, I'm usually 100/12
---
Nice!
---
Why would I be implying that? I’m saying as it is, that people have seen this glitch before, and have probably seen that people can escape through hatch as well
---
Then yeah they should probably fix that
---
Exactly! "Oh man the game is in the worse state its ever been!" Fucking lol
---
Ah, gotcha. Thanks so much for clarifying.
---
Someone *please* one-up this. I lack the vocabulary.
---
no. BHVR is incompetent and have proven they have no interest in fixing DBD. They'd try to revive Deathgarden *yet again* before they fix this game.
---
Lmao it’s funny cause u can break him out behind fking walls, u r just bad/he had addons, yeah I mean those 2 were the reasons.
---
Players commenting a killer is brain dead is none of their concern. He is in the game. Selectable and playable. People will bitch about anything nowadays it seems. I’m a survivor main but I don’t ever disconnect. There is no point. People need to get over themselves and just play the damn game
---
None
---
Yep, that's usually the case, but there's an exploit which can cause the survivors to lose pips as well. Dedicated servers should help resolve that issue.
---
Believe it or not I think Killers have better FPS. It drops to mid 20s I think? Survivors feel much more sluggish. The killers I played as so far were Clown and Spirit.
---
I've already been in two games in a row with red ranks so I'm not sure what this update did.
---
Tunneling is way more profitable than camping. Removing somebody from the game when there are 3 or more gens left pretty much nets you a win.
---
SWFs have a survival rate less than 49% which is only 8-9% above the survival rate of a solo player, what's the issue exactly?
---
Welcome to the Fog, Switchers
---
mashing is dumb imo, its just annoying and if you mistap for an eight of a nano second, you die, like what the fuck is that bullshit, same thing happens if you get a lag spike
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
I countered the same after the new patch, so it must be releated to that.
---
I love it how steve is acting like this is completely cool and Nancy is like "Wtf??"
---
I think you mean SWF, there is no VC in the game itself so they’d have to be on discord or in a party on the consoles
---
Baby nurses are adorable too, but you need to put them down before they grow up and get out of control.
---
I mean neither do I, and I agree people shouldn't DC and I can't wait til the add the husk system they were talking about all DCing does is make you and the killer lose out on BP the survivor more so, but its not like they get punished for DCing you get what a 5 second cooldown that done if you just go get yourself a cup of water
---
Lol if I die with an amazing item I spectate and hope someone picks it up. Like don’t let it go to waste team!
---
Inosuke hatchets make a breathing sound when they pass.
---
**OOOOOH FUCK MY ASS WITH A CACTUS THIS MAKES ME ALL KINDS OF HAPPY**
---
Probably grab you when you try and escape again
---
Yea! Educate OP
---
This made my day, thanks! :D
---
Do you remember
---
Dude its such a nitpick, we wanted to quickly see if we could do it in the spur of the moment. Listen to yourself man. Its ridiculous.
---
Fair enough man lol
---
Only had one game like this. It's how I got adept pig
---
Yes, but I still want to know what I could have done
---
Uninstall game from SD card, turn system off, Take SD card out, start up and reinstall from eShop
---
Please before you embarrass yourself please learn how to break him out and the whole mechanic before you complain.  The only problem is that your survivors body can block you from exposing him.
---
I think it’s anyone with the bright hairs, like I’m not toxic at all (aside from maybe some pointing at a pallet when I’m being tunneled) but I think I get singled out cause I use the blue pig tails and mask Feng.
---
When you say you never found him fun to play against you are of course aware he was completely reworked and he plays as and against as a completely different killer right?
---
Correct
---
Is he in the centre of your screen without your characters body blocking it, +revealing 20% or more of him depending on his add ons.
---
Honestly.... I felt the same way, but I'm about to be out of town and thought what the heck... Something to have on the side. I've played nothing but handheld so far and I'm impressed.
---
To be fair both those locations can’t be used to rake the game hostage since after doing a gen a way out opens.
---
I don't DC because that's bad form.
---
Well for one get better at looping and pray the rest of your teammates bare good to slow dying light tokens, heal as much and as frequently as possible to stop thanatophobia, and you can get in lockers for the 4 second interval of bbq to hide your aura.
---
Hmmmmmm to each their own I guess.
---
You know devs got thoose statics based on 1 week of data right??
---
Game now crashes when Dying Light reaches 4 to 5 tokens /s
---
Loads of people still do, and I agree
---
what the fuck is happening with steves cheeks
---
What’s happening with the Wes Craven stuff, heard that some legal trouble was happening but I don’t know the situation
---
Yea plague seems to be pretty hated
---
thanks dude!
---
He had one too many ice creams
---
I would add vending machines, then me and Dwight are gonna dash cans of coke at the fucking killer. Each can is 5+ tin for killer and a 6 second stun. Unlimited cans for survivors obviously
---
Understandable tbh.
---
While I've never played against one, my plague games tend to last twice as long as when I play other killers.
---
Not 3 Gen yourselves. Legion only works at a medium okay level if survivors are grouped. It's not the killer's fault you made mistakes.
---
It doesn't change the fact that it's an unnecessary risk that shouldn't need to be taken by the survivors. People are allowed to complain about a problem that needs to be fixed.
---
Licensing issues with those properties probably are kind of complicated at the moment. While they got everyone else, the recent move of Nightmare to the Wes estate probably didn't help the Switch version. Leatherface on the other hand I have no fucking idea what's going on with that.
---
Nah i love the messages. Tells me im doing something right
---
I can, they won't want to play anymore though.
---
We only got one gen done
---
I question your sanity if you were a Quintin main unironically.
---
I figured this was VRChat.
---
Just wish the avatar had a gesture to have the mouth open
---
Stop twerking, i can't unsee that
---
IS THAT JANES ASS
---
Man, I feel your pain. I tried to play killer earlier but between the shitty FPS and whatever they’ve done to the sensitivity I couldn’t stand it. Switched to survivor, got camped by iri head Huntress. Tried again, left to die on first hook by immersed red rank teammates. Tried again, bugged three man lobby. Tried again, another lobby glitch where everyone was frozen until I got kicked.
---
I’m on the verge of uninstalling the game to be honest. I tell myself the game will get better on PS4 eventually but I think the devs just don’t give a shit. It seems like the only people left playing at this point are people trying to mine salt.
---
Oh here we go, grasping at straws to complain about something else.
---
I love when you mind game yourself against a low
---
rank killer.. and you’re laying on the ground like who the fuck would go that way 😂
---
I only struggle on the new map and whenever I get bloodlust. I laughed earlier because the switch doesn't have the bloodlust lag. But the same fucking maps as PS4 lag as well.
---
Steve: Man this is great
---
Demogorgon: \*Incoherent flesh muffled screeching\*
---
Steve: You're right, we should do this more often
---
I was thinking that the perk activates when a chase is going on close to the survivor on the gen
---
Nah not against a Legion.  Healing through Sloppy and Than will lose you the game.  That's what he wants you to do it's the reason they have that loadout.  They just needed to split up to opposite parts of the map and bang out solo gens.
---
Turns out it’s the bus driver playing killer
---
Console
---
The only thing they'd really nerf is prayer beads, which would honestly be for the best. I couldn't really imagine them touching the rest of her kit.
---
&gt;Back
---
I was playing Bubba for a daily and the survivors stomped me most of the game. But I got one at the end and put her in the Basement. Then they all threw them selves at the hooked person and I got an easy 4K. And they called me a Camper too.
---
That is a better idea, as you can tell from my flair I don't exactly play survivor a lot.
---
Did you check if there are any options causing it to lag. Also check if discord is open. On my computer discord makes the game lag
---
&gt; Its not fun to be the main target of a killer, and it really isn't fun to be playing against strong killer builds.
---
I sincerely believe that people that feel this way should seriously think about uninstalling. If dunking on poorly built wraith is fun and playing against tryhard nurse isn't, I don't even understand what you're doing here.
---
Yes obviously they should delay until they work, is this an actual argument for something?
---
No one wants broken servers, obviously. Does that change anything about what's been said? No? Ok. Thanks for pointing it out though.
---
Cat, “wtf Carl”
---
I got 6 stacks, didn’t crash for me, crazy on Freddy with rope or chains.
---
I got Hex: Ruin in the first bloodweb, BBQ &amp; Chili in the second, and Nurses Calling in the 5th. The RNG Gods were shining down on me that day!
---
For indoor maps, or maps with large buildings, they should add beds or dressers to hide under. It would be the same thing as a locker, just a different animation.
---
Very easy thank you for the informative reply!
---
Yeah I do too, but when I said boiling point I meant just frustrating me all game then the tbag tips me over the edge
---
I remember when that was the most awesome thing a killer can do, to be like "Well well well, I don't see you taunting me now, bitch!"
---
Now we got teabagging killers, the Plague Mori ending, the clown's laughing and facial expressions, etc.
---
One day, we will get a killer that can point, or click a flashlight...
---
The timer was well over a minute, you had plenty of opportunities to leave but you didn’t.
---
Holy shit I experienced the same thing! I would hook a survivor, the bar would fill, then...
---
*An Error has a occured*
---
Last time I tried to peak from up there, I couldn’t see much below me. Noise is the secondary “hol’up” sense if ya ask me.
---
Pallet vacuum was around long enough survivor mains actually thought they worked as intended.
---
Many head shaking debates where had.
---
its worse when you have 2 baby friends because every rank 1 you get matched with will dodge because there's two rank 15s in the lobby and it takes f o r e v e r until you get one poor sucker who is just tabbed out
---
Lmao it loaded up and immediately disconnected I was kinda curious what the game would’ve been like
---
Ash will be S tier and entire teams will only play him. Any bonus no matter how big or small, if it effects movement speed or gen speed, you will see everyone play those kind of survivors.
---
I have only ever found one way to fix this after a match of plague. I had to completely do a hard reset of my Xbox, Modem, and Router. DBD was screwed for a few days afterwards, but even though I had that problem nearly twice a day, it was gone afterwards. Try it if you want.
---
I was wondering, got like 9 pips closed the game and reloaded and was 20 again.
---
I forgot to mention that that’s what they changed the red moss add on to
---
This is how I’ve played him since he came out. Works way better.
---
every time
---
A lag switcher.
---
May as well ask them to farm so you get something in return LMAO
---
the graphical update was unneeded on low quality when no one asked for it, it's low quality for a reason
---
I’m like 90% sure you can grab a healthy survivor off of a vault. The interaction works just like any other grab interrupt.
---
Heart Attacks.... poor bastard....
---
So *that’s* why my game kept crashing. My dying light was fucking me ip and didn’t know it. I was doing so well on so many games and I kept getting cucked by dying light

No sorry, I didn't sacrifice a goat in the center of a circle made of virgin blood in order to decloak Ghostface, all I did was look directly at him because the power should work as it says it does, my bad
---
*puts in entire dictionary*
---
Problem solved
---
Also why is the game being so buggy right now? My mouse is functioning fine and is in all other games but in DBD today whenever i hold mouse 1 it will sometimes cancel what im doing, tried to do a gen and it kicked me off it 9 times in a row as if i were gen tapping? And i just played a game against a rank 19 trapper with just agitation no addons and he had 0 terror radius???? What is happening to this game?
---
My friend and I just got the same !
---
Except there are 4 survivors. The better/higher ones should be able to look out for the lower/newer ones. The way it was before the game was stacked against the killer as there is only one. Nobody has the killers back if he makes a mistake or misplay.
---
Yup, I have it :(
---
As a Myers and Spirit main, this does my heart good.
---
Na looping is running the jungle gym corectly and not putting the pallet down after first hit
---
It’s fun though
---
Stop hacking.
---
Same for my brother and I
---
You realize that doesn't really negate what I said right? That is still "get better teammates" which if someone wants to play a quick game of dbd, they're not gonna troll for people on the discord. 
---
I agree with everything you said, but there's no real counter to tunneling besides juking the killer.
---
I'll be a one man

---
Make it so you can get 1 token back when a generator gets completed and 2 when you complete the generator.
---
Sorry but I don’t agree. The win condition for survivors is surviving. The win condition for killers is killing. Pipping is a balancing mechanic to keep games somewhat fair and queue times relatively short, nothing more. 
---
If surviving and killing was totally irrelevant to most people then you wouldn’t see as many people running meta perks, slugging, bringing insta heals, running map offerings, etc. People want to kill or survive, it’s literally the point of the game.

I'd like to see Pallets and Lockers "reskinned" or remodeled. There are some great ideas here already: Instead of a red wooden locker, why not hide under a bed? The answer to that is "Huntress reloads" but honestly it's not to far-fetched to keep hatchets under the bed in the Entity's realm. 
---
Pallets too: Why not ancient babylonian statues on Plague's map that shatter and can be crawled under for Survivors? Or high tech government computers for the Underground complex? It's so weird seeing old pallets in there, they look so out of place.
---
Which map were you playing?
---
Iv got the same. after a game i got booted to the same screen and i cant get in
---
I don’t DC, I just kill myself on hook. But probably only against Prayer Beads Spirit, and depending on my mood, even regular Spirit. Such a bullshit killer that needs changes even more than Nurse (who I think is fine in terms of base kit).
---
To get more BP. Dumb question.
---
I don’t DC, but going against a legion makes me want to
---
Same, right after I typed gg, hope I still got my bp for that match lol
---
So no?
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
My bad. I read "three-man'd" as three genned. Still there's especially no excuse then. You guys just played bad it sounds like.
---
I implore a person, belonging to the genus of bipedal hairless apes, to assist me in the endeavor of improving upon, functionally recreating, or otherwise cleverly rewording the above text for the sole purpose of achieving a psychological advantage over the creator as my own range of understanding over the body of words encompassing the English language is severely lacking.
---
Well there are happen even stranger things
---
Noted. I took the plunge and bought it. Ended up being about (after discount) £80. Yikes. I hope its worth it. Lol
---
Hair became invisble on low settings, so they apparently fixed that. GOOD. It looked hilarious/terrible for me.
---
Same here on PC. Let's wait for a fix.
---
The game is ass
---
Maintenance Tuesday on steam
---
I was so excited to buy this tonight but there have been a lot of complaints ima wait a bit.
---
Then why does the game literally tell you that you won't be ranked according to survival rate?
---
You do realize this is just marketing bs right? Yeah your "goal" in the game is to survive just as much as your goal in resident evil is to survive zombies or whatever but this is not how the game works...
---
I never said I can’t handle criticism, I was simply explaining why I think you’re incorrect in thinking there’s nothing you can do. You can always talk to your team mates after match if the killer stays. I do it all the time. Sure, it doesn’t help you in that match specifically, but it’s good to spread awareness and help be a knowledge base for people. And you really don’t need to “troll for people” in the discord. There are always open SWF groups. Frankly, if you can’t handle a thoughtful reply without lashing out at someone then maybe you shouldn’t comment.
---
Poor Bill.
---
I will never abandon my boy
---
Nea killer
---
The killer 1 tapped me with Noel at the exit gate
---
Yes, happened to me once when I was running to the exit gates, trapper was just as confused as I was.
---
Damn, 3 wheels gonna whip out a sniper and take me from across the map while the other is gonna just sit in basement all game tsking out all basement chest goers
---
Man I know I wish I could of done something
---
Of course
---
I don't think killers care about survivors taking care of their hands.
---
strictly is correct, only injured survivors can be grabbed while vaulting.
---
This is my favorite part, actually. It doesn't matter if I play good/bad on killer/survivor.. someone will have a serious problem with me. I've been taking a break from PC DBD and playing on my PS4 in the living room, and I have to say that I'm enjoying all of the salt that can't reach me. Only accept messaging from friends and you can't be harassed.
---
Behaviour love to use outdated controls and I don't get it
---
Out of my own personal fear, I always thought a robotic killer would be terrifying.
---
Steam went offline. They're doing maintenance
---
Mfw i'm about to overuse a meme
---
Huh, the more you know!
---
Won't calm down for a second, let's talk about this.
---
You think nurse who breaks the game is fine but spirit isn’t??? Ok lol
---
My pc did this for a while (dbd only game I play) and couldn't work it out but then it just stopped doing it...? Maybe from my uninstall and reinstall?
---
Just commented on this up in the thread a bit. I absolutely LOVE no chat.
---
Noms
---
I'm interested to see how else they plan to make a chainsaw user different but still interesting from Billy.
---
so you're just assuming things. Nice. Dud you're just being ridiculous get out.
---
Your bloodpoints don't reflect pipping.
---
Just because he’s done other types of lewd cosplay, doesn’t mean an innocent picture has to be put in a gay subreddit. Common man don’t be an idiot
---
Great post! Full of useful information and tips for players. I'm a newer player myself, and definitely ran into a lot of toxicity when I first bought the game that I stopped playing entirely until Ghostface and Stranger Things piqued my interest. Now I'm having a blast, just focusing on ignoring the salty people.
---
Then they learn and get better. At least that’s what I was told when I was getting bullied as a new killer against red rank survivor swfs
---
Consoles don't have macros and people suffer from some issues so they are unable to enjoy the game at its fullest. like for people who has colorblindness or problems with their hands
---
In short, your comment is irrelevant
---
Rank one in survivor and rank one on doctor. But this was way back when spirit was just released. I don’t care to climb rank any more and just hover around 10-15 in order to have casual games. If I get to high I play basement camping leatherface and that will normally de pip me pretty quick.
---
\*OhTofu goes on a rant for 5 minutes on why Iron Will is the worst perk in the game\*
---
It's a reference to the 80s. They used to smear vaseline on the camera lense to make things look like that
---
But its on the dbd subreddit

https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49456/optimization-status-update-road-to-60fps/p1
---
&gt; When we first released Dead by Daylight back in 2016, we targeted 30 FPS on our minimum spec. Up until recently, we optimized the game in bursts; for the console launch and before releasing a new Killer. We are now ready to set a new performance target: Dead by daylight will run at 60 FPS on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and minimum spec PCs.
---
I can't recall where I heard about the Switch targeting 30FPS. And I'm not sure if they have made an update to this since or not.
---
Because rank is a rough means of sorting people according to ability, and you can play well and still die or not 4k. Ranking up can be your goal if you want it to be but it doesn’t make it the point of the game. 
---
If the average kill rate was 10% but killers pipped nearly every game, do you think killer players would be happy and congratulating BHVR on their excellent balance, or complaining that they never get to actually kill anyone? If survivors pipped every time they got facecamped, do you think they’d stop complaining about it? Nah.
---
They should've changed it long ago to just hold it as well for colorblindness options. It's insane they didn't do anything yet
---
So you’re saying you need to have swf crippled to be able to play against them? I mean dude, get good lol
---
I think in this case it's because their character is flatfaced against a wall.
---
steam is down every day at this time for maintenance
---
And the people saying that were wrong, that’s the wrong attitude to have, whether it’s directed at killers or survivors, that way of thinking just stops anyone new sticking with the game.
---
You definitely have to do more to pip though as you go up. Have to do a little bit of everything.
---
steam is down every day at this time for maintenance, should be back on in less than an hour
---
Too many drawings *sigh*
---
steam is down every tuesday at this time for maintenance, should be back on in less than an hour
---
Hey bud. I thought I was replying to a question about today’s patch. My bad.
---
I had no idea that lunging doesnt allow you to interrupt actions I just thought i was doing something wrong, thanks for letting me know
---
Dude he got a near perfect game. Not pipping for that is a huge problem
---
I love it on demo rn. It lets me put alot more pressure onto survivors than i would normally
---
When I first got this game I played survivor and had a few killers take pity on me, so I'm just kinda passing it on now that I'm mostly playing killer lol. I dont do it often because I like to keep the entity happy, but I just look at it like letting your prey mature. I'll kill ya some other time when you've climbed the ranks a bit.
---
Characters going bald has been happening a lot, happening when you pick someone up as well.
---
Curtains, vines, steam/smoke curtains.
---
Line of sight breakers
---
Spine chill, 
---
kindred (if playing solo, but more helpful to your team to coordinate unhooking), 
---
inner strength (good for heals and to help you learn how to find totems), 
---
and maybe dark sense (just got a buff so now see the killer when anyone finishes a gen) or deja vu (to help find gens)
---
Sprint burst or balanced landing as your exhaustion perk instead of kindred also a good choice, I prefer Balanced so I'm not forcing myself to walk around the map to save the sprint burst
---
It's because nurse is really hard to master. She takes actual skill. Because if this most nurses aren't even good. And she's obsolete on console. Spirit is good on every platform and takes no skill to do well.
---
It's clear to see that you got defensive and then you downvoted, twice; all I did was point things out to you, on your posts. That's probably the definition of an inability to handle criticism on reddit. 
---
Wasting your time talking to people post-lobby is like tossing pennies into the ocean hoping to make a buck. You're probably better off watching people play DBD on twitch. Secondly, I feel like you're purposefully misunderstanding something when I said "troll for people", it means to look for people regardless of whether or not there are open SWF groups. 
---
Again, none of these things provide a meaningful alternative to "get better teammates".
---
Same.. while hooking my Xbox will freeze and just exit to main menu.. happened 3 games in a row then I quit out of frustration
---
I thought of a fair solution. Tell me what you think
---
What if instead of smashing buttons or moving the analog for controller. The survivor is required to click on random pattern of buttons. For example, the four movement buttons W A S D, will appear in a random order on screen like S W D D A S and the player just have to click on these buttons without hurting their rest. And the same for controller players.
---
I did this and it fixed the game for me. I rather deal with shitty hair texture than with blurry graphics. I hope they implement a real fix for the destroyed hair on low settings in the future.

Too late, my dad owns Behaviour. You're banned

Who else am I gonna play, Ace??
---
Just mori them.... on second thought maybe not, unless you believe in bad luck lol
---
Who else am I gonna play? Ace??
---
Chumby Huntress! Good art!
---
so it appears that you got gen rushed (hence the silver), got a 2k with a rancor mori (thats 6 points, aka silver, for devout), Didn't get enough hooks to get a high Malicious, you did a lot of hits but they healed up. And last you got max chase, so you did do well, but didn't get the hook pressure which you really needed.
---
Definitely would have been better if you showed the numbers, which would help people to deduct which actions would have helped you to pip.
---
Conclusion: Hook more, don't abandon chase unless the person you are abandoning will waste too much of your time. Go for downs, not injuries.
---
They weren’t, I was on gen and someone ran them over they heard and stood there blocking the entrance.
---
Sure there was nothing I could do but shouldn’t there be?
---
The idea that this is just fine, on top of games getting held hostage it’s surprising this isn’t fixed yet.
---
Do what Stardew Valley does, if I run into you long enough eventually I go through you. 
---
There shouldn’t be a way to just block a doorway, for killer or survivors.
---
Barbecue &amp; Chilli is mostly taken for the Bloodpoints, not every killer gets big benefits from knowing that survivors are on the other side of the map.
---
Ruin you pretty much take on everyone.
---
&gt; *I originally thought doing it with very few teachables was best, so you’re more likely to get the ones you’re looking for.*
---
Yes, that's exactly how it works - you want to get those key teachables *early*.
---
In terms of perks, I know many of the big streamers love the Enduring and Spirit Fury combo If you can make that work for you then by all means run with it. If you can't get the pallets to work then I'd fall back on slowing perks and tracking perks - Pop Goes the Weasel, Whispers, Rancor, Thrilling Tremors, Bitter Murmur, Barbecue &amp; Chilli, and so on.
---
I personally am not a fan of Discordance - when survivors start splitting up, it leaves me a perk down.
---
Since you're using Doc and Legion, I'd argue that Pop Goes the Weasel is the perk most likely to get good results on both - it's a very strong slowdown perk, which means you have more time to secure a kill. This is a very good thing when you're using those particular two killers.
---
Yikes
---
Unless they changed it VERY recently this is not the case, they need to be injured. Do you have any videos or something to show what you're talking about?
---
“What it’s gluten free, I think.”
---
Ah, I didnt know that. It is already back up. :)
---
Tuesday is steam maintenance day so I expect DC's while out of game (from lobby, etc) but not in game... It was either your killers connection or yours, I crashed once yesterday so there's that, the killer can always crash and end everyone's game.
---
I have bad news for you...
---
Which would be a problem if taking the median were the only possible implementation...
---
&gt;Sorry but I’m don’t want to play against people with an unfair advantage, Am I just being a dick by doing this ? **Voice coms is cheating as far as I’m concerned.**
---
This feels like a shitpost rather than a discussion.
---
pepega
---
&gt;Am I just being a dick by doing this ?
---
Nope.
---
Yh I left the obsession a lot bcus he knew I had rancor and would keep coming up to me and stuff I hooked him twice tho
---
They already made it harder.
---
*insert Shrek busting out of the outhouse to represent Jane with Head On*
---
You on console? I have absolutely 0 trouble revealing him on PC, put him in the centre and "feel" for the reveal area, which is sizable, and boom.
---
I notice a lot of idiots try to "out-stare" him instead of breaking LOS, treat him like MM and break LOS, survivors can look over and around stuff with 3rd person camera.
---
Spirit doesn't break the rules so I'm fine with it... Nurse on the other hand just breaks the game and isn't even fun to play
---
:( sorry you feel that way
---
Salt and pepper. Maybe a bib. Hes a messy boy.
---
I haven't crashed with it yet so I'll say yes but hesitantly
---
You meed to eat a Snickers and chill tf out my man, no point being a massive cunt about yoir inability to figure a camera mechanic out.
---
Nuuuuuuu ;-;
---
It's the cat from spine chill! Super model cat
---
Happened to me earlier with Ghostface. Looked really cool!
---
Might as well uninstall the game if you are going to be quitting against every SWF group.
---
"Voice comms is cheating" lmfao I haven´t laughed so hard in weeks.
---
This is how matchmaking works. If you want balanced ranks across all players involved, be prepared to wait for a long time depending on the rank, region and time of the day. 
---
* *Better matchmaking at the expense of longer queue times.*
---
People complain they can't play. 
---
* *Better queue times at the expense of worse matchmaking.*

People complain matchmaking is unfair.

Second one is a tad iffy. Maybe if you're the only one in the trial and the hatch is being a bitch. First is a neat concept though

Two days ago, I decided to play killer, which I hadn't done in over a year. I am rank 20, played nurse cause I thought I should try her. I ended up against a rank 2 4-man and got bmed in end game chat.

I decided to play vommy mummy after that.

I would assume as slow as missing a lunge and hitting a wall
