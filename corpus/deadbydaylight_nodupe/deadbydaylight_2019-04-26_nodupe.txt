I'm glad you like it!

---
Really? I don't have pig but I dislike the whole idea of your ability being less effective if someone is in your terror radius. (Legion's was fine although I would have preferred they eliminate moonwalking in a way that doesn't massively buff borrowed time) 
---

---
I think the few terror radius perks we have or "Only has an effect in your terror radius" are rather "off-meta" besides with Doctor. If the Pig was playing on The Game (Pig's map for oinking out loud) the terror radius going through the floor (although verticality seems like it was reduced quite a bit) would make survivors often be in the terror radius and have the timer stop even if the pig was on another floor. 
---
I understand why Pig can be super strong end-game but I kind of like the aspect of more "Weaker mid-game, stronger endgame" killers, and endgame being this massive climax of the match where it's make it or break it time (Survivors being on the verge of escape, but have to worry about traps or NOED, etc.) 
---
I'd keep the Pig as-is pre-nerf, but maybe have the collapse timer slowed down when a trap is on the head. RBT kills are extremely rare as is.
---
Do you by any chance have a blank template of all of the perk backgrounds?
---
Watch the guides on YouTube. General "How to not suck" guides.
---
I'm really happy that you like it! I wasn't sure about making this a postcard, but now I feel like it's the right thing. :P
---
Aww, thank you so much!
---
I deleted it since If I would of edited it to re-iterate the point, I'd look worse even if the point was correct. Once you're downvoted below a certain threshold, your opinion becomes invalid and thus the rest of the discussion.
---
BHVR have been very good about listening to the community overall. DS, Exhaustion Perks, Self care, Brand New part, pallet vacuum, flashlight changes, etc. have been changed in recent memory.   In fact the end game collapse in general is listening to feedback about how long the DBD endgame can drag on.
---
And every one of those changes have been accompanied by 'the sky is falling game is dying' posts. I remember in 2017 when people said 'good luck getting matches' because people were mad at the Freddy changes.
---
thank god he chose to use berserk then, he's got plenty of base content
---
Huntress is tough on Hadnofun
---
On most killers I don’t feel the need to do this but on the Hag at high ranks I always feel a need to be around 3/4 close generators around a hooked survivor, you’re just too low mobility to get to the other side of the map and I don’t feel a need to go there unless a trap is set off!
---
I've heard of "OhTofu" - they say he's got decent stuff on Youtube.
---
Haddonfield has a lot of narrow corridors that you can take advantage of with your hatchets. The biggest issue I see with it is in the houses, especially when people got Balanced Landing on them.
---
Maybe control will switch when you either drop the survivor, or hook the survivor. But until then, you stay in control
---
Yeah… I wave when I see the killer still near my hung frame (and yet here we go with farming moments)
---
I did not know that, thanks!
---
This looks like how most fan fictions play out
---
BOTH! Try not to main one side!
---
No, Pc. I know the struggle haha
---
good question
---
The truth must be spoken
---
Not gonna lie, his comment was pretty funny.
---
Yeah, would have to otherwise coordinated swf could use this to their advantage.
---
I'd like if the inactive legions on occasion switched lockers too.
---
The power sounds way more fun than feral frenzy.
---
Don't worry, they fixed it.
---
Now even the best CD addons won't save you.
---
I don’t know
---
It’s probably just me but this looks awful. Maybe it’s just my brightness settings.
---
Nah it's literally only Susie's that I've seen do all these things.
---
The Joey's, on the other hand, just exist
---
I SMELL PENNIES
---
Context: This guy has been banned from DBD for awhile now for hacking in Legacy and using a hacked perk was playing PTB and saw him and I guess since PTB is a different environment players can ban evade.
---
Jump scares are fine for me, but being chased fucking scares me (not in dbd tho coz I always look behind me, but FUCK alien isolation)
---
Yea they should make so that it negates the exposed effect for a hit and makes insta downs pit people into the injured state.
---
kaceyUp kaceyWow
---
But, if your close enough to a locker, it is a guaranteed miss and head start against legion.
---
It’s a bug from the hatchets registering twice, once in host pc/console and once on the dedicated server.
---
Half the time survivors are running down a straight line....literally all huntress has to do is keep up
---
No problem! They sell survivor AND killer perk pillows
---
 Cool, now we just have to deal with all of the other unnecessary nerfs to Pig.
---
He's a good start. Also search for Ardetha, DamnnoHTML (Scott Jund). Detailed information from these guys. Just put in DBD Beginners Guide on YouTube and there is a good start for both killer and survivor.
---
Sad but true.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Oh and very very gratifying.
---
Andre the Giant called it the "Finger of Fudge"
---
Yes but being a 110% killer if they get a distance advantage through breaking a pallet they can use the long walls as huge loops.
---
as a survivor main i like this change. no more 300 hour hatch standoffs. now you either find the hatch before the killer, try to outplay him at the gates. or accept defeat. it's way better imo
---
Considering you need 100 levels and you're only at 63, you're not that close
---
"Three hits if button add ons are used"
---
Huh?
---
Goodie, they understand how unnecessary it was.
---
I still have to watch the PTB interview video thing posted today. Probably on there.
---
I mean with Frank's Mixtape and/or moonwalking he was an annoying pice of shit, but without any of those two he isn't really that strong nor annoying
---
He really was in a state of:
---
-with add-ons:Most annoying noob killer ever
---
-without add-ons:slightly better than freddy, but still trash
---
Now he's probably even worse than freddy
---
Awwww … that’s a shame.
---

Half Life 2 forever

Did you not see any of the subreddit after the day people figured out moonwalking, the mending bug, and the growing hate on legion? Like I was primarily upset about legion at first just cause first glance into that list of nerds but since then actually reading the things you can potentially do I’m more in anticipation. A lot of the feeling of legion has been seriously nerfed or removed (multi stabs, fast vault, and 28 stab wounds) and I still don’t like that, but Legion was never really released in a healthy game state to begin. Plus I love playing them but the whole “dc vs legion” thing bled into my regular games and that shit was infuriating.
---
The type of player who would waste their time doing this isn't the type of person that will read your post and go "oh ok yeah, I didn't realize that"
---
Pretty sure they don't give a fuck, and drawing attention to it simply encourages the behavior.
---
it depends on their rank but i think 13-15 goes down to 17
---
Thanks. I'll try to get around eleven or ten then
---
Ah I see, I forget what it’s called but I was fairly certain there was already a perk that caused Scratch marks to last longer as well as spawn closer together, I wanted to make Huntsman’s Instincts stand out more, then again, crouching is supposed to give you some kind of defense against the killers, so I guess it would be too strong if it made marks spawn even when Survivors were crouching
---
Dude that Killer is totally broken
---
I feel sorry for him
---
I like how survivors (who probably never or rarely played killer) downplay the impact of a killer not **ending** a chase. *iTs JuSt OnCe.*
---
When you down a survivor, the following scenarios happen:
---
* One survivor is hooked, which means he isn't working on a gen.
---
* One survivor must come unhook and possibly heal, which means he isn't working on a gen. 
---
* One survivor will be chased by the killer. 
---
This leaves just **one** survivor working on a generator. 
---
When the chase **unnecessarily** extend and there is nothing the killer can do about it, you will have **three** survivors working on a gen or multiple survivors hammering in a single gen.
---
Do survivor mains seriously believe old DS and now MoM aren't OP? Especially MoM since it has wooping **zero** counter play once activated? 
---
I've been playing nothing but survivor since MoM came out and countless times killers lost a game that was practically won because they chose to chase me. You don't even have to be a great looper. Depending on the map and RNG, you just need to know when to throw down pallets and where they are located.
---
PS4 is the worst for it. Just had a rank 5 Trapper camp me then tunnel straight off hook. Used my DS and managed to loop a bit with Dead Hard but then hooked and camped again. Unhooked, tunnelled and killed. Worst thing was he had MAKE YOUR CHOICE.
---
I sent him a message asking why he camped me and what I did wrong as he found me at 4 gens and I stood in a trap straight away. His reply “hahahdhaha you angry?”
---
I switched it off and went on something else. Not worth it this time of night, constant loonies playing lol
---
Not drawing attention to it still encourages their behavior. It's a lose lose. I don't expect that type of person to stop and think, but that doesn't mean I can't or shouldn't vocalize my frustration. I've played for two weeks and that's almost exclusively what I face. It's hell. Especially with my schedule not giving me much time to get out of sweaty ranks
---
Its only the terror radius stopping the timer, we still gotta fight for non killing RBT after gennies are done
---
That dead fuckin stare of the Doc is the worst thing to come out of Canada
---
If MoM isn't OP, neither is NOED. Your move, OP. I predict you will be a hypocrite.
---
Was it after all the gens were done?
---
Oof I'm on ps4. It sucks dude. Like the bugs and glitches I can handle, devs being weird or not doing the best is fine. Players like this make new players not want to play the game. And they enjoy that.
---
survivor lives mattter
---
The MoM effect happens once per match and allows you to survive one fatal blow. It takes 3 hits to charge, and activates on your 4th hit. It is 1 extra hit to down someone once per match.
---
The Button/Pin addons are getting changed so that if you feral frenzy stab and already stabbed person they get a status effect applied on them instead of nothing happening
---
I thought that was because they needed more information from a wider group of people to figure out what was wrong.
---
Carrying on and throwing hissy fits is not the only way, it's just the only thing this subreddit does.
---
Guys he never said anything was for dead by daylight maybe ghost face is getting his own video game?
---
I mean its meant to inspire an actual skin, I would hope they don't just pause the game end burning sequence on the killer and make a skin out of it.
---
Vigil: I'd rather not.
---
Hangman's: I like the second change, but not the first. It takes 12 seconds off of a sacrifice, and 12 seconds is a long time. It's just fine with the second buff.
---
Others: All good!
---
OwO
---
Did they happen to mention more places when they said 'countries like Australia'?  
---
Cuz I'm still a bit worried about the entirety of africa not having a single server.  Even the EU servers are farther away than most games if I used maps right
---
This would literally be one of the first times they've done so lol. Last PTB they made a couple changes, but for almost the entire history of the game, PTB actually meant "here are some changes that will go live in 2 weeks, no matter what"
---
I shouldn’t give a shit about playing fair. Why should I care about the survivors feelings? They’re the enemy I don’t have to go easy on them. That’s bullshit. You don’t ever see survivors  doing less generators and chasing worse because they feel bad for the killer because it’s not how the game works .
---
Well, they got half of it at least. 
---
Yeah, and you know what? I would bet $5 that the only reason that is a new mechanic is because they couldn't code it properly. Since they're blocking generators instead of completing, devs just said "Fuck it, we don't want to add the extra code to make blocking = completed"

The perk MoM allows for one hit. Not all survivors run the same perk, there's no reason to say 4.
---
Every e-sports game out there does it and a lot of them are team based. Having a bad connection griefs your entire team.
---
Yep, like I said to someone else, for most of this game's history, PTB has meant "here are some changes that WILL go live in 2 weeks, no matter what the community thinks". Hell, there have been MAJOR changes that went live without a public test build even! Could you imagine not doing any external testing on major changes to your game?
---
I feel like Wraith flairs are some of the cooler people I've seen on this sub (myself unincluded, of course &gt;.&lt;). Always a great sense of humor and chill attitudes.
---
Collapse is three minutes, doubled if a Survivor is hooked or dying, and only starts once a gate is open. Just make having an RBT slow the timer, and you're good.
---
The other 1% is at least about memes of shirt less myers
---
I even opened the mouth slightly to help him look more excited about fucking over our little oink girl
---
AFAIK it's 3 minutes, six with a trap
---
yea sure... also, noed is not OP because cmoon, its just 1 hit less right? so noed is also balanced:)
---
Haha hes right actually. I mean the fences have to be the last problem for a huntress there but I guess this guy is one of these huntresses ...
---
Or just double it like a downed or hooked guy does.
---
Don’t downvote this man, he’s telling you the truth. The endgame collapse offers Killers absolutely no counter play and is removing what some have. If there’s a minute or less left on the timer you are absolutely going to get camped. It is literally the only thing the Killer can do. It’s stopped being the asshole move and become the smart. 
---
Don’t like the Pig’s traps? Me, I would take thirty seconds and a 25% to get that shit off my head rather than having her sit on my chest like some porcine gargoyle.
---
*He* didn’t. BHVR has hinted at it and so has the owner of the character.
---
I have literally no doubt that it’ll happen. If not now, eventually.
---
This. They already had an easy solution in hand, and instead they decided to fuck this pig by nullifying her traps once the last gen is done.
---
Hahaha look at you, your poor little freak, what the fuck is wrong with you
---
Disco Dance is lowkey my new favorite killer perk after BBQ. You should try using it sometimes ^^
---
As someone who has been playing in NA servers with 150ish MS in Argentina, I must say I want to cry when now that I have Servers in a Neighbour Country (Brasil) with permanent 300 NS...
---
I really hope is just the game connecting me to, I dunno, Asia Pacific, as a result of barely having Players from South America in PTB
---
I ditched my PC for a Playstation years ago in the PS3 days. I was tired of the maintanence. Always having to fix my computer or upgrade everything every few years to keep up with the new gaming tech. I just switched to console because they get a lot of good online games these days and it's simple. And the controllers are comfortable to use. My PS4 has been running healthy for 3 years now and by the time it breaks down Ill probably buy a PS5 lol.
---
Pig being one of my favourite killers to play, this nerf is 100% necessary. If you were to close the hatch and guard the doors then there is literally no way for the survivor to escape. 
---
For those who think this is making the pig a terrible killer they’re wrong. Just adapt and get good.
---
Idk tho I would like for one of us to escape
---
sorry to bug with something off topic, when you're thinking about countries like Australia, please keep South Africa and Africa as a whole in mind too.  
---
but I dont know the stats, so I dont know if we have enough players to warrant a server in SA  
---
this patch looks really fun btw, you guys really did great work
---
&gt; I don't know who the hell telling these players  
---
Why do so many gaming communities think *everyone* reads the forums and follows community metas? I bet most players, especially at high ranks, don't even know there IS a convention let alone what the "right" thing to do is.
---
&gt; who the hell telling these players that waving your arms means nothing 
---
Sleeper agent killers obviously
---
No I understand the intent it’s just my comment on the photo.
---
I don't see that much camping past yellow ranks tbh, it's definitely a problem that needs more solutions but it's an exaggerated issue.
---
That is a pretty good outfit like you said. Reminds me of when Ash first came out and I'd get camped so they could check my character and new outfit out lol.
---
Im thinking about it like you just downed someone and you notice their active trap is now inacive. You can potentially get two downs here as you know someone else is around, most likely at the closest box or hiding around the corner. Even if they get the trap off in time, you will now know exactly where they are assuming you are near one of your boxes at the time.
---
&gt;She would be strong, but she still wouldn't threaten the current top tier killers. It would not be a bad thing to have some variation in who the top killers are. 
---
They will more likely nerf the top tier killers to bring them more inline rather than buff killers into the top tier. That's just the hard truth.
---
&gt;I feel like they should've at least seen how strong she was before nerfing her.
---
They don't want another Legion on hand where there is massive DCs against a broken/unfair character. Leave no doubt about it, end game Pig would've been a much stronger cheese build for killers.
---
Thatd be pretty niche. Sounds good on paper but that's more of a worse combination of perks that already exist, except they'd only activate when the gates are opened, instead of when they are powered.
---
There was barely a chase though. I'm rank 15. And I'm new. And I was the first one. I ran, got hit, got stuck on a rock on the hill, hit again, downed, camped and slapped. There was nothing for the killer to vent over.
---
Nerf her
---
That’s dumb, thanks anyway.
---
No, there's no reason for it. Just fix matchmaking, players shouldn't be able to choose the ranks of their opponent.
---
Mmm, depends on what you mean by camp. I see a lot of killers pseudo-camp, but not face camp. Pseudo-camping is p common in this game, sadly. I know why it happens, but it's still a shame.
---
It used to be a simple 4k, now it's a double pip.
---
Here’s hoping they’re considering it and plan on implementing it in the final patch. But I do not want to see the system on the PTB right now to ever see live release. It is *not* an acceptable solution, even as a stopgap.
---
Imagine being this fuckin stupid
---
Yeah, I guess
---
I agree like who the fuck do they think they are healing and shit you're supposed to die!!!
---
I'd run unbreakable for when this happens. 
---
As for being chased the whole timer, would it not make sense to be chased for maybe 20 seconds, and check both doors as you're chased?
---
Yes...me im the non camping killer lol
---
Just wait until it hits live. Every ptb from every game is known for having potatoes for players.
---
Ok yeah if you guys are rank 15 and there was no chase it's just some dick preying on new players, I'm sorry that happened to you
---
I don't think it's exaggerated when it's almost every game a lot of players have
---
The sudden fear when you are the only survivor and there are 5 gens left
---
I might run bamboozle just to make it feel nice to vault again and as an anti-loop when out of feral
---
Hell yeah it is
---
It sound pretty good to me. The gates power and you do everything faster. Idk many useful ways other than that to help people when the gates power. We already have adrenaline. Maybe a perk to pull you off the hook but we already have one for that too.
---
I don't think they actually believe that it isn't a problematic perk, but if you played mostly survivor, would *you* want to give up a tool this strong? A lot of players just see balance from their preferred gameplay mode's perspective.
---
I don’t know what this means but thanks 😂💞
---
HAHA
---
I never strike survivors while they’re on the hook, unless they teabag me, then I strike them with joy and laugh while doing so.
---
o h. Thanks tho haha 😂💞
---
Thanks 😂💞
---
Yeah that's a tough one. I think it's funny that we all make up rules for the killer to play by, but it does suck when you get the short end of that stuff.
---
hmm, good point, I'm thinking maybe the surv being carried first is dropped to the ground. The swapped out Legion then runs off to a locker.
---
Fair. But if it was Half Life Doc should've had a crowbar...
---
ash rating 100% accurate, absolute cunts the lot of em
---
how is it their advantage? somebody is still getting downed/potentially hooked.
---
Well I am glad there has been improvement then.
---
Hi
---
Im not saying these things. Ive saying what people.messeged me on ps4 and how things are 1 sided. One side always thinks the other is broken unfair bs
---
Amen to that
---
Exactly.  I have really been thinking about making the jump to killer also.  I am just so terrible at it. Lol!
---
&gt;Can you be banned for changing icons?
---
Very unlikely but not impossible. Devs won't go out of their way to ban you for that but if for some random reason EAC bans you, devs won't lift it (at least thats what they say).
---
&gt;always
---
Sometimes
---
I HATE TO SAY IT BUT IT WAS NERFED. IM SUPER GLAD FOR IT BECAUSE IT MAKES EVERYTHING IN THE GAME LESS SHITTY, BUT THE PERK ITSELF IS OBJECTIVELY WORSE THAN IT WAS BEFORE. 
---
AGAIN IM OKAY WITH IT, BUT SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA TRY TO SAVE SOMEONE BEFORE THEY DIE ON HOOK AND SOMETIMES IT DOESNT WORK OUT. 
---
I WISH THEYD ACTUALLY JUST MAKE IT EASIER TO GET STACKS IN GENERAL - ITS WAY TOO HARD TO GET 4 STACKS CONSISTENTLY, ESPECIALLY SINCE KILLERS GET 4 STACKS BY PLAYING THE GAME NORMALLY. THIS IS A GOOD CHANGE, BUT HOPEFULLY THEY CONTINUE TO TWEAK IT
---
Is Ohio close enough to Montreal ( east of Canada) so I’ll have green ping?
---
*cough*
---
Missed opportunity with the quote. It should have been switched to "Smart asses get served. The Legion sees to that."
---
that is true but how about possibly an addon or offering that prevents being injured from it? Since we are getting new options for locker hopping like that new perk, and we've got quick and quiet, why not make it an addon that prevebts us being injured if we are grabbed from a locker? Its a hard thing to work out since you get injured if grabbed vaulting over pallets and from gens too and that definitely makes no sense. The lockers are a balancing thing but vaulting and off gens? Wheres the balance there?
---
It hurts your ego when you're found in a locker
---
So your on death hook, your friend isn't... he can do it to save you...
---
And repeat... throw in some insta heals and it would be no fun to play.
---
Jesus, what's with all of you all being shitty? I literally was trying to be nice and everyone in here is like "how fucking dare you be nice; fuck you!" 
---
I didn't expect a gg back or anything but he could've just left the message on read and not replied for fucks sake
---
Normally I’d agree with these sorts of things but as a Laurie main, I understand how wholly insignificant I am and just do my best to get me and my teammates out alive 😤😤
---
They already have those, although they're strictly for playing certain killers.
---
Bamboozle doesn't work on pallet vaults.
---
It’s not a fair deal then. I think I speak for most Killer mains when I say we’d rather have nothing. Because we’re not really getting anything, are we? There are more nerfs than solutions.
---
The pig chages are being reverterd they said that in Q&amp;A
---
Really like the galaxy background in the back. I've never been a big fan of colored perks but I might look at these ones.
---
I DONT LOVE ALL OF THE CHANGES, BUT GODDAMN THE CHANGES TO DEEP WOUND MADE ME SO HAPPY I ALMOST BLEW A LOAD. NOTHING WAS SHITTIER THAN A MOONWALKING LEGION OR A LEGION THAT FOUND YOU WHILE YOU WERE MENDING SO YOU COULDNT EVEN TRY TO RUN AWAY
---
Link?
---
Game ending ginger snaps is the official name. Change my mind
---
Time for fifty low effort memes all about the same thing!
---
*Earrape race car noises with a bell for a horn*
---
GOD DAMNIT STOP DISCONNECTING WHEN YOU GET HIT ONCE! IM ABOUT TO PERMANENTLY DELETE THIS GAME BECAUSE FUCKS LIKE YOU SUCK THE FUN RIGHT OUT OF IT! GO PLAY FORTNITE YOU WHINY BITCH!
---
They do?
---
I’m using it as a serious and non serious thing. If I was fully serious I’d just say smurf/deranking

there's rituals for survivors
---
Lmfao your comment cracks me up! Yah wait till he sees 700ping lobbies, he will have a myocardial infarction and die on the spot!
---
They do. They’re the daily... something or others that pop up when you open the game. They can be killer or survivor oriented.
---
Same here! I'm so bad that I get embarrassed to even try.
---
&gt; People ASKED for this. 
---
WRONG. Survivors asked for this. By your moronic logic, the Freddy nerfs were justified because survivors asked for nerfs. 
---
&gt;No not really. The end game collapse is basically exactly the same as the current end game goes,
---
Really now? So, being able to not grab them when they leave via the Hatch isn't biased at all? A 3 minute timer wasn't enough for the twats and the timer needed to be slowed down when someone is downed or on a hook? A 3 minute timer when THE GATES ARE OPEN. Not to mention that when the hatch is closed now the gates are available, which means that if you aren't running Billy/Nurse or the gates aren't close to each then you're fucked. They're getting away via gate. 
---
&gt;I kid you not, the game has progressively gotten easier and easier for killers since release
---
And I stopped reading right here. More nonsense from twats claiming they main killer. The same exact people who claim they mained killer but defending pre-nerf DS. Did you suddenly forget that they introduced Mettle of Man? Or buffed Borrowed Time yet again? Or how about the fact that there's still no secondary objectives, SWF still breaks the game, and gens still get done way too quickly? Did you conveniently forget this? I'm willing to bet you didn't and are just assuming a contrarian position because unfortunately Behavior is incompetent and listen to twats like you who complain about literally everything and live in some bizarro world reality where killers are OP, the balance is fine, and survivors never do anything wrong and never act toxic in any way whatsoever. 
---
We're done here.
---
People get so pissed and salty when killers patrol or camp a hooked survivor. It's expected.
---
Preach. You're probably gonna get downvoted because this subreddit is filled with survivor mains who unironically think killer is OP, but no one knows the killer struggle.
---
🍿
---
Let me tell you the question that drives Killers to madness: “Does this guy actually know what he’s doing or is he just wasting pallets?”
---
Umm I have red rank killers who camp went against a camping red rank 2 wraith today.. blew my mind
---
440 hours, not so many :/
---
If you don't mind maining a killer worse than Freddy, go for it.
---
When wraith facecamps hook in cloak. &amp;#&amp;@;#^@(@^#&amp;
---
A lot of them do anyway
---
Kiss her on the nose and ask her if she likes Olive Garden. 
---
If that doesn't work, give her a hug and flowers.
---
If that fails, give her a miniature Dwight in a locker and a mini generator as a last ditch effort to show her that you care.
---
When the killer finds you in a locker, he's in a very commanding physical position. He's not chasing you trying to take desperate little swipes at your back. You're in a person-sized box with the killer blocking your only exit. He could kill you on the spot and there's nothing you could do about it.
---
But that doesn't make for very exciting gameplay, so BHVR decided to be generous and just say, you're injured now :)
---
Its kind of weird how it feels too fast when youre a sole survivor. I just had 3 killed themselves on hook and killer found the hatch.
---
I think they would've documented such change
---
Just play killer! Survivor mains are never BM, promise.
---
If you're talking about pig, well your completly wrong. The RBT is now faster, if anything is a buff.
---
Or we can all just accept that people are cunts on the internet and move on.
---
Well because, unlike you, I got a little red circle with a number in it telling me to check
---
Most people that do it are actually being camped in my experience. So the vast majority. It's nice of TC to put it out there for those out of the loop. We gotta do what we can to communicate in a team based game without in-game voice chat.
---
Susie is Claudette for killers.
---
Soooo.... legion's bleed is paused in terror radius, but a trap that literally eliminates you from the game isn't. Interesting.
---
Start to play nurse and master it, game breaker killer, no one will tbag you again....
---
Rip those seethrough tiles. Now we gotta run graphics settings on low like peasants
---
To those that say "It's PTB, it'll never get pushed out to live without feedback!!!"
---
Might I remind you of the crap that got pushed out to live that we've had to deal with, like the pallet and flashlight stuns that didn't require timing? 
---
That too was in PTB and got pushed to live
---
Combo time...
---
in a drawn out match the killer wins everytime because they can swing infinitely, but the piece of wood will never come back when broken
---
For some reason there are a bunch of higher level survivor SFW teams staying at the lower ranks. Not sure if it is intentional or if the ranking system is just that bad right now. 
---
If you aren’t having fun, put the game down for a bit and come back to it. Play some free games on GameJolt or stuff you bought on Steam that you never got around do playing. 
---
It will still be here when you get back.
---
Whats your typical killer build and what killer do you use?
---
The only advantage is communication not the perks. There is no logical way to nerf swf and if the devs decided to, this game would surely die when pretty much a huge chunk of surv is a swf
---
I would say a minute to get your trap off and escape is still a fair amount of time. Not a guaranteed chance, of course, but at some point the Pig’s trap needs to mean certain death. Otherwise her power is meaningless. The alternative — survivors walking out of trials with a death trap attached to their head with zero consequences — is just as absurd.
---
Amen to that sister.
---
The terror radius stopping the timer is the only problem I had with the nerf. I don’t play end game piggy, but I do play impossible skill check pig and the terror radius stopping the timers would really fuck me over.
---
I made that mistake when I played League for the first time. Never went back to the game after the shit show I got for saying that :/.
---
Imo even if they are terrible at the game but have fun and make it fun for the chat i.e making jokes etc i consider that as a good streamer too
---
&gt;Well once activated it doesn't have any, but you can do what I do and bring a Mori when you see an Ash similar to what we killers used to do when DS came out. (Back when it was an obsession perk but Mori's were still instant and didn't require a hook)
---
&gt;Hit ash twice, 2 tokens, he goes down. Hook him. He gets unhooked, try and down him (He gets a third token but MOM won't proc) again and Mori him. No MoM.
---
I never play Ash but I use MoM on Meg, Dwight and Feng. Good luck with that strategy.
---
Hell, should have had at least 4 Servers in the US alone... All the servers filled up and would send you to the nearest one with room, so for me it was either EU or Brazil...
---
They changed some Legion stats and restored the pig’s RBT timer. They restored the gate opening times. They are listening. 
---
They may not be making all the changes we want, but they are stating they are open to suggestions and are adjusting things.
---
It's almost like that's what Reddit has been doing, giving massive amounts of NEGATIVE feedback about the change.
---
3 hrs? Damn, you need to up your game and get out of those ranks.
---
plague, she's like level 8 so obvious not the most optimal build. It's just that when I first started playing I easily got to rank 6-7ish with spirit and I have no idea what else could be causing it other than rank fuckery
---
I'm trying. Is my frustration a bit more understandable tho now
---
BHVR has shown in the past this is the only way to affect real change with them though. You have to be extremely and constantly vocal.
---
What the fuck Behavior?
---
Ooh fun
---
Dude, the guy who owns the Ghostface character specifically told this guy he can announce whatever the surprise is, and this guy and him are pretty good friends. I’m not saying it’s 100% but it seems pretty likely.
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
Ty, will do!
---
To be fair a lot of these games are also on dedicated servers so the player is more responsible for making sure their connection is stable for such activities. In a game like DBD where it’s peer to peer and sometimes there is a possibility that you simply won’t connect to the host, it would be too much to ban people for being victims for a flaw in the system. With dedicated servers coming in this problem should lessen and ideally should be cease, but until then it’s a necessary evil we will have to deal with.
---
Oh, thanks lol. I just want to know what the community wants specifically to try and cater to everyone.
---
Killer closed hatch starting the collapse. and both gates were closed.
---
The clock is always working against survivors too. Lunge is the killer's pallet vacuum. You also kinda proved my point, bringing up the "much needed nerfs". I agree that survivors needed (and still need) nerfs, but so do killers. The devs have made so many bad design choices that lead to so many toxic playstyles. So many people in this game, especially this subreddit, act like the game is geared towards the other side, when its actually just shit design for both sides. The only issue is, survivors are the only ones getting hit with baseline (non ability/item/perk) nerfs. There is bad game design, just stop pretending its on one side or the other, when it's actually both.   
---
Also, did you really bring up OP/nonfun perks, as though it's a survivor only occurrence? o.O
---
I prestiged Michael this past weekend and decided to use up all my mirrors first. God, that was a good time. This game’s actually a lot of fun when survivors are legitimately afraid of you. Just wish I had monitor and abuse to get the full effect.
---
If waving my arms scares the killer away than I am plenty fine with that. Its not like I want him there anyway. Then you stop waving.... Its also a good way of saying fuck you to the killer like "camp me my friends are gonna do the gens!".
---
That's ok though, because even if you blow up a gen the killer won't hear it, sound notifications are FUBAR.
---
Gotta milk that 15 minutes somehow, I suppose.
---
k.
---
Botany Knowledge + Emergency Medkit with Abdominal Dressings and Gel Dressings says hello. Fast enough to heal in a chase and can heal 3 different times with all those times combined lower than one Self-care heal.
---
Found out that they still have them it just doesn't show up right on mobile
---
God damnit
---
Boil over and dance with me should have had their names switched. Each name fits the other park's effects much better.
---
Yeah, I do a quick little half raise to say "ok come get me now."
---
&gt; True, like use a killers special ability on a survivor
---
That's exactly what the daily he's complaining about is
---
I threw a hatchet aimed at a roof on the other side of a white picket fence, and it still hit the fence.
---
One of my closest friends has autism dude, he's also really smart. I never said that autism makes you dumb, I said people call themselves and others autistic so much to the point of where we've grown numb to it, pretty much saying you're right and that it's wrong. I also said that there is no reason for you to be offended, as nothing mean or hurtful was said to you, you just felt the need to swoop in and put your nose where it doesn't belong.
---
[Here, this should help.](https://youtu.be/zB-A1gqNXFg)
---
Then try to open the gates. If they down you and don’t pick you up, then that could be considered grieving or holding up the game. You can report it. Nothing may happen because there is a time limit now. 
---
I understand your issue, but at least it is only 3 minutes max for bleeding out.
---
That sucks, but remember that this is the PTB and people want to see the new animation. It won’t likely keep happening in the real games. 
---
I would suggest making a suggestion in the official PTB forum. Maybe they can integrate it. Heck, I would like to see that if someone disconnects it plays the animation and counts as a hook.
---
Gates are back up to 20 btw. Also, yes the team did screw up. Which is why I was the last living survivor.  (life of a solo player i guess). Timer wasn't started by winning it was started by the killer closing the hatch followed by 2 minutes of bming.
---
Well on PTB, if you're carrying a survivor And End Game Colapse ends, they are freed from your grasp and die normally
---
Is somebody dumb if a word means something else in their language? I'm sorry but if you're waving around and expect me to come for you don't hold your breath. Because EVERYONE I know considers it to mean the opposite of you. 
---
Chances are Ill come anyway but not until the very last second as a ditch effort to check the situation out.
---
It clearly Mr. Rogers in a blood stained sweater
---
I did this once and it was hilarious, big oof for the huntress
---
WHEN I UNLOCK THE GATE AND DECIDE TO SAVE A PLAYER. WHILE RUNNING AWAY THEY DROP A PALLET ON ME AND I GET HIT. I SHOULD HAVE FUCKING LEFT YOU TO HANG!!!
---
you can't overrate extra bloodpoints
---
these are making me so sad:( poor girl.
---
I love toxic assholes that think the problem is with only one side of the community. They make the community so great.
---
Or have to face a swf group
---
ALL BLOOD POINTS COSTS SHOULD BE HALVED BECAUSE THIS GRIND IS JUST UNREASONABLE FOR FUCKS SAKE!
---
ALSO THERE ARE NOW SO MANY PERKS THAT THE SHRINE SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO SIX PER WEEK!
---
I agree. Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. It’s strong enough to discourage tunnelling (a very unfun mechanic) whilst not doing hurting killers that decide to spread the love.
---
Lol no they haven't. Maybe back when they had a publisher calling the shots but ever since they split off they have been very responsive to feedback. Yall just kick and scream and escalate things.
---
Put Ghost face in and have his ability be he calls the survivors cell phones, giving away their position.
---
flirtatious oink
---
I would like to add that one mod said you shouldn’t get banned for that (because they’re not actively checking who’s altered those files since it’s “harmless”), BUT if for some reason the EAC detects it, you could get banned and they won’t be able to help you get the acc back. I’m saying this because yes, the EAC can detect those alterations (even though there hasn’t been any problem so far). The possibility is there, so use them at your own risk.
---
You can counter mom with nurse, legion, micheal, devour hope, noed, hatchets, plague, anything thays not a m1
---
It can be. You really gotta nail the mind game on that loop, which can be difficult depending on how good the Survivor you're up against is.
---
It honestly feels like your being punished for playing good when you run from the killer. They are designed to be able to catch up, but because you are good and outwit them, you lose your chance at escaping when they have NOED or catch up with Bloodlust and face camp because they are upset. I understand the need for a kill, but its stupid and needw fixing.
---
I wish kindred was just a free perk for everyone honestly...
---
Behavsaw decided to give her a little mercy is all, the game isn't over yet...
---
Or just make it not have a hitbox on DC's.
---
&gt;Waving when camped gives information to the killer.
---
And what is the killer to do with this information, exactly
---
I didn't play leigon much, but when I did I used cooldown addons and would frenzy close as I could for the second hit and get em the old fashioned way. So this update isn't even gonna effect my playstyle and I love it.
---
Exactly
---
"Maybe back when they had a publisher" - So for most of this game's life.  
---
These are the devs who "fixed the bug" that meant you had to actually time your flashlight and pallet saves. That's why people get annoyed with them. That kind of attitude towards balance.
---
That's amazing! Love it!
---
As a West Australian i will be fine on Singapore but for the majority of players who live in the east feelsbadman
---
Nurse has 2 seconds of fatigue time because it's harder to land a blink strike than it is to run up and stab some one. Chill out, Frank.
---
I'VE ALREADY WATCHED EVERY EPISODE OF ZERO PUNCTUATION.

the buttons were changed i believe to give status effects now tho.
---
3 dislikes already, shame.
---
smh
---
Beads on spirit have no counter. Well it has. Either DCing or dont do gens.
---
I wish I could add these on PS4
---
Probably just a coincidence?? I’m not really sure what you’re trying to imply.
---
Get good baby killer
---
&gt;You can counter mom with nurse, legion, micheal, devour hope, noed, hatchets, plague, anything thays not a m1
---
You can try to prevent it but once activated, there is no counter. 
---
Here is an example:
---
Imagine if Devour Hope wasn't a totem. Survivors could prevent it by not getting hooked or unhooking before the killer had a chance to leave.
---
You wouldn't know about the perk before it was too late and once activated, there wouldn't be a counter. But for balance purpose, Devour is a totem and survivors can destroy it before the killer even has a chance to get its money worth. 
---
As for the "counters" you listed, even Billy and Huntress can't reliably prevent stacks the entire time and Nurse is already fixed on PTB. 
---
NOED? I suppose you are joking at this point.
---

honestly yea, please suggest these to behavior.  Like you said, half his addons are basically worthless now.  I really do think with the current changes they can make him a really fun killer
---
Found the toxic Claudette.
---
Only reason i take DS now is because i get farmed by pubs alot in solo que .
---
DBD = DEAD BY DAYLIGHT?? MORE LIKE DBD = DC BECAUSE DNURSE !   !
---
Honestly, what I really want is the ability to close doors as a Killer. Make it clear to survivors that if you open that door and walk away it might not be that way when you get back.
---
No unique traits? Have you never seen the movies, or any of the fan concepts for him? He has plenty they could use. I really don't think BHVR cares that much about the killer's weapon, either.
---
*sits in corner awkwardly cause some how wins almost every single game on that map*
---
Vanilla paste but it's actually survivor pudding
---
its easy to get headshots when the survivor drops a pallet. you HAVE to aim up to make it past the pallet. and its a headshot every time. so headshots dont require skill
---
Leaf
---
Where do you get stuff like that
---
the hatchet hit box is bigger than the huntress.
---
What about Nurse blinking.  
---
jesus christ devs...
---
I'd like that too. Maybe some ability to damage the control matrix that forces the door closed. Most killers would punch it, hard, Halo Style.
---
I somehow have managed to completely miss all of your previous giveaway posts until now, what a bummer :'(
---
These are amazing! Does it cost you much to be sending so many away for free?
---
THIS LITERALLY NEEDS TO BECOME A PERK THAT CAN ONLY BE RUN WITH LEGIONS NEW OUTFIT
---
he throws you on his back extra tough. Look at trapper. He has all these spikes and rods coming out of his body. That has to hurt being thrown on that crap
---
No, I've been using it and just honestly dont see the point. I play hag, and between running nurses and using the pussy willow addons, I can always see the survivor. Bbq causes me to look around the map and in-line for someone instead of finding a few scratch marks or seeing someone nearby.
---
Why would I wave to say "come get me"? Its kind of implied I want to live.... waving means "attention don't come! See me panic?? Its a trap!"
---
I can’t find the pillows on the store :/
---
“Always assume we’re in the worst timeline, that way you’ll always be pleasantly surprised to find yourself in only the third worst.”- Definitely Some Super Famous and Smart Historical Figure, and Not the Ramblings of an Idiot
---
I only meant time increase if its changed to last gen. Other than that, I fully agree that it should be decreased. Way too much time.
---
i mean no its not. not in red ranks. Every killer has BBQ and the only time they "might" stay is if they seen no one with it. Even then it could mean everyone went in a locker.
---
I think it might be Michael Myers.
---
The bravery JUMPED out!
---
The Pig is way higher skillcap than the Nurse anyway and gets significantly less reward for it.
---
i mean if it were a killer dependant thing that would be cool but the injured status should then only be applied once the player is on the killers shoulders instead of as soon as you open the locker
---
Mom will only get activated after being hit 3 times, at fourth it will activate. If its such a big issue you can play 1 shot characters, legion or charactera that injure survivors without a m1
---
But genes were.
---
That doesn't make it right for the killer to down me and stare at me for two minutes instead of trying to hook me.
---
They just hit the lever with their weapon, unfortunately it’s not a new animation.
---
I completely agree with that, except that a trap doesn't necessarily go on at the start of the 2 mins. A guaranteed kill cos you caught someone with a full minute left is a bit rough. That said there's nothing stopping you camping that person regardless so it really just changes HOW they die, not IF they die.
---
Same. Even though I find farming frustrating, at least I get some satisfaction from stabbing the killer in the back for capitalizing on it.
---
Legion really isn’t anything like Ghostface tho. The only thing they share is they’re more than one person and they wear masks. That’s it.
---
It's really hard to say, which is sad because I really like some of the ones I've seen.  
---
I've got a feeling they'd be *willing* to ban people for altering the game with code in any way though, especially if it messed with anything they have licensed.   
---
Personally, I wouldn't do the icons, even the pretty ones, because I wouldn't want them to mess with the perk. For instance, if it's supposed to give me a notification and light up, I wouldn't want it to remain solid.   
---
Just my thoughts though.
---
That’s honestly just specific to hag. Some killers don’t benefit as much from the vision, like hag or trapper. It’s god tier on killers that do, huntress and spirit come to mind immediately for me.
---
Who am I kidding we all just want bloodpoints xd
---
I thought it was pretty creative - not a typical juke but there was so much hype when it happened on his stream. Guess not everyone loves it as much as I do though!

There's a word for this: extortion.  
---
Too cringe for me, i'll just wait.
---
I see your point... but you gotta remember something. Survivors are also able to get back up and run around after taking chainsaws to the back, and being hooked through the chest.   
---
I mostly only use lockers to avoid being seen by BBQ and nothing else since killers run Whispers so often. But if jumping into a locker meant you don't go into an injured state, it's a tad OP since being saved means you're fully healed. Then teams of players would always hop in a locker and set up for a good save every time the killer is around, and you get away scott free. Whereas if you're injured and you get saved, the killer only has to hit you once now instead of twice. Also, if you did get away uninjured, it means you can hop into another locker and do the process over again.
---

---
dude are you mentally challenged? Its up to 4 times. 4 surviviors. Stop thinking the game is you vs the killer. Its you and 3 others vs the killer. It all adds up.
---
Have you ever had someone grab you by the throat, lift you clean off your feet with your neck bearing the entire weight of your body, and then hurl you onto their shoulder with such force that you somehow land on your stomach?  I haven’t, but I imagine that if the whiplash didn’t immediately snap my fucking pencil-neck it would probably hurt, or at least knock the wind out of me.
---
Also, makes a lot of sense for Trapper and Spirit, who have sharp pointy shit sticking straight out of their shoulders.  Also Doctor, who can passively electrocute people near (and presumably on) him.
---
Wow... noed and hes a dbag
---
And they're knife wielding chase killers. I mean, there are parallels
---
No lol I was finishing my other fanart
---
Obviously, you can. Use common sense, and just don't do it
---
He doesn't use it normally it's just for this troll strat
---
I've literally never been fully moried. I dc every fucking time. its the stupidest fucking thing in this game
---
Yeah, it's me (1 MoM) with 3 others (who might not have MoM) vs the killer.
---
i think the patch made it so you cant body block the basement because of the new changes
---
This is by far, one of the best fan-made killer ideas that I've read about in a long time. Maybe debuff the perks, as everybody else pointed out, but all-in-all a great idea.
---
its just me being comical my guy. It literally makes no sense but its just the way the game works.
---
Susie blends into the enviroment, making it so survivors have a hard time seeing her?
---
Could we use this on PlayStation?
---
nah it would have nothing to do with any sort of head shot mechanic, I believe it has to do with hatchets being originally client-side (for killer), and being moved to server-side (for dedicated servers) without proper optimization (laggy hatchets cause survivors to instantly get hit twice
---
No, at the very beginning of the game for me, but I dont think it matter at what point in the game it is
---
I am a killer main. Wraith and myers. And as I said, it’s not OP.
---
Upvote for that positive attitude!
---
This as well. Since the collapse offers Killers no counter play except to jam up survivors you’re likely going to see a lot more endgame camping. It’s no longer a douchebag move, just a smart one. Personally, I would rather take the minute and a 25% chance to get the trap off than have the Pig sit on my chest like some porcine gargoyle. 
---
Also, it needs to be said that at some point the Pig’s power needs to mean certain death, otherwise her power is meaningless. The alternative — that survivors be allowed to just walk out of a trial with a death trap on their head with zero consequences — is just absurd.
---
About 75% of the people I know enjoy streams with high chat interaction, and a streamer who is just having fun being there! Everything else - killer/survivor main, toxicity level, salt level, survive with viewers / kyf, etc. - varies depending on the person. Just have fun with it and be yourself!
---
&gt;They will more likely nerf the top tier killers to bring them more inline rather than buff killers into the top tier. That's just the hard truth.
---
We're talking about the same developers right? Nurse has been the strongest killer in the game since release and not much has been done to bring Billy down. I don't think this is something that's going to happen, and even if it did, there's still nothing wrong with buffing weaker killers.
---
Also they clearly had this solution ready and planned. They could've released her untouched and then patched in this change if it got too oppressive, which I have doubts about.
---
Legion and Huntress are feral. That's more than some dudes that get away with murder by swapping out a costume. Leatherface is the same category, unswayed by pity or emotion. The guys from scream were pathetic kids, compared to what we are supposed to believe legion is.
---
She can see if it's activated or not is what I mean.

Being 100% genuine, I've been calling it disco dance since Legion's after mispronouncing it, realising what I actually said and being happier with the name I came up with
---
Also yes, I constantly use Disco dance, such a good information/detection/anti-gen rush tool
---
No I unfortunately don't have Plague yet, but that's a good idea.
---
I use Distressing, Unnerving, Lullaby and Sloppy Butcher.
---
No, there is no universally accepted meaning for waving your arms. I'd say about 25% do it for "come get me", 30% do it for "killer is near" and 45% do it out of boredom.
---
“Legion flair”
---
HEY AT LEAST YOU GET FUCKING MATCHES. I'M LOVING MY 8 YEAR LOBBY TIMES WHEN I JUST WANT TO PLAY SOME FUCKING TRAPPER.
---
That I misunderstood. If don't realize you said you were being slugged or just chased. That is annyoing as shit for sure. I don't think you can do much about it though. For me if that happens Injust go make a sandwich or take a shit lol.
---
Drawn out match? You mean 5 minute games?
---
I thought we were all in the bloodpoint grind together? Amazing to see how you miss out on extra points lol
---
That’s...not what Ghostface does. Legion killed one dude together, Ghostface has killed more than 40 people all together. If that’s not evil I’m not sure what you’d consider evil. Also, they’re not “kids”, all of the Ghostfaces were older than all the Legions.
---
I mean, you move more, but it takes much more time. This means it's a nerf when chasing, but a minor buff when just traveling, but no one uses frenzy to travel.
---
God the image didn't load and I thought it was another nerf post judging from the title lmao. Very cute artwork anyway :)

All those perks are shitty lol

MY FAVOURITE IS ALL THE PURPLE KILLER OFFERINGS. NEARLY ALL OF THEM DO FUCKING NOTHING, AND EVEN THE ENTITY KNOWS TO AVOID THEM ON THE BLOODWEB. IT FUCKING FORCES YOU TO TAKE THEM OVER BROWN ADD ONS EVERY TIME.
---
3 years later and I still laugh at the stupidity.
---
Pretty sure that's not right
---
Fix freddy
---
Where would I submit those?
---
thanks!
---
Please tell me how to counter whispers in a 1v1.
---
no once you are hooked you are clearly injured but before that you are not....like i said just before remlve the injured/dying state from survivors being pulled out/off of objects and instead give exhaustio  and remove sprinting for 30 seconds or so that way if the killer grabs ylu from whatever and drops you you arent just left on the floor, or if you get off his shoukder before hook you still have a chance. It just doesnt make sense at all in its current state but of course once you are hooked you are definitely injured
---
Do it for the killers that DC as well.
---
They have no idea how to play their own game, so they can't look at changes with the same relevance as someone who actually knows how all these mechanics work. May as well have some trained monkeys doing these buffs/nerfs.
---
I thought this was gonna be a Kate body pillow. Disappointed, son.
---
Amazing
---
A lot of negativity on this post. I don't think it's too far fetched. I could definitely see him being a character.
---
While I think to ask, what does pointing at the killer generally mean? Is it a taunt or something? Can never figure this out xD
---
After 3+ years of playing - I think I've been face camped two games in a row.
---
Lmao. The perk is borderline dogshit. Nerfing it would make it useless. Might aswell just delete it.
---
Jack?
---
Super like
---
The Terror-Radius Bear Trap is already gone, so really the only “nerd” currently is that her Traps don’t really work when the Exit Gates are powered up.
---
Why so salty? Lmao, you came in here angry as hell my guy.
---
This sub is a bunch of cry babies it makes me sick
---
dont move to australia... 3-400ms &amp; you can't even change what server your on.
---
You sound like an older person telling younger kids how times were tougher back then and therefore shouldn't complain. "Oh you think your life is hard because you can't afford a house or education despite working 8+ hours a day, 6 days a week? Well back in my day we would go fight a war regardless of whether we believed we were in the right or wrong, so quit your yappin!"
---
Were things harder back then? Yes. Should we shut up and accept how things are because it was harder back then? No. I've played killer and survivor about half and half since June 2017 (so I managed to experience insta-BNPs and no-hook moris), and I do believe there is room for improvement on for both sides.
---
Dogshit? It's literally the strongest tracking perk in the game lmao
---
Doesn’t matter anyway. Been playing the PTB and I still have 200 ping games 🙄
---
Ppl are mad because a lot of pigs waited until the last gen pop to trap people
---
Why nerf in quotes? It's literally a nerf. And the terror radius kinda sucked, but it wasn't what people were upset about.
---
Freaking OHIO
---
Nurse and Spirit have entered the chat
---
Lol.
---
Yes!  I've done this for a while.  Spread this everywhere.
---
And double skill check addons?
---
Actually, why are Killers allowed to use perks at all when egc starts? Using perks is clearly too strong during egc.
---
Because it’s not really a “nerf”.
---
If you have Traps left when the gates are open, that’s your own problem. Getting a trap placed on you when the gates were open was pretty much a death-sentence for Survivors. Any smart person would leave the Trapped Survivor and hope for the best, I honestly do think this change is logical.
---
uhh why does it look so empty?
---
All you're doing rn is proving how ignorant you are about the game.
---
Most high skill killers use whispers as their main tracking perk (bbq doesnt count because everyone just uses it for the bloodpoints).
---
You will never find a good killer using something like spies from the shadows.
---
survivors are a single hitbox. and you can hear the multiple hits of the hatch. or its the lag, or someone deleted the destroyonhit of the hatchets,
---
It ironically works even better if you trap everyone with 1-2 Gens left. Trying to remove a Trap with the 2 minute end-game Timer is a nightmare still.
---
Nobody cares which game mode you're representing for extra credibility.... the fact is that an extra health state for each survivor running MoM is extremely problematic for a killer.
---
It is a toxic community and there are counters to things but most of the counters and the way players play are not be fun and/or fair. Why settle for this? Players should have a fair chance that is also fair. There are problems with survivors pallet looping and flash light blinding, it's not fun and most times infuriating. Killers tunnel and camp this is not fun and most times infuriating. This should not be the way it is. People take advantage of the mechanics of the game and it's not fun. Both sides keep whining because the killers and survivors have to do these unfun and infuriating things. Instead of saying "just have fun, stop whining" we should say "fix the game to be fun and fair for both sides." I love this game way to much too see it die off being in this state.
---
*smirks as a prenerf legion*
---
Honestly ever since the Locker buff update where they block auras I am inclined to agree.  If you run BBQ for bloodpoints it shines in that regard as a killers WGLF.  But utility wise it is just stupid easy to beat the reads whenever survivors choose to outplay it with the lockers.
---
Mannn I can run killers for 5 gens rather easy at my rank(10), it’s just......no one wants to do gens they want to 99 sabo every hook on the map.
---
Yes it is, it does nothing but make her weaker, it's a nerf. You don't "have traps left", you choose to save one or two intentionally because trapping a survivor in the end game is one of pig's strongest plays.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C6ATueQUQ8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=267
---
This is the kind of behavior I'm talking about. This really should be reportable.
---
As an Adam main, I can't even bring myself to run deliverance since I'm the first one found half the time. But you better believe I'ma be pebbling for my life and fucking up gens.  
---
And I would love to meet a stereotypical Jake.  Most of the Jakes I run across farm me straight off the hook.  David, Tapp, and Claudette are all pretty damn accurate though.  It can be hard as hell to find a Claudette when I play killer.
---
Yup. It rarely works, but I love seeing a desperate survivor's head pop.
---
"The only nerf is her power doesn't do anything"
---
lol neat
---
survivors only have one simple hitbox, also you can hear the double hit of the hatches.
---
I mean if I reallly want to I run iron grasp agitation, bring them to the basement and... but that's worse than insidious camping if you ask me
---
Incorrect. When you snap pallet in half, now there two pallet. Pallet always win.
---
K
---
Dude I hope we get ghostface. Second favorite killer of all time
---
Funny, the wedding i'm going to is also on May 4th.
---
Nobody cares which game mode you're representing for extra credibility.... the fact is that an extra health state for each survivor running MoM is extremely problematic for a killer. 'Time' is the greatest weapon against a killer, and Mettle of Man can provide more of it to survivors than any other perk. That's OP.
---
What happened to pig?
---
Welcome to Dead by Daylight. This is normal.
---
😅😅thanks man
---
You can tell who is friendly, survivors who don’t teabag hi to other survivors are the same survivors who sit on hatch
---
You’re great at taking things out of context.
---
It does nothing if you place it on them during end-game. At that point you lost anyway. Salty Killer mains everywhere.
---
“Wahhh! Wahhhh! I can’t 4K every game!”
---
traps just don't go off anymore when you leave exit gates b/c end game collapse, basically it
---
 I feel a reason why many people do not like it is because they do the same thing over and over and over again. And now after this change they need to try some new things and ppl don’t like it
---
What a shame :/
---
uwu
---
I don't mind the Ivory Mori nor Cypress but I can't stand the Ebony Mori's since there's zero counterplay
---
From reverse image search and Know Your Meme, he's a Russian Sleek'N'Tears model named Ernest Khalimov
---
Even still, not like w/l matters when in matchmaking
---
Yeah it sucks that they refuse to fix it. Hitboxes are scuffed.
---
Probably getting downvoted simply by mentioning ochido. As much of a parasite he is to the community, we should take the time to learn from our mistakes and do our best to not let any annoying toxic exploiters into the communtiy. He has done a good job at showing how much power survivors really have, and even though he isnt really good at all  (he reeaaaally has does not play optimally), he introduces a spotlight on the lesser conditions of the supposed power role, the killer, and how the killer has to use so much more effort in playing. Now before you call me out, I do play both sides (and all killers), and at times where I relaly need to relax or zone out, I naturally choose survivor. And before you call me a killer try hard, note that it takes much effort into slowing game progress, because generators are not more then ever being completed at an astounding rate (I play purple-red ranks on both killer and survivor btw)
---
Side note, sorry for the mini rant
---
Good killers dont need tracking perks.
---
The vast majority of online game devs use their test server/client to find bugs. Very rarely do they actually take opinion on actual content into consideration before pushing to live.
---
So yeah, unless people do flip their shit those changes typically go to live where they don't get reverted or further changed for a not insignificant period of time.
---
It's a pretty good perk, especially on more mobile killers. It also lowkey helps against genrushing.
---
Both things I regularly tell people. Mostly to annoy them.
---
When the store opened they claimed 80% of cosmetics would have a shard price tag in addition to cells.
---
Both sides have valid complaints. Tunnelling and gen rushing aren't but complaints about balance are pretty valid. This game has such messy balance that both sides have their fair share of bullshit.
---
Saying just play around/counter Ebony Mori or SWF is being willfully stupid.
---
32 meters is actually a pretty small area.
---
It's very easy to tell on which exit gate they're next to with it.
---
I feel like Nea should have a much higher toxicity chance, like 90% of all Neas I encounter use the brightest cosmetics and bring flashlights to blind me at every single pallet.
---
If you get grabbed out of a locker while your decisive strike is active, does it prompt???
---
Only if Iron Will, Urban Evasion, etc. stop working too. Much too OP in a 1v1.
---
The thing is that unlike the wraith, the Legion has tracking capabilities &amp; can injure more than 1 survivor in a short period of time. 
---
Being able to injure multiple survivors apply serious pressure on them to heal otherwise it forces survivors into a compromising position of being chased by a 115% killer that can instantly down them. This enough makes Legion superior to wraith in my opinion. 
---
His stall is the mend + the pressure to heal against him. No other killer can spread the damage out as significantly as Legion. 
---
His stall may not be as effective as the Pig or Freddy but it helps within a chase to have more than one survivor injured &amp; the pressure to heal will usually be enough to pull survivors of gens.
---
I mean sure lol I'm down with that
---
Remove those 2 perks from the game entirely for all I care
---
Found the noed ruin killer rip
---
People take the game too seriously imo, but they both sides have the right to be angry about how the game is balanced, just like, people should tone it down a notch.
---
https://twitter.com/RJTorbert/status/1112768936540549122?s=20
---
Look at the date is all I’m saying. This guy has been hand and hand with the guy in the post and I think he holds the license.
---
They did it because it was the best way to play a terrible killer. She's a bad killer, and no amount of trying new things is going to change that.
---
Yeah sorry couldn’t think of that good of a title.
---
Aww, no worries! I do a giveaway post every month, and I also do multiple giveaways (with a wide array of prizes) three times a week on my Twitch channel, RoryDiesALot. Also, I'm planning something special for December, though I know that's a little bit away!
---
It's window grabs for me, they only work if I blink to the window and even then only 1/3rd of the time.
---
Legion could get straight up removed and I’d be fine with it
---
agreed.
---
But they're meant to be. This is an *asymmetrical* game.
---
As someone who plays both equally, some of the complaints are valid. 
---
Tunneling is a problem. Moris are a problem. Facecamping is a problem. All of the counters to these are simply to let a teammate die, and that's not way to play. However, just because you got hooked twice in a row doesn't mean you got tunneled. Just because your team swarmed the hook and literally put no pressure anywhere else does not mean the killer camped. 
---
Spirit Fury and MoM are both problems because they reward you for messing up. 
---
New DS could use a clearer anti-tunnel rule, but if you tunnel and get hit with it that's your fault. Flashlights are an easy dodge, just look away. I do argue the relationship between pallets and flashlights aren't right but you messing up not looking away for a hook doesn't mean flashlights are broken. Instaheals should work like Brand New Parts where you have to do hard skillchecks for. And, seriously? Exhaustion perks? What, do killers want survivors to have *no* tools in a chase?
---
This, it's just the M1 animation. About as fast, too.
---
I feel like bc every update theres some nerf to survivors while killers get buffed somehow 4 out of 5 updates. I know the killers get nerfed but it seems like the nerf doesnt help much anyway but yhe survivor nerfs get insane. A few months back we got the HEAL nerf now it takes like a full minute to heal back up and onyop of that k's use sloppy to extend it. 
---
A usual perk set i see on a killer is thanataphobia, sloppy, ruin and noed. I know that the last are hexs and "easily countered" but they still are vommon and op nonetheless.
---
I also think the skill gap between a killer and a survivor is kust way too seperate. A full group of solos going against an experienced (not good but not full noob) killer is in the killer's favor. I know its 4v1 but it shouldnt be as easy as "see, lunge, hit, lunge, down" 
---
Also us survs only have like 3 main ways to play and they all tie into each other; gen rush, loop, and the odd slowly work on every gen a little bit.
---
I'm guessing you're referring to the Dream Guy?
---
Does EGC only power one exit gate?
---
I don't get it.
---
I see this suggested a lot. Respectfully, I think that would be very stupid.
---
This post was made my Freddy Gang
---
yea, Joe, the one with the fedorra
---
I play Pig every now and again and it makes perfect sense to me that they didn't want to make the traps incredibly unfun to play against in the end game.
---
Why should have the Pig gotten a huge buff because of the end game collapse?
---
"I HEARD THAT!"
---
And I agree with you
---
It starts when a gate is opened or the Killer closes the hatch.
---
Because he's bitching about devs not doing things that they are LITERALLY doing right now.
---
It is hilarious if they are half a second to slow and you see them do the "hide in locker" animation.

Isn't Small Game a totem counter?
---
That seems to make a lot of sense. Hopefully that means it's an easy fix then.
---
because there’s no corn
---
I mean, you could've googled for 5 seconds and found things like silent bell, clown instadown, purge aura reading, etc. It's fine to be ignorant, not taking the second to google and just chiming in with the "probably" as you make a snide comment is the part that makes you kind of a dipshit.
---
See? I told you, by saying what i said i indicated that i agreed with you which is as i said not an allowed opinion here
---
First of all,  I have no idea WHY for the love of god I keep getting matched with noobs. These two team mates died when we only had two gens done,  (I did one) me and my friend had to grind out the rest ourselves. I spent the whole match doing gens,  cleansing totems,  and going on forever long chases with this hag. I saved ALL my team mates TWICE a piece,  then I'm forced to die because a lousy killer gets a easy one shot. Which she only got me anyways because my girl slow vaulted threw a window. My friend and I cleansed 4 totems,  even tried to look for a 5th but it's impossible to tell because we did have two team mates so we were hoping they clensed ONE totem between two of them.. Well,  we were wrong. We popped the last gen and of course good ol one shotter comes running in,  I mean at least she didn't face camp but it's getting old. I literally got the most points,  double pipped and all just to get downed and killed. Like I've used it as killer don't get me wrong,  but I STILLLL think a totem counter needs added especially in situations like this where it is TWO people doing everything themselves.
---
Lol yeah you have to be full on potato to get caught with that one though.  Occasionally I'll be closing the door as dude gets hooked and I just nope right out of there.  I caught a Claudette (of course) with that once though.
---
&gt;"Let's waste time patrolling boxes to tunnel down trapped survivors while gens are being done. Duuuuuur I love the way crayons taste and the feel of the window as I drag my tongue across it."
---
No. It goes off when traps or totems are in your area,  when playing the hag or trapper how would you know? Traps are everywhere.
---
Thats straight up false my guy, pigs most viable build is saving traps for endgame. And getting those traps off can take a good chunk of time. Changes were needed, but maybe not ones as harsh as what she got
---
Because I don't think it's very healthy for this game to introduce more unfun ways to play since the devs have tried to make it more fun for everyone for the past couple of years?
---
Ok cheers for that.
---
It should also be a difference between quitting and actually losing connection. If they quit the character should get huffy and then impaled by the entity, while if it's an actual loss of connection, whatever they're doing, they're interrupted, get a scared look as the entity springs up infront of them and impales them.
---
Honestly NOED should be reworked to do something with the End Game Collapse. Like maybe it reduces the timer, or starts the timer when the last gen is done rather than when an exit gate is open.
---
&gt; A, use the full frenzy to get very close to them and end it
---
I've been playing legion like this since his PTB and people are doing the shocked pikachu face at this method
---
cool thanks.
---
No kidding. I think we can all agree that this needs fixing, at least to remove the temptation if nothing else.
---
I agree especially with the facecamping thing. I have played games where SWF swarm me instantly after I hook one of them so I rotate around the hook to chase players and prevent save but I get called a camper because I’m trying to kill them while they are clustered around their friend
---
Btw, I'm online rn on ps4 with the same username if anyone wants to SWF
---
Why is someone down voting my comment? It's a explanation of the perk. I main survivor and killer,  no need to all run out with your pitchforks. And I also said I run the perk as well,  and STILLLLL think it needs a counter.
---
I wouldn't mind something like that,  I just don't think a totem counter is to much to ask for even if we have to attach to a perk to have it,  like noed.
---
I have no idea why you're asking me. I never bother with voting ever. It's kind of silly to me.
---
None of those are anywhere near powerful as insta-hatchets, but you wouldn't know because you're dumber than dog shit.
---
Earth just lost some of its best defenders....
---
I agree with you with this. Both survivors and killers have valid reasons to complain with most of the things. Of course every game you will ever play will have *those* teammates.
---
Boutta pick up Monstrous Shrine
---
We just get a new feature and you already want to buff it when we don’t fully know how it will turn out?
---
I’m indifferent on a totem counter but I feel like the only reason people want one is because of how unbalanced NOED is and I feel like reworking NOED would be more important than a totem counter.
---
I wasn't directly asking you,  I think it's funny as well. Just makes no sense,  not like I'm talking shit about anyone except maybe my noob annoying ass team mates.
---
That’s fair, but I was messing with the idea on reworking NOED based on the End Game Collapse.
---
Anything that makes NOED less bullshit is fine by me
---
Actually, it's because headshots deal and insta-down. Possible change came to the PTB.
---
The emblem is not broken, the description is wrong. Actually 9+ hooks don’t guarantee you any quality, they just give you a bonus point in Devout. I think you can still get only silver with 10 hooks if you only kill 2 survivors and 2-hook the others. They introduced the 9+ hook bonus point because Iri Devout happened too often and you need this in addition to four kills to score Iri Devout. If the description was correct, it would be even easier to achieve Iridescent quality now. 
---
If healing wouldn’t remove points from Malicious you could farm infinite Malicious points. You get them back next time you hit them. Survivors get points stolen for things completely out of their control, with no possibility to regain them.
---
If you‘re not red rank, you can get Adept Killers with a Gold Devout. I got Adept Plague with Gold Devout + anything else Iri.
---
Ok if you killed all four that should be Iridescent Devout.
---
Its both blade addons
---
First, The healing update was a good nerf for survivors, this helps killers slow down the game and have a better chance. Hexs should be changed to help the killer council the hex and have it last longer Second, the survivors have a bigger chance against the killer even if they are experienced solos and/or have so-so perks. The chase mechanic should be changed to make it more fun for everyone. Lastly, there shouldn't be a bunch of ways to play a game. If you get bored of it then you've just fallen victim to a symptom that all gamers suffer from, reputation. But also the ways you play should be improved to make it more fun.
---
Assuming the question is without my injury, I'd just knock back my drink (I always have a fucking drink), say fuck it, boop the snoot, and see where shit takes me.
---
Wait until the legion changes since after the changes you only have to hit a survivor once with deep wounds then down them. It feels better to get it before but it will be easier afterwards
---
But if you down a survivor when they're the last one left you've already won. The hatch can't be closed unless it was already opened. 
---
EGC doesn't start until the doors are open, have you read the patch notes?
---
I have this question so often. That one survivor that plays like a complete noob but is somehow evading me.
---
they're still doing that, they just undid another thing they were doing; making her traps pause while in her terror radius. Also traps still go off if you leave exit gates, but not if the trap was placed after the last generator poped.
---
What am  I looking at?
---
Too be fair if you give the community full control of the changes it kills the game. Just look at the culling for example.
---
"What's a pallet? Hmm..“
---
This is really the only complaint that I can really get behind. I don't give a give a damn about the Legion changes or the Pig. The issues with DCs is out of control and effects everyone. They need to address this
---
Billy and Stu were in high school, and feral means "akin to wild animals" . Idk why I'm even explaining this to you in 2019,when you can open another tab and search it faster than waiting for me to be your teacher. 
---
After the first events of scream it was alllllllll copycat killers. They were the murderer equivalent of kids breaking things for attention. Billy isn't convincing enough as a psycho, because he was only out to avenge something that was ultimately trivial, and Stu was just dumb.
---
Killing to frame someone or be famous (Scream), is not nearly as evil as killing for the fuck of it and little else (legion). Especially since you bring up the point they may be younger than highschool kids, or college kids, depending on which killer you pick.
---
According to BHVR they wont nerf NOED because they think its currently in the right place.
---
They think its fairly balanced
---
sn oʇuo ɹᴉǝɥʇ ʇnɥS
---
The devs be like that. If they’re gonna keep the exposed, at least warn the survivors when the last gen is done.
---
Lol is that Nurse Billy?
---
the power still doesn't seem that good. I'll save my final judgment when the changes come to console, but all I'm seeing so far is a 4 blink Nurse level of stun, comparable to Spirit in power recharge, no ability to down with the power(outside of hitting them 5 times with Franks). The power seems decent at best with too many downsides and negatives to it to actually seem useful against good survivors, you'll probably be wasting more time running from survivor to survivor if they're keen enough to stay spread out on you.
---
You can use Lithe with MoM, they're not mutually exclusive or even have the same activation conditions....
---
As someone who has played both, getting hardcore tunneled (like killer actively leaving chases to go back to hook to hit the unhooked) is not fun. Especially if you were able to do nothing that game because you happened to spawn right where the killer checks first. I get wanting a kill but I don't find a game like that fun at all and I won't play it. Sorry but, I play to have fun and learn and being tunneled like that is the annoying at best.  Even camping, I'll stick around and buy my teammates time. Not fun but idk. Hardcore tunneling is worse imo. 
---
Other than that, I get it. Killer isn't entitled to 4 kills, survivor isn't entitled to escaping, even if they're the last one alive/all other survivors DC'd.
---
Shut my what?
---
Hopefully a lot of these issues are fixed with dedicated servers. The graphics were actually downgraded recently to account for the constant FPS drop. I have one of the original ps4s and I personally think the downgraded graphics helped. I’ll take Minecraft graphics over 5fps. But that’s also not saying much lol
---
Dude that's a great point I've never thought about
---
I like the idea of a way to reduce the timer for killers, but currently this is really weak perk.
---
They don’t, besides the point. MoM is just not OP. I just can’t understand why people think it is, maybe people need to get better at killing.
---
I play both 50/50. I'm only Rank 11 Killer but even I agree with the Pig changes. They didn't ruin her by any means, and an Endgame Build is still realistically possible, even moreso with the 2 Minute EndGame Collapse Timer now.
---
If you get anxiety from that then you probably shouldn't be playing this game
---
Noed...needs another counter huh...
---
They look good. Comfy?
---
This is an offputting idea. IMagine running into this guy midgame? XD He would murder you. But it adds a sense of self preservation to the game, soloing in place of working with others. Balance out the perks, and this would be a viable character, as long as you gave a killer to balance him. Maybe one that works opposite of him?
---
Doesn't matter. I use Kindred specifically for this, and people still just run in and hook themselves.
---
Because the camera can't see their right hand
---
I wouldn’t lump spirit fury in with MoM. You cant really mess up holding W on a loop... Really shouldn’t be respecting pallets with or without spirit fury.
---
Not to give any indication on whether or not its balanced. I don’t have an opinion on that honestly. I agree with everything else you’ve said for sure, I just don’t think spirit fury is what you made it out to be.
---
no way.
---
Then why don’t the just flip the side where it’s respectable of which hand the killer is dominant in our fortunate case all killers are right handed 🙄 (maybe, didn’t read into this)
---
You have great points. I have to admit a 14 second dash that covers 70 meters is fun with the sketch book add-ons.
---
If you get stunned by the pallet, you messed up. If you hold W and get stunned by the pallet, you failed to outplay the stun. Thus, spirit fury rewards you by messing up a chase because it breaks, you don't get stunned, and you get the free hit. 
---
There are three other keys you can hit
---
:)
---
Youre not wrong man...but the devs kinda help with the division.
---
If survivors wanna come at me with instant heals, fast toolboxes, and keys then I'll come at them with ebony mori's. :P
---
Woah that was a toxic response dude, is discussion for a killer nerf enough to call somebody out for eating crayons?
---
&gt; Nea 
---
ok 
---
&gt; Definitely urban evading doing little to nothing the entire game.
---
Ok true
---
&gt; Will  probably get hatch because the killer is sick of looking for her.
---
UM UH MAYBE \*sweats\*
---
&gt;Probably let you hit second stage instead of running to the hook even  though the killer is miles away
---
THIS IS A LIE IT'S ALL MADE UP STOP IT LEAVE WE DON'T NEED YOU
---
I’ve also noticed this. My theory is that the Entity has a flair for drama.
---
There's way more quentins than Lauries
---
yes
---
I don't think skill level has any anything to do with acknowledgement of OP mechanics in the game. Why do you? I think SWF + voice comm is OP
---
, but that doesn't mean that they're impossible challenges or anything. Just iveroiwered
---
The difference is you aren’t actively looking to get hit with MoM. You’re looping just as you normally would, and then it rewards you for actually messing up.
---
Spirit fury is a complete playstyle change. The two aren’t comparable.
---
That was so everyone could have some choices, but they've gotta make money now.
---
"Everything has a counter" *laughs in nurse*
---
What if you just give the other survivors a quick tip of the hat?  I like to just crouch once, hold for half a second, then uncrouch.  Show that “Yes, I see you, now let’s get to work.”
---
That’s what I do, one crouch and I’m onto gens. Always fun tho when someone is twerking at max speed and you join em
---
Discordance, I said discordance, why...why are you...why are you so...old?
---
1 minute is way too short lol. You wouldnt have time to get to 3 boxes on some maps lets alone 4 or more
---
i love smacking nurses with pallets. Its hard, but when you pull it off its satisfying
---
I mean most people would dc there or just die on hook
---
ta.... so even his people didn't need him
---
Ok actually what like how did this get 300 likes I made a mediocre meme with a dead format using the picture editing software on my phone
---
Rip Freddy
---
Please trapper, dont give the government ideas to create more taxes
---
There are tons of cases where timing your MoM proc would be super handy. 
---
Saves, body blocks, and other risky altruistic behaviors can be made easier if you time your MoM proc. It's harder, but not impossible. Spirit Fury is a crutch for not being able to mindgame a pallet drop. You can't look at Survivors and say "you getting a free hit isn't fair" and then turn around and say "but you getting one is totally okay" to the killers. It's pure cognitive dissonance. Their designs punishes players for doing their jobs. A Survivor is supposed to try for the pallet stun. You can't say the success deserves punishment.
---
Blind date? Must be running Face Mask.
---
this is practically a survivor perk what the fuck
---
how many times am I going to have to thumbs down this dumb shit
---
Why such a old screenshot?
---
:(
---
The "I am grounded" really elevates this post.
---
With MLGA and http://dbd.onteh.net.au we're pretty much playing on dedicated servers.
---
I'm curious though what percentage of the negative feedback was given player who actually tested it.
---
No...but hopefully it runs/looks better than ps4 for you.
---
Thank you for your commitment to doing the work I was too lazy to. I appreciate you!

Problem is - they are not "headshots". You hit survivor in torso, he goes down.
---
It's not in the patch notes. It was confirmed as a bug by community moderator on one of fog whisperer's stream.
---
Google image search turned it up as the first result and I'm not gonna scroll through google image search for a meme.
---
Welcome to the game, you're looking at IRL bloodpoints
---
I'm right here with you brother. I really hope they fix this because it's not going to be worth the pain to play this game I legitimately really enjoy.
---
Idk if this is sarcasm, but in reddit you have to put /s to make it more clear, we may have a miss understanding on being "grounded" , I just cant go out of my house. Games just last way shorter than than pre patch decisive. It so stressful as it is now
---
Ah, shit, here we go again.
---
They aren't left handed at the menu, their right arm just gets tired so they hold it in their left hand while they chill at the camp fire.
---
From what I saw it happens if they get hit in the upper part of the hitbox. Definitely not okay now but eith polish I feel it could be a cool addition to her kit.
---
At the same time it is a little too strong, especially since some actions lock you in place (pallets and windows mainly) and a good Huntress could totally abuse that to get free downs waaay too easy.
---
Still an interesting idea, though.
---
Agreed, and apparently they're already talking about dialling back some of the pig nerfs
---
Nah. I play so I can watch my friends sacrifice themselves to the entity and to meme pig, let survivors boop the snoot, and let survivors sacrifice themselves.
---
What?
---
Neon Legion tho... oof
---
as someone who plays both id say it depends on your rank at lower ranks its def in the killers favor but higher ranks its in survivors favor mostly because a bad killer at low ranks can get 4k easy that same killer at higher ranks will get looped to death because people actualy know how to loop and waste the killers time and on top of that theres a ton of second chance perks that higher rank killer use really well to their advantage
---
 (*chuckles as nerfed freddy)
---
There definitely is a power-abuse/control syndrome present in DBD.
---
For example, people sitting at hatches for 30+ minutes, people facecamping flashlights/tea baggers, etc.
---
bloody drongos
---
They’re alright, a lot less lag but the hitboxes are still fucked
---
Says:
---
&gt; if you play by imaginary rules you are not gonna have a fun time
---
Then proceeds to list off imaginary rules; however, they're granted exemption due to:
---
&gt; I think that is regular etiquete
---
Something just isn't quite adding up here.
---
i think anyone who has ever played both sides can agree tunneling isnt fun or rewarding for the survivor and getting gen rushed isnt fun but i dont mind the gen rush too much because its what survivors have to do to win
---
Hi Carol.
---
Only there's no way for them to know unless the killer is just eating pallets and being transparent about it. Which is a different issue than the actual perk itself.
---
r/foundcarl
---
i wish less people would cry about survivor/killer and whos right and wrong and cry more about the issues that plauge the game such as hit boxes and the current dc problem
---
To be fair, it is good to test everything. I was palying trapper and got no noise notifications, the camera snaps down when picking up a trap, the trap auras shrink as you get closer and disappear making it hard sometimes to find it, and some of the addons like iridescent stone and honing stone don't seem to be working properly. And then a mori doesn't seem to line up properly while on servers most of the time, like I go up to do it and then it start the animation but keep walking.
---
So I'm sure any data while ptb testing is useful data since a lot can break and they've got to try and find it all.
---
Your now taking things out of context. The change was needed to keep atleast some form of balance towards the survs in endgame as pig. And also there are strong killers but there are no op killers. Its the adddons that need fixing
---
It really isn't. They don't want people staling out games anymore saving hats.
---
Me and my friends are in our late twenty's, (we play on PS4) occasionally a killer will be toxic to us in messages trying to get us pissed off. Last time it happened we found out that the killer was a 17 year old so, I'm guessing it's just teenagers being teenagers
---
&gt; perfectly normal conversation
---
I'm not too sure about this "hunch" friend. If anything I'd say the constant salt/BM turns players cold to the opposite side when you main only 1 specific side of the game.
---
I enjoy playing killer because I enjoy the hunt, I like setting traps and controlling the circumstances that lead to the traps working as intended.
---
This is why I'm a Trapper main, I think the way a Trapper needs to succeed, because let me tell you, red ranks as a Trapper are not even as fun as you think it isn't.
---
I don't BM, I don't troll or flame, anything I get from survivors outside of something sportmanship/GG get no response at all an that  works for me.
---
Kek'd
---
what?
---
Double bp is next week so just grind hard and you can play catch up. Pc is better anyways.
---
agreed this game is a messy balance for both sides i wish more people would try the other side and get an understanding of why each of them is bitching at each other
---
Yea maybe this isn’t the game for me anymore, survivors can be pretty annoying at times too. I played early days of fortnite and thought it was cool until all the 5 year olds got into it and started trying to act annoying like their favorite streamer, so I went searching for a new game and came across this one. Turns out this is even more annoying. I’m just too old I guess to even want to deal with any of that anymore
---
even nurse has her counters even if they are few
---
We already have enough games modes
---
4v1
---
3v1
---
2v1
---
Heck even recently I seen 2v3
---
"Oh and can you go through stuff? i didn't think so, Wanker."
---
Name one
---
every time is see that perk in the middle (forgot its name) it reminds me of a cheesy face
---
*Allegedly...
---
I usually hear them from a few tiles away. You don't just have to listen out for them either, the generator light starts flickering more while it's being repaired
---
For me game loading times 10x faster.
---
I respect that; and I respect a very good killer. My friends and I will actually say things like “oh shit this guy is smart, damn he outsmarted me nice...” and lose or win I just say gg if I win, but if I get a really good killer who whooped me I’ll definitely say gg. Only bad part is when you get those annoying ones who want to rub it in your face like if dbd is life.
---
Goddammit. I didnt know which one to use and I chose wrong. *Saw theme plays*
---
I agree on vigil being to OP. The rest is perfect in my opinion aswell.
---
Australia is in Europe??? They had Hitler and famous composers like Joseph Haydn lol
---
This. Just fucking read this comment devs. Never make it so an RBT on you can walk out.
---
I personally will see to no more nerfs and buffs only.
---
At my home it's the other way around
---
I agree but I think the reason me and every other Piggy hated it was that now our traps were a joke with no killing and we were forced to go M1 and tunnel. Survivors would not like that either.
---
That's the single most impactful way to use RBT's.
---
If you catch somebody in the endgame and place a trap on their head, they can't just get unhooked and make a beeline for the exit gate, and anybody who gets downed trying to save them will be in the same situation.
---
Sure you can use them mid trial to slow the gens. That's fine, it can be strong.
---
It's also a *really boring way to use such a potentially awesome mechanic*.
---
Using them mid trial slows the gens. Whoop dee doo
---
Using them post trial forces the team to put their life on the line to play Jigsaw's game.
---
The devs saying that RBT's shouldn't be used to kill people is really disappointing. It's one thing coming from a player saying that they just aren't good for that (true), but it's another thing entirely coming from a Dev saying that "they will never be allowed to be good for that."
---
its not about being good at killing its about them wasting your time if i have to chase someone for another 30-40 seconds  because of MoM that can make a huge impact on the game especially at higher ranks i do think that its fine the way it is but there needs to be a better down side to using it other than an aura that is pretty much useless most of the time
---
Well how they nerfed her now is TO long. So I see an eye for an eye.
---
I don't enjoy less than 5 man games. If I start one as killer I instant DC and if survivor I just alert the killer where I am and suicide on hook.
---
Because if the timer is running fast you will barely make it to all of the  boxes even if you dont miss q single skill check. The last time one killed me was because they were spread out too far and I just happen to be the one that had to hit all 4 boxes to get free.
---
Outstanding move.
---
The wood of course
---
red ranks both sides here as well and i play nurse if your having problems with her switch your playstyle up ive never seemed to have a problem unless i was being stupid theres different types of survivors out there some of them i down in 30 seconds because they are predictable others change the way they play through out the match and always keep me guessing
---
Surveillance.
---
Technician makes the sound of a Survivor repairing a gen quieter.
---
It has nothing to do with the killer giving me a fair shot. It has to do with the boxes being spread out. So if the timer was less time than it is now you wont have enough time to travel the distance require. That would be setting up people with a pretty high rate of death. I think if that trap is going to pop it should be because the killer prevented you from taking it off one way or another and not because you went and the first 3 boxes were just a waste of time.
---
Bear in mind, these aren't the final dedicated servers.
---
This is just a stress test/making sure the idea is sound. Since the servers won't be out until July/August, BHVR have time to refine them.
---
I mean now all they nerfed is traps at endgame, traps are unaffected for the rest of the match.
---
I mean people do that kind of shit in league or dota too, BM and messing with your opponents is fun.
---
Nope.
---
They will do small scale deployments after 2.7.0 goes live, but they won't roll out fully until July/August.
---
He's the man of your dreams.
---
So you’re just gonna give him our subreddit, WITHOUT hooking him first?
---
Its rude.
---
Don’t hurt Carl
---
Most people in this community in general seem to be either "specialized at different aspects of mental capability" or legit mentally ill (referring to the ones who go your steam profile and start harassing you outside of the game). 
---
Don't think too much of it though, it's usually just salt that manifests in disturbing ways.
---
You remind yourself what subreddit you’re on, and I’m gonna go get the entity on the phone.
---
Imagine blaming every little thing on the game instead of trying to get better
---
If the Killer stands near the door, it is IMPOSSIBLE for the Survivor to approach it due to Whispers.
---
Yes but it's the internet, if you want civil behavior you need to play in private communities or play games with restricted communication.
---
There's a bug that causes Technician to make repairs louder instead of quieter.
---
Im not saying im struggling vs nurse because most nurses plays like trash, but the actual good ones who you never see anymore is pretty much impossible to juke / mindgame more than 1 or 2 times pr chase. But now we are talking about a entirely different topic, breaking LoS is not a direct counter to  nurse, it can be the diference between getting cought or not but definitely not  a counter.
---
I'm only a year younger. I hate annoying people but I'm a adult. They wont run me off of a game I enjoy. Some killers like their hollow victories and that's whatever. I had like 4 killers dc tonight I had all kinds of bad mannered survivors when I play killer matches. I just try my best to outplay them.
---
Okay, I can actually get behind this lore theory lol
---
It's basically more skillful (?) iridescent heads.
---
Need Australia servers my microwave from 2005 runs it better then my console
---
i don't say that we shouldn't complain, i say that complain aren't well oriented. People ask for more broken and unfun buff to counter already stupid ingame things.
---
I don't want that solo survivors get buffed to look like swf, firstly 'cause even with ingame voice come and kindred solo will still be far from being as strong as serious swf 'cause it's "solo" not 4V1. You will never have 4 people trying their best and acting in coordination if they are not in premade.
---
And i don't want to see Killers getting again more buff or QOl improvement 'cause as soon as they are able to directly counter survivors mechanic there is no point playing survivor, specially when hiding in this game is a joke : countered by a lot of killers tool and not rewarded anyway.
---
So people should stop asking for more and start to ask for less. To come back to what was supposed to be this game. .
---
Survivor is specifically coded to function with latency, killer isn't.
---
The current ptb is just a stress-test to see if the servers can hold up. I assume they understand they need to reprogram everything from killer-side, and they will most likely make OCE-servers in the future.
---
Definitely not more skillful with broken hitboxes. If they were better? Maybe. I think it would be too strong for them to even consider.
---
Nah technician makes it louder.
---
when they said they can track intentional DCs,does it mean we will get a temporary ban straight away?bc I dont kinda want a tunneling a\*\*hole chasing me for 5 minutes straight off the [hook. so](https://hook.so) if I dc against that,will I get a ban?
---
Dare to run away and use the environment to their advantage (loop). If you lead a killer on a chase slightly longer than they want, you're a 'toxic survivor' and were asking for it.
---
at least good you got Adept, these got tricky after emblems change and might be even harder with endgame collapse. I have only adept clown left and I am extremely salty I haven't done it before Plaque patch, since I did, like, 5 almost perfect matches with adept perks, 4k, and \~30BP and they all were only ruthless, so no adept.

---
A ETHERNET CORD
---
I can't, for the life of me, understand why they nerfed Legion's cooldown add-ons.
---
When you compare him to the Wraith, it's embarrassing:
---
Since Legion can't down with Frenzy anymore (unless you're running FMT, but that's a FIVE hit down); you'd have to hit someone with Frenzy, then catch up and eat the stun before you can attack again.
---
Bear in mind, Legion's base stun is 4 seconds. This is only 0.5 seconds faster than Wraith's base cloak + decloak speed.
---
Only...
---
Wraith's base cloaked speed is .06 m/s faster than Frenzy and, unlike Frenzy, can be made faster with add-ons.
---
Said cloaking and decloaking times can be significantly reduced.
---
Wraith has no terror radius when cloaked, while Legion has a 32m terror radius.
---
Legion can't Frenzy after a normal attack.
---
Legion can't see scratchmarks OR BLOOD while in Frenzy
---
Frenzy has a 10 second recharge
---
Frenzy only lasts 10 seconds, at base.
---
If it weren't for the vaulting and half-decent tracking, there'd be no point to ever using Frenzy.
---
The most op character.
---
Why aren't people using the PNG format? Just saving a JPG over and over again making it look like shit.
---
Definitely using that, thanks!
---
If enough people ask I'll upload the full thing in another thread
---
So I guess you think Bloodhunts are overrated too... Right?
---
It's a 20 second recharge, the guy on stream was incorrect.
---
You got it
---
Every fucking time
---
Hello
---
For design purposes.
---
This is like people speculating about why a character did one minor thing wrong in the first instalment of a franchise. Because the context of the other entries didn't exist yet.
---
There's no 'lore' reason for it. Get over it.
---
On the forums, I believe.
---
My girl isn't perfect any more. how would you like it if someone you cared for was taken away by someone else?
---
No problem! Good luck on filling out the rest!
---
Ok, I thought we were talking about the live version. What’s the point in asking the devs to fix this immediately if PTB progress doesn’t carry over and it affects a part (Dedicated Servers) that won‘t go live with the patch anyway.
---
You're 25 bud, calm down on the "I'm too old for this shit" schtick mkay? Yeah there are toxic people, they're are those in every game's community. Even in pve games. If that runs you out of a game then it's not the game for you. You just gotta find the right one that has the balance of toxic/fun. I've played against campers, flashlight spam, etc but I've also had amazing games with cool people. So take all that for what you wish.
---
I know that feeling. Thankfully I got Clown's before the patch, but I still don't have Doctor's, Nurse, and of course Plague. Getting Legion's was a pleasant surprise.
---
Not having Adept Doctor hurts the worst I think :( 
---
Here's to hoping they'll rework Adept Killer trophies at least
---
You're right, it not OP...
---
By itself. 
---
When only one person is running it.
---
If there sre multiple MoMs, combine with stuff like; Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Insta-heals, D Strike, etc. then it takes *so many* extra hits to down people when time is already very tight.
---
That was people's problem with old DS; not its individual power, but its synergy both with itself and other powerful perks.
---
Plus the Survivor doesn't have tp do anything to proc the perk. They just get a free extra hit.
---
A man main, I love it.
---
Yea the Problem is that i have no Clue how many totems are left if i dont play 4 man swf
---
Can we send him to r/dbdgonewild ?
---
The Nurse thing got fixed
---
As long as he doesn’t go wild
---
[This is all you need in life](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9m8s32/my_pig_cosplay_i_know_its_bad_lmao_still_had_fun/)
---
nope, Legion can now locker grab during frenzy
---
I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the music we butt-dance to.
---
A right handed glove wouldn't fit very well on a left hand but it would be amusing to see the poor fucker do it.
---
I play Susie and I'm a nontoxic killer, oof
---
Ah well, guess some killers will use the tried and true "Ebony Mori so you can mori all survivors" strat. 
---
And MoM is still an obsession perk, and still can be "countered" by using a green mori to mori the obsession. If multiple people are running it, it won't work but you'll at least fry one of the MoM users.
---
How is it *not* OP?
---
In what way is an extra health state WITH NO DOWNSIDES not OP?
---
Imagine if NOED wasn't a hex perk...
---
that was literally my favorite thing going against endgame Pig - to roll the dice. had this amazing RP experience several times with really god Pig mains. she was only killer i love endgame build on to play against. 
---
a lot of people say Pig is annoying but seriously can't understand why. have over 2k hours in my record and in this experience i find Billy the most tunneling piece of trash killer i sincerely want to be removed from the game or at least for some of his power aspects to be reworked. (this statement i have cause Billy is ridiculously easy to play as, unlike Nurse where apart from skill you gotta be fully aware of everything and have very high sense of prediction, he has enormous inbuilt map control and 90% of people who choose to main the killer are focused on 4k fast and efficient without hours upon hours on training with Nurse) 
---
only on yellow to late green ranks i've seen trash Pigs doing the tunnel a lot but they're just bad killers who don't know better. they will tunnel and camp on any killer and will ruin the experience for survivors. it's just so upsetting to me that devs respond on the complaints of less dedicated players making this killer less enjoyable on high ranks.
---
What did they restored about pig? I can't find anything in the patch notes
---
First it ain't cringey for me, second my live is a meme.
---
nope
---
Ps4 struggles
---
After legion kill the first victim, are they are instantly taken by the entity? 
---
Huh. I didn't read that part.
---
You all but dismiss everything I said, and with a hand wave "it's unimportant", but you went from "killed 40 people" to realizing all but Billy and Stu are pathetic.
---
Anyways. I got you to settle on ONE killer from scream, and you picked Stu. Now, you better make a better case for Stu here, other than he is basically Julie from legion. 
---
We already have legion. It's ghostface already, and you just argued that legion have the weakest lore. 
---
Amazing. I can't wait for another killer that is just like one we already have.  It's like we did this before with licenced characters. I wonder how that worked out?
---
Wow that is really strong! Let's nerf Pig again.
---
I personally like what we currently have.
---
You go straight down on the ground from the standing position, I've seen people do some funny stuff with it. Jumping out of the locker and flopping down on their faces as if they've tripped, falling from a tall structure and landing face first as if they were in a looney tunes cartoon. c:
---
It's legit nothing, just takes a 0 off your level and gives bragging rights. Just a way to keep the levelling system continuous.
---
I'm devotion 1 level 78, so basically level 178
---
Ah, maybe to fuck the other survivors over out of getting the "Where did they go" achievement?
---
Michael is slow starting off. One of the slowest killers but can be very fast and good in evil within 3.   You don’t have a red stain or much of a terror radius in EW1. So sneak and level up on people without them knowing.  You can even get grabs off of gens. 
---
As for getting your exposed (one shot on EW3) 99 your EW and pop it as you’re right behind a survivor don’t do it far away.  
---
Also, don’t camp hooks and don’t tunnel survivors off of hook. Some say it’s a “legit strategy” but you will get a lot of hatemail. Sometimes it’s efficient but choose carefully when to do so. 
---
He has awesome add ons. Scratched mirror let’s you see survivors within an x amount of meters but you will be slow. But it’s good for scaring (put on lerys map) Watch Montos videos on Michael. 
---
There’s tombstone where you can MORI people who haven’t even been hooked! But don’t suck all of EW on people because eventually you can’t stalk anymore.   And then there’s tuft of hair, allows you to stay in EW3. Its HARD to get, and they will power through gens before you get to it but end game is perfect.
---
Thank you! For toxicity well I am a for honor veteran so Ive had my fair share and Im not a snowflake so I can manage lmfao
---
I think it's a design philosophy where the good characters are on the left while the bad characters are on the right.
---
Unfortunately, I think the adepts will stay the same. They are true to their descriptions now 'getting mercilles victory with killer's perks', and they are doable, even if much harder.
---
As for adept doctor, I think it might not be the worst, he is fast and overcharge helps prolong endgame. just try to eliminate 1-2 people before 2 gens are done and go for hardcore 3gen strat, if possible even 4gen if the gen placement is favourable. 
---
Actually, it appliest to Clown too, I just got unlucky 2 or 3 times being, like, a few pixels away from getting higher emblem in gatekeeper and /or chaser ;/
---
I have a special build I use whenever I want to blow off some steam, I call it "Basement Trapper". Basically, I take "Iron Grip" &amp; "Agitation" as well as "Brutal Strength" &amp; "NOED" and put everyone I catch in the basement. Then I trap the entraces and snowball from there on. There's very little counterplay once the survivors are trapped down there, the experience is truly cathartic to me.
---
&gt; I can usually have a chase with the killer for 4+ gens
---
Would love to do a KYF against you and see this
---
I hate when this happens
---
Meanwhile Huntress learns to one hit ko with head shots
---
It got reverted so you're a bit late.
---
Yeah you always could crouch chase for that. Waste way more time tho.
---
Got a few ideas for wraith boi,

---
ur getting closer except 1was already dead before gens were done. Involves something on  hatch and getting NOEDed
---
Yeah I played against my friends where all is unlocked and I saw that and used it as well and actually I really like the stalkinh cause its just like in the movies so its big roleplay for me at least.
---
Yeah some buffs to her would be warranted.
---
That's pretty cool, you should post the original screenshot.
---
Nah dude
---
You should use at least one of the Samination cartoon versions of the killers.
---
Or just cleanse totems when you see them instead of sitting on gens the entire time and complaining about an absolutely useless perk.
---
The only time I think NOED is viable to complain about is Nurse, simply because it's hard to find enough time to cleanse totems vs a good Nurse.
---
Its not meant to be a deal and it is not meant to give killer mains any more of an advantage. They still want a level of balance similar to the previous system.
---
It is also not up to you whether the game decides to address fundamental issues to the core game and ways it can be exploited. Its not like they are trying to give you anything, they need to fix the game by introducing a new end game system.
---
Look, I have as many questions and concerns as you. And I always found hatch standoffs amusing. But this shouldn't be an option of how the game ends, and survivors shouldn't be able to abuse and time waste the killer.
---
It doesn't matter how you feel about it. The equivalent would be playing a search and destroy game in a COD and being able to not let the game end if you have the bomb, or a scenario where either an attacker or defender has to 'give in' in order for the game to end.
---
If you care about balance, true balance, then you must understand that the win conditions need to be concrete and fair for both killers and survivors first. 
---
Also this 'I'm a killer main and I'm hard done by' is just ridiculous. The survivors are taking just as many end game nerfs, and they are going to continually balance this. Survivors will literally die on the spot if they are wasting time, or waiting to save killers. It will be way easier to chase people out of the map and focus on whoever isn't at the gates. 
---
The Pig has taken a hit and will probably be reworked so that her mid game is more viable and shouldn't have to rely on trapping people in the map at the end. The reason there is outrage is because people know that this is the best way to play and use her. But all this complaining on reddit just reeks of "I'm used to something, don't change it" - and everyone playing the victim, and failing to see the bigger picture.
---
Focusing on the pig nerf is just silly though. The end game is changing. There is no possible way that RBTs would work with this in their previous form.
---
It's a bug, not buff
---
Don’t get me wrong- I love the randomness of the RBT as well. The only problem is, that if EDC has happened, having to search a couple boxes is almost certainly a death sentence, whereas in normal game, you can search plenty of boxes and be generally safe, provided no- one pops a gen- and even then you have a decent amount of time. 
---
I don’t get the pig nerfs either- I’m just trying to find a compromise that makes her endgame build viable with this new collapse, but isnt a guaranteed death sentence to anyone you down after the collapse starts. It just put them in a difficult predicament, not be a guaranteed kill.
---
If you get looped for minutes then you are making a ton of mistakes in a chase. 
---
&gt;only to get hit by ds or some teammate with a flashlight.
---
You can't get hit with DS unless you've tunneled someone off hook and didn't slug them. If you have "chased someone for minutes" then you won't get hit with ds.
---
As for flashlights, you can always look into the wall, bait pickup so that people rush out for the save and you will get a hit for free. If you really choose to be lazy about it then you can use lightborn/infectious fright.
---
&gt;if a killer gets to the point where they feel the only way to get kills is to hard patrol/camp hooks then clearly theres a balancing issue there. 
---
No, that's not a balancing issue. You are playing the match really badly if you HAVE TO tunnel one person all game to kill anyone. If you get better at chases &amp; make better map decisions, you won't be in that situation.
---
&gt;NoED has a very simple solution, cleanse totems
---
If you are the one getting "chased for minutes" then you are never in a position to clense the NOED. Relying completely on your soloQ teammates isn't a reliable strategy in those situations.
---
&gt;trying to loop the killer for points
---
Looping is literally the main way for the survivors to not go down to the killer in a chase, it's not done "for points", it's done to survive.
---
I was being sarcastic, ik it’s a bug. 🙄 but still it’s interesting, and currently a “buff” even if its not intentional.
---
I want to see this thing completed
---
Disappointed to see that you didn't use Meat Clown.
---
I came to dbd from For Honor...honestly I found For Honor more toxic, but mainly because their characters are broken and people exploit that. This game has some broken elements too, but does not seem to be as toxic (personally).
---
Maybe it’s just reddit messing up, but the quality looks really bad.
---
Maybe you can use some of her add-ons to your advantage. No exhaustion perks and blindness.
---
Yeah because it is obviously easier to take off trap when pig is chasing you than save somebody while killer is camping
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/AUzcchj
---
It's almost like on most PTBs they havent listened to any feedback.
---
Killers who are 'Meta' are generally just high-tier in general, like Nurse, Billy, Huntress- but honestly you can make just about any killer work imho if you're good at them and have the right add-ons. This is just my opinion though, and the exception to this is Freddy, as he's honestly just bad because of his power. (But we're supposed to be getting a re-work in the next month.) His power is just too easily countered by Self-Care, which is one of the best perks in the game.
---
As for getting good at Micheal, I would recommend using J. Myers Memorial+Hair Bow. Both are rare Items, so their easier to get in the blood web. I would also suggest getting Doctor in the near future as Monitor and Abuse is the best perk to run on Myers imho besides Hex:Ruin. Monitor and Abuse reduces your terror radius, so he basically doesn't have one in Tier 2. (AKA, the tier you'll be in most the game.) The other one, Hex:Ruin, is just a good way to slow the game down, as it makes it harder for survivors to get gens done quickly. The Plague is also good at this with her Corrupt Intervention perk, as it blocks off three generators at the start of the game and you can't stop it as you can with Ruin. (Any Hex perks can be destroyed by the associated totem being cleansed, so running them is generally a mixed bag.) 
---
BBQ and Chili, Spirit Fury, Brutal Strength, Enduring, Overcharge, Surveillance, Dying Light, Bamboozle, and Nurse's Calling are all great on Myers as well. Nurses/BBQ (Nurse and Bubba respectively) are great for finding Survivors, Spirit Fury (Spirit) and Enduring (HillBilly) are great for eating pallets, which are a survivor's best friend. Brutal Strength (Trapper) is good for quickly breaking pallets and generators. Overcharge (Doctor) and Surveillance (Pig) are good for keeping a lock on Generators. Overcharge makes skill checks on every Gen you've kicked harder, making it more likely they'll blow up the gen, making it easy for you to find them. Surveillance will let you know when a Survivor is working on a Gen after you've hit it by lighting up. This goes on until the Gen is fully regressed. Dying Light is good for slowing down the game completely once the Obsession is dead, and Bamboozle (Clown)  is great for helping end chases quickly by making it harder for Survivors to loop you, as it blocks off a window for 16 seconds after you vault it, or until you vault another window.
---
My last suggestion is to play some survivor as well as killer. This makes it so you can understand the game from both sides. Playing Survivor will help you understand the mechanics of looping a killer, and what they'll look for while they're getting chased.
---
(Also, since your on PS4, I suggest staying away from Nurse. I'm a PC player, but I've heard from a lot of people that she's impossible to play on Console.)
---
Prestiging your killers is good, but personally I only really think it's worth it if you want the cosmetics. Prestidge completely resets the killer when you do it, with the only rewards being increased drop rate for rare items in the bloodweb, and the cosmetics.
---
Good luck in your games!
---
The quality isn’t great, it doesn’t really fit the phone screen I think. I’ll see if I can get a better one
---
Dead hard is nothing to complain about, you just wait it out.
---
The time you gain from dashing to a pallet/window is nowhere near comparable to the distance you'd gain via balanced landing or lithe.
---
for plague just add a rat
---
and for docktor just find a stock image of a docktor that could be fun
---
How does he look I cant find a pic
---
If you also want some nice character icons noob3 has a video linking to some icons made by shenpai. They're all adorable

---
Found the SWF p3 claudette
---
Yes
---
If you run frank's mixtape you can play the "old" legion. Hits deplete the bleed bar by 25%. 
---
With Stab Wound Study they deplete them by 40%, so you need 3 frenzy hits. It's much slower than what it used to be, but it's there if you want to try it.
---
I think they only should show the survivors the killer has NOED when the last gen pops but I think that’s the only thing that should be changed
---
Where’s the map?
---
I hope so ;( The diy vest is such a great idea, I hadn't thought about something like that!
---
They do! They currently require you to hit someone with your power twice (and stun yourself out of the power) so they are pretty weak as of right now.
---
Hopefully they'll get buffed so that you can tag multiple people with broken/mangled/blindness status fast.
---
Yeah I'm guessing it also sucks dick mainly because A. Can only frenzy when bar is full and B. Bar takes longer to fill
---
It'd probably be quicker to just get pallet looped and m1 them lol
---
I love it, makes 4Ks easy.
---
I think that Mclean said that he wishes the stun was 3.5 sec.
---
I screenshoted this mate thank you!
---
Hatchets are fucked on the PTB, they go through survivors and can hit multiple people.
---
Yeah, that single other change that they made.
---
Aye, as I've said it's significantly slower now.
---
It's definitely faster to just chase as regular with 115% ms. I'm just pointing out that it's there! c:

DbD IS life, wdym
---
Sorry? Does having over 4500 hours into this game split between both sides not mean anything? Obviously not to you since you only play 1 side. Unlike you I have an educated opinion on things in the game since I can see things from both ways you ignorant schmuck. But you go ahead and do you. If you feel it's 100% necessary to tunnel people with a trap on their head while they're not doing anything productive, then you do you. See how far you get in the game and how much the community hates you because you're a scumbag.
---
It is, because it doesn't exist in a bubble. If only one Survivor could run it and it didn't synergise with other powerful perks (say by making you exhausted), then it would be fine.
---
Will not exactly common, it is possible for the following to happen:
---
You get unhooked, Killer hits you, this triggers Borrowed Time, last gen pops, this triggers Adrenaline, Killer hits you, you insta-heal, Killer hits you, Killer hits you again, this triggers Mettle of Man, Killer hits you, you go down.
---
For what should have been a one shot down, you just took 5 hits.
---
See how ridiculous that shit is?
---
Honestly it seems strange they have not made a bandaid fix to this, just that if the killer remains near or on the stairway for a certain amount of time they either become ghosted and can be run through, or a hatch spawns in the basement that either lets the survivors escape, or could just spit them out on a random location in the map.
---
don’t touch wattpad do ao3
---
Whispers isn't one of the best tracking perks in the game, we have alot of other options to help track, like bbq and survailance. Most killers dont use whispers this days. Also ruin is kind of necessary for rank 5 or less, because its really hard to win otherwise. Noed is a scummy perk yes, but it does have a counter that makes it useless.
---
Why just not make it so the EGC timer stops when RBT is active?
---
&gt; Buff Huntress by adding oneshot by headshot (high tier killer)   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; The last one better be a bug. 
---
Should be a bug. Since they also go through multiple survivors if you throw it high enough it is possible that this is caused because of two different collision querys.
---
Like: Hitbox of survivor collides with hitbox of hatchet: You get damage, Hitbox of hatchet collides with hitbox of survivor: Hatchet breaks.
---
It seems like the hatchets just dont break and thus they trigger the survivor hitbox again.
---
They are new players, they don’t understand how the game works, i camped like crazy when I first started, I thought the objective was to simply kill people and nothing else, now I know it’s to stop gen progression by killing people.
---
Yes, I'm just pointing out that people were saying she's unplayable because of the change, while the change didn't really affect her that badly.
---
Because most of the players here are casual gamers, that want an easy ride and have no idea what game balance is.
---
If it's a good Nurse the only escape possibility is full OMEGAgenrush survivor squad team or the hatch. Usually I play solo so when I hear a nurse's scream I just pray for a match to end as soon as possible.  
---
Also you can juke her twice but she may have 3 blinks and ur fucked.
---
Make the pig peppa and doctor use john sins
---
You do realise what you are saying happens rarely. This is like the stars completely aligning for this to happen successfully. Never have I ever seen this happen, and I don’t think I will. If this is the scenario which makes MoM OP, I am bamboozled. Unless you can deliver a link to me that shows multiple times it has worked, this scenario is pointless.
---
"Lower your standards as much as possible, and you will never be disappointed."
---
Frame rate loss that doesn’t exist since the engine update ? I’m amazing with her now.

this is the worst meme format :(
---
Use a nurse from silent hill
---
It's greater than zero. My steam account is loaded with games, is very old, and has zero VAC bans. I prefer to keep it that way, but you do you.
---
I do the same, when I plan on maining killer for a few hours, I switch off messages.
---
I am actually sad. I tought the terror radius one was a good change, but I disliked the end game change where her traps don't activate and this doesn't seem to be restored
---
Just see the latest live they did
---
1st DC = 1st perk slot locked for 5 games. Additional DCs within that 5 game period locks additional perk slots, then addon slots, then offering slot, and resets back to 5 games. Every 5 games completed will unlock 1 slot.
---
This and bbq should always be together lol!🤣
---
&gt; everything has a counter
---
Ebony Mori would like to have a chat with you
---
And if you think not getting hooked once or caught after that is a valid counter than I doubt you understand what a counter is.
---
At the same skill level a killer will catch the survivor the vast majority of the time, if someone with a mori decide to tunnel you, you will die and there is nothing you can do about it doesn't matter your perk build.
---
As other mentioned, some thing does have a counter (tunneling DS, BT for camping) but alot of this is situational, some other just plain don't, enlighten me how you are supposed to counter getting flashlight blind when breaking a pallet ? Bloodlusting and losing time on the chase ? as a killer to counter an inconvenience that will lose me 15s at most I should pick the option of just losing a whole minute to get bloodlust 3 and praying for survivor mistake ?
---
I was talking about very top left :)
---
Right? I've read a lot of suggestions and a lot of those ridiculous "killer ideas", and this sub definitely doesn't boast the finest minds of a generation.
---
And you mindgame yourself because he ran straight past a pallet, not noticing it.
---
Well there’s r/DBDgonewild but we don’t talk about that
---
Where is this from? Doesn't look like the alpha of dead by daylight, is it one of those bootleg games?
---
&gt;  the only powerful pink add-on
---
Iri head ?
---
Thats adorably terrifying
---
False. We all know nurse is far too op with enduring, brutal strength, fire up and bamboozle. She needs to be nerfed immediately.
---
Unending Trash Talks?
---
The opposite i think, those are SWF, and ive come across some pain with those

One of the three trophies I have left to get is mori 4 survivors in one match. It's the one I'm stressing over most because people always seem to DC

---
*Vote to kick*
---
yea ! but is chin would be a bit weird without this "3 days" beard.
---
Honestly killers shouldn't even be allowed to move at that point, the game is already over.
---
Hillbilly could be keemstar
---
&gt; high ranks (around 16) 
---
High ranks: red/purple. Low ranks: double digits.
---
That and maybe a Tombstone. Pretty much the only strong pinks.
---
i bet she dropped the pallet.
---
I did not lose many games from a one man mom but a 4 man running it I def feel it. So the only good side of mom as killer is when they have mom they play sloppy and dive at hooks and try to body block. Good luck at 4 man with mom and adrenaline and instant heal med kits. I seen it a few times and it is a nightmare without noed. Seriously how many second chance perks do you need guys till playing killer is pointless. On a side note, DS nerd helped me get way more hooks then usually.  That was a clutch perk and idc how you argue it. Ds nerfed and I get more kills? Shocker.
---
All i know is that claudette was white in the alpha. Never seen this menu before though.
---
God, I hope so.
---
I'm 3 for 3 on suggestions for changes to the game. So far on another account I got hiding killer perks+addons until the end, refunding offerings, items, addons, and canceling 3v1s, and putting a time limit on the end game to prevent mass stalling.
---
Plagg should be No0b3
---
&gt; Step 1: Nerf Legion (low tier killer)
---
Have you played the PTB? Legion was never good unless exploited. He was just unfun to play against. I'd argue that he's better now (but still pretty low-mid tier)
---
&gt; Step 2: Nerf Pig to death unnecessarily (medium to low tier killer)
---
The terror radius was reverted so.. the only 'nerf' was traps not popping heads if the trap wasn't activated which... isn't really a nerf except for the end-game Piggy build which is terrible to begin with (coming from a Pig main). With EGC being a thing, end-game Piggy would be pretty damn broken if heads popped on an unactivated trap.
---
&gt; Step 4: Buff Huntress by adding oneshot by headshot 
---
This is a bug.
---
Never cool to DC. It's annoying for killers and survivors alike to be in a 3v1 because there's certain expectations for farming, DC-ing, etc. but I usually just play as normal until it's made clear that someone wants to farm and then I'm on board. 
---
I was in a game last night where all three of my teammates were hooked in the first 3 minutes and DC'd. Killer started endgame collapse and I escaped. Their loss, honestly, because I had a blast anyway.
---
The David body pillow is everything i need
---
I agree and appreciate your love for Jeff but what kind of Kates do you run into :(
---
"Then what do u want me to run? F***ing Deja-Vu?" - Noob3
---
I'm sorry, but I fail to see how your rely is any kind of criticism or advice for what I suggested. Everything has its strengths and weaknesses.
---
i will be shortly perma banned then,after 4 hours of dbd,being tunneled all the game doesnt feel good. He cant catch me for 4 gens,i get unhooked-borrowed time kicks in,he hits me-last gen done,still looping and then noed and bloodlust catch me. I dont like tunneling,sry
---
well you kind of suck tbh
---
Love the flair 😂
---
&gt; Survivors are already OP
---
Or maybe you're just weak at the game?
---
I agree the game is far more towards the killers
---
Sorry, I see now how this can be abused. Indirectly you helped me see a major a flaw in my suggestion. So I actually thank you.
---
Play fortnite
---
gonna have to disagree
---
Perfection. I laughed so hard
---
Add "Burst" under "Sprint" and we're all good
---
Doctor: https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/WKsAAOSwez5ZygUL/s-l300.jpg
---
Legion really do look like he has told the joke and now is waiting for reaction
---
This is what Behavior fails to understand. They don't know their own game enough to make sensible decisions.
---
With that logic most of the player base would leave. Don't punish the players for problems in the game that they have no control over. Right now there are still random dcs or people that don't make it into the game. You punish them they leave and might not come back
---
 Myers is simple, fun, and effective! Got that major creepy factor when u are stalking someone who has no idea you’re there until you reach tier 2 and they see you staring from a crack in a wall
---
Legion is actually fun now at least.
---
You gotta be high as a kite to think that Surveillance is better than Whispers.
---
You don't need Ruin to do well in the red ranks.
---
If survivor is op, im the best killer to ever exist, i shit on survivors all the time
---
Now, if they only could revert the change that survivors cannot escape with a RBT on their head.
---
I beg you to Iliad the final result
---
Sure, and have it give a BBQ stack for that person (if they didn't already get hooked) while we're at it.
---
In case you missed the Q&amp;A live stream, the pig nerf is being reverted and won't be happening.
---
Don't you see? They're making the game more "Fun!"
---
You say ignoring feedback but what you really mean is ignoring whiny children on reddit constantly posting memes showing how angry they are that their character has undergone balance changes.
---
Games should not be run based on this "feedback". True feedback comes from the masses/actual forums and the statistics that they produce.
---
Legion obviously needed work. Just because a handful of the loudest people start crying does not mean they are ignoring feedback to change him back. it means they are ignoring bias reactionary backlash - as they have a vision for the game, and they should stick to it. Too many games die because they try to run their games based on anonymous experts shouting loudly.
---
Wow!
---
Thanks!
---
*raider thrusts into another game...*
---
Oh sure, getting caught eventually is an inevitability against a decent nurse, but you can at least delay it a little bit with some smart (and lucky) play, and personally I enjoy the mind game of it.
---
Ah...I remember my first week after unlocking Myers too
---
So should I just go for him or do you have any other recommendations?
---
Sorry!

Man, wtf is your problem? "Asia" is the short word for "AuStralIA", and they do have 3 different regions of it in the list. Like ffs, come on.
---
So people are not allowed to like games now?

Demis friend got body blocked for about 3 hours from a mostly afk legion
---
I think op took one too many  palettes to the face and is now at maximum salt.

I thought legion was gonna be getting a huge nerf too but I super underestimated the power of 115 speed, you should try it out on the ptb if you haven't yet :D

---
That wasn’t the point of the post. But people are easily triggered depending on what they main apparently
---
I like Freddy even though he’s not that great simply because you can do some nice mind games during the dream transition where they get brief glimpses of you. But generally yeah, I feel like Myers is always a nice safe pick for a new killer to play as. 
---
You could also learn nurse but survivors will hate you for it lol satisfying to get her range down and start ignoring pallets and windows!
---
Lets break down your list.
---
&gt; F13
---
Actually had and still has a very active player base, the lawsuit stopped the development not DBD's popularity.
---
&gt; Last year
---
It's exclusive on discord store. Discord store, do you own any discord games? No? Neither do I of course it's not going to survive!
---
A game's quality is based on the game, not because DBD is popular.
---
I'm 33 and the majority of the replies I get or see are obviously from people 17 and under and a lot of them seem to be female. That's not a problem i'm just mentioning it because they get super tilted the larger majority of the time.

These are also pretty nice
---
Not with the right add ons. Used to win easily against ranks 1 with Frank's with no moonwalking. And I'm average at killer not a gosu by any means
---
It would make the survivors without RBT on do whatever they wanted to for that time, which is why EQC is a thing, to stop them from it
---
We're still a continent mate. One of the six (habitable) in the world.
---
You'd think we'd have *at least one* server.
---
Meanwhile Asia has three (Seoul and Tokyo aren't even that far away from each other, is it really necessary to have both?).
---
\*cries in ~~hyper intelligent war-mongering~~ emu\*
---
i wasn't arguing, i was venting
---
Wraith should be just a big ass bell.
---
But instead of raping pig, like most people on this fine subreddit have suggested is to heavily slow or stop the endgame timer when the RBT is on their head
---
No at that point the game is more about skill and where the killers and survivors stand no longer decide the game only their actions
---
Its the alpha, if u ever watched the dbd launch trailer u will also see another black female with red clothes, that is originally meg thomas
---
Because it's fairly small and only has 6 clusters of walls very spaced apart + one very simple building, killer shack and two excavators.
---
Most of the map has no line of sight blockers (only counter to Nurse) essentially unless you are in one of the tall wall tiles you can't juke her (since autohaven pallet loops don't hide survivors).
---
Then it's not the only powerful pink add-on. 
---
&gt;which was his point that you conveniently overlooked
---
It just shows that you as well decided to purposefully overlook something to wage in for your argument
---
This game has balance issue , like most online game, and the fact that it is asymmetrical make balancing properly an even harder task.
---
Admitting that some things are way overpowered and completely out of balance is fine, they aren't just gonna make them nerf it into the ground. Admitting that even if you main one side, some stuff of your own side is broken is also ok but you have to realize how things feel when you are on the other end of it, especially if  you wanna talk about what is powerful or not in an asymmetrical game.
---
A tombstone turf hair Myers is broken, but put it in the hand of a bad Myers players or against survivor way more skilled than the killer it become useless, it doesn't makes these addons more fair or balance.
---
Sorry if I got a bit heated, I might have overreacted
---
...No, it doesn’t. It’s a survivor perk.
---
Nerf killers out of the game. Give Survivors a default amount of BP at the end to compensate missing altruistic actions an chase points. DbD will finally balanced....
---
Back to topic. I can't take anyone serious who wants to nerf NOED but doesn't talk about nerfing adrenaline and the 165165165 2nd chance perks.
---
And yes, I am a bad killer - I desperately need NOED.
---
I also want more viable survivor perks, but there aren't enough good perks to run.
---
Did any of these perks came out in the last year?
---
My guess is the headshot thing is a rework for iri head that accidentally got put in.
---
It does feel odd with the new base speed but not bad.
---
i misread the question lmao nevermind
---
Franks is a given, it was a guaranteed win.
---
The devs said themselves that they have acces to match data. They set up a bot that automatically bans people who abuse this. And i have no idea h how it works on console.
---
It's natural selection, better games will stay alive longer, bad ones or unfun ones die out. This is especially true in a niche gaming genre like asymmetrical.
---
They didn’t rape her. And that comes from a pig main.
---
Yes it sucks they did it, but the traps are mostly for stalling, which they still do. There’s no way you could have inactive traps pop with a 2 minute timer, 4 minutes max. Also BHVR has suggested they’re gonna buff pig in other ways
---
Nurse meta is actually to play immersive as possible and avoid chases. Try playing a rank one nurse and you will see why gen rushing gives her a 4k pretty quick. Once they find you, youve got less than a minute till you go down on average, some rank 1s will down you within the first 2 blinks
---
Why not th an play killer then? Or is it roo hard for you?
---
Sprint burst isn’t that great tbh, neither are selfcare or empathy. They’re okay perks but not meta anymore
---
Yeah that confuses me. Sorry 😂
---
Problem I have with this is it makes instadown characters like chainsaw even more high tier compared to the rest of the cast. Meh. I shouldn’t care anymore. Dead by daylight is slowly becoming worse and worse and becoming a game I don’t reach for as often due to all the downgrades instead of upgrades.
---

Legit looks like someone's first try in the map editor
---
Even when the Legion changes were announced but before we saw any of the add-on changes or the Pig changes, there wasn't anywhere *near* the level of negative feedback as when people saw the Pig changes.
---
"Massive amounts of negative feedback" is usually maybe four threads on the subject on the front page. *Every single topic on the front page was bashing the Pig changes* for the last couple of days.
---
It got to the point where I know I was thinking "No point in posting something that isn't Pig related right now, because no one's going to pay attention to it".
---
I’m concerned by the wording. “Can’t stop wearing it”?
---
So, is he being forced to wear it, or is this like a Goosebumps “Haunted Mask” scenario where it physically can’t be removed?
---
Either way, cute that little girl is still playing with him.
---
I wanted to play killer one day. Got 4 Coldwinds in a row. Played survivor instead.
---
I can only imagine that first pic with Dr. Loomis driving the car off a cliff to put an end to this madness... and failing.
---
Probably enjoys 4 man bullying killers but can’t take it when he’s on the receiving end.
---
*Laughs in infinite t3 Myers*
---
This format has been dragged though the mud for 100 miles, died, been dragged for another 200 and died again. Please let it rest in peace.
---
I usually do.  Till I hit rank one. For me it seems like how my fist few games I go tell me if its going to be a day of fun or frustration.  Ill come back. Jumped over to. F13 and already played 2 fun games.
---
Tantrum? No. I read something only a moron would right and I called it out. I’m sorry your brain doesn’t understand software or game development.
---
With a slower Frenzy speed? If anything it should have been increased, so he can run like the devil, deep wound you out the ass and then chase you he feels like, not see someone with Killer Instinct and not even wanna chase them cause they are a bit too far away for their liking.
---
Uhhhhhh
---
I was thinking “You want penis enlargement pills?” when I first saw it
---
I wasn’t trying to be rude.
---
Sorry if it came off as that. Is English your first language?
---
Yes.
---
Man the drama is getting out of hand.
---
I'm usually a rank one killer bro and I rarely ever play swf. Your assumed poorly.
---
Her Terror Radius no longer pauses her traps.
---
they reverted the "reverse bear trap timer stops when within the pigs terror radius"
---
I love the dedicated servers, but why do i still get matched with koreans? the ping was obviously still shit
---
If you think Reddit is bad, then something tells me you've not checked those forums you just recommended.
---
Dont follow tier lists for your main. Play who you like. Best killers are billy nurse and spirit
---
I actually kinada liked the terror radius change. Usually theres only one box in the terror radius, and Pig can see when the trap isnt active. I actually feel like it was a buff because of the information it gives Pig. Especialy with Moniter and Abuse. Why does no onle like the terror radius RBT change? Why was that bad?
---
What does 'farm you off the hook' mean, actually?  Is it when you pull someone off a hook in front of the killer?
---
That's the thing; you can run from a nurse - especially one with 2 blinks - just not as much other killers.
---
I'm not saying you can completely counter nurse, what I'm saying is that you can make chases last longer.
---
Good to see Mask of Madness is good again
---
Come on people. Whats all of your problems. He posted an opinion and all of you just shitted all over him for no reason.
---
you're only having 5 min games??
---
Well, I have Legacy Dwight, Trapper and Claud and I still wanna do it. The icons are not even in a pak file, they are literslly exposed in a separate folder, like they wanted us to access them.. ^(with steam workshop)
---
If you don't want to get face camped, then don't get caught
---
Yo to yo what? I just recently moved to Scotland is it okay if I get the discord link?
---
Thanks for the positive comment!
---
I only became a survivor main because of Ash (okay maybe not main but play a lot of survivor), before Ash I barely touched survivor. Now I got all of his hand cosmetics and p3ed him with all perks. It's quite possible the best thing that happened to me in DBD. I love playing as Ash. Also all of his cosmetics are awesome but especially the wooden hand and Ashy Slashy. (The wooden hand is what he spanks women's ass with)
---
Who do you main?
---
Maybe iron maiden could work. Would quicken the reloading and maybe help if they use lockers to counter BBQ
---
Not on console or the real game its still viable, but it should stay since its hard to hit some1 as nurse to have a 4 sec cooldown because of mom
---
Do the colors mean anything right now?
---
Yes. This is way better.
---
I never saw a post that was so true.
---
Yeah, they said they can’t do nothing about ban ‘cause it’s Sony/Microsoft who dictates that, sigh :(
---
I've seen that exact thing in videos but on ps4 I've never seen a legit hacker
---
&gt;punish altruistic survivors
---
Oh, you mean the people least deserving of a punish?
---
Na I disagree, the legion changes gave just as much negative posts. They were everywhere. So were the posts asking for legion to be nerfed. So were posts about decisive strike. Also once these things catch on in places like reddit people makl new ones for the karma.
---
It is the same pattern but the community soon forgets and moves on to the next trendy thing to hate. The pig posts are the least justified in my opinion due to the fact that it was never about the pig, its just the end game obviously needed a rework. So by all means cry that your killer is getting nerfed – but don’t cry that the game is fixing massive end-game problems – and that happens to slightly affect the current playstyle of the pig (which it is so obvious why). And that they are clearly tracking these changes and tweaking based on how it plays and test feedback.
---
And that's why I saw people playing Legion just with Cold Dirt in PTB. And even with Cold Dirt they said that the fatigue time is too long. With 4 seconds fatigue time, survivors can get to every loop they want.
---
That’s incredibly disappointing
---
It's alright. I mean it is sort of illogical, higher rank = lower number :P
---
˙ɯᴉɥ pǝʞɔǝɹʍ ǝuop noʎ 'uos uɯɐp
---
YOOO same shit happened to me yesterday and i posted similar picture on my profile xD
---
I mean no offense to Trapper but the ability to place down a bear trap isn’t exactly a power...
---
He’s well equipped but I would call him the Batman of the killers
---
So you can use Lithe or Balance Landing for looping him. Good to know.
---
rank suddenly starts to matter when discussions like this start huh
---
Idk wouldnt it be cool if we could see the killer lurking in the background instead, like stalking them fromt he bushes
---
Looks like candle wax Wraith, too!
---
I find it's sometimes a bad idea to run ruin and devour hope, ruin makes them hunt for your hexes.
---
Trapper loops are now a survivors enemy rather than friends. 
---
Note trap around loops and not at pallets for better results. Also trapper needs ruin to stall the game while placing traps other 3 perk slots your choice although nurses, stbfl and enduring do wonder for him.
---
People are only looking at legion’s nerfs he’s actually stronger now (but still low/low-mid)
---
I agree with this, sounds really good
---
Nurse op, better nerf pig
---
Other wise I would be running surveillance or discordance
---
Doesn’t the frame make it impossible to play her well
---
Its currently bugged it actually makes repairing louder (check pain reliever’s videos)
---
Feng waiting for more cosmetics
---
Yeah? They are exaustion perks, they are meant for use in chase.
---
Yeah, I feel that. I switch to killer when survivor gets frustrating, but then killer gets frustrating.
---
Like in real life HEYAAAAA
---
All you have to do is go into their comments and you will find it within a minute easy.
---
No?
---
This is how the Rob Zombie version started. The damn kid was obsessed with wearning a mask 24/7!
---
Yep.
---
Uh correction, I think you meant Mechanic David?
---
KILLERS DC'ED FOUR TIMES AND I LOST FOUR PIPS JUST BECAUSE OF THAT - THANK YOU YOU FCKING GARBAGE GAME
---
Do you want a screenshot or something? I have plenty.
---
Nope. People just play one game and rage. Nurse takes the amount of time to practice as Dark Souls. It may take a week to grasp the game/killer but the pay off is great.
---
Not impossible just hard. Framerate isnt that bad for me and im playing on a day one Xbox
---
Nah ill still say it, survivor is not op at all you just need to stop using trapper with a controller on PC
---
The same could be said about killer perks no?
---
Hi Carl c:
---
at the very end, whatever you did, everything and nothing is a waste of time.
---
If the killer camps do gens
---
Should I just keep playing her no matter how anger inducing it is, and I’ll eventually get better?
---
Upvote this man
---
This is just the player base in general, survivors are just as bad.
---
great now im a bad person for sleeping on the right side of the bed
---
This picture but with nurse
---
Rarity which translates to BP cost.
---
Well after testing them for a while I can already confirm you what has been said in my post. I have 60-70 ping on the servers and hits are still extremely inconsistent, dead hard still needs to be lag compensated, you can lag switch to hit people from 50 meters away and now you can't know how laggy the killer is.
---
Bet they tried to install servers in Australia but the wildlife killed the crew that was supposed to do it.
---
Killers have many Perks and perkbuild which make them strong in combination with their power , but survivors who want to escape most likely take decisive strike, MoM, Exhaustion Perk, adrenaline
---
ever played most RPG games? good guys always on left XD
---
If someone points at a locker or something, and if I open it and find a survivor, I'll down the mini killer, and give the killee the hatch. As a killer I agree, it ruins the game.
---
Is that an tots Elrod mask?
---
Killers that want to get a 4K most likely take BBQ, Ruin, and 2 other chase perks. This logic directly applies to both sides here dude.
---
I have someone accusing me of having one of those just because the rank 16 wasted the pallets... but yeah those survivors are awful. I try to screw them more than the people they are screwing.
---
It's kind of hard right now because we still have the issue of people getting a dc through no fault of their own
---
Smash bros are the only other subreddit not a meme one lol
---
Nurse's is terrible on Plague and on every 32m TR killer without M&amp;A
---
I don't blame people who stuck in the infinite loading screen or getting kicked out, cuz of crashes or other weird shit...
---
But people who insta dc, cuz they get downed in the first minute of the game, cuz they are bad... those people are annoying af...
---
That's true, but for a spirit main, it's all the info they need ;)
---
As a pig main, wholeheartedly agree. 
---
As a long time overwatch player/OW subreddit goer, vast majority of player suggestions for balance are terrible. 
---
That being said, give pig an instadown comparable to headshot huntress change. Balanced? No it's probably a terrible idea but I wantssss it, precious.
---
F13 is objectively shit. Packanack rooftop party anyone?
---
Sadly, I am not looking forward to play the new Legion.
---
Not even if they are bad either sometimes it's luck. But why leave? You got downed the first minute so what your game isn't over
---
*Laughs in Phantom of the Opera Wraith and Victorian Doctor*
---
Kate is best girl, and no one can change my mind 🥰
---
Hell, sometimes you have to dc because of stupid ingame glitches. A few weeks ago, my friend got stuck inside a generator and couldn't get out. I have also been stuck in trees on the autohaven map and the killer refused to down me. They would seriously need to fix their bugs if they were to enforce this which I doubt will happen.
---
I enjoy to play killer mostly because I don't like staring at gens and dealing with shit survivors. Plus I like the feeling of overcoming a challenge .  I'm not a disturbed person. My friends who are killer mains are also nice bros. Logic like yours is the reason governments go after games.

But I bet BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, and Spirit Fury would be much more successful than everything else u mentioned. You *really* don’t get it do you? If this doesn’t ring a few bells, nothing will.
---
Can you give us your source(s) about hit detection? Because if you have official explanations about how servers work I would be glad to read it :)
---
Devs must indeed bring back the ping indicator for each lobby player. Because even if your ping is fine with servers that's maybe not the case for everyone so knowing if people are going to lagg or not is a NEEDED information. If all players have the same ping towards servers, there should be, at least in theory, NO weird hitboxes since everybody is "lagging" the same way.
---
Overall dedicated servers should improve our gameplay experience, people ragequiting everymatch will be easily tracked and banned, it should be (in theory...) easier to match people with the same ping making the weirds hits less frequent.
---
Also dedicated servers are also a good way for Devs to add new features easily: 
---
- a "rematch" button for example if you liked playing with the previous killer/survivors,
---
- Immediatly get back with our SWF team without inviting them again
---
- etc...
---
Well, an invisible Wraith would be nice
---
Yup, you just made me jizz.
---
I had this one match where both myself and the other last Survivor were hiding waiting for the other to die since we had both found the hatch. I had Aftercare on so we could see eachother across the map. When I eventually got found out by the Killer I ran full speed towards the other guy and started pointing furiously in his direction. The Killer thought it was so funny he let us both go.  
---
Neither of them thought it was toxic.
---
Sounds cool but would be impossible to balance
---
I am 40. My 20 or so people I play with are  with in DBD are all over 35.
---
Just the average game at around rank 4 :)
---
Why you keep repeating me instead of discuss with me?
---
Thx for sharing your sources :) I'm glad to have Devs info about test servers :)
---
Because that’s my point. Everything you just said can be said against you therefore it is pointless. Your argument has no strength.
---
if a Survivor doesnt eskimo kiss my nose they will stay on each hook until i finish my gen. #GensBeforeNonEskimoKissingFriends
---
Like the first commenter this is just too much to balance it, and not gonna lie the Nea ability sounds OP as fuck if you ran lightweight with it too lol the killer would legit never have a chance to see your footsteps on the ground
---
Hopefully it can be bought with shards

---
There's no "professional level" in this game.
---
This game is too RNG and has too many crutch perks and strats to be considered a viable "competitive" game.
---
Every time I see somebody mention these type of terms and wording such as "competitive" or "professional" I have a chuckle.
---
This game is a fun casual experience and nothing more. Ranks mean jack shit.

It’s not 10 games in a row common at all. Out of 10 games I’ll be facecamped once. Maybe twice on a bad day.

I always get the same two maps in a row, then another two in a row. It's odd.
---
The "special edition" is just the name of the console release, so there is no other version on consoles. It includes the base game and some content that was already released on PC when the console version launched. That means, the PS4 version includes the "Spark of Madness" chapter (killer: Doctor, survivor: Feng Min) and "Of Flesh and Mud" (killer: Hag, survivor: Ace Visconti), which are both paid DLC on PC.
---
In my opinion, the game is definitely worth 30$, but you should watch some gameplay to make sure it's a game for you. It's very confusing at first but it becomes more and more fun as you'll get the hang of it. You need a bit of a frustration tolerance sometimes, but the it's a lot of fun. Regarding a sale, I think you just missed one on the US PSN, so it might be a while until it gets discounted again.
---
Nurse's is good with stealth killer or killers with a lower terror radius. They are Pig, Wraith, Micheal, Hag and Spirit. The countering is to heal only outside TR so if your terror radius is invisibile they won't know when healing.
---
You cant hack on ps4 thats why.
---
mid-tO-LoW TiEr? whaaat?
---
You can run whispers since huntress sucks at tracking. Personally I suck at using whispers so I use sloppy butcher, helps out with nurses
---
We all have mind blanks.
---
no but you can get nurses just by lvling up ur nurse. its not a killer you don't have, it would be a waste of shards
---
Goes to show effective clutter is at hiding visual flaws, like tiles.
---
that picture is hilarious

I'd recommend Pig, but Spirit is best out of the 3

Trapper should be the one from Samination's videos - or for funnier, use the new Crapper
---
Ds is good now, even from a killer perspective. If you get hit with Ds its your own fault. Tunneling is unfun and its good that there is a perk that discourages doing so.    
---
MoM however is a badly designed crutch perk that affects low-tier killers more so than high tier ones. You won't see a Hillbilly or Nurse complain about MoM. But outside the top 3 killers, MoM is just another second chance crutch for survivors that they really don't need when they're against a wraith, doctor or freddy, etc. 
---
How the perk is used also contributes to why killers don't like the perk very much. You have to take a bunch of hits before you get to use MoM. So unlike the old Ds, you can't "get it out of the way early" as one entitled survivor told me. No, MoM almost always comes into play towards the end of games when there are few generators left and you need to end chases quickly. Used in combination with exhaustion perks, most of the time the survivor has a free escape. 
---
If MoM was an exhaustion perk itself, then fine. But because you can combine it with any of the other second chance perks, insta heals and whatever AND it only targets low tier killers, makes it a bad perk and I don't think its good for health of the game.
---
maybe this for wraith? https://i.warosu.org/data/cgl/img/0068/68/1369782240614.jpg
---
She's almost universally rated lower than Nurse, Billy, Huntress, Spirit, Hag, and Plague.
---
She's also almost universally rated higher than Cannibal, Doctor, Trapper and Wraith. And Freddy and New Legion are both dumpster tier.
---
Often the decision comes down to where she sits around Michael and Clown, and with 0 end game potential any more, she probably falls to the bottom of that group.
---
So yeah, probably better to say somewhere right in the middle, but significantly worse off as of the PTB.
---
Honestly, now that I watched some gameplay of him, he doesn't seem to be all that bad
---
Probably, lol
---
What? I’m sorry this made literally no sense. You obviously don’t understand what I’m saying here and I’ll just leave it at that unless you actually tell me something compelling.
---
If you go against a full swf without ruin, i doubt you'll do well, also i do think survailance is way better than whispers. It helps you keep track of gen progress and helps you find where survivors are.
---
She's decent, many killers are better. She is just below clown IMO.
---
Od that was me I felt loved and special so don’t feel bad.👓❤️
---
I got my deranged by literaly bringing dead body to other survivors then stabing them like most insane person in whole game. They pretty much assumed I was farming bp and stand still next to each other.Was possible to get 1-4 stacks per match. For last 8 I just asked them via DM if they can just help me do it by standing next to each other. Not worth trouble doing it now, before rework thou.
---
Yes give her more than the 5 addons she has now!
---
As a survivor teammate, I hate it, but as a killer who gets worked pretty often by survivors, I enjoy it a little bit when someone DCs on me, like they're not confident they can give me a bad time so they just want out.
---
Yesterday playing huntress (spoiler alert: I'm bad), after the third person DCed on hook while I was carrying the 4th, I walked over to a generator to let them wiggle out and do it so they could have hatch, but they decided to DC too.
---
Calm down. Hes talking about how you can effectivly use the mini wispers. How that factors into his game plan during a match is up to him. No one said you have to tunnle the trapped person. Add something to the disscusion. I have no clue how you feel about the change by your comment.
---
That’d be a dope outfit for watch dogs 3

I REALLY DISLIKE THE NEW WAY LEGION VAULTS PALLETS, IT FEELS SO SLOW AND UNLIKE THE IDEA FOR THE KILLER, LIKE SHIT, UNLESS YOU'RE USING IRIDESCENT BUTTON MIGHT AS WELL JUST BREAK THE PALLETS OUTSIDE OF FRENZY. AND WHY DOES IT HAVE TO MAKE THE VAULT SOUND AT THE START OF IT AND NOT CONTINUE TILL THE END, LIKE IT RUINS THE WHOLE FEEL OF VAULTING THE PALLET

Like the way you said it is just *weird.*

Ok. But you can’t nerf her lol. She’s already hard asf to use
---
Jim Varney as the Beverly Hillbilly
---
Why is this more common and common? Ruins the game for everyone. 
---
I get it if it's something no one can control like shitty connection or servers, it's all happened to us, but why deliberately? People are genuinely "opting out" of playing the game, when the game is going as it is intended. No survivor is invincible. Most likely, each one is going to get caught and hooked at some point. Even if they get caught early on, that sucks, but they still have a few chances. And even if you die, you still get points and shit in the end, so what does it matter? I don't get why people play this game just to 'not' play the game.
---
AND DIVEBOMBING A HOOK WITH THE KILLER ON YOUR ASS IS A GOOD WAY TO GET BOTH SURVIVORS DEAD, ESPECIALLY IF THAT KILLER IS A HAG WITH A TRAP BEHIND THE HOOK, LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING, STOP GIVING THE HAG A FREE GRAB
---
ye, really glad the cool down add ons got nerfed and the vault Speed is on the level of a slow vault
---
Yeah, it is a problem at any rank.

What makes that match even funnier is that the first guy ran Object of Obsession. If you can't handle getting downed then don't run that shit, lol.
---
Dead by Daylight: The Hero Shooter
---
What I was trying to say is:
---
In the last 5 DLCs were 3 good survivor perks and 8 good killer perks.
---
When this happens, look back over the most recent seen scratch marks and make sure they didn't double back on you. If they doubled back the scratches will be scrambled, if they aren't look around behind near by obstacles ot the nearest pallet or jungle gym because you got juked but they're not far. They'll be walking or crouching slowly so look down in shadows and grass.

I was saying this since I heard about changes for the first time lol

I think with these people it's less about justifying toxic behaviour and more about the fact that they can be rude without social repercussions due to the anonymity of the Internet.

Oh... that makes it easier lol. Thanks. Well it’s not like Pop Goes is that great. These perks you listed are very subjective in general. Almost all of these perks aren’t seen very often.
---
Ill run noed in builds. Ruin if I feel like its a swf. I like to mix and match perks and have fun with the game. Something alot of players forget to do.
---
THE FLASHLIGHT ONE IS ACCURATE
---
I play a ton of Spirit. Nurse's Calling is locked in my build. It's so good. It's your key to snowballing the match.
---
Yes and probably.
---
I don't get it either. Hopefully with dedicated servers leavers will get a timeout or something.
---
Im at rank 1 and i See all of these perks very often
---
Well I can’t change your experience nor can I change what Survivors or Killers put their perks as but the point still stands. The power of perks on both sides is equal.
---
It's a god tier perk for Spirit, especially if you have Sloppy.
---
Wraith is your bae, just admit it
---
Rank 3 actually. Been playing Mk11 the past few days and dbd is not really on my mind. Whispers is literally a perk for lower ranks. The irony is pretty thick.
---
If I remember the vault needs sync to look more smooth but omg I love it. No more over shooting. The cooldown add-ons need some more work but omg with the sketch add-ons together it is 70 meters and 14 seconds.
---
I like the idea of passive abilities. However i hate the idea there can only be one survivor. If i want to play ace but someone picks my main im gonna be upset.
---

---
Nope, not lag switching. But it is negativity bias.
---
For some reason bhvr decided that pig's addons should hurt her more than help her
---
I imagine the cool down add ons were nerfed to compensate for the legions increased movement speed
---
I dont think 3 equals 8 😂
---
And also take a look at the worst perks in the last year: survivors get windows of opportunity and boil over 😂
---
Power.
---
Might I recommend changing the shape to a really bad Myers mask?
---
Yep Joe
---
Yeah. They prefer to accidentally leak upcoming content.
---
I don’t think it should be binded to; Oh he’s fun and he’s not. Changes should be made to flex onto the health of the game. The Pig nerfs are a great example of a bad example.
---
Bbq does not mean you're bad at tracking, tracking is extremely difficult for most killers. Many pallets are unable to be mindgamed, and we all know respecting pallets means that you lose.  None of those perks are OP.  The only problem with MoM is that it makes basic m1 killers worse, and even then it only comes into play once per game, without wasting nearly as much time as old DS.  The only stupid perk in the game I feel right now is NOED.  If you are bad at putting on pressure and prioritizing, you use NOED.
---
On the new ptb if u select the legion, it would change the theme to his one
---
I wish Pig would get better add-ons just so that she would be worth prestiging. Right now it's a bad idea to prestige Pig just because that means less Combat Straps.
---
Wow, I’m sorry but that was a lot of talking about nothing. You mention “bigger picture” without making clear what that was. Because it just seems like they’re bending over backwards to protect the status quo. 
---
First, I need to say something: once the final generator is finished there is very little the Killer can do in terms of counter play. The gate boxes are absurdly soft targets and once they’re open, even if you’re running endgame perks, there’s almost nothing a Killer can do stop survivors from getting out. It’s why a lot of Killers face camp at endgame: the person on the hook is a more defendable objective than anything else on the map. It’s an incredibly frustrating experience for Killers and it happens almost every game. A lot of Killers would rather the game just end with the fifth generator. “Pig traps are unfair because they give survivors almost no chance?” That *is* the Killer endgame experience. 
---
So when Killers heard endgame changes were coming, they rightly hoped it would give them some sort of counter play (not advantage; just counter play). But what we’re getting provides none of that. The timer doesn’t start until a door has been opened, when escape is ten feet away. There is nothing in the endgame collapse that makes that door more defensible. It just encourages survivors to leave, not even in a hurry. I know you’re going to say, “Well, that’s the point,” but I need to make this clear: it’s not a very good point. 
---
On top of that, Killers seem to be losing more than they are gaining. Nerfs to Remember Me, nerfs to the Pig. Thank God they reverted the door timers. All so this mechanic — which, as far as I can tell, only exists to curb the behavior of toxic survivors — doesn’t impede survivors “fair chance” to escape. Hatch standoffs? If the survivor gets to the hatch first they have a 100% chance to escape. If the Killer gets there first he then has a 50/50 chance to guess which door the survivor is going. But that’s “fair?”
---
Again, this isn’t about giving Killers the advantage: it’s about giving them *counter play.*
---
Nope, he could grab them before, but they removed it (unless they changed it back again)
---
Oh shit, asking the real questions.
---
I also need to know this now
---
Pig can be Peppa Pig
---
Probably because most other games have their own servers, where as DBD is peer to peer currently, and your probably getting matched with someone with bad internet or are far away.
---
New iridescent add-on: 
---
Voice distorter - ambush roars and red stain are removed while dashing
---
Rule set no.3 - key to rbt is actually placed in a random box, no more coin flips each time. 
---
Serrated blade - ambush attacks instadown 
---
Plz BHVR
---
Yeah you're right but noed has the easiest counter of all, so it's not that bad 😂
---
I just wish people actually try the changes before crying about them
---
Well just for future reference Michael uses a kitchen knife as seen there while uses a tactical knife or a karambit or broken ruler if your drawing joe or susie 
---
Not saying you should, you can do what ever you want but if your trying be “Lore friendly”
---
I suggest maybe trying bloodhound and see if that works or even predator. Test those out and see if you can track better.
---
Give the Huntress a picture of Bugs Bunny in Drag
---
So if it’s a UE the whole game not contributing while everyone is dying  you’re still going to kill the messenger?
---
Disgusting...
---
All my afk survivor games the killers take advantage of the afks, this whole mini killer topic is minimum compared to the mass killers that take advantage of afk’s.
---
What’s worse they let the Afk’s get the hatch while everyone is dead by the time the afk decides to rejoin the group. 
---
Mini killers is not as common as the above so if you get a survivor ratting someone out,  why not investigate before being a ultra toxic butt?
---
Hahaha, people have to pay extra for Ace? I got that for free on PS4.
---
That’s their excuse, shes hard to play as,
---
I can confirm you can close hatch after a survivor opens it. It reopens when there is one survivor left but you can reclose it. No idea if it starts EGC if opened with key and then shut, I assume so.
---
This is a good post. I hope the devs see it and consider reworking some of Pig’s add ons, because you’re right, most of them are worthless. I actually think the core of her power is fairly solid, even with the end game rework, but better add ons would give her a push in the right direction.
---
Groovy
---
*cough cough* Coldwind and Backwater Swamp
---
Experienced survivors can see Wraith's shimmer from a mile away and immediately move to the nearest pallet. He has little stalling and his power doesn't help him much in the actual chase. The ability of Legion to keep all survivors injured at almost all times puts him a fair amount ahead of Wraith in my eyes.
---
Maybe but either up thêm by like point 05 for the non rare ones and point 2 for the rare one or lower the base stun by point 5.
---
This is how merciless killers IRL are born.
---
you answered your own question. the point of it is not to get ez kills, hence why things are being nerfed to balance it out.
---
but with all due respect, you can't complain about killers getting a raw deal. survivors have seen nothing but nerfs for the past year (mostly necessary) whilst killers have been getting buffed quite regularly. this is the first time killers have got the short end of the stick in a long time.
---
that being said, i think the pig changes are kinda gross
---
Yeah stun probably should be reduced with stun-related addons being unstackable
---
I’ve read this sentence three times and answer is, “Dear God, it really should be.” It should be next to impossible to save a survivor when the Killer is two feet away. Certainly harder than getting saved while the Killer is chasing someone else, finding a box, getting lucky, and getting to the gate before she finds you.
---
It should show up under your profile options under change your flair or something like that and every Reddit community is different and may or may not allow it, I’m on the phone app so I just click on my profile so it may be different for you.
---
Considering that everytime they listen the game goes to shit, its safe to say that this community is braindead
---
Thank you so much!!!
---
If you look at the stats on prestiging, people have looked into it extensively. It's like 1% of a difference across add on tiers. Plus Pig is one of the only killers that gains a cosmetic advantage through prestige as her bloody cosmetics are far less visible than her bright red coat, very valuable when being a snekky piggle.
---
Make wraith's opacity 60%
---
That part your assuming on is the part that I really want to know, I also assumed that killer could close after a key opening, but the EGC part is the kicker.
---
Really situational, but still
---
I agree with this. It would be cool to have a little more diversity among the characters so you don't get stuck with 4 Megs in a match, but at the same time, I'd be lost without using Dwight. I have his loadout set perfectly, and can always have decent matches with him. Everyone else... Eh. I could just get them the same perks he has, but I don't really want to waste my stuff on that. Plus with the way I have Dwight customized, he's easy to hide from the killer with.
---
Will say though, usually in matches I never see more than 2 people pick the same characters. Very rarely do I find a match with 3 of the same, and 4 usually happens with playing with friends as something to laugh at.
---
Thank you so much!!
---
2v8
---
You can use FF for tracking, thats not bad
---
shroud got a skin in the game??
---
I was just drawing from memory. Didn’t have a reference at the time. Sorry it’s not accurate
---
Yeah another good point, we've all seen GlenOck's stats. Why make her power so heavily weighted against her, with HALF of all traps being removed on the first box. She's designed to buy herself time, and getting fucked by RNG just ruins your game in a way completely uncontrolled by you.
---
Yes, yes and yes. 
---
Say 4 gens done and 3 survivors left so the hatch spawns. One uses a key to jump in. If the killer finds the hatch they can either stand on top of it until it closes again and the game continues as normal or they can close it which powers the Exit Gates and triggers the EGC for the last 2 survivors.
---
Yeah would be cool, have to be done with the dedicated server but would be extremely fun having two killers.
---
Wow I have 1k hours and just assumed that it would affect it more. I guess a little research could have helped.. guess I'll be prestiging my Pig then!
---
Maybe like 10% of the time. Most people can’t use her that well, so she shouldn’t be nerfed
---
Holding a stick with your left arm doesnt make you left handed...
---
Using it reactively can be pretty unreliable. It's better to use pre-emptively to get yourself to a safe spot that you know you won't make otherwise. 
---
I've seen people use it to save their ass against a nurse lunge, billy's chainsaw, or a hatchet throw, but again it's touchy.
---
Hey carl dont go to r/funny, they dont deserve it.
---
And now you’re just being insulting. Not even the pretense of a point. 
---
But tell you what, with the endgame timer reduced to two minutes I am open to compromise: have it so trapped survivors are treated like downed survivors and cause the timer to slow down. That gives survivors a maximum of four minutes to get their traps off. Considering the active trap timer is only two minutes and that’s enough time to heal and check all four boxes I think that’s a very fair time limit. 
---
But I need to be clear: any solution that allows a survivor to walk out of a trial with with a death trap on their head with zero consequences is a nonstarter. It is an absurdity.
---
Bro, the Hillbilly definitely meeds to be Jed Clampett
---
Doesn't really seem like that big of a deal. Even less so because it is on the test server. Also, that Huntress is lookin' *fresh.*
---
The torture scene from A Clockwork Orange for Doc?
---
laughs in ewt3 myers lunge range
---
Dwight's is cool as it introduces a new mechanic for our limited point and wave gesture options. Would be amazing if our pointing actually highlighted something or gave people signals for what to do/where to go.
---

---
It's kinda like old ds. It's frustraiting to play against and rewards bad play.
---
Hi Carl
---
It isn’t a coin flip
---
McLean himself said it’s random which box gets picked when you put the trap on
---
It just clicked on why he's Daddy
---
Those losers need somewhere to take their real life anger out on someone lol
---
the vault is slower than s Survivor vault (nerfed by 25%)
---
And the Max distance is 50 meters after what the Devs said in the Q&amp;A
---
You must have been playing against me, haha.
---
But in all seriousness, I'll give you my secrets. When running from a killer, if I see a rock or obstruction with a bunch of stuff behind it, I run in a certain direction to make it look like I ran behind the rock or other object and into the walls/building/etc. When in reality, I just duck once I reach a certain point behind the rock so the killer doesn't see me do it, and then I crouch walk around the rock as the killer runs right past me as they think I ran to the walls/building/etc. And then once they're past me, I just reverse follow the same path I took to get there, so when the Killer sees the scratch marks, they just think it's the ones they followed to get there.
---
Works pretty well.
---
No0b3 is nowhere near close to Ochido levels of toxicity though.
---
Amanda’s Letter should reduce traps by 2, boxes by 1. And significantly increase ambush speed and cooldown
---
that might be the intention, but the way it is right now, you still have a 4 Second stun, which basically makes them pointless
---
&lt;laughs in Doctor&gt; &lt;laughs a lot in Doctor&gt;
---
On the stream they said if a survivor has a trap on their heads already on their heads before the last generator is finish the trap will still kill them if they leave through the exit gate.
---
LOL you sound like a P3 Claudette who runs around in circles instead of doing gens.
---
the shape of my dick 
---
is hard
---
Yeah no they bring an ebony mori and *ULTRA RARE* offering and they’re sweaty when it’s a 3v1?
---
Maybe they ran behind stuff and urban evaded away? Scratch marks last for 10 seconds so yea /: It has to be something else.
---
They changed it again in a ptb update
---
It's pretty fun to generalize ain't it you cock?
---
Maybe not but creatively this sub is great
---
a year ago I heard an idea of a FNaF Chapter (ew) but the power was leaving its animatronic behind and fast travel around the map and appearing where it stops. Few months later we got The Spirit.
---
I think Bamboozle was even pitched here before Curtain Call
---
Right, my change allows traps to be put on after the 5th gen, but before Endgame Collapse occurs. Currently traps put on after the 5th gen are worthless.
---
I wish to sacrifice Carl
---
It is only game, why u have to be mad
---
This is how it's been on ps4 past few days.. killers either camping or tunneling... good thing I started using ds and dead hard... shit is getting old.
---
You likely did one of the following:
---
Destroyed their Hex Totem
---
Destroyed a Dull Totem
---
Looped a Pallet
---
They caught you working on a Gen
---
You pallet stunned them
---
You made them respect a pallet
---
Made them miss their Hatchet Throw
---
Made them miss their M1 attack
---
A Gen got completed during the chase
---
You used Dead Hard
---
You managed to 360 them
---
You vaulted a window
---
You tea bagged or emoted
---
I hate ochido so much, I hate pedophiles in general

This is a trouble ticket entry form. Before you enter a ticket, make sure you reported them via the in-game option on the match ending screen. That is used as a flag for them to identify the person.

Killer closing hatch opened with a key or not will trigger the EGC

---
&gt; no more coin flips each time.
---
but they are placed randomly. each rbt a, b, c, d &amp; e (if you have extra traps) have their keys assigned to boxes 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5/6 (with extra boxes)
---
Annnnnnd we found a douchebag killer who does this regularly.
---
That didn't take long
---
It's not like there is a terror radius to warn you anyways
---
The better idea would be playing the theme of whatever killer you chose last(the one that appears in the main menu).Since Trapper,Wraith and Billy don't have any special music they would play the default,and the others would play their special songs.
---
The exception is whena new chapter gets released,the new theme song would play until whenever they decide to stop it
---
LOL that’s basically why this happened to me. I was on a gen with a claud minding my business and VROOM VROOM here comes huntress 😂😂 i’m not even mad it was actually kind of funny

Damn that shit sucks
---
I wouldnt mind the nerf for legion if it werent for 1 thing the if you miss it turns off I mean its called **feral frenzy** for a reason
---
Everything you just said is a valid complaint. Just because you have perks to "counter" it doesn't mean your complaint isn't valid. Tunneling makes the game not fun and most times infuriating, even if you have those perks. Gen rushing is a valid complaint because it makes the game not fun and most times infuriating. You get my point. The game should be fun and fair no matter what and that's why, right now, all these complaints are valid.
---
The PTB does not differentiate players as much as the real game, so you get lower, more toxic people more frequently after they are done playing around with the new features. 
---
Using items doesn’t matter, so you get people going all out and sweaty builds when they get bored. 
---
To me, it is nothing I don’t see with Rank resets.
---
The same has been happening to me since the 23rd. I live in the Caribbean and I’m been send a lot to south american lobbies with a latency of at least 200+. I figure that it has to be because there’s a lot of players trying out the new servers.
---
2v8 would favour the survivors way more. 2v6 would be much better. Killers can't put pressure on the remaining 6 survivors if that would happen.
---
Personally I enjoy going against Nurse. As long as they don't run Ruin.
---
Or addons.
---
Or NOED.

Uh...

That's your prerogative, but I'm just saying the risk is there.

Yeah. The timer is also good but if survivors are dicking around it is slow, imo
---
That's neat, I actually thought it was intended so it was kind of strange to read "they fixed it"
---
Did you watch DBD’s latest Q&amp;A video on YouTube? They’re just testing the servers, this isn’t the final product. They’re aware of the issue. If it’s really that big of a problem, then just go back to the live servers and be done with the PTB.

i like it
---
People don't seem to like playing him too much on console, but I main Trapper. Took a while to get good with him, but now I set traps in specific places and let them do all the work for me. From this I can just relax and play the game, versus stressing a bit. 
---
As something different, I play Huntress from time to time. She's not as fun, but I feel like she's easy to play as. 
---
Wouldn't worry too much on which Killers are "best." Just focus on who you like to play as and improve over time. Like I mentioned, most people gave up on playing Trapper and making him worthwhile, I loved using him, and now I do very well in matches as Killer.

Yep. The killer hooks you and they run up and immediately unhook you, terror radius still in full swing.
---
They're annoying, but at the same time, it's just another way of playing the game. Usually if I'm hooked and they do that to me, I just accept myself as the sacrifice and hope everyone is working on a gen. I still get points in the end, so I'm not entirely upset.
---
What you just said proves my point. Everyone has a valid reason to whine and cry. We make up these guidelines or rules that we're supposed to follow but most times they're are one sided. This game should be fun and fair no matter what. We shouldn't be the ones that make up these rules l, that's the devs responsibility. We should stop telling each other "no being toxic" and start telling the devs "fix this sh*t." The community cannot be the ones that make of the rules, that's why the dead by daylight community is so toxic.

No but you dont get it, if that was you in the game against me as leather face i would legit follow you in an open field and see scratch marks vanish, you legit lost me in an open field once because you walked behind some tyres, i know you were there looked directly at the only place you could be adn you were gone, as if you were running with sprint burst speed but leaving no marks......

Always
---
When I searched 'prestige' I found this as well! Pig is the only character that I have held off on Prestiging. And double BP coming soon? This is exciting news.
---
It *isn’t* about “easy kills.” It’s about counter play. They’re removing a weaker Killer’s counter play to make it easier for survivors to escape. Even if she would have gained an advantage, given her present situation there’s no proof to suggest it would have made her OP.
---
Thanks mi amigo
---
They are the survivors. The game is about them, they can leave if they are losing and stay when they are winning and teabag. Check yourself before you wreck yourself cisrole-scum.
---
Petition to add a second hatch incase the survivor has to alt tab for 3 minutes and the killer finds the hatch.
---
It's all chance... just because that happens doesn't mean it's true. You get lucky and go to the right box. You literally cannot test chance like that when there is a 20-25% chance you are right. If the odds were 10% you could check more accurately, but then you could also be guessing right.
---
i think 2v8 would be better for balance
---
Sometimes it's easy to tell the difference though. Most times I got booted out I wasn't being chased or hooked or anything, just walking or on a gen. Plus most times I would DC because of shitty connection, it was right in the beginning, before any chases. Not to say this is how it goes for everyone, but it becomes a little more obvious when everyone does it right when they're downed and being picked up.
---
But you do have a point.
---
what fascinating content
---
Lol what a freak *flickers flashlight with macro*
---
Stop falling for the very obvious bait
---
Yes please! We wanna see the finalized version :D
---
Gl!
---
Survivor blinks through discord and has full voice connection to all of her teammates and knows if nurse is coming or not.

Great for our favorite plague.
---
FUCKING WHAT. WHY.
---
Jukes. Learn to ignore pallets and windows and juke around obstacles to break LoS
---
it’s almost like the placement doesn’t matter
---
1.) these jokes are old and tasteless
---
2.) the only major nerf to Legion is if you are scummy and moonwalk, I’d argue with his new and improved speed he is more fun to play and better overall
---
I mean looping and pallets are just buying time, unless you do some god tier maneuvers it’s unlikely you will lose the killer without any exhaustion perks. The killer should have the advantage in a chase, but face amping is unsolvable without banning it, if somebody is willing to throw away a game to piss off one person, what can you really do about it,
---
I've made it perfectly clear what the bigger picture is. It is fixing the end game so that it cannot be exploited and to have concrete win conditions? Please reread my reply.
---
So much of what you say is biased to only mention the things affecting killers. You cannot see past this. Please compare the killer gameplay individually then compare the survivor gameplay individuyally - write down the perks of each then come back. It is impossible to discuss this with someone who only mentions or even discusses the things affecting a killer, particularly 1/15 killers.
---
“Pig traps are unfair because they give survivors almost no chance?” - nobody is saying this. It is not about the pig. 
---
I can't explain anymore how game exploits and glitches are more important than your favourite playstyles.
---
&gt;I know you’re going to say, “Well, that’s the point,”
---
No of course that isn't the point. The problem is people like you thinking this is the point. Pushing survivors out is something the killer needs to do to secure kills in the end game. You think in such a simplified manner..
---
These changes needed to happen for the overall health of the game. I don't know how you think it is acceptable for a game to last an unlimited amount of time.
---
good to see joey getting some love(and a good skin, imo at least)
---
rename it Quickstrike or Haste
---
showed my boyfriend your comment and we couldn’t be laughing any harder 😂
---
Get hit three times is considered bad play?
---
8 on both but I play SWF with a person who's 16 and I don't get it with yellow rank killers either.

on every killer with 32m TR*

Still not a counter.

Perfect. I wanna do mine all spongebob themed now brb

It sure as hell isnt considered good play

---
No, the community is the reason for the "dark times." Everyone is toxic to each other and it's because the devs won't fix the game. I'm saying that everyone has a valid reason to whine and cry; this is because of all the toxicity out in the game. Tunneling is toxic and make the game not fun and most times infuriating. Pallet looping is not fun and most times infuriating.
---
I mean if someone isn’t a asshole just because they feel like it or being ahole in general, it’s pretty easy to gain us killers favour
---
Freddy obviously needs to be Sharp Hand Joe.
---
It may not be an « official » counter like pallets and windows are to other killers but its still one of the main ways to evade a nurse.
---
No, it's the Crapper.
---
Headshot huntress is a bug, because there is literally no mention of that change in any of the PTB patches.
---
Simple solution: charge 10k bloodpoints to DC via the menu.
---
Just increase the timers for gens to be balanced around anywhere from 3 to 4 people working on them.
---
Plus if it was 2v8 that is 2x as many pallets gone which applies significant pressure since it means that there are less safe areas.
---
Well I mean it's really mind over matter, nothing's just going to make you stop camping.  With that in mind from my experience BBQ has helped me get away from that hook as soon as I can. It let's me know where someone else is so I spend more time in a Chase rather than looking for survivors.
---
Ah, I have a perfect image for the doctor but I’m on mobile
---
ooooh that's a good plague pic!
---
The Spirit: https://imgur.com/gallery/jy40n4g
---
Did a new skin come out for Kate ?
---
That's what the base kit stun increase was for
---
Tip: you’ll get way more points by applying map pressure and getting in multiple chases then just camping a hook. Not to mention you completely ruin the game for the survivor.
---
Yeah, if the survivor is destroying you it’s your own fault for not abandoning the chase. There’s no reason for being outplayed being “toxic”, the survivors goal to the survive by any means, included flashlight saving and alike if they are obviously tee bagging you at a pallet not just a single tap of their crouch, or glitching in any way, I’ll accept some camping.
---
If someone should get nerves it's the doctor. He's annoying as fuck.
---
Already posted it here, died in new.
---
That's a part of the memey-charm of it.
---
What's disgusting is me doing stuff the entire match, going into a locker to hide because the killer is coming, and the person they found coming right over to my locker ro open it. You're acting like the survivor who rats someone out can't be an asshole. They don't get the right to be judge, jury, and (almost) executioner. 
---
Also, how the hell does a killer "investigate" mid-match?
---
Can you believe there are cosplays of that skin already tho?
---
https://twitter.com/Nontas0837/status/1121058339255775232
---
What is it that you struggle with in particular? Finding survivors? Catching them?
---
Just stop worrying about the fact that the guy on the hook might get off and go hunt down some other players, your not going to get better by camping that one dude and letting everyone else run through the objectives, it’s not like there’s a win or loss stat in this game really so who cares if all survivors get out, all that should be telling you is you need to improve your game or strategy somehow.
---
What a fucking idiot. Threw away their BP for the entire match for absolutely no reason!
---
Crop out the Knife and the Game symbol and post it on the Fortnite subreddit.
---
Then instead of going by what you hear from others go to the source. They're reverting the timer being stopped in her terror radius nerf which was the absolute hardest nerf to her and hurt the most. They also said that any inactive traps that become active with the last gen remain active so they still either have to look for their box or the hatch if they have a key.
---
We are really not discussing how to avoid a nurse, but simply how to counter one. You dont have to sit here like a few others and lecture me how to play vs one.
---
Catching them my Broken Controller, it makes me move at around 105% speed with killers that move 4.6 m/s so I can only move at normal speed while looking sideways which obviously isn't good in chases because I can't see the survivor.
---
Somehow the devs still didnt notice that the map spawns infinites and every streamer just dcs from it
---
i've been doing these as a little project with the skins i personally like running on my survivors, so i'll have to take a look and see how i've outfitted Kate! i would love to do something a little more complicated for the shirt tho tbh, so far i think most of the survivors i've drawn barring Claudette have been super simple lines and flat colours lol.
---
True random is only guaranteed over a sample set of infinite size. We would get a more accurate representation if we could see every box search that's happened in the game, but it still might not necessarily reflect true random. An examination of the game code is the only way to be 100% sure.
---
I know, I really think they are good, and funny.
---
Lmfao OP I’m sorry but you need to not take video game “drama” so seriously. I seriously worry for people like you because I highly doubt you can cope well in the real world if internet spats bother you so much
---
&gt;hex: devour nope
---
That's what survivors are thinking once you get your tokens
---
hots has the best DC system. Blizzard really figured it out. Basically, DCers get removed from the normal quest and placed in the “DCer que”. Essentially, it’s a shitty, low populated lobby. You wait in que forever and play with other players just as salty as you are. You are removed from this lobby after you complete one game.
---
The point is to inconvenience the hell out of rage quitters but be lenient enough to where if you naturally DC (internet fail etc), it’s just a minor inconvenience.
---
I agree. The only killer I didn't find it useful for is Freddy.
---
So you can't see anybody's ping in the lobby anymore? What about as killer?
---
I love this
---
[The first test](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/agpne1/feb_5th_we_will_all_work_together_beause/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=deadbydaylight&amp;utm_content=t3_anq365) was done while a bug existed where you could hear the Billy laugh globally, meaning you knew EXACTLY how many boxes it took to remove a trap. This was conducted over 500 traps resulting in almost perfect numbers of a coin flip at each box.
---
[The second test](https://nm.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/anq365/pig_rbt_stats_part_2/) was conducted by following survivors and observing them at each Jigsaw box, again for 500 traps, again resulting in near-perfect coin flip results.
---
Anyone who knows shit about statistics knows that numbers like that over 1000 repetitions aren't just "unlucky" or "outliers," that's significant data.
---
The only question here is who is lying, a player who stands to gain absolutely 0 by lying, or the devs who change and rebalance how powers work regularly, make regular shadow nerfs, and who've been shown to be lying about other significant mechanics in the game. (See the bloodweb tests in other comments in this thread.)
---
I use it when i find someone that i know annoyed me and at high rank this happens more than i would like to
---
What’s some serious nurse nerds or reworks, I belive a rework is the best option. Maybe her power being a 105% move speed with less potential for the blinks, like a one blink only where she has to time and predict survivors movements. So a 105% speed killer with a blink that has a cool down of like 10 seconds and doesn’t cause fatigue unless you swing and miss.
---
Straight up, nothing will help you unless you get a working controller or rig up a mouse and keyboard. There is not an in game strat that can counter broken equipment
---
Literally only when I have the daily. I don't get the point of them otherwise.
---
Welp, Guess I'll die.
---
Second question. Does a dying light + mori work as a build?
---
I've heard that is only for the character select menu and won't stick when you get into a lobby.
---
someone suggested this for Trapper and I agree

---
That one toxic survivor (that one meg who brings a flashlight , butt dances every pallets and farms her teammates.
---
I'll probably get the mask and outfit, especially if there is a Shard option.
---
...And how can you possibly know whether or not the trap removal occurred because the box had been picked prior or due to RNG? That's not something any amount of testing can determine.
---
Seriously. And killer mains are just babies.
---
Iron will is better, especially on nurse. Killers expect to hear you when in close range. Think of it, it takes skill to use iron will, it takes nothing to use adrenaline.
---
He is sort of good now and also still sort of bad. The 115% was a huge impro
---
I'm not a huge fan of legion but this is a pretty sick lookin outfit. looks like something you would see someone wearing at a rave shuffle dancing.
---
GOD! Now whenever I load up DbD I can't unsee it! What have you done?! 😂😂
---
Damn this meme got me hyped for nothin :,(
---
And they'll get over it within a month. No big deal.
---
I honestly don’t know why people keep saying Legion is nerfed. It’s like they forgot they added 5% movement speed buff as compensation. He’s a 115 killer now.
---
But, I agree the “rework” was lazy as hell. Definitely could have been a better, creative work done.
---
I’ve never depiped in a round as killer in badham for over a month because of there being no or very limited loops.
---
You can't exactly do anything when you get tunneled, off the hook and camped
---
The F***
---
It is more lethal, so yes it is better that way, but downing someone cannot be done with your power. That makes it bland like playing Wraith or Pig getting the first hits easy. Pig and Wraith can use their powers in a chase to down, though. Pig can lunge around medium loops. Wraith has stealth and speed boost out of stealth that can mind game. This means you have to pay more attention as survivor and anticipate one of several killer strategies. With the M1 second hit on Legion, there are no real unique mind game possibilities. I want killers to feel and play differently, I don’t want reskins like survivors. 
---
The addon changes do not add any changes to play style either, like Scratched Mirrors Myers or Body Block Hag. That is disappointing as it means there are less strategies to play as and against Legion. If you can’t kill with the power, I would have wanted to see addons that change the surrounding play style. For example, you can’t attack in frenzy and have a large cool down, but you can always see everyone’s location in Frenzy. It would be similar to a high mobility Scratched mirror Myers but without the ability to immediately hit someone. You get map pressure, but need skill to down someone thanks to the large cool down.
---
Never. I have a ton just sitting there and I avoid them in the blood web
---
Why are you narrowing it down to the last year though? Just to force your point?
---
Part of me wishes I would start writing down names for a shit list but I never do. I bet it feels good to kill them when you planned on it.
---
Wait, they gave Huntress the ability to headshot now?
---
Nah its completely fine just something I wanted to point out
---
A miserable pile of splinters!
---
I see you everywhere man you are the biggest troll this subreddit had ever seen, constantly jerking your killer ego off becuz muh killer is hard
---
Only used them once for a daily. I play for bloodpoints and a mori cuts on my profit. 
---
Although i'd like to use a green one every now and then but the entity gives me only yellow and red to mock me.
---
Thanks, I see the phrase bandied about the place, but wasn't sure I was reading it right.  I'm a relatively new addition to the fan-base (stayed on after the free weekend), but I learned not to do that in, like, match 1 or 2, I think.  I enjoy playing the crow-bro, but not dying is kind of the point here.
---

well it would basically be the same but from a different view i just like the idea of being able to see the full character, i think the current one is good too though! x
---
Shitpost or not, mouse and keyboard movement gives me cancer and I suspect my controller is a bit fucky as well because my killers seem to move a tad slow. I'm definitely not bad though.
---
I mean really both happen without any effect by the Survivor.
---
Bamboozle for a 0.1s vault time
---
You have report them on their website also because Devs don’t even read or review the in-game reports.
---
Guaranteed kill on the last Survivor, when gens aren't done.
---
If they have a trap when the third Survivor dies, you close the hatch and patrol boxes.
---
Actually it is. There's whole branched of mathematics and science that we call statistics and probability.
---
When you perform a test (in this case, applying a Reverse Bear Trap and counting how many boxes it takes to remove it) without changing any variables (which in this case would be add ons that affect number of Jigsaw boxes) you obtain data.
---
As you perform more tests, you can observe trends. The more tests you perform, (whether it be one person doing 1000 tests, or 1000 people each performing 1 test) the more accurately your data will show actual probability of something happening.
---
There are complex formulae which have been developed to determine "statistical significance," wherein so many trials provide such clear trends that the trends are deemed important.
---
Essentially, if you repeat a trial so many times and keep getting the same results, you can draw conclusions from them. His data (assuming it is true, and he really has no reason to lie about it more than the devs do) IS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DATA. He has very accurate percentages over an enormous amount of trials that correlates to an 8:4:2:1 ratio of removing the trap at each box, simply a 50% chance at each Jigsaw box.
---
If it were as the devs stated, and a random box of the 4 were selected each time, a trial of 1000 RBTs should show statistically significant results of a 1:1:1:1 ratio of RBTs removed at each box respectively.
---
Legitimately, I don't know what else can be said on the matter, because this is literally just how statistics works. The only way you argue this is "WE CAN'T EVER BE SURE OF ANYTHING, MATHS IS A LIE" in which case it's a lost cause.

My build for huntress is BBQ, Ruin, Iron Maiden, and Discordance.
---
You can switch out iron maiden for nurse's which I run sometimes and you can also run Whispers instead of Discordance, however I find Discordance to be really damn hood on huntress because if you can hit hatchets from a distance then you can get nearly guaranteed hits on far away or open gens.

I read your old post. As a huge Saw fan, I love how there's more references to the film like nail bomb and shotgun collar key.

Fr??? Thats wack

Thanks going to try it!
---
So I see that going with new servers didn't fix the issue of oversized box colliders (Hitboxes) on killer weapons or survivor bodies.
---
These aren't the final servers. This is atest for the idea.
---
Since they likely aren't coming until July/August, BHVR have time to iron out the kinks

Holy fuck that shit is clean. I need this to wear irl
---
But it doesn't sound like you are.
---
I posted that same thread on the forums when I posted it here, same with this one. It was pretty soon before Pig got the change to combat straps that I did suggest in there. I'm not going to claim credit cos it was a very rational change that they probably thought of themselves anyway, but I like to hope that it's a sign they do read shit like this occasionally.
---
Are you really having fun standing around camping hooks after getting bullied at loops because you can't afford $50?
---
I don't mean to come off as rude but seriously it is what's causing your struggles so its clearly the best option to address it. Get a new controller or even a used one and you don't have to stress over not being able to play the game properly.
---
I liked it a lot, I do not get why it was such an unpopular change.
---
I think she should max out at 2 Blinks. 5 Blink is excessive, no more extra blinks
---
That. Isn't. Nurse. Meta. That's literally what you do against any killer that isn't Doctor. 
---
Playing immersed is not a counter to Nurse. It's a counter to killers in general. Her power itself has no counter. 
---
If the only counter to something is to avoid having it at all applied, then it actually has no counter. And that isn't balanced (Unless it's temporary usage and specific requirements, such as Spirit Fury).
---
Well, Kinda. I like hearing and watching survivors struggle and groan when I'm next to them.
---
You’re not following and it’s very simple: They are removing a Killer’s counter play because they might gain an advantage. In doing so, they are giving an advantage to survivors playing against her because her power is rendered useless once the final generator is completed. Apparently, it is completely unacceptable that a Killer gain an advantage due to minor changes in mechanics but absolutely fine that survivors gain an advantage at that Killer’s expense. This isn’t balance: the scales are still lopsided. Meanwhile, the premise — that survivors be allowed to walk out of a trial with a death trap attached to their head with zero consequences — is absurd. 
---
PERIOD. You’re writing essays to excuse what they’re doing but you aren’t refuting my point.
---
Ok cool.
---
I'm dying, this is too perfect
---
I hope you find one without all the watermarks lol
---
The only real change I hate is the power ending when missing a swing... no more stabbing wildly as you charge :(
---
Thats 1 perk that the survs have and its new so itll be nerfed soon anyway. The other ones that killers complain about arent a big deal most of the time anyway.
---
YEAH I AGREE THAT SHIT WAS AWFUL
---
What do you mean ? Youre asking me how to beat a nurse in a chase right ? I told you jukes and LoS breaks.
---
u/Real_Bug is right, in fact, if I'm correct they're updating it so if people disconnect before the game starts it will return everyone to the main menu and refund all offerings.

---
yeah idk, good work devs
---
I understand the camp if MoM has gone off, but they don’t even know you have it yet. We are missing part of the story here. You did something this game or ran into these killers before.
---
&gt;Yes, the Killer can close the hatch if it is opened with a key, and this will trigger the End Game Collapse. The hatch can be re-opened once closed with a key.
---
[From the Endgame Collapse Q&amp;A](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/58159/dead-by-daylight-end-game-collapse/p1?new=1)
---
Theoretically that's true but any and every IRL test of statistical probability cannot use a sample of infinite size. A test of 500 samples could very well misrepresent true probability of boxes but are you seriously discounting a sample size of 500? Even if it's not perfect it will definitely start to reveal a trend. 
---
The data presented in that sample damn near perfectly outline a 50/50 shot per box but your right, we need the code to confirm
---
No because I am playing since one year ago and I finally want some more good survivor perks

---
The problem is systemic in the game development not the killers on an individual level. Count  how many times you face a clown in a week and you’ll realize how his kit actively discourages play when compared against other killers.
---
I don’t think the game is in a place where making a change to nerf plague or buff clown would make a dramatic enough difference. I think there needs to be an overhaul in how killers are chosen and how unique their aspects are.
---
Clown has been the lowest killer for some time now afaik.
---
How do you think he ended up here?
---
A few reasons
---
1: I feel like how they used the word "rework" and that got people's hopes up this change would be a legit rework of his powers that changes how it works in a more interesting way.
---
2: It listed about two buffs (decent ones) for him while giving him about seven listed nerfs that all would have a big impact on how he used to play *tunneling* *cough* *cough*

3: while in my opinion the changes are great for him, it is really only a jumping off point. He's pretty basic now. Just feral frenzy, hit a few people, and then walk and stab someone. That's what you're going to be doing almost every time. He's basically a free first hit then a wm1 killer. I think people were hoping that this change would let him evolve from that.
---
He's better for the game now but his ability feels like less of a focal point than before. Which is a shame since some of the most fun killers (in my opinion) are heavily ability focused. Myers and the spirit are great examples. So overall I hope this change can lead to him being more fun to play with making all the survivors insta dc.
---
&gt;Which sucks for everyone all around.
---
Except the people who manage to get past?
---
I only use them very rarely, and only as a form of insurance against genrushing if I feel the game is going too fast for me. Being able to knock out a player via killing them slows the game right down.
---
Her power relies on survivors cleansing or add-ons. If you take her without add-ons and survivors have at least some game sense they will not cleanse and deny her the Corrupt Purge. 
---
She is standard speed and once you are broken she is an M1 killer with nothing else. Very easy to loop and next to no mind games as she’s so tall.

---
As survivor i just do my best to earn as much bp as I can in a match win or lose so I can keep prestiging characters. As killer I just end the match as fast as I can, apologize for the state of the game and move on.
---
That is, when I can connect to a game past the loading screen of death. The real killer.
---
Oh shit, didn't know they did a second test.
---
That said yeah, Behaviour is pretty damn shady with some of their shit they pull. The fact the boxes are basically rigged is fucked, but I am curious to see if it changes from the coin flip odds if you add more boxes via addon.
---
I don’t agree she ignores all the tools. I agree that she requires a different play style than running in circles to escape a superhuman trying to kill you.
---

Lol, Amanda will be fine. At least they reversed the timer not going down while inside the TR.

---
what nerf do you think Plague needs
---
What do you think /s means?
---
I’d say Freddy is lower due to being unable to interact with survivors even when he’s right on top of them. His terror radius and initial sleep phase both give survivors plenty of time to react. At least clown has a ranged slow. But yeah, that’s pretty much all he has. I’d say the best thing about him is bamboozle but you can give that to anyone.
---
Doesn't take longer to do gens unless survivors are dumb and waste time.
---
Even though the Saw movies aren't the greatest, they have some pretty good final lines like that.
---
This is my favorite perk meme I’ve seen in months!
---
Doctor Nick from the Simpsons!
---
If you have ever played killer or survivor you know that some games ruin stays up until late game and completely destroys survivor progress due to looking for it under constant pressure
---
But it's not just about distance, it's about distance per second. I mean, the survivors aren't all going to stand there doing nothing, they are going to run away.
---
[when you get shattered cowshed for the 15th time in a row as Freddy ](https://i.imgur.com/Z9mr461.png)
---
I fucking can’t
---
ITS GRAND
---
I asked for that to be added to any trials he does in the future but that'd take a lot longer because you'd also need hundreds of the plan/sketches.
---
Completely anecdotal data, but I get a LOT more kills with the plan or sketch, so I'd assume that it does skew the percentages more than just being 50/50 on the 4th box again, but no guarantees.
---
About a handful
---
Freddy plays differently.
---
Your main focus with freddy is to stall the game as much as possible.
---
Im new to spirit but ive played with anti pallet phases. You basically guess what side of the pallet they are on and reappear right?
---
Yeah but one works better than the other when you use it with skill
---
First off, difficulty of usage and success of 4k are not the same thing so pick your argument. 
---
Second, yes, it does. You will never, ever beat a good Nurse. If you're lucky, you'll get the hatch. Which is not a win. It's barely even breaking even.
---
Singapore and Seoul should give decent connection no?
---
You can force survivors to need to cleanse by corrupting all of them instead of focusing one at a time. Spreading her plague works best for me instead of continuously chasing one individual. They stay broken and it’s an easy catch when they leave a loop or get caught out near a gen, or they give me my corrupt purge and I win that way. Based on the map I typically win by 3-4 gens completed since, like the doctor, you can just protect a limited area and prevent the survivors from doing anything. Except doctor has to hit people twice. Don’t need to chase survivors when they can’t run off to heal.
---
You've got to be kidding me. I've been absolutely even more something to use even go need to do look more as anyone can. Can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that? My guess is that when one really been far even as decided once to use even go want, it is then that he has really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like. It's just common sense.
---
That’s when starts getting real!
---
I will argue that Nurse IS easier to hide against because of how slow she is without blinking, but that's the extent I'd disagree. You're pretty much entirely correct.
---
I don't get him hardly at all. I get mostly plague,doctor, hillbilly. 
---
As for the clown I think he's alright. If you stay around windows you can get away sometimes and gen rush and typically 2 will survive. That's my games around rank 7.
---
It is. I clarified that in another comment. I even used ‘hour’ in my explanation.
---
Does it count as cosplay if it's just tape on a hoodie quickly thrown together
---
i like him better now with the upgraded speed. i think hes a better killer anyway.
---
I’ve beaten plenty of good nurses. You have to know how to juke, and when to use pallets
---
Hopefully they'll change the first batch of auric only outfits to shards
---
I’m dead. Reverse bear trap me now.
---
Noooooo, you bitch, you bitch.
---
While I don't appreciate their lack of transparency I will say I see why they did it. E.g. waste some but not all that much surv time. The reason I want an iridescent that does this is that it would slow the game down just a LOTTA bit. 
---
Traps still won't kill many ppl but it will (overall, considering probability) increase the gross time survivors will be searching boxes throughout a match. That would help a bunch.
---
Legion can injure all survivors just if survivors are potatoes, his Frenzy is so slow and some maps are so big, so you probably will can injure more 1 survivor, maybe 2 if you are lucky. At least Wraith has some mind games with his cloak, Legion's power literally ends after you get the first hit, you become as loopable as Freddy. I don't say that Wraith is any good, he is still shit against good survivors, but Legion is even more shit than him.
---
mettle of man gives a BIG disadvantage tho its that it completely takes away stealth
---
You mean the thing no good Nurse does?
---
Every single competent player, not even good but decent, will blink to their destination, which is so fast that you're liable to be spotted or at least leave scratch marks since you don't have a ton of time between hearing her heartbeat and her being on top of you. 
---
And even if you do, she'll have just as good of chances of finding you as any other killer. Her base movement speed is irrelevant.
---
Instead of darn freddy: Look up the one that's mostly used in the "he forgot to chase his own dream" meme, where Freddy just sits there, smoking.   
---
For Spirit: waluigi. easy.
---
Disconnecting from the match so you can join another match fully healed
---
As a Feng Min main I approve this be in the game 👌👍
---
No, you haven't. But it's really cute that you think you have. 
---
No team of survivors under any circumstances will ever beat a good Nurse. Beat as defined by finishing all gens and opening the exit gates to escape through.
---
Ya, but any balancing gets shoved out the window by the OP items and addons being constantly used.
---
I only hate that if you miss hit on FF you go into fatigue and it's too risky for console players like me to go after multiple survivors with FF.
---
Thing is I have fun with Clown. Artillery bombardment of gas and herding survivors can be fun. Legion seems even more boring than before.
---
/r/KoreanAdvice
---
I think the very first daily I ever received was to kill a survivor with huntress “by her own hand.” When I realized couldn’t do that, I internalized that I should hold on to moris in case I get one of those dailies. 
---
I have only ever seen two of those dailies since. 😶
---
I still think the Halloween DBD theme from a couple of years ago (can't remember if it was the same last year) should be the default. That was awesome. I bought the game that Halloween, and was disappointed that wasn't the theme all the time.
---
Blonde naturally, but she has Brunette and Lighter Blonde variations :)
---
I agree completely that her add-ons need changes / buffs. Just wanted to say if you think her ambush is worthless after the first minute you are playing Pig completely wrong
---
I've noticed that one-hit knockdowns greatly increase the chance that someone's gonna DC.
---
Like, if you chased someone around while M1-ing them for forty-five seconds? Probably not gonna DC. But when Hillbilly comes streaking across the map and instantly downs you, or when Leatherface walks around the corner and chainsaws someone, I nearly always see that player DC.  
---
It really sucks, because it fucks over EVERYONE else. The survivors have a much harder time, and the killer's been cheated out of bloodpoints.
---
 Knew it wasn’t fucking ginger lol
---
3 people doing 1 gen each (without toolboxes) is 3 gens done in 80 secs do another two at that speed and thats another 80 secs 20 secs to open the door (its 15 on ptb) thats 180 secs to escape (not including walking times and all that) thats 3 mins
---
yes but dont call it feral because  nothing about it is feral
---
Absolutely, I'm not arguing that they don't get to decide the mechanics of how the RBTs are removed, just don't lie about it for the sake of lying.
---
That said, I think it would feel far better if they weighted the boxes more towards 2-3 than 50% on the first box. It's incredibly depressing when you get a trap on someone and SHOULD have just had a big swing in momentum in your favour, and it buys you about as much as a Legion mend.
---
I find killer easier, everyone should play both sides though, it's much more fun that way, it's basically a second game mode.
---
2 hunting grounds and one ruin.
---
One of the best suggestions I’ve heard. I always struggle to pick out her add ons because I’m always confused about what I’m supposed to do with this hot garbage. Let alone what I’m going to do when my traps don’t work and 90% of her add ons are tied to her traps.
---
Of course
---
Huntress bunny furry
---
Blinking on top of you is an issue, yes. Certainly removes any forewarning. I'm not going to disagree there. The only real thing you can do is listen to her blinks and predict she's coming to you ahead of time similar to Hillbilly.
---
That said, if you are hiding and avoided being caught off guard, her lower movement speed does matter. It's a lot easier to manipulate LOS on someone and make distance when they're slower compared to the constant sprint of the other killers. Should she hear your breathing, you're fucked.
---
That's my only point. Her power is broken, you're dead meat in a chase, but I'd certainly call her easier to hide against if only slightly.
---
Strawberry blonde
---
3 Lightweights, literally zero scratchmarks
---
The true Russian Roulette.
---
But killers have shared perks as well
---
I don’t think nerfing plague will change the fundamental problems with the game.  The gap between cohesive survivors and solo que survivors is too broad, but first let’s focus on letting people connect to games in the first place. It’s weird that this far along basic functions like playing the game are still hard for true average player.
---
Killers are homogeneous due to how perks can be shared. Maybe weaken their effects when used off their primary killer/survivor. It would strengthen weaker killers with stronger perks like bbq or bamboozle. Clown just needs more effects, but buffing his trait doesn’t seem like the answer.
---
I remember that scene, it was so sad when Waluigi vored him.
---
Meg's dream here. She can now run like in her track days without worry.
---
Can we get the lesbian plant out of her ? WTF !
---
That's my thoughts nailed on the head. Lying about it is idiotic, but making it weighted is... alright. Personally, I think a 25% for each box would on average be fine, but if it was weighted towards the third or second box it would certainly be a lot better than it is currently. Reaching the first box is pretty easy.
---
Not giving them a chance would have hurt you, less bp and less emblem (even though that doesn't matter at rank 1). I will never understand a killer who lets the game end on 5 gens and 3 people dying on the first hook. No pip and 11k bp. pretty dumb
---
Clown has no stall mechanics but is better in a chase. Neither of them meet their role requirements in a satisfactory way.
---
please share the finished results one day
---
 #PrayForAmanda
---
I'm glad to have a cosmetic I super like, and to be able to play Legion soon without feeling gross about it.
---
Exactly, if you add in extra time to find gens and open doors, it's not more than 2 minutes if they don't mess around.
---
Is the legion picture from the confinement series?
---
Right? When I jumped on the other day, I only got games where someone would load in - 4 people, and then DC right at the start so we’re a three man with 5 gens. This is kind of unrelated but the usernames are always like “JessiKittyxx” LOOOOL
---
Decisive strike
---
Bugs bunny for huntress
---
And unique killer abilities to differentiate. Which means when you strip away perks and addons what you’re left is with is your core character. Clowns core character is significantly weaker than plagues.
---
That’s nothing but a quick fix of dopamine, just hides the anger lower so that it’ll revive itself at a later time
---
How is that any different than right now? Aside from, “You’re the last survivor,” if the Pig traps you once the doors are open she’s still almost guaranteed to kill you because her boxes are much more defensible than the doors. I understand she’ll be able to take the hatch out of play but the hatch is only fine because it’s supposed to be hard to find and the Killer can grab you while jumping into it. 
---
At some point the Pig’s power needs to mean certain death. Otherwise her power is meaningless. It’s just an annoyance you throw on people’s heads.
---
Or it's just a PTB and everybody loves being giant fucking cunts on them. "Nothing matters" on it after all.
---
&gt; The gap between cohesive survivors and solo que survivors is too broad
---
Solo survivors benefit from SWF players. There is no need to gap anything. There is no gameplay conflict between solo and SWF that needs to be addressed.
---
&gt; Maybe weaken their effects when used off their primary killer/survivor.
---
This is a horrendous idea. So many perks are already too weak and this would also make the killer variety issue worse. It absolutely would not help the way you're acting like. fucking lol this is just another Pig/Wraith/etc nerf you're proposing
---
And, again, please explain how Plague needs to be nerfed. Stop dodging
---
or 4 bbq and chili being able to see survivors for 16 seconds and getting 400% more bp
---
or 3 pop goes the weasel when its 99ed being able to take away all progress and add overcharge for more mayhem
---
or 2 stbfl with pratically zero cooldown between hits
---
or 4 dyling light having 100% less generator repair speed
---
Killers: 
---
Four Corrupt Interventions. Lock down all generators for eight minutes at the start of the match. :)
---
Oh boy haha
---
I kinda do understand it tbf, if you run bbq that 22k in 5 min and if you don’t care for rank (like me) you’ll just safety pip. But yeah it makes the game really unfun and makes you look like a tryhard.
---
I am on ps4, and I will be on at about 7 in the morning est tomortow if you are down
---
Yeah that baffles me. PTB is when I run nurse with bamboozle and spirit fury. Wish more people would just have fun. 
---
Hell, live servers I’ll run bamboozle nurse and try and get kills without add ons. It’s just a game
---
True. It would create a more diverse feeling. I have all perks on ace and a few others like meg and jake. But yeah I would be lost without playing ace. I play other survivors often and have cosmetics for almost everyone but i always come back to ace at the end of the day. And if someone picked him before I could i probably would dodge the lobby. And thatll create a lot of people dodging lobbies so they can play their main. But you are correct about you hardly see the same survivors in a lobby. Ace is not that common which is nice. But claudettes would have to pick someone else because every other survivor is a claudette main lol
---
Trapper should be a pic of Astolfo or some shit, the ultimate trap
---
If they're so close that you're relying on line of sight, they will know you're there by means of context clues such as the gen being progressed or by actually having ears and hearing you. 
---
I understand what you're getting at but there should never be a narrative to suggest she's acceptable in any regard. She simply breaks the game when someone knows how to play her, as is obvious by her power being to literally ignore all obstacles and mechanics.
---
Well it doesn't take a minute, that's for sure. Plus you have to add all of those on to be able to make it really powerful like that and for the add ons that means you only get 1 game with them. Plus that's assuming the trap is active, meaning if it's not you could just leave.
---
It might be me but I really dont like the term *crutch perk* its not the survivors fault for picking non-situational or gimmick perks same can go for killers except rancor because fuck rancor
---
Also "saying" and "insinuating" aren't the same thing. Stop trying to sound educated. I'm flat-out proclaiming my point. There is no insinuating whatsoever.
---
Wym? He's actually better now. At least I do better with him in the PTB.
---
I've found that I have more success putting it *just slightly* out of range, because it makes them stop for a second and go "hey, did he put that trap out of range?" while I catch up to them around the other side.
---
Doctor becomes meta.
---
Killer gameplay is downright broken at higher pings, and some gameplay elements are affected by latency that shouldn't be. What this tells me is that their implementation for this test is most likely rather rudimentary, not having made the complete switch from the killer-hosted to remotely-hosted architecture in terms of all the code involved with hit registration and killer abilities, which have so far relied on the killer having virtually no latency whatsoever.
---
I do wanna say that I think they will implement a true "both roles are equal clients to an omniscient, deciding-instance server", with hopefully well-implemented networking techniques to make things as smooth as possible for either side, but... I am not confident in that, either. The end product could very well still have some weird kinks and rely somehow on their old killer-as-host-based model.
---
4 minutes of protection after being unhooked sounds nice.
---
Yeah it's always billys too lol I mean it's the survivors fault for being dumb but if you got 1 hook each with 5 gens left, you're in a pretty good situation lol why not go for bloodpoints
---
I get tunneled on ps4 like crazy. I feel like killers recognize me and take me out early to decrease odds of the survivors winning. 😒😒
---
I see we won't see eye to eye on this singular point and we'll be going in circles. I'll be leaving it here as we both agree Nurse is broken, but you disagree that Nurse possibly has any slightly weaker aspect of herself.
---
That’s why you have perks ...?
---
I'd run 4 BBQ for the BP alone.
---
Myers with Tombstone Piece with Dying Light times 4 would be a meta build.
---
3 level 3 monsterous shrines and insidious, for when you need to be even more of a fucking dogshit stain on this earth by godlike basement camping.
---
Because you can escape through the hatch.
---
Some add on ideas I’ve had for pig, that I feel would be fun to play with would be:
---
Deafening survivors with a RBT on to all sounds. (not TR or Roar for balance if need be)
---
Becoming obsessed with a survivor. That survivor starts with a RBT on.
---
You start with 2 or 3 less RBTs. All survivors start with a RBT on. (Would make sense lore wise as in the saw films they always woke up with a trap on)
---
TR, stain, and/or roar is suppressed during ambush and/or after uncrouching. (Please for the love of god add a scoring event for smacking after uncrouching)
---
+3 and +5% MS while crouching. (For balance reasons I feel it wouldn’t stack up to above survivors speed)
---
TR is no longer suppressed by crouching. You gain 100% bonus bloodpoints for actions in the deviousness category.
---
TR is no longer suppressed by crouching. Hitting survivors with the ambush puts them into the dying state. (Increase charge timer if need be)
---
Jigsaws laugh can be heard map wide (this was a bug a while back and I feel it would be cooler base kit if they made all players able to hear the laugh. Just imagine working on a gen and you hear his laugh.)
---
Survivors who search the wrong Jigsaw box are put into the injured state (preferably this would be added to the last one or just made base kit, as it fits the lore that they would harm themselves to live)
---
When you put a RBT on a survivor, you can see all other untrapped survivors auras for 5 seconds. (This seems strong, but her traps are limited so)
---
Hitting a survivor with an ambush attack gives them the broken/mangled/hindered/exhaustion status effect. (I feel these would be better replacements/upgrades for the ones that effect trapped)
---
I know most are too strong to have them all added, but they are just ideas I had. (Some were based on other killers add ons) Let me know what y’all think of them.
---
What about using a key after the killer has closed the hatch and started the endgame?
---
Because half this sub is a bunch of morons who think they know game design
---
I don't think it's that bad of a nerf especially since gate opening times have been reduced and leader exists. For me anyways. It either always comes down to a 4k before the second gen is done or it comes down to a hatch escape so end game isn't a thing for me unless I'm having a really really really bad day in general that affects my game time. Even then I just brush it off and find something else to do or to play. It really isn't that big of a deal to me. Traps are there to waste time for survivors and for a minimum boost to points for me. I'm so glad that traps still have a purpose. If you think end end game was bad with them just walking out imagine an active timer never ticking just because they're near you or following you around while youre chasing someone just to avoid their head popping like it should.
---
What does the new Mixtape do now?
---
SHHHH DONT LET THE DEVS KNOW, IVE ALREADY BOUGJT COSMETICS FOR MY GLITCHED ASH
---
If they took out collision for killer on survivor that would be a huge step in the wrong direction. There are already clipping issues due to lag and such. And players do have collision with each other. Me and another survivor got nearly stuck in a place because of it, luckily we got out. But overall i've only seen a couple of these games in hundreds. You have to expect bullshit games sometimes, it's part of the game.
---
I'm not saying lower movement isn't disadvantageous, I just don't like creating the narrative that there's at all anything that makes her even remotely acceptable as is.
---
But there was talk about it from the guys behind Ghostface
---
I had an idea that instead of random % chance of rng key spawning, you should have to search x number of y (x&lt;y ofc) boxes to get fragments of a code to open them. That way she's not rng based anymore, she will always delay by the same amount (sure some boxes can be closer/further away, but you won't get it off on first box or at 5th, always the same x number). 
---
I don't really like the instadown one, it seems a bit too easy to get. Clown's instadown add on at least needs aim, with Pig you'd have a chainsaw that you can't miss.
---
In a meta so heavily centered around looping as a defensive tactic, Clown’s power to just straight up saw 25% off of the effective distance of every loop or force survivors onto a new loop is not something to underestimate.  His niche is shortening loops, and apart from Trapper, Hag, and Nurse, he is the best at doing so.  What’s more, unlike Trapper and Hag Clown can shorten loops without halting his movement, limiting his vision, or expending a limited resource.  He has a strong power with no real downsides apart from limited ammo, which unlike Huntress or Trapper really doesn’t mean a whole lot since you can reload anywhere at any time, so just reloading immediately after a hooking or a gen kick doesn’t force you out of position.
---
I will say, Clown’s power is a little dull.  Shortening loops is powerful in this meta, but it’s pretty braindead and doesn’t look as flashy or feel as meaty as an ability that actively does damage, or applies pressure in ways that are hard for survivors to predict.  Functionally, he’s just an M1 bitchboi on steroids, and none of his add-ons apart from the iridescent ones really change that.  He’s boring, but practical.
---
Yeah, but like I said, the fact that it can happen... scares the shit out of me... Scares me more than playing survivor lol.
---
Frenzy-hitting a Deep Wounded Survivor will reduce the timer by 25%. But that makes it a 5 hit down.
---
Oh i didnt even see the sprint burst and vigil. I wasnt correcting you or anything i thought i was being original lol sorry about that. Botany knowledge 3x with well make it would be like 199% faster with emergency medkit 234% and with abdominal dressing would be 259% with surgical suture would make it 274% healing speed. Oh my god. That would be so fast. And if someone had the same thing and was healing with you would be like 548% increase healing speed
---
On PS4 I tried self caring at a pallet and just got locked up to where I couldn't do anything until the killer downed me.
---
Uhhh, Why would you want to use that?
---
I had a stroke while reading that
---
Why didn't you check around before picking up the survivor after the first time this happened?
---
Yeah the Evil Within would definitely be a cool idea for a licensed chapter.
---
The madlad
---
No official date yet.
---
............if that scares you, well you ain't cut out for this game my friend. There are toxic people in this community, not that they were toxic, that are far worse. And if this is what does it to you like this then you're not ready for the advanced level.
---
This story doesn't add up, I'm sorry. 
---
How can the whole team body block, take the time to heal and do gens at the same time?
---
Seems like you just performed badly at chases and got punished for it while trying to shift the blame to survivors being coordinated. In time you will improve and will learn how to pressure survivors or at the very least, end chases quicker. 
---
Also, don't waste time kicking gens if you are dropping a chase to do so.
---
Isn't she like...the hardest killer to master? 
---
Being "The Best" Killer doesn't mean she's "The Easiest" Killer
---
Is it Dimension Films who own the rights?
---
Are you trying to say ppl should adapt to changes in videogames? THAT'S ENTITLED \*sic\* Well there you got it, ppl love to complain, heck there's even ppl saying Easy Mode in videogames ruin the experience to them even though it's an optional thing, like, consumer base can be really whiny about some stuff.

OK I'M USING THIS ONE
---
U should have used maybe like 4-6 pallets in 5 minutes not all
---
You played bad bud. I dont get why ur blaming the game
---
2 or 3 Autodidacts might bring the perk back to how it used to be in the Shattered Bloodline PTB.
---
Just started playing Killer and started with legion and just started getting use to him. First time I spent money on the game to get cosmetics. Now he’s being changed and I don’t have Pc to play the PTB to see how to adapt and I’ll will have to learn it live. So I’m scared I won’t have fun playing him anymore
---
i guess you have a point there doesnt it take like 15-30 secs or so?

Haha thanks, I had to have at least one perk related to coffee. Got my own version of the mug irl :P

I can just imagine how creepy it'd be hearing Anima humming in the distance on DBD. Then seeing her in the distance suddenly run at you really fast. But I think a lot of people would say she's too similar to the Spirit to be a DBD killer. Then I was thinking Stefano but my ideas for him sounded like a combo of Nurse and Huntress lol
---
I can't play either of the trap killers to save my life but they shit fury on me like no other
---
You're good, no issues 😊
---
If my math is correct the botany combo os 4 second heals. Remove one for a We'll Make it and that's a 3 second heal.
---
this is actually funny thanks for the laugh
---
ayyy, glad you like it! 🤩
---
Are you serious, dude? You legit get anxiety when starting a Killer match?   
---
Like it's hard to breath, you feel nauseous(maybe even throw up), you feel fear and anger in equal portions leading to confusion, your mind runs away with thoughts too fast for you to recognize and you feel physically ill afterwards? Cause if that's the case then I would highly suggest going to see a doctor because..yeah, you're fucked up.  
---
If instead you meant that you get a little nervous because you might lose then get over that shit, for real. Cause I have seen real ass shit that would give you anxiety and playing videogames is not one of them.
---
I think the problem with crutch perks is that you end up getting sick of seeing them after a while. Dodging bbq is mandatory in every game because everyone runs it no matter the killer. I think of it like seasons in competitive games where eventually they have to nerf the common core strategies into oblivion or just remove them entirely so that every build isn’t homogeneous.
---
One of my favorite moments from EW2 was when Sebastian drank 1 specific cup of coffee, and he suddenly commented that the mug was disgusting. I wasn't expecting it and I thought it was pretty funny.
---
This is amazing great work!
---
I know this advice is sort of generic or cliche, but the best way to enjoy killer is to not worry about "winning". Give up chases you know you'll lose, if you're being body blocked, injure or down who you can, and if they are being toxic, be toxic back and tunnel/etc.
---
The overall point is to just have fun though. I used to get very anxious as killer, now it's basically all I do because it's fun if you don't worry about winning. You can start doing fun builds and just messing around. 
---
Eventually you'll learn how to handle loops, and when to stop chasing, etc. Best of luck!
---
Oh, well then. Get a new controller. Or maybe try Nurse?
---
I 100% agree! I only occasionally use Fragile Wheeze for an extra blink. I do run Ruin though
---
Considering you are running insidious 2 I have absolutely no sympathy for you.
---
God that would be so bad 😂
---
Weak excuses from SWF. Middle school is still on spring break I see.
---
I don't use yellows at all and I save my greens and ebonies for daily ritual
---
9/10 times I load in, it's in the Pisswoods.  I've never been more tired of seeing corn and the color yellow.
---
I don’t understand how the match went so wrong for you.
---
Doc has auto tracking with Treatment Mode but yet two gens got done before you even found anyone? Also they can’t constantly trade hits over and over because they all would have been injured at one point and they would have been off the gens. You should have focused on putting them all into madness 3 if they were running at you to protect their teammate and then focused on chasing one.
---
I’d agree with this. I played nurse pretty heavily until I got better as her and because of that I feel like when I get downed by a good nurse it’s obvious they put in the time. So many times trying to blink through cliffs or walls only to get stuck against it.
---
Now if this were pre-rework Legion....
---
See I can do without bbq but ruin is a perk you have to run no matter what in my opinion
---
I understand your frustration and games where you get pushed around aren't fun, but why didn't you follow the injured survivor in your example? Personally, I kind of like when the survivors body block, because it keeps them busy not doing gens during the chase, they need to heal, you know where they are and you can still chase whoever was injured last. A coordinated SWF group with good players can still burn through the gens so fast that you also need some luck and momentum, but I don't think body blocking itself is a problem.
---
I know the anxiety you mean when you just want to have a nice game and you get experienced and cocky survivors instead. The best thing to do about that is to not take it personally, not take the game too seriously and not bother too much about winning or losing. You don't get anything for it anyway except some more bloodpoints and depipping even rewards you with generally easier games. It's not worth getting stressed out over it.
---
Deleting game so you never have to heal again
---
REEEEE THAT'S ENTITLED
---
No, but for real, Pig is getting a true nerf, and then you got Legion players complaining about their rework as if it were a nerf, heck I've experienced something similar on Overwatch with all of the Mercy reworks and I've been disappointed? Yes, Do I adapt? I do, even if I miss the old gameplay Mercy is one of my mains and I like to play as her
---
I love Clown. He's fun. I like playing games with the gas cloud, it discourages survivors from beelining to annoying pallet areas and such or they get slowed and it's an ez hit. I love his character too. I'd say I'm pretty close to maining him.
---
Just get better mate eventually you’ll reach a point where survivors will be too scared to do stuff like that, and lay off that shitty Noed perk it just makes you worse at the game.
---
Wow, I never heard people complaining about THAT before
---

---
For Doctor
---
I just wrote a long comment on my feelings on Nurse. As killers I mainly play her but I play tons of survivor as well. Shortly, using line of sight and hiding behind objects is really strong vs her.
---
Playing against/as her is a matter of mind games. You need to learn how the other part plays. For example, as with any killer, you learn who has Dead Hard so you learn to bait it out in the future. Same applies here, you'll learn quickly who instantly runs back to juke a blink and who sticks the run forward/behind the corner. If you just play less predictably and predict her movements, easy jukes.
---
Yeah, I forgot that 99% of ppl are super try hard on there and act like life depends on getting all kills. I play casually and don't shit my pants if I don't escape or kill everyone unlike someone like you I'm sure lol. Every killer and survivor feels exactly the same when all the good perks are unlocked. It's very boring.
---
Oof lol. I feel sorry for those survivors
---
I barely see Solidarity. 
---
I think if you could heal yourself to full it'd see more use, as it is I don't think anyone is actually using it. :c
---
She is, but sadly still isnt that hard to do decent with.
---
That's true, they shouldn't have to compete. ;-; They're all best WOMEN! Mwahaha.

I couldn’t agree more ;~; 💕

Well you can but you would need to break into Sony headquarters
---
Or be part of anonymous
---
This is why I play legion
---
Dude. That'd be awesome
---
Ass eatin orgy with killer watchin
---
You see those anyway lol
---
The melting skins from the last Halloween event are always 100% nopes for me.
---
Yeah. I play on PS4 so I mostly get LF, Doc, or Nea............I mean Hag.
---
doctor should be doctor haus from the series dr haus
---
Use Bridget from Guilty Gear for Trapper.
---
Well, killers being better or worse and having their own style is actually more realistic. I know it would butt hurt sweats like yourself.
---
if he gets missing its the netitys fault
---
Wow, you have a lot more hours than me. I just barely crossed 300 and I'm close to Devotion 1 level 70.
---
You forgot DCing before the killer hooks you so they don't get points.
---
this shit is awesome also this is the next watchdogs protagonist
---
Be the killer
---
Be the killer so you dont need to heal
---
Totally true. It slows down the game SO much. Mainly because there's usually 2-3 people looking for it, haha :) I run Monitor &amp; Abuse, A Nurses Calling, Hex: Ruin and BBQ&amp;Chill (got bbq last week, before that I used Sloppy or Thanato). Monitor and Nurses is insane since out of chase your terror radius is smaller than Nurses. And a no-add-on blink is just enough for the blink.
---
Why Iron Grasp and Deerstalker?
---
I fucking feel ya on this. I want them so much.
---
They are absolutely horrible.  The hitboxes are worse tbh. Also if the killer has bad ping, you are screwed. It doesn't matter if you have good ping.
---
i played more when this player lvl thing was not in the game
---
BEST THING I HAVE READ ALL DAY
---
lol damn that's a really good question. I would assume you could open it
---
The PTB brings out the devil in some of us
---
Billy and nurse, 100%. Other than that though I dont see a reason to use it unless you need bloodpoints.
---
She got released today, and is way overpowered just like her "natural camoflauge" in Dbd
---
It's better than whispers for all but last survivor.
---
I think Windows Of Opportunity is very underrated. Hands down my favorite perk
---
that's my mood
---
You're being very contrived. 
---
Nurse is overpowered and game breaking. There will be no open discussion of this fact with me.
---
it will be joey
---
How is GF fleshed out? Each character that wore the mask was in 1 movie each. Most of which shared the mask with a partner. They all attempt to frame someone else, or ride the fame of the murders of the first movie. 
---
Like, murdering your dad's mistress is not very evil, and neither is being a fame whore. Besides, Scream was a subversive horror franchise, and closer to satire than serious. 
---
And, Legion WAS picked. I don't have to defend them, because they are in the game already.
---
Ya all tho the wreanch outfit would be better
---
I hold the weapon in my left hand because I don’t use it as much as my right hand. My right hand does all the swinging and sometimes pallet breaking. My right leg also gets all the love as I use it to kick just about anything. I’m trying to maintain a balanced work out between the right and left.
---
Kinda cringe ngl
---
I like to scope out pallets, vaults, and Lockers before I start working on a Gen but in lower ranks WoO (Windows of Opportunity) is a useful perk.
---
No.
---
I like Stake Out too.
---
Interesting.
---
Because really bad killers no longer have a killer that can guarantee a down without any effort anymore.  Honestly the people bitching about Legion are the same ones that either moonwalked, or simply tunneled their survivor to death with their 4 missed attacks on every Frenzy with the 5th connecting to drop their timer further.  People are upset they'll actually have to demonstrate some form of skill to play him now.
---
4 MoMs... what's even a dying state
---
oh true yeah i've seen people get stuck in trees &amp; shit before
---
For real. I've somehow gotten more than one person teabagging at every pallet asking why I didn't give hatch.
---
PC
---
Visual, Ingam
---
Ran into two recently:
---
1) Use Brand New Part on someone running Ruin (it was Bubba in this match) and nail both the BNP skillchecks but get zero progression on the gen. Basically wastes a BNP.
---
2) Had someone unhook me the other day while I was struggling only to start to run as I hit the ground but inexplicably fall through the map, falling into unprogrammed hell where I fell through the map 8-10 more times before ultimately getting dying with "Dead" message, not a "Sacrificed" one.
---
Have gotten both of these more than once.
---
Ruvik? I thought about him, but I figured his abilities are too similar to Nurse. Plus, I was kinda focusing on The Evil Within 2 I guess.
---
Well then it's apparently not matter to be discussed about. All I can say is that I'm doing okay in red ranks vs Nurses. So I don't personally see her as a problem, that's just me. You do you.
---
no grils or nerds allowed
---
I don’t want to go back to that PTB because of what Spirit was like
---
To fill the sub with poor grammar?
---
I know your pain and their stupidity
---
Dirty blonde.
---
yeah he i just think he has a cool design and would be good for the atmosphere and is bit scarier the those
---
Plot twist: you just become REALLY obsessed with one survivor
---
Hmm I must be going crazy then.
---
Really even after hitting rank 1 a few times I don’t think I’ve seen monitor on a nurse, I think I’ll try that
---
also excuse my english its pretty bad
---
It does stick in the lobby, tho.
---
I honestly think the Hallowed Blight theme was the best
---
I'm in red ranks and do constantly fine vs Nurses. All I can say
---
And.... it's still fucked, thanks
---
Amanda main over here. I use all my RBT's way before the Exit Gates are powered so I never cared about The Pig nerf.
---
sure, that's fine! if anyone asks where you got it, tho, just direct em to this post or my [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/kelseyelleart), please! thanks for asking 💜💜
---
thanks so much 😊😊
---
You were the obsession. Thats reason enough lmao
---
In a post I did earlier I talked about left over moris that I rarely use. Killers were posting about having hundreds of them. I was thinking of a evil idea. What if we made a killer holiday. A day we all just burn through our mori I mean every match. Can you imagine what Reddit would be like that day. Lol the day killers decided that screw it and paint the streets red. It would be chaos.  Lets say this weekend we all said fuck it and just spam all of our games with mori. Red and greens all day. I think it would be fun and shake things up a bit. Thoughts?  Or. Ideas? What do we do with our lovely stock pile of death waiting? This could be a awesome event.
---
I'll vet this knife for my Susie
---
***Concern***
---
*suck my dick*
---
If it's any help, the big trick to Hag and Trapper is that you don't want to chase people - you want to herd them towards your traps. This may mean letting people go if they run into dead zones, this may mean letting generators get completed to narrow the playing field, this usually means prioritizing getting your traps up over chases in the early game, and this always means keeping an eye out for high traffic areas (like the shack window) to drop your traps.
---
Unfortunately Trapper's on the weak end no matter what you do, but Hag's good.
---
r/woooosh
---
I'll be sure to link it to anyone asking!
---
&gt; but still get hit around corners, pallets, and vaults.
---
Intended and will never change
---
Object of obsession and Spine Chill
---
i play on ps4 as well i mostly play killer
---
That's a pretty good idea in terms of modifying her lunge into a swipe. I like that a lot. Because when you're playing a nurse that has 3-5 blinks AND gets the lunge to cap it off the range just feels a bit unfair as a surv main.
---
I would be happy if the Killer DCing before the game even starts wouldn't instantly depip you... can we all agree that this is just insanely stupid and unfair?
---
Truth is, the game was rigged from the start.
---
My sister did that with a Freddie mask...ran around threatening people with a toy spatula.
---
I don't. The distance outweighs the speed.
---
Public....TEST !!! Emphasis on TEST !!! Build, this is not what they will be like when they are finished.
---
The main reason for me being meh on it when first announced was that at the end of the day, Legion was built around the Deep Wounds mechanic and around punishing pallet looping.  The changes aren't as bad as anticipated, which is welcome, but they still turn Deep Wounds into basically a non-factor in 99% of games and reduce Legion's ability to punish the very crutch gameplay it was designed around countering.
---
From the get-go, Legion seemed *intentionally* built to end the stale Self-Care and pallet looping meta that has dominated the game for who knows how long, only to get nerfs to the ability to do so because of survivors who think not being able to run in a circle and win 95% of confrontations means something has no counterplay. Stealth, 180/360 jukes, windowframe hiding gambits all worked very well against even the original form of Legion, and having another Killer who encouraged more varied gameplay that wasn't as OP as Nurse was very welcome in the eyes of many of us.
---
Legion's changes ultimately aren't big enough to entirely change that niche it was designed to fill, but they do beg the question of why add a killer who seemed custom-built to upset the meta if you're gonna just change them anyway as soon as the Survivor mains raise an issue with it? It's not the changes that bug me so much as the attitude of the developers and the contrasts in player response to the whole debacle. There's clearly a lot of division in what people expect from the gameplay at this point that I feel needs to be addressed more directly at some point.
---
I'm not worried about 1 dude and you shouldn't be either. You get more points by moving onto the next match than you will by wasting time in a stalemate you're currently in.you don't HAVE to kill all 4 people all of the time.
---
Servers don’t fix hit boxes. Idky people thought that would change, the hit boxes are like that cause the devs designed them that way. They’re big hit boxes sure but intended
---
I save mine for OP SWF 👍🏻
---
yup
---
Nope
---
Wow, it's almost as if this is an early testing of the dedicated servers and not the final product.
---
I really like Lithe now that you can activate it whenever you want to.
---
When you say swipe, do you mean when you quickly tap M1 as opposed to holding down M1 for a lunge?
---
I would feel as if I'm doing a bad job as a killer if I didn't bring a mori every game I could have. So I bring one every single time I have them. There is nothing like ruining peoples day who feel so "entitled" to escape. As if it's their right from birth. Oh man the mori's on SWF groups is amazing, the amount of salt one can produce from a mori is un-real. 
---
I love it.
---
None at all, I agree, it can be completely negated and stopped from activating.
---
What is this, a shitpost for ants?
---
But I prefer to kill all 4 as that is the goal of the game. I always aim for 4. Does that mean I get mad when I get less? No. But I'm playing to win and I only count 4k's or 3k's with a hatch escape as an actual win.
---
It would be a giant Viking raid. Think about the shake up it would bring. Red mori every match. Myers running all their tombstones and tuffs of hair. Iridescent axes. Death every game.  That would be such a event and would make history in this game and community.
---
Yes, when you quickly tap M1.
---
Maybe this is why bugs always slip through... because shitheads do stuff like this and keep people from proper testing
---
We all knows that stabby boy already in game
---
Yet another reason to close the post trial chat box
---
Can someone explain why we need Ghostface in the game.  It's just another regular dude in a mask with a knife.  Don't we pretty much have that covered with Legion?  Give me another creative original killer or at least a far more unique licensed killer.  I lived Scream 1 back in the day as much as the next guy but what would they possibly add to the game?
---
Actually no. It sucks for everyone since matchmaking can't understand difference between rank and skill.
---
Give us an idea of how many games you played? Is it NEVER in 20 games? Or is it NeVEr in like 3 games. There’s a big difference between those two things.
---
Nice. I need to play more Killer, hell I need to get better perks as a survivor. Luckily bloodhunt is coming up.
---
1 day later final review is in
---
Good thing I don’t like those movies
---
Come back to me when it's actually fixed, this game is a mess it's not what it used to be it sucks
---
Ahhhh it’s so cute and underleveled x I wanna huh it
---
Its only been today that I've noticed so many people dc'ing, either at the start of the match or because they got caught or hooked, or because someone else has also dc'd. Can't wait for dedicated servers!
---
I mean I hate mori's so fucking much, but holy shit this would be totally dope. It could be like the Purge or something. So much salt would be on this subreddit! What would the holiday be called?
---
Whore colour.
---
This would be a nice upgrade, good idea.  I've been running this on my Freddy for the last couple weeks and been having some nice results.  This change would make him even more devious at tall loops and T Walls.
---
Like your mother
---
Exhaustion btw
---
This whole game is a public test build.
---
The servers aren't properly coming out until July/August.
---
Many things will have to be recoded/redesigned in that time.
---
Lol yeah I get that but I like to think if we are dealing with hacks to even produce this maybe the exhaustions are linked to the individual perks or something.  Just let me have this dream lol.
---
Hag is deadly with the 3-Gen Strat and even more nightmarish with Make Your Choice.
---
According to my brain:  **Sprint Burst**
---
According to my heart:  **Diversion**
---
According to my actual builds:  **I’m a Non-Contributing Shit Wasting Everyone’s Time** (sometimes referred to as **Self-Care**)
---
Maybe, but it's not an end. This could be a yearly occurrence. To always remind survivors of what they could face. Maybe The Red Curtain?
---
Oh hey P3 meg I'm not doing anything important I'm just making a meme about the trapper nothing to see here keep running
---
&gt;:(
---
I don't have a suggestion for a killer but I have one for Nea.
---
[https://imgur.com/4PCLZpS](https://imgur.com/4PCLZpS)
---
\^Feel like its pretty accurate to her in game character model.
---
Inb4 6.25 heal speed
---
PC - Live
---
Healing often stops at 95%, both from the injured and dying state. It's cost me a few games since I have to wait a short bit before finishing. I can't seem to replicate it, but it's happened about twenty times the past week. It might be related to me running We'll Make it. I have some friends in the same game report the same issue, but it doesn't seem to affect them as often as I get it.
---
Spec: https://i.imgur.com/6nA440X.png
---
Honestly I love Jeff's design and perks. Breakdown is incredibly fun to use and distortion is a great utility perk. I love how some of his perks are metal related too (breakdown, distortion)
---
Yes everyone post your scoreboards on reddit. We all love lookong at numbers
---
Honestly I wait to see how they play. I feel the word toxic has gotten so over used the past few years. Now just seeing a p3 Claudette with a flashlight is considered toxic.
---
Sorry, my game isn’t in English
---
The problem isn't the way perks works but rather that no one takes anything that isn't meta which is the 4 perks you named.
---
I think it's telling that they jumped straight to "disabled RBTs in Endgame Collapse", rather than trying out "RBTs also cause the collapse to slow, like a hooked or dying survivor".
---
Lore-wise, the point of the collapse seems to be that the Entity is bored that the killer is no longer in control of the match. Which is why getting survivors hooked or downed results in the timer slowing: The killer is back in control, the Entity is once again amused. Couldn't they try balancing inside of that framework first, rather than going with the most ham-fisted methods first?
---
I feel like you wanted to make a deep, insightful point only, instead, you revealed you were high as a kite right now.
---
I am going to suggest the Spiter or the Boomer from L4D for the Plague
---
Agreed.
---
P3 Feng Min is always a good option
---
Now I want to see a DBD dancing game spin off.
---
It'd be called Dance Till Daylight and would have [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sCBJ-14K2Q) as its main theme.
---
Glad to hear you like the idea :)
---
And a 20 second stun
---
What platform do you play on? I want to make sure to not chase anyone but you. Then hook you with leather face, have my chainsaw revved up and literally sit in front of you for the entirety of your sacrifice time.
---
Is EW2 worth playing if I wasn’t really feeling the first one?! Played an hour into it and it wasn’t doing anything for me. Curious about the second one since a few people have said it was better
---
i have the same issue
---
4 bamboozles: up to 4 windows blocked for 4x the normal time
---
4x enduring: stun the survivor instead
---
4x brutal strength: 80% faster break speed.
---
4 m&amp;a: No terror radius, also, you have fly vision. In chase: iridescent button
---
claudette isn't toxic since most p3 claudettes are crouching around the map with urban evasion
---
This is for nurse.

**Boner Within 3**
---
EGC is 2 minutes instead of 3 minutes. Terror radius change on Pig was reverted and they're re-reviewing the other change. Remember Me is being re-reviewed. Exit gates were changed back to 20 seconds. And Legion got slightly buffed since his initial nerfs and they're looking at possibly buffing him a bit more.
---
The patch for sure initially was very against killers, but the community has improved it's quality immensely.
---
I Think this time the fault goes 2 playstation network since i get the same error on overwatch
---
had a team try to do something like this after I grabbed one of their friends and fortunately I was playing hill billy and I was smart enough to drop the person before they wiggled out. entire team was swarming hook to save friend but they got trapped at a really unsafe pallet so it was free chainsaws as they couldn't all jump over together. gotta know when to hold em and when to fold em.
---
No idea.
---
Go to add-ons now will be Iridescent Button (smash pallets when you vault them) and a cooldown add-on.
---
he definitely would be scary. have you seen anima though? she's terrifying, and she hums clare de lune and constantly says "sebastiaaaaan"
---
Good post bad title
---
100% agree with this. ITs just a matter of hes boring now, just another "free first hit, m1 them cause 115" killer, which just isn't intresting. Ontop of that, hes just one of the worst killers now, as deep wound is pointless, applying absolutly ZERO pressure on anyone with it. It does not do anything, feral frenzy may as well just inflict broken for 20 seconds, it'd basically be the same thing. While better for the game, it butchered Legions power, and hes now just another killer whos 115 so that he can m1 people when hes not able to do other stuff. I'd much rather a killer have a intresting, power heavy gameplay and be slower then just giving them 115 so they can m1 when their power is weak.
---
He might be better but he lost a lot of what made him unique. The Legion's style and feel was ultimately what was more appealing to me and now it kinda feels like he lost it. He gets a free first hit if you dont fuck up and then he just becomes an m1 killer.
---
Trust me, I know I should, but I want the satisfactory of getting them, you know what I mean?
---
True, but Pyramid Head would definitely look cool.
---
It would probably be Chris Walker as a killer, even if his backstory got (I believe) a little more complicated when you learn more about the Walrider. There's more killer fodder in 2 as well, even though that's the inferior game, in my opinion.
---
you fool. i am a survivor. we have taken your plans and are stockpiling odd bulbs and toolboxes.  you cannot save yourselves.
---
Well you will get better in chase so that nice if you dont mind throwing a game.
---
I don't think its a question of being a puss, or that it's hard to play against him, its just that, outside of maybe the Doctor, Freddy is the most un-fun killer to play against. Whenever I hear his lullaby, I roll my eyes and contemplate DC'ing.
---
Survivors will vote with a DC if they are in a game they know they are not going to enjoy.
---
Biggest movie of all time? Now this is a lie 😉🤔😂
---
is it just me or does Legion look like the "I smell Pennies" guy
---
I prefer the second game by a mile to be quite honest. It has a very different feel.
---
The ending is.. really sad too.
---
It's definitely worth getting.
---
I know you said "Pop off" already. But I'm talking about many games. And I don't struggle vs her anymore than I do vs other killers.
---
But it seems that you came here to state your opinion without a possibility of discussion. I won't bother to poke a restless mind since it won't budge.
---
Have good day
---
could be the rapper?
---
I, too, read the post
---
Lmfao I know, I had a good laugh
---
Literal pig
---
Kindred is so useful but not a lot of people use it
---
5
---
Yeah i know, i just didn't feel like putting a disclaimer saying "not literally"
---
People who get face camped and laugh about it have big PP
---
That juicy face camp afterward &gt;&gt;&gt;
---
I would say next weekend, let word spread around, then we do it &gt;:)
---
I agree
---
It's just too situational for me, I prefer slap literally any offering there instead.
---
I mean it’s not overly hard to make..
---
4 prove the selves. Get done with a gen in 5 seconds flat
---
Sounds great, but my usual technique for getting rid of moris is using them on games where I have 2+ Claudettes in my lobby.
---
It’s always annoying facing groups like that, but they always die in the end. You just gotta slug through the 10-15 minutes of SWF-Shenanigans, and then they run out of Pallets/Flashlight Charges and suddenly they seem much more afraid of you.
---
This is why I like using Save The Best for last, easy to chain hits to altruistic Survivors taking hits for the weak ones.
---
It’s from hacking
---
Dumbass
---
Thank you! Might I ask what you like so much about it? It’s my first fanmade Killer so I know the Perks definitely could use some work, and I’m not all too sure about the power, but I’m big on story-writing so I feel I got that good at least
---
He's not wrong. For the most part, the ambush is useless once people know to look out for you.
---
Don't give me this crouching at loops crap either. That shit doesn't work against decent survivors. I laugh when Pigs try that crap.
---
Duh. Duhduh. Duh. Duhduh.
---
thank you!
---
Are they even on ptb yet? Thought they go online later
---
Yup. I had it prior to Jane. Idk if that means anything and my Meg has been P3 since before Jeff
---
Your example of an add-on that changes frenzy is the exact thing the devs have been repeatedly missing out on with Legion. Effects like that should have been tied to the mix tapes, to help differentiate each member of the Legion from each other.
---
Eminems coming?
---
Already? That looks sick!
---
Only if it has a Crazy Frog ringtone
---
right?! i got on PTB in the first place to test dedicated servers and boy oh boy do the servers need FIXING
---
4 noed, once generators are powered, you move 16% faster, hitting a survivor will instantly mori them with no animation.
---
4 unnerving presence, theres a skill check as long as youre doing an action, the only way that you dont have one is if one is already active or youre outside the terror radius. The skillcheck cannot be hit as the thread does not exist therefore progress to any action cannot be made.
---
4 franklins demise, hitting a survivor will destroy all their items they have in that survivors inventory.
---
4 enduring, you cannot be stunned, instead the survivor stuns themselves
---
I mean you could try to level her or keep leveling her in the hopes I perk will show up, I haven’t had this but I’m no where near close enough to getting all the perks on any survivor
---
Billy should be Billy from the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy.
---
I remember how they changed the hag. She used to be fairly weak but with enough practice could be pretty decent (but you probably wouldn't practice her when you could just play nurse.) Se people kept saying buff her to be a 115 ms killer as a bandaid solution but instead the dev's changed her power to be much better with it letting her place her traps faster and teleport farther.
---
This made her (in my opinion) amazing and probably top 5 killers if you know how to play her without her being stupid broken. Plus when playing against her she actually is kinda scary (mostly jump scares but if she decides to teleport to the trap you triggered it's still pretty scary and tense.) I'm really glad they realized that just making ms slightly faster would only be a temporary fix.
---
But legion is if they decided to just give the move speed and ignore the power. Sure he isn't to terrible but his ability leaves a lot to be desired.
---
Especially when he was first teased we thought we could play as multiple killers in the same match that would appear from a locker that we switched would from or the killer had multiple personality disorder and he could change forms on the fly like the doctor.
---
Instead we got a bunch of hoodlums that count as a diffrent skin half we have to pay for.
---
I'm talking across map.
---
Aka how to sneak "Sunglasses At Night" into your theme song without copyright infringement.
---
I’ve leveled her 10 times and no perks shown. Again, I had it before and now it’s just disappeared. Idk what happened
---
I am super scared about this. I play survivor and killer equally, and I am worried about people having spoilers in their names or salty survs/killer spoiling it. Am literally terrified. I'm so scared I won't even read the comments to this post haha sayonara
---
Can’t wait for the 2.8 patch where Behavior decides it isn’t fair to let the Wraith cloak after the hatch has opened.
---
I recall seeing tweets saying that BHVR would let them announce Ghostface's addition into DBD themselves, rather than BVHR doing it (can't remember who owns the character).
---
Idk, a lot of people love this but it's not for me. The clear cut winner of the last one was the clown for me
---
I can't tell you how often I have Ruin cleansed within 30 seconds of the match. Its way more often than having matches where it doesn't get found at all.
---
Meaning every male that calls Myers daddy is gay 
---
**Dun Dun DUUUUHHHHHHHNNNNNN**
---
u/yasurebout this one for plague plz, I laughed too hard at it and now everything hurts XD.
---
A Cyperpunk skin would be lit
---
You mean Feng Min.
---
Mori Monday
---
They reverted that change as it was too easily abused by survivors.
---
*squints at noise notification*
---
*throws hatchet at the moan*
---
Yeah I feel like Myers should be the only one where he isn't in the natural menu screen stance but rather he's just standing somwhere else way in the background just staring.
---
Yeah I noticed the traps are like half open when I was playing vs a Trapper the other night.
---
I mean it’s better than getting Lerys six times in a row
---
Thank god they don't listen to most of this community's ideas.
---
Honestly hit boxes feel worse on the PTB right now to me than they do in the live servers. I know it's early testing and not the final product, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little disappointed.
---
Family guy puking scenes as the plag.
---
https://youtu.be/7xwlTs-mQ2Y
---
Yeah if the killer isn’t paying attention to gens.. what games only last five mins that’s bs
---
Nurse and billy
---
When I was chasing the Claudette towards the pallet I was like "is that trap active? *snap* I guess so."
---
The 4 perks I wanna run in a build are Balanced Landing, Poised, Deliverancd and Borrowed Time. I also want/like Aftercare, Deliverance, Unbreakable, Adrenaline, Sprint Burst, Empathy, Urban Evasion
---
he looks slightly better
---
As long as his alternate outfit is the classic one. I hate his outfit in the second game.
---
they should go full meta and give the legion a mask that has the DC icon on it
---
They didn't listen to the complaints. They changed it back because the pig can just crouch to get rid of her tr anyway.
---
Isn't the issue the toxicity of the players themselves?
---
Wouldn't that just result in a revoking of people's ability to play?  I admit my idea is a harsh one, but flat out removing players seems harsher still, and would result in less games. 
---
Am I interpreting the situation wrong?
---
i mean the legion are children who are just murder happy, they're not exactly artists
---
Wtfff how is the survivor menu showing 😂😂
---
You'd have a lot of Dc's and hate mail. Sounds fun lets do it!
---
Did they now? Well thx for letting me know.
---
i waste all my moris when before i prestige a killer
---
That's not an excuse for something having literally no answer in a PVP game. You can balance something around having a high skill cap with a high payoff without removing any possibility of counterplay.
---
as a console player is nurse really that bad? cause on console some of the other killers are worst imho.
---
That's bullshit. A lot of people are mad because there are far too many nerfs to their power when they could have stopped at 2 or 3 and kept them fun to play without making them far too strong.
---
 "We know that ***hit registration*** and disconnection handling are two of our top issues and we are actively working on those. Migrating to Dedicated Servers will give a better environment and tools to manage disconnections ***and to improve hit registrations***. A multidisciplinary team is working on both features, but they will not be ready for the launch. More information will be released in the next Dev Update."
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ao7c57/pig_really_needs_some_addon_reworking/
---
&gt;(Looking at all of Pig's addons effects there are) a total of **10** viable addon effects for Amanda. 9 if we don't include Rusty Attachments which have been powercrept on by Sloppy Butcher. This doesn't even consider the fact that certain addons are only really good when combined with certain other addons. Do you see the problem with every Pig player running the same handful of builds every game?
---
~
---
&gt;And this isn't even mentioning the rarity of all of her good addons. Again for a laydown of the useful addons by rarity:
---
&gt;* 2 out of 4 (50%) of Pig's Common addons are good
---
&gt;* 2 out of 5 (40%) of Pig's Uncommon addons are good
---
&gt;* 4 out of 5 (80%) of Pig's Rare addons are good
---
&gt;* 3 out of 4 (75%) of Pig's Ultra Rare addons are good
---
&gt;* Both (100%) of Pig's Ultra Rare addons are good
---
&gt;Do you notice that the two most common rarities have the least amount of useful addons? This also (again) doesn't account for addons which are only really practical in given builds and can't really be included in other builds, such as Tampered Timer without RBT stall to compensate.
---
The least toxic p3 is quentin in my experience,  the most is nea or feng
---
Unless you’re playing on the ptb then yes it’s the killers connection
---
Where were you guys messaging?
---
I guarantee you'll be changing your tune if you ever go against ZubatLEL or Marth88 on Nurse. Top tier Nurse players basically confirm themselves that once you've mastered Nurse you're basically not playing DBD anymore.
---
What challenge?
---
It really should just reduce the timer by like 3 or 4 of the 10 seconds. Punishing, but not damning. Or let them use it when it's not full so they take the 4 (so stupid they increased it that much) seconds and then start it up again.
---
:O i need this
---
...And you think that means survivors won't be hit through pallets, through windows, and around corners because why exactly?
---
I think this is a good compromise. She'd still be powerful but not ridiculous, and more friendly to people learning her.
---
Yeah a yearly reminder.
---
Makes them worse than live Legion.
---
Looks nice.
---
But I'm not gonna mess with any game files , even if they are only images. Spent way too much money on this game to end up getting banned, even if it's a one in a million chance. 
---
As soon as the devs themselves say it's allowed (instead of their "use at your own risk" crap) then I will use those perk icons for sure.
---
Brazilian servers: 250 ping.
---
I'm from Curitiba, Paraná. Not that far away from São Paulo
---
that actually gives me an idea. next time a survivor sends me a hate message on psn imma spoil end game for them. ty buddy.
---
Oh you right. Now we just need to find the right day to use them on. Like maybe Halloween or something else.
---
I had an idea for a “quitters queue” match people who repeatedly disconnect together. Only let them back into regular queuing when they complete a certain number of matches consecutively without quitting, let them screw each other over 
---
Oh, and to prevent them from simply killings themselves on first hook to complete matches quickly require them to achieve a minimum score otherwise the match doesn’t count towards their requirement to get back in the regular queue
---
LMAO
---
Yeah but it would be a amazing event and historical for the game.
---
I loop them around and waste as much time as possible and when they finally get me I DC at the hook before hook...by that time team is escaping and he’s pissed lel
---
Definitely strawberry blonde
---
Jokes on you, my friend already did
---
(Laughs in Razor Wire and Workshop Grease literally helping the Survivors.)
---
Once I started slugging they actually started giving me a run for my money a lil bit not gonna lie. When I started sluggin they were all injured so I thought I would be able to quickly snowball it but the fuckers knew how to heal fast and even with nurses calling(and surveillance) I had a hard time finding anyone that I wasn't already directly chasing/dealing with.
---
But yeah, not a fun experience in the slightest. They even had the audacity to say 'gg' in chat.
---
Oh my lord was I mad.
---
That's not the point. It literally doesn't make since for me to vault a window, and be 7 or 8 steps away from the killer, and get hit because they swing at the window. If you thing that's fair I don't know what to tell you.
---
Death is not an escape but DCing is.
---
It does, but you'll see a lot of disconnects.

I seriously don't understand why the PTB doesn't use a Survive With Friends version of the game. Give everyone every perk at level 3 and 50 copies of every item and addon. How the fuck are we supposed to test perks or addons if we can't fucking get them after half an hour of grinding?
---
It's not that hard to dodge a decent Nurse either imho
---
Truth
---
this doesn't happen in most &lt;100 ping lobbies but will consistently happen in every game of &gt;120 for me. hopefully they can get the lag compensation we desperately need when the dedicated servers roll out this summer

Wondering what zee perks would do.

The double BP weekend that's in May? Lol. This can be so evil and it would shake up what perks survivors usually run.

It's a shame you have the clown already, bobble the clown (scp-993) would have been a great cover

I still think that some of the nerfs were overkill and that this rework as a whole largely erases Legion's core identity as a Killer. I still think they're worse than the likes of even Wraith.
---
Agreed. I only remember one match where Ruin worked in the long run. They found in 2 minutes but I was playing Hag so I defended the shit out of it.

Might as well. But I'm playing with them the way I usually do. (Hook survs twice before mori because otherwise its way too quick. I like a challenge. I want them to suffer and not know when its coming &gt;:) )
---
But could you change your character mid game?
---
lmao we both know that you're not getting hit "7 or 8" steps away fucking lol give me a break
---
I don't even see them working at rank 1 to be honest. They don't work for or against me when I see them.

He’s Fabulous!
---
BHVR: Please don't use pink tier items/addons and Ebony Moris on the PTB because it skews data and makes it harder for us to judge the changes and their effects on an average match.

Also BHVR: *Doesn't disable pink tier items/addons and Ebony Moris.*
---
The only main problem i have with his changes is still losing a portion of you power meter for normal attacks. Why is that still a thing for him?

Ace

i dont think we should do this because perks already do this

I could not control my character at all, but i could control the menu and do stuff like open the [bloodweb](https://i.imgur.com/02cKwV5.jpg). [Here](https://i.imgur.com/aXMjsWi.jpg) is another screenshot i took of the situation. Not sure if it's a new or old glitch but it happened to me for the first time and it was right after the dedicated servers update.
---
There are videos of people showing how broken the hit boxes are all over YouTube and Twitch. Maybe it's more like 4 or 5 steps, but it's still ridiculous. When the killer swings and misses, they don't deserve the hit.
---
As someone who plays both survivor and killer fairly equally, I mostly agree. I think as killers we don't necessarily need the speed boost it gives, but overall, its not hard to cleanse totems. If you see one, cleanse it. That's what I do when I play surv. You never know who's gonna have NOED.
---
I meant more along the lines of they need to fix the “reasons” why players are actually DC’ing.
---
Survivors DC if they’re getting facecamped.
---
Survivors DC if they get tunnelled.
---
Survivors DC if they are the first one down over fear of getting camped and tunnelled.
---
Survivors DC over a crazy hit-box downing them.
---
Killers DC if their totems get destroyed too early.
---
Killers DC if they can’t catch a survivor quickly enough.
---
Killers DC if gens get popped too quick.
---
I’m aware there are others reasons and some do it because they can and they want to ruin the match or because they don’t like the killer they are against, however it seems to have caught on very recently that it’s ok to DC. 
---
Mainly because certain DC’s occur out of frustration with certain aspects of the game which in turn creates more of a blasé attitude to DC’s as they become more common.
---
I have the same problem, but on PS4. Started happening a few games ago, and now occurs every game starting with first action.
---
 [This should help you out](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/92hxzi/how_to_wreck_with_the_power_of_darn_an_indepth/)
---
TL;DR - Hit and run, down to the basics. You don't really focus on taking out your first few survivors, but rather keep putting people to sleep until a good opportunity shows up.
---
Here's your sign
---
I never ever ran into every game its mori or iridescent axe guaranteeing death. That would be insane. Match after match
---
Death
---
that shit that they introduce in ash paragraph
---
Killer wounds can't be healed. :(
---
no i personally dont think so because it gives the massive disadvantage of not being able to stealth
---
Oh yeah...
---
Kappa,
---
Seriously Freddy in the right hands is viable.
---
Killers get teabagged from previous games then take it out on next survivors. Survivors get face camped tunneled then teabagg the killer next game. Only a matter of time before everyone is toxic.
---
I mean, correctly if I'm wrong, but a survivor cant use a firecracker more than once, so something is definitely up.
---
I understood that reference
---
I like when survivors dead hard past a trap, because then they realize that they are in a loop and can't do that a second time.
---
You can’t counter hatch grabs. Once you’re cooked. Even if you try to bait out the hit, if the Killer has full stacks of STBFL he can actually hit you and grab you before you can jump in. 
---
Besides, what you’re asking for isn’t “counter play.” You’re asking that survivors have the advantage at the Killer’s expense.
---
I do like the ideas behind the changes but I personally think that having the deaf affliction for 60 seconds would be incredibly annoying for survivors &amp; doesn't really serve many purposes during a chase.
---
For Franks Mixtape I would suggest maybe making it the only speed add-on for Frenzy or doing as you mentioned, increasing all the stats around the duration &amp; recharge of Frenzy.  
---
Your stab wound Suggestion is really good. It provides an incentive to heal &amp; helps the Legion with tracking injured survivors. My only issue with it is that the effects are a bit weak for a very rare add-on. Maybe apply a 20% reduction to repair speed while Injured after being hit by Frenzy. This would encourage survivors to heal while also not being annoying if stacked with perks like Sloppy.
---
lol I love how salty survivors don't understand the difference between latency and hit boxes. Fucking hilarious. I also love how you always cite ~muh youtube videos~ as if they're not intentionally put together to create a narrative
---
well its just the problem with it is that you have to waste 1-2 minutes looking for the totems when you dont exactly know if the killer has it
---
With new match making or servers you'd probably be at the menu longer than the lobby. ;-P
---
what's it say?
---
They nerfed the cooldown add-ons.
---
He seems better because it's the ptb. He punishes low skill harder, but good players can just loop him and ptbs are known for having potatoes.
---
PS4: 
---
Multiple windows still broken (since the release of Legion). Vaulting spits you back the same side you jump through.
---
imma be downvoted. But hear me out; thats exactly why killers camp. I know i do sometimes when i play against swf.  Because seriously, swf are the most stupid things ever. esp on console. Like if you know the killer is by the guy. And the killer sees you. Why are you just gonna stand there and try to taunt and t-bag. it doesnt work. the killer is obviously going to stay close to the hook guy because now he is wasting your time, because time your t-bagging/trying to taunt, you could be working on gens making the killer sweat. So the age ole question is camping a viable strat? Yes. If the swf group is super fking stupid.
---
Was scrolling and hoping I'd see this, hahahaha.
---
This sub gets mad at every single change that happens to killers. Just look at the latest patch
---
Legion gets changed to not be hell to play against and - subreddit complains  
---
Legion can no longer abuse powers and perks - subreddit complains  
---
EGC is introduced to prevent standoffs and idle survivors - subreddit complains  
---
Pig is nerfed to not be overpowered in EGC - subreddit complains A LOT
---
Door opening speed reduced by a few seconds - subreddit has a meltdown  
---
If anything happened to a popular killer like Nurse or Billy I think this place might delete itself
---
Dedicated servers won't stop people being assholes though.

I play both killer and survivor pretty evenly. Again, if it was not an issue and intended as you say, the developers would not have acknowledged that it's a problem. Have a nice day.
---
I like how the menu is a physical thing
---
&gt;e
---
this is SO GOOD
---
Yeah, "great" is really the most unfitting word they could use. Yeah he's great against rank 13-20s now, everything below that will kite him for too long to be efficient, just like any other M1 killer.
---
Yeah, I mean the counter to this you just go do gens. Forces the Killer to just close the hatch and then he has a 50/50 chance of guessing what door you go to.
---
I've played this game since launch and I'm only just now getting the hang of nurse. Nurse mains have nothing but my respect that shit is hard as fuck. This is why I main pig as killer lmao.
---
Yeah but game after game non stop no Killers holding back. Holy shot it would be a event.
---
Stereotype
---
How y’all niggas look picking clown
---
I had one of my funnest games as a Nurse recently, and it was on Rotten Fields. I'd find a survivor, maybe get a hit off before they make it to the corn, and then it'd be a game of intense hide and seek. It's refreshing to not hang around pallets most of the game, and the map being mostly corn, the survivors had plenty of stuff to break line of sight with, making my blinks feel more balanced. 
---
I ended up getting a 2k that game, but I didn't care. I felt like I actually earned those 2 kills rather then having them handed to me because people still run in a straight line against Nurse for some reason.

Yeah I had this bill player last night doing this shit. I got hooked and the killer just stood there face camping me. This bill player then walks over and unhooks me, killer downs me and hooks me again. By this point another survivor has arrived and bill starts bodyblocking them so the killer downs them as well. Then bill comes back and unhooks me again while the killer hooks the other survivor. 
---
I said fuck it at that point and DC'd, reported both the killer and the "mini killer"
---
Make the pig a Minecraft pig
---
I feel like pulling on some insane/crazy people that aren't exactly "horror" could be cool. Something like Jacket from Hotline Miami could be interesting, armed with a baseball bat.
---
a team like this would be the perfect time to play billy just one shot someone and as soon as another person comes oneshot them as well perfect map pressure.
---
Well, I haven't finished concepting them atm but what I can tell you is:
---
Names from left to right are Union, Caffeine Binge, Beacon Of Hope. Caffeine Binge is gonna have something related to exhaustion and tokens, Union will also be tokens and Beacon Of Hope will be aura related.
---
Hillbilly, chainsaw man that’s not Leatherface, fast man with chainsaw, yeehaw chainsaw boi, boi that does the speed with a device used to cut trees are all good choices for console due to the skill that can work with a controller yet being powerful with some skill.
---
Yup, that would be the plan. His EW 1 outfit as well as the blue shirt outfit and drifter.
---
Iron grasp for what? The hooks are legit right next to each other..  deer stalker is for people who slug so I dont get your build.
---
Guys spread the word. Lets make it a thing.  Get your fellow killers in here and lets hammer this out and make it happen.
---
Peppa pig
---
Lol imagine if killers Dc everytime they see a Claudette
---
I've been toying with the idea of adding Darth Vader as a killer. There could be a Death Star level and his name in-game could be The Sith or The Dark Lord. His perks would somehow utilize the force (force push, pull etc) and his Mori would obviously be force choke.
---
I have a lot of fun using bamboozle, brutal strength, and fire up on Myers. Then I just toss on bbq for the bp
---
The top one is the one I saw
---
Good players can loop any 115 killer, I don't see your point.
---
Why bother blurring your 1778 shards and 26,014 bloodpoints?
---
Clearly some nsfw on the huntress
---
How do you fix people being mad because they get outplayed or have a bad match? First one downed, totem gone, gens popped too quickly, tunneled? You don't fix people being butthurt without addressing the community. It's not on the devs to make the game easier for you so you don't DC
---
I never saw them use the word rework, link? I'll stand corrected but I keep seeing this point and I always read update and changes when it was a statement from anyone at DBD.
---
i mean... it is doable. not easy but is doable.
---
Me with Feng and The Spirit.
---
Probably hasn’t leveled it up enough to get the perks he wants.
---
it's not a counter, you are at a loss of braincells if you think it is
---
Pig is now peppa pig
---
"Freddy is F tier after the rework"
---
Because survivors get the most overpowered unbalanced perk in the game. Telepathy. But then they like to cry about something like noed they have complete control over
---
A lot of these guys have said Doctor, and I'd like to point out that if you're going that route then Distressing is a great idea since it A) Increases your terror radius, which'll help build madness in survivors more quickly and B) Increases bloodpoints in the deviousness category by 100%
---
The alien &lt;3 or even the predator.
---
Peppa pig amanda
---
i would say after the changes yes
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
My thing is, its upsetting to go through all that effort, taking the aggro so your team can escape, just to go down because of NOED or getting bloodlusted and die on your first hook because the killer is upset you ran from them good and has to secure a kill by being a dick and hitting you on the hook.
---
Weirdo
---
From the patch notes it's a 2.325 second stun with both addons, which is a 0.575 longer stun than before. In my experience so far, and from what I've seen the movement speed absolutely makes up for it. It's easier to use in deadzones between pallets, whereas before you were better off using it after blocking a window or a pallet.
---
That’s the new collapse they added to the PTB, and have been taking about for the whole month.
---
&gt;  I think I’m done with this game haha.
---
...It's a bug in the PTB fucking christ, relax
---
Salty survivor main spotted.
---
I fail to see how his "feel" would change unless you were either tunneling a survivor to death using his frenzy, which survivors couldn't get away from and was pretty broken. or moonwalking. As I see it, the devs made it so that his power has to be used as intended this time around, which is using frenzy to waste survivors time and also to find more survivors. I was hesitant at first, but I quite like the change, both as the killer and as survivor. Let me know if I'm missing something
---
Precisely. Just leave the traps as is. She’s already a lower mid-tier Killer: there’s no reason to think that the endgame collapse is going to make her more OP than Nurse or Billy. Let the community play around with it before we make any rash decisions that might make a mediocre Killer even worse. Besides, it’s just absurd that survivors be allowed to walk out of a trial with a death trap attached to their head with zero consequences.
---
ok thanks i just wanted to make sure before i bought him
---
Please cite when the devs said being hit through pallet tosses, around corners, and through a window are problems
---
I do. Prove me wrong.
---
ok thanks that would be very appreciated
---
Oh for sure, we're quick to judge, and we have no experience with it, but then again, BHVR isn't perfect either, as shown by Cote's insistence that Killers are perfectly fine, fun, and good, despite numerous times on stream being fucked around with, or just having a bad time in general.
---
So ideally, we combine the two, take the raw ideas and general direction from the community (So if the community in a large majority, across various media is saying "hey, X is unfun, it'd be nice to have a rework" or "This is very much unnecessary, I believe Y would be a much better change"), and combine/refine it with the actual numbers, testing and knowledge from the development team, to create as close to a perfect solution as we can.
---
But that's a perfect world, and considering the history of this game, I've got very little hopes for it, I can't see them not soldiering on by themselves, only stopping when we have such a massive wave of, to be fair (and I agree with the Pig posts, I think it could have been handled infinitely better, but I'm glad they're doing this much at least), childish rage/outcry, to give them some reason to heed us.
---
Yo u probably got to wait like a month we finally got meg and trapper mining costumes that was revealed a month ago. I really would buy this new legion one looks so badass
---
the clown is good because he shortens the distance in loops with his bottle also he can force survivors to do meduim vaults with his bottle and can interfere with survivors he can get hits more consistently than the average m1 killer with standard movement speed and lunge
---
nope, its a feature.
---
I mean, at that point you’re wasting your own time cause you didn’t even get blood points for being toxic lol
---
Also, console or PC?
---
Sounds like a fun idea
---
Cept the endgame stuff would be bs with current version of the pig. The balance change is happening alongside for a reason.
---
While I definitely agree that killers should not be balanced around addons, legion being a perfect example, they still need to be tested for bugs.
---
Thanks
---
So same as always?
---
Okay, how?
---
well after this match i didn’t teabag anybody, i logged off and cuddled with my guinea pig XD
---
According to whom?
---
If killers could be at four places at one time, you'd be making a lot of sense.
---
Yeah...
---
i have played it a couple times on console but buying it on pc literally in like 20 mins so im kinda new to dbd i have only played it at my friends house it was on his ps4
---
to what he said in the vid.
---
You mean the fucking random in Monto's end game chat? fuck off
---
I never said those are specifically the problem. The problem is throwing down a pallet, getting a few steps away, getting hit. Vaulting a window, getting a few steps away, getting hit. Being outside of the killer's lunge, still getting hit when they swing. 
---
You're fucking dense.
---
Make it so we can change themes in the main menu
---
yeah but i feel like the only reason they nerfed her was because of combining endgame perks and the strongest rbt addons
---
Nea would be like Violet from Friday Part 5 imo. The tomboy rocker character.
---
That. Does. Not. Happen.
---
Nea
---
Mom?
---
Nothing feels better than forcing a chase for so long the killer gives up and goes for someone else
---
You must have missed the news yesterday - they nerfed the cooldown addons again after Monto said it's still viable, so now both addons combined reduce it to 3 seconds. It's really not viable anymore against anyone who has half-decent map knowledge.
---
Guys I talked to have like 400 -600.  I was thinking imagine every killer spammed them over and over. Survivors would have a blast too just because it would change the meta for a day.
---
This. Against a team of good survivors, Billy gets stomped. The only people who think he is overpowered are W key gamers who don't think they should get punished for running in a straight line.
---
Mettle of Man, Ash's teachable perk
---
Alright so I was not able to find it. It was in a patch noted details as the legion update or rework if you want to call it that was released. I am fairly certain they mentioned "mini rework" (other games I play if someone gets a mini rework some skills leave and new ones are added so I was expecting a change to his feral frenzy that was not  mostly stat changes and changed how you used him which us sorta true now.)
---
I could have also gotten confused since other people posted this to be a rework and talked about it as such. I also remember someone (I'm 90% sure the dev's said) that freddy would get a rework as well as legion. So there could be confusion stemming from there. Either way sorry I could not find it but I'm glad you pointed this out to clarify things.
---
Solidarity?
---
The second I saw this I knew there was no way this guy was a nurse main lol. Nurse is not easy to play and takes practice
---
Whats stbfl?
---
K, cool. If you say so.
---
I don’t get it. I thought people find cheekbones attractive?
---
Everything on the interwebz is true if it is posted. Sooooooooo yeah.
---
I never moonwalked, I chained my attacks, I never used frank's, I never tunneled off hooks and yet I am really bad. People aren't mad that he is nerfed, in terms of performance he is probably better, the problem is the entire identity of the legion is gone. He is another bland M1 killer that is going to get his ass handed to him by MoM. The entire premise of a speedy killer is gone.
---
I think he's pretty much the only killer who can't harm survivors unconditionally.
---
Her bloody red eyes &lt;3
---
PS4. Doesn't seem to be a general issue though, I'm getting lots of games with rank 15 to 20. Well I suppose at least I'll get loads of BP
---
Right but what about pig would be uncounterable? It’s not like we are all running around with bear traps on our heads when we finish gens very often
---
Christmas theme is best theme
---
"You're one *ugly* mothafucka..."
---
why are you so angry lol
---
calm the fuck down, I won't argue, devs havent said that this is a game breaking bug yet so it might be a hidden patch feature.
---
Provided the game doesn't crash because for some fucking reason every single time I bring a mori the game crashes.
---
I know that many stuff has its reason for endgame collapse purposes or has been removed, but still I had to make this
---
Jokes on you, I've had my post-game chat closed since forever.
---
Dead by edge
---
Ghostface, I suppose. And I know it's impossible (basically) but I'd like Jason.
---
Yep. 
---
Some people will still use him to tunnel one survivor at a time, yet complain he is garbage tier.
---
The funny thing is that **no one saw this coming**.  I've tried explaining that dedicated servers aren't going to fix anything.  Laggy killers will still lag, except now you won't be able to dodge their lobbies.
---
Stefano would be great, call him the Artist. Have it so taking a picture of a survivor starts tracking their location. If someone can think of a better power please post.
---
How the fuck do you like the slow ass vaulting speed, it makes him feel so sluggish.
---
Also, play both sides. You will learn a lot if you do.
---
They did that as a gimmick to justify auric skins.
---
Leave Bea alone
---
now you're just making conspiracies up out of your ass to justify being an idiot
---
ok thanks for the advice is meg a good survivor i saw someone playing her and she looked cool also what survivor is the best in your opinion
---
As a Feng Main, I appreciate this.
---
Absolutely.
---
Yeah, you're talking about the 2017 Halloween Theme, and it was indeed amazing. Last year's was good, too, but they established quite different atmospheres; not necessarily a bad thing, but I still think I prefer '17's.
---
I save all of my Mori's for Monday, it is the only day I allow myself to have any form of toxic play. How the survivors play dictate how long the game goes on :)
---
Honest, I want more original killers.
---
yeah but just saying i think that it would be impossible to get out with a beartrap and blood warden active along  with remember me and a beartrap on their head i feel like it would be a small chance to get out
---
4x Brutal Strength for 80% reduced time to break a pallet.
---
Also on Xbox
---
damn, you must be bullied at school.
---
it's amazing, thank you
---
Neat
---
I am the bully, nerd
---
but i thought she was a KILLER
---
Put an actual pig on The Pig
---
I don't know this guy but he seems pretty cool.
---
I can smell future husbando wars
---
Do you remember what his name was? I think that was the same person I dealt with
---
Glad you like it! :)
---
Personally, I hope the "killers' respective themes plays when you select them" thing on the current PTB makes it live. It's amazing, but it keeps the also-amazing classic themes still there if you want them. 
---
Speaking of that, I hope/look forward to the original main menu theme returning on 2.7.0. The game just doesn't feel the same without the eerie, atmospheric, depraved piano greeting me as I log in. ^^^BHVR ^^^please
---
Mint Rag hag with MYC is just brutal.
---
Thank
---
Only if they report you
---
Hookers unite!
---
You know what youre right. Let's rework it to where if the killer hits the survivor, you get all the reduced speeds instead of having the obsession die.
---
This isn't working for the Oceania players unless dedicated servers are here as well.
---
Most matches are red ping, which made it impossible to start as people leave before 5 people can even be formed.  In matches - if it ever gets there, survivor feels sluggish.  I feel like the framerate is slurring.  I can't imagine what it's like playing killer in this kind of situation.
---
About that...
---
They got their smart phone in their right hand and are texting while they wait for the next trial.
---
My boner wants cheekbone Meyers.
---
explain why he pants in place?
---
Who said that you were allowed to run at all?
---
lmao chucky wouldn't be able to see anything, imagine the pig crouching, but even lower, damn.
---
This is beautiful
---
His entire identity was cheese though.  It had to go.  He's now the only 115 killer in game that gets a free hit on every survivor.  I'm looking forward to playing him now that to do so will require actual thought.
---
That sounds a lot like Billy and Bubba tbh.
---
Maybe it'd be like half as long but it only damages survivors instead of putting them into the dying state instantly?
---
Where are my susies skins at
---
It’s all fun and games until I get teabagged from the other side of a pallet
---
What about the plague? She also gets a free hit plus he has a ranged ability.
---
Meg
---
No u &lt;3
---
I go 2 ways with this, depending on the context of how the game is being played. Either everyone escapes and lives, or I just destroy the one sandbagging his teammates. I have on a few occasions facecamped said person, to allow the team to do the gens without fear of me.
---
It's you bro
---
#PrayForAmanda She's gonna be okay! :)
---
Not getting hit at all.
---
For me:
---
Clown: Kate
---
Legion: Laurie
---
Spirit: Meg
---
Nurse: Meg
---
Hillbilly: Meg
---
Cannibal: Meg
---
Doctor: Kate
---
Freddy: Laurie
---
Shape: Laurie
---
Trapper: Kate
---
Wraith: Meg
---
Plague: Laurie
---
Hag: Kate
---
Huntress: Kate
---
Am I missing any killer?
---
Yeah if we made it auto heal one level/cleanse and speed boost that would be an indirect nerf to said killers.
---
Laurie against michael. That would make a really cool movie!
---
...or maybe the killer broke the chase because he’s a m1 killer and you’re abusing the window in ironwork’s of misery... yeah
---
It did!  It's called Halloween! 😃
---
I want to submit this for Doctor:  [https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fairlyoddparents/images/e/e6/ShinyTeeth-078.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130516175129&amp;path-prefix=en](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fairlyoddparents/images/e/e6/ShinyTeeth-078.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130516175129&amp;path-prefix=en)
---
Killers get mad that you are able to run from them, so they face camp at the end and tunnel you if you get unhooked because instead of being smart and abandoning the chase to get other easier to get survivors, they waited till the survivor they were chasing wasted all their resources so they could face camp becuase they are "toxic" when really they just played really good. It feels like punishment for playing good.
---
He runs in place while humming "SHES A MANIAC SHES A MANIAC ON THE DANCEFLOOR"
---
Technically we dont "need" any new killer but to answer your question; A new ability and perks. If you boil it down, that's all that new killers are. I have no idea what his would be but I'm also not being paid to do so but I digress. It's also financially smart, a horror icon will draw a lot more downloads and since he's licensed the only way to play him is to pay with actual money and not shares. I dont see anything wrong with this for either the devs or the customers...
---
&gt; Am I missing any killer?
---
I feel like you did this to hurt us.
---
The spitter would work better as plague
---
Keep in mind this is a stress test, the meat grinder of a testing environment.
---
May not be the point but its a huge ass point
---
r/whoosh
---
Eh, I play him with the standard bbq/ruin/spirit fury/enduring setup and it doesn't go that badly.
---
Gets rougher on certain maps.
---
inch or cm?
---
Meg would destroy Leatherface if she was in his horror movie, I also feel that Nea would do pretty well in a saw movie.

---
You actual mad lad
---
It's NOT fun and games until he kills his sister*
---
Welcome to my world, meanie
---
Speaking of Watch\_Dogs, Adams outfit looks like marcus from Watch\_Dogs 2.
---
Thats it im gonna become one of the 5 adam mains hell yeah
---
Have you even played him yet? He's definitely not the second worst killer. 
---
On that note, why does every new killer need to be extremely powerful? There's always going to be killers that are not as powerful as others, like it or not. He's fun to play as, and now he's fun to play AGAINST, and that's what matters. Not everyone can be a nurse or spirit (tbh I'd quit the game if that were the case)
---
I think they'll come up with something
---
Ghostface is known more for his sneak attacks than chases-plenty of jumpscare potential
---
They think you're lost but we all know the real lost ones are playing fornite.
---
Bad day?
---
Standard deviations above the mean.
---
Y’all wanna get some bloodmoney then be like me.
---
I've had games were all the totems get cleansed and the killer is denied NOED are great! but few and far in-between because it's hard to coordinate if all of them are done. But I still think it's fine because you can cleanse it afterwards which has also happened in many of my games
---
Because you've never played a good Nurse. There's literally nothing you can do against a good Nurse.
---
Unless of course you're on console.
---
Haha, you are right.  I would even play survivor just for the thrill.  Also Huntress Iridescent axe heads and Tombstone Myers could join in.  Basically gloves off. If you are a SWF group and want a challenge try every game with mori it would completely change the ways you play.
---
whatever you want it to be baby
---
Yesterday. It's not normal rank reset

How did you miss Tuesday's with Mori?

---
P3 Claudette...where did she go?

P3 Feng...Lithe will drag your ass to China
---
Hope it helps! ❤
---
I think you’re taking my “haha” too seriously. What’s your problem? Take your own advice and relax, geez
---
Like a Billy with NOED.
---
They are taking their inner poison out of their systems by spreading it to anonymous people online. That’s typical of today.
---
That's the Q&amp;A loading screen, which has a pic of Billy in it.
---
&gt;No matter how skilled you are, you going to lose gens against a good survivor.
---
But that's precisely what my mentality is: I don't always mind losing generators - "losing the game", if you will - if I win my chases against good survivors. While the tiles you list are all olden-day infinites (I referred to them as long wall windows), or so-called "quasi-infinites" (due to indeed constituting timesinks so major that you will usually want to avoid chasing survivors through them, if you want to actually kill as many survivors as possible (and don't have Bamboozle, for that matter)), I do not agree with the notion that they are mostly uncounterable. For one thing, there's obviously Entity blocker and Bloodlust, which you might just have to force and accept the time wasted on 2-3 loops it takes for you do so or catch up; for another, various killer abilities allow you to cut those loops short or force Entity blocker earlier. Billy, Huntress, Spirit, Trapper, Hag, Wraith (with Windstorm), Doctor, Corrupt Plague, Clown - they all have abilities that allow the player to potentially counter even these tiles - at least in the sense that you are spending less time dealing with them than someone less skilled would. There's still some interaction and room for play and therefore improvement even on these tiles, though I do obviously agree that they are not healthy for the game, and committing to chases on them not healthy for your chances to "win" the game in the traditional sense of preventing as many survivors as possible from escaping.
---
Fixed.  I forgot to hit enter twice.
---
Except BHVR has a track record of "whatever is on PTB is going to go live".
---
I know there's no way they can be so out of touch that they keep these servers, they're going to have to give us a rain check. Regardless, the community has developed a knee jerk reaction because of their history of not really listening to us all the time.
---
There would be no way for BHVR to know.
---
Just curious - how many games it took to use it even once ? 
---
The wiggle bonus is just so low ...
---
make this comment hav mor likes than th post
---
Yet the data of that 500 traps show a close result to a 1/2 on the first box, 1/4 on the second box, 1/8 third and 1/16 fourth box result, which is basically how coin flips work.
---
It's crystal clear.
---
Oh it gets better...she would sing the nursery rhyme. (One two Freddie’s coming for you) in the PITCH BLACK!  Or make the Jason sound. I have only myself to blame lmao.
---
Apparently I'm the only one that thinks this is a bad idea... And I'm probably gonna get downvoted to hell because of it. It's only because of the state of the game atm, where theres a DC around 50% of the time. This would just make that skyrocket. Red or not, they'll see that first mori, remember it happened to them the last match or so, realize it's a trend, and DC. If you enjoy causing those things to happen then I cant fault you.... But I personally enjoy playing the game the way it's meant to be played, all 4 survivors staying and (hopefully) dying by my hand.

I'm glad it looks like a Joey skin that won't have his goofy pants. But I am still disheartened that Joey has the same voice as Frank, that's so stupid.
---
Thank goodness they’re testing it in the PTB and getting feedback
---
I'm so excited to pick it up, nurse was gonna be the next one I level, just for nurses calling, but now I don't need to :)
---
2 8  S T A B  W O U N D S
---
That's way too big a penalty, especially in the case there are scenarios where people may be forced to disconnect, the game being held hostage, sudden emergency amongst others.
---
It more depends on your play style. 
---
Are you a stealthy killer?   
---
Myers, Wraith, Pig. 
---
Me personally, I prefer pig.  
---
Are you looking for Hardcore games? 
---
Nurse, Hillbilly, Huntress, spirit  
---
Here I prefer Huntress.
---
Do you like catching people in traps?
---
Trapper and Hag
---
Here I prefer Trapper
---
Looking to do the most damage to as many people as possible in a short amount of time?
---
Doctor, Clown, Legion, Plague
---
Here I prefer Doctor, though I rarely play him.
---
Looking for the underdog of killers? 
---
Leatherface and Freddy
---
I prefer Leatherface
---
Overall, I play pig. She is my main, the one I have studied the most, and learned her mechanics.
---
Just even if you're into another licensed killer is a duplicate killer (he is Legion let's be honest) really the best one to pick.  How could anybody want Ghostface over a Pinhead, Candyman etc...?  All I'm saying is there are far more inventive ones out there than another teenager in a mask.
---
The Monday Morining?
---
How is that?

It does not and doubt it ever will,it would be broken if it did

Plague absolutely does not get a free hit.  If you're referring to her purge causing broken status she needs to fill up your meter first.  I don't know how you do against her but I'm constantly breaking line of sight at loops to make this take as long as possible.  I can easily eat up 30-40 seconds at a t-wall before she breaks me.  If you're referring to her corrupt purges survivors have to choose to give her those.  Plague can literally get a guaranteed first hit with his power the moment he finds you.
---
Thanks but i dont get down with dudes like that. If you catchi.g my drift
---
I was thinking SpongeBob with the invisibility spray
---
DAE popular game is bad?
---
I’m not sure if you can call an ultra rare addon a “go-to”
---
I initially had the exhausted effect last longer, but getting some criticism definitely helps because it doesn't really matter. It basically slows down the burst they get yeah, thanks for the comment.
---
I'm not going to dv you. Your opinion is valid. I just want to make a event in the history of this game. Its like a final boss mode.
---
Now that'd be confusing as fuck for the killer, seeing like 7 different survivors in 1 game lol
---
We have literal months till it comes out. Devs have been in chat of many streamers saying this is like the most basic skeleton of how it's going to be.
---
Lol that's funny. On PC now, but for the 2 months I played on Xbox, I had hundreds of messages, more messages than I ever had in the 4 years I had the Xbox 1, times 2 or 3 at least. It's fucking insane being a killer on console. Go for it.
---
You're right.  Bunch of people on Twitter are like "People see one day of Dedicated Servers PTB and think the sky is falling!"   Buuuut... What happened the last time a PTB was out?  What got fixed before it went live?
---
Lich as next killer, Finn as next survivor. Make it happen.
---
my female dick is amazing whatever do you mean
---
I do well as Freddy but I do better as other killers. I try to keep everyone in sleep state but obviously that’s not ALWAYS possible. I let survivors escape out of my terror radius to find them with aura then hunt them down. If I can’t find a particular survivor I’ll let a wounded slept survivor escape and use them to find their friend. It’s fun, I enjoy playing him for the strategy.
---
Alternatively I could run bbq and billy and just run all over the map and instadown everyone before they ever finish a gen or hatchet people as huntress and immediately win. Just because he’s fun doesn’t mean he’s not bad. I also don’t think killer should be easy to play, so I’m not advocating for all killers to have an easy job. I prefer when 1-2 survivors escape, especially since their biggest obstacle is getting strangers to work well together.
---
You literally play with three perks most of the game. Its also a hex perk. You cant complain about it if you dont do the totems
---
The sickness thing basically gives any killer that uses the perk the same power the clown with add-ons has except they don’t need to throw a bottle? Also 4s exhaustion is still infinite exhaustion in a chase because you never stop running. So there’s basically no point of bringing dead hard.
---
And the power is straight up countered by flashlights or a swf team, it’s also pretty shitty in general.
---
Not even going to mention the other perks because they’re so ridiculous they don’t even have anything to do with Dbd.
---
how would she know he has MoM?
---
I feel like Solidarity is one of those perks if not balanced carefully it would be busted as hell.
---
You better sleep with one eye open
---
So everyone is just attracted to completely whitefaced William shatner
---
Nope. The ski lodge is abandoned. Jeff only went there to help them paint their logo.
---
Thank you for the criticisms- yes I am noticing the Bacteria perk is a bit strong, the 4s exhaustion only lasts 4s? so the Fatigue Duration alone on a lot of Killers with powers is about 4s so I thought it should be longer personally. 
---
The Jockey can move around, its hard to be flashlight stunned, it basically works like a pickup on survivor but reversed is the idea I intended. 
---
The other perks are things I came up with? They have to do with dbd, they affect things in game like Aura-reading and Movement Speed buffs.
---
Maybe you should give it another try. When I first played EW I didn't like it much either and put it to side. When the second game got announced I tried it again and it got really good in my opinion.
---
This is why I don't feel bad about tunneling someone who was just removed from the hook. If they're allowed to heal, I lose the blood pools, the (suggestive) moaning, etc.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if they heal, I now need another hit to put them into the injured state, which means they've had three hits (two from the original hook), so I need _two more_ to get back to the dying state. That's three hits compared to the one I need if I just tunnel, so I've given away a full chase.
---
I get that it feels bad to be tunneled, but so does throwing the game.
---
Lol toss beast of prey on him and he'd be a mindgame god at every pallet loop with his little midget ass.
---
Behind the tree?
---
Oh you got to girl, it'll change your life 👌
---
That doesn't look like a better suggestion to me.
---
As I stated earlier, a less harsh penalty is just to regress your currently equipped perks one by one to level 1, and then get rid of them. 
---
Also, why do people have to disconnect from the game because of emergencies.  Barring a real emergency, can't you just go afk?
---
Nope. Was just a joke.
---
A jumpscare licensed killer that wears a mask and wields a knife.  Myers *cough cough.
---
She’s so stealthy she doesn’t need a cloaking device.
---
Mettle of man op?
---
So he doesn't get his account hacked
---
It's like none of you have played the PTB.  
---
With 2 minute EGC, the RBT is a fucking death sentence to a survivor.  FFS.  Go play the damn PTB for a bit before wailing and gnashing your teeth.
---
It's crap like this is why everyone rolls their eyes at Reddit's opinions.  You are the laughing stock of the community.
---
Oh okay, I was gonna give you the benefit of the doubt, but now I don’t believe you at all :)
---
From what I understand 1 smack during the initial scream is polite; turn the ear ahattering scream into a pain grunt. Anymore than that and you're just playing with your meat. ;)
---
Yeah it's a much better game than the first was, in my opinion. It doesn't feel nearly as clunky to control, and the levels in general are just more well thought out
---
How does an arbitrary number of shards and bloodpoints lead to my account getting hacked?
---
He's Legion in appearance, that I can agree with. That being said, I bet nearly everyone here can readily tell whether it's a Legion or Ghostface (if he makes it into the game). So I dont think there would be any confusion in that regard. And now were getting into the business side of things... Like i mentioned before, a licensed killer will bring with it more money, at least when compared to an original one. So they have to find someone who's *willing* to let them use their license. If there's more than one, they're going to go with the better deal/what they think will make them more money. Tbh, I would actually prefer the killers you mentioned as well... But it may not be possible (unable to obtain license) or as financially wise (better deal/more popularity).
---
No mither-start the trial dead
---
Math tho
---
Bro exhaustion doesn’t go down when running
---
People will just DC and sign off. You'll get a few short matches that end after the first kill and mostly spend lots of time waiting because nobody is logged on.
---
Ghostface is a lot more bombastic though
---
Mikey can't jump out of lockers
---
Yeah but those are kinda jowly tbh
---
Pretty sure this was done on purpose to tell the viewers to look at Myers and ignore everything else. Pretty common in media.
---
The irony

---
Pardon my ignorance, what is an M1 killer? I see the term used a lot but I don't understand it
---
After realizing that my goal is to sleep the whole enemy crew, I found I can keep pressure up better.
---
Is it overkill to take Nurses since I see ao many people break sleep with a failed Nurses?
---
Never playing the game so you never have to hurt again
---
I definitely want Sydney as a survivor but I’d love it if we could get a Brendan James skin for ghostface to make him totally different (like different versions of legion).
---
It doesn't, that's the joke
---
What about killer addons that apply Exhaustion for x seconds, do they last for x seconds or do they last for x seconds + the remainder of the chase? Like Clown’s Solvent Jug or Huntress’ Berus Toxin.
---
2-3 people are a**holes for no reason
---
Wraith's absolutely killed me
---
Yes that's what I just said, she can't be camping her for using MoM since it hasn't even got a chance to trigger.
---
Bruh, the DBD community is sus af. FOH wit that gay shit.
---
D A R N
---
Yes, your theory about 2 ppl on gen, one on hook and one hooked is super smart etc but I play solo, so it's imposible. Sometimes I get one-hooked because everyone thinks someone else is going for me or everyone dies because everyone goes for me \^\_\^
---
We been knew
---
Lol I said something about this on another post. The face camping is real when you get downed st the end, noed or not, just because you played good.
---
What perks do you run on her besides bbq ( i love that one on spirit)
---
She is. I'm not sure who is worse, she or Legion.   
---
One thing about Legion is that he requires no skills so it's even more frustrating(maybe).
---
swap you play style up through out the game keeping them guessing if your predictable you will get downed easy ive done stuff like double backin and hoping into lockers to just standin in place and it really throw them off i learned most of these from being a nurse main myself high rank survivors can be pretty tricky
---
Pretty much
---
I saw a billy that facecamped all 4 people once at rank 1. He said he facecamps anybody who loops for more than a pallet or 2 because its an exploit. Saddest shit I've ever seen in this game.
---
Just get a real pig for Amanda and a Babushka for the Huntress.
---
I would like one of the add ons to make so i dont lose my frenzy if i miss like the potato that i am
---
All good. :)
---
I laughed.
---
If they increased killer BP gain whenever SWFs were present, I'm not sure I'd mind the stompings so much.
---
Yeah Haddonfield, Lery's, The Game vs good survivors, Ormond, Coldwind maps in general, the usual bunch.
---
Holy fuck I love this idea. Pls organize this (after the BP weekend)
---
She's not THAT hard but whatever...
---
He is better perfomance wise but not as fun
---
Now picture this... Wraith and Freddy. Two invisible fuckbois trying to fuck you up
---
Easy decision. Barbecue because Billy doesn't need ruin.
---
Holding shift to block healing.
---
bbq
---
it's billy's destiny
---
I know it's dumb, but I'll probably dump Ruin for it, at least in the BP event. It mostly doesn't live longer than a minute anyway. We'll see how it plays out.
---
One more thing I'm wondering about bamboozle: Does it increase pallet vaulting speed? Haven't had the chance to do testing on this yet, but I may have to do that tomorrow, as I really wanna know.
---
The big thing about Wraith is that the first hit is guaranteed if you can get close enough to the survivors.
---
Then you realize that it doesn't have to be the first hit anymore.
---
I like the sound of this! Let’s paint the entity’s realm red

Happens everytime I bring a mori. This is the 7th mori I've lost because of this and I am pissed.
---
Sometimes monitor and abuse + surveillance. Sometimes nurses and discordance. Mostly tracking stuff. Once I know where they are the chases are easy especially if already injured
---
It's not my post...
---
Ps4
---
That's fine and dandy but doesn't change the fact that if the Nurse is on and doesn't make mistakes, you're going down, no matter how unpredictable and crazy you run. She's got one blink to close the distance and another blink to adjust for any moves you made in the mean time.
---
They must not win, they must die. I may lose the match but that is beside the point
---
or just started his pc
---
Commenting here so I can come back later and see when the date is 😁
---
Stop.
---
Why would you care survivors without RBT do anything? You focus on those who have RBTs because they are in a bad situation or on those who are trying to save. Pig was the only killer that stand a chance of reverting the match's result after the gates are opened(lets ignore NOED, that's a bullshit perk) and it was super fun about her.  
---
I usually use all of my RBTs before the endgame but sometimes you had those miserable matches when they did gens in 3 seconds and you where chasing looping gods. It was really fun with Pig that you still had a chance to do something afterwards.    
---
Watch this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4lkpn1UX48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4lkpn1UX48)
---
&gt; It's honestly baffling that all those window spawns still exist.
---
I know... it irks me that none of the devs play enough killer to realize how broken those windows are (especially Myers house).
---
I was asking for a suggestion. Since you think its not a good title.
---
For me when it's 300 I have to get out of the lobby
---
Love it. Sweep the Leg. The enemy deserves no mercy.
---
There was a similar plan for a bloody party streamer day, but I don't think that caught on either.
---
This made me happy, thank you
---
&gt; that's the inferior game, in my opinion.
---
I don't know. I feel like 2 is a completely different game. While 1 was a full-out horror experience for me, 2 was a total psychological mind fuckup, like the plot of 2 was crazy in my opinion and scared me on a different level.
---
It should be in the summer and on a Monday so we can have the most killers available to play. Killers get the short end of the stick in a bunch of matches in DBD, so I think killers deserve a day to just unwind and enjoy the massacre.
---
 Welcome to THE TEST build.
---
But why bother learning how to play them when you can just complain to BHVR and get them buffed?
---
May I ask why?
---
Most Killer perks require the Killer themselves to do something; I highly doubt both Killers would benefit from BBQ if only one took it, and it'd take a Rap God akin to Eminem to relay 8 positions in four seconds. Certain perks (Dying Light) should definitely be given the Leader treatment though.
---
He just got the Dragonslayer (the hunk of iron, more a dab. Too big to be called a sword) and killers demon Scbiz. He got to ‘try it out’ xin this case the EGC.
---
Honestly thought I was on the for honor reddit when I saw this
---
Who’s the enderman?
---
*Mori
---
First of all, How many times are u gonna post this trash? Idk if ur just trolling at this point or if u just want attention that badly.
---
Secondly, this playstyle takes no skill and can be done by ANY rank especially with a LF using insidious. Git gud
---
Finally, if I see this again I'm going to report it to the subreddit team in terms of spam. It's getting tiresome seeing this everyday for the last like 3 or so days.
---
I've got it! The first Monday of every month isori monday
---
A good laugh lol
---
I had a bunch of kids call be a feg and a bad killer even though I killed two of them and the only reason the other two escaped was cause one of them had a key and found hatch. 2 of them literally admitted to being 13 and 11.
---
I like all the changes suggested here except Bamboozle blocking pallets. That'd be a bit too ridiculous, and every Legion who has it would run it since they'd just get a free hit or down at every pallet standoff.
---
Oh yeah. Her "Nerf".
---
Hasn't half of the nerf been wiped out BEFORE it was even live?
---
Don't worry. She'll probably get buffed from this whole ordeal.
---
Just keep complaining killer mains, it's about the only thing y'all are good for
---
strawberry blonde :).
---
I didn't agree to being a figure head. I will be happy to give advice, but overall most people just ignore me, or downvote me because my logic doesn't vibe with their desires. Dbd can still be fun for everyone involved, even if the killer gets a 4K. It's all about how you play, on if I think the game was GG or not.   
---
I stream Friday-Tuesday 9pm CST. I play dbd at least 2 of those days, because I also play with friends who want to play other games too. My viewers know all about Mori Monday's and the rules I have in place. If I play toxic games, they call me out on it. However, they also call for blood, and want to see me kill people.
---
They can still lag, but the way the lag affects them is changed. For instance, because our current lobbies are on a killers computer, that means whatever they see on their screen, is what happens, always. With dedicated servers, this isn't always the case. BHVR hasn't done it very well, yet, but servers give the opportunity to say 'okay killer you think you hit that, but you have 500 ping and the pallet is already down'
---
Obviously, not working yet, but we can hope.
---
I just made this for the fun of it and I started it about 3 days ago now-
---
I play Freddy pretty well as just an M1 killer. You just need to know when to just put someone in the dream world and let them run off or commit to a chase.
---
This got hostile fast lol
---
i'd also like to know how to do this
---
Yeah, I agree. Different experiences for sure, the first was more my speed. I was still ticked off that a major plot point (the crazy cults being 'powered' by some kind of electromagnetic interference created by the company from the first game) was hidden in a missable file. The school flashbacks and the sequence with the thing following you through the caverns at the end was really cool, though.
---
Sorry for anyone I offend... I'm just... Tired of DBD sometimes.
---
The picture is really nice
---
Bye. Noone will miss you.
---
There’s so many hard dicks in the comments rn and I’m living for it

Leprechaun would be a hoot
---
i don't think making kiler bloodpoint prostitutes is the right way to balance the game
---
the game is just another level :) you can also improve the story quality if you explore and do side missions.  tho get ready for the spooks :)
---
you are all doomed!
---
A few, surprisingly most from survivors when I'm killer. Special mention to the Ace who said my billy looked cool after getting moried.
---
It is pretty commonly known that running around the survivors, using your abilities and generally going for an entertaining match will get you more points than getting kills as fast you can. Even lore-wise it is said that the Killers are there to please the Entity and the Entity needs to feed off of hope and such.  
---
If people DC in a game and you still are going hard on them then you're probably gonna get those kills. But more likely those other people will DC when they see that you aren't a chill Killer, a Chiller if you would. You shut yourself off from more potential points because, and here is the shocker, there is no more hope at a certain point in a match.  
---
Crazy stuff, right?
---
I think the middle point is the biggest for me. Not being able to defend totems or 90percent gens hurts a lot
---
she is so cute OwO
---
bbq 
---
the perk every billy boi needs
---
I'm not against the idea of a faster unhook time, but that doesn't really benefit the survivors at all for taking a hit for an ally. BBQ provides a killer with a new objective each time he hooks, whether that is to stay nearby the hook for other survivors who were missing from his auras, or to find new ones easier. I feel like there should be something similar in the case of WGLF
---
i pretty much never use them unless someone has mori me daddy in their name i care more about having a fun game than ruining it for that one person
---
This dude looks like a thumb. No thanks.
---
The killer has to be that monster with the camera on its head... nightmares
---
Youre a newbie,not a noob, theres a big difference
---
Except that test build has a giant "player TEST build" on the right.
---
i wouldnt mind MoM if it had a way worse down side its just too good not to use atm
---
Thank you, I just want to say I started this before anything was reverted and I don’t play on PC so I didn’t know anything till I got the chance to listen to the stream as a finished this. It was more light hearted than anything
---
I can’t wait to get stabbed In the back multiple times by Mikey 😍😍😋
---
Yeah seriously one said he was 12 and I was practically a grandma to them, me being 24 and all 😂
---
Chases don't have a very high skill cap, there's really not very much to learn. The reality is, if survivors don't make a mistake, then the killer loses outright no matter what.
---
If you chase a survivor who has a strong structure with either few or weak mindgame opportunities (see: Ironworks window, Wretched Shop, just about every single pallet in both Red Forest maps for some reason, etc) and who doesn't show signs of making mistakes, you're pushing yourself towards a loss. You want the survivors that aren't bad to be the ones holding M1 on generators, and you want the bad survivors to run tiles wrong and feed.
---
Thank you!
---
Hmm and if we got a killer, then i would have to guess it would be [Anima](https://theevilwithin.fandom.com/wiki/Anima). They could even include the humming that turns into a scream when she sees you.
---
Your honor won’t let you

doesn't look his balls dropped yet. i guess they wanted someone who could relate to the community.

A real shame too. I'm fairly still a noob in many ways, and I JUST got her last month. I could tell she wasn't completely the most viable, but I loved her play style and felt I won more than lost. This nerf physically hurts my soul.

Wonder why they don't add limited mod support to the game.
---
Thank you, I appreciate the apology
---
The 6th of the 6th from 6 till 6.

i find that most survivors that i down in 20-30 are the ones that are predictable you can give even a good nurse the runaround and any extra time it takes her to down you is more time for gens to be completed but yeah after playing her for a long time i can be pretty precise with my blinks hiding/being immersed makes it harder for me to win the game because if i can find you then i have to leave to pressure the rest of the map
---
Despite the fact this is for CS:GO, I think this video does a pretty decent job at explaining interp and lag compensation.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EwaW2iz4iA
---
If people were curious as to why they constantly get hit through windows, this is why.  I feel that a Killer that actually has medium-high latency (as opposed to the 0 ping they have now) is going to make this exponentially worse.
---
Haha.   
---
\+1
---
This *is* the real world fam. BHVR is a company with a customer base. It worked.
---
And yes, the developers saw our outcry and..ugh.. "reverted the changes to the abilities" a fictional character had "to keep it fun and balanced for everyone". Therefor, the fictional character's viability (and them, since they're fictional) has been saved.
---
Hey look the plag
---
He’s probably still in his rebellious teen stage.
---
Adrenaline and Mettle...I think you had it coming.
---
I totally don't think he become worse than before, you just don't say somebody has a different opinion because he's a whack :)
---
I’d prefer if Huntress Lullaby affected the boxes. It’d make Terror radius pig more viable and give survivors a break from every game having ruin.  Also if they made Lullaby act like every other hex perk and only reveal itself when your affected by it (meaning missing a skill check or it having a stack)
---
Make the doctor a creepy doctor
---
Also when I play solo and the killer usually gets 1 or 2 more kills for camping since people go for the saves. If they leave they get 0 usually. So they are rewarded for camping
---
and devs have to balance the game around swf instead of giving killers bloodpoints for unfun game
---
Every 13th of the month is Mori Day.
---
Yo I wanna see that thing

It is a bad title. And since you're not arguing otherwise I'm not gonna humor you by spending a few minutes to come up with a good title for your post. I like your post, didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
---
Also it kinda looks scarier too
---
Woah woah. You can’t say “that’s it” after something like that. That’s a perk that would need to be *heavily* tested.

Lol thats one way to keep things fun

---
(my opinion) I can understand tunneling when there is one or two gens left to do and the Killer had no pressure at the moment. It's a sweaty tactic but if you want to have a fighting chance at that juncture, eliminating a survivor who's dead on hook is a good way to do it. I hate being tunneled but in moments like that, I can sympathize.
---
The key to each RBT is already placed in a random box when the RBT is spawned. Success is not randomly determined when searching, despite what you may have read here on Reddit.
---
Should also say:
---
**Gives the effects of the following perks for free:**
---
Aftercare
---
Bond
---
Empathy
---
Kindred
---
Adds a brand new perk:
---
**MLG SWF**
---
Everytime anyone see the **killer/totems/traps,** their locations are also revealed to your team as well. Bypass the **Blindness** status effect. Applied automatically to everyone using Discord. Increases the chance of the killer bringing a mori by **90/95/100%**.
---
if people can't tell sarcasm them idk what's they're upset about
---
EGC is also 2 minutes.
---
That means you have 2 minutes to get the trap off and open the door, all while avoiding the Killer.
---
Yea that seems insanely good. Would instantly be a meta perk.
---
The way the devs changed the pipping is so you don’t rank up for beating rubbish opponents.
---
If you kill them all on 1st hook then the team either suicided or weren’t very good, hence you shouldn’t rank up because it wasn’t necessarily your skill that won, it was also how bad the survivor team was.
---
I tried to find the site but couldn’t, any links ?
---
The stats are very interesting, but I believe the data is fabricated.
---
&gt;Chases don't have a very high skill cap, there's really not very much to learn.

From my experience of playing this game for more than 2000 hours, as well as watching other players that have played as much and more, I disagree with this statement. The time it takes for a killer to catch a survivor can vary significantly, based on their relative skill. I will use good players like Zubat after more than 4000 hours of playing this game saying that they are still getting better as my argument for now, as I don't feel like getting into all the things that can actually be done and matter in chase play. There's also the fact that most of the players in this game are bad; if chases actually were as easy and straight-forward, the majority of players would not do as badly as they do, hardly lasting 30 seconds against competent killers. You can witness this on countless killer streams, or in your own games, if you are a good killer - or just by having fellow survivors die like flies.

"This is the real world fam." haha

hahahahahaha
---
hahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Because you seem to be the title god apparently. Please sir title god give me a better title.
---
The shape and the spirit...yoinks for days
---
&gt; showed no charisma, didn't talk, and often gets snooty with other players stating their opinion
---
Sounds like most people in this community. He'll be a good fit.
---
Just let the saver see the killers aura for 5 seconds after the unhook. That way, because in the PTB the save has to be safe, if you can see the killer bolting it back to the hook you can try to take the aggro for the unhooked teammate to prevent the tunnel and unsafe unhook.
---
Your right. Before we do this we should get the problem of DCs solved
---
Fair enough.
---
You may have won the battle but I will find you again in the trial.
---
What money do you get from this exactly?
---
Yea that seems like a pretty good idea.
---
95% of mine are salty messages. 5% are GG but I may be being generous... probably more like 2%.
---
i'm on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/kelseyelleart)! thank you so much for the kind words 🤗💜
---
Yayy! 
---
Now give us the other 2 plzthankyou
---
Didn't have to look to hard to find the fairy. What a surprise.
---
i'm glad you like it! :D
---
Can I be the guy who brings a cypress mori after the bloodshed to see if people dc?
---
28^4 STAB WOUNDS
---
It's not even about lag, they probably had to change the code so much we're about to witness DbD in the worst state it has ever been. It has just begun.
---
D O D G E D
---
Only one insidious.
---
Thats a really good idea! Then our first will be May  mori Monday, rolls off the tongue!
---
He wouldn't even be able to reach a hook.. Let alone CARRY a survivor to one. 😂

60 is still pretty low ping
---
If you aren't playing Billy/Nurse, 3-4 min is about the usual time a game lasts vs competent survivors.
---
Even so, he’s still not very good compared to other killers at higher ranks
---
Well... the change that made the traps mostly "useless" was that the timer of the traps stopped when survivors were in the killers terror radius. thank god that was reversed. But there's still the change in the endgame, where traps are now completely inactive and do nothing (if I remember correctly), not even when you try to leave the game with the trap on.
---
Joey himself is already Auric Cell exclusive. This one has like a 90% chance of being the same.
---
I am honored
---
The perk was lit up because OP was in the dying state, because that's when it takes effect.
---
Did you just start playing online games? Like, this year. 
---
Literally every competent developer bases their decisions on metrics, not on hunches. They make small adjustments, do small scale testing, and then see how things play out live. If they If they have to change a characters mechanics they base it on performance statistics. Finally, they consider player feedback when making those. Literally any *competent* developer would have seen the reaction to the Pig changes and shelved them until they had a better idea. 
---
Also, let’s not be prone to hysterics. How the Pig’s traps interact with the endgame collapse is not some imminent disaster. It’s not some runaway train barreling down toward DBD and the only way to save it is to neuter the Pig’s endgame counter play. Absolute worst case scenario, she’ll be an overpowered Killer for a while. But claiming that she‘s going to surpass the Nurse as some SSS God of Murder from which there is no escape is a bit overly dramatic.
---
Should be completed reworked since Deliverance is a thing...
---
I'm hoping to get inspired and do more of them!
---
Make your own reddit section ?
---
No not really. You just cant seem to give a simple suggestion. You insult then don't give any tips on how to improve. Even now you havent once helped me make a better title
---
Survivors would get thoroughly trashed with 2 killers, but it'd be really fun as a rankless mode.
---
after waiting 15-60 minutes for a fucking lobby to fill...
---
You pipping down from a bad game shouldn't matter because in the end you'll make it to the rank you belong in regardless. How do you think the survivors feel when one of their teammates dc killers aren't the only ones getting punished
---
We should just make this mori may and use them every day
---
BUNNY ASH WHEN
---
And likely attract no one and split the community if I do.
---
My suggestion is a kind of sole survivor effect where when one person dies you gain a 10 percent speed boost to all actions instead of just generators
---
If your connection and the killers connection sucks. Everything is gonna suck for everyone
---
I guess I play with my meat hell of a lot more than I thought
---
First of all, nobody wants to watch this movie buster. 
---
2nd, u sound like a dumb kid that has no clue what he's talking about and why would I like the new installment? All I seen the first time was wierd and idiotic slurrs that didn't make any type of sense along with a playstyle that at LEAST 70% of this community is against. And idk why ur bringing up liberty and Bernie into a game discussion.
---
And no, it really doesn't take skill. Ur using a killer than can down literally all 4 ppl in a few seconds if u stand at the stairs. Not only that u camped the basement, which is the easiest place to camp along with a perk that makes ppl think ur not down there. How does that take any type of skill? 
---
Listen if I got "munny" they way u do, by making videos like this, I'd tell them to keep it because making money in a half sense way like this isn't worth it. Also it's not a threat if u actually do it.
---
To be fair right now they're just doing stress tests and the whole thing is very bare bones, as they've said.
---
Like the ranking system works that way haha. If you think ranking up will make you face tougher opponenets then we play 2 different games. Its a shitshow all over the ranks currently
---
Why would we lie? What motivation do we have?
---
The sad part of ambushing in loops is that it really only gets people that you don't really need ambush to get in loops. The strong players that you want a power to aid against are the ones who will run directly away from the loop the second you crouch.
---
He is great between ranks 20 to 10. Beyond that, he struggles depending on the survivors.
---
No but on the other hand a bad killer going up against bad survivors shouldn’t rank up, but if it worked the way you want it to then bad killers who have a few good games against crap survivors would also rank up when in fact they shouldn’t be. Same as if you got a 4K but every survivor suicided. Have 10 games like that then you’ve gone up by 2 ranks.
---
You know how to prolong the game and cheese the system in order to rank up if you wanted, but if you’d rather have quick games and destroy the team and stay at the same rank then blame the devs for making it that way.
---
In my opinion their are SWF groups who would def be down just for bragging rights. I know def seen toxic survivors but in fairness we have a huge amount of people who are really good and it would be a fun challenge.
---
How about any time a stack is gained, or would have been gained if you're at the cap, nearby survivors (not you) leave no scratch marks and their aura can't be detected for, say, ~10 seconds.
---
Maniac cop would be awesome. Take about a 40gn download just to make his chin tho
---
The amount of DC's...
---
Beautiful.
---
MORI MAY IT IS
---
I am part of the lgbt community and the pure appearance of that "drag queen" scares me on a spiritual level
---
“It’s Monday night and the girls are tight”.
---
Cmon man that didn’t get a chuckle? If it takes no skill, get in a game with me and you’ll get rekt. You think it’s so easy to overcome, let’s see you DC after one minute with me.
---
The reason why I mained Amanda? I just LOOOOVE ALL THE FANARTS!
---
I'd wait for a sale
---
Honestly the occasional "friendly killer" game is a breath of fresh air.
---
It does also lead to one of DBD's deepest mysteries - are they being friendly, or do they just suck with that character?
---
I'd adjust it to be similar to BBQ: 4 seconds across all tiers, and it only works when the killer is within 40m, as opposed to BBQ which is *outside* the 40m range from the hook.
---
This. Adrenaline should grant Endurance for 15 seconds if you were injured when it procs, if you were in dying state, you get up but you're afflicted with deep wounds
---
She's not safe yet though...
---
I will Daddy Mike.
---
Didn't mean to make it an argument. My original comment was more blunt than I intended.
---
How else does one acquire the precious internet points? ;w;
---
Nurse and Freddy. The best chaser with the best tracker. GG.
---
I need to invent a time machine just so I can go back and play the Benny Hill Theme to that.
---
How do I get legacy at this point in time?
---
Trapper takes those loops and deletes them from existence. 
---
One wrong step on Haddonfield against him and they might themselves taken to one of his fabled basement parties, just in general. The only thing that can counter an Iridescent Stone (or most add-ons, Iridescents are just the best) Trapper on that map is extreme vigilance and teamwork. Otherwise, you will not make it out if he knows what he's doing.
---
Creating a twitter account named: You can pet your horse in Dead by Daylight.
---
You better fucking share
---
I mean it's a metal knife glove, idk hes the one putting it on the wrong hand
---
I was memeing, just following the Rancor in T1 the whole game and then moring them as soon as the 5th gen popped
---
&gt;if this is intended I will be very disappointed to the point of not wanting to play Killer anymore.
---
If that's what the make or break point is for you I think you might have unrelated game problems..
---
Nothing feels better than juicing a survivor as Myers and then leaving them to 1HKO their friend.
---
That or purposefully losing a chase so you can get your Speedy Gonzalez stacks. Hnnng.
---
That is way too powerful. After saving someone (or taking s hit) you get the same perk as Deja Vu and 2x Self care combined. That would encourage so much body blocking and is easily abused. 
---
You need to think about balance. 
---
Seeing the killler’s aura for 4 seconds like BBQ is a good addition as it would mirror BBQ. 
---
Personally, I think the BBQ and WGLF bloodpoints bonus should be part of the game without perks. The aura reading should be the perks.
---
Shitty player =/= Legion in game. Because of crybabies like you he's gutted.
---
*laughs in Nurse*
---
Sheesh. No kidding. Barbecue is basically useless and auras are so faint. To add to that, the interior of the main building is about as bright as the Game's lower level.
---
STBFL might as well be meta for all m1 killers. I don't know why it's not considered more meta than it is.
---
No its because of the literal bug abuse and shit, that he deserves a nerf. Literally nearly no counterplay and moonwalking shitheads with franks everywhere. His design was shit in the beginking and its good that they finally do smth better.
---
Camping 5 feet away from a hooked player and hitting them the instant they are unhooked just to rehook them and stand there again = skill
---
But yeah it’s me. Gtfo-&gt;
---
ENJOY YOUR NERF.
---
Why do you need to hit them on the hook?
---
Since when stripping away everything is doing better. Cooldown addons Legion was good after the original nerf, but now they are nerfed too. How fucking balanced is that?
---
Or maybe being menacing killer is what I enjoy doing? I enjoy catching a looper hooking them slapping em onces to show who's the boss in the realm before I march off for my next victim.
---
If BM is what we are concerned about something needs to be done about spam tbagging right?
---
It’s really good for me in endgame. When the gates are open most smacks allow survivors to leave, but when they get cocky and think they’ll make it yet you have STBFL, o h b o y
---
PS4: if hit with a pallet by a survivor and another survivor crouches right behind you, you can get stuck. It wont prompt you to break the pallet or let you move backwards. Had happen twice. One time until I disconnected because I had no options.
---
Ok so I am pretty new at the game. Dont have any characters ever to hit lvl 50 and am rank 15 killer rank 14 survivor. 
---
How do I know when to break away the chase. Is there an unwritten rule of how much time is acceptable to waste? I do fairly good in my matches but that's most likely do to my low rank so I would like to be prepared for better players. 
---
Any advice is appreciated.
---
No, it would be heavily abused. Any time you body block, you can 2x self care? There is no need to test it as that would be obviously broken.
---
Normal people who don't identify as a non cisgender-non bionic-polymorphic toaster.
---
LITERALLY ANYONE CAN CAMP. What does Legion have to do with this??
---
Dank souls?! HAHAHAHAHA
---
Use them on streamers exclusively
---
Yvie Oddly, your improv performance was electrifying. You're safe.
---
Oh my god, the level of cancer would increase exponentially with survivors verbally abusing the killer lol.
---
"Fuck Legion. He deserves the Nerf" mhmmmm sure buddy. You could've just easily fucking said "3 man game, 5 gens. Thanks BHVR, really cool" but nooooo, crybaby survivor main has to blame it on the killer. Fuck Legion, amirite? It's not like the killer doesnt have to do anything with 3 man-5 gen bullshit, we have to point out the Legion part.
---
Brink more like, would fit in perfectly there
---
Forgot:
---
Allows teammates to see each other’s perks
---
Ignores blindness in Lockers. 
---
Bypasses knockdown
---
Notifies all teammates of killer perks
---
Provides status bar of all generators being worked on to teammates. 
---
Provides status of dying survivor recovery to all teammates
---
Provides status of wiggle bar to teammates. 
---
Provides status of gates opening to all teammates
---
...And people think that the No-Perk de-pip squads actually had no perks. All of those total to a full loadout. 
---
(Yes, most SFW are not that coordinated, so just consider them getting Tier 1 of the above perks and not Tier 3)
---
And you missed out on his biggest strength, the endgame. If you stack up remember me (which likely means you got the obsession out the game so there’s at most 3 left) and get everybody asleep there is no way they are opening the doors. Again, he’s not the best in the game and is almost certainly the worst, but if you run the right build you can still have a decent game.
---
4 BBQ, 400% more BP
---
When literally every Legion player I encounters does this and then acts like you on Reddit, yeah my salty ass is GONNA MAKE A SALT POST AND WHINE ABOUT IT AND BE HAPPY ABOUT THE SHITTY KILLER BEING NERFED. Good bye.
---
EVERY TRAPPER PLAYER I MEET FACECAMPS ME BUT YOU DONT SEE ME COMPLAINING
---
That’s fine. I’ve played over 100 games as every killer. I know 100 because I rate my first 100 games as my win rate as them. The amount goes over since I don’t skip quests and I’ve had a lot of plague quests back to back. I didn’t waste my bp on her since I don’t have fun playing her, I was prestiging Meyers at the time whose one of my favorites. The only character I’ve done as well as the plague as is hillbilly but my win rate on him is way down because he was my first killer so my first 30 games on him were absolute trash.
---
There are a lot of toxic scumbag killers out there.  Got to punish them by looping as hard as you can, as long as you can.  Sucks but it is what it is.  There isn't much they can do to combat insidious campers aside from what they've already done by punishing their bloodpoint gain and any chance they have at ranking up.
---
And I thought they were bad before, yeeeesh
---
Yeah, I discussed that. Chances are you’ve already checked a box or two and will have that trap off with a minute to spare. In the worst case scenario — and, just so we’re clear, that’s where you are already trapped and injured and you decided to try to find the hatch instead of boxes but the Pig found it first (which when I actually see it writing makes it sound like this is the result of very poor decisions) — you still have a chance to get the trap off at the first or second box (or third if you push it) which should still give you plenty of time to get the door and open it. As with any Killer, trap mechanics or no if the Pig finds you at any point before the doors open then game over. 
---
At some point, every Killer will create a window where survivors have no chance of actually escaping. The Pig’s window is just somewhat larger than everyone else’s. The ability to create that window is the fundamental basis of her power.
---
Could you upload the Killer 16 folder to YouTube? Thanks!
---
Definitely not Myers 😂😂😂
---
When will this be available
---
I know, it was mainly to demonstrate that if the survivors play optimally they have the upper hand.
---
I think the ideal situation is that *everyone* has fun, but with the nature of multiplayer games and matchmaking that doesn't happen too often.
---
A general rule of "don't be a dick" goes a long way.
---
Please
---
I wouldn't go as far as to say meta but I'm really starting to like Beast of Prey on Freddy.  I combine it with monitor and it really seems to mess with a lot of survivors at T Walls and taller loops.
---
The game also has the same “favor the attacker” mechanic Overwatch uses. Overwatch just has better servers.
---
PGTF is great, but p e r s o n a l l y I think bloodhound is better except for on Spirit
---
Not only that, but it doesn’t help the killer. 
---
How does “Hey, the killer is following me”,  “The killer has Franklins”, or “I am about to go down by the shack” help our the killer?
---
Even if there was talk that would help out the killer, SWF would STILL bypass it via Discord because it exists on their computers and would cut out the killer completely.
---
No
---
I'm happy to hear suggestions for another perk instead
---
I play on PC. And you can still mind game a good Nurse. I consider myself a good Nurse and I get outplayed every now and then
---
They also have significantly better developers.
---
His two main problems are auto aim targeting awake survivors instead of sleeping survivors and he has no defensive potential whatsoever, because he has to wait 7 seconds to hit someone
---
Man, I love me some dark turns in cartoons nowadays.
---
I’ve always envisioned him using the voodoo magic to take over the survivor,  the carry animation is now that survivor carrying the chucky doll and the wiggle is you struggling to regain control of your body. 
---
If you wiggle free you throw the doll down for his stun, if your hooked you jump up on it yourself while he goes back into the doll. 
---
I’m guessing he would have sort of passive style powers.  He is an M1 killer but can run under pallets, as a trade off his window vaulting animation is slower than other killers.  Or maybe to run under pallets or do a dash type move would be a activated ability with a cooldown.  Iono.
---
Oh no, I’ll down them and hook them a lot just not kill them... unless they keep running and don’t realize I’m friendly. Usually my “puppy” will point to them too and t-bag when they get downed, sometimes point to a hook because they want them dead or the points. Need to keep my puppy happy.
---
Why Dead Hard? Some of those perks aren’t that bad.
---
This is an average game on PS4. Virtually no reason to play without a full KYF lobby now.
---
At least they aren’t lying. SWF is “EZ” mode.
---
every killer i play against doesnt farm in 3v1s.  I'm not complaining about it much at all
---
Can’t blame behavior for that though, Blizzard is a monolith compared to them. At least Behaviors art team are doing an incredible job.
---
&gt;!I get 3/4 of these. Not sure about the upper right. !&lt;
---
Disassociate + Discordance = you’ve functionally removed a survivor from the game.
---
They have to either stand around doing nothing, reveal their location, or give you Sanic mode.
---
