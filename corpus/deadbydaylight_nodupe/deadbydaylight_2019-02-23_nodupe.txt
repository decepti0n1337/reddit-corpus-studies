Nah fam, this is the sub you get around the end of the year that lets you guys watch youtube on the smartboard and eat snacks in class.

Huntress, Nurse, Myers, Piggy and Spirit. I didn't start playing a lot of killer until last season so my peak was 5

DS doesn't reward failure. i see what u mean by it, but its a perk that allows you to have a second attempt just like deliverance, adrenaline, borrowed time, etc
---
Is this ironic or?
---
Feeding into the toxicity doesn't help.
---
its not a free get out of jail card tho. at least, its not free since its easily countered and you might not even hit the skill check
---
So many good possible quotes.
---
"Stream snipin's a good job mate!"
---
"Dad I'm a... I'm not a crutch perk killer Dad, I'm at Rank 1! What's the difference be, one's an achievement, the other's just salt bait!"
---
"I'll be honest with ya. SWF's do NOT care for it."
---
"Feelings? Look mate, you know who has alot of feelings? People who use crutch perks then complain when others use the same perks they do."
---
"Freddy Main's have standards.
---
Don't play for the end game.
---
Avoid block addons.
---
And make sure to sleep everyone you see."
---
Noed?
---
If the killer doesn’t message and ask to farm, killer is mean boy
---
Oh... yeah... (thinking of Rocket Raccoon)
---
They very recently adjusted it in a way that could be described as a buff, at least for the lower levels. They explicitly told us that the perk is in a good spot from their perspective, and that they don't see the false equivalency that we do. I don't mean that it's not worth it for anyone to debate it, I just meant that it's not something I'm interested in.
---
" you can attempt to make sure the individual fails the skill check, or you can drible them if possible. you can also stand in front of a wall. "
---
i dont really like the new DS changes mainly because u can only use it for such a small amount of time. im not really a fan of perks u can only use once, but thats just me
---
You are bad, uninstall.
---
I meant moreso that it still makes sense in original context if you make DS mean "da suit"
---
I dont play survivor. I just understand that If i dont want to get DSed then I should bot tunnel people from now on.  I dont get why you are freaking out so hard here. Just dont tunnel ;)
---
"Y-Y-YY-Y-Y-OUU--UU-R'REA SSKLSKKUR"
---
shut up moron
---
Except tunneling wasn't the only issue. DS had next to no counter play other than to actively make the process of hooking slower. Even if you dribble you're still giving the survivor more time to escape or their team to bail them out.
---
"But Electioneering! Enduring counters it!" No. Enduring just makes the stun slightly more tolerable, it doesn't prevent the survivor from getting free.
---
Thank you! We actually have a group with all of the legions. I’ll post it later!
---
So does that mean that bloodwarden / remember me user are bad ?
---
What a scoop.
---
I wouldn't worry. I got called camper and tunneler last night as Billy despite running around the entire map and same thing happened. I saw a "sneaky" Nea go for the basement while chasing Dwight, of course I am going to break it off and have 2 in basement vs none.
---
Don't forget about being the Dwight Stuff.
---
If anything is going to die entirely from this change, it's dying light, because this completely nerfs dying light into the ground. 
---
If you hear the heartbeat, then you're in range. ^^(clap clap)
---
Also if a killer wants to tunnel you and he's really set on killing you, then it doesn't matter what perk you or he has. He will tunnel you in till the end of the game. Yes it discourages it but at the end of the day it will probably make killers want to tunnel even more. 
---
It’s a raptor claw
---
Please don't associate this one as one of ours.
---
Huh. Maybe he could have a tracking power of some kind? Or something that allows him to take Survivors by surprise? I haven't watched the movie though. :s
---
&gt; He also cut his own face off or something 
---
I didn't know that! That's just messed up. 
---
Like, in addition to how messed up and gross his backstory already was. :p
---
I mean, all three of the perks you mentioned are perks that are rewards for good play. You save someone, you can now save yourself. You finish the gens, you get healed and can sprint. You save someone, your efforts won't be in vain if the killer is a tunneling, camping fucktard.
---
DS punished good play on the killer's part and rewarded failure on the survivor's part, I just don't see any other way of putting it.
---
The new DS is a lot more like deliverance, adrenaline, and borrowed time. It means that someone came and saved you, for one, and it punishes bad play on the killer's part (IE tunneling)
---
Consider me a pessimist, but I think the real shitstorm is on the horizon. My prediction is that after the DS changes take place, there’s going to be a movement started where DCs begin to skyrocket as a form of protest whenever the killer uses overpowered add-ons or a mori. Animosity will be higher than ever and even more bugs will come up (you know obsession changing is bound to break something). Get ready!
---
Screen capping cause I'm pretty sure you're right.
---
Again, tunneling is not required to get DSed. And so, again, "just don't tunnel" isn't valid.
---
FUCKIN CLAUDETTES
---
No.
---
If you need to use DS, you aren't a good Survivor.
---
Drop it, and you'll see your skills improve overnight.
---
You evil bastard ;-;
---
Why not change the time it takes to do gens if it is such a problem survivors are doing what they are meant to do. 
---
Try partnering them with quick and quiet as long as you can break line of sight you can confuse the killer pretty easily 
---
I got the picture from google, then i found a site to put the red eye onto the image.
---
I'm LOVING the salty ass butthurt survivors in every post today. Keep on crying, it will surely help haha
---
That's because, in the past, Survivors were *ridiculously* OP.
---
Oh. Ohhhhhh. Lol
---
I mean isn't dribbling pretty short range? If the hook isn't fairly close it won't really work? 
---
And what do you mean you can make sure they fail their skill check? Could you clarify on that? 
---
In terms of one time use, I feel that when the perk is effectively a portable pallet, it should be a one time use.
---
Oh I also wanted to add, 60 seconds really isn't that short of time. A killer is better off either eating the DS and continuing the chase, or finding a different target. 
---
Hanging around for 60 seconds until you pick someone up would just mean gens are getting done super fast. 
---
It is explained in the tutorial yes.
---
Carelessly?
---
You can chase a survivor off but the pickup is so long that they can easily get back and do it in time. Plus it eats into the limited time you have as killer.
---
The timing isnt hard at all. Its good that it takes some skill and people cant just run up, drop the pallet and run off. God forbid people have to use careful timing to pull off a big save.
---
Ok so tunnel as much as you want then. Just dont go after the person being unhooked and you will be fine.
---
Regardless of whether or not it's camping, if you want to do it, do it. Don't listen to arbitrary unwritten rules set by Survivors.
---
I have played a match with a FengMing who did nothing but stood on the rock. Even when other survivors are on the hook, she is just finding her way to get on the rock. I am so grateful that Michael finally killed her because she deserves to be killed
---
The odds of 2 people going down to Rancor are slim.
---
The odds of 3 people are not worth even mentioning.
---
Please stab me
---
I'm normally a survivor main, but the few times I've played killer I get to about rank 8. I've never had a huge problem with DS, yes it's annoying but no huge deal overall. One survivor was so bad though, I'm not proud of what I did. She led me around the entire match while her team gen rushed. When I finally did bring her down, I knew she had ds because I don't use obsession perks. All of the hooks nearby had been sabotaged.  There was no way to win, I hated this laurie with so much passion that I waited for her to almost crawl out while her friends were teabagging me. Then I Dced.  I don't play killer at all now lol but some people are just despicable with it
---
I'm not so merciful. There's actually something of an advantage to letting two or more of them start the trial together, besides...
---
1. Juggling only works on the obsession and only if there's a nearby hook AND if you don't get bodyblocked or flashlighted by another Survivor.
---
2. HOW IS BEING HIT BY DS COUNTERING DS?!
---
Nea and Meg by far the most annoying and toxic players use them. 
---
I encountered my fair share of disgusting Neas and Megs while playing both survivor and killer. I utterly hate them.
---
Two most played games at the moment. 
---
I feel like I should know the scene you're referencing but I can't remember which one.
---
He probably never saw more than the one that looped him for the entire game :(
---
Beat my first 4 man swf as myers
---
Because M1/gen jockey gameplay is considered to be the dullest part of the game, nobody wants an increase in gen repair times. The fear of NOED is supposed to give survivors something to occupy themselves with and slow matches down, and also not be mandatory. 
---
The random period placement is bothering me way more than it should.
---
Agreed.
---
Claudette, Nea, and Meg are unequivocally the three worst. 
---
OHHHH-KAY. I was a bit confused, I thought you were counting Toxic Survivors you'd encountered and tallying them up.
---
Sorry for the 4head moment. :P
---
I should have made the title "when you see fingees"
---
I like the looks of the changes. Been using my up the ante slippery meat build and unhooking myself a lot
---
Nuhuh
---
No that is what I meant and I have been tallying them  and now I'm confusing myself  ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ 
---
The new DS is additionally useless if the killer just, you know, doesn't tunnel. Survivors shouldn't get to have their cake (old DS) and eat it too (a perk to discourage tunneling). This change keeps the spirit of what DS is supposed to do (give survivors a second chance) without just handing out free escapes left and right whenever the survivor chooses to use it. Now the power is back in the killer's hands, exactly where it should be.
---
Dribbling is extremely short range.  And making them miss the skill check is probably referring to waiting until skill check prompt is close to happening and suddenly jerking your screen violently while hitting something.  Works sometimes I try that myself every obsession down.
---
This is the only correct ship aside from Nurse and Wraith.
---
This should have been part of valentine's day as well.
---
Thicc
---
No you misunderstood, a totem counter is a nerf to hex perks and a buff to survivors in the wrong place.
---
If survivors are aware of the status of totems and the rate they are going they can figure out if someone is working on totems or generators, they know whether or not to keep searching or not. A SWF can abuse this even more. 
---
If you're struggling against NOED at your rank then be the change you want, grab the perk for finding totems and make sure it doesn't appear. 
---
You make it sound like there is no one is getting chased, no one will prioritize working gens, etc etc. Gen progression &gt; looking for totems. Gen progression is the key for survival. Cleaning totems is a bet not worth taking, why waste so much time when the killer prob will not run noed anyway? Seems to me prioritazing over the solo objective as survivor its never the best option.
---
Well then you just do this meme again, but put the entity blocker in place of the fence.
---
Nah, they just use a breathing machine and they type like they talk!
---
Yea man i really like it, This sounds really good so far, But let's say if they are working on lets say a Hex: Ruin totem that is trapped, When the trap is activated does it stop them from working on it or do they just keep working on it?
---
Clown gameplay looks dope on the Switch.
---
Honestly if we're talking perks yeah the listed from the other comments probably hit the nail on the head. 
---
If we're talking annoying/toxic behaviour Fengs with the neon hair seem to be 10 times more likely to be dicks in game and after match chat lol, through I'm sure I have confirmation bias on that.
---
Im so sorry. Like I feel awful and please forgive me
---
Thx
---
Bloody Jeffs, Bloody Adams, and Bloody Kates are usually the most obnoxious Survivors I meet.
---
Funnily enough I only run into toxic Claudettes as a Survivor.
---
I still hate them tho (they usually farm and sandbag me).
---
Freddy.
---
Survivor mains... gotta love em lol
---
Yeah, tbh this post is kinda dumb now that i think about it
---
:.)
---
i can see how the other perks reward good plays more, but DS does require hitting a pretty difficult skill check - which gets increasingly difficult if the killer tries to counter it
---
Yeah fair enough, having it show up as soon as the gens are done with an exposed effect would be good. I agree with that, otherwise I still think it is fine how it is, it’s purely an end game perk so cleanse those totems.
---
It isn’t for everyone but my play style when playing either SWF or Solo is too get the totems done. I’ll run small game in a SWF to make it easier because we coordinate so generally the gens get done faster so I need to cleanse those totems quicker, otherwise it isn’t hard finding totems, even after the totem spawn rework, they aren’t hard to find, Mount Ormond is my only challenge but that’s only because I haven’t played that map much. 
---
Just my opinion though. Hope you all enjoying the fog 
---
That's hilarious. 10/10.
---
like spinning around rapidly, hitting the air, etc
---
Ah thanks for the clarification! I don't use DS myself so  I wasn't sure. 
---
That doesn't sound like a very reliable counter though? Again haven't tried it so maybe I'm wrong.
---
Because decisive has an object in the map that can make the whole perk useless right? Oh wait
---
Yeah same. He also told me to get good and I replied I’ll take it into consideration and he said “what?”
---
well, yeah. ive had a game where i was lvl 7 with Pig, had 2 lvl 1 perks, and the entire team was SWF. two of them had flashlights, 1 had insta heal, and the last one sabotaged as many hooks as possible. they all had DS and adrenaline as well, so u could imagine it was pretty shit. did kill 3 out of 4 tho, even without noed
---
Yeah it seems clown does get a bad rep. I’ve been tryna change that since I got clown recently. I purposely make an effort not to tunnel when I can. Unless the survivor is using DS. Then I don’t have a problem tunneling them most of the time 
---
I turned off the ability to receive messages from anyone other than friends. 
---
With Xbox, you can go to Settings - Account - Privacy &amp; online safety - Xbox Live privacy- View details &amp; customize - Communication &amp; multiplayer - Others can communicate with voice, text, or invites and then change it to friends only.

[removed]
---
I've been sandbagged by so many Nea's!
---
36?!, Rookie numbers. xD
---
Just pick at random, you’ll want to 40 each of them eventually, just start hitting that grind brother 
---
Yeah. Some of them you gotta watch. It is rare to see them use the body blocking techniques effectively though. Most just use their ability to tunnel or walk fast across the map. Using his invisibility offensively during a chase can be very effective
---
It's okay, I wasn't even thinking lol I was just so happy to be off work. XD that was great though you really got me! Early April fools
---
Sick flashlight
---
Hell even without BT, if you are tunneled but still manage to reach a pallet loop, there’s a good chance your perk won’t be used. I agree with the concept of the change, but the running 60 sec window part just doesn’t make much sense to me. A tunneling counter that might not even activate in circumstances where you are tunneled? Not much point in taking it if it’s only going to really work when you are instantly downed.
---
She’s adorable. I’d love to see some of the others if you’ve done them!
---
Nope! Evil laugh
---
Yup, also gotta love the killer mains who think killers can't be toxic, and survivors using perks that aren't useless like left behind are "toxic" Lmao. 
---
Alternate tierlist:
---
* Sickening, but in this case that's technically a good thing: Hag, Clown
---
* Violent and visceral, survivors actually move in interesting ways: Huntress, Legion, Pig
---
* Pretty much a sex/power thing with how it's portrayed: Myers, Nurse, Doctor
---
* Playing with your food: Freddy
---
* Just kind of kicking them when they're down: Bubba, Trapper, Billy, Wraith, Spirit
---
I honestly can’t tell
---
I'm making it sound like people will play optimally. Of course, that's not going to happen. Someone's going to be focused on just doing gens and ignore everything else, even saves. Someone's going to be found on purpose, teabag the Killer at every pallet, then DC when mind gamed and downed. And someone's going to be hiding in the corner, not doing anything.
---
But that's kind of my point. Survivors have no one but themselves to blame for NOED activating. If they didn't play like potatoes they wouldn't fall into such a simple and easily avoidable trap.
---
Because killers are brain dead morons that go for whatever is in front of them instead of trying to eliminate people as fast as possible to increase their chances of winning, right?
---
Honestly toxic players will be obnoxious no matter who they play it just annoys me that I only kill nea meg and Claudette every game. I've never even played aganist an Adam,Jeff or Laurie
---
60 seconds isn't a short time in DBD terms. People complained that self caring with sloppy is a long time but that's less time than DS has.
---
too late hes already in PubG
---
There is no bill on console
---
How about they fix the game play first?
---
Online multiplayer games will NEVER be balanced as there are simply too many players that don't possess the skills or reflexes to adapt to the various gameplay mechanics. They are only good at complaining. It happens with COD, Battlefield, Fortnite etc... These players ruin the experience for the rest of us. 
---
Your doing the Entity's work, keep it up!
---
Unless you’re using enduring... then the chase can easily be extended even longer which wastes precious time going to find other survivors. Plus, there is absolutely NOTHING worse than not only getting hit by the obsession’s d strike but also by a random struggle d strike by someone else in the same game. You can imagine how much time is wasted at that point. Also, trying to dribble and make a survivor miss? If u miss a d strike skill check then you’re probably not that good at the game to begin with and dribbling wastes time and u gotta do that all three times you need to hook them, not to mention when their swf body blocks the hook
---
I play without perks and steal items in the chests from the fog...... I'm not better than this.
---
When i was a new player i always thought freddy was probably the best killer because it seemed like he could hit me from miles away lol
---
Oh Hell Yeah.
---
So basically, make the game suck more to keep people playing. Real solid logic pal!
---
A dev challenge, no real rewards just a challenge
---
I think there's a difference between noob-friendly, and unintentionally misleading, though. I also thought the killer could see my aura. At no point in dark souls did I think an enemy was friendly when it wasn't
---
This
---
Games have done multiple crossovers. See Witcher 3; Geralt's in Soul Calibur and Monster Hunter.
---
Lol 1000 IQ play
---
They can't since the skill check now starts at the beginning of the pickup animation. 
---
Whys that too late? Dbd could do it as well if they wanted it. 
---
I love pop goes the weasel one of my favorite perks 
---
And yet it can be completely prevented.
---
60 seconds is more than rnough to prevent tunneling. I'd say it should perhaos be even shorter.
---
Glad they avoided 2 minutes. That would be overkill.
---
Adding up both survivor and killer encounters:
---
22 Neas
---
20 Claudettes 
---
19 megs 
---
15 Quentins
---
15 davids
---
13 Laures
---
12 Ace's (mostly DCing when I pick them up)
---
10 
---
...You basically said what I said but worded it differently lol 
---
It’s not triggering me? I don’t use DS 😂😂😂 unlike you I can see where it’s making people mad, you’re to ignorant to see anyone else’s opinions 
---
If you don't mind my asking, Where is the character artwork from? Did you create it?
---
Because it’s garbage legion. Not a real killer. 
---
Rank 10 are easy games, rank 1 games are much more difficult
---
If all 4 people put in the eFFort then you'll most likely prevent it. If not it should at most lead to 1 person being hit with it as everyone else can then find the Totem and potentially make a save.
---
Super general request, what do you mean by "fix the game play"?
---
Well that's because at some point you know that you're going to be very suspicious about everything since the game can be tricky. But yeah I guess it can be really misleading instead of being vague.
---
????? What sucks about grinding????? A lot of people enjoy it you know, not everyone thinks it's dull and worthless. Why do you think people play OSRS for instance?
---
fair enough.
---
Ok dude, I bet your god tier and get 4 kills every game. You obviously dont actually play killer.
---
*L M A O*
---
If that was their first hook and they got unhooked before struggling, the perk will become active again next time they get unhooked.
---
Also bare in mind that the killer will no longer know that the survivor is running DS until they get hit by it.
---
wasnt necessarily replying to you but i didnt think the /s was necessary 
---
Even if it happens there is almost everytime a hook nearby so that you cannot use it when you arent the obsession.
---
Beautiful
---
its easy to bait, but you can only really bait in a dead zone where the killer can get close enough to swing without lunging. Otherwise it is great because you can dodge chainsaws, hatchets, bear traps, swings, get to pallets/windows, etc.
---
What do I know honestly, I don't really play survivor. Dead Hard just seems like the best from my killer point of view.
---
Noed is not equivalent to decisive 
---
Great post OP! Thank you for breaking down the different components of the perk from a survivor’s point of view. 
---
People will argue about NOED being countered by cleansing full totems, and you brought up some great counter points. I even had a game myself where I cleansed 4 totems on my own, and still got hit with NOED. 
---
The biggest issue with NOED is that it is simply unfun to play against. Some of my favorite moments playing dbd involve trying to rescue someone off of hook after the exit gates are open. Teammates take turns body blocking, and doing what they can so everyone can escape. With NOED you can risk looking for the totem and risk getting one shot or just leave.
---
I’ve known people that have completely stopped playing this game because of NOED. I see it used in about 75% of games in purple ranks where some killers wouldn’t be able to get a single kill without it. 
---
I really like Save the Best for Last and strongly recommend it for M1 killers (especially those who have a power that can affect the obsession while the killer ignores them, like Doctor and Freddy). 
---
This is the best thing i've ever seen.
---
I've been playing since June of last year
---
I played 10 killer games to every 1 survivor game all the time a few months back for the bp grind. I watched killer mains on twitch (ZubatLEL; killer main who played killer during true infinites and no exhaustion nerf era and since very beginning of game) to learn tips and tricks and ask questions.
---
I did the whole "get to rank 1 as nurse" phase, I experimented with every killer that has unique strategies (pre-revving chainsaw for shack window as billy, tricking survivors who try to bait chainsaw, huntress, hag right when she got her buff)
---
I was a Hag/ nurse/ huntress/ wraith main for long times.
---
Then a few months back when the healing and vault nerf hit for survivors I started finding survivor games more fun (and so did a lot of streamers) since infinites were somewhat eliminated, and rounds put you with plenty of bad players (and bad killers) you could "carry" against. Lots of killers were boosted from the hallowed blight event because of the simultaneous meta change happening for the survivor nerf and the fact that gens were delayed because of event objectives.
---
Since then ranking put "bad" killers at high ranks- killer queues were abysmal for ages because NO ONE wanted to play survivor. Upwards of 30 minutes for a queue for a round. Killer mains were swapping to survivor and had to learn the new survivor meta around the longer heals. (ie; don't heal, rush gens for adrenaline, use tiles and pallets even more wisely than before)
---
Each subsequent map generation tweak made it rougher and rougher for survivors, putting pallets roughly "1 stun" distance away, getting rid of a lot of "nasty" setups they could abuse on certain tiles. As killer if you got survivors to waste certain pallets you created "guaranteed hit" zones
---
Killer kept getting easier and easier every patch, and the fun of "putting cheeky survivors" in their place got eliminated when it felt most matches had bad survivors and ways to punish good survivors with the increase of deadzones and un-abusable tiles for them.
---
Which is fine in terms of game balance, but I personally don't find killer fun. I've not had a "rough match" in ages in DBD that made me mad. I barely have to put any thought into it anymore. I play survivor and watch bad killers make constant simple mistakes (running T+L walls incorrectly, committing to wrong survivors too long, FACECAMPING as "revenge", tunnelling survivors who are injured without leading chase around map to pressure gens, not guarding 3 or 4 gens in close proximity and kicking gens in corners of maps, kicking gens during chases, not denying windows or running shack correctly, bloodlusting nearly every hit)
---
Get the fuck out of here. Just cause I'm not a dogshit killer who thinks DS is a problem doesn't mean I'm not a killer main. Ask any actually good killer main what they think of DS and they will all say the same thing.
---
"It has plenty of counters, just slug them, just eat it most survivors are bad anyway, non-obsession DS is a problem, DS alone is less of a game changer than unbreakable/ deliverance)"
---
It is a chase extender that primarily works against bad killers.
---
I don’t think we are going to see eye to eye on this. I just believe the perk serves its purpose MUCH better if it’s a significantly shorter clock, I’m talking cutting it in half at least, but stops on chase or downed. That would make it a legitimate counter as how long you manage to run no longer matters...which it shouldnt
---
the idea of "git gud" has its origins as far back as the first competitive games mankind has played, and will survive long after Dark Souls is forgotten. It isn't a meme, it is a way of life.
---
In the words of Isai, "Don't get hit".
---
Like the have others said, the moment you get picked up by the killer, adrenaline will be on stand by until you get pulled off.
---
So if someone _just_ gets downed by the killer and it's not their death hook, wait until they enter the pickup animation to pop the last generator. Otherwise their adrenaline probably won't be utilized to its fullest potential.
---
That sounds like a fair compromise. Either way it honestly wouldn't affect me much since I often use MYC or DH anyway.
---
i had 4 stacks on wglf. killer didn't have bbq, which is odd for rank 1. game wasn't too well, clown was a camper and tunneler. i got 170k bps nonetheless. ps: i'm a she. 
---
Finally a change where the only people who are upset on either side are the most cancerous, and you want to change it back.
---
Fuuuuuuck off.
---
idk either clown was too thirsty 
---
It's even worse when you're playing with a friend and you tell them your hooked and they ignore you until the last possible second
---
Could be a console exclusive character considering we can’t get over beck which is sad
---
who doesn't 
---
Hexes are a stupid, bad idea because the only perks strong enough to be worth the risk of maybe getting broken is Ruin and maybe Devour.
---
I agree Thrill shouldn't be a hex, AT LEAST.
---
Never mind me, I'm just a lore nerd. :D

This is something I've suspected for a while but I have like 0 proof and always just thought I was making stuff up. Sometimes I even hear survivor screams even with killers who dont have any ability to induce that like gas or shock.

New work event

This sounds like a fantastic new game mode. Pitch it to BHVR!

Adrenaline is nearly the inverse to Rancor. Borrowed Time only activating if you are in the terror radius unless playing against nurse or hillbilly will equate to a second chance if the killer is camping. D-strike yes will have a rework but in the current game does still exist in its current state. Delieverance is a second chance in the most literal way if its perquisites are done and every exhaustion perk are focused on in the case of giving the survivor a second chance by possibly preventing a hit and allowing for extra space to allow for more looping. 
---
There is also unbreakable, a second chance perk that if the killer is not quick with hooking is allowed to activate. 
---
My problem with him saying that Rancor should be removed or changed is not with him wanting Rancor to be removed. But rather with him claiming that no second chance perks exist for survivor when several examples already exist. **Simply one existing would be proof enough to refute his claim that no second chances exist for survivor.**
---
The only other perks that could be counted as a second chance perk for killer is Spirit Fury along with Enduring and NOED. Perks that much akin to all other second chance perks with survivors require specific criteria to be met.  
---
20% &gt; 0%
---
Cause your own fucking teammates are dogshit 90% of the time.
---
I swapped to DS ever since I got constant depip/ safety pip games cause I misjudged a single juke or the killer ran a tile strange and caught me off guard or certain pallets weren't there 2 minutes into the game, then afterwards getting 1 hook death or farmed for 2 hook death.
---
Chases are FUN. I ran to the killer at the start of every match and got them chasing ME cause I didn't trust my teammates to use tile pallets correctly (i see them way too often waiting at pallets to drop them or dropping and getting hit anyway)
---
Then I get games against killers who run tiles correctly and do zoning, and I basically never get to use DS or they use the myriad of counters: holding you next to a falling point so you're stunned from DS too, enduring (it's base kit for killers who know how to play the game and don't respect pallets), juggling, just eating it on good tiles, or simply slugging and putting map pressure.
---
It's a great perk to have fun in "bad" killer matches, and a useless perk in matches with actually good killers. Thing is, actually good killers are fun and gets you tons of bloodpoints *ANYWAY*. (unless your teammates are bad and get insta-downed 1 by 1)
---
I mean yeah, but you can use it more than once. So in my opinion, it’s better than ds. The only thing different ds did was restore when you were downed, not injured. I get that you can’t stop it, but that just makes them more susceptible to your obsession perks in the end. 
---
Uses ds, calls killer baby... Lol
---
Huntress has a 45 metre Lullaby, which is likely why you can hear it at a far distance. She actually stops singing it when she gets into a chase, so it is a good indication for a chase.
---
Huntress and Freddy's lullabys are not affected by any terror radius affecting perks.
---
She doesn't sing her lullaby when she is in chase, that would be why.
---
^ this right here, so much.
---
This is the most balanced the game has ever been. That being said, good survivors still should win 90% of their games.
---
I love it
---
That's not tall grass, that's Claudette
---
There’s a difference between being “noob friendly” and adding artificial difficulty.
---
To be fair, killers have a lot of shit to bitch about, and have had even more in the past.
---
You're a better killer than me then
---
*Huntress humming intensifies* 
---
Thanks guys! I didn’t know you guys were on reddit ! 
---
Are you okay?
---
Since the healing nerf yeah the meta changes to less altruism, more gen rush cause good survivors didn't waste half a gen's progress to get a heal on themselves.
---
to counter Rancor just do not get caught. It is not a free kill because the survivor should be aware of it, and play accordingly.
---
Thankkssss! I didn’t know you guys were on reddit! 
---
LOL this same guy messaged me before. His first message was “wow so reported”. Then he sent me another 5 minutes later and said “actually never mind. “
---
Personally, I'd love to see the lockers get sealed shut after at least one gate has been opened for 2 minutes. If a survivor is inside during the sealing, the entity takes them.
---
Toxic survivors only sign this.
---
If it had a 30 second cool down I could deal with that. But it breaks my little Huntress heart when I’m halfway to my totem at the start of the match and it’s destroyed before I get there. 
---
I'm still gonna tunnel you. It still saves more time than dropping the chase and hoping to find someone else.
---
I hate farming, a ton of my games are farming killers so I have to figure out if this is a real game or a farmfest. But yeah, id farm this. 
---
Just every time someone gets outskilled and DCs right before I pick him up to hook him. It warms my heart.
---
🦀
---
Make a perk that makes it so one of the gates is actually sealed shut forever so its 50/50 if you open the right one when escaping
---
*Laughs in Leatherface*
---
I'll admit I had no idea that those text tutorials existed.
---
I was referring to the played tutorials where you actually go through the motions of what is being explained.
---
Yeah, you are right in this case. Adrenaline also made it happen. But for non basement though, it works pretty well for late game heroics. If the killer ends up targeting me instead and I go down, I’m good with dying. It’s fun for me to help someone else get out anyway. Also nothing better when a team of solos unite to rescue the last person and everyone manages to run out together!
---
*Ochido liked your comment*
---
I thought about this too. It 100% punishes you for being good in a chase or if the killer doesn’t tunnel. It’s a wasted perk slot now. I’ll never use it. 
---
Dwights, especially bald Dwights, for some reason they're always dicks in my games, either as a killer or survivor :c
---
They still are OP, even after all the nerfs. That just goes to show how fucking bad it was.
---
You're one of the few people on this sub with a working brain.
---
No 
---
I was able to stall out the exit gates for a 4k with Freddy. And just last match we beat a 3-gen lockdown cannibal after I locker juked his chainsaw in basement until he got so mad he just hit me--allowing me the teammate save.
---
That'd be really neat, just something to counter the usual "hides in a locker once the gates are open and all other survivors have left" people I run across. I'm sure there's plenty of valid reasons to hide in a locker in a shack directly near the exit gate when I'm halfway across the map, but I'm having trouble thinking of them. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Maybe balance it with a survivor perk that lets you teleport to a random locker once per game while in a case or something. But that'd be like a less groovy new DS.

---
I’m not saying the Claudette deserved it...............^^^^^^^^^but
---
Lol I feel like some people play clown to be a dick, like they purposely hit you on the hook to make themselves laugh to make the survivor salty.
---
I personally am literally insane and hear heartbeats where there are none. I only found this out when I replayed videos of me playing to realize there wasn't actually a heartbeat there.
---
You be the judge
---
My gf for some fucking reason.
---
But the borrowed time esque effect is better than the current DS. Now you can't dribble or swing through to negate it, and it *can* punish optimal killer gameplay and allow survivors unsafe unhooks. It also now fucks with how obsession mechanics work.
---
Complaining about internet lingo on an internet site?
---
...totally not trolling, btw.
---
Who do you think you're foolin', pal?
---
Agreed, I was confused over this for the longest time when I was new.
---
Gtfo
---
Sometimes people are better than me, and they do get away. But it's one use and it's gone if the chase is too long it doesn't need to end in a hook sometimes I break it off and patrol for others and go after them later ignoring them till almost last since I know I already wasted too much time. I mean Ruin is annoying and noed but I don't think it's a crutch perk because it adds more time. I'm not a master at mind games or have a degree but I just play a lot so I know what they most likely will do. I don't get 4k all the time I've def encountered surv who could keep me in a chase long enough for surv to get some good progress.
---
I think that's part of knowing when to call off a chase to focus gens or others. Chances are if they leave they may not have self care so it brings another surv out to heal them so I can track via blood and groans if I see them again. Yeah it sucks to have someone jump off your shoulder but DS isn't flawless I've def seen plenty of people miss it, but it doesn't bother me that much like it seems to most killers. Sometimes I pressure them enough they get no gens done sometimes I do a poor job and they pop 3 gens all at once but then I get most of them by then by pressuring the last gens (them being on the same side of the map helps a lot too trying to keep the gens close, via controlling which gens you allow them to pop). I mean yeah some are good at running others not so much. As a surv I enjoy wasting the killers time and being chased so my guys can get stuff done I'm fairly decent at it but sometimes they don't fall for the bate (as a killer I'm guilty of falling for the bate on good runners.).
---
I seen another thread and I agree with the guy a lot of people seem to blame it on lack of skill. I used to hate bbq and chili or some other perks (idr off the top of my head), but I learned how to deal with them and it's not so bad now really either by countering or preparing for the oncoming chase. If someone is running DS I'll try to bring them to more open areas so I can find them and they have less pallets, etc.
---
You're an idiot. An honest to God that doesn't exist idiot. Everyone's happy about this change, assuming it's done right. But they cant keep it as is. 
---
No thank you, I’m full 
---
Maybe they don't want to
---
I want a perk that allows you to curl up in a fetal position, making you smaller &amp; harder to see.
---
Or crawlspaces. Like vaults, but killers can't go through them. Urban Evade through the fuckers and they shut for a while after two uses.
---
I'm 100 hours deep and I didn't know this :x
---
I remember people kept requesting zubatlel to do certain builds on stream for donations, and whenever he got an "endgame" build he never got to use any perk and 4k'd everyone at like 4-5 gens left back to back. (Rank 1 too)
---
It was so funny. He decided to just AFK half a game and still nearly 4k'd everyone. Shit was so dumb.
---
Imagine thinking a perk which rewards failure, doesn’t have any skill and allows killers to get undeserved kills isn’t a crutch. 
---
Tea-bagging would be easy.
---
A gen gauge moving all the way to the end would be easy.
---
Pulling pallets out of killer range wouldn't be too hard, but perhaps too harsh.
---
Blocking windows would be a bit of a pain to code.
---
Standing in front of a hook would be easy.
---
Hmmm, what else do toxic people do?
---
I had been playing for a long time, and when the Pig was introduced, her Make your choice was in the first match I played.
---
Now, I knew how Myers worked, but I never realized it was called exposed.
---
So, I made a hook save, and saw exposed. I went on top of a hill and started teabagging and waving like the killer could see my aura anyways. I figured if I could be seen, I might as well be a dick about it. She crouched right under me and past me.
---
After the match I felt stupid. Lol
---
Nemises would be awesome! He is super freaking tall, so he could be seen from a mile away. I think he is even taller than the cornfield. What would his power be?
---
I like that, anything that adds unique map traversal or tactics could be fun if it isn't broken or abusable somehow.
---
Nice
---
Very nice.
---
Jake gave you his medkit and bailed? Lol, gee thanks.....I guess.
---
Nah dude, DS is the crutch perk. NOED is absolutely necessary cause survivors get together in discord and coordinate gen rushes.
---
DS users just run it because they expect to get downed during the match. LOL. Hellooooo? Just don't get downed!
---
And oh- don't like NOED? hmm.... how about... COUNTERING IT by cleansing all the totems on the map and playing PROPERLY.
---
/s
---
Lmao this is great
---
I've suggested this before but the tl;dr version is this : 
---
Autodidact now gives tokens while self-healing. To balance this, the perk now works on a 20 token system with Self-care skill checks granting 1 token and healing others giving you 4. Additionally self-care gets a reduced bonus from Autodidact, letting you just nullify the penalty at max tokens with Tier 3 of the perk.
---
I just want the perk to be a little more useable god-damn it
---
That face is perfect. 
---
“Oh... well shit...” 
---
Yes it is, both reward poor play.
---
It's just annoying to lose a survivor after winning the chase.
---
3v1s and DCs are far from 'corner cases', they're very prevalent nowadays. Every day for the past few weeks I've had at least 1 3v1 match, or have been stuck on the loadscreen. For argument's sake, let's say the graph was 100% accurate, no DC's included, no 3v1s, no swf, just 4 solo survivors vs. 1 killer. You get it.
---
How many times have you reached the exit, only for a fellow survivor to go down, so you go back and try to save them, only for both/all of you to get downed and die? How many times have you tried to save in the basement just to be downed and hooked beside the other guy? Both of these are *incredibly* common; I've been on the giving and receiving end of both plenty of times (based on my own experience, I'd say daily). These are situations that survivors put themselves in. Survivors could just leave at the end, rush gens if the killer's camping, abandon the basement dweller, and the escape rate would be higher, potentially much much higher, but they don't. It's a part of the game, it will always be a factor, and that leads me to believe anything higher than a max 50% escape rate is just too high, especially with all other outside factors included. Some more factors include which killer is played, which perks everyone has, how good the survivors/killer actually is, and what map is being played.
---
I also never said lengthening the game, nerfing survivor perks, and buffing killers increased escape rates; it quite obviously lowered them. I did say it brought it closer to balance, which I still believe it did. Anything you mentioned was either a fix for something the survivors could easily exploit (pallet vacuum, window vault angles, jungle gyms/pallet placement) or a QoL change for killers so they didn't get bullied so hard (faster pick-up time, hook spawns, exhaustion nerf). As of now survivors actually have to think about what they're going to do, where they're going to run, and how to punish bad killer plays. From my personal rank 1 experience, they know all of that pretty well. The game has definitely skewed towards killers, but so far only enough for them to have a fair crack at a 4k.
---
fr though that’s how i play trapper and it works wonders
---
BT is for other people, the new DS is for yourself. Plus, of course a situational perk wouldn't work in specific situations. A powerful perk (like new DS, BT, and Deliverance) shouldn't be able to go off without a hitch 100% of the time. They're powerful abilities that come with risks, especially the risk of not being able to use it at all. If you don't get slugged, you can't use Unbreakable. If you get tunneled off the hook or hooked first, what was the point of bringing Deliverance? If the killer chooses not to tunnel, you can't use DS. There's actual counters to DS now, it's really good.
---
Do you mean rank reset? That happens the 13th of every month. Or do you mean depipping? You don't depip between ranks 20-15
---
Whispers, Ruin, Monitor and Abuse, Spirit Fury; these are all wayyy more utility than NOED
---
meh
---
because noed is the only hex perk right? because trash killers who've done nothing all match deserve to get kills right? because these killers deserve these things for free when the they cant hit, find, or stop, survivors right? noed is a cheap perk that needs a rework
---
There is a pathway up.
---
Agreed. Trapper needs something new and brutal! 
---
\&gt; replacing spirit fury with brutal strength
---
Dude. Don't respect pallets.
---
Now I desperately wanna see Ochido play again but just to see him raging over DS and having to actually play well and sneak properly
---
This is more of a visual bug, but with the perk huntress lullaby, even if the hex totem is destroyed, you can still gain tokens for hooking survivors. I don’t believe it has any effect after it’s been destroyed even when getting additional tokens, but it’s a bug nonetheless. 
---
In addition, Nurse currently has two bugs. Sometimes when blinking instead of the hand coming up, the weapon that nurse uses will glitch out and continuously make the blink charging noise. This can sometimes make blinking difficult due to it messing with muscle memory. Another bug she has is where after blinking, sometimes pressing m1 immediately afterwards doesn’t result in you lunging and you have to press m1 multiple times in order for the game to register the input. This bug sometimes robs me of hits since I’ll have blinks where I land perfectly on the survivor but I’m unable to follow through since this bug is present. 
---
You should always be rotating your camera while repairing on a gen to prevent getting snuck up on like that.  This way you see them coming and can either position yourself to a better position to begin a chase or hide based on the situation.  This needs to be done to beat Myers, Pig and anyone that runs Tinkerer 
---
Michael has very heavy breathing that can be heard, even over gens
---
I like how it appears to be in the art style of Hollow Knight! That may not be what you were going for, but it's what it reminded me of.
---
"you rely soley on the killer being bad" It's got nothing to do with the killer being "bad", it depends on the killer actually tunneling. Just like Unbreakable requiring the killer to slug you and leave you on the floor. There's actual counterplay to DS now, and the killer can just choose not to face it if they want.
---
We’re gonna live forever, David King exclusive until rank 35 i believe. For every time you save/take a hit for a survivor you get a token 2/3/4, for a stackable bonus of 25% ,for each token, of your blood points after the game. It’s really a perk to use if you’re just trying to farm as much BP as possible. Hope it helped
---
don't use it myself so didn't know for sure, friend says it's a recent bug tho so idk
---
I'll go with Amanda. Despite freddy being quite fun he's just not competitive enough for me to recommend unless you consistently have way to much time on your hands.
---
As far as Amanda goes she has both a fun *and* effective power. Being able to mind game pallets with crouching is super fun and shuts down the loop when it lands, and her RBT force survivors to choose between a shitty and really shitty choice. 
---
If you trap a survivor and hook them, when they get off they have to choose: stay for heals or go straight for taking the trap off; go to the closest jigsaw box that you'll probably crouch to or one farther away. When someone has a trap survivors have to decide if they want to pop a gen and hurt their teammate or keep it at 99 and hope it's not regressed. The survivors will always have to be on alert to not get hit by your stealth, making them more likely to make mistakes--and can even mistake you for another survivor.
---
Her after-exit-gate-is-open pressure is insane. The survivor(s) with a RBT can't leave through the exit gates, allowing you to go after the rescuer safely, and forcing them to stick around--only being able to get out by reaching 1 of 4 of the boxes you can see (*cough* easy patrol for the kill*cough*). The amount of times I've gone from 1 kill to a 3k or 4k after the gates are open is insane by itself.
---
And if you want to be cancer Amanda can offer that as well. With a better insidious you can camp like a pro for those ultra altruistic survivors. You can also break chase and follow like the legion to guarantee a kill with her RBT with no counterplay.
---
She's a standard 115% killer and is shorter than the pallet spots with high walls such as the hay bails/walls on Coldwind Farm.
---
Make Your Choice Works super well with nurse and Surveillance is decent on all killers; Hangman's Trick counters sabo squads and is ok on trapper.
---
So it was confirmed that it's a bee based killer?
---
Myers is the #1 killer most likely to rage quit by a wide margin. 
---
Why would he talk about killer issues when he mostly plays survivor.....
---
Why? *Why* would it have to be attached to a perk?
---
If you play SWF (especially a 4-man), you can communicate *every single Totem location you run across*, as well as *which ones are cleansed and which ones are not*.
---
When you are a solo Survivor, you have zero idea what Totems have been 'found', cleansed, and where they were found/cleansed. You only have information on the ones that you find, and that's it. 
---
BHVR balances the game around SWF, *not* solo survivors, so why aren't we lifting Solo survivors up to the level of SWF? There's no inherent reason *not* to do it. And, if win rates begin to climb, buff the Hex perks in response. 
---
Then he should change the title of the video to everything wrong with half the game. 
---
There are a couple that come to my mind. 
---
Nurse with hatchets... yes!
---
A Perk that lets me See the hatch when i'm the only one alive
---
A Perk just like pebbles but you throw legos on the ground, Killers Walking over it are slowed 
---
Many more!
---
Fun fact. Dead by daylight was actually made with SWF as a planned feature however they didn't have the mode ready in time for release. 
---
What do you suggest they do? Remove SWF? Cause if you remove SWF, you're losing over half of the survivor mains such as myself. Every game is more fun with friends and dead by daylight is no exception 
---
Depipping? You mean losing the ticks? Like you need five to get to the next rank. No I mean going from rank 12 to rank 11 after a bad match. Like I lost all ticks and then went to rank 12.
---
holy fuck! 
---
Pyramid Head X Spirit, huh? Weird couple.
---
He states that the issues he mentions are HIS and what HE feels after spending 5000 hours in the game. Watch the video or don't bother commenting. 
---
Don't get why people keep talking about breakdown being good with this build, new DS is in affect during animation so the killer is unable to dribble, making breakdown have no point. Am i missing something?
---
You're usually going to want one of each type of perk: one for Chasing, one for Hooking, one for Tracking, and one for situations. Try some of each type to figure out what combinations actually work and suit your style of play. 
---
That said, here are a few personal recommendations:
---
Brutal Strength (With Enduring and Spirit Fury)
---
Save the Best for Last (With Rancor in case the Obsession you didn't hit at the start of the game thinks they're exempt)
---
Hex: Ruin (Pretty much crucial at high ranks especially, mixes well with Haunted Ground so a successful cleanse really has them regretting their decision)
---
Agitation (With Iron Grasp or by itself)
---
Bamboozle (For vault blocking and Chokepoint creation) 
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse (Particularly effective on Myers due to his minuscule terror radius during EW1 and grants a wider field of view for easier stalking) 
---
I don't? Not sure what implied I did
---
Well if you think about it, in order for the game to even be *downloadable* on the Switch, it needs a TON of optimization done. Therefore by having plans to release it on the Switch devs are essentially agreeing to optimize the game
---
Sounds like the worst ability of all time.
---
Huntress: "Why don't we go and have a chat in the basement, hun?"
---
Funny how when everyone else saw you they just DC, IRL. 
---
It's less SWF and more voice communication if we're focusing in on that. 
---
At the end of the day a 4 second get out of jail free card in the hands of any high rank player (god forbid they all have it) just wasted way too much of the killer's time in an already too fast game.  
---
Reading over D strike changes it's going to be strong, just a lot more specific which is honestly how it should have always been. 
---
Presumably, the other half of the survivors would instantly escape to keep it perfectly balanced.
---
I always wanted to run Dying Light. Now with the changes to Rancor I can.
---
Love the art style! More please? :P
---
Don't tunnel and it won't affect the killer ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
We'll be fine. Fairweather gamers are fairweather gamers. There isn't an asymmetric horror game that can compete at the moment, which I think would motivate the devs more.
---
But there's a new chapter coming. I've heard doom &amp; gloom phases since release, it is what it is.
---
I haven't seen many killers DC in the videos I watch or the 10 matches I played as survivor.
---
By 'Being bad' i mean them relying on tunneling and also 'bad' as being braindead and not realizing their are perks that fully counter them tunneling.
---
Spirit is probably best killer to use strider on. If you're asking whose perk it is, it is a Nurse perk.
---
Nurse and Spirit and that’s about it really but honestly you’d be better served with a decent pair of headphones. 
---
Adorable
---
I do have head phone I just feel the need for stridor because when it come to hearing the survivors it help me a lot 
---
Yup!
---
Folks comparing DBD to Apex really won't be missed by many of us in the first place...
---
He completely brushed the video off because it never specifically mentioned problems that killers face. That is a pretty selfish and unhealthy mindset if we're gonna be making the game fair for everyone. 
---
And I hate to break it to you, but I've been playing this game since it came out. Queue times are definitely higher than they used to be for killers - at least on PC. 
---
Each killer should have their own, personal emote which would be a flamboyant dance move.
---
I would use this in response to any teabagging or general BM
---
It’s really not
---
Cool! So the two possibilities I know of would be Candyman and this "The Bee" I've been hearing of.
---
So that is what Exposed means? Now I know.
---
I've never tried it. I watched HybridPanda play it. It doesn't look very good.
---
Not totally though. A survivor can be tunneled with the new DS, and still not get to use the perk. With those other situational perks, if those situations occur you get the benefit. Adrenaline if you are injured you get healed. Borrowed time if you save in terror radius it works (I think cloaked wraith is exception, but that’s beside the point). Deliverance you make a save before getting hooked, you get an unhook. Unbreakable if the killer slugs, you get up. With the new DS, if you are tunneled you get to use the perk, but only if it falls in the 60 sec window. Decent idea, but flawed.
---
This is super cute!
---
Or, you could just know how many totems spawn on the map and count down from how many you destroyed. Or be like the rest of us an just assume the killer has a hex perk and destroy totems along the way.
---
Looks pretty good! I like it.
---
Nothing's to say that the killer "relies" on tunneling. A killer might only tunnel once or twice a game. You're acting like a killer who tunnels does that all game. Plus, now there are perks that counter the new anti-tunnel perk. Enduring trashes a three second stun.
---
If what I've heard about that movie is true, I believe it. :P
---
It's not from a huge distance, but it's still good. About my skill level.
---
Michael is far from op, he has a few main weaknesses namely 1) very slow early game 2) non existent map pressure 3) loopable
---
The proper way to deal with Michael is to focus on breaking line of sight to prevent stalk, you want to keep him in t1 as long as possible since he's at his weakest. Realise that in t1 he is virtually a non issue, and in t2 he's a standard 115 m1 killer that you can abuse at regular loops. Even in t3, although he is slightly stronger in chases with increased lunge and fast window vaults that make some loops like shack less safe, he is still vulnerable to regular pallet looping.
---
Michael heavily relies on snowballing off a t3 since its not uncommon for 2/3 gens to pop by the time he gets his first hook, biggest mistakes survivors make is to be altruistic during t3. His t3 lasts 60 seconds by default, the same time it takes for a hooked survivor to hit struggle - just stay on a gen and wait it out instead of hook rushing and letting Michael snowball. If survivors play optimally and stay on gens Michael shouldn't ever get more than 1 cycle of t3. 
---
I can hear the "X gon give it to ya" start screen music now.
---
Huntress is like, "come on... let's go"
---
Idk if it’s just I’m unlucky or what but i always have to end up destroying totems myself. And half the time i don’t really care about em unless it’s devour soap
---
It's not even movie accurate. In the films his iconic stab is downward into the person, more toward the center chest. In the game, he stabs upward from the abdomen into the ribcage. I want to see the classic wind up and stab, not the weird uppercut stab Myers does here. 
---
This is definitely r/dadbydaylight material.
---
You go from rank 11 to rank 12 after a bad match. Not vice versa. The numbers closer to 1 are higher ranks. 
---
Wish people thought the same. Had a clown focus me like his life depended on it got a whopping 2k
---
I got called a hacker by using iridescent axe heads as the huntress, it was grand.
---
No it’s just survivors who play like 20’s who don’t know to draw killer away so that a team mate can get saved, just ignore their salty lips.
---
Lol.
---
If TOTH wasn't a totem, defending hex totems would be way too easy.  Perks like Devour Hope and Lullaby would become meta on killers with high mobility and map presence.
---
It's less about allowing people to play with their friends and moreso knowing that everyone who plays that game mode is most likely going to be using voice comms, which this game was specifically designed to not be used with it.
---
It's kinda funny being called a hacker. It just goes to show the others don't know what they are talking about, or you're juat really good.
---
The FAQ below the post is exactly what I was referring to when I said "not correct"
---
Typically ite the rank 1's and its easy getting to rank one but you think they understand how it goes by now
---
Frank gang rise up
---
Pulls in a survivor with a tendrils maybe?
---
You would think so.
---
At the very least, I would like a monster from the series to show up as a killer. Would be pretty neat, but idk how they'd do a survivor as there are so many to choose from. If anything they'd probably add someone like Shaggy and the rest as outfits
---
Where and when did they say it was going to be a bee based killer? 
---
That'd be cool. Kinda like the Stalker in Last Year The Nightmare.
---
Ooh thank you so much! That helped tremendously.
---
Some killers are stealthy, that's not a bad thing. You can also just, you know, use your vision sense to see his bright white florescent mask.
---
My rule is treat the game like Myers is the killer until you know he isnt. If you rotate your camera you can see HIM AND Wraiths coming to you. As a Myers main I can say that people who don't pay attention are the reason I succeed, denying me tier 2 as ling as possible makes it hard to do anything. Stalking takes alot of time
---
Tldr Pay attention to your surroundings, assume every game is b.s. him and keep breaking line of sight to screw him
---
On Coldwind Farm the corn acts like walls so if you stay close to it he can't do anything 
---
Because 3 gens pop before you get to ew2
---
Yeah, I just want it to truly be anti-tunnel. I mean, I can’t stand the guy, but I just watched tydetyme out of curiosity, and even he sees the issue with the 60 seconds and thinks it’s too weak. Ultimately what I think is going to happen won’t be quite what I want, but they’ll just make it so the clock ends when you are downed. 
---
Whenever I play Michael the survivors don't notice me until afterwards. Also at that point, 0-2 gens were popped.

---
I've tried it and it's pretty okay. My phone is an iPhone 10, so it can run it without stutters or anything. But I like the spin it puts on DBD, it still feels like it's own game because survivors are so unique. The killers also have much more interesting powers and other abilities.
---
Survivors are a lot stronger though. So many pallets, all close together, windows do not have entity blocker unless the killer has discount bamboozle, bloodlust doesn't exist without using a perk.
---
But I still think it's a cool time killer for when you want to play a Dead By Daylight (like) game, but can't for some reason.
---
P.S Noed actually doesn't have a counter in Identity V, or any way of knowing before it activates.
---
360 no scope lmao
---
Don’t care about hours, were you a regular player in 2016 and 2017?   The game now vs then is miles
---
Better, balance and bugs 
---
Nothing better than stabbing the air while Dwight dies off camera. /s
---
Judging by the name on the bottom right, I don't think so.
---
Yup, this. When I know a teammate is in a chase I leave my gen 99% and pop it when they go down, as to not waste it if they're not in an optimal position to take advantage of the heal and speed boost.
---
Yeah I'm relatively new and I got the Exposed effect while working on  opening a gate once. I was like well he can already hear me opening this so it's no big deal. Cue me finding out what NOED is and what it does. 
---
I think it's kind of fun personally. I don't invest the hours into it like I do dbd but hunters like Photographer and Wu Chang I found pretty fun to use.
---
Or the sad acceptance that you really expected no less.
---
Easily solvable by the killer showing up
---
The killer was crouched on the other side of the hook. I know what proxy camping is and means and patrolling/checking the hook I don’t mind. 
---
But this pig was sat behind the hook, so close that if my teammates ran kindred as I did, we’d have known she was there. 
---
The meme is just for facecamping killers all ranks tbh. In the past few days I’ve met more than I usually do 
---
I typically play survivor because my internet is really bad and i don’t want to get the reports for “lagswitching” even though survivors ping is almost always 300-400 in lobby. However that said, huntress really is a fun killer because if you play her right it’s impossible to loop her for too long and the cross map hatchets with BBQ chili prock onto an unsuspecting gen jockey are just *muah*
---
I’ve had the same issue on PS4 too and lost a lot of good items because of it. I feel like the least devs could do is make it so that if anyone disconnects, they’re the only person to lose their items, at least.
---
Even having a fellow survivor DC makes the game unbalanced, I hope they find a way to punish this cause it happens soooo frequently.
---
Weird.
---
Yea, outside of that, no one can really counter noed. There isn't any way to prevent such a powerful ability from happening, which is the main issue.
---
Gimme Velma
---
I use it on Spirit and Legion (although it's a placeholder on Legion until I get all the perks I want for them).
---
No one said to remove it, I’m just saying that most of the people who cry about things like this are just bad at the game. I don’t know any good killers who complain about SWF and D-Strike.
---
I never use adren and still get one hit by noed... stop saying that noed is a counter to adrenalin. Its just a OP end game wheelchair.
---
That has never been a thing before, like I've had bad match's but I've never regressed in rank before. I know that that's how it works when you think logically but what I'm saying is that it's never happened before.
---
In a way, yeah but it's also the only perk that punishes gen rushing.
---
That's a big fucking yikes from me. Yeah, facecamping is dumb. Especially considering Borrowed Time exists. 
---
Adrenaline is hands down the best survivor perk in the game. IMO, borrowed time is the only other contender. 
---
Yeah, soon as I figured out what was going on I sprinted away and just worked on gens. Free escape for me. 😂
---
That's a nice snipe right there. Also, that build, did you play at release? That's an OG build if I ever saw one.
---
Well, it's not a new thing. I've been able to derank for as long as I've been playing (about 3 months). What rank are you at when you are unable to derank?
---
Claudette: Well damn.
---
Shut up, stop lying 😂
---
??? NOED used to be for 2 minutes, it's better as a hex perk.imo #3 would be the best option.
---
someone got defensive very quick 
---
SO ITS BEEN NOTHING BUT A CAMP FEST ON PS4 TONIGHT AND THESE ARE RANK 5-8 KILLERS!!! IVE PLAYED 8 GAMES AND ONLY HAD 1 WHERE THE KILLER DIDNT CAMP THE HOLE GAME, ALL THE OTHER GAMES THEY JUST CAMPED, SO YOU HAD PEOPLE DC AND IT HAS BEEN NO FUN, PLUS RANDOM SURVIVORS DOING NOTHING WHILE IM ON THE HOOK!!! Literally JUST STANDING IN THE DISTANCE OR HIDING! HAD A MEG CLIMB INTO A LOCKER 
---
I still feel that NOED is not needed to be nerfed. I do feel that a totem counter would be beneficial. But don't change NOED. Just cleanse the totems!
---
People can derank on purpose till rank 15, or just wait for rank reset to do its work. 
---
Interesting, not my experience. I rarely see devour hope 
---
i honestly don't know what that is
---
This is kinda what I've been thinking. It might be back to eating 4 insta-decisives per game again because it literally rewards you for going for an unsafe unhook.
---
I don’t like clicking A, I changed it to the right trigger. A lot easier aswell
---
Jeffs and Quentins. Quentin especially. Not once have I not ran into a Quentin who wasn't toxic 
---
You never mentioned the FAQ, though. BHVR separated it to a different post, for some reason. I read the first post and that that was the end of the announcement and completely missed the FAQ. I'm not exactly sure why they did it that way.
---
Slither is a movie where the actor of Yondu from Guardians of the Galaxy is infected by an alien and he slowly transforms physically and mentally into a monster with the intent of infecting the whole planet. The way he was infected cannot be used again by him. The original alien cannot infect anything else because it dies. Instead, he grows these slug like things that infect you by going inside your throat and makes you into a zombie like creature and slowly mutates you into the same thing.
---
At the very least, survivors (and killers I suppose) should be notified when a dull totem has been cleansed. Pushing survivors to cleanse totems should be the goal, not just nerfing NOED.
---
Almost looks like a Don’t Starve mod
---
Only downvoting because you made the same argument as everybody else on my comment and didn’t take the time to read the already made response
---
Awesome! I’ll get my friends on this for sure!
---
Does the acronym NOED mean anything to you? 
---
Also it was a get out of jail free card for like 20 seconds before you got caught again
---
Yes. Hills. Drops. Sorry for ruining your argument. 
---
Am I just sheltered or something? I almost never see NOED when i'm playing high rank survivor, and only use it when i'm doing something like Remember Me, NOED, Blood Warden Freddy where i purposefully let the gens get done. 
---
A perk that can be completely circumvented by touching totems or not dicking around in the match post gen completion already sounds fairly balanced to me. 
---
Like honestly, being a killer main aside, laying out what it does and how it can be stopped/avoided it sounds fine to me. If it were that great wouldn't it be in like, every game? 
---
Same. I just fucking lost it. I also love how comforting and yet menacing Huntress is too. lol
---
Stop making these threads.  NOED is fine where it is, and even the developers recognize that.
---
I've always liked seeing screenshots involving this park attraction, I think you'd call it.
---
Also using the perk in a dead zone makes it almost worthless. So there’s that too. 
---
i dont understand the killer side complaining just dont tunnel. This and borrowed time just dont tunnel ever forehead. run make you choice or something get youself the one hit

---
Thanks !! Didn’t expect to see you guys on reddit. We’ll be there all day tomorrow! See you guys if your there 
---
Yeah me too, I am also a survivor main, but I play more killer now. And rank resets are the worst. I died because a Claudette didn't escaped (It was the Pig, I was about to die and escape), and yeah. But for killer, it's another ride, the survivors are super bad or super good.
---
no unless you go for the unhooked survivor and pick them up you will be fine. punish the unsafe hook give the survivor a good slap and slug him so the person who did the unhooking loses emblem points then go for the unhooking survivor
---
Megalovania plays
---
Yeah except noed has a clear counter, what are you going to do when DS strikes and they go back to looping? I’m saying this a survivor, DS is a crutch perk that never should have been in the game the way it was
---
Terror radius too
---
Whoa
---
She’s so cute! Would love to see a series of these!
---
im glad to see this quality of life change to small game getting some traction. personally i dont think this one change will make me run small game but some people will find more use in it
---
I think that’s a bit different of an issue even if it’s the same subject. 
---
For hemorrhage and mangled when you see them for the first time, you probably just have no idea what they do, period. 
---
But for exposed, you’re sorta misled into thinking it’s something it’s not. 
---
wtf are u talking about, so if michael myers is on dbd, they cant create a HALLOWEEN™ game?
---
The huntress is like “let’s not even waste time. I’ll walk you to the hook.”
---
literally me Laurie was my last survivor to get to 40 and i was like i guess for all teachables. got her to lvl 23 then the announced the change. darns in freddy
---
There wouldn't of been any, this was on PlayStation. 
---
Or grabbing a Dwight’s never before seen areas and... ya know ...
---
Because half this game is not knowing everything in the match and having to find out about stuff as the match goes on? Because not everything in this game is meant to be handed to you on a silver platter? Because this is a hide-and-seek game mixed with tag, not a game you know instantly everything that's going on? That's why.
---
You guys don’t seem to understand. I’m not referring to the hill. I’m talking about the rock onto of the hill, the survivor (as seen in the photo) glitched his way up, and the killer was unable to get him. Yes I am aware that both killer and survivor can get into that “glitch” but he didn’t.
---
i feel like im kinda competent so add me on steam CantingPython but yeah the potatos come out of the wood work
---
tUnNeLleD fOr uSiNg AdReNaLiNe
---
"ONLY KILLERS WHO RELY ON NOED WOULD BE AGAINST THIS!"
---
Uh, no.  I'm against it because it's sole purpose is to reassure survivors that a single perk cannot be used.  You shouldn't privy to that sort of information unless you were the one who went around and destroyed all the totems, or one of your friends destroyed them.
---
so far everyone has just insulted me no one has given a single actual argument as to why im wrong, so im not going to change my mind
---
Hey! I'm in this!
---
what even
---
Exactly. “Just cleanse totems”...but you shouldn’t know how many are left and it’s your fault you didn’t cleanse them all. Can’t follow that logic.
---
If you are a killer who does not use or need NOED, you 100% benefit with survivors being more interested in totems. Fact! You can tell the people who use NOED here.
---
Hook fucking line and sinker. Theres no coming back from that. Damn.
---
Does that Hatchet kiss its kid on the lips too?
---
They could make it so it activates once, then stays on forever, and can't be activated again.
---
Did you know that one of the tasks the devs have in mind is closing the gap between swf and solos? Addind a totem counter would extremly add to that. And besides... doing all the totems gives the killer atleast one more generator worth of time. It would extremly benefit killers who dont have hex perks and those who have like noed users still atleast have that extra added time
---
At least they did a better job at translating it. It says 'weakness exposed' or 'weak spot exposed' in our language.
---
I believe they could, but BHVR already pays them to use Myers in DBD, why would they want to create competition for their own product?
---
Stop gen rushing and break totems.
---
It doesn't matter to me either way.  I win most of my matches regardless of what survivors do.
---
I dont get what you're trying to say
---
And that shouldn't be the thought process change. This game is meant to be a mystery as to what exactly is going on 24/7. Survivors shouldn't have information instantly handed to them, it's why voice comms are such a problem in this game.
---
wow.. such a good opportunity and they do that :(
---
As a killer main rank reset is a pain in my ass. All the survivors i go against are rank 1-5 that combo rank reset with purposely depiping. So I’ll go against survivors way out of my league.
---
That was us. I just saw your post. That’s awesome haha. Thanks :)
---
O yeah that decrease from 4 seconds to 3 seconds really got Dstrike good, not like enduring already hard countered it anyway.
---
"yeah unlucky claud, but im still shoving your ass onto a fucking hook"
---
Teabagging and toxic stuff. Perks don't really bother me
---
Here in mother Russia, the killer loops you. 
---
Enduring trashes a three second stun. Besides, Enduring doesn't counter the fact that the survivor still gets off the killer's shoulder. It only alleviates the stun time.
---
No counters....Seriously? If you don't go against a legion who doesn't backstep and does not use frank's mixtape then you have many counters such as pallet landing while he is in frenzy or just juke him using his poor visions against him. Anyway playing legion doesn't mean you can be toxic to them if they are not being toxic to you.
---
I dont know if it's good or bad, but to me it seems unfair to people actually new to the game. New rank 20s versing someone who's depiped until they hit ranks 18-20 isnt a fair match at all.
---
ever thought about putting them under exit gates it works very well
---
"Your time has come, sweet child."
---
Killers can stop DS from ever happening as well. You have no point to stand on.
---
I'm one of the vocal anti-camping/tunneling people on this sub and I don't see that as camping.  You are chasing a survivor and they are dumb enough to lead you around the hook.  You then made the decent decision to go after the unhooker and gave the person who was getting screwed by their teammates a chance to play the game.  Then they lost, which is how games work.
---
Minus the fact that a killer has the ping advantage, so even if you stop healing the instant you get a heartbeat, there's a good chance they saw you even with that.
---
A couple days ago I blew up an almost complete gen immediately and gestured the other survivor to leave as I continued to work on it - managed to get it done right before being downed. Sometimes you gotta man up your fuck ups. 
---
They buffed noed a little while ago. It's not getting a nerf.
---
“We wanted a fun and balanced killer” DBD Devs quoted! 
---
Meanwhile 85% of the DBD community hates The Legion! 
---
He’s or she is mostly annoying in game and I would rather play against a basement dwelling, facecamping LeatherFace!
---
I had 4 today one after the other, two at the beginning and two right after i crossed the gate. It's awful
---
As a red rank killer main I’m personally inclined to say yes. If you’re doing it to play non meta killers, you don’t HAVE to depip to do that. If you just wanna fight weaker survs that’s kinda boring and lame, dunno why you would.
---
But to each his own I guess.
---
OH shes! I forgot! I was thinking when downed directly under the hook. But you can use it to see the killers aura so you can run right into him so u get to use the ds! 
---
Dang that is a myers sized legion 
---
Today I noticed a very minor visual bug with the Michael Myers map - as a survivor when I spawned, one of the sirens of the police cars was shooting a blue laser at me.
---
When starting up the game, all the loading stuff will finish and it will say “Initialization completed” but stay stuck there. Until I restart the game, this has happened more than a few times
---
For toxic behaviour Laurie, Claudette and Dwight although Jake is not far behind.
---
I tend to find Davids and Neas are reasonably well behaved.
---
Kates and Megs are often really good at chases and loops but whilst that's annoying it's not toxic so I wouldn't put them on the list.
---
My roommate and I were also under the same impression until we googled it a couple of weeks into playing.
---
That’s the beauty of it. It was just a really well made shitpost. Nothing more to it. So simple but fucking hilarious. 
---
A mod someone made to take things back to when perks could be umtra-rare lol they look co, no?
---
Yes that goes for most balancing issues in this game. So now its time to nerf noed. Is it a totem counter or a nerf to the perk i dont care.
---
That is such a stupid argument. Self Care isn't a requirement, it is meta. People run builds without Self Care all the time and do perfectly fine. Survivors have their meta perks and killers have their meta perks, the difference is the meta perks for killers vary from killer to killer. My example would be something like this.
---
Having BBQ and Chili works for every killer, while having something like Monitor and Abuse is dependent on the Killer. Myers works great with Monitor and Abuse because it allows his stalking range to increase outside of a chase, while Nurse might not get as much effect out of it. 
---
Survivors do not have this problem as all of the survivors are just skins that seriously function no different from any other survivor. Claudette and Meg are identical in stats and the only difference between them is their teachable perks. Survivors have is so much better then the Killers have it. Survivors have core elements of gameplay that do not function any differently, while Killers fluctuate widely depending on their power. Just because I play Billy does not mean that I could easily play Leatherface or vice versa. 
---
Overall, I can just hear you bitching about how "Killer is Overpowered" and "Self Care is required because I can't stand taking damage." You really need to widen your horizons. Self Care isn't a necessary perk, it is part of the Meta perks. Without Self Care, Survivors would start bringing more Medic Bags, something Killers don't have the luxury of. If we can't use BBQ&amp;C, then we have to suffer without it.
---
 So, you not only make a terrible argument on how Survivors have good perks, which they do have a shit ton of them, you also neglect to mention how Survivors are literally just skins and any survivor can be fitted out to play any way while Killers need to be specially designed to work with their perks as there are very few perks that actually work on every killer. So, I am admitting that you sir or madam, are incompetent at critical thinking, as a seventeen year old who is typing this up just a quarter past midnight has managed to point out the flaws in your argument and still managed to have better spelling, punctuation, and grammar then the person who could not spell the word "necessary" even when all devices have an autocorrect feature now. 
---
I bid you good night, and hopefully when you actually do decide to respond to this, you will think about your argument for more then a few seconds so I can actually have a decent conversation with you, as I do agree that some perks can be overpowered, but saying that survivors cannot live without a perk is an overstatement.
---
I don't care what you are, NOED is a perk that warps the game completely. Everyone says just break the damn dull totems, no that isn't an answer. A full 60 seconds (really more) to break every totem and not even being sure that all the totems are broken in a pub match is not a real counter.
---
Your point doesn't stand.
---
Ohhhh. Yea they do look cool. I thought it was my colorblindness kicking in lol
---
That's so masochist
---
A totem counter is fine, but that’s the most it needs.
---
#6. There were bees in the toilet  in that one nasty bathroom scene, so this hints that the real killer is The Bee! (Survivor Nicholas Cage)
---
Try to rotate the camera while doing gens, specially if the game seems too quiet at the beginning. As others have said his breathing is very loud that's how I can tell he's near me sometimes, he's really not that bad
---
Thank you for sharing.
---
M&amp;A...
---
Just wanted to say that outside of balance and power viability your formatting and tone on this post is excellent and far better than 90% of 'idea posts' that are full of broken english, atrocious flavor text and messy punctuation. Good job.
---
I was playing against a Myers and I was pretty new to the game.  It was my first game against him and I when he went into tier three I started scrambling around thinking he could see me and then I jumped into a locker until it was over.

Yeah, Tapp is definitely a rare one.
---
I think I've only seen five Tapps in all my 600 hours. :S
---
You better beelieve it, honey
---
Nothing stops DS in its entirety. You can run perks or abilities that lessen its effect or chance to hit but, but you can not guarantee that DS won’t go off like you can with NOED. New DS punishes those who play in an unfun way and can be prevented by simply playing in a healthy way
---
did you eat her? now she'll know what it feels like
---
I'm just wondering where all the bee killer memes came from.
---
Maybe it's an application error
---
Well, you could juggle them. You could also chase them back to the pallets that you should’ve broke anyway. And in addition to that you could swing during the strike. And IN ADDITION TO THAT, you could run enduring, or whatever the perk is called that makes you less hurt
---
The irony that a human is eating the Hag...
---
NOED rewards you for not putting enough pressure on gens 
---
You evil bastard, I love it.
---
Not always the case, I’ve done some insidious basement camping with my Leatherface for a few rounds and I sat right next to the hook and would get a 1-3k game normally 1-2k but I would pip up every time! I couldn’t believe it, I wouldn’t be in a chase long and I didn’t touch any of the gens and maybe broke a pallet or two... 
---
The game is not survivor sided, it hasn't been for a long time now. 
---
&gt;NOED warps nothing because NOED can pop no matter how the survivors do. 
---
Wtf does this sentence mean? Dude, either convey your points clearly or not at all.
---
Bit suspicious when the final gen is done, his facecamp tactic fails, he misses his swing on me, and the other survivor that was getting facecamped gets unhooked and isn't found
---
I only depip when I want to learn nurse after reaching red ranks. So like once every other season.
---
If I could practice blinking and stuff offline then I wouldn’t mind, and in kyf it’s a drag cause everyone wants to be killer
---
Same happens to spirit 
---
Pay to win, Cowboy style. 
---
That's a ballsy Nea, just going for it 
---
The snap when a survivor disarms a trap is actually false. Evan is just so dummy thicc that it’s his ass cheeks clapping together.
---
OwO 
---
Yeah, happened to me once. It’s a very crappy glitch. 
---
I hadn’t played in a while and came back. I thought all the survivors were stopping and round house kicking me.
---
I can’t remember who I was, but I feel like I might’ve been trapper too on autohaven.
---
I always have the strange urge to hide in a locker when I play Dwight. 
---
Exactly! I carry the small game perk and count the totems as I run thru the map, I’ve stopped allot of noeds from popping!
---
Every time I prestiged I have regretted it.
---
I personally love spirit. I think I have more fun with her than any other killer. Clown is also pretty fun, too. 
---
😂 😂 😂 😂 Sure Jan. It just sounds like you're not very good, sis.
---
This will 100 percent be my last response to you but NOED warps nothing because its on you to do the thing to stop it. If you're not constantly looking for totems while spinning your camera then you're not trying to stop NOED. You're choosing to ignore a perk that's run pretty heavily from about rank 7 to 15. Like when the killer CLEARLY has BBQ but no one uses a locker even tho he's just running from one person to the next downing them and hooking them. Counterplay is up to you. If you choose not to do it that's no one's fault but your own. 
---
Candyman for killer. They could call him, "The Hive", or some shit.
---
Yeah I don't know why they did that either.
---
I had responded to another comment in this thread talking about the FAQ, should have mentioned it in this reply as well.
---
lmao 
---
Genders don't matter on the internet.
---
Wallhacks? First time I've ever heard someone on this sub mention those, let alone actually in game.
---
Got all the way to red ranks with a 4K every game but ok buddy. If you play top tier killers it’s easy as fuck rn 
---
How is this DBD related?
---
Maybe so but at least I'm a little shit with thousands of hours played that can finish a comment and not have to go back and edit and change what I said. So at least I have that going for me. Have fun playing Bad By Daylight sad boy. 
---
I see you chose wraith as the killer for this, very nice. 
---
"Possible", and it's on the survivor to boot. Ergo, it doesn't have a true counter, and the killer can do nothing on their part to ensure that it doesn't come into play. New DS allows for true counterplay.
---
"Vulnerable" is a better name for it.
---
I try my best to look at things from both sides and will honestly never get the salt about NOED. It's completely counterable and  if it does survive it can be cleansed or avoided by just leaving the game. I get in the situation where you're the person being chased as the last gen pops it feels really, really shitty, but that doesn't mean it's an overpowered perk. If it was it would probably be in 90% of matches like DS.
---
 It's not even worth a slot for me unless i'm playing Freddy, in which case I only ever use NOED, Blood Warden and Remember Me for frustration factor. 
---
I played a LONG time ago
---
This build is ol faithful, survs never expect it when I slug them all then carry them cross map
---
its not. thats why the first thing i said was maybe someone in this community can help. implying that i know its not dbd related but i need help
---
All of you stay away from me and my generator
---
We definitely need something... every other game these days has a DC. I don’t think I’ve ever had a legion game that didn’t have a DC.
---
First off he hacked to get his legacies back after his save got wiped. Second, off he got banned a second time for using exploit spots in KYF, specifically one that REQUIRES you to be in a KYF to do. Stop spreading bullshit lies  then making up a stupid excuse to seem smart
---
Hag's face when all survivors have Urban Evasion
---
Oh btw, yes I am salty because it was my ONLY escape cake left. 😤
---
The susie mask actually looks so much like the looksee from crypt tv (It looks great!)

don't get fucking axed: reign of NOED
---
NOED users be like
---
Leaving a match for any reason should gain you a negetive other than depip. Maybe -50,000 bp, even if the counter goes negetive. The in game currency is a good way to put pressure on rage quitting or DCing. Esp at high ranks, survivors DC left and right but bitch when they are in a 3 man or they just DC.   DC killers ruin my day and really need to be fixed as they are the host. Even if they have bad internet it should punish them to go eithernet or not host. 
---
I wish the movement speed was 5%, the cooldown reduction was increased, and the exposed was removed :l
---
That's great if you feel like you've won if you took enough of the killer's time away, that doesn't change the fact that the perk punishes you for doing well and that should be changed. It doesn't do a good job of punishing tunneling.
---
The timer for DS should pause when you are in a chase or in the killer's terror radius.
---
Don't feel bad if you get to use your ds now, you are punishing tunneling which in itself is a shitty thing to do.
---
This took 20 minutes?
---
This literally happened to me. I thought NOED was the weakest, most redundant perk ever when I first started playing killer. Vulnerable, weakened, endangered, anything else would be better.
---
Best image I have ever seen. 
---
I just had a game that the killer did the same thing, had the same perks, and was playing the Spirit to, but I’m not on their. Weird.
---
I put a lot of work into the Wraith as well. Thanks for noticing! Made me chuckle :)
---
Or if your last alive and haven't been hooked and then get hooked and it won't let you attempt escape, just kills you. This happens to me and drives me insane. It's potentially giving them a free kill.   It didn't used to be like this, idk why it's this way now. Super frustrating because when it happened i brought a greatly increase luck offering. 
---
Thankyou :)
---
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
It’s fun to see how truly stupid human beings can be like getting messages saying I’m trash when I get a 4K or when I don’t let the last survivor escape or when I patrol a nearby hook to see if people are hiding nearby when bqc doesn’t show me anyone.
---
I’m curious as to what led to hem becoming the entitled children they are
---
Ya
---
Note: Not sure if I should mentipb this but yes, I do own Lullaby for the dark, and the Last Breath, and that one with Bill
---
Probably the same killer attempting to depip,  because they are scared of red ranks.
---
No that is not true at all, it's most popular among pretty bad killers because it rewards bad gameplay and lets you get a free kill when you mess up.
---
Assuming EVERY GAME that EVERY KILLER has it is bad design. You shouldn't be basing your approach to the game on luck. Giving the survivors some sort of an indicator for Noed before they get hit by it is much more reasonable.
---
For example, once 1/2/3 generators are done (based on perk level) killer's hands start to glow faintly, or all dull totems give off entity's eerie smoke to show that they can become lit soon. Now survivors know that they need to stop doing generators and get on totems, delaying the game and giving the kill ample time to regain footing and pressure the map. That seems much healthier in design to me.
---
tastes like ruin.
---
Vulnerable would be so much better. It almost seems laughably obvious that it should be in place instead of Exposed rofl.
---
Is the hatchet deflated
---
Oh yeah, probably.
---
Honestly this is absolutely something that needs to change. 
---
I don't automatically assume the killer DCs for trolling (life gets in the way and shit happens) but it is totally unfair, like at worst case if it's a BP perk at the least, don't apply it's affects to what we earn and act as if it wasn't used yet.
---
I know it sounds really harsh but noed by default would be awesome for a lot of reasons. It would add a lot more depth to the game, you'd actually have a choice between "ok let's be safe and do all totems"
---
or "ok guys let's genrush this and gtfo"
---
So you can actually play it safe or risk getting rekt 
---
The devs said they think NOED is in a good place and they don't think it needs a change. 
---
Yeah but my whole point of my argument is that I feel Decisive Strike being a free escape is kinda unfair to begin with, which is why I don’t mind the new change.
---
Decisive strike now punishes killers for success and there’s a chance of 4 of them being in the game at once, if you’re a “ good”survivor and already wasting the killers time, a successful d strike now literally make the killer lose. Maybe I’m too empathetic lol I just want everyone to have fun  
---
19th centure isn’t old enough. They said oldest by far and trapper is from the 1800s too
---
It says everyone has 5000 after a d/c,  but shows on your screen as just your points. Idk why. My friend that was playing said she got 5k as well, always does lol. So I got a whopping 10k for using my escape cake, instead of them just not using it and giving it back. 
---
Do you seriously go to every legion post and bitch and complain? This is the third time I've seen you rewording the same comment. I think you need to find a different game.
---
Sir this whole time I was talking about the rework DS. New DS punishes you for tunneling and it's the only situation when it works.
---
DS had counterplay and could be worked around, I don't agree with you.
---
I’m happy when I play with my friends. I don’t play without them, so I guess ‘yes’?
---
Remember me doesn't really encourage tunnelling. If you target the survivor straight after they're unhooked you won't get maximum stacks on remember me. Better to let them go heal and chase someone else. 
---
I really like this change. Normally when I play survivor I'm the most chill guy in the world. Seriously killers would love to have players like me. I barely do 1 gen and start fooling around, open boxes, cleanse some totems, get chased a bit. But somehow I always seem to get camped, even though I do the furthest from toxic. I don't even run self-care. 
---
 
---
But now, since I always get camped or hook farmed, I can save myself with the new perk. Thanks!
---
My butt clenched as well. That's some real Micheal Myers stuff. 
---
Extra context: this was my two friends, and everything happened in less than a minute (including the huntress finding him because they were screaming at each other so loud they didnt hear the humming)
---
Wish someone would explain why people are down voting this post? 😂 Y'all mad about the red rank comment,  or???? 
---
Not really, unlike DS, NOED can be countered, and that's not even getting into the fact that a perk isn't required to counter it.
---
not at all. camp, tunnel and eventually dead by noed. 
---
Yeah I understand but my last reply was about old DS, so I thought you were talking about old DS.
---
What’s DS current counterplay then and why has been there so much outcry about the perk for 3 years? You can’t dribble all the time so at some point unless the DS user misses, you’re getting striked, not even including body blocking/SWF. 
---
Trying to down and slug 4 players before hooking DS user definitely isn’t reliable either. SWF or just not being dumb beats slugging, even if you do slug are you supposed to wait for 3 survivors to die on the hook before picking up DS and hope he missed it hope his DS doesn’t get him anywhere while also hoping the hatch isn’t open/they aren’t near the hatch? 
---
* Knowing where the Survivors will move in advance and managing time appropriately while outthinking the Survivors: Easy
---
* Walk up to Survivors and bing bong on their ding dong: Intermediate
---
* Walk around and have the Survivors literally scream at you to go kill them: Hard
---
(X) Doubt
---
SWF was actually always planned. They just didn’t have it ready in time for release.
---
In my personal argument Wraith is Easy, Doctor is Intermediate, and Trapper is Hard.
---
* Wraith is literally a default Killer with a supressed Terror Radius when moving between gens. There are technicalities to learn with his power (what addons you like, when you use the power, how to bodyblock Survivors before uncloaking, baiting out Sprint Burst, etc.) but in a massive nutshell the way you play Wraith is by walking between gens and then bing bonging on people's ding dong when you find them.
---
* Doctor has a lot of fine print to his power but he easily has the best detection ability in the game which plays a lot of the game for him. Addon choices and using his power to deny vaults / pallets does take skill but you can just as easily play Doctor like a default killer with improved tracking and you'll be fine. Add Distressing + Unnerving and enjoy making Survivors hate their life.
---
* Trapper... yeah... Predicting where Survivors will go and managing your time accordingly to prepare for Survivors while also still applying map pressure? All while managing limited resources? If Trapper is Easy then Nurse is high school math.
---
Devs letting me slap Trapper's ass when?
---
DC
---
I don't give a shit if it was planned or not, the implementation is terrible.
---
They either 
---
A. Didn't think communication is a game based around not having direct communication would cause issues. 
---
or 
---
B. Implemented to please and grow the player-base without putting much thought to balance.
---
You can't do anything about it now, cause without it the playerbase dies.
---
Should also mention that Legion, Clown, and Pig are all "intermediate."
---
I'd move Billy to disappointing since LF has the cooler chainsaw mori, and bring Clown up to satisfying
---
Man I feel the same way about your last statement lmfao
---
Well, it's time to fuckin' uninstall this trash piece of game- who am I kidding, I'll boot it up later.
---
Ps4. Haddonfield. A survivor got stuck in a locker. I couldnt take them out as killer. Crows circled above them. Had to disconnect because game would never end. 
---
I guess so, since they are still down voting. 😂😭😂
---
So your "kind of a fun moment" is more important than all the immense amounts of frustration caused by DS?
---
Imagine the situation;
---
You, as Killer, have had a difficult match against against some good Survivors. After a lengthy chase against someone who *isn't* the obsession, you down them and start carrying them to the basement.
---
BOOM
---
Two seconds before you can hook them, they DS you.
---
Sure, this is a "fun moment" for the Survivor. But for the Killer, it is controller-breakingly frustrating. The Killer may well lose the entire match because of this.
---
Tl;dr - DS may be fun for Survivors, but the anger it causes Killers (by completely breaking their momentum) far outweighs that.
---
Happened to me once when I was Wraith.  I'm pretty sure it was Autohaven but I forgot at this point
---
I question why Freddy's listed as "hard". He's literally the most basic killer in the game, even worse than that, because he has an extra step (just press m2 and wait a few seconds) before he can hit anyone. He just happens to have the best tracking in the game, to boot. That's not that hard to grasp. Freddy's only "hard" because he has a million and one counters and he literally can't do shit about them at this point in time. 
---
Lol what if someone’s body blocking a hook you’re already walking/dribbling too it’s probably too late to drop them by the time you see the hook is blocked unless you’re already 2 feet from the hook and someone runs to block before you even pick DS up. Both of your first suggestions are alluding to DS gets away with getting hooked which is the point of DS is a free escape. Either you miss your dribble they DS, you drop them and go for body blocker and DS gets picked up so they don’t get hooked, or you slug and go for a different survivor so yet again DS is getting away without getting hooked.
---
And as I said if you’re slugging and have to wait to hook DS, anyone that has .2 of an IQ isn’t going to “run to unhook someone” because they’re just easily going to be traded? They’ll try to get away and get a potential hatch or if the doors are already open then smell ya later. 
---
There’s no way you’re denying that DS is a free escape, that’s literally what the perk is for. A “second chance”. The problem isn’t shitty survivors that hit their  skill check and then turn around and make a bad play with it which is what you described(running directly to the hook for some reason) the problem is the other 99% of DS players at high rank and use it to get a free escape. 
---
The problem with the perk is that is grants you a free escape and doesn’t have counterplay unless YOU mess it up yourself, the perk only fails on YOUR mistakes(missing, going down directly in front of a hook, turning a DS stun into an overall just completely poor decision/play). 
---
Using it to taunt the face camper is worth it.
---
The ratings are a guide on how easy or hard it is to learn all the ins and outs of how to use the Killer's **power** effectively. It doesn't consider *how* effective those powers are, just how hard or easy it is to learn/use.
---
As such I'd honestly say these three are somewhat deserved. 
---
* Placing traps as Trapper is straightforward: put the trap where you think a Survivor will go. Managing your time as Trapper so that 3 gens don't pop as you set your 4th trap can be difficult, but using his power is not and that is the only thing the difficulty rating considers. His add-ons don't exactly complicate the process either and I can fairly confidently say a noob could pretty much master Trapper's **power** within 10 games. Being able to play him effectively and competently is a different matter entirely.
---
* Wraith's Wailing Bell &amp; invisibility can be used for more than just camping or ringing in Survivor's faces, and although it's not exactly difficult or complex, getting the hang of his reappearance speed boost/knowing how to use can be a bit tricky. Not too tricky tho, but it does take getting used to. Wraith's add-ons are similarly not to hard to get the hang of, but they are varied enough and come with varying downsides that it'll take a few tries to get used to all of them.
---
* Doctor's Shock Therapy is a very convoluted and complicated power. Using it to stop loops takes a fair bit of practice, getting the aiming right on shocks takes time, and learning all the ins and outs of his many add-ons takes a lot time. His power isn't easy to learn or intuitive to use, so while playing as him isn't exactly difficult mastering his power and it's variations is.
---
**TL;DR:** The ratings suck, but they aren't trying to be measurements of how easy playing the Killer is. They're trying to be measurements of how difficult it is to understand and use the Killer's power effectively.

---
I wouldn't say that he isn't more challenging to understand but I'd certainly put him at Intermediate as opposed to Hard.
---
Once the last gen popped just as the killer downed me. I returned to injured state and ran for it, across the whole map, to the gate.
---
I was confused as to why they were not chasing. In post game they told me they were confused as hell looking in the grass for me until they realised about 10 seconds later. Heh heh.
---
I’ve been playing for about a year now and I STILL don’t know what exposed means
---
They probably just click leave lighting fast. I love it when the scummy face campers do that. You know they're ashamed and scared to receive any comments after their failure. :)
---
I'm dumb, what am I missing here?
---
I wouldn't say they are entirely OP now. Only swf groups are truly OP, these days.
---
That said, if you think Survivors are strong now; think back to when...
---
Windows could be vaulted infinitely
---
There were almost twice as many pallets on most maps
---
Each pallet, due to vacuums, had a massive safe-zone around them.
---
Flashlights blinded instantly.
---
Hooks and bear traps didn't repawn when sabotaged.
---
Sprint burst could be used mid-chase
---
Etc.
---
Same. And I am one of the guys who thought exposed ment the killer sees my aura for the longest time... 
---
"Ok"
---
"Oh hey nurse is still pretty op but okay"
---
This.
---
Awww she's just too cute!! 
---
Just do gens and get out as fast as possible. The hooked survivor is as good as dead at that point. They need to struggle as long as possible to give their teammates more time to do gens uncontested, though.
---
Well I’m sure Moris and NOED are a good time for the killer. I’m sure killing someone right off their feet is fun for Michael and I’m sure 360ing a nurse is fun for a P3 meg lol, I’m just saying games should be fun and even though some things may be disliked, others may still find them fun 
---
When pigs fly, Freddy is still waiting. 
---
I think 100% like you...or I thought. As killer main, with all the bias that that carries on, I barely see anything done by killers to me when I'm surviving as toxic. That was until legion just put me into deep wound effect, stared at the floor, and followed me without triggering the chase until I just fell to the floor. Now that's my definition of toxic.
---
That should be on display somewhere.
---
Spelling. 
---
My theory is that they never grew up to the fact that you can’t win everything and that there’s always someone better
---
I had that problem when I was a kid but I grew out of that
---
I laugh and read a book, make a snack, or write poems while I take as long to die on the hook as possible and hope the other players are attentive enough to not rush the hook. 
---
If they do YOLO save me with BT, I do my best to try and survive. I always run BT so if I'm the one saving when I realize it's Insidious LF at least the hooked person gets away (when he moves towards the hook and revs he brings back his Terror Radius).
---
This is all assuming the LF isn't camping the basement: LF camping the basement is death, and I never go for basement saves against Bubba unless I can see he has downed or hooked someone far away from the basement. I just stay on generators/cleanse totems (100% he'll have NOED).
---
Honestly, getting hooked would be worth it
---
I’d say it’s more of a situational thing. If you’re in the open, might be better to crawl for a safer spot and then recover. But definitely recover
---
Not sure what you mean with that last line, but no it's not counterplay. 
---
With old DS if the hook is too far you're going to eat the hit unless you decide to leave them on the ground, which then means you either need deer stalker to keep track and stop them from healing or waste your time checking to see if anyone tried to get them.
---
There isn't a single option that a killer has that won't result in being punished with either an increased chase, or just wasted time in general.
---
I will say that I'm not surprised however, that instead of addressing the points I made you instead fall back on "lol killers that dont like old DS are just shit". 
---
That's not an argument, and doesn't address anything mentioned. 
---
And old DS doesn't punish tunneling because any survivor could use it when they're picked up, regardless of if tunnelling actually happened. It was a get out of jail free card that killers had no real way to deal with except using a perk to try to minimise it's effects (that still happen)
---
So again, compare that to NOED where ANY survivor regardless of perks Loadout can counter. Any survivor can cleanse a totem. 
---
And also again getting into reward/punishment. With old DS killer gets punished for carrying a survivor. Regardless of tunneling or not, the killer suffers. 
---
NOED punishes survivors that don't cleanse totems, and even then, can be countered by cleansing the totem, and this avoiding NOED. 
---
With the new changes, now killers would actually be punished for tunneling because of the time limit. 
---
she's gone like 2 years without a nerf
---
or better yet, run tenacity meme builds!
---
i will never forget that one time that a legion slugged me while i had tenacity and i crawled away and successfully got to the hatch across the map, it was the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me in this game
---
I am sorry for the misunderstanding. Thank you for the clarification
---
Any idea how I could fix it?
---
I'm 24, moron. My friend is seventeen and knows who Pyramid Head is. Quit trying to be a smartass, dumbass.
---
These are good ideas. I will surely think about it. Thank you!
---
Ouch
---
Hmm. How did he vault over and then appeared on the other side?!
---
pyramid head mad thicc
---
This concept is actually really amazing, like take the survivors and their respective killers (or just as they are), and swap them, as well as turning their perks on their heads to fit.

Perks.
---
* Bamboozle - After vaulting, the vault point becomes temporarily blocked for 1/2/3 seconds   
---
"Talk about jokes, this guy is bout' to get a real knee slapper"
---
* Coulrophobia - Survivors around you within 10/15/20 meters heal 5/7/9 faster, but you heal 9/8/7 slower.  
---
"Nothin' to be scared of, Turn that frown upside down!"
---
* Pop Goes The Weasel - After being hooked, the next generator you interact with automatically gains a 10% increase of power , but must be done within 10/20/30 seconds of being unhooked.   
---
"It's kinda hard without fingers, but not as hard as listenin' to Ace chit chat with me, haha!" 
---
The Singer - Fame can break anyone, and poor Kate, after years of being lone, drinking herself to sleep, and being abused by management, turned to a more "fruitful" way of finding fun. 
---
Power - Songbird : You have zero terror radius until the ability is active, when activated, all survivors in direct eyesight of Singer will have a speed decrease in all actions.  
---
* Dance With Me - If a survivor hides in a locker for more than 10/8/6 seconds, the locker and a short area around the locker will show red marks.   
---
"What a shame, the storm just came, and the sun faded away. We won't get another day, so dance with me"
---
* Windows of Opportunity - All pallets and windows that have been taken by  one survivor 5/4/3 will be locked for that survivor, specifically, for 20 seconds/ 60 seconds/ the rest of the match, up to a max of 2/3/4 vault locations.   
---
"Why should I work so hard to be seen, not like my family is there for me, still regret what I believed, when I took this opportunity" 
---
* Boil Over - You were a fighter then, you are a fighter now. When carrying a survivor, being hit by a dropped pallet, decisive strike, or flashlight will no longer instantly drop the survivor. Instead, the wiggle timer will add 90%/70%/50% to the survivors struggle.  
---
"Buck and wild, swing to be free, none of ya'll, can get away from me"
---
Seriously, NOED should be nerf to the point where it doesn't even exist ;). Lol just hide.

It looks like Meyers disguised as feng now that I look at it closer 
---
So youre saying the whole game is bad and u get angry bout it. Maybe stop playing the game if its so frustrating? Or just take a lil break from it.
---
I'm speaking in a massive nutshell. Wraith is actually the Killer I road from Rank 3 to Rank 1 for the sake of my Rank 1 Killer achievement. Again "There are technicalities to learn with his power (...) but in a massive nutshell the way you play Wraith is by walking between gens and then bing bonging on people's ding dong when you find them." He's perhaps harder than the likes of Leatherface but still very easy.
---
Well a perk that just gives ms isnt a bad idea.
---
Is there more as to why Mr. X's face has those circles?

Ok, have a nice weekend..
---
It says that shes disgusted from David so now shes Lesbian?
---
Thank you for sharing
---
It’s simply not possible in every match. Spending too much time doing dull totems in a match gives a killer much more time to snowball. Also, reading your previous comment, you seem to think I’m offended by the change to DS. I’m not. I couldn’t care less. What I do care about is that a perk that is broken for the exact same reasons being called “perfectly balanced” just because somebody hasn’t played enough to understand how scummy it is. 
---
Learning that you hold RMB to turn invisible / visible is not "complex." Neither is "click RMB to run fast", "click RMB to throw fart in a jar", or "press crouch button to crouch."
---
Yea but u said doctors power isnt hard? Also its not just the usage of the power, its all the other things that come of it, for example legion does other things than just runs fast when he presses m2.
---
Ego?
---
Pride?
---
One of those I assume

I think you are wrong, Noed is here to punish gen rush.
---
Pretty sure those are just wrinkles.
---
„F*ck this shit I dont wanna be the first one being ignored on the hook“ 
---
Maybe, I don't think so.  
---
What your fix is doing is nerfing NOED. It does nothing for lullaby, devour hope, third seal which are overall not played at all, except for devour hope sometime.  
---
Totem needs a rework, and NOED is just nothing compared to all the shit that needs to be reworked before: hitboxes (on both side, god having my chainsaw/hatched doing trough survivors is annoying), broken map, totem system.  
---
Noed is fine for BHVR, and it won't change right now. I believe it will when they will fix a secondary objective.
---
You can't even see Susie's body in that baggy-ass sweatshirt, lmao.

That's a very bannable offense that you happen to have recorded.
---
Over ten minutes
---
If you havnt made a macro for struggle and wiggle that's on you
---
just cleanse the totems 4head
---
That's called mlga
---
Cheating, hacking, tunnelling, taking the game hostage and DC'ing to ruin the game are all fun for some people. Does that mean they should be allowed? 
---
HELL NO.
---
DS needed a rework. Moris need removing and NOED needs nerfing.
---
I remember doing art like this as a kid its really nice 
---
Looks more like Trump on a very windy day.
---
It has been confirmed that it’s the oldest (that is, from the longest way back, not oldest in age), BUT they also said in the same breath that the Huntress is currently the oldest, from the early 1900s. 
---
I have never seen anything about the Trapper being from the 1800s...
---
Surprisingly no but everytime one went down I was waiting for it like ''oh god don't leave me''

Just post this video attached to your complainment/report comment on DBD forums.
---
Talking to a wall, all of your points lead back to the same thing that you don’t NEED to hook the DS user. That’s the point, if you down a survivor you should be able to hook said survivor aside from sabo’ing shenanigans or just being an idiot and not using your hooks efficiently/getting body blocked somehow, and that’s why decisive strike does, gives you a free get away from the hook from the downed state, literally all of your points are including the DS user not being hooked after they’ve been downed and that’s the entire problem with the perk. Killers are working against themselves, time and 4 other players there’s no room for a free escape..... 
---
All of these little arguments are leading back to the same place, that DS doesn’t get hooked when they’re downed and that’s the entire point of my argument and the reason for people’s outcry for 3 years, this game can’t be balanced with 4 possible chances of downs with no hooks.( 4 survs with DS). 
---
I guess your experience is worth more than the streamers with 1000’s of hours and experience in the game though, it was nice talking to you I hope you enjoy the changes to your crutch while I feel no change and enjoy playing the game with integrity like I always have :) 
---
Or survivors played optimally and coordinated if they play remotely on the skill level of the depip squad.
---
Jesus Christ, it's Jason Bourne
---
I hear huntress' lullaby even when I'm not playing,sometimes.I guess it's embedded into my brain after hearing it for hours
---
It’s billy allen baby
---
Are you sure they won't rework NOED because DS was stronger? Or is it because they've already nerfed and reworked NOED 3 different times and added a direct counter to the perk into each match? 
---
git gud?
---
I don't even play survivor so I have no reason to defend the ds if it wasn't for the fact that as a Killer main I never had any problems facing it.
---
I guess you can't have a different opinion regarding ds unless you are a crutch abusing survivor main. Making asumptions is really healthy. Have a nice day.
---
Oh my god yes!
---
When I started playing and I was against Michael/NOED I just taught they can see my aura, so I never stayed a second after exit gates opened (If I was lucky enough to survive till that point)
---
After that, I read on the wikia what all those icons meant and I felt like an idiot. 
---
I'm almost certain if its a meat, someone sells the head. I've seen goat heads, pig tongues, bull testicles... tiger testicles, whale, walrus, gorilla.... A lot of reproduction organs really...
---
I can hear the vault in the second panel. 
---
Meanwhile I am using my flashlight on killer for 4-5 seconds without blinding him
---
For all the shit Legion gets, they are great for cosplaying solo, with friends or your loved one.
---
Yes but D strikes biggest issue on both ends has always been its binary power benefit and its lack of interaction. A dstrike is either amazing and basically wins the game for the survivor, through a escape or the power of a chase reset/abandonment, Or its next to useless as the killer walks over and downs you once more. Once over this what can amount to a massive momentum shifter, is on a perk where in the killer has no greater power interaction with it. Once you pick up a survivor, its done, it is literally out of your hands, whether or not the survivor escape, is now up to them completely, and while juggling and slugging can work, the first requires a person is consistently close to a hook the 2 times they must be downed, and it of course requires the person does not make it near a exit gate at the end and that their teammates don't play interference in juggling. 
---
As for slugging, slugging is a risk and can often leave you basically empty handed, slugging does not count for a hookstate unless they have bled out for 120 seconds or so, if a person at all heals them before that point then you basically wasted a chase, and have nothing to show for it, minus a injured survivor.
---
That is the big issue with it, in a halfway competent survivors hands it a complete safety blanket that the killer has no effective way to play around, either your not targeted because your the D strike user, your targeted and slugged, leaving you unhooked and not down a hook state for a huge amount of time, or your targeted picked up, escape and get a free chase reset.
---
DBD honestly doesn't seem like a game where a survivor should have a way to fight back fully, its more akin to horror games in that regard, and its mainly because, there is four people, you give them a decent power to fight back, your get what amounts to 4 players and their butt monkey. 
---
Thats why it had to be changed, because at its core, Dstrike is just a unhealthy perk that can never really be balanced on either end, even if it was locked to one user, its still the frustration of a free escape that the killer has no sway or power over. The changes are meant to make it more of a situational Perk, something that is not always used but if the situation arises is handy, instead of its current state as a no downside generalist perk that you have no excuse not to run outside of preference. 
---
TL:DR Dstrike is uninteractive, the killer has no real power to influence it, and its sheer presence forces killers to play around it in awkward ways. At its core Dstrike as a perk has a problem, its too much of a generalist perk, with no downside to taking it, while also having the ability to literally win a game, or to be useless. Both situations are completely out of the power of the killer. Changing it to a situational perk was a overall good decision as any changes to it while retaining its generalist state would still either make it useless, or still retain the exact same issues it has now.
---
Don’t like whispers, fuck playing hag, fuck playing doctor, and fuck playing spirit. Those are my counters to that argument.
---
Exactly so you can't exactly say its balanced and fair if more than 50% of the time you can't prevent it or if you do it messes a lot of things up. 
---
Freaking survivors, doing anything to survive these days.
---
But that's exactly where your wrong, because it is easily preventable or did you miss the part where it was argued that a whole entire perk slot can be rendered useless by survivors doing totems? Enlighten me where there's a single survivor perk that the killer can just dismantle 5 objects on a map to make a perk useless?
---
At this point I’d be happy about almost anything 
---
Half of these isn't even a good perk.
---
If there was, people would say it was unbalanced (even if it worked on all 4 survivors) because during that time the survivors would do gens and the killer would have wasted their time. It works the same way for survivors that aren't playing SWF and have bad teammates. 
---
So what your saying is having an entire perk being useless because someone dismantled the map object to do it while the other team does their job is unbalanced??
---
I hope you don't believe that this is going to work.
---
\-I NERF DS!... NOT FOR HONOR BUT FOR YOOOOOOOUUU !(Whispers:) BROKEN PROMISESSSSSSS!
---
\-IN MY GAME THERE BE NO FREE ESCAAAAAAAPPPPESS!
---
\-MOOOOOORRRIII, It's the way I trigger Yooooou!
---
 (Whispers:) GG Ezzzzzzz!
---
I'm stiiiiiill in a loading screen, it's not a bug it's a FEATUREEEEE!!!!
---
So Hag, who’s naturally runs slower ? Does she move the same speed as everyone else when carrying ?
---
You saw someone running for the save and went to prevent it, that's not camping. You're absolutely doing the smart thing there.
---
Also it's a little weird that you said you avoided tunneling the person you'd just hit because that's not what tunneling is.
---
Gotta do what you can to survive. 
---
I think if a killer stays still for to long they should lose collision, 
---
Imagine saying that both sides are being balanced and then referring to "around a year ago". Fucking reddit garbage website attracts the most crybaby people man holy shet.
---
Oh hey thanks mate, yeah there are a lot of "us" here but we dont make the front page because we arent controvertial and pandering to those who are looking for somewhere to vent. And by us i meant good decent people whether we play survivor or killer, im a killer/flex myself but still, we are all playing games together, i dont dislike people by the role they play but i dislike/like people based on their behaviour, which is usually easy to come to a conclusion within seconds of the match.
---
If they are downed in the first 30 seconds, they probably just see that as a doomed game,
---
Why? The game isn't over until it's actually over. Killers aren't meant to solely prevent Gens from being done they are meant to prevent people escaping.
---
There is no doubt in my mind that this will happen before the rework for Freddy.
---
Oh my goodness...
---
I don't know but I'm pretty sure they're the same people who like to gloat at the exit if they escape 
---
Well there has been a lady in a panda costume on his streams so it could belong to either of them.
---
Because you need to shut the fuck up, right? Right. 
---
Noed was to combat gen rushing and toxic survivors, decisive (until the rework) wasn't to counter toxic or tunneling killers, with the current rework of DS its more effective at countering these things. Maybe I'm not imaginative enough to figure out a good rework for noed that could combat gen rushing that isnt attached to a totem (like discordance), without an ebony mori or one hit add ons
---
If you're talking about dribbling then that is unreliable and needs to be done up to 3 times. It's also extremely diFFicult to do against people that aren't the Obsession.
---
If you're talking about leaving them on the ground then that's an even worse way to kill someone as it takes 4 minutes to bleed out.
---
&gt; I shouldnt have to run a perk to counter NOED. Its shitty enough that it exists in the first place. All a perk counter does is bring solo up to swf level.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; The totem counter only makes NOED a little more bearable, you still have to find and cleanse all the totems
---
You don't have to, just locate the destroyed totems and cleanse the remaining while keeping a count, that's what I do. If you want that extra info a perk is required and seems balanced to me. If will remove a crutch perk from survivors in order to make sure the killer won't have a strong perk in the endgame. 
---
\*In the distance\*  
---
k o o o o o O O O O O O B E!
---
&gt;Bubba disagrees, but I'm glad you understood the problem as much as the devs did.
---
Bubba with his chainsaw Revved is one of the specific scenarios I mentioned but it must be revved and right in front of the hook, otherwise you can perform an unhook. 
---
If he is pacing back and forth and you still can't save, just get gud. 
---
“HRRRRGGGHHHHGGGRRGGGGRTRDD!”
---
That’s Bubbanese for “Bitch, you ARE a side of beef.”
---
For me the cowboy hat would be my first target. Same goes with the no shirt dude and the neon hair bitch. But I tumble the no shirt guy lol
---
I agree it's very difficult to convey an idea or a plan when you have two emotes to use 
---
Oh god yeah new emotes wound be good
---
Killers shitty ping even though it was green before the match started compounded by the shitty hit boxes and hit registration in this game being 100% reliant on the killers connection = no fun. 
---
Or because it's legion. I'll waste your time long enough for a gen or 3 to get finished and then DC so that the others at least have a chance of escaping. I'm not gonna play against someone abusing an exploit. Killers cry if a survivor stands on a rock but exploits the mend timer by moonwalking. Hypocrites.
---
Yup u preachin the gospel lol, 
---
Do more! This is awesome! Very well done! 
---
All depends on the game, but really I don’t enjoy camping unless the gates are open and I just threw someone on the hook.
---
Were they polite survivors? Meh, just play another round.
---
Were they rude? Teabagging? Taunting? Post chat shittalk? Okay, time to put away the fun killers and break out Legion for an hour.
---
That homie body block at the ens too. Puts a tear to my eye.
---
Thank you 
---
I don't think in game audio would be the fix but something to let the other survivors know whats going on at least
---
Yeah, bloodpoints are independent and not specific to certain characters. Only things specific to the character are lost

---
&gt;Finding the locations of and cleansing all 5 totems is a real big time sink for survivors which gives them no advantage bar the killer not having NOED. Really I think cleansing dulls should give the survivors further advantages but at least a totem counter will make the process a little bit easier for solo players
---
You gotta be joking.
---
You can scout for totems when moving from one gen to another or for a save. "Oh look, there is a totem".
---
People talk as if totems spawned outside the map and not right next to survivors objectives. 
---
Ranking up isnt difficult anyway its all about playtime that month once you get past rank 10 everyone is more or less the same
---
The only killer that is actually hard to master is nurse, then there are a few intermediate like Myers, Huntress, spirit and hag and the rest is really easy to learn and master
---
Its still a time sink in a current fast meta, survivor cleansing totems often wind up losing as its such a timesink with again zero reward apart from denying an annoying killer perk.
---
My point is survivors need more incentive to cleanse totems, just denying NOED is not worth the time sink if the killer is good, you need every second. Wasting time finding totems is bad enough let alone wasting time looking for already cleansed totems
---
I don’t see why doing totems are hard for people... everyone uses noed now days so you gotta do totems vs gen rush. Just look at it as another objective. Insta-heals and ds are annoying for killers . Plus if you’re in high ranks , you should know totem spawns by now .
---
This one sparkles joy
---
It's more respectful than an "it".
---
Small game can help, but Detective's Hunch from Tapp will do it's work better ! You have to complete a gen in order for it to work, but I think it's not hard to memorize where the totems are once you know their location
---
If you play SWF you can communicate with each other, and if you like playing solo you know you are putting yourself at a disadvantage compared to SWF players. Playing solo is already harder since you cant communicate as well as SWF. And by buffing solo you are also buffing SWF which is already broken, know groups dont even need to talk to each other to get the job done. Going against SWF is really annoying and becomes a challenge for killers and by buffing solo you are also making it harder for the killer. You can only see it from eh survivors POV which would be a buff to survivors, but if you take one second and look through the eyes of a killer it is a massive nerf.
---
Some people dc when they miss their ds. It’s so funny to me . But yea definitely going with being embarrassed or just realizing it’s a legion and they don’t wanna deal with that stress in their life .
---
Most people play with atleast one friend. Split up and just count it down. Totems are so easy to find and theres even a perk you can run. Not sure why these posts are whining about totems lately. Just assume past rank 10 most killers have it. 
---
Stabbing multiply times was unnecessary, unless you'd been a toxic, thing that is confirmed by clicking the flashlight. He failed in stayed down instead of being in the stairs or at the door. Anyway, you had lucky because the other would not have rescued you. 
---
The tables have turned
---
A totem counter literally just means you dont have to go looking for already cleansed totems.....You still have to find and cleanse the totems before this. Its a qol change. 
---
DS has been changed. Instaheals are very rare/rare item simaler to killer addons
---
Plus not everyone has a mic and not everyone can hear which would create issues
---
The rank system is already broken, I dont even need to read this. But you still get an up vote so that in some parallel universe they nerf legion or just remove them.
---
If someone wants to take this clip and add "Déjà Vu" to it, be my guest.
---
Toxic behaviour in postgame is very common, especially at higher ranks where survivors tend to care about winning instead of just having fun.
---
Yeah, this is sort of known Legion is an annoying farming central killer.
---
Thankyou! Feel a little less of a noob now ha 😂
---
Subarashiiiii
---
So your advice is to play SWF rather than make solo a bit easier? LOL okay 
---
Those characteristics fall under the attributes that make killer 4 times better. OP, from this post and others, wants survivors to get easy escapes and more crutch, and not actually change the playstyles such as tunnel and camp. 
---
Again this is not about finding totems its about knowing you have found all the totems. What is so hard about this? It just lets solo know that they have been cleansed.
---
I don’t even have to kill people to rank up with him, says a lot. 
---
Im playing solo, why do I have to play with a friend to know that totems have been cleansed?
---
 But it’s fine for killer to have to run enduring to counter DS ?
---
That's what's meant by 'totem counter'. Something that counts the amount of totems. An unfortunate case of homonyms.
---
This is the only acceptable change to NoEd, imo. Perk is fine as is, but it would be useful for both sides to have a totem counter. Survivors to know and for killers to know, too, and get a warning early if their NoEd is gone. I am a totem goblin and I would like to know how many totems I have left to touch and moan over. 
---
That's the thing,it just depends on wether the Killer is having a bad day or not OR if the surviour is acting like a bitch
---
My theroy is when I play my beloved huntress

If this refers to the R exploit (being able to drop a survivor mid flashlight save) then yeah, that is an exploit. And yeah you're an asshole for using it. Flashlights are already way weaker than they used to be, I reckon this entire post is bait.

Engravings be like

Haddonfield. There are trees in multiple tiles that can grab survivors and prevent movement until they are hit by the killer.

Just check spawns then. Totems generally spawn out in the open even without small game itll take like 1 minute for one survivor.

Can agree

Nea and meg are literally the highest

Survivors often get pissed if you dont follow their made up rules like dont down someone and chase another person or dont use a mori of my favorite dont protect the person on the hook when both exit gates are open and you killed no one so far xd You should not camp for no reason and overall just play fair so no hacks or facecamping someone from start ^^ and some survivors will be pissed no matter what so dont cre

The new DS nerf was announced AS he was leveling Laurie for it

Take the hint.
---
That "fine print" is what makes Doctor hard. 
---
&gt; NOED doesn't need attention [...]
---
Honestly NOED is fine, there's 4 survivors and 5 totems (which spawn in a formation &amp; have set spawns) to cleanse. The perk only works if survivors let it.
---
Nice artwork.
---
Says there's no counterplay,blatantly ignores the fact that you can just down the unhooker so you avoid DS.
---
The community spoke against DS. Nerf. The community also spoke against NOED. No nerf. More survivor nerfs over killer nerfs. Wtf, and I main killer.
---
You need more hits to get Iridescent Chaser. 
---
I personally hate slugging to get the 4K (both as survivor or killer) but I understand why a lot of players do it. It’s over the top to tell you to uninstall the game and kill yourself because of it though.
---
I have never sent hate mail because of it (or at all) but it does suck to be the person being slugged. You’re unable to do anything and kinda just have to lay there for 3-4 minutes until you either bleed out, get hook or your teammate gets found. It’s incredibly boring and even though I rarely do it myself, I do understand why people DC if they’re getting slug. Especially if it happens very often. You’d rather just lose your points for that game and start a new match instead of having to just wait for several minutes.
---
Basically I like the change, but it needs a few small buffs to be somewhat consistent or we'll get this bullshit again of "it doesn't feel good, so we're gonna leave the abusive broken shit that it is now in the game for another year."
---
As a survivor main, I really hate people like this. They ruin the game for killers and for their fellow survivors.

---
I don't play hillbilly or nurse.
---
For killers with lower mobility it is not nearly as good. If you do see someone, there is a good chance they are either faking it out or by the time you are close they have moved towards the hooked survivor. And I've played long enough that most of the time when it procs, it was on the gen I thought it would be on anyways. Really its best use is knowing how many people are close to the hook, but I would honestly rather have a more universally helpful perk. 
---
pissed myself at the claudette
---
I did when they first added MYC. 
---
But there already is a perk to counter it. Small Game. Know why it is never talked about? Because NOED only kills people at the end of the game who think they played well then failed to compensate at the end and go btfo'd. It is the ultimate casual filter.
---
It's actually:
---
4 / 1.75 = 2.29 s
---
3 / 1.75 = 1.71 s
---
1.71 &lt; 2.29
---
Of course, your point still stands. Just want to clarify that Enduring **increases the rate that you recover from stuns by 75%**, not reduce stun time by 75%.
---
I like prestiging my characters because it lets me have a “goal” of some sort. I also like the look of the bloody cosmetics.

No. Mining the salt does, however.

i wish you were my killer :( i done been playing cowboy jake since it was added and i get tunnelled to death

You say that, but anyone who breathes through their nose will just stop tunneling when Dying Light procs. It is literally a non-issue.

I will

Ah. Like a *literal* counter.

My bad.

You need to "hook" them, or get stunned.

Sure it could be better but even using lf i still like it a lot. U know where some survivors are sometimes all and even if they run towards hook theres a decent chance u will cross paths. Plus its waaaaay better then the survivor perk equivalent

Stridor makes Survivors sound closer than they are with Spirit. You can run it on anyone, though.
---
Rank one from like, 3rd day after rank reset.
---
I promise you that I am not just blindly trying to defend the perk on a wave of other people doing that, I'm honestly speaking from my experiences. I've never had problems with DS and I win most of my games. I do admit I am a rather patient person and I can see why some might find the perk annoying. 
---
I just argue that there are ways to play around it and the perk isn't that bad. But any complaints about the changes don't matter anyways, the devs are set in their opinion and nothing is going to change. We've had that with Legion and exhaustion changes, we'll have it here too.
---
no, i’d agree with each ranking
---
base it off of a new player thinking about what killer to pick up, not a seasoned killer who knows general killer gameplay 
---
Nah, I've seen some *shit* on the Switch.
---
I’ve never come across an obnoxious quentin, the ones I always play with are usually the most altruistic 
---
you’ve clearly never played the doctor like...... ever
---
imo the counter play is down the unhooked but dont pick up so that way the unhooker loses emblem points then chase the guy who unhooked. At that point you have someone slugged one being chased and if they are a swf 1 person going to heal them and one on gen instead of 2 during a normal hook
---
“Honey, it’s time..”
---
“I know..”
---
Or on your steam page -rep.  
---
  
---
Which makes no sense since you can just delete them...
---
"Ikr" (c) Huntress
---
I believe the main menu has a tutorial section with a list of the status and what they do, correct me if I'm wrong. havnt played the game since legion release and i don't remember if the status are listed there.
---
Recently had a trapper game where I got 4k because last survivor thought I was camping hatch.
---
I had no idea where hatch was and was just spamming traps for points. I did not care about hatch escape.
---
&gt;It's always funny to me how many people seem to forget enduring is a thing. It's the biggest counter to current DS making it not even a 1s stun. If you can't hit a survivor right after an enduring d strike, then you should feel bad xD
---
Enduring doesn't stop the survivor from escaping the grasp.
---
Unless you catch that survivor out in the open, the looping will just resume. Survivors usually go down at loops because they either took to long to drop a pallet or because they went down after dropping it which means at the very worst scenario, they are still in the general proximity of more loops.

Isn’t is possible to dislike both? I’m a killer main and I dislike noed and ds.
---
They said they wont nerf noed because its not the equivalent to DS.
---
So they're saying. Its a strong perk with only 1 counter..... BuT DS sTrOngEr lMaO
---
I’ve thought about running it on spooky myers if I think the survivors will hide from aura detection.
---
Lmao what? Stop making threads trying to buff DS and forcibly nerf NOED. Decisive Strike gave a guaranteed second chance to any survivor who can hit a skill check. NOED can be completely deactivated before it even comes into play. NOED and DS never were, are not, and never will be on the same level.
---
You can dislike whatever you want, there's nothing wrong with that. 
---
My issue is the false equivalency between the two. From a mechanics standpoint only one of them allowed for counter play, options, and actually punished the opposing side for a valid reason. 
---
We get it. Decisive got a nerf. Everyone's happy, but these are starting to get boring.
---
Hahahahahahah
---
Same it’s fun to watch the enjoyment drain from your eyes
---
This is the moment where that overly altruistic team member crouches behind a rock instead of doing a gen, and half a minute later decides to run into the chainsaw anyway.
---
&gt;Have you seen any gameplay of bubba camping ever? You don't have to be revved, vicinity is enough. And again you still don't understand it's not just necessarily Bubba, face camping is the same as infinites for survivors.
---
I've performed saves against bubbas countless times. It is incredibly easy nowadays because with unhook protection, the other survivor will go free even if bubba unleash his chainsaw. 
---
It is just Bubba because any other killer you can easily unhook against. Unless you are a brain dead survivor who just stays crouched near the hook watching the other guy enter struggle or die. 
---
It wasn't a nerf, it was more of a change. Now the perk makes more sense as it's a counter to tunneling, and no longer a tool for the toxic survivor groups to take advantage of.
---
The loop thing is connection, the window thing is just windows. A killer can smack you over them at close distance
---
That would be op 
---
There is an add on for myers where he get Evil withing much faster when stalking his obsession. Now he could drain his first obsession and then make a new obsession
---
Trash Killer lol ggs got me WEAK 😂
---
I mean sounds good to me. Whenever someone gets hooked, reveal the killers aura for 2/3/4 seconds with WGLF
---
Your removed post before this is literally called “buff DS a bit”, and this post is called “if you’re gonna nerf DS also nerf NOED”.  I watch the Devs play DBD matches and they literally promote cleansing totems to avoid NOED, if you hate NOED just leave the game once a gate is open.  
---
If you don’t want to wonder around and cleanse totems and your team gets fucked by NOED, you guys really have no one to blame but yourselves. 
---
If NOED needs a nerf, it’ll get nerfed. If you want to get to the Devs, actually send in constructive ideas instead of cry calls. This thread will do absolutely nothing to NOED or Decisive Strike.
---
Post Your templates so others can also make then and then post way to many of them in this sub until everyone is tired of them.
---
Lol, wtf? xD Its almost identical
---
It depends on your rank. In the lowest ranks, no one can hit the skill checks, so everyone will be looking for the totem, wasting time, so you can stay close-ish and they'll all just come to you to die.
---
On the highest ranks no one cares about ruin anyway, so you don't need to protect it, they will only destroy it if they stumble upon it by accident.
---
Mid ranks are the trickiest in my opinion, since there's a mixture of both types. Usually 1 person tries to power through Ruin, 2 are looking for it and the 4th one is Urban Evading somewhere. There, maybe I'd try switching TOTH for Whispers and proxying the totem from time to time to see if anyone is near? That way you don't waste a slot with a hex and Whispers is also a good tracking perk, which you have mentioned for your 4th slot. So it's a 2 in 1 perk for tracking AND protecting Ruin, and your 4th slot is free for something else.
---
My first game Micheal went to tier 3 and I was so if confused. I ran not knowing how to play the game
---
And that spread the flashlight does when you succeed?
---
Huntress would have a better mori if the first blow wasn't to the head. 
---
Why didnt claudette phase away?
---
Oh yeah he wouldve blinded at every pallet lol
---
https://youtu.be/HHPBoEiOoeQ
---
First of all, depends on the killer.
---
Second of all, Ruin does it's job if you get a hook without gen pressure overwhelming you from the start.
---
For me if one gen gets done for one hook vs a competent team, Ruin has done it's job.
---
Against the really really solid teams, even Ruin won't help you to begin with :P
---
Ruin isn't meant to be kept around the whole game. If it just delays 30s it makes a gigantic difference. 
---
Hex perks definitely have a heavy risk and heavy reward structure, so your fears are not unfounded! My favorite build right now on Spirit is Ruin, Haunted Grounds, and Huntress Lullaby. Even if they somehow get Ruin right off the bat I can usually still stack up HL and slow them down, if they fail to get both before even 3 tokens on HL it's hilarious to watch gens to screw up everywhere and nothing get popped. 
---
Sometimes the best method is sink or swim. Just toss yourself in several games without TotH, without even Ruin, and see how you do. See if you can get used to it. A lot of people find that there are just one or two perks they love, as a surv I find myself missing Lithe far more than even missing self care if I switch it off my perk lineup. It's really odd but sometimes you just get stuck in a rut.
---
Lmao "just leave one the gate is open". Yeah i would do that once they are open. What else im gonna do? Oh yeah actually open the gates and get to them
---
And i didnt delete a thread personally i said in that thread that ds should stun the killer 4-5 seconds instead of 3 so you actually have a chance to escape from the tunnel.
---
Ouch, it's like you've been in half my matches. 
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again: altruism kills far more survivors than anything else. 
---
&gt; If the killer sucks sure, it's incredibly easy to smack down the unhooker I do it all the time when they rush the hooks. 
---
Then you are correctly outplaying a camper. By switching places with the hooked guy are buying more time for your team to rush gens. Rinse and repeat until doors are opened and bodyblock to protect the last guy on his way out. Easy 4 survivor escape. 
---
&gt;However you still don't provide anything why you think face camping should be in the game or that it's not a problem.
---
Because it is a strategy just like any other and a bad one for that matter. Killer will walk out with two kills at the best scenario if playing against smart survivors. The other scenarios involves 4 survivor escaping or 4 survivor dying, depends on how good you are. 
---
I find outplaying a camper quite fun, specially when it works and he camped all the match for nothing. 
---
Depends on the killer and the map really. Most killers still get memed on at high ranks.
---
I play more survivor than killer and to be honest most of the changes haven't really had much of a negative impact on me other than those damn vaulting changes way back when that happened.
---
I’ve never had a problem with NOED, it’s easy to counter and it’s a nice side mission while in the game! I’ve used it allot especially when I first started playing the game and I sucked, it was a nice perk to have for helping out new players and still is fun for catching people off guard for the end game! I can’t believe how many people literally cry like 2 year olds about NOED, when it’s the easiest perk to counter! Just cleanse 5 totems that’s it before you pop the last gen! Hell if I know there is only 1 totem left and it’s well hidden, I will leave it just to see if it turns into NOED, then cleanse it to be a asshole and for the 1000 BP’s! 
---
So you made a thread trying to buff one of the strongest survivor perks in the game, makes perfect sense.
---
If you actually want to send something constructive towards balance there’s a place for that, it’s the forums. 
---
I don't get the joke.
---
I spot a Manbun Jake.
---
I hope that it gets permanently primed when you're downed so you can't just play around it by slugging.
---
This looks quite amazing.
---
And i have no idea why you all of a sudden just decide to come up with different threads now. This thread is this thread stop pulling other useless threads into this. Wandering around the map to find a fucking totem when i end up seeing 5 destroyed totems is such a shit idea. No wonder this game is dieing. I fuck over myself and the killer. I and the killer in the endgame have to wait for me to see 5 destroyed totems. Would you want that every damn match? Its a game not totem search simulator
---
"You know the rules, honey."
---
GOTTA GO FAST !!!!
---
Read her lore, she killed German soldiers in her forest during WWII.
---
If you think it needs a buff, why do you use it every match ( I know it! LOL).
---
I wholeheartedly agree with this post.
---
How can Killer mains like this version of the perk better than the other one? It literally is a buff to the already ridiculous perk and takes away any counter you may've had before.
---
Now, there's no reason *not* to run it, considering there's a full minute for the player to leave the hook's vicinity and heal. But to not hit the previously hooked survivor you would need to know where the unhooker went to, and that is somewhat difficult to tell, when one runs urban and the other one just sprints to the nearest locker.
---
And plus, yeah you can't even know if they have it or not so you have to rely on luck alone to be able to eat it up before going after the surv
---
What a stupid rework 
---
It's a huge waste of time for everyone involved, just hook the 3rd guy, then if you find them, you get 4, you don't, they get hatch.
---
It's really not worth the effort to fuck around for 5 minutes looking for the last guy while he's creeping around, waiting for the hatch.
---
Haven't everyone and their grandparents said "just use Enduring lol" when it comes to DS?
---
Just equip Small Game and Detective's Hunch. 
---
As much as I hate to admit it, Doctor now resides on the bench and is replaced by Legion for BP farming (for me). 
---
Hook everyone once, run around frenzy'ing people: boom, enjoy your 48k bloodpoints without killing *anybody*. Oh, and you pip for some stupid reason.
---
Now, on topic...
---
The ranking system and Legion are orthogonal. Legion doesn't break the ranking system because the ranking system is inherently broken with or without the existence of Legion. You can just suddenly see all the flaws in it because Legion emphasizes many of the flaws.
---
I think Legions being able to climb due to how broken the system is, is really not an issue. There are a two achievements for hitting Rank 1. There is no incentive beyond that. Literally none. You will not play against significantly better players at Rank 4-1 than at Rank 10-5. Let people get their free pips. They mean nothing in this game. 
---
Nah i prefer to do it endgame because now i can see the totem burning. Dont wanna do 4 totems and then realising noed was the 5th one. And doing 5 totems every game to counter a perk is boring. So ill just do it endgame
---
Then cleanse totems so the perk doesn’t even activate???? Totems spawn in patterned spots anyway so?
---
People just don't understand psychology and risk/reward gambling.  
---
They just want the game to be spoonfed to them, even though that's not what this game is about.  
---
With NOED the way it is, it's a psychological deterrent to gen rushing and not doing totems, since you could get 1 shot, slowing down the game overall.  
---
You can either rush and risk getting noed, or do all totems and risk wasting the time for nothing.  
---
Regardless of what happens, you had some say in it, and so it was partly your decision.  
---
It's the same with the new DS, it's a psychological deterrent to not tunnel. Sure you can tunnel off the hook, but you risk getting bonked in the face and dropping the survivor, they might even be protected by BT, making the whole process not worth it.  
---
Do you tunnel and risk getting a bad deal, or go for the safe option and attack the rescuer?  
---
There's a ton of these things the devs put in to affect gameplay, some people are just too dense to get it though.
---
Can't have any fun without each other...hope everyone is doing right by their worse fifths
---
Then your team can get wiped by NOED. You can blame yourself then 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
Looks about right to me.
---
Why the fuck is camping the only way to avoid DS? That's just a stupid statement, because it's probably the **worst** way to avoid it.
---
I bet that you had the opportunity to leave but you didnt.
---
I like your flair
---
I'm gonna assume that was sarcasm. Tell me, what argument do you have against giving people more bloodpoints?
---
I've always hated adrenaline, it gets almost no mileage in solo play but is the most abuseable thing in SWF cause you can just sort of erase the mistakes of everyone and destroy any sort of strategy the killer might have been doing.
---
Slugging and sharing pain, getting someone down to their last hook and suddenly they can be pulled right off the hook at full health.
---
Honestly I almost never run NOED, but adrenaline makes me so angry I almost want to run it just to counter adrenaline.
---
Why do we still meme about a guy who is no longer relevant? Let it go. 
---
tf
---
Yeah but i will be save. Its just gonna take me 5-10 minutes but who cares. The killer will have a great time going around the whole map for that time and looking for me to finally just leave or die.
---
Since people keep posting these threads over and over I'll start spamming this reply as well:
---
&gt;DS CHANGE HAPPENED, HOW ABOUT NOED CHANGES?
---
&gt; We aren't planning to change NOED at the moment. We consider that NOED has multiple gameplay counters and is currently in a good place. We do not think of NOED as an equivalent to DS.
---
[Q &amp; A ON THE UPCOMING DS CHANGES
---
](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/48381/decisive-strike-upcoming-changes#latest)
---
If it really takes you 5-10 minutes to clean totems that is actually hilarious lmao 
---
It literally just counters noed by telling people they dont have to look for totems anymore not even helping them find them. If counter to NOED is supposed to be doing totems survivors should have some information about it
---
If you need a crutch perk you will never improve. Perks are supposed to help your gameplay, not play for you. Ruin is supposed to slow the game down to have MORE chances, but without Ruin you still have chances. There are a lot of perks that slow the game down like Sloppy Butcher or Pop Goes The Weasel.
---
Legion 
---
Oh, shit! I didn't know that, case closed then I guess, hehe!
---
Id rather not waste more time on something that has already eaten a fair bit off my teams time already just to see the totem has been cleansed
---
Soon 
---
what "premise"?
---
Ehm the stun with enduring is 2,7 seconds cause it works with actions speed and bhvr has intentionally reduced the stun recovery by ds by 20-25%
---
Rank?
---
Response to Point One: If you can survive without it, it isn't required. Just because it is a meta perk doesn't mean that it is required. If it were required, then every build would be forced to run it. Not every build is forced to run it, and running it to avoid the rare case of Franklin's Demise is not worth it. Running it because you keep taking hits just means you need to sneak better or loop.
---
Response to Point Two: You just repeated my exact point, survivors are skins, so something like Self-Care doesn't change anything about your playstyle from one survivor to the next, while those perks that you were talking about being meta perks or "required" are heavily dependent on the killer AND the player.
---
Response to Point Three: There is something called "implication" - You implied that killers had these perks that were meta and were basically bullshit requirements.
---
Response to Point Four: Spelling, punctuation, and grammar - the core parts of the written word. It makes you like you are some twelve year old who just got finished playing their favorite game and came onto Reddit to talk about it if you don't at least try to use skills that were taught in school.
---
Response to Point Five: It doesn't matter if the development team doesn't care or doesn't know how to balance their game, they need to attempt to balance the game, even if they are horrible at it.
---
All of this in conclusion, you are still wrong, Self Care is just meta, a word used to describe when something is frequently used due to the power or skill that it takes to use the thing in question. Fox is the meta for Super Smash Bros. Melee due to his versatility and being the best pick overall. Self Care is meta due to many people being alone for most of the game, causing isolationism to play a core factor in the perk's use. The common thread with Self Care is the idea that if nobody is around, you can still be safe.
---
you dont actually have to play the killers to get their perks
---
You dont have to run enduring to counter DS now, this argument is outdated
---
I agree with you on this but perhaps have the person unhooked get the aura effect to help them get away from the killer and prevent tunneling.
---
Sometimes, but windows are fine imo
---
Yeah but most of them are pretty straight forward. Blindness doesn't actually hinder visions but does blind you from seeing auras, although that's rather difficult to figure out. Hindered slows you down. Hemorrhage is bleeding more. Mangled makes you need to heal more. Haste makes you run faster.
---
Exposed is only one of two that has this issue, sharing it with Blindness for not being readily apparent. The rest of the status effects I feel are pretty straightforward and can be picked up on without reading with a combination of understanding the word and actual gameplay effects.
---
It's also sexist against men.  
---
I'll explain.  
---
You see, then I see cowboy jake, I get an erection, which drains blood from my system, blood that could go to my brain and increase my performance, now because I don't have that extra blood, my performance goes down, and that's not fair!  
---
Stupid sexy Jake!
---
Using NOED against Solo queus is overkill. 
---
Yha, shrine, but I just couldn’t get any
---
Not to mention upon its inception it wasn't tied to a hex. So if you were next to the Killer you'd be hooked for sure. 
---
NOED's already BEEN nerfed. It used to be permanent, people! 
---
psshht these reddit killers dont like the truth
---
Well maybe premise was not really what i meant. I was talking about the whole "lack of information and communication" 
---
So what are they there for then? If survivors are supposed to cleanse them every game to avoid a possible NOED thats all they are there for? 
---
This is really why totems barely ever get cleansed, they give you 600 points and waste time you could be doing gens/saving or doing anything beneficial. I honestly want there to be some incentive to cleanse totems or make it less of a pointless task just to avoid NOED. It would be better for the health of the game anyway as survivor would have something else to do bar generators.
---
Basic idea I had was that totems effect survivor action speed.
---
5 totems= 15% debuff to all actions
---
4 totems= 10% debuff to all actions
---
3 totems= 5% debuff to actions
---
2 totems= No debuff/buff to actions
---
1 totem= 5% buff to actions
---
0 totems = 10% buff to actions
---
This helps slow survivors early game and buff them late game as the killer gets an edge and provides totems a real role in gameplay. 
---
I think the fact that it activates during the pickup instead of several seconds later is how it always should've been. It was such a waste of time to sit there picking them up, walk 3 seconds, get stunned for 4 seconds, then figure out where they ran off to. This version wastes so much less time.
---
I didn't realize it did that, which either means I haven't noticed, or damn I am bad at flashlight blinds. Checking video shows it does in fact pop a notice, so I'll be watching.
---
I use ruin the same way I use discordance.
---
As long as I find 1 survivor before a gen is completed, it has served its purpose. It basically gives me time to get started.
---
I like discordance for the beginning of the game cause survivors usually spawn with another abc start a gen. As people begin to get hooked etc.. it becomes kinda worthless as everyone is spread out.
---
I only run haunted ground with ruin. Never TOTH. 
---
Don’t worry I have borrowed time.
---
The games long since moved away from that lets be honest, also I dont see how a totem counter is any different to a gen counter
---
It's an interesting idea, but it seems like it has the potential to be more powerful than regular NOED? 
---
If say survivors didn't do any totems, at that point you're beastly, and they have no real option for removing the ability. 
---
Then again obviously if it's a limited amount of hits the opposite could be true...
---
It's definitely an interesting idea, but I suspect in practice it would result in wild power swings (comparatively) 
---
I agree almost entirely with the rankings but Feng is placed too low, dude. Fengs are usually up there with Claudette and Megs when it comes to BMing, Teabagging and overall toxic behavior.
---
Made me lol
---
I agree that swf and some other additions made dbd stray away from that. I really have no problem with there being a totem counter, it just depends on what bhvr wants to do with the game
---
Wait, what?? That makes absolutley no sense, the devs aim to make the killers have a 50% wr, im not talking about what toxic killers, nor toxic survivors want. Im talking about what the devs aim for
---
Yes.
---
It’s absolutely a nerf, how much of one depends on if the clock part remains as it’s written or ends up getting tweaked some. As it stands, it’s a huge nerf
---
Sounds like someone took the enjoyment from your life long ago :( 
---
Your art style reminds me of claymation and I really love it! Keep it up!
---
Honestly the only reason to slug is to be toxic. It doesnt matter of you get a 3k or a 4k. I always hook the 3rd survivor and if I find the 4th one,great, if not, not a big deal. 
---
hours don't mean your opinion is right 
---
This would be a nightmare to code
---
idk im in the camp that swf is not that hard to fight against.
---
Like if they all play well and 3 escape without tunnelling/ camping a poor sod they earned it
---
Does this one spark joy?
---
It's so simple yet survivors find it hard to understand. Even with Kindred they still do the same
---
Probably easier than current nurse lol.
---
Alert was in the shrine a week or couple of weeks ago
---
Welcome to the life of Killers in 2016/2017
---
They never claimed it took months to make, they just wanted to have fun with something they like. Why so bitter?
---
Last week, still waiting on it appearing on the bloodweb.
---
The rat just wanted to give them cake and icecream for someone's birthday, as they do.
---
just wow lol
---
The Trapper and it depends on what perks I run, don't really have a favourite survivor. 
---
cool
---
It happens when you use unbreakable right as the killer starts a grab animation. I have similar clip in my post history, I made it to the hatch while floating around lol. 
---
Mine switches all the time. But currently it would have to probably be Nea and Wraith. Wraith was my worst killer and I hated him but I forced myself to use him and grind him and currently hes the killer i play most and get 4ks consistently, I love his add ons a lot of them are really really good and synergize well together. Nea is currently my fav because she has the best cosmetics I have and she also had all the perks in the game along with david and quentin, but idk what it is but the girls running animation seems faster and more fluid even though ik its not. 
---
cool cool
---
I'm really curious as to whether people can drop enduring or if enduring is still pretty mandatory 
---
Jake and mikey
---
Mikey, cool cool cool
---
Sucks that they don't get it but exposed is a synonym for 'vulnerable' .
---
you must be terrible at using search engines [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=dead+by+daylight+decisive+strike+nerf&amp;rlz=1C1DKCZ_enUS794US794&amp;oq=dead+by+daylight+decisive+strike+nerf&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.12948j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)
---
&gt;That’s so dumb a totem counter really? U can’t count in your head stop be so mad because ds got change yet again not nerfed just changed
---
You can count totems you physically saw already but say someone removed a totem or you removed 4. Seeing 1 totems left or 0 totems will save you a lot of time.
---
What’s considered delivering pizza in dbd though? 🧐
---
Spooky
---
What’s this new perk called?
---
Actually, to be fair, I got one today for the first time in ages. In all my hours of playing it's happened like 3 other times at most to me. Even during the mass blue screens post release of legion, it didn't crash once on me. But I'll reiterate that the circumstances were very suspicious of this particular case. Also, I only got blue screens loading into a match, not during.
---
Sometimes, I would relapse and start exorsim-ing in the air
---
Feng and Spirit. I'm not good at Spirit, I just like her.
---
Only killer complaints I've seen is how it affects killer obsession perks, which is a reasonable concern. 
---
Yeah, it's unlikely, but still possible.
---
Most people just use Enduring not for DS, but for its combo with Spirit Fury to end chases. I mean DS is also a reason, but not the main one, so I don't think this change will affect Enduring.
---
Facing the doctor is the hard part

That's the reason why you don't fuss if you run into NOED if you didn't cleanse all the totems.
---
Rank 1 from locker hiding? I don’t know about that part. Lockers don’t add pips. 
---
The Q&amp;A was talking about a possibility and I didnt run enduring on huntress because I dont plan on eating pallets but had been tempted to so T3 DS wasnt as much of an issue
---
So much for the Jeepers creepers theory when dave made a 23 years reference on stream (before clown came out)
---
I could be wrong ... but I’m pretty sure the obsession can’t change . Ie if you kill your dying light obsession and someone else decisive I don’t think they become the obsession. I think it just hides the obsession so killers don’t know you have decisive in the event you’re not running a obsession perk. 
---
I never said they did. You're the one making accusations. So who is really the bitter one here? Sure as shit ain't me. 
---
I wouldn't say Enduring is mandatory, it's just a great perk if your playstyle involves not respecting pallets.
---
Why should survivors get extra information the killer doesn't? If the killer wants to know how many totems are left he has to use a perk. The fair approach would be to give survivors a perk similar to Thrill of the Hunt rather than just making the game easier for them cause they're complaining.
---
Probably one from the olden days of rank 1. I've had my share of 4 man squads who would run D-strike, Self Care, Sprint Burst and Saboteur with 2-4 BNPs and the rest with instablind flashlights who would all burn offerings to autohaven, run my poor Trapper around for a bit, t-bag at the gates and then flame me in post game for sucking.
---
So if my posts seem a little jaded from time to time, you know why.
---
The light also spreads when you succeed
---
Billy and Ace
---
Dying Light is going to be even worse with the change. I wonder how StBFL will be affected in the long run, since this change means you could potentially hit someone who was previously the obsession without losing stacks now.
---
Separating certain colliding objects from others would cause a lot of problems.
---
Aura reading wise there are better perks for killer
---
Heh. I did this to you. I'm not even sorry :D
---
Worst game I ever played was on The Game (and how you play it) and it was against a tunneling Hag who just decided she wanted to farm after sacrificing one of us. And we didn't want to deal with that shit. So we started doing generators but she had ruin and when we found it, she kept slugging anyone who went near it. And the game went like 20 mins. Back and forth of trying to get the totem. We didn't tuff it out and do the Gens because fuck that. We wanted to kill the totem and leave the damn match. It was stupid as hell 
---
You should be punished for using vertical video - oh, you were :D
---
I.... Why do I love this so much?
---
The status effects are pretty vague and the game never actually tells you explicitly
---
Crazy how the devs do that. 
---
Dude I wouldn’t worry, the perk is easy to play against if you don’t tunnel the survivor and I doubt it’ll change obsessions If you already have an obsession in the game. 
---
Basically, Nea is going to die bcuz she got some slappin beats. 
---
That's basically it. 
---
Wow thank you this is really concise. I’ve sunk over a million points into her the last few days and luckily I’ve managed to get all your recommended perks apart from Brutal and shadowborn. Nurses is only tier 2 but hey I think that’ll work for now. 
---
I think my main obstacle right now is aim and timing but with help like this I’m sure it’ll only take practice. I can think of several occasions in recent games where I’ve made the wrong choices regarding when to wind-up and when to just keep forward momentum. Oh and the tip about self care hitboxes.... thank you so much that’s already worked well for me in the last game I played. 
---
Many thanks. 
---
Damn, I knew I should've given her a flashlight!!
---
I'm not talking about those, I didn't said everybody agreed 100%, but the overall feeling was a positive one, with concerns and ideas from both sides, I'm talking about the killers that suspiciously use the same cries as the toxic survivors, just adding *as a killer main* to the same rant posts.
---
From what I've read the changing obsession has good and bad things, like any change, good things for Rancor and Save The Best For Last and bad things for Dying Light (a dev confirmed you may get multiple moris with Rancor now).
---
 That's the reason they are testing it in the PTB, to see if the good is more than the bad and they keep it, or if it turns it has more bad than good and they scrap it.
---
yeah, no - thats actually what happens, they included a list how the perks work with the change, dying light is unusable after the change. If the killer actually kills his obsession and debuffs the survivors with dying light, the moment someone uses DS - he becomes the obsession and dying light will get deactivated again so the killer now has to tunnel the next survivor down to activate the effect.
---
Like what?
---
Now you get to repay all those ebony moris
---
Lmao I don't even have the Halloween pack. 
---
I wear a bright green ass apron. If you don't see me, I think you need to turn up the brightness on ur screen
---
Some new perks thy could be semi meta for example 
---
Exhaustion
---
Every time you successfully stun a killer you break into a haste for 3 seconds, 60/50/40 cooldown
---
Tracking
---
When damaging a generator it reveals the last survivor that worked on that gen for 2/4/6 seconds
---
Yes! It was actually kinda worth the wait :)
---
If they get to rework Freddy, Legion, moris and the endgame with the same mindset, this game will finally be actually living up to some of it's absurd potential. I just hope it's soon enough this time lol
---
I don't wanna do my Social Studies homework. 
---
I have a few more tips but I can’t really explain them over message too well so there is a dannohtml video called the ultimate huntress guide where you can see in game examples and more tips
---
**WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZE
---
Yeah, I am. They're both exploits. It doesn't matter if one is different than the other based on terms of which side is taking advantage of an exploit. They both share the same characteristics. They're exploits, cheats, unfair gameplay, boring, not worth playing against. They are the same thing because they're in the same family. They both take advantage of error in design to ruin the game for someone else. 
---
If it wasn't an exploit then why are the devs reworking legion right now? He's broken by design that's why.
---
It's commonly said that humans only use 10% of their brain. Most of the people on this sub seem to only use .3% of it. Which is reserved only for memes, apparently because when it comes down to critical thinking skills, y'all seriously lack it. It must be all that "common core" bullshit in public schools rotting your brains away in favor of pushing that NPC mentality.
---
Yes I agreed on that on another comment. But what I meant by "discovering the game on your own" is that, you see the Exposed status, you get one shot for some reason with the icon of a skull on your right. You can understand what it means, so I still think there are argument on both sides, and I was getting upvoted at first so I know I'm not crazy, but thanks for replying !
---
You sound like you’re doing a good job for being new! As a survivor I just “get it”. There are killers who will slug for 4K - just remember that someone can only be in the dying stare for so long before they die anyway and then its just as if you had hooked them but without the bloodpoints you would have got for hooking. Anyway, some killers will get impatient and hook the 3rd if they can’t find the last person. Or they won’t even care. If I am the last person found, I don’t even try because 1v1 with a killer and multiple gens needing to be done is a waste of time for both usually. I would rather find a new game at that point. The nice thing is some killers respect the plays and if you were good enough to evade them and do a lot during it, sometimes they show the greatest mercy and give you the hatch anyway. I never wiggle if I’m the last person and let them decide to hook me or give the hatch.
---
Personally, I love games where there are slugs and opportunities to get people back up, they actually feel a little more fun to me (as long as people are able to get back up for a short time). Or when the killer plays around a bit - like a wraith camper game where I knew he was camping a slugged body upstairs and I saw him through the window so I motioned for him to come after me. He did and he chased me around and I was able to meet up with the other guy and get him back up and we all chased around like that a couple times. I died on hook and he died on the ground but I laughed the whole time at the game it didn’t even make me mad this guy was such a camper. 
---
if new DS hits you, the guy who DSed becomes the obsession, this means that:
---
* dying light *can be turned off* (but it sucks anyway and needs a rework so most don't realy care)
---
* Rancor can *mori multiple people* (situational, as its endgame and you need to be both close enough to recatch before they get to gates and find a new guy to get DSed by, it does make rancor a Russian roulette though so keep that in mind if you want to DS, you become the rancor target later if no one else DSes)
---
* remember me can be made useless (obsession isn't effected by it, this is more of an issue than the last two)
---
* STBFL/PWFY shenanigans (I think its net neutral on those two but we will have to see)
---
It was confirmed that DS will mess with obsession perks (dying light particularly)
---
I don't think countering T3 DS just for that deserves a perk slot. They may not run it, and if they do, it's just one time per match, absolutely not worth it. At least that's what I think. 
---
Now, if you run the combo then it helps a lot with T3 DS. As Huntress I don't know if it would be worth it, but as a Myers for example it's godlike.
---
How do we say that x is a wall and something else is not? Like some fences on haddonfield, some houses with window vaults, etc. Would be really confusing to pick up a character that is that inconsistent
---
Sad that there's less of this kind of content and more just "OMG GETTING HIT BY NOED BE LIKE XD"
---
Is that real?!
---
The only thing that im suggesting she cant go through is walls so anything that isnt a high connecting wall is fair game. Not sure how thats inconsistent.
---
It could have been funny with the Doctor face too since she says "Is it real ?" after that.
---
How do you figure that? Kill the obsession... and someone else becomes the obsession. This is a hard nerf for Dying Light.
---
We will
---
asians, cool cool cool cool
---
No u would know when the last gen is done I’m pretty sure everyone is just mad because of the ds change there is a lot of counters for noed maps,count, it’s only 5 totems and u a good survivor if u break four out of five totems means the rest of your team should have helped you while they do gens should look for it and high ranks don’t use noed it’s not a good perk can be countered in many ways 
---
You don't need to run enduring at all, it's just an amazing perk. Allows you to swing through pallets and take ds head on. But it isnt necessary 
---
cool cool cool cool cool
---
Ah thank you :)
---
*Va va voooooom*
---
Will check this out right away. 
---
Quality shitpost.
---
And as I said, I didn't see those complaints you're talking about. I'm not saying they don't exist, of course, but there's obviously not that many... and chances are good that they're lying about being killer mains.
---
The DS nerf isn't the problem. It's that the devs refuse to change NOED which is just as bad as DS if not worse. At least DS requires you to do something afterwards not just a lmao free escape. If you can't run the killer around DS ain't gonna help much. And it's not garbage you reddit killer main. Just learn to play. You can slug/dribble/use Enduring/position yourself. Damn some of you are real bad.
---
When is a wall high connecting? Structures like generic tiles, house walls on haddonfield and springwood, big buildings like coal tower and such? 
---
Houses, main building structures etc.
---
I think, the Entity searches for survivors, who havent been touched by evil yet. Who are full of hope and strength, so ithey can suffocate long enough, and dont have to be sorted out all the time. Additionally, they have to be ordinary, to show us, the player, that we can be next, causer, after all, its a horror story BHVR tries to tell.
---
Think about it. Who are the vicctims in a horromovie? Casual Teenagers, not suspecting anything. :&gt;
---
thx for that. I tried to activate it, but it was checking for updates. Left it on over night, still checking for updates... talk about buggy lol.
---
no way that shit lasts. I’m fine with the perk but don’t make it change obsessions. Just don’t make it an obsession perk anymore. There’s no reason for it to be one. Like really if you’re not running any other obsession perk it doesn’t benefit the survivor to want to become the obsession.
---
Hag and Tapp. 
---
By sensible I meant not obvious trolly. TBH, The only reason I've replied to a selective few right now is cause they're short and i'm busy right now, I'll tend to the long ones later.
---
When you're in the air: this occurs because the game believes youre in the killers arms, so whenever he swings, you float like that. As far the random slow vaults, I don't know 
---
I assume this is each individual survivor escaping?
---
Well I hope to change your opinion on Jeffs. UwU 
---
I can’t pallet loop to save my life and essentially dedicate all my perks to stealth and gens. 
---
Yeah there was a post on the steam community with a study on it hold up I’m gonna find it
---
Good let it die
---
I believe it was confirmed that if the obsession dies and someone else use Dstrike, Dying Light's effect will go away until the new obsession is killed.
---
Tenacity + unbreakable  + no mither gang
---
Most seasons I get to rank 3-1, hovering around there. Some seasons when I'm busy with college I usually end always above rank 10, usually closer to rank 5. I have 1.1k hours and I started playing in the private beta (not the same as the public beta).
---
I figure it’s easy to play against because if you don’t tunnel the survivor who just got off the hook or you slug them and leave them there is no threat of s decisive and no threat of changing obsessions. 
---
Im saying as in like to them it would feel like they were tunneled
---
"Let me know what you think."
---
Stop asking for a fucking NOED rework! Just do the damn totems!
---
Make more, make bigger
---
This comic is so perfect. You can just hear David's thoughts the moment he appears in the window. 
---
"Ha! This idiot's doing a gen all by herself, let me show her how it's done. 
---
Damn, she made me miss the skillcheck, stupid game design. 
---
My work here is done. You can thank me later Claud. 
---
Can't believe I have to carry all these noobs."
---
In the fifth panel we can't see Huntress's face but we know she's also watching David disappearing in the fog. She think "Yes, I have a special hook for him in the basement. Maybe I'll even carry this Claudette to the hatch if she doesn't use the DS."
---
I'm not even a killer main and I can see how annoying that shit was back then xD
---
tbh if it didn't you might get survivors cheesing the timer by going down 5 seconds before its up and then continuing the chase after DSing
---

This would be an issue if the ranking system wasn't piss poor in general. If anything rank is nothing more than a measure of time spent playing the game per month.
---
My worst games seem to always be on The Game. Feelsbadman
---
If we'll be still playing this by that moment lol :D I'm kinda already tired of DbD
---
Wow you did an outstanding job on Claudette!
---
How about those with vaults? Do some bigger fences count?
---
Generators are literally the only thing the survivors are required to do aside from opening the gate. That's their one and only objective, so saying that they can't set aside 30 seconds per survivor in order to not have noed be a thing sounds pretty stupid and enabling. And if you do dribble, then that's a small counterplay. It's not a good comparison. Also, cleansing totems grants more points and is a good idea overall. It doesn't make it a fifth perk... If anything, noed barely survives when people are good enough to play the right way and cleanse early. So then the killer is left with three perks... All because you realised 30 seconds of cleansing was really valuable for late game. 
---
No one here is defending Noed my dude. 
---
TBH, the only killers I feel I get memed on, is probably pig, huntress (I don't play her enough to have the skill to warrant the kind of wins I get sometimes with her), Nurse and Spirit. 3 of which I'd debate are skill-based killers most of the time. But again, these are my own experiences. 
---
Furthermore, I played Freddy recently quite a bit and I don't feel like he's as bad as people make him out to be, unless you get in those sticky situations where you've had a shit early-mid game. Unless you have some end-game perks as Freddy, and you've had a decent early-mid game you are gonna get trashed. But if you have a bad early-mid game, then you kinda don't deserve to get those kills imo. 
---
Freddy being an example, I just don't feel like killers need these massive changes being made to benefit them anymore.
---
Thats 209 hours in lockers. What a mad lad
---
On Crotus Prenn Asylum, as Spirit:
---
I killed off 3 survivors with only 1 gen done. Then Nea with urban evasion kept hiding somewhere in the building, holding the game hostage. She didn’t get any progress on gens. Eventually, I unplugged my Ethernet cable, so she would get disconnected. 
---
It's even worse when you consider Small Game, Detective's Hunch and the Red Twine Map add-on exist and yet people still refuse to bother with Totems.
---
anyone hear remember when i made a psa for ruin being in shrine? i got it and i've been waiting for it on nurse bloodweb this 
---
Mr. steal your flashlight and mr. steal your drone
---
nea and hillbilly 
---
XD I don't understand people
---
About time they reworked it I think. Can completely fuck up the game if your a killer atm
---
I hate the ds change because now mori, which is already extremely powerful, can hard counter it and it seems to be another band aid fix but this time for tunnelling, though if the new 3 second timer at all tiers is still reduced by enduring, it isnt going to help much unless you were hooked at a place right next to a pallet. 
---
In my eyes, it seems the things killers find annoying are taking priority over what survivors find annoying. Ds was very much manageable unless all 4 survivors ran it and used it and were good at the game, other than that, it was just annoying. Exhaustion nerf tried to fix sprint burst but ended up hurting the other exhaustion perks and making chases easier to manage. Where's a change to camping, or maybe making pink moris less of an annoyance too? 
---
As someone that *always* uses it I honestly feel like it's fine as it is. The info it gives you is pretty damn powerful and even though it has counters it doesn't feel too rough.
---
The DS nerf will be a problem tho for killers running perks that aren’t NOED. I made my account to express my hatred of Noed and I agree with you that Noed should definitely be changed. But this is a SURVIVOR perk being nerfed ... which could potentially be a problem for KILLERS. So surely you can see that this might actually be a problem too ? 
---
Thw survivors are just salty. Slugging is a perfectly fine strategy.
---
But the pizzas do
---
Honestly, I hear survivors asking for a nerf more often.
---
Ummm.... I've seen quite a few killers defend it by saying "cleanse the totems" but ok. And then there are the people that say "Oh but I doN't run NOED" while defending it. Well k but that doesn't mean it boosts shitty killers
---
I find myself saying "Nea, why?" In most of my matches, and then there's immersed claudettes, so those 2 are my least favorite. Ace mains are always good boys
---
I never said DS didn't need a nerf. I just find it unfair that they didn't make any changes to NOED
---
No cats ain't real. 
---
I don’t completely disagree, but you can easily circumvent NOED by leaving all dull totems out in the open alone and cleansing all hidden totems. That way if NOED activates, it’s just in a couple easy locations. Maybe if there was a minute delay to NOED it would be more “fair”? You can’t cleanse DS as a totem tho, so it definitely needed the rework as a crutch perk. Plus it sounds like the skill check won’t be as hard, which will make it worth it even more.
---
By definition, to "nerf" something is to make it weaker. This change definitely makes DS weaker. Although nerf infers change, it too, is a nerf. But the problem with the new DS change is that it's too easy to counter. It's going to become a perk that's rarely used imo. 
---
Even so, this discussion isn't wholly about the changes to DS, but what the changes to DS are a bigger part of. DS was believed to be the best asset a survivor can have (given it's in the right hands), but killers still have many powerful tools which are imo much more powerful than DS, and doesn't get benefited by skill. 
---
Killers still have many powerful tools that are just powerful at base and the devs have no plans to alter these at all, in fact NOED was technically made a little stronger when they made it give 1 downs at all levels. To my point, NOED is a perk that you can just effectively mow down survivors with at the end. It is at it's most useful when you've played poorly all game, and requires no skill and is just powerful with no skill. However, compare it to DS. It's benefited by skill as it's technically more powerful if the user is skillful. Given a weak player uses DS, even if they hit the skillcheck, they probably won't last very long given the killer is decent. DS is a perk that gets more useful the better the user, NOED is used to get kills when the killer doesn't deserve the kills. 
---
I know my response is a lot longer than probably the one warranted but I wanted to express my full belief.
---
I think legion being able to get points in a system that has almost no benefit isnt really his first flaw.
---
The pip system is too easy to score in anyway. Really don't have to play legion to get the emblems he is good at to a high tier
---
I like playing against legion, but one look here shows those people are in the minority. So let's fix him before we fix how easy he can pip, actually lets also fix the emblem system so it's actually difficult, and rewarding
---
Was playing with a friend yesterday and we managed to do the last 3 gens with dying light active and tanatophobia (me being injured). It took us two and a half years but we escaped. Poor Mickey didn’t understand how it happened.

PS4 disconnect issues
---
My Internet is fine on other games but for the last 3 weeks I constantly disconnect from DBD. I play, join a game and about 10 mins in "you have disconnected from the host" and back to the start screen. Then I can't go back into the game without checking my network connection / restarting the game. I really don't understand what I can do to fix this.. I haven't ever had this issue in over a year of playing dbd? 
---
I've even had my internet provider check if there is an issue and they say no, none of my other devices are disconnecting from the internet either 
---
Perfect
---
Ace and Bubba
---
The only survivors I ever give the hatch to are pizza Dwights. No exceptions.
---
No, the *asakillermain* are not that many, the toxic survivors are the ones that have been very loud for obvious reasons, tha majority of the community is ok or at least understands the change even if they don't 100% agree, which is fine.
---
And yeah, that's what I was implying, most of the *asakillermain* are not killer mains or are just toxic survivors that play killer from time to time. But there are toxic killers that used DS as an excuse for being toxic, and since they can no longer use that excuse they are mad.
---
Just what I said, this is not about survivor or killer mains, this is about toxic assholes.
---
I saw someone's post saying that they figured out how to go from rank 17 to rank 1 as legion, without hooking anyone.
---
It's Laurie's perk, she's designed to be an obsession for the killer. The Final Girl. Besides, no survivor should *want* to be the killer's obsession in the first place. Being the killer's obsession should be a bad thing.
---
Dude I made my account to complain about Noed , I’m in 100% agreement that Noed is the worst perk period and doesn’t belong in this game. Yesterday there was a discussion about it and I went into EXTENSIVE detail as to what my problem with the perk is and what I think should happen to it. I’m saying no one in this particular discussion is talking about Noed so no one is defending it. 
---
I had to take a break of a few months due to some stuff I had to work on. It was great, I was kinda burnt of DBD by that time and the break helped me to build up stuff changing and me forgetting some things about the game.
---
It's better to do that while you're still not burnt out tho, so you can retain some good memories to look forward to tho. Otherwise you will need a much bigger break.
---
Like, Civilization just got some nice content recently afaik lol
---
It looks like the streamer is enjoying it just as much as Billy is
---
People didn't realize how much of a struggle it was back then, hell it really is still a struggle but its getting better.
---
If you have played at rank 1 as survivor and you ever wondered why queue times were so long it was because it wasn't worth playing the game as killer at that rank.
---
One can dream, right?
---
its not the same a halloween game than michael myers on dbd, and probably BHVR want to add Jason, more people will come to play the game if Jason is in.
---
Of i play killer the most annoying are Kate, feng met or claudette. I am a nea main but i am not that good at survivor. 
---
Slug them then. In that kind of situation it'd be totally reasonable. It also assumes both people are running DS, which odds are they won't be.
---
Won't happen and I'll tell you why. The killer can see the survivors in the lobby. If the survivors are all female characters, they'd be able to use that to their advantage. If they aren't they would be able to switch to a different character. So as long as the lobby system stays the way it works right now, it's impossible to implement what you're suggesting.
---
Also for Remember Me (cuz the new Obsession can open the exit doors with normal speed).
---
The best thing to do is to change it to scroll wheel down, so much easier than spamming the space bar (or at least I find).
---
Just gonna hop on this thread to say that this is an asymmetrical game. The killer is meant to be more powerful than survivors, perks included. Also, DS now fits in with other situational yet powerful perks like Unbreakable and Deliverance. Perks that are that powerful *should* be situational and easily countered. 
---
That bug gave me depression, thank God they patched it

Yup just found it quite scummy they were running loadouts intended to cause and then take advantage of the bug.  I took Sloppy off my Wraith at the time due to the bug.
---
id consider the "hard" killers Nurse/hag/sprit/huntress/freddy:
---
Nurse/huntress: Pure mechanics, as nurse you need to learn the blink inside and out, as huntress you need to learn how hitboxes work and things like not being uber predicable at pallets
---
Hag/Freddy: pure tactics, hag has tones of uses for her traps (instant hit, mind games, cam swing, tracking etc) and tones of possible spots she can place them, and the use can change in real time based on what you and the survivors position is to the trap when it goes off, Freddy is a basic M1 with the map knowledge of a god and besides his great stall, its his main advantage and needs to be taken advantage off, also he needs to effetely micro manage 4 survivors between chases and keeping people in dream to stall effetely, both play a game of chess with survivors (assuming they aren't rank 20 potato's and the hag just camps with 10 traps and the Freddy tunnels with blocks)
---
Spirit: mind games, she needs to get into the heads of the survivors she's facing and outplay them hard, often trying to fake her intentions to fuck with SWF communication, which can vary a lot between games (its hard to make this sound hard but vs survivors who *actually know how to play vs spirits* its hard af)
---
By more powerful I feel like it's rare I get anything less than a 2-man. Yes I'm supposed to have more power, but not so much to the point where I feel like I rarely 'lose'. Although, it's hard to define when a killer 'loses' because it's an asymmetrical game and you are a solo player vs many which you have to kill, but I do understand it's not easy to balance asymmetrical games as a result.
---
His name eh joe
---
This is what I posted yesterday in a discussion about the devs saying how Noed doesn’t need any rework. You don’t need to explain anything when I already agree with you. 
---
I’m seeing a lot of people comment “cleanse totems and you don’t need to worry about Noed” but that “counterplay” doesn’t mean the perk is fair on survivors. I hate Decisive crutch and think it never should have been added to the game but NOED is a perk for killers who haven’t learned how to play the game. Which funny enough at rank 1 the amount of killers I’ve seen who can’t secure a single down until the end game when I see they have Noed is ridiculous. It’s a crutch perk that bad killers use because they can get pity downs and usually guarantee a kill. Usually why killers even achieve higher ranks because they get a pity pip while they’re at it. As a SWF Noed is never a problem because we can quickly cleanse all totems and focus on generators so the whole team can escape. As a solo it’s a different story all together. My games can vary from me having to do at least 3 gens solo to me looping the killer long enough for them to give up on the chase knowing I’ll keep wasting their time or they just can’t catch me ... and in that time no gens have been done and to add insult to injury someone immediately went down 20 seconds after my chase ended.
---
This game is all about time management and I can’t waste time running around the entire map looking for a totem when they may or may not have the perk. I already have to solo gens, go for saves cause my team either won’t or are all on or heading for hooks and then try loop the killer when they find me. As a solo I can’t guarentee my team will cleanse totems or do gens or do anything to help. People will say “learn the spawns” and I do know the spawns, I play enough to know where totems will spawn but I shouldn’t need to fear the obj...you know the only thing survivors have to do to escape...because there might Just maybe be a totem someone’s overlooked on the map.
---
The whole counters arguement is stupid because DS has counters in perks like Enduring, Unnerving, Rancor (which I haven’t seen mentioned) or even Iron grasp (to counter any non obsession DSs) and of course gameplay with juggling, slugging and positioning over a height. Even some killers like clown and (I might be wrong but) doctors ability can counter decisive. Enduring is a strong perk without a DS in the game and both unnerving and rancor aren’t bad / wasted perks slots. Whereas with Noed I’m not running small game period. Perk is a joke and I’d rather blindly look for totems with a 4th perk which will actually help me survive. Detectives hunch I’ll agree is a strong counter as I can play the obj while searching for totems. However cleansing every totem on the map to counter one perk is a much bigger ask then any of the others counters to hit decisive. Could you imagine if you had to cleanse all totems to remove ruin. Also let’s not forget that the devs are trying to improve totem spawns so they’re not easily found. Which only makes Noed harder to deal with or makes it a greater waste of time if they don’t have it.
---
Not to mention you know if a group of survivors is running a DS cause there’s an obsession whereaes Noed doesn’t work like rancor and tell you you’re exposed. The Perk is poorly designed just as Decisive was because they both reward failure. Failure to escape a chase and failure to prevent the survivors from completing the gens.
---
Noed is definitely stronger then decisive because Decisive wasn’t even a guarenteed escape before the change as it just wasted time which if the survivors didn’t know what a gen was or if you caught the DS user quickly or even missed the skill check WHICH WASTES THE PERK the game isn’t lost for the killer. If I get found and loop the killer while my team finishes all the remaining gens and the only time the killer finally downs me is cause Noed I basically am dead there on the spot. Game over for me. I get put on a hook and either 1. the killer camps because I alone am the sole reason they lost the game and not because they don’t belong in red ranks or made mistakes or that the survivors are just better then them...or 2. my team have to decide with attempting to save me which will most likely end with them on a hook too or escape and save themselves.
---
I’ve made suggestions to keep Noed for the reason it’s run (we all know no one runs it for the speed boost) and in fact buff it to work like Devour hope where it earns tokens for each gen completed similar to fire up. Which not only add a difference to tiers 1-3 for Noed but make the perk viable for the entire game and not just the end game. Only direct nerf to the perk is it’s a lit totem all game. No more being 5 seperate totems and no more “or course you run Noed” moments.
---
muh slugs
---
All of her perks are designed to make her the obsession, not just two. That would ruin her theme. I do think that the obsession shouldn't change. There's no reason for the obsession to change mechanically, especially after the fact and if the killer has no obsession perks of their own. 
---
Very nice and balanced perks. What's the story behind the character?
---
The fucking absolute worst is when the killer also ran a mori and the survivors not only watch you get hardcamped and choose not to repair, but also make the decision to farm you in front of killer like 3 seconds into your struggle phase.
---
SWF breaks the System anyway (Killers gettin deranked cuz they have to fight rigged games) and Survivors who can\`t play but still win cuz of the power of third party communication. 
---
Don\`t take Rank to serious in DBD if someone wants to rank up with Legion let him if he can\`t play he will just get farmed in higher ranks if he plays anything else.
---
I mean DS was utter bullshit to be fair but survivors are just having less and less to work with, healing takes forever and every new killer is so awful to play against (spirit and legion in particular). 
---
The fact there the killer has broken add ons or a mori every game doesnt help either. All the old caming/tunneling and being facecamped for running the killer for more the ten seconds still exsist and are worse than ever. 
---
I often wonder why I get so many gg's while playing killer then I play survivor and see exactly why
---
THOT
---
Yes, this will definitely discourage tunneling, and that's good. But what are you going to do, just hook everyone once and only slug after? 
---
Even Michael Bay couldn't fuck up that reboot.
---
Laughs in blood warden
---
Special skins for prestiging when the game only had four killers and survivors on PC.
---
We need these dedicated servers pronto.
---
I had a Quinten who was being altruistic then he used delivence to get off a basement hook but wraith came back so he teabbagged and DCed, Quinten is so high because of flashlight clicking and teabagging :/
---
Absolutely. It feels good to be able to get kills with the weaker killers nowadays.
---
Yes and ranking up fast is very bad cuz who else is ranking up very fast... swf groups so you will have tons of swf games.
---
Poor Myers :(
---
(srs though why is his breathing so loud?)
---
It\`s not like you can kill people with legion even if you would try \^\^
---
It’s only a nerf if you continue to tunnel, in which case it’s a good one.
---
But with that being said, you can still tunnel and not get DS’ed even if that person has it. 
---
Id rather the game make some more extreme changes the games real problem right now is how stale its getting. 
---
RATS RATS WE ARE THE RATS 
---
Nowadays I kinda play both equally. I started as a survivor main and still am, but have nearly 3,000 sacrifices and like 11 P3 killers; so I’ve put some time in. I’m on the fence with NOED. Actually, I’m impartial on both NOED and DS. Some killers I use it with, some I don’t. Like I refuse to use it with killers that have OHKO capabilities (Myers, LF, Billy). It just looks noobish. On one hand it can be a solid last resort, especially against gen rushing SWF. It can also be pretty helpful against a altruistic SWF group. But on the other hand, especially now since all tiers are OHKO, you run into a lot of killers that suck dick the entire game and now get free hits and killers that ride the NOED train all the way into the purple/red ranks. I liked it the way it was before the buff.
---
I agree, but don’t agree with the whole “we’ll just cleanse totems then.” Well yeah — thanks for stating the obvious. But sometimes that isn’t always plausible. Sometimes you don’t have the luxury of going on treasure hunts. Like if you have someone facecamping... hard. You have like 2 minutes or so to hurry up and get gens done as fast as you can (assuming you leave the person getting camped to die). So you gen rush before the person dies and the killer goes to find the next victim. You hurry and finish all the gens and now you have a shitty facecamping killer with NOED. 
---
As for DS; I use it. I think it’s pretty ok the way it is now. Both as a survivor or killer. I don’t get too heated about it. As a killer, I work around it and more often than not, they’re right back on the ground in 15-30 seconds.
---
I use it as a survivor because I’m a super aggressive and altruistic player. I’m the one running to the killer and making noise to take aggro while my team does gens. I’m the looper, I’m the distraction. I’m the person lurking waiting for a flashlight save. I’m the person that’ll take hits. And surprise surprise... killers tunnel me. People like me are really annoying to play against lol. So I like to have my little second chance (seeing how I seldom run adrenaline). But with these changes, I doubt I’ll run it as often and probably go to Adrenaline or something as that also suits my plays style.
---

---
They are. Honestly, all I wanted to see was an end to pallet vacuum, and I'm glad that happened, but now they've nerfed flashlights into uselessness by buffing pick-up times, made sabo even more of a worthless gimmick than it already was, fixed flashlight and pallet stun "timings" before reverting them due to the resultant autistic screeching, and finally removed DS. And all the whiny killer mains are like "you don't understand, it's SO STRESSFUL(tm) being a killer when survivors are able to undertake any action to resist whatsoever".
---
Hi there!  I'm actually Frank in this. We never said it took us months, but a lot of planning did go into this.  For some of us, this was the first convention we've ever attended, or even our first time cosplaying. We also are all in college and did not have a high budget to work with. Sorry if you didnt like the way we did things, but its something we are all pretty proud of regardless, so keep rude judgement to yourself :) 
---
Being Rank 1 between the time Myers and Hag came out.
---
4man SB, SC, DS, Sabo squads who would instablind you and t-bag behind every pallet and flame you postgame and leave comments on their profile. There were a lot of games like that back then. The one that sticks out in my mind was this one game on Haddonfield, they got out by the very skin of their teeth with 4 D-strikes, and in the post game were simultaneously angry at me and bullying me for being a "shit killer", after they pulled every uncounterable trick in the book.
---
I didn't have Brutal Strength or Iron Grasp on my Myers (who I mained back then), so all I was allowed to do was take it up the ass every game.
---
But I'm not mad anymore. I got really good because of those days, and now I just get even.
---
Up to a minute. You ever leave someone slugged for a minute? They get healed back up, even with knock out.
---
Don't get me wrong, this is a good change for everyone overall, but it's definitely a nerf to Dying Light.
---
Only ten minutes? It can be much longer, friend. I had an asshole hold me hostage for **three** hours while he “took a shower and watched a movie with his bae”
---
After 30 minutes, I decided it wasn’t worth DCing. I was too far in and it was a fight for bloodpoints and to keep him from “winning.”

---
See I’m a survivor main and I hate Decisive. I understand the whole second chance thing but in the right survivors hands it’s a broken perk. A lot of bad survivors run it and will go down 20-30 seconds after hitting it. But not all survivors are bad. The problem lies within a killer catching a very good looping survivor and then they escape and the chase starts all over again which leaves a pretty sour taste in the killers mouth. If you get multiple D strike users who are capable of long chases on the same team you’re just going to have a bad time. 
---
\*LOUD WHEEZING AFTER TELEPORTING\*
---
The worst of the ranking system, ignoring the pain that is rank reset and all the super experienced players lumped together with the new ones, is the impact of wanting to try a new character. 
---
It's pretty awful being even as low as rank 10-15 and then wanting to try a new killer or survivor .... sitting there with one or two level 1 perks (with a character you don't know the playstyle of or abilities for bonus pain) against a max loadout of level 3 perks and add-ons etc is just plain not fun. 
---
It would be so much better if it took the character level into account as well, not just player level, when doing matchmaking. 
---
Oh yeah that’s facts, and I’m meg. If I wanted to be toxic I’d be nea. I never 360’d the killer only dropped a pallet and blinded. I tried to loop but it’s literally impossible to loop a clown and he was pretty experienced for the most part. That’s also why I body blocked at the end, I’m a survivor that’s pretty altruistic for the most part, and that was my way of repaying the Claudette.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/48455/upcoming-ds-changes-q-a
---
There is your answer.
---
you still need to rely on mistakes on the survivor's part, they just have less chances to recover from those mistakes. A killer can play optimally and still lose hardcore if the survivors do the same.
---
it is the survivor's game to lose against everyone but the strongest killers with the best perks.
---
could be I'm not a strong player though, I only have like 2 years under my belt, and I'm not smart enough to like playing nurse or billy.
---
If the guy is already your obsession, it doesnt change much for you. If you go on someone else after and then get DS because you tunneled an other guy, then you lose DL benefit. I’m ok with that tbh.
---
I felt attacked with the “he’s going after the least toxic survivor” bit, great video!
---
Just remember man a 3K and a hatch escape with gens up is basically a consolation prize last survivor gets for getting fucking destroyed.  If you kill 3 that's an overwhelming victory.  4k is just icing on the cake.  Killers that feel mandatoraly that they have to 4k end up having less fun playing the game and cause a lot more grief for survivors.  I try not to slug and mainly do it if it's a toxic group or if I know exactly where the last survivor is.  
---
Yeah, that shit isn't tricky 😂😂😂
---
100% a nerf to DL but hell Yeah ive left survivors slugged for a minute. That’s a minute they’re not up and moving and it requires another survivor to come pick them up (which means that’s already 2 less survivors on gens). I don’t slug often but it does somewhat allow me as the killer to take control of the game. 
---
&gt;I'll use tinkerer instead of BS because its faster for breaking pallets AND chainsawing that way
---
Tinkerer works differently now tho.
---
Idk... I mean, it’s always funny to see hillbilly/leatherface/Myers waste perk slot on noed.
---
Way back when the game first came out the grind was a lot worse than it is now, by level 25 every node in the bloodweb would be filled and it took probably half a million bloodpoints for 5 levels in later bloodwebs. In November 2016 they reduced the grind by a lot and anyone who had prestiged before the reduction would get the Legacy Prestige items up to the prestige they got. The only characters that have Legacy are Dwight, Jake, Meg, Claudette, Nea, Trapper, Hillbilly, Wraith and Nurse.
---
M&amp;A, BBQ, Ruin, Spirit Fury, Enduring, Whispers, Bamboozle, Discordance...etc take your pick.
---
Well that's a big nerf to Dying Light.
---
I’m telling the truth and if you’d rather not believe then that’s on you, but yeah I used DS and it’s only level 1 Ds so it’s not like he has to look for me again.
---
I've also been playing 2 years and easily get rank 1 every month playing Wraith and Trapper mostly lol.  No NOED or moris.  Trust me you don't need the best killers to compete anymore.  And if you're playing optimally you are causing and forcing those mistakes.  This mindset needs to go because it is very much out of date.  Chases are pretty easy now and they lost their strongest crutches.
---
There wasn't a good reason to use DL to start with thanks to multiple reasons. Having DS be a counter for an unworthy perk no one should run isn't going to effect anyone as no one should be running Dying Light to start with.
---
Unless you are going for Adept Shape, there really isn't any reason to play with DL over nearly any other perk in the game. Monstrous Shrine is likely the only Killer perk worse than Dying Light.
---
I love to mori players like this! 
---
nice ^-^
---
They are reworking him because he is fucking garbage and an ass to play against. Standing on a rock makes you not able to get hit and litteraly invincible.
---
Also the third paragraph is something straight out of r/iamverysmart, try not to sound like a 90 year old grandpa next time you twat. And shut the fuck up about critical thinking skills, you are a salty survivor thats had a few bad legion matches. You are comparing a chase lasting a long time before you colapse to being invincible.
---
that's a p2 legacy, not p3
---
it's written in the title in case you didn't notice 
---
Just don't trigger DS by tunneling unhooked survivor and your Dying Light will be fine.
---
Lmao
---
Sure
---
I agree with your point, but I think that it could have been nerfed a bit more lightly. The fact that you can only use it AFTER you've been hooked really limits its usage, and the way it was before, I missed the skill check a solid 95% of the time, so it wasn't this overpowered god perk, it was more of a last resort if nobody blocked the hook or distracted the killer long enough for me to wiggle free.
---
Was going to recall some 4 man SWF like everyone else here and then remember I play on PC....tried a few games as killer on PS4. That was the worst. Absolutely no idea how huntress would be viable passed rank 20. I know people do it and huge kudos to them! Frame rate and general playability/aim is horrendous on console. 
---
Yeah I'm doing it to, because I'm a fan of singleplayer stories and very rarely played mutliplayer games before DbD unless they had co-op, so with how much time I'm spending playing DbD now my singleplayer playtime kinda suffers. As well as personal life, ambitions etc. 
---
That makes sense.
---
BQQ and Chilli needs to be the next nerf. It really should show aura readings for people who haven't been hooked yet to flow with the whole "Hook every one once for extra blood points" After a first hook the aura reading for that person shouldn't happen.
---
Slugging for the 4k is pretty lame and boring, unless you're going for adept trophies it's not worth it... 
---
Why did you go out of your way to PM someone? 
---
I also disagree with you. If you can secure a 4k before 5 gens, so be it. 
---
When freddy and legion are both fucking broken and bhr starts to fix ds
---
I busted a nut from this. Thanks. Now I gotta go clean up. :(
---
I was facing a toxic 4 man SWF and all of the pallets were invisible and made no noise when dropped.
---
Oh yeah the game is absolutely killer-favored at this point in time. There are builds and offerings killers can do that will ENSURE a win. I went up against this Michael who had offerings that not only made him STAY in stage 3 permanently, he could also mori you without even having to hook you once. ON TOP of ruin. Like obviously no one was going to win that match.
---
I don't know of even ONE build that ensures survivor wins. (even including offerings.) ESPECIALLY since they nerfed self heal and the gear you can add on to toolboxes.
---
The devs have EXPLICITLY said while streaming that they favor killers and find making it harder for survivors an "improvement" to the game. 
---
Why? The initial killing of the obsession doesn’t change. Whether you tunnel them off hook or just straight facecamp makes no difference. The difference becomes AFTER that obsession is killed. If you knock the next person down after an unhook and get DSed, you then lose out.
---
Of course this operates under the theory that people will be using this new DS, which I doubt will happen unless it’s tweaked.
---
That's what we needed.
---
Amazing!
---
I know this has been answered, but it is literally at the top of the "Hot" section of the subreddit...
---
Seems kind of like survivor salt to me.
---
Having NOED doesn't mean you HAVE to let the gens get done (Although that's how i use it on Freddy. Some people take it as insurance for *if* the generators get done. If they can kill everyone without using it it's not wasted since it was just there as an *in case* anyway. 
---
If the killer gets a 4k by camping they've indeed won, and worst of all(From your view) the 4k is due to the survivors incompetence rather than the killers skill for the most part. The "correct" response to camping is to touch the generators and leave.  
---
I messaged them because they surrounded the hook with traps but also stood in front of the hook, which annoyed me, also whenever I play killer which is everyday people message me, but Yh I get you, but if they do that in every match I think noed is a wasted perk slot bc he would be securing 4k before the end of the match. Ngl I use noed when I play killer but I don’t camp or tunnel.
---
Sadly yes, legion is real.
---
Killer complaints? Why would ther be any killer complaints. It's a nerf to a survivor perk.
---
Legion can switch between Male and Female cosmetics easily enough in the lobby. All I'm saying is that if a Killer could do that to gain an advantage against teams of the opposite sex, or whatever is sexually attractive to the current chosen survivors in the lobby, then it'd be an interesting new dynamic. 
---
Alas, It'll probably end up saying more about modern society than intended or offend too many people, and be too much of a headache for the devs to deal with though; for all we know Jake Park might identify his gender as a male Unicorn that can get pregnant and is currently carrying Feng Min's love child... Where the actual Fuck does that place this killer concept? Although creative, and interesting, this is too sensitive a subject in all honesty for the devs to tackle, which is probably why it'll never happen. Still... It would make for an interesting dynamic where it becomes a toss of the dice as to which survivor players choose to play. Will they have an advantage this round or not? If anything it would at least do something for the survivor community to add some weight to their choice of survivor instead of doing it just because they like the different skin. 
---
I feel the survivor you choose should give you advantages and disadvantages. e.g. picking Claudette gives a natural 5% boost to healing others and herself, but has a higher chance of skill checks, or Picking meg gives you a natural 5% boost to movement speed, but a slower rate for repairing gens, etc. That way the survivor you choose is unique and conforms to your play-style. Although the devs have expressed that this is a possibility, no action has been taken for it currently, but I still hope for the day that my choice in survivor gains more meaning to the role I like to play.  
---
I'm fast. I'm very fast.
---
Trapper is the easiest shit ever. If You’ve played survivor before You know what loops are strong and which ones aren’t worth they trap. Just place a trap or two near anywhere you know survivors are likely to run and then play the game. Only a matter of time till one of those little shits vault the wrong window while running away from the sexy squeaking man you are. 
---
Honestly, just actually do one or the other. I'm sick of running over to revive a survivor who hasn't moved, and finding out that the useless dipshit hasn't bothered to recover at all.
---
Bc its common sense that if a killer camps the other 3 finish the gens, if you did this and he truly camped he should have 2k'd at best. I assume everyone came bumrushing for the hook save?
---
This is a team game without in game communication for a reason. Again, if you couldn't meet whatever condition you needed to win (Like cleansing ruin) that's a failing on the survivor players side. 
---
The time it takes for a killer to camp one person to death is 120 seconds, the time it takes for a survivor to knock out a gen is 80 seconds(yes, even through ruin if they land greats). No matter which way you look at this, you lost and the killer won. No amount of mental gymnastics are going to change that. 
---
This isn't just killer favoritism either. If all 4 survivors escaped from a killer i'd say the same thing. Survivors won, killer lost. 
---
BBQ needs to only work for people who haven't been hooked. Once that survivor is hooked and the killer has their stack, they shouldn't be able to be seen on aura reading after that tbh.
---
This post and comments are example #155362 why no one listens to survivors 
---
Dude you’re joking right. Are you rank 20 ? Is Freddy too OP for you ? Cause I can certainly tell you the game is still survivor favoured. You can finish all 5 gens before Mr Myers is even ready to infinite T3 and mori you. There aren’t any builds for either side which ensure a win. Otherwise there wouldn’t be much of a game would there? . 
---
The audacity to attack again
---
Yh when others were on the hook I was doing gens with ruin active but it was a match with randoms and they were trying to get the save 
---
I think it's fine how it is 
---
Also, looking out for the players on other platforms: killer on console would be completely unplayable, 360'ing is easy on console as is, adding a further punishment for missing would make playing killer awful 
---
Well that's no fun .... Guess I just keep not using it as normal. It's not a perk I use.
---
Happy microphone day op
---
Yh I get what u meant but I was saying to the killer that in my own way I won bc I pipped/ranked up, they were saying that death means loss
---
&gt; complaining about Discordance and Ruin 
---
omegalul
---
Somehow I honestly doubt Dwight and David get along.
---
I wouldnt bother trying to change peoples minds. Campers know its shitty they dont care
---
Ah that sucks so it wasnt your fault it was the  randoms. If i was in your situation i woulda got 2 gens done and went for the hatch play then 
---
I’m not complaining about perks...read....
---
Insert 3-4 man SWF squad story here: seriously, these guys are a plague and it's a shame that the community sees absolutely nothing wrong with using mics with SWF and how that completely breaks the game. 
---
Pretty much any game where DS let them get away. 
---
Had a bad series of matches last week as Billy. Multiple times per game I'd get the phantom chainsaw hit glitch where the chainsaw is right on their ass and the hit just doesn't count. One Nea massively lucked out and didn't get hit twice in a row, literally in a row, and the map was Haddonfield, so when the shit head finally made it to a vault I was forced to M1 him. Then the same exact thing happened with a David in the same match. Next game I get a David who suspiciously stays glued to the gen, I go for the chainsaw hit, and the glitch happens again almost like this guy knew it would happen. I had to ragequit that one. I don't like doing that but seriously, losing a tremendous advantage all because of a glitch is massive levels of bullshit. 
---
&gt; it wasn’t a swf so I couldn’t tell them to find ruin while I was on the hook
---
Good. It's fucking insane that people can use comms to give up your totem. That's one of the most broken issues in the game
---
Yh but ya know when you jest need to let out that negative energy, I wasn’t trying to change their perceptions just voice my opinion 
---
I have no clue. Maybe you got disconnected while loading in.
---
Lol. Keep your panties or babe, you're just taking what I said and creating scenarios. Clearly not EVERY killer has the same amount of ability the same way that tons of survivor teachable are fucking uuuseless. (I can't even remember the last time I saw a Quentin)
---
And in WHAT realm is someone finishing all 5 gens before Michael is even in T3 even once? PLUS you just ignored how I said 'with certain builds' and even EXPLAINED the one that was an issue. Go. On. Somewhere.
---
And you're telling me a Michael that can STAY in T3 and mori you if he catches you JUST ONCE on TOP of ruin is not a sure-fire win? Lol. Stay delusional babe. 
---
Doz eyes

I tried...oh well

If you’re implying I’m a whiny killer main I’m not. I’m a survivor main who will acknowledge that it I haven’t struggled as a survivor after any of the changes. Survivor just isn’t a stressful role.

---
Really? I’ve used DS less than 5 times in my 800 hours played, I’m gonna start using it as soon as the new nerf comes out. I think it’ll work really well to punish tunneling and overall be more fair to use. 
---
I've had a few frustrating games like this myself, there is only two left. You're trying to do a gen and get into a chase and have one of the longest chases just to find out the other survivor was camping hatch the entire time when they could have gotten a gen done ):
---
XD XD XD
---
Why the fuck though?  Did you have fun???  No wonder some survs dislike killer mains,  killers like you give us a bad rap. Idc if the surv had DS,  tbagged, and anything else you could deem toxic there is literally no point in doing this you make the game unfun for everyone else by doing things like this. 
---
Yes
---
My complaint is that NOED  is broken for the same reason. I just want it changed because it’s just as bullshit. But I’m happy about the change. 
---
Long story short .
---
For a minute After being unhooked (by other or by your own hand) if you are downed and picked up you can decisive stike and stun the killer. You become the obsession afterwards. 
---
So the change is that you can’t just save it forever and it’s now a anti tunneling perk rather then a get out of jail free card.

No one believes these schmucks who claim they use Killer but say nonsense like this. 
---
Thanks exactly what I was looking for!
---
No, it’s a reference to the explanation trailer for darkness among us 
---
If anything the game is working towards balance. As killer you still rely on survivors making mistakes to have a good game. Flashlight blinds are still very possible, and a good group of swf will win more often then they lose. Besides it's my opinion that the survivors should be scared of the killer. 
---
Glad to help.
---
Let's not forget:
---
-Hillbilly: x meters traveled purely by chainsaw 
---
-Trapper: x amount of traps placed in random locations that actually work 
---
-Wraith: x times smacked by pallets while or after uncloaking 
---
I mean if you tunnel a survivor for like 3 gens and then eat DS which you only have yourself to blame for then yeah sure but let's not go overboard.  
---
When your only way of playing killer is to tunnel and camp so you think DS will still be OP.
---
No not saying remove the timer. It should be only be like 30 seconds but the clock stops during chase or when downed. This ensures that if you are tunneled but happen to reach a pallet loop, you don’t run yourself out of the window to use the perk. The killer also can’t slug counter it, which they shouldn’t be able to because it’s supposed to be a punishment for tunneling.
---
accurate representation of how fast this boy moves 
---
Thanks !
---
3 seconds? Done. Not to mention if another survivor is there they can take a hit for you lol. The way i look at it is that it's borrowed time for yourself lol, hell imagine it paired with borrowed time. Not only will you make it to the gate but then you can t bag them because if they knock you down you can just hit that easy skill check and strike out when they try to pick you up. 
---
I said I wouldn’t response to silly stuff, so I’ve broken that promise. You can doubt it kiddo but I’m simply expressing my opinion. Either you’re just not a good killer yourself, thus you don’t have the same experiences, or you’re just here to be on the one cynical guy that no one likes. 
---
as a rank 1 survivor and killer player. I couldn't be happier. cya ds 
---
Maybe you haven’t seen a Quintin is because survivors are all just skins and it doesn’t matter which one you’re using as they all use the same perks the same way. And in the realm of red ranks where survivors know what a skill check is and know what a loop is , What rank are you? Cause I’ve been playing this game since Before huntress came out and I’ve been consistently rank 1 as survivor and red ranks as killer. Michael can stay tier 3 permanently and mori you without downing or hooking you but he needs to add TWO seperate ultra rare add ons which not only lower his speed but GREATLY increase the time it takes to reach evil within 3. There is no perk build which guarentees a win for either side. I’m not delusional as I’ve played against many tombstone Myers and survived. If you’re under the belief there are unbeatable killer builds it’s because you belong at rank 20. Lol people have literally proven the fastest a team can repair all 5 gens is something stupid like 4 minutes.
---
I did 3 totems on my own solo in a game not too long ago, and I didn't go into the game with a mindset to cleanse totems. This meme that it's infeasible is so fucking absurd
---
A totem counter on Small Game would be fine. But a part of base kit it wold be a massive nerf to hex totems that are already barely useful
---
If the killer is dumb enough to tunnel a survivor that long then yes it's their fault but if you do tunnel a survivor for 3 gens, finally get them down and then get got by decisive it's just frustrating and ruins the game for the killer. I do get what your saying though.
---
Freddy still is garbage, and Legion still has their gamebreaking *stare at the floor and follow people* mechanic.
---
Do the Developers even care?
---
Huh. That’s a pretty good idea actually. I’m on board my dude
---
I mean, have you considered that without SWF will you even know if the amount of broken totems are enough to disable it? Or do you want all survivor to start playing SWF since its the only thing that can give a hint of the correct number of totem still available... Have you considered that doing the totems meant that the killer gains ample time just by existing on the map, time wasted on totem hunting and if the map/RNG is being rather vicious some hidden totems could take a whole map run just to be found? Whats stopping a killer to face camp the whole time and during that whole session you spent on totem hunting instead of doing the gen cost you one teammate and no gens being popped? 
---
I was like wtf that’s not cool of the wraith, but lmao the way you just admitted and said you’re not sorry 😂 you’re awesome 
---
“FAIRY GOD PARENTS”
---
then no salt, muthafucka!  it's a choice to stay.  ;-)
---
Definitely. Getting to cover first has saved my butt so many times when the killer comes back and eventually leaves in frustration because they don't know where I've gone.
---
That's such a Dwight thing to say.
---
Pretty sure noed would never proc again if there was a counter. 
---
*laughs in Deerstalker*
---
Meg's gonna wake up without her skeleton. 
---
Clown is decent, his bottles/potions slow the survivor down and causes them to cough, idk how good his addons are tho, Michael is pretty good, (loads of people want shirtless Michael lmao), i would definitely go for Spirit next, she is probs one one of the best killers along with nurse, huntress is becoming more popular but is tricky to aim with at first, but def try spirit, she isnt hard but detecting survivors while phasing is a little tricky, you have to look out for the small movements in grass and stuff like that :) good luck
---
Absolutely. I bought Alert, prestiged Nea so I could get it, and it never showed up on my Bloodweb even though I got her back up to lvl. 50 again!
---
I believe it should be reduced to 30, but the clock stops during chase.
---
In your scenario, are you saying #3 is instantly unhooked with you standing there? Why wouldn’t you just knock down #3 and chase #4? It’s potentially game over if #3 doesn’t have Unbreakable. I might not be understanding it correctly though 
---
I'm a survivor main and I love this change, it's gonna be a fucking good perk against tunnelers.
---
The only thing is if they were to do this it were pretty much nerf her into the ground as the reason she is op is that she can completely ignore survivor defenses such as windows 
---
Hi! It seems like you have trouble following online conversations. Do you need help with that?
---
No im a rank 14 but every time i go against freddy i lose. I dont even know whats different but it just seems as though you can never juke against him.
---
You’ve played monopoly right ? It’s basically a get out of jail free card for survivors. 
---
Honestly, I’d like another trap killer. I thought they were going to do some cool trap killer after the blight event... but we got legion instead. 
---
As a new killer (3 weeks playing off and on) being put up against 4 legacy purposefully depipped streaming Claudettes with utility flashlights,  filaments,  and battery. 
---
Never have I ever been so frustrated.  Chain blinds,  body blocks to the hook,  4 ds's all when the gates were open and I managed to catch one of the smug bastards.  Thirty minutes of them holding the game hostage and refusing to leave. 
---
I'm ashamed to say the next game I took NOED and a mori and proxy camped the poor survivors into oblivion.  Not my finest moment. 
---
he's easier to juke than almost any killer. you're mind gaming yourself 
---
I remember those days. Flashlights were insanely OP back then. It's funny how substantial the -still fairly recent- changes have been and yet the game still has terrible balance and if you point this out you're told how terrible you are as a Killer and Killer is too easy to use and needs nerfs. 
---
And this helps killers because it means the survivors are spending time doing something to counter a perk you don’t even have.
---
The entire point is get survivors to do something else besides gens during the game. What is the issue if a counter helps push them to do it?
---
#RRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
---
I don’ t think you’re supposed to play the animation for vaulting at all when shocked by the doc. The animation for that action would instead cancel and go into you screaming from the shock. 
---
When I first started playing, the Nurse really interested me so I decided I'd do a couple games of her. Unfortunately I was playing on my brother's account, and at the time he was like... Idk what rank but certainly better than rank 10 at least. Again, first game as Nurse, first game as killer, going against people who were good enough to rank up but not quite good enough to actually be high rank. To say it was a toxic experience falls a little short.
---
okay, seems like you are less likely are open to have a conversation regarding this issue since you skimmed many of the issue presented as well as giving false equivalence toward doing an objective set toward escaping a killer, and cleansing a totem that does nothing unless the killer equips a certain perk which is bonkers tbh... I have no qualms with DS being gone, but acting like NOED isnt a crutch coz its counter-able even though its an RNG based perk that rewards the killer for not being able to apply pressure up till the endgame... I can totally see where you stand on this discussion tbh... so i bid you adieu.. 
---
This also happens when a trapper tries to pick you up out of a trap while on stairs.
---
My worst (so far lmao) was when i was spirit, i hooked a david at the beginning of the match, he dc'd then his two friends dc'd and i let the other person do two gens and get the hatch. But i've had worse matches, even tho it was a 4k, three of them were swf, and extremely toxic and clearly de rankers (i was rank 12/13 at the time), still playing as spirit, they were teabagging, all had flashlights, and it was just a horrible match, but felt rewarding that i got a 4k against 3 derankers and toxic players
---
You could get her 50 and then prestige.
---
Other methods are highly bannable
---
You could always Prestige her if you haven’t already. 
---
I main survivor and only play killer when I need a stress relief quick 4K, I just play nurse/spirit/billy every 3 or 4 survivors games to destress. Killer is easy as pie. 
---
Hopefully tunneling rates drop 
---
Cleansing all the totems is the single worst way of countering NoED.
---
Takes too long, and missing a single one means it's meaningless.
---
* Find the actual lit totem in the endgame if you need to.
---
* Abandon somebody if they get downed with NoED unless the totem gets found. Losing one is better than losing all.
---
* Just don't get hit in the first place. Unless it's Nurse, you don't have any pallets left, or you don't have an exhaustion perk, this is pretty easy if you've got looping down.
---
&gt;glad to see shitters like you go
---
&gt;down voted for speaking the truth
---
You fucking goon. 
---
I never understood people who think nurse is OP. I don’t mind even going against red rank nurses. I respect them because playing Nurse requires actual skill. Now doctor on the other hand can die. Anyone can get wreck a team with doctor’s stupid power. 
---
It does! You can tell from the killer stun points on the left of your screen.
---
It happens a lot. The timing has always been funky 
---
You’ll never catch me Claudette, not when I shift into M A X I M U M  S A L T
---
*noed intensifies*
---
I'm a solo survivor myself, i usually get 4 totems and get cucked by NOED since my teammates are hot garbage and 3 of em can't get 1 totem (and i didn't have enough time to get the last one since i need to do everything else too...)
---
Just spend more BP? I don’t understand posts like this. Perks are all RNG. You will get it... just not when you want. 
---
BBQ is like the last perk I get to rank 3 every time. Same with WGLF. 
---
Who cares about NOED? Did I mention NOED??? 
---
Survivor here. I would only consider it camping if you were purposefully staying near the hook to chase away survivors that tried to save their teammate. If the killer is chasing other survivors and they lead the killer toward the hooked person, or if all the other survivors are already in the same area as the hook (which is what it sounds like you're saying), then no, it's not camping to stop the save, and survivors have no business messaging you to complain about it.
---
This game is why I've had to turn messages off on PS4. I always try to be positive and send people messages only to either tell them gg if they really did a particularly awesome job (whether survivor or killer) or to apologize to teammates for a game glitch (game refusing to give me unhook prompt, HUD disappearing so I can't repair gens, etc). But I cannot even begin to describe how many times killers have sent me group messages after a session (sometimes even an hour later) bragging about how easy we were to kill, or other survivors telling me to go kill myself because I didn't unhook them when the killer was face camping them or body-blocking the entrance to the basement, etc. 
---
1500h survivor Main, had DS equipped once or twice. There was always better options out there. Lol
---
It already has been nerfed, twice. At the start it wasn't a hex, it was just permanent. Then it was a 2 minute timer after the last gen. Now it's a hex and people are STILL complaining that it can't be countered. BHVR already gave us a way to counter it, and people say it can't be countered.
---
Also, what kind of jukes are you speaking of? If you are talking about 360s I’m not surprised because they rarely ever work anymore.
---
Yeah I’ve noticed that too. Kinda sucks that the one anti-looping aspect of his power is really inconsistent. 
---
I can relate to that problem. One chainsaw glitch like that can lose the whole game vs good teams. Lets hope they fix it soon.
---
All the P3 Quentins are at rank 1
---
Fuck up the game as in you don't get a 4K? Or the killer escapes at the end of the game? I can't take these complaints seriously when all a killer has to do is play nurse/billy/spirit to get a 4K or 3K hatch game.
---
Just spend more BP...what do you think I've been doing haha 
---
I once had a decnt match, and decided to give hatch to the last survivor. The very next game i played against that survivor again only to get t-bagged by him. 
---
I haven't seen any complaints 
---
Well yeah, it’s clearly gonna take more than 300k if you don’t have other perks unlocked. 
---
Billy and Kate
---
Hag and Kate
---
Ace and my main man myers
---
They have to be injured.  Flashlight saves, pallet saves, and safe unhooks all count too.
---
back when instablind was still a thing. i had a hag daily and almost never played hag before, one perk only and i dont even remember which one it was.
---
4 man swf, all instablinds.
---
i think i don't need to describe it but it was painful.
---
that was the day when i understood how op survivor is.
---
If you guess where he is right, you can pallet stun him while awake.
---
Right, they were injured, i still didnt get the stack tho idk what im doing wrong
---
i read that as an "Ok game"
---
Tl;Dr for people: "I can't tunnel as hard now"
---
Your opinion is absolute dog shit. And people like you always preface their shit opinion with "I main Killer" or "I main Survivor and Killer" and yet you have absolute shit opinions that make no sense to anyone who actually plays Killer. So bottom line is either you're lying that you use Killer or you hide in the low ranks and occasionally use Killer (mainly for dailies) and think there's no issue. 
---
Because the survivor's dream transition time is 7 seconds, more than enough time to find a pallet or window, it's super easy to wake up, either find an awake survivor or fail a skill check, and Freddy has nothing to help in the chase. That's why he's so weak.
---
The fact that they missed the attack *is* punishment.
---
I only play killer for daily rituals. The first time I played killer, I was using the Wraith and swung at a survivor who was literally standing right in front of me, and came up short. I was so embarassed at having missed such a basic attack that I stopped and just walked backwards away from them in shame. Luckily they were also Rank 20 like me and didn't t-bag the shit out of me. Trust me, the embarrassment was punishment enough!
---
Killer has always been strong at low ranks, that's not a good argument for balance.
---
 I thought the Doc's shock prevents you from starting an action for a few seconds. I don't think its supposed to cancel a vault when the trigger has already been activated.
---
The hitboxes are so inconsistent, when you absolutely NEED to live the hitbox is like 10,000 ft from the window but when you don’t give a shit the killer literally sticks their weapon up your ass and you’re perfectly healthy. I jUst..
---
man that new operator is SEXY as all hell
---
We're getting there, but still not quite.
---
* Sprint Burst makes sneak attacks impossible, invalidating Wraith, Pig, Freddy, and Myers to an extent. Similarly, it's nearly impossible to be out of position if you have SB.
---
* Lots of individual killers are just weak (even if killers in general were strong, Trapper would suck in his current state).
---
* Gens get done too quickly. The game is over by the time you've done three short chases unless you get a good Ruin spawn or you're Nurse.
---
Survivors have descended from God status, but they're still too powerful.
---
Granted this is only really with higher level SWF, but honestly balancing for anything other than that feels like a cop out.
---
Im on ps4 idk if it makes a difference but when i play against freddy he usually hits everyone even when his blades dont touch them
---
Chases are really inconsistent sometimes, that’s why lithe, albeit a cool perk, is awful because a killer can look away for one second and BAM chase is ended you’re safe gg ez.
---
It just seems like its only freddy. Oh and michael aswell but those are the only 2
---
Did they feel anger? Hate?
---
Gave me strong af hollowknight vibes
---
If only! It would be great to have him :(
---
They work against wraith, trapper, billy, etc. But michael and freddy they never really do. My map knowledge is kind of shit so i can never correctly find windows so i kind of rely on 360s tbh
---
You want survivors doing *different* things. Not merely *not gens*. There is a very important difference there. 
---
And if they're all super immersed doing nothing but cleansing totems, which takes fuck all time, your ability to find them is going to be essentially nil during that process and once the 5 totems are gone it's going to be like the beginning of the match again except this time you have no totems
---
I don't think you understand how it is a counter.  Adrenaline heals you (most of the time to full) and gives you a speed boost for 5 seconds) and NOED allows you to down healthy survivors in one hit while also giving you a slight speed boost...
---
I like PWYF, Ruin, Thrill, and BBQ for Jumpscare Myers.
---
Seeing as downing any survivor that you already hooked could now lead to a DS is say it will
---
shes p3
---
All the urban evasion players disliking your comment lol
---
It does do that when you shock them before they attempt the vault. However there have been moments where just before the animation for vaulting played and they were shocked, the animation instead cancels and goes to them screaming from madness. 
---
There's generally more of a priority to fix stuff perceived as overpowered or unfun than what is underpowered. That's not an excuse for how long Freddy has been trash for though.
---
I never even tried it because i thought both sides were invulverable when dreamworld isnt active
---
I’m fine with that lol
---
Ok well that is why you aren’t doing well against Freddy. May I ask what rank you are at? I can assure you that 360s don’t work anywhere above yellow ranks.
---
As a guy whos played swf and soloqueue in rank 1, i can confirm in soloqueue no one gives a shit about you, no one runs borrowed time and as soon as the exit gates are open its every man for himself. Swf people actually try to save and work together which is why everyone does it, because soloqueue against high rank killers is extremely counterproductive
---
Predator. That's who I want. It'd be amazing 
---
You did run into it at first tbf 😂
---
Im rank 14 and usually they work well :/ 
---
Shh 😅
---
omg yes!
---
Wait so you are saying the guy trying to unhook gets grabbed and then uses DS? He wouldn’t be able to.
---
Then you could family share your steam games and play on a new account or use a few hacking software
---
His lunge seems longer than most, but i actually remember someone telling me freddy is shorter therefore is seems like its longer because perspective or something
---
Agreed. This game is still not perfect and it has issues for both sides but it certainly improved a lot. It's amusing to see people claim that killers are op now simply because a strong survivor perk got reworked. Not even nerfed. And if noed gets reworked(it won't, the devs already said they aren't changing it but let's say they do) , I have a feeling that this will be a recurring theme
---
I was a bit panicked at first ahaha, figured I wouldn't be able to leave, but once I ran back towards the exit it let me out (: 
---
Yellow ranks, called it. Watch any gameplay on YouTube of purple or red ranks and it never works. And don’t watch juke montages cuz they are all done at yellow and brown ranks.
---
Don’t mind me y’all, just sealing off this R20 leak real quick
---
Wow, pretty amazing, fits better with DBD more than with Apex xD
---
Good killers aren't the ones complaining. They can still 4K at rank 1. It's more so a SWF issue, not a survivor-sided game issue. The heirarchy order goes SWF &gt; Good killers &gt; Solo queue Survivors &gt; Bad Killers. All the Devs are doing is helping but the Bad Killers.
---
It's weird how this happens.
---
My opinion: Each player has different reasons to play dead by daylight. Some prefer to survive at all costs, some prefer to get gens done, some prefer to make the killer mad, some prefer to loop the killer to perfection, some prefer altruism, and most find some mix of all of the play styles. Bragging about not being dead may not mean anything to the people you argue with because that is not what is important to them. They probably take contention with your perks because it doesn't fit with their play style either. 
---
Can I join?
---
but why?
---
Am I the only one who gets a warm, happy rush through my body when i see the killer is bubba
---
They """""tried"""" to fix it maybe two-three months ago. And now you have Survivors bitching about how easy it is to use Billy now. Meanwhile shit like that happens to me and I'm like "WTF man!?" 
---
Sad thing is that I have a feeling that it might be an exploit. Because it specifically happened on David's and Nea's. Either that or some weird lag switch bullshit happened. 
---
The 4 of you are doing God’s work 
---
Looks more like a highlight of why P2P is stupid for a game like this than a hit box issue. Likely that on the killers screen you were closer to the window. 
---
afaik all killer lunges are roughly equal. Hit boxes are a bit buggy though in this patch so it might be that.
---
7 seconds...
---
The Legion is still very “overpowered and unfun” considering the exploit of following survivors to their death by not looking at them.
---
And Freddy is just blatantly both not fun and easy to fight against. But hey, let’s bring DbD to the Nintendo Switch!
---
It was back when the Clown came out. I was a rank 15 killer playing Freddy, so I didn’t have to worry about toxic survivors or getting gen rushed. I spawn in and I spawn right next to a poor Feng Min. I sleep her and I chase her. She goes down and as soon as I hook her, 3 different gens pop. *i am so fucked*. I find a P3 Dwight who loops me for a solid 2 minutes before I down him, and whaddya know the last 2 gens pop and I only have 2 hooks. They open the gates and rush the hook to rescue the Dwight. They all get out while teabagging and clicking their flashlights. The Dwight and his SWF buddy message me with the typical “GGEZ baby killer camping and tunneling shitlord” and I just wasn’t having it. I blocked them and moved on. I wanted to punch a hole in my wall to say the least. 
---
Can someone explain the change? I couldn't play for the past week and know nothing of it. 
---
(sort of kind of related but not really, but I want this as a legion cosmetic](https://thehelplessdancer.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/devo1.jpg)
---
when this game breaks amazing things can happen
---
Freddy and Quintin. I like Quintin’s perks and Freddy is fun as hell. 
---
Please nerf Fire Up. 
---
Lunge is literally just a .3 second movement speed burst of 150% from the killer. Thus Freddy's lunge is the same as most other killers(Trapper,  Clown, Pig, etc).
---
Getting to rank 1 as survivors is a piece of cake. You don't even need perks to do it. So its not a matter of needing DS to rank up.
---
I've said this in previous threads (to my own detriment), but this is a terrible idea.
---
The only use for a "totem counter" is making sure a single perk cannot be used.  Maybe it would make sense if NOED was baseline, but it's not, and it never will be.
---
Knowing whether or not NOED is possible isn't something you should know for free.  The only survivors who should be confident NOED is neutralized are the ones who saw all 5 totems destruction with their own eyes.
---
Now we need a Michael Myers and Mute crossover. 
---
how to nerf it? remove it from being a perk. if gens are done and there is still a totem around, survivors get the exposed effect until all totems are broken. gives another objective and nerfs noed, because people NEED to do totems now.
---
even stops gen rush.
---
Only been like 2 years since this has been a glitch. Still not fixed and likely never will be.
---
^
---
a 360 style juke basically works exactly one time. After you know the survivor is prone to do them you just rotate your camera as you swing and it connects. 
---
for what shady reason?
---
I got a stack for taking a hit while trying to bodyblock while someone was being carried to the hook. And unhooking and then taking the hit while they ran away = two stacks right there. 
---
If she breathes 
---
*inhales*
---
SHES A THOT
---
obviously hillbilly ;)
---
Why would you want to do that? Just curious. 
---
As a survivor main, i like the change. Survivors need more tunneling and camping counters. This rework, although, kind of a buff to most killers and their perks(according to TydeTyme, which i kind of agree with), is a step in the right direction. But then again i dont care because i never used DS in the first place. There are more useful perks to be using.
---
I know how the hook works dude
---
Yeah but i felt like she was a neccesary evil back when killers werent very good and she was the only one that kinda saw success. With all the buffs to killers and incredible perks that have come out she hasnt aged very well and is still at the full power she was at since release which was incredibly powerful back then and has only gotten more strong. I mean name me and other killer that can go from ground to 2nd story of the house on haddonfield in 2 seconds? Thats just way too strong. I understand you can use that against her but in the hands of a skilled nurse thats just not possible. I feel like my rework would put in her line with the other killers. She still has mobility and the ability to ignore pallets and fight loops but not insane to where shes flying up and down buildings because why not. I think its insane 2 years after release she has not seen a single nerf and was actually buffed. Also that fact that 2 years later you cannot pallet stun her mid TP but still get the stun points is idiotic.
---
pleeeease! haha i love it
---
Would have been better to photoshop survivor faces on top of them. 
---
I thought they said the Freddy rework was coming in the next couple months? Oh well let’s just hope they don’t wait over a year to rework Legion. 
---
It's not a bad thing.  It just shouldn't be something everyone knows for free.
---
You're horrible.
---
It’s great for huntress and doctor, and can be useful if you’re running BBQ, but even then it’s a bit of a stretch. It’s decent at best. 
---
Triggered survivors LULW. Git gud
---
That's true.
---
Honestly it's still pretty handy, just not a ubiquitous catch all.  Prevents tunneling and works with Deliverance builds. Strong, but specific, like most other perks. 
---
*laughs in darn*
---
Removing phase sounds in chase was huge
---
Gotcha. I know somethings up but im not sure what
---
Wow there are people who think it's actually stronger now, what.
---
Yea I think they should make it so that eveytime a killer misses a broken pallet comes back up and can be used again, and the killer gets stunned and blinded for 10 seconds.
---
well i now play on ps and have meg p1 lvl 25 and i like levelling up  
---
Pffffff salty survivors LULW
---
Tbh there is a ton of wall hacks, it’s just that they’re all a part of the game.
---
Yeah if you ever move to pc you’ll learn that real quick.
---
Again I'd argue Intermediate.
---
Well, i guess to me it's not that simple. If the person who is out looking for the totem can't hit great checks and causes explosions when trying, their time might be best spent looking for the totem.
---
Also no matter how many gens you solo do you haven't earned the **right** to anything. Your head-cannon rule book is not law. 
---
I care if the team wins but I also want points for my efforts, I have multiple drives and while each match is not going to be the same I have the luck of getting so many matches in a row where I get tunneled for no reason being swf or not swf.
---
Also how am I wrong in the first part because I said being tunneled helps 3 people not being tunneled in the average team, not everyone is a god runner that can 360 a killer into oblivion. I want points, as selfish as that seems I could argue that the killer is being selfish as well, but I won’t. 
---
Also to recap, I have multiple drives trying to escape but to also get points. Personally I don’t care if I die and my team escapes if I get a decent amount of points then I’m fine. I also don’t like how it seems you are directing the selfishness mentality to me despite not knowing me. Sure you can say you meant to talk about survivors as a whole but DONT point your finger at me okay? I don’t mind if killers get a 4 kill game at the expense of my team being bad I realize when things are in us but when you get tunneled or what have you back-to-back then it’s annoying regardless. 
---
But in your last part if you can call me out by what you believe I am, then you shouldn’t use tunneling tactics(if you do). What motivates you if you play killer? Points for the blood wed perhaps? Maybe a 4K?
---
Awesome comment I completely agree with you. I would say that the way each of these killers develop a unique gameplay is why I say that killers like hillbilly/spirit/huntress (NOT nurse) are where all killers should be. They make it extremely tough on the survivors in different ways but it's not absolutely impossible to escape. 
---
&gt;you can just down the unhooker
---
It still applies with Bt, just go after the unhooker.
---
How about you play killer then if you know all the rules to how a killer should play
---
If the killer hadn't been so focused on the unhooked person, they would've gotten at least one more kill, since the one that was unhooked was staying so far back. Instead they tunneled and lost both.
---
They don't
---
Honestly, putting on ds felt like a waste of a perk slot since it can only be used once. After that it, it's useless
---
I dont need it and most killers drop you once to interrupt it (love how devs know this and don't do shit or care and told the community to not report it, like it's all fine and dandy) 
---
The first time I ever played the nurse was at rank 5 against a full on sweaty tryhard SwF team, it was humiliating, and they wouldn’t leave, taking the game hostage after gens were done because I couldn’t hit them at all, and they felt good about it.
---
Thankfully this was 3 months ago and now I use the nurse to make SwF literally want to uninstall.
---
I’m on ps4 by the way.
---
Im hoping to be building one soon. Is the community fairly large on pc anyway? It definitely isnt on console
---
Why do you think so Gaming\_TURTLEZz?
---
I love these survivors who argue that nurse is balanced. Give me more time to get 4K's every game before they nerf :)
---
Legacy is what it is, it was available for old school players who played at release. I have no idea why you are posting this now, legacy hasnt been available for 2 years or so now. 
---
No. Should be tied to a perk like how it is with Thrill of the Hunt.
---
Gen rush is real but I find Overcharge Tier 3 is a better perk for gen control. I would run Surveillance or Discordance if I had them too. Hex perks are risky.
---
That's fair, on top of not giving the totem info I think they should also remove heartbeat/red stain so that survivors don't have the information as to where the killer is, they should remove remaining gen count on bottom left, remove progress bars on gens, and not let survivors see the health states of other survivors or their auras while injured. Just giving this information to survivors would defeat the purpose, whatever that means.
---
Less information for the survivors is what this game is built around, so why do survivors have any information given to them at all? It must be because the devs choose which information is given, and I think they should choose to show survivors the number of totems left if they actually expect a solo survivor to be able to counter NOED.
---
The change isn't live yet, it's going onto the next PTB where it will hopefully die a painful death. But with the change DS no longer makes you the Obsession from the start of the match and it is no longer useable from the start. DS activates for 60 seconds after you've been unhooked or escaped the hook. If you're downed and picked up during that time the DS skill check (which is now easier) will proc during the pick-up animation, preventing dribbling (which wouldn't happen anyway as, not being an auto Obsession, the Killer doesn't know if you even have DS), and allowing an instant escape with a 3 second stun. Using DS then makes you the Obsession, even if someone else already was. If the Killer doesn't pick you up during the 60 second activation window you'll never get to use the perk.
---
So why would you do that 
---
They haven’t earned anything but they sure as hell deserve more than the dude who didn’t even touch a gen past the first skillcheck. 
---
Matches would last longer if there was a counter, isn’t that what everyone wants anyways? 
---
Don't listen to idiots blaming your internet. This is about the engine performance and nothing to do with your bandwidth. You should do the same, leave the game to rot.
---
Yeah i think like 50k consistent players?
---
Not on this page bud
---
Damn. We have a total of like 100.
---
Yes what is wrong with you
---
Skillwise? Meg. I like to use her sprint boost when I'm being chased. She was easier for me to learn than Claudette. As for the killer, I'd have to say The Doctor, because it's useless hiding when I can see people screaming every couple of seconds and failing to juke me.
---
Now, as for character, that's a different story. Jeff is probably my favorite, as he had an interaction with the Legion before they were officially edgy teens, and he's got a badass beard and does art. For the killer, it's a tie between The Pig and The Spirit. I'm a huge fan of the Saw Franchise, but I also love that long-haired Japanese ghost girl trope from films like The Ring and The Grudge. 
---
Until they start bringing Mories, or start tunneling you *just* to get DSed so they can restore their PWYF/STBFL Obsession and get stacks again.
---
This change is absolute trash.
---
It wouldn’t hurt at all and would help in pushing solo up to the level of SWF which is very important in actual game balance as balancing the game around the current swf merely screws solo players over even more. 
---
Itd be nice if they worked on something different....
---
What is this the third or fourth DS rework?
---
It would be nice if at the very least we were informed if we were facing an SWF squad or not and how many there are in the squad. That way you know it's time to use the Mori's or just jump to top tier. 
---
I'd still use other Killers but at least then I'd know when I can have a chill game with Freddy or not. 
---
I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school.
---
But I mean, SWF already know it for free so why not just add a counter? Certainly couldn’t hurt. 
---
Legacy was meant for folks who played in the early days and put a lot of time and energy into the game.  You did one of those.  Now, subjectively, you may have put a lot of time and energy in, but apparently the devs only wanted to reward those who dumped a huge amount in.  Similar to how f13s savini skin was made available to those who had faith in them (not that most of us ever will again, lol) to back them early on, before there was a lot to see about the game.  If it was available for everyone, it's not much of a thank you gift anymore, it just becomes a last-minute hallmark card. 
---
Dont think I don't understand where you're coming from, I've missed tons of things like that (especially since I tend to wait til something is at least 50% of its launch price before I get it).  It sucks in a way, but no matter how cool a thing I think it is, I'd rather not have it than make it meaningless for the folks who had faith/put in the work to get them when they were around. 
---
Also, your logic has a massive fallacy - "Only goal would be to prestige the characters as many times as possible to unlock the skins then when the event is up never do another one again you'll see so many people..." 
---
See, they did that once, and here you are asking for a second round.  So say they do your idea... 2years from now, there's going to be someone much like you, asking for the same thing again... and BHVR will have even less grounds to deny it, because they already caved once.  Eventually, we'll just have an event in some dead part of the year, EVERY year, called the "Legacy make-up party", and noone will care any more, because the only value legacy really had was sentimental, and even thst will be gone then. 
---
LMAO. NOED is already weak. Already counterable. Just Git Gud.
---
Imagine thinking doing gens is gen rushing. And NOED does not spice the game up it only fucks you over if you are unlucky and play solo. NOED is a reason to only play SWF which reddit killers so fucking love to hate on. Saying NOED spices up the game is a bad excuse for wanting easy kills. If anything NOED should be then built into the game so everyone know you have to cleanse totems, maybe then solo players will do it and not fuck others over. 
---
He looks so funny I don't mind him camping me tbh
---
Because I want to customize the hook
---
*darn*
---
NOED's been nerfed twice. Stop being a shitty Survivor and it won't matter.
---
This is beyond science. 
---
It looks like the spirit got gender swapped in the second image ...
---
I think it's a good change in any case, I just wish they'd change Dying Light too.
---
Wands and wings, floaty crowny things.
---
I must ask, why not just add it to the base kit? The majority of the survivor population already has access to it so why not just give it to everyone. It would help in pushing solo and SWF to the same level which is something people have been wanting for ages.
---
I'm not nearly as good as that person down below (A novice huntress killer), but I do like using those addons that add status effects to the hatchets... 
---
Have you leveled up all your characters? I mean there’s a lot to choose from and play, and to get all the perks to tier 3 is a pretty big challenge, I would think. 
---
Does small game trigger for broken totems? If I break 4 totems and another survivor breaks the fifth, will Small Game help me find that broken totem so I can verify they are all broken?
---
If it doesn't, am I really expected to scour an entire map for a broken totem to ensure I don't get hit by NOED?
---
No thanks I prefer it be base for everyone
---
It would hurt new players far too much. 
---
ITS YOUR BIRTHDAY TODAY
---
Never said it was but enjoy the free karma I guess
---
I wouldn’t be against them trying it in a PTB
---
They they try to heal you which used to use up my sprint burst to just get away from them since the killer was right there. So I end up not having a way to get away from killer. 
---
I think the worst I've ever seen was when they were around the corner when I was hooked and sat at my feet all through my first phase. No tr at all, someone else was taking hits well away from us. Like did they think they had to wait for me to go into struggle before they can unhook? 
---
We just saw you again! Nice 
---
Implying DS was even ever a useful perk for rank 20s who at best immediately went back down after using it, or at worst never even hit their DS.
---
Community happy? This is the first time I'm seeing anyone complain about not having legacy then again I dont go into every single post. I feel like it would be completely unfair to the people who earned them rightfully back then to release them for everyone to buy/earn now. I do think though that the current prestige skins are really shit but hey I dont even prestige for the skins I do it for my ocd lol. Now what would really make the community happy is a bug free balanced game.
---
So as I said in the post;
---
I'm asking for this change because I don't think the counter play for NOED really exists in solo queue games. The only way to ensure it doesn't activate is to find and cleanse all 5 totems on the map, which is far too difficult and time consuming for a normal game of DBD. Finding the NOED totem after it activates is also a possibility, but it feels bad having to run around the map looking for a newly lit totem just to ensure the killer won't NOED me.
---
You're right that that is how you counter them, I just think its an unrealistic expectation for a solo survivor to do that against a competent killer
---
You just described the very issue everyone has with hitboxes... 
---
The fact that the killer doesn’t actually need to make contact with survivors due to how hitboxes work is a relatively major issue. 
---
When it comes to hatchets, their hitbox is a sphere (which makes no sense but I mean, oh well) and survivor hitboxes are cylinders (also doesn’t make much sense) so you see some bullshit stuff going on. 
---
Oh boy, I can't wait to trim my 3 viable builds down to 2.
---
It’s the good ol toxic survivor PTSD, can’t taunt me if ya don’t survive lol
---
Pyro was my favorite, but I mained pyro, so I'm biased.
---
Nope, something this stupid happens to me I’m out as well.
---
With SWF, you know where the killer is at all times, so why not just make it so the killer's aura is forever visible?
---
You forgot the part where he drops shack pallet on the way out
---
Agreed. The few times I used it I hated it because I don't like to tunnel.
---
k
---
Just prestiged with Laurie, and I bought the Halloween dlc to get ds, goddamnit 
---
Yeah, you got fucked right into your behind
---
but thats bannable 
---
I’m a killer main and have played quite a bit of Legion. I never played the tunnelling strat so, in my experience, he turns out to be fucking garbage. I never saw what the fuss about him being broken was about, he seemed to gain momentum so slowly that he just sucked.
---
Recently I’ve played a lot of survivor and came across a Legion that tunnelled and holy. Fucking. Shit. I can see the how the complaints are justified. It was so incredibly boring running from him about three times only to bleed out.
---
As a killer main, Legion sucks balls. As a survivor, Legion sucks balls to play against.
---
Decisive Strike: It's a Laurie perk that allows you to escape the killer grasp if you suceed a skill check and stun them for a few seconds. If you are the obssesion it activates inmediately and if you're not it activates after 45/40/35% of the wiggle meter is full. People complained because it disrupts the flow of the game for killers as it punishes them for catching survivors and in higher ranks can be the difference between all survivors escaping or not, especially when used along with flashlights. Because of all of this this, it will be reworked on the next update: [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/48381/decisive-strike-upcoming-changes](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/48381/decisive-strike-upcoming-changes)
---
LOL "I'm 24" then proceeds to show how immature you are....Stay angry, nerd
---
Hell no, that would be annoying af. Well, that's the thing about totems, you have to look for them, otherwise they may as well just out an altar with all five of them grouped together in the middle or the map.
---
You can do that or you can escape. You having difficulty in working with randoms is the point of the game.
---
I mean, hey, that is how DS works now lol. You don't know if they have it. (Though dribbling no longer does anything since the skill check happens during the pick up animation.)
---
I actually like deliverance more, as I feel like it's an easier escape in most circumstances, but of course you need to unhook someone first
---
Time to become a default dwight
---
Im sorry little one
---
LMAO, I'm fucking dying right now. This is the best comedy I've seen in aaaaaaaages. Now, I'm pretty sure it's a troll post, bait if you will, but I'm going to bite anyway.
---
&gt;Oh yeah the game is absolutely killer-favored at this point in time.
---
This is how you identity an Entitled Survivor Main™ easily. They refer to the mist balanced state the game has ever been in as "Killer-favored." LMAO.
---
&gt;I went up against this Michael who had offerings that not only made him STAY in stage 3 permanently, he could also mori you without even having to hook you once. ON TOP of ruin. Like obviously no one was going to win that match.
---
First, those are add-ons, not offerings. Fragrant Tuft of Hair and Judith's Tombstone. It's the Evil Incarnate build, ab achievement specific build, and an absolute utter bitch to accomplish. That's as far from a "guaranteed win" as you can possibly get in this game.
---
Both of those add-ons increase the stalk requirement to reach Evil Within 3.  You need to fully stalk 2 players and get some from the 3rd to even proc EW3 to use the build. On top of that, Judith's Tombstone slows the Killer. Myers is already 105% in EW1 normally. With Judith's he walks slower than a snail. Getting to EW3 before 4 gens are done, even with Ruin, is nigh impossible. 
---
The build is shit and far more likely to end with 0 kills than not. No one uses it outside of achievement hunting.
---
The only crutches that survivors currently have would be d strike and adrenaline. I suppose you could make a case against BT as well but I would disagree. This would mean they would not have to sacrifice anything of importance to bring the perk in. 
---
You would have a strong argument if the majority of the survivor population didn’t already have access to a free totem counter. All that happens from not adding one would be solo players being at yet another disadvantage to SWF, which is like to believe everyone agrees should not be the case. 
---
Adding a totem counter would benefit the killer regardless of where they had noed or not. Survivors would spend more time in match searching for totems and not doing gens which is something that people have been wanting for a long long while. 
---
There really isn’t any way in which adding a totem counter would hurt the killer side, if anything it may be more of a buff to them than survivors.
---
Dropping a medkit of any rarity in front of the killer 
---
That's a legit quit!
---
Diary of a Wimpy Killer. 
---
Meg and trapper. I’m pretty boring, super fast vs. super slow. 
---
I get the feeling that you don't play Killer often, if at all. Maybe play a little bit more before calling for them to change the game, yeah?
---
I feel this very much. 
---
Let's say an average game for Dwight is a whopping 15 minutes, and he takes the standard 30 minutes to deliver pizza. If he delivers pizza irl that's 37x30..1,110 minutes spent delivering pizza while in lockers (This is the only current way because delivery isn't possible irl). Now we have 11439 unaccounted for minutes in lockers. Each generator takes 80 seconds to solo repair, or 1.33 minutes. We assume the stat refers to equivalency so these Gen's are just accumulated rather than worked on start to finish. So 210.66666666 minutes is spent repairing generators, if we assume Dwight is being careful and hid in a locker with an exchange rate of 3 minutes spent in locker for every 1 minute of repair which is conservative for a Dwight main... That's 632 minutes spent hiding between Gen repairs. Now we have 10807 unaccounted for minutes. However he's rank 1, since Dwight is a smart boi he won't encounter any killers often, which means the killer will usually disconnect or give up and let him escape. If we assume each match is on average 15 minutes and killers will spend 30 minutes before giving up looking for him, that would mean this Dwight has played over 360 games. Most likely closer to 400 games just because he has to move between lockers. If these locker stand offs happen 1/5th of the time, he has played 2,000+ games in the month (I assume stats reset every 13th too). If each game is avg 30 minutes long (probably less), that's 60,000 minutes. That makes 41.666666666 days of playing. Since there will be 15 minute games too, we'll take the average of the ceiling and floor so 15x2000 = 30,000 mins or 20.833333333 days. (20.83 + 41.66) / 2.... 31.249966666 days. Our Dwight main plays every day during 
---
I agree, there are likely some ways in which it could be negative for the game but I just can’t seem to think of any so seeing it in action would be nice.
---
Ok, look at NOED like this:
---
Its mere existence slows down the game.
---
If you are worried the killer might have it, you go around cleansing totems to be sure you won't get NOED'd attack the end. This buys the killer time, which a lot of them need.
---
If you don't care if the killer has it, you get gens done really fast in exchange for a very risky endgame. 
---
The game isn't over until you leave. Stop pretending that completing 5 gens gets you a free exit pass.
---
Aren´t we all gay for Daddy Myers ?
---
Fake hooks would be way too painful, honestly. A fake generator, unless you have to FULLY repair it to find out, would just be a few seconds wasted. A killer going to a fake hook could be a wiggle, very easily
---
&gt;The only crutches that survivors currently have would be d strike and adrenaline. I suppose you could make a case against BT as well but I would disagree. This would mean they would not have to sacrifice anything of importance to bring the perk in.
---
Self-Care or Adrenaline + Exhaustion Perk + Decisive Strike + Unbreakable. You also have the option to swap any of these perks for Borrowed Time, Iron Will and Urban Evasion. Some of them aren't as strong as others but they do help a lot in some situations or against specific killers. 
---
&gt;You would have a strong argument if the majority of the survivor population didn’t already have access to a free totem counter. All that happens from not adding one would be solo players being at yet another disadvantage to SWF, which is like to believe everyone agrees should not be the case.
---
Forcing survivors that complain about NOED nonstop to use small game would benefit the killers by removing one of the mentioned perks, even against SWF since at least one of them would use it. If the totem counter is added by default it just means they can continue to use their loadouts with the strongest perks they can think of. Whats next? Survivors should see generator auras and how much progress they have? 
---
I know that SWF can keep the count but if you ever played with your friends, not everyone is a SEAL team and is not rare that someone forgets how many totems they cleansed and also not every team is a 4-Players SWF. Sometimes you have two or three players in SWF. 
---
&gt;Adding a totem counter would benefit the killer regardless of where they had noed or not. Survivors would spend more time in match searching for totems and not doing gens which is something that people have been wanting for a long long while.
---
NOED already does that purely by existing. If you are a good survivor you are hunting for totems whenever you can. 
---
&gt;There really isn’t any way in which adding a totem counter would hurt the killer side, if anything it may be more of a buff to them than survivors.
---
True, the totem counter wouldn't hurt killers that much but tying such effect to a perk would be a more balanced way to do it. 
---
Why would he lie? I’ve seen stuff like this happen before. I’ve played the game for years.
---
It would be the only useful thing it does 
---
Run windows of opportunity! It's a very nice perk for learning the layout of new maps AND getting you familiar with already released maps!
---
All the more reason to buff it by giving it a counter, right?
---
Doc's passive scream can be frustrating but how in the hell did that person go the entire game without ever entering madness tier 1? I try to proc it asap as he's busy in another chase so it doesn't proc on me later. 
---
But hook
---
&gt; I must ask, why not just add it to the base kit?
---
I saw you reply to someone talking about Small Game.  Sorry if I misunderstood you.
---
Clown and Feng
---
Be still, my beating heart 
---
Same.
---
It's This, they feel too intimidated to adventure away, survivors can sometimes counter it if the killer is newish but it is no fun for anyone
---
I am afraid i don´t have an ebony mori left.
---
But i can make an special offer for you, still have a tombstone and a tuft of hair.
---
Everyone else DCed and you didn’t let lastie escape? That’s harsh man. 
---
What does that do?
---
Going to play Devil's Advocate: they do bring up some good points. There (seems to be) no downside to multiple Decisive Strikes now, and you can't tell if a Survivor has DS anymore. (Which is debatably a good thing as the perk should be a surprise. It's really dumb when a perk is publicly announced to every player through the UI.)
---
But if you "need" to "focus down someone" just bring a Green Mori. In addition slugging someone and forcing them to use their one charge of Unbreakable means that you can slug them again. And even if they do have Unbreakable they're still spending quite a bit of time on the ground doing fuck all.
---
And you can also counter the perk by *not tunneling for 60 seconds?* Lol. Also have no idea where he got the "enduring affects it less now" point.
---
While there are some concerns this post really just seems like "waaaaan I can't hard tunnel anymore I cry BHVR so survivor-sided."
---
Bingo. People keep saying “but the killer won’t leave you there for 60 sec he’s blowing the game!”  First off, slugging already happens in the game currently. Second, for every second that survivor runs, if he’s not instantly downed, that timer is dropping so it ain’t gonna be 60 sec!
---
This is very arguably one of the best dbd cosplays I have seen yet. 
---
But did he hurt himself or david more? Entity likes to stab him right in the gut after every other stab
---
I'd say yes if you aren't SWF. The hitboxes are completely fucked, which makes every killer way stronger. If you aren't playing against a good SWF and know what you're doing you'll probably 4k as killer. Solo survivor has always sucks and it just gets worse and worse every update.
---
^(um excuse me devs there appears to be a game in your bug)
---
He did it too three of us, when he did to the first person i couldn't get any where near them cause he camped the entrance (he hooked them in the basement) then once he saw me he tunneled me untill he got me down then he hooked me and face camped me till i was in struggle state, that's when he backs up a bit  and only takes a few looks around in that time another survivor got me unhooked, but instead of going after the person who unhooked he he tunnels he again. I die, he eventually finds a 3rd survivor hooks them and camps them, luckily the 4th found hatch and escaped
---
Maybe you got paired with the rank 7 and he was in a SWF with the red rank
---
Why do people keep saying there is no counter play?  It's a hex totem.  Destroy the hex totem.  It's literally the gimmick of all hex totems.
---
Yes, a perk that requires you to be good at chases is a crutch for being bad, LMAO. A bad Killer gets no benefit from NOED because bad Killers can't get hits.
---
I've had this happen several times today on PS4, ended up needing to take a break from the game.
---
I am afraid not, but i can still mori you &lt;3.

and of course the other Nea comes to click her Flashlight

Sounds like a complete failure by the survivors. One death was unavoidable- three is poor performance.

Thank you, you want to get mori´d too ?

Enough to pip? Or enough creativity points just for a safety pip

Windows is a Kate teachable that reveals every pallet and window in a certain radius around you by highlighting them in a yellow aura. When you fast vault a window or throw down a pallet when in a chance, the perk goes on cool down for 20 seconds before you can see the auras again. At least the 20 second CD is for tier one I'm pretty sure, but that's about it.

Even better! 😍

4 reasons basically.  They're either really bad at the game, you played toxic af and they wanted to punish you, you played perfectly fine but they're toxic af and just like to grief survivors, exit gates open and they don't have any reason not to camp.

Legion? I am a Freddy, and I am using NOED til' my remember me goes to lvl 3, but the bloodwen is kind of a bitch sometimes
---
That's a tall ass on claudette
---
No worries then. 
---
You don’t have to be gay, just try it once. 
---
Devs: Why does r/dbdgonewild exist?
---
Also Devs:
---
To be fair i hadn't bothered with the first survivor i might of made it. But the third i don't even know
---
It’s 1,500 points per gen. There’s not much else could be earned. He probably didn’t do well from the chase either.
---
And also, killer mains play victim too. The sub is a salt mine.
---
Fair
---
Always enough to pip.
---
*Insidious pig is the new meta!*
---
In all seriousness though, it's most likely because they usually chase, and they had a bad game or two and can't be assed
---
I can hear the footsteps already
---
No exit gates, just camped straight from the first survivor he hooked
---
Haha, that analogy fits much better!
---
It's not gay if you say no homo after. That's what I've learned with my straight guy friend. 
---
It was a broken perk, no matter what you say it was broken. That's why they're changing it
---
This: 10/10
---
Although it ruins the experience for the killer, its a very easily punishable tactic. 
---
Rush gens if the killer is just camping. It takes a survivor 2 minutes to fully die from their first hook assuming they resist during the struggle phase. 
---
Gens take 80 seconds so by the time one survivor is dead, 3 and gens can be completed and the other 2 half completed. Of course this is assuming that the survivor was immediately hooked. Usually all 5 gens can be almost completed by the time a survivor is dead on hook.
---
The game also actively punishes players who camp by removing points from the killers chaser emblem based upon how long they stay near the hook.
---
Borrowed time helps alot with hook camping and DS can help when escaping after the unhook. Dead hard is also useful.
---
That's why I like to go with Spell damage based Killers.
---
Back before the survivor emblem system, this could be the difference between a pip or a de-rank. 
---
Let´s meet at Haddonfield, down at the basement.
---
Damn dude I'm jealous
---
The only endorphin I need from this game is hearing Mike's jingle.
---
Everyone talking shit bout the baby survivors crying over the changes but not enough about killer mains really being salty about it because.....they can't insta-down and rehook survivors :(
---
Just leave isn’t counterplay when the last gen pops mid chase and you go down in one hit. 
---
Just find the totem is pretty bullshit counterplay vs a super speed killer who can down you in one hit. 
---
For me it's a reverse situation - I love meaningful coop (which is a really rare thing) and it's here. And also I like how killer plays forse me to play both smart and reactive
---
I feel this but I don't do it. I run mostly red ranks unless we get reset, and by that point I think you should either be able to mostly hit GSC or know how to gen tap and get it done that way!
---
I have literally stood up and pointed for them to get the fuck off the gen before when this happens lol 
---
That player was all acting like they didn't know what was going on lol as if we were born yesterday 
---
As the resident totem goblin I support this. Only change to NoEd, or about NoEd, that I'd accept. 
---
New doc add on??
---
Legacy means nothing but they played when the grind was extra shitty
---
With that in mind, 🅱️lease let me use my legacy shirt without assuming I'm gonna be toxic I just like how it looks with the rest of my outfit :(
---
My new favorite thing is running T3 kindred with open-handed. Gives all the other survivors a heads up if the killer is camping, sometimes even helps with coordinating saves 
---
There is also always unbreakable if you're paranoid (or no mither if you're crazy.)
---
The rule is simple: if you're not getting chased, you should be doing gens. That's it.
---
If you are hiding the only reason is being injured with Iron Will and the Killer in your ass or because you have Urban Evasion and that gen at +70% and the Killer is right there.
---
Don't go out of your way looking for Ruin, just look as you move between gens after finishing them. I've run Aftercare to see the 3 survivors looking for Ruin and no one but me doing gens. Of course, they looked were other survivors had already looked. And don't gen tapp.
---
But he wants to customize the hook
---
It usually happens with players who have absurdly high ping imo. Sometimes I'll notice someone with 200&lt; ping in the lobby, and when the game starts, sure enough, they DC when downed.
---
Do people not know how to check their ping pre-game or something? Smh.
---
Theses are soooooo cool could you give me a quick run down of what you need to make them
---
No that falls into reason 1 my man.  
---
Ive prestiged feng min once and am level 24 currently. Ive never touched Kate before. She isnt dlc correct?
---
The devs have said in the past that they want to minimize the informational difference between playing solo and playing SWF, then buff killer to combat the general informational increase that all survivors would have at that point. Right now, killer buffs are felt harder by solo players over SWF because of that inherent difference.
---
Something that tells survivors how many totems are left on the map would help solo players significantly more than SWF, as SWF can already deduce the number of totems without the use of a counter. 
---
&gt; it would be a massive nerf to hex totems that are already barely useful
---
It literally would not affect other hex totems in the slightest. Nobody is asking for the counter to differentiate between dull and hex totems, and as such, the only perk affected by this would be NOED. That said, in hindsight, a HUD change for one perk is kind of ridiculous so I shifted my stance on this and edited the OP to reflect that.
---
I agree now that a counter added to Small Game would be more of a fair change, but in the end, you're mashing together other arguments from different threads in an effort to discredit the original suggestion as well as saying "I didn't have issues cleansing all the totems in one solo match, therefore nobody should have a problem". It's hard to take your arguments seriously because of that.
---
It's not that it's harder to win, it's that it's harder to have fun.
---
Yes, winning is easy if you genrush, but is that any fun at all? They're ruining the part of the game most Survivor mains enjoy: the chase. Until they fix the speed gens get done then Survivors will continue to dominate when played properly.
---
They nerf things like Vaults, Pallets, Perks, but never nerf gens. It's mindboggling.
---
Like... Mr. X as a killer has basically made itself... all's need doing is BHVR negotiating the rights for the crossover. Hell, it'd be good for both DBD and Resident Evil promotion wise.
---
BP farm without BBQ?..
---
Those ranks aren’t very far off lol why you crying.
---
I main Meg too :)
---
I wear the Ashen Bob, mosh pit sleeveless top, and Rascal ripped jeans. (I like wearing black) I'd say I'm immersive but there's nothing immersive about my bright ass white hair 😂
---
Since I can’t even hit DS the times I’ve used it, I can’t rely on it that much LUL
---
I congratulate you on the limited words used to say “I’m a shit killer who can’t get more than 2 kills without using NOED”. 
---
this hurts meas a legacy claudette
---
I'be be concerned if you didn't.
---
Sadly, she is dlc. But I think you can buy her separately in the shop from clown for 8k iridescent shards so that's an option. I know you can buy her, I just don't know how much she costs
---
i agree
---
Absolutely disagree. I'm seeing soo many people say this and this is absolutely not the case. This game for killers was horrible at the start(infinites,too many pallets in the map,exhaustion recovery while sprinting,vacuum pallets etc etc..) these are all things that are super strong, have no counters and made even decent survivors look good because of how easy it was. Back then even a decent survivor could run the killer around for the entire game and escape no problem. This was due to the previously mentioned factors and more.Now the game is in the best state it has ever been for both sides. If you're a killer, you can apply pressure through the map and end chases quick if you're good. If you're a good survivor you can give killers a rough time by looping them for a while and get gens done. (obviously there are other factors that decide all of this like the map, which killer etc). I don't know if you posted this because of the ds change but I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you didn't but to others; ds getting reworked does not mean killers are suddenly op. If you seriously think that killers are op because a super strong survivor perk got nerfed I don't know what to tell you but perhaps you rely on that perk too much.(this concept does not apply to other perks;it only does for noed and ds because they're both perks that reward you for failure) This ds outrage is equally as ridiculous as if noed got changed and everyone started saying survivors are op.

"I main Meg"
---
So you also have a disability
---
Oh yeah, I forgot dribbling doesn't work anymore. And honestly, I don't current implementation because killers are going to cheese it by waiting. It should definitely not go down during the chase, like deep wounds and reversed bear trap; or maybe they could remove the timer and just have DS activated until another survivor is downed, which would really encourage killers not to tunnel.
---
A 3D printer, acrylic paint and a lot of blood, sweat and tears :P
---
The models of the masks and weapons were made by my boyfriend in Fusion 360 (and are hopefully available for everyone interested soon), printed in PLA on a CR-10. Then you need so fill and sand everything to become smooth and paint it with acrylics. Most of the clothing stuff was simply bought and weathered with fake blood and customized with fabric paint!
---
I hope this helps!
---
this meme reminds me of low rank games...So much more fun :(
---
So, your idea of a fix for a SINGLE perk, is to add a totem counter?  Do you not see how ridiculous that is?
---
You already have Self Care as Claud, which is nice. I’d probably go for Balanced Landing or Lithe next— I prefer Balanced because of Lithe’s inconsistency, but to each their own. Other than those two it shouldn’t matter all too much... Adrenaline is nice, but only if you’re making it to endgame relatively often.
---
My niece and I have been speculating... we are hoping for some variations of original monsters... don’t need special licenses but things like vampires/vlad the impaler.... Jack the Ripper.... werewolves.... swamp thing.... proper monster killers would be cool af. 
---
Alternatively other cryptids too.... Jersey devil, yeti... mothman, etc.... 
---
I would love to see this version of Mr. X as a killer. I wonder what his ability would be, however. He just walks up and punches you. I would say maybe break through some walls, but it would be too situational and I doubt the game would be able to do that
---
Yeah, I remember waaaay back in the day when killer could see survivor ranks in the lobby. If survivors were mostly newbies, I loved fucking around with them as a Wraith because I didn't have to worry about losing them all or getting viciously tbagged. 
---
Yeah thanks my college allows the use of their 3D printer for our own use as long as it's done out of lesson so I could do this. The legion is my favourite for cosplay
---
You mean like all the times they’ve reworked how game elements work to nerf survivors? Ah yes a totem counter is much more ridiculous than changing windows, pallets, exhaustion, healing, flashlights, and hitboxes. 
---
I like the idea of it being added to a perk, but not being baseline. This is meant to be a asymmetrical HORROR game, which in my opinion means that survivors should lack some information to keep up the suspense.
---
ye, and nowadays all it takes are a few days of playing and we're back at sweat ranks :(
---
Play what you want
---
I'm going for the Dockta cuz he a giggly boi.
---
Meg mains have big brains
---
I think it’s from the launch trailer for legion 
---
*hisses*
---
Crying?
---
You will play against significantly better players at Rank 1 than at rank 10, especially near the beginning of a rank reset. Near the end, a lot of shit survivors and killers have made their way up to higher ranks, but early on the consistent two-pippers are all playing at rank 1 with 15 minute queue times.
---
Worst: CORN maps.
---
Best: Gideon Meatplant, okay listen I am not a killer main I play bith survivor and killer equally. I am just a HUGE Saw fan that's why I like it.
---
The new leader laughs at the TOTH slowdown
---
and yet you must
---
Yes he does
---
I’m confused, for some reason I didn’t think that was Julie’s normal cosmetic cause I’ve never seen it 
---
That’s what his chainsaw is for
---
All of those were necessary changes for the health of the game.  I don't know if you were around back when this game first came out, but every single one of those changes was for the better.
---
Vaulting:  Survivors used to be able to quick vault just by holding shift and pressing space.  It didn't matter if you were standing still, running, walking, or their angle.
---
Windows:  Every map had infinite loops.  Main buildings would have 2+ Windows (Wretched Shop was the most notorious for having 3 open windows.  Even the shack, which was a building present in every map, had 2 windows.
---
Exhaustion:  The reason Exhaustion even exists is because people just stacked perks that gave them movement speed.  People would run Sprint Burst, Balanced Landing, and Lithe.  It was ridiculous.
---
Healing:  With the right perks and items, you could heal yourself in 10 seconds.  No questions asked.  There was even a time where you could heal yourself faster than the killer could attack you.
---
Flashlights:  Being able to flashlight blind a killer in .2 seconds with a purple flashlight was insane.  You don't think that needed to be nerfed?
---
Hit boxes:  You can chalk that up to interp.  Just so you guys know, dedicated servers aren't going to fix this.
---
Let's meet at the exit gates.
---
Really, I guess everyone who uses Julie has the suspended outfit
---
Lerys by a mile for Survivor.  It used to be quite strong but they broke it with the window spawn rework.
---
As survivor Gideon Meat Plant. I always think killer is on the floor I'm on when he isn't. Confuses me all the time
---
As killer the preschool. I hate it a lot. 
---
The game and any corn map.
---
Either make him 110 or make it so he can't hump your ass while revving. Should be like LF.
---
Yeah usually it’s default or susie for me
---
Pebble is above any rules
---
Rank 20 runs ds as it is rn: guess ill die
---
Yes, sir &lt;3
---
Facts
---
I heard he switch platforms and is playing on a smart fridge
---
Honestly if his chainsaw wasn’t a one shot he’d still be a top tier killer easily
---
I'm trying to build Myers with Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's Calling, Thanatophobia, Coulrophobia/Stridor because ultra memes.
---
Although I'm sure there's better Killers for this I like Myers c:
---
After I'm done with this build I'm thinking Terror Doctor with Overwhelming Presence, Distressing, Agitation, Coulrophobia, for easy Tier 3 madness.
---
These are not meta in the slightest, but they are fun.
---
Nsfw? 
---
Haddonfield
---
Game
---
Corn
---
Ormond
---
To be fair they didn't debuff NOED
---
Why is it "boys" if there is only Ace? 
---
This is a discussion not a rant btw
---
Myers or Clown and Meg. I like Myers in general with his power, story, etc and the Clown is fun with a nice aesthetic.
---
Damn , maybe because you put the youtube videos up? 
---
“NOED users be like...”
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
NOED has counterplay unlike DS. To counter DS you had to exploit a bug.
---
Thank you so much kind sir or madam. Anything to help me through DBD induced depression. 
---
I’m more wondering if we have a full group of five people, will we still have a good time?
---
To be fair, sprint burst is almost always used immediately after finishing a gen to get out of bitter market range
---
Mozzie is a boy as well , you know 
---
I mean, it could have just been straight up removed from the game, it’s now an anti tunneling perk 
---
Thanks appreciate it
---
I can't think of a time, either on survivor or killer where i've though "Yay, rotten fields" or "Yay, Blood Lodge" 
---
I am happy, when you guys are.
---
I just wanted to give this community, what it craved for (in about every third post). 
---
As a killer worst is *C O R N* , the best is one of McMillans, the one where there is a Mine in one of the sides and the killer shack in the other one, or the long autohaven one.
---
As a survivor the best is Haddonfield because I use Balance Landing and the worst is probably Lerys because I get lost and RIP my Balance Landing (I'm not going near that circle of death).
---
You are still doing this "us vs them" bullshit mate, its hard to consider your opinion when its blatantly one sided.
---
"Just learn to play" "damn some of you are real bad" "x perk is just as bad if not worse" "you reddit killer main"
---
Its just not worth listening to when its almost a fucking copypasta that by replacing "ds" with "noed" and "survivor" with "killer" the other side can use.
---
For Survivor it's probably MacMillan Estates, not a lot of pallets at all. For Killer I'd say Lerys, if you have SWF running urban and gen rushing there's no way you're finding them in there. 
---
I really want to like The Game. I just wish they brightened it up a bit, on console there's some areas where you literally can't see anything. 
---
One as the killer and the rest survivors, yeah you will. This is how I started out playing. 
---
After playing the mode for a while your confidence should be up to play ranked matches. 
---
Sweet! Thanks!
---
And that’s my point, I guess you’re a dodger. You won’t get better by avoiding good survivors. I never play swf and never bring items, never tbag. So why should I get dodged other than because they’re bad
---
I don’t see how op using DS is in any way the same as the game having bullshit hitboxes, but sure I guess?
---
Christmas sweater and tennis skirt! 
---
I always solo wueue and never bring items
---
As in one could be the killer and the rest survivors? That one is tough because you can give each other house rules, limit certain skills, rotate the killer, it all just depends. When we group up it's still fun but it all just depends on your friends and how they act. I think at least. 
---
Wut the fuck is happening. I was prestige ing daddy Myers all week and I haven't been on reddit much. Context?
---
blood lodge, AKA "what the fuck am i stuck on now?"
---
coal tower has a good number of pallets
---
That’s the great thing about survivor. You don’t need perks to be good. Any perk you pick is just cherry on top. If you’re relying on single perks to make you “bleeding edge amazing”, that sounds like a user operator issue.
---
In all seriousness, why the fuck do Leatherface players do this? Multiple games one night where Bubba did this to me or someone else and I was so salty.
---
Wraith players been doing this all of a sudden as well. They ding dong away and then stand 5 feet from hook by a tree.
---
The reason there were so many concurrent nerfs to survivors is because they were so blatantly overpowered since release that one nerf wasnt going to cut it. Only since the vacuum pallet/hag and trapper patch did this game hit a balance. IMO ds balance was unecessary but whatever.
---
I'm a huge Halloween fan and I main Myers so this does weird things to me.
---
Had a killer camp me on ps4, I immediately sent them gg too Ez killer after they left the lobby and they cursed me out even though I was the one who died.
---
I found or hilarious and now do this to every camper, if my team survives.
---
Hilarious, and I don’t think I’ve ever heard Zubat laugh like that!
---
Was this the same match where he was hooked in the basement with a shit load of traps? I think I joined it in progress and missed this
---
If it's happening *seconds* after that often, it's something wrong with your connection 
---
yup it was that game
---
You must be one of the lucky few 
---
Damn that was a good save.
---
You mean the hosts connection
---
Idk why people dodge flashlights, they’re so bad now it’s just a wasted slot that coulda been a toolbox or medkit
---
Hm..
---
I'm ambivalent on what should be done with NOED, but iirc the devs said in the FAQ that they didn't have any upcoming plans on changing it. 
---
The one on the left says John.
---
You’re welcome.
---
So they should stop trying and let the balance go to hell?
---
Statisticly 1/5 of the playerbase should be kollers, with the other 4/5 being survivors. What i assume you are suggesting is they should please the majority meaning that survivors get absolutley broken beyond belif, and oh wait, there isnt a single living soul queing killers. They want as 50/50 as possible to be able to have just as many killers queing as survivors
---
"Im A kIlLeR mAiN"
---
^ every survivor main trying to whine about something 
---
Don’t say with a dick in your mouth otherwise it sounds like Mo’ Homo.
---
I had stopped running DS because I don’t really need crutch perks, but now that it’s an anti tunneling perk I actually might start running it again
---
OINK
---
I’d love to see more killers buffed, but having a killer be able to instadown at a faster movement speed than other killers who can’t doesn’t make sense. It would make the game more interesting rather than having an instadown every minute. I agree it’s unbalanced, but this might be a way to balance it slightly more.
---
It’s a borrowed time you can use on yourself.
---
Wait people actually buy g fuel? Why tho, it’s literally just shitty preworkout. 
---
I think he meant current p3, their shirt and head were bloody.
---
I never said they should give up, they just need to find a way to keep BALANCE and stop giving so much to the killers while taking away from survivors 
---
Hitbox machine is broke rn on all platforms 
---
Quit after half an hour. Got to keep my add-ons luckily.
---
I am a killer main tho 
---
Can someone explain this? 
---
Why you acting like I know you? Obviously dodging shitty pings is justified, I hate going against players with bad ping it’s boring for both sides
---
Holy shit you changed my mind real quick.
---
Well hey now i k ow why my exposed perks have never shown me anyone. 
---
Youre either a god at the game or pc is different, because all my games my teammates are boosted fucks, killer is a retard but plays an op killer with op perks, and sweats their ass off
---
Chill mate the PTB hasn’t even hit yet
---
uh huh
---
Spaghetti code, so who even knows. 
---
This is ban-able right? 
---
Im bot gonna watch the whole video but that first 360 was absolutely fap material
---
I guess, but they’d have to make it spawn in bloodwebs as often as noed does. I’ve gotten 3 survivors to 50 without seeing it once, but I’ve gotten noed by level 10 on all my killers. 
---
They'd still be deprived of any points they could have received from that survivor throughout the remainder of the match. It would be impossible to hit 8000 points in the sacrifice character, and makes a double-pip very difficult.
---
Just a warning:  the DBD reddit community is goddamn thirsty, almost to a genuinely creepy level.  So just be cautious.  I like your cosplay though.
---
CAKE AND ICE CREAM IS ON ITS WAY
---
I didnt. Maybe you should read what I wrote again. You accused me of dodging swf, people I've played against ect which I said I dodge shitty ping and nobody can get mad at someone dodging shitty ping except you ofc.
---
My results:
---
Trapper-0
---
Wraith-1 if you count his cape
---
Billy-0
---
Nurse-0
---
Huntress-2 if you count clothing
---
Michael-0
---
Hag-0
---
Bubba-Apron and tie(when did he start wearing a tie?)
---
Doctor-1 if you count trench coat
---
Freddy-0
---
Amanda-1(cloak)
---
Clown-4(hair,pants,belly, and shirt)
---
Spirit-7(arm/leg segments, and boobs)
---
Legion-1(hoodie strings)
---
These are all using default skins.
---
DS is a wasted perk until you know how to loop well
---
Mending is kind of a drag too. Gotta heal that THEN heal yourself. Like it wants you to find other survivors to heal you but then Legion punishes for sticking together.
---
In a row?!?
---
Why do people who want to make anothers person life hell exist I wonder.
---
To be fair, I see more posts from killers mocking survivors because of the change than survivors complaining about it. Most of it seems like salt bait.
---
How is this game killer favoured? TrU3Ta1ent released a clip of all five gens getting done in the first 2 minutes. You sound like some guy who just picked up the game yesterday, died and got salty about it. If you think this game is killer favoured you are extremely stupid.
---
God damnit I have a sore throat. That "trash killer lol gg" just made it worse. Take my upvote
---
No he doesnt
---
Wtf is wrong with you? I literally just said dodging shitty ping is justified. Talk about double standards 
---
yeah probably, chances are if you watch Zubat, Jen, Scott or Ryan you've probably seen me a few times + a bunch of other streamers who I watch less.
---
The real question is... how did 3 die to a huntress with NOED? :)
---
Yeah. Screw that guy. Where is his costume? 
---
Yeah I thought he was fun too, until I played against him a few times. Landing a few 360's just delays the outcome especially with good add ons. He just needs counterplay!  I found lithe decent against him as Legion loves to fast vault windows! But he just keeps up with you, then charges his power again.. 
---
So nerf the one good killer in red ranks instead of buffing the other killers to be better and comparable? 
---
Part of it could be luck. I also have unlucky days where I get a streak of bad games for a multitude of reasons. But I'm far less likely to remember them, just how my mind works. Quite the opposite when it comes to areas of my life like love and work. I remember those bad days for far too long. &gt;.&lt; haha
---
After being banned by PSN for “fueling the flames” of a salty survivor, despite not cursing or using vulgarity in anyway, I decided to block all my messages too.
---
It’s not worth it when you can lose all access to PlayStation for a week because someone’s upset you played a game as intended.
---
Why not both?
---
I agree with you mostly but trapping pallets is never useless imo, yeah good survivors will notice and just not use it but then they have to get to another vault or window and you can get a free hit
---
This happened to me with a recent match where we fought a legion and everyone except me disconnected and I just sat there, like why did this happen to me, in the end, did 2 gens but still died.
---
You aren't any good at looping if you think that.
---
Billy's only problem is instasaw, he's well balanced otherwise.
---
I tried to be heroic and take a hit so the claudette could go and save (the Huntress was camping), but of course she had noed, and well, we all died with honor, and the Huntress won, won like a noob 
---
\*Old Guys Hanging Out &amp; Feeding Birds In Central Park -1989 colorized\*
---
You get a notification when a gen is almost done and you'll have no terror radius for a few seconds.
---
It's completely different now.
---
Billy doesn't really need a nerf. If he was a 4.4 he'd get looped to eternity like the rest of the 4.4 killers. The saw is only good when you get right on people with no cover, at loops he has to M1 anyway.
---
Again you accused me of something after I gave rational. Then accuse me of acting like you know me when I simply responded with a nope-&gt; proceeded by explaining why they dodged you and you became an ass. So again enjoy your day cause you obviously dont like hearing opinions of people who dont line up with what you want
---
Survivors have been massively OP for a long time. Even now, if they play well there's nothing any killer who's not a god Nurse can do. You have every tool to never go down, and yet you complain when your OP crutches get turned into solutions to old problems. Survivors have been whining about tunneling for a long time, well here's your anti-tunneling thing. It just so happens that they're repurposing the most anti-fun thing in the whole game to do it. I have seen DS single handedly turn 4k steamrolls into 1k meh-at-best games for the killer, while playing both sides. In it's current form it's a get out of jail free card that I can't use without feeling terrible as a survivor because i've suffered at it's hands far too much as a killer. This rework/nerf is precisely what it needed.
---
If you lower his movement speed then his "map presence" doesn't matter since he would get looped forever.
---
Why would it matter that he can be anywhere on the map fast if he can't down people reliably?
---
Bro that’s nuts. Never thought I’d see the real deal
---
That's RNG for you.
---
Honestly T1 Myers is the scariest. 
---
Lol. No BP for anyone. Fun games. 
---
I also have the ability to equip a bnp on my flashlight 
---
Every update is horrible, Killers should get better at the game instead of begging for everything Survivor related to get nerfed. 
---
LF's slow down on revving chainsaw is precisely what makes Leatherface not a good killer. 
---
You have to be up their arse to hit them with the chainsaw, otherwise they get away (unless you have beast marks).
---
Yes, it's bannable.
---
Ok. I didn't think so.
---
More like Jake. 
---
Hillbilly is very good and one of my favorites but he's wayy too easy to learn for all of his tools
---
I like it.
---
Honestly the moment when he lunged for you and hit the farming Jeff instead was something to be proud of. Props to you for that &lt;3
---
*Myers intensiefies*
---
That's too hard, make the game easier for me. I'm too lazy to get better.
---
A Laurie I guess. She fell down that silo thingy and I had a trap down their.
---
Jeff with face paint laughs at this
---
*Boosted "high rank" survivors.
---
Soft
---
They're teaming with killer. Report them.
---
You right 
---
Wow, if that Meg wanted a flashlight save she really did a garbage job of it. You gotta *hide*. No killer in their right mind is going to pick someone up when they see the bright blue Meg running around with a flashlight. 
---
But hey, she got what she deserved. I wonder if she got the safe unhook points? Do you get the points if you die before the safe unhook point bonus procs?
---
Song?
---
Who is Legion?
---
Sounds like somebody I would mori. 
---
It is a slug fest with his built in deerstalker
---
Both matter. If it's **this** consistent however then it's mostly OP
---
The whole thing isn't entirely dependent on the killer hosting. I can't fucking believe how many of you think that
---
I had to. Biggest Myers fan and also noticed the thirstiness of the community.
---
I am here now. Not going to leave without moriing everybody. 
---
Oh, I know.
---
My Body is ready. 
---
He may be too powerful, but it'd be amazing! Also, he's like 7.5 feet tall.
---
I’ve been rank 1 and I still can’t hit DS. 
---
Clearly the devs actually know what they are doing, unlike your scewd preception of whats going on, and are balancing accordingly, yeah it might seem unfair and seem like you are being oppressed, but you just had your priveleg removed and when that happens it seems like oppresion from your perspective
---
So cool!
---
Thank you! :)
---
It’s a remix of Peppersteak from the game Off
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Too soft
---
What? They're going to make her fly?
---
You didn't addres my point. Nerfing him is not needed if you buff other killers enough.
---
They will still come into the spotlight and share it with them if you do that.
---
Update: Thanks for sharing your pros and cons. Since hitting re ranks, it’s been only BBQ and Billy with instasaws going Ruin/Enduring/Spirit Fury/BBQ and Chili. Maybe the change shouldn’t be in movement speed (as many of you mentioned issues with looping which I hadn’t considered), but what are your thoughts on changing instasaws? Yay/nay?
---
Additionally, I would love to see buffs to other killers to add more variety and enjoyment to red ranks.
---
How are Haddenfield and Ormond broken?
---
That's a big oof my friend 
---
I've been doing something similar for a while now. I've been going in as Scratched Mirror Michael. It's pretty fun!
---
Unless there's a pallet nearby. I'm crawling there first. 
---
He'd have to have limited abilities, for sure. His weapon would be the wrist blades, and his power would probably be the thermal vision but not through walls
---
Thank you. 
---
They should nerf maps, not gens. Certain things like Coldwind Farm still having see through tiles preventing the killer from ever trying a mindgame is so dumb. 
---
Thank you so much! We put a lot of work and thought into these masks and there are still a few things we want to improve. This means a lot &lt;3
---
You know how I know this is bullshit? Because my Ruin is gone in less than 30 seconds sometimes. If you guys cleansed dull totems as fast as you cleansed Ruin, no one would even use NOED. Then you claim it’s not feasible. Yea, BS. There’s 4 of you, each one of you go cleanse a dull and find the last one along the way and you’ll never be bugged by NOED again.
---
But you don’t. You jump straight on the first generator you see, cleanse Ruin, then clear gens as fast as you can. Can you see from a killer’s perspective how it’s hard to find sympathy for this?
---
Hello, could you just stand still so I can charge my Evil Within to tear 3? 
---
You’re right, I forgot to address it. I think you’re right in that buffing other killers would be a good first step. If he’s still too strong, then maybe take another look later, but I agree with your proposed changes.
---
Why are you trying to defend dying light. Everyone hates that perk including killers.
---
NOED has a counter, Ruin has an even easier counter, DS had no counter. I'm done trying to discuss with 5 year olds, you just cover your ears and cry, you don't know how reasoning works. This discussion is over.
---
Lf is so bizzare. 
---
He doesn't have the map control of Billy so you'd think his chainsaw should be more powerful in close quarters. But no, you're slower while revving, move pretty slow while swinging it compared to Billy's chainsaw, and you only swing it 4 times, so you can actually not hit them while touching them between swings.
---
Also the stun for hitting walls is longer. Like, what gives?
---
I guess it's because hE cAn HiT mUlTiPlE suRvIvoRs. Like that happens happens often.
---
&gt;This is why no one likes you fuckers
---
Imagine getting this upset at some people for picking a certain side to play on a video game.
---
I don't mind his movement speed but his instadowns with the constant map pressure he puts out revs my own chainsaw up a bit. 
---
He is the best killer to control map pressure and I find it a challenge to regain control once he takes it (as a solo queue R1 survivor - it may not be the case for SWFs). *He* has to make a mistake somewhere otherwise it's a saw up the ass and a hook thru the boob for me. 
---
To break up the constant "hit, hook, cross map, hit, hook, cross map" games, it would be interesting if he had to refuel his saw after so many uses. 
---
(new-ish player, idk if this was a previous build of his haha) 
---
No don't apologize, the tattoos really add to the daddy-ness 
---
Lol you commented on my post earlier, you look even more like a dumb-ass now. This stupidity is fucking gold 
---
Nope. Ps4
---
Thanks.
---
I mean while I understand it’s frustrating, it does balance out in its own fucked up and annoying way.
---
I feel the same frustration when I’m miles away from a pallet and still get stunned or my auto aim decides to hit air or hay.
---
The hitboxes are just all around shit in this game.
---
This seems pretty cool.
---
Damn you for nerfing DS, I'm uninstalling. This perk is the only thing that kept us quite about all the killers buffs and new perks to "balance" the game.  
---
It really is misleading, and for no good reason. In the Japanese version it's "無防備", or "Defenceless"/"Vulnerable", which is way more fitting than "Exposed". I don't know why the English one is so vague.
---
How could the net gun be like the pig?
---
i want mozzie
---
Yeah, and Kate and Adam aren't exactly licensed, either. 
---
"It doesn't give you a reward for nominating yourself as that target" And why should it? Being an obsession isn't something a survivor should ever *want* to be, *ever*. I'll agree that it doesn't make sense as an obsession perk, but it's a good thing that it was nerfed into the ground from what it used to be.
---
Those two things wont matter though. If you want the obsession alive for those perks if you purposefully tunnel the guy and he doesnt have decisive he goes on the hook and nothing is wrong. If he does you reactivate your perk
---
r/woosh
---
Because all the perks are out of date and shit. That’s the only reason. We are in dire need of a perk revamp but I’ll doubt we’ll ever get it.
---
Reverse bear trap is what I'm thinking about - the net slowly constructs before eventually killing the victim 
---
I would more argue that good killers and SWF should be switched becuase even in the tournaments usually all the survivors die. The one I watched of Monto had two gens left and he was fighting to survive for the hatch against the other guy...
---
You’re a legend for those amazing plays and being patient enough to stick around for that bull. Hope they all get banned, I was frustrated for you. 
---
Upvote for working within your budget :D
---
I would clap for that joke but I currently have Finger Knife Gloves on so I’d rather not cut off my fingers. 
---
Ok. That makes sense. Maybe the razor whip could be used somehow? Well, then it would basically be a less ranged Huntress. Damn. How could they make predator?
---
Hey yo, if you could post that link for the Fusion 360 model when you can that would be great.
---
I'm trying to organize a 6 man team of Legion Cosplay but none of us are that skilled to create a model for a 3D printer.
---
Fuckin awesome cosplay by the way, I can't wait to try my own.
---
I think I've hit more than one person like  times outside of someone I'm chasing unhooking in my face.
---
Did you accidentally press the "drop item" button?
---
Just looks like notes for the worker... left says 'John', right says 'Mark'
---
That's a good thing to, since slowing the game down is what a lot of killers need to actually stand a chance.
---
What is the purpose of this post?
---
Yeah, it takes the killer 20 seconds to come back to the hook, and 20 seconds to chase you down even if you're a complete potato. They'll go to kick a generator or smash the pallet you dropped, and then wait 5 more seconds for the timer to run it.
---
Minutes^
---
This is pretty good, although I never like the original song because it is the same thing over and over and over again, but each time there is more that is repeated the next time!
---
And honestly his chainsaw isn’t that great. It’s Tuning Guide Primer Bulb combo that gives people little to no response time to nuke that makes him so good. Like, of all the killers who are addon dependent, the way people play billy, he’s the most addon reliant one and maybe if his were looked at again, we could get something cool for him. 
---
Aside from that, Him and Lf could use an addon review because besides being exactly the same, neither show any skill expression or gameplay change aside from “Beep Beep I’m up your ass” or Meme Speed Limiter. 
---
It’s funny how that killer, with the help of 2 survivors, took so long to kill you. That killer was so bad.
---
This. There have been many times where my wriggle meter is filled up while the killer is moving me, but I still get hooked because their connection is slow.
---
Moderatly soft.
---
Kind of like the game itself lol
---
It's just some weird RNG occurrences.
---
I'm fine with mo homo. The more the better. 
---
The models still need minor adjustments so they're not online yet.
---
We'll probably have them done in a week or two!
---
Thank you so much, wearing Legion feels really badass, especially if you're in a group! :)
---
I'd agree instasaws are too fast. I don't really see much need to run any add ons on Billy as they mess with my muscle memory if they change charge speed. A simple solution would be to have them not stack.
---
"For your safety, you were murdered" I love this guy already.
---
maybe you accidentally triggered the reading aura of the key? no idea tho
---
But the game has variety. You don't repeat in the exact same fashion. Yes, it is chase, attack, chase, attack, hook, but it varies where you chase and how you attack.
---
Considerably soft
---
Fix the lobbies from bugging out? Only time I dodge is if the lobbies seem bugged. Seems like I am consistently getting paired with 3 survivors and the 4th blank spot bugs out.
---
I feel bad because I have an amazing internet connection and I know the survivors love it, but what am I supposed to do? 
---
Then they both get murdered
---
I'll remember that every time I get told to kill myself or some variant of if I manage to kill anybody in a game lol
---
Wow that myers is bad
---
Tremendously soft.
---
Was it on the thompson house map?
---
Thanks for this explanation. 
---
Just a little joke mate. Game's a grind
---
Extremely soft
---
RP DS and BNP. Good riddance to both of them. The only bad one there is still Sprint Burst, you can just look up to avoid flashlight blinds.
---
That's more the survivors misplaying if they let Billy play chainsaw ping-pong. Use lockers to avoid BBQ and then slow down saves a bit.
---

I suspect you people live in a bubble world where you make your own reality, they *just*said that it's in a good place, you have counters, and they don't see the false equivalency with DS that you do.

Probably. I don't think they'll do it even if they could.

hey doctor’s thighs fuckin jiggle and that’s all i need
---
Start spamming socials
---
I think legion is also being reworked
---
Yup... Maybe he can be a licensed killer and we can get Dutch as a survivor 
---
Socials? You mean get more attention to this?
---
you can like the athletic body that's fine but kate is the queen of thiccness.

It's SO bad. The broken trackmarks are a nightmare. &amp; I used to like Lerys too but I've had one too many bad experiences with it at some point.
---
I'd agree with those changes maybe without the leap forward thing as that just aches for bugs and bs hits.
---
And sure it won't make him as good as Billy but it's still better.
---
Basically, yeah, exactly that
---
Play survivor for a month straight. Only survivor. Get to rank 1. Do it please. 
---
I would like Arnold Schwarzenegger'a character. Idk what his name is.

I like to waste my life on r/askouija during times like this. 
---
People of the fog, let me know if you want more of Daddy Myers.
---
Thanks for the overwhelmingly positive and thirsty feedback. 
---
Just a sign that most survivors are boosted above the rank they should be, and that the whole team needs to be good for anyone to make it out. When I play with a swf of actually good players, we can spend half the game memeing and screwing around and still get 3 people out in over half the games we play at any rank.
---
I don't deny that Vooshy's carry was a big part of that streak, but i know for a fact Noob's gotten streaks of over 15 on his own.
---
Almost every time someone starts whining about the DS nerf, NOED is next, so i figured i'd just write it in while i was already doing the rest of the explanation. no need for the anger.
---
Wtf is this? It's kinda like cards against humanity, thx
---
I play scratched mirror against ttv names that are live for this reason lol.
---
There's nothing wrong with Hillbilly. It's everyone below him that sucks.
---
What should I tag it as?
---
Damn already banned from the dbd smartfridge
---
Idk. Discussion?
---
Then hit her?
---
Lol, sure. It's not like playing against a high level SWF is pretty much it's own game or anything.
---
It's also not like there are perks and items out there for killers to counter SWF, which is pretty easy to spot in of itself.
---
Guiding yourself from your alt is vote manipulation, buddy. 
---
This got a chuckle
---
Buffs should really happen more often. I understand reworks taking long but basic buffs? Leatherface should not be this bad, hell most killers need a buff.
---
The devs spout bullshit like “oh not every killer is gonna be viable at rank 1” yeah that’s because you guys suck eggs at balancing. TINY changes make a huge difference 
---
Clown - increase survivor slow from 15% to 20%, and an additional 5% for 25% if you score a direct hit
---
Pig- Honestly, just make the roar sound effect when leaping play mid animation instead of right at the beginning. Maybe make her stealth a wee bit faster.
---
Trapper -  Traps apply the mangle effect and slow people by 15% for 10 seconds of they escape, setting traps is faster
---
Leatherface - See above
---
Ha
---
I think that the 4% MS is the issue as it counters loop.
---
LOL THIS IS GILDED
---
It can get a lil dirty like Cards Against Humanity... cuz Reddit will be Reddit lol
---
Is your pride really worth that much of your time though?
---
I just like playing stealth killers on it.
---
Infinitely soft
---
Freddy's who use NoEd blow my mind. It's hilarious. What is the point unless you bring only addons to quicken dream transition and even then! Wasted slot. It's like insidious on him, useless.
---
That's three stacks, not two. 
---
noed’s counterplay is fucking garbage. Nobody wants to waste two minutes going around the map looking for totems when they could have been on gens only to remove the CHANCE of noed. The killer doesn’t even have noed more then 50% of the time. By the time you find and cleanse all the totems you could have probably done two gens. So basically the survivors are forced to be inefficient because of a perk you MIGHT have. That’s the most stupid idea of “counterplay” I’ve ever heard in a game. the strongest perk on the survivor side has gotten a HUGE nerf. Therefore it would only be fair for killers to get a nerf for once after all the buffs the devs have been handing to killers lately. NOED is a garbage perk for garbage killers. It doesn’t promote anything good in the game, just like dstrike. Nerf it or remove it. The only people who need it anyways are baby killers who can’t down people normally and need some training wheels. Maybe if they didn’t have a perk that carried them so hard they could actually find a way to get better at the game
---
I get dailys for killers I dont play so I suck it up man tf up then delete it and get another dailiy for the same killer. Fml
---
Azerov's Resting Place and Suffocation Pit are the maps you're thinking of.
---
If you have Jeff available I'm a big fan of Distortion and Aftercare. I like Lithe quite a lot too, probably the best exhaustion perk IMO.
---
Wrecker's Yard, only Autohaven map that doesn't have a landmark.
---
Oh hey daddy ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
Either you’re blocking the whole time or u give the survivor the hatch. Whoever gets over the hatch first wins the standoff. If you body block it then they gotta do gens to get the exit open or if they get on it first and don’t jump then u gotta let em have it 
---
I'm working on lesson plans, so it's not a waste of time. 
---
Haddonfield sucks because of all the hiding places, vault spots, and sight breakers.
---
The Game sucks because it's hard to escape the Killer.
---
The Resort sucks because I rarely play it and don't know what to do on it.
---
Can't beat that one. Bur I can equal it!
---
Eternally Soft.
---
Your username sounds so familiar lol I feel like we may be friends on steam or something. Or maybe Biggie Cheese is just a common username
---
LOL
---
No killer I've played against has ever given a player the hatch for beating them to it. Neither had a survivor ever conceded it to me. 
---
Sprint Burst is the worst exhaustion perk though.
---
Man there's no being chased fun anymore. Veteran killer didn't have an issue with good survivors before and sure as hell they don't now. It was all about mind games and we had tons of fun. Skill gap is getting a serious hit from BHVR
---
Guiding yourself from your alt is vote manipulation, /u/TheRealPlumbes. Gilded in the 2 minutes from posting? Go take a nap and play some Civ. 
---
I don't understand how anybody whose played solo queue lately could find it anything but terrible. Every issue with survivor is just compounded when you're alone. Not to mention the fact that the game is an order of magnitude less enjoyable without friends.
---
\*Shining flashlight at the gen\*
---
Hide your traps in grassy areas where survivors are likely to run during a chase or where they might sneak through. The grass will hide the traps for the most part, but once you get someone with it you need to put it somewhere else.
---
Game offering too
---
Wouldn't call it "Honor" but I can see where you're going with this. 
---
It goes without saying that I went home with him that night
---
I like most all the maps for the most part, I guess I just love the art direction. Badham and Swamp I hated before they got patched, but now they're fine IMO. Yamaoka Estate I think looks pretty, so I don't even care if it's a hard map.
---
I guess Rotten Fields is my least favorite, just a very boring map.
---
I think I see the word “costly” on the left. I’ve cracked the case 
---
Lol never have I ever been stressed as a killer. The survivors literally can't hurt you, all they can do is slow you down and evade you. As survivor not only are you stressed about what you're doing and your surroundings but you also have to worry about other survivors ruining it for you with sand bags.
---
Killer is only stressful if you hate losing hide and go seek but nothing about the game design makes it stressful for you.
---
I wanna see the original ad lol.
---
Understandable then I suppose
---
Meme review
---
BBQ, Ruin, M&amp;A and for the last perk I switch between Enduring, Overcharge, or Spirit Fury. 
---
As a fellow David Main and a former Gen-Jockey, I apologize in the name of all Davids
---
We are, my friend. Same goes for shirtless David. 
---
It's always telling when someone uses "they fixed pallet vacuum" as an argument of this game being killer sided. It was an aspect of the game that most reasonable people on both sides would agree was dumb as fuck.
---
As it stands DS is TOO good at all times. It is a ubiquitous perk that will be in basically every game and will basically without fail extend a chase that should have already ended.  With the change it is still strong, but serves a niche purpose rather than just being "Well i fucked up, let me try that again."
---
Lol they are nerfing all the survivors perks and this sub still has the audacity to say survivors have it better 
---
Ok. Thanks
---
😋
---
It's so easy to play killer now lol I'm not going to complain 
---
U w U
---
Like something you see?

https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a49ybp/best_clown_outfit_combo/
---
This was before the engine update, so it's not as crisp as it would be today.
---
Yep I mean, even if the killer is proxying the hook at the time of you being pulled off...all it really takes is just a pallet. What’s the average chase, like 30 seconds? It’s going to be so easy for killers to get around this. 
---
Make 1 for David 
---
Oh, and make sure to mori me in the hot tub like in H2
---
slow gen build (for now): Dying light, thantaphobia, Ruin, Overcharge   All Seeing Build: BBQ, Nurses Calling, Bitter Murmur, Spies from the Shadows with glass shard addons or mirror add ons if you don't mind not getting EW2 or EW3. these are both fun builds :)
---
Orrrrrr you could give it a try when it comes out instead of preemptively crying
---
That's pretty creepy!
---
Took me long enough 😂
---
-18 karma, only 9 post total. God you look like an alt account hmm..
---
I swear my panties were on a second ago
---
See, I was going to actually try, but the post I was going to pull from actually had someone that tried to explain that to you already and it didn't work. I couldn't come up with much better than what u/DecutorR said so I figure it'll just be a difference of opinions thing, since I agree with most of what they said.
---
Since Small Game already somewhat focuses on totems I just think it would mainly be appropriate to add the counter there, really. It'd be a nice extra added on for survivors who want to be totem goblins, such as myself, and get rid of those ruins, NoEds, etc. or just grab ez bloodpoints, without having to add something else for all the survivors to worry about.
---
Part of the problem with adding it to the baseline of the game, I think, would be that it would make some survivors see it as more of an obligation or just make them realize the opportunity, which would put Hexes in an even riskier spot for killers. A lot of survs will currently ignore totems if there's no Ruin or Huntress Lullaby, both which show up early. But with a counter available for everyone to see, some might decide to kill some time and go find some ez points if the killer is camping or they 3-genned themselves. Killers who run Devour Hope would have a lot of a harder time stacking it.
---
Blood drys fast youd have to keep applying it 
---
You have wayyy too much time on your hands lmao.
---
Yuh, that's hot
---
About 3 hours, legit wasnt near hatch went afk to do some stuff around the house/take care of my son came back after getting the mass majority of my house work done and was still in the same match, found the person humping the hatch, which after they saw me the jumped in &gt;-&gt; legit wtf moment like why you sitting there for 3 hours doing nothing 
---
Why am I laughing so hard at this
---
Not until after my key was already missing
---
I used to run the greenish version of his default skin, but felt it wasn't very scary in the sense of true fear of clowns. So I went with the colorful suit and the red-nosed, empty eyed head. 
---
You lie
---
its called an opossum smh
---
I don’t. 
---
^^^Downvote me for voicing my opinion
---
they never once said all 4 killers were original they said they are working on original and licensed killers and would NEVER pass up a chance to use a licensed killer no matter what they were currently working on
---
No, I need my 2000k blood points from the hatch, I only did one gen
---
LeatherFace doesn't get the speed boost Hillbilly does. I don't think if you lowered Hillbilly's speed while revving it would be as bad. Not that i want it to happen though. 
---
As in Xbox Live? 
---
Spy was my favorite, but I main heavy so I'm bi- nvm. (Also, people seem to have a hard time believing that there are actual heavy mains)
---
So I'm usually not this catty but...
---
&gt; Damn you for nerfing DS, I'm uninstalling. This perk is the only thing that kept us quite about all the killers buffs and new perks to "balance" the game.
---
You remember a time when either side of this game was quiet about buffs to the opposing side? Me neither! 
---
lol i dont know where people are getting this, the devs said in the roadmap video that they were working on original and licensed killers for the year to come and that though they were planning a few original chapters they would still not ever pass up a chance to put in a licensed killer into the game, but if we go by the past 3 releases then we should have gotten a teaser thats for sure, and a ptb should be starting this coming tuesday.
---
Yes, I will let myself win, whether you like it or not
---
I originally thought the new ds change was a buff to DS but now I think its actually a nerf
---
Death before dishonor. 
---
I am not the killer, I am the claud
---
Heaven forbid on a Saturday night I want to play a game with my friends. 
---
I normally refuse standoffs as killer. Too time wasting, this is the first I've done it.
---
As survivor, I just do gens if the killer is gonna babysit the hatch.
