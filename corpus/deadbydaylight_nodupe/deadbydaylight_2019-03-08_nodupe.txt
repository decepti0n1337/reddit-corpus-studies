Don't forget video tape and john's medical files

---
---
The only really bullshit thing about Legion is that he can moonwalk or just look down to disable the chase and the survivor can literally do nothing about going down at that point.
---
If you kill quickly then you won't pip. Discourages tunneling and camping.
---
Spirit Fury and Enduring are enough for the loops btw
---
The gimic in his trailer would never work in-game. Survivors will just get used to it and just sprint away if they see frank without his mask. The killer would have to be able to morph into other survivors for it to ever be a powerful ability.
---
bold words for someone in survivor main downvote range. 
---
Yeah playing him made me realize this game has an extremely loose definition of ‚Äúchase‚Äù
---
Even that takes a long time. It sick for the guy getting chased, but the team can still win.
---
Oh my god the game looks so good on pc!! :((( I can't wait to get one, I've been playing on ps4 and I thought it looked fine but not compared to that lmao rip
---
it just do üòé
---
It all depends. Clown is pretty good. Not a top tier killer but a solid mid-tier. Better than the Doctor at shutting down loops (once you understand how) with a more interesting set of add-ons. I love his add-on that counters Exhaustion perks. No Dead Hard for you, schmuck. Anywho, it all depends. 
---

---
I think Bamboozle is a required perk on every Killer sans Nurse, Legion and Hag for obvious reasons. Sadly, Clown's other 2 perks aren't amazing but there's a chance of finding some kind of symmetry with the other 2. He's got a Santa outfit too which is awesome. 
---
I'm confused if OP owns Clown or not but I don't recommend buying the Doctor if you own Clown. Not unless you really want Monitor and Abuse which is the only good perk the Doctor has. The Doctor is pretty weak in general. 
---
And doesn't have a chance to be completely nullified if someone else uses DS on you.

Bootyblock op pls nerf

Alternatively, a trap does not make you invisible. If you sprint near me while injured I will kill you.
---
Approach? Its a cartoon, not a woman on tinder. I havent read any lore on this killer yet so now i have to google 'plague toe' and filter the results. Larry just wanted to make some folks giggle baby.

IMO Spirit is the funnest killer in the game and is good enough to rank up with, perk wise franklin's demise and make your choice are also pretty good.
---
I won't abandon her, I'm a p3 kate with 2 $11 each cosmetics unlocked. Yes the cosmetics really are $11 for one outfit. Lol

It ain't unbalanced now but I gotta be honest it's more buggy then back then

I have no idea what im looking at

He is a kid, and he is taking it a bit too personally.

If I've had really shitty survivor matches I will play killer and run in circles stalking to give someone an easy game, makes me feel better. 
---
But i need to blindly run into tall grass &gt;:(
---
Tbh I think it's just a bug. I mean it is PTB. And on the clown map there was this amaze-balls locker that spawned right underneath the second floor of the center building.

This community is toxic, if you‚Äôre repairing gens and helping people when it makes sense then you‚Äôre doing a good job chief.

Self imposed rule is like being forced to call a transgender person by their imposed gender, I'm with Ben Shapiro on this one.

I know it's not intentional, but that üëã "kill" in small print above women and below respect made me laugh
---
Spooky Myers is great, I never make it out but it's always fun, Legion however just makes me DC. I was never a big DC guy, also didn't care about it for a long time now but nowadays i do it so much, legion is an instant DC. The one time I didn't I regretted it because my team was a sack of potatoes and the killer was moonwalking.
---
Thanks lol
---
I suppose I thought that was like, the bare minimum requirement lol. 
---
I guess I'm in a mix of anger and confusion from the lack of what was expected. I wasn't sure if certain characters had hard expectations or not.
---
They're Ok, Just Not The Best As Ambush Isn't Really Useful
---
I didn't mean to say chase &gt;.&gt;
---
isnt that kind of the goal though.  they werent bad games either. lasted a decent amount and played well. i guess playing the plauge might impact one of my emblems as well since injuring with vile purge doesnt give me points for hitting.. 
---
Seen it before. I find it hilarious. 
---
If you want facts check steamcharts website and search dead by daylight. The game has around 18k players active daily. 
---
I don't want none of you bitches playing Super Freddy when he gets buffed.
---
*cries in corner*
---
It looks really neat. I hope people get on so i can play it more
---
The game doesn't treat them as getting damaged when they turn broken, it does not give you a speed burst. The power just "turns" them broken. If they hit you before you get broken then yes!
---
Her damaging version of the puke stream will give you a speed burst though!
---
I'm 25.
---
Just played against a camping doctor that said he was 40. And he was rank 4. Can't wait for the new emblem system to rank him back down to 15 lol
---
Lol, this post is hilarious, look at all these dumbos not seeing that it's Freddy haha!
---
Someone else spawned as a hook
---
If you read it like a book (left &gt; right, top &gt; bottom), then it‚Äôs ‚ÄúRespect me [,] kill women.‚Äù 
---
It made me laugh. 
---
I used to like him, now even his facial expressions creep me out, in the latest PTB footage on YouTube it's seriously off putting how he saphes his mouth, it sounds weird but if you watch it half way through you'll get it what I'm talking about, it's hilarious and creepy at the same time, like dude literally so full of himself he is physically unable to hide it.
---
I welcome changes to make it harder to rank but the killer changes don't feel quite right. I've had 4k games with good chases and gen pressure and just barely safetied. I think it's a step in the right direction, just needs some tweaking.
---
Are you really telling me there is NO audio queue when someone gets cleansed ?! It is literally the most loud noise in the game, other than when The Plague picks the corruption herself.
---
Of course. Only real survivors use pharmacy
---
STILL FUCKING UNABLE TO GET KILLER GAMES WITHIN A REASONABLE TIMEFRAME, A FEW DAYS AGO MY GAME CONNECTED FINE FOR A BIT AND I THOUGHT HEY MY BUG WAS FIXED, BUT NOW THAT I WANNA GET THE DLCS ITS SUDDENLY FUCKED AGAIN AND I CANT FIND ANY SURVIVORS FOR 15 MINUTES OR MORE 
---
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
---
I swear, I faced those two before.  They both DCed xD
---
I use it because I noticed I only need to heal once or twice and I never bring items in anyway because I‚Äôm cheap
---
I second this. So much of a second that I‚Äôm a third!
---
He is saying they saw the killer down there but instead of doing gens they went over to the killer shack above the basement where he was hooked and waited. Meaning he died for nothing since no gens were done
---
The Leatherface was playing toxic. The survivors knew based on his perks that he was being camped.  Instead on doing gens and getting the fuck out of there, they crouched around and he died. They were waiting for a moment to save that wouldn‚Äôt ever come.
---
I know, I‚Äôm well aware Legion can be gen rushed, and I‚Äôm not expecting Legion to change, I‚Äôm only stating that Legion takes basically everything away from survivors and the chases are just Legion hitting survivor then survivor running until Legion gets power back, Legion catching up then repeat for a lil bit, Legion takes all the fun out of the fun part of the game, maybe you should try and actually understand what people are complaining instead of just calling people names.
---
Within reason. Good survivors stop healing and just do gens it seems. Going after the healthy guy works but there simply isnt enough ways to make it beneficial to go do that. They're at full hp so unless you happened to catch up with them just as they finish the unhook animation....usually going after the weaker guy would be more useful.
---
The only time I go after the full hp guy is when I'm in the situation I mentioned above where I get the first hit while they are unhooking and they cant get far enough away before I get the second (effectively swapping places on the hook). Or if I have an instant down.
---
If there was actually room to run perks that promote swapping targets then you would see more of it.
---
As it stands though Make your choice is only good on high mobility killers. Most killers dont have an on demand instant down (or maybe it's up only during times when you arent about to punish a bad unhook). And not many other perks benefit going after other people. Bbq keeps getting more ways to counter it, hex devour hope is a hex perk so good luck keeping it on the field, I guess save the best for last benefits hitting the other guy since you can machine gun them down with less animation lock of wiping your blade?
---
But that really doesnt matter bc killers have an effective 3 perks after ruin, less if the killer has other perks that are simply too good not to take like M&amp;A on Myers. It's difficult to fit in perks that are great for going after the guy who wasnt just unhooked without giving up what are essentially better perks or ones that allow you to get a bigger benefit rather than a playstyle change of going after the unhookee rather than the unhooked.
---
Starting with this week, get bamboozle from the shrine. It‚Äôs one of the best chase perks
---
I find them both equally as toxic, but PC might just edge out due to the chat box, where everyone can type post game. 
---
On console, you kinda have to go out of your way to send one person a message, and that's assuming their account allows them to receive messages. So you might not see the toxic behavior as often.
---
Although, on my Xbox, I received a voice message from a kid saying, "Your rank 5? You should be, like, rank 500!" So, take that as you will.
---
Appreciated. Admittedly it was a backhanded jab at killers but the main point of that part of my post was the question at the end. When will it stop? When will they be happy? To use a hyperbole, if everyone spawned with broken status and already on their last hook, would the killer community still echo their complaints about how stressful and skilled they are? 
---
Because I personally think they would, and it needs to stop already. The state if killers isnt what it was a year ago, it's time to move on.
---
Now that I see this close, I just realize those pustules are the exact same texture I used on my term project for animation class. Except on a cat butt.
---
Huh.

Jesus, I'm not saying the meme or this picture is mine. I'm just saying the way the picture is used was used first by me and I'm not a troll

---
Where is this?
---
Fix the current hit boxes and I think the game is in a perfect spot
---
Not saying I disagree with you but what would be so bad about having another a tier killer?
---
Respect to the killer 
---
I let them live, but only under some conditions. 
---
1. They didn‚Äôt have decisive strike
---
2. They didn‚Äôt have decisive strike
---
3. They didn‚Äôt do anything to anger me during the game like farming teammates, blinding me at EVERY pallet, or using decisive strike
---
4. They‚Äôre not Claudette
---
5. They‚Äôre not Claudette 
---
I like the characters and map well enough, and the killer seems fairly strong. She could also benefit from the Thanatophobia buff a lot, incentivizing survivors to cleanse themselves.
---
The perks (and perk adjustments) are however underwhelming again.
---
Poised is about the only one that is good at what it does, but that doesn't mean it's a good perk. Dance With Me is just more reliable, since you can control its timing. I do like Poised, but it would need a little more than it currently has. Head On is just a meme-tier gimmick. The 3-second condition has to be removed; having to trade in a sprint perk - the most valuable survivor perks in the game - for a locker stun perk that comes at the risk of getting grabbed (and might also be affected by Enduring) is more than enough of a downside. Head On only has any slot-worthiness whatsoever if it can reliably be used mid-chase. Solidarity is just situational and low in value. The conversion rate should be 100% - even then it would not be a particularly strong perk.
---
Dark Devotion is a gimmick. Not having a terror radius for a period of time can be beneficial, sure, but it's nowhere near consistent in value, and having to hit your Obsession for it just makes it ridiculously unreliable. I think Dark Devotion should make whoever you hit become your Obsession, and activate its effect. With a 1 minute cooldown, perhaps, and only if you hit a non-Obsession survivor. Infectious Fright was nerfed already, as you don't get auras anymore. It also specifies basic attacks. It's only viable on Nurse. It should just be reverted to show auras, and also proc on ability downs. Corrupt Intervention doesn't do a lot for you. Survivors can either hide the timer out, merely delaying the game start for both sides, or they can work other gens if you do find and are occupied with any 1 survivor. I think Corrupt Intervention should be a Hex perk, and the generators should only become unblocked once the Hex is broken.
---
Rip, well thats lame as fuck, the attack takes awhile to charge and slows you down. A shame was really interested in the playstyle the perk would have promoted, guess its back to mori's and tunneling...
---
Just got a 4k with 2 gens left, I didn't tunnel or camp. I fucking black pipped. The new ranking is broke.
---
Nah, thank *you* for sharing it! 
---
Devour Hope is extremely fun to play, but it will get cleansed in few seconds 99% of the time. Save the Best for Last and Bamboozle are also good.
---
That can be true, mostly after the rank resets, but I definitely run into better players at rank 1 than rank 10-15.  
---
Most people aren't boosted or deranked, at least that I've noticed.  Most people just play the game.
---
It should be 5%
---
If you're playing Billy/Nurse/Spirit you don't really need ruin.
---
Make your choice is only really decent on Hag and Nurse, as Hillbilly already has a reliable instadown.
---
The way I do things in my games is that I adjust the level of how sweaty I am depending on the state of the match. If it's 5-3 gens I'll focus on the unhooker and let the other guy actually get to play the videogame. Once it's 1-2 gens I adjust accordingly. I think this awards me and others most points and makes the match more enjoyable for everyone.
---
Plus I don't like being a dick.
---
This is an amazing drawing! And an amazing comment section! Kudos to you and this wholesomeness!
---
No joke one time this dude hit me up on a dating app and he had a scat fetish (it was in his bio). I asked him why and he said because it was the kinkiest in his mind. I told him I was into weird stuff too and personally loved the bags of popcorn that had caramel and cheddar in them. He told me I was fucking disgusting.
---
You are amazing as always!

Daddy Myers can stalk me anytime.

That was when I decided to try nurse

I DON'T LIKE PLAYING THE KILLER! BUT I DO IT BECAUSE I GET 20,000 BP FOR A GAME AS KILLER AND 8,OOO FOR A GAME AS SURVIVER! (I SUCK, I KNOW...) GIVE THE SURVIVORS SOME MORE BP PER MATCH!
---
Why did people downvote you lmao you're the only one with the actual answer here. Steam went down and since DBD uses Steam servers it went down also.

Don't play super head on as pig. Other notes aside, she's one of the best killers at switching targets and catching people off guard. It's why a lot of people use Make Your Choice on her. It puts a lot of confusion into survivors about whether you'll stay chasing one survivor, or go back to the hook, or track down someone trying to get a trap off, etc. Also you can benefit from tracking perks like Spies from the Shadows or Surveillance, since you can home in on the person you're tracking without them knowing you're there, or thinking you don't know they are there.
---
Clown caused some issue for a little while after he came out but he‚Äôs been fine recently. Lag in general sounds like no reason to me 
---
Who is it the best on? And is it good on all killers?
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt expect hatch from literally any other killer. But if you pick Legion especially with Franks, you know you‚Äôre being toxic.
---
As for bamboozle, who is it the best on? And is it good on all killers?
---
Your fetish is popcorn with caramel and cheddar? That's... sexy.
---
***YOUR LOADING SCREEN IS NOW FROZEN*** S-H-I-T
---
I think her power is pretty ambitious and fun it kind of changes the game
---
Report the killer after the match, take video evidence and submit that on the official website through a support ticket. Without both, nothing can be done.
---
So in this case, nothing can be done.
---
The killers are and always will be the masters
---
He litteraly said "Veredict on day one: She is bad". Also wouldn't you get upset if survivors flashlight save someone when you are the killer? Cause if you don't congratulations because you are the calmest killer that exists. Im pretty sure most people would get upset about it.
---
Welcome to literally every game before the loop changes where your only hope to beat an infinite loop was bloodlust, and you lost chase every 3 seconds.
---
 Played in the PTB last night. Playing as the Plague on Yamaoka estate. Hook a survivor in the estate basement and go outside to the "being worked on gen" and start looking around. Low and behold I find a survivor and I give chase. She's keeping me in the area. I hit her and she decided to finally take off across the map. At that point I see another survivor go into the estate so I break off and go after him. Sure enough, he goes into the basement and unhooks. Hit injured guy and put him back on hook again. No one comes to get him. After chat is "you're a streamer AND a camper!?!?".
---
 You can't see my perspective, you just hear the heartbeat and think I'm camping when, in fact, it's your fellow teammates who are keeping me in the area.
---
i am an ancient relic
---
Around 50 hours, apparently. I'm just over 100 hours and have nearly gotten 18000 shards total.

Hmm Mad Max?
---
Interesting theory, but I‚Äôm pretty sure The Nightmare is based off Edward Scissorhands.
---
I thought he was based on Edward Scissorhands tho? I mean just look at em

I just want prestige to give you the bloody version of all the base cosmetics for each character, so you can choose which you use it on.

\*Myers finely but forcefully minces an onion*
---
\*Nurse surgically butchers a rack of ribs, before lovingly caressing each of them with a spice rub*
---
\*Frank just fucking hacks apart a head of cabbage*
---
\*Clown peruses a bag of baby carrots, carefully selecting which one he's going to slice next*
---
I have 2000 hours in the game and have nearly everyone p3 50 as both survivor and killer. Also been to rank 1 as both sides through-out all of the ranking changes. That said I mainly play killer now when I do play as I don't have a swf group anymore. A properly coordinated swf group runs the entire match, mori's alongside a strong killer like billy, the spirit or the nurse turn the position of power back to where is belong, FIRMLY IN THE KILLERS HANDS.
---
That said beyond the ptb test I did to test the new killer I haven't been playing as much due to frustrations about the games core issues. You can try to tell me that following a mathematically solid set of actions isn't good or that Mori's are overpowered but until they remove the gigantic advantage swf has over solo's and killers this game won't ever be balanced.
---
Constant wall hacks, extra perk slots, real-time communication updates, what pallets are available, what have been used, what killer is it, where the totems are among other things were never intended. The game was never designed with the survivors having free access to ANY of those at all. 
---
I thought the plague was the new killer? Who's that chick? What's her power? Why is she freddy's favorite?
---
*Team Rocket's blasting off agaaaaain\~!*
---
hahaha hah I get it cause she makes you sick and she has vomit hahahhaha
---
I always considered teabagging at the exit gates as a "good game see you later, nerd" type of thing. Like a friend ribbing another friend. I don't get mad when killers moonwalk around or go crazy in front of me when I'm last one hooked.
---
First off, they should expect nothing from you except 1 gen and staying alive, or rescuing others as much as they rescued you. Anything more is charity.
---
That being said, 'Memes per character':
---
Dwight: Hides in lockers all game
---
Claudette: Tryhard, sneaky, often plays dirty against the killer. Killers tend to hate them.
---
Jake: Sabotage, sneaky, tends to be not found very often, but not as aggressive or chase-intensive as claudette.
---
Nea: Toxic scumbags. Also good at chases. Loves Nea-specific perks.
---
David: The man, the myth, the legend. Will get you off that hook even if he has to hook himself to do it. Maybe a little TOO aggressive.
---
Bill: The man never gives up, and never DCs. Bill players are usually workhorses that get things done.
---
Quentin: Doesn't exist. No one plays him.
---
Adam: The man's an enigma. He MIGHT be a pebble user, or a DS user, or a medic. The man hides a new secret up his coat every game.
---
Laurie: SCUMBAGS. She brought DS, therefore she must DIE. (I'm kidding of course)
---
Feng: The master of disaster, the lord of the horde, a Feng player not only is the master of chase and loops, but also somehow can lose the killer more than most characters. Somewhat aggressive as well, tends to do gens near killer to be brave.
---
Jane: I mean she's hot, I guess.
---
Kate: Kate players have shown themselves to be pretty cool. No particular memes here, but they tend to bring good builds, play for the win, and look out for the team.
---
Ace: Luck, luck all day. Will try to yank themselves off the hook. Constantly places trust in chests, luck addons, memey strats.
---
Detective Tapp: Wishes he was Claudette. Good perks though.
---
Jeff: Jesus.
---
What
---
Just DC. That always solves it
---
Useless on Nurse, imo also on hag and huntress, maybe Legion, because they have powers that can counter vaults pretty easily. Especially good on Myers, in tier 3 you will be vaulting with insane speed :)
---
I don‚Äôt really like doing that often
---
Luckily, for most kids, they have all the time in the world to go through every hoop and bound.
---
This shit is back again?!?
---
hahaha it's a good joke well done op
---
Well if you only need one pallet then why does it matter if they use the rest
---
Thanks?
---
__hahaha hah I get it cause she makes you sick and she has vomit hahahhaha__
---
no problem /s
---
Oh ok now that it‚Äôs bold I understand
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain no one here has attacked Monto. Lol
---
Lmao
---
and if the killer leaves the pallet or i happen to mess up am i going to run back to the exact pallet if it's across the map lmao
---
This made me laugh and feel better after tonight. 
---
Thanks, friend. :)
---
If you're talking about Infectious Fright it's not a nerf, it was the incorrect version of the perk they released which they've fixed.
---
Honor aside, do not try to fool killers. Many can figure out if you have a luck build or, even worse, Deliverance. If you think you can run a luck build, jump off, and the killer will let you go... yeah, they know.
---
Unfortunately I didn't record it
---
We all know what he would choose come on lmao 
---
What wall hacks? 
---
Survivors have more perks yes, but the killer's perks are on average stronger to combat that. 
---
&gt;Where the totems are
---
People who play enough know the locations of the totems already.
---
If your argument for using overpowered stuff is that you need them to win against swf then I'm sorry to tell you but despite your hours you aren't really that good at the game. A good killer can definitely beat a good team, especially if they are playing Nurse or Spirit. You don't need moris for that, moris are just easy mode as you are really only playing half of the match and it's silly to think they are anywhere near necessary.
---
The killer is already the power role in this game, survivors have strength in numbers while the killer is strong on their own. You talk about the need for balance but before that mention that the killer is supposed to have the advantage over the 4 survivors. If it's supposed to be balanced shouldn't they be equal by that logic?
---
Dammit, I just wanked for the night, too!  Ugh.  The things I put up with...
---
I'm not the best pig player but first let's go over perk builds. Enduring is great( ds and pig has no reliable counter to pallets) so you're going to eat a lot of pallets. BBQ is amazing for pretty much all killers (blood points and tracking). Ruin because it's ruin and the 4th perk is kind of up to you but here's some good choices: nurses calling, save the best for last, sloppy butcher, brutal strength, make your Choice, bamboozle and many others.
---
As a pig player, your most important priority is to use your RBT wisely. If you struggle to keep map pressure, using your reverse bear traps early on is a good option. If you find yourself always in the end game, save your reverse bear traps because they're super strong in the end game. In most games, I suggest you use 2-3 bear traps and leave 1-2 for the end game. You have to assess your situation and use your bear traps accordingly. For example: downed a survivor when 5 gens are still up? Using a reverse bear trap is a good idea. Struggling to down people in a match and they're flying through gens? Save your bear traps for later. If you tend to tunnel the first guy you down, don't use your reverse bear trap on the first guy you down since you're just going to chase after them anyway so using a bear trap is pointless.
---
Her crouch ability (imo) is not super helpful except in the beginning of the game. It makes you slower which in turn affects your map pressure. You can however use it to mind game some specific loops and chases but it's overall not super helpful.
---
Good luck on your pig adventures and don't forget to oink! 
---
All the rank 1 salt when I 4k as freddy is making me crazy!!!! 
---
You made me giggle, Larry.  ;w;)7
---
For me, most claudes and fengs are immersed, davids love to be in chases but always die, aces are sexy, nea is the most competent survivor, jake and dwight are gen jockeys, meg is a runner, and dlc survivors are just people who just like the movies
---
I do friendly trash talk on my streams, but also make sure to note when I killer catches me, and compliment when they mindgamed me or something similar. But yes, many streamers are... not very nice.
---
Same here, I've enjoyed every match I've played as her; I'm just uncertain about the exact level of power she actually has and whether the healing from the fountains is a good balance, not good enough, or too strong.
---
That makes more sense, still sucks though.
---
I'd at least wish they'd update the Trapper's and Wraith's moris, they're so *boring*.
---
Hehe ok np, I was worried :D
---
Enduring and Spirit Fury are great. You just missed Ruin in the shrine like three weeks ago, which sucks. I'd focus Hag anyway since her other perks aren't bad either. Third Seal is good for slug builds and Devour Hope is just fun.
---
I have been looking for a new way to have fun playing DBD. Right now I am seeing how much stuff I can take from the games without spending any bloodpoints on perks, items or offerings. So far it has been a blast to do.
---
Not my proudest fap lads
---
It's a known bug IIRC.
---
Don't you mean, "GROIN, the extra mile" ?
---
No, I didnt camp, lol. I like getting more than one kill, and i can't quite do that with a tent pitched next to a hook.
---
I kinda want to go back to the old days it had so much magic back then, and it was also completely broken and so much fun
---
Agreed. Survivors are easily more toxic. I only play killer cause I got tired of being the sacrificial lamb that‚Äôs not swf and get killed on first hook 70% of the time. 
---
Also, peep the contradiction. You shouldn‚Äôt be bothered by t-bagging, but how dare you tunnel/camp making me hop in my feelings and blow up your inbox with unreasonable disrespect instead of taking the t-bag like a man and just move on to the next game. 
---
Play the game as you see fit. I bought the game to play how I want, not how you want me to play
---
Pfft. Good luck doing that flawlessly. You're gonna get downed for that if the killer's on you. 
---
og dbd gang represent
---
 Oh man I love people like you 
---
please tell me how
---
Pathetic camper.
---
9/10 joined at the same time or wearing similar outfits and/or gamer tags.
---
First a couple of things, 1 I don't NEED a mori at all, you right. If I really want to sweat one a team ill just pick omega blink nurse and slug them to death, thats besides the point though. Secondly, survivors have been and still are to a lesser extent now THE POWER role. This is the complete opposite of how this type of game is SUPPOSED to be designed.
---
 In a 4v1 asymmetrically balanced game the 1 IS SUPPOSED to be the power role, not the survivors. Finally on your last point, while in theory, 4 survivor perks should equate to around 1 killer perk when properly balanced THAT ISN'T THE REALITY. 
---
Go ahead and compare unrelenting as a single killer perk and try to tell me its ANYWHERE fucking NEAR Ds in terms of match inpact/power level. Got nerfed after a year of bitching and preposed reworks? Sure fine let's go over another, sprint burst vs pwyf. 1 that requires you to invest time and meet conditions for a minimum boost in overall speed that is also lost when you do your fucking job, or a mechanic that ALWAYS buys you a minimum of 10 extra seconds EVERY chase and makes any point on the map completely devoid of deadzones. Go ahead and compare those, tell me which seems stronger to you? Now factor in that it can happen 4 times per each survivor. 
---
Outside of a few outliers, the vast majority of survivor perks are far superior to killer perks. That's before we even get into swf who effectively gets a free spine chill, alert, empathy, kindred, bond, openhanded, object of obsession(without the downsides),small game among any others I'm sure iv forgot. Worse yet unlike a mori that isn't of rare quality and is completely free to anyone who chooses to utilize it.
---
The long and short of it is simple, while you can definitely beat an organized swf team with a strong killer without a mori if your good it isn't worth the hassle. Plus some of the fucking mori animations are awesome. Besides, what else am I supposed to spend my constant 1 mill+ bp's on, I already have around 50+ of everything on everyone. When you play for as long as I have it becomes allot less about trying to prove a point and just having fun friend.
---
Because let's face it, no one wants to deal with a P3 Squadette or the dreaded No Mither Sabo Squad. 
---
Your choices are to waste perk slots or lobby dodge. 
---
This is just pure speculation but considering the video the dev's recently released had then consulting ancient sumerian pictographs it could be she is speaking that?  But since that's a dead language with no native speakers there is no way of really knowing.  Would take someone far better than I to know for sure.
---
I mean...it works every stream without fail.
---
I don't care if people use my name to find my channel or not. Zero impact on my life. But if does stand to reason that if I get rewarded with follows and donations because of it--why wouldn't I?
---
You can counter flashlights. But really start to worry if they're all carrying toolboxes. 
---
I've been trying to do the same thing, but I getting "EAC client cannot be instantiated". How did you bypass this? Or was it just luck?
---
Why do you think teabagging is affecting someone's game on the same level as tunneling or camping? 
---
If you tunnel a guy out of the game, they don't get to play the game. If someone teabaggs you, literally nothing happens. People who get so bothered by it just have really fragile egos.
---
I dislike vertical maps, if you define it like The Game. It's impossible when facing the doctor, as the terror radius is always everywhere.
---
Skin is burnt imo
---
THANK YOU 
---
She makes me feel a tad peaky, but I love her (and Jane) 
---
Nah, there's even a DLC where L4D2 survivors meet up with L4D survivors after they've been stationed for about a week.
---
Now that I think about it, people who can understand Sumerian most likely aren't the type to play dbd
---
"Ugh, I've been trying to do gens and escape the map, but I'm dummy thicc and my ass cheeks clapping alerts the killer where I'm hiding" 
---
That too. But the main point I was arguing was swf.
---
I think he is enjoying his wallpaper
---
#SON OF A BITCH
---
FRANKLIN'S HIT DC NEW ANTI INSTA HEAL AND KEY META?
---
yeah thats what i was thing too.  a 4k should be a pip.
---
I was hoping Suzie might 'escape' the entity and become a survivor. Would be cool af.
---
Survivor main. I think I‚Äôve escaped three after unhooking myself and none of them were a result of the killer letting me go. At this point I never expect the killer to ‚Äúrespect‚Äù the 4%, BUT I also don‚Äôt think the killer needs to. Chances are if I manage to 4%, the game is at a point where it‚Äôs basically lost and my only option is to try to escape the hook myself. If it works out and I somehow escape, whether it be by my own means or the killer letting me go, it‚Äôs more of a nice surprise than anything. I can‚Äôt really be upset if I get smacked back down again, at that point the killer has clearly put in work and outplayed me enough that my ass is hooked and my whole team is dead. Basically tl;dr 4% rule is nonsense and the killer isn‚Äôt obligated to let anyone live regardless of circumstance. 
---
Nah he‚Äôs just lightskin 
---
I'm super positive in my games and play fair but still get called a faggot at the end of the game because I hooked people. Some people just want to be miserable.
---
Not true at all:
---
1)Dribbling is a Counter. This can be done very regularly
---
2)Enduring is a Counter-reduces the time DS stuns you for
---
3)The Clown poisoning the ground is a counter. Very easy to catch back up to
---
4)Agitation is a Counter. Non Obsession DS users often won't even get the chance to use it
---
5)Other players on your team having it is often a counter since you will regularly not even get to use it
---
6)Slugging is a counter. Can't DS if you dont pick them up
---
7)Rancor is kind of a counter. You can just auto kill them once last gen is done
---
8)Unnerving Presence is a Counter. Makes the Skill Check much harder to hit which can make them miss
---
9)Iron Grasp somewhat counters DS. Non Obsession DS users have harder time getting chance
---
10)Even positioning such as being above stairs so they drop in to basement counters DS. Good luck using DS when you drop into basement
---
I'm really looking forward to it with Trapper to see what he can do there. 
---
The clown should have an add-on that increases the sound volume of his laugh by 200%. That would teach the survivors a lesson or two for sure
---
Toxic yes. More survivor based though only because of the 4-1 odds.  Plus swf.  The younger kids try to impress their schoolmates with in game jukes talking over comms then when it goes wrong only way they know how to keep face it to try to trash you. Agree on both sides though. I main survivor and rarely jump on killer just because of the hate I receive. As a killer it seems that you cannot do anything right in the game unless they escape, but then you are called a noob. 
---
Here‚Äôs my tip on how to play console nurse: don‚Äôt 
---
Yes, it works. 
---
HADDONFIELD TRAPS INTENSIFY
---
Good luck.
---
Those are pretty good
---
Thanks for the feedback guys
---
It never should be a rule. It's a second chance in and of itself and in a game where the killers objective is to kill, there's no reason for them to go against that. 
---
That being said, I've let people go from it before, but only because they didn't do anything to irritate me throughout the match and they were the last one left. It really depends on how generous I'm feeling. 
---
Do u sell them?
---
Have you... have you not seen Wretched Shop? No shitting, that's an infinite too. And it's much harder to cut short than Haddonfield, where so long as you play Trapper they have no choice but to either not use the loop whatsoever or fall for it. Paired with an Iridescent Stone? Bet your ass that loop ain't happening. 
---
IF YOU PLAY LEATHERFACE I ASSUME YOU WILL CAMP ME INTO THE NEXT LIFE
---
Weird, I thought the nightmare was based off of Michael Myers.
---
Lmao  no content for u
---
I do not, I bought them! 
---
ORK ORK ORK THE PORK 
---
&gt;if survivors could enter the Dream World voluntarily to receive a benefit (like increased action speed) at the risk of being vulnerable to Freddy
---
The first part wouldn't make sense, because it's the dreamworld; it wouldn't make sense to do stuff faster while you're asleep (as if survivors needed to do gens even faster anyway). On top of that, it's not like Freddy's the type of killer who could take advantage of that in such a way as to make it a legitimate downside (he can only chase one at a time, after all, and has no more mobility than any other basic 115% movement speed killer).
---
Oh really? Where from? Been wanting to collect some dbd stuff. Wish theyd make figures as well.

WHERE TF IS YOUR CLOWN LOYALTY
---
You might be on to something here. I would like to present some evidence: The perk Fire Up may or may not be a reference to the fact that The Nightmare, just like Freddy, has a rather burnt appearance. Perhaps it's part of The Nightmare's origin story?
---
\&gt;Fire Up: Each tier grants a stackable 2/2.5/3% action speed bonus.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Am I reading this incorrectly or are they \*nerfing\* Fire Up?
---
The best counter: if you have a clicky clicky, just slug them. If they use unbreakable, then slug them and let them bleed out. THEN FEAST IN THEIR SALT UNTIL YOU GET CARDIAC ARREST.
---
You are wrong. Every Map has a 53% or Higher Kill Rate which means the Killer is favored on EVERY. SINGLE. MAP. IN. THE.GAME.
---
Even the worst Killer, Freddy has a 47% Kill Rate.  Every other Killer is basically 50%-60% Kill Rate. Even at the very best ranks these numbers hold true
---
Your argument is asinine 
---
1) Enduring reduces the stun, they still get off the shoulder. 
---
2) dribbling only works if a hook is nearby, otherwise you will keep dropping and they‚Äôll get off your shoulder
---
3) The clown‚Äôs bottles still give you the 4 second stun, they still get off, and that only ‚Äúfixes‚Äù that issue for one killer, even though it doesn‚Äôt. 
---
4) Agitation is not at all a counter and you are a dunce for thinking so, you still have the stun and the get out of jail free card. 
---
 5) that relies entirely on the tier guys running it, which doesn‚Äôt always happen. Also, it isn‚Äôt a counter. 
---
6) Slugging isn‚Äôt a counter, they‚Äôll never get hooked and you‚Äôll lose out on a kill. 
---
7) again, isn‚Äôt a counter, it‚Äôs waiting for them to finish all the gens just for one kill, and by the time you kill them they others will get out. 
---
8) Again, it isn‚Äôt a counter, it just makes it harder. If they succeed it, they still get off and you‚Äôre still stunned. 
---
9) Iron grasp does nothing for you against DS, only Walmart DS and even then it doesn‚Äôt counter it, just delays it. 
---
10) That...isn‚Äôt a counter. Your still stunned, they still get out, only now they‚Äôre lower than you, and if they have Balanced Landing they get a speed boost. 
---
Would be more worried if I'd been playing this game regularly for a year without noticing
---
What is he getting turned on by? I don‚Äôt understand.
---
I got them off eBay! hard to find but they‚Äôre definitely worth it (:  
---
I'M GLAD YOU FEEL THIS WAY TOO!
---
You don't really need omegablink either, tho it sure makes things easier. Default Nurse with perks is more than enough if you are good at her. It's not besides the point, it proves that the killer is still the power role when both of the sides are playing properly.
---
In 4v1 the one is supposed to be stronger than one of the four, not all of them. I never said the 4 should be the power role, I clearly said they are supposed to be equal, which in my opinion they are in DBD. If they are working together the 4 is supposed to be as strong as the 1 and whoever uses their strengths better and makes smarter decisions should be the winner.
---
You are poisoning the well from the start by comparing a useless perk like Unrelenting to pre-rework DS. You should compare it to something like Technician, as they both make up for the fuck ups of the user.
---
&gt;pwyf vs sprint burst
---
You are comparing a perk that takes time to charge vs an instant reward perk. Maybe compare it to something like Autodidact or Detective's hunch that also works on a token system? 
---
BBQ and chilli, Enduring + spirit fury, bamboozle, Ruin, Whispers, Nurse's calling, the newest screaming perk and gen blocking perk, Noed, pop goes the weasel, all of these are stronger than any of the survivors perks.
---
Small game is literally a learning tool, you don't need a swf to memorise totem spawn locations.
---
I don't agree with mentioning object of obsession or spine chill, those are still useful as you don't have a vision on the killer 24/7.
---
All of the perks you have mentioned that the survivors gain as swf are only in there to help solo survivors and half of them is bad. The 4 in 4v1 is supposed to be able to be working together so them "gaining" the effects of those perk is irrelevant.
---
&gt;it isn't worth the hassle
---
Is it supposed to be easy? From what we've talked before both sides should have equal chances of victory, why would it be easy for the killer to win?
---
I agree that the mori animations are cool and I don't want them removed from the game, just reworked. I don't think ebony mori should be a thing, and I don't like that you can just tunnel the guy off first hook and remove them from the game. People bitch about DS when mori is a hundred times worse.
---
&gt;Just having fun friend
---
I have fun when I get challenging games, I won't give you shit for liking stomps as everyone is different. I'm just pointing out that neither moris or broken add ons are necessary as killers are already the power role. If the devs fix like 4 last existing infinites in the game and removed bloodlust + reworked moris and problematic add ons like iri head, omegablink, syringes, prayer beads then the game would be pretty much balanced to me. Oh also rework Legion and Nurse coz neither of them really play Dead by Daylight.
---
Lower BP gains AND the insane bloodwebs in later levels were a nightmare. 
---
Killer felt difficult to play at every level due to survivor strength instead of just Rank 5 - 1. 
---
Wall vacuums that made you Usain Bolt for 2 seconds.
---
Gens being able to finish solo in 50 seconds (IIRC, can't remember the exact change that made them take longer) and no Ruin.
---
Sabotaging Trappers traps permanently so he became a worse Wraith, but Wraith was actually top tier.
---
What a time to play the game.
---
It's worse when all the pools are corrupted and they reset.
---
This has a 90% chance of being my new wallpaper.
---
If I put my face right up against someone‚Äôs ass at a slightly upward angle it‚Äôs gonna look big. Gtfo with this bs lol. Also, I employ you to look up a 3D render of Nurse. I checked again and from what I can tell Nurse is thiccer. I had the camera below them for both.
---
unfortunately no clown option /: zubsad  
---
I‚Äôve already got my stack so I don‚Äôt see why not. Only time I didn‚Äôt spare someone was when they tried to farm their team. Had to have been my best Huntress snipe.
---
I never defended one side, I clearly said that both of them are equal on being toxic, while you argued that survivors are the more toxic ones.
---
&gt;Agreed. Survivors are easily more toxic.
---
I never told anyone how to act, I just pointed out that tunneling/camping isn't affect someone's game the same way teabagging does and gave my opinion saying that people who get angry because of teabags have fragile egos.
---
But that just isn‚Äôt true. Especially in your given numbers, the 5‚Äô9 person would be the same weight as the taller person (assuming that‚Äôs what you meant by same medical condition) which would likely give them the advantage due to being less dangly and such.

---
I think he needs a begrimed trap and darker traps by default, I enjoy playing him but bubba is where my heart resides
---
Yes, there's always a possibly that the Devs just said "fuck it, time to invent a new disease" ! And you're also right about how the Plague could've been smallpox, but smallpox doesn't cause necrosis and large bulbos like Adiris has on her skin (namely on her neck). Monkeybox isn't endemic to the Babylon region, and nonvenereal syphilis doesn't cause these symptoms.  
---
Believe it or not, the Bubonic plague can have two additional forms than can vary from it's stereotypical form, including Septicemic and Pneumatic. Adiris *at least* became infected with Septicemic Plague because of (1 She cut her toe off and more than likely got an infection that way bc sanitation? in BC times? Preposterous. and (2 The necrosis of her skin, though that may just be in-game edits for aesthetics, is a huge indicator of Septicemic Plague.  
---
Another thing to note is that Adiris came down with a *cough* and *coughed* up phlegm, which would indicate Pneumatic Plague, which is *highly* contagious, and would explain why the plague seemed to spread as rapidly as implied in the lore. It seems as if our side boobs lady got hit with all of the nasties stuff the rats were carrying :) 
---
Definitely not meg (her breathing is loud even when not injured), feng min (not 100% sure) and Claudette 
---
You love your mid tier killers don‚Äôt you?
---
It's more like "can't curse, microsoft will ban me" I legit just got done with a com ban because I called some kid a mongoloid, meanwhile in the chat history he called me a pussy twelve times, did he get flak for it? No.
---
Press x or ‚ñ† and turn ur joystick
---
√Üffect
---
Just the thought of that makes me melt, thanks so much
---
This looks like a really bad rip off of the of Nightmare. OP is probably Nancy.
---
Yes I'm cursed by my taste in lore and looks. Whenever I play Billy I can really tell the difference and it makes me cri. I would play him more often if he got a really cool cosmetic.
---
You can rotate characters on console.
---
Think as the console menu layout as a straight up shitty PC copy/paste. The circle in the middle of the screen is nothing but a cursor. 
---
To rotate characters on PC you press Left Click and move your Mouse. On console all you have to do is press A / X over the character and move your Right Analog. 
---
I dont use omega blink nurse so that example doesn't work. But I do agree sometimes I can be a bit brash at times as I am very competitive. But this is less them 1% of the stream, focus on the 99% of positive attitude.
---
:'(
---
Many people agree with the sentiment that the A tier killers are somewhat overtuned. 
---
I mean the Nation Park look is cool but I can‚Äôt wait until Trapper‚Äôs miner stuff. If you haven‚Äôt seen it it‚Äôs basically My Bloody Valentine stuff.
---
I do better with Freddy than Legion, I feel. They're  both in good places. 
---
:)
---
Ok I‚Äôll just ignore the part where you said killers have fragile egos for letting tbag get to them cause that‚Äôs not defending one side
---
Cheers for the hit of reality a lot of these threads need man, my words are twisted so heavily its almost like I'm reading about another guy.
---
Yeah with that new change it's even less helpful
---
It's literally someone pressing their crouch button repeatedly, it's not affecting your game at all.
---
It's like getting mad coz the killer shakes their head at you or nods. I just find it funny.
---
Yea it looked pretty cool I'll probably get the helm but I think a full miner suit would have been awesome, especially if it had rips and tears in it. We need more trapdaddy nipple
---
Or not care about ranks and play purely for fun.  Depip on purpose.
---
I mean they labeled you wrong, you were being a tunneler.
---
I want it 
---
Honestly steam servers went down like 3 times for me
---
? The new miner Trapper stuff was datamined. It‚Äôs basically a miner‚Äôs gas mask and clothes.
---
Uncultured swine, bamboozle nurse is op. 
---
Swf.  Playing with rank 15 friends in their lobbies.  Plus Claudette is chosen as a first survivor for most because of her race.
---
Well, in the Dream Warriors, their willpower helped them to combat Freddy in the Dream World by lucid dreaming.  This could be a reflection of that - perhaps, as an idea, survivors could find "spark of hope" in the Dream World that spawns randomly and when consumed grants them a temporary buff that both makes them visible to Freddy (because he's the lord of the Dream World) and also gives them an action speed bonus.
---
Meanwhile, Freddy could be buffed considerable - increased action speed, movement speed, and perhaps even in some circumstances have survivors in the Dream World debuffed with Exposed.  The Dream World could also be made more dangerous - Nightmare Generators that explode when a skill check is triggered, Nightmare Closets that trap the survivors and force them to make skill checks to escape, Nightmare Crows that will latch on and caw around survivors constantly.
---
Maybe, even, the entire game could take place in the Dream World - no requirement to put anyone to sleep, but the "spark of hope" that spawns in the Dream World gives the survivors powerful abilities while Freddy gets significant bonuses against them.  Maybe they could even "Pull Freddy Out" to pull him into the real world for a time, where he gets no bonuses whatsoever, and there's a duration before he can go back into the dream realm.
---
Thus demonstrating, that, I indeed didn't understand her in that first play session.
---
she does! Really enjoying her now haha
---
That Amanda one gives me life
---
She is really fun!
---
I was not thinking when I added that last sentence. Won‚Äôt catch me lackin again
---
F
---
My idea of a revamp is to make it so he moves fast like billy but he has a power meter for how long he can use it and has better control.
---
Basically make it so it‚Äôs easier to down people with it but he can‚Äôt abuse it as much and can‚Äôt get the same map pressure that billys chainsaw has as leather face has to wait for his to recharge which can screw him over
---
Much love mate.
---
Also, I request you do Myers or legion. I‚Äôd love to see them drawn.
---
i'm not trying to be a jerk, but i think that puts you in the minority. i'd venture a guess that most of the community, killers and survivors both, consider teabagging at the exit gate a toxic behavior.
---
i do sometimes stand at the gate and let the killer hit me out so they get extra bp, depending on game context. that can probably also be considered toxic as well, though.
---
I have grown tremendously because of how much my words and my person gets targeted so in a weird way the "trolls and haters" have actually made me a better man.
---
***TAKE MY MONEY***
---
What‚Äôs her race have to do with anything?
---
Sounds about right 
---
Hey! I wish I could send you the screen record of you saying ‚Äú She‚Äôs a weaker Pig. Even tho the pig isn‚Äôt that strong. ‚Äú 
---
I respect you and your opinion and totally understand that your view point changed. You seem pretty sure about it. Kind of like Tyde Tyme with his Killer tier list. Even tho it‚Äôs his opinion... his opinion was showed as fact. 
---
It‚Äôs just sucks seeing some one with a huge following like you. Saying all these things when you haven‚Äôt even learned her. There‚Äôs a few more clips I can record that makes it sound like what you‚Äôre saying is fact. (Trust me, I know it‚Äôs not fact) it‚Äôs just how you say it. 
---
It‚Äôs like every survivor main that cries about Freddy being OP. It‚Äôs annoying when you hear that or when killer mains say Hag is weak. It‚Äôs irritating. 
---
I saw you‚Äôre doing great with her now.  Which is great to hear! Thanks for the response tho! It‚Äôs cool communicating with you
---
If you are talking about the statistics shown during the Hallowed Blight event, may I remind you that those numbers were taking during an event where people where killing themselves on hook AND dcing bc they couldnt get the plants.
---
I want legion boi first person mori rip
---
uh, i'm a survivor main, and that's not tunneling. that's taking advantage of a free hook. why would they leave the hook if there's someone *right there*?
---
Doctor uses a system specific to him with the madness status effect
---
While he is im treatment mode survivors passively gain madness if they are in his terror radius and will scream if they tier up in madness and will scream randomly if they are in madness tier 3.
---
You can‚Äôt tier down from madness tier 2 and have to snap out of tier 3 to go back to tier 2 to be able to work on generators and heal. 
---
Playing stealthy doesn‚Äôt work against the doctor unless you have calm spirit, calm spirit stops you from screaming when hit by any killer, and more importantly, stops you from screaming when tiering up in madness or from entering a toxic clown mist. You just have to learn to play more aggressively as survivor and get better at looping.
---
For legion, when he hits a survivor who is not deep wounded, he will reveal other nearby survivors for a short time (if the other survivors aren‚Äôt deep wounded already.) Theres not much you can do to play against him. Any legion can down anybody with not much skill, if he hits you enough times with his power eventually you will go down, so you just have to attempt to stun him with pallets to cancel his power.
---
Back when Ruin first came out, it didn't have the failed skillcheck mechanic where it pauses on a Good skillcheck. It would just revert and instantly go back to progressing. 
---
This made the perk very lame to use and *did not* warrant it being a hex perk at the time. 
---
It is currently in a good place and does not require any more changes. 
---
*Delete before embarrassment sets in*
---
That's me saying "got damnit, Jane, I can't see passed yo ass"
---
HEAD ON. APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD.

Anybody have a source for this ? I need the audio lol
---
It's Lisa's Foundry now Evan!
---
Very informative! Thanks!
---
THAT WAS AWESOME, Although when i try to fully commit it doesn't work :(.
---
I don't facecamp either. I understand the risk when I choose to bring ruin
---
Hahaha. This is what I mean. I love how everyone assumes that I don‚Äôt main killer. 
---
Strangely, I'm okay with this.
---
More ebony mori's appear on my bloodweb than ivory ones ):
---
At least he managed to keep his mouth closed.
---
Totally respect that! I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong. It‚Äôs not a make believe world either. It‚Äôs actual things you said. It‚Äôs just frustrating that it SEEMED that you were stating it as fact. That you kept repeating over and over again. 
---
It‚Äôs kind of like

‚Äú DUDE! SHE‚ÄôS GOOD! ‚Äú  lol

NOED Thread #409385
---
Well that would've been nice to include somewhere in the game lol. Thank you.
---
Go watch VODs of streamers playing the PTB or some YouTube videos because reddit is not exaggerating this at all. Whether it is really bugged or not I don‚Äôt know for sure, I think it may be, but I don‚Äôt even know if I have seen anything better than a black pip for survivor or killer. It‚Äôs really bad right now. 
---
Is it even louder than the music in Haddonfield?
---
The smallest is either The Game or The L√©ry's Memorial Institute ( hospital ) and the largest are both Swamp maps and the Rotten Fields
---
Prestige Hat, Black/Maroon common top, Lunar pants.
---
this is so true though. So many people on this sub think dcing is perfectly ok. Its such a twat behavior. Oh legion? DC!!! shit makes me cringe 
---
I play him almost exclusively with quick dream transition addons. 
---
Survivors falling asleep in 3 or 3.5 seconds instead of 7 is much more satisfying.  Plus Red Paint Brush lowers his terror radius so severely that it's like almost like having wall hacks all the time. 
---
This is AMAFENZING, I love it. I'd never be able to draw something this beautiful
---
Has he tried doing generators since trapper won‚Äôt move from the hatch
---
Do you want me to type a title explaining that everything I say is opinion and not fact lol. I say thousands of times that its just my opinion and you are entitled to yours.
---
Everyone is just going to ignore how HIS connection flamed out after the match was over? 
---
Downing and rehooking the person who got unhooked in front of you is literally tunneling.
---
&gt;why would they leave the hook if there's someone right there?
---
I mean I just down the unhooker. In the scenario they described, I have already won as the killer. The survivors' poor decisions told me that. Therefore the only question is whether to win while being toxic or win while not being toxic.
---
She is naturally camouflaged. 
---
Lol. This is so dum. We need a guy grom BHVR just to smack some sense into this guy. Freddy was a bad guy... the killers in dbd are the good guys. 
---
This would've been awesome
---
We love badass battle stripe Jeff
---
Oh, I get it. Took me a moment to realize you haven't insulted us Trappers...
---
Just because people dont get a joke doesnt make it a woosh. Its if they still dont get it after you explain it to them.
---
Fair
---
Yeah, that's switching targets and is the opposite of tunneling.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, dcing is a dick move. But Legion is quite literally bad for the games health. The literal embodiment of a killer made to be cancer. I don‚Äôt wanna go in depth on why he‚Äôs terrible because it‚Äôs self explanatory. Tbh I couldn‚Äôt care less if they dc against a legion, at least it proves something to the devs that he/she needs fixing.
---
I tend to wanna use self care over getting killed because I‚Äôve had too many potato survivors try and heal me out in the open or worse, in front of the hook they just took me off, so when the kill ultimately comes back to check the area I get tunnelled.
---
I find that if another survivor does the point emote to somewhere we can hide, I‚Äôm usually more willing to follow and let them heal. If someone runs away from you just let them go, don‚Äôt put yourself in more danger.
---
Mine wasnt.  Woopsie
---
I wish Legion would leave forever 
---
I said two different things that are opposite each other. Which one are you talking about?
---
Man there's a lot of bad ways to play Legion but camping with them? Holy shit.
---
I‚Äôm a big fan of Dark Sense in general too, just because I like knowing where the killer is. Might try this one out!
---
Well cheers to that man, but no offense to you because you really are a really solid killer player but you were playing her weirdly at first the other day. I can‚Äôt wait to catch another stream/vid to see you and her at the full potential. gg‚Äôs man.

I LIKE HOW KILLERS RESPOND TO A SURVIVOR EFFECTIVELY BEING UNABLE TO PLAY THE GAME AT ALL WITH....THE KILLER NOT BEING AS POWERFUL AS THEY LIKE.
---
REALLY DRIVES HOME THE SKEWED VIEW OF THE TWO ROLES.
---
Lmaoooo proving his point even more
---
I think what makes this video look worse than the gameplay like gross wise is because, you're literally puking in his face as he stares blankly at you LOL. &lt;3
---
my anxiety couldnt handle the random chase music. I remember one time, i got chase music, ran around in a panic (i was new to the game and i didnt look behind me) and i ended up running over to where this billy was patrolling the hatch. He didnt see me and started running back to a gen and i just jumped in and escaped
---
This is unfair to those who have an insect based phobia
---
join them next time
---
The 2nd thing!
---
Once the gates are open, anything goes. Secure that kill, and take advantage of stupid altruistic plays.
---
You‚Äôd do that..... For ME?! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

So does overreacting, constantly arguing the point, and then acting like your smarter then them. Smooth bro. Real smooth. "Don't attack my favorite content creator, he doesn't deserve the negativity!" Even if this was about him, it's really not up to you to decide whether or not he wants criticism or not lol.
---
Ooh beech yes I really want to, might take me a while though, this one took my god knows how long
---
SHE IS MY MAIN AND I CONSTANTLY WISH I COULD DO LIKE A MENTORSHIP WITH NEW PLAYERS TO TEACH HOW TO PLAY AGAINST HER. I GET SO MANY FREE WINS OFF OF PEOPLE NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY ARE DOING, AND AS SURVIVOR IT'S AWFUL TO HAVE SOMEONE ELSE FUCK ME OVER.
---
Blends in very well in a game without daylight
---
Who was the killer?
---
David is a nord confirmed.
---
Also yeah used Deja Vu for the kyf, wanted to check out the bug before it got patched :D
---
Things are a fuck ton harder for sure. Even in games where i've killed 3 and had one escape through the hatch i've gotten bronze gatekeeper and a negative pip. 
---
So far the only way i've gotten iridescent was with Hag, Thana, Sloppy, Overcharge and Ruin.  Chaser and Devout have also been hard to get high depending on how the survivors play. 
---
I usually just hit the other guy or just jump in... there‚Äôs no point of waiting around. Just do it and move on ‚Äî you can easily get those points from the next game. 
---
&gt; makes them visible to Freddy (because he's the lord of the Dream World)
---
Not really sure what this would do (he should already see them anyway) other than give a free speed boost to survivors, which as I said before, they don't need. Also, this is the 2010 remake Freddy, not the original. 
---
I think there's something there with the benefits to both Freddy and the survivors though, and the pulling him out of the dreamworld (with the caveat that he can immediately hit survivors without the need to put them to sleep, first). 
---
Go ahead and tunnel. Just know that the selfish survivor is still in the game, while the player your tunneling was screwed over. 
---
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre so butt hurt ü§ßü§ß
---
My mistake. I was actually thinking of when I use M&amp;A on MM not Pig.
---
No one could survive that roast, not even me
---
wha
---
I disagree that he is bad for the games health. I have been around since the beta for this game. I have dipped my feet in the water with just about every killer and most of the complaints I read on this reddit about home are just false. The only thing I agree with is the moonwalking cancer. I mean that is truly game breaking, not even in a its so good type of way, its just broken mechanically. As far as people complaining about franks mix tape, they piss me off really bad. Like its not even that bad. Huntress can 1 shot you with her best build. You're down in a good shot in literally like 2 seconds. Even with franks mix tape, it can still take a while to kill some one. 10-20 seconds or more depending. You can still get pallet stunned. You still can lose people. Billy can 1 shot you, myers can 1 shot you. theres so much goddam hate on this subreddit about legion. Hes not as bad as people think he is. The fact hes only viable with certain add ons is a problem. The fact he needs a rework is true, just based on the premise that the moonwalking is a thing. Or the staring down is a thing. But pallet looping has always been cancer. It was broken back in the day. Before huntress, before hag, like there will literally spots where people could juke you for ever. No skill involved, and the reddit back then would tell killers, well too bad, stop chasing them and find some one else. Thats the most cancerous shit reply I use to hear. Things were bad for killers back then, and things are getting better now but it doesn't help when this reddit is so survivor biased all the time. Its toxic for killers.Always has been, from day 1
---
It looks like it's going to be that way. Rip
---
Well NOED wouldn‚Äôt be fine if the killer could also damage the gates though. Even if the perk itself doesn‚Äôt have to do with the gates, it‚Äôs still a big buff.
---
I been using her for about a month. I can get down to around rank 7 and I struggle there.
---
Yes
---
Survivor and killer's nightmares! He has the power to pull Freddy into the dream world!
---
If it‚Äôs your only kill? What‚Äôs the problem? I expect to be face camped if I get caught once the doors are open. 
---
Yeah it sucks when I haven‚Äôt been hooked the entire game and then NOED. I‚Äôm hooked and camped. But it‚Äôs not a big deal tbh
---
I don't think she pukes that much in game.... Or wait does she????
---
Ew, light mode
---
the ptb takes a copy of the live game, after that copy is created nothing carries over between the versions, if you use a addon in PTB it won't be consumed in live, if you earn a perk on live it won't be available on PTB.
---
If you killed the other 3 without camping,  you shouldn't even need the 4th kill. You should be pretty much maxed out,  what's the big deal about 1 person getting away? Espcially if it's a survior who's done enough to deserve a escape,  a lot of us who don't have a 4 man swf group struggle because of getting shitty team mates. Hit em,  and move on. That simple. When I play killer,  I'm perfectly happy getting a 3k. I don't feel the need to be constantly kill hungry as long as I'm pretty much maxed out. No need to get 4ks every single match,  only time I ever will do a hatch stand off and not wanna give is if they beat me to the hatch and stand there to t bag or brag they found it,  I've snatched probably 5 people out of doing that. Lol. 
---
Following this reddits theology, I guess its to DC when you see her. apparently its perfectly accepted here.
---
The new piping system is broken as well
---
oh for sure. M&amp;A is a must on MM imo
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it'll be fixed before releasing.  It seems really wrong with how it gets calculated.  
---
It's just an overall concept, but I would like to see more killer mechanics that allow survivors to accept a benefit to give the killer a benefit, too.  Freddy seems a great target for this because in the dream world he should be ridiculous nightmare, but in the real world, he should be at a severe disadvantage.  Entering the dream world (or being pulled in) is dangerous for survivors but should also lead to a payoff (like being able to drag Freddy out again).
---
Calling me a survivor main? While your over here justifying shitty players? Ok.
---
Not really, I can understand camping after gates are opened. Keep assuming boo, stay butthurt too. 
---
Love the Trapper! Super cute. 
---
They didn't focus the person. They were walking around, walked into someone who was injured and downed him. It's a stupid rule that you have to let an injured person get away who's in range, just because they were recently hooked.
---
What'd you do if they unhooked themselves? Just let them get away because they were already hooked?
---
I have to agree. Now I actually think the voice acting is okay but I just prefer no voices. Now if she hummed some sort of hymn or something, that‚Äôd creep me right out. Besides I like to think she was so sick, she can‚Äôt even speak anymore. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I play both equally, and I would say it‚Äôs about split down the middle. There‚Äôs just more survivors in a single game so you‚Äôre more likely to see a dickhead on the opposing team when you play killer. As far as toxic playstyle though I blame Noob3 for making it ‚Äúcool‚Äù to be toxic. 
---
If Corrupt Intervention became a hex perk, the killer could in theory hold the game hostage. If they were to just stand in front of their totem and body block it, the survivors wouldn‚Äôt be able to escape, since the last 3 gens would be blocked.
---
Just hit them, 4k is pointless.
---
A week ago it was way too easy. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre just going to the extreme other end to make it easy to find a middle ground. 
---
With that in mind, I don't think survivors should get any speedboost in the dreamworld (and keep the current debuff as well). 
---
You can still dodge huntress, billy, Myers and other killers, they actually have to catch you for you to go down even with strongest addons. There is nothing you can do against Legion, you can only hope to waste as much time as possible before you go down. Idk why this is so hard to understand for some killer mains, but maybe because they feel like they deserve a down only because they found someone. 
---
The way he likes *them* is why I like *him*. That and name so nice you say it twice.
---
Same, I play surv as well but play killer more often since I have no friends to group with most of the time, like damn I know when I‚Äôm doing bad or miss a hit since I haven‚Äôt played in literal weeks. It‚Äôs no fun at all when your low rank vs high ranks who are depending on the high rank to get shit done.
---
Of all the killers to draw for this subreddit, you choose the licenced killer
---
If you are repeatedly going after the same person over and over then yes you are tunneling.
---
Now you can make a case if it's intentional by ignoring other players and only going for them or circumstantial by them just running into you, but both cases are tunneling,
---
I don‚Äôt know why, but for some reason I really enjoy watching these situations play out...so much suspense! lol.
---
She‚Äôs only been playable for a couple days. It‚Äôll take time to really figure it out. But from what I‚Äôve seen and experienced, breaking eyesight works pretty well. Don‚Äôt try to do loops with low walls, and don‚Äôt get caught in the open. 
---
I would have laughed my ass off. Anyone who gets me laughing in this game always escapes since I've already won at that point.

Yeah try a detective tapp with his all black suit. 
---
Think of her vomit like a hatchet, how do you counter that?
---
I run Ruin, enduring, spirit fury, and sloppy butcher. It‚Äôs been doing wonders for me. 
---
Sloppy butcher I change around. Discordances and Thrill of he hunt are good ones for silent spirit. 
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get why survivors are so entitled,‚Äù why lie? You clearly called me one.
---
I‚Äôm not, you‚Äôre justifying shitty players. 
---
Why is it the survivors fault, when he clearly got farmed then? Go ahead and tunnel, be an ass and chase him rather than the farmer.
---
No, that‚Äôs different. Don‚Äôt try that. 
---
Oof
---
It's tunnelling when the killer goes for one person in particular to kill that guy. It's not tunnelling when the killer chooses to hit one person over another because only on is injured.
---
If the person who is unhooking is injured and they still choose to just go for the guy who is unhooked, fair enough, the only reason to do that is to get one person out of the game faster.
---
It's an anti tunneling perk I dont see why people dont like it . 
---
THERE WAS THIS P3 CLAUDETTE WHO WAS CLICKING ME AND I FOUND HER ON MY STEAM PROFILE HARRASING ME IN COMMENTS AND OH HO SHE'S A TWITCH STREAMER 
---
FUCK TWITCH STREAMERS WHO RUIN A KILLERS DAY JUST FOR SOME VIEWS
---
Is there a reason this game looks so shit? Their art and cinematics are amazing but their in game models are a special breed of shit
---
If you hit someone who just got unhooked and immediately put them back on hook then you are have tunneled them off hook. 
---
He could have gone for the unhooker there but he didn't.
---
Sure if the guy randomly runs into him after they got unhooked I agree there is no problem in hitting them, but if you see someone unhooking the guy go after the idiot unhooking them.
---
I think some killers don‚Äôt speak due to lore (Meyers never speaks, and from Billy or Huntresses back stories they probably wouldn‚Äôt talk even if the developers added voice.) but it would be super cool to get some lines or maybe a taunt at the end of the game or something 
---
It happened to me when I tried to join one. Guess that means we've discovered a very rare bug that only happens when you enter/exit a kyf.
---
I mean he‚Äôs a great killer main. He has a lot of skill and you get to learn a lot from him but it‚Äôs just the complaining about dumb shit (not actual problems with the game. Those are justified.) that gets to me. 
---
Thank you.
---
At least people don't want to put you in the Guillotine like me...
---
That's what im saying. The wording in the patch notes make it sound like defending gens is the most important in the first nine minutes of the game, but the vast majority of games are mostly over around/before that time frame.
---
Absolutely fail to see how anyone sans Leatherface or Hill Billy have fun with that build. It makes the chase entirely monotonous, eliminates a lot of the challenge of actually out-playing, and takes up TWO perk slots just to get it going, meaning you get less variety of perks elsewhere to do something interesting. Absolute snoozefest of a perk set-up on anyone but insta-down killers in my opinion, and even then it's still kinda beat.
---
There are so many more creative options. Save The Best For Last on Freddy is fantastic because you can still affect your obsession without hitting them. Monitor &amp; Abuse makes him able to keep good tabs on everyone in the dream world. And there's even more interesting prospects coming with the new perks this patch will bring. 
---
Enduring and Spirit Fury on M1 killers is so god damn boring.
---
Well the supposed lore reason was that the entity doesnt allow them too, but I guess Plague gets a special pass
---
If that makes you feel better, to throw labels on people for how they play, go right ahead. 
---
Two survivors coming up the stairs, the healthy one doesn't block, the injured one ripe for the taking. I'm supposed to go after the healthy one? If I don't have Make Your Choice, why?
---
Your logic astounds me.
---
Maybe she should puke candy and rainbows instead.
---
Wasn‚Äôt it the old swamp? The new one feels smaller
---
Apparently that's the mantra with a lot of survivors. "I just got off the hook, GO AFTER SOMEONE ELSE!!!"
---
To be fair, based on the time stamp you did post yours first. Both are funny though and someone was bound to make this, so just keep making more!
---
T I L T 
---
He was a child killer, not a pedo in the original. It's one of the things that annoyed me about the remake, that and the fact he had whole monologues. 
---
Shit I had no idea survivors know that the killer has a thrill of the hunt. That explains why it never works as well as the YouTube gameplays
---
I‚Äôd recommend it. Makes you more effective and incentivizes not camping. And leatherboy can be fun to use on rank reset.
---
I fucking wish I had that experience. So many times they just run away from me while I‚Äôm undoing a totem as the killer approaches. Or worse is when they unhook me and don‚Äôt take a hit for me as the killer is right behind them. üò≠
---
The killer isn't in the game to bring justice, they're literally there to kill you. You're expecting the killer to put themselves at a disadvantage because your teammate done something stupid.
---
You're going to shout at the killer for killing you, over your teammate which set you up for the enemy to kill you?
---
I want vommy mommy to shoot her goo at me
---
It's like being pushed into a Lion's den then getting mad at the lion for attacking you over the guy who pushed you in.
---
Poor sick Jesus
---
There really is.
---
Thanks :D
---
He would probably have BBQ &amp; Chilli on as well
---
The killer can do whatever they want, if they choose to tunnel people that's their choice. You're still being a dick for doing so.
---
Yeah I will get frustrated with them for tunneling me and at the teammate, they get their fair share. They aren't mutually exclusive.

---
Tunneling right after someone gets unhooked is a dick thing to do. 
---
Was it carbs? I'm sorry I don't know why I'm like this, hope you had fun.
---
audio levels are not something this game has had on lock.  Just be glad you weren't around for the early days of Hag's 'Disfigured Ear' addon.
---
Literal ear damage.
---
Nothing like playing against hacking Rochelles that wall hack and spam her [psychotic cackling laugh](https://youtu.be/zZyzP_Nwejc?t=9) the entire game. 
---
I can see the Pig, but where is the survivor that the camera should be centered on? Is this some sort of new spectator mode?
---
i personally would, cannibal was the first character i leveled to 40 and it was very worth it to have BBQ on everyone
---
I didn't mention Myers, I agree that ruin is good on him as he has little map pressure early on. I prefer enduring and spirit fury as I prefer chase style Myers.
---
If you don't get to even see the unhooker (which I hate, they always hide) then I understand that. I usually just slug them coz I have some empathy for the guy.
---
Listen I'm not here to judge you or something, it's your videogame and you choose how you want to play it. I just think tunneling is a bit dickish and I empathize with the guy who got fucked over.
---
Yeah no if you have three injured survivors early game, 1 hook, and you're about to get a second survivor on the hook soon, you are just about guaranteed to pip. Something has to go horribly wrong for it to not happen.
---
Have you ever noticed the strength of these perks between green and purple?
---
Next project... discovering the backstory of the killer Nea
---
Where is this rule of giving the last guy a hatch? Ive seen it pop up more and more, my job is to fucking kill you, im not gonna carry you to the exit.
---
Pretty sure its just for colour variety, perk colour has no effect other than bloodpoint cost.
---
Oh honey, that sounds like a Friday night.
---
Do people seriously not research the killers to formulate a strategy to counter their power?
---
Honestly so odd that so many streamers DC. Like they're ever gonna get viewers playing like that
---
How does it not? 
---
Nah, killer isn't being a dick at all, it's all on the teammate. The killer is being nice if he goes for the person who unhooked over the unhooked person. He's on the enemy team, anything he does to purposely give you an advantage is kindness, it shouldn't be standard.
---
You probably wouldn't get mad at the killer at all if a teammate blows up a gen and the killer finds you, probably wouldn't get mad at the killer if a survivor bodyblocks your escape and the killer gets you.
---
Dont get me wrong. I feel bad for the guy who got fucked over. But I'm inclined to blame the unsafe unhook by the survivor's teammate. Why did they unhook with the killer nearby?
---
I wish the unsafe unhook penalty was bigger but it's already pretty big. The problem is that people dont care about pips. They care about winning. For killers that's killing more people. For survivors that is escaping themselves. Screw everybody else.
---
Scarred Hand.
---
you havent stopped yet bro? how stupid can you be big cringe /s
---
Part of it is that it's so easy to shrug off Dream Demon, and SWF on voice comms running rampant. 
---
Because the perk has nothing to do with gens. Why not "Fire up those lockers"?
---
I don't think I've ever related to a post in this subreddit as much as this one right here...
---
I LOVE TGIS SO MUCH
---
I wouldn't say the perk is that good.
---
Kind of wish it was in the settings. 
---
I got called a camper for sitting near a hook that survivors were literally throwing themselves at for the save since the moment they got hooked. Like what? Am I just suppose to let you rescue them? And yes I would've moved away if not for the fact that I knew they were still nearby because B&amp;C only set off one survivor.
---
Often times thats why pc players use different images for survivor/killer/perk icons for your loadout screen and in game, spices up your visuals slightly and can be a nice personal touch (no alternative for console players feelsbadman.)
---
Ruin was in a couple weeks ago, but keep in mind BBQ is almost never on the shrine. If you mainly play survivor instead of killer that won't matter much though.
---
Id get it. The less teachables you have now means that youll have a better chance of getting it on other killers as well
---
Very "Twilight: New Moon"-ish.
---
I need a Spirit one, damnit
---
I'm pretty sure he knew he was dying from having been long shot. Then again, it's a movie, so I dunno.
---
I kinda wish they gave you some bloodpoint penalty if you tunneled the guy.
---
And my axe!
---
Glad you like it :)
---
Stuff happens lol
---
I tip my hat to you sir
---
My god you could have a Scooby-doo episode there
---
I just saw this but i also have one more question, what‚Äôs the best way to counter freddy
---
"First we'll spray paint the church, then we'll make some survivor nerds rage DC".
---
I love it xD
---
I had a game where a huntress did nothing but go after me. Even after there were at least two other people around me they decide to follow me, who had already been hooked twice,  half way across the map and kill me for the last hook. I find that a bit in bad taste as a person who plays both sides.
---
argh, I hate that killer... and who is the guy in the christmas sweater
---
But that's the point. You completely remove the concept of tunneling if the only way of confirming it is them saying "yes I wanted you dead in particular, I tunneled you because fuck you". Most of the time nobody is going to admit that even if it's true. You're also removing the concept of camping, as you can keep saying that you thought you saw someone till it actually becomes true as someone eventually comes over to try to unhooked the guy you're camping.
---
Going after the people that just got unhooked when you had a choice not to without completely messing yourself over because of the gates being open is tunneling. You understand in what situation the guy who got unhooked is, you choose to down them after their teammate fucked them over (in which they had 0 say in). You are choosing to be dick to them. 
---
Also being mad at your teammate in the post game chat isn't going to matter, it's not like the guy who farmed you cares at all about it. You didn't get to play the game, they did.
---
Most Very Rare Perks (Purple) are "better" than Rare Perks (Green) (not my opinion). 
---
The different rarities have different chances to be found in the Bloodweb. Purples are harder, or rarer, to find.
---
I play spirit often and you're gonna get the most value out of futzing around with her ability, it's great at mind gaming survivors, and it can actually be better when chasing a survivor who's looping you  by just stopping for a second and pretending to use your ability when in reality your just not moving, doing so can cause them to run move close to you slowly, stop moving entirely or leave the pallet, if they leave the pallet then you've got them off the loop and can chase them a little better likely, if they stop completely you can actually activate the ability and take them out, if they approach you thinking that they're sneaking around your ability you just hit them. 
---
*laughs in Billy*
---
Yeah, I've never been in long series of hellish battles, bleeding from the chest from a powerful rifle hit, so lord only knows what I would have done in that situation. Probably nothing nearly as ballsy.
---
Simple pallet looping takes care of him. He has no chase tools so just loop him like you would with any other standard killer (if you dont know what looping is either ask me or look it up). Else just wake yourself up as fast as possible outside of a chase (self heal, gens or teamamates)
---
I know she is ranked a hard killer to play; and it especially difficult to play her while at the low rank I'm at

nea was never really popular

Well :L I tried to defend Freddy but it looks like I've just stirred the pot of hate for him right up.
---
Nobody's making you do it, obviously, but if 3 survivors DC in a match when there's no gens done (or it's straight a 1v1) it's not really a fair game otherwise.
---
Rev chainsaw. Lightning strikes. Vroom sadly.
---
My primary job in this existence is to be a cool person. If everyone DCs except one survivor, or their two of their team just ran into me repeatedly in the worst unhook attempt I‚Äôve ever seen, I‚Äôll dump em at the hatch or whatever. I don‚Äôt need 4K if someone got in a lobby with the three stooges. 
---
A survivor that‚Äôs too frustrated to play is a longer queue time for me. 
---
yeah its easy, just use plunderer's instinct and maybe use ace in the hole to get add ons an you just search chests and try to escape with the stuff I have gotten several rainbow maps and skeleton keys out of trials along with most of the other crap I have simply because I had Plunderer's instinct tier 3
---
May I ask what Rank you are?
---
Omg same.
---
r/whiteknights
---
Plague got released already?
---
Man, Bill from Dead By Daylight was so popular he got into Left 4 Dead!
---
Put in the effort like like everyone else instead of lazily copy pasting an image and going _"hur der lol this like x in dbd guys"_and there wouldn't be any problems.
---
No but I think you can Pristege on the ptb
---
..Shes fanatic, but fanatastic...
---
Neas will be ur best teamates if you treat them well, better then a claud or a meg i can tell you that.
---
BLASPHEMY! only the preists should be allowed to read the word of god! Peasents will just make their own meanings of the stories, they need a shepard to guide them into it's right meanings!

I see the Entity is sponsored by "Colgate"... now even unholy demon-like god-like entity arnt save from the cooperate takeover ! ....they are the real killers !

On a side note, could you do a render of the legacy outfits OP? I would really like one.
---
IVE BEEN KILLING SURVIVORS THIS WAY AND TELLING THEM IN POST-GAME CHAT TO SEND ANGRY REPORTS TO THE GAME DEVS SO WE CAN END THIS CRAP. I DONT EVEN NEED ADD-ONS I JUST USE BLOODHOUND AND MICHAEL JACKSON THAT SHIT TO VICTORY
---
She is strong, but like any other killer she‚Äôs weak against good survivors that genrush. 
---
You counter her like you counter legion. Keep running and rushing gens. 
---
For the most part, untill corrupted purge, she‚Äôs a M1 killer and is heavy dependend on the right perks.
---
Stop grabbing your crotch Michael, it‚Äôs weird 
---
Legions power is great for injuring as many survivors as you can and can also be used to close some distance in a chase. 
---
Most experienced players refuse to heal against legion as healing is pointless. Sloppy with legions power will mean that if survivors decide to heal themselves it will take them a very long time to heal.
---
I usually use the legions power to hurt everyone and then hunt them down via foot. Its great if the team keeps healing as they are wasting a lot of time whereas if the team is not healing then your in trouble as they know how to play against legion. The only good thing is that if everyone is injured then you can hear them easier and you can down them in one hit. 
---
The easiest way to play legion is by using franks mixtape and cold dirt. You just tunnel one person with feral until you down them. This is very effective and will more or less guarantee you a win in most cases as there is no counterplay. You can do this without the addons but it takes significantly longer to down someone.
---
To summarise, there are mainly 3 ways that people play legion. 
---
1 - Injure as many people as you can with your power then hunt them down via foot. Using perks like stridor may help track them and try and down them in one hit. You can use your power to close the gap between you and the survivor then come out of it when you are right behind them or infront of them. 
---
2 - Tunneling using your power guarantees you a down but without proper addons you will find this taking a long time with the frenzy cooldown. It takes 4 feral hits to down a survivor.
---
3 - Moonwalking in an exploit used to cause the deep wound timer to decrease while you technically chase them. Not a very respectable tactic.
---
love it
---
Freddy needs to say bitch at least during his mori.
---
Yes, it was worse, but the meme has the guy taking it and still being humble. You can't say a thing about balance without "I HAD TO PLAY THROUGH WORSE, WE CANT BALANCE ANYHING EXCEPT WHAT WAS BROKEN THEN"
---
COWBOY HAT YEEEEEEEE HAW
---
All about the dummies that feed EW
---
And that is why I save Frank's mixtape. I always block survivors that t bag and when I meet then next time, I bring Frank's mixtape or distressing 3 gen doc with the game offering.
---
Are you talking about the spitters? Those are the closest to plague I'm.
---
The killer who goes after the injured one is not the problem. The survivor who rescue the hooked one while the killer is still near the hook is at fault if the killer is not camping.
---
Not surprised 
---
Huh, didn‚Äôt realize she was Brazilian. 
---
What‚Äôs the bug?
---
Man haven't seen that in over a decade. Thanks for the info!
---
Noooo, the PTB went up Wednesday though, I suggest you go check it out.
---
"Sick of seeing this guy everywhere"
---
"Because he's popular"
---
"Lol I don't fucking care"
---
????
---
Remove the timer completely? You mean, someone who‚Äôs been unhooked is guaranteed to escape next time? No thanks.
---
Every day, we stray closer to God's light
---
Guys I am so cool, I dislike popular things
---
so I‚Äôm not allowed to dislike Pewdiepie now?
---
They're always really underwhelming re-skins of the survivor's base outfit. the clown dlc comes with a white shirt for kate, which is nice, but for adam and jeff, it's barely noticable that it's a different item.
---
I beleive there's a bruised face for dwight for Leatherface DLC owners, and the Project awakening (black coat) doctor outfit is only abvailable by buying the dlc. I'm not sure about the hag one.
---
I see you are a man of taste; I too am a fan of the Brazilian.
---
Some people like to play towards a goal, and reaching rank 1 is one such goal.
---
As for personally depipping? There are HOURS of podcasts from the Fog Whisperers discussing why that's a dick thing to do.
---
Awww, the Amanda one really is so adorable!
---
I hate that people like this exist
---
Omegakek you are the type that thinks rank 1 is hell and judges that survivors are swf after 1 bodyblock and they are toxic for looping.
---
Why's he playing Nurse on the PTB? Isn't the point to test the new killer?

if you are referring to BBQ and Ruin, no, they didn't get a buff, they just equalized them across all levels. Level 3 ruin and BBQ are the same. Its more of a QoL.
---
Wheezes in five blink nurse
---
No problem, its a pretty good film
---
Almost 50k bp per match with 4 stacks is defenetly worth it. Also it shows you survivors aura so you know what they are doing.
---
You can dislike anyone you want. But I don't think anybody wants to hear it imo
---
Oink
---
I think you‚Äôre the butthurt one. It seems like you‚Äôve been tunnelled and now you‚Äôre projecting.
---
What rank are you? Cause you making it sound like playing killer is super easy.
---
It should still feel like it has infinite range appart from the bigger maps
---
Ok. That's how you play. That's how I don't play because I feel that it is unethical. There is nothing to argue on now.
---
"Shut up Francis."
---
No pun intended?  Sick? No?  Okay I‚Äôm gonna go cry now üòÇ
---
I remember one game where I was having a miserable time (playing perkless, no add-ons Myers *I was bored*). All the gens are up and for the third time in the entire game, I downed a Claud, and hooked her. That's where it should've ended, wrong. A Laurie, Feng, and another Claud came to get the hooked Claud, as I watch them all tbag around the hook, in my line of sight, *as I gain Stalk off all of them.* I stop til I just have to tap the button to pop Tier 3, and wait. They all surround the hook, and I move in and I go to town. Pops the instadown and in quick succession, down the Feng, down the hook saved Claud, and then the other Claud, and chase the Laurie out the exit. Turned a possible 1k into a 3k.   
---
If the gates are up and, depending on which killer, the killer is guarding a hooked survivor, it is probably best to leave and not gift wrap the killer more kills.    
---

Just don't be a dick. But that's not the point I was trying to make. The point is more:

Some survivors being dicks does not "justify" being a dick to *all* survivors.

unpopular opinion but pallet saves not requiring timing for saves wasn't super broken. 
---
Flashlights? A thousand times yes. But pallets, not really. I think it's arbitrarily that you have to time the stun right and on top of that it's really jank in general.

No idea how this ended up at the top of your friend's stream, but Behaviour invited a few streamers to talk about the future of the game, and they keep making jokes about a BR mode and beans, here are some examples:

# **OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOD**
---
oh you're right! didn't even notice it, tbh
---
Thank God they didn't add these
---
Mostly yes. However there are also a lot of other changes. So there are a also people who want to test these changes. Something like nurse multilevel blinking on the new map or playing with the DS changes as you main killer. 
---
Look at the image someone posted of the Jane's perspective and you'll see her
---
Curious though, how much do you think it would change a chase if 3 lockers were in the areas like this vs 2? Usually it comes down to a 50/50 in a chase unless they are separated a lot. Quickly hoping in one with a 1/3 chance depending on perks and such. 
---
I really like the "prisoners dilemma" aspect of the plague where you can only cure your own broken condition by giving the killer momentum against your entire team. Super cool design.
---
What would u do? Patrol gens when gates are open? Hit a healthy survivor t bagging at the exit gate? Rescuing someone hooked after gates are open is like playing double or nothing. 
---
Cuz it's no longer a guaranteed free extra life.
---
I've no opinion on this streamer but I think this vaguely constitutes witch hunting.
---
That being said I really think anyone who habitually depips through dis connecting or just OVERTLY fucking their team should get banned. If I'm getting a bit too high ranked i just throw on killers i'm not great with or try new builds with Survivors that don't completely fuck my team. 
---
That would then just be a complete buff to a perk that most people agreed is WAY powerful.
---
That's like hearing all the survivors cry about BBQ, then making it's aura reading only trigger when a survivor enters stage 2 or 3 of the sacrafice... But it lasts 30 seconds.
---
That's exactly what I do! 
---
Yeah makes sense
---
My friend just started playing the game as well and he already feels tired by all the facecamping
---
So it wouldn't be just Roadhog we would be copying? Nice!
---
*Cackles in mint rag hag*
---
It still doesn't apply lmao. The perk has nothing to do with your "joke".
---
Shes pretty revolting.
---
When a killer is waiting at the hatch i just do a gen or open the gate. They try baiting people a lot
---
Thats the only thing I watch on Ochido's YouTube channel tho
---
Good one I guess.
---
I found getting looped more fun then killing suvs straight away and gettting 4k for days
---
Then why the fuck you calling mr young? Fucking disabled twat
---
Huntress looks like that one pic of Dutch from Red Dead 2 smiling lol 
---
If you still complain after all the changes maybe accept you just arent very good?
---
Yeah
---
Imagine being filled with so much anger, over a videogame as well, this sure ain‚Äôt fun to live that way.
---
It‚Äôs from the Charity Case. 
---
üò´
---
But the legion wasted some good addons :,(
---
Because I want to hook the other unhooked survivor(s).
---
More important question is why are you playing hag on the ptb....
---
It's a KYF.... 
---
Yeah. It's just pretty unfun for the other player.
---
*Cue some users crying "I'm not responsible for other player's fun!"*
---
These are ps4 frame rates bruh
---
me_irl
---
That's why I thought it looked familiar
---
HOW THE FUCK DID THAT HILLBILLY KNOW WHERE I WAS WHEN THE MATCH STARTED!!!! I MOVED TWO FEET AND HID BEHIND HAY. AND YET THERE YOU ARE RIGHT NEXT TO ME IN ONE CHAINSAW RUN
---
Plz, no
---
Too much ravioli in her ass.
---
Oh i misread it, good on them for making it work with corrupt purge. Good thing they did not fuck it up like i feared they would.
---
Hmm, i probably got lucky
---
RIGHT? I WENT BACK AND WATCHED THE VOD OF A TTV THAT I PLAYED AGAINST, AND IT WAS FUCKING AMAZING HOW MUCH SHIT THEY WERE TALKING **THAT WASN'T EVEN TRUE**. LIKE AT ONE POINT ONE OF THEM SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HOW I WAS TUNNELING THEM WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY CHASING THEIR FRIEND, AND YOU COULD SEE FROM THE FRIEND'S PERSPECTIVE THAT THEY LET UP AT THAT POINT WHICH GAVE ME THE CHANCE TO HIT THEM. BUT DID THAT OTHER GUY SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HOW I ACTUALLY WASN'T TUNNELING? FUCK NO. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THEY WERE CHEERING ON THE P3 CLAUDETTE WHO DID NOTHING BUT HIDE IN A CORNER ALL GAME OR LEAD ME IN CHASES RIGHT TO THE OTHER THREE AND HOPED SHE FOUND THE HATCH. LIKE, YOU GUYS REALIZE THAT IF SHE HAD DONE HALF A GEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A DOOR OPEN BY THE TIME YOU ALL DIED? BUT NO, IT'S THE KILLER'S FAULT.
---
They already announced servers coming in summer, relax 
---
Because survivors have small pp.
---
Your opinion is stupid
---
Hahaha happens to the best of us! I myself used to be a veteran noob. It‚Äôs a rough and embarrassing life when you absolutely suck but can‚Äôt admit it. Hopefully your friend wakes up and gains a less bias opinion haha
---
That‚Äôs worse than subscribing to T-Series
---
My question remains 
---
New perk: Pallet Buddy
---
It's not even dat ass. I'm not 100% sure why but she looks more like she belongs in Soul at Stake
---
Common decency is not common in this game by anyone at all, you‚Äôll find.
---
Well put, yes. It's the same reason that "stun mechanics" in many multiplayer games are frowned upon and/or at least slightly hated. You might get one-shot by another player, instantly dying, but even this is usually better than being stunned or stun-locked, people don't like being robbed of interaction and ability to play, which is perfectly understandable. I'd rather be dead and waiting to respawn than having to sit around not being able to do anything.
---
Being tunneled in DBD with its hook mechanics is kinda the same thing. You get hooked, you have to wait until you get rescued. You *get* rescued and are immediately put back on the hook: your windows of interactivity between that is slim to non existent. How could you enjoy a game like that?
---
As you said: there's no room to improve with that, you just prolong your death. That's why some survivors rather suicide to get to a new game, which screws over their team, but which is, again, understandable.
---
I‚Äôve been playing this game since launch and yeah it‚Äôs a toxic cesspool but it‚Äôs not so bad that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù that the killer played the game. Same goes for survivors, I don‚Äôt automatically assume they are trying to be toxic, unless they prove otherwise.
---
Is this real life
---
I‚Äôm confused by this as well
---
My idea was to add a bunch of safes that have a Hugh chance of containing a valuable item and gives bp to whoever opens it.
---
The catch is it takes a long time to open it and skill checks will appear and if failed it resets all progress and will sound a loud alarm and alerts the killer to the safe.
---
For each safe that remains when the match ends the killer gets a bp multiplier 1.5x for each safe that remains.
---
Essentially the purpose is to stall the game and potentially reward survivors should they feel lucky enough to get a valuable item from it 
---
You jest, but there have been stories of killers going in a game with Franklin's, hitting a survivor and then DC'ing to make the survivor lose their items.
---
New Emblems promote longer games... except I don't really see how it will work for survivors. It feels artificial.
---
Shes fugly.
---
What they should do it give survivors a timewaster of their own. i.e a new tool.
---
Aw thank you so much!!! 
---
Meme lord is one my fav people on the list(‚Äò: &lt;3 Y‚Äôall are the nicest.
---
I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm gonna get a lot of hate for this cuz someone is gonna read one that applied to them and get defensive (even though it‚Äôs all meant as a joke haha)
---
I laughed at the anime pic, witty sentence and only plays David and Kate because that‚Äôs MEEEEE. &lt;3
---
That‚Äôs understandable but truthfully if they have a fit, then that will just prove that they DO fit in the category they‚Äôre bitching about, lmao!
---
How do you manage to get 12 points in fast games?
---
What exactly is toxic though? I‚Äôm one of those guys who flashlight blinds the killer after a pallet stun. I get called toxic everyday, yet it‚Äôs game mechanics. 
---
And yes, it usually ends in me getting tunneled and face camped. 
---
Yes. The BP bonus is too good to pass up. Plus LF is a good killer to learn your basics and form good habits on.
---
lagswitch
---
The TF2 thing makes me feel old now, as someone who played TF1 back in the day, thanks. XD
---
I FUCKING GOT VOMITED ON LOVED IT BUT FUCK IT WAS VOMIT WHAT THE FUCK!
---
Haha I‚Äôm so glad you found it relatable! My fav people to play with on my friends list are memelords. Y‚Äôall are a light in this dark gaming world.
---
And exactlyyy omf!!! Half of these are roasts so if you get offended, that means the roast fits you... That‚Äôs all I gotta say xD
---
This was such a hard roast I almost forgave the lack of anime girls in the video.  
---
Almost...
---
Freddy is good against new survivors only. You will soon learn how bad he is against decent survivors.
---
Yeah my only problem with it is it seems to be the cheap way to do it, I really don't like people who face camp cause it's almost like saying I'm not that good at the game I know this and I'm just gonna take an easy win instead of learning how to play better
---
And that‚Äôs why you die within 10 seconds of being chased , that tactic isn‚Äôt gonna make you better at the game 
---
Ooooh... burn!
---
God I wish 
---
Then there‚Äôs just Dwight with a gun. 
---
Freddy is great if you are shit at tracking like me. 
---
That can't be true, unless that is from the current PTB- patch notes. I've definitively spawned in right beside a totem in the last week or so. 
---
*oh shit that's deep*
---
I'm more Jelly of those Black Wards :P. 
---
So, basically, if you're already not a sweaty Hillbilly/Nurse main who is very competitive and tries to pip each and every game, you're gonna be suck at whatever rank your personal skills are compatable with?
---
I totally agree. Because they main one side, all of their opinions are biased. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs best to play both
---
Toto, I don't think we're in the Entity's Realm anymore...
---
The jiggle physics are real on her. 
---
Thanos looks like a pedo lmao
---
That‚Äôs how you do the glitch
---
I'm going to propose that, when BHVR made "the nightmare" and how he was able to hit people after they vaulted and are a good distance away, [he did so through inspiration from this scene](https://i.gifer.com/7yVY.gif). So when people think it's lag or servers, it's just BHVR being true to the Nightmares movie depiction.
---
The average time frame for red rank matches are between 10-20 minutes for me, depending on the map and the Survivors.
---
My last killer game I played trapper. Got called a camper and tunneler because 2 PEOPLE STEPPED IN MY TRAPS AT THE BASEMENT AND ONE HEALED RIGHT NEXT TO THEM. Worst part is they were kicking my ass, 1 hook 3 gens done.
---
There are a bunch of asshole survs in this PTB. Yesterday I tried out Plague for the *first time* and the whole team was a bunch of tbagging shits. They all escaped tbaggingly in the end screaming in post chat "OMG SO EEEEZZZZ PZZZ BABY KILLER UNINSTALL GAME" for 5 minutes.
---
Like yeah... that's the point. I don't know how to play the killer yet. That's the PTB for *testing*. But you don't use rational arguments against those guys.
---
My first games as survivor with other survivors in the PTB were so lovely and kind. Only nice words &amp; funny games were had and shared. The harmony was perfect. I wish this was always the case :(
---
Would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those meddling kids.
---
I have a predefined rule on my router named "Legion". If I get into a game with a Legion, I just open the router app on my phone and enable the rule, which throttles my connection resulting me disconnecting from the game so I can play a proper match as fast as I can.
---
How did people do this? I played like one gane a few weeks ago and everyone was spamming the death screech
---
Congratz!
---
I can feel his pain, this poor man, that is one unhappy trappy
---
Thank you! üòÅ
---
Mods:*cries in insidious*
---
In a team game? Ok.
---
If all fountains are corrupted they will all be cleansed, devs implemented this to prevent killer from exploiting it by making survs broken for the whole match.
---
So what you're saying is you are free? 
---
WE NEED THIS WALLPAPER!!!!

#OH FOR FUCKS SAKE

#PRETTY GOOD...

#JOB SO FAR
---
It has been a couple of hours since I first saw this video and I still can't get over it
---
Saving someone when gates are open is like playing double or nothing 
---
So you have no idea about their username? Any hint might help
---
As a survivor main she seems very fun to play against and she actually looks scary. 
---
That's why you have to go to people's houses and tell them in the middle of the night they should be rank 5 million
---
yeah the design goals don't work both ways... if they're actually what BHVR says they are... you can pip as survivor and DIE, and not pip and escape quite easily if you play a certain way and both games can be 10-15 minutes long tooo...
---
Again, that Feng, that's my picture xD
---
Not sure it would have helped. I‚Äôve gone out of my way to save people off of hooks while they‚Äôre being camped, and the killer usually just tunnels them till they‚Äôre dead. Borrowed time is jus that, and only ever delayed the inevitable. Unless the add bigger bloodpoint penalties, camping/tunneling isn‚Äôt going away. But I will if it keeps up :)
---
They could make it visible from e.g. within 48 meters and certain add-ons could be reworked to have that distance shortened. 
---
THAT FENG IS MY PICTURE
---
It's really not that toxic (in comparison to other games). I think the things people consider to be toxic in this game can often be a bit overblown. Occasionally you get someone flame in chat but I wouldn't say it's a cesspool. I've met tonnes of nice people in this game. Had some really wholesome chat after as killer and survivor, and the majority of games I've had all people write is "GG". I think it just really stands out when one person says something mean.

Someone give this lad a platinum

im sure they‚Äôll still do more. maybe only on christmas events though, doing one for every single event would be kinda yikes

and that thief over there... lol
---
Nurse is literally the best killer in the game, whatchu talkin about?
---
A good nurse literally demolishes even the most coordinated teams. "Slow" lmao what do you think her blinks are for?
---
Yea my gf lives in Canada right now and I think she used PC game supply or scratchmonkeys to buy me codes 
---
Can we add a Saw style to it and put shotguns in some and if they fail that one they die?
---
Woah...
---
You really got in character lmao
---
This is all over the place.
---
I take my job as a Saw fanboy and Pig worshipper very seriously.
---
This really works wonders. Had a Claudette with fully black clothing + a P3 head as my obsession on Yamaoka (darkest map) who kept clicking her flashlight at me.
---
I literally ignored her all match and went for the other 3. She escaped and called me a noob, but I got a 3k, so who gives a shit lmao.
---
Mind making a mobile version?
---
I heal near gens and you'd be surprised how many survivors I've played with that just don't pay even the slightest amount of attention to anything around them 
---
lauries always have DS lmao
---
they also always take the obsession
---
and then they miss
---
She is mid high tier rn.
---
I don't see anyone disconnecting, thus there is no content that you are specifying. wtf?
---
Bond : Lets you see other survivors
---
Object of Obsession : Lets you see the killer, and if the killer is also looking at you while you're looking at them, they can see your aura 
---
Lure the killer to nearby survivors 
---
If you time it right, you can run up while the killer is jumping down without seeing you. It's also luck, sometimes you time it wrong or the killer decides to do something else.
---
I am rank 1 Piggy with no BBQ

Can we also have a billy the pupper be in the safe to laugh when someone gets shot

Just a joke.

Yes his dad is also a Virgin
---
Freddy is a rough killer to play. Not because he is bad (he really is not) but he requires a ton of knowledge and work that you could put into high tier killers instead for a much better result. Therefore, he doesn't get played much. And if a non Freddy main plays him, most of the time it is tunnel city with the block addons, the worst way to play him because then you do play him the way people describe him, a m1 killer that has to wait to attack, instead of playing him as a high information hit and run character that he is
---
Remember this is internet, you can find almost everything...
---
Couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself. 
---
Ty friend!
---
Reminds me of the flavor text on a mtg card.
---
"Boasting impenetrable defenses only draws the most tenacious of attackers" 
---
 everytime survivors try to save a camped survivor, it's all I can imagine. Knowing full well it's almost impossible to get everyone out of that situation without amazing cooperation makes everyone want to save them but all of them waiting on someone else to make the first move
---
I think you need to play her more

Oh jeez, the memelord is pretty spot on lol.
---
Yeah, same. My dad went getting cigaretts and got sclwomped by the entity
---
Can relate since every killer starts lagging as soon as the game starts 
---
Haha thank you friend, I know a lot of memelords myself so I had several people to base that description off of
---
Play as The Pig, run Ruin but don't camp the survivors on the hook or try hard then use NOED but don't hook anyone and there you go. Early game they worry about Ruin, mid game they worry about traps and end game they worry about NOED but they dont complain because they all get to escape. 
---
After I down the survivor look on the bottom left. He disconnects and leaves the game. Open your eyes. 
---
What the fuck
---
My gf is freaked out by her twitchy movements. Its almost like shes supposed to be a creepy evil japanese spirit or something.
---
That is a fact. No BBQ you just deny yourself those sweet BP :D. 
---
Wtf that‚Äôs so weird, it‚Äôs supposed to be linked to a clip and even shows the preview for it 
---
It takes you to it, you have to open it in desktop mode or in the app
---
Oh dear. Well, not everything is belittling, Tru3, and not everyone is specifically targeting you or attacking you or even stream sniping you. Life just goes on. Not everything is about you. 
---
And yes, you were indeed complaining about the No Mither game. Yes, people knew that they are going against the Plague. Yes, they are trying new tactics and experimenting with perks against the new killer. Yes, the tactics is far from flawless yet, but people just wanted to try it. You, however, reacted like it was personal. "They want to deny me the corruption". It's PTB. Don't assume that every single action people do has something to do with you personally. 
---
Oh yes, people happen to use one of the best exhaustion perks, hmmm, "how suspicious, they must have known that they are going against me". BL is a very good perk, Mount Ormond is not an infiinte. You can still mindgame, you can still do good plays even with the big house in the middle, which frankly is one huge RNG. But instead of admitting your bad plays and your panic near the end when you did not know which one to chase, it is simply easier to say that those are SWF and there is nothing you could have done.
---
I honestly can't believe it. Infinites, and I mean real infinites, are gone from the game for more than 2 years and people still have the audacity to complain about them. 
---
4-manning is not an indication of a skill and you know it. Insidious Leatherface can 4K with 5 gens left. Does it make him a skilled killer? You are facing bad teams. Not GODLIKE EU survivors, you are facing very mediocre players. As soon as someone shows skill a survivor and the game escalates towards opponent's success, you immediately start complaining and blaming map/genrush/pallets/SWF/anything else. 
---
Glad to hear.  
---
A major lack of awareness and competency seems to be rife in most matches.  
---
Must admit, it does make those matches with good teammates much more enjoyable and rewarding.

Awesome

---
*Shrug* Like i said im not in the top tiers for survivor. No one really endlessly loops, so unhooks and protection and all that happens, but its not a moronic fuck fest most times so generators still get done pretty rapidly.
---
 Ive also only played a modest handful of survivor games on the ptb vs a much larger number of killer games. In most of the ones i did play as survivor though they felt fairly quick but i did still often pip. Like i said though its been safety or  1, never 2.  
---
I dislike spirit, but mostly cause of the way people play her.  They use her as the ultimate tunnel machine off of hook. 
---
Stop it right there. What do you mean they all get to escape? Max of 1 survivor. Nothing else allowed.

It‚Äôs just funny how they wobble like Jelly.  Try it with the America top, it‚Äôs hilarious üòçüòÇüòÇ

The perks used to have 5 rarities: common (brown), uncommon (yellow), rare (green), very rare (purple) and ultra rare (pink/red).
---
Then the devs decided to change the rarities common and ultra rare into uncommon and very rare, resulting in some perks having two of their tiers in uncommon or very rare. And since tier 1 perks can only be either common (now uncommon), uncommon, or rare, their tier 3 versions will be either rare, very rare, or ultra rare (now very rare).

Ew nurse. A killer with no counterplay when played perfectly might be a nice trade off to some, but I just find it unfun to deal with when all I have to hope for is that the killer is bad.

It was not his fault, It was because of steam.

Y'all couldn't see that was a joke right....

Me too :D not pig but no BBQ and all killers, bbq is boring.

Did you even read OPs post?

Its gone both answered and unanswered since the beginning, occassionally they come here and say killers are the most toxic then they leave again to go and ruin someone elses day.

For some reason they get angrier when you don't camp than when you camp. ~~Maybe because it makes them realise how bad they are~~.

My friends think it‚Äôs weird when I get cheery vs the nurse. Against another killer there are those cut and dry motions you do vs them at certain walls and gyms. Against nurse, there‚Äôs no fucking rules. She dictates that flow because I throw all my rules out the window and just be as unpredictable as I can be. 
---
I don't see many ppl actually wearing it, I can't remember the last time I saw a twitch shirt.

The passion filled "haters" are very easy to see through, but without anyone contesting this nonsense it goes on and re-enforces the false narrative. I've now decided to start explaining and showing the truth and how twisted and forced this false perception is. All you need to do is go to my stream and you'll see less then 1% of the stream is the 100% of what people say I am all about.
---
I‚Äôm a squad and middle man tbh and probably a douche bag because it is fun to slug and camp every now and again.
---

---
thats something many survivors dont get. why should i let one survivor escape and search for someone who might be there instead and risk letting both escape? as a killer i will usually chase whoever i see first (or if i only see scratch marks i choose one of them and then its a coin flip, not actual tunneling).
---
more survivors should learn the game from killers perspective. most killers are way less toxic then survivors think. its just that many mistakes survivors make, look like the killers are camping or tunneling
---
As a solo survivor who always gets matched with idiot survivors even at red ranks: Thank god for DS. I guess now I have to play swf with voice comms.
---
Quality content 
---
Maybe I want to play a nice and enjoyable match, not a shitty one.
---
I must say I've only disconnected twice against a legion, but when I DC is not only because of legion. Is because his behaviour and perks.
---
Most of the times a legion game is not even close to an entertainment, but I can handle it. What I can't is a stupid tunneler with franklin's, ruin, noed and nurse's. 
---
He ain‚Äôt losing shit lmao
---
I just read a whole bunch of absolutely nothing. Thank you.
---
Mainly I had a daily and I needed blood points to level up the new killer.
---
at least with the new DS i won't feel guilty if and when i use it
---
Nobody and let me reiterate: Nobody cares about rank. 
---
There are no incentives to rank up in DBD. The only things people actually care about are BP‚Äôs for the grind, and being able to find some enjoyment either by wasting the killers time or by slaughtering survivors. 
---
It's a mod, obtained either via steam workshop or nexus mods.
---
Just start using after you‚Äôve been unhooked to get used to the new change.
---
Dead Hard and Balanced Landing are pretty much the only perks that can extend a loop, and BL can create infinites on some maps. Sprint Burst and Lithe can help create distance, but they don't help in an actual looping situation.
---
Personally, I learned most about looping when I started ranking up on killer and faced some really good survivors.
---
3 of them had balanced landing and picked the map as an offering, I made a read that they planned this tactic as I have been against it before where a team has a certain map they are mastering. Could I be wrong in my assessment, sure, but guess what so could you.
---
You're saying why are they swf and I'm saying why are they not?
---
Neither are in the right its just our observations. My observation was based on passed experience where I have had teams do this before. Also, if you truly believe that certain maps with BL don't create unwinnable chases then you don't understand the analytics of this game as well as you believe you do. Its a very much known thing that haddonfield with BL creates an unwinnable game. I assessed based on how they were playing and the routes they were taking, that, they understood some ridiculous loops based on BL thus why they used the map offering.
---
I love it, if you stop to tbag me that's less distance away from me :) Always love to put some wannabe toxic survivors to their place.

Couldn't find it in wiki = to lazy to search maybe? Anyway, I got you: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Realms

That's kinda disturbing.

Play a healthy amount (500 hours in or so) but don‚Äôt seem to improve much. More focused on BP farming than anything because I‚Äôm addicted to dem bloodweb gainz.

Rank 1 P3 Claud‚Äôs are the type of people to miss DS every time, miss skill checks, let people die on the hook, do literally nothing, waste pallets, and use self care even if they have 2 teammates trying to heal them. Most P3 Claud‚Äôs who solo que at rank 1 are boosted garbage, most not all.
---
Aren't people allowed to like him ?
---
Yeah i play killer too and i hate it when i run against four good survivors with ds but that doesn‚Äôt mean i should feel guilty when i play ds, its nice that ur trying to not make the killer‚Äôs game hell but remember that the killer wont make it any easy for u so why should u make it easy for him 
---
You got as exhaust perk a sprint boost when you fall from higher ground down. And you don't stagger like usuall. And when you are already exhaust you still don't stagger with BL.
---
Nah, I slug the DS that‚Äôs acting toxic. If the teammates are super altruistic I‚Äôll just slug them all since they are right there.
---
For real. People act like it's a bad perk. I only use it if the killer is bad and I've looped them for 3 or 4 gens to give everyone else the time to do the last 2. 
---
The new ds changes are shit. It's not going to stop tunneling and punishes the survivor for using it. There are some super petty ass bitches that play this game. You got run for an entire match? Face camp, you used a flash light to save someone? Face camp, you ran around a loop 3 times and got killed by hitbox issues through the pallet? Facecamp. You managed to get that pallet stun without getting hit through it? Face camp. You exist on the map and did anything that someone doesn't like? Tunnel and face camp. The fact there's a timer on ds now is stupid as well. It isn't going to stop a shitty person from doing shitty things. 
---
The fact that there are a lot of streamers out there that think this is even a good change is stupid as fuck. They think it's a good change because of whatever stupid ass reason they have. "Oh no it wastes my time" so does looking for totems, ruin, toth, and having to run from a tunneling cunt the entire match. But let's nerf DS because the low skilled cry about it. The only streamer that I know that doesn't complain about it is tru3. He knows it's coming. They use it ir they dont or they miss it. Oh well, shit happens, it's part of the game.
---
I'm super annoyed they're nerfing it because of cry baby noobs. The new meta is gonna be slug builds on killers now because of the change.  That's not healthy for the game. No one likes sitting on the ground doing nothing and most just afk as soon as it happens. 
---
So many people are saying that haha
---
How did that survivor reach 30k? They buffed survivor point gain?
---
We are Rare sightings these days, idk why üò¢

Is it? Doesn't it reward you more for winning chases quickly and keeping them short?

It‚Äôs not franks mixtape/cold dirt, so did they get salty lol
---
Lmao at Dwight.
---
I fucking knew that would happen after seeing all these upvotes
---
I don't understand the ones that just stand there right under the hook self-caring knowing full well that I'm probably on my way back and will be there any second. I mean, you're a one-hit down literally standing still right next to a hook. I'm not gonna just run past you at that point, especially if there are no other obvious targets because the person who unhooked you is long-gone. Heh. 
---
Sprint burst doesn‚Äôt really help with looping. Actually all exhaustion perks really aren‚Äôt made for looping. They are there to get to a loop or escape the loop. Windows is by far the best perk just because you can see loops you can use. After you learn map setups you don‚Äôt need it. Lightweight, dance with me and quick and quiet are great looping perks. Iron
---
Will is nice to sneak out of the loop. Mostly looping is all about the survivor. You have to know when to use a pallet and be willing to take a hit instead of wasting a pallet to get another few loops before you drop the pallet to escape. The key to looping is know the loop set up and use loops with safe pallets and double windows. 
---
woah blocks dont add anything to his power and turn him into 3 second fedora man. 
---
seriously though, why do people think that the block addons are his best addons, they are the worst of his non niche addons
---
Did they change that? I never get swamp (thank god).
---
True
---
Windows of opportunity until you get to know the loop. Then probably dead hard or balanced landing
---
:3
---
Remember, tunneling and camping is the killer playing smart.
---
Moris and broken killer add ons are fun.
---
Survivors who teabag and click flashlights deserve to be tunneled and camped. But then again it's just the killer playing smart, so there is nothing bad about that.
---
Killers can't be toxic. I love this sub. c:
---
I had a Michael who lost his ruin 4 seconds into the game and instead of DCing or face camping he decided to farm with us all instead. He was actually really funny (one of the other survs missed a skill check so he insta-downed her then stood there nodding while the rest of us teabagged her)  and I‚Äôd just had two back to back games of face campers who basically 5 gen‚Äôd us cause my team was too altruistic so it was refreshing! 
---
I don't get it, is NA a lot or more toxic than EU, because I met exactly one moonwalking legion, few with Frank's mixtapes, but they really didn't do much, both times few people escaped.
---
*Then stop complaining and do a gen. Nobody owes you altruism points.*
---
Yeah you should prioritise the spray.
---
That‚Äôs like saying Distressing is OP on Doc because it incentivizes not using his power after he hit 8k. Don‚Äôt worry about BPS in-game. Just play well.
---
Meant removed the timer for the chase, so that if you escape the killer and don't get back into the chase for some time then the perk expires.
---
I didn't mean they should keep it forever, that was not my intention.
---
The duck did you say
---
Just keep one cleansed all round.
---
Then tunneling doesn't exist and is a made up concept. Got it.
---
Yeah, the absolute lack of self-awareness is what keeps the community pretty toxic. All it really takes is for someone to ask themselves "Am I being a dick by playing this way?" or "How would I feel if I was the other guy right now?"
---
I get that there's no obligation to make sure anyone else has fun, but there's a difference between having fun and playing like a sociopath.
---
What‚Äôs sad is that black wards are less common than moris but tbh those are even worse to go against than a mori

---
Optional objectives don't make the game harder for anyone.
---
Or even if you do. Getting a 4k with no gens done, also doesn't give you a pip if the game lasts less than 10 mins and you don't reach more than 10 hook events. its ridiculously specific.  In other words all survivors have to do to cost the killer their pip is hook rush, making the killer lose points for having to stay around the hook in order to get them while losing points from hook proximity, and all get 1 hooked. To me, taking advantage of survivor stupidity and finishing the game quickly shouldn't be a punishable offense.
---
&gt;They aren‚Äôt trying to punish killers for downing someone who just got unhooked they are giving survivors who cry about it a perk that will help them escape. 
---
Survivors already have that perk. It's called Desicive Strike. It's being nerfed because of cry babies. DS already has counters. They're making its use to punish hook tunneling killers. The ones who specifically break a chase they're in or stop doing literally anything they're doing to go back for the unhooked survivor. Which is why there is a 60 second timer on it now and making it so it can only be used if you've been hooked recently. 
---
It's a direct punishment to bad behaviour of scummy killers that are ruining the game for the people playing it because DS can't be used if the time runs out. If they want to punish killers who play like that as well as another point nerf for camping the hook then they need to make DS usable twice per match instead of the one time because they only need to bloodlust then slug to completely ignore the punishment they're about to get for being a piece of shit. 
---
Or, they can keep the current DS and allow it to be used in the pick up animation the same way they're doing with the nerf. If killers cry that DS take up to much of their time then being able to use it right away negates that and they can get right back to doing what they were before, being a huge piece of shit.

You can survive a shot to the chest with an 8mm Mauser ( 7.92√ó57mm). There are a lot of factors that contribute to what would lead to instant death or loss of concipusness.
---
My uncle was shot in the side of the head with a 7.62x54mmR, and he was only briefly stunned, though he needed several surgeries after he finished the fire fight.
---
Then again, he was a Force Recon Marine in 'Nam, so maybe he was just too angry to die.

Did the exits block when you left the museum?

tried the range, seems to be 2 steps by the killer from the locker, whatever you make of that.

The Doormat: Possibly an ex-survivor main, turned killer. Tries to do everything possible to make sure the survivors have a good game short of throwing the match - making sure everyone gets 3-hooked, leaving hooks immediately and making every save trivial. Would rather let two survivors get away from them than end up tunneling someone off the hook. Has never ran NOED, Frank's etc in their life. Goes to church to confess the usage of any iridescent addons. Any remaining survivor can expect to be more or less guided to the hatch. While knowing their game pretty well, they are generally too eager to give up control/pressure. Oddly, nothing bothers them - toxic survivors, bad matches etc - except one thing. Finding theirselves playing survivor and seeing killers who don't play by their own odd rules.

It‚Äôs inevitable someone will step in a trap if the trapper is decently good and knows about map pressure. Thing is, the killer will force the survivors to step into his trap when he‚Äôs chasing them. It‚Äôs your job as a survivor to check the main loop spots to see if there is a trap and to disarm it
---
Can confirm the squad stereotype is 100% accurate. We‚Äôre on PlayStation so killers and low so we know not to make them quit so we usually try to mess each other up or have contest to see who can sit in the basement lockers the longest. Also sandbagging. We‚Äôve played so long we‚Äôve playing playing with each other a challenge :p
---
I‚Äôm like 50/50 forever noob and veteran noob, lul. Got the game because one of my friend wouldn‚Äôt shut up about it and begged me. As soon as I got it he stopped talking to me. Now I‚Äôm playing alone and suck arse at this game. Stuck at green ranks(tho I‚Äôve been in rank 6 when I played in November). Don‚Äôt play much because I get salty too fast. 
---
Go away with your bait
---
You can survive but he was directly shot at where the center of the ribs are and if it goes deep enough it can hit one of your lungs but the impact to the bone would already make you unable to do almost anything. 
---
And it's much different if you get shot in the side of the head. If it doesn't hit the brain it's the same as getting shot in one of the feet. There's little to no blood loss and minimal pain. All it would do is work up a huge adrenaline rush (at the time of being shot) which helps you more than anything really. 
---
It's only good if the killer is right there facecamping you. If you run them around for any amount of time the perk will expire by the time you go down.
---
It will never get used if you are decent at survivor as the perk will just expire. Not to mention the fact that against leatherface or billy or other m1 killers who usually run enduring the stun will be less than 2 seconds as right now the stun is only at 3 seconds. You can't get any distance with that.
---
Eh?
---
According to some survivor mains, the only way to play Legion correctly is not playing them at all.  
---
If you have at least half a brain, though, you'll know that you don't need to follow some survivors' made up rules and restrictions and just enjoy yourself. You're a killer. Go kill.  
---
Legion is one of the weakest killers anyway, "bested" only by Freddy (and maybe Wraith), even if survivor mains hate to admit it\*, so just try your best.  
---
\*Sometimes I wonder if all they're really trying to do is defend their pride after actually dying to a Legion. I like to think that the kind of people who hate Legion so darn vehemently are the same people who die to a Freddy. It makes their tears sweeter.  
---
This is coming from a fellow survivor main, by the way.
---
I wouldn't call 10 minute game fast. For me it's normal length. And it's kinda reassuring to see that this kind of games is viable at purple ranks.
---
I needs tha piggy
---
While OP is definitely in a wrong by a lot this is the wrong point to make regarding swf. No one cares about people playing with their friends, they care about the sharing of information that gives them all an unfair advantage over the killer.

I did the mori with ira hatchets and belt once. Game was over so quick I decided to never mori with that build again. I think I nearly depipped

Oh shit yeah I never thought about that. 
---
lmao so many downvotes for giving an opinion. 
---
I actually say sorry when I run it. It was EZ because it was broken. Whoever you ran into is an asshole.
---
Hey! No worries, I had no idea who the obsession was and they were mucking around. I tried to kill them second but they kept running between pallets and I almost accidentally downed them. So I went off and found/killed the Jake, then the obsession started bobbing so I killed her too. Finally found you downstairs with the crows!
---
I wasn't going to complain about the obsession being silly though - sorry i didn't let you do a generator or two! I've attempted this achievement more times that I could count, so I immediately wanted to finish it. 
---
  
---
Good luck in getting it in the future! :)
---
Ok but like it‚Äôs impossible at rank 1-4, and double pip? They were hard to get then, now they‚Äôre impossible to get. (Pretty much)
---
Just go to any solo survivor stream on twitch. It's not just me. No matter how good you are at the game, if you have garbo teammates then you can't do anything. 
---
Plagues mid tier. Not weak. 
---
Killers lose more emblem points if they remain close to the hook. 
---
Here is their eBay item number 173516587461  
---
Excuse me, I got the game in beta your nurse main card seems to be wrong.
---
Because it's only good if the killer is right there after the unhook and tries to hook you back immediately.
---
If you are any good at survivor the perk will expire in a chase before you are able to use it. Even if you use it, the effect is awful as it's nerfed to a 3 seconds stun, which even without enduring which nerfs it to a less than 2 seconds stun doesn't let you gain any meaningful distance.
---
Even in its intended niche situation, the reworked DS is not strong at all in that specific situation.
---
Plus if the killer downs you as soon as you get unhooked then they will usually slug you to go down the unhooker as well, making your perk useless.
---
It's better to run any other decent perk above the new DS, as you will get use out of that perk more often than once per 10 games.
---
Just keep trying! I went through well over a dozen black ward/tuft+tombstone combinations before I finally got it!
---
I used Ruin, Overcharge, PWYF and M+A. And I burned a Game offering. 
---
Good luck!
---
The Plagues not billy or nurse tier but she's solidly mid tier.
---
Do I hear no mither viability? 
---
The game is more balanced now than it ever has been. I still remember when hooks never respawned after sabo and slugging was meta. If OP can't beat a swf on coms, he generally just isnt good. 
---
See, that's fine. I'll disarm 'em when I spot one, but that usually ends up with someone on my team stepping into one in plain site while they were running (Usually from nothing and they don't even have a perk on to hide their tracks). Trapper walks by and whacks em on the head and they're as good as dead.
---
Played fair : Try-Hard or Sweaty killer
---
Played optimally : Tunneler or Trash killer
---
It's good that you saw it with your own two eyes and not someone else's.
---
Same tbh. I'm lazy tho and I play on PS4 so that shit ain't comin out for a while.
---
Is this all in the same T3? Or can you get it from multiple T3 level ups?
---
I made a guide you can use here: [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49959/a-guide-to-legion#latest](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49959/a-guide-to-legion#latest)
---
They keep saying "there's more to playing killer well than just getting kills, and we want to reward that," but in most people's minds... there really isn't more to it than that. Killers, above all, just want to kill people. They keep trying out these crazy emblem systems in an effort to make it seem like killers can "win" and are strong without actually being able to kill anyone, and really, does anyone care? Idgaf about pips. Gimme my kills.
---
They really need to just throw in the towel, recognize the community just wants to kill people (not defend gens or delay the game), go back to victory cube scoring and balance the game around kills again, not all this other nonsense.
---
Well she's 5% faster than Huntress and has an arc
---
It's not coming out for awhile for everyone...
---
Thanks! 
---
ho hello you are one of those survivors i guess  ( ^_^)„Éé
---
Tea bagging at the gates don't bother me, it's the last lone survivor going full immersion to find the hatch for 10 minutes that triggers me.
---
The problem comes in why a killer might end up tunneling or camping. I personally don't like playing in a way that will ruin the fun of other players, even if it means I'll lose (even if the gates are powered and I hook someone, I try to stray from the hook so someone can make a rescue attempt, then I go for the rescuer, usually).
---
However, there are games where I've played so poorly, or the survivors have simply played so well, that I feel like if I want to salvage any amount of dignity, I'm going to have to hook, patrol, and tunnel down someone at the end, just so I'm not left completely empty handed. I don't mean to ruin someone else's experience, but even by that point if I'm sorta camping them and tunneling them, they've already won the game and probably gotten a boatload of BP. Besides, if they've played that well up to that point, they'll probably save their hooked friend anyway without me being able to stop it, depending on who I'm playing, since I very rarely run NOED these days.
---
My issue is, however, that a Mori and broken killer addons are generally obnoxious, but they're still part of the game, much like DS, flashlight saves (very hard now, admittedly), and some of the infinite loops that are still in the game.
---
Doing something to specifically taunt a killer, knowing that the person is going to take it as an insult, and then getting buttblasted when they retaliate just seems like a really odd position to take. Not saying you take this position, but I keep seeing it reduced to, "Why do you care about just a few taps of a key? Why does that make you so mad?" You can reduce any behavior to what the physical action is, ignoring the intent of the action and the likely outcomes resulting from it.
---
Let's legion reduce the amount of times he has to hit you by 1, it makes it feel pretty instant and there is no counter
---
You'll only ever see a "GG" if all 4 escape. If more than one person dies though, you're trash.
---
It was probably lag, on the killers screen, it probably lined up perfectly. There were spirts of lag throughout the video. I‚Äôve heared Tru3 say how killer screen and survivor screens have different timings or something like that, and lag can affect that
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
I have a friend who 100% is the veteran noob lol. Awesome post. 
---
I haven't seen anybody do it in-game, but there are photos from the files with the prestige cosmetics. You can look at them [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O2pERy1GRn4tFZwKcN1FQkwVllDOtmyQbDXJGo7kGzA/edit?usp=sharing) 
---
Damn I feel old too. I remember waiting in line at the store for an early release copy with friends and then proceeding to pull an all nighter
---
Hah. Funny !!
---
No one is claiming that the person who farms and sandbags their teammate isn't a completely asshole. You keep missing the part where the killer who hits and rehooks someone who got farmed isn't necessarily an asshole, but a killer who doesn't want to handicap themselves, and possibly lose, because one player was being a fucking idiot / asshole.
---
Person, I try to go after the player who was farming their teammates, and not immediately go after someone who was just unhooked before I could even leave the hook. This will change, however, depending on how well the survivors are doing, or if the person who gets unhooked was being a dick before I hooked them (teabag, flashlight macro trying to make me DC).
---
I've lost games because I didn't go after the person who was farmed, because I wasn't playing a strong killer, and the person who did the farming turned out to be really good at looping, while his teammates just ate the gens.
---
Yeah, I played by the unwritten "honor" code this sub seems to love to jerk off to, but all it did was make me lose the game, and potentially get a, "gg ez baby killer" response at the end.
---
It‚Äôs survivors own faults. They are assholes to killers and killers become toxic or play nurse, legion, whatever to get revenge. 
---
Same goes for toxic killers. They create toxic survivors. That‚Äôs my opinion anyway. 
---
Implying you'll be able to stay at rank 1 with the new ranking changes
---
As killer i always try not to be toxic
---
*unless the survivors are toxic to me, and in that case its just payback*
---
1.1. Isn't that essentially the same as saying Freddy's power is shit in comparison?
---
1.2. I am aware that other killers take the same amount of time. My point is that the time other killers take is too much. Freddy has stall, which means he can afford to take that amount of time.
---
1. The best survivors will always win unless it's an omegablinks Nurse. Spirit is not Nurse-tier. You forgot Hag.
---
2. If they run loops, you mindgame them. Learn the timing of your visibility and get the free hit that way. Most windows in the game can be mindgamed with M1 mindgames as well.
---
8.2. Bottle gives you free hits or pallets, yes, but not quick enough. That is Clown's problem. I don't know why I have to keep repeating myself either. Stall is needed because survivors can do gens quickly no matter how much time you spend chasing. Nurse, Hag, Billy and Spirit - the killers we agree are the best, with Hag and Spirit being different opinions - all have chase power AND mobility power. If chase was the only thing that mattered, Billy would not be top tier. Huntress would be, which you don't think is the case. Maybe stall means nothing without chase. But chase means nothing without stall. There needs to be a balance.
---
8.3. If a survivor plays correctly then Myers and Pig don't get jack shit. Playing correctly in this case just means having eyes and looking around instead of brainlessly holding M1.
---
1. Nurses can be mindgamed and stealthed. Spirit's counter is to not camp the pallet and not vault over to her when she stands still. Hag? If a trap goes off and Hag is already chasing you, you are almost guaranteed to get hit if she teleports fast enough. This is only helped by the fact that phantasms swing your camera towards them, which disrupts your momentum.
---
You aren't wasting your time by getting pallet drops, and survivors are on the time limit of pallets being eaten. When pallets are gone, on most maps, that's gg. Freddy has a significantly longer time limit than most killers.
---
No, not everyone can bait pallets like Freddy, because not everyone flickers in and out of existence at set times. (Spirit doesn't count, because hers is random and you have no way of knowing when you're invisible. Freddy has set times.) Chase means nothing without stall.
---
If you're chasing as Freddy then you'd better be chasing them into a deadzone, or you really are wasting your time. It is extremely easy to put multiple survivors to sleep, and even easier to continuously put them to sleep after they wake up, since they tell you where they are.
---
I'm starting to think we're not getting a Scream chapter
---
Hell yeah it's a lady, I do love me some ladies, hell yeah. 
---
Probably not, people here are just over exaggerating the issue with Legion. The problem is they aren‚Äôt fun to play against for a lot of people and they use the OP add ons and such as an excuse for their DCs. 
---
Thee emblem changes are so stupid. Like, god forbid the last survivor finds the hatch and i don¬¥t get a 4k.
---
I think she is cool af 
---
Your reward for running the killer is the killer losing 2 to 3 gens, assuming your teammates aren't all blowing each other in the corner of the map.
---
Unless your teammates are all starting a new gen the very second you get unhooked, that minute is going to be more than enough time for a killer to lose complete control of the match, since they'll all know someone is in a chase, and don't have to worry about being chased off of gens.
---
Do me a favor, go watch it!!!!!! It is so much better than the remake. I promise. That's alright lol, but for sure go watch it, at least the first. Maybe first through dream warriors. 
---
I'm a veteran noob. I know I'm not very good. Probably because I play the game every three months or so and then move on. I just try to have fun. 
---
That was me. Thank you so much &lt;3
---
Aren't people allowed to ask why you like him?
---
Personally I dont get hatch standoffs. Very easily countered. As survivor, be cautious and try to find killer before hatch. If you see hatch jump in. If you see killer at hatch, go to exit gate. As killer, just freaking hit the guy instead of being a turd got one kill. Simple. 
---
Nea looks like she both farted and shit herself 
---
You can like whomever you want, I just chose to not associate with you depending on who these people are.
---
Man, just watch Puppers or Monto when they play Rank 1 survivor against Rank 1 Nurses. They can usually juke the absolute shit out of high level Nurses.
---
What makes a Nurse broken is her ability to have more than 2 blinks. Personally, Nurse should have a max of 3 blinks, with a 3rd blink being the result of an Ultra-Rare.
---
2 blink / default Nurse can be pretty tricky to use in certain maps, and good survivors can be really difficult to catch. You toss a 3rd blink into the mix, and it suddenly becomes EZ mode, unless you're really potato with blinks. 4 and 5 blinks have some pretty significant drawbacks if you miss, but it's still absolutely disgusting.
---
because what you explained was just punishing unsafe unhooks which isn't the same as tunneling.
---
When the killer is stubborn enough to literally ignore 3 other people and only focus on 1 guy that is how they get genrushed, and now they have to deal with 3 people at end game who all still have 3 hook states assuming you even killed the guy you tunneled by then and aren't still chasing him after the gates are powered.
---
Not to mention there are several killers whose power works best when they affect multiple people with it; Doctor, Nightmare, Michael, Pig, Legion, and now Plague. And others whose power work best if they don't use it for just tunneling/camping such as Trapper and Hag.
---
When a killer chases a survivor for 5+ minutes and downs them, that's a victory for the survivors not the killer. When the killer is then to stubborn to chase anybody afterwords, that's not smart. When the killer drops whatever he's doing on the other side of the map to just walk back to where he hooked the last guy he chased, that leaves the other survivors uncontested to just continue working on escaping, that's not smart.
---
Especially now with the emblem changes, it actually is better to hook everybody 2 times at least since in the PTB you need at least 10 hooks + 4 kills to even get iri, combined with the camping penalty on another emblem. So rank wise you will most likely safety pip or even depip if you play in a tunneling way.
---
Sure tunneling can be effective against low rank or over-altruistic teams, but there are far better ways to play as killer that gives you more BP, more emblem score, and can lead to more 3-4ks.
---
I mean, her chant is kind of connected to her lore. Not to her ability directly, per se, but everything she does is for her religious faith. So it it kind of makes sense from that standpoint. 
---
If it was in a recognizable language, I would honestly hate it. But because, like you said, it's in a dead (and likely not authentic) language, it works. 
---
Lol, even if not unhooking....if I happen to run into someone injured getting chased, I'm going to jump in and take a hit. Be a distraction. Maybe that means I'll be the one on the hook....but that's why I have kindred. It'll make unhooking me more efficient for everyone when they can all see each other. 
---
I agree
---
Memes aside, she isn‚Äôt the best to look at imo 
---
i keep telling myself that i shouldn't care what survivors say and yet i still care. it's no biggie though, again i can just play Spirit soooo no worries, i guess?
---
Can they really tho? 
---
Ok then stop playing their game? Tf is your point
---
While you're absolutely right, I do wonder why they run the PTB for so long. I'm not on PC so I can't attest from a personal standpoint, but I feel like after 5 days or so, most streamers switch back to the regular server because the PTB is so dead by then. I honestly think they could get away with running the PTB for one week and gather the data they need from it. 
---
He cornered/trapped them
---
That's why I said the only real changes I feel Nurse needs, at least for now, would be to change her addons, such as reducing her max blinks to 3, and making that an ultra-rare. 
---
Most of Nurse addons are kind of problematic, since they can really mess with timing of blinking onto someone, or having drawbacks like extended fatigue time, or reducing how long you can charge a follow up blink. I wish they did more to change up how her power works, rather than just being straight up nerfs or buffs to aspects of her power.
---
Honestly, the reason I loved playing Nurse wasn't just because she was crazy strong, but because I got into this game kind of late, and with BBQ and Chili, she was very easy to farm BP with since I didn't need to dump addons into her to make her viable. I really enjoy playing Doctor, but he's absolute ass without addons against survivors who know what they're doing.
---
They've been talking about it. Not_Queen seems to agree that secondary objectives are the way to go ala those piece of shit that could be cleansed. 
---
What's the hold up? Who knows?
---
It could be that they're working on it and it's going to take forever because the devs work insanely slowly. Reminder: it took 11 months for the DS nerf to finally happen after they first brought it up last year when Clown came out. They could also be bracing for the inevitable tidal wave of whining and crying from Survivor Mains. When you look at all the balance changes they've done in the last year it looks less like they're just slow at fixing things and more like they're weaning the Survivor base.
---
Yup. I always go full commitment whenever i see its possible and that usually gets me facecamping privleges üòÇ
---
Puppers can't run a good Nurse for 5 gens like he can with every other killer, but he can still waste enough of their time to allow his teammates to bang out a couple of gens each chase.
---

You can also find Jane's at the same page :-) 
---
Which one?
---
Just saying theres a huge difference between ocasional rank 1 nurse and nurse main, you think puppers gets zubat chasing him for a couple of gens ? I highly highly doubt that
---
Check my last comment before this one  
---
Ah
---
Rank 1 survivors are the worst, some of the most toxic, salty people alive. You will never see a "gg" if you get a 4k. Either you're a shit killer somehow even though you killed all 4, or you camped, tunneled, blah blah but if you camped or tunneled then you wouldn't get a 4k unless the survivors don't work on objectives. And if that's the case then it's their faults they died lmao. Post game chat is fun.
---
Good riddance.
---
Nice...
---
Thanks, and no kidding they couldn't atleast make it like a special item? I thought those were just standard that every character came with two cosmetics? I really dislike this anticonsumerist approach behaviour is taking...
---
From the wiki:  For each other Survivor still alive, grant a **1**/**2**/**3**¬†% bonus to Luck to ***all*** remaining Survivors. The only time it doesn't affect you is when you are the Last Survivor or Dead.
---
Do other gens to get him off hatch. Or just jump in. It goes both ways with waiting. The survivor sitting on hatch waiting to get hit is just as bad as killer waiting for survivor to leave. If you dont just rush to find hatch straight away you can for gens to get him thinking about other things and keeping him off hatch. If he doesnt leave do all gens and escape
---
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY UPDOOT!
---
I feel so conflicted when I play now because I honestly love playing legion (p3 50 btw), but i feel bad just because I know how many people hate him. I haven't moonwalked since a couple days after his release because I realised how stupid and genuinely unfair it is, and I really only use Frank's if I'm in red ranks, but even then not often. So I do try to play him fairly but the hate does still come in pretty much every second game... Idk kev, I just wanna play my edgy stabbo boi guilt-free

I felt pitty for him when I read "you looked arround for a solid minute" like he was lost in this life xD
---
I agreed the rank system should be way harder just not as harsh as PTB. And should be specially harder on survivor side imo, on rank 1 alone there is a huuuuuuuuuge skill gap, you see both skilled players and very very often immersive urban evasion  scared team mates with very low understanding on which moves to make and when to (0 care about pallet management, not going straight away for hooks as soon as a 2nd player is beeing carried to a hook, dropping pallets after hits, camping pallets, huge amount of time wasted hiding roaming etc etc, affraid of being productive inside terror radius , luring the killer into gens beeing worked or players hooked and all that jazz, just very low game sense overall that players with the best rank possible should have) Just goes to show you dont need to know the basics to go up, a bit of minimum mechanics knowledge and time invested in the game will do the trick. I feel like dbd rank is more of a 'how much time you have been putting into the game' rather than 'how good are you at the game'.

I'm especially proud of what I did for MacMillan Estate.

yeah good idea, i'll change it

I appreciate that they're trying to make it harder to pip, but they are approaching it the wrong way
---
Thanks man. Kate really does look like a hooker though...
---
Nah fam.That is only against a legion.
---
Yeah holding M1 on gen is totally the same as holding shift in chases. Talking about silly arguments)
---
Well played sir
---
I liked it except for the last line. Too hostile, IMO. Keep it memey.

It'll be fun a few matches. But there's gonna be a lot of dcs

That's pretty much how they've always been for me unless I run Pharmacy. üòÖ

*tips sack-on-head and strangles you*
---
Killer should've farmed. 
---
I've gotten my achievements so I've given up on rank and the ranking system. The devs don't understand it at all and every change they make to it is embarrassing. 
---
I think this is ok mods. Game-related edit. I did my best

That's why they're asking....
---
A Splicer, that's what you are.

I feel like she‚Äôs better than the other m1 killers except spirit/maaaaybe Michael.

Not true i often gg when i died and get gg when i killed 4. Most of the time its toxic chat i get tho
---
Complete with Censor Beep. 
---
Yes. Not sure on madness but the other two yes 
---
HAHAHAHA. No
---
Theres nothing to adapt to. He uses his power and vaults over pallets and windows fast, he runs faster than you, insane lunge range, no cooldown for even missing an attack. There‚Äôs literally nothing you can do as a survivor to counter a Legion other than rush generators and hope at least two of you get out.
---
Camping as freddy is just a longer version of tunneling.
---
Yes but then it would be a sea of average. No advantages to be had.  I play high ranks not to smash noobs but so that I can make a mistake and not punished for it.  So I ca enjoy the game leisurely.  If I die, I die. If I 4K. I 4K. No difference except blood-points.  What you guys don‚Äôt understand is that I play hours on end day after day.  I only get an hour here an hour there. I‚Äôm only devotion 2.  Say what you will about depipping and good luck on your journey to be a #1 ranked player.  Tru3 is a streamer.  He also destroys games when he plays them.  The game is currently a ptb.  They might or might not fix the pipping issue.  What I find the most hilarious part about watching him play is that when he has a dc in his match, it doesn‚Äôt matter how good of a game he played, no pip.  Therefore until they fix it, when I keep depipping at the end of s session it will actually punish killers.....
---
Run fast
---
Very fast
---
Nice.
---
Nahhh... more like we have Hex: Ruin. 
---
Nah y‚Äôall are reaching 
---
A high skill curve shouldn't be enough reason for something to autowin the game smh at all of the people saying "WeLl nUrSE HArd sO ITs K"
---
You can change your button mapping in the options. I put pallet drop etc on X. The labels are a little confusing though, but just go near a pallet or whatever while you're adjusting them
---
\*does weird dbd survivor 'thank you' twerk\*
---
It's probably not the players survivors are really mad at tbh. It's more of the fact that this game is becoming more and more killer favoured 
---
you didn't leave the map immediatley after the hook you obviously camped that's a fact
---
Same with rank 1 killers
---
It's a magical place
---
Pretty sure he was listing things toxic survivor say when playing against a fair killer and one who is trying to win
---
I don't think that's a good idea. That many map offerings would just clutter up our inventories and it would take way too long to get map offerings for the map we actually want. Even now it's a pain in the ass to get them.
---
Also, did you really refer to Shelter Woods as Pallet Woods? Yikes. There are like 5 pallets on that map now. If you have a bad time as killer on that map, that's completely on you.
---
 I hate it when you say that, you should say "Cheers, to the Ninety Ninth Precinct!". 
---
It‚Äôs about sending a message Sam.

ENTITY DISPLEASED

---
i don't think it's toxic to play the game that way. if the unhooking survivor is bad enough to continue the unhooking even though it's obvious you're right there, that's on them for farming, not on the killer that's taking what's given to them. you're of course entitled to your opinion but if i were the survivor being unhooked, i'd be pissed at my teammate for unhooking me in front of the killer without BT, not at the killer. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Is Wraith really considered that bad? I‚Äôve been on a Wraith kick lately and I‚Äôve been dominating red ranks with him with fairly basic addons.
---
Beeing good at chases is just a mix between right decisions and experience. You gotta plan your escape route before you are actually on a chase. The fact is you will suck at chases for a good time until you figure it out. But for that to happen you need to get chased millions of times, fail hard, fail harder , fail better until you start being decent. People need to force themselves to get chased in order to get better. If you choose to be immersive you wont get any better. Just my 2 cents anyways
---
The only alternative you speak of is that the survivor escapes in both scenarios. "Hit him and let him escape" sounds pretty biased. The point is to have both sides be as equal in terms of getting the match over and giving the survivor the mercy of the hatch but still letting the killer atleast have the opportunity of getting the 4k without having to slug before hatch opens.
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Fight and earn that badge. The grind and sweat is becoming real. No more hand outs
---
If I were you I'd look on twitch at small streamers that lack commentary funding and just rather record play, search DBD and go near the bottom of the live streamers. 
---
Gonna have to say middleman and meme lord. I've reached over 500 hours and I cant take the game seriously. I've said git gud as a joke but honestly if I eat shit on either side I still joke around with either side after the games done or I just let them play. I was eating ramen noodles one time and when I started eating match started so I kept alternating between eating and playing so I was asked why I kept stopping mid chase.
---
ho yes maybe my bad if that's it D:
---
It's really not. Speaking as someone who is consistently in red ranks for killer/survivor it's pretty heavily survivor favored outside of shitty hitboxes.
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVxu-iuXbZI) you go! 
---
They have tons of other no commentary DbD videos too, dating all the way back to the Beta.
---
Well that's what we have now, killer can grab out of the animation, but the standoff comes when both are there and if the killer attacks, survivor gets out while killer has wipe animation, or survivor jumps in and gets grabbed, which wont happen unless the survivor gives up.
---
Have you tried uninstalling or reinstalling the game? Or maybe clear your cache?
---
Imagine still complaining about the second weakest killer in the game. Why would anyone DC against an easy win 
---
No, dont just immediately run looking for hatch as killer, but instead, try to find the survivor. Run bbq, whispers, strider, there are perks designed to help you find survivors. And if they are hidden and you cant find them before they can escape, shouldn't they be able to escape? And as survivor you have other alternatives other than just using the hatch. You have an entire map to do gens and whatnot to escape. 
---
Definitely enjoyed this, some were spot on and others were a bit ehhh.  The streamer being a depressed rock hits 95% of streams I hit follow on after I play with/versus them in game. That‚Äôs brilliant
---
Not just me buddy, whole community says he trash theres loads of memes about legion because he‚Äôs worse then freddy but you know 
---
A lot of Huntresses throw the hatchet from mid to close range where the puke would also reach and since it's a stream, you're likely to get tagged. As for dodging at loops and obstacles it gets harder due to the aforementioned arc and she's faster so winding up at a pallet is less risky.
---
So then you loop him like every one else his power can't let him catch or hit 
---
Does Bruno Mars is gay?
---
Talk about a buff
---
But i mean the grab animation should be usable during any killer animation, including attack recovery time.
---
Not everything needs to pause during chase.
---
If you can last that long, you're likely pretty good at the game, which is where the old DS was BS, as if it was on a good player, the killer was punished for doing their job. Imagine how much it would suck if the first gen activation also downed whoever popped it. That was kinda old DS.
---
Stopping timer would encourage you running to the killer.
---
Current one is to help prevent when you get downed right after being unhooked without a chance to run and such.
---
The player count certainly does take a heavy dip after a few days but I can only imagine there are still enough people playing for them to get some solid data.
---
Why thank you. 
---
Don't let this distract you from the fact that most of the Pig her addons are bad.
---
It‚Äôs what trash talk and trash... play? Is supposed to be taken as. For some reason people think it‚Äôs the worst thing ever. I mean if I get teabagged or beckoned  at a loop. I‚Äôll play ball and go after them. People lumping play like this with toxic behaviours like hate speech baffles me sometimes. 
---
What are you playing on?  I get games much faster with Killer than survivor but it really matters on the region or time of day you play
---
&gt; but I guarantee there are still plenty 
---
Oh, well, as a survivor main, I guarantee you there aren't "plenty". There are too few, actually. That's why they up the minimum amount of pallets on that map on the PTB if I recall correctly.
---
The amount of safe loops is not that big as you make it out to be. And have you thought about that maybe, just maybe, there need to be more safe loops on that map because half of it is literally nothing but corn?
---
I actually tested this too, and not even 8 stacks on Save The Best For Last is good enough. It might have been possible to recover fast enough back when it stacked with Unrelenting, but sadly no dice even with the fastest possible recovery nowadays. 
---
I think of it as the textbook definition of a get out of jail free card. "Sure, let's punish the killer for capitalizing on our mistakes!"
---
Teabag me and I'll actually play seriously against you instead of just having fun. Be obnoxious and I'll actually pause my music and stop handicapping myself.
---
Get out of jail free card, anyone?!
---
I JUST REALLY WANNA PUKE ON EVERYONE DAMMIT
---
Xbox light theme ewwww
---
I mean 5k is one green node on a bloodweb. It's still a decent amount of points. And if things had been going well for me the whole game only to take a NOED to the face (when the killer was otherwise performing incredibly badly) it's a little annoying to have to miss out on that.
---
It can be- most of the time it isn‚Äôt but if I have he choice to just flat out remove a survivor from the equation of keeping gens down. That‚Äôs the smartest play. It‚Äôs not smart to waste all your time trying to do that , but if it pops up, sometimes it‚Äôs the better call. Sure it may not be fun for the other side but nobody plays to make the other side have fun, idk where this came from survivors don‚Äôt make the game fun for the killer. Object of the game is win, let people do what they want as long as it isn‚Äôt cheating to win.  
---
NICE ME ME ME LIKE
---
He looks like Tylers dad on that episode of The Eric Andre Show
---
Well the problem with that is that if you smacked a survivor at a window or pallet youd immediately be able to just grab them when they try to vault.
---
that would just make it completely killer sided and would force a standoff in the corner of the map instead of on top of the hatch 
---
Uh, I'd say I'm a mix of the meme-lord and middle-man. My Steam bio has an edgy meme sentence about school shootings. My profile picture is Ariana Grande though. BUT my usernames tend to be somewhat meme-ish or thirsty as hell. I do love playing David and Kate, they're not my mains though. " Shockingly very good at the game despite their goofy personality. Never rude post-game and always says gg. Probably has a Tumblr " is extremely accurate, lol. And I am female.
---
As for the middle-man, I play killers and survivors equally and I do have a lot of wisdom. A lot of smol tips and tricks. But the rest of it is really inaccurate. 
---
Lol
---
No, even if something is really hard it shouldn't mean that it wins in any situations if you can handle it. That's not how balance works.
---
If you play league of legends, imagine if Azir or Ryze were insanely broken again, would it be fair to keep them as overpowered because they are hard to handle?
---
*laughs in 60 FPS*
---
Unfortunately Sony and Microsoft won't allow a (potentially) buggy game that could cause hard crashes and brick consoles. Well, I guess that doesn't stop COD from releasing games (with over 80 fucking crash fixes after a month. EIGHTY! WTF!?) so maybe they should allow people to opt into the PTB. People want to brick their console? Let them, maybe they'll buy a new one.
---
Obviously. I give the unhooked person about a minute to reset and heal while I go after others. After that, if I see someone injured in dream state self caring in a pallet dead zone, they're going down. 
---
Tbh I'll happily take the benefits of KB/M, even if it means dealing with the occasional rough Nurse game. Killer is also just a very frustrating experience on console. 
---
PTBs are fun to play for for just like a day, then everyone hops back on to Live because bloodpoints. 
---
1 perk champions people
---
Yea a 4man survivor group who knows what they're doing will get AT LEAST 2 people out every game unless they do some major fuck ups. 
---
lol right before the match i decided to prestige her. 
---
they usually take a week or two after the ptb comes out to implement changes into the game before it goes live 
---
Get stunned by pallets for maximum cute oinks
---
Panda's the only streamer I can watch (or at least his YouTube videos, never been a fan of twitch). He's upbeat and positive and while he does get salty it's always with a fair bit of "I'm sorry, but you deserve that hook/death now." 
---
I wish more of the DBD content creators were like him. Goofing off, doing new builds, trying out strange addons and so on. It's just far more entertaining than this disgusting mentality of "let's find a target together (aka killer or survivors) and hate that target together". It's what old grannies in villages do. They get together and smacktalk the new neighbours for being different. That's exactly what these streamers and other creators do. 
---
What you probably would want to do is to pretend to be Kramer. It would probably be hard and take a lot of effort but it could work out.
---
I'm a permanent rank 15.  
---
1 in 7 games don't load or .exe not responding.  
---
1 in 3 games within the first 4 seconds the killer has found me.  
---
Many games I load up, as soon as the dolly-around-character animation starts, maybe 1-2 second later there's a heartbeat and I'm found.  
---
Lots of other games, people just drag the killer straight to me.  
---
Can't learn to run the map and do all the fancy pathway bullshit if 90% of your games are 3-5k bp matches that last 3 minutes. Then spend another 7 minutes waiting for next game.  
---
I love this game, actually. But what in the fuck is going on with survivor play.
---
The change is bad because it's trying to force a particular playstyle that rarely happens naturally. It will not lead to better quality games or better players in red ranks. Most of the top players are consistently depipping with this new system. A change was needed, but this wasn't it. But I agree with the idea of a reward system being in place. Nothing too fancy, but a small BP multiplier or a monthly cosmetic for hitting rank one would be cool.
---
Monto. Has a little commentary and did only killer, but he did it well and showed it decent
---
But then if you are good at the game you lose a perk slot. Why is that ok in your opinion? Yeah I lasted in the chase, my reward is that my perk that is supposed to help me vs tunneling doesn't help me against tunneling.
---
No, stopping the timer would encourage you to keep going and keep looping the killer. Making the timer run out encourages you to  get hit so that the killer might pick you up. It's the exact opposite of what you're saying.
---
Double r/woooosh, you just stepped in MY trap!
---
Yeah I hate when the killer is Saruman 
---
Just take the BP and quit complaining. You still need to do gens to leave anyway 
---
if you really wanna fuck people up 
---
find those doll like drones people use a pranks for witches flying in the air  and tinker with it to make it look like a mid sized nurse and add in the audio effects 
---
I think there has only been a handful of times where Panda seemed to get salty, and it wasn't part of him goofing around. One was a LF face camping him (very short clip where he said the player probably had a micropenis), and his game where he played Freddy for his followers, and was getting absolutely shit on. In the latter, he didn't seem to be getting mad at the survivors, but being genuinely frustrated at how the game was going.
---
1.1 something can be good and also the worst.
---
1.2 *stall means nothing without chase. Other killers can chase better*
---
1. Ruse Cruise Spirit can beat the best survivors if you are Rain Man levels of big brain. I didn't forget hag.
---
2. Yeah but its not guaranteed. At best it is a 60/40 in your favor, most likely to be a 40/60 or a 50/50.
---
8.2 It's pretty damn quick if you know how to use it. The best killers are the best because they have godly chasing and other tools on top of that. Chasing&gt;everything else but having it all means you are stronger. Huntress is worse then Billy because billy has better chasing most of the time. huntress is severely overrated. having Chase will always be better then having stall, as you can stall the game by killing people, but you cannot catch people by stalling.
---
8.3 Yeah, that's why they aren't top tiers.
---
1. Nurse and spirit's counters are in playstyles and mindgames. Hag gets beaten out but crouching, flashlights, certain perks and knowing when the hag is in a chase so you can break traps. Hag is not on the same level as spirit or nurse.
---
Freddy's time limit may be longer, but he loses time in his limited defense, his 7 second fedora man bad, and the fact that he can only chase one person at once.
---
Yeah but when he is flickering he cannot hit you. If survivors can count the mindgame is pretty weak.
---
That is the same with every killer not in the top tiers. And if you spend time trying to get everyone in sleep, you better hope you do, otherwise you are gonna get rushed hard. and then you better hope the survivors are bad, otherwise you are gonna get rushed hard.
---
I dont know. I havent been able to really test im going off what i know. 
---
Maybe relative to what the game once was, but the perfect killer will still lose to 4 perfect survivors.
---
Wooooooow lol
---
Is it survivor meta to just do nothing for minutes on end until someone goes first and get's the killer's attention? Because I'm trying to be a good sportsman and I work on gen's almost immediately, assuming others are doing their job too.  
---
So, most of my games are between 3 and 5 minutes long and I'm dead. I no longer bring items to games until I figure out what the average cunt is doing on survivor.  
---
I'm so hoping they keep the shitty, broken PTB emblems. That way I can simply camp the second to last survivor and never have to deal with the trash fire that is rank 1 again.
---
I wish I got voice messages it would be way funnier 
---
Nurse is due for an add on rework.
---
The devs said, when the trapper got his rework addon, that they want every killer to have the same proportion of addons, so two ultra rares, same amount of purples, etc. Billy and Larry will need changes too. Huntress and doctor need another ultra rare.
---
Probably to further try to prevent killers from camping and/or tunneling survivors. I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs so bad about it,l. You get more points from hooking everyone twice and killing a few than to kill one or two from one hooking them. You‚Äôll also get more points for chases.
---
Yeah it can't be based off of him. He did nothing wrong! 
---
I feel the same way. She's definitely still a good killer with the heals the way they are, but I feel like it's much more fair to have the insta-heal only happen if they were injured from her power.
---
man somebody already posted this meme 
---
Then don‚Äôt perform unsafe hooks, maybe? Why should a killer set your Deliverance up for you?
---
Dont forget chests and unhooking and mending and healing. Oh and space bar! But ur right. Man m1 is a real grind!
---
Optimisation, I assume
---
I don't believe there is any other Freddy. Not in my good household of children. 
---
Oh- no no, sorry I ramble off a lot in posts. I agree with you to extent, sometimes tunnelling that fucker off the hook is the best play because it can be done fast and get the most value. The fun part that was brought up was just me rambling since most of this thread kept bringing up how it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot fun‚Äù 
---
G fuckin G! 
---
Because his fanbase knows what's true and what's BS. :)
---
I love this list but unfortunately I don't find myself as any specific one...:(
---
Have you ever considered that slowing the game down doesnt fucking matter if the primary goal of the killer(getting hooks) isnt being accomplished? What youre suggesting doesnt work at higher ranks. Its already been shown on PTB. 
---
And I suggested the heal because it means theres OPTIONS. You can do a heal and get away with a jet of 0 hooks for the killer, or ignore it. 
---
And let me ask you one last thing. Are you gonna do this for every, single, fucking, down? Nice plan Einstein, "it isnt hard to wait out 60 seconds", yeah ok, do it 11 more times. Cause most games go past the 12 minute mark. Yeah, good plan.
---
I dunno, id say ~~healing~~ massaging your tv is a good cure to jigsaw
---
Oh lmao
---
You really need to play both sides to understand what I am saying. 
---
yes

Ugh imagine supporting this lady when she supports the DC meta.... (only 369 subs away from the next emote goal btw &gt;:) )

How is it bad for red ranks to be more difficult to obtain?

Also, your argument amounts to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll lose a pip! Better intentionally lose a pip.‚Äù That‚Äôs just terrible logic.
---
the way the rank ups get harder at red ranks 1 dc will fuck you up making you lose your pip. its too hard in general but then they also amped up the difficulty more for killers
---
Eh it‚Äôs been in every game it‚Äôs just people trying to justify not having to get better or deal with things they can‚Äôt control.  The one that I remember ALOT and I don‚Äôt know why, is SOCOM2 navy seals, the one side had a very strong and accurate gun( IW-30) and people would flame you for using or just using the M14, since it was on both sides... people are weird and that shit came out on the PS2. So it‚Äôs been a while.

Just ignore them, people are assholes. I've seen them fuck over another survivor just cause they went to hide in locker and Mr dumb dumb ignored the obvious warning.

I agree over all that it should've been made more difficult but this is a little too extreme.

you must be fun at parties, do you judge your friends like that too? or you come to Reddit threads talking about how you analyse them?

Yes he has friends and no we are not talking about viewers and subs.

Yes I am emotionaly invested because he is my friend. your point? just because I have emotions and empathy does that mean I am wrong or clouded?

Or you with no reality of the person and no knowlegde you are correct? Who has the god complex now? I think it is you, who do not know when to stop and think about what youre saying. If you actually knew him, you would know the real person. :)

Nice
---
Found him! [https://imgur.com/4qwruHh](https://imgur.com/4qwruHh) they showed him during the first anniversary stream. I think this is the guy that modeled for Dwight -and next to it the first 3D model they got out of him.
---
I‚Äôll gladly explain, though maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be so quick to call ‚Äúnot liking something‚Äù whining. Unless you just wanted to put your own self entitled opinion into your statement.
---
The system calculates your blood points differently, as you progress in a game is what gives you the blood points to begin with. So, killing three people in a game but say only hooking them each once and that kill themselves on hook actually hurts you as you won‚Äôt get a good emblem score since to get gold and iridescent you need 6-9 and 10+ hooks to get the emblem.
---
Surprise, You get points for your emblems .
---
Watch a few people play the ptb. Let‚Äôs use Monto for instance. Three mori‚Äôs , one escape, 16k blood points, entity displeased. 
---
Compare that to a three mori one escape game not on the ptb, you would have Brutal Killer and be walking away with a smooth 20-25k points, or more with BBQ. 
---
So tell me again how the they are not related to pips since your score is tied to how well you do in game.
---
When u realize it's an infinite t3 with tombstone
---
I usually play survivor but this is honestly me as killer. Anything I know I personally hate as survivor I try to avoid doing. I ran NOED once as a ‚Äúworst map scenario‚Äù backup the first time I ever used an ebony mori and I still haven‚Äôt forgiven myself for that :( 
---
Me too. I have only seen one game with a pts/tts/ptb on console, and it was pubg
---
 Breaking news from CNN: Popular video game streamer known as kittychipz has begun what is known in internet slang as a ‚Äúsubathon‚Äù. Not much is known about the situation currently but we will keep you updated 
---
I'm out of the loop can someone pm me who this supposed ochido with boobs is?
---
If I ever act like an ass playing Killer I am never aware of it or do it intentionally. So Idunno if survivord acting like dicks to me is for no reason or I've done something wrong. I play Myers so I don't believe there's a whole lot I can do wrong besides maybe tunneling but I barely ever do that unless it is perfectly needed.
---
Yes/no. If all 4 survs solely focus on gens then the killer has very little time to even complete the 8 chases you need for a red Mori. 
---
The thing is doing gens for 2 minutes, opening the gate and leaving is stupid boring. It doesn't even give you that many BP. 
---
That's why at ranks 10-15 no one complains about gen rushing because it doesn't exist. Survs will do basically anything except gens because suicidal altruism and being chased is more points &amp; fun. 
---
when plague comes out im just gonna puke on everyone, not even hit them just puking on them ove and over
---
You‚Äôre right which is what I‚Äôm trying to do! I just really don‚Äôt want to be useless to my team however, which is my biggest obstacle in trying to be better with chases. I‚Äôm more useful saving someone or doing gens than forcing aggro on myself.
---
The spirit one oh my god
---
I stopped playing by their "rules" a few days ago, never felt so good.
---
Hello fellow Survivors, Kittyzchipz is doing a subathon and needs your help. Now all you gotta do is sub using your credit card using the numbers on the front, the security code on the back, and the expiration date

I guess nurse mains really N O S E the truth
---
TheEntityLeftHand plays exclusively Trapper.  He role plays, so doesn't give much advice but his gameplay is pretty high level.

But then when I think, "Well cool at least I can farm Doc Shocks or bottle tosses" those fuckers leave immediately.

Why do the faces appear and different times and put of sync with the frame changes? This is really sloppy.

Urban? Seems we've encountered a true immersed Claudette 
---
Where'd you get that template 
---
Then he what? What did he do next?! I need to know!!! 
---
True had plenty of games like that yesterday where he depipped lmao. The devs expect you to play a 15 minute game, where no gens get popped, you three hook everyone, and then you *might* pip. It's ridiculous 
---
Oh wow. They blew up a gen when you hit it. Please post this video 500 more times. I just can't get over how funny of a coincidence this is!!! 
---
No
---
No, would be enough to just not use decisive, but it's getting reworked so everything's fine :^)

You "know" and you agree with me yet you downvote me? Alright.

They went from one extreme to the other. Four gold emblems is no longer a pip at red rank, that's ridiculous. If you play in a good four man team, none of you are going to ever get to do enough to pip.
---
and if you want to step it up, even more, go on an Australian Rust server
---
You must not watch twitch dbd often. The ones that specialize in omega nurse can wipe out a team before hatch is even an option. 
---
Low tier killers pretty much don't stand a chance though. The problem is that even if you end chases quickly, you just don't have the ability to go monitor gens across the map like nurse &amp; billy.
---
Can't wait to see the results.
---
Everything that isn't your pc's fault is probably yours. Yes you sometimes get shithead teammates or have bad luck, but at the end of the day no matter the circumstances, if you are good enough and play enough you will rank up.
---
If you are a permanent rank 15 every season, no matter what you do, then i'm sorry buddy, but that is only your fault.
---
nope, follow deadbydaylight on twitter for when they do come out with a rework
---
This is so disgusting if the killer doesnt have bamboozle
---
Main entrance to window x3, upstairs to 2x pallets, downstairs back to window to main entrance x3
---
No problem! Glad I could help. &lt;3
---
YES YES YES YES 
---
And this is important how?
---
You can't say "I never have issues" and then go on to say that you do. It's contradictory to your original statement which means that you still do have issues and invalidates the bullshit you were saying originally. You see how this works? 
---
Shame, i was hoping they had some sort of official plan.
---
It will probably silence the killer's TR. It would not surprise me at all.
---
Yeah. No game should be played like this.
---
Oh yeah, he can get salty, but only if there's a good reason for it. Facing a camping LF is "salt-worthy" in my eyes, because it's just an unfun character to play against, when he camps.
---
Other than that Panda's been kind of my DBD idol when I started the game. He plays with the right killer mindset that I share. DBD is in essence a horror-themed game of D&amp;D to me and as the killer I get to be the game master and give everyone a nice run-around. I don't tunnel, I don't camp, I overlook mistakes by the survivors sometimes. I enjoy that far more than ranking up. Sometimes I run into a toxic group of survivors, who get a kick out of teabagging and post-game chat abuse, but honestly I don't give a shit. I want blood points and I want to give the players an exciting time and Panda seems to have similar goals, hah. 
---
You are a pioneer, miss. 
---
This is great
---
It is a big change from the old system. 
---
There will be so few people at high ranks if they go with the new system. For both survivor and and killer. 
---
Anyone know when this new killer will be on consoles?
---
Did you guys know you can pay off your student loans just by attending the kittychipz subathon?
---
I usually try the outer edge and I always do a 1% start on every genny I pass so it's hard to "listen" and deduce if progress on gennies has been made - disguising people who want to do a genny and stay near it.  
---
I am pretty new, even if I'm an experienced and honestly fairly talented gamer (30 years of every fucking game since Mario, damn nearly) with reactions, awareness, strategy, teamwork, research all a part of my game. I am in the research stage for DbD but it's so fun even when I'm losing that my research is behind.  
---
Long story short, I probably have thought my cover was good when it wasn't - see it happen to other surv's too. Starting positions are sometimes very near the center of the map and I am guilty of turtling.  
---
Is it worth finding a site with the various maps explained, including their 3 random layouts?
---
haha take that depip squad!  Cant slam 5 gens and dip anymore :D
---
well unless you want to depip, which i dont really care about.  I play to have fun.  Could careless about pips or ranks, give me fun and BPs
---
You're not being punished for quickly killing everyone, you're being rewarded for slowly killing everyone. 
---
Supporting the game, though.. Does that make it okay to intentionally derank and crap on people? 
---
*Laughs in Master race*
---
fun fact, 99% of the people who play this game have no clue what a Fog Whisperer is or that they even exist.
---
Did she say she was deranking to bully people? I don‚Äôt think so 
---
Jendenise
---
Anna should smile more often.
---
Except the post is about secondary objectives that‚Äôs mean a damn. Which I assume means they also have to be completed to escape.
---
What changed?
---
This seems a little hyperbolic. Most games end with just 2-3 ggs and everyone leaves. 
---
Probably because last time they released stats on death rates survivors die about 60% of the time which is already over 50/50 escaping and surviving.
---
Adding more mandatory objectives would make this number fall even more drastically to where it‚Äôs just a murder simulator and no longer a murder/survivor simulator. 
---
* Evil within rises * 
---
I know right? I only ever use pipping as a consolidation when I get shit on. Survivors want to escape and killers want to kill. Counting pips as a victory feels kind of empty.
---
Soon! I'll post them on Monday.

&gt;What I meant by I have no issue whatsoever, is that he sounded like it was especially harder to play solo than before. But no it's not, what you said was still a thing a year ago, and it will always be a thing. 
---
No, there's the original Freddy and there's the remake Freddy, the one in the game is the remake Freddy.

Hah I love this response and it parallels my comment to gamers who struggle in Overwatch ranks, CS GO, etc. I don't have the hours but I'm used to being much better much sooner in most multiplayer games. I admit my research is just beginning and I haven't tried most of the characters. Maybe Rank 13 was just a hot streak :) I also have no idea what improves and drops rank. I can't seem to quit broken or troll games without deranking, apparently the system doesn't know the difference.  
---
Anyone else unable to quit the game in any method (system and forced) without getting a notice by anticheat? It always thinks when I'm done playing that I cheat.  
---
Oh, and I'd still like information about how people are playing the meta in this game. Bait and wait? Sneak a single genny for the whole game? What are people doing? I try to leave other surv's alone so I don't fuck up and end up screwing 2 people over rather than 1 - but it means I have little insight into what they're doing.  
---
Numerous games I see people straight up doing nothing but running for chests the first five minutes.  
---
More insights into standard meta and surv play moves?
---
Does it really matter?  Really?
---
Play some Killer. You'll be surprised at what they can and can't see.

When‚Äôs that

It‚Äôs overhyped. She‚Äôs fun but after a while she feels like a mix of huntress and pig and it gets meh. She‚Äôs fun to play against though

When the devs think theyre done testing. So next thursday maybe. It depends

Nothing worse than a streamer and her fans who actively mock and hate reddit and the forums but still swarm here to try and pump out money for said streamer.

u/Darkwing_Dork is this your alt account 
---
Not fun, as in you can't loop him for days? Because you don't win against legion by looping him, you just find a chance, crouch and stay still with iron will, like find a tall wall, run behind, crouch, slowly walk away while he search for you fire barrels are also a good option, or if he didn't hit you yet, vault and crouch. From second floor is best, or taller vault.
---
I mean is it so hard? Or these "skilled" survivors just don't want to learn, and just play same boring looping game against wraiths and Billies for days?
---
Nice play against the toddler with NOED.  Love balanced on haddonfield.  If you were only running that one perk that's the map you pray to the RNG gods for.
---
If a pip is viewed as a reward than a depip must be viewed as a punishment 
---
Tfw you have nothing better to do than to bitch about how someone else plays the game.

I mean.....you don't have to be rank 1 to be harrassed in post game chat
---
Beautiful, I love it
---
killer mains assume everything x
---
I don't think many people are depipping with 4 kills. 
---
Their behavior is hurting the game. Of course im going to be upset that a Fog Whisperer is telling the community its fine to dc 7+ times a day bragging about it even.
---
DC ruins the game

You really gonna say that ?
---
The funny thing about you quoting yourself is my reply to you was a direct response to that exact part. You said you never have issues. And then later admit that you do. You can't say something never happens and then try to argue that it only sometimes happens. Which means even if only sometimes something happens it's *STILL* an issue because it *STILL* happens. Why is this so hard for you to understand? Say what you mean and mean what you say. Not a hard concept.

The best way to play Legion is not playing them.

no, just one of my various evil twins

Dev: go play something else 
---
Me: oh hey friday is going to be cheaper and comes with all content on the switch \^\_\^ 
---
Devs: Fuck
---
The point they're making is the majority of people that play this game are bad at it. Monto and Puppers juking a lot Nurses doesn't mean 2 blink Nurse is balanced. Just like Scott getting a 32 game win streak with speed limiter Leatherface doesn't make that build strong. It's just the people they're playing against.
---
It seems no matter what addons I bring, even Fuming Mix Tape, causes people to not want to even play so they sit there like lemmings. I love red ranks. 
---
The exorcists comes to console 
---
Yes for survivors. I haven't played killer yet on the new system. 
---
Are you seriously complaining about safe pallets? You're complaining about the only thing that survivors can use to survive? Cmon dude
---
What horror! How dare someone press Leave Match 6 or 7 times in a 10 hour stream!
---
LOL fat chance
---
Lol, this is all so true it's painful.
---
Wow. You really, really do hate memes. I feel so sorry for you. zubSAAAAAD You don't know happiness! Go suck a PP elsewhere! zubSMILE
---
Yeah exactly. Everyone should be like trutalent and play the game without doing shit that makes it miserable for the other side. When I play survivor I never used d strike which was an idea I got from his stream. And as killer I never camp or tunnel someone off hooks. 
---
Also I don‚Äôt do any hatch standoff bullshit. I just hit them or jump in whatever side I‚Äôm on. 
---
In my game a claudette Kept jumping into a locker, but finally after 20 minutes i Got her bodyblocked and murdered the shit put of her. NEVER AGIAN FUCK THIS ACHIEVEMENT
---
Fair enough point. I definitely see and agree with your point. But I still feel like it needs a bit of a nerf.

I can understand people watermarking something they put a lot of time into but...this is pretty low quality. Which is fine, low quality *can* be funny but...just not watermark worthy...

Because she just loves so much.

May be it. I will wait to 13th for rank reset, then try to Play killer

Yep now all we can do is *pretend* BHVR made a good decision for once.

That or they just dc before you even can get a 4K. Thanks for the quitter bonus I guess. And they know they literally get nothing out of it, right?
---
It's okay, we gays in this subreddit will protecc the child.
---
Yeah I guess, anyway I think they should make a killer based on Freddy from A Nightmare on Elm Street, that would be cool.
---
Imma be honest. I dont get it.

You knew the downvotes were coming and yet you still posted. I can only hope to be so bold one day. üëèüèø

Because I'm lazy and don't feel like changing my original statement in this exact same crybaby post made by someone else.

&gt;Didn't you try this on the official forums and they all told you to basically go fuck off and got suspended by the mods for the post? Looks like what's happening here too.

So to tldr your post. Fuck off. No one cares. Quit your whining little baby.

And thats perfectly fine. It was a joke/meme that poped up from being at her stream. Feel free to swing in now and get a brief glimpse at all the wholesomeness that is going on.
---
Game over
---
Yeah I frequently play this game drunk with the lights off to be scared shitless. Just recently I've dialed it back and started thinking strategically instead of embracing the immersion. I prefer immersion mode of maximum panic, terror and confusion, but having gone too far down into the 'fun' part has started costing me games, points and progress.  
---
Just recently I started doing the "wait, spot and trail" thing you described. A very solid strategy. Hopefully optimizing killers will rotate without too many clockwise/counterclock reversals! Thanks!

2 people creating the exact same post is not a lot. Keep crying though. I love seeing the tears from grown ass adult bitch babies. 
---
In fact, I'm gonna go derank my rank 1 p3 level 50 killer that has every perk in the game and go smurf on people just for you. The tears are delicious. Yum yum.
---
I'm actually not for that specific reason but I am going to go derank. Ranking up is a punishment as it is with the fucked up match making system. A content creator needs to be able to make content. These obnoxious queue times prevents that. No one wants to sit and watch someone in queue next to the campfire for an hour. 
---
Take your bullshit and crybaby ass the fuck on somewhere else where people care. No one on the official forums cares and no one here does. 
---
Deranking has always been a thing in this game and it will always be a thing in this game. Crying about it and trying to take some virtual moral high ground with your weak ass virtue signaling isn't going to change how people play the game.

---
I'm thinking Lisa would probably like vegans considerably since they would not have eaten her.
---
Not really. I have seen Noob3 go down in a minute against nurses. A good nurse will own any good survivor.
---
I don't get it, didn't the devs say a certain amount of DC's is allowed?
---
Thank you for proving my point.
---
The new rank up system is completely broken. I hope they will fix it. 
---
I can't tell if you're memeing or not.
---
Pallet spawns were just buffed.
---
Vacuum pallets and near-infinites were a problem and needed to be fixed.
---
NOED and Ruin T3 were unchanged. T1 and T2 changes are only significant for new players. T1 and T2 NOED were completely worthless and needed to be changed. T1 and T2 Ruin are arguably worse, because now you've alerted all 4 survivors to the fact that you have a totem.
---
Exhaustion was nerfed because the increasingly common use of exhaustion perks was making every chase last significantly longer.
---
A well equipped and well organized team of survivors can beat any killer.
---
The game is starting to approach balance, but it's still survivor-sided.
---
DS was unnecessarily nerfed into the ground though.
---
Is not that whoever is looking in the mirror?
---
I‚Äôm sorry but hag seems like she‚Äôs totally be a vegan 
---
I complain about dumb shit, like " Survivors Spawning on ruin" Rightttttt. Yeah I guess a survivor spawning on ruin is a dumb thing to want fixed, by b man
---
Thanks!

More Like adreneline WHO the fuck needs self Care Wien gens Are done in 3 minutes, and get a free instaheal
---
This happens every day i posted more evidence in comments. You can check beginning/end of streams to see where intentional deranking/dcing happens daily. I posted one example in another comment here.
---
Don't use the ability I guess.
---
I thought it was useless as fuck when I first started with Legion so I have been left clicking survivors for about a week lol
---
ah yeah that reminds me, adrenaline and dead hard, another two that every survivor uses
---
How do you get to that conclusion?

Victory cube made the most sense. Hands down best system.
---
Outstanding move...
---
But that Pig tho
---
Look at her tits.
---
Has he, or do you know, of any meme builds for Legion? 
---
Doesn't sound like it. Link his steam profile because it sounds like he's a survivor main and doesn't like the changes.
---
Meme builds? 
---
It really isn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know why people still use it
---
Oh man I wish. But we're lucky they push the actual chapter through to Sony most times. Chances of them managing to 
---
Well that escalated quickly.
---
Well I know that micrososft would, idk about sont but microsoft has an ¬´¬†insider¬†¬ª fonction where you can sign up for game beta and even system betas. They did test servers for PUBG, sea of thieves and a couple more, so It depends on the devs. 
---
I also have a ps4 but idk if there‚Äôs an equivalent 
---
Feels good to have both.
---
You said blood points, not emblem points.
---
Do you have to buy the characters individually if you buy them with shards? First one I plan on buying with shards and I don't really remember if you can buy both at once (or if there's any benefit to that way) or just both with shards 
---
Killer is easy on console 
---
1. It was the first day she was on PTB and I had no idea how the mechanics worked.
---
2. The post title is a joke.
---
Claudette is smaller though.

---
Everytime you kill a survivor, gens get slowed down by ~25%(?). Dont need thana to influence it more
---
I personally find Quentin and Bill players to be bad at the game.
---
Chapel building isn't nearly as bad, it doesn't even have pallets.
---
Survivors have like a code you have to stick to or else they call you every name in the book. They want you to let them unhook everyone and not use any real tactics to win. Like my only objective is to murder you fools. Why would I pick this dude up when I know you're right next to me and going to save the other on the hook?? That's not slugging, that's called not being a dipshit and letting you get a free unhook. OR you're right behind me with a flashlight, why tf would I pick him up when I can slap you away first? I play as both survivor and killer and idk what some of these survivors are on, they expect killers to play like shit and then get pissed if they mess up. Survivors have so many options to mess with the killer and play effectively it's ridiculous how much they complain that you didn't play killer according to their rules when they probably have never played it themselves.
---
Yeah she‚Äôs really hard for me to ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù? She‚Äôs good at punishing Pallet/Window loopers, just puke on them until they‚Äôre One Hit, or just wait for your Corrupt Purge.
---
She‚Äôs fun but I don‚Äôt think anyone will beat Spirit/Pig/Leatherface for me.
---
Calm lad. Issa meme no need to react like that
---
People have been deranking because of two main reasons: long queue times in red ranks and lack of interesting gameplay vs the same killers/same players. By pushing people out of red ranks, more people get pooled into Purples and players who simply close games out get little to no rank progression anyway. 
---
Eventually people who only play to end a game fast will get not only little to no ranking but more than likely stagnate after a reset. 
---
Then what exactly changed?
---
Im not the best photo editer. Its not the best but when dead by daylight is life, The Hag is the first thing i thought when i seen the original picture. I know its stupid, but its funny.
---
Yep...

He is very good at slowing the game down especially with the add-ons that reduce skillcheck chances.

---
Thing is I do watch him. But I dont feel like I learn the basics of chasing when the survivors know how to play. Like when do I commit? How do I defend hooks and gens properly? It seems survivors always sneak behind me and get the gen before I manage to down a guy.

---
Holy crap, this just changed my life lol 
---
I think seeing survivor auras in dreamworld should be removed(aside from perks obviously). It eliminates stealth entirely even more so than the "anti-stealth" killer who at least has counterplay when it comes to stealth and I even play Freddy the second most out of all killers.
---
It's not like the survivors in this game can... I don't know ! &gt;!Crouch and getting up again repeatetly making what we commonly call a teabag...!&lt;
---
Have You Read A Comic Called Homestuck?
---
I really hope that's the case because while I agree it needs to be changed (because it's too easy), this seems a bit punishing. Like if you get a 4k really fast because the survivors are idiots, why punish the killer?
---
Come the fuck on, man
---
r/consoleplayersdeserverights
---
Would that give me anything? I seem to remember you got like an outfit or something for a character if you used cash as opposed to shards IIRC
---
[Laughs in EW3]
---
She's not going to be anywhere near as strong as William of the Hills or Spirit. She seems like a mid-tier killer. I do appreciate that she actually has counterplay, unlike Legion. 
---
No wonder I enjoy playing Huntress, Freddy, and Wraith so much!
---
but they did
---
Fairly sure this post proves that. 
---
Gross. 
---
Fun builds
---
Wait till it‚Äôs that build with the new perk that transfers your terror radius to survivors...shits gonna get real in the coming weeks lol.
---
Lol, pretending like Microsoft gives a shit about consumers. They're all about the money. 
---
I‚Äôm not mad at all but you obviously are because you decided to make a post about how someone enjoying a game pisses you off. Why don‚Äôt you grow up, worry about your self instead of and enjoy the game instead of being a crybaby bitch on reddit. Also, if you don‚Äôt like her why keep up with what she does, just unfollow/block her if it upsets you.
---
Why tho? Survivors are just skins...

Bueno.

Completely agree, Survivors need a complete increase to Bloodpoint gain from all categories. I can make the same amount of Bloodpoints by playing one killer game with BBQ compared to playing 3 games of survivor. It's really bad.

If they're genuinely optional, sure. OP was talking about RBTs which aren't optional.
---
I've been watching a lot of Tru3's stream recently. It's pretty great. He plays with a very fun code (no dstrike, no NOED, no mori, no ruin on nurse and billy, no max range nurse, and no face camping or tunneling unless the survivors force a farm map) and he's very engaging and educational.
---
I also like that he almost plays as much survivor as killer. It lets me see the game from the perspective of a rank 1 survivor, and it also makes it so that when he makes comments about the game's balance then he's doing that as somebody who has played both sides of the field on rank 1. He's not just going to go "as a survivor main I think that billy should be 110% speed because I'm an expert on that", he actually knows how to play both with him and against him and makes educated calls based on both sets of information.
---
Well this blew up
---
There are some viable builds. While a lot of critiques on builds are opinions based on perks in that build, there are objectively bad builds that provide almost no benefit to the user. Viability and enjoyment of a build are two different things. If my build consist of perks that have been identified as objectively low tier by almost everyone, chances are my build is not viable unless I'm going against terrible survivors, but going against terrible survivors is not a good way to tell how effective a build is.
---
If they keep it how it is, it's just going to result in absolutely everyone staying at rank 13-15.
---
Well those are the basics. Try to improve your "sixth senses" amd detect them with ears too, not only eyes.
---
Trapper is an excellent killer for beginners. You trap loops, gens, etc
---
If you like using Michael, I think your best build would be anti-looping. Brutal Strength, Bamboozle, Enduring, and Spirit Fury.
---
If you don‚Äôt have all of those, use Monitor &amp; Abuse to make yourself more sneaky. It decreases your terror radius by 8 meters, and will allow you to catch them out of position.
---
Sloppy Butcher is great on every killer, as they will waste a ton of time healing. Even just injuring them will help.
---
Save your Tier 3 for healthy survivors. Don‚Äôt commit to every chase, and never forget to guard your generators. Especially the 3 that are close together.
---
Monto and Tru3 are the best streamers to watch for killer gameplay.
---
Agree to disagree 
---
Dwight wiggled off of the killer at the edge of the map, thus he moved past the "finish line", so the escape didn't trigger.
---
I don't think that would do much to slow the game down for the people who need slowing, really. It would slow down newbies and solo players, but they're already slow usually. Organised teams would just tell each other where the boxes are.
---
Honestly you should care what they say, just play how you want and ignore them 
---
The Feng Min one is from Montos funny moments #3
---
I think the issue is the low cap on stuff such as Chase and Repair.
---
From a pure BP standpoint (Which I understand people focusing on) you shouldn't do more gens or get into chases when you've capped it. This leads to bad matches in my opinion.
---
increase cap, cap is stupid on generator in particular.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs great. I feel guilty for not subbing. I agree, his opinions are great because of that balance of playing both. Usually he does 1 game survivor next game killer and so on. 
---
Unfortunately he says he doesn‚Äôt like to talk balance that often so you don‚Äôt hear so much but when you do it‚Äôs a lot better than say Tyde time who‚Äôs 99% one sided. 
---
I just thought it was funny cus I usually only play killer for my dailies so I got to experience the post match bitching 
---
It's also useless if anyone can reach any Rank because everyone can pip; BHVR needs to find a happy middle ground between these two extremes.
---
Well, at least Rank means nothing (except that Purple and Red Ranks are usually sweat-fests) for now. 
---
If they had introduced this new Emblem system with a Rank Rewards system I would have been more than a little upset, not gonna lie.
---
Listen, I will play Super Sayian God Pallet Kicking Ultra Instinct Wraith and kick everything in less than .4 seconds.

Today's meme is a little special. Not necessarily a popular format, but I really loved the OP's use of Drake &amp; Josh. [Here is the inspiring post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/8u4x9m/when_you_see_the_postgame_chat)
---
This new killer is gross lol
---
I mean, no hate but that's exactly what she does. She DC's to make sure she doesn't pip so she can stay at low rank, which (whether or not it's against the rules or not idk) is at least kinda scummy :/. She could do just fine without de-pipping but whatever makes her and her viewers happy. \*shrug\*
---
This looks like the lowest resolution possible. Look at all those jagged textures
---
Top 10 Anime Fights.
---
I'm not sure this was outplaying. It was basically just a hatch standoff he gave up on.
---
I was think more of a shadow mode. We're 2 matches are happening at the same time and the killer can see the other but more as a ghost and the survivors can see the other survivors in the same way. And it will be a competition of who can do better.
---
I like that Nea looked at the knife after stabbing, just like Myers would do :P
---
I‚Äôm not at all complaining about them, I‚Äôm saying that a smart survivor that uses them can waste a ton of the killers time. I think that the game is in a better state but survivors are still stronger imo.
---
Not exactly sure which of your categories I fall into but I laughed the whole time I was reading them. 
---
No I mean boomer. Boomers used to only have male models then in left 4 dead 2 they got female as well but spitter was also added to the game. 
---
Yes but besides pallet vaccum and shitty killers being buffed everything was pretty unneccesary especially the NOED buff. Tho I like what they did to ruin because at least Ruin doesn't reward you for losing
---
Right, so let me get right to the point on this issue. The developers have already determined that a certain number of DC's is allowed. You don't get to sit and watch anyone's stream with a pen and notebook and tally every DC and report to the devs. It's not TydeTyme's responsibility to do it. It's not your responsibility to do it.
---
The devs wrote up the EULA for us to agree to. We don't get to read the EULA and make our own determination of the dev's rules on their behalf. Not you. Not TydeTyme. No one here gets to make the rules but the devs. They clarified this rule, over and over.
---
What we have from TydeTyme and his followers is a complete and total disrespect for the devs and a complete and total disregard on an issue that the devs have already clarified. Repeatedly. Stop disrespecting the devs by believing that their ruling on the matter is wrong and/or flawed and you need to correct them. Stop disregarding the devs by believing you know there's a magic total number of DC's needed to get banned and showing the "proof" and getting huffy and puffy because the devs disagree. The devs get to disagree with you and they get to disregard your magic number because they make the rules, not you.
---
If DC'ing was AT ALL a real issue to the devs, they MOST CERTAINLY would've done something about it by now. The fact that you take issue with it doesn't make it an issue. The fact that TydeTyme takes issue with it doesn't make it an issue. You two are not special. You two are not the rule makers. You two are not the deciding factor. You two are not the developers. You two did not make the game. 
---
I know for a fact that Behavior is really focused on toxicity in their community. Making posts about other players about their play style and promoting negativity towards other players is pretty toxic. Targeting certain players specifically in a public forum about their game play is pretty toxic. This post all around is pretty toxic.
---
There's a reason why Jen was chosen as a Fog Whisperer, why she's sponsored to play the game and promoted to Fog Whisperer by the devs. There's a reason why TydeTyme was NOT chosen to be a Fog Whisperer. Stop disrespecting their opinion on this. Stop. disrespecting. the. devs.
---
tl;dr: Shut up, please. For the love of God, all of you just shut up on this non-issue.
---
As a former Nurse main, I'd say that's mostly true. What ends up happening is I'll string Survivors into thinking I'm a "Baby Nurse".. Then when I feel like they're comfortable enough, in comes a freight train.

I had a game last night where one claudette kept trying to bodyblock me and would run away to selfcare after every hit. At the end, I hooked her teammate and managed to chase her down. She flammed her teammate for not giving her hatch by killing himself and then turned on me for being such a noob killer and camping. I let them know I was on discord and heard the last Gen finish on a friend's game and thought it was mine. I stood on a hook for like 20 seconds before I realized the gens were still up, but apparently nobody was on them cause at least 2 of the survivors came for their friend. The claud suggested I play KYF to learn how to play even though I 4K'd them. Got the standard "L2P noob :)" act at the same time they berated their teammate
---
She's a cutie and a major sweetheart. Love watching her stream. 
---
Stridor, I know I don't need one but getting one will help when I am recording. 
---
How did your teammates abandon you? Did they get hatch without you? Great play non the less, I bet he was pretty salty about that one. 
---
I'm learning spirit and run brown add ons only. Once tried green ones, 4k'ed in like 3 minutes said "wow this is too powerful and unfun for survivors" went back to using brown ones only. Too scared to even try no sound spirit.

---
Killer never saw it coming.
---
Which con are you going to? Hope you'll finish it in time ^^
---
I'm not the one you were talking to. I don't watch your stream. However I can summarize virtually all of the comments about you I have read on DBD here.
---
ALLEGEDLY: 
---
You make constant mistakes as and deflect blame on to the game and say there's nothing you could have done because survivors OP/SWF. 
---
Basic killer plays are propped up as super amazing 400IQ plays.
---
Average survivors are seen as pro/good/sweat SWF and the reason why you lost when you made many mistakes.
---
I read a comment alleging that they were banned for saying you lost because of XYZ mistakes and not because of survivors being too strong. Apparently they were called a toxic survivor main and banned.
---
A lot of opinions basically summed up that you are actually an average killer with a  big ego who thinks he is way better than he is never admitting your own mistakes were the reason you lose a game.
---
---------------------------------------------------------------------
---
I have no idea myself. Again, I haven't watch your stream much. But I frequent the DBD reddit. 
---
Also IDK if you know much about reddit, but you can block users. You have to report them (for anything even rudeness), then it gives you the option to block. I would block Mr. Armchair psychologist. I did.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You know Pug DCs a hell of a lot more than jen, right? And does so at the beginning or during the match? That‚Äôs an awful example to use as a comparison! Noob3 is also pretty well known for playing at mid ranks a lot. Tydetyme sucks and is a boring as fuck streamer (check his views on stream compared to others), and I don‚Äôt even think Monto streams? Puppers I‚Äôll give you, but then again I do not know the difference in queues between playing solo as Puppers does, and typically with one or more like Jen does majority of the time. 
---
definitely haha
---
Myers should've thanked her.
---
Where's the BP farmer or generous killer? When I play I usually aim for that sweet 29,600 bloodpoints as killer (2 hooks each, Max out everything else) and I don't see that anywhere on the list. 
---
Play Claudette that way you can heal yourself, it‚Äôll help a ton. Don‚Äôt get overly focused on gens, remember totems are just as important. If your teammates usually die first keep in mind hatch escapes are very possible as long as you‚Äôve gotten a couple generators done
---
Do the tutorials for 50k bp , play both sides and uhhh watch some youtubers or vods, ussylis had some nice guides
---
Two people already have a better meme than what I did, lol. 
---
I like it
---
I recorded some funny videos but from survivor perspective. 
---
Not against a 4 swf squadette.
---
Yikes, I mean I can‚Äôt argue with your personal scale... but does mid rank not exist to you? Everything from 20- 5 is just in the same class?
---
Well grats on joining this interesting community. Killers are meant to be stronger than an individual survivor so that is why there are four of them. Biggest suggestion is to keep practicing, you will die a lot. Move your mouse around when you are doing gens to watch for the killer, learn how to look behind you when running (I'm practicing this) and, above all, ignore the comments after in the chat. Glhf
---
That is dirty. Lol
---
I completely see where you are coming from. Everything you did was justifiable and I would have done the same. 
---
When someone messages you like this, they are throwing you some rope, hoping you'll pull (ie, justify yourself or get into a fight). My suggestion, just own it and shut them down. When they message: "Tunneling teabagging scumbag". you could simply respond, "At  your service", then block and move on.
---
It shuts them down and doesn't ruin your day from it. Just some advice that you didn't ask for.  :)
---
And hey, GG 
---
:D
---
Advice from an immersed Claudette...gens are the primary objective and need to be completed asap.  You want to take out totems to try and counter NOED too but you need to bang out those gens most importantly.  Let's teach them to be a useful teamate and not simply one that crawls around the map waiting for 2 gens to get done so they can camp a hatch.
---
I don't.
---
To everyone questioning this, this is only a part of the console optimization. There will be more, so you may notice a slight difference.. but there will be more :)
---
Simple math see?
---
A lot of the windows have mindgames (the killer can drop down) and are usually unsafe. Pallets are bad. Asylum has godpallets plus a window with no mindgame
---
2+8=28 lmao. Have to wait till then
---
üòÇ Dude I haven't even been on here a year and only have 171 karma. Are you expecting me to do this right. 
---
Because it‚Äôs boring as fuck and 90% of the time the legion player is a massive cunt playing legion because they know people hate them 
---
Just set messages to friends only cuts all the crap put.
---
If I find you in game I‚Äôm playing legion with a mori, noed, and franks mixtape
---
üòÇ
---
Forgive my lack of knowledge, I'm still pretty new to all this, but why would you even need something like NOED with a one-hit-down killer?
---
No idea. 
---
Its a free 50000 bp for both :p
---
Don't get me wrong I got pretty far as survivor ( got both me and Claudette to prestige at least once if I remember correctly)  but the problem is you can do every generator, heal and unhook all of your teammates twice and open both exit gates and escape but you will only get like a quarter of bloodpoints that the killer gets and it just ain't worth it 
---
Pig is better than both imo. But I suggest you join clown gang and get Santa. It‚Äôs very self fulfilling 
---
Don't forget the round room window loop and downstairs pallets.
---
I'm so glad i decided to main Nurse.

What rank is your friend? If you are playing with him and he is at a higher rank you are getting matched with good killers and its going to be rough. 
---
After being in rank 1 PTB every PTB, I welcome the depip so I can get games a bit faster. 
---
You have to hit them to do that, though so they're either down or dead.
---
Freddy thought he was special getting to be invisible in dream world. Meanwhile, Dwight entering the world of invisibility through the power of advanced locker ingenuity 
---
I like those entirely just to bait survivors. They'll see the secret offering and assume I'm running a green or red mori, but nope something that is mostly worthless.
---
As a survivor I like playing with pig more because of the potential jump scares plus on the rare occasion a RBT goes off it‚Äôs pretty funny. Clown is fun too but it‚Äôs also really weird how he‚Äôs so big and moves so fast. I absolutely dread playing doctors b/c if you accidentally 3 gen yourself you basically are f*cked. If that‚Äôs not enough the pig makes the cute oink during stun and honestly if that‚Äôs not worth maining her than what is?
---
lvl 1 and 2 of NOED was pointless af and it only really impact young players in lower ranks. what did they do to ruin ? that it affects all players at lvl 1 and 2 and only decreases the lost of progress ?
---
You can play every killer efficiently, but Freddy is the weakest and is the most easy to abuse. Freddy is not in a good spot, hence why we are seeing a rework soon  
---
&gt;I see a lot of people wanting to buff him, but they just don‚Äôt know how to play him
---
This is ridiculous. Being unable to interact with survivors for the majority of the game is extremely frustrating, and even when you get in a chase you‚Äôre still a M1 killer so you can easily be looped. 
---
Camping, naturally, is bad, but sometimes you have to secure a kill when all the gens are done. Freddy can‚Äôt camp, like, at *all*. Once they‚Äôre hooked, you have to sleep the survivor again which can take anywhere from 3-9 seconds depending on your addons. 
---
Freddy isn‚Äôt in a good spot at all. You can argue all day ‚Äúoh you just don‚Äôt know how to play him‚Äù but it‚Äôs the truth. I don‚Äôt care how many hours you have, I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôve been rank 1 every season since this game launched, you cannot deny he‚Äôs the worst killer, not as bad as people say, but he is the worst killer of them all. 
---
Ask experienced Huntress players like ScottJund, ZubatLeL or Umbra_Bug and they'll tell you that even without extra hatchets iri head is badly designed. 
---
Scott proposed a change to Iri head that'd make it so it only instadowns when you hit it from a certain distance, ~20 meters for example. That way huntress can't just get in semi-melee and have a better instasaw.
---
I‚Äôm struggling with this so much! Literally just had a game where I unhooked/healed 3 teammates, did like 2 gens and cleansed 2 Totems plus opened a chest, exit gate and the escape points. I think it was around 21k BP. Grinding BP with Survivor is so hard.
---
‚ÄúMore for me‚Äù
---
Seeing as it has been this long, I don't think it's happening. I'd say the only chance of getting licensed cosmetics is if they end up doing more licensed characters.
---
I got this game quite a while ago and have a question, what is Hard Camping? Is it just another word for face camping?
---
As a survivor main, I find that the clown is a very good, and very fair killer to go up against.  Plus he‚Äôs also fun to be chased by because of his toxic gas. Another reason; he has good cosmetics! His mori is also more fun to watch than the others.
---
Even if they DCd you'd get max points
---
Lol I know. Have a plan for tonight then. 
---
I played against a deranker as a Level 20 killer with 1 perk slot at Level 1. It's not a recommendable experience, derankers are bullies who are afraid to play at their own level.
---
Not going to disagree. To me Killer is more fun. 
---
Oh yeah, no I didn't meant she's being toxic in the way Ochido is, just that they both have influence and denying it would be stupid. And I completly agree, devs should just clearly state if it's okay or not and everyone would move on.
---
Not a direct insult to OP but the definition of "fair" can be different person to person. Some people think "if its in the game, i can use it". But as a rank 1 survivor that see's a lot of stuff, either their definition of fair is very questionable, or they don't care and are the hyper competitive "do whatever it takes to win, even if it ruins everyone's game" type.
---
Now I see what the icon is, I always thought it was a knife or something. 
---
Dude, if DC'ing COMPLETELY destroys every single game you play, then yeah it's definitely an issue. Every single game. Like, I played for 4 hours yesterday. One person DC'd in all those games. Oh well, I'll get over it. Other days I'll play for a stretch of time (8 to 9 hours) and maybe 3 or 4 players DC. On any day where you play a long stretch of games, and in every single one of those games 1 or 2 players DC? Yeah, that's an issue. How often does that actually happen to you?
---
I just don't understand why they keep making Gatekeeper so important. It's by far the worst emblem since it depends on how the survivors do and how long your totem last in most cases.
---
Okay thank you. I dunno who downvoted your response but take my upvote 
---
I just wanted to say thank you for making this post. It says everything I have to say and think about this whole stupid situation.
---
The devs make the rules, Jen DCs at the end of the match when she's about to die on last hook or she's at the exit gates. She clearly isn't anywhere near the % of DCs and people counting up every time she does it are doing precisely nothing productive. It's just such a shitshow.
---
Oink! 
---
It‚Äôs the new decisive as well
---
f
---
Gotta spread the word, can't trust the devs to handle this. Such disrespect to the devs. It's gross.
---
Because it's some kind of seal of approval from BHVR (and it gives them even more influence), and DCing that much isn't supposed to be okay, so there's a clear conflict.
---
&gt; No seasonal rewards or anything.
---
That's one way to make higher ranks even more toxic.
---
&gt; The game is much more fun at lower ranks.
---
Yeah it is fun to stomp the low ranks rather than face someone of equal skill and lose.
---
Agreed, freddy just needs some minor tweaks
---
My only point was that, the best way to show you disagree with someone is to give them less attention, not more. Much like when a toddler throws a fit, and you ignore it. Eventually, they learn that throwing a fit doesn‚Äôt work. 
---
Although, Jens community is rather large, so I have to say, you‚Äôre right. Discussion on it might be the best thing, simply because, like ochido, her fans are very loyal.
---
No more toxic derankers when everyone in the game is rank 15! 400IQ
---
I live for embarrassment thank you 
---
Im not saying crouch all the time, and run urban evasion, im saying crouching while killer is chasing you, especially after vaults where he doesn't  see you land, you don't do nothing, just crouch and stay still. Legion just gets confused. Seriously.
---
I think it should be based on kills and hooks, like it used to be. I don't care that "nice" killers will stop giving you the hatch....they're here for one purpose, sending that sweet survivor ass up to the Entity for a pounding. Basing it on generator completion, or reward/punishment determined by speed of repairs will penalize killers and loadouts that take time to setup, or work best in the end game. You shouldn't be handicapped by taking Remember me + BloodWarden, perks that depend on the same condition that they're no penalizing players for allowing. 
---
The doctor doesn't like vegans? Until this day I was convinced that he enjoys his occasional slab of tofu
---
Hmmmm.. Seemed pretty clear to me. Oh well it‚Äôs cool lol my apologies. 
---
Of man examples:
---
there‚Äôs The exhaustion perks. Multiple matches you get really upset and even complain that a survivor is running balance landing. It‚Äôs always a problem when they use the perk properly but when it works out on your favor.. it‚Äôs not an issue. 
---
Mind gaming yourself. I learned mind games because of you and it‚Äôs a strong tactic... but when a survivor doesn‚Äôt fall for it. It‚Äôs either they are optimal survivors or the map doesn‚Äôt allow you to mind game, But you mind game your self. a lot. 
---
Pallet placements 
---
Even after they removed a lot of strong pallets. There‚Äôs a lot of complaining. So many strong pallets were removed but it‚Äôs not good enough. 
---
Missing hits... I love the memes but I mean you always make up an excuse. 
---
Flashlight saves even tho you‚Äôre next to a wall and easily can be avoidable. 
---
There was a wraith match that you had recently and you got called out for using ‚Äú Toxic ‚Äù perks/add ons even though you complain about survivors using toxic perks. It seem like You immediately took offense to it and started to say ‚Äú I can never do enough. Playing killer in rotation‚Äù etc.. it came off as guilt tripping. ( In my own opinion. ) 
---
But again,
---
I agree with:
---
Survivor spawning next to ruin. 
---
That shit is a game breaker. You can‚Äôt counter it and it‚Äôs a waste of a perk space. 
---
Decisive Strike
---
I hate that perk so much. Luckily, I run enduring so it‚Äôs not TOO bad. 
---
Gen Rush
---
It‚Äôs a problem when a SWF group do it properly. (I‚Äôve done it with my team with no perks or items) it‚Äôs super toxic and you have no control over it. 
---
I‚Äôd love to hear what you think about the list. It‚Äôs actually pretty fun having this discussion. Thanks for your time. 
---
Also a lot of survivors don‚Äôt respect him so they‚Äôll do some dumb shit they let‚Äôs the freddy do better than he should some matches
---
Yeah, "incredibly safe building you can get to from anywhere" seems like bad map design to me. Prenn, Ormond, Abittoir, and Torment Creek are all terrible for a reason.
---
I thought kate had something to do with the clown?
---
This is definitely the saltiest rank. Very try-hard and anti-fun styles of play to be seen through those ranks. Hell, once I'm in red ranks I only use random perks. I pull up the roulette and just have a go. Rank doesn't natter, so when I feel I've hit the (mostly) appropriate skill range I want to play against, I stop caring completely.
---
Yes considering bp is shared between the two
---
I love this 
---
Personally, I think the trapper is worse, but that's just my opinion. 
---
&gt; why did you character glitch so much up and down while on the roof and in the hatch? Framerate issues?
---
Leatherface's chainsaw is really weak and you can barely use it when youre behind a survivor. NOED makes it easier and you faster
---
Okay well you can act like you‚Äôre not talking about who you‚Äôre talking about even though it‚Äôs completely obvious with the ‚ÄúOchido with Boobs‚Äù comment. Also, if you weren‚Äôt complaining about stupid stuff like a little bitch then I  wouldn‚Äôt have  called  you that,  You still seem mad, and I have nothing more to say to you but stay pressed,
---
That‚Äôs on the survivors, not Freddy. If they fought Freddy seriously he would constantly be getting 0 kills and ‚Äúentity displeased‚Äù
---
I guess I‚Äôll try that then^^
---
Especially with Balanced Landing on Haddonfield.
---
It is ok, they allow certain % of DCs. If you don't get to that % then you're fine. She clearly hasn't reached that limit as nothing has happened so there is no reason to think there is a problem.
---
That seems fair to me.
---
Is Scott the guy who mentioned legion rework and survivor secondary objective?
---
Good luck with finding something, keep us updated. I'm curious haha
---
Running devour in ptb? They more than just deserved it
---
LF's chainsaw is terrible. He moves at like 85ish movespeed while charging it.
---
That's why purple Ranks are more fun. Teammates aren't total shit and less people are toxic than in red ranks.
---
That being said I'll never understand any of the Toxicity in this shit. It's a fucking game, if you're so mad maybe you should get out and exercise before your heart starts to explode from the pressure, damn.
---
Not at anyone specifically btw
---
Um I was agreeing 
---
at least we have legacy
---
I know, I just felt like explaining lol. 
---
&gt;My idea was to add a bunch of safes that have a high chance of containing a valuable item and gives bp to whoever opens it.
---
That would fix jack shit. If they want BP they'll just use Killer with BBQ and wreath offering. An SWF squad, which is the other major problem with this game's balance, would ignore those safes and we'd be right at square. 
---
The whole point of secondary objectives is that they HAVE to be MANDATORY. I.E. (to break this down for the slow people who may be reading) you have to do this before you are allowed to leave. 
---
You‚Äôre all riled up lol
---
isn't it just general optimization 
---
Seriously, this isn't even about the streamers to me. Use them as examples if you must. So many people play this game, play it a lot. I play this game a lot, everyone in this sub must if they're here. If DC'ing kills every single game they play in a day, then yeah it's an issue. Sooo many people shit all over these devs like they know better. Like they can do it better. People need to shut up.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve watched him a couple times, I love the roleplay, it‚Äôs really unique! I was wondering there‚Äôs been a few times I saw where he‚Äôd punish (‚Äúshame!‚Äù) someone on the hook, is this only for sabo or are there other violations?
---
Yeah I just love talking about Freddy and I get frustrated when people try to excuse him with ‚ÄúYou just don‚Äôt know how to play him‚Äù
---
I'm sure you won't regret this later.
---
The difference is that a toddler throwing a fit doesn't affect anyone, Jen DCing does affect players, otherwise no one would care. She said it herself, no one reacted until a couple of months ago, she has been doing it for months, probably years (?). So she won't stop and BHVR won't punish this attitude if no one reacts to it, and it's not like it actually hurts her or anything, that's not the point. 
---
I really want to see that now üòÇ
---
Is actually Sprite Cranberry, the killer is actually Lebron James
---
They are bad. The only way to make them strong is to play like a scumbag and exploit the chase or use Frank's Mix tape (and still be a scumbag)
---
My steam name is "mori me daddy" ill welcome it with open arms üòÇ
---
I always thought Survivors should get more bonuses from working together.
---
Like addition Survival points based on how many other Survivors escape.
---
Don't know about me.  I play with no goals in mind other than to experience the atmosphere, I'm not even concerned with "winning" or "losing."  Loved slasher movies growing up.  Imagine a buncha tourists standing in line, looking at some mutually pleasing tourist attraction.  One turns to another, makes eye contact‚Äîthere's a moment of connection there:  two people enjoying the same thing at the same time.
---
Then one of 'em hits the other one with a bigass piece of rusty sharpened metal and drags 'em over to a meathook.
---
I mainly go there to use balanced landing
---
Message him back and just say your mom no one can come back from that

Brutal Strength, Fire Up, Pop Goes The Weasal, And any 4th perk. Run double Shadow Dance addons and ‚Äúrespect‚Äù every pallet by cloaking just before dropping and just fucking nuke it off the map.

Yea the man‚Äôs been out for years I think the ppl who want to play him know how to play him
---
As survivor, when you get to a gen look around and figure out where your going to run to when the killer shows up. Always try to  have an idea where the nearest pallet is. That's going to be the main way you break a chase at the lower ranks. 
---
Sadly not :(
---
\*No One Escapes the Hangover

Thanks but is not this one! 
---
Ryu was just half and half! 
---
Oh that I am! I'm a big fan of the series so that's a nice find! 
---
Yup, exactly what i meant by runner
---
Not a actual pun, MEGA UPVOTE!
---
what
---
I have no problem with any exhaustion perk, your'e confusing a perk to choosing a map with everyone using a perk which creates a very powerful almost unbeatable strategy, which I talked about yesterday before then I cant even remember the last time I "complained" about it.
---
If the survivor doesn't fall for good mind games most likely they are good survivors but I don't complain about this, its an observation.
---
I never make up an excuse for missing hits. I question was it dead hard? and 9/10 it was. Thus why the meme was born. Even though 9/10 times it is dead hard.
---
I don't complain about flashlight saves, are they annoying, yes.
---
I haven't played with toxic perks or add ons with wraith.
---
So in conclusion, the first point is exaggerated massively and twisted to fit the narrative of complaining on something trivial to complain on, compared to complaining about something many do complain about, ie haddonfield with balanced landing. The rest are not complaints rather, observations you have made on me playing and/or faded incorrect memories.
---
Maybe they'll add a secondary objectivity the game where you have to find ointment and moisturiser for the Trapper and care for his wounds 
---
I disagree, I like that killers get more points on average than survivors; it's like a reward for playing the more stressful role.
---
what am i supposed to be looking at
---
All problems with people deranking/queue times are now fixed. Everyone gets to be rank 15!
---
The ultimate goal is to do gens, but you want to make saves, get in chases, and help teammates. This is where you get points. And you will die ... a lot. That's just part of the game and happens to even the best survivors.
---
Claudette has a perk called Empathy which really got me off my feet. It lets you know when someone is injured nearby by showing their aura. That way, you'll have a good idea of the killer's location may be. If you see the survivor jumping around, dropping pallets then you know he or she is in an active chase - so jump on a gen and get busy.
---
I hope that helps. Have fun out there! 
---

---
I definitely think you‚Äôre right. How do you think the Estate affects The Spirit? 
---
You do. If you buy the chapters as a whole, you get additional cosmetics (though some are pretty lacking).
---
Ah, so you can't do the old "run up behind whilst charging" trick to get the one-hit, eh?
---
I don't own the DLC, so I've never had an opportunity to use the character.  From what I understand, you have to block them into close-quarters and hope to get more than one at a time?
---
Nurse is outside the map, look at the fence. 
---
By not playing them
---
Yes, optimization is general.
---
What is noed
---
He's just standing there, *menacingly*.
---
:,(
---
Almost like legion has 0 counterplay but hide like a rank 20 and try and genrush before they see you and tunnel you down. Wonder why no one wants to play vs them 
---
The clown is very fun to play when chasing as his bottles can be used to strategically block off loops or reduce loops forcing survivors to lose the loop much faster. 
---
He is probably the best killer if you like ending chases quickly without constant pallet looping. His attack recovery animation is very satisfying and the add-ons you can get with his power are fun to play against. Though his ultra rares seem strange with one allowing him to instadown a player if they are hit by the bottle, a boring addon and the other revealing the aura of intoxicated survivors for 6 seconds which is a bit worthless considering its an ultra rare.
---
Pig is probably the most versatile killer with a good power that wastes time and provides you with a chance at stealth. Can be really fun to use as seeing survivors panicking after you jump scare them is really satisfying. Other than her power however she plays very much the same as any of the other killers with the same chasing and pallet looping issues. Having a shorter height though gives her advantage at mind games in loops. 
---
Her add-ons are ok with the most fun probably being the reduced trap timer and hiding box auras until the trap is activated.
---
Pig is also great for the end game as survivors are forced to remove trap before leaving the game. Can make end game builds significantly more viable and much more tense.
---
Doctor is alright to play. His ability to electrocute survivors and block their actions while looping can be really fun as it screws over less experienced survivors and not having to deal with immersed survivors is great. You also get very good BP with him due to his high deviousness.
---
His addons make him really fun to play because they can do so many things to screw over survivors. One of the best is a addon that creates illusionary pallets for survivors that disappear once approached. Can really help with chases. His ultra rare makes it that everytime you shock a survivor a random effect is applied to them. 
---
Overall though I would say Pig is the most fun to play due to her versatility meaning more builds work on her and that her traps help reduce the speed of the game.
---
Clown would be my second favourite due to his power helping with pallet loops and the feeling of satisfaction when you pull of a difficult throw.
---
Doctor is my least favorite when it comes to fun as he tends to get beaten quite a lot at higher ranks. His power doesn't really slow the game down at all and just works as a good primer to find survivors to chase.
---
&gt;Shouldn‚Äôt need two perks to get 30k to 50k.
---
Why?
---
There are 4 Survivors and only 1 Killer. 
---
It makes sense that you get less BP individually because you‚Äôre an entire team working together.
---
You want 30k BP just for escaping and never encountering the killer? LOL. 
---
‚ÄúNo man, I want 50k BP for running him around all game‚Äù 
---
So, then how much BP do your teammates get?
---
I‚Äôm all for survivors getting an increase in BP. But, it should never be as much as the killers.
---
Oh, sweet summer child.
---
No thanks, I seriously don't want EVEN more of a grind going through the dreaded bloodwebs. 
---
To jump on this, when you don't  know who the killer is - always be looking. Always. Myers get stronger by stalking so if you see him hanging out in the bushes just looking at you, find cover. Quick. Also the Pig is silent stalker as well so you may see her creeping in the bushes as well.

GG means Git Gud.   Hasn't meant good game for years.   
---
They can't do PTB on consoles because they have to go through a long verification process through Microsoft/Sony that would ultimately just delay the chapter.
---
Ugh, why
---
If it's EVERY killer I may have bad news and say it's you.
---
I‚Äôve never seen this but I just know that this was a repost.
---
True, what happened to me was that I got hit just after vaulting the window which probably wasn‚Äôt meant to happen as killers can‚Äôt really hit that far. I hope they fix the hit boxes soon, but I think the dedicated servers might help because as someone else mentioned in the comments, it was because he was in Russia and I‚Äôm far away from there. üòÄ
---
I did 3 whole gens and escaped and got like 10 thousand
---
I don't think that's true in the slightest. What does GG WP stand for then?
---
Damn I wish I could play on PC. Just waiting on the next Steam sale :/
---
Not a good advise but . Just dont. Saves you time. Pain. and cancer.
---
ScottJund is [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk9gPdY4fbH0BRhyTio9XIg], he's a twitch streamer and I don't really know to which person you are refering with those two changes.
---
I know that scott made this list of his ideas for the game: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sqjvid
---
Of course that list is pretty old by now.
---
That would be cool, but I hate seeing Map offerings on my bloodwebs.
---
If there is a Map Offering in a blood web line, I'll most likely never get it.
---
I rather want them gone than improved in this way.
---
You may have Self-Care, but do you truly care about self?
---
Oh, just ideas, I thought that was an upcoming change.
---
I know there‚Äôs one dev at least who floats around and usually appears in streams by himself to at least talk about potential future changes.
---
None. She was a celebrity in the 2000‚Äôs and Clown owned a fucking horse. How would they be connected. All of these connections are theories. I like the theory that Adam‚Äôs train crashed because of Rin‚Äôs dad but it‚Äôs just a theory. I was tempted but I pulled through from saying it.
---
You need to be right up on them in an area with no pallets, windows or too many trees. LF is basically the BBQ chapter.
---
I play killer sometimes and people will have a decent ping and still teleport a tiny bit in my trials sometimes :/
---
It's like DBD survivore on console have brain damage  or something. Play on both xbox and ps4, most of the time survivors are doing everything else but gens, and thwn have the audacity to send me hate mail after I did 3-4 gens while they playee ring-around-the-rosey with the killer. Not even the SWF groups  on console are competant, idiots can barely do gens, "You only need 2 fingers to do generators stop using your buttcheeks!"
---
I can barely play survivor on console nowadays solo without wanting to switch to killer and rip their faces off. 
---
*Barney the dinosaur voice* 2+8=11
---
That might be McLean.
---
I‚Äôm on both idgaf. Lol

That last second hit though üòÇ
---
remember to forget about survivors, you are cutting your losses and pulling out, anyone left there is now on their own, I REPEAT, IF YOU AREN'T ALREADY, YOU ARE NOW-
---
How is a ex-rugby player connected to a Russian Woman from ww1? The Last Breath was the only chapter with linked stories.
---
&gt;Thank god we‚Äôre getting dedicated servers soon.
---
I'd temper those expectations if I were you.   Devs aren't historically know for actually telling the truth about timelines.
---
Yup, he wasn't happy lol
---
DAY TIME
---
Dwight couldn't come. He's in the locker. 
---
I am not being ridiculous, to me, and I can only speak form my POV. And I have no issues with him, I can consistently get wins with him.
---
If you say "autistic kid that has to be bullied" you pretty much made your entire argument invalid. ggs.
---
lmao that last from could be the "to be continued" meme.
---
How does she plan to hover ominously?
---
Thank the gods, it was boring playing at R1 anyways ... (from the killer perspective of course)
---
BP bonuses are necessary. It's ridiculous, especially with a killer that tunnels to the extreme so that you can never work on a gen and your only hope of getting more points is a brief moment when you can juke them out to cleanse a totem or do a tiny bit of a gen before either the killer tracks you back down or he stumbles upon you while chasing another survivor. Which the part of me that plays killer has to bring up, unless the survivor is a toxic, trolling, annoying little shit or you get a bonus for attacking them as your obsession, why are you going so far out of your way to ensure why this one survivor can't do anything while gens are popping all around you?
---
well, they are updating the unreal engine so that alone should help slightly then they can go really go changing shit. if they are following the road map they gave us
---
Honestly never understood why nobody has done it besides them 
---
I am actually confused why they made is so gross. It is still a game that we have to like and and play I just cant stand all the puke geeez. It is just disgusting
---
What did it say?
---
Platform: PS4
---
Type of bug: Visual
---
Description: Three games today (one was against a Nurse on Lery's, one was a Myers on Red Forest, I forget the other killer but it was on Coldwind) have had [b]invisible totems.[/b]
---
Says the guy with an edgelord username. How‚Äôs freshman year of high school going? Gettin bullied a little?
---
Shouldn't the doctor be okay with vegans because he knows they are eating there vegetables?
---
95% of players that said survivor deserves to get less bloodpoints were spoke from the killer main. What a salty attitude..
---
Ahhh a missed opportunity!
---
Those are 7 games ruined for other people.
---
Actually I just haven‚Äôt changed my username since freshman year,  but at least I haven‚Äôt permanently scared my body with a video game reference.
---
i still don't see it
---
Yup flawless job they done did
---
Just for the future notice, "black pip" is known as safety pip, as it protects you from losing the rank score.
---
2v8 sounds fun until you realize how easy it would be for the killers to work together and insta down everyone. Also two hags spamming traps would probably crash the bhvr servers. 
---
I love this so much, BRILLIANT! 
---
Saying =/= Doing. ‚ÄúYour honor I didn‚Äôt kill this man,‚Äù isn‚Äôt a valid argument and neither is this.
---
I know this is a joke comment, but wow, you're good at making that sound real.
---
In those games, are you able to target one person in such a way that they are effectively unable to play the game? Didn't think so.
---
&gt;Chapel building isn't nearly as bad, it doesn't even have pallets.
---
There was this one time the Chapel spawned with 3 open windows on the ground floor. I had BL and I think this was an actual infinite because the killer couldn't catch me.
---
Don't forget the Haddonfield infinites that devs refuse to fix.
---
....Yet
---
It‚Äôs not your body so why do you even care? 
---
Unless you're playing the Nurse.
---
Math not clear, got dick stuck in my monitor 
---
i wanted to be a killer but decided to be survivor main because...
---
bad frames on console
---
90% will get abused if its 4k/no 4k
---
the list goes on...
---
until they fix the frames then maybe i will deal with the abuse..until then i will enjoy my holiday at survivor ranch
---
Lmfao,  she said last one to the exit is jerk. 
---
Someone else doing something stupid doesn't force you to do something. You are a person, not a program with a preset set of instructions. You have to choice to punish the hooked survivor for being farmed and continue to prevent them from actually playing the game, for no real benefit to yourself. Or you can choose to punish the unhooker and also win.
---
There is no downside to getting the unhooker (because someone doing this is announcing that you are going to win), so the only question becomes whether you want to pile on the shit or not.
---
If they followed you though the loop like a bot and didn't take any of the doorways/didn't moonwalk any of the corners then that's on them for not playing the tile properly.
---
You can call shack an infinite if you're blindily following the survivor through the loop.
---
DCing at the very end of the game? All that does is take away her own points and hurts nobody
---
One time I was looping a Meyers around a truck with a pallet on it. Boy oh boy did I shit myself when I realized the truck wasn‚Äôt actually hiding me from his stalk and that t3 music started playing. 
---
This is exactly what I am thinking m
---
HE ONLY HAD HIMSELF TO BLAME
---
Shoulda got sloppy butcher
---
What do you mean the end of the game? If she had at least one hook state left or any chance of surviving it was not ok. Anyways once she dc‚Äôed she gave the killer more time to kill others.
---
BTW you could win this way. Using the corruption.
---
Bald dude with a goatee/beard?
---
Does she want to feel the heat with somebody? 
---
Because when they ragequit on the PTB it doesn't count against them in the main game. So they can do it with impunity. It's a big reason why the PTB has few people on it beyond day 1. That and Survivor Mains want to get the last use out of their pre-nerf Decisive Strike. 
---
Same. I think it hasn't got as many likes as it deserves is because a lot of people didn't understand.
---
Yeah the girl legion variant is absolutely a vegan 
---
I wasn‚Äôt talking about the one match that everyone had balance landing and they went to the legions map. Its prior matches in different maps and if they had balance landing and you weren‚Äôt expecting it. You‚Äôd complain a lot about it. 
---
They all accumulate to you either saying survivors are too strong and/or saying it‚Äôs the games fault but not your owns.  There‚Äôs always and exterior reason to why something didn‚Äôt work out the way you wanted it. 
---
For the wraith match it was in the game map when someone spawned on  Ruin and someone in chat said that you were using specific add ons but you complain about survivors using toxic perks. (Which I don‚Äôt give a fuck about) but your response came off as guilt tripping. ‚Äú hardly use Mori‚Äôs ‚Äú ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs never enough. ‚Äú 
---
I mean even your responses seem like you can‚Äôt accept criticism. I‚Äôm not telling you lies. I‚Äôm stating criticism.
---
You can say they are all lies all you want. Your opinions came off as facts. When you say ‚Äú in conclusion she‚Äôs pretty weak‚Äù I‚Äôd think to myself ‚Äú Well shit. She is weak. ‚Äú 
---
Don‚Äôt take it as an attack lol 
---
 I didn‚Äôt call you a 6 year old kid that got your cookie taken away from you. Or any insults towards you directly.  I knew you would be in this page. Did I expect you to write back? Nah. But fuck it‚Äôs pretty fun that you did. 
---
Wasn't Jeff connected to Legion's story? I might be remembering it badly.
---
Just above Meg's head. 
---
I try not to let it get to me and I didn't used to in the beginning. I've just seen so many High profile players openly bashing people who hide instead of working on gens or looping the killer. Personally I get scared sometimes (which is why I love scary games) and need to hide for a second to collect myself or figure out a plan before running around like a maniac lol
---
Vegans eat apples
---
Because patchs have to be approved by Sony/Microsoft before they can release them, it takes 1 week/ 2 weeks
---
Personally I think that when players don't like something, in any game, they need to voice their opinions so the devs know how players feel about changes in the game. I only think it becomes crying when someone repeatedly complains about something that could be overcome by advancing your skills in the game. It feels rare nowadays to voice you opinion on why you dislike something without people responding in a dismissive way. People take chances at conversations and turn them into "Git gud" and "Stop crying".
---
I'm on a BOAT!
---
I think pig is better at memorial since it‚Äôs all dark. 
---
Yes, if you count them both being from Ormond. Otherwise there is a theory that Jeff‚Äôs dad was the cleaner the Legion killed.
---
Pig. Built in stalling, stealth for potential gen grabs, and ambush is good for mindgaming loops. She brings more with her kit than the other killers you're looking at imo.
---
Because if they make the secondary objectives hard enough to have a big impact at rank one the escape rate below rank 10 goes to like 0%. 
---
Amanda will judge you if you eat anything that comes from a pig (bacon, pork, etc).
---
Yes, discount Dweard Dwight.
---
What else are killers supposed to do they can‚Äôt patrol any gens?
---
No. The times I‚Äôve seen her DC, she does it the end of the game IN the exit gate when the game is over. She plays the game out but DCs instead of escaping. Again, only thing that hurts is her own BP loss.
---
Terror radius takes into account vertical distance now?! Maybe the game map will be more tolerable. 
---
How long have you played? 
---
My first two - three months of playing I never got further than rank 10. Then I somehow broke the pattern. Earlier I would focus on just doing gens and only go for saves if the killer was on the other side of the map. Terrified of the heartbeat. Now I do all at once (letting the killer chase me, save and heal teammates, cooperating on gens A LOT more) and always pip even if I don‚Äôt survive. I guess your main problem is finding out how to not get downed instantly.  Watching YouTubers like for example Monto and Noob helped me a lot to get confident with the killer around. If you don‚Äôt do that already then you really should, and random juking videos. 
---
As survivor you get to play with friends, some like the thrill of getting chased and appreciate the soft horror element.
---
Finally someone comments on the Amanda joke.
---
He‚Äôs dummy thicc so he can‚Äôt move around because his ass cheeks clap when he walk
---
&gt; just crouch and stay still. Legion just gets confused
---
If they fall for this more than once, they're trash.  No decent killer falls for that same trick more than twice in a row.  There's no time to put distance between you and the killer, so eventually he will find you.
---
&gt; to beat legion the same way you beat any other killer, by looping them, but you can't with legion, just accept it
---
This wouldn't be a problem if there was another way to beat him.  The problem is you can't beat Legion *at all* when he counters both looping and mindgames, the only gameplay survivors have for survival (aside from immersion). Legion is an annoyingly broken m1-simulator.
---
oh, in the summer they will fix the framerate?!  cant wait!
---
NIGHT TIME
---
Thank you üñ§ glad you like it
---
Balance landing game - I don't remember how far back you have had to go to find this. Could you give me a clip.
---
Wraith game - Give me a clip of that too please as I have no idea what it was on about (im guessing that will be easier as its recent)
---
If you think my opinion is facts that's on you not me. I state over and over again its just my opinion.
---
What's wrong with your booty
---
For sure and cortisone 10 for the plague 
---
Specifically only the hatch grab animation would override other anims.
---
Interesting...
---
Have you ever heard of an achievement called 'Deranged Pursuit'?
---
Enduring + Spirit furry will always be superior to brutal strenght, plus since the number of pallets got nerfed it isn't really necessary.
---
And she will probably kidnap a pig from a farmhouse ~~(or a slaughterhouse)~~
---
hell yea but the butcher is more brutal
---
Absolute crap.
---
When other games can patch out issues to updates within 1 week.
---
This is absolute misnomer and needs to stop rolling round the internet giving developers excuses not to do any work.
---
Thanks 
---
Nice 
---
Imagine just getting the game and finally getting the basics down and have a rank 1 killer completely dominate you as they struggle to even pip once out of 10 games
---
It's so easy to tell who only players survivor and is infact scared to play killer and be bullied. And no, nobody believes you when you say you play both, sorrynotsorry
---
&gt;The only original dlc that has that, as you said, it's legion.
---
I remember people posted theories on here that the defective product that Spirit's father's company had released was what led to the train derailment that killed Adam. Granted that's no where near concrete but it at lease loosely makes sense given Adam was studying in Japan and Rin lived there. 
---
Overall I agree though that connecting the chapter a little would be nice for cohesion. At the very least a cliche that Jane was investigating the ancient legend of the Plague or was in the area on field worlk.
---
I'm pretty sure it was sarcasm
---
Edgar Allen Bro is another one. Used to be a nice guy but then decided to troll as Survivor, repeatedly click the flashlight, tea-bag, all that, and now ragequits when he gets outplayed by Legion or if anyone dares to mori him. Even though he often gets carried by his team. 
---
Seems like a nice guy IRL but I don't support people who troll and ragequit like that. 
---
PS4 (i guess all platforms)

ingame bug
---
description: When adrenaline procs just when you get downed, you become unable to move for a second, making the killer able to easily down you again.
---
steps: 1. Make the killer down you. 2. Just before you get downed, pop the last gen. 3. Adrenaline procs but you are still in the downed state, making it easy for the killer to pick you up or just down you again
---
Yes. That‚Äôs the one. Cheers. He mentioned legion rework and secondary objective (as I‚Äôve said). Something to potentially look forward to.
---
We out here lmao low key survivors should get the same treatement. Im tired of seeing scrubby ass survivors in rank 1. Fuck outta here with that weak shit.

I approve this message.

The pig is pretty fun. You can get some good jump scares on people. I was a Doc main for a while and loved him. He's great at just causing a shitload of chaos and has some pretty interesting addons.
---
Dude, I'm not a big fan of a lot of DBD streamers but maybe think about how saying "Ochido with boobs" is a bit problematic and toxic before complaining about toxicity yourself.
---
Plague would prop be cool with vegans cause she has APPLE.
---
I watch so many videos I can try look through all your uploads lol But I specifically remember being frustrated at a match in Penn Asylum. You upload 18362 videos a day so it‚Äôs hard lol 
---
Yeah this one is easy but The wraith match is [this one](https://youtu.be/TTmhWS3lmhE)  
---
And I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt use good add ons/perks at all. You do what ever you want. It‚Äôs just again came off like you were guilt tripping someone. It was off putting. 
---
I mean a lot of people though you were crazy when you kept saying she was weak (because you sounded so sure) and some thought that you needed more time... But I guess that‚Äôs on me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I was hoping the hag would be under the 'vegans taste funny' category
---
Excuses. If your 10 feet away your a faker who walks away and comes back straight away. The Pros like tru3 and noob3 dont need to fake camp to win the match. It's clear as day it makes the game go longer. Your proven that your a troll killer with how you play so this opinion is irrelevant to the conversation.

Possibly, possibly not. Not very many people will even recognize what this tattoo is lol. I‚Äôve seen worse. At least it‚Äôs not a naked woman or some poke-and-stick tattoo of a smiley face lmao
---
Well it's weird. As I said, I only have 2 survivors built - 1 level 51 Bill and a level 13 meg. Bill is my persona so i play him (but i'll be playing more MMO/team style using survs and flexing surv choices). I almost never died and escaped up to around 50% of the time.  
---
Then something happened. For two days straight I have 1 escape and like 100 deaths. Can't break 5k points. Normal games the week before I was netting 16-25k every game.  
---
Wait, wait...  
---
Is this the difference between solo play and having my 1 friend join me? Is that intel so valuable? The two who join me rarely call out anything but useless gibberish - except to know that they are being chased by their freaking out..... OMG! insight, thank you (for helping along the pudding of my brain)  
---
I'm quite confident with killer around so I finally remembered to ask myself - when did the losing streak start and what were the common elements.  (Also, I have had a 2 day dryspell of shrouds, shrouds seem incredibly helpful)
---
Yeah apparently its another update to Unreal Engine and some other stuff 
---
She's super fun and doesn't really get old tbh. I've talked to a few other players whove been non stop playing her so sadly your the minority. Also what's better than puking in the face of a toxic survivor amirite? 
---
Not even gonna credit the original poster?
---
Tbh hitting red ranks on killer has always been harder to do than survivor. (Assuming you're not running DS/Noed every game)

They could've at least made Jane host a documentary about the Temple of Purgation and its history or something

I too love Freddy, and I get constant 4K‚Äôs with him too, it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs good though. Like I said, you can 4K with every killer, it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre good. 
---
What makes you think that I care? I thanked OP for giving me entertainment.
---
I viewed those messages, such toxic jackasses. There logic is so flawed.. pack yourself blood warden and no Ed then watch them try to teabag 
---
This legit looks like it should be somebody's desktop picture.
---
I think this topic needs to be hammered home and having moderators on both this subreddit and official forums ban anyone that's opposing it will only make things worse in the long term.  
---
The cold hard truth is this, she shouldn't have that "fog whisperer" privilege and with the mass amount of DCing she has done both in the past and present any regular player would have had to buy this game five times over.  
---
Now before the Sir Beardalots come riding on in with the most majestic white horses in all of Tamriel, this isn't only about the perceived morality of DCing but rather that they are turning a blind eye to someone doing something that is very clearly against the rules.  If you, me or anyone else here did DC to such high volumes we'd no doubt be rightfully banned.  
---
So why are they giving special conditions for her and for all we know her friends as well?  Does she hold some deep dark secret over them?  Are they best friends?  What exactly is keeping them from pulling the trigger on her when they happily jumped on the opportunity for people like Ochido and Noob3 before?  
---
After seeing the recent video clips, there's such a sheer arrogance to her tone I'm surprised anyone could be bothered to defend this and still enjoy hot showers.  She has zero shame in what she's doing and is using this disguise of "it's good content" to justify a 7k hour player getting into games with people that are nowhere near that.  Shit, I wouldn't be shocked if most killers she runs into at those ranks have barely broken 100 hours.  
---
I can't speak for her actual character off stream since I don't know her, but goodness gracious the way she is on stream tells me she's a miserable person.  You're *30* years old, Jen.  Take some responsibility. 
---
In fairness, that was a bit harsh of me, but puttering around Twitter and seeing a representative of the community continue to talk shit got me spun up. 
---
It doesn't excuse her streaming after deranking intentionally and calling other players slurs, or 'fucking idiots'. 
---
Balance of things, my 'Ochido With Boobs' versus screeched insults and toxic post game chats, I think my karmic standing is okay. 
---
Guess the Entity was too harsh on her.
---
To be fair we got promised a Freddy and Nurse rework a while ago, but hearing something is always better than having nothing.
---
What was this LF's name? o-o
---
love that guy
---
The devs said one of the license holders was up for it and that killer was getting some cosmetics, but that was a while ago and AFAIK nothing else has been said about it since. 
---
Half-life 11 coming soon‚Ä¶
---
self-care by slicing your wrists open 
---
As the killer I was able to grab someone because of that the other day
---
It's not only the DC'ing. Shed overwhelmingly been toxic towards these players on stream in the past, and it's gross. 
---
Casual god seemed like myself, then I saw the stoner part and üò≠üò≠üò≠ i really got called out on Reddit 
---
Everyone has teachable perks that you need to unlock and you might also want to play more than one character. Variety is not a sin.
---
What does it mean to brick a console?
---
Oh I know, I've seen her do it a few times when I've pulled her stream up before.  It's honestly so off-putting and her chat is like a really weird cult that completely dogpiles anyone that judges her doing so.  
---
What is really amusing and pitiful due to self-awareness is how these same white knights will accuse anyone critical of her as having no life when she has a chat that is run like a hive and parrots everything she says.  It's so fuckin' weird, man. 
---
Guess what? He saw you. Shame it too late, but what a wonderful spawn. 
---
Probably with somebody who loves her ...
---
I think what we're saying is that it would be nice if they did (or had, from the start), it would be more cohesive  and could still demonstrate that the entire can take people from a variety of times and places, it just seems like a wanted opportunity
---
It's 60 at tier 3. And yeah it can be effective especially against SWF
---
It means that it has become basically like a brick and won‚Äôt turn on or do anything. 
---
Thank you for the info, i am so excited for the freddy rework. Been waiting nearly a year for it now.
---
Could be Nea with the Jacket that came with Spirit DLC and her default head or a colour variant of it?
---
I played Huntress for my daily and got ‚Äúgg ez baby killer‚Äù even with all 4 hooked and killed. Some survivors are toxic and salty whether it‚Äôs deserved or not.
---
Pffft right, see the number of players there and here. F13 is literally nothing.
---
In my opinion as survivor, Meg, Claudette, Feng, and Dwight are great starters. Feng‚Äôs perks are great as a new player as you can get used to gen skill checks safely, escape with vaults, and keep a general idea of where the killer is. I highly recommend using Bond (a Dwight perk) as well. It will help you finds teammates for help and by watching closely, you can see others getting chased so you know where the killer is. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough and even as a semi-proficient survivor, I always bring it. 
---
Other general tips - spread the gens out. If you finish one, don‚Äôt be afraid to skip a closeby one so you don‚Äôt cluster the last few together. Try to get the centermost gens done early. Try to get in the habit of doing totems even if they‚Äôre dull. Too many players ignore them and it‚Äôs a good habit to start early. Eventually you will get an idea of what killers this is most crucial for but it‚Äôs good to familiarize yourself with their spawn points. Not everyone will agree with me on this but don‚Äôt wait at pallets. I see too many people get greedy for a pallet stun on the killer. If you‚Äôre running around a pallet, try to refrain from using it til you need to. Unhooking teammates can be scary at first but if someone is hooked and you aren‚Äôt somewhat about to finish a gen, sneak in there. Also if someone saves you, you can run off a bit if you want, but don‚Äôt go so far that the rescuer decided not to heal you. A quick teabag and they should heal you right up. And if you see Michael Myers, please break line of sight and don‚Äôt feed him. 
---
Good luck!! 
---
uh you really do need a headset
---
You see the same with a lot of streamers. That said, I'll always enjoy watching a streamer that isn't afraid to lose than a saltfest. 
---
1v8v1, two killers trying to out kill the other killer while the survivors try and not all die.
---
I feel bad for that Leatherface. Being T-bagged and not getting a deserved kill. Sad that DbD does not have cookies as Indentity does (cookies is a channeled spell (long channel), which will down a survivors in the area if they stay within the radius. So, she would be forced to go down, and get hit.
---
What are those perks? I'm sorry, Killer, but if you think that's a viable build... 
---
I've been playing for two years and I didn't know there was a tutorial.
---
I didn't realize it until I looked at the comment to see if this was bullshit click bait and zoomed in, that's fucking funny to me.
---
She DCs after exit gates are open and everyone is safe or on death hook when everybody is too far to save her. Go watch the stream.
---
Freddy is a more consistent doc with wallhacks and has power that can apply as many pressue pig puts with a tap of a button. If we are talking about addon less killers, freddy is above these i mentioned. Doctor's base kit shock therapy range is so small it does little to nothing, Pig's RBTs are much more unreliable and her stealth is just bad, wraith has the same problem freddy had (unable to attack until he uncloaks) except  he can apply zero pressue and bubba has no power against survivors with half a brain. Addons change the tide of everything yes, but freddy still becomes the best out of them
---
‚Ä¢Class photo and Nancy drawings give him the best stall in the game, and he becomes a beast with wallhacks that has survivors under his mercy
---
‚Ä¢Wraith addons make him mid tier at best, he is still looped very easily (like freddy) but at least he isnt as bad
---
‚Ä¢Leatherface is only playable with insta addons, but he still cant apply pressue
---
‚Ä¢Amanda's addons are only useful on meme builds, basically she has no addons 
---
‚Ä¢Doctor's playstyle changes a lot with addons, his tracking and stall are still not very consistent though unless he runs the restraint addon
---
&gt; Prove Thyself: A more selfish version of Leader which sucks even more.
---
I think you are outdated. Leader sucks and prove thyself is decent.
---
This has extremely low regret potential
---
doesnt matter when they can literally go to sleep and wake up the next day and still reach the next pallet
---
Thats‚Äôs terrifying

That only makes me want to kill them first so as to teach them a lesson. Also, really satisfying if they teabag at a pallet and you continue the chase only for them to get snagged in a Trap. Karma in this game is soooooooo satisfying. 
---
Well, I don't own any DLC, so I haven't played any of the non-base maps firsthand‚ÄîI'm just extrapolating based on what I see going on in videos that I've watched.  I haven't seen many Spirit videos, and even fewer Estate videos, but from what I have watched I think that that map might break the theory a little bit.  In some aspects, anyway.
---
The Spirit is an ambush killer, and in order for that to be effective, the geometry has to be favorable to it.  On the plus-side, there are lots of tight corners, narrow passages, and right angles in the Estate map that look ideal for bodyblocks and ambushes.  Additionally, I've noticed that at least a couple of the generators are blocked on two sides, meaning there's only two possibilities for someone to be grabbed.
---
The downside, though, I think was actually intended as a plus but turned out to be the opposite for most people.  The map is really, *really* cluttered with plants and grass.  The Spirit's ability blinds her to the presence of survivors, which means you have to rely on other clues to determine their exact location.  If you don't get the location exactly right, you miss the ambush, invalidating the whole point of the character.
---
I think the intent with the heavy foliage might have been to help provide those clues in the form of rustling sounds and grass waving, but the problem is that those clues are relatively unreliable or difficult to follow for many people; and from what gameplay videos I've watched, it really seems like most folks chase the scratch marks instead.  All that heavy plant matter obscures those marks, thereby inhibiting the killer's ability to follow the most obvious clues.  Though:  the visual theme of the map has an almost greenish hue, and combined with all the plants and other textures, scratch marks do seem to stand out really well when you can see them.
---
Another thing to consider is that "husk" she leaves behind when she uses her ability.  If she's standing out in the open in a reasonably well-lit room, it's sometimes pretty obvious that she's faking it‚Äîjust standing there, not phased.  But if you're running through tall grass, loop a corner, and all-the-sudden see that husk standing there, chances are you'll flip out, turn around, and run right into the real her bodyblocking the tight corridor you just tried to escape from.  So the jump-scare factor with all that map clutter is something to consider, too.
---
All-in-all, it's definitely playable for Spirit, but I think she does much better, though (from what I've watched that is) in maps like the Institute‚Äîall those bare floors make the scratch marks stand out like a flaming sore thumb and all the small rooms and tight quarters really lend well to the ambush mechanics.
---
Of course, all this is pure speculation on my part since I don't actually have any experience with it.  Heh.  Gotta take all I'm saying with a can of Morton‚Äîthe reality of her playstyle may be radically different than what I'm saying.
---
Maybe they're 'R' key was broken 
---
Haha no problem, it confused me at first too 
---
Mild buff, actually. Each generator grants a token now, so the perk has 5 tiers. So max increase is now *15%* instead of 14%, lol.
---
Oh no 
---
Trust me
---
you can make it look even worse
---
As a huntress, I completely avoid the middle loop building on every map.
---
Deranking to rank 11/10 doesn't make any difference, you get a ton of new/bad killers in the red ranks. It really isn't that hard to get rank 1 in this game, I got to rank one within two weeks of getting the game and I was still shit at the game. The emblem system doesn't reward being a good player, it is easy to rank up.
---
The only difference between rank 1 and 10 is that you will play against more people there at the start and in the middle of the season, as some people simply play the game more than others and rank up faster. That means if you only sit at red ranks you will get no variety as you go against the same people with exactly the same builds and playstyles every time. It is mind numbingly boring and I don't see a reason to be angry at people who choose to opt out of that till later on in the season when more people reaches red ranks. You can see that less and less streamers derank as the rank season comes to a close, as there is no reason for deranking at that point, there is a lot of people at red ranks then and it's fast to get games with variety.
---
Jen DCs at the end of the match as she's about to exit the game via exit game or die on her last hook, never at the start of the game as many other people do.
---
The devs allow for certain % of DCs. She plays the game A LOT, and DCs very tiny amount compared to the total number of games. There is nothing wrong with it.
---
Yup, you are correct ^_^
---
I can imagine it sucking for people who care about ranks. It's like the Entity is a perfectionist, and if the game doesn't go exactly like it wants, it yeets you into the void.
---
Yes, but being able to consistently get wins is different then get a lot. This means that I am obviously doing something right.
---
Lmfao!!! Holy hell that was funny!!! 
---
LoL is a huge e-sports competitive game with millions in revenue each month, from cosmetics to tournament funding. Balancing is literally the only way to keep the viewing high (though Riot has a pretty spotty track record of just keeping shit heroes shit forever, and leaving Lee Sin impossible to deal with years).
---
Most of the killers in DBD still get shit on regularly by half competent teams. The changes they've been making don't really buff Nurse, as she doesn't care about pallets or windows, so it would make no sense nerfing / reworking her before they get the game mechanics in the state they want.
---
She's the only killer who can consistently succeed at killing. Making her just another killer on par with the rest is a bad idea right now.
---
...what? What means you‚Äôre ‚Äúobviously doing something right‚Äù that you get wins with Freddy? If so that doing prove shit, because you can win with every killer at any rank. 
---
Now that you mention that, I do remember playing like, three games in a row on Mt. Ormond the other night.  I guess I just haven't gotten to play the others yet.
---
Has the locker ascended? Or has Freddy descended? 
---
If it‚Äôs every killer it may be your connection
---
Since you have noed the chases are cut incredibly short and you can try to get more out of that.
---
You dont have to hook the first guy you get, slug them and look for more. Survivors tend to get altruistic for people left behind so instead of camping the hook and letting them peacefully clense your noed and organise a rescue action with borrowed time/body blocking you can look for more people to down with your very skilled outplay perk.
---
That‚Äôs a good way to let him blow over.
---
Give him 115 too until he‚Äôs properly reworked?
---
REPRESENT 
---
I know but dbd may die out after the devs stop supporting it. Then again maybe OP is a diehard fan. 
---
If you have a IQ above 40 you would know what he meant, and this is definitely not worth posting.. just shows you being ignorant 
---
This is fantastic! Only critique: Should have freddy running along side the survivors.
---
Dedicated servers are coming.
---
I love the 3 escapes.
---
Teabagging at pallets, probably? 
---
There was a guy that got a 32 4K streak with a speed limiter Leatherface. At like rank 8. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8XcQoJHauA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8XcQoJHauA)
---
Does that mean that Leatherface with speed limiter is amazing? Nope, running speed limiter on Leatherface is a hindrance and will make your games harder. Every killer no matter how good they are can achieve a 4K near every game if the winds are in their favor. Or if they play magnificently well consistently. 
---
Let me just say. If you spent the same amount of time playing nurse or hillbilly. You would always be getting wins. Freddy relies the most out of any killer on the mistakes of the survivors/their luck and perks to prosper. 
---
Just because you managed to get some wins in the SSBM tourney with Ganon doesn't mean that he is a top tier player. It means you used a low tier character to abuse people's blank areas in the matchup. Even if you have 800 hours playing him. Especially when you got bodied by a fox player with only 100 hours playing them.
---
I'm not sure, he still can ignore pallets and vaults. He still doesn't really have counterplay, you just make him slower at what he does.
---
The purpose of the baind aid isn't to make him somewhat good, it's to make him less miserable to play against while we are waiting for the proper rework. Legion is currently the nr1 leading cause of people disconnecting and for a good reason, you don't really play DBD vs him.
---
Is that like search and destroy, a game where each and every player gets the exact same chance to play a full match as any other player? And you get to respawn at the end of  every round? Oh and you can easily play any of the other game modes available in the game? Oh and where it actually matters how your team as a whole does?
---
Seriously, Dead by Daylight is a fundamentally different game from pretty much any other. Saying "you play a certain way in this other game" just suggests a lack of ability to come up with reasonable arguments.
---
Reminds me of some recent salt I got from someone who was being toxic the whole game https://imgur.com/1AsphfT.jpg
---
Pig is really fun. There are so many ways to achieve the fun
---
Ah ok thanks for filling me in
---
She didn't go over the % number, otherwise she would get punished for it. The developers aren't having an issue with streamers deranking and DC-ing, the devs are the ones making the rules. Not you. Not TydeTime. You are achieving nothing with these pointless tirades.
---
The reason for deranking is that early on and up till the very end of the ranked season there is very little variety at the higher ranks. People who play the game a lot get in there much sooner than the rest of the community. So for the first 1-2 weeks you are stuck facing the same people all day every day with the same playstyles and builds. I know that you do, I've experienced it.
---
It is mind-numbingly boring to play against the same people all the time. People derank to have variety in their matches. If you check her twitter she has repeatedly mentioned that this is why she deranks. Facing the same people and already knowing what build they are running, what killer they are playing and what playstyle they practice is boring and brings no enjoyment to the game.
---
If you notice when the season is reaching its last week streamers stop deranking, as more people is at red ranks and you have variety again.
---
lol
---
I likr this idea, and the names fit!
---
You have no idea how many map offerings I have on killer since there's a 1 third of a chance I'll get a good map
---
Some others use it too but you'll know its me if you've moried me, i always say at the end "thank you daddy" üòÇ 9/10 im nea as well unless it's a special occasion. Most of my friends list on steam are those of killers who moried me it's awesome 
---
no problem.
---
Honestly if that's not tunneling, then nothing is tunneling :/

Haram!

I‚Äôm the immersed gamer

I found that not communicating with console players makes the game more fun. I turn messaging off. 
---
Do survivors pip in the PTB if they gen rush, maybe get 1 unhook, do 1 gen and get chased once?
---
I don't like playing nurse or Hillbilly, once you learn them it becomes to easy it seems.
---
Nah, we don't. 
---
I agree and we also need monthly bloodpoint events. Holidays are great for more than a weekend, (Halloween and Christmas)  but there is no reason why they can't do these every month. It will help new players to level up faster and that's a good thing for a game dependent on new players. 
---
You're telling me he's not based off Sharp Hand Joe!?
---
If you could do well at any rank why buff him then? If you can get wins consistently why buff him? Why buff a character that you can win with a lot?
---
Sounds good. Good luck man. Seems to be a lot of toxicity when your name is brought up ever since the Zubat rank 1 thread.
---
True that. The other guy is an idiot but I just wanted to point out that out. Hopefully OP won‚Äôt regret that tattoo lol
---
Because he‚Äôs weak. He is the worst killer, and just because I do well with him, doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs good. You‚Äôre confusing your words
---
\&gt;  there really isn't more to it than that. 
---
Yes it is. For me, it's exactly what they are trying to do, rewarding the more hooks you have. Any potato killer can get a 4k by camping, tunneling or 1-hooking everyone with noed. So it's great to reward killers who play fair and try to go for all 12 hooks. That's what's fun to me and what I strive to do every game, it makes you better at the game and feels way more satisfying than getting kills due to cheap tactics. Just had a match as huntress where I 12 hooked, hooked everyone before hooking someone twice and 2-hooking everyone before killing first one off. 3 gens left. Rank 1 btw. And instead of salty chat, I got ggs. And it really was good game and everyone had fun. But according to reddit you have to play scummy to win because survivors op and toxic, right? The hooks requirement is a great change, people will just have to get better at the game to pip instead of getting carried by camping or noed.
---
I feel bad when it happens most of the time.
---
Can someone please explain to me how a game could brick a console???
---
I don't know what TydeTyme has to do with this, but these views are my own.  The issue others are taking with this is that the developers aren't enforcing the rules they've clearly outlined.  You can rectify this by either changing them or reinforcing them.  If you are truly fine with being a regular player and having someone else that is also a regular player but happens to be streaming being allowed a lot more leeway or outright immunity to some rules then I don't know what to tell you.  
---
And yet you don't see anyone else that plays this game actually take an issue with staying in the high ranks.  Ardetha does fine, Tru3 does fine, Marth does fine, Monto does fine and so on.  They still manage to have great games and make great content because of it.  I'd even call her "making content" a stretch of the imagination because let's face it, she doesn't even have a very active YouTube channel like the others listed.  Her last upload was nearly a month ago. 
---
How is it these other players seem to run up against a varying amount of killers at the red ranks and somehow, as if cursed by some supernatural power, JenDenise only gets the exact same killers for hours and hours?  
---
The real reason is at those lower ranks you can run around doing whatever and having little challenge because of it.  Having had a few months of break and coming back to being in low yellow ranks from resets, I get the "appeal" of it.  The games are so incredibly in the hands of an experienced player that you feel like a God.  But the thing is, good players are supposed to blaze through those ranks and get to their own skill level quickly, not constantly revert back so they can openly talk shit about a Trapper that easily loses your SWF group in the cornfield.  
---
She's like that guy in online fighting games who pads their record by only accepting challenges from 9W/34L players and suddenly goes AFK when the 500W/40L guy pops up.  
---
Only the killers that are licensed from movies cost only auric cells. The rest are original, created by the devs, therefore they can also be bought by shards. The licensed killers are auric cells only because they need money to pay whoever they are borrowing the killer from.
---
Yeah I think it's a unpopular opinion to say it out loud haha. But he's kinda cool. I hate the Doc way more. And yep, moonwalking sucks. 
---
It wasn't just Tyde. You know that. 
---
Good point, with the new changes to Lithe it will be even better now that you can activate it on fast vault instead of chase.
---
You just got prank‚Äôd
---
The first one was  Published on 7 Aug 2018 this isn't a good indication of "always complaining if you have to reach that far.
---
The second video is a hater video which without even watching will have copy pasted loads of clips (most likely from a year ago) to paint a false narrative. I will check it out and report back.
---
So its basically videos of god knows when, most likely when I was mad in a match over a span of months, of me being hit with ds to create a false narrative. Yes I may complain about ds if I'm hit with it 3-4 times in a row every 3 months or w/e but again this doesn't exactly fit your "facts" about me complaining all the time.
---
Also that guy looks like he has a hate boner for me, so you should realize its gonna be highly biased and forced, note the red filter and turned up volume...
---
Kinda blatant to see man.  
---
An oddly relatable, yet tragic story.
---
If I may suggest a title; 'Dead by Disconnect' tends to roll well off the tongue.
---
Yep, everything she says about facing the same killers, whether it be the killer character or the person playing the killer, is true. I‚Äôve seen it on her stream too. I remember one stream where I swear she played against a killer named Quixotic like every other game lol. That‚Äôs another thing, with a smaller queue like that you also run up against people you know constantly, i mean know as in are friends with. Too many ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù games does tend to get a little boring for the stream imo. I don‚Äôt blame her at all for staying a bit down in rank for more player variety. 
---
Oh it‚Äôs majorly unpopular. Everyone hates on legion, and they are broken but it‚Äôs okay to enjoy them. It‚Äôs the combination of their power and the cool cosmetics. As soon as legion came out I immediately bought Joey because he reminds me of Dedsec from Watch_dogs, plus he just looks cool. I like being able to run super fast, but the deep wound thing is kinda boring. 
---
Dude, come on, you gotta have a little bit of mercy, it's not fair someone's time is ruined because their team bails or DCs, if it's just a 3 man, sure play normally so long as it's not just cunty try harding, but if you end up with just 2 or 1 people, don't fuck with them too bad. I usually just spook them whenever this happened, especially if I just so happen to be the Wraith, seriously, nothing freaks somebody out more than seeing the wraith uncloak on the hill just a few feet above their head, and it's fucking hilarious.
---
If you mind me asking, what the *fuck* is a, ‚ÄúFortnite immigrant?‚Äù
---
If you are talking about TydeTyme, please stop.
---
So much this. Thank you. That put into words exactly my feelings. 
---
he has every right to insult this poor decision
---
I love Urban Evasion. 
---
Yeah, the great and noble Tydetyme who also got called out for liking a post that called her a whore.
---
The rules are that you are not supposed to DC more than a certain % of your total games overall. That % is not known to the public and only devs know it. If she went over that % she would get punished. But she hasn't exceeded it as she plays a ton of games and DCs only a tiny % of them. So she's not breaking the rules. Unless you know what % it is and can prove that overall (along her off-stream games) she DCs more than she plays then go ahead.
