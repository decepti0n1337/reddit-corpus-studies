Well i guess you'll have to puck your flashy perks and deal with ruin and NOED
---
---
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse is my favorite perk, makes small TR killers like Legion or Spirit even better and allows you to get some stealth combination with others
---

---
M&amp;A on Nurse allows you to max blink to survivors while barely entering in your TR, combine with Nurse Calling and max range add-ons and they wont know what hit them
---
M&amp;A on Myers is amazing too, on T1 he has 0 TR and on T2 he has 8(6 with dead rabbit) Add-on. Combine with any mirror and you will be able to jumpscare people
---
Knock-Out may be great, it can work as a form or The Third Seal making downed people not be revealed to survivors unless they are near them
---
Discordance notifies you if 2+ people are working on the same generator, can be useful to surprise people if you have lot of movement speed
---
Tinkerer with prayer beads allow for some very easy grabs because when a gen is 85% done you get a notification and your TR drops to 0 for a few seconds 
---
*happy mask salesman intensifies*
---
Idk, I just *can*. Don't get me wrong though, I completely lose people from time to time.
---
‚Ä¶ It's a blind, dude. 
---
Maybe
---
Okay.
---
I guess it's supposed to go with their lore. Normal people until they put their masks on or some shit. I dunno.
---
I used to grind teachables, but now i have every killer teachable and most of the good survivor teachables, so i grind prestiges instead. 
---
You don‚Äôt add a period after a correction. This is basic English.
---
But the killer gets stunned
---
I run Small Game though lol, I just see no one else run it. 
---
Tons of characters have been on dry streaks. If you don't play as a character that is free (on PC), don't expect frequent cosmetic drops.
---
My boy Ace is finally getting more cosmetics.
---
Does hopping through a window not always make a big sound on the killers screen? 
---
This is the fifth time I've seen this post in less than a month. It should be pinned at this point.
---
Easy to avoid. Be careful how close you get and if you do get close, hit them.
---
Also always keep in mind how much damage a Deep Wound attack is going to do so you could just Frenzy to catch up and down them.
---
A good huntress with iridescent hatchets, legion, a spicy billy with bbq, a p3 nurse, doctor with iridescent king, and a camping leatherface. 
---
most killers above doesnt matter what perks, just plain annoying. 
---
oh, and a myerino with infinite tombstone. 
---
If you know what happened then why would you want to give that pos any money?
---
You didn't actually stun them with a pallet or a DS strike, you blinded them with a flashlight. I'm not arguing semantics with you anymore.
---
Right? But whatever, match over fast, line up the next group. At least it's somethin. I was going for a daily lol 
---
When you are already rank 20 no reason not to DC I guess lol. 
---
Where did your blood trails go tf
---
No, Claudette has decided that you want to die
---
Oh sorry, just saw it while shopping and thought about DbD.
---
Dude a normal flashlight blind doesn't stun no but a flashlight save does stun
---
True that
---
Big part of it is the perks that could help counter him aren‚Äôt the usual meta perks and nobody wants to switch it up. 
---
Legion is interesting because I see this as a start to the game evolving where people perk for where they struggle not just what is jack of all trades. Survivors have to branch out and evolve to. I‚Äôm tired of watching vids of survivors doing some of the dumbest crap and then getting away Scott free of they get busted and cry killer is committing some foul against them. 
---
You have more than enough time to search all the boxes.
---
Forgot it existed 
---
&gt;I'm not arguing semantics with you anymore.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
*world‚Äôs smallest violin plays*
---
Irrelevant but how do you get that blue title beside your name?!?!?!
---
So the problem is that they won't make map choices entirely random? If streamer's have a slight advantage with map selection you shouldn't be affected too badly if they announce the maps being played days before the matches started.
---
Why Resiliency over like Quick and Quiet/Iron Will?
---
LOL. And I'm getting down voted for warning people. Like, I'm not trying to tell people they can't, I just don't want them to risk losing all their shit without knowing they can. You know?
---
I KNOW. Sometimes I‚Äôll hit a survivor in the shoulder and it doesn‚Äôt count as a hit, while sometimes I‚Äôll miss so far that they literally couldn‚Äôt touch the hatchet if they stuck their arm out is it flies by and it hits
---
Yeah we could search chests like a boss. Does it still work with Sabo? 
---
This is why 99% of killers run Ruin at rank 1. The game is balanced around it at that rank.
---
Strange you were using Billy too. Its normally 2 gens done for your first chase (with no ruin), except with Billy and nurse.
---
enduring, spirit fury, ruin and discordance. 
---
i mostly play the weaker killers (pig, clown(sometimes), etc.) and you can thank Tru3Talent for the build. 
---
I even had my fellow survivors send me hate because they died and felt the need to blame someone.
---
I'm struggling to see how this is better especially for solo que. It's late I could be missing something obvious here?
---
This is one of my favorites out of every killer build for sure, i always run this but i switch nurses for enduring usually.
---
Yeah you can but you ruin it for everyone else by being a baby.
---
What was your thought process when thinking about posting this? On second thought, I don‚Äôt think I want to know....
---
Like a phantasm, she vanishes off to another plain of gen-rushing. 
---
what movie is this from?
---
You greatly overestimate my short-term memory...
---
Nah, Hillbilly on Backwater Swamp. It‚Äôs good to know there are more sympathetic killers though!
---
Tru tru. A world without consequences 
---
So the killer being braindead means its a shitty map feature? A killer can easily mind game. Its pretry balanced. And you can only vault a window 3 times. So the killer must be doing something wrong if you can loop for 1min 30
---
Delete this
---
That is bizarre as all hell, I'll get it taken care of for our sub.
---
I love just slowly appearing infront of people and trapping them in a corner when they're doing gens. 
---
Maybe differenr mixtapes could change the chase music, or atleast the different skins change it
---
um ok
---
You don't have to argue anymore but I can :)
---
Thanks. Appreciate it.
---
He‚Äôs been banned from multiple subs I‚Äôve posted in, but he keeps finding new ones
---
Object of obsession. It makes it so that there's a sweet spot range where if you look in the direction of the killer, both of you see each other's auras. 
---
I'm not sure but when this happens to me it usually appears like I lost rank but when I leave the lobby and check my rank is back to normal
---
By draft do you mean a random pick? If so, it was vetoed by the administrators in favor of the poll.
---
10 feet away when the pallet drops? Yep that's a stunning.
---
psssst... dont tell them that you can use bad players as bait
---
Sabo, and if they get slugged, they just get back up again
---
You touched the butt!!
---

---
Shs isn't flexing bro XD
---
yasssss this is the shit I live for
---
The Doctor‚Äôs lore is really fascinating to me. Trapper‚Äôs is a close second though. 
---
Implying freddy rework before 2021
---
I wish I had nurse's calling, hholy shit but need to level nurse to level 40 damn!
---
YES
---
If you live by this, i better not see you complain about NOED downing you before you are prepared for it.
---
Then dont Camp in any way (except for proxy camping, that actually gives the survivor a chance off the hook unlike other ways)
---
I don‚Äôt have any of her teachables because I‚Äôm on console and never bothered to level her up, but her perks are good. 
---
Change the game then
---
Ahh well at least he tried to let you farm.  Might've thought you were wanting to hit him with pallets and said 'forget that' lol.
---
Ok, have fun talking to yourself like a crazy person!
---
I'm a legion main speak for yourself 
---
Oh I thought you meant that 'legit build' is also what you run
---
Does M&amp;A reduce myers terror radius to 0?
---
Hmm, want to add me on PS4 so we e can practice? I'm learning nurse too
---
Recently played only works for survivors. When you play killer, people aren't landing in that list for some reason....
---
For me I hate going against the Hag. I don‚Äôt run urban evasion and crouching is too slow. Also I don‚Äôt have a perk I want to replace with Urban evasion. 
---
When combined with the Dead Rabbit offering it does. Only at Tier 1 though. It‚Äôs still very tiny at Tier 2. 
---
I do not recommend staying at Tier 1 for very long. 
---
Nah. I run Overcharge, M&amp;A, Blood Warden, and STBFL. 
---
Legally Blonde (2001)!
---
‚ÄúFrustrated oink‚Äù awwwüò¢
---
To be fair it‚Äôs good for BP. I‚Äôve run into it twice and just maxed out chase and got endless hits. Saw 3 toolboxes the 2nd time and took Deerstalker. I‚Äôll take Sabo Squad over 4x purple flashlights and ds every time. 
---
Why d/c against spirit?
---
Im sorry but not even Myers‚Äô abs can save him from being crushed by clowns thiccness
---
Its soooo bad now and I notice worse at higher ranks why is that?
---
They both need complete reworks. Legion needs a 100% overhaul. Freddy just needs a huge change to his ability, akin to a rework.
---
I know this thread is 4 month old but Deathgarden has 0 player playing it.. this game will have a price drop probably soon. 
---
That's why they've always required video evidence anyway, right?
---
Just out of curiosity, what‚Äôs wrong with Freddy‚Äôs power? I‚Äôve grown to really like it since I started playing him and I don‚Äôt want to lose that playstyle.
---
Sorry but it's gotta be the tombstone add-on. Tombstone piece won't get you enough to do all 4 and normal moris don't count.
---
And he can fly!
---
You'll need a Judith's Tombstone or Tombstone Piece add-on to get the trophy
---
Where the stickers stop and you can see the controller, that bugs me... Still cool tho
---
Haunted Grounds :)
---
But then NOED is wasted since they don't finish gens
---
I don't know much more. A moderator told me that because I didn't report one guy they couldn't get the logs. 
---
Legion is your Ghostface. And Pinhead would be sick..we should be able to find the puzzle box and make deals with him against other survivors.
---
Dying light is completely garbage on every killer unless you bring a mori , and even then I don‚Äôt like using it.
---
Freddy with over 10000 ping
---
Why not d/c against spirit? There‚Äôs no reason to even try against a decent spirit. She‚Äôs pretty close to nurse in the amount of counter play survivors are given
---
Imagine thinking ranks matter and being so sweaty you camp one survivor just to not de-pip.
---
They really missed a great opportunity to give her an anti-gravity ponytail with this one.
---
You act like you've never been in a 3v1 but whatever man keep DC ing lol
---
"I didn't come here to make friends, I came here to win!"
---
- Feng, probably
---
I need
---
[removed]
---
I main Spirit but I have never realized how much people disliked her.
---
I didn‚Äôt even get my three stacks because they would instantly unhook, bodyblock, blind, or instaheal.
---
Its as almost as if there's a gameplay issue on the killers side thats making it unfun to play as and thus increasing queue times.
---
I just can't put my finger on it.
---
i don‚Äôt get why they thought it would be a good idea to have it so you get a token for just a hook resecue, instead of only getting a token for a safe hook rescue
---
The game is poorly designed. There really is nothing else to it. It's bully simulator. Either killers get bullied by 4man yolosquad with most annoying builds ever or the killer bullies the survivors.
---
When Freddy mains dream
---
Yeah but its still a tiny range of increase.
---
&gt;Everyone I know get full lobby almost immediately will playing Killer or solo Survivor, but SWF somehow just isn't working. 
---
This a balance thing, it's a genuine issue with SWF.
---
Hmph, sucks
---
HONESTLY the mindgames are so fun and like the few times I‚Äôve played the spirit it‚Äôs so fun to get into a chase and then the minute they turn a corner pop her power and keep chasing. Or like when you know they‚Äôre desperate to finish a generator you leave and then use her power and you stand there invis and you can here the sounds that mean they‚Äôre working on it and then BOOOOOOOOOOOM. Basically yeah she‚Äôs reallllllly fun but i still prefer the hag tbh
---
Survivors just spawned on seperate generators with toolboxes or something. 
---
Haha that makes sense now. Thanks.
---
I used to only play survivor and always be like how the hell did that just hit me?  Eventually I started playing killer as well, and then huntress.  
---
That‚Äôs when I started saying, okay how did that not hit them? 
---
Lol sucks on both sides I think lol. 
---
I spend $200ish a month on makeup so I don‚Äôt think spending $9 on this thing is a waste of money thanks tho 
---
I'm gonna be that guy and say that fun is dictated by the players, not the devs. Otherwise how's that so many people find middle-low ranks funnier while the game is exactly the same?
---
Dude I think I was in your game XD I was playing ps4 and I matched up with a spirit who was in the same exact spot the whole entire game until the very end. 
---
I just listen to the music that plays in Damnnohtml‚Äôs huntress montage video. After all, I was inspired to play huntress because of that video, despite
---
 console limitations. 
---
Pot, kettle, say hello ;)
---
I‚Äôve been saying this ever since I first got to red ranks. There is NO incentive for being in red ranks, you‚Äôll just be getting harder matches and that‚Äôs it, so you‚Äôre gonna derank to get easier opponents, and because of that, more BP, just make it so that every time you get a rank color change you get more BP from games, then when you hit rank 1 you get another boost to encourage people to stay at high ranks
---
lol git gud and use Detective‚Äôs Hunch
---
It doesn't block pallets.
---
Lol @ the pissbaby killer who made this 
---
No, for whatever reason it's not considered a healing action.
---
Love me some Bing Bong, anyone got some other good/enteraining addon combinations since the rework ?
---
[Ghost](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/%22The_Ghost%22_-_Soot)\+[any of the](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bone_Clapper) [clappers](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Coxcombed_Clapper)for some surprise BingBong.
---
[All seeing](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/%22All_Seeing%22_-_Spirit) \+ [Windstorm](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/%22Windstorm%22_-_Blood)for map pressure. 
---
[Shadowdance](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/%22Shadow_Dance%22_-_Blood) \+ Enduring + Spirit Fury for those (almost) guaranteed hits /downs.
---
[Hound](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/%22The_Hound%22_-_Soot)\+ Sloppy Butcher for easy tracking after the first hit.
---
I have yet to come up with an idea to make [The Serpent](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/%22The_Serpent%22_-_Soot) work, any thoughts ?
---
I have three responses depending on my mood
---
1 - shrug and create another lobby
---
2 - grab an ebony Mori and seek revenge on the next bunch
---
3 - switch to my 'toxic doctor' build for the next few matches.
---
Lol what she‚Äôs still there
---
I get he's no fun due to little cougerplay but I agree with point 2. He's slow. Sure frank's mixtape makes it a little faster but thats a purple add-on.
---
Now compare that to Nurse who also has little counterplay but can slug an entire team in half the time.
---
As much as people cry legion is broken, he's still consistantly placed far below Nurse. Hmm, what does that say?
---
Tip: PlayStation messages app on your phone will allow you to view this entire message in one screen shot. 
---
It‚Äôs their way of buffing Hangman‚Äôs Trick
---
I don't pay much attention to my rank but i hear this is a visual glitch
---
Wow
---
I can feel my skills as Spirit actually slowly improving and have started getting my first 4ks. It could just be rank reset of course but I feel things will only improve once scratch marks are fixed 
---
Looking to protect yourself, or do some damage?
---
Lmao ok 
---
She did, but she was looming for a survivor
---
I had 4 Laurie‚Äôs with object of obsession lure me into the basement and just pop in and out of closets.
---
Sorry dude still don't know all the abilities, what's object of obsession?
---
exactly. its really not hard especially with a huntress. Throw the hatchet when they vault. This killer was so bad.
---
Tiny distance. It's crap.
---
Console gaming is definitely pretty lame
---
I switch to my Myers and run scratched mirror + Lery‚Äôs with one of the twenty ebonies I got during the winter event
---
The Survivor is able to see your Aura but you can see the survivor's aura too then
---
What is your build ? I found he became a bit tedius to play after entering red ranks. But so does almost any other killer \^\^
---
4 people with ds in one match is gross. Even as a survivor main I think shit should be nerfed.
---
I sit at a computer 40 hours a week please don‚Äôt make me look at one at home 
---
MAGIC
---
i sometimes do this only to get him to mori me or tunnel me the rest of the match because i love being chased by myers... i'm sorry
---
Nice.
---
I was thinking it would only flicker and burn out on first use.
---
Like, 2 charges max. 
---
For a classic try hard build - ruin, bbq's, enduring, spirit fury...
---
Meme myers build, m&amp;a,  run, bbq bamboozle + dead rabbit + some addons to increase stalk....
---
Your never gonna escape doc build - iron maiden, ruin, bbq, enduring +both calm addons and a offering to the game or lery's......
---
Not when there's a DLC literally titled "Shattered Bloodline"
---
Spirit isn't even that bad to play against. If you don't play stupid you wont get caught. I feel you just try to loop and 360 the killer all game then complain when you get sacrificed, but you can't do it against the spirit because you can't predict where she is going.
---
You forgot to tag "shitpost"
---
No duh.
---
Awesome
---
Thanks, good idea!
---
Looks dope. But what would the abilities be?
---
pig or clown and thanks for the downvote.  You probably just aren‚Äôt very good with Freddy.  I do very well with him, better than most killers. 
---
Those filthy poor people, amirite?

---
ahhh i play this alll the time. i keep it very simple .
---
if i die = 1 shot  
---
an escape = no shot, sip my beer
---
How the hell are Pig and Clown the worst? Clown is easily C tier and pig is D tier. 
---
I downvoted because I disagree with your opinion, nothing against you personally. 
---
I do well with Freddy too, he‚Äôs my main after all. Him being bad isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúme‚Äù problem it‚Äôs a Freddy problem. He‚Äôs legit the worst killer. 
---
Except give more than 3 situations in the past 10 years where someone got jailtime, or hell, even a small fine for saying KYS?
---
All the higher ranks need is incentive. I swear the devs said this would happen not long after the game's release......still waiting :(
---
Almost did‚Äôt catch him cause i was caught so off guard by the immediate jump
---
I have nearly 3k hours in the game, I think I know a little something about running a killer bub. 
---
No
---
"Claudette, come get your Flashlight, please." 
---
She looks like the zombie girl from Train to Busan. 
---
No one brought a flashlight.. yikes. It‚Äôs okay you just need your insta downs to feel accomplished I guess
---
I've seen matches (not my own personally, but others') where they did. Your experience is not indicative of everyone's.
---
Why post this? This is extremely toxic. Nobody has said that.
---
I‚Äôm not saying they brought flashlights but when they last second switch to Claudette last second expect to not have a fun time 
---
I had a Jake one game who‚Äôd throw down pallets, heal and get out of the dream state right in front of me. It got to a point where I had to stop chasing him because gens were getting done. It‚Äôs true that survivors think ‚ÄúI have time to finish this thing‚Äù which is why I run 2 block addons to make the dream transition 3-4 seconds for EZ pulls. 
---
Your still asking me if I have a brain I don‚Äôt really appreciate it
---
&gt;Extreme tunnel vision still, but plausible.
---
So normal killer fov then.
---
Yeah I was really disappointed of that window of opportunity there because she legit fits that theme entirely. 
---
Cursed image ü§Æ 
---
Do, done, node.
---
So they could say they had a game where ruin was never destroyed
---
I‚Äôm not saying that it never happened, I‚Äôm saying that the chances of finding a group of 4 people using BNP is rare. All I‚Äôm saying is that ebony Moris should be looked at. 
---
However, if you force someone to a killer that they have perks set up for, it WILL give you your perks. SO it can backfire if they give you your mains.
---
You know what, love child? You're right. I'll just start using my perk slots for perks that MAY be applicable to some gameplay instead of perks that could benefit me each game. Very insightful, thank you.
---
Enjoy applying NoEd. A perk that is not OP but certainly comes in handy every single game that you don't kill every survivor before the end. 
---
No.  You said that she had no counter, so I gave you one.  
---
You‚Äôre at low ranks, that‚Äôs the only time to expect a fun time coming from a rank 1 Freddy main
---
You try to  have fun and take it easy!?!? AND you're kind to your fellow man?!?!?! That's not how this works, dude, you're supposed to take all of your grotesque failures (like not being able to see everywhere at once, anyone can do it) and internalize them and eventually snap when an overworked hostess forgets your order of cheesy doodles and you and three people you found on Craigslist kill 1/4 of a person because of your angst! How is the entity going to take you and make you a killer if you're like, rational and chill about the gameplay???? /s
---
I like to swap out BBQ for Sloppy Butcher to slow healing. Hit em, use nc to find them and use m&amp;a to get a weird line of sight or angle on them to build that evil.  Down the survivor youre stalking then pop EW on the next bastard.
---
Cheeky
---
I don‚Äôt own that killer and i don‚Äôt think i will the only killers that are fun imo is spirit and Myers idk how anybody plays anybody else for fun but to each their own 
---
beat me to IT!
---
I always run 2 blocks, even at rank 1 I would use the yellow and brown block but it‚Äôs just enough time to get those pulls but still end up getting hate mail for ‚Äúbeing a try hard‚Äù. Lol it‚Äôs nice to see other Freddy mains to experience it 
---
I got booped the spirit and the experience was magical 
---
Did you really just say noed is effective every single game but then immediately negate yourself? Nice one. You also forgot to mention survivors cleansing all totems or even finding noed before it activates. And ruin or noed is in almost every single game. It'll come in handy almost every match. I bet you still ruin BT or adrenaline tho, even though you may not get use out of them every match.
---
Freddy is fun Bc you get to pull people off gens with his block add ons and spirit‚Äôs beads are fun to use as well, get end game messages of them explaining how they got the shit scared out of them
---
How dare you hit him on hook
---
I'm the one that runs in fear once I see the shimmer get close to me while screaming "fuck!" in my head as I run away from you.
---
I only do this when I have a chase challenge
---
What does this have to do with rank reset?
---
He‚Äôs just to weak for me to like and Myers is the perfect killer i think at least he can get looped but his perk allows him to insta down people and scratch mirror on Lary‚Äôs is just to fun

üôÑ I don‚Äôt sit 12 inches away from my tv not does my tv make my eyes burn. Plus I use my PS4 mainly for Netflix/Hulu etc. the PS4 was my ex‚Äôs but he never played it and I played dbd on it so he gave to me when I moved out so I also don‚Äôt see the need to buy or build a PC for one game
---
Woah, I still got a million of these on my characters. When was this changed?!
---
GenRush002
---
If you think that‚Äôs a counter you have to be kidding me LOL. Your basically saying the killer mistake is counter to the killer themselves. That‚Äôs like saying a nurse missing a blink is a counter to nurse 
---
I would pay good money for this 
---
You do realize, when she blinks the stain shows up where she will be right? So if you see it you can return move away at a left or right and avoid her completely.
---
Why not just get rid of rank entirely 
---
Beautiful
---
Rank 5 freddy main here, and i have got to say most people just have the wrong idea of how to play freddy properly. Hes meant to apply tons pressure throughout the match and is meant to shine during endgame, litteraly why his perks are ENDGAME PERKS.
---
I‚Äôve found the new challenge.....
---
NOED and dying light yikes 
---
Oh yeah, just dodge the nurses blink LOL 
---
And now you're just trolling. You don't want to know you're bad, so you say everything you can to ignore fact.
---
Or you could just run Small Game, no change needed.
---
Then I stop struggling right as she reaches me.
---
I think you meant to post this in r/deadbydaylightjokes
---
Killers get a sound and visual notification if you do "Rushed" actions which is when you do an action like entering/exiting a Locker or vaulting a window while holding the sprint button.
---
If you think the cap on items is 99 have I got bad news for you. :D :D :D
---
...if you just want 99 because you like the number then shine on, you crazy diamond.
---
Go ahead, not even mine originally. Came from a Zero Punctuation episode.
---
Then I slug one person and watch em bleed
---
Except that‚Äôs not a counter LOL a nurse missing a blink is not a counter to the killer. A good nurse doesn‚Äôt miss a blink in the first place
---
I mean you don't even need small game to know where totem spawns are. Also how is ruin a crutch when genrushing is a thing that makes matches last 4 minutes? 
---
Yea, but that means you have to HAVE Hangman's trick.
---
And if they are running actual Sabo, I think it still forces a 40 second hook timer from the Sabo's +30 second sabo duration.  Not sure though.  Because not only would I need to be running Hangman's Trick, but I'd have to be vs people using Sabo instead of just using charge amp'd boxes.
---
thank you so much! i just dont know how many terms there are and what they are.
---
I'm sure this has some truth, but they're the same people that are toxic when they're not in SWF. My 4-man is nothing but nice unless provoked by facecamping or toxicity in the lobby, and even then no one says anything hurtful, just things like telling them facecamping is a shitty way to get a kill and that they should get better for the rank they're playing at. Even willing to have civil conversations with killers in the lobby about it if they're willing to be civil too, but often they're not.
---
Only Toxic to the team. 
---
Why you gotta be so passive aggressive man, I thought it was a funny clip. Don't bring your negativity here.
---
Next week on "Jake and Friends".....
---
The issue is that after you break a hook, there is a 2 minute timer and it comes back up IIRC the number correctly.
---
So you have to break the hooks pretty much just before you go down, or it is rather worthless.
---
Small indie company
---
It is annoying when all you want to do is play with your friends but one didn't load into the game and the killer has a mori.
---
I get it all the time and I love it. I run the Z block with Unicorn Block because lesser dream transition is fantastic. 
---
Nah for the last 2 months all the major updates have been small bug fixes.
---
He hasn't even finished the main rival yet...
---
Genrushing isn't a real thing. Survivors doing gens fast is not some tactic. It's the game.
---
I got a 4k as pig, everyone died in the basement at the same time :)
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Lmfao now that is a funny joke
---
Yes his perks are endgame, but one is decent, one is situational, and one is literal trash. If you honestly think Freddy is better than clown or pig I think you have 1 too many chromosomes. 
---
That is actually because survivor hitboxes in windows are fucky.  Simply enough, the survivor isn't IN the window.  They are either pre-vault, or post-vault, on their hitbox.  As a result, Huntress can through her hatchet THROUGH someone as their hitbox transitions to the new state.
---
I get more angry at my teammates than I do the killers. 
---
‚ÄúSomeone come save me! No not now you dumbasses he‚Äôs right around the corner!!! DONT TOUCH ME...and I‚Äôm downed again...‚Äù
---
I get the "let's get this bread" meme, and Scott jund is a dbd youtuber, right.  Is that why?
---
I once had a survivor with an item at the hatch, and I had Franklin's Demise.  I was hoping they would accidently pick up the item instead, but it didn't work.  I still took their item, at least!
---
Nurse has counter play, most survivors just refuse to adapt to her though.
---
People want to call Nurse broken OP, but then go watch Noob3, Tru3, or Monto and they kite Nurses around like they're going against a Freddy. 
---
Nurse has to predict your movements to be effective, stop being predictable and you'll make her life a lot harder. Break LoS and stop dead in your tracks, most Nurses will try to track you through a wall, fake out a window vault, try to fake out the "run towards her" tactic.
---
Can you elaborate on the issue, Ive missed it somewhere.. you talking about the sound crap? Is there something else?
---
Or am I whooshed and you're talking about swf in general
---
Rule 1 for playing video game against other people:
---
They are probably children, or adults that are mentally children if they can't use logic. Ignore the stupidity, and move on. You can't win an argument against a dumb salty emotional wreck. 
---
Rule 2: if they aren't willing to just have manners and GG out, or even encourage others for doing well, they are not the people you need to care about.
---
GG, I am glad you play Freddy, and love playing against him. I'm sure you have great fundamentals to be able to handle him, and I love that. A solid, well rounded player, that will take a chance on a tougher challenge.
---
See you in the fog. 
---
Yeah when u hit em?
---
Yikes NOED, dying light, and an ebony mori at rank 12. Literally 3 forms of insta downs. No wonder everyone left. 
---
Do y‚Äôall think dedicated servers will fix this? And make some 360ing events easier? Cuz I swear I‚Äôm getting hit by shit that I‚Äôm on the other side of the killer of.
---
My wallet is waiting. Fixed sound and a new spirit outfit, I'm hyped.
---
Meh it also helps find Ruin and comes in handy if you ever run into a trapper or hag.
---
man i love myers.
---
The salt mine that is League will always be the most toxic thing around 
---
I'm starting to see killers really don't like anything that could make the game a challange for them.
---
Don't worry i get told im a noob and i suck and to kys. Even when i play a perfect game and kill all of them walking away with 40k to 70k bp. Survivors just expect to be allowed to win they seem to forget the killer is NOT on their team
---
Or just know which tiles Totems spawn in
---
They won't do that, sadly.  It's why Deathgarden uhh...died.  No progression, ranks or otherwise.  The should just make it so if you leave a match, there's no penalty to your rank.  So derankers get nothing at all for doing it, besides potentially a fat ban.
---
"It's not good enough to be a counter" ok, I'm really sensing the entitlement here. Small Game has a range of 12 meters, fyi, and you could also use Detective's Hunch or a map.
---
Survivors have incentives to stay semi-high, but killers def don't.
---
Survivors get better BP in high rank games.  Killers tunneling less, less camping, and better teammates meaning saves work better and more chances for your team to be decent enough to stall the game to last longer means more points.  At low ranks, your team is pretty much a coin flip on if they will play decently, or practically int themselves to the killer, or will just do the dumbest saves ever (like literally running up to the hook near the killer looking at them and unhooking the killer just grabbing their idiotic self off of you).  Survivor is def far more fun when your team isn't full of monkeys.
---
Genrushing isn't a thing, but gens do go too fast at high ranks. A group of survivors not completely stupid can knock out three gens in two minutes, easy
---
Ill met by moonlight. Like the Skyrim quest yes? :D I really like the idea 
---
This week I feel I finally mastered the Huntress. 5 games in a row, 4k. After the last game I got a message, and prepared for the salt. Instead, I get told "That was intense! You're crazy effecient. Everybody went down within 10 seconds of the chase starting. GG!"...  That made my day, since as a killer main I'm used to nothing but hate. üòÄ
---
Yep lol, this game was a lot more survivor sided back the 
---
Use that perk that tells you when two survivors are on a gen. 
---
XD I didn't realize that till now but  haha totally improves the Chapter XD 
---
This is why you don't teabag. That karma.
---
When my girl gives me light slaps it feels pretty good. 
---
Small game needs a TEENY buff. 12 meters is not that long honestly. 16 meters sounds better. That increase is how long a survivor goes running for 1 second, so not too long.
---
Only one Prove Thyself effect at a time.
---
Yea, back then, it was Nurse or bust pretty much once she came out.  She was the only killer who could actually contend with how insane looping was.
---
And Trapper could literally be turned into an M1 killer thanks to Sabotage.   He could have all traps sabo'd and lose his power entirely pretty much.
---
Have fun while they're changing totem spawn points with being able to place em better.
---
Thats just bias his perks are fine his only downside is the sleeptimer which can be reduced to 3.5 seconds at most times freddys not bad its just the killer plays them. Personally im trash with doctor nurse, and trapper, but will slug everbody with pig. Clown and freddy. So killer tiers dont matter just get good at the game and fond a playatyle thats comfortable instead of attaking people "freddy is garbage hurdurhurdur"
---
CURAZY DIAMUNDO
---
Im just hinting to genral problems that have a serious effect on the game like fps for example
---
Don't forget cheating, lagging and sluggin. My last match
---
Me: GG
---
SwF: I would say GG but you cheated and sucked
---
Me: How?
---
SwF: F\*\*\* you, We are reporting you.
---
Ran into this last night, saw 4 toolboxes and remembered montos video. Swapped nurses for hangman‚Äôs trick and hopped I made the right call 
---
I did. 
---
Dead hard + Hope
---
Noeds amazing i just started using it and i can see why survs hate it. Almost always get an extra kill from it. And very rarely do they cleanse all dull totems before it triggers
---
12m is not that far. You're better off running an Unusual Stamp and Red Twine on a Map.
---
I run Ruin, NOED and HG so I don't benefit much from a Small Game buff. 
---
Right now it's not good enough to warrant taking 1/4 slots.
---
I think 30m would be a bit much. The Spine Chill idea is good though.
---
Like I said.
---
Just wait for ruin, dying light's pretty meh. Usually comes into play too late to be of much use, unless you're running an endgame build, with something like remember me+NOED.
---
Ah, okay, so slight whoosh
---
I don't mind ds as a killer the fact its once per game makes it balanced. And very rarely has it saved someone they never get far
---
Pretty damn cool! 
---
Nope I‚Äôm pretty sure Fire Up is garbage. The numbers are way too low and it isn‚Äôt worth using. Blood warden is situational and Remember Me is decent. Anybody can be good with Freddy, but he‚Äôs still trash. He can‚Äôt even interact with the survivors until they are in the dream world and his power doesn‚Äôt help in the chase. Look at ANY tier list and I guarantee Freddy is at the bottom. 
---
Yes, that‚Äôs why a good nurse will predict where you will juke towards and blink accordingly. A good nurse knows the first blink is always to gain distance and the second is for the actual hit. That is why running in a different direction Is not going to help you in that situation. Once she closes the gap with the first blink you will have little or no room to juke the second blink. Nurse is all about prediction and if you can‚Äôt predict where survivors are going your just garbage with her. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúoh this exact movement will for sure make her miss the blink‚Äù it‚Äôs just luck and the nurses skill. If she‚Äôs bad, she will miss the blink. Experienced nurses will hardly miss any blinks, the blinks they do miss are caused by either false hit or a part of the map that is bugged for nurse. If you haven‚Äôt experienced that for yourself consider yourself lucky, good nurses are not fun to play against. Simply because you can‚Äôt do anything .
---
Get it the heck away from me
---
Maybe the new highschool game that you can see on Discord could put up a fight for DBD, but yea, currently DBD is sitting as "king" on the throne of asymmetrical horror type games.  Even if it has practically zero scare left in it.  Can get the adrenaline pumping pretty good though especially after a long break from the game.
---
I don't understand why they even reset the rank. All it does is exactly this; put more experienced players against less experienced ones. Like why? And then they are saying they want to make the game less toxic (i.e. less frustrating)? Give me a break.
---
I like to stick with BBQ, enduring, spirit fury, and ruin, but monitor and abuse is a great sub for either BBQ or spirit fury.
---
What are you, a Twitch streamer?  
---
Nope, just some random who plays games for fun, and when the Legion is involved, I don't have fun.
---
What would Legion be listening to then? Toto - Africa?
---
The PTB's Prove Thyself is "bugged" right now... Well at least a mechanic that's been in the game for a long time is. Oh and they're gunna be fixing Toolboxes and Prove Thyself, those are bugged too.
---
...right, time to dust off hangman's trick
---
@ u/72hrsdbd
---
Who cares?
---
I mostly play for the chase. Every once in a while you just have really solid, enjoyable chases, with survivors who aren't toxic, and it's nice to see who can come out on top.
---
You do enough to comment, thank you for the support &lt;3
---
What do you want survivors to do, run at you and feed you hooks? No, they're gunna do gens and get the fuck out. Does that mean it isn't a problem? No. Gens are done too quick but "Genrush" is a stupid term.
---
Upvoted for BHVR smackdown.
---
Uh, cool?
---
A counter is something that can work 100% of the time. A guaranteed way to avoid something. What you described is not a counter. A spirit messing up her phase walk and a nurse messing up a blink is not the survivor ‚Äúcountering‚Äù the killer. The killer made a mistake in gameplay and therefore missed the hit. That‚Äôs not a counter. 
---
Yes, you can counter play a bad nurse. Noob3 and the others aren't always going against good killers.
---
A good nurse has little to no counter play. Her ability allows her to ignore pallets and windows. Sure, youcan try to fake her out and it may work a while but there's no way to escape a good nurse. 
---
There's times where it is amusing to see how bad some players are but when you have to work for a kill then you feel so much better about yourself for each kill you EARN. But that is just me, 
---
 
---
I'm sure there's killers out there that just want to win and don't care how they do it 
---
Shame they don't do a quick fix on discordance
---
Just reverse the numbers, Not leveling the perk is better than leveling it since you get information faster
---
I've gone against an extremely laggy Nurse on console, does that count?  Also, i've heard that running strait towards her when she's blinking might cause her to miss, since they won't expect it.  
---
Go for BBQ AND the Mori. Knock 'em dead.
---
Oh wow I thought it was actually based on the quest since werewolf theme and all ^_^  why only 105% speed?
---
How do you get that Jake head cosmetic?
---
Ok it‚Äôs cute and all but I‚Äôm surprised the pigs didn‚Äôt kill Amanda for decapataing a pig and wearing its head(sry for bad grammar)
---
I think the real answer is to balance the poorly balanced perks to start with, instead of buffing the rather situational counter perk. Additionally, I don't really think Ruin is a crutch, it's more of a must-have. Games are just over too quickly without it.
---
Nope! Just ruining the game for killers who ruin the game.
---
 Because whoever put this little meme together made it that way?  That's not how it looks in the movie if that's what you are thinking. 
---
new claudette buff: after doing the last gen as claudette, you disappear to nothing after the gen is popped.
---
Haha, that was funny!
---
Enduring+Spirit Fury
---
Because listening for survivors is hard btw. Counters are supposed to work 100% of the time otherwise it wouldn‚Äôt be a counter LOL. A counter isn‚Äôt supposed to be fair. A counter is an outplay, you outplayed your opponent, you win. There‚Äôs no, ‚Äúokay you outplayed your opponent but there‚Äôs only going to be a chance that it worked‚Äù. No. Your either outplay him or you don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs how games work. There‚Äôs no maybe about it. Otherwise what‚Äôs the point of even trying to outplay someone lol. Pallets and windows are an example of a counter to an average killer like billy or wraith. You outplay them at the pallet or window, you don‚Äôt get hit. There‚Äôs no maybe. Unless it‚Äôs some bullshit hit through the window. But those are not supposed to happen. You either get the pallet drop or the fast vault, or you don‚Äôt. There is no ‚Äúbut maybe..‚Äù. It‚Äôs a fact
---
1. Im afraid of freddys rework because i know that they will somehow fuck up and make him worse (honestly think the same about dedicated servers)
---
2. Hes my secondary main and i have to say that hes actually decent and devastating even with no addons. His power was made to stall the game, not chase and thats why people come up with the overused ‚Äú7 seconds‚Äù argument
---
MICHAEL! WHAT THE HELL!? Stop eating the piglet!
---
Body and sai, I'll use but I'll probably stick with the bun.  Default hair looks cheesy af.
---
I was memeing. 
---
‚ÄúThis is so sad,‚Äù Alex play despacito
---
I was hoping someone would finish my sentence. ‚Äò‚ÄòTwas a joke bud.
---
But that just slows me down and headed to T wall loop town lol 
---
I suspect it only exists by this point for the sake of having Rank 1 people actually have fun games, since they still dont have any rewards for Rank 1, and its a exercise in tedium as the killer, and basically just meta slaving as the survivor. So they keep frequent reset to kick down those people from rank 1.
---
Either A: be a respectable human and realize that it‚Äôs game and you lose some 
---
Or B: go full tunnel on the nearest Claudette and mori them out of existence 
---
i think they will fuck up him with his rework to be honest 
---
It doesn't matter. It's just relaxing to play as killer. If there is a competitive game, it's certainly fun to try. It's fun to me, and usually if you don't 4k, you 3k with a hatch survivor. 
---
Oh god! It's contagious!
---
This week I only had to force quit the game 20 times on PC due to random hangs that never occurred until this patch. That's better than last week!
---
As a Legion main, you realize I still get my bloodpoints and my pip, purely because I farm the remaining survivors. If one DC‚Äôs, another is bound to also DC from the tilt. I kill one and farm the hell out of the last one. 
---
So if anything, you‚Äôre ruining it for the other survivors. 
---
I guess at the point i'm at rn i'd like my ass to get steamrolled by 4 guys tbh.
---
legion. if he wants you dead he will stab you until you are on the ground and you cant do anything about it
---
Nice?
---
It's not even slim. It's just not going to happen. The closest I have seen on PS4 is two no mithers.
---
maybe he just likes spirit's bumcheeks
---
With t walls, loop on the inside. Don't give them the inside. That gives them two windows to work with. When you go inside, they can only use one, and if you loop the right way, you can either catch them at the window because it won't be a fast vault, or catch them after they vault. I think just playing more like how I just explained would help you improve, and you're not gonna be good at it the next game you have, but you'll find out how it works. Watch some good streamers, too, but especially avoid bad killer streamers. I'd say watch ScottJund, Zubat, and there are others too.
---
Ouch, the fact you just said there is no way to cancel your blink proves you know nothing about nurses gameplay. Sure you cannot cancel a blink, but blinking at the ground has the same effect, you will blink in place. And now the survivor looks like an idiot because he literally just ran right into your arms.
---
I‚Äôm not against him, I love Freddy to death, however he‚Äôs still the worst killer. And that tournament your talking about was a CONSOLE tournament. Fire up could be a good perk, but it‚Äôs numbers are too low. 
---
?
---
So what are the survivor mains complaining about? This entire post is about buffing a survivor perk in order to nerf killer crutches.
---
&gt;So we're going to casually ignore the good nurses they do go against?
---
I didn't ignore them. I was saying that if they are able to loop a nurse for a long time its because it is a bad nurse.
---
&gt; So stop using pallets and windows, exactly what I was saying about adapting, she ignores pallets and windows, so stop relying on pallets and windows. 
---
Yes, but there are only so many ways to juke against a nurse. Eventually, she is going to catch up to you. Pallets and windows are how you get distance from a killer in DBD, and nurse ignores them.
---
&gt; At the end of the day, Nurse is pure Killer skill vs Survivor skill. 
---
I agree that a good survivor can prolong their death when going against nurse, but not forever. Remember, this conversation was about a very high skill nurse. She's considered the best killer in the game for a reason.
---
i hope they dont rework him because i feel like they will make him even worse
---
INSTANT CLASSIC MEME VERY FUNNY
---
I know. Pig worse than Freddy? And CLOWN worse than Freddy? These people are giving me aneurisms.
---
Don‚Äôt complain about ds if you don‚Äôt wanna run enduring
---
-Playing in Europe 
---
- find a Lobby in about 5 to 7 minutes Every time 
---
Yea if one of I‚Äôm buds doesn‚Äôt make it in the actual game I‚Äôm usually going to dip too. If they get face camped or killed within the first 5 seconds we will stay though.
---
to not use clown
---
Might be yes, I know it's when I'm chasing so might have hit them.
---
Devs already confirmed that the reports *do in fact* go straight to the trash, or an equivalent scenario where they are not getting attention. They did ask we direct the complaints and reports to an appropriate channel. I am too lazy to link it. 
---
With dedicated servers, we might not even need reports for most things.
---
Dude same. Idk how he‚Äôs rank 5 and thinks Freddy is better than Pig and Clown. Clowns power is probably one of the best, and he‚Äôs the 4th best killer flip flopping with the Huntress. Pig isn‚Äôt too great but she‚Äôs not bad. Her RBT‚Äôs are great time wasters. 
---
I‚Äôm the immersed Claudette üòÇ. I have a P3 on her and I can‚Äôt wait to get some flashlights...
---
Thank you . I‚Äôm just finding myself at a loss with these really good survivors and I‚Äôve tried all the killers and i can‚Äôt seem to do well with any but pig and doctor (minus the loops ) . I thought spirit would be good for them but I completely suck with that girl lol 
---
Blame the devs like the other commenter said.
---
This shit made my day lmaoooo
---
Huh, never knew. Seems like they did a *pretty good job*.
---
find me on steam same username: mistar_z
---
There is a Claudette there
---
My friend just grabbed my phone and said they were surprised because the girl in the top-left looks like their friend.  I said, "Not all Asians look alike!"  The obvious joke being that they are also Asian.
---
No and honestly i see arguments for why it should and shouldn't but if you need good tracking on a dw surv use stridor or bloodhound
---
I‚Äôm not, why would I do anything that isn‚Äôt fun for me?
---
And how long does a game like that take? It's not rushing at all. Your bias is getting in the way of facts. 
---
I'm not the one who made this post and nobody brought up DS but you, so...‚Ä¶.
---
Except the only ones with their game ruined are the other Survivors. Because you're a baby.
---
At least 70% of killers use Ruin, myself included. Let's not act like it's in line with the other perks and doesn't severely slow the game down.
---
If you use dying light use an ivory or tombstone and tunnel the obsession (its scummy but its kinda the way to quickly get benefit from it)
---
You seem to be throwing a fit, idk how I ruined their game, they still get to be tunneled to oblivion by a broken mechanic.
---
3 people need to bring it for that to work. And even then moris still are cheesier to use.
---
Ok... it‚Äôs been far too long. I need to know...what does P3 mean?
---
It sounds like we just aren't going to agree. Thanks for the discussion. 
---
How to get red ranks as a noob: 
---
Equip Premonition + Urban Evasion. 
---
I figured nurses would be good on pig cuz of sneaking up on healing people . I‚Äôm scared to not use ruin lol what about brutal strength ?
---
They're some nice bumcheeks ü§î
---
A good counter to this is hangmans trick
---
It's just the most used killer perk because we want survivors to get the points from destroying it.
---
Be real, we use it to slow the game down a ton. 
---
So basically everything xd
---
Whispers is too hit and miss because how far the range is . A survivor could be anywhere 
---
I wold hate to live in a world where the ENDBOSS is as scary as every other encounter. 
---
That highly skilled, highly trained, well equipped Nurse is the ENDBOSS. In final fantasy you can select run, but it won't let. You. In DbD you can leave the match. Make your choice. 
---
If you don't think that you deserve to run into a GOD nurse once in a while, then you are a true survivor main in all the worst ways. I am sure you get some hella easy wins sometimes, and some good matchups where you win and lose based upon mistakes and skill, but you shouldn't be able to beat someone that is bringing the HOUSE on you.
---
Same goes for those Huntress masters, and Drift kings. Embrace that challenge. Use it to get better. 
---
My advice is to derank and wait for a free weekend. I got it my first try on a bunch of 3 hour free weekend players
---
Ornacia totems LIVING IT FOR IT!
---
I thought I was genius with some of the builds I thought of. Then I noticed Monto had a video for all of them lol. I have no original ideas
---
In my case, it is always a Meg.
---
I like to use 2 green add-ons. One increases intoxicated duration, one gives an extra hindered penalty. This really slows them down.
---
Other good ones are...
---
- anti-exhaustion add-on.
---
- reload speed
---
Those are the ones I commonly use. The purple  and instadowns are good too but obviously you dont tend to have as many of them.
---
It all depends on your strategy.
---
Calling ruin a crutch and saying that everyone who disagrees with the survivor main ideals presented here is a killer main, that shows that you have a bias for survivor mains. 
---
Also it has nothing to do with having different opinions. I am stating the facts and using logic, if you feel that I am bashing on you or starting a fight with you then maybe you shouldn't be on the internet. 
---
Oink
---
Now just safety pip. 
---
They tea bagged me while I was on hook Bc I wasn‚Äôt in their SWF group, lol
---
Shame that all the toxic cunts seem to have moved onto Feng now as well. Normally its just claudetts, nea and quentin.
---
Even though I'm colorblind and can't see red scratches, sometimes in a corn chase, I have better luck looking straight down at the ground for the yellow scratches than trying to maintain visual on the survivor. (On console)
---
The piglet playing with one of Spirit‚Äôs body part is  hilariously cute.
---
Ok first of all, let me answer the questions
---
Your comment stated totems should be harder to find, implying a buff, I don‚Äôt think survivors should spawn near it, and I think it needs a change. It needs to be less hidden in maps like lerys and swamp, and more hidden in cold wind or autohaven maps. Also, exhaustion perks are not required on survivor, when I play survivor I often run no exhaustion perks to free up an extra slot. No one always hits great skillchecks, even the most seasoned DBD players, and the fact that you think great skillchecks are a hard counter to ruin makes me think you don‚Äôt play much survivor at all. Having ruin forces players who aren‚Äôt skillcheck gods to get off the gens and look for the totem, and if on an undesirable map, this could take an insanely long time. There is a reason it is one of the most used killer perks in the game. 
---
Russian roulette with pig (haunted grounds, ruin, devour hope, thrill of the hunt) with combat straps and rule set 2
---
I've cock blocked NOED handfuls of times. I actually HAVE ran Small Game. I just find almost every other perk more useful.
---
Show me the facts. Show me the numbers that you found in your loads of research and testing online.
---
Nurses can definitely be good for that. It's a good perk. With Pig if you wanna use Nurses, I would say: BBQ, Hex; Ruin 3, Sloppy Butcher, Nurses Calling.
---
I know it can be scary to not use ruin, but ruin 1 only affects two people. And let's say you're chasing somebody that is affected by it, that means you still have two people doing gens fast, and then one other person either doing a gen slowly or looking for the totem. It's honestly better to wait for Ruin 3, or ruin 2 at least.
---
Brutal Strength is too weak to take up a perk slot. It's not as good as BBQ, Nurses, Sloppy Butcher, Ruin 3, Enduring+Sprit Fury, Whispers, NOED of course. All those perks are pretty good at the very least, and are the 'meta' perks. If you try those, and don't respect pallets, you will get way more hooks.

Oh boy

As mentioned, I'm a beginning artist xD  
---
The face didn't turn out as I would have liked it, but anyway I've learned from it for future illustrations
---
Then run those perks, but don't complain about NOED then. Give up a perk slot or take the risk, one of the two.
---
Whispers is an amazing perk. It's one of the best perks. You just have to learn to use it correctly, which honestly doesn't take too much time. 
---
You don't waste any time at the beginning of the game looking for a survivor. And if in the middle of the game you can't find anyone, whispers tells you exactly what area the survs are at. And plus, it let's you know where the last survivor is, therefore, not wasting much time finding the last one. It's a huge time saver and definitely the best perk to find survs, other than BBQ I guess.
---
T h a n k s 
---
You got a link to that one?
---
Eon, Doe, One, and Nod for extra words too.
---
1 perk slot out of the 12 Survivors have access to total to counter out 2 high value meta perks the killers have.  It isn't that bad of a deal.
---
Only takes one small game user wandering around in the early-mid game to knock out most of the totems.
---
yeah makes them worth a darn
---
Imo the only "Bad" addons are the ones that increase speed while reloading and the ones that increase the duration the tonic lasts for
---
Thing is, I‚Äôm not the one complaining about NOED. While the perk is annoying, it takes 80 seconds to do all 5 totems, just fucking do em.
---
Small Game is just... shit.
---
pretty cool
---
yes, they have
---
Sabo squad on the case! Taking down hooks like there‚Äôs no tomorrow!
---
Ebony Mori with BBQ, Ruin, Noed, and Dying Light, and with Michael at rank 12. Yeah, wonder why they disconnected. They missed out on all that FUN.
---
Self care is nearly worthless at this point 
---
I tend to have pretty bad luck with it, get 3 or 4 totems but always miss one or get chased before i can clean them all out.
---
Nah fam we all know Myers is a furry
---
What do you mean not respect pallet ?
---
no one of these supports ochido 
---
and ochido is a toxic cunt who is god awful at the game btw
---
Speaking of.. about that 're2 remake!
---
Literally who? Closest thing I remember is tydetime saying he'll play it over dbd... And either way, still a toxic post
---
Do you know what perks are good for hillbilly by chance as well ?
---
Duration increase with exhaustion
---
Not just huntress. Every killer seems to hit me with a magic extra lunge boost even when I dodge or 360 them. Maybe the devs are making the survivors‚Äô hit box larger and not saying anything.
---
What ‚Äúsurvivor main ideals‚Äù? You call a buff to a currently useless perk (small game) to be survivor main ideals?
---
Also you are not stating facts, because nothing you have said so far was factual. You are just telling from experience or making up facts to make yourself seem right. Also your ‚Äúlogic‚Äù is not necessarily common sense, and may not line up with other people‚Äôs‚Äô logic
---
I‚Äôve had it before and the range is so far wide even at tier 3 to know where exactly they are . I dunno , I just never had luck . I walk and hear the noise and look all over and never find anyone 
---
I absolutely despise going against the Spirit. Her lack of animations for her power and vaulting make her nearly impossible to read (at least for me) and when I actually escape from her its due to dumb luck and not skill.
---
I also really hate when killers have add-ons that trigger exhaustion, especially when their power is pretty easy to guarantee (like the clown's gas). I personally think add-on triggered exhaustion should act like old exhaustion, where it recovers while you are running.
---
You're right! Ruin is such a bi- **boom**
---
That means to not back away from a pallet when a survivor is next to it. Respecting a pallet means that you don't want to get hit by it, so you back off. Not respecting a pallet means that you just walk right through, and you don't think about whether or not they will drop the pallet. 
---
You should NOT respect pallets. Just walk right through. Even if you get pallet stunned a 100 times, just keep chasing. And break the pallet as soon as it's dropped in front of you.
---
Jesus Christ you sound so entitled
---
Not my post. I literally didn't.
---
Yeah
---
0w0
---
It just means your a consistent player and guessimg from your post i guess your not
---
I mean, slugging people with no mither is literally what they want, you can get yourself up an insane number of times with it. No one has to save their friend off the ground, and eventually gens will just get done.
---
It's not required lmfao. It's recommended. So you're telling me that I can't play at purple and red ranks unless I equip ruin? Please learn the definition of required. 
---
Um it's literally the reason why rank 1 killers run ruin. Without ruin great skill checks actually increase gen speed???
---
r/dbdgonewild maybe
---
Another Way Out by Hollywood Undead is a pretty good Legion song, especially since Legion looks like an HU fan anyways...
---
Fuckin dead hard
---
Again....not my post.
---
Tbh you‚Äôre doing the exact same thing. I can‚Äôt disprove any facts cause you aren‚Äôt giving any in the first place. Facts are numbers, statistics, tests, experiments people have done about a subject, not just some random person‚Äôs opinion.
---
R/unexpectedJayandSilentBob
---
NOED is just a crutch for bad killers. Prove me wrong. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm her c: Hiya~
---
How is it an excuse? You can‚Äôt tell me I don‚Äôt love Freddy. I do love him, that‚Äôs why I made the post in the first place you fucking egg 
---
I'm polite and congratulate them.
---
If they're toxic I start trolling them with weird shit, like asking if they have soft skin, if they smell nice, etc.
---
The number of toxic players who get tilted off of simple, basically harmless trolling like that is pretty hilarious.
---
Overall, remember that they're trying to upset you about something completely fucking stupid. The kind of person who has the uniquely hilarious combination of personality traits that causes them to both care deeply about being perceived as being super good at a poorly balanced asymmetrical video game AND try to rub it in the face of the person that they beat, especially in what they clearly intend to be a hurtful way, is the last sort of person who should be making anyone feel inferior about anything, tbh.
---
TL;DR "weird flex but ok"
---
How quaint. 
---
It looks so masculine and muscular! You can tell he gets a good workout from running up and down them basement stairs!
---
I‚Äôm not quite sure I understand what you mean?
---
Literally look up the speed at which gens can be completed. All you have to do is use google.
---
Also considering that 3 gens can be done in 2 minutes that speaks for itself.
---
So once again you cannot provide facts to back up your argument and cannot provide facts to disprove my valid argument. I am done replying to you if all You're gonna do is be a troll like that. 
---
You're not wrong, but pointing out something from the other side isnt an argument 
---
ye. he eats animals raw, according to Loomis in the first movie.
---
Thank you kindly! C: I love making masks and hope to improve even more in the future eventually~üíï
---
I literally had someone tell me i patrolling not even camping was frowned on by reddit so i should kill myself for doing it
---
/r/unexpectedJayandSilentBob 
---
Omfg. I said there were people (not me) posting on this sub about how ruin is required. Not me. I did not say ruin is required. I just said that there were many killer mains and killer players who think it is difficult to win at high ranks without ruin.
---
I‚Äôm in on ds removal if noed goes too, and for DC, make consecutive DC make the timer take longer or something along those lines
---
Lmfao. "I can't disprove your facts because I don't accept them to be facts".
---
So in other words you cannot disprove my facts because they are true. Get out of here you dumb troll. 
---
So is this how mafia works?
---
Well I'm The Legion(Joey)/John Kramer(Billy the Puppet)
---
Legions Joey outfit is god tier 
---
Should be 72hrs instead of Ochido though...
---
I kinda like something calm like Africa though. Would make the chases enjoyable..
---
*Muffled music*
---
"I bless the rains down in Africa"
---
Ahh.. Bliss.
---
What is your valid argument again?
---
Yes but while they are on the ground they are also bleeding out.  they can get away a number of times but each time they are downed they have to fully recover allowing them to bleed out more.  And even if that‚Äôs what they want most of the time that‚Äôs all you can do. If they are dedicated to the sabo they won‚Äôt get gens done. They will be too worried about making sure you don‚Äôt get a hook to care about gens. Now if you start only slugging they might change there minds, and that‚Äôs when you can take advantage. They won‚Äôt be there for hooks anymore so just start hooking. Then they will realize that either they do gens and get out (ignoring doing sabo for the most part) or they bleed out. 
---
Freddy, Legion, Hag.
---
I didn‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt accept them as facts. I said that by the scientific and globally accepted standard, you did not provide any facts.
---
C'mon man it's 2019
---
The Hag, duh!
---
She looks like a demonic plant and I‚Äôm perfectly fine with it.
---
Yeah, that's two different Trapper bois pressing the Jump button! :D
---
Tell me about it.
---
Nothing bad with it
---
He's such a good person:)
---
The thing is, I actually watch Monto, No0b, and True (rarely albeit). ***don't know guy on the far right***...
---
But Ochido is a different can of worms that I am not opening.
---
That new delayed pallet drop skill seems pretty good
---
If they don't use a coin, there will not be enough medkits for all 3 and one Quentin must be exiled.
---
Your submission to r/deadbydaylight has been removed for the following reason:
---
Shaming other players.
---
Censor all usernames for posts and screenshots or video featuring other players in a negative light, and no calls to action against another player.
---
The spirit of past survivors decided to help you escape so you dont end up like them. Roaming the fields for all eternity 
---
Also No Mither should mean you just ignore hits because you dont care and this is not happening makes the game instantly end
---
Indeed
---
If you feel like tunneling one survivor sure, but a good group will just loop you and let them get to stage 2 while they complete gens, then it‚Äôs useless. 
---
&gt; we're not flagging people as solo or groups. 
---
Not sure if that was common knowledge already, but what the fuck.
---
I mean, just looking at the matchmaking you can get this was obvious I guess but  I am still surprised.
---
***Why I don't run self care!***
---
Hatch is so the last survivor stands any semblance of a chance to escape. There's no way for the last person to do 3 gens and a gate by themselves. Should it be an instantaneous escape? Eh. Does it need to be in the game? Yes.
---
Then he would have made a post saying thank God for ranked resets because new killer didn't know he could grab me
---
It would make sense or fit in with the Legion, but sure, whatever. Meme powers activate.
---
Not like BHVR will put anything like this in anyways.
---
b-but its too hard to find 5 totems :(
---
In what world would that be a bannable offense lmao. The Nea was a dick, you were 100% in the right.
---
Thank you for your efforts. I played a small handful of games today &amp; one has a leatherface who knocked someone down in about 30-40 seconds &amp; facecamped them to death. We had no gennies complete nor had anyone been noticeably rude. 
---
Then, I eventually got caught after 2 gennies were complete &amp; he facecamped me to death. Everyone had drastically less points than normal (especially LF) &amp; the whole match was disappointing, annoying, &amp; a waste of time. It wasn‚Äôt a competition. It was stale, broke n, &amp; unproductive. It hinders everyone BPs &amp; pees on everyone‚Äôs game. 
---
I thought the doctor can see snapping out of it with nurse is coming
---
This meme always makes me chuckle no matter how old or dumb it is
---
could, not anymore with the legion update.
---
I‚Äôm fairly new to the game, I think people can tell as in the in game chat I‚Äôm getting a ton of advice on how to play better!
---
It‚Äôs their busted matchmaking. SWF makes it all wonky. When me and my two buds play it generally takes anywhere from 5 mins if we‚Äôre lucky to 20 mins for a match. On PS4 830-11 EST. I really wish they‚Äôd fix it but ya know 
---
As a wraith main this would be hilarious i regularly wipe teams and with that sort of boost i would be unstoppable :) 
---
You pretty much mash and hope someone gets you
---
Mashing kills me quicker tho unless I'm not mashing right
---
Omg, the new adrenaline seems op
---
I KNEW SHE HAD A CLOAKING DEVICE, THE BITCH. 
---
This is... I just... Thank you so much
---
only 36 more bloodwebs to go
---
Autodidact + Stake Out 
---
No Mither/Resilience/This Is Not Happening/Iron Will
---
Faster vault probably
---
its a bug and can happen to any killer(i think) and any map. its been there for a while and i met it once a few months ago
---
Those asshole/idiots deserve to get killed such disrespectful cunts
---
PC only,  I believe. It's okay of the L4D costume DLC.
---
Sometimes I accidentally dropped a pallet instead of using self care or vice versa
---
I‚Äôm so glad they‚Äôre fixing this bug in 2.5.0
---
The one on the left is a female twitch streamer called Jendeneise
---
Myers doesn‚Äôt need noed, op is just a noob killer 
---
ah yes, the lore where wraith smashes someone with a fucking hammer. loved that bit.
---
I barely see a killer use blood trails to find survivors unless bloodhound 
---
Regardless. That blood trail was impossible to miss. 
---
Oh shit really? Wow that is fast af
---
Numerous people said people were going to drop DBD for it when it had its beta/alpha.  I don't need to name specific individuals.
---
It's not toxic.  It's shade, but there's nothing toxic whatsoever about it.
---
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahhahhaahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahabahabahahahahahahahh i get it 
---
Just because you haven't heard it doesn't mean it didn't happen.
---
Nope. The devs put out a list a while ago as to what actions aren't reportable and both of those actions are on the list.
---
the exhaustion addon makes me wanna fucking die.
---
time to play clown.
---
My first thought was Pokemon egg but if Nintendo hired Clive Barker.
---
Lemme just grab the field guide real quick...
---
Yeah totally 
---
Then when did it happen? Please tell me. I actively browse this sub and actively browesed dg sub and never saw it. Please, link me to some stuff
---
I didn't know mordecai from borderlands was in the game
---
Was playing a game yesterday where the Killer didn't show up for 4 gens. Was confused and wandered into the basement to find a Hag with traps laid all around the chest. I tried to open it and she hooked me.
---
At the end she said "don't touch granma's chest"
---
I think just to make the perk really whack, it would be a 1 token, there is a 20% chance for an inaudible skillcheck, then 40%, 60%, 80%, then 100%.
---
I would buy any Silent Hill related DLC for this game so fast.
---
oh that‚Äôs... that‚Äôs jen.
---
ew.
---
Freddy, with purple addons will always beat me. 
---
People said they were gonna drop dbd, not that it was gonna be killed, exaxtly. Thanks for proving my point. And throwing a game's failure in the devs face is extremely toxic lol. They check this sub daily and will see this.
---
You can't check recently played when you're the killer I've tried. I've also tried searching their names and steam yields 123k results
---
Slugging is a tactic, so is camping and tunneling. It's just that Camping and tunneling are more of a cheap tactic.  
---
Slugging isn't bad, if you can down a survivor long enough to down another survivor then they are just bad at saving people. Unless you just keep on camping the slugged people ofc.  
---
Imo if you keep em on the ground, it would be boring to wait until they all died. might as well hook one or two amirite?
---
Yea except every game isn‚Äôt legion lol
---
I don't think it was this sub per say. Id say it would be a mix of Twitch streamers and steam forums.
---
PS4 quick menu or PS4 app, maybe?
---
Jake,Dwight,Billy Boi and Wraith
---
But for licensed characters or overall Quentin 
---
that would go so well with unnerving presence 
---
Ummm that‚Äôs a butt0n, n0t a mixtape 
---
I think he means Unnerving Presence countering Decisive Strike.
---
Losing this game feels worse than losing.  There are games where I get a pip but I still feel like shit.
---
If they nod back then you know they‚Äôre cool.
---
I‚Äôm gonna send this to everyone in my contacts list. 
---
Was playing after the reset and a killer started griping about how we had good perks even though 3 of us did not have full rank 3 perks and the killer literally had rank 3 on every perk he had and was using p3, dear stalker.P3 bbq.P3. whispers and p3 Noed and an ebony mori. When the match was over he called us rank resetting Assholes 
---
&gt;You seem to be throwing a fit
---
you made a thread specifically to bitch about how you give killers free wins + extra points lol
---
They could report you, sure, but nothing would happen.
---
This is a shitpost . 
---
I labeled the thread correctly
---
Your suggestion for DS already exists, it‚Äôs Kate‚Äôs Boil Over perk.
---
My favorite  addon is the one that gives the hindered effect, pair it with any other you want 
---
It's not hitboxes, it's just the connection because of the state the game is in but I guess I understand because of how fast the hatches fly it can cause a bigger problem then just hit registration by regular melee
---
In a three-or-less-survivors scenario, slugging can be insanely powerful.
---
Your using that as an excuse to your personal inefficiencies with a killer as most do. so youd rather take a buff than learn to make better decisions as a killer about what to do play smart instead of whining about the bad things.
---
Yeah, the time efficiency on that doesn't work too well honestly, getting up from dying only takes about 30 seconds, and they have 4 minutes on the ground, which is about 7 revives. You have to remember there are 4 of them, so unless you can end every chase in like 20 seconds, they'll likely have no problem pushing all gens and saboing every hook(it's not like they have to constantly break them, they only have to if you're carrying someone to hook, so if you slug, they'll literally never have to spend more time saboing hooks). It's not an unbeatable strategy, but it's definitely not as easy to counter as you think.
---
As a Kate, people are always surprised that I do run ds... 
---
I'm Kate so I must be nice ?
---
And so what tier list are just flipped on consoles or...
---
This is so accurate but Quen doesn't deserve shit he is a nice good sleepy boi 
---
That's a solid, 100%, certified Yikes^^TM
---
dead rabbits are better
---
Then why do the best killer mains in the world say it needs a buff? Watch Bricky‚Äôs casefile on Freddy and then come back :)
---
Yes
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna pretend I didn‚Äôt see that‚Äù.
---
It‚Äôs a shame she sacrifices everyone without at least taking a nibble for herself
---
This is the notification I got. It's just a bot. It isn't the smartest either.
---
https://imgur.com/a/CbGdtyV
---
Sounds about right, I never had a game with no mithers but I‚Äôve had plenty of 4 man sabos so that‚Äôs the strategy i do without no mither and it works almost every time, at least as billy. I said I was unsure about no mither in my original post tho. Just was making guesses in my head lol
---
*Fookin dead 'ard
---
i love to see a fellow pig!
---
You usually don't know that it will be Sabosquad just by the lobby. 4 toolboxes can indicate that as much as it could indicate 4x BNP
---
The sound of this is hilarious
---
I play as crap against any freddy, he is not the worst killer for me :( Also OP you can disable receiving messages from strangers on the PSN you can save yourself the annoyance this way.
---
1. Middle girl  
---
2. Hag
---
dc on purpose ruins the game more that a person picking a killer
---
We got a badass here
---
Damn faithless liberals
---
Nice. 
---
I think he is referring to the Flash of Bleach, which **considerably** increases the Hindered severity 
---
Maybe we can give the money to someone else? I've heard that Michael doesn't belong to the guy that the money from the Halloween DLC went to. 
---
Had the same thing happen to me vs a pig, we just did the gens and all escaped lol
---
Well for as far as BNP can get you, that is...
---
I really hope they add ghostface
---
Ah, must not have seen you mentioning no mither then. You're welcome for the math lol, have a good night :)
---
R/antifurry go here to escape these horrible creatures 
---
It would be kinda weird in maps like Larry's or The Gideon meat plant
---
Hes YOUR worst killer just like people have their favorites and are better than with others. If you have to jump on the tier list bandwagon just to make yourself feel better after a bad game is all up to you
---
Isn‚Äôt it obvious that the killer might have haunted grounds if there‚Äôs more than one hex totem on the field though? You use one, they think it‚Äôs ruin or hunters
---
Amazing vid, gave me a good chuckle.
---
while I don't think it *is* a crutch, it is most certainly *treated* as one, particularly by bad players/sore losers. A lot of folks, (on both sides) seem to forget that the hatch is a *consolation prize*, meaning your team didn't do so poorly that there's no way to escape for anyone. 
---
It's why I kind of take particular offense when someone tries to post-game trash talk because they landed the hatch, it's a participation award, not a win. (Unless they managed to get multiple escapes with a key, then it's just they won/tied/whatevs.
---
You did it. You gave him his hope back.
---
He doesn‚Äôt have to be a Killer anymore.
---
So do ranks matter or not beacuse if they didnt them balancing for higher ranks would do nothing since it isnt a refrence to skill in your opinion.
---
Yes that‚Äôs what I meant 
---
Because they don't like the killer gambling on that decision, and making them spend up to minutes at a time on the floor. Plus, slugged people tend to DC to give the last survivor the hatch, because how dare the killer make a powerful and game-changing decision.
---
Lol, I mean there are plenty of swf groups that are on the level of noob and zubat. Hey just aren't streamers man. Either way the discussion is about if all are god Loopers which killer stands a chance and it's only nurse. Maybe spirit
---
How does she play?
---
Xbox or PS4? Because I recently started on PS and I see a fair number of Legions about. Nowhere near as many as the base killers, but on par with the rest of the DLC.
---
Ha hilarious. Good teamwork surviving this monster eh? 
---
Absolutely! Want to add me on psn? 
---
Me everytime I get a reverse bear trap and get slugged at the exit gate. "Welp might as well keep crawling"
---
Dammit I just had my man card renewed, now I have to go back!
---
You guys got it all wrong, it may look like Micheal is devouring this poor creature, but in reality the pig is trying to enter Michael's brain and turn him into a SwEaTy TrY hArD.
---
Ye, it cannot be compared to old BNP. It still pushes genspeed by a fair bit though.
---
They are so boosted that even having a killer that emulates survivor movement while moving faster than them and they still need the handicap.
---
Freddy is one of the best stealth killers, so watching the grass is probably the best wya to see exactly where he is. He will find you no matter what and you have to be prepared. Since he‚Äôs a M1 killer, he can be looped for days, so that‚Äôs where I‚Äôd start. Looping him should counter him really well. Like I tell other people, watch Bricky‚Äôs Casefile on Freddy. It covers how to play freddy but you can use that to your advantage. Reading Freddy exactly is really hard, but once you are in the dream world standard loops work. If you really need to, lead him to another survivor so he‚Äôll sleep them and hopefully chase them while you go off and get out of the dream world. It‚Äôs a bit dickish, but it works. 
---
Man I hate it when I have to make a clutch rescue somebody from a hook while being injured and instead of rescuing I start to self care right in front of him. I really wish those were separate buttons.
---
Ah I see. Fair enough
---
"toxic" is the best way I can put it. she almost always stacks a 3-4 man swf and teabags/emotes at every pallet, the SWF always does their best to flashlight save her. I don't find her entertaining either.
---
Okay, this is epic.
---
Discordance man, that‚Äôs the worst (as in as a survivor I hate getting caught doing a gen with someone lol) ruin is such a pain but manageable. Thanks for not running slow healing build though. 
---
I love you
---
Noed is almost a guarantee at anything past rank 16 for me
---
Entity decided that it is his time to leave
---
Uh no that was not the discussion. Nowhere in this entire post did people mention "god survivors" just random SWF.
---
I have played against so many legions. (PS4). You never know if you‚Äôre going to get one who uses frenzy and chases you or one who uses it to find other people. 
---
[cries in console] 
---
I almost didn't notice the wraith. 
---
PS4 solo survivor is also taking forever for me. I've gotten into like 2 matches in the past 40 mins
---
I thought they were good when they changed them so you had to actually be hit (though obviously they needed working on, some shots weren't counting etc).. Was really annoyed when they changed them back to this. It's disgraceful.
---
I think that outfit or at least the top actually references Waldo in the description in the in game store
---
You know he‚Äôs pissed
---
Pretty good job so far
---
I would prefer if they added the tank into it. Make him a killer that just yeets pallets and replace the terror radius with his music
---
If you want you can check out the other killers on my deviantart: [https://www.deviantart.com/jens56004](https://www.deviantart.com/jens56004) &lt;3
---
Sorry for the long silence! But I am finally back! &lt;3 
---
You summed up my feelings perfectly. Wow. 
---
Whats the deal with that by the way? Why havent they added the Left Behind dlc yet?
---
I'm not sure. But watching him play killer makes me feel like he has horse blinders on.
---
Is it because the community is really small? Why does it take so long?
---
22,5 seconds less gen time of a total 450 sec gen time for each BNP.  
---
That means each BNP effectively removes 5% of total gen progression needed from a match. Its not insane or broken, but its still pretty decent if a swf removes 20% of total gen time from the match. Not as strong as instaheals of course.
---
B U F F  B O I  to replace David?
---
Have you tried reinstalling the game? It's possible you may have a corrupt file
---
I agree 
---
lmao
---
This is a post made by a killer main obviously. 
---
It is just mashing, and if you don't keep a high speed you'll die quickly.
---
Also, quick tip for when you're on the hook for the first time: Don't try and actually escape the hook unless you have a decent Luck bonus from offerings. It just lessens the time you have for a teammate to get over and rescue you.
---
And when a teammate is coming your way and the Killer is still nearby, be sure to wiggle on the hook (halfway attempt escape, but let go before the bar fills) to let them know it's not safe.
---
Say what you will when it comes down to it you would rather complain than adapt like any other person playing a game
---
It's really easy to reach red ranks. Survivors just do a couple gens and you'll at least safety pip. Killers just whack a couple people or hook a few and you safety. The only time I've ever lost a pip is when the killer dc right as the game starts, as for killer, i don't think I've ever depiped unless you purposely don't do anything
---
Do you laugh maniacally when your blade goes through their guts?
---
i run serpent with shadow dance, find a gen, survivor runs away, kick it, chase after without taking all the time to bing bong back to reality
---
Valve doesnt want to
---
I like ardeitha for his memes
---
My friend is a shirtless David. He isn‚Äôt toxic, he‚Äôs just so dumb that it seems like he is.
---
I love killers like these! 
---
I adapted the best I could. I played to the best of my ability, I stopped using NOED and I didn‚Äôt camp or tunnel. I‚Äôm complaining about people who complain about dying to the worst killer. 
---
I mean, I guess marth is a pretty good survivor. Did you pip against them or something? 
---
I mean I k ow it's rare a  whole team is as good as zut and noob but imagine they were. Imagine facing a team of noob, zubat, jendenise and trutalent. What killer do you think stands a chance?
---
Legion is free pip regardless. It‚Äôs harder to not pip as legion tbh
---
I would even miss then
---
Nah let her up I want her dead for the amount of toxicity
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/glossary
---
Yeah the comic should have said "make rank 1 rewarding" because right now I have no incentive to hit rank 1.
---
All very true
---
Because they are snowflakes
---
I'm sorry, were you there? Just because I wasn't at the other end of the map away from my hook doesn't mean I camped lmao
---
Ye, my bad. Thought it was 90 sec per Generator and you just rounded down. Then its  
---
20 from 400 for the same 5% and 20%.
---
well if noed is so good how come there's no noed 2?
---
Okay but the build being annoying is irrelevant, it's not against the rules. Also, I most certainly was not camping. What was I supposed to do, go to the other end of the map and just ignore my hook?
---
Ochido is really toxic, he created some memes (for example - dud). He calls himself lord of plebs (plebs - his subscribers, fans, dbd players). Also he doesn‚Äôt respect women. But he was fun someday.
---
Noob3 hacked legacy (you can find videos about it on his channel). He is not that toxic as ochido. I like him, sometimes watch his streams, he‚Äôs fun, don‚Äôt know why people hate him.
---
Monto is great for beginners, and just to watch some dbd gameplay. He is not that fun as noob or ochido, but he‚Äôs a great guy. Created meme about slowing game down just a little bit
---
???
---
Search sverkeren. He's better
---
I wanna play some SWF now :(
---
He used his instaheal as he got hit healing him fully. 
---
Still, you could have gone for a 360 over a vault 
---
I like the idea of a shambling corpse type killer but the power is not very good in terms of actual being usable or balanced. Since he‚Äôs reliant on chases but has no extra method of ending them unless he lets the survivor loop him for a whole minute and even then it could have no effect. Besides that, it‚Äôd be tediously unfun. It‚Äôd be unfun to chase a survivor and only go win because he couldn‚Äôt use a pallet and it‚Äôd be definitely unfun as a survivor to only go down for that reason. The other tiers of the power are next to useless too, if you‚Äôre chasing a survivor and lose him in 20 seconds and haven‚Äôt injured him atleast, the survivor doesn‚Äôt deserve a debuff for outplaying you.
---
To be fair to the survivors, that really doesn't sound fun to play against. However, you definitely weren't breaking the rules or even being a toxic killer. Anyone playing any game gets upset when their efforts seem fruitless, especially in DBD. The blame is pretty easily laid on the other team playing "unfairly," so that's where the blame goes. Skill as survivors= toxic looping and genrushing, skill as killer= tunneling and patrolling hook. Combine that with crutch perks and you have yourself a veritable Civil War
---
I got NOED for the Wraith. I got it for Freddy to. And i got 2 Memento Moris for my Ghost.....welp
---
Camping - standing by the hooked survivor 
---
Slugging - hitting a survivor into the dying state and leaving 
---
A lot of ones like NOED and WGLF are just abbreviations for perks (No One Escapes Death and Were Gonna Live Forever) 
---
wait, has sabo squad to no hooks become a thing again? 
---
I‚Äôm not big fun of spirit, but try stridor
---
Yeah it lets you exchange auras if you're looking at their direction. It doesn't show freddy unless you're asleep but it DOES light up when you look in his direction. The reason i like it against freddy is that when you can see him, he can already see you anyways cause of his innate wall hacks so there's no downside and against the paintbrush m&amp;a build that relies on permanent wallhacks, you both end up staring at each other through like 2 walls trying to mindgame each other and laughing.
---
and yeah you can get in a locker and take a look around without exposing your own aura. it was a great buff to OoO
---
Oh, so its laziness? Because building a computer takes hardly any time at all.
---
So true and very hot
---
You little shit
---
I love seeing all the female killers together
---
I literally don't know how to win in this game, either I play well or I don't play well. Either way I'm trash, the only difference is that if I play well I get reported lol
---
Because Valve made L4D and you can just use their characters, BHVR has to ask them first. 
---
No one calls you a camper for returning to the hook after someone gets unhooked but if you only leave so you can face the hook from far enough that your terror radius is gone, you are indeed proxy camping. That‚Äôs not even hate, if that‚Äôs how you play whatever. But it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúgood‚Äù way of playing, as in the way that is fun for everyone. 
---
Also, if you‚Äôre playing Doctor at all, especially one built behind making people fail skill checks constantly, you‚Äôre gonna get hate because folks just don‚Äôt like playing against him.
---
You're getting downvoted, but I agree. No fucking way I am going to spend my time playing in a game where the main goal is for them to ruin me having fun. 
---
also false reports will do nothing, im 99% positive the feedback system is placebo
---
Prayer beads is one of the best add ons, try to build around that. Discordance (which just came out with the legion) is awesome on her. Haunted ground + Thrill of the Hunt for a roulette build. Aside from that, the standard BBQ n Chili or Hex: Ruin always works
---
Prestige Quinton players scare me,  a man who went and brought the Freddy DLC for Quinton or Quinton himself and grined him up is clearly a man who has nothing to lose.
---
You‚Äôre relatively new I take it?
---
Not sure how you ‚Äúloop‚Äù a Nurse for 3 blinks. I‚Äôm an ok Nurse at best and so never get looped. You can‚Äôt really loop a Nurse unless they are just starting to play her.
---
Not at all what I was doing, but I'm still of the opinion that "proxy camping" isn't breaking any rules. Even if I was sitting right next to the hook with Insidious on, I think that should be fair because that's time that I could be spending focusing generators. If the survivors are dumb enough to take the bait instead of working their generators that I'm (theoretically) not destroying (because I'm camping), shouldn't that be on them? lol
---
Good beginner perks on her are predator and stridor, but i would get used to not using them so you can make room for better options. I usually run Ruin, BBQ, Whispers, and either hallowed ground or sloppy butcher. M&amp;A also works really well on her. For add-ons I usually use things that decrease the time to start phasing and decrease the cooldown. Beads are also fun for gen pulls.
---
Source: R3 Spirit main
---
Lol, I already had trouble spotting the nurse, so when you said there was a hag, It took some time to find her
---
I played other killers to level up my leatherface...
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone says camping is against the rules, it‚Äôs just unfun and annoying. I get why you do is, playing Doctor it‚Äôs one of the few ways to stay viable in higher ranks as him. But as a survivor it‚Äôs extremely frustrating so I understand why they shittalk. 
---
BBQ, Ruin, Sloppy and 4th is your choice (Stridor, Myc, Nurses are all great options) 
---
The middle house is so fucking bad. Got looped like a mofo by balanced landing.
---
Ok so you get face camped because killers at that rank are either bad or don‚Äôt know any better so they do that. As you do up in ranks camping still happens just much less. There‚Äôs not much you can do about getting tunneled other than learn to loop and mind game the killer so they give up on you or break line of sight to stealth by them
---
First and foremost is to learn pallet/window looping and when to do it. You'll last a lot longer and killers will give up on you a lot more if you're a tough target to catch. There's not a lot to do against facecamping, but the higher you get in ranks the less people do it
---
You're probably just not very good at hiding from the killer yet, so you stamd out way more than the other survivors. Just keep practicing and try a few killer games too to see how the other perspective is. 
---
I just did one of these in Red Forest. Only one Dwight that didn't give up before the first gen finished. I even led him to a chest so he could get an item out with him.
---
non being right in front of the hook but patrolling it is called proxy camping. they weren't wrong  saying you "camped". I say stop thinking about it as a dirty word and more so a tactic 
---
ruined the fun of the game? lol. With all the swf all communicating to get out before I even get one kill, the verbal abuse that comes after that, all the ds and borrowed times that makes me feel robbed. All the smerfs that join their friends to bully lower ranks like me. Do you think I have fun with that? Do you think I enjoy the feeling of getting used, insulted, and just requeue hoping that this time will be better? No, those altruistic survivors got what was coming to them. This was all after all the gens were done, gates were open, and they were using me for points.
---
Ruining the fun for them? Fuck you
---
If you know you weren't toxic but you still get blamed for it you win. 
---
This is a team I'd like going against
---
This game is fun but the the mechanic for killing survivors is terrible .  Who thought the hooks would be a good idea and not toxic half the time ?        
---
Entitled generation
---
I mean, I only think of it as a dirty word because people threaten to report me for it on a daily basis... Like, what am I supposed to do? Ignore my hooks and make it easy for them?
---
I blame Monto and his Sabo Squad video. Cancer af.
---
No0b is a better survivor. He just moves a lot better and usually makes better plays as far as chases go. Zubat is an insane killer though. Zubat is also a good survivor, not saying just because Noob is better that Zub is bad or something.
---
YOU SEE THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG KIDDO

yesterday and the day before yesterday I started to hate on survivors again. and thinking about it, in 1.9k hours I've never got a killer that would piss me off unless they were specifically targeting me for several matches. and that happened maybe two-three times.
---
I'm a rank 1 killer but I don't play Nurse.
---
 sometimes, rarely, I hop on her to just torture myself cause fatigue gives me anxiety. so I did yesterday. brought bps, got Springwood where blinks at preschool fucked a bit. tried to play as fair as I could, changing targets and all, not camping. clearly seeing I'm bad at Nurse, they would still take me to preschool every time. t-bag, click their flashlights. I hooked 3 people, which is actually an accomplishment for me, last guy I hooked when both gates were opened by one of those gates and left for another gate. the guy on the hook killed himself cause two that were still on the map decided to drop the pallet and fast vault it instead of saving him. in the end chat the toxic ones told me to go play Trapper cause I have no skill and other mean things as if I did any asshole move at all. I only used base Nurse perks too and no add-ons. 
---
again yesterday I switched to survivor. the Game map that wasn't an offering. Wraith with no annoying add-ons. whole game until one gen was left didn't camp or tunnel. the last gen, I'm with No Mither doing it. others fuking around with Wraith saving a guy in his face with Borrowed Time. obviously he follows the unhooked one and ignores those trying to block cause one gen left, fairly securing a kill especially with the disrespect of the unhook they did. he gets the guy, naturally, they're dead. gen is done, me and two others escape. in the end chat others call him an asshole and cunt and camper and tunneler. he literally had Spirit Fury on 2 and Bloodhound on 1, that's all. others had full meta and items. they t-bagged him at the gate and insulted in chat. a Wraith with two perks on rank 1. that didn't camp or tunnel till 1 gen left. 
---
because of Legion I started feeling for survivors for a bit but they are the evil. I am back at hating on them cause whatever people say here, if killers camp, it's 40% deserved, 50% cause previous games were annoying and they're removing frustration, 10% various reasons. but survivors BM in most games when you literally never doing anything to deserve it. doesn't matter if you play fair or scammy, they will blame you anyway. 
---
Step 1: buy oats

Step 2: buy feed bag

Step 3: profit

It's been suggested. Another streamer (Ardetha) posted a couple of vids claiming he had proof but nothing concrete has ever surfaced.
---
Regardless Ochido is massively toxic to the point of inciting his fanbase to troll and abuse other players who beat him. He's also a massive cheat, something which eventuly got him hardware banned on PC for his antics. Supposedly he haunts PS4 now.
---
Personally I'm cool with noob and Monto.
---
Survivor vs killer. Which is which? I'll never tell
---
Ideally you find another survivor to hook after you hook one.  Who cares if the first one gets unhooked, that's 2 people off of gens for awhile, 3 if you successfully found someone to chase.  If it's not SWF, there's a chance 2 people went for the save meaning that no generators are getting done.  Repeat this until everyone is dead, generally the goal is to get as many bloodpoints as you can in each of the 4 different categories.  Sure, getting a survivor dead can be very helpful but sacrifices are only 1 category, and getting out there to disrupt gens and get more chases is important too.  8 hooks and 0 kills is likely going to net you significantly more bloodpoints and higher overall emblems than 4 hooks 4 kills. Ideally it's 12 hooks 4 kills, since that allows you to achieve the max 32k point perfect game. Either way, it's more fun for all 5 players I think if the killer is going for back to back chases and starts stringing hooks together.  Also all 5 players get many more bloodpoints and better emblems from this playstyle.

Exactly
---
I thought I saw in the Dev stream recap that they said luck will affect chests after the mid chapter patch.
---
It depends on things like is there noed? How good is the player I‚Äôm going to help? Who is the killer? How good is the killer? How far is the exit gate from where they got hooked because the killer will most likely be near them. Do I have BT? Stuff like that will influence my decision 
---
Remember that drug commercial where the dad asks his teen where he learned to do this shit?  And the teen responds, "You, OK?!  I learned it by watching you!". That's how I feel about BHVR, who has this huge problem of deranking and DCs, but also decides that once a month (on the 13th) for about a week it's a really good idea to ruin the gaming experience for all low rank survivors.
---
Master race lmao.

---
Legion ez DC game.
---
I always save others.
---
I remmeber 1 game I was SWF with my brother and 2 other randoms. And the exit gates were open and someone just got hooked. So the three of us were waiting by the gates wondering if we should escape. We kept pointing toward the hooked guys direction then all three of us ran across the map to save him. Killer was camping, one of us blinded the killer while someone else got him off the hook.
---
Then we all ran to the exit gates together and escaped. Best moment I've had in game and the guy we saved probably felt special when he saw he had seal team six arrive and escort him out.
---
If killer has NOED or is facecamping I nope the fuck out. If they don't I will gladly sacrifice my entire body for fellow survivors. I usually die either way because I'm a boosted survivor
---
Ah I understand, but I usually try to save them no matter what unless they're just horrible survivors lol
---
I was in a solo match against a tunneling pig. I was hooked once, tunneled and hooked again. After, the meg who saved me, followed me to the boxes to block me in case the pig came to me. As soon as I got my mask off, the pig was there and the Meg took a hit. It wasn‚Äôt enough though, the Pig still came for me. The Meg tried to body block her to the hook but was too slow. It really was nice to see someone try and help. I messaged them to thank them.

The skull cap on killers is pretty low. Once you get past a certain point your ability to rank up starts to become more and more dependant on the survivor groups you get. Getting matched with a group of solo's where some of them aren't so good will yeald a completely different outcome to a well coordinated SWF.
---
I'm a casual player, maybe 10 hours a week tops, so I start each season around rank 14/15 and climb steadily as I play, usually finishing around the 8-10 range. Some games I pull an easy 4K and some games I get stomped. One thing I have noticed as that ranking in this range seems to be related more to how much you play and not how skilled you are. Maybe at high rank it's different but from what you've said it doesn't sound it.
---
Its not that rank 1 isnt fun, its that the people who derank are losers.
---
Also play on low for better clarity and brighter shadows.
---
Where my Bing bong boi at?
---
I don't get it
---
Because he has NoEducation /s
---
If the team played well I‚Äôll be more likely to help them but if they were potatoes I‚Äôm not helping them and with rank reset putting me back to rank 10 yea I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be helping the team very much lol
---
I saw a stream of his from a couple months back. It's insane
---
Noob I haven‚Äôt seen much hate against but OchiDO is an actual piece of garbage he‚Äôs been proven to have sexually harassed multiple women he constantly goes on witch hunts that he doesn‚Äôt like sending his fans like rabid dogs 
---
I'd heard of Insidous.  It's actually very powerful on spirit as it begins to charge whilst you are phasing because the Husk does not move.  And lots of mindgames can be done with Spirit's phase like faking it out woul also charge Insidious.
---
Why? You just make the killer‚Äôs job easier and the survivor‚Äôs job harder. Tbh you‚Äôre a dick for that. 
---
There is an achievement for doing that 20 times.
---
Tbh since I don't usually play Huntress I farmed it in 2 or 3 games.
---
Just stand still and snipe people at gens letting the other survivors heal them.
---
If you have trouble calculating distance you can use whispers and make sure they are barely inside the 32m radius.
---
There are always lockers at these double twalls. So refill hatchets. And it is p easy to stop them from looping this stop. Its hard to describe but you just gotta double back or switch up the direction. And this is balanced because killers need to mindgame to win the loop and survivors need to mindgame as well and they both have to predict each other.
---
No mither builds were a reliable middle finger to legion when he first came out. It still is. The problem is the hype for it died off and not every single match is a legion match anymore. I'm not running no mither builds for the "just in case scenario."
---
No I think i'd say most, take a look at;
---
- Overwatch
---
- League of Legends
---
- CSGO
---
- Rainbow Six Siege
---
Granted, most of the rewards you get from those games are purely cosmetic and dont change gameplay, which might be a good idea for DBD too, considering how big the cosmetic store is. A good  thing to reward players for rank would be Iridescent Shards.
---
Well this was my first double BP event, so I went for teachables that I wanted. After that, I burned BP on my main survivor for the Winter Boxes and perks and whatnot.

A hunter. 
---
switched on killer is too strong unless good SWF in Last Year. It's not well balanced just yet
---
Few factors to consider: Loadout, who the killer is, how the match has gone down up to that point, if NOED's at play, how coordinated my team has been, how far away from the gates they are, do they even know where the gates are, and how many teammates need saving. 
---
Usually I'd say yes its worth the risk and totally feels good on the soul, but it bites even harder when the risk doesn't pay off and you know the killers got that shit eating-grin on their face cause your altruism fed them another kill.
---
You're right! I'm sure the devs will see the tag and then not feel bad about their low player base!!! 
---
I write down their names in the great book of grudges.
---
there should be an addon that gives all survivors terror radiuses
---
Stop posting the same fucking shit over and over again.
---
I wish they would just get rid of the ranks. The game becomes so unfunny if I play more than once a week and inevitably end up against face camping r1 killers (since it's also near impossible for them to depip with the shard system). It's not fun, simply put. And there's no upside to rank based play outside of helping new players ease into the game, which is easily fixable with some sort of starter queues. Not to mention as a killer your queue times literally quintuple once you go from rank 5 to rank 4. All killers drain down to red ranks and saturate the queue times.
---
That‚Äôs a man

hey i was there with you

this too.
---
I played with a rank 1 killer a while back and he gave me amazing advice. Don't run everywhere. The killer can see your hash marks. I stopped and I'm pretty good at not being caught. Also be careful where you start a generator at the beginning of a match.... I like to hang back and see if the killer is going to find me or the gen I was just about to do.

At 2.5 hrs there is nothing I wouldn't go back for. Its just a game and odds are I ranked if the gates are open.

I have not played against many clowns and when I have they have not been using that outfit which is sad. It¬¥s cool yeah

* If you are the Obsession *, once per trial, when grabbed by the Killer, succeed a Skill Check to automatically escape the Killer's grasp and stun them for 3/3¬Ω/4 seconds.

Trust me this isn't just console. Its on PC and if you don't have a cutting edge PC it WILL fuck up your framerate and lag you to hell.

I'd like either a stacking BP or XP buff depending on your rank that caps out at rank 1. 
---
I suggest not posting this when its  2 in the morning

I am talking about hard counter that directly affects it with its primary purpose being to defeat DS more reliably. Enduring they can still DS you just are not stunned as long. Unnerving doesnt even take that much of the bar away, Agitation you move faster, dribble pisses survivors off. So yea.
---
I miss my DS skillcheck too much for a P3 Laurie, only reason I don't run it
---
montoo
---
K I will start dribbling and when survivors get pissed about it as they always go I will just laugh and say "git gud"
---
Cause that is the community that we strive for. Toxic gameplay
---
watch montos sabo squad vid
---
just bring an ebony
---
He literally states he decided to cut a boring 3k before and another where he was doing "toxic cannibal" but he basically basement camped(point of the video was) and it was boring so he cut it even though it was a 4k. 
---
Shame on y'all for not telling him about the lord Demi. 
---
I feel like I've gone back in time to when this still wasn't funny. Respect for the freddy main tho
---
There are so many better perks you can take that'll stop them from even getting 5 gens done though. And on top of that, you're right,  he has a chainsaw making NOED even more useless. Itll never catch anyone off guard unless they check the results screen, and all it's good for then is some confusion. 
---
There's not a million reasons why I could think to run this, and there's not any I couldn't. No reason to close the game if they never got there 
---
De nada ;)
---
I do have respect for them. Just a shame the killer is well a very low tier killer. Needs a nice, huge buff.
---
I never ask myself if I'm good at the game. It would be the same as asking if I am good at watching a movie, Yes I manage to have fun, yes I could be better, but it's a game.
---
Sometimes I get sweaty, sometimes I camp and tunnel, sometimes I just leave for easy unhooks. Its my choice.
---
Can he rip out slabs of concrete from ground and throw it at the survivors? That should be his power. Pallet yeeting should be just baseline feature.
---
He needs a bit of a rework. The way his power is designed prevents him from being anything but bottom tier. No additional movement, very little map control, have to wait 7 seconds (?) before hitting anyone or pulling them off of something, waking up is really easy, the only way you can succeed is tunneling... same boat as legion in that he's not that fun to play as or against. A shame, really
---
From what's in the video, you started to Snap out of it, instead of dropping the pallet as they both seem to be R1 for you. 
---
The game encourages survivors to play recklessly. Imo survivors never deserve a pip when they die.
---
Maybe but it would be hard to make it match up with each map. That's why I suggested pallet yeeting. Cause pallets are the same all around and can be destroyed.
---
Agreed. I really wanted Freddy to be the new Nurse upon his release but nope. Legion... well yep... bad killer too. People who use Sprint Burst or Lithe can seriously gain distance from him as he uses his ability. I'm one of those who uses Sprint Burst and it's sad.
---
If they're unhooking while you're inside their asshole then I find it doesn't super matter. If it was like this way more hook grabs would happen, but even if a healthy survivor takes a slap for a hooked one you can usually down both again pretty quick. I don't really find it to be too much of a problem. Also survivors would get farmed unintentionally way more often
---
??
---
There would be basically no counter to campers if they did that. So fuck no, imo.
---
For nothing??
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a mask, you can see saw of them around the Game map, very gross
---
Might as well remove The Game from, well, the game because every survivor would blacklist it.
---
The rage ability is awfully similar to Feral Frenzy
---
Hey... I do the exact same thing!
---
He could just plow through the small corridors and walls of the Hospital. Open new pathways.
---
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. The game progresses by doing gens and currently is in a meta where survivors do it as fast as humanly possible. I'm not kidding, I've had pig games where the match was under five minutes. All it takes is someone to spawn on your Ruin totem and an entire perk goes down the drain.
---
Obviously devoting everything to the endgame is not at all where you want to be, but a single perk is perfectly good.
---
Also don't forget that while the Legion and Self Care buffs aren't going live, the fact the killers loadout will be a secret till after game conclusion IS.
---

---
Love when that happens. Good job
---
I agree. This sounds a problem that only affects a small fraction of the player base. The majority of killers wouldn't run into this problem. Just hit them and then they're injured. If they don't run away, hit em again. 
---
DbD is a cash grab. Only expect the bare minimum from them.

You can clearly see her mud tiddy.
---
Small game is like a condomn
---
I was looking at the aura confused and then I saw it. I‚Äôm very tired lol
---
It's 14:26
---
Why is everyone booing? Hes right. They should work on bug fixes, blancing, and reworks, then more killers should come.
---
Exactly, if you hit them when they fake grab, then they actually unhook the survivor, that saver is still definitely going to go down. Worst case scenario you got a hook trade. Now if you're super toxic and really want to rehook the same person, they yea you might get disappointed, especially if they got BT from the saver.
---
14:26?
---
2 in the afternoon and 26 minutes
---
Probably killer mains who already got bored of using the killers we have now !
---
Dude some people will call killers campers for anything. 
---
I personally like the first idea out of those two, since it does get quite boring if you get the same map constantly. Although I would only recommend it if it included all map variants into the ban pool, and not just the 1 map variant that was played. There are enough maps to implement that and it allows people to constantly play on different maps, and not get unlucky and just get a different variant of the same map.
---
The anti-map offerings are also interesting, however I can not see them getting much use. I get the idea for it, but I don't see anyone using them unless they have an excessive amount of them, or simply don't have another offering to choose. 
---
Probably the best and most universally fun DLC killer they've ever made.
---
I really don't like the power...
---
Tier 1 does almost nothing, since it is better for survivors to work on different generators. That power forces survivors to play in the most efficient way, so it actually helps them imo.
---
Tier 2 is only usefull if you are going to camp. We don't need another killer with a power that rewards him for camping
---
Tier 3 is basically everything wrong with legion. Can you cach the survivors? No? Just tunnel them for 60 seconds and they will go down with almost no counterplay!
---
Also it doesn't have any "active" part to it. It is just passive, making the killer just a w+mouse1 machine with nothing interesting in terms of gameplay
---
Exactly 
---
Thats just a one sided pov. The Fun Thing in dbd are Chases. If you as a Killer decide to Camp / mit Engage in a Chase. This happens:
---
Surv on hook does Not have fun
---
Killer doesnt have fun(he literally doesnt do anything)
---
Other survs are sitting there pressing m1. So everyone is bored and Not having fun because the Killer Thinks he MUST camp
---
The huntress hatchet had me rolling
---
Trapper consistently cant grab people. He has to grab hit grab, most other orders result in bugs.
---
i personally use rancor, nurses calling, hex: ruin, and make your choice
---
As a killer main by mantra is "find an easy target".  Any killer will focus you if you always run like others have said or do obvious things. Now obvious is a vague term, but try not to run in a straight line or heal when you're barely out of sight. (There's way more, but I can't think to list all of it.)
---
My main things as a killer are hearing and intuition, then sight. Meaning I hear a generator (or anything), I guess where the survivor might be, and look if I'm correct. It's counter intuitive but sometimes staying still when you're close to the killer can keep you safe. No scratch marks and no sound means I may very well have no idea where you are.
---
As a killer, I have a pretty narrow field of vision. Survivors are deceptively sneaky. Use that to your advantage. 
---
Yeah but like... the killer's so trash
---
Yea PC only content great!
---
/s btw
---
Skill based counterplay is nice
---
It has to do with internet too.. The hitbox is indeed pretty big but I think this was something with internet.
---
In the movie and game, but not in this fanart. You can clearly see an expression.
---
I'm not convinced the game is a killer sided map, almost every pallet is a safe pallet. If you get survivors who are competent that map blows ass as killer. Should have seen scott get it the other day literally 20 safe pallets, he was going off about how bad the map was for killer. 
---
There's a Hag. Look between Myers and Huntress's booty.
---
I dunno about whole "doesn't get kills" man. With Bloodhound he downs you guaranteed with no counterplay. He is kinda too slow and can't get more than 2 kills unless survivors fuck up major...but doesn't get kills part does not ring true..in fact, he simply can't "have no counterplay" and "get no kills" at the same time.
---
Nurse? Marth88 hes god tier
---
Always on fucking mothers dwelling...
---
*a strange figure appears in the mirror* *screams* HI SISTERS
---
I mean, frenzying down does not work. Just hitting them twice instantly and cutting chase -&gt; following blood without looking at them. This way chase does not last more than ~25 sec, especially if it's meat plant or clinic.
---
I mean, it's most likely not intended and I am playing game just for ~3 weeks on irregular basis and it got me to rank 2 (when reset hit) way too fast with double and often triple kills. Actually, it kinda ruined my killer experience because I was too afraid to pick killer like spirit at that rank to learn her...and ther's no unranked...
---
Oh I forgot to mention that I refuse to moonwalk out of principle. Without that he can't reliably kill without Frank's. The fact that moonwalking is even a strategy (and a good one) for that godawful killer makes me wonder what went wrong in the design room. It also doesn't help that I'm on console and have to deal with 5-10 FPS whenever I do a frenzy lunge
---
or he just tried to camp
---
Be ready to be tunnelled and face camped if you do this. 
---
&gt; Although I would only recommend it if it included all map variants into the ban pool, and not just the 1 map variant that was played.
---
With 12 realms it's reasonable, I think.
---
I'm playing with We'll make it last days, and whenever I switch Borrowed Time for WGLF, I often encounter situations when killer is tunneling/camping/proxy camping, and people don't wait for heals (and sometimes there really isn't any time)
---
E
---
Matter of opinion. If it becomes clear that they have you completely outmatched, probably with the help of a 3rd party communication service, frequently spam loops and body blocking making it literally near impossible for you to successfully hook anyone then they've created a very unfair and toxic situation and frankly you might as well get the once sacrifice.
---
The Spirit with normal toes, thank goodness.
---
Hahahahaha. 
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm being downvoted for disagreeing with outright face camping someone. Not patrolling, not hitting unhookers, but watching someone wriggle on a hook for two full minutes because they had the bad luck to have team mates that tried to rescue them too fast. I play both killer and survivor and it‚Äôs not like face camping is a thrill ride for the killer either, it‚Äôs basically the most boring and unrewarding thing you can do in the game.

---
What about the goat Coach
---
I've never found them to be easy points. Quite the opposite. I just find it bloody infuriating and it's the main reason I tend to take multi month long breaks from the game.
---
It's one thing to have a survivor lead you on a chase and make you choose to try and get them, or try and get someone else. When everyone else knows it and just generator rushes it's another game entirely.
---
All of the stereotypical toxic killer stuff is true with the legion. Extreme tunneling, successful when camping, actually no counterplay... after the Spirit came out I thought every killer was gonna be a slam dunk. Sweet jesus I was wrong
---
amd run tenacity while healing and going diffrent directions.
---
Am I the only one who realises he was shocked?
---
I love going against SWF groups where I know it will be a challenge. There‚Äôs nothing better than outplaying they without using stuff that‚Äôs too OP. Especially when they‚Äôre using DS, insta heals, toolboxes, etc
---
* Equips "Tombstone piece" add-on. *
---
Why were u waiting to waste the god pallet in the first place lol
---
Sexy
---
Thats what happens when you use calm spirit.
---
And if they have hex totems that are in sneaky spots, we get rid of em fast :(
---
That's kinda the name of the game anywhere above rank 8 regardless of whether or not they're SWF. Gens get done stupid fast without ruin and if your chase with someone lasts longer than a minute or two you can kiss that match goodbye. Not trying to defend toxic ass SWF groups by any means, but with good enough survivors that's just kinda how the game is sadly. Killer just doesn't feel good right now, hopefully 2.5 changes that a little
---
Claudette
---
Yea i think its always fine if you do it as a swf but for the solo players I can imagine this being frustrating at times :) 
---
You dumb bitch...
---
Nope. Entity overrules all and everything 
---
It is on them, any decent survivors or decent SWF should fall for it once and leave you stand there and rush gens and you'll be lucky to get 1 or 2 kills. I've seen tunnlers/campers even get 0 kills against good teams.
---
It's 0 fun to play against as survivor but not against the rules and is generally considered a no skill or toxic strategy.
---
But ultimately play your way I say the game is no more complicated then killer gotta kill and survivors gotta survive.
---
Many people seem to have made up rules they expect others to follow.
---
I got to rank 1 accidently as Freddy, and I remember my first R1 game ever. I had this Dwight, just being an complete ass to me, and his teammates. Teabagging, leading me to his teammates on purpose, and etc. 
---
I normally try to play as fair as I can, but this guy deserved everything he got. Tunnel, camped, he even got farmed by the teammates he screwed over too. Best part, he got angry at ME for dying, just because I was Freddy. You know, with the classic "bad player, play a better killer". Also, had his teammates give me props tho too(They may of been friends, but guy was just a dick). Win-win to me.
---
Every time I see a Claudette I know they must suffer a painful death 
---
As Myers I love running Make your choice (so I can put pressure on the whole map) know that I can instadown one survivor, Nurse's calling, Brutal Strength to not be looped for 1 minute and Bamboozle to make shack loops not viable.
---
I don't mind getting genrushed as I always run add-ons that will allow me to get tier3 soon enough to apply good pressure on the whole map.
---
the amount of down votes you're getting should be a sign of "what you are doing is not right".
---
You are directly contributing to the worst most entitled side of the community. I hope that it picks up you DC'ing so much and you end up getting a sanction.
---
Why do so many people not know about the screenshot function on the ps4
---
"Hello good sir, can I take your order?"
---
I'm playing at rank 18 so yeah...
---
Hmmm, Ruin alright then..... Maybe Franklin's demise as well, that would give the *very nice people* running flashlight spam builds a nasty surprise.
---
That's... Not how memes work...
---
More like normal legion FOV 
---
Well, the ranks have reset over the weekend, hopefully you pick up a different killer to try out. I'd recommend you try Billy if you don't have a lot of perks, or Wraith if you do. Wraith's mechanics are straightforward and not too hard to get a reliable grasp on. Billy's chainsaw can be pretty tricky to use consistently(for downs) but he is one of the top 3 killers for a reason.
---
On the other hand, if you would like to live dangerously, play Freddy. If you do, do not read any guides on how to use him, or any of this sub's input on how good or bad he is. Determine it for yourself. Find your best build. (Do probably read the wiki to learn the finer points of his design though, such as his smaller TR)
---
&gt;Ruin Nurse BMing
---
Yikes
---
Most of Monto's content are gimmick builds or rp builds so he only shows the games where they work out. Watching builds not working wouldn't be very interesting to watch. Tru3 and Hybrid Panda are more about showing their good games as well as their bad games.
---
No one can dw. Judging by the speed they add/change stuff I doubt we will ever get it sadly. So many things could be so awesome in this game if they were tweaked just a little bit.
---
It's trying to get under his mask lol
---
Freddy
---
Add Ons: The Yellow Dress Add-On, Unicorn Block
---
Perks: Pop Goes The Weasel, BBQ &amp; Chilli, Monitor &amp; Abuse and Nurse's Calling.
---
Survivor Pudding or a Hollow Shell
---
And killer says surv op because they don't bring stridora. 
---
OoO
---
In this case, do you also dc when you put Bloody Party Streamers (or any BP earning offering)?
---
&gt;Maybe the new highschool game that you can see on Discord could put up a fight for DBD
---
I wish dude. That game also launched with no progression system and totally lopsided balance with virtually no content. Not to mention the devs insist the game has 5k active concurrent players despite in my experience taking upwards of 15 minutes to find a game, with only 6 available lobbies to pick from worldwide.
---
Pretty sure it's dead in the water, which is a real bummer because some active competition for DbD would benefit both parties.
---
So lets see, you do 2 gens or more, juke the killer the whole game while your team is just trolling, farming each other and doing no gens, you are the last one standing, manages to sneak around and find the hatch. But it doesnt matter right? Its just a crutch for BAD survivors
---
(Mannn not like I eas about to entered the gates of sleep!!!) o0o
---
Remember back in the beta when the hitboxes were realistic but people complained they were too hard to hit so they did box hitboxes
---
Exactly.
---
Thank you!
---
Holy shit, a killer with a brain!
---
Overcharge is also good at lower ranks 
---
Your right
---
I completely forgot that The Doctor, Hag and Huntress weren't default included. On console you get all those killers as defaults.
---
Oh yeah
---
How can i delete someone else's post
---
Dick move but a entertaining one 
---
Doctor as he could have been such a great scientist finding cures and new methods of treatment for all the problems in the world, but got degraded to a brute executioner for the sake of information extraction for nothing than a ruthless government.
---
And Dwight as I have way too many things in common with him including appearance and the nailbiting habbit.
---
It is always magical when you boop the killer. It is even more when he boops back ;)
---
Hahaha oh yeah!
---
Perspective. He's closer than the others.
---
Go get em boiiiii
---
insidious reeeeeee
---
‚ÄúTeach me your ways, oh wise master!‚Äù- Legion
---
A boop is a boop. You can't delete the boop. Embrace the boop. BOOP.
---
Some people just suck at killer and don‚Äôt want to get bullied while trying to get BP (e.g. me)
---
Tbh if we are going to do this, Hag &gt; Wraith. boom  
---
Me on a gen: Hmm no ruin. 
---
My friend: Ooh a Hex totem, I‚Äôm bout to make them so mad lol. 
---
Me: Don‚Äôt do that that‚Äôs.....
---
**Thunder Clap into Exposed**
---
It‚Äôs just a game how is it disrespectful loool
---
Flashlight? Lul
---
Im a Killer main and i never camp. But i do tunnel as imo its a very effective strategy
---
I think items are untargetable by the survivor losing the item. At least I have never once seen a Pick Up prompt after being hit by Franklin's Demise. It even went as far as not being able to pick up my item at all after finding it on the ground again :&lt;
---
Sweet dreams!
---
ObofOb
---
Goldfish always do me good. Grab a handful whenever there's a lull and mash it into your mouth. The sodium will counteract the Survivors' salt for 4K'ing them.
---
Even better than this: juggle to the hook, just run Enduring and eat the ds anyways because its a great perk, run a slugging based build or run un-nerving presence.
---
But as a recommendation in case a newer player reads this; so what if they've got ds? It's a 1 time thing and 9/10 times they run dead hard too which means  you know what to prepare for, don't be scared because they have it. It's just a game after all. 
---
I find myself thinking what‚Äôs on everyone‚Äôs mixtapes. 
---
i am exaggerating xD
---
Huntress with Infantry belt + Iridescent head + Ebony memento mori. No perks needed. Tasty salty tears ;3  
---
I main survivor so i know how much people hate this.
---
I'm on mobile, can't write finely. It sucks both ways, specially if you are playing survivor 
---
C'mon man. [Stealing memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/afbzez/the_life_of_a_freddy_main/) ain't nice.
---
I'm a big fan of grapes, the sweet bitterness reminds me of their tears. Plus the natural antioxidants are great for countering the toxicity! Snack healthy, stay healthy, murder healthy.
---
The recent engine update messed them up, idk if/when it'll be fixed :/
---
Why corn of course
---
Ahh shit didn‚Äôt see this. Deleting now üëç
---
I'd say MYC, M&amp;A, Nurse's and Ruin. 
---
oddly enough, i had the same situation with my other survivors DCing a few times
---
and each time the killer decided to let me win, he would insist that i pallet drop on him 
---
i guess he wanted to break them for points too.
---
its kinda funny having a killer just standing behind you and looking over your shoulder while you repair gens , its like he is giving you moral support or something.
---
There are no ways to prevent camping, at least not without completely hamstringing Killers against overly altruistic Survivors.
---
This is an online game; people will be jerks to each no matter what penalties are associated.
---
Instead of punishing Campers, I wish Survivors would get Objective and Altruism points for having the Killer within a certain radius of the hook (regardless of ANY stealth abilities) or for getting downed or put into chase after getting unhooked (this should be put on an invisible timer roughly equivalent to twice the time it takes to fully heal with Self-Care, so that people don't get points just because the Killer hooked them at some point in the game). This could/should also help people who get farmed not get screwed over.
---
TL;DR: Stop trying to punish campers and tunnelers, start rewarding the people they target.
---
It's only unlimited range once the final gen is done, otherwise its 16 meters. 
---
in the first movie he killed 2 dogs and ate one of them
---
*Friday the 13th: the Game flashbacks intensify*
---
It's about money that's why legion is trash..so the babies can keep escaping and buying cosmetics.
---
There is nothing to fix. It‚Äôs a valid strategy and not reportable. Sucks to be camped, but just get over it and get into the next match
---
so its legit not just me being blind/my computer?
---
Having luck affect more would be great. Skillchecks that have larger greats time to time, make luck affect if crows get startled too. Small things like that. Lucky breaks without being bullshit RNG screwing killers more majorly.
---
If luck did get buffed to a larger degree, could have lucky breaks. Stun the killer and get a lucky hit on a weakspot, stunning them like half s second longer. Maybe make it so higher luck even reduces how much blood you pool behind you?
---
The salt would be magnificent 
---
but only slightly :D
---
Needs more balanced landing
---
\*Binds use item to mousewheel to flicker flashlight even faster\*
---
It's based on direction and momentum on console, which is why I stopped running Self Care. There would be times that I was at a pallet and tried to drop it, only to self care. And other times I would have to move slightly away from it, causing me to do the spin drop instead of the normal one. It's ridiculous.
---
"More elevation difference in general would be far more interesting honestly."
---
You can be happy knowing that the killers is most likely not gonna 4k if theyre camping you. Its a good strategy for getting 1-4k depending on the survivors altruism, but mostly 1-2k.
---
Depends on your connection to the server.
---
Dedicated Servers will only fix the "ping goes from 100 to 10000. And destroy most lag switchers.
---
However if you are really far away from the server, like say USA to China distance, you'll be getting around 200-300 ping and no less. So this is all you'll see.
---
[I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed.](https://youtu.be/4Js-XbNj6Tk?t=36)
---
Spirit is one of my mains and i run ruin, bbq, nurses, and myc. Works very well for me but everyone‚Äôs different. I definitely recommend using nurses and myc  though, her small terror radius helps nurses and her ability to move quickly with phase helps myc. Good luck &lt;3
---
why do killers hate x - it ruins the fun for them  
---
why do surviviors hate x - it ruins the fun for them.   
---
one party having fun ususally ruins the fun for the other. so. ...meh.  
---
Gotta say, I don't see why it should be prohibited. Sure it's annoying, and it remove all the fun for the survivor as well as the killer. But devs did what they could to encourage killer not to camp, by giving them more bloodpoints if they go and chase other people.
---
Plus, in certain situations, a camping killer can be lotta fun (like saving a fellow survivor end game getting camped by establishing a certain strategy). It can give the adrenaline most of us don't have much because we're used to the killers.
---
But yeah I get your point, I deranked a lot because I got camped as well. The best in this case is just to move on, maybe leave a "-rep" on the profile as a cathartic action and go play an hopefully better game.
---
I've never used that one. I can picture it making the survivors each work on their own gen, so that as I'm getting my first hooked, the other 3 all finish their gens at once.
---
See you, Space Cowboy. . .
---
It doesn't have to by any means. You can easily have a fun match as survivor, even though the killer killed all of you. You can easily have a fun match as killer even though all the survivors escaped. As long as no one plays like an asshole (Survs t bagging, killers camping/tunneling) it can be a fun match.
---
I saw this post conveniently right after I had a game with an afk killer, they ended up coming into play a minute or so after the last gen was done. I felt bad so I let them down and hook me, but they took me to the gate instead. Nice guy killer
---
Jen doesn‚Äôt like Ochido though? She got harassed by Ochido and when she refused to be his girlfriend, he blocked her.
---
N00b wants to distance himself from him because he heard about Ochido being a sexual predator.
---
Tru3 doesn‚Äôt like him because of the fact he was constantly mocked by him in videos and when Tru3 defended himself in Ochidio‚Äôs comment section, Ochido just removed his comment. Also Ochido‚Äôs fans constantly harassed him and stream sniped him.
---
Monto, I‚Äôm not too sure what he thinks
---
Hex: Despacito - Tier 3
---
Isn't the whole point to that sub that the words are written incoherently, and the sub is called r/dontdeadopeninside as a reference to the scene in TWD?
---
Don‚Äôt forget him being banned like 6 times and constantly evading said bans
---
It's the best tactic unfortunately.
---
They could provide other survivors with a boost to action speeds once one dies to discourage killing someone early but they'd have to increase Gen times to compensate a bit or else games will end too soon.
---
Unpredictability is your best tool as a killer.  Everyone expects killers to camp and tunnel, and when you don't, you put the survivors in a state of unease because they can't predict you.
---
Camping/ tunnelling gives survivors definite periods of being 100% safe.  Not doing that doesn't, and can really disrupt some teams.
---
It was the case in Friday the 13th. My best juke was to go in front of a closed house with survivors and say in a panicked voice "dont close the door he is behind me", then they opened the door and I was actually Jason. Good times
---
what the shit
---
So how about staying near the hook as killer and entity progression don't countdown? Good idea? 
---
Because that game was probably deved on PC and just ported on consoles
---
keyword "usually" hun. some ppl take the game to serious
---
Stabbing people with his healing knife.
---
I know that. But they had 1-2 years to optimise it properly
---
if u claim this isnt true you‚Äôre lying
---
I don't think camping should be stopped, just discouraged.
---
Idk man, i spin in circles and swing when they have ds all the time at rank 1. I only get hit with ds like 50% of the time. Idk if that‚Äôs because the survivors are potatoes or because the tactic actually works.
---
What are those reasons?
---
I think they should slightly extend the death timer when on a hook. It's a little too easy and rewarding to just hard camp somebody to death.
---
Tunneling just kinda happens though. BBQ discourages it, which is good, but it tends to happen anyway. The weaker survivor will always be an easier target.
---
Let me get this straight, you are wanting a perk that directly counters DS? Even though there are so many other tactics to counter it. You'd rather waste a perk slot to counter DS, even if it isn't in the game.
---
In a way console players payed less for the game.  Sure the console version is $30 instead of the $20 it is on Steam, but it also includes 2 DLC chapters(Hag and Doctor) that are $7 each on Steam.  So $34 for the same thing on PC vs $30 on console, not to mention all of the relatively newer players that just got the game for free from PS Plus.
---
As far as the actual point of the post goes, we could definitely use some big optimization patches and it is sad that it has taken this long before the devs have really started working towards more optimization but better late than never I suppose.  Though it can't come soon enough.
---
Holy fuck the sound effect made this so gud.
---
How does one confirm Haunted Groundys?

See, the bugs aren't what ruins the game for me, its always other players who ruin my experience. I play on lowest settings, but thats okay. But if the performance alone is such garbage on console, I understand your anger and hope they get it out as soon as its finished, you wouldn't want a half assed solution, would you?
---
You mean optimisation PASS? We only got promises, but no results
---
They were busy getting looped :(
---
They already made one halfassed solution. It really angers me that players dont really give a shit about the problem. Yeah they memed it a bit, got their karma and... That was it

What kind of perks are you using? I find him to be one of the killers I most often 4k, or 3k because I dont care if the last survivor gets hatch. 
---
You dont need to mash really fast, try it :)
---
It takes a lot of time. Every update has to go through Microsoft or sony certification before it can actually be download, unlike pc that can just be given the update without waiting for approval. 
---
P4 Claudette the true form
---
faster to take a screen and post here I guess
---
Nothing wrong with camping from a gameplay perspective, but understandably, it's kinda a dick move, but so are a lot of things in this game.
---
The best way to counter it is to punish killers for it. Hammer out gens and blow them out of the game for camping. Most killers keep doing it because it works, they hook someone, camp and then the rest of the team takes the bait and they just keep getting hooks. Altruism fuels the camp, doing gens is not only a better tactic overall, but will slowly get killers out of the idea of camping. Just remember, if we leave the hook and the first thing that happens is they get unhooked, you are teaching the killer that leaving is a mistake.
---
Tunneling basicaly doesn't exist and the few times it's applicable, it's either for DL or because the survivor in question is toxic and the killer wants revenge.
---
He looks like a cat that‚Äôs been spooked
---
Lol. Thats a bad excuse. Once therecwas a patch that fixed clown hat cosmetic. Thats it just one single hat. And you tell me they couldnt release a decent patch after a year of existance on consoles? 
---
I've never once had any sort of spinning or hitting things make me miss my ds, it does absolutely nothing lol. The ONE thing that makes me miss it is if my camera is aimed at a brightly lit area, it makes the skill check hard to see. 
---
As a survivor its frusterating when they camp and the other 3 survivors are waiting for unhook. These games I just kill myself on hook and go for next. Its totally fine when they are all working and leaving me to die, at least I know the killer wont get more than maybe one more kill after I die.
---
Tunneling can be frusterating if all the pallets around the hook has been used and/or if im not good enough to loop the killer. If you can loop the killer then tunneling just feels good. You know youve kept them busy long enough for everyone to escape, and sometimes you manage to escape aswell.

Context: Got out of a game, menu hud was extremely buggy and pixelated.

Dead hard&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Uh no?  I never wait more than 2 minutes for a survivor game, regardless of rank, solo, or swf.
---
I love so much when killers try to do this with me
---
I switch to survivor and play my No Mither build, and i (sadly) win with it.
---
many thanks to the adam that sandbagged me on a wall
---
This is clearly just the usage of King Cr
---
Monto and No0b3 are cool people and they don't like them because they are good.
---
On the other hand, OchiDo is intentionally trying to be toxic and actually even hacked the game, so there's a reason people hate him.
---
Why not...there are plenty of other "useless perks" perhaps someone doesnt want to have to deal with a DS at all and not do anything but rely on a perk that directly attributes to stopping it.
---
My favorite is when I play him and people throw the game. It's always Ace too. "Lemme just let him stalk me and hook me."
---
Absolutely great gameplay that doesn't screw over the other players at all for memes.
---
LMFAO..u win
---
Lmao well you die on their like 7/10 times so people complain less. 
---
League of Legends exists...
---
Unless they do it at a pallet or window vault, in which case you're locked in an animation and can't avoid it.
---
Ikr damm
---
That still literally doesn‚Äôt matter if you have a headset you won‚Äôt loose them. 
---
Iron Grasp , Dying Light , Bitter Murmer , and Deerstalker was what I just ran . I had one 4k then got up against some decent rank survivors and they toasted me . I usually run save the best for last and play with your food alone with the iron grasp and deer stalker .  What do you run ? 
---
I think you could still pull that off because it just became free on PSN a few months ago
---
I suggest keybinding the key for struggling to F or something else because as dumb as it sounds, it's much harder to mash on Space.
---
Mini amanda is cute af tho 
---
I'd like it if they removed offerings. Having survivors burn 20 coldwind or crotus penn offerings in one night is too much.
---
My favorite kind of player right here
---
This guy wins
---
No real way to fix it with out perks or something. Best way is to tie some blood point gain with the survivor team. Make it to where solo carries get a good amount and others who might not have contributed to gens but distraction also get some. 
---
We need more pics like this, its just too funny!
---
It‚Äôs so beautiful ü§ß
---
It's very likely because those perks are their teachables but they don't have to use them!
---
Looking at players with every perk unlocked in their favorite survivor many are/were running dead hard, selfcare, iron will etc. doesn't matter if they are playing Meg, Claudette, Bill or David.
---
No Hex is affecting you after you have repaired a gen and tried to cleanse a totem. Then it's Haunted Grounds because it has no effect.
---
It's ass

it's a meme build, relax buddy

There are 2 options when you get this kind of game.
---
- Tryhard mode.
---
- Fun mode.
---
Fun mode is to just play along and try your best.
---
Tryhard mode is to down someone next to a hook and keep downing them when they get up until the hook respawns.
---
Im not hoping to get noticed by the devs because they know all the problems themselves. Im trying to raise awareness a bit
---
it is a meme, live a little.
---
She gah deh ah? Fookin deh ah.
---
Because the purple with a battery and Odd bulb both have insane durability and make the blind last forever.
---
Props to that Nurse - her slow turn had me in stitches! 
---
Haha dude balanced is a great perk as is, it doesn‚Äôt need a buff, why do you think it needs a buff?
---
How do you do this for ‚Äúeducational purposes‚Äù

[SOME MOOD TO THE POST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAekpsclQY)

you can change what buttons do what in your settings, if im not mistaken

MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!
---
4 SWF run no mither, this lets you revive yourself an unlimited amount of times. Then they run Saboteur or take in sabo boxes. Then they run empathy and Unbreakable.
---
Basically they go to every hook in the game and 99% it. If the killer downs someone then they use empathy or comms to get to the hook near the killer and sabo it.
---
The killer can't slug them because they'll just revive themselves.
---
It was a scummy move by the Farming Nea, you did good.  
---
If the Nea was running Borrowed Time then I guess it's okay but since she was simply farming her teammates off the hook she didn't deserve to be rescued.   
---
Its certainly not bannable dude, nothing to worry about there.
---
:(
---
Correct.
---
Devour Hope?
---
making him tonight's big loser 
---
That's the reason it's probably one of the worst add ons. 
---
When you want to say that it's just client-server lag, but everyone else has already pointed it out, so you just settle on saying that you want to point out that it's client-server lag. 
---
Did you konw taht the briran can qutie ealsiy raed sutff as lnog as the frist and lsat lteter are in the crorect palce?
---
It‚Äôs exactly like the other 2000 people who have posted about this
---
Yes.
---
3 people need to bring an item just to instantly get 75% on a gen and you think that would be broken?

How do you tunnel when your not camping hook? I think your camping and you don‚Äôt even realize it. I am a killer main and I run BBQ which punishes tunneling. Give that a try.
---
When I kill them instead because it brings me great joy. 
---
it helps to consider the hate as canon, you're literally trying to kill them after all.
---
Sed, I could not understand a word of that
---
What about freddy though? Really well drawn imo.
---
No? The chain blink window doesn't get smaller after each blink, the fatigue only gets longer.
---
If I care about BP then I may escape but I have played a lot now so I don't care if I live or die as it's easy to pip and get decent points without surviving so I usually go and try to get someone and in some cases hook trade so they can get out over me.   
---
The thing I hate is when your hooked and someone sits at the exit gate, heals, then sits some more and waits for killer to appear and then exits. I feel you either get out or come back in and try to get me not just dither about the exit like a headless chicken trying to work out if you want to come or not.
---
It worked because honestly most people were trolling around in F13. Players were immersed and didn't know what they were doing. I did not played a lot tho, logged 50 hours total or so
---
You can still use them, but you can‚Äôt get any new ones. You can only get the firestarters from the Christmas event and the Chinese New Year event. So yes, they are still in the game. 
---
I haven't seen one of these in a very long time, actually. Care to link me the latest? Bonus points if you can find exactly 2.000 other posts about this, too.
---
Good thing I saved 50 of them.
---
Then we know what you are lacking. ^JK ^pls ^don't ^hate ^me
---
&gt; ell yeah they are. On PS anyway it's built in.
---
It's built into the playstation not The game. Steam also has built in voice communication, as well as Xbox. It's still toeing the line of cheating to use third party comms though.
---
*nuzzles Legion and notices Ruin * OwO what's this?
---
Camping implies i stay near the hook. I dont, i leave the hook then return once they are unhooked so i can bask in the salt of the toxic survivors ;)
---
he wears no socks you dont know whats on that ground
---
But no soul
---
i dont think so scratches seems to be fucked
---
It looks good ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è same frame rates too 
---
i would die
---
tbh the game looks better on low than ultra, but ofc that's only my opinion
---
Yeah Trapper is pretty buggy right now...
---
Pokemon Ghost Girl was waiting for her SWF group the whole time.
---
Do you hace Nike shoes
---
Yeah you should be able to run it, i dont know what the problem is.
---
Did you try to confirm the game files or reinstall it, if that doesnt resolve the problem write a support ticket
---
If you find another one, don't bother ask
---
As a Legion Main I completely agree. After a month of maining it i wanted to go back to Freddy because I wear Rank 1 Freddy Main as a badge of honor.... and I COMPLETELY FORGOT HOW TO COUNTER GETTING LOOPED AND HAVE BEEN SAFETY PIPPING :,(
---
I have 476 firecrackers on my nea lol 
---
I dunno. I‚Äôve never watched his stream, but any time I‚Äôve tried to watch one of his youtube videos he spends a lot of time calling people boosted and complaining about every little thing they do and how idiotic they are. He‚Äôs obviously skilled so I‚Äôd like to watch him, but he never really sounds like he‚Äôs having that much fun to me. Different styles I guess. 
---
welcome to our cult
---
Never said he cannot kill at all. He is just not good at it. 
---
i dont have words to describe how much i like this image.
---
Mate I use pebble that‚Äôs a great perk right? That‚Äôs not a healthy buff lmao it‚Äôs crappy but could be game changing 
---
I've started playing this game in like August, Devotion 3, and have received pretty much no hate messages (PS4). And I've played more killer than survivor. You know why you get so many hate messages? It's not because the community is toxic, it's because you're playing like an asshole. I mean, you bought the game, play however you want, but if people are not happy about it, don't blame the community, it's on you.
---
&gt; I was actively walking around the map but close enough to keep watch over the hooks so my survivors wouldn't escape. Isn't that the point of playing as a killer, to make sure the survivors don't escape?
---
As a killer, you don't have to protect hooks, you have to protect generators. See, that's what happens when people either don't play bother sides or just lack basic empathy. As a survivor, getting hooked and having your game end because you went down once sucks. Hook someone, go pressure gens, get into a new chase. Or don't. You do you, anyway.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs hard to out rank them when you chase them all match and they just focus on killing you and no one else
---
D: Ace mains rise up 
---
That‚Äôs what I do, and they just camp/tunnel
---
DeCisIvE iS baLaNCeD
---
So the build that literally gets rid of the chance of getting a hook and is just made for shafting the killer as hard as possible is okay because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmeme build‚Äù 
---
O, I didn‚Äôt see that one. +10 to adorable.
---
&gt;for whatever reason
---
Because the only way to win a chase against legion is breaking line of sight and mending, otherwise he can just keep following you recharging his power and inevitably down you.
---
This is also why he doesn't see scratchmarks when in Frenzy.
---
If you could see mending auras there would be literally no way to win chases and escape.
---
It's not related to wheter or not it's considered healing, it is mainly for balance.
---
He has a second ability, so the killer is not that bad, and is not similar, with frenzy you can still get stunned and when u end the frenzy, it doesnt give u a bonus speed
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Thank you for the context. Usually I bash teabaggers first unless given context, and your context was understandable. I personally wouldn't have done it, but I see why you did. Still cost you the win though.
---
There‚Äôs a reason there was ‚Äú ‚Äú around meme build you can‚Äôt use the defense that something is a meme build against a big fuck you build okay how about I go a anti fun slug build every match a meme build would be fun for both sides and not make one side basically powerless unless they happen to have a perk how does that make any sense a build that not only is gonna make you lose 9/10 times is also gonna make you gain like barley any BP and so yeah maybe I have a problem with a build that is a just a cluster fuck and doesn‚Äôt allow me to get a single fuck because but I shouldn‚Äôt care about a anti fun build because ‚Äúit‚Äôs a meme build‚Äù ‚Äúlearn to have lighthearted fun‚Äù yeah can‚Äôt wait for all the try hard SWF to run this and teabag every second of this game but hey ‚Äúit‚Äôs a meme build‚Äù I guess I‚Äôll run no gen doc on the game because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmeme build‚Äù 
---
What rank was the Nea? It‚Äôs very possible they were new to the game and don‚Äôt know how to play yet. I accidentally ‚Äúfarmed‚Äù people similarly my first few games until I realized that neither of us had a chance to get away from a killer right on top of us. I‚Äôm also not the brightest though haha
---
Trapper is a Jason wannabe xD
---
Once hit a guy who had a Rainbow Map wiyh Frank's. In the endgame they were all teasing me and taunting me "LOL easy game trash killer KYS" type shit. When I said "Oh well, at least I got your map." they flipped their shit and yelled "FUCK YOU YOU FUXKING MOTHERFUCKER YOU TOOK MY MAP FUCK YOU I HOPE YOU DIE PIECE OF SHIT FUCKER".
---
Little in this world can bring this amount of joy to my heart.
---
I think you just need a break from the game, and from the internet.
---
I mean, personally I always wait at the exit gate for the killer. I don't teabag, I just wait. If only to give the killer the extra however many points for a hit, it doesn't cost me anything but some time. 
---
Oh no, someone else mentioned if you have "bad" internet you shouldn't host! Prepare yourself OP you obviously hate poor people now.
---
Lolol I like to spin on quick circles while I walk around bumping into things, but that might be funnier
---
BHVR makes hooks respawn so that people can‚Äôt get rid of all the killers hooks 
---
DBD community makes this build 
---
truthfully ; not many situations since people don't really care enough/have the balls to say "Fuck you I'm calling the cops on you" and even if you do call the cops chances are your local department won't give a flying fuck they'll probably just tell you to fuck off lol, I was just reading up some books the other day and realized that you could technically have one of those two things happen should you type out such a message.
---
Unpopular opinion apparently: it‚Äôs a p2p game the connection will always be spotty so deal with it. Literally the only time I see someone with under 70 ping I know it‚Äôs bc we both live in the same state in the U.S. average ping is 80-150 depending on how good the survivors internet is
---
I have my most fun at rank 1, deranking to play worse survivors makes the game more boring imo and I don't actually get super toxic SWF groups that often or even more at rank 1 than I do anywhere else.
---
I literally were able to loop a Leatherface for 4 gens in The Game at rank 1 in the last season.
---
I think the most crucial part is the basement's surroundings, having two extremely safe pallets upstairs (and potentially three if one spawns near the stairs) and two downstairs that lead into multiple vaults.
---
The fact alone that those pallets are fixed on those tiles makes that the best looping spot on any map.
---
Catch me with perkless Freddy at rank one üò§
---
Oh and there it is someone pull out the the fire works and we have it the I think you need a break from the game because fuck me right I‚Äôm not allowed to question a very anti fun build so I ‚Äúshould take a break from the game and the internet‚Äù the biggest middle finger you give to someone in an argument oh how I love this community anyone questions anything that is anti fun and there will aways be somebody to tell them they are wrong 
---
it's a rave
---
fine.
---
\-Um... whatcha got there?
---
\-\*pig sounds\*
---
Lol
---
I've never had such a silly bug in all my time playing tbh.

A situational insta heal isn‚Äôt healthy :). Never said certain perks don‚Äôt need buffs but this is a crappy buff

dont even show his face in a place like this

Lightweight is your best bet against spirits
---
It would be a nice something that at least every devotion level you go up you get either 1k shards or maybe 500k BP.
---
did you buy it
---
We should get a 100 AC for every devotion or atleast 1800-2000 shards. 
---
the devs said that no mither is a hard mode for survivors and its actually super useful in sabo builds. It doesnt need a change 
---
But those aren‚Äôt meme builds they are actual builds that are very unfun to play against and I get survivors whining about them I go in and say a fact that this build is in counter able unless you have Hangman‚Äôs and you have to start telling me I‚Äôm wrong for being mad at a build that is anti fun by most definitions so I‚Äôm not allowed to have an opinion or dislike a build I guess fuck me 
---
Meme Builds are in try hard builds that can be fun to both play against and play these builds I stated are not meme builds they are not fun for the receiving end a meme build possibly would be something like Vault Master Myers but even that can feel unfun or Bloodpoints builds for any side 
---
What are you on about? I was making a joke bud. 
---
And they are seemingly only "post-vault" after the *entire* animation. It's a very well-known fact that a killer can swing at a window before the survivor has fully vaulted it and get a hit, even if the survivor seems to be on the other side. In my opinion, window vaults have THE absolute worst hitboxes in the game. 
---
Run iron will , try to avoid running on grass and try to lose her by not leaving scratchmarks 
---
Actually I wanted to change Mither because of sabo builds XD I hated the fact that the sabo builds had zero counter play XD 
---
wat
---
As survivor i will rarely if ever flame the killer. My team is a whole other talk. Cause my god, if i hear you spew toxicity at a killer who didnt do anything wrong i will side with him no matter what. 
---
Good point it would also get rid of those shitty anti fun sabo builds 
---
You can never tell in this subreddit 
---
this makes me sad.

Mom's calling is OP and kills any hiding skills

I'm terrible at rebalance but I like this idea

I only do it to greet other survivors, or if i'm playing Pig and survivors are at the exit gate.
---
You can take screenshots on PS4. 
---
I'm poor myself soo... 
---
As Freddy would say, "D A R N".
---
&gt;‚Äã
---
yeah, i need some pliers. thank you very much!
---
Seems like someone got their butt stabbed too many times 
---
When the killer doesn't want to lose their Chaser emblem to "Proximity to hooked survivors" 
---
It is
---
I'd take out sloppy butcher for predator and bbq and Chile or something to slow the game down.
---
Your point being?
---
... That's your bonus BP you're looking for, dude.
---
That would literally be a buff to his tracking ability tho.
---
I want it so bad...:)
---
I like Predator but at the same time, this build gets me consistent 3/4ks. It's better to track blood right now because scratch marks are so inconsistent due to the new update.
---
Tutorial meg lmfaooo
---
What's the new update?
---
Competition stands for rivalty between multiple protagonist for the same objective. 
---
Football is competitive, so is league of legends.
---
Dbd is asymetrical, it's not "competitive". Calling a casual game this way, by using tunneling, and self called "optimals" strategies, is just toxic. Think about that ;)
---
No I'm saying that It literally does nothing for the pig. Ofc you can search al the boxes within the time. But this ultra-rare does not help the pig at all
---
Discordance is also really really good on Spirit and I can snag at least one person off a gen in the beginning.
---
This early in the morning, I was just like "whatever". Should have gotten up and made some breakfast lol. 
---
The Unreal engine update
---
It's not that I need bloodpoints it's that I feel like some sort of payoff for limiting yourself would be nice.
---
Otherwise would you belive that I also heard about cakes and partystreamers? 
---
That's my point.
---
Skeleton key?
---
dont know why we all 3 got so many downvotes xD
---
Still too underpowered. PC or console should blow up. 
---
This guy is talking about giving bl an half insta. 
---
What does it have to do with scratch marks?
---
Interesting how David's perks all synergize with each other then. Also, No Mither is specifically designed to not be viable.
---
Interesting on the killers thing! If u hit red rank you could do something cool with that 
---
I'm saving up shards for legion for that exact reason
---
Perks: monitor and abuse, enduring, spirit fury, bamboozle.  Add ons: J. Myers memorial, dead rabbit.  Makes u the classic jump scare Myers while being an absolute beast in chases. Can be problematic if you don‚Äôt get the ball rolling early by getting tier three ready late because of no ruin but if you can get a hook in reasonable time then you‚Äôll be real powerful
---
Yea, there was 1 gen left and two roaming around, I downed one and went for the other and found them nearby just standing right by the hatch.
---
My perks were:
---
Brutal Strength
---
Make Your Choice
---
Whispers
---
Shadowborn
---
Thanks a lot. I'll give it a shot. Good advice so far 
---
It made the scratch marks inconsitent and really hard to see. It should be fixed with the upcoming patch
---
Unlucky 
---
Yeah. That sneaky boi is healing himself. He didn‚Äôt end up getting me though, someone else did. We had a Nurse with Nurses calling. So off he went!
---
You are either absolutely terrible as killer or you have never faced a non potato Legion. The killer is broken, especially with Franks Mixtape. The hits aren't BS, but how you go down is. That's what makes him frustrating compared to other killers.
---
Yeah I leveled Legion specifically for Discordance lol
---
Tbf Running Dead By Daylight already makes my PS4 explode 
---
It gives ‚Äúhaving crows feet‚Äù a whole new meaning. 
---
It¬¥s an opinion of mine and if you feel like downvoting me while being the hot-air merchant of the year is neccessary than so be it. Sorry for wasting your time.
---
Even Freddy will get nightmares after watching this
---
Get those bps
---
*you're going into the car next*
---
Beautiful‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è, I can't believe it xD. Trapper x Meg for when? 
---
Bad idea. It already takes a very long time for people to die, this would only punish legitimate players even more. As it is now, when I play survivor I can do almost a full gen and still save someone before they die.
---
After this I'm done speaking to you about your made up scenarios and cherry picked topics for an argument that isnt valid to begin with.
---
Every match is different. Lets use this scenario for an example. 
---
The 4th might already be dead because he looped the killer all game and got face camped. Someone gets slugged by noed on the way to the gate. The other 2 are at the gate trying to open it. They over commit by taking turns since the gate is at 90% done. Boom, 4 kills rewarded for the killers bad game play and lack of any skill.
---
Have fun manufacturing bullshit to fit some made up naritive you have. I'm out.
---
When there's an afk killer I usually do all the gens, totems, chests and try to get bold points. But T-bagging doesn't really give bold points and flicking flaslights also doesn't. 
---
They tried that. People always had one member of the team loop in an area near the hook so that all 5 gens would be finished by the other 2 while the killer got 0 points.
---
Your coming from a good place, wanting a competitive environment for the players and all, but I do have a couple problems with your post here.
---
First, the complaint about the timeslot: Admittedly Tuesday nights are not ideal, and it does leave out most of our Euro bros, but for a small organization running events for more than one game this could just be a scheduling issue. Their regular admins might be too busy with other games on the weekend to also run DBD tournaments in the same timeslot, and they probably have normal day jobs that would prevent them from running it at a time more suitable to both NA and EU players. Furthermore, the problem for EU players being left out could be fairly easily addressed by splitting it into two Weekly Rituals, one dedicated to NA and one dedicated to EU, both with their own prize pool. Which they might have already considered doing, but could have been unable to generate enough cash to fund two large prize pools.
---
Which leads nicely into the next problem I have in regards to your complaint about the prizepool size. Yeah, it sucks that the prizepool is kinda small, but that's also par for the course for games with a small competitive scene. The goal of the prizes in a tournament like this isn't to provide the players with a full on paycheck. It's just to provide a non-zero monetary incentive for teams to show up every week. And i think its blatantly false to claim money is the only reason people want to show up. Maybe players just want something more competitive than the normal ladder because it's fun for them or because they want to test their own skills. Maybe they want to participate just for the sake of growing the esport. Money might be YOUR only motivation, but it's hard to claim that it's the only motivator for everyone else as well.
---
Also regarding money, your post is appears to be a bit misleading as the total prizepool is listed as 5k, 2500 per platform. This also shows that they're trying to include as much of the player base as they can.
---
Also, correct me if I'm wrong but the tournament appears to have no entry fee, which is particularly impressive given the total prizepool is 5 grand, and makes your complaints about the prize sizes seem particularly whiny.
---
I won't comment on map selection, as I dont have a particular opinion on this matter.
---
The Marth88 comments seem unprofessional, but you might want to link to a screenshot or vod or some kind of evidence to back up your complaint. You are directly calling them out here, which can harm their reputation, and i find doing so without the proper proof a bit distasteful.
---
Feel free to correct any errors I've made in my assessment. I'll happily correct my post if need be.
---
I don't think so, it seemed like a new killer who wants everyone to have fun by only killing on second hook, maybe because they hate getting moried as surv
---
They punish for camping by ranking points so if survivor is 16m from the hook killer don't lose points they can't do that with countdown? 
---
I'm not angry when surv DC when I play killer. Means I do my job right.
---
What is this?Low effort meme?Shitpost?Dumb survivors being dumb survivors?
---
Not trying to be toxic but I legitimately have no idea what you just said; can you reword that?
---
This comment downvoted by survivor mains 
---
I complained when the nurse came out as she defies all game mechanics and the ones who master her are truly op and are next to impossible to win against. Buttttttt she requires a lot of skill to play well blabla
---
The legion is the most boring killer to play against. Get hit, mend, gen. Get hit, gen, mend. Get tunneled, go down. Wait to get rescued. Blablabla
---
ALWAYS, whenever I prestige and accidentally put it on! I ALWAYS forget.
---
Got plenty of video footage of them TPing and stuttering along which is basically like a speed boost...this is nothing new there are videos on youtube of this. So yea...
---
Beat me to it
---
Killer lose points when they stay near hook (16m) 
---
Look at nurse lmao
---
Replace Sprint Burst with Ebony Mori, me last night. Three times. üò•
---
They should also increase the point killers get by stanging near a hooked survivor by a whole lot more just to discourage it even more
---
Combine it with Agitation and Iron Grasp and its pretty decent.
---
Most killers I play to 4k, but I'm happy as long as I get a lot of interaction with survivors even if they all escape (and I get brutal killer at least).
---
When I play Legion I don't really try or care. I actually just want a boatload of bloodpoints, which he is oddly good at getting with zero effort.
---
But if your point is "legion isn't the only unfun mechanic in the game" doesn't change that legion is unfun.
---
Ideally, getting hit should apply a global VAC/Console Ban, disable the fans on the PC or Console, and then run a stress test until it bursts into flames.
---
But BHVR is too survivor sided to give us the buffs we need :(
---
And people still play him.  I've been keeping my DC game strong, and the legions keep decreasing in number (doctors too).  The killers are learning.  I salute you, killers.
---
2 ppl left you down one and go find the other one instead of hooking the first one, correct me if I'm wrong
---
Yeah. And insidious if you wanna camp and be toxic üòÇ
---
what does that have to do with borrowed time
---
I haven't seen a single game all week where someone doesn't decide to just outright dc the second they see the deep wound status.
---
ya honestly I feel the same
---
True that she is the best part
---
Well they should have made a better game then.
---
Good on you, dude. Don't be one of the plebs that plays easy killers like Nurse and Billy because they're too bad to play something else.
---
Thank you random stranger!
---
I still hate him
---
I still find it funny how people think gen rushing is a thing, when its the survivor only objective in the game.  That's like a killer hooking survivor, hook rushing?  haha
---
The point of the killer is to kill everyone  at any cost, and the point of the survivor is to escape at any cost. If that means using NOED and DS then so be it. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs not counters to each one. You can counter DS with Enduring, and you can counter NOED with Hope. 
---
Or you can even cancel NOED with DS if you wait to use it until the Exits are open. 
---
Why would you put my boy Herman in the same group as this edgelord.
---
He didn't go to medical school just to get this kind of disrespect!
---
I‚Äôm not sure why the negativity came up almost instantly in killer and survivor mains. Imo just play the game and have fun!! Legion takes a different strategy to play on both sides, just learn how to play him/against him and have fun!! 
---
10/10 would love to be chased but give him a maraca in the empty hand too. Nothing would be more terrifying then seeing Miguel stand behind you shaking a maraca whilst stalking you. 
---
Yea stupid survivor mains not having perfect connection.
---
Deliverance buff
---
+1000 Boldness
---
idk why you'd quit just bc of bad survivors though :/
---
always find it funny when people complain about survivors not leaving yet you make no effort to force them out, you say you don‚Äôt care that he wasted time, yet you clearly do because you made a reddit post. obviously he‚Äôs an idiot for sitting there, but you could‚Äôve played a whole extra game in that time.
---
I don‚Äôt think he actually went to med scho-*Loud zap*
---
Rank reset was yesterday. Don't bother playing for a few days
---
I also see a lot of people say he has no counter... which... isn't really true... You can still make the Legion loose sight of you since he can't see the scratch marks... you can still juke him... he can still get pallet stunned. But whatever, each to their own I guess
---
Oh god please don't encourage people to play Freddy. Getting tunneled the entire game is unfun and boring as hell and that's all Freddy's do
---
Legion's probably worse if they aren't moonwalking or use mixtape tbh
---
Oh for sure.  It's also a mentality thing though.  When I play survivor, I always let a killer know when they do great, without the hate.  But yeah, when I'm hated on, I take it as a compliment. Just not all to used to actual compliments. Lol
---
Noed Myers oof 
---
Salty DC?  It depends... At the end of the game I don't get it, but at the beginning/middle it's the only power survivors have over a killer... They can make sure you don't get as many points.  It sucks for everyone, but when you're rank 10 survivor then rank reset hits, you understand because anyone who has experienced rank reset as a noob survivor has been to hell.  I can't play for like a week right now.
---
It‚Äôs just leaving a survivor in the dying state instead of hooking them. Doesn‚Äôt matter how many people are left. 
---
She‚Äôs been taking lessons from John Marston
---
there are two..
---
..kinds of people
---
Yeah, I agree. He does need changes to make him more fun for others to play as and against...
---
lmfao i love it. her boxes kinda give her away though :( 
---
I know this is just a meme and a pretty funny one. But I\m pretty sure once you use on DS they all get used.
---
Right I don't even play legion but I still bought her
---
I don‚Äôt play billy cuz I don‚Äôt find him fun, and Nurse is just no on console. Plus I love ANOES and love Freddy as a horror movie villain. He‚Äôs too special for you. 
---
i hope you realise that console hardware is just worse than pcs, so even if the game was as optimised as pc on console you would still get less fps. if you‚Äôre gonna take a console over a pc then don‚Äôt complain about having less fps than a pc.
---
Try nancy's masterpiece with green dress for addons. Injure someone then go off to sleep / injure the others. You'll 3 or 4k after 20 minutes most games, unless they can do 3 gens right at the start.
---
Or...both
---
I‚Äôm still experimenting with my builds, but I‚Äôll have to try it. I would use class photo more often but the longer dream transition is something I‚Äôm not a fan of. I like to get into the chase as soon as possible. 
---
Every 5 games my loading screen freezes.  A quick restart will snatch those bloody party streamers you threw and everything will be fine!
---
I wish
---
Even then, legion can still be a M1 killer and be effective while Freddy has to use his power to even interact with survivors. 
---
Bubba doesn't go up basement stairs.
---
I wish this worked. The first time its used on then it will work, then they know to prepare for it.
---
Still its just swinging wildly in the hope that they will miss, its pathetic really. DS needs to go.
---
1.) You're the one using made up scenarios
---
2.) this is an entirely new scenario where someone is already dead, but if the killer is facecamping someone this is a massive waste of their time. Good news for the survivors.
---
3.) if someone gets slugged on their way to the gate you should realise if he is nearby and if he has noed. You should be leaving if he is near, if he isn't nearby or picks up the survivor the door is open and you've escaped.
---
4.) grouping together on a single door with an active noed is a mistake for the survivors. If someone is opening a door near you you should be hiding.
---
5.) over committing is another mistake on the survivors' part. 
---
6.) I don't use any totem perks.
---
NoED is a strong perk, it has to be. If a hex totem isn't strong it isn't worth the risk of it being destroyed. However it is possible to switch up your playstyle to counter it. Or you could bring perks to counter totems. Or you could cry more about it.
---
They can both be the best 
---
No0b3 is one of the best survivors in the game.Zubat is great but not even close to noob3
---
Thank you! This is very helpful!
---
Scott would like to have a word.
---
It's a dead perk after the exhaustion nerf imo.
---
Is this all happening in your games? Sounds like a problem with your connection honestly. 
---
The PTB is on right now. If you mean the full update it should be around the end of this month
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
I just started playing Myers and didnt have many choices. Bamboozle was just something fun to throw in there too.
---
Photoshop probably
---
that‚Äôs how noed works
---
i‚Äôm so sorry about the quality y‚Äôall but honestly this game was wild to spectate 
---
It doesn't matter what his ability is or is strenghts or weaknesses - I. Want. To. Play. Him. NOW!
---
If you don‚Äôt have many choices that‚Äôs fine. May I suggest a combo of Monitor and Nurses for the future? I play Myers a lot an it helps quite often in my experience. 
---
I figured I'd get buried with downvotes. I just don't like that a large portion of killers try to play fair and just get abused for it by design. The game is not balanced for coordinated squads, and the devs aren't going to do anything about it until those squads have trouble getting games. I don't want easy wins all the time, but I also feel like it should be a choice to play a match at a potentially massive disadvantage against a 4 man SWF. 
---
My bad
---
If legion wants you dead he will stab you until you are down and thats just not fun. At least you can do something against hillbilly or outjuke a nurse
---
Twice in the last week I started my game to be asked to agree to EULA before presented with a rank reset. All surv and killers are back at level 1 until I close dbd and reload at which point my levels return but my rank is still reset. I made it back to rank 1 between these resets only to be presented with a third legit rank reset yesterday.
---
‚ÄúWilhelm Ulysses Zeppffenhain was born to a noble family in Germany during the Renaissance. Wilhelm had always dreamed of honor and combat, listening to his father's stories of duels and trials by combat. These stories left a very powerful impact on the impressionable young Wilhelm, his value for human life waned, he showed no empathy for human life at a relatively young age. When he was about 11, he gained a very strange obsession with honor and duels, he would make animals fight each other to the death; chickens and other animals would disappear from the village and then reappear several days later brutally killed with animalistic marks all over their bodies‚Ä¶ When Wilhelm was 21, he started to harass and challenge random people to duels at night, if they refused, he would kill them on the spot; he killed many innocent people in the name of ‚Äúhonor‚Äù. Wilhelm saw murder as sport, the thrill of combat was intoxicating; this was only the beginning of Wilhelm‚Äôs serial killing career‚Ä¶
---
When he was about 30, Wilhelm took his pass time to the next level. He would have his servants secretly abduct people, then he would make them fight to the death, promising them freedom if they could defeat the ladder of opponents. If they had killed all of their opponents, they would then face Wilhelm himself in a ‚Äúduel of epic proportions‚Äù. Wilhelm would fight in these gladiatorial duels for ‚Äúhonor and glory,‚Äù however, Wilhelm had a twisted and false sense of honor and did not fight fair; he would douse his rapier‚Äôs blade in poison and use hidden weapons such as daggers against his opponents. Wilhelm was also no slouch when it came to combat, he was trained in and was very talented at rapier fencing; it was impossible to beat Wilhelm, his skill and his tricks made sure of it. No one could beat Wilhelm at his own twisted game; even if they won the fight, they could not land a finishing blow on Wilhelm, he was always one step ahead of them; if they were even close to outmatching him, he would pull out his flintlock pistol and shoot them without hesitation‚Ä¶ 
---
One fateful night, a group of Wilhelm‚Äôs servants ambushed a married couple riding from a fair with the intent of adding them to Wilhelm‚Äôs dueling games, but the man was skilled in combat, deftly holding off the group of servants with a rapier and pistol. The husband managed to kill all of the servants expect one, whom the husband beat the information about Wilhelm‚Äôs duels out of‚Ä¶ The husband recruited a large group of men to go confront Wilhelm, but when they arrived at the castle, everyone was dead. Zeppffenhain family members, servants, and abducted ‚Äúduelists‚Äù all alike were found dead. Wilhelm was never officially seen and heard from again, although many people would claim to see him at the forests near Zeppffenhain Castle‚Ä¶‚Äù
---
Real Name: Wilhelm Ulysses Zeppffenhain
---
Weapon: The Duelist‚Äôs primary weapon, a worn rapier, is precise and elegant. This long blade makes quick work of the survivors, turning them into oversized pin cushions by the rapier‚Äôs sharp tip. What this character lacks in speed, it makes up in his weapon‚Äôs length and range. After hitting his opponent, The Duelist runs a single finger down the blade, cleaning the blood off‚Ä¶ 
---
Gender: Male
---
Ethnicity: Caucasian German
---
Speed: 96.25% | 3.85m/s
---
Realm: Zeppffenhain Castle- The Duelist lurks in the stormy crumbling ruins of the Zeppffenhain Castle‚Ä¶ The Zeppffenhain Castle is almost maze-like, with a lot of rooms and halls‚Ä¶ This maze-like map offers thrilling challenge for both the hunter and the hunted.
---
_____________________________________________
---
Ability: Cloak- After pressing an Alternate attack, the Duelist charges a cloak throw, that can be stopped. If the survivor gets hit by the cloak, they are temporarily blinded and stunned. A person can still run while trapped in the cloak, it just blinds them and slows them down for a relatively short amount of time. If the survivor is in a dying state, the cloak is a lot more effective; the survivor loses the ability to run, crouch, and crawl. 
---
Perks
---
Duelist‚Äôs Instinct- When a survivor is looking directly at the killer within a certain range, the killer receives an auditory hint in the survivor's direction. The range from which the survivor's gaze can be detected increases per tier.
---
Corruption- Shock and blood loss impair a survivor's ability to heal. After being hit by a killer's primary weapon, when the injured survivor attempts to heal or be healed, the success zone of their first skill check is considerably reduced, and the regression penalty for missing the skill check is increased. The skill check success zones and regression penalties become more difficult increasingly per tier.
---
Cheating- Pallets have become fragile, survivors jumping through pallets have a 15/30/50% chance of breaking the pallet. 
---
I just leave people on the ground to die.
---
I'll definitely try it out once they come down the BW 
---
At least Nea has some competition now.
---
each time legion hits a player with deep wound, the person playing also suffers a stabbing in the gut
---
Last game I played Freddy and decided to be nice and went away after every hook to chase someone else (despite getting several basement hooks). 2 hooked everyone but all the survivors managed to get away even though I could definitely have gotten at least a 2k if I had actually tunnelled or camped a little bit.
---
I got teabagged at the exit gates followed by "gg ez" in chat.
---
I mean, if survivors want killers to follow their imaginary rules, maybe they shouldn't taunt 'em when they do so? Because that's a guaranteed way to make sure they worn't be *nice* in the future.
---
I still the entire issue of tunneling and camping in this game is a problem with gamedesign, and not the attitude of the community. The game does very little to discourage killers from patrolling hooked survivors, and going after the same survivor repeatedly. The game should be encouraging people to play in a way that makes it enjoyable for all parties, but it doesn't.
---
WOAH this killer sounds fucking sweet!
---
and to remove the injured state music, that stuff gets old and annoying quick
---
I got so used to not running self care for a while that when I put it back on I forgot about it and the amount of times I could have healed myself and lived are too many to admit. :\
---
On a side note: to the meg I tried to save while forgetting I took off borrowed time, RIP. :(
---
Few people are willing to subject themselves to the horror that is playing Hag anywhere past rank 10.
---
yes, you are.
---
For the purpose of this thread, nobody in their right mind gives a flying fuck.
---
Removed for salty after game chat 
---
I'd rather go against Purple Calm/Order or Iri Head doctor 10 times in a row than a single mixtape legion
---
HNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGG
---
MY HEART!  SO...CUTE!
---
None of the killers are scary tbh when you play this game almost daily like I do.. 
---
I'm impressed by how quick the dc was
---
Dat booty is tight.
---
Eh, I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre about equal.
---
I think Balanced Landing is better. It's activatable on almost every single map and you won't get a sprint when you loop the killer around double t-walls. 
---
In reguards to the 5k or 2.5k pool, it's listed as a 2.5k pool in their graphics. I do think that it isn't good to combine the two platforms as they are different tournaments. I will be adding screenshots as well soon of the Marth comment.
---
I do understand that they are a smaller organization that may not have the freedom to plan what they want, but it would've been benificial had they done 6 instead of 12, while also doing it on proper dates. People both in the company and out do have jobs and other commitments, which is frustrating if you can't make due to such commitments. 
---
I appreciate the comment.
---
# YES, THEY ARE HERE, THE FOUR HORSEMAN
---
This is what makes the game fun!!! 
---
Unless you have a giant stick up your butt....
---
I have 4 of them.  Two of them have a gtx 950 and a gtx 680.   The game runs better on both of them than in my ps4 pro.
---
It runs great on my main pc, but so does everything else.
---
That‚Äôs all beside the point.  The way the game runs on console, they should be embarrassed.
---
why does insidious go well with legion
---
Personally I think they're a ton of fun to fight, at least in my limited experience fighting against them. Running for your life, with the killer hot on your heels? Exhilarating! The fact that it doesn't really have consequences if you get caught kinda makes it less interesting, but the rush of getting chased combined with the almost guaranteed escape is pretty nice imho
---
amen
---
I doubt I can change your mind, but I do want to vent a little bit about all the survivors DCing against legion.
---
Please. Stop DCing. Half the time this happens I'm left 1 or 2v1ing a new Legion that my teammates could have kited if they weren't garbage at the game and bothered to stay and learn instead of DC. "No counterplay" and "takes no skill" are hyperbole, and it's making you look like idiots when you DC on sight from a Legion that I can kite for like 90 seconds at a time, and I'm a bad survivor.
---
literally only idiots think they need a buff or any skill. 
---
What if he doesn‚Äôt care about points? Some people just want to get kills and don‚Äôt care, 2 gens were done whilst I was running and whilst I was hooked but I really don‚Äôt think he minds
---
I do something similar while streaming. I'm still out of shape so I don't do much. I base it off the 4 categories. If I hit irridescent I win the category. Each category that I lose I do either 7 situps, 5 squats, or 3 pushups. Not much but over 3 hours it adds up daily! Starting to sprinkle in other exercises, if you have any suggestions let me know! Planks might be a good start.
---
For christ sake Thanathofobia isnt a good perk
---
Do you mind explaining why?
---
in that case your only Options are hoping for someone with Borrowed time or multiple persons body blocking for you
---
I play on Xbox and haven‚Äôt had this happen fortunately. 
---
why would anyone try to make this game an esport?
---
"duuuuuuud"
---
Gotta use those Christmas gifts. 
---
Pig main here. Not mad at all that Myers is the best of the best stealth killers. Dude has absolutely no terror radius with monitor and abuse and dead rabbits. 8m standard terror radius without perks and add-ons. Some can argue that pig has 0 TR when crouched but I'm not spending my time crouched around the whole map and mid chase. üòë
---
OwO stalk me daddy Myers
---
The longer you stay around a hooked survivor to get last chaser points, an emblem that a camping killer won't have a lot of in the first place, and pipping is still useless
---
Gen rushing only works if your team even knows youre being camped, on solo all you can do is flail your arms, a sign that survivors won't always understand
---
When I play legion I know im probably not gonna hook anyone, so I aim to make points in another category.
---
I did as well til I read disconnect, twice. Lol
---
or you Kindred.
---
And pipping has the same more use than BP for some People 
---
With that Slugging Feels Goodman 
---
ayy lmao
---
LEGION IS SHIT. HE'S THE REASON I MAIN KILLER
---
Nothing really wrong with juggling but standing next to the hook is pretty mean
---
bruh i had a fucking panic attack looking at the last one. truly the entities best asset.
---
Hey, what's the deal with this? You mentioned the number four, do you want me to die? Three is fine. Five is fine. But when you're in the presence of the number four something bad will happen!
---
I'm kind of paranoid when Laurie isn't the obsession... or there are multiple Lauries.
---
haunted grounds is basically a trick hex. if you cleanse it every survivor gets exposed for 60 seconds. He‚Äôs going down there because he‚Äôs gonna cleanse it...
---
TOOL!
---
i hate map control type killers. there ability's are EXTREMELY useful but it is VERY situational. i like killers that have a near useless ability, but its still practical (like doctor or legion, or even nurse)
---
Use a perk just to not be camped when you can only run 4 perks. Gr8. Also killer can stand out of kindered range
---
Pipping is useless, just because some people wanna flaunt their rank doesnt mean it's still useful. Pips are just a matchmaking tool that attempts to put players around the same skill level together (which it does fail on) bp is a tool used to earn perks, addons and offerings. We all know which is more useful
---
I don't care. If I want high level killer play I watch Zubat. Scott is fine and if he needs a crosshair whatever. Dude has to make a living somehow. 
---
Seems wrong but its approved. 
---
lol gig connection...that makes it the survivor 
---
Some killer main posted about how he was using netlimiter the other day to kill games.
---
why exactly do you regret it?
---
ok? I never really said anything about skill or anything like that... Just stating that I like playing as them :/
---
when I have a gig fiber connection...anyone who lags is an exploiter in my eyes.
---
Dumb question, but did you actually have enough bloodpoints? The top is cropped off
---
What‚Äôs that? Never heard of it tbh 
---
teleporting
---
I can't believe I didn't notice that. That's kind of cool, I hope it was intentional from the devs. 
---
i mean, in the end it's using a 3rd party program to gain an advantage. Classify that however you want. 
---
Regardless of it's detectability by BHVR/EAC, I don't see it as any different then people who use stuff like NVIDIA Freestyle to make the game as bright as possible or counteract the effects of fog.
---
He can do whatever he wants, but I have infinitely more respect for players who attain their skills without using such methods.
---
Rule 3, if you say I'm not mad, you're probably mad. 
---
then they live far away lmao, i‚Äôve been getting high ping games sometimes and i‚Äôm not ‚Äúabusing latency‚Äù, in fact, lag favours the killer, so why exactly would survivors want high ping
---
He said "op for tunneling" and he's kinda right, against Freddy you can't really escape thanks to his built-in aura reading, you can only buy as much time as you can.
---
Jumpscares feel so good though... Myers has to run a pretty specific build to get them, and even then it's subpar, but Pig gets them as a core part of her playstyle.
---
doesnt happen all the time but i see it alot at rank 1...never at rank 10-20. Guess cause those people dont care to pull all the stops to win and actually play to have fun...
---
I have a gig fiber connection..1GB up 1GB down...anyone lagging in my servers is either from asia or they are exploiting
---
Imagine Hillbilly chainsaw sprinting past you as you hear 'All Star' fade in, then out.
---
I feel this post in my bones. I always get the assumptions I must be running DS with her but I don't run DS on nobody lol
---
That's how it works with Last Year the Nightmare and honestly I think it makes the game more fun and light hearted.
---
Ruin would be great because people tend to run around looking for ruin instead of doing Gens
---
13th of every month.
---
I work in IT...so I know how basic networking works...where do you work?
---
Just because it's asymmetrical doesn't mean it can't or shouldn't be played competitively. The game uses a rank based system and you gain ranks based on your performance as either a survivor or a killer. If the game was truly casual there wouldn't be much point for the ranking system to exist, nor would BHVR try to promote e-sports tournaments for it.
---
Even if the game was casual, using the most effective and optimal strategies (as dirty as some might be) to win is not toxic behaviour. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's toxic.
---
Flip that diagram, upside down. 
---
Not even a little, no. Being a good killer is more than just hitting god-tier hatchets, Scott has great instincts &amp; isn't afraid to say when he's fucked up or could have handled something better.
---
You shouldn't need a perk to counter a strategy that is often considered toxic and one that just makes you sit there, doing nothing but waiting for your inevitable demise
---
I guarentee many more people need the bp for perks/p3 level 50-ing people then the amount of people who have all perks in the game
---
And kindered doesnt even counter it. All the killer has to do is stand slightly further, and there's still the fact that your team does power through gens, because there are still a lot of people who will attempt the save.
---
Generally, you want the game design to incentivize leaving the hooks to pursue other survivors, and going for the 3-hook instead of 1-hooking people.
---
The way it is now, camping pretty much guarantees a 2k and a pip, and it's really not too hard to push that 2k to a 3 or 4.
---
Other things they could do is give a sort of base kindred effect, to show when the killer is camping, or a system to slow hook progression when the killer is near.
---
Honestly though, I'd be happy if they just made it more penalizing to your pips, so I wouldn't have to see so much of it in the red ranks.
---
It means they aren't doing gens so as far as it's concerned I love them following me around tbh
---
Yeah I cant wait to see the actual skill of a large portion of killers once dedicated servers drop. I think these people talking shit are going to have a big struggle period when learning about latency on their end. Then the mass of lag switchers are going to get 0 kills.
---
not all of them. and lag only favors the killer if its on their end and its horrendous 300+ latency
---
when survivors are pulling high latency they are jumping all over the map...stuttering visually. It make them harder to hit and gives them a "speed boost"
---
You‚Äôre not getting what I‚Äôm saying here, I‚Äôm saying that someone is saying to give a half insta to bl. So anything I read could either be someone serious or not 
---
netlimiter manages how much bandwidth is flowed to a certain application.
---
Now all you need is balanced landing a and a game offering znd its perfect 
---
The winter gifts could give you ebony moris, [I got 50 during the blood hunt](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/945094122219973122/3A83E5153135D9A075D06993B21AF0CFEC568FCF/)!
---
Yeah, I can actually see this being more balanced. I don‚Äôt mind the state it is in now either. I just don‚Äôt like the groans and grunts I have to hear every few secs. 
---
I've actually won way more today than I have collectively the past 2 weeks (by won I mean my teams have managed to actually power the exit gates as opposed to just dying like scrubs)
---
This sounds like the start of a copypasta.
---
Lmao
---
If you have two brain cells you'd still be able to tell that I was joking by saying that Wake Up and Fire Up are op
---
Alright mate relax 
---
Okay I love the map idea of the killer, a castle with a bunch of maze-like halls and rooms sounds bad ass. But the perks just sound like variants of other perks already in the game. Also the killer power just sounds like the clowns power, but with a thrown cloak instead of the poison gas or whatever it is that the clown throws. I'm a bit confused when you say that the cloak blinds and stuns the survivor, because you say also that they can still move, they're just blinded and slowed (even though you just said it stuns the survivor). And then you go on to say the cloak is more effective if they're in the dying state. How? "The survivor loses the abilitiy to run, crouch, and crawl (do you mean while in the dying state because they already can't run or crouch in the dying state)??? if the killer threw the cloak on you, and it prevented you from running, crouching, or crawling, and the killer is after you, then why would you crouch anyways, like you might have urban evasion but what good would it do if the killer is on your ass. Do you mean you can't move entirely or that you can only walk. (Again I'm confused bc you said it stuns survivors at one part and said it slows them at another park, and now you're saying either that it stuns them bc they lose all ability to move, or if they can still walk, then it's different entirely because either it slows them and causes their running speed to become their walking speed for a duration OR it makes anything other than walking unusable for a period of time.
---
Duelist's Instinct is decent but it's basically like the killer's version of spine chill. Which wouldn't be bad, but honestly might be a bit overpowered if it gives you an auditory queue in the direction of where the survivor is, it could be a nice tracking perk.
---
Corruption just sounds like a worse version of unnerving presence, and I get it might be different bc its only for healing and maybe it doesnt proc on the survivor until they try to heal, even if they're out of the killers range (unlike unnerving presence), but sometimes you don't even get skill checks while healing so if this was to work, I feel like it would have to be something more like overcharge where it forces you to skill check on your first heal/being healed. As of now, this just seems too much like unnerving presence, but worse to be of any use imo though.
---
Cheating is a cool idea, but with spirit fury added to the game now, I'm not sure that this perk could check out. It would stack way too well with spirit fury and basically make pallets obsolete, because if killers ran both, every single pallet dropped/vaulted over would basically disappear almost immediately. But idk it would also take up another perk slot so killers would have to choose to sacrifice some other perk to take both spirit fury and cheating, so maybe it wouldn't be horrible. 
---
I also think the killer is wayyyyyyy too slow. Like if his power is stunning and blinding the victims hit that makes sense bc higher move spd would make them way too strong with a stun and high move spd. But if it's just slowing them like the clown then that move speed needs a change, like to the same speed as the clown. 115% aka 4.6m/s.
---
Also I love that you pointed out that he has a long weapon, so maybe his lunge could be the best out of all of the killers, it would be cool to see an extremely long lunge and could go really well with this slow speed of his that you've suggested, as long as other areas of his power are made clear/tweaked.
---
Sorry for the extremely long reply I just wanted to talk about what I thought of the killer and killer perk's designs.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know that before I worked in IT I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.

A well played Freddy is an op Freddy. 
---
Take that guy's complain as a compliment
---
I've mentioned this before, but I had a Nurse during double bloodpoints who slugged all 4 of us on a Coldwind map when 5 people (yes, including the Nurse) played Bloody Party Streamers. She made no effort to hook anyone, and there were no obsession perks in play so no risk of DS. She just let us all bleed out on the ground at 5 gens to go. THAT was toxic, and still not reportable. You're fine.
---
More Decisive than evidence in a Phoenix Wright case.

I dislike scottjund. I have never seen a streamer dc more than him and all of his complaints. The kid might get a few okay shots or games but I strongly dislike his content.

Ah but have you seen the way Myers just stares at you as he brutally rams a knife through you? Case closed.
---
Hey now those are solid perks
---
And Philip. My angel. He wanted to stop a murderer
---
A casual mode will not work for this game for two reasons:
---
1. The game doesn't have a large enough player-base to split the community like that. You want longer queue times? This is how you get longer queue times.
---
2. If competitive mode had no swf, than what killer would \*ever\* play casual? Ever killer ever would only play competitive. None would play casual. No SWF AND rank rewards? Yes, please!
---
And these words were put in the holy book of dead by daylight
---
It should be part of her base kit honestly. Only time it helped me is when I got sent to swamp and they refused to do any gens so all four were trapped and running around like headless chickens.
---
Well I hook but when they are 4 man swf they just body block the hook.
---
I agree with you. Problem is, people who camp don't do it for the points. Only idiots do it for a steady 2k and to rank up (because there's no reward in ranking up aside from longer queues). I'd imagine most people who camp either do it because
---
1) they don't know any better - punishing them for this isn't going to make them understand any faster.
---
2) they just want to ruin someone elses game. I can't think of a possible way to punish someone for this, unless you just made the survivor completely invincible if they get camped.
---
You can still hit survivors through a window even if they aren‚Äôt vaulting
---
You definitely weren‚Äôt reset a week ago
---
I had about 230,000 bloodpoints.
---
Exactly. As long as no glitches, bugs or exploits are being used than I think it's fair game. I mean how is camping any more toxic than pallet looping or the way survivors react when they lose? I can't tell you how many times I get body blocked at my hooks so I can't hang up my survivor, which actually is against the rules... But you don't see me throwing a bitch fit about that.
---
You're the bomb.com!
---
Hmm. Well at least restarting fixed it
---
then ignore them and go for someone else. eventually we‚Äôll have dedicated servers and neither side can complain about lagswitching. personally, i‚Äôd rather have good ping and run the killer around than purposely have bad ping and hope that the killer doesn‚Äôt manage to hit me (which the killer just has to get close to do)
---
When a god like mighty entity promises revenge against your father who killed you and your family brutally, but all he's doing is making you kill some random salty kids.
---
The two safe pallets near the basement, and the two safe pallets in the room directly above it are the worst part. There are at least 5 other safe pallets that always spawn, as well.
---
The Game is just as bad as Thompson House if the survivors know how to loop.
---
4 sprint burst is better
---
Not every match is a 4 man swf. Why does everyone say that nowadays it's like the new meta excuse. I am usually on my phone during the loading screen and forget to check what items people brought it. I dont think it's that bad right now. Back when I first started killer it was rough with insta blinds, actual gen rushing, vacuum pallets, and actual infinites, but I could still not have an issue with teams. 
---
but any annoying survivor is counterable with enough skill and brain. while Legion in chase - not. 
---
I am personally offended by you saying killer mains don't enjoy something. you're literally with these words trying to find an excuse for using a broken killer. cause any Legion main or anyone enjoying playing them are not real killers. I do get playing them sometimes or using them to beat an obvious toxic swf but overall survivors just don't deserve it no matter how much I hate them. yes, as killer, I better be on survivor's side when it comes to Legion. 
---
If you need 3rd party programs to gain an advantage and make your hatchet throws good then you're probably not as good as you think you are in reality
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
There we go. That's the one I meant.
---
I think you're taking this a bit too seriously. I'm not obligated to have empathy for the other players, it's a game. If I'm playing like an asshole so be it, but I'm not breaking any rules or cheating in any way.
---
I just started playing a week ago, and I only play an hour or so every couple days. The reset this week has been hellish. I havent had a win since. I dont know why you're being downvoted.
---
That‚Äôs what I tried to do. Mix SH and dbd. Thank you! üòã
---
No üòé
---
Yes but when I'm talking about still applies when a killer lunges towards a window from a distance. That doesn't work without the survivor vault situation.
---
They should find a way to make SWF not effective it sucks
---
LOL
---
That is ab absolutely terrifying inventory, lol.
---
Bleeding survivors get a terror radius
---
I think a crosshair is pointless, after an hour I game you‚Äôre going to know where the hatchets are on the screen.
---
Regardless that makes him less skilled at Huntress.
---
I don't know why this is making me chuckle so much
---
Oof
---
no.
---
Deciding to use a Flashlight and playing with the objective of blinding the Killer, is indeed a strategy.
---
And Im also not the only one who considers that toxic if you look around
---
Everyone confirmed trash.
---
Does spine chill count?
---
Rank system only shows the amount of time played. I don't call performance making a gen and a save to safe pip, but to each his own I guess.

Uh...lmao no I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt plan on using his prestige weapon and I‚Äôm not gonna double prestige him for the mask and clothes so........ unless we get an actual reason for prestige outside of cosmetics, I‚Äôm good. 
---
Gotcha. üëç
---
I've had BL save me in a way that regular SB or Lithe couldn't have, but still on the fence about it as on some maps it's extremely situational - sometimes there just aren't enough places to actually make use of the perk and you can't stay around that one hill out in the open all game so it's a dead slot.
---
Just, do, totems. I think those work here. 
---
Wouldn't mind for every Devotion level you receive a 1% bonus to either Iridescent Shards, Bloodpoints, or XP
---
Or give us rewards for every Devotion Level, like Level 1-3 gives 300 Iridescent Shards, Level 4 gives 100 Auric Cells, then a cosmetic or big reward for Level 5, etc, etc.
---
They really suck If all of them cant get the flashlight save 
---
Deciding to use the flashlight to follow the killer around would be a strategy, timing a blind well during pick up is not a strategy, it's using an item well
---
Also the important part is that flashlights are counterable. The only way to counter a camper is to rush gens which doesn't actually counter camping it just punishes it, the same way that enduring doesnt counter ds, it just makes it easier to deal with.
---
Bad killers consider flashlights toxic, the fact that they are counterable is what makes them not toxic. The only way to fully counter a camper is to not get caught all match, which is basically impossible unless the killer is terrible and youre a god survivor. Kindered does not counter camping, as the person who is hooked is still dead. 
---
Then you see that P3 Claudette T-bagging you on the other side of a pallet and you no longer care about your past.
---
Only the future.
---
And future is murder
---
He doesn't.
---
And of course it was a wraith
---
Consoles have proprietary software they have to program around, this slows down development, bug fixing and optimization, consoles are just a pain in the ass all around to develop for, PCs are so much more flexible.
---
There is nothing wrong with using a crosshair. It provides no advantages except for long distance shots. I use a crosshair myself and still miss shots with it on.
---
Claudette with the red leather jacket on has spooked me way more than the actual Pig
---
Lol aww poor legion
---
Already works like this.
---
The Claudette still gets the stack btw. 2 if she actually manages to unhook you before you both get downed.
---
There are fun killers, than there's viable killers. One day I hope all will be viable.
---
omg jen and her whiteknights are coming &lt;3
---
Honestly a multiplier is much better.
---
Considering you need ~200h to get +1 devotion 500k BP is nothing. You can easily earn that in a few hours of gameplay.
---
Killer main here, but I tried playing survivor a bit this weekend. My thing is I simply can't escape from killers. I've lost track of so many survivors as killer, but I can't do those moves yet. And I'm not sure if I have the patience to learn them, as any time spent learning them is time spent not playing killer. 
---
The question is whether the rarer stuff in the bloodwebs is worth it or not - unless you're a Claudette and want to increase your stealth factor maybe. I've only started to prestige my original main survivor (not Claudette) recently, and probably won't be doing this for any second one anytime soon.
---
Been wondering for which killers it makes sense though - Nurse is more or less my main killer, but her add-ons other than the Green one for +1 Blink with no detergents are pretty dubious, never play with any - I'm not sure at which prestige level you get the most green add-ons, but I probably am going to leave her unless eventually I ran out of other things to put BP into.
---
sorry for bad chinese
---
I have two characters as P3, Adam and Freddy. Most of my other killers are going to be 50, Legion on the other hand I got to P2 50 because I got a mask cosmetic and don‚Äôt want to pick between the two. 
---
Uh yeah. Agree, spine chill is the shit
---
I would agree whole-heartedly with your assessment of Space Esports. I don't know if I necessarily agree that the map-voting thing is entirely busted.  
---
But I'm glad to see someone showing how childish Marth can act. A lot of people turn a blind-eye to how actually toxic some of the big names in this game are. I'm not saying, "last time I checked this is a tournament of COMPETITORS, not worry warts," is any kind of insult or anything. It just shows he can't be bothered to formulate coherent points on 95% of the subjects on which he tries to speak with authority.    
---
Just wait a week tbh, by then most of the high rank players will be back in the higher ranks.
---
This isn't no buff. The devs are trying to pass this off as buffs when it already does this! This is outrages!
---
Honestly anything would be better than the creeping realization you‚Äôre about to loop back around and get nothing. 
---
Oof is right lol
---
Spine Chill is my totally crutch perk that helps me escape a chase before it starts. 
---
It's almost like he's curious to see what would happen if he stuck his knife in your chest, despite having done it many times before.
---
You misspelled Doctor.
---
is that a private match?
---
That's because they reworked BT to give deep wounds instead of a timer
---
I just grabbed someone two days ago as trapper tho without hopping on PC...
---
Wow great, so barbecue isn't even a good perk on him anymore, gg how am I supposed to farm bloodpoints with legion now, fucking devs, no idea how to balance this shit game.
---
Yes, sorry pig. You're stun noise though is adorable 
---
Its a crutch perk for killers that can't apply pressure during the match.Either way cleanse totems when you see them because every other match there's gonna be noed.
---
There actually used to be a glitched patch (Before the exhaustion update) where you could get 4 of one perk. You were un-catch-able end game with 4 hopes and un-catch-able all game with 4 sprint bursts. However, using one DS would consume all DS's. You  could also have a team of 4 run 4 Ace luck perks. Oh, and you could be a nurse with a chainsaw or a Myers with the ability to blink and no body for your head. That patch was a LOT of fun.
---
That's all *bad* Freddys do.  People who treat people as a tunneling machine are definitely the same people that stack blocks and complain that he's a worse wraith.  I want to encourage people to *learn* Freddy's strengths and weaknesses, since he has a really unique playstyle.
---
I don't SWF, but I did love it when killers would ignore people doing gens and go for the plant people during the last event. Thanks, killer! /s
---
Beauty has a face and it is this meme

That's nothing

You are ascended far above anything I could hope to reach.
---
I agree, Freddy really only needs a bit of QoL to be made quite good.
---
Probably what I meant
---
Monitor and abuse Myers with dead rabbit gets me every time. :(
---
I didn't realise that, I thought it was the same unless with the basement perk
---
Shirtless David with red pants is *always* the David who runs D-strike from my experience, no other versions of David does it apparantly.
---
You down for a swf
---
Actually I did smth different for her hahahaha
---
I'm just saying I've seen a lot of different people be jerks, but yeah the meta jerk is a thing too. Fuffin' sadly.
---
Yeah, if they load in with 2 ppl or get a couple DC's I'll let them farm as killer.   I'm a Hag main do I get a lot of points just putting traps around the gen they're on and then they activate them all lol.
---
Or just learn to play stealthy without it, get good at chases and bring another perk :l
---
Yeah but I like them
---
My boyfriend got Tombstoned two games in a row by two different Michaels last week so no, probably not.
---
Or you could use botany knowledge and leader with no selfcare to get even shorter heals instead (around 9 seconds) which I think is miles better than this 'new selfcare' imo.
---
I mean , wouldn't you if you got pallet stunned by literally nothing ???
---
Jhin is the new DBD Killer confirmed, oh wait, it‚Äôs just Legion...
---
FOUR!!!!!
---
It'd be great if the beartrap keyboxes spawned one at a time every time a generator gets done and they removed the timer from beartrap. That way it'd be less of a race for that key.

I do, but I didn't feel like linking up social media so it's easier to do this. 
---
Ah man thats all I wanted to know, thank you so much. Now I also know what these claw hands mean, too! 
---
I'm always a rank 1 survivor and I never use DS. Getting off a shoulder one time per game is a waste of a perk slot imo. If i'm going to waste a perk slot i'd rather get double BP with wglf.
---
? Then don‚Äôt say anything? Just move on lmfao. I thought it was creative and original 
---
Yeah lol. I just thought I'd post it cuz I was kinda wondering if anyone else ever had this happen 
---
Doctor ain't weak, well at least on console lol.
---
I wonder what happens... Wanna try?
---
If their vaulting or what not and im pretty sure if you lunge it just does the normal hit

I have equal time on survivor as I do on my trapper main.
---
From looking at these comments and your replies you act as if just because your internet is absolutely amazing that it's impossible for anyone to lag in your games when they connect unless they're exploiting or on another continent. That is on it's own, one of the most close-minded (And honestly egotistical) takes I've heard on lagging/lagswitching/whatever in this game. 
---
An example being
---
&gt; I have a gig fiber connection..1GB up 1GB down...anyone lagging in my servers is either from asia or they are exploiting
---
Just because a survivor lags in your game, doesn't mean they're exploiting or foreign, it just means that their connection to you isn't that great and that's fine cause it happens to everyone. Also the fact of pointing out that a survivor had 4k hours played (In the original post) and was lagging in your game should show that it was genuine lag, why under any circumstance would someone with that much playtime who's probably been playing since the Closed Beta or Alpha, risk a ban of any measure just to win one game?
---
But letting go is just the same outcome for you IF the killer gets you when you're unhooked. At least if you get unhooked you have a chance to get away. More of a chance than letting go. If the Claudette wants to trade places with you on the hook in exchange for stacks why not take the chance?
---
Really its just tunnel or try to hit everyone. 
---
I agree with this also make it so you don‚Äôt have the broken icon 
---
This isn't my voice.
---
It's not my fault if you don't understand what a meme is.
---
I know no one that enjoys pressing m1  constantly.
---
well thats not that my point, doing only GENS, not saving, not getting into chases, not doing totems...where you might as well be AFK because you are only doing one thing holding M1
---
For which other killers is it actually kind of worth it? Wraith, Michael, Doc, I guess?
---
Your voice sounds like someone blowing a huge fart, what an ugly voice.
---
Also this was NOT funny.
---
It's a difference in personality. Some people don't like feeling as if they're being teased or picked on, which is what that build comes off as. It's the same reason some killers don't mind forcing teabaggers out of the exit and others get really triggered. Not everyone can just flip the switch and "just go with it".
---
Spirit is add-on reliant as well

I was under the impression they got revenge first and in exchange had to do the whole thing for the entity

As someone who thinks about suicide every day and has attempted suicide last year I don't really think that much about others telling me to kill myself. I mean it's not like I don't think about that almost all the time so it really doesn't change it for me. But I don't know. Maybe others experience it differently.
---
Good job OP :D
---
Really like that
---
Flair your memes as "Shitpost".
---
I don't understand why people do more for doing well, guess it's fine if they see doing more as a positive thing.
---
Sure! **FRENZY LUNGE**
---
Huh? Bounces right off...
---
Had a fun one of these the other day. 2 Survivors left, 1 gen remaining, both Survivors were on the same gen and it was nearly finished when I found them. Slept them both. They lingered to finish it. First person transitioned and I pulled them off. Moved over toward the other already injured person.
---
Everything happened at once. They finished transitioning, I hit them, and the gen completed. They got their last gen, but I got them. &lt;3
---
Too late, I already said it, you are wasting your time by telling me not to say it after I have said it, lol you are so dumb hhahahahahahhahahhh xDDD XDDDDDD i took an iq test and my iq is 100, so you better watch out lol i bet your iq is like 5, haha wow ur dumb

I can only imagine what your blood pressure is like. Relax before this GAME kills you. My god.
---
But why is Myers trying to simultaneously eat and stab the pig at the same time 
---
*camping Freddy has been spotted*
---
Scott does, and recently Zubat has said on stream that he has started using one ever since he got his new monitor. 
---
  
---
Even if they both do, I hope you don't consider that cheating or whatever, because it certainly isn't.   
---
Uh, yeah he does.
---
#shirtlessmyers
---
this has already been posted here by them
---
How bout you get out of here with your fancy workout ish 
---
Same, but it finds more uses than other exhaustion perks (expect for DH maybe... but DH rarely actually works). Lithe only fucked me up more than saved, and sprint burst is literally one of the worst perks IMO.   
---
And it's really rare that you can't really use it. Thankfully, survivor perks are not that much necessary to survive.
---
Remember kids, don't feed the trolls. 
---
He's pretty damn weak against decent surv tho. As with freddy as soon as surv understand how the power exactly works its almost worthless 
---
Glad you're still here with us, man. I don't really report people unless they spam me with salt. Like if I get called a tunneler and it ends there idgaf. But if someone is willing to tell me they wish my mother got cancer I feel they would also be the type of person to say shit like "kys British Cigarette" which gives me some sense of "control" over the hatemail

Body blocking is not against the rules. They even have perks that support it. Toxic? sure, just like apparently everything else. But no one is getting banned for body blocking (as long as it doesn't hold the game hostage).

Yeah I completely understand what you mean. Ive been playing this game for a while now (1000+ hrs on pc) and I still enjoy it very much. I just felt the last two new killers (spirit and clown) were still pretty decent. They give me a bit of thrill when being chased. But legion is just dumb to me. Its just a kid in a mask. If they put the effort towards making killers as creepy as the decaying horse then I would be more satisfied. 
---
I cant tell if this is a question or you are just saying welp that's the way it is.
---
With any other killer you have borrowed time. Legion breaks through Borrowed Time as it's not a hit that will directly affect your health-state.
---
When you really want to slow the game down just a little bit.
---
A
---
The chain does get smaller
---
it is his voice, trust me, i know him in real life. thats also why its ok that i insult him and you guys should feel bad for being mean to me for being mean to him because he likes it when i am mean to him.
---
Devs have confirmed "body blocking" is only reportable if it holds a game hostage, not hook blocking... People don't think it's nice, like looping or camping, but blocking a hook is not bannable and shouldn't be reported.
---
That is the last I have heard of it, unless you have something recent from them stating otherwise. It comes down to "body blocking" being a wide term that wasn't properly defined, perhaps.
---
Hey! I play a lot of killer and **no**, that's not a reason to dc, yeah sometimes it might be frustrating but you have to deal with it. Outsmart them! Everytime that i run against a 4 DS SWF or a 4 SABO SWF i just try my best. Don't DC and face your fears for fox sake
---
Camping is fine because you can easily throw the game when you start doing it. 
---
‚ÄúTunneling‚Äù is a word with a made up definition for this game because salty Survivors can‚Äôt comprehend that a Killer would use common sense. Why I would go after a Survivor who takes two hits to down instead of a Survivor that‚Äôll only take one?
---
I guess I'll stop DCing vs him now since knowing this makes him fun to try and loop
---
I'm mistaken then, thanks for clearing that up. Either way, while it may be toxic, I don't think hook camping is any more toxic or reportable than hook blocking or pallet looping. At the end of the day people just need to grow a pair and stop throwing a fit every time they lose.
---
I get salt for that from survivors and I'm like "Well I gotta use my toys before they're thrown away..."
---
Thanks bruv, dont play much freddy tho 
---
&gt;Seeing people crouch and hide near generators when the killer isn‚Äôt even close is painful to watch 
---
Mood all day everyday, especially against Legion. I‚Äôd like to win just once against him, but a 1v1 doesn‚Äôt work in a game that‚Äôs supposed to be 4v1 ://
---
The way Deep Wounds works is that when you're in a chase, your deep wounds timer temporarily stops.
---
Moonwalking is applying deep wounds on a survivor, then doing a 180 and running backwards. That way you're technically not in a chase so their deep wounds timer continues to tick down while you follow them.
---
Aww I'm actually bummed you didnt get out now. This is an excellent example of how survivors arent the only ones toxic.
---
&gt;I forgot to mention, but as long as Frank can two hit down a person, then this change is a bad idea.
---
Given what every other Killer in the game can do, this is a ridiculous statement.
---
As for BT, BT adds an extra hit, just like Legion's power with Frank's. So that's irrelevant.
---
What is the point of using NOED? I stopped using it a long time ago. If you think that you are not going to kill them before the 5 gens just try to be better as killer
---
Also scratched mirror myers. 
---
If you mean "ok" as in a moral perspective, then probably not. Its a pretty douchey thing to do and if you're with smart survivors he basically just game ruins you AND himself.
---
If you mean "ok" as in bannable, then absolutely not. 
---
Okay??? I'm against that too.
---
I actually believe that they need to make voice coms for survivors by default. That would significantly reduce the gaping difference in performance between SWF and PUGs. Then they can buff killers accordingly. Of course a few perks would have to be changed too.
---
&gt; the legions keep decreasing in number (doctors too). The killers are learning.
---
It's people like you that give me more incentive to play Doctor.
---
This isn't new. Since release I've seen at least 1 survivor either instant DC or just kill themselves on first hook against Legion, sometimes everyone in the match just gives up instantly. Personally I don't know if this has happened with other kills this badly, but Legion matches are virtually unplayable for both killer and survivor at this point from what I've seen as nobody wants to play against Legion.
---
Flair checks out 
---
You assume I played like a cunt and the survivor wasn't just salty cos he lost. 2 other people in the match clearly say gg after that game of you look at the chat. Not everyone gets ddos and after 400hours in the game it's my 1st. All it takes it that 1 salty kid who doesn't like the perks you used. That was literally the reason he gave....read the chat
---
It took a long time for me to get it too
---
Do survivors see this at the same time or is it only affecting one side?
---
its a question
---
Especially on the game or lery's it gets scary when he has M&amp;A with the strand of hair for his lunge.
---
That guy lied to you
---
Well the perks should have less to do with the power remember that the perks should be able to used by everyone, also invisible killers are the spookiest
---
Noed depends a bit on the killer but 1/10 is a bit low. 
---
Ds... There's an obsession is in every game and they almost always have ds. Not sure where you're seeing this small percentage of players thing
---
Oh these guys were rank 8's so definitely not noobs and they perks that mostly let them see others auras
---
Right, see you
---
That's why they DDoS you instead, nowadays. Some Mirai variant, a few dozen of Chinese IoTs, a perimeter packet tracer and they are set. This is why P2P in 2018/2019 is a bad joke, but at least you can buy a VPN for less than a cheeseburger a month for protection, or set up a VPN enabled router so all of your devices are protected on the LAN. 
---
It's true tho
---
It's not against any rules but it's scummy, boring, and shows you're not good at killer.
---
You probably use noed.
---
The killer faked them out letting them think they were gonna get the hatch. That's unnecessary and toxic. I would have tbagged too.
---
How 'bout you try and learn the game, get some perks of ya own, and actually invest some time in becoming good at this game?
---
You come in here expecting the game to hand victories to you? Wrong game, dude.
---
im not the only one !!!
---
Nothing can trigger deep wounds except Legion and BT
---
Legion is shit or legion is THE shit?
---
haha good one, friend, bro, buddy, pal.
---
he's always like that, he just loves to prank me like that because he is an epic prankster (he has a prank yt channel aswell, subscribe and like him please?)
---
don't believe him guys, i know him. he's my best pal irl ;)
---
I like Myes the most but just sticking to him got boring
---
Number two: What gives you the right?
---
The artwork is done by Alex Gray, who also does the artwork for Tool albums. 
---
Whats that?
---
Yeah, especially the part where survivors just need to crouch to become invisible for you, how being stunned might as well just make your screen black instead of staring into the ground since you won't see shit anyway, how teleporting takes just enough extra time with it's animations to prevent you from getting a fast hit, how traps drastically lost value over game's life as people now know you just need to crouch and now that Quick&amp;Quiet is present in most matches.
---
Trapper might have similar gameplay patterns, but if your traps are failing you, you can at least rely on your strong legs, manly stance and muscular arms to smack the kids out of your apple orchard. With Hag, you kinda need ~6 perk slots just to feel alright, then you have to pray traps work out well, and that the map is favorable to you.
---
Congratulations, you are still alive. Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore.
---
Actually, I've never used noed in my life. Try again.
---
#BYEBITCH
---
Prime example of mad cause bad
---
Fake giving the hatch is kinda toxic, like why even do that? I wish they would have gotten the hatch.
---
Ruin bbq enduring and spirit fury is amazing on him.monitor and abuse is a standard for alot of myers builds as well as Sloppy butcher and nurses calling.There are plenty of builds with Michael just remember to pop off EW3 when theyre a swing away and slug any nearby survivors.
---
No a real discussion. How long does it take to destroy a totem? 10 seconds.
---
And boom half your perks just got useless. Gg.
---
I need to cease my existence 
---
Ruin never seems to work for me, it spawns in the open for some reason when I use it. Always in the most obvious spots
---
I SWF with a few killers who I just loved their playstyle. They made the game so much fun I wanted to continue playing with them. I love it when someone doesnt automatically hate you because you are on the opposite side as them.
---
I like how you didn't even dispute the first sentence. 
---
And I'm 100% as a trash proxy camper you do use noed. Lie to yourself but not to me
---
Yes. 
---
As a killer main, it really depends on the killer. Nurse, Billy, Spirit: consider leaving. I'm usually not very altruistic as a solo survivor. If it's just me and 1 person is on a hook, I typically leave. Depends on your playstyle preference  
---
It‚Äôs funny how doing well consistently punishes a killer, eh?
---
Id say he is having a bad Monday too.  But for new players, the game is pretty damn brutal, then again, it is a horror survival murder game lol
---
agree make mostrous shrine into a hex or im uninstalling
---
At least that much we can agree on.
---
The memes on this sub are worse than cancer
---
Yeah also why not add a tombstone effect on Noed
---
Traps aren't for getting kills. A trap will never kill a half-decent player. A Pig higher than rank 15 might get a trap kill as often as one in five matches. Traps are for slowing down generator progress by forcing survivors to complete a secondary objective. Have you even played Pig?
---
yeah, it's useful
---
Because I don't care if people think I'm a good killer or not, I'm here to have fun.
---
I have nothing to prove to you, but I'll tell you again that you're wrong. I typically don't use Hex perks but when I do it's Ruin or Huntress Lullaby. Not once have I used noed.
---
Welcome to Rank Reset. Give it a few days until the try hards are back in the purple/red ranks again.
---
*insert a comment that restate information everybody knows here in response to the legion bandwagon*
---
I want monitor so what would you use mainly with bbq and monitor ? 
---
Honestly tho, I‚Äôm new to the game too (like 30 hours) and The only thing I‚Äôve ever complained about is noed üòÇ
---
I dont find mori's bullshit at all and usually laugh when it happens to me because it's just so damn funny. So clearly not everyone finds them bullshit.
---
Get gud
---
Oh and ruin . So I want monitor ruin and bbq what would be last perk you would choose with those 
---
I keep getting to rank 9 and going to rank 14
---
Fool dbd isn't supposed to be fun
---
&lt;3
---
i know about these advantages hag has i was asking the other guy how in the world is she bad
---
Quick&amp;Quiet?
---
Ohhh LMAO I mis read what they meant lmfaoo
---
swf players can tell eachother that they got no hex effects so they can confirm that its haunted grounds but the alone player cant talk with them so they dont know that it‚Äôs haunted grounds
---
He's just standing there, menacingly!
---
"Go ahead axe me any question" - rochelle (since bills from l4d)
---
I've juked a LF chainsaw many times. I live for the clutch moments in this game. I never assume and quit. I want to see those 1 in a million plays. You never know what's going to happen.
---
Goodbye
---
Same problem.
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
You forgot monstrous shrine, the most broken perk in the game, they need to nerf it
---
Nothing changed though
---
If you think NOED is bad, man you should of played back in 2016.  Killer could use moris with only downing you, didnt need to hook you first.  Now that was rough lol
---
Ok. Bye
---
Lol, SB is good. It's usually enough for me to get to a looping spot and if they stop chase i'll just get on a gen. And recover for round 2.
---
Idk I scream when M&amp;A Meyers walks around the corner or when prayer bead spirit pulls me off a gen.
---
:( oh no, but yeah elm pretty common
---
I've had it 3 times now, also on PS4. It's not global, it's a render bug only for the player getting it. Everyone else displays fine. There are worse display bugs, though. Invisible pallets is less frustrating than no generator auras, especially since the pallets last only one game but the aura bug can span multiple sessions. On Survivor side it's also possible to have invisible generators.

---
ori and the blind forest
---
Yeah :(
---
Honestly, I may get downvoted for this, but this subreddit is filled with a bunch snowflakes. After playing online games since 2004, these DBD streamers aren't even remotely as toxic as people in this subreddit make them out to be. 
---
The whole derank drama is stupid as hell too. At the end of the day, the majority of the players don't care and it's just people complaining just to complain. Deranking has existed since pretty much the beginning of the game and there's no point in whining about it. 
---
Yeah i have seen zubat say it on a few streams
---
Was more of a supporting arguement.  As for people thinking hag is bad, they keep doing the low rank idiot strat of dropping all 10 traps on a hooked survivor and wonder why it doesn't work.
---
Oink! 
---
It depends though. Id say it's only useless because most people are going into a game expecting ruin to be there. But if it's in a hard to find spot it can wreck the other team if they're no working on gens.  
---
oh oops
---
well thanks for helping lmao
---
LOL , that blows . All of that . I've been super weary of pallets since . The aura thing would SUCK.. 
---
How is that not cheating? Its one step away from aimbot..
---
Unlucky dude. Yesterday I was playing on my gfs account and taunted a facecamping LF at the hatch. Killer stunned him as it was in the shack, pointed and proceeded to vault straight back over the pallet into his arms instead of down the hatch. I just laughed then cried myself to sleep...
---
Why not, you aren't really slowed. Also you can catch some survivors off-guard at a pallet standoff by ambushing across the gap. Now, chasing normally, yeah I agree chase them standing, but crouchig has its uses.
---
Getting the achievement for Rank 1 killer has allowed me to just play super casually, and lose super badly, at rank 11 (now 13) because I'm not even trying. Fuck Rank 1.
---
This hasn't stopped former red rank survivors from killing all 5 gens in under 5 minutes, then saying some of the most vile things post-match.
---
Yeah, I suck as killer. That's why I mind gamed the shit out of you as LF at a jungle gym and you ran face first into my chainsaw, which would have been your 3rd hook, but I left you alone so I could look for the last player I didn't hook so I could get 4 stacks of BBQ.
---
It's a localized bug, only affects whoever gets it. Typically just one player. 
---
This happens so often to me as Spirit . 
---
People teabag or act toxic but then as soon as I hook or dare use a mori , I get messages telling me off or how I should kill myself . 
---
This game is wonderful . 
---
Pretty sure you mean urban evasion and not Quick &amp; Quiet.
---
Also you are completely wrong about the hag. I'm so tired of people calling hag a bad killer when they obviously don't know how to play her.
---
I'll offer some advice:
---
-Don't put traps near pallets. Put them where the survivor will loop. When you reach a loop slow down a little to make the survivor think they can get a loop instead of throwing it down immediately.
---
-This might sound scummy but Hag is a defensive killer. Camping is what she's best at. Camping from afar that is. Don't ever completely leave the hooked area. Always be ready to teleport over. Especially since survivors will start crouching near hooks, you can still reach them by foot.
---
-3 gen strat. Can't stress this enough. Your main priority is to keep 3 gens that are close to each other and slowly deplete the pallets around that area. You can still leave that area but never over commit to a chase if you feel like it will last long.
---
*laughs in Spirit*
---
Something bad... Like Legion's mechanics?
---
There is a 4% chance to unhook yourself, how you gonna complain about that
---
Usually how i work if i'm playing with friends.
---
If the killer has ruin 
---
1 player goes to look for it.
---
2 people are on separate gens to decrease the chance of more skill checks occurring.
---
and me or another player are just keeping an eye out for the killer.
---
And of course it was Sloppy Butcher.  Blood sprays for days!
---
Damn, you're right. I didn't realize using a crosshair basically meant aimbot. How dare those filthy huntress players. 
---
Thanks, I will try that
---
lol is top pic bathrobe dwane?
---
You crying baby
---
Why doesnt this have salt/rant flair lmao
---
Happens a lot when dropping pallets and getting hit in the process
---
Yeah Its usually 5/10 games i get full swf when that happens I usually try to find their weak one.
---
We had a lobby who did this once! Our killer was Freddy, it was amazing
---
so basically if the devs gave us a bad game.... instead of going on their forums and feedback platforms to let them know what problems we face, we go into matches and ruin them for the others ?  yeah sounds about right. also sounds analogous to going on a riot spree and vandalizing public and private property because you are unhappy with something the government gave you or enforced. Which also you could reach out to through the designated channels and regional representatives.
---
If you don't enjoy the game then stop playing it instead of ruining it for others.
---
For those that don't know what the Survivor was doing, it's called a 'bunny tech'. The idea is that you DC right as the Killer swings so that he whiffs.
---
Not condoning it, just explaining it.
---
Cross hairs are an indication of where the axe will go, no?
---
Why is that fair vs the normal player who has no indication?
---
Best addons are the addons that increase evil gained when stalking. Standard perks that help every other normal killer help here: Ruin, BBQ, Enduring, Nurse‚Äôs, Sloppy Butcher, and special mention to Monitor and Abuse because it can get you free hits if you position yourself correctly. Lery‚Äôs or Game offering will always make the match easier if you have issues. 
---
But of all, the most important is to pray to the Entity that you don‚Äôt get cold wind farm for the 9th FUCKING TIME in a row
---
You haven't played Pig untill you've grabbed survivors off gens. The jumpscare beats Myers' any day.
---
Same
---
&gt;  I mean, you bought the game, play however you want, but if people are not happy about it, don't blame the community, it's on you.
---
Yup lol
---
Are we forgetting that it is an extra big fuck you to Freddy 
---
but the player base its the same that yesterday, 20k people playing
---
Yeah. Riot analogy is pretty accurate and its what actually happens in real life. Most recently in France. 
---
Just cleanse the totems... oh wait
---
Dude it's not a matter of whether a "normal" player uses one or not. The fact is that they are allowed to use one if they want to, because it isn't considered cheating. 
---
blue hair susie is better anyway because her color scheme goes together better
---
plus her shirt isnt blank it actually has a logo and is therefore better
---
Explain to me how rank reset is bad for killers who are high rank...
---
spot the rank 20 lmao
---
I've had a lot of nice lobbies with good killers and survivors. 
---
The toxic comes from angry kids/man babies living in their moms basements that hate their lives. What are ya gonna do? 
---
People can be playing kyf or killer also. Plus that's region locked too or did they remove that?
---
Distortion doesn‚Äôt take effect from Ruin, bc ruin isn‚Äôt an aura reading perk. So it wouldn‚Äôt lose tokens from ruin.
---
I was rank 4 got sent to 11, weird
---
If I see someone get unhooked I won‚Äôt go for the guy who‚Äôs just been unhooked. Just seems like common decency to me
---
Yeah I meant morally
---
If you're looking for actual stealth, myers is the worst stealth killer. Its argueable whether hes better than Pig or not being a killer, but if your looking for actual stealth go for Pig or Wraith. Myers moves so slowly, hes super tall, and you can hear his breathing from a while away. You just want to get out of EW1 ASAP, then start using your smaller terror radius to get free hits.
---
True but ruin often stalls the game, giving aura reading perks more time to activate
---
Sometimes it can be but as none of my friends play dbd I wouldn‚Äôt really know how it feels to be a part of it

---
Can you do one of the hag mori Claudette?
---
It depends. If the gens are popping faster then popcorn I can‚Äôt blame a killer for feeling urgency in takin someone out. 
---
Biting the neck 
---
Lucky you
---
As a killer this is kind've frustrating to watch happen. For example I had a game yesterday where I got someone to the basement with no gens done. Sucks that we spawned right next to eachother and the basement, but whatever I wasn't going to camp him or anything.
---
Then as I'm going upstairs someone tries to sneakily drop down behind me and I hear them, yoink them off the hook and now I've got 2 people in the basement within the first 30 seconds of the match and still no gens complete. Third guy DCs and I catch the fourth on his way to rescue the others. 
---
Games like that are a shitshow and arent inherently enjoyable for me either.
---
The reason why Freddy is shit tier is the small but still existent Spine Chill playerbase 
---
Fair point ü§î
---
A splitting headache
---
woooowwww that's so crazy. Thanks for explaining it bro btw.
---
It's crazy how they come up with this shit I swear haha
---
I get that in some situations, however this was definitely not one of them haha
---
As soon as they buff the camping perks like insidious to actually be useful
---
Yup, started after the Winter Solstice ended. I'm getting better waiting times as of today though
---
Took me 447 hours 
---
Hag Momma was weak but never unfun. Shes definitely ok now
---
Freddy is weak but I wouldnt say unfun. Bad Freddys tunnel and thats whats unfun but its unfun when any Killer tunnels.
---
Legion will not miss which makes him annoying but he will take 4 stabs to do it. Essentially you're in this 1 min countdown to the hook
---
i hope he's joking
---
That‚Äôs literally how I play the game. Get one killer to P1 then move on once all are P1 repeat the process
---
Completely OP with Franks and completely UP without it
---
Yo i legit think thats me, i did the exact same thing as this Pig yesterday.  Did the pig have a P1 Blade?
---
-Ranking system- (PS4)
---
Whenever i close the game, when i log back in i always notice 2 pips are gone from my survivor (even when i played killer last)
---
&gt; The memes on this sub are worse than cancer
---
[Says the one also posting memes.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/afauny/that_feel_when_all_of_a_sudden_you_regret/)
---
Is it because they tend to be more successful than yours?
---
Bring back the old small game!
---
Haven't really played Meg much maybe a few levels on her but....yeah. That's pretty much every match....
---
i wanna upvote this but then it would make it 70 and not 69.
---
And Nurse and Wraith are also crippled by flashlights...
---
Nice try...cant save yourself now.
---
New killer hinted? The chef? The butcher? 
---
My bet is just low killer population,  between frames and the near constant hatemail I'm not surprised it's taking forever for survivors to find matches (meanwhile as a killer my lobbies fill near instantly)
---
that's the point?
---
unfortunately
---
People think it's salt, usually.  I'm just doing the best thing I can to inform the devs that I don't like it.  If it hurts others, maybe it will create change.  Sorry!
---
have you been watching tyde or something bro
---
I'd be fine even if we just got exclusive cosmetics. But yeah, the current system isn't very rewarding. Even Call of Duty unlocks new load-outs on prestiging, we just go back to the exact same as we were 100+ hours before.
---
Who knows... Haha.
---
In fact I was just randomly walking in Paris and saw that weird but familiar restaurant...
---
I guess they put way too much salt in their meals.
---
Voltron!
---
Really? I only encounter 4 ds and all adrenaline very rarely.
---
Rekted
---
My grandma lived on Elm Street 
---
&gt; Freddy is weak but I wouldnt say unfun
---
I've hated playing against Freddy since launch.
---
&gt; Bad Freddys tunnel and thats whats unfun but its unfun when any Killer tunnels.
---
No, it's unfun playing against a killer I can't see whatsoever until he's already chasing me. It removes all stealth whatsoever and reduces it to "be immersed in a corner and hope he leaves".
---
Spine chill is for immersed players sns
---
Do that way until your really good then swap it.
---
I was thinking about that as well. But... well, maybe disable posibility to run Hope, or decrease its power by 50% if you run it. But still, people are barely running in. It can be still modified after "testing".
---
I'm like 90% sure purposely dcing is a bannable offense
---
Well, you are a joke to everyone
---
I‚Äôll gladly take your life
---
No Hope and it‚Äôs fine. 
---
Happened to me as Myers against a 4 man swf on PS4. It wasn‚Äôt ideal.
---
It also lets you know when its safe to keep working on a gen inside terror radius when if don't have clear sightlines, because you know when the killer is actually coming for you and isn't just nearby. It's a really versatile perk, deserves more attention imo.
---
Also worth noting that it takes 8 seconds for a standard killer to reach you after spine chill triggers, although you'll probably wait for spine chill to light up for at least 2 seconds to confirm they're actually coming- the resulting 6 seconds is enough to sprint away and not leave any scratchmarks with Lightweight, and leave only very faint ones without.
---
Honestly trading is the worst possible outcome.
---
* The killer misses his timing and hits the unhooked person before he gains control, allowing him to run with BT on him.
---
* The killer hits the unhooked and triggers BT and chases him where either he himself can shake the killer or me/another survivor take the hit and/or heat.
---
* The killer downs me and the unhooked person gets away and I can potentially get a double stack of WGLF.
---
Considering all these possible outcomes it is worth it, even just for not having that survivor‚Äôs  game ruined. And im not an idiot, I run that build for that purpose AND I stay on objectives till I need to go before he goes in the next fase or dies. Not too mention trading places is actually fine depending on your previous hookings.
---
And this is me as a solo player, I honestly need that selfcare more often than not. It depends on your playstyle and if you play solo or not. I love adrenaline which I would run as a next perk but I only have 2 real perk slots for myself and those are occupied by selfcare and dead hard. WGLF salvages the ridiculous small amount of survivor BP, if you can even get the stacks that is and I always run BT for the aforementioned situations.
---
If you play this scenario well you often pull it off one way or another and worst case im rewarded with WGLF and trade. And I believe that any person that doesnt disconnect or suicide on hook while getting facecamped deserves to be rescued. He stays there so we get more time for our team objectives, so you can bet ill make most of that time on said objectives and then im gonna go get him/her. Imo thats how people should play. You might think these are unnecessary plays, plays rewarding the killer or whatever but for example people who unhook someone within 10 seconds are helping the killer way more often than not.
---
That was main point to have powers which will have something similar to their personal perks and basically force people to play survivor unique perks on them. I still don't know what exactly they mean by introducing "medium" vault, but maybe adding cooldown to it can balance it. Like 15sec or something.
---
So Julie, then. Or change the mask. Put more effort in than allowing a random gender change.
---
I don't think you realize the issue here. Sure, if you are playing SWF getting at 5 totems is a walk in the park. But, not everyone plays SWF. If you play solo or duo with another survivor, then you won't have an easy time with totems because it is impossible to know what the others are doing. And spending almost a minute and a half doing totems each game (almost same time as gen BTW) is awful. It rewards the killer for getting gen rushed because they can't keep pressure up.
---
Yea, exactly my point. I hope at some point and one day we will have something like this. :)

there's  actually a twitch streamer under "elmyers1989" who dresses up as myers and speaks mostly spanish 
---
There is one? You get banned for doing it too much?
---
Because everyone could use one if they wanted to
---
Same bro!
---
Exactly my thoughts. Right now every survivor can be the same once you get teachable. This could change the game a little bit.
---
Nothing's changed, legion is instant dc anyway
---
No game mode. Pallet roulette.
---
Maybe adding cooldown on it, like once per 15sec, or eventually changing it entirely to something like "Fast vaults leave no notification".
---
I love doctor cuz I suck. I suck at know where my targets are, so doctor is the solution. Make the scream every 5 seconds. Lol
---
Well the point is, even if he's a god tier hatchet thrower without it now, he only got that good by using it to learn with.
---
Nevermind the fact all the hits and kills he got that he likely wouldn't have while using it and 'learning' in the first place.
---
I'd have way more respect for someone good with their hatchets who learned by simply playing the game and not using hacks to help them.
---
Why you stopped, that quotter bonus is juicy for me. 
---
Did the killer dc???
---
SWF vs solo is a different game for every killer, but the biggest difference is probably in Hag's game. The traps are critical to her gameplay, but survivors on comms can really shit on them. They'll put a person on flashlight duty. They'll announce where you are and when you're picking up bodies so their teammates can run over traps. Many of them have UE as part of their team's build.
---
At least you can kind of walk around and M1 people and just place traps on loops as needed, but you can't have the god-tier map awareness and pressure that Hag can enjoy against newbs. 
---
This is fake news. I DC a ton when I I get around rank 6-7 so I can go back to finding lobbies in 20-30 seconds instead of minutes. I think we'll see some more penalties for DC'ing when the dedicated servers come along. I DC probably about 25 times every two weeks or so and have been doing this since Beta and haven't been banned yet.
---
Why they dont make it an option in game?
---
Weird
---
I wish I could say "can't wait for dedicated servers" but I touch this game an hour a week because of stupid shit like this.
---
Love it
---
Rip

His tracking isn't actually all that incredible. It's easy to find survivors the first time, but after that I'd argue Freddy has better tracking.
---
Yeah. 
---
It'll come out on the 22nd.
---
Basically. The options are use Frank's and be pretty good, use anything else and play as intended and be terrible, or cheese chases and be bored and mediocre l.
---
This meme is very underrated 
---
Excuse how are you using DH that it doesn't work? Dead hard has saved my ass numerous times in chases. 
---
BNP being overnerfed doesn't really have anything to do with Ebony though. The goal shouldn't be a spiteful process of nerfing everything into uselessness.
---
3 disconnects only netted me 1250 BP which is absolutely useless. A sacrifice on hook with BBQ&amp;C could have netted me tens of thousands more but they just BM and quit
---
For lunar event? 
---
I had no idea about that :O I'll have to check him out sometime
---
Definitely the latter. 
---
Even playing fast-downing Killers like Hillbilly, Leatherface, etc. I am still getting gen rushed.
---
Leader with toolboxes is just ridiculous.
---
Love watching the stream scott but I play killer all the time and people often just DC and fuck over everyone else. Maybe it's different at rank 1 but a bit further up I can easily say that 1/4 games has a DC. 
---
It seems to me that "doing it too much" is a very non-descript way of saying "don't do this every game and we won't do anything".

I wanted Julie but I didn't find her standing in-game on internet and I don't have darkness among us dlc.
---
It was from the hallowed blight even
---
It should be the other way!
---
Sometimes killer somehow manages to still hit me through lunging when I use DH. And sometimes I don't even dash forward - but I get the exhaustion effect. Probably ping, but I always try to get the best ping, so IDK.   
---
DH did save me sometimes, and sometimes didn't. 
---
ok ur just inventing excuses
---
i saw someone say restart the game
---
LOOOOL CHUNGUS IS FAT HE SHOULDINT HAVE.A WEAPON HELL SQUASH YOU
---
4 DS is rare. Every survivor runs Adrenaline though. There's an average of about 2.5 a game.
---
F
---
Good advice! I main Hag and find controlling the gens is key. It‚Äôs usually a longer game but like you said, if you can control that area, you‚Äôre able to pick them off one at a time and it goes well. I suck at every other killer but find the Hag generally easiest to be successful with.
---
It‚Äôs spelt. Umk
---
But if you don't got to it, it will get destroyed I many cases since survivors can literally spawn on the totem.
---
oooor imagine that a rank 1 survivor could kite any rank 20 killer around indefinitely and you're playing against ultra potato legions who probably can't even tie their own shoes.
---
I agree, it is ridiculous. But i feel like there won't be much of a change imo. It's just better to work on separate gens now
---
Not bad for a first.
---
Its not SDK, its Source Filmmaker

Try to pose fingers too. It will make characters more lifelike

Juggling isn't always that reliable,but invis camping is a dick move
---
it wasnt
---
If I went in there I have a feeling I‚Äôd get hooked on the food 
---
Ebony mori is certainly overpowered, but how to nerf it is kind of difficult. They can't make it require being hooked twice before you an use it because that makes it functionally useless. Personally, I think it could do with a rework. I would make it function like an unstoppable Devour Hope. Every hook you get a token, at 5 tokens you can mori anyone you want. That prevents the game just being a total stomp since the survivors actually have time to deal with it.
---
No, no hag is bad. Please buff her. Ignore this shirtless David main. 
---
&gt;Can you do one of the hag mori Claudette?
---
Yeap, maybe.
---
Make it so skill checks arent always space bar or whatever you have it set to. Make it a random bey/button (other than your run, obviously).

That perk build, jeez

You are probably from US where dbd has much weaker scene.

I almost spit my food out of my nose. Thank you.

imagine that with doctors madness yikes

I never said it was a great ratio they've got going on there, but you just implied there is no punishment and technically it is. Now if you wanna talk about making it more strict that's one thing.
---
Yes! Like i know im injured. I dont need super loud music to tell me
---
survivor/killer main &lt; dead by daylight main
---
Just requires you to pay more attention. Doing gens is monotonous and requires the barest of focus.
---
Yeah i see adrenaline alot. I meant both paired together. I love games where we are all injured and adrenaline kicks in and you see everyone go to healthy. Its fun to watch lol
---
imagine thinking crouching in a loop is a good idea against anyone aside from a stalking Myers or an aiming Huntress.
---
Ggez baby killer
---
But what about devil may care...
---
Good post! This game very much should be played like  role play not a competitive pvp.  In its current form if you want to rank up all you need to do as killer is hook camp and tunnel two players, itll give you 1-2 pips consistently while being minimal effort, but everyone will be bored AF. The games much more fun for everyone when you play like a killer from a slasher flick, not a cowardly camper... Chasing people around like a masked maniac, leaving hooks leading to further chases. Then at the end everyone being like "damn gg, that was intense", as opposed to giving you the slow clap and saying "well done camper, that was boring AF"
---
I am complaining that survivors in my games are insta-DCing upon seeing Legion without figuring out if they could kite that Legion. How bad I am or what rank I am is irrelevant, because people in my rank are insta-DCing against Legions in my rank in games where we could have easily won. 
---
I don't want you to exert yourself by any means, but could you please put a little bit more thought into what you read and write so I don't have to read such stupid shit any more? Thanks.
---
I don't really know how the Public Test Build works, but I would assume that if a person was probably Rank 4 when the servers copied your profile information, then played PTB and Ranked to 1, then the reset took 4 to 14.
---
I am not sure as I've never played PTB. Just guessing.
---
I mean....you do 2 gens by yourself. And all the other survivors die from stupid mistakes and you are the last survivor. You did most of the stuff that game. You find hatch....that means you are bad? 
---
Well no one plays deathgarden (well 1 guy plays deathgarden currently) so not many have that mask
---
Just saying I fear a NOED nurse more than legion. And the Iri huntress is scary as she usually has a Mori with her. 
---
I don't even have the PTB, I'm on Xbox One. 
---
Please stop eating with your nose
---
Where do I begin with the idiocracy of a ‚Äúcamping Freddy‚Äù? 
---
... oh yeah. HE CANT CAMP BECAUSE HE CANT IMMEDIATELY ATTACK/STOP HOOK DIVERS...
---
...I think that‚Äôs a good starting point. 
---
I don't ask that, but instead: "How stupid are you?"
---
I don't find it as boring as most people do, I'm always tense and moving the camera around to spot a stealth killer or locate the next generator, and plan my escape route if I'm spotted. 
---
It‚Äôs just sheesh, agitation and iron grasp? Hooks arnt a problem for you with both of those. you should use your perk spots more wisely. Unless that‚Äôs all you have
---
It gets quite hectic once they all realise you only want to protect your traps and have to reset them all 
---
Whats this post about? All I see is a very normal end game screen.
---
I have a couple of ideas. Possibly add another layer to repairing gens, like finding parts throughout the map which you need to fully repair a gen. Times would be adjusted to keep the overall time in gens roughly the same. Another idea is to make skillchecks constant, similar to the former BNP. That way you're always doing something on a gen. Obviously things like Ruin and Freddy would have to be tweaked to keep it balanced.  
---
Not sure why the downvotes, you're right.
---
So because someone flashight saves that means shes toxic? Also playing with friends = toxic? And tbagging and emoting at every pallet?
---
I mean, most myers players run M&amp;A. Which means 8m terror radius most of the time with %115 movement speed. If you know how to take advantage of your surroundings you are guaranteed to find and hit a survivor or feed off of him without giving your position away. Pig can only move around the map without a TR if she is crouching(%92 MS) and she has to ambush/stand up to hit a survivor. Wraith can still be seen while cloaked, and even if he manages to sneak in he has to uncloak, giving his position away. Which is myers is the best stealth killer. Comparing from a general killer standart, myers still blows them both out of the water with 1-shot potential, longer longe and faster vault speed. There isna reason he is high-mid tier while pig and wraith is low-mid tier
---
Nah you just suck
---
Good luck doing anything after you find survivors 
---
Nah
---
Fuck this weak killer, Myers ftw 
---
Survivor queue times are ridiculously long, Killer is almost instant. It‚Äôs usually the opposite so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs technical or just a lack of Killers, but it‚Äôs hard to believe that there are no open lobbies for 10 minute stretches of time so I think it‚Äôs a matchmaking issue. Hopefully the updated matchmaking improves it soon.
---
doesn't seem like something I'd have a problem with missing
---
The relatability of this meme is off the charts. Nice one!
---
It's the best I've got. Also I like basement hooks because it's usually in the shack where I can trap easily. Gets me lots of easy traps. 
---
"The one thing that drives me up the wall about survivor is how dependant you are on teammates most of the time." I mean, you're put on a team with three other people for a reason.
---
oh yeah I noticed that in some people. I didn‚Äôt pay attention to age/generation though. Probably exist in both new and old.
---
But I see more who connect out of spite. and be like ‚Äúhaha noob!‚Äù Or whatever slur they throw
---
Once I had a survivor who went for an unhook in transition in NOED. They got the unhook, but I immediately downed them and put them on the hook. They complained when none of their team ran into NOED to save them. That's one of Freddy's assets against survivors. They assume he's so bad that they forget how the game works.
---
Launching the game from the Steam Library fixes this issue for me.
---
As someone who plays both, it‚Äôs Hannah Montana time
---
Crossover with hotline miami intensify
---
ah ok, coincidence lol
---
They need to delete Frank's and then balance him around never having it.
---
Being able to wildly slash at people is kind of his whole gimmick, and taking it away isn't really going to nerf him because it doesn't take long to get used to his speed/FOV so you don't really miss that much if at all anyway.
---
You must be high if you think people will upvoted an insidious basement camping Leatherface. But the video was funny.
---
There are still a few killers that can both be fun and viable though.
---
I too enjoy the Legion. I like his ascetic and I think his mechanic is pretty cool. Sure fix the issues with him tunneling people idc. Yes he can almost guaranteed down someone if he "tunnels" them in a chase. The skill required to run up on a dude and swing is very low. But I enjoy peeling off mid frenzy and hitting a new survivor to try and apply a little pressure with forcing a mend. I enjoy  trying to track blood to make deep wounds matter. I enjoy deciding if I wanna go for the down with the 110 movement speed on an injured survivor or extend the chace and go for the frenzy down. Yea I get it. Legion cheeses chases good, and Chases are the ONLY fun to be had in the game. But that is less a problem with Legion and more a problem with the game. When people say Legion takes all the fun out of the game isn't it concerning that in a game where there should be multiple things you can do everyone only gets fun out of the one part? Isn't that a much bigger problem than chases being to easy for Legion? Why isn't stealth an option for fun? why isn't there more killer/survivor interaction outside of a chase? A killer is overly strong in a single facet of the game and it ruins the whole game for people? I dunno, I just think it's horrible that a person can't even openly enjoy a thing in the game without being downvoted even when he says he agrees things about the character should be changed for the better. That people nitpick his idea of Fun cause he "used the wrong terms" or "just needs to get good". All this guy said is "I enjoy this thing other people don't and I think that's okay cause I don't enjoy this thing in the game other people do and those two things should balance out". 
---
You're still wasting add ons. I mean I play that game with survivors putting all traps in square form in an open area but I would never use any add ons. Its for fun, you dont want to get efficient.
---
JAKEEEE!
---
I would say 500, but that‚Äôs probably pushing it from the devs side, thats like $5 right ? They‚Äôd lose money, but it really wouldn‚Äôt be that much tbh. 3K Shards would be awesome, since they really used for cosmetics
---
When u use bbq with nurse and billy catch someone and go back to the hook fast, it can be really powerful
---
Most likely, but I just want to talk Ideas.
---
His post Got removed for swearing in the end game chat 
---
Sprint Burst is definitely not one of the worst perks for most people. It rewards survivors for bad map positioning.
---
Wow, now just sitting around and waiting, if you would have used a perk with some use instead of surveillance you would have already been in the next round at that moment
---
They hated god when he spoke the truth 
---
he is a sexy sweaty gross man though
---
so long as he wears that mask
---
if he takes it off he is a butterface
---
It says 24 m terror radius on wiki?
---
meh. its fine. let them whine. 
---
Love Spine Chill, Add Resilience, so if you get hit, and the chase continues, you can vault 15% faster. It saves me a lot when running No Mither too.
---
I do have a general idea with pallets but I don't play killer very much so I just use what I call instant pay-off perks. 
---
Lol fobofobo?
---
Yeah because he literally breaks your console. 
---
Neither do I
---
I mean I grab 40-50k and I use the cheap add ons. I‚Äôve got basically everything I could want in terms or perks for both sides 
---
But if the killer does good then he'll be in an even better spot to use it. Like, gens get done. It's just what happens. Even when you're "applying pressure", that's not a magical panacea to prevent gens from getting done. NOED gives you a boost at the end in exchange for no benefit for the majority of the match.
---
Ok *tunneling freddy* in which every game he follows the unhooking survivor to the hook, puts both to sleep when the hooked guy gets off, then tunnels the injured dude. Dummy
---
I need a gif. 
---
No counter-play and is unfun to play as.
---
&gt; he simply can't "have no counterplay" and "get no kills" at the same time.
---
"No counterplay" meme aside, the way this works is that Legion's chases are actually not very fast even with Frank's. Without Frank's his chases are downright slow unless they give you an easy M1 kill.
---
So even though you can definitely catch 95% of survivors, if they properly kite you even just a little bit you're looking at a chase duration that many killers would call awful. So hurray, you caught a survivor with your power that maybe would have been nearly impossible for a low skilled Leatherface, but it took you so long that you're way behind in the game anyway.
---
I played Legion heavily after he came out, but gave up after a couple weeks in red ranks because without using Frank's and getting really sweaty you have a lot of 0ks to look forward to. By the time you get that first guy 3 gens are done, and the next 2 will get done before you can down another one, and then good luck securing 1 kill with Legion when the gates are open.
---
It sounds contradictory, but it's just really hard to explain. It's difficult to actually win with him unless you're facing baddies, even though it's really easy to tunnel all but the very best survivors with Frank's. 
---
"Death has come to your little town, Sheriff."
---
Isn‚Äôt that one of the ways it‚Äôs supposed to be played?
---
Wraith vs Flashbangs is cancer.   Guaranteed to stun you if you are coming out of stealth without insane uncloak speed.
---
Ive just started playing on PC two days ago, after like 900 hours console and Rank 1 every month since release on Xbox, the meta is very different here. Never found make your choice useful on there, but then again nurse sucks console.
---
Why would that be the case if u get points for hooking people 
---
Why did you post it?
---
Hook them after you slug.
---
You can still hook slugs, right? I‚Äôm not trying to be mean because it is annoying but there is more then one way to play. If they lose out on points then that‚Äôs on the Killers isn‚Äôt it? 
---
I started to get stressed out because he wouldnt destroy it......
---
Only two games I've ever seen a DC penalty for is ranked seige and ranked overwatch ( I'm not 100% on overwatch lol) but I also play on ps4 and every match people DC on causal on seige. Theres a constant in and out in that game
---
For some killers brutal strength is very good due to said killers downsides such as Freddy, Wraith and Pig. It isn‚Äôt as good for every other killer cause they have counters to pallets and pallet looping
---
Woah, We are really glad you keep us posted on that. Thanks.
---
Anyone got something great to eat today? I had Chicken &amp; Rice.
---
On Xbox at least, it was both RB. I personally changed my button layout to stop it from happening. 
---
I use surveillance as gimmick as well as Thrill of the Hunt.
---
I'd say so! 
---
The devs have stated in the past that the lack of communication is an intensional feature to add to the horror, so using a 3rd party service to communicate with your team is cheating. 
---
Nurse is nurse a lot of people agree shes bullshit but at least she takes skill to play and survivors can sort of bait her to blink too far etc. Billy and huntress??????? The killers which you dodge, and loop if you mindgame properly but will punish you if you dont play well? They are fun to play and play against.
---
Other  points youve made are nonsensical, I dont need legion to be super powerful I just want him to be fun
---
I wasn‚Äôt quite sure where else to post this but I‚Äôm really proud of this! I only need to max out one character to get the Platinum on PS4, and this‚Äôll be my second Platinum trophy overall. 
---

---
Moonwalking is one of the things I put under the heading "and getting really sweaty" lol. 
---
Moonwalking without Frank's is really slow, man. I haven't timed it, but it feels long enough that I would call it an excruciating duration on most other killers.
---
People can play how they want. Not how you want them to play. 
---
Blight event. 
---
I honestly hate SB. The fact I have to walk, or use Urban and crouch walk, everywhere to avoid not having exhaustion at the wrong time, bleh.
---
Then you did fine. Slugging to get the 4K can be unfun for literally anyone who‚Äôs still alive and the killer but it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre bored out of your mind unfun and if the slug crawls away then it is possible to play around slugging for the 4K. The people who excessively complain about it are the toxic ones most of the time, and slugging mid match or not hooking someone right when you down them is an important skill to have and play around with. 
---
If you want to slug for the 4K, then fine. It‚Äôs not usually worth your time unless you have means to find them quickly but the hatch mechanic is quite survivor sided so if you really want that 4K because there‚Äôs a BPS or a survivor pudding up then do what you gotta do.
---
Ah I see it now any informations about lunar? Or nothing? 
---
How'd this play out for you?
---
I hate NOED and even I‚Äôm considering using it again because of fucking Adrenaline 
---
But why? They didn't changed anything about the generell Speed, did they?
---
I think you shared the wrong screenshot. That one says you still need 34 more. 
---
Same here. But as killer, it's a frustrating perk to play against.

Those are DLC trophies and don‚Äôt count towards Platinums. :)

Sure there are all sorts of rules players try to enforce, and justify it as trying to have "fun" when they're shirking responsibility for their mistakes in order to have something/someone other than themselves to blame.  No one is obligated to play by any made up rulebook though, and players can do what they want.  If you're looking at what the game itself encourages/rewards the most heavily though then getting kills is a relatively low priority for a killer.  Hooking 3 survivors once is rewarded way more by the game than hooking a survivor once and making sure they die from that hook.  You can play however you want, but it is disappointing when killers choose to only earn up to like 15k points in order to secure kills instead of earning 25k+ points without gauranteed kills.  The killer playing for points also allows the survivors to earn more points, and generally creates a much more engaging experience for all 5 players.  
---
I find Empathy more useful than Bond because knowing where injured survivors are anywhere on the map is more useful than knowing where nearby survivors are, since it also more or less shows you where the killer is anywhere on the map (kinda).
---
Replace Premonition (I assume you meant that and not perception) with Spine Chill, which both tells you when the killer is looking in your direction with no cooldown, and increases your action speed while they do so; this means you repair faster if they are scouting the area, and you vault faster if they are chasing you.
---
Small game is useful if you find you've been hit with lots of totem-based perks against killers, but even then totem placement while not static isn't exactly totally random either. Replace that one for sure.
---
Leader ‚Äî not my favorite perk unless I'm playing with friends.
---
You could go for:
---
Resilience, again for some better chase game (faster vaulting and actions while injured), possibly with No Mither
---
From what I hear it's a very different game. I know that very few use Nurse and Huntress on console, they're not exactly popular on pc but the people that do play those two tend to be extremely good at them
---
By your logic
---
Survivors: Sabo sabo
---
Killers: STOP, YOU ARE ANNOYING ME
---
Killers: Tunnels, Slugs, Camps
---
Survivors: eh it's a legit tactic
---
What‚Äôs more worthless this or yellow spirit fury 1? Lmao both great at 3 though 
---
Lmfao
---
You have to do it A LOT and even then you get warning, couple short bans and then permanent. I mean. There's a lot of players in this game so its very likely to run into one who disconnects every now and then.
---
I love how SWF with every crutch imaginable talk shit
---
What?
---
Are you being judgemental of how Badgersauri eat their food? I would have expected more from a fox, even if someone set fire to it.
---
How am I a tryhard if I'm saying this is for fun
---
Huh right you are. Thanks for the correction.
---
Resilience lets you vault faster?
---
Oh, sorry.
---
By "sweaty" in dbd people mean tryhard or overly competitive. The thing that makes it tryhard is intentionally breaking chase to cause the timer to begin, not that it's difficult or backwards or sideways. 
---
Also, "moonwalking" is just a catch all for doing that and doesn't necessarily or literally mean walking backwards. Of course it's easier to just look down or sideways. 
---
I came to say that 
---
LUL
---
I found it funny that the story of legion takes place in 1996. The year the first Scream was released.
---
ok now the game has faster queue times while playing as killer but, it only connects me with asian people or european ppl
---
Use unbreakable, stop getting caught. People can play how they want.
---
The only problem with this is that finding a match on the highest and lowest ranks would be a nightmare and then the best survivors will derank now with a true motive and that's basically the current system again
---
I sometimes get spooked the fuck out triggering an early game hag trap when i don't know who the killer is yet. 
---
I would add to the second one that you can‚Äôt be 30% faster in a chase. Cause otherwise is sounds like you are forcing survivors to constantly run while looking backwards. The moment they look forward to check they aren‚Äôt running into a tree, bam ghost face got a free sprint burst. 
---
No you added too much toxic waste
---
Well if it was anything that required skill, it'd be a problem.
---
Idk about that other guy, but I think its a good perk build. It works. Gg on the 4k basement
---
lol good point . Still would be fucked. it‚Äôs so sticky
---
Huh, guess i missed something. Thought they were there because they like killing so much, killing for the sake of killing.
---
and they killers are just as trapped as the survivors...
---
*triggers haunted grounds* 
---
epic gamer moment
---
I‚Äôm not going to waste my time trying to prove to you that using a third party application to gain an unfair advantage in a game is cheating, if you can‚Äôt understand that then I doubt there isn‚Äôt any hope for you.

One less nurse? Shame...

[https://streamable.com/o9biw](https://streamable.com/o9biw) \- I finally found the original!
---
I think the locker idea should be changed, like maybe he can teleport between all the lockers, or just scrap that bit completely 
---
Yeah. It really do be like that.
---
yeah yeah shhhhh
---
Man Hag is one of my favourites in red ranks. I really don't get how people have any problems with her, she's not very mobile but randomly detonated traps give you map control anyway
---
Ah ok. Thx. Atleast i mostly make it from 1 kill to 3 ( party lobby for example ) with noed. Got it for fredster and ghosty boi
---
i am finally an epic gamer
---
I don‚Äôt DC against him, but I do fucking hate his guts
---
What do you use? Iron Will, Dead Hard? Anything else?
---
Once I was in Backwater Swamp, the Grim Pantry map vs The Wraith, I was running No Mither &amp; Dead Hard with shirtless David.
---
I was in last hook mode, found the hatch in the lower floor of the Cursed Cabin. Waited a minute, then decided to go out and saw Nea going upstairs then proceed to point at her, then at the stairs, we went downstairs she saw the hatch, turned to me, and I noded my head.
---
Then instantly ran to the second floor of the cabin, jumped through  the window to make noise and run in a straight line in the midle of the swamp, The Wraith makes himself Visible, tried to hit me, I Dead Hard and keep going straight, I get downed, I get hooked right around the corner and die. Nea escapes. A true David was born that day.
---
She's aleady too OP :D
---
Basement trapper is a fun thing yeah?
---
Don't bring my flammability into it! The nerve of some people.
---
Still, it'd be a pretty good time to implement something that slows gen progress as well.
---
Yo wtf üòÇ the rank 8 was talking trash and they all had great perks and you only had 2 
---
Oh I completely agree with that. SWF is NOT fun to fight.
---
The subject is Legion, don't get off topic.
---
It's been months, mate.  It's safe to say there will be no killer experience, huh?  I haven't forgotten, mate. 
---
I waste too much time checking every corner or locker when I have Whispers.
---
If you wanna get legion, go ahead.
---
You'll just get a lot of DCs.
---
Weird. I could swear I saw survivors go from healthy to deep wound but maybe I just wasnt paying attention 
---
Frank's mixtape should be built-in. Giving him a stun for a missed attack will not do a lot in most cases, in some it will make for some counterplay. It would be a step in the right direction. 
---
Come get it!
---
Best advice as stated below, use ds, adrenaline, exhaustion perk and iron will/adrenaline/unbreakable etc. This will give you a lot of perks that will help teach you or give you more chances for looping. You typically want to develop the habit of being able to look behind you while being chased. Good killers aren't W gamers, they will double back.
---
Those 7-10 million bloodpoints i spent on that i could have used on getting more teachables an stuff
---
I main all except Nurse and Legion
---
After two hooks would be pointless, they‚Äôre dead on hook at that point anyways.
---
Did I promise that I would make it because I don't remember doing that. 
---
I edit things when I feel like editing things so don't expect The Killer Experience any time soon unless I suddenly decide I want to finish it.
---
Am I missing something? I saw this post this morning
---
I'm the guy that hoards thousands of items on RPGs and never uses them *just in case*. Also I'm on the grind to get all max perks in all killers and the same with survivors and don't have much time to play, so every BP counts. Those are the reasons I care about my add ons. I can't help it I guess.
---
But in the black abyss of the grind I always do gimmick builds both in survivor and killer to remind myself this game is about having fun. But the add ons.. I can't help it.
---
Still fkin scummy and not enjoyable
---
The all seeing chicken legs
---
Ye and the game is very fun then right ? No it's not
---
Lmao. I‚Äôll take that as your white flag. 
---
You cannot prove that there‚Äôs any explicit policy that states voice communications counts as cheating or a bannable offense (temporary or otherwise). I‚Äôve already provided a direct link to all bannable offenses. Voice communication will never count as cheating for this game. Period. 
---
Even one person running it meant a free gen in like 20 seconds. I‚Äôm not saying Ebony‚Äôs aren‚Äôt game breaking, but even one BNP was still game breaking.
---
They're already doing something to help those squads get games by making all teams load in almost at the same time.  It's gotten to the point where I just hit accept and hope it's not an SWF squad.
---
He‚Äôs annoying to face and annoying to play. Also him with franks mixtape and moonwalk chasing you with bloodhound is absolute cancer to go against. I won‚Äôt dc but I won‚Äôt have fun.
---
Yeah they smelled like gasoline and baby body wash.
---
What you say is true, but if they would have worded it like that, it wouldn't fit as well
---
That‚Äôs true. I now it‚Äôs only one game but it‚Äôs just really crushing when you bring in a flashlight or a key and you lose it in a game you really didn‚Äôt have a chance in :,(
---
Frank's mixtape being base is the dumbest thing I see people suggest for Legion. That will borderline make the killer brokenly overpowered if Legion can just run at you in Sprint burst speed, get 2 quick hits on you, then a few seconds later get a 3rd hit and down you with absolutely no counter play.
---
Yikes. Make you should take the talk with him on how to care for your body. He‚Äôs never gonna get a girlfriend that way!
---
Correct
---
Erase DS fro. The game files but put corn in every map

Changed it to make it more unique.
---
It's not explicitly bannable no. But if you do get banned, the devs can't help you. It's a do at your own risk thing. I've had custom perks and portraits for a long time now and have been fine. 
---
&gt; I was running No Mither &amp; Dead Hard with shirtless David.

i stopped reading after this. please marry me
---
Or not display it at all lmaooooo
---
I'm afraid of playing against them, not them themselves.
---
the few times i went up against the legion, nobody DCed, i guess it's just a thing at higher ranks.
---
My achievements are broken. So frustrating.
---
I live in a city bitch.
---
Well that went down the drain. I've done about a minute and a half of it but I have no intention to finish it any time soon. Sorry to disappoint.
---
Legion is fun to play, not fun to play against.
---
Its for sure not better. Still a glorified Facebook post.
---
If the legion is good, they hit you, and keep frenzy hitting you, until you go down.
---
Mad photoshop skillz!
---
It's to troll, and not rank up from the match.
---
The reason it‚Äôs not a bannable offense is because they can‚Äôt prove that a team was using a third party application (for painfully obvious reasons). The third party apps go against the intended play style of the game and give players an unfair advantage. You can try to rationalize it however you want, but it is cheating.
---

---
Big ass 40 point red circles really did help as I'm 99% blind.
---
That does make more sense haha üòÖ
---
Yeah, but I like them.
---
the wiki says 9%.  I'm not sure which is wrong.  but in any case, is there a noticable difference in vaulting speed with the tier 3 perk?
---
Yeah I'll play however I want ty
---
Well, she's also boring as sin. I don't find her funny or entertaining.
---
This happened to me once on PC.
---
You're right, that would be a bit too strong. The planned changes are better than having a built-in frank's mixtape. On the subject of having no counterplay and being borderline OP, when is the nurse getting any attention?
---
These changes are far too extreme to be realistically considered.
---
If your trying to make long distance traps more meaningful a better solution might just be to apply Legion's deep wounds effect to survivors that freed themselves. Itd make freeing your fellow survivors even more important which would pull nearby survivors off gens, thus slowing the game down and clumping up survivors for easier tracking. Itd also force trapped survivors to spend some time mending deep wounds, which also slows down the game a bit and gives him some extra time to find and pursue the survivor.
---
Mr Bing Bong would like a word with you......
---
You welcome bb
---
Yes, also leader the adds another 9%. 
---
How would this be fair? Struggling out of the traps would do literally nothing, and being saved from them would be nearly impossible. Also, there is a reason iri stone is ultra rare
---
Its a Freddy?
---
Cue me, "what the fuck are you doing saving me with the killer right behind you?" Also me post game, "oh, deliverance and wglf"...
---
I tried to find the source on their website, https://poorlydrawnlines.com, but all I found was an [Imgur link](https://imgur.com/pHe3w2h). sorry 
---
Billy can still be looped, Nurse and Huntress are extremely hard to counter if played properly but still be mindgamed / juked. And both take some skill yes.  
---
Legion can't be juked, can't be looped, and any random can play it to its full potential... So yeah ...
---
Oh crap I didn't see the Billy
---
Have you ever seen a rank 15 slaughter an entire enemy team with nurse? Her powers are super fucking OP but are hard to use and take some time and practice. I‚Äôm talking about a lower ranks were people are just getting used to the game.
---
Some people would rather play a fun game than a game where you do the same exact thing if it's a legion. There is no difference between two good legions. They know how to cheese his mechanics, they will cheese them, easy.
---
Now imagine having to do that in every area since you don‚Äôt have whispers. 
---
Myers! Put your shirt back on! You are going to freeze to death!!!!
---
Is that a problem that they  do that?
---
Aww sometimes I want the killer to get the kill like if they were having a really hard time and got no kills or my teammates were assholes. I dont care if I survive if I got my pip
---
okay their skins are good.
---
Which ones?
---
Console what?
---
How the hell did you get the Skilled Huntress achievement? Feels impossible!
---
Agreed

1. Iron strength doesn‚Äôt seem worth it at all
---
2. For ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be okay‚Äù I think that every hit you take consumes a token and you get 2/3/4 tokens.
---
3. The last perk just seems like a way better Autodidact
---
Don't you care though if you made a post? It's alright to care about something, man. You don't need to be too cool to care about a game you like. I'm done with this convo. I think it was pretty obvious that several people in this thread, including me, are not getting butthurt. I also didn't see any incivility from my side. But live your life with your opinions.
---
I‚Äôve done something similar. Picked billy and sat in the basement with my name as ‚Äúyou irl‚Äù because I got bored. Whenever survivors question marked me I just said I was them irl, ugly an in a basement. 
---
DC'ing isn't failing to load in. It's hitting the disconnect button.
---
Fair enough. I guess you acknowledge that he is at the very least an incomplete killer. Continue to have fun with him.
---
The definition of pain and suffering in DBD
---
Do a gen
---
But the entity isn‚Äôt in the real world so the survivors don‚Äôt really die. 
---
Ye i mean u can but please try and give the other 4 people in the game also a fun time instead of being a straight up cunt
---
But it sounds more like a perk than an ability. And I think it should be while not in a chase, and it's easily among top tier perks because it just helps map pressure so much.
---
Even after you changed it it is worse than coulrophobia even if all the survivors are within your terror radius
---
oh...
---
OH NO...
---
Yeah, but the game wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
---
The adept ones. I've completed them so many times (multiple times) for multiple characters, both survivor and killer. Also, it took me 2 tries to get the one where everyone escapes through the hatch. 
---
Red
---
Making instadown hatchets a part of huntresses base kit? Seems fair
---
she tosses long distance Chanclas as hatchets
---
I prefer alert. Constant updates on what the killer is doing, whether they're in a chase, which pallets are broken. Not to mention when things like hat kick a gen and you can watch where she places traps, or nurse and Billy where you can see which way they're going
---
Ha
---
any map there's a hill also, discordance helps quite a bit. 
---
Both are cool
---
You lost me at pig and wraith is low mid mate. Wraith has amazing map pressure and mobility and Pig has great stalling, stealth and anti loop potential. I‚Äôm curious about your tier list.
---
I don't care how much I have to pay but when it's available I will buy unmasked Susie
---
This looks like it‚Äôs straight from game content holy shit
---
This is what I do.
---
That's a kangaroo :)
---
Having a killer get utterly defeated and still pip isn‚Äôt good for the game.
---
We are not on 2.5.0 currently. 2.5.0 is the new patch.
---
I mean if you learn how to walk backwards during chases after hitting them with deep wounds they can't do anything about it
---
But does survellence work against frenzy?
---
Getting the Rakuyo in Bloodborne
---
Unfortunately that‚Äôs not the case, if you just grind out games you can get there easily in time. Even when we don‚Äôt escape, just doing unhooks and running from the killer, as well as a few gens cops me an easy pip, maybe 2
---
&gt; Pick a place and hide there.
---
&gt; be immersed in a corner and hope he leaves
---
How are these two different?
---
Eh, didnt see the disconnect at first. Thought he was bitching about the tea bagging.
---
Without seeing the entire match I cant comment on the DC. It may or may not have been justified.
---
Yeah this happened to Noob3 aswell, its in his newest vid
---
Whoops! I ment to write 2.4. Thank you for pointing it out LOL.
---
Nice. But why not go for P3 or not P at all? Stopping at P1 seems a bit weird to me.
---
Fire up op please nerf BHVR
---
One of my favorite games in recent memory was playing Wraith on Gideon Meat Plant. I run Discordance and I saw the perk go off on the bathroom gen. I happened to be upstairs so I dropped down into the bathroom while ringing my bell.
---
There were 3 people on that gen and amazingly while 2 of them ran one of them was actually so immersed that I managed to get a sneaky hit on them before they started running.
---
The biggest difference is she still has to be good to pull off the ridiculous stuff she can.
---
Think about how they can both easily close the gap on a survivor. Nurse still has to judge the distance and can overshoot/undershoot it, Legion just runs up to them, both of which can circumvent windows and pallets in some way. If the Nurse misses an attack, hell even if she doesn't attack she is subjected to a stun ranging from 2-4 seconds. Compare that to Legion who can miss 5 attacks before hitting you at no penalty, since they have no cooldown on swings during their power and they don't get fatigue until they either hit you or their whole power runs out.
---
Also keep in mind that if you do lose the killer, the Nurse still has to track you again and it is possible to outmaneuver her, Where this is also the case with the Legion, you can't go far without HAVING to stop at some point to start mending or risk just falling down right then and there, also noting everytime Legion does hit you with Frenzy just lowers your DW bar and resets your mend progress. Your only hope at that point is hope the Legion is god awful at tracking or just goes for someone else.
---
I see what you're trying to get at but they are 2 entirely different situations.
---
Next time clip more of the match so we can see your actions too.
---
Anyone can zoom in on a lign chart to make their point.
---
Yeah, it does that a lot. Totems have a pretty decent chance of spawning in idiotic places, like right next to gens, etc.
---
It's just RNG whether it spawns in a good spot or not, and even if it does, really good survivors often have the spawn locations memorized, so it's just a matter of time before it's cleared.
---
When it's good, Ruin is the best survivor stalling perk in the game, but when it's bad, you basically only get the time it takes to cleanse it.
---
If you want a more consistent, skill-based stalling perk, go with Sloppy Butcher. It usually isn't as good as a really tricky Ruin spawn, and it relies on your being able to find and smack people, but it's not at all RNG based and still adds a pretty significant chunk of time to the game.
---
Heroin - Teachable perk - Instantly heal one health state per match but get the broken status for 3 minutes
---
Prayer beads spirit tho
---
yeah but can myers crouch down and help with the generator I think not pink oink
---
Great... now you brought this ex dead perk to killers minds. Expect killers to cry about it and get it nerfed now. GJ. 
---
It isn‚Äôt only for bad killers, it just has a built in acknowledgment that you expect the game to go until all 5 gens are done. If you have a build that isn‚Äôt so focused on pressuring and preventing gens but rather on the hunt then NOED is just a good way of suring up the build‚Äôs weakness. Just know how inconsistent NOED is and don‚Äôt be mad if it doesn‚Äôt so anything because it was too little, too late.
---
Do you use Urban Evasion?
---
Probably. 
---
Ye and ue probably the dude that plays legion with franks mixtape lmao 
---
Nice now go for P3 all perks
---
I was planning on getting her to P3 before but I realized how I was closer to doing that with my Pig and Leatherface, both which have no other alternate skins other than their prestige skins so I decided to invest prestige points on them while Spirit got all the perks. While I do sort of regret not getting her all the way to P3, it's a little bit too late now, but at least we'll be getting a cool new Spirit skin to make up for my lack of bloody cosmetics. 
---
The part you didn't quote is the difference.
---
The tl;dr is this part:
---
&gt; there's still assumptions you can make about where he is coming from and where you should hide.
---
Any random corner is bad. Some corners are better than others based on the same heuristics you would use to hide from other killers you didn't see before you got terror radius.
---
You also removed the first half of your own point: "It removes all stealth whatsoever" which is just incorrect. 
---
you're welcome :)
---
no, because I dont get influenced by weird public opinions ob the Internet 
---
Yeah, I know what you mean. I think that's why more survivors favor swf. Even without comms, it's just nice to know that other people are there to actually play the game. Because I think what you're describing is your other teammates being "immersed" and not doing anything until someone gets hit, and it sounds like they're just waiting for you. Although, the killer might, unfortunately, really be finding you first every game, too lol
---
Don't have it unlocked for every character. But I'm playing too
---
Read the Spirit's backstory. It is gruesome. Hag too, if I remember correctly.
---
They suffered so much right before they died that the entity was able to get to them.
---
You only really notice the weapon, and it looks cool. I prestiged Wraith back in the day for the same reason, and the hypnotic, shifting glow helped me relax after a bad game. 
---
Legion allows new players to feel accomplished due to slaughtering other new players. Once these players try out new killers and find they are actually challenging and require skill and will likely just play legion because of this thereby ruining the experience for other players. 
---
I see no way in which this is good for the game. 
---
You just HAD to add wall sitting. You're evil
---
I don't mind a late game build with NOED (with Remember Me and stuff) since I still get plenty of BP early and midgame. A *just in case* NOED is what I find kinda dissapointing 
---
My buddy and I were in a KYF match with me as the Nea, and then this happened.
---
Where did you read that ? All I found was
---
&gt;*The ground shook with her father's footsteps. She knew she was not going to make it, but she no longer cared. She would make him pay, in this life or the next.*  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;*A dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She would not rest--not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.*  
---
&gt;*An oath was made and Rin closed her eyes.*
---
Trapper needs a buff to his power of some sort. ffs even just giving him 2 trap capacity as his base kit would be a nice help. He's the only killer I run Ruin on because it's impossible to establish early game anything otherwise. Maybe spawn more traps on the map.
---
*Something* 
---
I think survivors need to adapt to that change. I think the community thinks he‚Äôs ‚Äúunfun‚Äù because they don‚Äôt understand what he‚Äôs for or what skills he‚Äôs trying to test. He doesn‚Äôt take away the skill from the game, he changes which skill sets are important. 
---
And if you don‚Äôt learn from matches you won‚Äôt succeed at this game. At all. Any good player can tell you that. We all learn strategies, Legion and Jeff provide gameplay that emphasizes learning the skills aside from a chase. 
---
I don't like Legion and I don't usually use add ons but you can believe what you want kid
---
Nah, just use it if you want to. It is almost a waste of a perk though, because you want to use all your perks to your advantage the entire game. And it doesn't help at all only until all the gens are done. And even then, you only get like 1 or 2 kills with it, maybe the whole team but that's pretty rare in my experience.
---
Iridescent Stone wouldn't be too extreme at all. But saying that Honing Stone should be part of the base kit is LUL
---
How does legion take away from stealth? Running discordance (Jeff‚Äôs perk) helps avoid aura perks which was quickly killing the game‚Äôs stealth gameplay, and made lockers give stealth as well. They empowered stealth while taking power from the chase. If you can‚Äôt learn stealth then you aren‚Äôt you‚Äôre refusing an entire part of the game in favor for the one part of it you find fun, then complain when they emphasize other skill sets.
---
Yeah, that's not how my luck goes. I sprint to my destination and either I a) run into the Killer on the way there or b) arrive only to hear the Killer's heartbeat 3 seconds later, lol.
---
Hag is top 5 and high tier tbh
---
That's pretty much only Myers.
---
His backstory almost literally states "He just started killing people, the Entity didn't really have to do anything."
---
Failing to load in isn't the same thing as disconnecting, the game just punishes both the same. I'm saying disconnecting should be punished more.
---
Most of the time, survivors try to break line of sight on their own, so you don't have to moonwalk. 
---
He needs to not be able to step in his own traps at least it's so dumb
---
I believe it says you have to down them while in feral frenzy (or actually says killer instinct which isn't even a state the legion can be "in"), but yeah, you would need to down then with the power itself for it to count.
---
Thanatophobia + hangman's trick meta begins.
---
Don't run ruin.
---
Alrighty! Gotta check it out :)
---
One of the main complaints about the game is that gensget done way too fast.
---
Hex totems added into the game. Secondary objective. But far too easy to find.
---
Survivors ignore dull totems.
---
NOED lights dull totem after all gens are done.
---
Survivors complain that NOED is op.
---
Just cleanse all totems to guarantee no NOED.
---
Survivors complain that it'll take far too long.
---
So it's a choice between longer game = more chances to die, or shorter game = probability of NOED.
---
Survivors continue to on mass complain about NOED being unfair.
---
Nani the fuck do you want.
---
Ive read their backstories. I wasnt aware that the Entity promised them revenge or anything. 
---
Welcome to the community. Where people complain even if they'll win.
---
Slugging is one thing, slugging the whole team and letting bleed out is a very different thing. You didn't point that out in your cocky post big brain.
---
Did they fix the bug with this outfit combo? My David is cut in half and I can see inside his character model.
---
She did. A lot of it isn't about revenge, it's more that their souls are so darkened and blemished by what they've done that this malevolent forest god cosmic creature can bring them into its endless game. They don't ALL have an ax to grind (no pun intended in a few cases).
---
Bell boi is best
---
Does it matter who it is?
---
I've played against this before, it's nice seeing people taking the stick out of their asses to have fun
---
Well, you could make it so it only counted leaving from the menu, but then what's stopping people from using alt+f4, end process, airplane mode, any of that kind of thing? Might as well not have one with that many workarounds.
---
&gt;it's practically GG if the survivors are stupid.
---
This is true for any killer, isn't it? 
---
Well then you'll just have to risk NOED wont ya?
---
&gt; Nurse: You might dont get a direct benefit from spine chill 
---
Actually Spine Chill is pretty good against the Nurse. If it lights up, it's likely she's about to blink to your location, so you have time to go away from gens or other key spots where she is pointing at and won't get a surprise hit.
---
How do you face camp people on the ground
---
Don't need them cause I can see colors just fine
---
I guess it really depends on the quality of picture and your screen, but having played when those perks still existed, it was pink. Lol
---
I honestly think that that‚Äôs more indicative of the ranking system really not being great. But that‚Äôs a different issue with this game. As I said, the game still needs work and legion isn‚Äôt perfect either. The game‚Äôs testing a lot of stuff and trying to decide on its direction, I just like this one.
---
Ye i know but i was hella salty cuz after he was like 'can't escape from everyone i guess' like he was a fkin god
---
This
---
Rescuing/healing someone over and over puts otherwise really good survivors in a vulnerable spot. Survivors who are playing poorly are a huge asset to the killer
---
I have actively kept Survivors alive before because they were wasting pallets, blowing up gens, had to be healed every 5 seconds, etc. which made their teammates much easier to catch. I'll take a 4v1 with one bad player and three good players over a 3v1 with three good players any day of the week
---
Acceptance of low effort memes is capital crime of which I will not be a participant, good sir.
---
Also, lol, 13 down votes over a snarky jab.
---
Apparently not.

---
Yeah. But I also like to do it to celebrate a 4K
---
Struggling out of a trap lets you crawl to another place where Trapper won't be able to find you. You're still in a bad situation, but that's to be expected if your **leg was caught in a fucking bear trap**.
---
This doesn't make it any harder for other survivors to save you from bear traps. Neither Honing Stone nor Iri Stone increase the rescue time.
---
There is no reason for Iri stone to be locked behind an ultra rare because it's not exactly an insane effect. All it does is say "This power is no longer laughable".
---
hoy fuck these are incredible
---
The Cleaner they murdered is also implied to be Jeff's father, and is the whole reason he returned to Mount Ormond in the first place.
---
It's called bluetac

Jon Rob was walking around in Paris when the sign of a restaurant had caught his eye, as they opened the door he was greeted by an engulfing layer of fog that rolled over him. He no longer heard the cars or any noise of Paris for that matter, but rather the sound of a river and the creeks of the woods and when he looked up he discovered himself in a forest. It was cold but in the distance he saw the light of a campfire. Some say Jon was enticed by the baguettes of the restaurant and decided to never leave but when they did a search for him he was nowhere to be found... Perhaps another victim of the fog...
---
Seems that way but it shouldnt be. How fucking hard is it to not just give it to the survivors at the start?
---
I'm a new Myers with shit perks lmao what am I gonna do
---
Even if I did face camp that means greens would be done and at least 3 survivors can escape. They didn't, they played until downed and then DC lol
---
Wow so you got all the nurse ones those are real hard if you don't main them
---
Amazing! wallpaper worthy
---
lol, as someone who has platinum'd Bloodborne (including The Old Hunters DLC) I feel you.
---
Sorry, maybe I wrote that in a confusing way.
---
I didn't say he took stealth away. I said he takes the skill of chases away. We can talk about our opinions and how fun he is to play or whatever, but you cannot argue about this. He objectively takes all skill for chases away. Like, there is no argument to be made there.
---
And they empowered stealth? You can't even really stealth Legion any more than any other killer. How is that empowering stealth? Discordance is fine, but aura reading perks are not what's killing stealth. It's how the game is designed. If you want to win as a survivor group, you have to do all the gens and distract the killer for as long as you can so you can do the gens. Not crouch behind a bush. Literally, nothing gets done when you do that. So, I don't think that any of that empowers stealth. BBQ only looks at survs past 40 meters, and not everyone uses nurses. Discordance doesn't make you invisible.
---
Also, when Legion hits somebody and people are close enough, doesn't he see them with his power? So, even then, how is he empowering stealth in that way? I think a lot of people here are making valid points. Listen to some of them and rethink your stance on whether or not Legion is a good addition. 
---
And let's say I'm wrong about everything I just said about stealth or whatever. Taking away chases is not good for the game. It is bad for the game. And you keep calling stealth a skill set in this game. Like, crouching behind a corner and holding m1 is not a skill in this game dude. But, you won't listen to me, and it looks like you won't listen to anyone else here. Inb4 you say "I can say the same about you." 
---
Wait does honing stone not take effect when someone else saves you? I‚Äôve never really played trapper so I don‚Äôt know much more than what the addons and perks do.
---
Also, by the logic that you provide for the first paragraph, all survivors should be dead on first hook because they got a rusty hook all the way through their chest
---
YO BRO. THEY HAVE CHAPTER 11 IN THERE.  
---
**WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR**
---
Elitism? A new low for you survivor mains. 
---
I'm pretty sure a majority of the best players come from NA. Period. 
---
If I kill a team before NOED procs, I killed a team with only 3 perks.  If I kill a team before NOED procs and with Ruin cleansed early in the match, I beat a team with only 2 perks. 
---
Either way, I end up wrecking. NOED is a net gain!  Invest!  
---
No.
---
You're talking about splitting the playerbase into two modes. Queue times would get *worse*, not better. This game doesn't pull in Overwatch numbers here. The queues are already bad enough.
---
Also, there's almost no reason for Killers to play a Casual mode. Survivors are gonna be sweaty in either mode, so its better to just play Ranked mode at all times, especially if Ranked involved no SWF.
---
A casual mode would just increase the odds of randomly going up against 4-man super-swfs, and killer deathgods. At least with a rank, you've got a better chance being paired up with someone of equal time played (if not skill).
---
The current ranked play *is* casual. It solely exists to separate total newbs from the more experienced players.
---
Just make sure the door does not locks behind you. It might take some time to unlock it. 
---
What a wholesome post &lt;3
---
Glad you're in this community :)
---
 Yeah well, I assume you are capable of a basic human function like thinking before acting. If you get THAT mad THAT easily you have a problem so you should start working on that.
---
even the day it released i played for hours and never fly a single legion.
---
I just move on lol
---
I still cry at night
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying I just simply think that distracting the killer and alike is the only way to play. He can find other nearby survivors but if they scatter he‚Äôll have to commit to one. Then the other survivors need to regroup as I said. It seems to me that people are having a big outrage that they can‚Äôt just run around in the game and rush the the killer. You can‚Äôt try and kite him to carry a game and that‚Äôs what I find frustrating about peoples arguments. They seem to think that is the best and most fun way to play for all involved.
---
ps4
---
Susie's the coolest and a female Legion makes more sense as an upgrade to Meg. Unless OP knows something about Meg the rest of us don't. 'Sides, does it matter if a snarky joke matters? 
---
Hmm maybe try to Run it with haunted ground? Or some other hex?
---

I've done similar moves unintentionally.
---
Those damn giant fish men things still haunt ne
---
Mine too
---
But she is the best slow the game down just a lil bit killer
---
I understand how you feel. For me (a killer main), rank reset feels like anarchy. You either get complete monkeys or gods that belong in rank 1.
---
Ahhhhh right. I won't lie and say I've never messaged someone out if anger but usually I'm the one getting the angry message because I almost always get a hatch escape when it's available and it really angers some killers üòÇ
---
Well if i get to sit in lobby for 5 min every time and only get killers with black ward or an ebony mori 
---
Killer instinct is after you hit a survivor who doesn't have deep wounds. You need to down 25 survivors in that state
---

---
Chief, I don't want a knife there. Okay? 
---
It‚Äôs your business as a player, not one side or the other. It does bum out the other survivor and can be annoying for the killer. If you know where hatch is, it may be worthwhile to check it before you hook the downed guy but I personally never spend too long.
---
And for that matter, small area hiding is a skill a lot of survivors could stand to learn. And this is all coming from a killer main, so again, take my opinion with a grain of salt and we can always agree to disagree.
---
And then they even start pulling shit like that
---
&gt;  but I have infinitely more respect for players who attain their skills without using such methods.
---
That means you're probably a bad Huntress or don't play her, because if you did, you'd know a crosshair barely even matter for anything but cross map shots, which are just gimmicks at best.
---
Huntress is not hit scan, a crosshair does not teach you travel time, arc trajectory, how to counter juking, when to pull a hatchet, what you can or can't throw over, etc. 
---
Zubat, for example, never used a crosshair until like last week, and he has now started using it for more consistent long range shots, and he's a fucking amazing Huntress. Good Huntresses don't really care about crosshair becaue they know it's such a small part of the skillset necessary to be a good Huntress.
---
Won't need those cause that build is useless against survivors who don't just stand there while you build up your power. The exit gates will be powered and probably open by the time you hit level 3 with those on
